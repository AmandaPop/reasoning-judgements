=========================================================================

A.1:  Ready, so what do you think?  Do we spend too much on the space program, 
or --

@B.2:  Well --

A.3:  -- do you,

B.4:  -- I think they ought to s-, uh, I don't think they ought to spend, overly
spend on it, but, uh, I don't see anything wrong with, you know, having a
pretty good budget for it because, uh, heck, I don't know, I don't, I think
maybe one day they will, uh, find a good use for it, you know.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Maybe they haven't all that much yet, uh, other than the little things
they've developed in this space shuttle --

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- the little experiments that they've done -- 

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- and so forth, you know, and, uh, I know they asked the question, uh,
would you go if you had the chance --

A.11:  Yeah, would you,

B.12:  -- and I'd go tomorrow -- 

A.13:  Oh, really?  

B.14:  -- if I had a chance [laughter].  

A.15:  Oh, you're an adventurer, huh?  

B.16:  Yeah, right.  

A.17:  What makes it, what makes it so exciting for you?  

B.18:  Well, I don't know, I just, it would be something I've never experienced
before.  Weightlessness --

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- I'd love --

A.21:  #That, that would be fun.#

B.22:  -- #to experience weightlessness.#  

A.23:  #That would be a lot of fun.#

B.24:  #That's something I've always,# uh, thought would be -- 

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- fascinating, you know.  

A.27:  That's true, yeah, I, I'd have to, I'd think once or twice, but I think I'd
probably do it --

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  -- just for the experience, I guess, but -- 

B.30:  Yeah, I think so.  

A.31:  -- it would be pretty interesting, that's for sure.  

B.32:  When they had the, uh, accident -- 

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- you know, ba-, the space shuttle accident and I thought, well, maybe I
won't go [laughter] you know.

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  But, uh, since then,

A.37:  [Throat_clearing].

B.38:  I thought, well, what the heck, I'd go.  If it would be a one ti-, once in
lifetime experience --

A.39:  Oh, yeah.  

B.40:  -- I'd try it.  

A.41:  You could-, couldn't pass it up #that's for sure.#  

B.42:  #No, I don't# think so [laughter].  

A.43:  You think it will ever happen where they'll let, it will be common or,

B.44:  Uh, it might, it, it -- 

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- very well may, uh, I think it's sort of had a setback because of that
accident --

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  -- and, uh, and sometimes I get really disappointed because they have so
many delays when they have a launch.

A.49:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.50:  And everything I think, gee, you know, they'll never get this worked out.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  It just seems like they, they delay it more and more every time they have a
launch.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  So I don't know, you know, they, seems like they sort of bog down, they're
not really progressing right now to me.

A.55:  Yeah, I'm, I'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this, uh, uh, this
space station they're talking about.

B.56:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.57:  You know, I think that would be -- 

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- a step to where, you know, in the right direction but,

B.60:  Yeah.  Well, I believe that, uh, they'll eventually make it to Mars.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  You know, maybe not in our lifetime -- 

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  -- but, uh, you know, if this world is still here [laughter],

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  at that time, I think they'll, I think they'll eventually do that.

A.67:  Yeah, I'd, uh, just the way we progress, I, I, like I say, I'd hate to see
them cut out the, the budget.  There's a lot of places, you know, that can use
it, but --

B.68:  Right.  

A.69:  -- but, you know, simple things like Teflon, stuff like that all came from
the Apollo mission.

B.70:  Is that right?  

A.71:  (( )).  Yeah.  

B.72:  #I didn't# --   

A.73:  #Things they# --

B.74:  -- realize that.

A.75:  -- developed, you know, in that program -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- I mean, it just common everyday things that we take for granted, but --

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  -- you know -- 

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  -- that's, as an offshoot, it's kind of like the military budget, you know,
there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military
--

B.82:  Sure, sure.  

A.83:  -- that we end up using just a, you know, everyday stuff, but --

B.84:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.85:  -- something like that, Teflon, something you take for granted, you use it
every day, but --

B.86:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.87:  -- if it hadn't of been for something like that, you'd never, you know --

B.88:  Yeah, well, that's true.  

A.89:  -- really not have got it so,

B.90:  That's true, and I guess they've got a lot of, uh, they've done a lot of
medical tests --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- uh, in space, too, and, uh, I m-, I don't know what they've, they've
actually come up with --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  -- but, uh, I know that medicine is another -- 

A.95:  Well, they said, yeah,

B.96:  -- area that they u-, that they've used in space a lot -- 

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- you know.  

A.99:  They say in, you know, in weightlessness they're, they're able to do a lot
of different things with the chemicals and minerals --

B.100:  That's right.  

A.101:  -- that they can't do with the gravity, so -- 

B.102:  Right, right.  

A.103:  -- there could be some val-, I guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as
far as I,

B.104:  Is that, no, I don't even know about that.  

A.105:  Yeah, I think it's, they've been a little concerned because it's kind of
chilly, it's cold --

B.106:  Oh, yeah, the --  

A.107:  -- you know, like you say, so they're -- 

B.108:  -- the ice.  

A.109:  -- worried about the same thing that happened to the Challenger, but --

B.110:  Right.  

A.111:  -- they are going up to do some tests with some o-, uh, organisms and 
stuff --

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  -- and weightlessness to see how they, uh --

B.114:  R-,

A.115:  -- how they react to #that and everything but,#   

B.116:  #To the weightlessness,# yeah.  

A.117:  So I think, I think you're right, though, they're getting little better and
better, just, you know, sooner or later, they're going to --

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  -- make some major breakthroughs.  

B.120:  I th-, I think they'll work it out eventually.  Yeah, like you say, it will
be a major breakthrough.  Right now they're sort of, sort of sitting still,
but I think eventually it will, uh, they'll, it will come to them.

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  You know.  

A.123:  Yeah, it's just a matter of time, I guess.  Nothing ever comes with-,
nothing ever comes without some effort so,

B.124:  That's right, well, you know, talking about the weightlessness, I've, uh,

A.125:  [Throat_clearing].

B.126:  I've, uh, noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts
stay up there for nearly a year.

A.127:  Uh-huh.  

B.128:  You know they have a lot of problems with the, I'm not sure what it is,
with the, the muscle --

A.129:  Oh, really?  

B.130:  -- muscle tone and so forth, because they, uh, they have been weightless so
long and then they, course they exercise, but it's not the same as exercising
with gravity.

A.131:  Oh, really?  

B.132:  And the -- 

A.133:  I hadn't heard that.  

B.134:  -- I, I'm not sure exactly what the deal was -- 

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  -- but there were some problems with long term weightlessness. 

A.137:  Oh, really?  

B.138:  Yeah, and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they
were planning on going to Mars.

A.139:  Yeah.  

B.140:  Because, you know, it would be a real long term -- 

A.141:  Huh.  

B.142:  -- talking about a couple of years, I guess.  

A.143:  So it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they --

B.144:  I -- 

A.145:  -- started or,

B.146:  -- I'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was -- 

A.147:  Uh-huh.  

B.148:  -- but I, I remember they had a lot,

A.149:  [Throat_clearing].

B.150:  of problems with their, uh, w-, when they got back to Earth --

A.151:  Uh-huh.  

B.152:  -- uh, walking, you know.  

A.153:  Oh, really?  

B.154:  They w-, they couldn't walk very well --  

A.155:  Huh.   

B.156:  -- when they finally made it back into gravity and, uh, I'm not sure
exactly why that was, you know, I mean it was because of the weightlessness --

A.157:  Yeah.  

B.158:  -- but, I'm not sure physiologically what happened.
