========================================================================

B.1:  So the question is, how do we keep up with current events?  

A.2:  Current events.  You take a newspaper?  

@B.3:  As a matter of fact, as you called, [child_laughing] I was, uh, taking a
look at, uh, the SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER.

A.4:  Is that right [laughter]?  

B.5:  Yeah.  

A.6:  Is that how you usually keep up on the news?  

B.7:  Uh [breathing], I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour fairly regularly.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  And, uh, network news less often and will watch some of the talking heads
programs on P B S.

A.10:  Yeah.  

B.11:  Uh, and that's pretty much about it.  We don't get TIME or NEWSWEEK, uh,
and, uh, as a matter of fact I don't get any of those sort of, of magazines --

A.12:  Yeah.  

B.13:  -- anymore.  

A.14:  I don't either.  It's mostly by the news, but mine is m-, mostly just like
the six o'clock news,

B.15:  [Child].

A.16:  or eleven o'clock is usually about the time I'm ready to look at T V
[laughter].

B.17:  Yeah, do you watch the network news?  

A.18:  Uh, yeah, some.  

B.19:  Yeah, out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock, uh, well,
[child_talking] they're moving the prime time schedule up from, uh, eight to
eleven, which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night,
now to seven to ten.

A.20:  Oh. 

B.21:  And I guess the network news, which has moved up in time out here,

A.22:  [Throat_clearing].

B.23:  uh, will move up on all three [child_talking] of the local network
affiliates.

A.24:  Huh.  

B.25:  I was just reading, as a matter of fact, about the news coverage of the
movie J F K.  And --

A.26:  Yeah -- 

B.27:  -- have you s-,

A.28:  -- that's had a lot of publicity, hasn't it [laughter]?  

B.29:  Yeah, it's really interesting to listen to how different people
[throat_clearing], uh, approach different topics.  Uh, it, the, I didn't
realize this, but, uh, Dan Rather at C B S was the first person to view this
Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination --

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  -- and he viewed it the day after and, uh, got it completely backwards in
terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious
contention that there were two gunmen at least, not one and, uh, it's really
interest-, and he, Rather, r-, later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece
of, uh, uh, evidence backwards, that he'd argued like a lot of other people
that Kennedy had lurched forward after the shot, and he'd, in fact been, uh,
forced backward which lends credence to the two --

A.32:  Right.  

B.33:  -- uh, to the two gunmen conspiracy theory.  Have you seen the movie?

A.34:  I haven't seen it.  

B.35:  I haven't either.  

A.36:  But it sure will be interesting to see how, see it, once I do --

B.37:  Yeah.   

A.38:  -- figure out what all the controversy's about [laughter].  

B.39:  It is, uh, you know, I, uh, are you one of those people who believes that
it was, uh, not a lone gunman that, that we just never really got the full
story?

A.40:  Yeah, I don't think we got the full story, but I don't, you know, I haven't
seen the movie, so I don't really have an opinion about what he had to say,
yet.

B.41:  Yeah, I, I haven't seen the movie either, but I, I think most of us in this
country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy.

A.42:  Right.  

B.43:  And, uh,

A.44:  But, who was involved.  That's, I guess that's the story to tell, huh
[laughter].

B.45:  Well, that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and I, I think it's really
interesting to look at this because I think it kind of gets at the question of
how people get their news.  Sometimes, really important news comes to people
through movies.

A.46:  Yeah.  

B.47:  Through television.  

A.48:  Just like this.  Years later, maybe.  

B.49:  Yeah.  

A.50:  [Laughter]. 

B.51:  And, and I think that's [child_talking] really interesting.  I know that,
uh, my wife and I were talking about how, uh, much, uh, [child_talking]
attitudes toward women, uh, and, and the [\child_talking] relationships
between men and women, husband's and wives, uh, are changing, and I think
people get more of that information through television sitcoms than they do
through reading the newspaper.

A.52:  That's probably exactly right.  

B.53:  Uh, that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and, and, uh, I
think it's really interesting because I think all of those things wind up
carrying the message and I think, uh, uh, it's going to be real interesting to
see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be
able to get via cable television and computer [child_yelling] services.

A.54:  Right.  

B.55:  So much, uh, so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news.

A.56:  That's right.  So what brought you to San Francisco?  

B.57:  Uh, I came up here, [child_yelling] I was, uh, working for, uh, a unit of A
T and T and was promoted.  I came out to California to go to graduate school
and, and was hired out of the P H D program, uh, in southern California and
went to work for a unit of A T and T and they promoted me and moved me up
here.

A.58:  D-, 

B.59:  And we liked it.  My, my wife is from San Diego.  

A.60:  Did, are you living right in San Francisco, then?  

B.61:  Live, uh, right out by the park, right, uh, right off, uh, Lindley Meadow
in Golden Gate Park.

A.62:  Oh.  

B.63:  Yeah.  

A.64:  Well, you're right in the middle of things, then, aren't you [laughter].

@@B.65:  Yeah.  What took you to Texas?  

A.66:  A job.  

B.67:  Yeah.  

A.68:  My brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company
and they asked my husband to come and run it.

B.69:  Oh, yeah?  

A.70:  But we lived in Concord for several years before that and he grew up over
there in San Mateo, so --

B.71:  Uh-huh.  

A.72:  -- we know that,

B.73:  And you grew up in Walnut Creek?  

A.74:  Right [laughter].  

B.75:  Yeah.  

A.76:  So we,

B.77:  How long have you been in Texas?  

A.78:  Um, about nine years now.  

B.79:  That's, do you like it?  

A.80:  I do.  

B.81:  That's a, I -- 

A.82:  I really like it.  

B.83:  -- hear a lot of good things about Texas.  

A.84:  Yeah, I really like it.  

B.85:  It's probably more affordable housing.  

A.86:  Boy, that's for sure [laughter].  

B.87:  Yeah.  

A.88:  You can't even, uh, I mean, it's not even fathomable.  

B.89:  Uh, well, I did, we live, yeah, living here, it's just, it's,
