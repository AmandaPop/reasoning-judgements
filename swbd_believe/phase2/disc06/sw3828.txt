A.1:  So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America
today?

@B.2:  Well, I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and
people getting less time and not serving any of the, or a lot less of the,

A.3:  [Sniffing]. 

B.4:  time than they're -- 
 
A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  -- given by the court system, but, I don't know, with the economy the way
it is, I think crime can't do much but go up.

A.7:  No, I have to, I have to agree with you.  I had occasion a couple years ago
to hear the r-, s-, Chief of Police of Richardson, Texas speak and, you know,
it's a shame [laughter], a, a criminal today, not a murderer, but a guy that
breaks in houses and steals things and, you know, he does this and he does
this for a couple of years, hides all the stash and works off of it and then
when he gets caught, he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years,
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves.  I mean, it's like a
bonus to go to jail.

B.8:  Right.  

A.9:  So, 

B.10:  [Laughter]. 

A.11:  subsequently, a five year sentence means he's going to be out in, uh, a
year on probation.  I mean, what he does, the chief said is he just merely
goes back to his, his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate
and, uh, when he s-, uses up all that and spends all that money, then he, uh,
starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through
the same thing.

B.12:  Well, there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person
sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina, the average serves six
weeks [laughter].

A.13:  Now, see, that's a, you talk about, that's a crime right there.

B.14:  Well, see, we don't have any room in our prisons so,

A.15:  Well, we don't either, in Texas.  

B.16:  They shu-, they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them, get
them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there
for their six weeks and then they're, they're paroled, uh, to make room for
the newest criminals and it just, it, it's just really absurd.

A.17:  Well, it, it certainly is, and, uh, that would be a huge concern.  You
know, I don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what
goes on with our criminal system, our judiciary system and everything
else.  It's just, uh, it's terrible the way it is right now.

B.18:  I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now, so many
different things coming in so many different directions that they've just
decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs-,
or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it.

A.19:  Yeah, as far as steps to reduce crime, if it's, uh, crimes like we're just
been discussing, [noise] obviously we, we need more prisons and more
corrective facilities to put these people in --

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- to, uh, take them off the streets, but I don't think that's going to
happen because, just like you said, and our state's a good example, your
state's a good example and, it's just not going to happen.  As far as the
murderers, and people that commit rape and things like that, I'm not sure
what's right, but I know it, it's [laughter] not right to put them in there
and let them live for years and years and leers, w-, years before you do
execute them or whatever because it's, has to be very costly to feed a
prisoner and to --

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  -- clothe him and, you know, to, I'm sure he gets to watch a lot of T V and
I'm sure they have, uh, exercise facilities and movies and, and everything
else, you know, they can have a good time in.

B.24:  Well, I don't know what the answer is, but I know that asking the question
over and over and over again isn't working so,

A.25:  No, it really isn't.  A big, it's a big problem and hopefully something
will come out of it.  So, I don't know.

B.26:  Uh,

A.27:  I'm, uh -- 

B.28:  I hope so.  

A.29:  -- I'm pretty much of a hard person, uh, I believe in capital punishment, I
mean, you know, a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone, I
mean, you know, if it's just downright, outright,

B.30:  Oh, I definitely believe in capital -- 

A.31:  Oh. 

B.32:  -- punishment.  

A.33:  You bet, I mean, that's the only way to,

B.34:  It's when they, it's when they're in, on death row for nineteen years that
I don't, I'm kind of c-, curious about.

A.35:  Oh, yeah, and you spend thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars to, uh,
take care of them and all, you know, it's just unbelievable.

B.36:  Yeah, you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost a period of twenty
years.

A.37:  Can you really?  

B.38:  Yeah, you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go
round until you, I think the, I think it's, uh, the average is eight to ten
years to get in to the North Carolina Supreme Court --

A.39:  God.  

B.40:  -- and then, uh, after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United
States and that usually takes another four #to six years.#

A.41:  #Oh, I know.#  

B.42:  So it's [throat_clearing],

A.43:  Meanwhile, you're living in a country club situation perhaps, you know.

B.44:  They're hoping, I guess they're, what they're h-, they're trying to prolong
their lives and hoping people will forget what they did.

A.45:  Yes.  

B.46:  But it's just a, we have a serious problem.  We have so many problems in
this state now and, and the, the thing is the, the thing,

A.47:  The drug problem, that's another one.  

B.48:  The fundamental problem is the, is,
