============================================================================

A.1:  Obviously, there have been a lot of changes in the [laughter] rules of
women over the past couple of generations.  Do you, you want, uh, to speak
first about your opinions about what those changes have been?

@B.2:  Okay, I think although there have been some, I am still of the opinion
that we're second rate citizens in most areas.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Uh, I believe, probably World War Two, is when, you know, the thing started
that caused women to be more liberated because the men were at, at war and they
needed women in factories and things have never been the same.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.6:  As far as the, as far as the job market, women started working outside the
home then, but it has taken a long time and think we have got a long way to
go.

A.7:  Yeah.  Well, I agree with you there.  I feel that there is, there is a
turning point still ahead of us.  We haven't gotten there yet.

B.8:  Yeah.  I agree with that.

A.9:  [Noise] Excuse me.  But, I do think that there is a greater awareness of
the, the benefits that the, the feminine side of people offers you know --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- as well as men, you know --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- what you, when you see some of what is going on in the self development
areas, uh, [laughter] you know men trying to find their feminine side.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  It's probably something that men, uh, half a generation ago, wouldn't even
considered as feasible.

B.16:  No, no.  And I think it's a good sign.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I do see, one of the reasons I also believe there is a lot to be ahead of
us is I returned to college and I see girls in their twenties so they think
there is no problem.  They don't realize the struggle that just in the last
few years --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- for them to simply go into professions.

A.21:  Yes.

B.22:  ((Especially,)) they have just been laughed at.  And it can't be done any
more, cause legally it can't be done.

A.23:  That's true.  But it is fairly recent.

B.24:  Yes.  And things, like today, maybe people that don't want to be in a
certain profession, they can't say that well I don't think the change has
come, like from the men's side.  They can still feel it.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  You know.

A.27:  I definitely feel that that's true in the political arena.

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  It is going to be a lot longer before women are --

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  -- in positions of authority on, uh, a majority basis.  You know, there is
always going to be a few, but, you know, whereas in education and in health
care, women dominate --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- the scene in supportive roles.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  I think it is interesting to just look at the history of women in, in
several cultures, to, to determine why in Western culture, they take the role
that they do because it, it matriarch society in a lot of different parts of
the world.  That puts women in a much stronger --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- position and yet, in the West, it is just becoming around to the point
that we can --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- recognize it.  The power that, that a woman offers to the society --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- in terms of nurturing as well as,

B.42:  Yeah.  I wasn't aware of that either until, uh, just a year ago when I took
a sociology course that even existed.  That is how indoctrinated I was.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.44:  But, then I am forty-six.  I grew up with the generation, the guys, my
brothers went to college and, I am now struggling through.  No,

A.45:  That's exciting.

B.46:  And, well wasn't important, you know.  You go be a secretary or be a
beautician.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  That was my point and, uh, but #yeah, I didn't even realize there were
societies# --

A.49:  #Uh, still, a lot of that influence.#

B.50:  -- like you say, where women were important.

A.51:  Yes.  Yes.  And there is so much that, uh, in cultured, we don't realize in
the home how we're, how we are influenced.  I think that even though my
parents might have said, you know, I'm, I am in an area of health care where
there are a lot of women obviously, but, my orientation was never toward being
a physician.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  It was toward being a health care provider in another area and even though
I heard from my father, it certainly, go you know, pursue as far as you can.
You can be a physician.  There was this under lying tone in our home because
my mom did not work outside the home, that it was also okay to not do that,
and so [laughter].

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  It has been a challenge to, to cope with both of my orientations.  I, I
have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside
the home.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  Well, I find myself looking towards what I am doing and I am leaning
towards education and that is still another area of women, but that is what I
want to do.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  You know, have ma-, I have made that decision that that's what I wanted to
do even if it is the traditional thing.  It is still what I want to do.

A.61:  Yes.

B.62:  And I know it's like. 

A.63:  I think that over time, we will recognize what our given rights, our given
gifts are rather that are different from men and it's okay that there are some
difference --

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  -- but, that there are also a lot more areas that can over lap that that at
this point don't.  I think girls are told that they are probably not going to
be as good at math as --

B.66:  Yes.

A.67:  -- boys are.

B.68:  Yes, some something through that too.

A.69:  And they, --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- they may be influenced by that in their school work.

B.72:  I was, very seriously.

A.73:  I don't know if I was by my, by the influence or whether I am just not very
oriented in math as I am to others, [laughter] like verbal.

B.74:  Well, I am not cause I have been tested by,
