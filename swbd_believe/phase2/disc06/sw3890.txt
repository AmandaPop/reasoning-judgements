============================================================================

A.1:  As Texas El Paso, uh, they were undefeated until, uh, Thursday night when
they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City,

B.2:  #Oh, really?# 

A.3:  #and, uh,# they were beaten by, uh, a last minute three point shot.

B.4:  Oh, my gosh.

A.5:  And, uh, so it kind of opened things up a little bit.  They play, uh,
Brigham Young University tonight --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- and, uh, I, I'm pretty sure, uh, they really got a good team this year
and I thin-,

B.8:  Do, do they, do they traditionally have a good team or #is this sort of an
unusually,# 

A.9:  #Uh, yes, they do.# Uh, they usually, uh, they're usually the one or two in
the, in the white conference.

B.10:  Huh.  

A.11:  And they're the only team from Texas.  And, uh,

B.12:  Huh.  Yeah, see and we, it's, they're actually in the University of Texas
system and I don't, I don't even know anything about them.  I'm, here in
Austin we have, uh, U T Austin.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Right.  Which is, [throat_clearing] which is (( )) just generally ((go to
the)) University of Texas, right?  And the, the Longhorns.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  #And, uh,# 

A.17:  #Yeah.#  Who's doing the, who's leading the conference?  

B.18:  Actually I don't know right now.  Longhorns aren't having quite the year
that they had hoped.  #Uh, they,#

A.19:  #I see.# 

B.20:  they had a, a star forward that, that was disqualified, 

A.21:  #Oh.# 

B.22:  #because# of, of something I guess since he was leaving his junior college
day some supporter gave him a car [laughter] or something.

A.23:  Oh.  Oh, I see.  

B.24:  And, uh,

A.25:  I kind of foul things up #((less it's)) (( )).# 

B.26:  #Yeah.# It sure did because they were, they had a real good start and then,
and then, and then ended up, you know, they, they're, they're holding on but
it's not, it's not going to be a --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- [Noise] a season like they had last year when they went to the N C A A.

A.29:  Right.  Well last year the University of Utah went and, uh --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- they had two of their stars, uh, got hurt the beginning of the season
this year and that's why, uh, uh, Texas El Paso is, uh, ((because then they))
University of Utah went to the N C double A's last year.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  And they got into the final sixteen I guess but --

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  -- uh, U TEP like you say is doing real well, and it's, it's too bad that
they have something like that.  Did they restrict the, uh, the Longhorns as
far as, uh, #being able to play in any of the,#

B.36:  #No, it ju-, something that# happened outside of that, you know, and, and
it happened as, as part of his junior college #career.#

A.37:  #Junior# college, so it didn't,

B.38:  #But,# 

A.39:  #affect# their program,  

B.40:  #No, but they pulled him,# 

A.41:  #other than,# 

B.42:  #out of the,# 

A.43:  #loosing him.#

B.44:  #out of the lineup [throat_clearing].#

A.45:  #Yeah, right.#  That's too bad.  

B.46:  You know, and it was something he, he reported himself or I mean they,
[throat_clearing] it wasn't a, and, and the N C A A, uh, immediately suspended
him and then, and then actually U T on his behalf filed a, an injunction in
the court system to allow,

A.47:  #Yeah but,# 

B.48:  #him# to continue to [laughter] play.  Which worked for a few games and
then they, then they pulled him in so.

A.49:  Oh, that's too bad.  

B.50:  Yeah.  But [throat_clearing] they've been having, uh, I mean last year they
had a real good team.  They had ever-, they had a new coach Tom Penders come
in.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  Um, about, I guess about three years ago, and, and the-, the program had
been in a long, a long decline.

A.53:  I see.  

B.54:  You know, for, for years they, I guess back when Abe Lemons was here they
built quite a, quite a tradition.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And then it, it kind of went downhill for bot-, for a couple of coaches,
and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some,
you know, playing some good basketball but,

A.57:  Good.  I know, uh, I was in Montana this last week and I saw the, uh, how
the women's team from, uh, Texas,

B.58:  #Yeah.# 

A.59:  #was# playing, uh, Penn State.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  And, uh, Penn State was ranked number eight I believe in the women's
basketball.  And I, I got to watch the half and then I had to leave on a
flight, uh,

B.62:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.63:  #back to# Utah and I, uh, Texas was leading.  

B.64:  Huh.  

A.65:  I don't know how they came out.  

B.66:  #I don't know, yeah.# 

A.67:  #I don't know if you heard# or not, but, uh,

B.68:  The women's program is quite interesting down here.  The, the women's
program here, in, in Austin, uh, actually for a while it was, was drawing
bigger crowds than the men's program.

A.69:  Oh.  

B.70:  If you can imagine that.  

A.71:  #Yeah.# 

B.72:  #They,# but they, you know, they just have, have traditionally been a
dominant, a dominant basketball team.  I mean they've, they've always been in
the top, top eight in the country.

A.73:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.74:  #Um,# and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as
strong but, but, uh, the, the Southwestern Conference the, they've been
undefeated in the southwes-, they were, no.  They aren't now but they had been
undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year
streak or something.

A.75:  Oh, wow.  

B.76:  And had won the conference title for ten years in the row or so-,

A.77:  That's great.  

B.78:  And so it is, they've, they've, that's, that's quite a tradition here --

A.79:  I'll say.  

B.80:  -- in Texas [throat_clearing].

A.81:  Yeah, uh, that's, uh, last year University of Utah, that was the best
season they've had and, uh,

B.82:  #Uh-huh.#

A.83:  #well that,# that coach had come in this Rick ((Majairis)), he had come in,

B.84:  #Oh, yeah.# 

A.85:  #uh,# he had only been there a couple of years,  

B.86:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.87:  #and, uh,# really built the program, and they were supposed to, well they
were rated up in the, the first, uh, uh, top ten this year.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  Until they lost their, two of their, their star players,

B.90:  #Right.# 

A.91:  #and, uh,# through injuries.  And now they are, uh, they, they did beat,
uh, Texas El Paso and, uh, [laughter] that was kind of strange.  I guess Texas
El Paso was just, weren't, weren't, uh, up hitting.

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  And, uh,
