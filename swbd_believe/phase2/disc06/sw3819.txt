========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think have been the most significant changes?  

B.2:  Uh, mainly the fact that they let women in law now.  I think that had a lot
to do with the way people thought about women.

A.3:  So, lawyers?  

B.4:  Not just lawyers, but police officers and judges and the whole legal
profession in general.

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  Because, it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be
strictly male.

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  And now there's women in it, and I think that affected a lot of things.

A.9:  Well, I think that's a big contributor.  I think women have, uh, really,
uh, begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for
centuries.

B.10:  Oh, I can, I can definitely agree with that.  I, I'm in a field that most
people say is strictly male.

A.11:  Oh, yeah?  

B.12:  Yeah, mechanics.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think, uh, one of the best things that has happened in the
twentieth century has been the, uh, penetration of a lot of these fields by
women and [throat_clearing] I think it's going to continue, uh, and even
though it's pretty difficult now for some men and, and a lot of women, I
think, uh, it's going to bring very good things and, uh, we're going to be a
lot better off as a society as it continues, but it's a painful transition.

B.14:  Oh, yeah, very painful.  Especially when you have certain women that take
very dim views on mothers that actually work.

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  I'm a mother of two and I still hold down a job.  

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  And a lot of people say, well, you're not home with your kids all the time.
Your kids are going to turn out bad.  I don't think so.

A.19:  Well, I think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and I guess
that's the big thing, you know, as people change their attitudes, that's going
to make the biggest difference.  Women, uh, participating as equal partners
[inhaling] in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen, and
history will record that, but a lot of people really don't like that idea 
and --

B.20:  Some -- 

A.21:  -- uh,

B.22:  -- men, but you'd believe, you wouldn't believe how many women --

A.23:  No -- 

B.24:  -- #are against it.# 

A.25:  -- #I, I'm not,# look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before
the Senate subcommittee and --

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- uh, now, I'm not surprised by that at all.  We have, uh,

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  we have a two year old, my wife, uh, works out of the home, uh, and, uh,
uh, I think just looking at how her, uh, views differ from those of her mother
a generation --

B.30:  Uh-, --  

A.31:  -- #before.#

B.32:  -- #huh.# 

A.33:  So it's, it, it's really changing attitudes and, uh, the economic necessity
and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big
difference, I think, uh, it's a painful transition, but a really important one
and,

B.34:  Oh, yeah, and I think it's one of the biggest steps we or any other country
in general could take.

A.35:  Yeah, I think it's a big step for humankind and I think, uh, it's, it's
real progress, but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to
change and I --

B.36:  #Yeah.#  

A.37:  -- #I guess,# in answering the question, that's what I would say.  I'd say
that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal
participation and equal pay and equal political influence and --

B.38:  Yep.  

A.39:  -- all sorts of other things for women because that's really going to be
better for everybody, but a lot of people are threatened by that as is
reflected in what goes on.

B.40:  Yeah, that's for sure.  And you know, a lot of people think that the men
are the ones that are fighting this, but you'd be surprised the majority of
the people that are against women going into the work force, doing, you know,
even jobs, you know, on an even keel with men, a good percentage of them are
the women that are fighting it.

A.41:  Yeah I,

B.42:  And most people say, well, men try and keep women locked up.  That's not
necessarily true.  I mean, the women have these ideas that they got to be the
little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good,
you know, a good job and that's not necessarily so, but everybody's blaming it
on the guys, saying, well, the guys don't let the women out.  That's not
necessarily so.  It's just the women --

A.43:  Well, I think, I think both,

B.44:  -- have to realize they can do both.  

A.45:  Yeah, both attitudes have to change.  

B.46:  [Cough]. 

A.47:  And I think, uh, uh, it's, it's evident to me as I look at all the
television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women, uh,
watching ROSEANNE last night, watching, uh, the show that preceded it, HOME
IMPROVEMENT, all these television shows which reach the American people are
beginning to reflect new attitudes.

B.48:  Yep, and the fact -- 

A.49:  And those,

B.50:  -- that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the
home together.

A.51:  Well, and not only, I mean [laughter] the, the fact of the matter is that
women have, have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and,
uh, I, see, I think this is part of the problem for men as well, as a guy, I
recognize that it's, uh, it's men who have suffered from this, too, because
men need to l-, to learn,
