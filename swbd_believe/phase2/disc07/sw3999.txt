==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, Barbara, whenever you get around to purchasing your next new car,
what are going to be the chief considerations?

B.2:  One of the main considerations is safety and quietness and, uh, economy.
What about you?

A.3:  Uh, I'm interested primarily in reliability.  Uh,

B.4:  I have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable.  Uh,

A.5:  W-,

B.6:  I haven't found any that have left me down yet.  What are your specific
requirements, American or foreign?

A.7:  Well, uh, let me give you a little history on that.  I, I drove, uh, G M
cars for a long time and, in fact, I had a, uh, Chevrolet and it ended up
cost-, it was only about five or six years old and I was paying on the
average, a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing, and I just
couldn't handle that.  So, I took a deep breath and bought a Toyota and have
lived happily ever after [laughter] since then.

B.8:  Really?  

A.9:  Yes, yes, I've had two small problems, neither one of which left me by the
side of the road, uh, with the Toyota in the last five years, and, and when I
was buying that I was concerned primarily with re-, reliability, and, but I
also wanted a hatchback because, you know, y-, you, sometimes you have to
carry bags of fertilizer.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  Uh, so, well, it is a sports car that I got, which is my first, probably my
last one because comfort is not [laughter],

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  high on the list when you get a sports car.

B.14:  Do you have a family for comfort or --

A.15:  No.  

B.16:  -- just you.  

A.17:  Just me --  

B.18:  Well --

A.19:  -- ((to fit)).

B.20:  -- I had the same problem whenever I had a General Motors car.  I had a
Chevy and, uh, it was constantly giving me valve problems.  I had this
constant ticking of the valves and, uh, I switched over to Chrysler Plymouth,
and I haven't had a lick of problem.

A.21:  Does your car have an air bag?  

B.22:  Yes.  

A.23:  It does?  

B.24:  But just on the driver's side.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  I wish they would come out with them every-, on the passenger side, too.

A.27:   Yeah, I suspect they probably will, and I think on my next car
I'll be concerned, I'll, I think I will want antilock brakes.  I've
heard good things about them.  It was the first year it was offered
on the Toyota Supra when I bought mine -- 

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- and I was a little nervous about some new technology [laughter].

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  I mean, I'd got to where I had r-, this real hate relationship with
anything that looked like service department at a dealership [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter] Well, I found out they're pretty good whenever, uh, especially
on weather like we're having today and, and, uh, the roads are so slippery --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- that antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have.  

A.35:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I'd, I'd like that, I don't know, uh, I have a friend
who drives an Acura Legend which is very comfortable car --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- and it, it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is [laughter]
every time I ride in his car.

B.38:  My daughter has a Civic Honda --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- and that's a real comfortable car to -- 

A.41:  Oh, is it?  

B.42:  -- sit in, yeah.  

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   Which surprised me.  

A.45:   Yeah.  

B.46:  I have a Chrysler now I just bought and, uh, it's real comfortable, and I'm
very happy with it, but Chrysler has a good warrantee that they have to stand
behind, so I haven't had any worries about that.  That's one thing I go for in
a car is their warrantee and, uh, what does and doesn't come under that
warrantee.

A.47:  Yes.  

B.48:  But, they have seven thou-, uh, seven thou-, seventy thousand miles or
seven years I believe.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  And, uh, bumper to bumper and I have no complaints -- 

A.51:  Well, that's great.  

B.52:  -- so far with mine.  

A.53:  That's great.  So if you had to do it again, you'd buy another Chrysler, do
you think?

B.54:  I sure would.  

A.55:  Would you?  What, 

B.56:  Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler, something in that line.  

A.57:  Yeah, that's interesting because, I mean, I, I was hearing, just o-,
[laughter] on the way home from work the other day I heard something on the
news about the trade deficit for December, the figures were some, some very
large number.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  I was thinking, golly, and, and, you know, it's partly my fault.  I mean,
not in December, but [laughter],

B.60:  [Laughter]. 

A.61:  I, I really have a problem buying Japanese things.  For years I bought
American and, I don't know, I hope by the time this car wears out, and I hope
that's not for another five or ten years --

B.62:   Well,

A.63:  -- I hope that I can get an American one at that time.

B.64:  Well, that's another fallacy, because, uh, so many people say that's a
requirement, has to be American, but, uh, did you know that my Chrysler has
foreign parts in it --

A.65:  Oh, sure.  

B.66:  -- and so does Chevy and so does Ford?  

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  So, uh, I often hear people saying, well, I want to buy American, or I like
the foreign something and, uh, they're built right here, like the foreign cars
are even built over here.  Datsun has a,
