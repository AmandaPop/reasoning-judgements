B.1:  (( )).

A.2:  I, I pressed one.

B.3:  All right.

A.4:  All right.  Uh, on, uh --

B.5:  Benefits.

@A.6:  -- benefits and, um, for the, benefits of working for a large corporation.
I found the biggest, I do work for one now, and the biggest benefit is that,
uh, there is a little more backup when I need it.  Do you work outside the
home?

B.7:  Yes, I do.  I work for the school system --

A.8:  Oh.

B.9:  -- Richardson school.

A.10:  That's a pretty large corporation.

B.11:  Yes, it is, and, uh, retirement's one of the good benefits.

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  And, um, health care has been a mess --

A.14:  Oh, yeah.

B.15:  -- and that can be, with a large corporation it used to be, but I think
that's a mess for everybody now, isn't it pretty much?

A.16:  Yeah, it keeps changing #because they, they# --

B.17:  #It keeps (( )).#

A.18:  -- have to keep shopping around.

B.19:  Yes, for the best, #where it# --

A.20:  #Uh-huh.#

B.21:  -- used to be one of your bet-, you know, you got the whole package with
your larger companies --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- and you didn't have the problem.

A.24:  Do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one?

B.25:  Yes, I think I do.  I've never worked for a small one, so I can't tell you
--

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- you know, but, yes, I believe the benefits, and the pay, is much better
than you would get in a smaller system.

A.28:  Well, I think, uh, course, I'm, I'm a medical technologist, and, and in our
line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself --

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  -- and that's the biggest benefit I find, because, um, you have more backup
and more people to call on --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- with problems that may arise --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- and, uh, of course, uh, you know, it, uh, it varies with the situations.

B.35:  Right.

A.36:  Do you have good resources in your school district?

B.37:  Right.  We do have very good resources, they're excellent.

A.38:  Yeah, to #my mind,# --

B.39:  #(( )).# 

A.40:  -- that's the best thing for working for a big place.  Um, is, how about
you, how do you feel about that?

B.41:  Well, it's an important aspect of it, I feel, you know, it is, it is an
important aspect --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- as far as, um, being, having, having everything available to you --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- the, uh, counseling and the whole, #um.#

A.46:  #Whole# ball of wax.  

B.47:  Uh-huh.  #(( )).#

A.48:  #What would you# like to change in your benefits?

B.49:  Well, probably the major one would be the medical --

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  -- I would like to see a better package for the money, you know, (( )) --

A.52:  [Lipsmack] Yeah.

B.53:  -- but I guess we all would.

A.54:  #Do you have to pay?#

B.55:  #And they keep cutting# us from the, you know, they keep cutting from the
[noise] medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- and you used to get the eyes, and the whole thing --

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  -- and you don't get any of that any more.  You know, it's all separate,
and it's all so very high, if you do get it.

A.60:  Yeah.  Well, ours is.

B.61:  And that's very frustrating, and I can't imagine how the younger families
do it.

A.62:  Well, it's, it's difficult [laughter].

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  I know, uh, ours has improved over what it was, #because# --

B.65:  #Uh-huh.#

A.66:  -- we just went to a larger corporation --

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  -- and that's what helped it improve.  But the one thing I'd like to see in
our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic [laughter] --

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  -- so that's how I'd like to improve ours.

B.71:  Uh-huh.  I, I was just going to say, the retirement is fair for teachers,
but my husband has retirement too, and it's not good though.  We've had to, I
mean, we're building our own, you know.

A.72:  Oh, well, you have to.

B.73:  You have to any more.

A.74:  Uh-huh.  You have to if you're smart.

B.75:  You can't count on companies on that any more that, and that's another
thing that's changed.  The, the medical and the retirement benefits from large
corporations.  It's kind of, it's, it's like, it was set --

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  -- you know, you were really set for life, really.

A.78:  Well, in the large corporations, the one thing you have --

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  -- to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost --

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  -- at retirement age.

B.83:  You have to (( )).

A.84:  And that's, that's kind of rough. 

B.85:  Yeah.  I remember my mother talking in the forties for, her father was cut.
You know, they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing
now.  They were cutting in at forty-five --

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  -- and fifty years old, and that's what they're doing again.  It's like a
recycle of the whole --

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  -- when they see they're going to have to pay all those benefits and all,
or it's --

A.90:  Yeah.

B.91:  -- getting close to retiring --

A.92:  Yeah, #it happens.#

B.93:  -- #they bring in,# they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to
pay as high, and.

A.94:  Yeah, but, uh, course I think they're losing an awful lot of valuable --

B.95:  Oh --

A.96:  -- expertise.

B.97:  -- I do too, and the wisdom behind it all, it's --

A.98:  Uh-huh.

B.99:  -- yeah, and you know that's got to co-, that's got to add in all their
production, the whole works.

A.100:  There used to, to be an actual management of hiring, and --

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  -- we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn
off and rehire --

B.103:  Yeah.

A.104:  -- because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work
on it.

B.105:  Yeah.

A.106:  Yeah, that was, uh, it's expensive, and I don't know why they don't build
that into it, but I guess.

B.107:  Well, it's cost again --

A.108:  Uh-huh.

B.109:  -- you know, cutting costs,
