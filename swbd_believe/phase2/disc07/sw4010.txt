=========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about drug testing?

@B.2:  I think it's pretty good.  I think they should do it, especially in, uh,
in companies where, uh, you deal with, uh, either with other people or with,
uh, stuff that, uh, I want to say, uh, deals directly with people's lives,
like hospitals [laughter] and stuff.

A.3:  Yeah, yeah, but.

B.4:  Um, everywhere, you know, when, uh, when I was in college, when, everywhere
I applied a job for, uh, pretty much did a drug test, because most of them
were like defense contractors and stuff --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- except, uh, the, the last job, the job I actually took, they [laughter]
didn't care.

A.7:  Oh, is that right?

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Was it a large or a small company?

B.10:  It's a big company.  It's, uh, M C I telecommunications --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and I think, uh, they may require it for like the field engineers, the
people that actually go out, you know, and drive their trucks around and stuff
like that --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- uh, or run the heavy machinery, but they don't require it for, you know,
the engineering positions.

A.15:  Is that right?

B.16:  Yeah, I was kind of surprised, but, defense contractors only want you doing
it because they don't want you to sell drugs, or buy drugs, for, you know, for
secrets or something [laughter] you know.

A.17:  Well, sure, I, there's that part of it I think, and, and I think most
defense contractors also have other divisions of the company --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- that can also be affected by that, and --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- I think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from
getting sued or something is test everybody in the company --

B.22:  Um.

A.23:  -- at least on a random basis.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  In other words, no matter whether you work in, uh, defense or consumer
products or whatever, you'd, you have an equal chance of being tested.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  I, I don't know, I just think it's a sick thing that we've [laughter] come
to that.

B.28:  Yeah, I mean.

A.29:  I don't like the way the world's,

B.30:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.31:  going.

B.32:  Yeah, I mean, I have, I have no pro-, I mean, people complain so much, you
know, about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this
stuff, and, you know, I, I don't know, I guess it's bad, you know, to go
inside (( )), you know, hand them a urine sample bottle, [laughter] you know,
#but, uh.#

A.33:  #Well#, I've heard a lot of discussions about this, and I guess the
scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive --

B.34:  Right, right.

A.35:  -- and, and that's what, what really upsets a lot of people who are, you
know, very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  But the idea that they could lose their jobs, or, in our case, be forced to
go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff, you know, just in the case
of a false positive.

B.38:  Well, I mean, now even if you had a false positive, I mean, they're,
they're better, you can have retests or, what do they do, test on your hair,
they can, uh.

A.39:  Uh, no, urine.

B.40:  Well, can't they also test your hair?

A.41:  Yes they can, and I think that's probably be more acceptable.  I believe
it's more accurate.

B.42:  Right, right.

A.43:  But that's not what they're doing at my company.

B.44:  Oh, really.

A.45:  No, it's urine samples.  I haven't been tapped yet [laughter],

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  to do this.

B.48:  Okay, well, yeah, you know.

A.49:  But they certainly started out, I believe with the managers and folks --

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  -- like that.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  Well, they, uh, I mean, all the places I went to, you know, they
gave us, you know, small tests and stuff like that.  I guess if, uh, you could
always get a second opinion.  I mean, if your company tests positive, I mean,
I, I, I would think there was a way, there'd be a way around it if, I mean,
even if you did test positive, you could probably get tested again, and, uh,
test negative.

A.53:  Yeah, well.

B.54:  Any way, (( )), wouldn't it.

A.55:  Yeah, I, I suppose, I suppose.  It's, it's just, you know, the whole idea
of all the hassles you'd have to go through --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- and certainly the records that would be left behind --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- you know, everybody has databases these [laughter] days,

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  and they know a lot more about me than I'll ever remember, I'm sure.

B.62:  Yeah, and a matter of fact I think there're too many of these little
databases around [laughter].

A.63:  Yeah.  Well, I'm, I'm certainly, certainly sure that, uh, any drug test
results would become a part of that.

B.64:  Yeah, that's true.  I guess they put it in your personnel file.

A.65:  Probably so.

B.66:  Yeah, because, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm surprised they don't do it, you
know, in, uh, my organization --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- but, uh.

A.69:  Well I certainly believe in it for, uh, like, people like airline pilots --

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  -- or, what seems to be more of a problem, train drivers.

B.72:  Uh-huh, [laughter] yeah.  Train, (( )) and also, uh, uh, uh, boat captains,
I mean, not necessarily big boat captains, but small, the, uh, small personal
boats --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- they had trouble with, uh, not just substance abuse, but, uh, alcohol
abuse and stuff --

A.75:  Oh, sure.

B.76:  -- and they have these boat crashes, and, you know, all these people were
getting arrested and they finally said, no more alcohol out there, you know,
in, uh, like where I used to live in Virginia --

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  -- they had a lot of problems with, uh, with boat wrecks and involving, you
know, alcohol related incidents and, uh, drug related incidents.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  So they finally just said, uh, if we catch you, we're going to take away
your license, and take away your boat if we have to.

A.81:  Huh.

B.82:  And so.  [laughter]  Straighten a few people out.

A.83:  Well, I guess it would, I guess so.  Well, I don't know, I, I really
haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing.

B.84:  Um.

A.85:  Uh, I'm totally straight,

B.86:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.87:  would never consider using [laughter] drugs --

B.88:  Uh-huh, well, you know, (( )).

A.89:  -- but it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- and you have to prove that you're innocent.

B.92:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.93:  On the other hand,
