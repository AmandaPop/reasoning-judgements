B.1:  topic is recycling today, and actually, I'm pretty hot about the topic
right now.

@A.2:  Oh, you are?

B.3:  Yes, I am.

A.4:  You're, you're into, uh, recycling.

B.5:  I'm into recycling.  I've got several friends who use me as their recycling
drop off, matter of fact.

A.6:  Uh-huh.  What materials do you recycle?

B.7:  I recycle glass, plastic, and aluminum.  Also paper and plastic bags --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- and, I, uh, in Dallas, we recently had a report on the news, in the
evening, about what's being done with the recycled, the recycling materials --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- and green glass, and several other items, but green glass in particular
is being tossed into the landfills.  And I got really hot about that, because
--

A.12:  So.

B.13:  -- my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale, and it's packed in green glass.

A.14:  So you're trying to take action to have that changed?

B.15:  Well, yeah, I'm, I'm racking my brain thinking, okay, where can I, what can
I do to take action on this.  The only recycling plant, I think in the south,
is in Atlanta --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- and they're paying, I think, eighteen cents for every hundred pounds of
green glass.

A.18:  Right.  So economically it's not a situation where you're going to be able
to attract a lot of attention.

B.19:  No, I'm not --

A.20:  Right.

B.21:  -- but I've got, good gosh, I've got probably twenty or thirty pounds of it
in my yard right now --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- waiting for a recycling place to take it to, and I would really be
disturbed if I found out that the place I took it to was going to just put it
in the landfill, I mean [child_crying] I could have done that.

A.24:  Well, I think, um, that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now is the
fact that with all the recycling that took place, the price per pound has
declined.  I know --

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  -- aluminum in our area, one year ago aluminum was forty-five cents a
pound, and now it's twenty, last time I went it was twenty-two cents a pound.

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  So it, uh, there's not a lot of money to be made, but it's --

B.29:  #No.#

A.30:  -- #just# a question of trying to help the environment.

B.31:  Well, [child_crying] that's the, that's the thing is I, uh, I would rather
help my environment, and when I turn in glass and aluminum, I turn it in to my
church, which has a community center --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- and the community center uses the money to help with an after school
program to help keep kids off the streets and to, to give them a fighting
chance in the world in regards to education --

A.34:  Right.

B.35:  -- and I think that's a real worthwhile project, and that's really what got
me started recycling, was this, uh, community center.

A.36:  Um.  Yeah, where, uh, where I work we recycle paper, that's about it.

B.37:  Do you?  Which kind of paper, computer paper?

A.38:  Yeah, any, any, um --

B.39:  Oh, any.

A.40:  -- non, noncolored or nonfilm type paper.  Just --

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  -- white paper and that sort of thing --

B.43:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.44:  -- and.

B.45:  But do they recycle computer paper?  

A.46:  Uh.

B.47:  I mean like the, the green and white barred.

A.48:  Oh, we don't use that kind of paper any more.

B.49:  Oh, you don't use that paper, okay.

A.50:  No, we have perforated for personal printers --

B.51:  Oh, yeah.

A.52:  -- and then like Laser Jet type paper.

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  We don't use the green bar type paper any more.

B.55:  The old, the old green bars, uh-huh.

A.56:  Right [laughter].

B.57:  Yeah, because our church also recycles computer paper, and I don't know why
I was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to --

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  -- even the personal, uh, letter sized.

A.60:  Well, I would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're
not really breaking even on their recycling, #I mean# --

B.61:  #Uh, well.#

A.62:  -- unless they get volunteers who have, people who have trucks and that
sort of thing.

B.63:  Yeah, we have volunteers, and there's not that, it's not that wide of a
participation, just yet.

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  So, although with my friends helping, we, we contribute quite a bit of
glass.  We all have children, and quite a few of the children are in baby food
--

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  -- and those baby food jars, believe it or not, really add up fast.

A.68:  Right.

B.69:  #So.#

A.70:  #Well,# there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where, uh, you have
specific trash bins to put recyclables in, and then they're collected on a
regular basis.

B.71:  Oh, yeah, curbside recycling.

A.72:  Right.

B.73:  Yeah.  They have that in Houston and in Dallas, and I saw another report
where in Houston, they take the bins, and they load them up into the truck in
the separate areas in the truck --

A.74:  Right.

B.75:  -- and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill.

A.76:  [Laughter].

B.77:  That got me heated up, too.  That got me real heated up.  A friend of my
mother's told her about that, and she was telling me about it, and then I saw
a report on T V, too.  And I thought why are we going through this trouble,
and I had a report tell me why we are.  We go through the trouble because
everybody's worried about the environment, and now that we have, uh, the, the
smaller, the lay people worried about the environment, now we have to get the
businesses worried about using the recycled product --

A.78:  Right.

B.79:  -- that not that many businesses are,
