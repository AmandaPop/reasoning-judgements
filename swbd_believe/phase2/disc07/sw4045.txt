=========================================================================

A.1:  So, um, what do you do about recycling in Raleigh?  Is there any public
program?

B.2:  Yeah, they, they, uh, get, they, regarding recycling they just gave us, uh,
about five, man, about five or six months ago, they passed out these, um,
green containers to everybody in the city --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, uh, they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass, I
think, or, well, clear glass and, uh, you know, brownish glass, and, however,
no plastics.  Oh, cans was another thing that they're recycling.  Um --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and so, you know, there [laughter] really wasn't a lot that I could put
in there, anyway.  I just mostly had bottles, um, and it seemed like that, uh
plastic, would, would have, would have been very helpful to recycle.  Well --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- finally they started plastics, but only the kind of milk bottle
plastics.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  How about, how about in your area?

A.11:  Well, one of the, um, where I used to live they had a, they had just
started a program, but apparently it wasn't city-wide, because I moved over to
a different neighborhood, and they didn't, you know, no one had ever heard of
this.

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  And, um, the one nice thing though, is I'm, is I'm luck-, is I'm pretty
close to downtown, so, um --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- aluminum cans be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard,

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  and the bums come around, and.

B.18:  Do they have a deposit on them?

A.19:  Uh, no they don't have any deposit, but, um, you know, there's a, there's a
thriving industry of homeless people that collect aluminum cans and turn them
in for, you know, recy-, the waste aluminum.

B.20:  Right, right, yeah, because, uh, in, in places where there's a bottle
deposit, I know that if you discard anything, somebody will pick up,
[laughter] --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- which is a good argument in favor of deposits.  Course, uh, now, with
Adopt A Highway, they get rid of a lot of that anyway, but I'm not sure when
they do pick it up if the recycle it there.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, unless, I, I don't, I think they only carry one bag, when
I've seen people out there, yeah.

B.24:  Yeah, well, I mean, well, yeah, but I mean, if you put, you know, I, oh, I
see what you mean.  Everything would be in the same bag, and they would have
to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash.  Yeah.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Yeah, that would, that would be good because, uh, you know.

A.27:  Yeah, yeah, that seems like it would be, you know, very labor intensive to
actually, you know, go through it all, and --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- pick out the different things.

B.30:  Right.  Of, of course, if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Um, now soft drink companies don't want that because it, uh, obviously, it
would have a negative effect on sales to some degree.  I don't know.

A.33:  Yeah, (( )) you know, they have the cost of the cleaning equipment to clean
the bottles, and --

B.34:  Um.

A.35:  -- and things like that.

B.36:  I suppose, yeah, but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic.  I
think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  It should be, anyway.  Well, did you see, there was an interesting article
about recycling in the WALL STREET JOURNAL about three or four weeks ago --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- that talked about some commodities that are being recycled.  Uh, they
[laughter], they, they just finished out recycling before there's an industry
to deal with the stuff, and --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I forget where it was.  I think it was Portland, Oregon ended up burning
a bunch of it, because it was just piling up and they had no where to put it.

A.43:  Yeah, I've heard that, you know, a lot, a lot of the, you know, more
popular recycled materials, like aluminum and, um, paper especially, that,
because, you know, everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and,
you know, has moved to recycle, that the, you know, that, that, that, that the
systems basically has this very large backlog of, of material to be recycled
--

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and processed and apparently in a lot, you know, in a lot of industries,
you can't just, you know, take a bunch of stuff and recycle it.  You
generally, you mix it with, with new material --

B.46:  Right, yeah, I think.

A.47:  -- and that, and that, you know with, you know, coupled with the recession
that there just isn't, you know, the demand for, you know, recycled product.

B.48:  Yeah, well, I don't, yeah, I don't know.  I guess, if, if, if, as far as
packaging materials are, are concerned, if, uh, durable goods purchases good
down, you need less packaging.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I, I don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to
economic conditions, though.  I, I, I, I expect that, [laughter] you know, I
expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are.  I don't think that's
one of the things people think of cutting back on, but it would certainly be a
way to save money.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Um, but, um, yeah, the, the, the article, uh, mentioned that it very much
depend upon, depended upon, what kind of products you're talking about.
Certain things, and I believe clear glass is one, there is plenty of market
for.  They can use all they can get.  But it's other things, and I think some
of the plastics are, are, are, are among those that's rather difficult to
recycle then there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become
--

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- uh, viable.  

A.55:  Yeah, yeah, I think it depends on like the little number in the circle --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- that they have on them, because that --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- I have a lot of friends that, you know, are very into recycling, you
know, and say, you know, just about, they try and throw out as little as they
can, you know, and, and.

B.60:  Yeah, that's right, right.  [laughter] Um, well, I'm down, [laughter] I
read somebody say he was down to, uh, one bag of garbage a week, and it's
about the same with me.  But, I tell you, my garbage is mostly, by weight, is
mostly junk mail.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  If I could get rid of that [laughter],

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  it wouldn't be much at all.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  It's just (( )).
