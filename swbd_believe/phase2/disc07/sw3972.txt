===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, we have, uh, we have a family reunion every, every summer, and, uh,
we, different, uh, sides of the family take turns on planning it, sending out
the invitations, and then, uh, the activities that we have, we kind of get
together and have a luncheon, or a lunch, or a, a cookout or barbecue or
whatever, and, uh, and get to know, so all the cousins get to know each other
and we really enjoy our, our family, uh, get togethers and family reunions, so
to speak.  Are you able to do that?

B.2:  Yes.  We have ours every three years.

A.3:  Oh, okay.

B.4:  And, uh, we have, uh, relatives in Mexico and Brownsville, Texas and
Pennsylvania, Ohio, um, West Virginia, Virginia [breathing] --

A.5:  (( )).

B.6:  -- and Florida, so we've got them everywhere.  New Jersey, and that's why
we only have one every three years, so everybody can get together, and we, uh,
have one from early morning, it starts at eleven --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and it goes all day.  And we just had one, uh, year and a half ago, we
have it every summer in, uh, place called Bare Rocks.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  It's a c-, it was a, a resort, and it was catered, and, um, I hadn't seen
cousins that I hadn't seen for years, and others that are new in the family,
from marriage or,

A.11:  Well, that's really great, and, uh, they're able to come from long
distances like that.  We, we have children in Ohio and, uh, Texas and Germany
and Illinois, and, uh, all over, but they get to some of them but this is, uh,
the ones that live in Utah and --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- but, it, it's sure great.  Uh, those family reunions are really
something.

B.14:  Aren't they wonderful?

A.15:  (( )).

B.16:  Uh, it's a shame that people can't get together like that more often and,
and, uh, have a close family tie.

A.17:  It really is, because that, that really helps, and like say, to get to know
each other and the background and we, uh, we, the one that we have every year,
uh, we go up to, uh, go up into the canyon and camp out for, uh, over the
weekend.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, it, we have a bonfire and, uh, sit around, and in the evening,
and, uh, around the pine tr-, in the pine trees in the mountains, and, uh, the
atmosphere's just really nice, and then the kids get to play with each other,
and it, uh, it's a super thing, uh.

B.20:  That sounds like fun.  We only have ours for that one day --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, um, then we make plans, who's going to have the next one, where
it's going to be, and all that.  And the next one I believe is going to be in
New Jersey next year.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  So, um, do you have a large family?

A.25:  Uh, we have, uh, there's probably about, uh, our own, own family, there is,
we had six children, but we have, uh, my wife's side of the family is the one
that we go up to, uh, Idaho, up in the canyon, and, uh, there's probably
about, uh, forty people there, and, uh, total.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  And then we do have another get together at Christmas time on my side of
the family, and, uh, this last one we had eighty-five people to that one.

B.28:  Well, that's good.  

A.29:  (( )).

B.30:  How many was in your family?

A.31:  Uh, we have, uh, I had five, uh, four brothers and one sister, and then on
my wife's side of the family she had, uh, four sisters and, uh, a brother --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and so we're kind of from large families, and then they're all married,
and all have their children, and they come.  And, uh, so, it's, it's really
quite a get together.  We've been doing this, uh, up in Idaho in the summer in
the camp out for, uh, we're, thirty-nine years, every summer we've done this,
and we do it the second week in July --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- between the Fourth of July and the twenty-fourth of July, which is a
holiday here in Utah.

B.36:  What's the holiday?

A.37:  It's, uh, when the pioneers came into Utah and settled, uh, Utah, Brigham
Young came in on the twenty-fourth of July --

B.38:  Oh.

A.39:  -- and when they came across, they came from the east in the covered wagons
and, uh, set-, or started the settlement of Salt Lake City.

B.40:  Is there a special, uh, type of festivities for that --

A.41:  Yeah, uh --

B.42:  -- occasion, too?

A.43:  -- they have, uh, we have, uh, a large parade in Salt Lake City.  It's
probably the, one of the biggest parades in the country.

B.44:  Um.

A.45:  It goes for about three or four hours, and, uh, of course, uh, it's a state
holiday, and so we, uh, we have ours between that, and, uh, the week between
those, the fourth and twenty-fourth and, so every year we know,
