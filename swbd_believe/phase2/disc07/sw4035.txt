A.1:  How do you feel about capital punishment?

@B.2:  Um, I'm, I'm definitely against it --

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  -- definitely against it.

A.5:  For what reasons?

B.6:  Uh, I think that they make a lo-, the system makes a lot of mistakes, and a
lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes, and it's bad enough
when, um, you know, when it's not capital punishment, but when it's capital
punishment, when you find out later it's too late.

A.7:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I, I agree that, you know, capital punishment is
bad but just more for the econ-, for economic reasons, because I, I don't
think it acts as a deterrent, and I don't think that, um, and, and, and like
what I've read, it costs a lot more to actually, you know, go through the
process of condemning someone and killing them, than it does to actually just
feed for the en-, end, you know.

B.8:  Yeah, probably because, because of, uh, [smack] the legal system that we
have now, and I'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted, I don't think
you should --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the
appeals and as a matter of fact I think they are starting to cut back on some
of them at the supreme court.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Um, I forgot what area it is, but regarding, uh, capital punishment, there
are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the supreme court when
they used to be --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep
on arguing the case over and over again, uh, while they're waiting for capital
punishment, which is what happened, uh, which happens a lot.  A friend of
mine, uh, does that type of work down in, uh, down in Tennessee.  He's, #he's
an attorney# --

A.15:  #Is he prose-,#

B.16:  -- he represents people on death row.

A.17:  He's, he's for the defendant, okay.

B.18:  Yeah, yeah.  And I did criminal defense work for a while, so I kind of have
a, a, um --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- [Smack] could say I'm cynical about the system and the way --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- people are convicted of crimes, not that I think, I do believe that most
people are charged with crimes and convic-, certainly people that are
convicted of crimes, most of them are probably guilty anyway --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- I mean, I'm not denying that, but there are a few that #probably
aren't.#

A.25:  #Yeah it's, uh,# I mean I've, you know, I've seen people that, you know,
definitely got screwed by the system --

B.26:  Yeah so.

A.27:  -- (( )).  Yeah, um, is, do they have the death penalty in New York?

B.28:  No, huh-uh.  Um, they do in Georgia, right?

A.29:  Yeah, they do.

B.30:  Yeah.  They.

A.31:  Um, yeah, I'm not sure how often we, how often this actually, it seems like
about once a year they execute someone.  I don't really keep, [laughter] you
know, I only keep up after, when the last one was.

B.32:  Right  [laughter].  Well, that's the thing, I mean, I happened to have been
talking to somebody at, at, uh, work today about that.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Just happened to come up in conversation, and so I was surprised when I got
this topic come up, and, uh, the, the bottom line was that, uh, what was I
saying, uh, nobody in Tennessee has been con-, has been executed since
nineteen, uh, sev-, uh, what, seventy-three or whenever it was that they ruled
that the death penalty was #cruel and un-,# --

A.35:  #Constitutional.#

B.36:  -- yeah, and whether it was unconstitutional, and then like I said they
came back, and, um, like the nineteen eighties, and determined that if they
have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty, they call them
bifricated trials --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- um, they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going
to give the death penalty or not --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- um, then, then that's okay.  They can, it becomes constitutional, I
guess it's like a procedural protection that, that people have.  Um, but
nobody's been, nobody's been executed since they've brought that back --

A.41:  In Tennessee?

B.42:  -- yeah, in Tennessee.  So it puts a lot of pressure on them [laughter].

A.43:  One thing that I've always, that I've, one idea that I've heard that, that,
that I've, you know, kind of had some sympathy for is, though, that, you know,
when you have someone that's, you know, that, that, that's, you know, that you
are going to be stuck, is going to be stuck with life imprisonment, you know,
or two hundred and fifty years, you know, none of it served, you know, at the
same time, that, you know, to give them the choice of having the death
penalty.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  It seems, you know, if you lock him away for the rest of his life, you
know.

B.46:  Yeah, but it's kind of like, under, under duress anyway but, you know,
kind of saying to someone, all right, now that we've got you by the chops
because you decide whether you're going to die or not.

A.47:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

B.48:  But, but yeah, that's what that guy Gary Gilmore did, right?

A.49:  Uh-huh, yeah, he, he told us his, yeah, he said that he wanted to die at
that point.

B.50:  Right, and they, you know, kind of chose his way to death, which is kind of
interesting, but, um, yeah, I, I personally think people have the right to die
if they want, so, yeah, if you're in ja-, if you're in jail for life, then you
should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- which is basically what that is but,

A.53:  You know, it really bothers me that in historical cases where, you know,
someone tries to kill themselves in prison, you know, on death row, and, you
know, where they've actually, you know, spent, you know, thousands of dollars
reviving them, you know, just to kill them [laughter].

B.54:  Yeah, sure.

A.55:  And it always so, it seemed to be some sort of.

B.56:  I did some, I did some environmental law as well, and, and one of the, I
remember in studying something about the F D A --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- they, was it, what the hell were they trying to do, they were trying to
get a, a, a drug, it was a drug that they were using for the death penalty --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and they --

A.61:  Oh, like in Texas?

B.62:  -- right, they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve
it [laughter].
