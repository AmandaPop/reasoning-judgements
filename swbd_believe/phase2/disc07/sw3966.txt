============================================================

A.1:  a tough one [laughter].

B.2:  Yes it is.  [laughter]

A.3:  Would you like to begin [laughter]?

@B.4:  I know.  Well, I, I believe in it.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  #Do you feel# --

B.6:  #I think.#

A.7:  -- like there should be any kinds of restrictions on when it's.

B.8:  Uh, yes, I do think that.

A.9:  Oh, I see.

B.10:  And I do think that, I believe in it wholeheartedly.  I really think that a
lot of crime, we have the criminal, you know, element is just unreal.  I work
in a high school here --

A.11:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and it just boggles my mind what's happened over the last few years, ((
)).

A.13:  Really?  Do you mean even with adolescents?

B.14:  I've been there fifteen, sixteen years --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and just watching the mentality of our teenagers and, and the tough
stuff that's going on now, you know.

A.17:  Do you feel that it should be applied to them as well, then --

B.18:  Uh --

A.19:  -- same kind of laws or,

B.20:  -- uh, well, I think that they sho-, tougher laws for the teenagers, yes I
do believe that, not --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- but not the, uh, capital punishment for them.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I really don't feel that, but I do feel tougher laws.  But someway, I feel,
they have to revise our criminal system.

A.25:  You think it's too lenient overall?  Yeah.

B.26:  Uh-huh, I really do, and I think that the, um, oh, rehab is terrible.  You
know, they put them in there and there's too, it's just because of numbers.
Well, I understand --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- the rehab is so big they can't.  But anyway, back to capital punishment,
I do believe in it for murders --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and, and especially, um, oh, you know, [breathing] when they actually,
thinking about it.  Is that number one manslaughter, something like that?

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  I, I don't know, I'm not real sure.

A.33:  Premeditated, you mean, versus, uh.

B.34:  Premeditated, right --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- murder, definitely, of course.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  I do feel that, #and then the.#

A.39:  #At this# point most capital punishment is really, uh, related to murder,
though, right.  I mean there's no --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- capital punishment --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- unless a life has been lost?

B.44:  Right --

A.45:  (( )).

B.46:  -- right.  And, um.

A.47:  I wonder some-, I mean, I believe as you do that something needs to change,
but I wonder sometimes what, what makes an impact on criminals that do this
kind of a crime.  I mean it, it almost seems like they either don't believe
it'll ever be them that's caught, or if they do, they don't really value their
lives enough to care --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- if they would lose their lives.

B.50:  That's true.

A.51:  It's, it's, I, I'm not even su-, I feel, uh, in between, I guess.  I, I'm
not sure --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- that I have a strong commitment either direction because I don't know
enough about what would motivate these people, [laughter] you know.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  I do think that they are sometimes, um, put in a rehabilitation program
when there's really a very small chance of rehabilitation, that --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- that they're coddled for too long --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and they get the kind of courtesies of our society that --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- that the homeless would love [laughter] to have, you know.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  Something's wrong here.

B.64:  Yes, that's right.  That's for sure.

A.65:  But, it's a tough one.

B.66:  Well, and sometimes the, uh, on the rehab, I just, from being around the
students (( )) around, they know how to talk to the authorities.  They know
exactly what to say to anybody in a,

A.67:  In, in what respect?

B.68:  Uh, they know the right answers, #like,#

A.69:  #Like# what's within their legal rights --

B.70:  Right --

A.71:  -- or do you mean --

B.72:  -- what's, well, what's --

A.73:  -- #how to manipulate them.#

B.74:  -- #within their legal rights# and how to manipulate them --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- and how to manipulate them just, just they, they answer to authority and
to people, to adults and that type of thing, that they have to answer to, or
even the criminals do in, to the people that count, the judges and that type
of thing.  You know, they, they usually answer to them --

A.77:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.78:  -- in a way, that, like I said, manipulative.  They just manipulate,
they've manipulated so long.

A.79:  So they feign --

B.80:  #So this is.#

A.81:  -- #for example,# that they really are --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- um, apologetic or whatever for their #crime, but they're# --

B.84:  #Right, and for,# right.

A.85:  -- #but, but, you know they aren't.#

B.86:  #Very sorrowful,# and then when they get out, then we run into the problem
of --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- getting right back into a routine again --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- of the same thing.

A.91:  I'm sure that's easily learned.

B.92:  So.

A.93:  If they don't get it from their peers they get it from going through the
system one time --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- being in juvenile court or whatever.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  Do you know if there's much of a difference between the law, I'm, I'm
embarrassed to say, I don't know, between Texas and California, what --

B.98:  I really don't --

A.99:  -- what difference is there.

B.100:  -- myself, I really don't.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  I know they permit it here --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- but I don't know, you know, the difference in --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- actually.  In fact, we just had, um, a person put to death, oh, about
three weeks ago it was, in, in Texas, and I forget for the reason now.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Oh, it was for the, uh, that clergy that he murdered.  He murdered a, uh,
a, uh, it was a priest, I believe, he --

A.109:  Oh, my.

B.110:  -- murdered.

A.111:  Uh-huh.  It is interesting to look at other cultures, other countries and
see how different their rates are.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  You know, you look at even, um, countries like Saudi Arabia, where there's
a lot of emotion and sometimes a,
