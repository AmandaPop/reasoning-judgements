============================================================================

A.1:  Have you recently bought a car, Eric or,

@B.2:  Well, I didn't buy one.  I just changed jo-, changed jobs and got a work
car --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- or a company car, and, uh, they bought me a Pontiac Grand Prix and #I've
been# --

A.5:  #That's a nice# car, isn't it?

B.6:  -- yeah, I've been pretty happy with it.  I, I've been driving just a
little, little Honda, the Honda Civic --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and stuff, so it's a bigger car, but I've been pretty pleased with it,
you know, I, uh, it was, it's, you know, got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff,
but, I, golly, it's been nice so far, I can't say that it's, put it through
all the loops.

A.9:  Can you use it for personal, too?

B.10:  Yeah, I can use it for personal and,

A.11:  So, so, you, buying a car to you, right at this point anyway, isn't a, a
big deal.

B.12:  No, not really.  I, I've al-, we, my other, we have a second car --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and it's getting a little bit old.  It's an eighty-five Honda Civic, and
so we're thinking in a year or two we might have to, but, uh, you know, I, I
kind of, I just like to keep up.  I, you know, don't, uh, don't plan on buying
one, like I say, for a year or two, but sooner or later I'm going to have to
--

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- do it.

A.17:  We, we just bought, two years ago we just bought a, [child_yelling] a
Plymouth Voyager --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and it's been great.  We've got a, a family of five, three kids --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and that's the only way to travel as far #as I'm concerned.#

B.22:  #Oh, I bet.#

A.23:  The kids can get up and move around, and you can get them things.

B.24:  Now is that a, is that a full size van or,

A.25:  It, it's not.  It's a, it's a minivan.

B.26:  Minivan.

A.27:  Uh, and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports of things.

B.28:  Oh, was it?  You, do, so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a
car then or,

A.29:  I do.

B.30:  Do you?

A.31:  I do and,

B.32:  You find that works out pretty good for you?

A.33:  Yeah, we've only bought two new cars.  I bought a Nissan Sentra --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- that, um, and I really liked it, too.  

B.36:  #Did you?#

A.37:  #Didn't# have any problems with it.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And this one has been, been an exceptional vehicle.  We've really enjoyed
it, #especially for kids.#

B.40:  #Well, that's good to hear.# Yeah, that's good to hear, some good news
about some American made cars.  I --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I, uh, I (( )) believe they're getting better, and, you know, I, I, I
looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff, and --

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  -- they seem to be a really nice car and,

A.45:  Well, actually my philosophy about, I mean, if I was going to buy something
for me like a car I'd drive around [laughter], unfortunately I'd still get a
foreign car.  I think that Honda makes, uh --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- like you've got, the Accords are very, very well built.  

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  I also really like the Toyota Camrys --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- but they're just not practical if you have kids.

B.52:  Yeah, that's true.

A.53:  You can't, um, well, if they get older, I guess, you can take four or five
--

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- people, but when they're small, you got to get up and crawl over the
seat --

B.56:  Oh, yeah #what we found# --

A.57:  -- #you know, which doesn't work.#

B.58:  -- just even going down to our inlaws overnight, uh, uh, this little Honda
Civic, there's just not enough room.  We, I've just got one daughter --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- by the time you put the carseat and a couple of bags, I mean, we're
just, you know, we, we, uh, we were having that problem, that why, there's
just not enough room, those small cars --

A.61:  Yep.

B.62:  -- any more, we couldn't go camping, because we couldn't put a tent and a
cooler in it, you know, it was so small.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  But, uh.

A.65:  And, uh, Chrysler's started doing some nice things with their, with their
warranties and things.  I've got a seven year, seventy thousand mile warranty
on the drive train --

B.66:  Oh, really?

A.67:  -- yeah, and a three year, thirty-six thousand mile on the, I think it's a
pr-, that's pretty well bumper to bumper.

B.68:  Oh, really?

A.69:  But the drive train is seven, seventy, and that's --

B.70:  Yeah, that's.

A.71:  -- I think that's one of the, well, I kind of think that the other
manufacturers are now, uh, bumping it up to meet it, #but# --

B.72:  #Yeah.#

A.73:  -- Chrysler was the first #to do that.#

B.74:  #They've had that# for a while, yeah.  Well, it says something, they're
willing at least put something behind it, you know, they're, they feel like
turning out a good product and they're at least.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Yeah that warranty stuff, that's, uh, I did have to take this company car
in and, the cassette jammed all of a sudden, and it was nice to know that, you
know, that war-, it was still under its warranty, and they just took it and
took care of it right on the spot, but that's definitely something I think I'd
shop for.  I'd want as much warranty as I could, because --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- it's expensive to get the things fixed --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- any more if it's not covered.

A.81:  And I'm thinking about getting a used car with my next one, trying to see
if I can't take some of the #depreciation# --

B.82:  #(( )).#

A.83:  -- off.  I don't know.  They're still danged expensive, you know, I'd, you
only, I only --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  They, they don't go down much --

B.88:  No they don't, you know, they,

A.89:  -- you know, unless they're a couple years old or something.

B.90:  Yeah, if you get something that's one or two years old, uh, you can usually
knock, I, I worked at a bank as a loan officer, and so I could, you know, I
got into that a little bit, you know the dealership financing and stuff, but
--

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- you know, at, two years makes a huge difference.  You know, they say,
and it's pretty much true, that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a
thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value, and the
Hondas and some of those, they don't depreciate as much --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- but you can still get them a little bit cheaper.

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  I tell you, it's kind of scary, uh, we bought our company car through an
auction, a dealer auction --

A.97:  Yes.

B.98:  -- and the dealers, they, they get those things for about half of what they
sell them.

A.99:  You're kidding me.

B.100:  I couldn't believe it.  I, uh, we stickered, the car I got, this Grand
Prix, was stickered at, uh, sixteen thousand, it was a ninety-one and had, had
ten thousand miles on it, but we ended up getting it for about ten, and, I
mean, they bought it for ten, they'll sell it for sixteen, seventeen thousand.

A.101:  Um.

B.102:  I could not believe it, had just.  If you know somebody, that's the way to
go, but unfortunately, only the dealers can get in [laughter].

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  But, uh.

A.105:  Huh.

B.106:  I tell you, I, I've been real happy with the Hondas.  Actually we had a,
have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord, too.
