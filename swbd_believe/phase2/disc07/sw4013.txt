============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so you have eight children.  Um, what type of things do you do as a
family to spend time together.

@B.2:  Oh, we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, bicycling, uh, going to the
park, um, some time watching V C R --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- movies --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- um, generally cheap things [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh.  [laughter] Yeah, we know how that goes.  Uh, with lots of kids you
don't have lots of money for recreation.

B.8:  That's right.

A.9:  Well, that's fun.  So, um, let's see, uh, some of the things we do together
as a family, we like to play games a lot, and you may think this is funny, but
one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek, and
[laughter] we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- in our house, and that is so fun.  The kids just get a crack out of
that.  Um, we like, we do like to go to the park, too you, uh, like your
family.  Um, we don't do a lot of vacationing.  Have you taken a lot of
vacations together or,

B.12:  Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa. 

A.13:  Uh-huh, and whe-,

B.14:  We get an occasional one or two day thing --

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  -- but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.

A.17:  Oh, now where do they live?

B.18:  In Arizona.

A.19:  Oh, so that's a bit of a drive for you there.

B.20:  Yes.

A.21:  Oh, so you like to go there for the holidays and.

B.22:  Oh, we don't go very often for holidays.  Generally we try to get all of
our kids back home for the holidays --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us.

A.25:  Oh, uh-huh.  Uh, what are the ages of your kids then?

B.26:  They range from twenty-four to five.

A.27:  Oh, yeah.  So you have some in the nest and some out, #huh.#

B.28:  #That's right.#

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  How old are your children?

A.31:  We have, ours start at twelve and then they go down to four.

B.32:  I think the hardest thing for us has been, is to find ac-, you know,
leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together --

A.33:  I bet, yeah.

B.34:  -- with the age span that we have, you know, like the older kids love
playing board games and that kind of thing --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but the young kids don't understand it --

A.37:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that, and.

A.39:  Yes, and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level, then
the older kids get real bored, and they want to do something else.  So.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  Yeah, I can, I can relate to that.  Um, do you feel that the current trend
in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one?

B.42:  I think it's improving, actually.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  We had an interesting experience the other day.  We, we have pretty much a,
a routine that we spend, we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday
--

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- and we just kind of keep them at home --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and our next door neighbor, uh, we were at a soccer game Saturday, and
our next door neighbor was there, and somebody came up and asked if their
daughter could spend Saturday night at their house --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and she said, no, Sunday's our family day [laughter] --

A.51:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.52:  -- and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them.

A.53:  That's good.

B.54:  And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right
now.

A.55:  Oh, good.

B.56:  I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all
different direction --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids
now.

A.59:  I think so, and I feel like, you know, like President Bush, Bush has
mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler
nation, and it does begin with the families at home --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- and so I, I'm a firm believer in that, too.

B.62:  I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how
things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.
So.

A.63:  Yes, that's, that's true.  Well, we see that a lot out here in Utah, and,
um, hopefully, hopefully it's going to spread, huh.  (( )).

B.64:  Utah's a lot better [laughter] than Texas.

A.65:  [Laughter] Oh.  Um, do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas,
or.

B.66:  Very few.

A.67:  Very few.  You feel like you're in the minority?

B.68:  Oh, definitely.

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't
have good sense.

A.71:  Oh, dear [laughter].

B.72:  But, uh.

A.73:  Well, out here in Utah, five is about the --

B.74:  Average.

A.75:  -- the average, yeah.

B.76:  My wife and I were in Utah until --

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  -- I guess we were about twenty-four.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  Never been back, since then, but,

A.81:  Oh.

B.82:  We have kids up there now, so we get up occasionally.

A.83:  Oh.  Oh, I have some relatives out there in Texas, in fact my mom's out
there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on
their ranch, and.

B.84:  Where, where in Dallas?

A.85:  Well, uh, no, I'm trying, Aberdeen?

B.86:  Huh.

A.87:  Is, is that close to Dallas?

B.88:  I don't have any idea.  I've never --

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  -- heard of it.  Must be a --

A.91:  Don't you.

B.92:  -- little town.

A.93:  It's, I guess it's out there, clear out.  They have a ranch that has like
five hundred acres, and,

B.94:  Yeah.
