===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, how do you feel about it?  [laughter].

@B.2:  Well, I feel like the major problem we have, and the reason that crime has
gotten so out of hand, is because there isn't a punishment that's matching
what's being done.

A.3:  I agree with that.

B.4:  And I think it starts when the kids are little.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as
they can get away with something, that it's all right, because I don't see a
lot of parents, especially where I'm at, I have a lot of the responsibility of
whatever is done in our neighborhood, because there's no other mothers at
home.

A.7:  Yes, I have the same thing here.

B.8:  And I see a lot of kids, very small kids, coming home to empty homes every
day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things, and as long as they don't let
anybody know about it, they get away with it.  So, you know, I feel like, if
our mothers stayed home, if we had that secure start, you know, where kids
learned the right way to act, um, they were rewarded for their good behavior,
and they had a secure family that they came from, I think we'd see a whole
different society.

A.9:  Yeah, that kind of goes right along with what I'm thinking, too, is, all
the movies and the T V, the violence and all the things that are on there, if
the parents were home in the afternoon when the children came home, maybe they
wouldn't be watching as much of this.

B.10:  That's right.

A.11:  But then again, there's some of them at home at night with them that do not
monitor what their children are watching, and so it's [breathing] yeah, I
think you're right in that it is parents caring --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- enough to maybe put off having that other car or the other T V or
whatever it is they're working for --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- and take care of the children.

B.16:  Well, you know, I did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to
work --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and --

A.19:  What'd you find out?  [laughter].

B.20:  -- I found out that more than eighty percent of all the people I talked to,
the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when
I,

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  talked with their children, their children wanted their parents home rather
than the, the material things they were getting.

A.23:  Yes, I, I can believe that.

B.24:  And it's just too bad that the parents won't listen to this survey.  So, I
just think that, um, another problem is, I think the way the legal system has
been set up, that the criminals get out, and the jails are so overcrowded they
can't handle --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- punishing the people that are committing the bad crimes sufficiently.  I
think they need to put more people out, to death, um, if it's completely
witnessed and it's, uh, seen that there's no, you know --

A.27:  #Uh-huh.#

B.28:  -- #I think# there needs to be more severe punishment --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- but it needs to be fair.

A.31:  Right, but, and, maybe not quite so much publicity, either --

B.32:  Right, I think that.

A.33:  -- I think there's far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes
that, and then it seems to become a challenge #to be showing people# --

B.34:  #To, oh, outdo it.#

A.35:  -- to see if they can get away with it.

B.36:  Yeah, or outdo what's been done.

A.37:  Right, that it's.

B.38:  Yeah, I think that's another problem.  Um, I know that once when I was
reading a book, when I was studying history, and it said, you show me a
country that can produce strong families, and you'll have a strong country.
And if you look back over United States history, our country was strong until
the mothers started leaving the home.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  The women's rights and #all these# --

B.40:  #That's right.#

A.41:  -- good things [laughter].

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  The children are the ones who suffer.

B.44:  That's right, and they do, and then they grow up and it just continually
will get worse.

A.45:  Yes, and.

B.46:  So, I guess what we --

A.47:  And.

B.48:  -- both agree on is that families need to change --

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  -- their way of thinking [laughter].

A.51:  Yes, and until the families change, I think that we'll continue to have
this problem, and it will worsen.

B.52:  Right.  And I think people need to have some sort of a, an idea of why
we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards, and why it's
important to do these things, rather than just getting ahead
materialistically.

A.53:  Yes, uh-huh, uh, back to the --

B.54:  So.

A.55:  -- old basic morals and,

B.56:  That's right [laughter].

A.57:  [Laughter] and things that.

@@B.58:  Well, um, do they come, do they come on and say when we've talked,
visited for five minutes?

A.59:  I, I don't know, I, I thought they did.

B.60:  This is your first time?

A.61:  This is my first time also, hello, but.

B.62:  Um, we discussed, I discussed on here with someone, um, last week about the
justice system and how it could be improved on, juries.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  We discussed about how half the jury that they select to, you know, come up
with the verdict, if half of those were law students, then they could
understand what was going on in the court room, and have the time that they
spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours.

A.65:  Hey, that would be a good idea.

B.66:  Wouldn't that be a good idea?

A.67:  (( )).

B.68:  So, I think, though, sometimes the juries don't understand all that the
legal, you know, talk and, and what's going on --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable,
at least half of them, to be on the board, or on the jury,

A.71:  That,
