A.1:   I'm ready [laughter].  

B.2:   Why don't you go ahead and start off [laughter].  

@A.3:   Okay, well, I don't have an elderly person that I could send
to a, a nursing home or anything.  My, both of my parents are dead,
but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home, uh, like
a nursing home and I h-, went there very often to visit her and,
uh, [lipsmack] made me feel really sad.  If I did have a mother
living, I don't think I could do that.  

B.4:   [Door].

A.5:   I think they would be better off being at home with their
family, you know.  

B.6:   I agree, although, we're in that situation right now.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   We have a, an eighty seven year old mother in law living with
me right now -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- and because of her circumstances she can no longer live
independently.  And even moving from her house to our house -- 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- has been tremendously unsettling for her and we have
several young children -- 

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   -- and they about drive her crazy.  

A.15:   Oh, I can believe that.  Yes, because most elderly people
can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things
like that.  In a situation like that maybe it would be better.  

B.16:   Well, we've, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because,
again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing
to me.  

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   And she's still alert enough that I think she would really
know that we were putting her there -- 

A.19:   Oh, yeah.  

B.20:   -- and I think she would really resent it, and I think that
would make it very hard.  

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   But, on the other hand, I see my wife with, I guess our
youngest one now is five -- 

A.23:   Oh. 

B.24:   -- and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot
take care of herself.  She needs to be -- 

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   -- bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of -- 

A.27:   Oh -- 

B.28:   -- things.  

A.29:   -- see, now that's, that's, that's really a sad situation.  

B.30:   And so the drain on the family.  

A.31:   Yeah, really, you know.  

B.32:   And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always
saying, you know, why do they have to be here, why can't they send
them home, it's too noisy and -- 

A.33:   Uh-huh.  

B.34:   -- she'll say that to the kids' friends.  

A.35:   Yeah, right, right.  

B.36:   So it's a hard situation, either way, I think.  

A.37:   Yeah, in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it
would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your
family growing up where,

B.38:   I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with. 
When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you
have to consider that -- 

A.39:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.40:   -- as opposed to considering her current circumstances and,

A.41:   Uh-huh, but the cost of these nursing homes are so,

B.42:   Oh, prohibitive.  

A.43:   You know, a lot of people can't afford that.   

B.44:   Yeah.  

A.45:   You know, so you really have no choice that way if you, you
know, if you're not rich or s-, you know.  Uh, I know this lady
that, you know, that was a friend of mine, now her husband was
still alive at the time when she was in there, you know, and it was
costing him a small fortune to keep her in there.  

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   So,   

B.48:   I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day
care -- 

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   -- that's more readily available, you know, I think if we
could send her someplace for the day -- 

A.51:   Yeah, then bring her back home at night.  

B.52:   -- and she could be around some elderly people and have some
activities would be of more interest to her -- 

A.53:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.54:   -- and then in the evening have her return and be with the
family.  

A.55:   Yeah, you know, just come home for dinner and then usually
they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow.  

B.56:   Yeah.  

A.57:   You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get
something like that but,

B.58:   But there's not many of those available right now -- 

A.59:   Yeah.  

B.60:   -- and they're very hard to get them into and -- 

A.61:   Uh-huh.  

B.62:   -- we tried sending her to a senior citizen center.  

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's
somewhat senile.  

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she
can't participate in.  

A.67:   Uh-huh, uh-huh, um.  

B.68:   But I think it's an issue that, you know, with the graying of
America, we're really going to have to, as a, as a country figure
out how we're going to deal with this.  

A.69:   Uh-huh.  

B.70:   Because it is a difficult situation and, you know, you hate
seeing them just, sort of send off and not well cared for.  

A.71:   Yeah, if --

B.72:   And yet,

A.73:   -- if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going
on around them and everything like that, well, I can see, maybe a
nursing home would be better, you know.  

B.74:   [Door]. 

A.75:   But if they, they have their wits about them and everything,
why, it's kind of hard [laughter].  

B.76:   And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too,
you know, if they could be up and doing some things -- 

A.77:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.78:   -- it might be better than when they're just sort of needing
almost constant supervision and care.  

A.79:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, uh, my mother always said she hopes she
never had to be like that and, uh, luckily, I mean, she lived by
herself and then, you know, one day she had a heart attack and she
was gone, so she never did have to go into a nursing home or
anything like that, but there's, so many of us kids, there was like
seven of us that, [breathing] my, we wouldn't have probably allowed
that to happen anyhow.  

B.80:   Yeah.  

A.81:   You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of
us, you know, for a sh-, a sh-, a period of time because we all
don't live in the same city anyhow, o-, nor the same state so,

B.82:   Do you live at all close to each other?  

A.83:   Uh, I, I have a couple more that live out here in California,
but then I have a broth-,
