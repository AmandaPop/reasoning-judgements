============================================================================

A.1:  Well, we, our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East.  What do
you, what do you think?

B.2:  Well, yeah.  I, uh, and I'm, I'm sure there's things going on that, that,
uh, we don't know about, but, but, uh, it, a year, a year ago now, when the,
the war, Desert Storm was finishing up, seems like things were, uh, going to
settle down, and nothing seems to --

A.3:  Yeah [laughter].

B.4:  -- nothing seems to have settled down after all.

A.5:  That, that happens a lot, doesn't it.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Wars don't usually settle things [laughter] --

B.8:  Yeah --

A.9:  -- much.

B.10:  -- right.

A.11:  Um, um, and I, I guess I, I feel like we, we keep getting into places
without really understanding what we're doing --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- which really, I find upsetting, because it seems like we've got experts
and we've got people who understand these cultures, but I always wonder if
they're really used, because it seems like then afterwards we have people
explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such we wouldn't have done
this, you know --

B.14:  Yeah --

A.15:  -- and would.

B.16:  -- and, and I think there's a, yeah, I have very much doubt that, that
there's a real understanding at the top levels of, of the, of the cultures and
of what's going on --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- in terms of, and, and, it seems to me that our policy basically seems to
be, uh, the army of my enemy is my friend --

A.19:  Yes [laughter].

B.20:  -- and that, that Saddam Hussein was, uh, was our buddy, buddy as long as
he was against Iran --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, Iran was our bigger enemy, and then --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- when it turns out that, uh, Saddam Hussein.

A.25:  But Iran, of course, used to be our friend.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  I mean we can't --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- it's a little hard to keep it straight, isn't it?

B.32:  Oh yes --

A.33:  Oh.

B.34:  -- yes, and when we decided Saddam Hussein was our enemy then the, uh, uh,
oh what's his name in, uh, Syria --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- uh, Hafaia Susaad I believe --

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  -- uh, is suddenly our friend, even though he was, he was on our --

A.39:  On our --

B.40:  -- our leading terrorist --

A.41:  -- really bad list.

B.42:  -- yeah, our leading terrorist list.  So, uh, you know.

A.43:  And I, I, I keep reading about Jordan's King Hussein, and I just feel so
sorry for him, sort of in the middle of all of this --

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  -- trying to keep some sort of sanity, living vulnerable, right where he
is.

B.46:  Right, right, and, and, uh, I think we're trying to, we're trying to
extricate ourselves somewhat from being so definitely tied to, to the Israeli
side --

A.47:  Yes --

B.48:  -- in terms of --

A.49:  -- yes --

B.50:  -- all of that, Israeli --

A.51:  -- right --

B.52:  -- versus Arab.

A.53:  -- right.

B.54:  And, uh, I haven't seen, solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good
job of that.

A.55:  Of doing that either, no.

B.56:  Yeah, yeah.  So.

A.57:  No, I, I, I, I just get a sense of our walking in, over and over and over
again in places where we weren't well versed --

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  -- or something.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  Didn't, didn't know what we were doing so, I mean, it just feels unprepared
or --

B.62:  Right and,

A.63:  -- something, and, and if we could, it's not wise.  I guess I'm still
looking for a statesman.

B.64:  Yes.

A.65:  You know, someone who really, the, the, the kind of stories you hear about
or you look back in history, these people really understood what they're doing
and did this wise thing every once in a while, and I just keep thinking, I
know there, with all the resources we have, there must be people who could
have explained some of this, and said if you do this subtle thing,
understanding their culture et cetera, et cetera, it'll have this effect but,

B.66:  Yeah, well, it, it from what, yeah.  From what little I heard in terms,
the, the, the most understanding, [laughter] to get really cynical about it,
the most understanding, uh, I, uh, felt that was displayed in terms of, of,
uh, Iraq in particular, was that it seemed to me that George Bush was, was
trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that, that he was guaranteeing
that given their culture, that Saddam Hussein could not back down, and would
not, could not do anything but go to war.

A.67:  Oh, absolutely, yes.

B.68:  And that, uh,

A.69:  Oh, which was, uh, in the line of business that I'm in, which is mediation
[laughter].

B.70:  #Uh, oh boy.#

A.71:  #Every, absolutely,# everything he did, I mean, I was in the classrooms
teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single
thing we did was against every principle I was teaching, it was like, um.

B.72:  Oh, that must have been, that, yes --

A.73:  Yes.

B.74:  -- that must have been really (( )).

A.75:  It was emotionally quite difficult --

B.76:  Yes.

A.77:  -- to say the least, because it's sort of like, golly gee, this is a set up
for absolutely the worst chance possible [laughter] --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- what are, what are we doing here?  You back someone in the corner, is it
too surprising if they come out fighting?

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  I mean --

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  -- didn't you ever see that with children, I mean --

B.84:  Yes.

A.85:  -- [Laughter] (( )).

B.86:  Yes.

A.87:  I, I did see one of the peace rallies where they just said, [laughter] I
can't remember the exact thing, it was something like, George and Sad-,
Saddam, go home.
