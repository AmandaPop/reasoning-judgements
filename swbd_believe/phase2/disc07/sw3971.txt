B.1:  All right.

A.2:  Okay, so what do you think of the Giants?

B.3:  Uh, I like the Giants.  They got, uh, I probably didn't get into baseball
until maybe, maybe three years ago really --

A.4:  Yeah.

B.5:  -- so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants.  I don't, I don't know why.  I
really got into them.  I read, uh, Dave Dreveki's book --

A.6:  Oh, yeah.

B.7:  -- his autobiography --

A.8:  Yeah --

B.9:  -- and,

A.10:  -- wasn't that something of him.

B.11:  Yeah, that, that was incredible.

A.12:  Yeah, that's really a, really proud of him though, the way he's, you know.

B.13:  The way he handled that #entire situation, there.#

A.14:  #Yeah, really,# you know.

B.15:  But, I just think the Giants have a good team.  They, they got all, you
know, they're, they're, they're real balanced out.  They got real good
pitching, and they got the hitting to go along with it.  So.

A.16:  Yeah, I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top --

B.17:  Yeah, they just --

A.18:  -- you know.

B.19:  -- they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push
them over the top, you know.  I don't really know what it is, but, but every
team that's, that's really good seems, you know, like the A -s had, they had,
they just had it all that one year.  So.

A.20:  Yeah, um I was mostly an A -s fan, you know.  I had been to more games at
the A -s than I have in the Giants --

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  -- because, uh, I lived in Oakland --

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  -- you know, for some time.  But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you
know [laughter].

B.25:  Yeah, if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, #you know,
you# --

A.26:  #Yeah, right.#

B.27:  -- good and the bad but.  It's, it's kind of hard.  I still, basically,
the, the, me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere, I
mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams, but since, no-, me, none
of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams, so
#we, uh# --

A.28:  #Uh-huh.#

B.29:  -- about, about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on
Nintendo.  We play R B I baseball on Nintendo so.

A.30:  Yeah, right, right.

B.31:  So that's just, you know, that's small town trying to make it through the
--

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- not being around it really, but.

A.34:  Yeah, right.  Well, I prefer ba-, uh, football --

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  -- over baseball, but, uh.

B.37:  Yeah, so do I, but baseball is still --

A.38:  Yeah, it's.

B.39:  -- you got, you got to do something when football ain't on.  So
[laughter],

A.40:  So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie.  Huh.

B.41:  Yeah, exactly.

A.42:  [Laughter].

B.43:  This is America, so.

A.44:  Yeah, #um.#

B.45:  #But.#

A.46:  So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?

B.47:  Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say.  I haven't really, really, you have to
just keep up with everything in the off- season.  It's kind of hard to do, at
least, #you know,# --

A.48:  #I know.#

B.49:  -- you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep
up with who they traded and who they picked up and, and all that, but, like I
say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I
think the Giants can do it.

A.50:  Yeah, #well, the Giants are.#

B.51:  #They just, I don't,# yeah I don't really know about the A - s.  I don't
like the A -s, uh, matter of fact I can't stand the Oakland A -s [laughter].

A.52:  [Laughter].

B.53:  Just because they have, uh, you know, they've got their Jose Canseco and,
and all the attitude that goes along with that, you know.  #They kind of.#

A.54:  #Yeah,# makes you sick, doesn't it?

B.55:  Yeah.

A.56:  [Laughter].

B.57:  You hear what, you hear what, you hear what he did.

A.58:  [Laughter] Yes.

B.59:  He ramming his wife's car, and I was like, yeah.

A.60:  He's like a little bitty kid, huh.

B.61:  Yeah, he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money.  So.

A.62:  Yeah [laughter].

B.63:  That's just, you know, but.

A.64:  Yeah, well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it
sounds like.

B.65:  Yeah, I've heard, I've heard talk about that.

A.66:  You know, uh, they won't be that far away, but San Francisco will be
hurting, anyhow.

B.67:  Yeah, they're not going to be happy about it.

A.68:  You know.

B.69:  But I hope they can do good.  I mean, that's just, I think they're a good
team.  That just need that one, one little thing to push them over.  I don't
know exactly what it is.  They got, they're pretty balanced out all the way
through.  It just might be the drive, you know --

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  -- more than anything else, they just, they probably just need something to
push them --

A.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.73:  -- because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them
back, is the ambition to do it.  Or somebody basically, maybe they just need
everybody to tell them they can't do it.  Maybe that's what, you know, that's
what some teams need.  Look at the Twins going from worst to first.

A.74:  I know, isn't that something --

B.75:  Yeah, my roommate --

A.76:  -- I couldn't believe that, huh.

B.77:  -- my roommate's a Twins fan, for forever, so, he had his year this year,
so.

A.78:  Yeah, I just, it.

B.79:  We got pre-, we, we got into that a whole bunch.

A.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.81:  That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure.

A.82:  Uh-huh.

B.83:  So I saw all seven games of that, so.

A.84:  Uh-huh.

B.85:  That was definitely worth watching.

A.86:  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't believe that, you know.

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  I don't, uh, there was Braves in that chanting that they had.  That would
drive you up a wall.

B.89:  [Laughter]  Yeah they,

A.90:  [Laughter].

B.91:  every team with the Indians been doing that now.

A.92:  [Laughter]  You know.

B.93:  I can't figure out why.  You have to figure out why they're all doing that,
I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, you
know --

A.94:  Yeah, well, you're right [laughter].

B.95:  -- the Braves, Braves didn't win, so, uh, why keep on doing something that
didn't work, but --

A.96:  Yeah, yeah.

B.97:  -- I don't know.

A.98:  Yeah.

@@B.99:  I was, I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball,
and I get a woman's voice.  I was,

A.100:  [Laughter].

B.101:  I was, I was thinking, uh-huh, I talked to a guy named Vinny last night
about fixing your car, so.

A.102:  Oh, really?

B.103:  Yeah, I got, I called, got a call the other night about, uh, fixing your
automobile up, so.

A.104:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.105:  Well, baseball's baseball.

A.106:  Yeah, right.

B.107:  It's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick, do you pick the
topic or does the computer?

A.108:  No, uh, they give you a list of things that you want,
