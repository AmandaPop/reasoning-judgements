===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, do you have any recycling going on in your community?

@B.2:  Uh, yes we do. We've started out with, uh, all the waste haulers have, uh,
been authorized, or commanded, I'll put it that way, to pick up, uh, lots of
different kinds of waste --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and they, uh, uh, the result has been that they have increased their
rates by about three times, uh --

A.5:  Wow.

B.6:  -- and, uh, so, now you have all kinds of, of, uh, things they didn't use
to pick up, like magazines and, uh, various forms of, of, uh, glass --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- tin, and things like that.  Uh.

A.9:  So they used to pick this stuff up, but just throw it away but,

B.10:  Well, no, in, a long time ago, you didn't, they didn't pick up any of that.

A.11:  Oh, really.

B.12:  And then, uh, they started to pick up a few things, but lately they've gone
in to it in a big way and they've said the, uh, they have to pick up, I think
it's, uh, plastic and glass, well plastic and magazines, which, uh, in the
past nobody picked up.

A.13:  It's my impression that, uh, it's rare to find someone who will recycle
magazines, the glossy magazines.

B.14:  Yes.

A.15:  Yes.  Uh, and then they charge you for the service.

B.16:  Yes, well now these, so they're, we're being charged because the rates
have, the trash, uh, pickup rates have gone up, uh, like I say, almost by a
factor of three #for some people.#

A.17:  #Uh-huh.# Was this something that was voted on, or, uh --

B.18:  Uh.

A.19:  -- by the City Council or something?

B.20:  The City Council did it.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  They decided that there was, Portland is kind of a ecology minded #area# --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- and so they, uh, although there're some complaints because the, there
were volunteer agencies that would do it, uh, at a minimal charge, and a lot
of the articles in the papers, or the letters in the papers these days have
suggested that the waste haulers, now that they have a monopoly, uh --

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  -- uh --

A.27:  They charge for it --

B.28:  -- they charge --

A.29:  -- whether you take advantage of it or not.

B.30:  -- much more exorbitant rates than the, uh, than the volunteer, you pay to
have your magazines recycled, that kind of thing.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  In the past they said, well, we, we were paying far less to have our
magazines recycled than we do now --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- because the waste hauling, uh, uh, companies have a monopoly now --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- so they can, you know, it's the old thing about, uh, now that I have to
do it, they can, they don't have to work very hard at keeping costs down.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  So, how about your area?

A.39:  Well, we have, uh, some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here.
Uh, in our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a
week, and, uh, picks up recyclables.  They do not pick up magazines, uh, and I
believe they don't pick up the plastic.  I think it's the two categories you
talked about.  It's just newspapers, bottles, cans, and, uh, cardboard.  And
it used to be free for a few weeks, then they sent out little flyers saying,
hey we still want to do this for free, but we're not quite making ends meet
and we'll take donations, and I, I'm, I don't, not sure if anybody really sent
the donations in to this private company just to be nice.  And I believe
they're going to start charging now, uh, and I sus-, I'm not sure what we're
going to do.  I mean, it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to
put out, so it may work out monetarily okay for us to be charged for it.  Uh,
and since they are private, if they charge too much, they'll, people will just
start throwing it in the trash.

B.40:  Of course, around here, we, we have to pay for our trash pick up.

A.41:  Right, we pay for our trash pickup, but this isn't the trash people.

B.42:  Oh, I see what you're saying.

A.43:  This is another, this is, uh, um, Carl, Carl's recycling, and, uh, he comes
around with a truck of his own, so it's completely, uh, private and
nonmandatory, and people just put things out on the curb.  Um, he's competing
with some, uh, very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about
an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables.
So, it's, uh.

B.44:  The thing that, that, uh, another thing that's been in the press here has
been that, uh, with the volume of recyclables --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- coming in, the, the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for
the, uh, how should I say it, the market can't absorb all the, uh,

A.47:  Yes, yes, I've heard that, that yeah, it's, uh, they have all this used
newsprint that people don't want, right.

B.48:  Right, and certain kinds of glass, uh, the green glass has no market.  It's
piling up.  I don't know where they get green glass.  I guess they get it from,
