==============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, it's nice to talk with you.  Um, I, I guess I'll go ahead and
start off with, uh, I think that there's two things that could be done that
are procedural to, uh, to help the budget.  The first I believe in would be to
give the President a line item veto, um.

B.2:  I agree with that  [laughter].

A.3:  Uh, I think that a lot of times the, the members of Congress, uh, when
they're faced with, uh, the possibility of having to, to cut jobs in their
district by, because of shutting down a federal project or something, just
don't have the, the will [laughter] power on their own to, um, to make the
tough decisions, and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the
President who, who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can,
uh, I guess, be a little bit more insulated from, from, uh, #the concerns of
one, of one district.#

B.4:  #Local politics, yeah.# Well, also, too often, too, the, uh, individual
congressman has the, uh, especially if they are on, on some of the committees
that put these budgets together, have the opportunity to slide things in that
normally should not have gone in at all, #and the, right# --

A.5:  #Yeah, that's exactly right.#

B.6:  -- and the line item, uh, veto would be ideal for that, (( ))

A.7:  Yeah, one of the, uh, there's a bill pending before Congress which, I'm
trying to remember what it's called.  It's something like the pork buster bill --

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  -- that, um, if approved would make it, uh, uh, you wouldn't be able to, um,
put in, um, new projects and things in a conference committee or at any time
where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility
for that, and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things
in at the last minute, and the conference committee is really the worst place
for that to happen, uh, because no one, uh, uh, has, uh --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the
conference committee.  It just goes back to the house and the senate for a
final up or down vote on the whole thing.

B.12:  There's another i-, uh, uh, another, uh, way where the budget could, uh,
probably benefit, and this has to do, of course, it has to do with federal
projects.  Too often those are, uh, not, uh, there's no, uh, accountability
once the, uh, projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done.  And
they end up getting stuck with billions of dollars of overlay, or if contracts
are put out, uh, no one, uh, is responsible, or it does not seem to be, for
following up that if it goes over budget, it, well, you know, it's set up
laissez faire attitude, well that's to be expected.  We just sort of built it
in.  Well that shouldn't happen that way.  And I think --

A.13:  I agree.

B.14:  -- I think if there was more attention paid to, uh, what's being, uh, spent
and more accountability, that would help enormous-, enormously, too.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  How, who, who or how that would come about I'm not, uh, sure, but that's an
ar-, an area that needs to be, uh, looked at.

A.17:  Yeah, it, it really sometimes seems that there is, there's nobody out
there, uh, watching out for, uh, for we the people and making sure that the
money is spent wisely.  Uh, and I don't know.  That just sort of seems to be
unfortunately part of the, just how the system, uh, operates now.  Um, we-,
gee is there anything specific that you think, uh, uh, in the way of federal
programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending?

B.18:  Well I think there could be a lot of consolidation of programs.  Uh,
looking at, of course, there, they have been a lot of talk to begin with, and
the military's a big, uh, area that, uh, has taken a lot of shots recently.
But I, I do not see the point of having four different services.  Uh, I do not
see why they could not have one military service.

A.19:  And just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy.

B.20:  That's right, because a lot of the monies are spent, uh, with insiding
within those departments.

A.21:  How do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the
far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves?

B.22:  Uh, basically, I'm in, I'm in agreement with that.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  Uh, I would think that there probably needs to be a monitor, not a monitor,
uh, #(( )) you know.#

A.25:  #Well, we'll always have a presence there, but we don't# --

B.26:  Yeah, a presence, but not a.

A.27:  -- we don't need to have half a million troops --

B.28:  No.

A.29:  -- overseas.

B.30:  Well, witness the, the recent Gulf war, too.  Even with, uh, troops all
over Europe, uh, it took several months to gear up.

A.31:  That's right.

B.32:  And so what was the point of having them to begin with.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, another area that's, that I really think ought to be cut is,
is direct, uh, foreign aid,
