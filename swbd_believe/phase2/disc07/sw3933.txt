conversation.

=========================================================================

A.1:  That type proposal.  

B.2:  Well, actually I've, I, you know, it kind of caught me by surprise.  I
haven't ever really thought about, uh, you know, mandatory public service.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  I, obviously believe in public service, and, you know, think it's a good
idea.  I, I'm not sure if they would get the service they anticipate if they
force it.  Do you understand what I'm saying?

A.5:  That's a good,

B.6:  I mean,

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  You know, you're going to get a lot --

A.9:  Good point.

B.10:  -- more commitment, a lot more desire, a lot more, uh, maybe quality time,
effort, energy from somebody who really, truly wants to be there.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  So, although I believe in it, I'm not sure requiring it would be the way to
go.

A.13:  You know what I've noticed, at least in ou-, in my field that, that works
is to require before a person can enter the school program that they do a
number of volunteer hours in that field --

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- or in, in an environment that's related to that field and that might be
more motivating, uh, in relation to what you just mentioned.

B.16:  That's true.  

A.17:  #If it were somehow of interest to them.#

B.18:  #If there were enough opportunities.#  

A.19:  I suppose, uh, that would really require a lot of participation on the part
of employers to require a certain number of c-, uh, community service hours in
their area [laughter].  #That's,#

B.20:  #Well that,# or, have something available in that field, you know --

A.21:  ((Uh-huh)).

B.22:  -- and, and when you go to employers, then, is it really a public service
thing or more of an internship.

A.23:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.24:  You know, I don't know.  

A.25:  I really like the idea of young people getting a chance to, to do something
of a volunteer nature, maybe in another country, but that, that's difficult
for a lot of people, I guess financially to, to manage.  But it would
certainly, I think, contribute to a person's responsibility and, and sense of
maturity, uh, to recognize what other cultures and other countries go through
in terms of their day-to-day existence.  If you're working in Peace Corps, for
example, you're really going to be able to learn those things.

B.26:  I, I definitely agree and I, I had, you know, some family that did serve in
the Peace Corps and I, I always thought it was a wonderful thing.  Uh, I, I do
think that if people have the opportunity to do it, it's something that, you
know, they won't forget.  It enriches your life --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- and gives you, like you said, a, a good understanding of, oh, well, what
do I want to say, we take so much, we take what we have for granted.

A.29:  Yeah, we really,    

B.30:  You know, we're very blessed in this country -- 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- and, and we take so much for granted because we really don't realize,
uh, how other cultures and other, other countries live.

A.33:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.34:  So I, I definitely agree that it's, it's good.  I just, you know, I, I, to,
to require it, I think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you
want to get the type of service, you know, that you're anticipating --

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- that you're hoping for.  

A.37:  It's a little challenging today, too, to think about being in another
country where there's, uh, potentially political or --

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  -- military problems that are going to effect Peace Corps workers to
persons volunteering, it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal
danger where, where they might be, but if you're [laughter] expecting that
they have to do it, then --

B.40:  That's true.  

A.41:  -- y-, you, you perhaps, the, wh-, uh, whoever the organization is
requiring it does assume some responsibility, too.

B.42:  That's true.  And then I guess I can look around, you know, I,
automatically when the, uh, switchboard suggested Peace Corps, I, kind of like
you, I thought international or going out of the country and I, I look around,
though, and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within
our own communities --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- and our own, you know, a lot of times people say, I don't want to go
somewhere else, I want to help my own community --

A.45:  Yes.  

B.46:  -- you know, United Way, I want my dollars to work here -- 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- something like that so that might also be a motivating factor, then.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  I, I think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community
services and I really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are
just, uh, uh, paying, if you want to call it that, for minor offenses --

B.50:  Minor offenses, yeah.  

A.51:  -- having them do something, you know, in the community.  

B.52:  I agree, I think that's a very good idea.  What, you said the field you're
in, what field are you in?

A.53:  I, I'm --

B.54:  Does it app-,

A.55:  -- an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that, uh, I know
this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy, there's so
many people who are applying to the schools right now that they require that
you do X number of volunteer hours, I think it's a hundred or so --

B.56:  Okay.   

A.57:  -- before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a
therapist.

B.58:  So you have to do it in that field, actually.  Like if you -- 

A.59:  I believe you do. 

B.60:  -- like,   

A.61:  Yeah, you have to volunteer in a department that, that provides
occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the, the area you're
pursuing.  I'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do
that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very
good idea of what it is to be an O T or a P T and --

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  -- having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and
recognize, well, this is really what I want to do.  I want to spend three or
four years getting this experience [laughter].

B.64:  That's true.  Well, and it might also make them realize, too, this isn't
what I thought it was --

A.65:  Exactly.  

B.66:  -- and I don't want to do this.  

A.67:  Exactly.  

B.68:  That's a good idea.  

A.69:  Which is, which is definitely the case,
