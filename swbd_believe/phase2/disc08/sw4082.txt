===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I get most of my news uh, from newspapers really.  I read the daily
newspaper, uh, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE and sometimes I'll read like the, uh, WALL
STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES.  I don't subscribe to either, but sometimes I
get a hold of copies of it.  Uh, how about you?  Do you, uh, mostly --

@B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  -- get things from T V or (( )).

B.4:  I actually get most of my news coverage off uh, computer networks.
However, I do also watch television news, uh, usually in the morning once a day
and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL --

A.5:  Oh.

B.6:  -- most every day.

A.7:  Oh that's interesting.  You said computer networks.  Uh, what, uh, what
sort.  #I am fairly knowledgeable of (( )) {very faint}.#

B.8:  #Uh well, well DOW JONES for example have the, cause the# -- 

A.9:  Uh, okay.  That's interesting.

B.10:  -- uh, news wire and it's picked up and actually available, uh, at my
office, so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure and
it's sort of by category.  For example --

A.11:  Oh.  I-, [noise] --

B.12:  -- so I can read a certain business or topics.

A.13:  -- is it,

B.14:  [Inhaling].

A.15:  is it the A P news wire or is it something that is, uh, a little bit
different from that?

B.16:  Well, uh, it's similar to that, but it's DOW JONES, [noise] which is, uh,
the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire.

A.17:  Uh, okay.  So, that's that's interesting.  Okay.  Yeah, I've had, I had
access in the past to, uh, [noise] uh, the A P news wire and I thought that was
that was pretty a pretty good way to get news.  Uh, I've never used the DOW
JONES news wire but, uh, yeah it, uh, do you get any, uh, do you read any news
magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long
term analytical sort of approach?

B.18:  Uh, well actually not.  Uh, I do, uh, follow, uh, uh, uh, I don't know how
to how to describe it [noise] so I'll say a religious newspaper which, which
talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense.  It's a
weekly --

A.19:  Yeah [noise].

B.20:  -- but, uh, but not, uh, not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of
those kinds of things.  I'd like to say that however, uh, that I'm
overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news
wires [noise].

A.21:  In what way?  In like, in sort of like, uh, qual-, uh, quality or sort of
an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented
or whatever?

B.22:  [Inhaling] Uh, I think that it, I think that it has to do with, uh, I
personally think, uh, I, I have a problem with their viewpoint and I personally
think that, uh, ther-, --

A.23:  #Yeah. Well you won't offend me.  So go ahead and say [laughter].# 

B.24:  -- #that there's a strong bia-, there's a strong bias# in the media.

A.25:  Yeah.  Like a liberal type of bias.

B.26:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Uh, after all, who, who writes.  People who are
journalist who are trained to write and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a
liberal field --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- at least from academia and, uh, the other thing that I always notice is
that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their
descriptions to be wrong --

A.29:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.30:  -- and it,

A.31:  They, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least. {sounds 
like}.  

B.32:  That's right.  Well, even if it's not technical.  If it's, uh, some social
thing or whatever.  It doesn't matter.  If I am an expert in it, they usually
make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it.  They're
telling me lies.

A.33:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you, by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes or
do you think they are deliberate sorts of things?

B.34:  Uh, I think both.  Uh, by deliberate I, uh, I mean mistake, mistakes of
omission or, uh, [noise] or, uh, biased toward a particular view point --

A.35:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.36:  -- a particular liberal --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- view point that they have.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  So, uh, uh, to give you an example, uh, we will go out of the printing
media.  I know of cases where, uh, we have one television media where they will
show [noise] clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the
the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the
same thing they are showing you.

A.41:  Huh.

B.42:  Which is sort of like a deliberate bias.

A.43:  Huh.  That's disturbing.

B.44:  Which is which is rather disturbing.  #I mean he does that.# 

A.45:  #I haven't# really noticed them doing that, but whatever, again I don't
watch T V news that much now.  If I had access to C N N, I would watch T V
news more.  Uh, I don't you know, but I don't usually.

B.46:  Yeah, I don't have access either.  Although, I did at one time and it was,
I did during the Gulf War [noise] and it was addictive.

A.47:  Yeah.  Did you, did you think that C N N, well, the Gulf War coverage would
be kind of, uh, an abnormality?  I just wonde-, I guess.  [noise] I would be
curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to
the three networks.  Uh, you know whether you thought it was more of a biased
or whatever but I, I guess you wouldn't.  You probably, if you just watched it
during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much.

B.48:  Yeah, well during that small sample, I would think that everyone was just
about, just about the same, except the three networks, (( )) radio television
programming.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  So, if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and greatest news
--

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- you could do that by, uh, turning on C N N and you,
