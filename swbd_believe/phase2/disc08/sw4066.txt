===========================================================================

A.1:  Well,

B.2:  Uh, just, just as I answered the phone, the, this voice came on the line
and said [throat_clearing] you were suppose to, you talk about capital
punishment, how does the law, what, how do the laws in the different states
compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or
something --

A.3:  Yeah --

B.4:  -- like that.

A.5:  -- uh-huh.

B.6:  I honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is.  Do
you know for Texas?

@A.7:  Well, I know we're kind of beefing it up now.  [inhaling] Uh, the past
year or so, the people that are on death row and have been for years and years
and years, they're beginning to go on and executed them now.  We have the, uh,
lethal {mispronounced} injections, lethal injection.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And, uh, it's going to take at least [inhaling] all ready this year, three
have been put to death.  And I think at this point, I am for that, as long as
--

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- you know, they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and
this, I don't see why they should have to, and why we should have to support
them for twenty or thirty years [inhaling] on death row.  That once they have
been sentenced by a jury of their peers, found guilty and then gone through the
appeal bit then [noise] why continue [inhaling] [cough]?

B.12:  Yeah, I, I, I strongly agree.  I think, uh, well in general I think we
have, we have a fairly lax legal system.  As far as protecting the criminal.

A.13:  That's right.

B.14:  And, uh, I can see the necessity of it but, uh, I don't know, if someone's
guilty, and there's there's no quite if, if there, and there is no question
about it, [noise] a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there, and
there, the jury finds them guilt, then, in everyone's mind it's not actually
settled.

A.15:  Right.  I can agree with that.  That it's,

B.16:  So, I can, I can see letting, uh, letting for example the judge make the
call or, or maybe an appeals court make the call [noise] and on this, it was
this not just beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  And so under circumstances where it's, you know, where there is no question
about it, the person actually did kill somebody, and in particularly,
particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent, where they've
killed several people,

A.19:  Yes.

B.20:  Yeah, I, I totally agree.  I, I think it's kind of appalling that some one
can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it.

A.21:  Yes.  Well, I know of, uh, at least two this year that have been put to
death have, uh, I mean they have already, they had admitted to it.  They, I
mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty
years there on death row.

B.22:  Is that right?

A.23:  And --

B.24:  Oh, wow.

A.25:  -- uh, I think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this.  That
it just [laughter],

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  oh wow.  We do everything else fast [laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter] That's probably why this is Texas is one of the topics because
Texas Instruments is in Texas.  And so,

A.29:  Right [laughter].

B.30:  It's in the news.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  It's not really in the news much up here.  I guess it was the Dahlmer
case that that was in the news everywhere.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Now where was that at?

A.35:  Uh, [inhaling].  I think that was in Houston.

B.36:  So it was in Texas too?

A.37:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.38:  That's what I thought.

A.39:  I believe so and, uh, I know we're going through a case right now that, uh,
where parent's starved a child to death [inhaling]. And, uh, I've heard you
know people wondering whether, you know, should these people get the death
penalty or not.  Uh, I, I guess I would feel strongly [inhaling] about that,
when it involves a child, especially --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- they, they tied this child. [laughter] The police found the child tied
and starved and, uh, there's no doubt, a case like that, there's no doubt in my
mind that these people ought to get the death penalty that, uh, they did it,
they did it knowingly.

B.42:  I guess that would be, that would be the issue.  Did they just tie the
child and and and were they punishing the kid and they --

A.43:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.44:  -- didn't realize [noise] that he was going to die or [noise] oh they did.

A.45:  Oh, they the [noise] were just punishing.  They didn't think far enough
ahead I don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they
would get caught.  They had two of them.

B.46:  Well, see that's, I think I would think that differently.  They had two of
them?

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Two children.

A.49:  Two children.  One did not die.

B.50:  One didn't, huh.  Yeah, in that case, I think that you could argue that I
don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids.

A.51:  Well #could be,#

B.52:  #That would,# that would seem like that that I would have a harder time
saying the death penalty was in order for that.

A.53:  Well, I don't think I would [laughter] but, uh,

B.54:  Well, no, I certainly think punishment is in order, but the death penalty,
because that's, I am not sure that is homicide because they didn't, I, I, it
certainly wasn't intentional homicide.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  Well, you may have a point there.  I, [inhaling] it's just that, I
guess they have gotten so much publicity here, but, and I have read so much
about it and [inhaling] --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- [Laughter]  I, ju-, it just upsets me.

B.58:  That is, that is a tough one.

A.59:  But other than that, uh, you know, I just,
