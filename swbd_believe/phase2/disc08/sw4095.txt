when you were in, uh, high school or anything and,

B.34:  Oh yes.  I baby sat all the time for, uh, for, uh, my last year in high
school.  My full time job was going over to a neighbor's house and baby
sitting their children until they got home every day [inhaling].  And, uh
{very faint},

A.35:  [Inhaling] So what did you do with them?  Did you, I mean, of course, you
were paid to, uh, to spend time with them and stuff --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- but what did you do to,

B.38:  [Throat_clearing].

A.49:  Yeah, we, my kids, well my kids are of course now that it is getting
warmer, are much more outdoors #than# --

B.50:  #Right.#

A.51:  -- than indoors, but shoot they can sit and work puzzles and read books for
[laughter] a long time.

B.52:  Right.  Right.

A.53:  Uh, so it's kind of, and they did, they pretty much, they entertain
themselves when I need them to but --

B.54:  Well that's nice {very faint}.

A.55:  -- I spend a lot, I spend a lot of time with them reading and we play games
and stuff but,

B.56:  Well that's good.

A.57:  Yeah, uh, it's, it's neat cause they are really, they're well behaved kids
and they're and they, they interact pretty well with adults --

[laughter],

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  than it is on him, but you know, [laughter] it's like, oh, I can't send my
baby to school [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  It's just it, it's like, I can't believe I, you know, yo-, he'll be five in
July --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and it's just hard to believe that time has flown by so quick so.

B.74:  Oh yeah.

A.93:  Maybe in a couple of years,

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  I, you know, I might want to do that, but it's, I don't know.  I was glad
to have gotten out, so.

B.96:  Oh yeah, I will be too.

A.97:  Yeah, that was, uh, I enjoyed my time, but --

B.98:  Yeah.  Yeah {very faint}.

A.99:  -- you know.  Met my husband and met him there and so it was, uh, a nice,
nice side line of it so that was good --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- [Smack] but, uh, well what else about kids.  How do you think people
spend time with their kids?  Do you have any idea?

B.102:  Uh, not really.  My, uh, my parents are divorced and my father, uh, us
dating a woman who has a two year old boy and, uh --

A.103:  Kind of different, huh?

B.104:  -- yeah, it is --

easy,
