========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, why did your roommate get a dog?  

B.2:  I really don't know.  He kind of moved out entirely and, uh, was living
with his girlfriend in this apartment and they had gone ahead and gotten this
Rottweiler puppy and next thing I knew, well, he went ahead and kept, uh, the
room here, kept paying for it after he graduated and next thing I knew, they
had kicked the Rottweiler out, so he came back home with it [laughter].

A.3:  Oh.  

B.4:  We've got a big yard here and he can run around out there.  

A.5:  Oh, that's good.  

B.6:  But he's pretty rough, I'm getting a lot of scars on my hands,

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  and arms and stuff.  

A.9:  Well, is he teething?  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  It's, it's getting kind of rough, in fact, he'll even chew on your face if
you make the right kind of noise.

A.13:  Oh, yuck.  

B.14:  #[Laughter].# 

A.15:  #Oh, yuck.# Well, I have a, uh, I have a, well, I call her my, a puppy, but
she's actually going to ten and, uh, had her all ten years and she, she'll
rough house with you but she's, she's learned very quickly when enough is
enough.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  But she loves to play and stuff, but, I don't know, she's, she's, I'm
getting ready to, I'm fixing to move out and on my own --

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  -- and she's going with me and, I mean, that's, I, I'm thinking that she's
going to be one of my main sources of, of companionship in, in the beginning.

B.20:  Do you, uh, think about her as defensive kind of, maybe tool or something?

A.21:  You mean, a g-, as far as protec-, house protection?  

B.22:  Yeah, protecting you and the house.  

A.23:  Oh, no, no, no she had a stroke about two years ago.  She's blind.

B.24:  Uh.  

A.25:  So, no, no [laughter], she's strictly the loveable type.  

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  So [laughter], no, she's, she's too little to do that.  

B.28:  I live downtown and the neighborhood's pretty and I like the, uh, the idea
of having a, a good, mean, strong dog around.  We've had some in the past and
it's really paid off.

A.29:  So this is, this is not your first experience with o-, with a dog.

B.30:  No, we've had two other ones here at this house.  And the last one was,
well, the guy said it was half wolf, and it really had that look, yellow eyes.
It was very intelligent, but there was, man, if it got the chance, it wouldn't
leave anything alive in the area.

A.31:  Whoa.  

B.32:  Cats and squirrels and stuff like that.  I can remember going for a jog one
day with it and it got hold of a baby squirrel.

A.33:  Oh. 

B.34:  And, you know, there really wasn't a whole lot that could be done other
than let it go ahead and finish it off at that point.

A.35:  Um, um, well, uh, let's see, a lot of the, I don't know if you've, I've,
I've been, I've heard about a lot of studies and stuff and they said that, uh,
people that have pets have a lower incidence of, uh, heart disease and --

B.36:  Yeah -- 

A.37:  -- stuff like that.  

B.38:  -- I believe that, I believe it.  

A.39:  [Laughter] Yeah, you take out all your aggressions on the dog [laughter].

B.40:  [Laughter] And plus having something to care for and somebody that cares
for you.

A.41:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.42:  They're good companions absolutely.  

A.43:  It's a lot better than coming home to an empty house.  

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  So,   

B.46:  What do they call that, un-, uh, [lipsmack], uh, that kind of love where
there's just no expectations or anything like that.

A.47:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I, I know what you're talking about.  

B.48:  Totally un-, devoted.  

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  Totally devoted.  

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  Uh,   

A.53:  Totally.  I mean, because, I mean, they know no other, no other kind.

B.54:  Yeah, I used to have a chicken, I only had it for a few months though and
one of the dogs around here got a hold of it.

A.55:  A chicken?  

B.56:  And see the, when I moved in here the neighbors had chickens and even
though this is downtown, they had a rooster over there and it woke me up every
morning a little bit after sunrise and my uncle found this chicken in his
neighborhood and one night when it roosted nearby he went ahead and grabbed it
and asked if I wanted it and brought it on over.  Ethel, a little black
bantam.

A.57:  Ethel, that's cute.  

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  Did, did she do, uh, I mean did you, did you, did she lay eggs and stuff?

B.60:  Uh, she didn't hang around long enough.  

A.61:  Oh. 

B.62:  Tried trimming her wings, but she kept getting out.

A.63:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  

B.64:  I'm not really sure what happened to her.  

A.65:  Go-, yeah, the chicken that got loose in the city [laughter]. 

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  So,   

B.68:  We had a cat recently, too, but it decided that it just didn't like staying
inside all the time.  It kept wanting out, so I'd go ahead and let it out --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- and it got till it got more and more feral.  

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  And next thing I knew, man, it had gotten till it really smelled of the
outside.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  It had found some horrible smell that it liked and when it would come in,
you couldn't, couldn't stand being near it, and one day it went ahead and
marked the couches in the living room.

A.75:  [Snorting].

B.76:  At that point I went ahead and banished it and that was it, no more cat.

A.77:  Well, is, is, is your Rottweiler mainly an indoor dog or an outdoor dog.

B.78:  Well, we're trying to get her to be more and more of an outdoor dog.  Right
now she's indoors.  She's still a puppy and needs a lot of social interaction.

A.79:  Right.  

B.80:  So, you come home and she's dying to come in, barks at night, howls,
lonely.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  So we go ahead and let her in.  

A.83:  Uh-huh, well, and that's, it was, I know, growing up, I had, I had several
dogs that were outside and Pooh Bear is inside, is an inside dog.

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  But, and, and I found that it's so much easier to socialize with her
because she's inside and I can do other things with her there, whereas I don't
have to go outside to play with her, you know what I'm saying?

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  So I think it's, I don't know, I,
