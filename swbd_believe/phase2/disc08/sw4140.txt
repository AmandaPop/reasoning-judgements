REMARKS:        Each side of the dialogue was extremely long.

===========================================================================

A.1:  From the, from the scale of one to ten, I, I lean more towards no
restriction.  We, by the constitution, we have the, the right to bear arms and
I believe our freedoms are being constantly eroded all the time and President
Bush just signed a law that, that banned lot of automatic weapons and, and
such where they wouldn't do any more damage than some Winchester rifles or
things like that.

B.2:  [Baby_crying].

A.3:  What do you think about that?  

B.4:  Well, I pretty much agree with you.  Uh, I wouldn't say that I'm a ten
because I do think that there are some types of weapons that should be
restricted because of their extreme potential to, uh, [throat_clearing]
[baby_crying] uh, to produce collateral damage, if you know what I mean.  I
don't think that people should have nuclear weapons in their homes or, or
biological weapons, but I'm probably, uh, on a scale of ten, I'm a, I'm a nine
in that I think that any, any arm that can easily be carried by hand should
certainly be, uh, protected for individuals to own and, uh, to use.
[child_laughing] Uh, in particular, I'll express my opinion on this, uh, this,
there's some people that think that the second amendment is, you know, only a
collective right, that it applies to the militia.  I don't believe that, I
think it, it applies to individuals.  Uh, also, uh, I don't think that the,
our founding fathers had anything in mind, anything to do with hunting or even
defense against criminals or, or target shooting.  What they had in mind was
that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from
[child_yelling] the government becoming too strong and taking away our
liberties.

A.5:  Well, that's a, that's a, that's a good point.  [inhaling] Also, we have
to, we have to be c-, cognizant that our society's becoming more and more
haves and have nots and the main, the main purpose, say, for the police is to
keep the have nots from taking from the haves, and that is the purposes o-, of
the gun control.

B.6:  Well, the thing with the police is that they're only good to pick up the
pieces after the crime has happened.  We have to, to take precautions to
defend ourselves.  Uh, if someone comes after you with a gun, there's no way
that the police are going to stop them, uh, even if have an opportunity to
call the police, uh, because someone has threatened you, they won't come out
and protect you.  All they can do is investigate a crime after it's been
committed.  It's very rare that they prevent one, so it's important that we
each as individuals have [baby_crying] the means to protect ourselves and in
this day and age, that means having guns [baby_crying].

A.7:  Oh, I, I, I agree.  I, my point was that the police want to get rid, rid of
the people of, of guns and what's happening is that I, see, I, I view this
country as, as, as we have peoples and societies and cultures and things that
are be o-, that are oppressed, and so that, to, to take the way the, those
weapons so they can protect themselves is, that's what the means and that's
what they're trying to do and by enacting all this legislation.

B.8:  I, I agree with you.  I think that, uh, although to, to a large degree,
what the, the politicians are doing is just responding or reflecting what the
electorate seems to be telling them.  The problem is, of course, is that the
majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and
bear arms means or what it's for and all they see is rampant crime in the
streets and they think that banning guns is going to stop that, but that's,
that's simply not the case.  Uh, you take away the guns, uh, from law-abiding
people and, uh, I mean, it, it seems like a trite phrase, but, i-, if guns are
outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.

A.9:  That's true.  

B.10:  They're not --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- going to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from, from getting, uh,
guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of,
of crime.

A.13:  Well, you know, I, another perspective is that, the people in this country
I'll just, for, not, lack of a better word, I'll say they're spoiled.

B.14:  [Child_talking] {faint}.

A.15:  They haven't been, except for the immigrants that have come to this
country, they're not cognizant of war and, and chaos and terrorism like
Lebanon or countries that have been invaded, and if our country needs, if our
country's invaded, we need the people to, to rise.  I mean, the, the military
and the police isn't going to do it all for us.  And i-, and if we don't have
the, the g-,
