=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, you want to tell me about the weather [laughter]?

B.2:  [Laughter] Well, I think we know about the weather.

A.3:  That's right.

@B.4:  Had a lot of rain this year, though.

A.5:  Yeah, that's true.  Lot of records, I think.

B.6:  Yeah, I know it.  I just don't know what winter's going to be like.

A.7:  Oh, hasn't been bad so far.

B.8:  No, it hasn't.  But, I mean, we're due for a, a big one, here.  We haven't
had a big, big winter in a long time.

A.9:  Well, yeah, I guess not [noise].  Well, how about somewhere else.  You been
somewhere else lately?

B.10:  Somewhere else.  

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  Well, I was in Florida here recently.  

A.13:  And what was the weather like there?

B.14:  Great [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  It was fantastic.

A.17:  [Laughter] You want to go back, right.

B.18:  Sure, I wouldn't mind going back.

A.19:  Did it rain every day?  It usually rains every day there.

B.20:  No, it didn't.

A.21:  Really?

B.22:  Really didn't.  

A.23:  Huh.

B.24:  They got maybe sprinkled maybe once.  

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  I remember that's about it.

A.27:  Did you go to, uh, what is it, Disney World?

B.28:  No, I was down there on business --

A.29:  Oh.

B.30:  -- but we were right across the street from it.

A.31:  Oh, really, and you didn't get to go, huh.

B.32:  Yeah, I never went.

A.33:  Have you been there before?

B.34:  No, never have.

A.35:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.36:  My,

A.37:  Have you been to the one in California?

B.38:  No, my kids were, to the one in, uh, out in California.

A.39:  Gosh, you have to go [laughter].

B.40:  I know [laughter].

A.41:  It's just one of those things you have to see, you know.

B.42:  That's what I heard.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Think we're straying off the weather, though.

A.45:  Yeah [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  Um.  Well, we can't go very far with this subject.

B.48:  I know.  Um, what kind of winter, winter are we going to have this year.

A.49:  Oh, I don't know.  Hopefully not too bad, well bad enough so it kills all
the fleas and bugs and whatever.

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  We have to have a freeze for probably a week.  But aside from that, I hope
it's still warm.  Not too co-, maybe, maybe, well, maybe a little snow on
Christmas Eve or something would be nice.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  But it doesn't look good.

B.54:  They were saying that the freeze last winter, did you see, I don't know if
you saw on T V about the, uh, the migration, uh, not the migration, but all
the crickets that they had this year --

A.55:  Oh, yeah.

B.56:  -- did you see it.  They were saying, they were saying that was caused from
a very mild winter --

A.57:  Oh, it was amazing.

B.58:  -- that the winter didn't, that the winter did not kill all of the eggs --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- like it normally does. 

A.61:  Oh, yeah.

B.62:  But I was out [throat_clearing], I work out in Plano --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- at a restaurant out there, and they just, uh, I mean, the whole building
was covered with them.

A.65:  What restaurant is it?

B.66:  I Hop.

A.67:  Oh, okay, all right.  I work out in Plano, too.  I was just wondering if,
uh, you're near where I am.

B.68:  But, I mean, it, it was, it was, I couldn't, I couldn't believe all of
them.

A.69:  Yeah.  I remember going to work one day and just crunching on the stairs.

B.70:  Oh, unbelievable.

A.71:  It was terrible.

B.72:  We couldn't see our pa-, we couldn't see our parking lot.

A.73:  [Laughter].  

B.74:  Hey, I'm not, I'm not kidding.  We got pictures of it, we could not see our
parking lot.

A.75:  That's pretty bad for a restaurant, I guess.

B.76:  Yeah it is.

A.77:  Probably didn't have the business.

B.78:  Well, it didn't, well, it didn't hurt it, though, that's the bad thing.
Didn't hurt it.  They weren't on the inside, just on the outside of the
building, just hanging around.

A.79:  Huh, well, here we started to get some in the house now.  I wonder if it's
because it's getting cool out and they want to come in.

B.80:  Yeah, they want to, they go towards the heat.  

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  That's why, that's why they were coming out of the ground when it first
started getting cool.

A.83:  Yes.

B.84:  They came out of the ground because it was warmer.

A.85:  And into the house.

B.86:  Yeah, well, yeah, they like coming into the house, but they were going
crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm --

A.87:  Oh, huh.

B.88:  -- where the lights were and everything.

A.89:  Uh-huh, huh.

B.90:  But hopefully, uh, we'll have a nice hard winter and it'll kill them all
this year --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- because I don't want to put up with that again.

A.93:  I know, I know.  I mean it sounds cool to say, but, yeah, it was pretty.

B.94:  Uh, a bug's a bug.

A.95:  [Laughter] And we ended up spraying for them anyway after a while, I
think.

B.96:  Oh, we spent a couple of thousand dollars on getting the, getting the
restaurant sprayed --

A.97:  Yeah, I bet you do.

B.98:  -- and everything.  

A.99:  Huh.  You probably have to do that a lot of times during the year, don't
you?

B.100:  Oh, yeah, well, we get, we spray monthly --

A.101:  Oh, oh.

B.102:  -- just as, just as a maintenance --

A.103:  Huh.

B.104:  -- but, uh, I mean, this was like every other day he was coming out there
with his, he normally doesn't spray with a truck.  But he was having to come
out there with a big truck and, uh, just douse the, douse the grass and
everything else.

A.105:  Wow.  Yeah, I guess you'd have to.  You don't want bugs in there [laughter]
--

B.106:  Oh, I know it.

A.107:  -- that's for sure.  Um.

B.108:  And I'm, I'm ready for a little snow though --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- got to have a little bit, couple of days anyway.  

A.111:  Yeah, it'd be nice,

B.112:  Maybe shut, shut down, shut down work, 

A.113:  [Laughter].

B.114:  but I doubt it.  Maybe I can stay home a few days and play in the snow
with the kids.

A.115:  Yeah, that would be nice.

B.116:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  I don't know about anybody else.

A.119:  [Laughter]  Well, as long as I don't have to drive in it.

B.120:  Oh, I know.

A.121:  That's, that's the lousy part.

B.122:  Yeah, I know, and Texans don't know how to drive in it anyway.

A.123:  Oh, well, I'm not from here, but, yeah, I never really did learn
[laughter].

@@B.124:  [Laughter]  Well, I don't know what else we can talk about the weather.

A.125:  I don't, probably nothing.

B.126:  Yeah, it's getting cool now.  I got a fire going, so I'm enjoying it.

A.127:  Oh, sounds good.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  Well, listen, I enjoyed talking to you.

B.130:  Enjoyed talking to you too.

A.131:  And, uh, I hope we get a better subject next time --

B.132:  I know it.

A.133:  -- or at least someone on the other side of the country so that you
[laughter] really can ask.

B.134:  Maybe if they're listening to th-, maybe if they, when they listen to this
maybe they can set that up a little better.

A.135:  Yeah, well, part is just whoever is around or has the right hours on their
sheet --

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  -- they can call, because it's getting hard to find people now.

B.138:  Oh, I know it.

A.139:  Takes a long time --

B.140:  That's true.

A.141:  -- and this was good, I mean, you were only the second one they called.

B.142:  Oh, really.
