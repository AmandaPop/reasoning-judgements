=======================================================================

A.1:  All right, now then, we should be ready to go with our conversation.

B.2:  All right.  

A.3:  What are your preferences?  

@B.4:  I think I tend to prefer ethnic restaurants rather than steak houses or,
uh, simply, American food or, or even the southwest food.  Uh, frequently, we
enjoy trying a, a new kind of a place and, to try to see what their style of
food is and what kind of spices and things they use it in.  So that's what me,
we mostly do.  What do you prefer when you go out?

A.5:  Oh, I've decided there's so many places in Dallas, I will not make too many
repeats and I thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods.

B.6:  Oh, you do?  

A.7:  Yes, certainly.  Course, I, perhaps would enjoy Tex-Mex and that's, uh, a
good Tex-Mex is awfully hard to beat.  Do you p-, do you care for that flavor?

B.8:  Oh, yes, really very much.  Uh, I think that the Tex-Mex food has become a
kind of a, a standard enjoyed food in our home and I've even learned to make
a, a few things at home myself and that's why I said,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  sometimes when we go out, I would, not because I don't like it, but
because we, we tend to like it and even have it at home.  I'd rather try
something else.

A.11:  I, I -- 

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- understand that.  

B.14:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.15:  Uh, but you don't care for the steaks.  

B.16:  I'm not a big steak or rib, uh, roast beef eater, although, to be honest
with you at holiday time, at Christmas, I always buy a, a standing prime rib
and make some Yorkshire pudding --

A.17:  Uh.

B.18:  -- and gravy and totally enjoy it.  

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  And then can table that for six months to eight months to another year.

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  So, uh, and you know, we're trying not to eat those, those big meats, also
with all of the health consciousness.  Uh, believe me, we're not fanatics in
that line, but, uh, if we enjoy other things, then, we'll, we'll tend to go
that way [lipsmack].  A nice Chinese once in a while is, is very tasty, and,
uh, we recently went to an Ethiopian restaurant and, uh, sampled that kind of
food.  Rather different.  But, uh, have you been to any place lately that you
enjoyed?

A.23:  Yes, I found a little place over in, uh, Preston Center tonight.  It's a,
called, oh, I don't have the matches now --

B.24:  Uh-huh {faint}.

A.25:  -- but it's a, it's a Cafe au France and they -- 

B.26:  Oh. 

A.27:  -- had the, it's a small place, but most delightful.  I had --

B.28:  Oh, my.   

A.29:  -- not been there before.  And then I found with a neighbor, oh, couple a,
about a month ago this, uh, Salvadorian.

B.30:  Oh. 

A.31:  And that is on Six Thirty-Five in a [breathing], I don't think it was Days'
Inn Motel, but this woman's son had been there two or three times and their
food is excellent.

B.32:  Is that right?  

A.33:  Except for their fried banana.  Now -- 

B.34:  Oh. 

A.35:  -- I do not care for that.  

B.36:  Oh, my, uh-huh.  

A.37:  But, uh, the, the other things, the seasonings were -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- so appeal-, [clicking].  

B.40:  Uh-huh {faint}.  

A.41:  Oh, wait, I have a c-, just second.  

B.42:  Okay, go ahead.  

A.43:  {Pause} I'm sorry.  

B.44:  That,

A.45:  [Clicking] I didn't know I'd have that one -- 

B.46:  Okay.  

A.47:  -- come in.  But anyway, that was, it was very good and very, very
reasonable.

B.48:  Oh, good.  

A.49:  Good service and the things that I look forward to, I mean, I want to be
waited on.  I don't want to go cafeteria style.

B.50:  Right, uh-huh.  

A.51:  I'd rather have them cater to me [laughter] when I'm,

B.52:  When you go out.  I,

A.53:  When I'm patronizing them [laughter].  

B.54:  Uh-huh, I don't blame you.  I, I think that's an important part of
relaxing, that you don't have to do the work yourself, uh-huh.

A.55:  The only time that I would go against that i-, would be the Sunday brunches
that --

B.56:  Oh. 

A.57:  -- many of the places have.  

B.58:  Do you have a preference to a place for Sunday brunch?  

A.59:  One that I have enjoyed, and had the privilege of eating there New Year's
Eve night was the Marriott on Six Thirty-Five at Coit.

B.60:  Oh, yes, I'm familiar with that, uh-huh.  

A.61:  Have you been there eat?  

B.62:  Well, I have not really been there to have the brunch.  

A.63:  Uh-huh, well, they had a buffet dinner which was very simil-,
