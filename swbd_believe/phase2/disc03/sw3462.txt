REMARKS:        Speaker B was extremely hard to listen to and to
understand.  His speech was slurred and his words ran together. 
Also, he was chewing or eating throughout the conversation.

=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  So, I guess you're a Cowboy fan.  

A.3:  Oh, yeah, I guess we're sort of, we're stuck with that down we're, Brad, we
have to be [laughter].

B.4:  That's true.  

A.5:  But, uh, been, it's been difficult suffering with them through the past few
years, but it looks like they could be, you know, on their way back a little
bit.

B.6:  Yeah, what's, what's the story with, uh, your quarterback, though?

A.7:  Our quarterback's hurt right now.  He's going to be out for a couple more
weeks at the very least and may miss the rest of the season.  Course, if
they're lucky enough to make the playoffs, he may be ready for them.

B.8:  Oh, that's good.  

A.9:  We're, we're fortunate to have a, you know, a, a fairly good back up
quarterback that's come in.  But, I tell you what, the people of Dallas, uh,
they love their Cowboys.  I'm a, I've been here since seventy-four and, uh,
they're quite easy to, easily to get attached to and, uh, we've got our new
coach now, Jimmy Johnson, which I, we, we like what he's doing.  They've
forgotten about Tom Landry [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.11:  He was a great coach in his day, but they've forgotten about him.

B.12:  Yeah, isn't, the Cowboys were the tradition now.  

A.13:  Oh, yeah.  So who's your favorite team?  

B.14:  Uh, well, it's kind of weird for me.  Tell you what, first of all, I used
to be a Jets fan when I grew up.

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  I grew up on Long Island where the Jets play.  Uh, I mean, they're in New
York City, but it's closer to Long Island --

A.17:  Sure.  

B.18:  -- uh, than the Giants which were up in the Bronx.  Uh, but then, around
eighty-five, the Giants started playing really good defense and they started,
you know, really, not that I'm a fair weather fan, but they really started
looking good, you know, so, now I root for both teams, Jets and the Giants.
But I'm involved, uh, in this rotisserie league.  I don't know if you're
familiar with those.

A.19:  No.  

B.20:  Well, you draft players from different teams, so it's kind of, you get
points based on how many, how many touch downs and, and, and stuff like that,
that players on all different teams, uh, make.

A.21:  Well, I'll be darned.  

B.22:  So, you get kind of caught up.  

A.23:  I'm sure. 

B.24:  Uh, [laughter] and now I got like, you know, players players on like
Buffalo and, and --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- Washington and, and, I, I happened to have your kicker and, uh, Michael
Ivan --

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  -- who's great.  He's a great wide receiver and, uh,  

A.29:  And how's your team doing [laughter]?  

B.30:  So, my team's doing pretty good.  

A.31:  Well, good.  

B.32:  For those guys.  I have, I do have a couple of Giants.  Uh, but, they're
not doing that much [laughter].  And, uh, I also have --

A.33:  They're having a sad year.

B.34:  -- one Jet, yeah.  They're not, they're not looking too good.  Uh, but, you
know, it's always tough after you win a Super Bowl, I guess.

A.35:  I know.  Maybe, maybe we're both teams of the future, huh.  

B.36:  Yeah, and they, they, uh, they, uh, I mean last year was just fantastic.
With the Giants winning the Super Bowl, it was just,

A.37:  Oh, it was, it was fantastic, that was a hell of a season.  

B.38:  Yeah, it was such a, I don't know, maybe because I'm a Giants fan, but,
but, uh, it was such a unbelievable run, you know, all the games were like won
by field goals --

A.39:  Oh, I know.  

B.40:  -- and stuff like that, so.  

A.41:  They had a great coach.  I think they're, they're, they're missing their
coach, but most of all they're just, they're in a rebuilding type of thing.

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  Their, their quarterback's down, too, right now, so the big [clicking],
oops.

B.44:  I'm here, hello?  

A.45:  Big, Big Phil's trying to come back, hold on just a second, that's my other
line.

B.46:  [Laughter]  Okay.  

A.47:  Sorry, Brad.  

B.48:  That's all right.  

A.49:  Okay.  So anyway, Phil's trying to bring them back right now, I guess.

B.50:  Yeah, they had a big game this weekend.  I think if they win it, they got a
shot at getting into the playoffs, but I don't think they're going to win.

A.51:  Who do they play this weekend?  

B.52:  They play the Eagles.  

A.53:  Oh, then it's a big game.  Yeah, they play at, at Philadelphia?

B.54:  Uh, no, they play in New York.  

A.55:  Play in New York, well, yeah.  Good chance there.  Hope so.  

B.56:  But, I don't know [laughter].  (( )).  They haven't done too well against
the Eagles lately.

A.57:  Right, and we just hope, we just hope Dallas makes it.  And, of course, all
that depends on what Philadelphia and New York does, too, so I don't know.

B.58:  Yeah, I guess you got to (( )) it all the time on the Giants, uh, win this
weekend and knock out Philadelphia.

A.59:  That's true.  Because both our teams are like eight and five, you guys are
up, what, seven and six, I guess.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  But, uh, yeah, I think, I think, I think Dallas will make it.  I
think that, I think they're, they're, uh, they're doing pretty well and I think
that, like if the season ended now, they'd be in the playoffs.

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  So you just have to win like two out of the next three or something.

A.63:  I hope so.  Their first playoff games travel to Detroit, I believe.
That's, that will be a tough one on them.

B.64:  Really?  I mean, what's the, I mean, Detroit's only one game up.  Maybe
they, well, they lost to Detroit already, though, didn't they this year?

A.65:  Right.  Yeah.  It was there, but they lost them playing there, but, uh,
still a tough game.

B.66:  Well, maybe they'll get lucky and not have go to Detroit [laughter], but 
(( )) to play lately.

A.67:  Because you got Emmett Smith versus Barry Sanders.  It ought to be a little
exciting.  Be a good game anyway.

B.68:  Yeah, I guess the quarterback on, uh, Detroit was hurt, too.  They're all
getting knocked down.  So maybe they have a better shot against this new
quarterback because Detroit hasn't played as well with this guy as with, uh, I
think, I think his name's Kramer?

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  And, uh, they used to have Rodney Pete who was doing really well for them.

A.71:  Yeah, he was doing well.

B.72:  And then he got hurt.  

A.73:  And the kid from Houston, they drafted from Houston, uh, they gave all that
money to.

B.74:  Right, yeah.  He's doing a lot [laughter].  

A.75:  They've got a lot of high dollar players, I tell you.  

B.76:  Yeah, well, uh,  

A.77:  What do you, this is off the subject a little bit, but what do you feel
about the amount of money these guys are making and, uh, the amount of 
time,
