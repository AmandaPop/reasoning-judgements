A.1:  I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in
Arlington, Virginia.

B.2:  Oh, my, yeah.  Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois.

A.3:  Oh, do they have one?  

B.4:  Yes, they do.  

A.5:  Oh, I didn't know that.  

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  Well, I learned something already [laughter].  

@B.8:  Yeah.  Well, let's see, the three questions are what, uh,   

A.9:  How much time do you spend with your children?  

B.10:  Very little. 

A.11:  Oh [laughter].  

B.12:  Because they're grown.  

A.13:  What?  

B.14:  They're grown and gone.  

A.15:  Oh, yeah, well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college and the other
one is in high school.

B.16:  Huh.  

A.17:  So you do spend less time then?  

B.18:  Yeah -- 

A.19:  C-, 

B.20:  -- because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us.

A.21:  [Laughter] They want to be with their friends.  How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?

B.22:  Uh, yes, I have, uh, two married, two almo-, and then two almost married
and the other two, I'm not sure.  Well,

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  Two s-, two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single.  

A.25:  Oh, [laughter] boy, you have a lot of kids.  

B.26:  Yeah, we have, between the spouse and myself we have six.  

A.27:  Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though.  You --  

B.28:  Because I came with a split family and -- 

A.29:  -- you shouldn't be -- 

B.30:  -- she had,

A.31:  -- lonesome on a holiday, huh?  

B.32:  Well, no, there is so much of them are gone and they're doing their own
things and --

A.33:  Well, that's true.  

B.34:  -- and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh [breathing], when the
holidays,

A.35:  They have to see their other parent, I guess -- 

B.36:  Yeah -- 

A.37:  -- too.  

B.38:  -- and sometimes they want to do their own thing, so -- 

A.39:  I know.  

B.40:  -- sometimes it's just spouse and me.  And, and you know what? 

A.41:  What?  

B.42:  Sometimes that's okay.  

A.43:  I know [laughter].  

B.44:  Because,

A.45:  That's what my mother said one time.  

B.46:  You know, right, because who says that they just must got to come over to
see us all the time --

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  -- for the holidays.  

A.49:  No, that's true, and if they force them to, you know -- 

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  -- that's not good either.  

B.52:  That becomes a drudgery and,

A.53:  Well, do they all live in the area?  

B.54:  Well, let's see, n-, got, of the six, we've got four around here.

A.55:  Uh-huh, oh, wow.  

B.56:  Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpe-, Mont-, Montpelier --

A.59:  Golly. 

B.60:  -- Montpelier, Vermont and the other one is in Everett, Washington.

A.61:  How did they end up so far away?  

B.62:  [Laughter] Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair.  

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  And my second marriage.  Uh, and, uh, 

A.65:  Those are the youngest ones?  

B.66:  Yeah, well, the s-, the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that.

A.69:  Boy, that's, those are a long way.  

B.70:  And,

A.71:  How,   

B.72:  Well, they wanted to go, uh, J R, my, my, my last son -- 

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state --

A.75:  Uh-huh.   

B.76:  -- and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, #Vermont.#

A.77:  #Vermont.# 

B.78:  So,

A.79:  So they wanted to make their homes there.  

B.80:  Yeah, that's where they've gone to make their homes.  

A.81:  My goodness.  Are they, are those two married?  

B.82:  No.  

A.83:  They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?  

B.84:  Well, uh, let's see, yeah, I guess you'd say J R is working, going to s-,
trying to go to school.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  I wish to God he would go back.  

A.87:  [Laughter] Oh, they do.  

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think.  

B.90:  Well, I certainly hope so.  

A.91:  I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T and I'm, I'm going to
U T A right now myself so [laughter] --

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- it's never too late.  

B.94:  Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late.  

A.95:  Right.  

B.96:  And,

A.97:  Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about
twenty percent older students.

B.98:  Yeah, and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up.

A.99:  Oh, yeah, I've seen some people that are really quite up there [laughter]
you know --

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  -- they look like in their very late sixties and I say -- 

B.102:  Oh, my, uh-huh.  

A.103:  -- that's great, why not, you know.  

B.104:  Yes, why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's, I believe that,
uh, we in that category, and I'm not in that category quite yet --

B.106:  -- but, we are seasoned minds.  

A.107:  Oh, yeah, you're really ready to learn finally.

B.108:  Yes, uh-huh.  

A.109:  I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen.

B.110:  Yeah, it was,

A.111:  It was a complete waste of money.  

B.112:  Yeah, settle down, we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study and, uh --

A.113:  Right, right.  We,

B.114:  -- we know our limitations.  

A.115:  Right and, uh,

B.116:  And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in -- 

A.117:  No.  

B.118:  -- the middle altogether.  

A.119:  We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the
morning [laughter].
