======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, capital punishment, I, I know that's kind of a touchy subject.
I, I personally believe that there is a need for capital punishment.  Uh,
especially, you know, in some of the, the real violent type murder and, and
crimes.  I feel like that it's a, it's a justifiable punishment.  Do you?

B.2:  I certainly agree with that.  We have, Dallas has now become one of the
most c-, --

A.3:  Oh. 

B.4:  -- our crime rate has just exceeded all possible goals or whatever.

A.5:  Oh, dear.  

B.6:  And we keep coddling all of our, our men or women -- 

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- incarcerated.  We have to have certain amount of space for them.  I'm
w-, I think we just must keep this capital punishment and I don't believe
keeping them on death row for four or five years --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- is answering any of our problems.  

A.11:  I agree.  I think it just, it jams up the system and, you know, we spend
thousands and thousands of dollars keeping them there and, and I feel that,
yeah, it's not fair to the public and it's, it, I think it's a terrible shame
[laughter].

B.12:  Well, it's not fair to the taxpayers.  

A.13:  That's right.  

B.14:  So, uh,  

A.15:  Now, do you have, uh, what types of capital punishment do they use, or, in
Texas.  What is legal?

B.16:  Uh, the lethal dose -- 

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  -- of, uh, you know -- 

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- slip in it.  I think they maybe should get back to courtyard hangings.

A.21:  Oh. 

B.22:  No, no, I don't really mean that.  

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  But if people could see what was really happening -- 

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  -- I think it would deter this more than, than going in with the needle 
and --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- injecting them.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  Now we, in Utah, they have, uh, either the firing squad or the
lethal injection are the two methods that are, that are used here and I know,
uh, not too long ago, it's probably been two or three years now that, uh, one
of the people chose to die by the firing squad.  And, I, well, I think that
was the last one that died here was by the firing squad and, uh, [lipsmack] so
I know those are the two forms of punishment they use now, but you know, just
the other day we had a, uh, man that was on death row for, for killing his
sister-in-law and her fifteen month old baby and then they came just two days
ago and, and said that something had not been done right with the trial --

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  -- and so now they've, they've just, h-, have to start all over again, go
through the same process all over again and, oh, I think that's ridiculous.  I
just, what a waste of money and time and resources and,

B.32:  That's right.  

A.33:  You know, oh.  

B.34:  Since our, have you ever served on a jury?  

A.35:  No, I have not.  

B.36:  That is one of the most, uh, h-, well, I think everyone should at least
once.

A.37:  Oh. 

B.38:  It was, uh, I've never been on capital punishment -- 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- but, uh, I wonder if these people were guilty until proven innocent --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- if we would not gain or more from our attorneys.  

A.43:  Oh. 

B.44:  I don't know.  

A.45:  I don't know, I, I've been called to trial duty, but I never, they canceled
it, you know, before I got there.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  So, I've never, never had that.  

B.48:  Well, it certainly is a responsibility.  

A.49:  Yes.  

B.50:  But, I think that, uh, we need to demand more from our attorneys when they
withhold information.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  We have three cases going here in Dallas now.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  [Breathing] Two of them were murder, the, well, finally the husband
admitted to having smothered his wife --

A.55:  Oh, no.  

B.56:  -- even though he loved her dearly.  

A.57:  Oh. 

B.58:  So he goes up for forty years with, with a possibility of being out in ten.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  And the other man is charged with, uh, poisoning his wife with arsenic.

A.61:  Oh, no.  

B.62:  And it was a, apparently, it went on over a year.  They were a very, 

A.63:  [Breathing]. 

B.64:  wealthy family -- 

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- and, uh, oh, it just,  

A.67:  Boy.  

B.68:  It, it, you know,  

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  You wonder why, why this happens.  

A.71:  Yes, well I don't know about your situation there, but here in Utah they
are, we are having to build new prisons because there is no place to put, to
put these inmates.  They are just, the prisons are so full, and so we're
spending more and more money building new ones when, when all these, you know,
inmates are on death row and --

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- that's just, you know.  

B.74:  Well, we, l-, ou-, our previous governor wanted to put a tent --

A.75:  Oh. 

B.76:  -- you know, and build,
