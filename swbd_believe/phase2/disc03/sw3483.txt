A.1:   What is your hobby?  

B.2:   Well, I guess I don't have as much time for hobbies as I used
to. 

@A.3:   Isn't that the truth?   

B.4:   Uh, I got two young boys, uh, four and two, so I spend a lot
of time,  

A.5:   [Laughter]. 

B.6:   with them.  But, uh, whenever the weather's nice and, uh,
we can get out, I like to work in the garden a little bit.  Uh,  

A.7:   Get that mud up in your,  

B.8:   [Laughter]. 

A.9:   fingernails.  

B.10:   Yeah.  

A.11:   Yeah, I know how it goes.  

B.12:   Yeah, that's pretty relaxing to me.  

A.13:   Oh, hey, I tell you what, getting outdoors is wonderful.  I
do, too.  My wife always gets mad at me for doing it so much
because she says, you know, I always come in so hot and sweaty and
tired.  

B.14:   [Laughter]. 

A.15:   I said, yeah, but I love it.  

B.16:   [Laughter]. 

A.17:   But for my, you know, my hobby, believe it or not is really a
collection.  I, I collect Mickey Mouse.  

B.18:   Really?  

A.19:   And I, it is a full time hobby of going out there and finding
things to, to add to the collection.  I got well over two thousand
Mickey Mouse items so that's, that's my hobby.  

B.20:   Wow, that's great.  

A.21:   Uh, at one time, and this is about fifteen years ago -- 

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   -- I actually, uh, got some, uh, what do you call it, uh,
[breathing] uh, plywood board -- 

B.24:   Uh-huh.  

A.25:   -- and I made some Christmas cut out figures that I put in the
yard, and, I mean, they, everyone always talks about, you know,
where did I buy them and I keep telling them, but I didn't buy
them.  

B.26:   #[Laughter].#

A.27:   #I, I made them,# you know.  And they stood there now for some
fifteen years so,  

B.28:   Wow, that's pretty neat.  

A.29:   Uh, and that in itself was a lot of fun, you know.  But I've
never worked with a jig saw before, but it sure did work, you
know,

B.30:   Yeah.  

A.31:   And I guess the other hobby that I did at one time, I don't do
anymore is good old needlepointing.  

B.32:   Um.  

A.33:   And, uh, that was my wife's hobby.  

B.34:   I see.  

A.35:   And, so I picked it up, and I did some stuff, and I entered
into the State Fair and I won a couple ribbons and said, well,
okay.  

B.36:   [Laughter]. 

A.37:   But, for some reason, it just didn't really catch my thing,
but my hobby -- 

B.38:   Yeah.  

A.39:   -- of collecting Mickey Mouse, I think I've got the disease
now.  

B.40:   [Laughter]  Now that you have more and more time on your hands,
right.  

A.41:   [Laughter]. 

B.42:   [Laughter]. 

A.43:   True, true.  But, I don't know, you know, you, you're right,
though.  Uh, with the kids, and I now have a six year old, I don't
have as much time for the hobbies as I used to.  

B.44:   Yeah, yeah.  I know what you mean.  They take up all my time
now.  I'm kind of looking forward to the time when, uh, they're a
little bit older, and they can get out and, you know, get a little
more active in sports.  

A.45:   Well, at this point, my kid is six years old.  The, we just
finished our first season of flag football.  

B.46:   uh.  

A.47:   And daddy had a ball.  

B.48:   [Laughter]. 

A.49:   Now, I don't know if he had a good time, but I had a great
time, and, so I look, you know, more forward to the, I guess maybe
that stage of my life, I don't have enough time to do hobbies, but
I do have enough time to, to play with the kids, and that's what I
want to do.  

B.50:   Yeah, me, too.  I'm, I'm really, I can't wait for that time. 

A.51:   Uh,  

B.52:   I just can't wait.  

A.53:   I took them out to a, a, uh, a little T-ball and that's, that,
that worked out real nice.  

B.54:   Yeah.  

A.55:   He, he enjoyed it.  Uh, I'm not sure that he understood what
was going on, but, you know. 

B.56:   [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.57:   But at six years old, I, I think they're still a bit young.  

B.58:   Yeah, and my oldest is four.  

A.59:   But flag football, he picked up that real quick.   

B.60:   Really?  

A.61:   He loved it.  

B.62:   That's great.  

A.63:   Yeah.  And daddy loved it, too, I mean,   

B.64:   [Laughter]. 

A.65:   [Laughter]. 

B.66:   That's pretty good.  Yeah, mine's, uh, uh, just now has
started getting into, well, you know, like all the other little,
little young kids, he, he was up on the Turtles and stuff, but now
he's trying to get into Robin Hood.  

A.67:   uh.  

B.68:   And so we're going get him one of those Nerf Robin Hood bow
and arrow things.  

A.69:   Well,  

B.70:   [Laughter]. 

A.71:   I'm going to be doing, for this Christmas, uh, I'm buying him
a, uh, swing set.  

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   Which includes a fort and everything else.  

B.74:   Oh. 

A.75:   And they say it only takes thirteen hours to build.  

B.76:   [Laughter]. 

A.77:   I'm thinking, uh-huh.  So I have a feeling I might find myself
with a full time hobby [laughter].  

B.78:   [Laughter]. 

A.79:   I've got a, uh, a fence builder who is going to come over
there to help me so -- 

B.80:   Oh, that's good.  

A.81:   -- hopefully between the two of us we can figure out how to
put that sucker together.  

B.82:   Yeah, yeah.  It always, always helps when you got somebody to
help you.  

A.83:   Oh, yes.  The swing set that we have, a little Jim Dandy, uh,
made out of metal -- 

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   -- is okay, but -- 

B.86:   Yeah.  

A.87:   -- he's much too big for that.  His imagination is much bigger
so we, we've got the monkey bars and the fort -- 

B.88:   Wow.  

A.89:   -- you know, it goes on and on and on.  

B.90:   Yeah.  Yeah, whenever, uh, uh, every now and then I'll take
mine to the park and they like play on all over that stuff that's
at the park.  

A.91:   Oh, yes.  

B.92:   And, and, it's like you said, it's got the fort, you know,
it's the whole works.  

A.93:   Uh-huh.  

B.94:   Made out of wood.  

A.95:   And, and now, who knows, maybe the kids in the neighborhood
will want to come to his house to play, you know [laughter]. 

B.96:   [Laughter]  Yeah, he always goes over their houses, uh,  

A.97:   Uh, right now he always does because he says there's nothing
to play with at our house.  

B.98:   [Laughter]. 

A.99:   So, well, okay, so [laughter].  I'd like to have my turn to be
able to invite the kids.  Because I, I don't know about you, but I
love having the kids around.  It's fun.  

B.100:   Yeah, there aren't too many right now, actually mine are the
oldest on our block.  

A.101:   uh.  

B.102:   And the other ones are at least a year to two years younger. 
So ours is a, a block of pretty young kids right now.  

A.103:   Uh, I think in my neighborhood, there's about two or three at
the same age, but most of them are about two or three years older. 

B.104:   Oh, I see.  

A.105:   So my, my boys a little bit younger, so,  

B.106:   I see.  

A.107:   But, oh, well.  

B.108:   [Laughter]. 

A.109:   He'll, he'll get there.  

B.110:   Yeah, I want to know this side of them and, and they do tend
to congregate around our house and, and, you know, I never really
thought about that much either.  All the little ones come over and
they kind of hang around our front yard.  But, uh,  

A.111:   So, I guess the bottom line conclusion is,
