===========================================================================

A.1:  [Door] [noise] [breathing] Okay, I'm here.  How do you feel about public
schools?

B.2:  Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel.

@A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation but, uh, we're toward
the bottom.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  That you would think it would be easy to correct.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  But the system doesn't allow for the corrections [laughter].  

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  How about you?

A.13:  Well, that's interesting.  I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw,
Georgia.

B.14:  Oh, yes.

A.15:  And, uh, she has a young boy.  Actually has two boys now but only had one
when she was there.  And she complained quite a bit about their school system
there.

B.16:  Yes.

A.17:  And,

B.18:  And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.  

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  She was in Cobb County.

A.21:  Right.  I'm, I can't really say much about the schools up here.  I really
don't come from here [laughter] --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- I'm only up here temporarily on an internship #but# --

B.24:  #Okay.#

A.25:  -- uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually.  And the schools down there,
from what I know, are not bad.  They're pretty good.

B.26:  Well, that's great.

A.27:  [/Breathing] But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas
they're not that good.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  For example, I have a brother in North Carolina and he says the schools
there are, are incredibly bad.  Uh, just terrible.

B.30:  Well, I feel that we're way behind.  Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth
grade --

A.31:  Huh. 

B.32:  -- and, uh, they have just now taken up division.

A.33:  Wow.

B.34:  Yeah [laughter].  #And (( ))# --

A.35:  #That is slow.#

B.36:  -- uh, i-, e-, my husband and I go to the store and we buy these math books
and fractions and multiplication, division things and I feel like, uh, there
are several areas that we're just really, really slow in.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And, uh, [swallowing] I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the
system.  #It is,# 

A.39:  #What# do you think's wrong to cause #that?#

B.40:  #Well,# well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system.
And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use {mispronounced} it
wisely.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person #to deal# --

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  -- with on an every day [laughter] basis.  #Uh# --

A.47:  #Perhaps.#

B.48:  -- but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to
command the attention of the children.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps ca-, the
class in an uproar and you're not at liberty --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or
send them to the #principal's office.  It# --

A.53:  #Yeah, that's, that's# one thing I worry about (( )).

B.54:  -- it, you know, it can, it can really be bad.  Uh, also I think, we have a
lot of, uh, Hispanics --

A.55:  There you go, uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and we have a lot of, uh, the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are
mostly #Hispanic.#

A.57:  #Yeah.#  Probably quite a few black people up there and #and,# 

B.58:  #No [laughter].# We're from a county, we're from the county they marched
in.  #We're in ((Forsyth)) county# --

A.59:  #Oh, is that right?#

B.60:  -- yes, and we, and there's very, very few blacks.  

A.61:  Oh, okay.

B.62:  Uh, so, so that's, uh, I, I hate to say, uh, it's not a problem, uh,
because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although #they are.#

A.63:  #Yeah but,# you know, it, it's, you don't want to seem racist or prejudice
or whatever, but #then again.#

B.64:  #But it is# a problem [laughter].

A.65:  Yeah, there is no denying that, #that,# 

B.66:  #Uh, especially# in the inner schools, #inner city.#

A.67:  #Sure,# you know.  Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow
things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very
well developed special education program at the #school.#

B.68:  #Well,# and you can't put all the children in special education.  

A.69:  That's right, you can't do that.

B.70:  Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether
the homework is done --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- you know.

A.73:  See, I grew up in Nebraska --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- and the school that I went to there was fantastic.  It, I, I really
consider myself very, very lucky.  Uh, we had a school that had classes
probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to sc-,
to a #class.#

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  #But,# 

B.78:  #But# your teacher had control.

A.79:  Yeah.  We zipped right along, you know.  I, I --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication
by the third grade, easily.

B.82:  Yeah.  #I, I# --

A.83:  #Uh,# 

B.84:  -- believe I was too.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  But, you're right, you know.  With all this, don't hurt the kids
and don't abuse their rights, #you've also taken# --

B.86:  #Uh-huh [laughter].#

A.87:  -- something away from the discipline, I #think.#

B.88:  #Uh,# well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford
it, my son would be in private school.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  We just cannot afford it.  

A.91:  Right.  I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option.

B.92:  Uh, if,
