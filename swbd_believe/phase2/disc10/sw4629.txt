A.1:  So, what do you think?  Uh, are we spending the right amount of money on
AIDS research?

@B.2:  Well, uh, {pause} actually, I'm, I kind of, uh, well that's like between
saying yes and no.  It, uh, I think that we're, uh, spending about what we
should but I'm not exactly sure if we're spending it in the right, right, uh,
uh, location.

A.3:  Yeah.  I, I do believe that there [sigh], I, I'm like you, I'm a little
mixed up on the subject.  I think there are more people who die of heart
disease in a year in this country than there are of AIDS.  Is that true?  Have
you heard #that?#

B.4:  #Yes.#  

A.5:  And, and I suppose really AIDS is, you die from any number of things.
Isn't that true?

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  So.  So, I would suspect that, you know, pneumonia, I think, is one of them
and, and the cancers and whatnot.  So I think, indirectly, there, there is
extra AIDS research being done.

B.8:  Right.  Uh, but I think that [noise] a lot of people have the attitude that
the more money you throw at something, the, uh, better chance you have o-, of
curing it and that's just not true.

A.9:  No, I don't think so.  I [laughter], I, I totally agree.  It's just like
education.  Throwing more money into a grade school isn't necessarily going to
make things better [laughter].

B.10:  Right.  I think, uh, you know, that, that money needs to be spent on, on
research [noise] but I, I think, uh, you know, it should be a, a wide spectrum
re-, of research and not just, uh, research on a cure and not, not on a,
research on how to prolong life or, or, uh, make the disease any, any less
traumatic.  You know, I think money, [sniffing] I think one, once somebody has
contracted the disease that's, that's, uh, you know, that's unfortunate but
let's try to concentrate on, on, you know, let's put resources on making sure
nobody else gets it.  Uh,

A.11:  Yeah.  So, i-, you're thinking in terms of, of an education on how to
prevent it or you're thinking of maybe, uh, I don't know #a vaccine# --

B.12:  #Right.#  

A.13:  -- or,

B.14:  Right.  Well I think, uh, you know, there's, there's, my opinion is
there's, there's a, there is a limited number of resources, medical resources
available.

A.15:  Oh, absolutely.

B.16:  And I think it is foolish to, to, uh, spend most of those, uh, a, a large
majority of those resources on people who have AIDS, uh, simply because they,
they, uh, they need attention right away or, or need more attention than
somebody who has heart disease or, or slow cancer or something.  I think, I
don't know, I think, uh, too much money is being spent on, on a, on
sophisticated medical treatment for, for people, {mispronounced} for people
who need to be in a hospice program [noise].

A.17:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, do you think that one reason maybe that the, the
funding level is as high as it is, is because AIDS, perhaps, strikes, uh, a
vocal group of people?

B.18:  Yes.  #Well that# --

A.19:  #I mean,# 

B.20:  -- I mean that fits the country we live in.  #((The)) people [laughter],#

A.21:  #[Laughter]# That's right.  Tell me about it.  I was in, I was on a, in
downtown Washington Sunday when half a million people were demonstrating
[laughter].

B.22:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, the, I mean th-, the people with the loudest grou-, voice
get the money.  It's not necessarily the people who, uh, who deserve it the
most.

A.23:  Yeah.  Well, I, I agree that there's a limited, it, it's almost like we
have fixed number of dollars that you can spend on medical research and you
have to kind of allocate it in certain directions.

B.24:  Right.  Although that sounds heartless that's, that's,

A.25:  But good things have come of that.  I mean polio is just about a thing of
the past.

B.26:  Right.  

A.27:  And, and other diseases.  Uh, d-, [laughter],

B.28:  Well, I know just something local to you, I remem-, I used to live in
Dallas and so I have some {very faint} friends there and I know, for example,
uh, Parkland Hospital is spending, or at least was when I was there, spending
a large portion of their bud-, their budget on, on, on, basically, warehousing
AIDS victims.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  I suspect that's true.

B.30:  And, you know, that's, you know, I, I, you know, my heart goes out to those
people who, who have the disease but I don't think that we should be spending,
uh, you know, that, th-, that a majority of the hospitals resources should not
go for, for, uh, indigent ba-, AIDS patients.

A.31:  That's right.  Well, certainly if you have AIDS, unless you're incredibly
wealthy, you're going to end up indigent.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  I think that, I mean that goes along with it too.  You get to the point
where you can't work and,
