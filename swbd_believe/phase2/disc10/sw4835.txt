A.1:  Well, what's your opinion on capital punishment?

@B.2:  Well, uh, {pause} I, uh, I agree with it as long as, uh, as long as
there's no [clicking], no shadow of a doubt of guilt.  #((Uh)),# 

A.3:  #Right,# I agree with that too.  I, uh, this is probably going to be not a
big debate or anything [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  Uh, I am for capital c-, punishment, only for murder.  I mean, you know, I
think they asked in the recording, uh --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- i-, in what crimes.  But only if someone has murdered someone, you know,
that's about the only thing.  But, uh, how is Georgia for, uh, capital
punishment?  Are they executing people or,

B.8:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, uh, not very often but they, they do send some every now
and then #((you know)).#

A.9:  #What#  Well, needless to say, Texas is, uh, probably the leader.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Uh, I, we may have started, you know, capital punishment back up again --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and, uh, I think we've probably executed more people than any other
state.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But, uh, a case out in California, what was it, a week or so ago, was
rather interesting in how that, uh, they prolonged the guy that was supposed
to be executed.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  And I just, I can't see any real value in just letting these people live
out their sentences.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it seems a little bit ridiculous because of, just the tax
dollar it takes to maintain somebody that's hopelessly, [laughter] you know,
just, uh, violent.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  #((And)),#

B.20:  #And,# uh, it's, doesn't make much sense.

A.21:  How do you feel about insanity pleas?

B.22:  I, uh, I don't think it's much of a, a reason for, uh, I, I don't think
it's much of a reason to get somebody off a, off the hook.  I mean, like, uh,
Jeffrey Dahlmer.  I, I don't know, I haven't followed that since, you know, it
was on the news but, you know, I, I've heard that there might be some insanity
there.  I don-, you know, I'm, I'm not at all up to date on that but, you
know, if something like that, if they, if you can get off on s-, insanity on
something like that which I, I believe, [laughter] you know, there is a
certain degree of insanity there but --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- that's certainly n-, I, I don't believe it's, uh, an excuse by any
means, you know.

A.25:  Well, I had heard of a case out in California of someone who had murdered
his parents or some sort of thing and they put him away, uh, in an insane
asylum, you know, because he pleaded insanity and after he was in, maybe
twelve years or so, they let him out.  He went out and he killed five more
people.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  #So.#

B.28:  #Yeah.# I just don't, I don't think that's, uh, an excuse at all.

A.29:  Well, I guess it's sounds rather heartless but I guess if they're that bad,
if they're that badly off mentally, then perhaps it's just as well to, to #end
their life.#

B.30:  #Yeah,# [laughter] yeah.

A.31:  Aren't we cruel people?  #[laughter].#

B.32:  #[Laughter] Oh, I don't, I don't think so.#  I mean, I just, you know, if,
I, I think in Japan, you know, when crime gets bad they, you know, they take a
few criminals out in the public square and they execute them and crime goes
down #[laughter].#

A.33:  #[Laughter].#  

B.34:  You know.  Uh, so there's, I think it, I think it works.  Since most people
don't believe in being forced, you know.

A.35:  Well, I, they may say it's not a deterrent and perhaps it isn't.  But I
guess I just feel, if nothing else, it's justice.  I know that if someone
murdered a member of my family, I'd want justice done #and# --

B.36:  #Yeah.# 

A.37:  -- I'd want to see them punished for their crime.

B.38:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.39:  #So.#

B.40:  I, I agree.  I agree.  

A.41:  Uh, perhaps the people in the Middle East have kind of a good idea, you
know.  If you steal something, they cut off --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- your hand and --

B.44:  Yeah [laughter].

A.45:  -- and the punishment fits the crime.  #But, uh [laughter],#

B.46:  #Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's, uh, not a bad idea [laughter].# Of
course, there, there'd be a lot of people [laughter] that, uh, that couldn't
function for awhile, you know until they got it through their heads that, you
know, that was going to be enforced [laughter].

A.47:  Well, this is very true [laughter].

B.48:  [Laughter] You'd have to phase that one in slowly or, I think, #or you
would have a bunch of,# 

A.49:  #[Laughter]#  Use someone as an example and see how it worked #[laughter].#

B.50:  #Yeah [laughter].#  But then you got to pick who it's going to be.

@@A.51:  Well I, I was a little concerned I was going to get someone on the phone
that was totally against capital punishment,

B.52:  [Laughter] {very faint}.

A.53:  and in any conversation that I've had through this T I thing, you know,
I've never met anybody that I got into a screaming argument with --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- or even really disagreed with heavily --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- but I thought this could be one, you know.
