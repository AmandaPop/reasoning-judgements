REMARKS:        Speaker A stutters and is hard to understand at times.

========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, you know, I, I think i-, it really depends, you know.  I think,
you know, if, you know, taking the current batch, we got, you know, I think
Paul Tsongas probably isn't in it for like his own gain.  I, I don't see him
as that kind of a guy.  I can believe like that Bill Clinton might be.  Uh, I
certainly think a lot of people in Congress are.

B.2:  Well, it's, for me it's hard to talk about, uh, specifics because I don't
know the people.  All I've read is, uh --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- the headlines.  The, uh, the generic question which is what they're
talking about --

A.5:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.6:  -- I think it's all government, any government is based on the honesty of
the, of the individual.  Right?

A.7:  Yeah, well, you know, I th-, I think, if you like compare us to other
governments, you know, I, I think we tend to be overly critical of our own
government.  I mean, you go and look like a lot of these African countries
where corruption is ri-, right out in the open.  It's like, you know, you want
to do something, you know, you better even be the president's best friend or,
you know, pay me a lot of money.

B.8:  Yeah.  Well that's, that's part of it.  The tradition certainly modifies
it.  If you have, uh, tradition of, of, uh, like,

A.9:  (( )) or whatever they call #it.#

B.10:  #Yeah,# or might makes right or money #which is might.#  

A.11:  #Right or ((bucks make right)).#

B.12:  So, uh, i-, certainly you're not going to have the same kind of honesty.
On the other hand, uh, I, I think, it seems to me that all the big scandals
are based on either individual honesty, uh, going corrupt or frankly, uh, uh,
elective honesty going bad on us.

A.13:  Well, you know, I, I think, you know, to some extent, you know, people get
the government they deserve is a cliche --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- but it, it's really true.  I mean if, you know, you hear these guys, I
think that, that this is the first election I've heard about where a lot of
the incumbents are really f-, saying okay, we're getting out because it's too
much heat.  I mean, normally, it's, yeah, okay, what big scandal.  But it
comes times to reelect them, they say hey, this is the guy that brings home
the bacon for us, you know, he's got seniority on all these committees, we're
not going to replace him.

B.16:  Yes and that's again the, what you said earlier about people get what they
deserve.  They say well, i-, if, if a dishonest person is, uh, good for us,
we'll keep him in office.

A.17:  Yeah and, I mean, also, you know, you look, I think a lot of it has to do
with ref-, with, with, with the issue of campaign reform.  When it costs you,
I mean, ten million, twenty million dollars, somet-, I've heard horrendous
figures, to run for a senate seat, you know, t-, job pays a hundred thousand a
year, you know, i-, i-, it, the, you work it out.  Unless someone is
incredibly altruistic, you know, there's no reason for them to want to run for
that.

B.18:  [Sigh] I, I think that, uh, part of it, again, is this, this, uh, well,
organizations can go bad and our particular organization has, is one of the
best in the world but it's still relative to itself, is, uh, is in serious
need of reform.  Uh, I, I've been,

A.19:  [Talking]. 

B.20:  overseas and there's a lot of, as you pointed out, there's a lot of
correc-, corruption in other countries and so, when you come back to the
States, you say well, as bad as this is, #I'm still# --

A.21:  #Right.#

B.22:  -- awfully glad to be here [inhaling].  Uh, so I guess the, you know,
[laughter] this question was can we ever get, uh, totally, uh, honest
government and I would say, uh [sniffing],

A.23:  ((Well)), it's an imperfect system because people are imperfect. 

B.24:  Yeah, only to the extent that I'm honest, can I, can I, uh, uh, act as an
honest person.

A.25:  I, I mean the problem is that [inhaling] you know, you've got, [sigh] as I
said there's no incen-, incentive to go into (( )).  I mean, look at our state
legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not, you know,
what's the campaign.  The campaign is four guys go against each other and
there's no advertising.  Those people I can believe are doing it because they
want to change the process [talking] but when you're talking about having to
spend tens of millions of dollars to get elected and then being in the pockets
of all these people who gave you the money and then having to regard how to
rep-, you know, how to, uh, do for yourself.  I think, I, I really think that,
it's not so much that corrupt people go into it as that the process corrupts.

B.26:  I, I would agree with you there.  Well the other side of the coin too is
tha-, that the whole, that the process even from the beginning, uh, you
scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.  Uh, I would even, I would disagree with
you a little bit because I think in the state level that's just part of the,
uh, the internship so to speak and there's a lot of corruption [inhaling].

A.27:  [Inhaling] I, I think it depends a lot on, on the state.  I think that it
varies from state to state.

B.28:  Oh, yes.  But, but what I meant was why do people go, why do people run for
the school board.

A.29:  #Right.#

B.30:  #Because# that's step one on the ladder.

A.31:  Oh, oh man, I don't want to talk about the school board, 

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  we've just, we've just been having school board meetings and it was like
people suing each other {mispronounced} over things they said,
