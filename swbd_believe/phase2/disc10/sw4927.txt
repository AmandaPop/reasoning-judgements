============================================================================

A.1:  [TV].

B.2:  Okay.  Uh, mandatory service.  Yeah.  I don't think it's a good idea, uh,
because we'd have to change the constitution to, to, uh, allow, uh,
involuntary servitude, uh, in service to the government.  And I'm not sure
that we could,

A.3:  [Noise].

B.4:  do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state.

@A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  It's, I like #the,# -- 

A.7:  #And,# 

B.8:  -- idea.

A.9:  In what way are you talking about.

B.10:  Well, [throat_clearing] I like the idea of volunteer, voluntary support.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  I mean they might be able to, ah, say that anyone who does that, uh, gets
certain benefits that [throat_clearing] would not be available to someone who
didn't do it.  But to use force, uh, [swallowing] really sets us a, a, i-, i-,
essentially says that your body, there's a title to your body and that title
belongs to the government.

A.13:  (( )).

B.14:  And you are not a free #American# --

A.15:  #Yeah.#

B.16:  -- citizen.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  The idea itself of service is good and when someone is say, out of high
school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a
career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt, that's the best time
to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well.

A.19:  See, I, yeah.  And I also thought that, uh, that would interfere with, with
college work.

B.20:  Yeah.  #Unless it were tied# --

A.21:  #And they didn't,# 

B.22:  -- directly.

A.23:  [Inhaling] Yeah.

B.24:  You know, if someone were studying something, (( )) take something obscure.
Somebody was studying economics, the State Department could offer to send them
to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country.

A.25:  Yeah.  #That's true.#

B.26:  #[Laughter] As an# extreme example, right?

A.27:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.28:  But, in reality, I think what you would wind up with is a political
football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to, for
their own will and I just don't think it would work.

A.29:  When do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory?  Or when,
when, what, what year are they looking at?

B.30:  Well, they're not.  It's been suggested.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And it's sort of a topic of debate.

A.33:  [Child_talking].

B.34:  Every time it comes up it gets voted down.  The people who are promilitary
oppose because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the
military into something else.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the
government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military
#unless# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- the United States is actually under attack [static].

A.39:  Right.  Right {very faint}.  

B.40:  So, mostly, it's just kind of one of those things that goes away.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Ah!  They've got a noisy line.

A.43:  I thought that was your line #[laughter].#

B.44:  #Yeah.#  Well, it's somewhere between here and there.

A.45:  Uh, what age group i-, are, are they looking at?

B.46:  Uh, oh eighteen.  The draft age.  

A.47:  Eighteen.  

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Yeah, that seems, #normally that would interfere with college, I would
think.#

B.50:  #Wait a, yeah.# Let me see if I can get on a cleaner line.  If it's my
line, uh.

A.51:  I moved.  Maybe that is, that's part of it.

B.52:  [Click] [/Static] Yeah it is my line.  I was on a radio phone.

A.53:  Oh.

B.54:  All right.  That's better [swallowing].  Yeah, now their, they, they figure
that they can draft you at eighteen.  They usually do draft you at nineteen.
And that's the,

A.55:  [Thumping] [child].

B.56:  age they're looking at.  

A.57:  Oh.  #Um.#

B.58:  #And,# of course, they're, this one the women would be equally grabbed and
they're almost on the verge of saying that you, if you're going to draft men,
you're going to have to draft women.  And you're going to have to put them in
front of the guns just the same.

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  So, uh, if you're near that age [laughter] or you know somebody who is --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- uh, you know, be aware of that.

A.63:  Yeah [lipsmack].  Well, that's kind of scary #[laughter].#  

B.64:  #Yeah.#  

A.65:  I'm not near that age [laughter].  I'm way over it #but I# --

B.66:  #Oh, okay.#

A.67:  -- do have children to think about, #you know.#

B.68:  #Yep.#  And you don't want them #sent off to the Middle East to# --  

A.69:  #That's kind of scary.#

B.70:  -- help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him.

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  [Laughter] You know, we only find out about that a year after the fact.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  So, it's another thing.  When in doubt, don't trust the government at all
[laughter].  It's really #reached# --

A.75:  #Oh.#

B.76:  -- that point.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  Huh.

@@B.78:  Hey, you're in Perot country.  I'm really thinking that this guy might be
good for us.

A.79:  I do too #[laughter].#

B.80:  #I've been,# I-, it seemed dangerous.  I thought is the guy a closet
fascist?  And then I find out that he helped rid the United States of the
gablers.

A.81:  He's, he's helped out in a lot of ways.  Yeah, he's, he's from Dallas.  Or
he's in the Dallas area.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  And, uh, he's very well known around here.  #So.#

B.84:  #Okay.# Well, I'm in the computer biz too so I know he's well known in the
industry.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  They, uh, I, I have high hopes for him.  And I think that [laughter], you
know, if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the
government was actually for us, then I'm for him.

A.87:  Yeah.  #I, I.#

B.88:  #I mean# in the Democratic primary, I'm going to vote for Brown just
because I kind of like Brown and his attitude.  But when, uh, when it really
comes down in the fall, I think I know where it's going to go.

A.89:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I think he's got a very good chance.  So, there's a lot of
people here pulling for him.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  So.  I don't know [laughter].  

B.92:  Yeah [laughter].

A.93:  We'll just see.  #How# --

B.94:  #You know, th-,#

A.95:  -- did you, uh, you work in the, uh, computer business, is that what you
said?

B.96:  Yeah.  I'm an end user.  I teach people how to use MacIntoshes and how to
buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to
that.

A.97:  Oh, okay.  Uh, my husband works for, uh, Texas Instruments.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  And, so, uh, that's how we found out about the Switchboard.

B.100:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's their project too, isn't it?  I found about it on the
network.

A.101:  (( )) [/T V].
