============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, okay, so our subject is nursing homes.  Uh, do you have any
experience or any, uh, opinions on what to do?

@B.2:  I do have, actually, as a matter of fact.  Uh, and I'm, I'm not sure how
it would relate to the big city but there are certainly ways and humane and
nice ways of handling care for elderly.  I come from a very small community in
northern Iowa --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and the churches have banded together and built and staffed a retirement
home.

A.5:  That's wonderful.

B.6:  And the care, of course, is, is wonderful because these are all people who
care.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And every week, the churches, a different, uh, groups of the churches
volunteer and come in and maybe have bingo day or special celebration day or
help ((somebody)) with their birthday or whatever.  And it makes the care very
personalized, of course.  But, since it is a small community, everybody knows
everybody --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and so there, there would be absolutely zero chance of any abuse.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  That's great because, uh, you know, I think that is probably a
person's greatest fear and I'm not faced with this yet but my mother is
seventy-three.  She's in good health and living by herself but, uh, I'll
probably be faced with this, you know, sometime in the next few years as to
what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself.
Uh, unfortunately having her come live with us, you know, if she needs
constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do, you know.

B.12:  Yeah, it's, it's a real problem.  Uh, it is a real problem and I know that
everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but I also think that it is
a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and
internalized ourselves --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- as opposed to being a part of the community.  Uh, it used to be that
neighbors looked out for you.  The churches looked out for you.  But many of
us don't belong to churches anymore.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And so, therefore, we don't have this broadened community of caring people.

A.17:  And we don't have the nuclear family that we used to have #many# --

B.18:  #No.#

A.19:  -- many years ago either.

B.20:  No, absolutely not.  You know, I presume, when, when the time comes for
something to happen to me that I will probably go back to Iowa to be in that
community.  #But, uh,# 

A.21:  #Well,# it's good that you know that you have that option available.  Uh,
it, because I don't think that too many communities have something like that
set up.

B.22:  But it's the type of thing where I think we should look at some things that
are working and try to use them in the cities also.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I mean, is there some reason why some of the churches here could not band
together and do a similar situation?

A.25:  Probably not.  Uh, and it might even be easier here in that there are so
many more churches #available.#

B.26:  #Yes.#

A.27:  More people to draw from.

B.28:  And, actually, a great deal more money #[laughter].#

A.29:  #Well, yes.  That's for certain.  My, my mom# lives in a small town also
and I know, you know, the funds just aren't available, uh, to do something in
a small town that you have, that you can do in a larger town.  But, uh, uh,
you know, other than care conditions, [sigh] I don't know really what else a
person looks for.  Uh, convenience for the family would be a, a wonderful
thing.  Uh, but that's, you know, that's not always an option either.

B.30:  Right.  But, you know, if my fa-, if all of my kids still live here and I
go back to Iowa, of course there's no convenience.  So probably it would
behoove me [laughter] to try to start something of this sort here in Dallas.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  [Throat_clearing] But, uh, [sigh] that's a big job, you know.  Uh, so many
needs are crying.  The homeless, the abused children, the, the beaten wives,
you know.  There's so many things going on that, that how do we all of this
and maybe that's a part of it.  Maybe, maybe what we can do is, uh, of course,
this is kind of a far flung situation but, uh, you know, they're talking about
work fare now in, uh, Wisconsin I believe it is.  But is there some reason, I
wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved in nursing homes.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  #Is that,# 

B.34:  #So that# they didn't have to be so expensive.  

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  You know if, if you've got somebody who is drawing welfare, then perhaps
that can be quote part of their, their payment for their welfare payments.

A.37:  Well, and I think that would be a good idea too.  I don't know if these
people need it for self-esteem.  It would seem to me that they would.  But if
nothing else, yes, let them earn some of their money.

B.38:  Yeah.  Because part of the problem now is that [throat_clearing] it costs
so much money to get into a convalescent home or, or an aged home.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  You know, it's almost prohibitive for many persons.  And, uh, you know, so
what do you do?  Does someone go on welfare in order to get in one of those
homes?  Or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at
home and, and but, of course, that's not always wonderful either because
somebody with Alzheimer's needs twenty-four hour watching --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and nobody can do that.

A.43:  That's right, that's right.  #I# --

B.44:  #Nobody# can do that.

A.45:  -- well, I guess that's probably, as people get older,
