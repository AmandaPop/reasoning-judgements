=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, read any good books lately?  [Laughter].  

@B.2:  [Laughter] Uh, yes, I, I've read, uh, several good books lately.  Uh, lot
of them related to, uh, business and financial matters since that's what I do
for a living.

A.3:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.

B.4:  How about yourself?

A.5:  Uh, well I'm in graduate school and so I read a lot of books but I don't
know if I consider very many of them good [laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  Uh, I haven't read a book for enjoyment since, I guess, around Christmas.
Uh, I [throat_clearing] re-, received, uh, uh, several books for Christmas and
at Christmas break I read, uh, SARUM by, uh, uh, a fellow named Rutherford.

B.8:  Yes.

A.9:  Uh, it's the history of, uh, well it's sort of the his-, the historical
fiction about, uh, the Salisbury area in, in England.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And so, I, I really enjoyed that book a lot.  Uh, he's not quite as good
as, you know, Michener or some of, uh, some of the other historical writers.
But he, he did this job well, so.

B.12:  Well, that sounds good.  

A.13:  Yeah.  Uh, do you find th-, do you find you have much chance to read for,
for just pleasure or mostly for business?

B.14:  No, I read for pleasure some also.  I read a book recently called IRON
JOHN.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Have you seen that by Bly?

A.17:  I don't think I have seen it.

B.18:  Okay.  Well it's a book about, 

A.19:  [Noise].

B.20:  uh, uh, Greek gods and, and Greek, uh, mythology --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- as well as, uh, man and interacting with other men and a book about, uh,
men and how they mature through life.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  #Oh.#

B.24:  #And# how they deal with life itself [sniffing].

A.25:  Okay.  I think I have heard about that.  #Yeah.#

B.26:  #But# it's, uh, it's all revolved around, uh, mythology.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Uh, as far as, uh, traditions from, uh, other cultures and our culture.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And how we, uh, interact with one another.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Did, did it have something to mention
about, uh, sort of, uh, cultural rituals of, of manhood?

B.32:  Yes.

A.33:  Okay.  Yeah, I have heard of that.  I have, uh, someone suggested that I
read it.  Is it IRON JOHN?

B.34:  Yes.

A.35:  Okay.  Good.

B.36:  By Bly, B L Y, I believe it is.

A.37:  B L Y?

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Okay.  Great.

B.40:  And, uh, it's a very interesting book.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  Uh, what are your favorite, uh, do you have a favorite subject to
read, whether it be science fiction or, or history or,

B.42:  Well, it depends again if we're talking about [laughter], uh, I read a lot
of religious books.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Uh, just because I have an interest in that area.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And I read a lot of books in the area of, uh, uh, psychology and self-help
type, uh, materials.

A.47:  Okay.

B.48:  Uh, always trying to understand people --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to
understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business.

A.51:  Okay.

B.52:  And, uh, so that, that's, my work is my hobby [laughter].

A.53:  Uh-huh.  #That# --

B.54:  #[Laughter]# So I, I enjoy it.

A.55:  -- sounds great [laughter].  Uh, who is your, whose your favorite religious
author?

B.56:  Well, I don't know if I have a favorite --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- uh, religious author.  I would have to say that, uh, some of the ones
that consistently put out good materials,

A.59:  [Rustling].

B.60:  uh, you know, that, that's difficult because [lipsmack] one person might
write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Uh, I had to stop here and think a second.  One of the ones that I've read
recently that I've read several of his books and I thought that each one of
his books were good.  He's the man out of San Antonio.  And, uh,

A.63:  Max Lucado?  [Noise].

B.64:  Max Lucado.

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  Max consistently writes good books.

A.67:  Yeah.  Uh, he's a great man.  I've met him several times.  Uh,
  
B.68:  Yes.  I know him, yeah.  

A.69:  Huh.

B.70:  [Throat_clearing] #But# -- 

A.71:  #((Uh))#

B.72:  -- uh, there's other authors also that have uh, uh, that write good books
from time to time, but not consistently put out the materials all the time
[sniffing].

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  Uh, I'd say another, which is a local writer here in Plano, uh, is, uh, I'm
trying to think of his name.  He's with the Bible church.  And that is, uh,
{pause}, I see his name but I can't, I mean I see him but I can't see his name
[laughter] [sniffing].  But he, uh, he talks about, uh, he talks about a lot
of different topics and,
