=======================================================================

A.1:  Yeah, I had this topic, uh, the last time I called, I
believe.

B.2:  My goodness, that's unusual.

A.3:  Well, do you have any, uh, children, or are you in college?

@B.4:  Mine are, well mine are grown, and, uh, of course, uh, I've
already been through this with them --

A.5:  I see, well.

B.6:  -- and I guess I'll have to help with grandchildren one of
these days, I hope.

A.7:  Certainly, and where did your, uh, children go to college?

B.8:  Well, one went to A and M, and one went to um, uh, oh,
Stephen F Austin, and one went to North Texas and one went to
University of Texas at Dallas --

A.9:  Well, that's great.

B.10:  -- and one of them ended up at El Centro in one of the, uh,
specialized programs --

A.11:  I see.

B.12:  -- and another is putting herself through right now back at U
T D.

A.13:  Well, that's  great, I'm the director of admissions at U T D.

B.14:  Oh, well, good.  Well, I'm glad you let her in [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter] Well, what advice did you give them when they were
choosing their colleges?  It looks like they, uh, you have a
variety there.

B.16:  Well, the main thing was, uh, what is it you want to study --

A.17:  Well, 

B.18:  -- and where is the best place to get what you need, and how
far is it from home, [laughter] I had to put in, and then, of
course, we also had to include how much is it going to cost. 

A.19:  Well, you're going right down my list --

B.20:  Yeah,

A.21:  -- uh, the first thing that I always talk to students about
is the academic program, because if we don't have what you're
looking for, it isn't going to do you any good, no matter how bad
you want to come here.

B.22:  That's true, that's true.

A.23:  And, uh, cost is always, uh, usually next on the list,
especially for the parents --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and, financial assistance and scholarships, and usually
then we talk a little bit about, uh, the size of the school and,
uh, different types of organizations and activities that they can
get involved in, and of course, distance from home and size of
classes and --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- it sounds like, uh, from your experience you know how to
go right down the list with them.

B.28:  Well, you have to be practical, because, I know, um, our
first daughter went to Stephen F Austin, and, uh, her allergies
acted up in the Piney Woods, and it was too far from home and she
got lonesome, and that didn't work out for her, so, I guess I
learned on that one.

A.29:  Yeah, you know, it's interesting, especially when, uh, my
experience, uh, has always been at a public university, and a lot
of the students in that home town, uh, sometimes shun the idea of
staying and going to school across the street, so to speak --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- but, uh, it always seems like at the beginning of the year
they're talking about, well, I'm going to this state --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and I'm getting out of here, and I'm going way over
there --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and a lot of times when it gets right down to the
practical aspect of it, they end up staying pretty darn close to
home because they can save money --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- as far as housing, and, uh, laundry [laughter].

B.38:  Laundry and food.  I think food has a lot to do with it, too.

A.39:  You bet, [laughter] it sure does.  

B.40:  And mother doing the laundry [laughter], especially with the
boys.  The girls it don't seem, the laundry isn't that, quite
that important, because they seem to know how to handle that
better, but the boys, it's that laundry that throws them there
for a while.

A.41:  Sure.

B.42:  Even when they know how to use the washing machine.

A.43:  [Laughter]  Well, there's a little barrier around the washing
machine and the dryer --

B.44:  Oh.

A.45:  -- and for some reason men just can't get around that barrier
[laughter].

B.46:  Well, we'll have to give them a pass key, I guess.  

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  Do you have, uh, more than the one daughter to plan for?

A.49:  Uh, I have a daughter that's a seventh grader and then I have
a son that's a sophomore at Shepton {spelled phonetically} High
School --

B.50:  Okay.

A.51:  -- and so, it's, uh, it's been interesting them, uh, sign up
for appropriate course work and things, and --

B.52:  Uh-huh, well.

A.53:  -- they're, they're on the college bound track at least.

B.54:  That's good.  Do you find that, uh, the boy is going in a
different direction than the girl as far as what his, uh, um,
needs are and the type of college he wants?

A.55:  Well, uh, they certainly have two different personalities --

B.56:  Well, yeah.

A.57:  -- but, uh, in terms of needs, the older son is interested in
the medical field --

B.58:  Good.

A.59:  -- and, uh, at this particular point, you know, taking
appropriate course work but really nothing that's out of the
ordinary --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and the daughter has indicated that she wants to get a
degree in, uh, business, um --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- and then go on to become President [laughter].

B.64:  Okay.  I'll vote for her if she --

A.65:  Sure.

B.66:  -- has good track record.  

A.67:  You bet.  And,

B.68:  Hope I'm around to do so.

A.69:  Well, I, uh, you know, we're, we, we try to be conscious of,
uh, of the, uh, equal, uh, equal rights and, uh,
