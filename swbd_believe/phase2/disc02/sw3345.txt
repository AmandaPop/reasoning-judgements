=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, you keep up with current events?

@B.2:  Um, somewhat.  Yeah, somewhat --

A.3:  Not,

B.4:  -- not as well as I would like to probably --

A.5:  Is that right?

B.6:  -- but that's the way it goes.

A.7:  Yeah, where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania.

B.8:  What?

A.9:  Where in Pennsylvania?

B.10:  Um, State College, I go to Penn State.

A.11:  Oh, do you, well, great.

B.12:  Yep.

A.13:  How's, uh, well no, we're not supposed to talk about that.  We're supposed
to talk about current events.

B.14:  Right, exactly, uh.

A.15:  Well, I'm a current event junkie.  So I, I watch, I try to watch the news,
and I read the newspaper, and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine
to keep up with what's going on in the world.

B.16:  I see.  

A.17:  (( )).

B.18:  Well, what particularly are you interested in?

A.19:  Well, I just, pretty, uh, little, you know, about everything.  And, not --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and then again not everything, but you know, I like to know pretty well
what's happening.  Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I
do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently,
you know --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- but, uh, other than that, uh, I just, you know, just the events that
happen around the world interest me.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Stay in touch with it and know, feel like I know what's going on.  Now I
have to say all three of my children, [laughter] none of them are too
interested in current events.

B.26:  [Laughter] I see.

A.27:  But I always have been --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and I stay up with it.  But, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware
of most of the current events.  Uh, newspaper?

B.30:  Um --

A.31:  T V news, or what?

B.32:  -- uh, well, some of both.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  I read, I read the newspapers sometimes --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and I watch C N N, that sort of thing --

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  -- occasionally --

A.39:  Yeah, that's good.

B.40:  -- and I read magazines, and such.

A.41:  Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.

B.42:  Well, yeah, I mean, not, not that badly --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- anyway, so I am, I am interested in what's going on, and I'm
particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about
Haiti recently --

A.45:  Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.

B.46:  -- because I've been down there --

A.47:  Oh, you've been there --

B.48:  -- and, yeah.

A.49:  -- well, you would be interested in it then.

B.50:  Right, exactly.

A.51:  Yeah, uh, I follow it, you know, I don't just read everything about it, but
I'm always aware of what's going on like that --

B.52:  Yep,

A.53:  -- and, uh, because it is, it's interesting --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and, uh, I don't know, I feel sorry for those people down there, they've
just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know.

B.56:  That's true.

A.57:  I mean,

B.58:  They've never really had a good leader,

A.59:  ((through)) Papa Doc, I mean he was --
 
B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- a terrible tyrant --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- and I think it's been better since he died, but it's still been bad --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that
they overthrew, uh, I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too
good himself.

B.66:  Oh, yeah?

A.67:  Yeah, he was pretty, pretty much a, he didn't mind having people bumped off
for certain things, you know.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  But, uh,

B.70:  I see.

A.71:  It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than
they did at the time --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably
better than a lot of them, but, uh, but then again, who, you know, those
people are so used to it I guess it's the only thing that works.

B.74:  Yeah, so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?

A.75:  I think it's pretty darned good, I think we're lucky to have as good a
coverage as we have --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- I really do.  Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a
little to the extreme, the media does, but, uh, but, that's kind of
understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than
once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over, and I
listen to the radio --

B.78:  Right, right.

A.79:  -- so I, you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so
many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe --

B.80:  Yep.

A.81:  -- but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't
believe it could be better --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- I really don't.

B.84:  Yeah, well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be
better, but I,

A.85:  I #don't think so.#

B.86:  #would agree that# it's pretty good.

A.87:  I don't think our news could be better.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.

B.90:  Um.

A.91:  I don't see anything that they could do.

B.92:  Yeah, well, I think that, um, I don't know. 

A.93:  Well, you always --

B.94:  [Laughter] The, um,

A.95:  -- want to think everything can be improved upon --

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  -- I understand what you're saying,

B.98:  Right, I think that,

A.99:  But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as
they're going to get it.

B.100:  Well, that may be so, yeah.

A.101:  Uh --

B.102:  I think that --

A.103:  -- nothing is perfect.

B.104:  -- I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- how deep they dig into things and such.

A.107:  Well, that's true, I understand what you're saying, and then again, I
understand why they can't dig too much deeper, that's why we have C N N.

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- to dig deeper.

B.112:  Right.
