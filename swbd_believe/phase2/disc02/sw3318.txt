========================================================================

A.1:   Got to discuss movies.  You seen a movie recently, Mark?  

@B.2:   Uh, yeah, as, as a matter of fact, uh, most recently I saw,
uh, DEAD AGAIN.  

A.3:   I've heard that was real good.  

B.4:   Yeah, I li-, I liked it.  Uh, I went with a girl friend of
mine.  

A.5:   And enjoyed it, huh?  

B.6:   Yeah.  It's, 

A.7:   Who's the star?  

B.8:   Oh, jeez [breathing], you know, I don't even remember now. 

A.9:   But it was good.  Is it, it's not a comedy, is it?  

B.10:   No, it's, uh,  

A.11:   Oh, I know, uh, yeah, I know the movie you're talking about,
yeah, that guy and his wife star in it.  

B.12:   Yeah.  

A.13:   Brannigan, or something.  

B.14:   Yeah, I, I can't even remember -- 

A.15:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.16:   -- who's in it.  

A.17:   Where they were married years before or something.  

B.18:   Yeah, they were, they were married and then, uh -- 

A.19:   Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.  

B.20:   -- s-, the, let's see, who was it, the -- 

A.21:   Kenneth Braun.

B.22:   -- the, the mai-, the maid kills the wife and then -- 

A.23:   Oh, really.  

B.24:   -- the, the husband,  

A.25:   I didn't know the story -- 

B.26:   Yeah, the,  

A.27:   -- but I knew it got a good review.  

B.28:   Yeah, the maid kills the wife, and the husband dies years
later or something.  And --

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   -- they both come back as new people and it all kind of
happens again.  

A.31:   Uh-huh.  

B.32:   It was -- 

A.33:   I bet that was -- 

B.34:   -- it was kind of strange.  

A.35:   -- interesting.  Sounds interesting.  

B.36:   Yeah.  

A.37:   Well, I had the, I, I read the POST reviews, don't see too
many movies.  We rent a few of them.  

B.38:   Yeah.  

A.39:   We don't go to them, but I do enjoy the movies.  I guess the
most recent one I can think of that I saw was, uh, on the T-, on
the, you know, rental, was HOME AGAIN.  Did you see that?  

B.40:   Yeah.  

A.41:   HOME ALONE, I mean.  

B.42:   Yeah, I saw that, uh, j-, couple weeks ago as a matter of
fact.  

A.43:   D-, well, it's -- 

B.44:   I finally got to see it.

A.45:   -- been a little longer than that since I saw it, but it was
the first time I seen it.  

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   And I thought, boy, about three-fourths, boy, I thought, what
a, I can't believe this movie is so highly rated.  Until about the
last ten, fifteen, to twenty, thirty minutes of it, then it -- 

B.48:   Yeah.  

A.49:   -- then I was just rolling in the floor, just hilarious.  

B.50:   [Laughter]. 

A.51:   But I was -- 

B.52:   I think that's what it -- 

A.53:   -- really bored with it for -- 

B.54:   -- I think that's what it is.  

A.55:   -- so long.  

B.56:   Is it's that last, you know, fifteen, thirty minutes or so
that -- 

A.57:   That would make the movie. 

B.58:   -- people really get into it -- 

A.59:   Yeah.  

B.60:   -- and they go, hey, this is a good movie [laughter].  

A.61:   It was just hilarious.  

B.62:   Yeah.  

A.63:   But, I did enjoy that.  Well, what else have you seen lately? 

B.64:   Uh, [breathing] I also saw, uh, the last of the, uh,
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series.  Uh,  

A.65:   I never have seen any of those.  They must be good.  I like
some of those kind of movies.

B.66:   Yeah, uh,  

A.67:   Was this one pretty good?  

B.68:   This, this last one here wasn't very good at all.  

A.69:   It wasn't?  

B.70:   It, it was only like an hour and a half long -- 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   -- hour and fifteen minutes.  

A.73:   Oh, really?  I can't believe it was -- 

B.74:   And, uh -- 

A.75:   -- so short.  

B.76:   -- it was, I mean, it was just, boom, it's over --

A.77:   Uh-huh.

B.78:   -- and it wasn't very good.  The, the three D effect that they
have for the last twenty minutes of it was one of the worst I've
seen.  

A.79:   Uh-huh.  

B.80:   And, it,  

A.81:   And it truly is supposed to be the last of that series, isn't
it?  

B.82:   Yeah, it is.  Uh, the, uh,  

A.83:   Maybe it's a good thing they bury it, huh?   

B.84:   Well, the, the writer, director of the series is, is going on
to a new plot of, of horror.  I, I,  

A.85:   [Laughter]. 

B.86:   I saw his new movie commercial on the other day.  I don't
remember what it's called.  

A.87:   Oh, really.  

B.88:   Yeah.  

A.89:   So he's moving on?  

B.90:   Yeah.  

A.91:   Uh-huh.  

B.92:   On to another, -nother topic of, of horror, 

A.93:   Of horror fi-,   

B.94:   Yeah.  

A.95:   [Laughter]. 

B.96:   When you, when you -- 

A.97:   Well, it's been,  

B.98:   -- when you do it for so long, it's all you even basically
know how to do is horror films.  

A.99:   Well, that, but if, you, you know, if it's probably made him
a extremely rich man, too.  

B.100:   Yeah, most likely.  

A.101:   If it's successful, I guess, just keep with it.  

B.102:   Yeah.  

A.103:   Go to a different, different territory.  Seem that's sure done
wonders for old Stephen King, hasn't it?   

B.104:   Yeah, really [laughter].  

A.105:   Writing all those horror,  

B.106:   Even, even, even with crazy women that try to claim that he
stole their story and stuff like that.  

A.107:   Yeah, isn't that crazy.  

B.108:   [Laughter]. 

A.109:   I don't think he did.  Do you?  

B.110:   No, he's, he's got too much integrity to do something like
that.  

A.111:   That, and he's too successful, and --  

B.112:   Yeah.  It's just,  

A.113:   -- and too, too warped a mind [laughter].  

B.114:   I, I think it just happened that some woman looked like, you
know, kind of the character and everything -- 

A.115:   Yeah, and they say, Oh, that's mine.  He stole,  

B.116:   -- and she decided, Well, I can just say this is my story
{speaker changes his voice}.  

A.117:   They're trying to get some money.  

B.118:   Yeah.  

A.119:   That's all, basically all they're trying to do.  I, I would
think, anyway.  

B.120:   Yeah.  

A.121:   But, uh, but I can't [breathing], let's see, I'm trying to
think of another movie that I've seen lately, and I can't think of
one.  

B.122:   I, I saw another rented one, uh, friend of mine rented it.  I
can't remember the name of it.  

A.123:   Isn't that funny, you see,  

B.124:   Must not have been good if I can't remember the name.  

A.125:   You see them all the time and when you try to recall,   

B.126:   Yeah, yeah, you, you, I've, I've watched so many movies here
in the last few months just,

A.127:   Uh-huh.  

B.128:   You know, seeing ones that I haven't seen before.

A.129:   Well, it's good entertainment and it's, it's so easy to do. 

B.130:   Yeah.  Go to Blockbuster and get you a movie and, you know -- 

A.131:   Uh,   

B.132:   -- three or four people can watch it rather than paying six --

A.133:   Yeah.  

B.134:   -- seven dollars and,  

A.135:   Blockbuster's so successful.  I, we don't go to them.  We just
go, we don't watch that many, but when we do, we just go up here
to Grover -- 

B.136:   Yeah.  

A.137:   -- because on Tuesday, they're ninety-nine cents each --  

B.138:   Yeah.  

A.139:   -- for all their movies.  If you get down there in the
morning, you know, you can get some pretty darn good movies
[lipsmack].   But, uh, but, boy, Blockbuster, lot of people do go
to them, don't they.  

B.140:   Yeah, I've got a, a membership card at two different
Blockbusters.  

A.141:   Uh-huh.  Oh, one, one doesn't work at all of them?  

B.142:   No, they -- 

A.143:   Got to have,  

B.144:   -- they, they issue a different card for each Blockbuster.  

A.145:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.146:   It's, it's got their, their particular address on it -- 

A.147:   Yeah.  

B.148:   -- and stuff so that you don't try to take movies back to the
wrong Blockbuster.  

A.149:   Oh, I see.  Well, and it's successful, the way they're running
it, so -- 

B.150:   Yeah.  

A.151:   -- can't --

B.152:   I, 

A.153:   -- knock it.  

B.154:   I, I had moved for a while and that's why I got the other one
and then I came back home so I,

@@A.155:   Uh-huh [noise].  And you live in Richardson {speaker's voice
cracked}.  My wife just made her call.  She talked to someone in
Plano.
