A.1:  There.

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Okay.  I hope we've done it right [laughter].  

B.4:  Okay.  

@A.5:  Uh, we're supposed to talk about music.  

B.6:  Well, that's good because I'm a singer.  

A.7:  Well, good.  

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  What kind of singer are you?  

B.10:  Uh, in high school and college in the classical, lately it's been more
contemporary country.

A.11:  Oh, really do -- 

B.12:  Uh,  

A.13:  -- do you sing in a group or,  

B.14:  No, actually I do what's called carioca, uh, with a,

A.15:  Oh, tell me what that is.  

B.16:  [Laughter] It's a, a thing where you've got a background video that just
has the background music, the instrumentals and there, the video has the words
to the songs on it and you sing along with the, with the tape.  It's pretty,
they do it at a lot of different clubs.

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  Uh, like Dave and Buster's, and,  

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  

B.20:  Oh, little country bars and stuff.  

A.21:  And, and so you stand up in front of the,  

B.22:  [Noise] You get up in front of the audience and a microphone [breathing].

A.23:  And, and where, and are you looking at the words?  

B.24:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, they've got a little T V monitor on the stage, most places
do.

A.25:  S-, so who sees it?  Do you just see it?  

B.26:  Uh, the person singing sees the monitor and most places have a big screen
behind you.

A.27:  So that everybody sees it. 

B.28:  So that everybody can see the words, yeah.  

A.29:  Do they sing along?  

B.30:  Uh, not usually.  Unless it's a real ratty song [laughter]. 

A.31:  Well, how cute.  

B.32:  It's, it's fun.  

A.33:  So that way that keeps them from being able to have -- 

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- other, uh, or other musicians.  

B.36:  Uh-huh, yeah, it's, you, some of the places do carioca like once or twice a
week and then they have, like there's a, a country bar or country saloon I
used to go to --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- that they have, uh, country bands most of the rest of the week.  It's,
it's pretty neat, I like it.

A.39:  Well that, and, and,

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  and so you get up and sing it yourself.

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.43:  Well, great.  

B.44:  I, I, I had a, a music scholarship to college, but I didn't use it
[laughter].

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  So, what do you do?  

A.47:  Well, I'm a music teacher [laughter].  

B.48:  Oh, how neat.  

A.49:  I teach, uh, elementary music in Plano.  

B.50:  Oh. 

A.51:  And,  

B.52:  I don't know about elementary [laughter].  

A.53:  Huh?  

B.54:  I don't know, I think elementary would be good.  

A.55:  Well,  

B.56:  That would be interesting with the little kids.  

A.57:  It, it, it has a lot of, uh, very, uh, [lipsmack] rewarding parts --

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  -- and then the, there are lots of it that,

B.60:  [Laughter]. 

A.61:  you know, you feel like you're just a bouncer.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  Yeah, I, I, I can remember music back then.  

A.65:  And then the paperwork and all of that, but generally where I am, I, uh,

B.66:  [Noise].

A.67:  uh, uh, this has been the, the best situation in terms of not having a
lot of discipline problems --

B.68:  Oh, good.  

A.69:  -- and, and having children that really are pretty interested in, in music
in general.

B.70:  Um.  

A.71:  So, it's really been nice, but,  

B.72:  I think that's one reason I got out of music because I didn't think I
wanted to go into teaching [noise].

A.73:  Well, and, and,  

B.74:  And at that point it was either performing or teaching.  It was, like, oh,
well [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah, it, it's, and I think that's a real valid reason for not --

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- majoring in it.  My boys [breathing] were good in it, and [breathing]
they didn't e-, even, I mean, that was the reason.

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  They, they took a lot of it in college, but they didn't go on with it.

B.80:  Yeah, well, I, after college, I got out, got married, started working, or
started working, got married.  And I didn't sing for ten years, and I just
found carioca last October, I guess, and I was just thrilled.  I loved it.
It's, it's neat.

A.81:  Now, you didn't, you didn't sing,

B.82:  [Breathing]. 

A.83:  in, uh, uh, during those ten years, you didn't sing at all?

B.84:  Uh, not really.  Not in -- 

A.85:  Not even like in church choir?

B.86:  -- not anything, not anything organized, no.  Periodically, if we'd go to,
like, a Christmas Eve services where they do the, part of Messiah or something
like that --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- but that was about it.  

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  But, back in high school, I was more of a classical kind of stuff.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  Through Wagner and Chopin and -- 

A.93:  Yeah, things that they -- 

B.94:  -- and Schubert and,  

A.95:  -- they have you do during high school.  

B.96:  Yeah, yeah, the things you have to do for competition [laughter].

A.97:  Well, what, what is your, uh, [lipsmack], uh, what is your voice, is it
alto or,

B.98:  Uh, in high school I was from second soprano down to tenor, believe it or
not.

A.99:  My goodness.  

B.100:  [Laughter]. 

A.101:  I kind of wondered.  

B.102:  I, I sang tenor a lot in church [laughter].  

A.103:  I kind of wondered if your voi-, if you, uh [lipsmack], might,

B.104:  [Noise].

A.105:  be, you know, old, usually country singers -- 

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  -- uh, or folksingers have lower voices.  

B.108:  They, yeah.  

A.109:  That's, 

B.110:  That's, I found a lot of stuff like Anne Murray -- 

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- she, I have to,  

A.113:  Ooh.  

B.114:  That's one thing neat about carioca, you can change pitches, I mean change
the keys.

A.115:  Really?  

B.116:  And her stuff I normally have to take up at least a step, if not a step and
a half [noise].

@@A.117:  Is there the back-, uh-oh, they're prob-, I wonder if that means they've
cut us off.  I heard a little,

B.118:  Oh, okay.  

A.119:  I, I can't remember.  I've only done this one other time.  

B.120:  Oh [laughter].  Good, I don't feel bad [laughter].  

A.121:  Are you doing this, uh, as a fund-raiser?  

B.122:  No, my, I'm in a sorority, but we decided not to do it --

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  -- for the sorority.  My boss, his wife is one of the, uh, the s-, the
transcribers --

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- for the tapes.  

A.127:  Uh-huh.  

B.128:  And he was, like, do you want to make some money?  Okay, here [laughter].

A.129:  [Breathing]  My, it's an easy way to do it.  

B.130:  Yeah, it is.  

A.131:  Well, we're doing it in our church choir.  

B.132:  Oh, now that's a neat idea.  

A.133:  And it's a supposed to, you know, be, uh, a really, I mean --

B.134:  That's, 

A.135:  -- th-, a lot of, they've already made a lot of [noise] money on it.

B.136:  Wow.  

A.137:  So in the,  

B.138:  Now, that, that would be a good idea.  

A.139:  Yeah.  

B.140:  Yeah, I proposed it for the, uh, for, I'm in a service, or, actually it's a
social sorority, and it's Beta Sigma Phi, and they decided, no, that we
wouldn't, not everybody might be able to make all the calls, so it's like,
okay, that's fine, I'll do it for myself [laughter].

A.141:  Well, I just decided I would do it once, try to do it once a night.

B.142:  Uh-huh.  

A.143:  And, uh, and I, I mean, I just started [laughter] doing it this week, but,
uh, the first time we had to talk on exercise and this --

B.144:  Well,  

A.145:  -- time music.  

B.146:  [Laughter].  

A.147:  So,
