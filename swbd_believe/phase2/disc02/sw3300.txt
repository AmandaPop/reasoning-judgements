=======================================================================

B.1:   All right, so, we started recording already?  

A.2:   Uh, I guess, [laughter] I don't know.  It's the first time
I've made a phone call on it.  

B.3:   Oh, so you pressed one?  

A.4:   Right.  

B.5:   Okay.  So, I guess we're supposed to start talking.  Uh
[noise], what kind of books do you read?  

@A.6:   I read, uh, a lot of Steven King, Dean R. Koontz, uh -- 

B.7:   Uh-huh.  

A.8:   -- some Danielle Steel.  My aunt got me hooked on those
[laughter].  

B.9:   Uh-huh.  

A.10:   So I, 

B.11:   So it's mostly all novels?  

A.12:   Yeah, they're all novels.  

B.13:   Okay.  

A.14:   I'll read some, uh, classic, too.  

B.15:   Oh, like what?  

A.16:   Uh, [breathing] like ((THE GRADUATE)) by Steinbeck.  I'll,
uh,  

B.17:   Yeah, I like that.  I like Steinbeck a lot.

A.18:   A, A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner.  That's one of my favorites.  

B.19:   I have never read a lot of Faulkner.  

A.20:   Oh, and this, this is more of a play or something that, that
it was from, that, that I saw and I read the book from that.  

B.21:   Oh, cool [noise].  

A.22:   And, by the way, my name's Bill.  I'm from North Carolina 
[laughter].

B.23:   I'm Doug, I'm from Pennsylvania.  

A.24:   Uh, I, [lipsmack] let's see.  What kind of books do you
like to read?  

B.25:   Uh, well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, uh, fair number of
novels, but mostly shorter ones.  And, like, I don't really like
the, you know, six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all
that.  

A.26:   I really have to be in the mood.  

B.27:   Right?  

A.28:   I, I read one, like maybe once a year.  

B.29:   Uh-huh.  

A.30:   [Laughter] I'm not as,  

B.31:   No, like, I like, say, uh, Richard Broudigan a lot.  Uh,  

A.32:   I've never read anything by him.  

B.33:   Okay.  He's, uh, he's dead now, but he was really a pretty
amazing writer.  He wrote books that were, like, pretty short and
pretty easy to read, you know, like written at a third grade level
or whatever.   

A.34:   Yeah.  

B.35:   But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very
funny.  Like, He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.  

A.36:   Okay.  

B.37:   So that's, anyway, and, uh, I read a lot of non fiction books,
too.  Uh, let's see,  

A.38:   I like to read a lot of non fiction history when -- 

B.39:   Uh-huh.  

A.40:   -- Civil War era and, and that kind of thing.  

B.41:   Uh-huh.  

A.42:   I found that real interesting.  I'm reading THE LION AND THE
WIND right now.  And that was on T V. 

B.43:   Now what's that?  

A.44:   It was, uh, [lipsmack] [static] during Teddy Roosevelt's
time.  

B.45:   Uh-huh.  

A.46:   And, uh, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, uh,
[noise] Morocco.  

B.47:   Yeah.  

A.48:   Uh, this is when they were having their revolution --

B.49:   Uh-huh.

A.50:   -- or whatever and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really
portrays him as a, [static] kind of a crazy man, you know.  

B.51:   Yeah [laughter]. 

A.52:   [Breathing] Surprised me.  I had no idea that he was like
that.  

B.53:   Uh-huh.  What, how crazy?

A.54:   Well, just like s-, some, one quote that he had was that he
thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle, 

B.55:   [Breathing].

A.56:   and it should be a grizzly bear because -- 

B.57:   Oh, sh-, [breathing].  

A.58:   -- you, you know, like the t-, t-, grizzly and stuff like
that.  So it's, I saw the movie and that's what made me want to
read the book.  

B.59:   Uh-huh.  

A.60:   Candice Bergen was in the movie.  I'm a real big fan of hers
so,  

B.61:   Yeah.  Cool, see, I also read a lot of books about music
because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about
science and also philosophy things.  

A.62:   Uh-huh.  I like, I like to read --

B.63:   Like, 

A.64:   -- some of the philosophy stuff.  

B.65:   [Music] Uh-huh.  Like, let's see, and even like
reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in,
like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE
BODY.  

A.66:   Yeah, I think that,  

B.67:   It's all about -- 

A.68:   I'm fascinated by that.  

B.69:   -- how to have out of body experiences and all that.  

A.70:   Yeah, I'm fascinated by that.  

B.71:   Uh-huh, [breathing] yep.  

A.72:   That, and, and, uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories,
but real encounters with ghosts and -- 

B.73:   Uh-huh.  

A.74:   -- supposedly haunted houses.  I like, I'm kind of a doubting
Thomas and I like to read stuff like that.  Some of it really -- 

B.75:   Yeah.  

A.76:   -- freaks me out [laughter].  

B.77:   Uh-huh [breathing].  Right, [noise] definitely {pause}.
Uh,  

A.78:   And I like to read, uh, [breathing] I like to read some
self help books like, uh, I read DIANETICS once, once I got past
all the gibberish on it.  

B.79:   Uh, did you like it?  

A.80:   It was okay.  It, it, it, it took me a while to really get
into it.  It, it didn't help me that much [laughter]. 

B.81:   Uh-huh.  I see. 

A.82:   But, uh, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in
your ways. 

B.83:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.84:   Uh, then I, one in-, real interesting book I read recently
was, when I was looking for a job, I read, HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT
YOU WANTED and, it, it had real good tips and it, and -- 

B.85:   Uh-huh.  

A.86:   -- I got the [laughter] job that I wanted by applying the, the
methods that, that,
