REMARKS:        Talking on top of each other a lot.  Speaker B is very
soft-spoken; some difficulty even when he was the primary speaker
in the monologue.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Um, we, our subject is golf.

B.2:  And that's a good subject that I like to talk about.

@A.3:  Well, good because,

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  I thought, My goodness, I'm, I'm a definitely a beginner at golf.

B.6:  Oh, are you.  Do you play?

A.7:  Um, I took lessons a couple of, not last spring, but spring before last,
and, uh, I really enjoyed it, and I had taken years ago, and I never could see
that what I was doing was causing that little ball to do anything.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  And so, um, but when I took this time, you know, it actually went up in the
air and, and, I, I mean, I could see that what I was doing made a difference
--

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- and so, um, my husband and I, uh, took together.  He had played some --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- already, and then we started #playing some# --

B.14:  #That's the way to do it,# yeah.

A.15:  -- and, and we played in the summer a few times --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and then I teach, and I don't have time to during the school year much,
but, um,

B.18:  Right.  Well, you got weekends.

A.19:  Well, it just seems like it just is all,

B.20:  It takes a lot of time,

A.21:  It really does --

B.22:  Yeah, it does,

A.23:  -- and then, uh, and in the spring we, we've been lucky enough to go to
several of those tournaments around here, the, uh, [lipsmack] one at Las
Colinas --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and, uh, the By-, Byron Nelson, and I've loved watching --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- so I'm, I'm definitely a good spectator for --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- not so much on T V, but, you know, for live.

B.30:  Well, I even, I enjoy it on T V, uh, once you get into it a little more,
you'll enjoy it on T V also.

A.31:  Well, now, you know, actually I have occasionally watched a little of it,
and I never did ever before I took these lessons.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  My, my son, uh, plays golf and he's, oh, he loves to watch it on T V, so I
guess if you play a lot you,

B.34:  Yeah, the more you get into it, you'll, you'll really enjoy it on T V too,
I think --

A.35:  #Right, well, how,#

B.36:  -- #(( ))# I know it does,

A.37:  Well, what about you?

B.38:  Yeah, I play all the time.  Well, not all the time, but I try to get in at
least, we play where, there's a little course down in East Texas, and we go
down there a lot.

A.39:  Where is that?

B.40:  Mount Vernon.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, uh,

A.43:  Now is that very far?

B.44:  No, it's a hundred miles.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  I'm originally from there, and we go down nearly every weekend, my folks
live there, so --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- we have a place to stay --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and, uh, it's, it's just so much fun when you got a regular group of
your buddies to play with.

A.51:  Sure.

B.52:  So that's what I do.  And my wife took it up about two or three years ago,
and she's, she's enjoyed it a lot, but it's hard to get the girls to play, you
know.

A.53:  Uh-huh, it is.

B.54:  And, uh, so, she doesn't really get to play, you know, enou-, enough --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- not nearly enough --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- although she does, she and I play sometimes, you know, and she enjoys
it.

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  And she enjoys playing with the girls, but heck, most of the time they're
not all playing.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  And, of course, I've got a group that I play with --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- so it makes it a little bit difficult there, but we enjoy it, it's a lot
of fun, and, uh, one of the best parts about it, once she took it up, was when
we'd go on a little trip somewhere, not long trips or anything, but just
little trips, you know, well it was always real good to take our clubs, and
she could, we could play golf --

A.65:  Oh, I know, I think that's --

B.66:  -- whereas before --

A.67:  -- #that's great.#

B.68:  -- #I probably wouldn't even get# to play, you know.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  And now she enjoys playing with me, and, and we, you know, it, it just
makes the trips more enjoyable for me.

A.71:  Sure.

B.72:  So, uh,

A.73:  So, how long have you been playing?

B.74:  Oh, I've been playing probably twenty years or longer,

A.75:  Oh, wow.

B.76:  I didn't start it nearly as young as I should have.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  I think I was about twenty, uh, I don't know, I guess I've been playing
longer than that, since I'm fifty, I've probably been playing, uh, twenty-five
years.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Well, um, that, I mean, that's what they all say, is that, you
know, that's one of those things that you just can't start young enough.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  Well, you, most, uh, well you think you'd be better if you started
early.  I'm not so sure that's true.

A.81:  Especially, I guess, if you start early and --

B.82:  #Yeah, some, some people,#

A.83:  -- #you get, get good lessons,# and you do it right, I guess.

B.84:  That helps, but then some people are just good at it, and some are not.

A.85:  I, I guess so.  It really is interesting.

B.86:  Uh, now, now you're going to improve, and it helps to take lessons and play
a lot, you're go-, definitely going to get better --

A.87:  So,

B.88:  -- but I'm talking about the difference from being a mid nineties to low, a
high, I mean a low nineties to a mid eighties shooter, which that's what I am
--

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- to being a guy that shoots in the low seventies.

A.91:  Oh, my, 

B.92:  That doesn't sound like a #lot of difference# --

A.93:  #well you're doing real well,#

B.94:  -- but believe me, it's a lot of difference,

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  it really is [laughter].

A.97:  Well, um, [lipsmack] uh, di-, and so, do you play around here some?

B.98:  I used to play around here all the time, but I don't any more, we just, I
just play down there now.

A.99:  Uh-huh.  Where would you play here?

B.100:  Uh, my favorite courses around here are, uh, Fire Wheel --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- and, uh, I, I like Chase Oaks real well, but it's kind of expensive.

A.103:  Oh, so is Fire Wheel not as expensive?

B.104:  No, it's a, it's a municipal course. Garland owns it.

A.105:  Oh --

B.106:  #City of Garland own-, and that's,#

A.107:  -- #well I, course, have you ever# played at Plano?

B.108:  Oh, yeah, Plano's a good course.  I've played there, oh, gosh, ever since
it's been there.

A.109:  Well, well --

B.110:  Many, many times.

A.111:  -- is it comp-, well, we've played, that's --

B.112:  #It's an excellent golf course,#

A.113:  -- #where we've played mostly.# We've played at Chase Oaks, too, but, um,

B.114:  Chase Oaks is difficult.  You really need to be a good golfer to play Chase
Oaks.

A.115:  Oh, horrors, I mean, we just lose --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- jillions of balls, and,

B.118:  If you're not a really good golfer, don't waste your time,

A.119:  That's discouraging, isn't it [laughter]?

B.120:  Yeah it's,
