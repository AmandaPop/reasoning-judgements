A.1:  Pets?  

@B.2:  No, as a matter of fact I do not have any pets.  

A.3:  You don't.  

B.4:  No, I'm, I, uh, travel -- 

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- quite a little bit with my work.  

A.7:  Okay.  

B.8:  And I love pets, I mean -- 

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- you know, I have friends who have cats and dogs and all that --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- but since I'm out of town so much, I, uh, am hesitant -- 

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  -- to get a pet because I don't [breathing], you know, I, I feel that such,
I feel it's a responsibility.

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  You know, and I would want to be a, a good pet owner and I do have friends
that, uh, you know [breathing] go off and leave their pets for what I think
are just long periods of time --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and that seems so cruel to me. 

A.19:  It is.  You know, I, you know, I'm home all the time [laughter], or not all
the time, but, uh, you know, I'm home at night and everything and I do have a
Siamese --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- cat, and we lived up in South Dakota and I got her there at the Humane
Society.

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Somebody had dropped her off, but, uh, she's got a crooked tail and the
whole bit [breathing].

B.24:  Yeah, well, you know, it's so m-, so often, the, uh, the animals that come
from the pound --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- are the best ones.  

A.27:  Oh, she's great.  She's, you know, she's a character.  She'll sit with
anybody, she'll play with anybody.

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  And she's, you know, a, a great cat.  

B.30:  Well, you know, it's [throat_clearing], it's funny, I mean, I, I know, I,
really, I'd like to have a pet.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  I'm single and I know that, you know, there's a great therapeutic value --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- uh, but like I say I'm, I'm at this particular juncture in my life I, I
don't feel I would be a, you know, a good, uh, uh, parent if you will, for a,
for a --

A.35:  Right.  

B.36:  -- pet.  But, I know my parents, uh, had had, uh, a pet for years and then
they, that dog died --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- and they went for several years that they didn't have a pet --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- and now they've got a German Shepherd that they are just nuts about.

A.41:  Oh, great.  

B.42:  And it's, you know, and it's great to see that becau-, and you can just see
that, that, you know, it adds something to their lives.

A.43:  Yeah, it's, it's great.  My husband is gone a lot -- 

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- and so she's great to have around -- 

B.46:  Good company.  

A.47:  -- you know, when I'm, you know, sitting here by myself and, and have
somebody, at least something in the house --

B.48:  Right.  

A.49:  -- you know, besides sitting here by myself.  

B.50:  Right.  

A.51:  But, that's a good thing, I think when people are alone a lot --

B.52:  Have you ever,

A.53:  -- then I think they're a great thing.  

B.54:  Have you ever thought of getting her a companion cat?  

A.55:  No, she's one that will not handle another cat.  

B.56:  Is that right?  Very territorial, huh?  

A.57:  Right.  Uh, when they had her at, at the Humane Society, she was okay as
long as she was by herself.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  But as long, as soon as, I, what I'm thinking as what they're thinking is
that she was in a, in an environment with a lot of cats --

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  -- and what their, thing is she got the broken tail with, from a cat fight.

B.62:  Uh,

A.63:  And, uh, it looks like, well, she was declawed and everything when they
took her there and they just found her on the step and, uh, they're thinking
that she, they couldn't handle her being with the other cats.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  And so they left her there and so I got her and you can tell when she's
around other cats she'll pick a fight real fast.

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  But as long as she's by herself with us, it's no problem.  She's really,
she's great with people.

B.68:  How old was she when you got her?  

A.69:  One year old.  

B.70:  Yeah, was that, I mean, that's one of the things I've often wondered about.
If you get an animal that [breathing], you know, I, I always think about the
idea of getting them whenever they're very young --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- so it's, I kind of, always kind of wonder how well they adjust --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- or how long it takes them, you know, as an adult.

A.75:  Uh, she adjusted the, that same day.  

B.76:  No [laughter].  

A.77:  Yeah, she was great.  

B.78:  She said --

A.79:  You know, sh-,

B.80:  -- this is home, huh?  

A.81:  Yeah, she says, This is home, she knew right where the bed was, she laid 
on,

B.82:  [Laughter].

A.83:  my pillow, she, you know, did everything.  She laid on me --

B.84:  That's great.  

A.85:  -- on my stomach, and, you know, went right to the cat litter box --

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  -- and where that was and she was great.

B.88:  Yeah, I,

A.89:  I think she was a good cat.  It's just that the other cats were a problem
for her.

B.90:  Yeah.  I have a friend who has a, uh, a cat that she got from the pound.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  Well, actually I take that back, she didn't get it from the pound, she
found it in her yard.

A.93:  Oh, really.  

B.94:  Okay.  

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  You know, and it was, the poor cat was just a mess.  

A.97:  Um.  

B.98:  It was the most horrible looking thing.  

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  And, of course, her heart went out to it and she started feeding it and the
next thing you know, she had a cat.

A.101:  [Laughter].  

B.102:  And it turned into a beautiful animal, long hair --

A.103:  Oh, great.

B.104:  -- lot of hair, and, and odd markings and, I think it, you know, is a Heinz
Fifty-seven variety, but, really a, a --

A.105:  Oh. 

B.106:  -- handsome cat.  But the crazy thing about it is, this cat has a severe
allergy to fleas.

A.107:  Oh, really?  

B.108:  So she has to, she, she bathes the cat.  

A.109:  [Laughter]. 

B.110:  And the cat, with this special, you know, uh, uh, f-, medicine that the vet
gave her --

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- and which I had never heard of anyone bathing a cat, but it, you know --

A.113:  Oh. 

B.114:  -- fairly regularly.  She bathes this cat and the cat, you know, is not,
not particularly crazy about it --

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  -- but at the same time has kind of gotten used to it -- 

A.117:  Oh, yeah.  

B.118:  -- and it sits, really wild.  I, I couldn't believe it whenever she was
telling he, Well, I got to, you know, bathe my cat.

A.119:  Oh, my mom has a Himalayan, and she's grown up with ten kids in the house
and she has no more kids, and so this cat is just her baby.

B.120:  Uh-huh.  

A.121:  And it's a Himalayan longhair, you hear of that cat having beauty
appointments, 

B.122:  [Laughter]. 

A.123:  hair appointments, she goes gets her hair done and comes home with a 
bow --

B.124:  Uh-huh.  

A.125:  -- and the whole ten yards and it's just great [laughter].  

B.126:  [Laughter]. 

A.127:  My mom takes it, she thinks this is great.  

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  You know [laughter].  But she just, you know, she, the cat just loves it.
She sits there and gets her hair blow dried and everything and,

B.130:  Yeah, they said this, uh, friend of mine in Dallas [throat_clearing] --

A.131:  It's just funny.

B.132:  -- started off with just a couple of cats. 

A.133:  Uh-huh.  

B.134:  Now I think she's got three or four cats -- 

A.135:  Oh, really?  

B.136:  -- and a dog.
