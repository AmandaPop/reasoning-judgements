==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what I believe is one of the major pro-, uh, things that is wrong
with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way
that they need to be --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- disciplined right now.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  I agree with that.

A.7:  Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death --

B.8:  You were?

A.9:  -- about being disciplined, and the discipline that my daughter receives
now --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- in going to school is just totally different.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my
classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- these days in the classroom.

B.16:  Yeah, yeah.  From what I understand, they act up pretty bad [laughter].

A.17:  Yeah, that's right, #that's right.#

B.18:  #What, uh,# grade is your daughter in?

A.19:  My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade --

B.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt --

B.22:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.23:  -- the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.

B.26:  Oh, no, uh-huh.  They always had a paddle in our school.

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  Well, they, they just don't do that any more.

B.30:  I know.

A.31:  But the school system's afraid of getting sued --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.

B.34:  Yeah, yeah.

A.35:  And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share
towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still
don't have enough money towards --

B.36:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.37:  -- put in toward public school. 

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little
bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.

B.40:  Yeah.  Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we --

A.41:  Yes --

B.42:  -- approve it?

A.43:  -- supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or
not.

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.  I guess we shouldn't get
into that but,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  um, and what else, um, I think in some ways that they need to be more
careful of the teachers that they hire.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children
are in high school --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,

B.54:  No.  Really?

A.55:  Oh, yeah,

B.56:  Ooh.

A.57:  I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school
teachers --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in
our school.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  Um.

A.61:  Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the
school system.

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty
good job [laughter] right now.

B.64:  Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job.

A.65:  Uh-huh, so.

B.66:  But, then, what do I know, [laughter] --

A.67:  [Laughter]  #You don't have any children in school?#  

B.68:  -- #I don't have any kids.#

A.69:  Don't have any kids.

B.70:  No, none at all [laughter].

A.71:  Yeah, okay, so this is probably a real hard subject for you.

B.72:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

@@A.73:  Yeah.  Okay, well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.

B.74:  Okay.

A.75:  It was a joy in talking with you.

B.76:  Well, it was good talking to you too.  

A.77:  Okay, thanks.

B.78:  We'll see you, bye-bye.

A.79:  Bye.
