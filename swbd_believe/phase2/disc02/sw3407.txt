A.1:  What was your first name again?

B.2:  Bob.

@A.3:  Bob.  Okay.  Uh, how, how do you feel about, uh, gun control, Bob?

B.4:  It's, it's kind of like abortion.  It's kind of a touchy subject, but --

A.5:  Yeah, it is.

B.6:  -- um, I feel it, [inhaling] any person is, [breathing] has the right to be
armed, but, I don't think they should have an arsenal.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  I don't believe in, uh, automatic weapons.  I don't believe in, in uh,
having antitank guns and, um, I, I, there's just, there's just too many, uh,
weapons around.

A.9:  Yeah.  Uh, I kind of, I agree, I guess. I don't, I don't think that we
need, uh, um, these, these automatic or semiautomatic rifles even.  I mean I
don't really even care that the, I don't know if you hunt or not, but I don't
even care that some of the hunters say they, they like them, I mean.

B.10:  No, I'm, I'm,

A.11:  [Throat_clearing] That, you know, maybe they use for legitimate purposes,
but, they're all, you know, folks are getting them and using them for --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- [Laughter] not so legitimate, to say the least, purposes.

B.14:  No.

A.15:  What do you feel about, uh, um, how do you feel about a waiting period?

B.16:  Uh, I think that's a good thing in the sense that it, um, it stops someone
that is acting on a impulse.  However, uh, anyone that has a revenge factor in
mind is, is, is going to wait that out.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  Um, most, um, Dallas has, if you read in the papers recently, um, the, um,
uh, murder ratio in Dallas is one point seven, I think, per day --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- uh, and ninety somewhat percent of these know the perpetrator.  It's,
it's not, it's not criminals that are going out and killing people.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  It, it's people with guns that are, that are shooting other people.

A.23:  Yeah, it's probably not someone that's running down to the store and buying
one, either, is it.

B.24:  No.

A.25:  Probably someone who's got one already --

B.26:  Someone that's got one --

A.27:  -- yeah.

B.28:  -- and, and, and for some reason, whatever, um, they became, uh, enraged
or, uh, you know, uh, some of these are somebody's dating somebody's, uh, girl
friend or ex-wife or, um, a person that they know and, and it's, it's again,
something that, you know, it's, it's a, uh, it's a decision of, uh, emotion,
not, um, it's not something you can really control, you know.  I don't think
you can.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  I don't think you can regulate it.  If they don't use a gun, maybe they'll
use a knife.

A.31:  Um.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I mean, yeah, if someone wants to do
someone in, they're going to do it whether they have a gun or not.

B.32:  Sure.

A.33:  Uh, what do you think about that, um, that, uh, deal with the police
officer.  Evi-, evidently, um, I guess they speculate that it was teenagers --

B.34:  Well --

A.35:  -- that somehow got a hold of a gun.

B.36:  -- yeah, and, and you look at the, you know, drive-by shootings and things
like that with, with young, uh, people involved.  It's, it's a very volatile
situation, and it's a funny world that we live in.

A.37:  Yeah.  I, I, we just moved here about eight or nine months ago from, from,
uh, a little town in North Carolina --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and, uh, we had lived in Fort Worth before and then Houston for a while,
so we, we're, you know, we're accustomed to the big city, but my kids weren't,
and, and the age they are now, they're in, uh, high school and j-, middle
school --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and the high schools around here, um, man, police have come in and, and,
uh, you know, they got, they [laughter] raid the school and take out ten
revolvers, you know [laughter] --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- I mean, it's just, uh, uh --

B.44:  Sure.

A.45:  -- it seems like, um, you know, it seems like, and no, and that's not a
case of someone flipping out and running down and buying one, so a waiting
period isn't going to help that.  But it seems like that there ought to be
something that could be done [throat_clearing] to at least make it harder for
those kids to get their hands on guns.

B.46:  Well, that's parental control --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- and that's, you know, that extends beyond guns.  That extends to drugs
and everything else that, that is bad in our society, and, and we don't have
the [breathing] we don't have the parental control that we need.

A.49:  That's true.

B.50:  That's a, the-, there's no deterrent.  There really isn't, and, and you're
not going to stop, uh, guns from being on the streets.  Again, if they don't
use a gun, they'll use something else, and, and then you take away the fact
that somebody has a right to protect their property.
