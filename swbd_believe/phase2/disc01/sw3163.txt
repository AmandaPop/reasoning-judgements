REMARKS:        There is constant background noise behind Speaker B. 
However, it is not so loud as to interfere with the conversation.

==========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, well, originally, I guess women were, uh, in the house
cooking and, uh, cleaning and all of that good stuff.  

B.2:   Taking care of children.  

A.3:   Oh, yeah.  Uh, actually the children, they, they don't have as
many children these days.  

B.4:   That's right.   

A.5:   Because they've gone out to work and they're, uh, [breathing],
uh, well, the families are shrinking, the divorce rate is
up.  Uh, they're still trying to get the pay that, uh, the men get. 
Uh, I guess even farther back, uh, they, uh, used to not even have
sports for the women.

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   And, uh, then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and
playing sports and going out to work.  Uh,   

B.8:   Well, I, I was thinking, too, in terms of, in terms of this
[breathing], you know, the education is so different.  I think
women are so much better educated now than they used to be and I
think that makes a big impact on what women do.  

A.9:   Oh, sure.  

B.10:   Uh, also, I was thinking the clothing has changed so
dramatically.  

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   Uh, you know, like when you said with sports, [breathing]
I thought well [breathing], it was so limiting because of their
clothes.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   They weren't allowed to, to wear certain things and so then
they couldn't par-, you know, they couldn't participate in sports
because of it.  

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   So, uh, I thought that's, that's made a difference.  

A.17:   Yeah.  

B.18:   Uh, 

A.19:   Well, it's kind of ironic.  They're also [laughter] these days
they're trying, they're working their way back into the house.  

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   And they're trying to have the best of both worlds.  

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   And they're just now figuring out in the nineties that it's
not quite working.  

B.24:   Right.  

A.25:   And they can't have both.  

B.26:   Yeah.  

A.27:   So, uh, I guess they'll have to make a choice.  

B.28:   Well, I think so.  Or spend part of their lives doing one
thing and part of their lives doing another.  

A.29:   Right.  

B.30:   You know, it,  

A.31:   They'll just have to allocate that time.  

B.32:   Yeah.  Uh, be-, because really [breathing], it isn't that
long a period of time that you have to be home with children, uh,
comparatively speaking if you look, look through your whole, look
at your whole life.  Uh, and I do think there's real value in being
in the home.  Uh, I do sort of both, but, uh -- 

A.33:   Uh-huh.  

B.34:   -- you know, it, it is, it's an interesting topic.  I, the
thing that's been hard for me to believe, too, is that, how, how
short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's
always been amazing to me -- 

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   -- that that's been a relatively [laughter] short period of
time.  And I think that made a major impact on women's roles, uh,
you know, from that point on.  

A.37:   Well, I guess the men have definitely figured out that women
are as smart.  

B.38:   I [laughter], 

A.39:   [Laughter] There's a considerable amount more, uh, there's a
considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to
have been.  And, of course, you, like you said, they're more
educated.  

B.40:   That's right.  

A.41:   And, uh, we've, we've, uh, brought quite a bit to the world. 

B.42:   Well, and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty
to thirty years how that changes even more.  I think the impact
will be felt more and more as, as better educated women come into
the work force.  Uh, and more and more women come into the work
force.  

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   Uh, I, you know, it, it's going to just change things
drastically, I think.  

A.45:   Well, some women are actually leaving the husbands home with
the kids.  

B.46:   That's right.  

A.47:   [Laughter]. 

B.48:   That's right.  

A.49:   And, well, I don't want to talk about the husband's changing
roles, but, they're all, they're learning to cook now and to do the
laundry and, uh, all of those good things.  

B.50:   Well, I think that, you know, that one of the things that may
come out of this is to let people do what they're best at.  You
know, so people, uh, may, uh, men may stay home with children
better than some women may and so -- 

A.51:   Uh-huh.  

B.52:   -- whoever, you know, whoever does which role best, I think
should do it.  

A.53:   Uh-huh.  

B.54:   Uh, if, if people can compromise and do that kind of thing.  

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   That takes a lot of [laughter],  

A.57:   Yeah {faint}.  It's no surprise that, uh, movies like DANCES
WITH WOLVES have come out in the nineties -- 

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- and the influence, uh, with the men.  

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   And, uh, the changing of roles -- 

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- actually.  

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   Uh, that was a very good example of women in the nineties and
what's a real man and a real woman.  

B.66:   Yes.  

A.67:   You know, they, uh, they do a little bit of both, uh, the hard
labor and, uh, you know, the smart, the, uh, all brawn and no
brains [laughter] on --  

B.68:   That's right.  

A.69:   -- both sides.  

B.70:   That's right {pause}.  Well, I think that's all I have to
say.  

A.71:   Okay.  

B.72:   Do you have any,  

A.73:   Well, it was nice talking to you.  

B.74:   Nice talking to you.  

A.75:   [Laughter] Okay.  

B.76:   Thanks.  

A.77:   Thank you.  

B.78:   Bye-bye.  

A.79:   Bye.
