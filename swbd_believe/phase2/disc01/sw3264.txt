A.1:  Hi, Mark.  Where, where do you live?  

B.2:  Uh, I live in Richardson.  

A.3:  Oh, do you?  Okay, I'm in Plano.  

B.4:  Okay.  

@A.5: Okay.  Uh, what kind of music do you like?  

B.6:  Um, uh, rock and roll.  

A.7:  Rock and roll?  [laughter]. 

B.8:  Yeah [laughter].

A.9:  Me too.  {very faint}  That's pretty much, 

B.10:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

A.11:  what I listen to.

B.12:  I'm, I'm twenty-one so I'm in the, the new kind of rock and roll stuff.

A.13:  Oh, you're twenty-one?  

B.14:  Yes.  

A.15:  Okay, I'm twenty-three.  

B.16:  Okay.  

A.17:  So not much difference.  Yeah, I was a music minor in college. 

B.18:  {Very faint}  Oh.  

A.19:  So,

B.20:  Uh, I, I took a, uh, recording engineering class out in Irving with a guy
named Phil York.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  So I know how to run a sound ((room)) and everything like that.

A.23:  Well, that's neat.  

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  That's neat.  Have you ever recorded anything or,

B.26:  Oh, I did a band project for the class itself and then I haven't been able
to get anything with it since.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  I have some friends with bands and they don't even bother to ask me.

A.29:  Oh, really?  

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  That's when you find out who your friends are I guess.  

A.33:  Yeah, you do [laughter]. 

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  Oh, that wa-, that is neat.  I like that.  I've always wanted to be in a
band but,

B.36:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

A.37:  we just moved here in June, and I haven't been able to get settled that
much yet, but,

B.38:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

A.39:  I, I, I played piano for about sixteen years.  

B.40:  Yeah, my, I, uh, I think I took for about four years when I was younger and
I don't remember how old I was.

A.41:  Really?  Did you like it?  

B.42:  Yeah, I had fun with it.  As, as long as it wasn't too dull and boring
[laughter].

A.43:  Like MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB [laughter]. 

B.44:  Yeah.  The simpler stuff was a little more boring but,

A.45:  Yeah, I had, I taught for a while and, and the kids just, they just didn't,
you know after they got to a certain point they gave up.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  You know an-, and they tell you, 

B.48:  I think that's what --

A.49:  if you can't keep it interesting then,

B.50:  -- I think that's what happened to me.  

A.51:  Yeah.  They're, they're, you know, it's just kind of stuff because after
you go to a certain point,

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  there's, you don't feel like there's much more you can do.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  {Very faint} But, uh, 

B.56:  Basically all that's left is to stuck the music in front of them and let
them play.

A.57:  Right, because they'll do the rest on their own.  

B.58:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

A.59:  Because they know the notes now.  It's just they have to do it themselves
but,

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  My, my mom took piano for thirteen years, 

A.63:  Really?  

B.64:  when she was younger.  Yeah.  She still plays once in a while. 

A.65:  I bet she's good.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.68:  She does the Mo-, Mozart and Chopin,

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  and Beethoven stuff.  She sits down and plays all that, the hard stuff
that I never got around to.

A.71:  Yeah.  Uh, we had to give concerts and all that in college -- 

B.72:  Yeah.   

A.73:  -- with our majors, so.  Yeah, it's, it's tough [laughter]. 

B.74:  Yeah.  Now, now I play guitar.  

A.75:  You do?   

B.76:  Yes.  

A.77:  Um, bass guitar or, 

B.78:  Electric, 

A.79:  Electric.

B.80:  uh, rhythm.  

A.81:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I would, that's one thing I never learned to play, and I
wish I would have is guitar.

B.82:  I, I've never had formal lessons.  I just would sit down and listen to the
music and figure it out how to play it.

A.83:  Really?  That's great.  

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  I wish I had an ear like that because I can sight read -- 

B.86:  Yeah.   

A.87:  -- but I can't ear any, I can't hear or I can't, you know, listen to
something and play it.

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  That's real tough for me.

B.90:  Uh, the, the only other problem I have with it is that I've never learned
how to learn the, the notes for guitar.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  In other words, where the fingers would go for the different notes and
everything.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  And so when, if I ever have a conversation with somebody else that plays
guitar, they start naming off notes,

A.95:  [Laughter].  

B.96:  and I go, whoa.  You lost me.  Stop.

A.97:  Oh, just sing it to me [laughter]. 

B.98:  [Laughter] I, and so I can't read ((tabulates)) or anything else like that
that go along with it.

A.99:  Oh.

B.100:  So I just have to listen to the music and, you know, pick it out.

A.101:  Well, that, that's good though because then you can hear something and play
it,

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  instead of waiting for the music and,

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  Yeah, that would be good.  And that's even better for bands even, I think,

B.106:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.107:  to be able to do that.  Yeah, that's neat.  

B.108:  Mak-, makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you
just go, show me where it goes and I'll do it.

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  Rather than them going play an A, play an E, play a B.  

A.111:  Yeah, that, that is good.  I like that.  So like, um, what bands do you
listen to?

B.112:  Oh, I, I listen to the, the more heavier rock, uh, 

A.113:  Yeah.   

B.114:  Kiss, White Snake, Scorpions, 

A.115:  {Very faint} Yeah.

B.116:  stuff like that.  

A.117:  Um, I like Kiss but they haven't been out too long.  I mean they haven't
done anything recently.

B.118:  Well, they, ((so)), the rest of them came out, 

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  let's see, about two years ago.  

A.121:  Yeah, 

B.122:  They,

A.123:  and that was the one they came out without the makeup, and they haven't
been with makeup for quite a while have they?

B.124:  Right, uh, they took off their makeup back, their, it's my favorite group
that's why,

A.125:  [Laughter]. 

B.126:  I know a lot about them.  Um, 

A.127:  Uh-huh.  

B.128:  they took off their makeup in eighty I believe it was.  

A.129:  In eighty?  

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  Yeah, ((that)) was something th-, you know.

B.132:  They had, they had five or six albums since they took off their makeup.

A.133:  Yeah, I, I have the one and I can't remember what the name is now, but they
put all the, um, it was one of their, uh, best hits.

B.134:  Uh, SMASHES AND THRASHES and HITS.

A.135:  Yes.

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  That's it.  And I just love that tape.  

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  That is great.  But now they're trying to convert me because I just moved
here from South Dakota, and, uh, they're trying to convert me to Country and I
am just not [laughter],

B.140:  Fight them.

A.141:  I Country person.  

B.142:  Fight them all the way [laughter]. 

A.143:  Yeah, I'm just not a Country Western [laughter] person.  

B.144:  Yeah, I'm, I'm not either.  Uh, my, my dad listens to it and it just,

A.145:  Uh-huh.  

B.146:  it drives me up a wall [laughter].

A.147:  Yeah, I'm, that's one thing I d-, you would think in a, in a Midwest that
you would but I hav-, I never grew up that way.  So,

B.148:  Yeah.
