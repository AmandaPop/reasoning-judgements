=========================================================================

A.1:   Okay.   We're talking about capital punishment.  

@B.2:   Right.  

A.3:   How do you feel about that ((Lenore))?

B.4:   I am very much for capital punishment.  

A.5:   Well, wonderful.  I am too, one hundred percent. 

B.6:   My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   And I've been raised around prison --

A.9:   All your life.  

B.10:   -- prisons all my life.  

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   And I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the
crime, there's --

A.13:   There's no deterrent. 

B.14:   -- not any deterrent [laughter]. 

A.15:   That's right.  There's just no deterrent.  

B.16:   That's right.  

A.17:   And so many of those kind of people, they got, they have a
better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so, you
know, unless they really make it rough on them that's not a, going
to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I don't
think.  

B.18:   Especially not a federal prison.  

A.19:   Right.  Well, I don't know what Oklahoma's laws are but
Texas's I don't know are, [sigh] I don't know it's, it's no ones f-,
I mean it's not the judges fault I don't think.  It's just the
way the law is down here.  Man our cr-, our, uh, prisons are so
crowded that, uh, they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be
set free within a year to two.  

B.20:   Well, see we were under, uh, the states prisons were under a
mandate to, uh, it was over crowded and the federal came in and
said, hey, you know, you have either got to build more prisons or
let people go.  

A.21:   Well, that's what ours did, same thing.  

B.22:   And finally our governor at the time which who is not in
office now came in and said, okay, where we draw the line is no sex
offenders will be let loose.  

A.23:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.24:   Under early bail, you know --

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   -- or early, uh --

A.27:   Uh-huh.  

B.28:   -- ((get)) out.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.

B.30:   But, uh,  we have, the death penalty is not given often.  

A.31:   Huh-uh.  

B.32:   But there have been w-,

A.33:   It's not here either really.  

B.34:   And you know, I, maybe it should be, uh, well, it should be
given, you know, I, I won't say sparingly, but I do believe it
should be befitting the crime.  

A.35:   I do too and, and you know, but the way the courts are set up
they've, they've got so many chances for appeal, but I think th-,
I think it needs to be expedited.  You know if they've been
convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of, of a
crime that's deserving of, of a lethal injection, let's do it and
not waste so many years to do it.  

B.36:   Right.  Of course, you know, they're, they're entitled to a
speedy trial.  

A.37:   That's right.  

B.38:   But then they're, they're also entitled to drag it through the
courts --

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   -- for years and years --

A.41:   Uh-huh.

B.42:   -- and years on appeals.  So --

A.43:   Yeah.

B.44:   -- somehow, you know, it doesn't really balance out too much.  

A.45:   That's right.  Somehow it just doesn't, it works and then
again it takes too long for it to work.  

B.46:   And it seems even though, you know, that they ((got)), the
prisoner himself can come to the point that, hey, I'm tired.  I
just want out.  

A.47:   Uh-huh.  

B.48:   You know, I'm tired of fighting it.  

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   Then the system just keeps on.  

A.51:   Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, it equ-,

B.52:   And at that point you know I, I really think there needs to be
maybe a shorter appeal process.  

A.53:   I do too.  I think that needs to, and I don't see why it
couldn't be shortened considerably.  But, you know [laughter], 

B.54:   Well, part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.  

A.55:   Yea-, that's true.  It is overcrowded because there's so much
drug, uh, problem with the people on drugs because that ha-, they,
with the drugs they're, they're robbing and killing and, uh, that's
why it's filled the prisons up so much I think.  

B.56:   Uh, it doesn't, it doesn't help them any at all --

A.57:   No, it doesn't.  

B.58:   -- and, of course, your court system when you get into the
appeals, I don't believe criminal is in a court by itself.  And the
whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that
shouldn't be in there.  

A.59:   Yeah, that's true.  With all these lawsuits and people suing
people over ridiculous things but,

B.60:   We've gotten into a very litigious, uh, type of life.  

A.61:   Boy, haven't that we though.  We really have.  But anyway I'm
glad to hear that you agree with me on the [laughter] capital
punishment.  

B.62:   Well, I just,

A.63:   I'm, I'm very ((muchly)) for it.  Always have been, 

B.64:   [Laughter]. 

A.65:  always will be.  

B.66:   I just feel like their crime and punishment and if, if you
don't have the punishment, you double your crime.  And the, you
know, that is just personal feeling.  It's not going on facts.  I
think --

A.67:   It could be supportive.  It, it's --

B.68:   -- the facts would probably back it up but,

A.69:   -- it's supported with facts though.  

B.70:   What?  

A.71:   It could very easily be supported with facts.  

B.72:   Well, yes.  I,
