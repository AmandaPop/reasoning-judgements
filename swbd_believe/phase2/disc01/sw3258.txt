REMARKS:        The two women's voices were very similar and difficult
to differentiate.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, where do you work?

B.2:  I work at N C N B.  I'm a lawyer.

A.3:  Oh, okay,

B.4:  So.

A.5:  Um, so you probably wear the suits every day?

B.6:  I wear a suit [laughter].

A.7:  Yeah (( )) [laughter].  Um, I work at J C Penney Finance --

B.8:  Oh, okay.

A.9:  -- and I wear suits, um, sometimes, you know, the dress, a
nice dress or a nice pant outfit.

B.10:  Oh, you can wear pants?

A.11:  Yeah, as long as we have the nylons, and that, and heels
on --

B.12:  Wow.

A.13:  -- so that's kind of nice.

B.14:  I've worn them in the winter when it's like ten degrees, and,
you know no one's going to look,

A.15:  Uh-huh, well that's, see I just moved here from South
Dakota --

B.16:  Oh, oh.

A.17:  -- and now that's a change in wearing clothing.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.

A.19:  But, uh, they just got, uh, they're down to thirty degrees
now --

B.20:  Already?

A.21:  -- yeah, and they've gotten snow and the whole bit.  So when
I was there I would wear everything, you know.

B.22:  I didn't own a winter coat to wear to work until, um, two
years ago --

A.23:  Oh, really.

B.24:  -- I mean, my whole, what do, I graduated college in 
eighty-three --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and I have not bought one until two years ago --

A.27:  Oh, really,

B.28:  -- because you just don't need it.

A.29:  Huh-uh, you know, when I moved here, and it's, it's just
great.  I call back there and it's just, you know, it's wonderful
to be able to wear no coat, you know, and just a dress and, and
go to work.

B.30:  When did you get here?

A.31:  June first.

B.32:  Oh, so you got the summer.

A.33:  Yeah, and it wasn't too bad, um, because there they can have
both extremes.

B.34:  Yeah, I guess they, that, uh, 

A.35:  It can get really hot.

B.36:  It, it did not get hot here this summer.  

A.37:  That's what I was told, 

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  that it was pretty mild [laughter].  But that's when I
moved, and I left all my winter clothes with my mom in Nebraska.

B.40:  Don't, don't send for them [laughter].

A.41:  Okay [laughter].  I, I just brought a couple and it's like
they're still sitting in the closet,

B.42:  A couple.

A.43:  Yeah, I -- 

B.44:  You have more than one?

A.45:  -- oh I have six of them.

B.46:  Oh God,

A.47:  [Laughter] and all the e-, essentials --

B.48:  Um,

A.49:  -- but, yeah, you know, we just have to wear the nice clothes
and the, and which, I was really surprised that I wouldn't have
to be in the suit.

B.50:  No, we have, a lot of the women in our office even are
believe it or not, uh, banks are not that bad, and we don't meet
with customers --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- you know, we work for the, for the, um, oh, you know, we
work with the banking officers --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- so we don't have people come in and look at us.  And we
wear fun stuff, too --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- like, um, oh, shorter skirts, and [breathing] uh, a lot of
dresses,

A.57:  Yeah, I, I'd say, it-, it's, uh, probably eighty percent
dresses --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and, uh, once in a while we wear the pants --

B.60:  I just wear --

A.61:  -- but not too often,

B.62:  -- I just wear an old suit when I don't feel like, you
know --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- I feel like, I don't have any imagination today.  I'll get
this starched shirt out, and put a suit on [laughter].  

A.65:  I know this matches.  I'm not going to have to think about
this [laughter].

B.66:  Yes, (( )).

A.67:  It's the truth.  Oh, yeah, but I just started the job a few
months ago.  They just opened up, um, the new office that I'm
working at, and since we are located, you know, they located it
in Dallas --

B.68:  Are you in Plano?

A.69:  -- yeah, I live in Plano --

B.70:  Ooh.

A.71:  -- but they have it down on Hillcrest and, uh, L B J,

B.72:  That's up on Hillcrest and L B J [laughter].

A.73:  Oh, yeah, okay, yeah [laughter].

B.74:  But yeah, that's um, I'm, I'm more used to downtown --

A.75:  Okay.

B.76:  -- so, um, I never (( )) in North Dallas,

A.77:  Yeah, I haven't gone into downtown too much.

B.78:  Well, you don't need to --

A.79:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.80:  -- believe me, you don't need to --

A.81:  Yeah, I just,

B.82:  -- lots of street people.

A.83:  Yeah, my brother works down there in the building where the
Kennedy Book, or the library is --

B.84:  The School Book Depository.

A.85:  -- yes, and, uh, he, it's tough [laughter].

B.86:  Yeah, there are lots of bums on the street, and, uh, if you
go, I went to work this morning early, and I had to, I parked in
a fourteen dollar parking garage --

A.87:  Oh, you're kidding.

B.88:  -- well, uh, you know, I, I mean I got there at four o'clock
in the morning, and --

A.89:  Oh, wow.

B.90:  -- and, uh, I'm not going to walk, you know, walk anywhere
downtown at that time of the day --

A.91:  Uh-huh, um.

B.92:  -- and so you park where you can go directly in on the tunnel,

A.93:  Into the building.  Wow, I haven't, you know, I, I just
haven't gone down there, so, you know, it's pretty, it's like
where I'm from, here.  In South Dakota it wasn't a real popula-,
like Dallas has as many people as we did in our whole state.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  [Laughter] So, it's uh, a little different.  But I really
like it here. So.

B.96:  I'm glad. I'm a native, so I always like to hear that. 

A.97:  Yeah, I really enjoy it.  I, you know, we, we both graduated,
my husband and I both graduated from college and decided to move
here.

B.98:  Just like, decided to move here.

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter] He'd like to get his Master's at U T D.  

B.102:  Oh, okay.

A.103:  And, he liked that school, so we come here for him to start
that and, and, he has a Spanish, you know, degree, so, for him to
use that we had to get somewhere where that was useful,

B.104:  Yeah, except down here, it's a dime a do-, well --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- not really, if he's, if he's Anglo, you know, an Anglo who
speaks Spanish.
