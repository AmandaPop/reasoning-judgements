============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, for as far as, um, I would think the, probably the, uh, worst
substance that's probably, um, or, started to say the, uh, what causes the
most air pollution is probably the car --

@B.2:  Probably so,

A.3:  -- and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit
systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh,
train [laughter] or, or something like that or,

B.4:  Yeah, it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.

A.5:  Yeah, that's exactly it, and that's what we're finding, um, here, where
we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- that there are inconveniences to that, or maybe you don't like the
person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so
it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do
not carpool.

B.8:  I think so too.  I'm in Texas --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and very few people carpool --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know
for sure what time they're going to leave their job --

A.13:  Exactly.

B.14:  -- they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you
know,

A.15:  Uh-huh,

B.16:  they just feel they need their car.

A.17:  or if somebody gets sick. Yeah, or if somebody gets sick, and it's not
the other person --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- then they're, they're stuck, you're --

B.22:  That's right.

A.23:  -- definitely right, so,

B.24:  And people don't want to give it up --

A.25:  Yes,

B.26:  -- but now I think we've made great strides --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and [noise]
{telephone click} --

A.29:  Sure.

B.30:  -- and to change the car itself --

A.31:  Sure, that happens quite a bit,

B.32:  -- but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred
percent --

A.33:  Yes, yeah --

B.34:  -- but --

A.35:  -- that's very true.

B.36:  -- yeah.

A.37:  Uh, other than that, uh, I don't know,

B.38:  Well, my other line is ringing --

A.39:  Okay.

B.40:  -- but we're going to ignore it [laughter].

A.41:  Oh, okay, [laughter] we'll try to be real quick here.

B.42:  I'm sorry for these beeps,

A.43:  The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to
talk,

B.44:  Oh, close to five minutes, I believe.

A.45:  Five minutes, oh, okay.

B.46:  And you're in Minneapolis,

A.47:  Minneapolis area,

B.48:  Well, is the pollution really bad up there?

A.49:  Uh, actually no.  We have, uh, quite a bit, uh, the only problem that we
have and that's all over the whole world is ozone --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and of course hay fever season --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural --

B.54:  Yeah [sniffing].

A.55:  -- um, but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many
people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your
license tabs --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- you have to have your car inspected --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- or other pollutants, and if that's the case, then you have to get your
car fixed,

B.64:  Well --

A.65:  at least where you (( )).

B.66:  -- that's the way it has gotten here.  We have just had that law, I think,
about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas --

A.67:  Sure, yeah,

B.68:  -- but, uh, I think it's a good idea --

A.69:  Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

B.70:  -- because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- which you can't blame them for that --

A.73:  Sure, sure,

B.74:  -- and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have
them fixed --

A.75:  Exactly,

B.76:  -- and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in
Texas right now of controlling the C F C -s --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air --

A.79:  Sure.

B.80:  -- they're having to change the type of products they use --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- uh, they can't use, like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning
heating business --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain
type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst-, systems --

A.85:  Sure.

B.86:  -- therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they
have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed --

A.89:  Sure.

B.90:  -- and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type
of freons that do not release as many C F C -s into the atmosphere --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- it doesn't cost as much --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,

A.95:  Sure --

B.96:  But,

A.97:  -- uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air
conditioning, I'm sure --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- over there it's a necessity --

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  -- versus something up here we can live without it but it's 
uncomfortable --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed
to be done, and one of the cans [laughter] released entire amount --

B.104:  Um.

A.105:  -- of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it, and, I don't
know --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't
quite fully instructed onto that, and I was thinking how many other people --

B.108:  It's probably happened to millions of people,

A.109:  -- oh, sure, because --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- if you take it into a service station,

B.112:  [Sniffing].

A.113:  they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only
costs you about three dollars --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and
say, Hey, that's --

B.116:  Uh-huh

A.117:  -- that's right there.  I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can --

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  -- and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit
in a car, and I, I thought about that, and my husband even was kind of woozy
after that because I'm sure he breathed it [laughter] --

B.120:  Inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.

A.121:  -- but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and
things like that and,

B.122:  Yeah, well, of course in the, uh, I think you probably noticed in the
discount stores and places, in the hair sprays --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here --

A.125:  Exactly.

B.126:  -- nearly everything is in the pump squirt,

A.127:  Pump, yeah,
