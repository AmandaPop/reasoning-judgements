=========================================================================

A.1:   [Laughter] Uh, the only work I do outside the home is I am an
Avon representative.  

B.2:   Oh, okay.  

A.3:   And I sell family products.  

B.4:   Uh-huh.   

A.5:   And, uh,  

B.6:   Do you,  

A.7:   So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot. 
Do you work outside?  

B.8:   Well, I, I work, uh, I'm a C P A and I do contract work.  

A.9:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.10:   And so, and I work with another C P A  who just started his
own practice -- 

A.11:   Oh. 

B.12:   -- and I work with him a couple days a week -- 

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   -- and so when I go to his office or to other clients'
offices, then I'll dress up -- 

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   -- but otherwise it's great being at home -- 

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   -- in jeans or shorts or whatever [laughter].  

A.19:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.20:   So that, that makes it pretty nice.  It's -- 

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   -- kind of weird because before I used to work, you know, full
time and, and, uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day,
just about.  

A.23:   Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working
every day, I think.  

B.24:   Right.  

A.25:   Yeah.  

B.26:   Right, and so it's, uh, some of my suits I haven't put on for
[laughter] quite a -- 

A.27:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.28:   -- while.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   So it's, 

A.31:   It's kind of nice to relax a little bit.  

B.32:   It's, it's very nice.  

A.33:   Yeah.  

B.34:   Gosh,  

A.35:   Well, my, my dress up, I live out in the country also so -- 

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- what I wear depends on the weather.  

B.38:   Sure.  

A.39:   Uh, so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are
portrayed as being very dressed up.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience,
because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off
my shoes -- 

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   -- [Lipsmack] which I try to wear something easy to take
off, you know -- 

B.44:   Right.  

A.45:   -- and put on.  And I don't too often take off my coat even,
so, uh, I really don't have to dress up like y-, you would, like
if you're in an office or something.  

B.46:   Yeah, yeah.  Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're
in warm clothing quite a bit of the year.  

A.47:   Uh, well, not actually because -- 

B.48:   Not really?  

A.49:   -- we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say
warm weather.  

B.50:   Oh, is that right?  

A.51:   Yeah, and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather.  

B.52:   Uh-huh.  

A.53:   Uh-huh.  Course, they keep saying the weather's going to
change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here
[laughter], so I -- 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   -- don't know.  But for now,  

B.56:   So you all are waiting for that [laughter]. 

A.57:   But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime
and, uh, cold weather.  

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   And that type of thing.  

B.60:   Yeah.  

A.61:   Now, my daughter works all the time, so she dresses.  I think,
you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and 
that -- 

B.62:   Right.  

A.63:   -- because you do have to have the appearance, a good
appearance to do a good job -- 

B.64:   Right.  

A.65:   -- where you work.  

B.66:   Yeah.  Well, down here it's sunny most of the time.  

A.67:   Uh-huh.  

B.68:   And, uh, usually warm.  I mean, we had a few cool days, uh,
this month, but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had
so far.  

A.69:   Um, uh-huh.  

B.70:   So, I mean people are still wearing shorts and -- 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   -- and, uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler,
so -- 

A.73:   Uh-huh.  

B.74:   -- you start -- 

A.75:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.76:   -- you know, breaking out a coat --  

A.77:   Right, yeah.  

B.78:   -- at that time, but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few
months [laughter].  

A.79:   Did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full
time or did you -- 

B.80:   No.  

A.81:   -- did they wear more dresses and skirts.  

B.82:   No, never wore slacks.  

A.83:   No slacks.  

B.84:   It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not
like someone came out and said you can't wear them.  

A.85:   Uh-huh.  

B.86:   It was one of those understood things -- 

A.87:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.88:   -- that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress
or,   

A.89:   Uh-huh.  Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit
even -- 

B.90:   Not,  

A.91:   -- if it's all,  

B.92:   No, not, not with what I did.  Uh,  

A.93:   Uh-huh.  

B.94:   Most people didn't.  

A.95:   Uh-huh.  

B.96:   Sometimes, like the secretaries might -- 

A.97:   Uh-huh.  

B.98:   -- but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
And I really, you know, there's some nice pantsuits out and -- 

A.99:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.100:   -- and I wouldn't have mind-, minded, you know, wearing 
those -- 

A.101:   Uh-huh.  

B.102:   -- especially when it gets pretty cold.  

A.103:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.104:   [Lipsmack] But, uh,  

A.105:   I know my daughter mostly, I don't think she ever wears 
slacks -- 

B.106:   Uh-huh.  

A.107:   -- to work.  But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know,
if, uh,

B.108:   You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not
viewed upon as being professional.  I guess they -- 

A.109:   Uh-huh.  

B.110:   -- expect women to be in skirts [laughter] -- 

A.111:   Uh-huh.  

B.112:   -- or dresses.  

A.113:   Look more like a woman, huh [laughter].  

B.114:   Yeah [laughter].  That's right [laughter].  

A.115:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.116:   And it's the men that make the rules [laughter].  

A.117:   Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then
[laughter],  

B.118:   [Laughter]. 

A.119:   that way.  

B.120:   But, no, we usually, you know, skirt and, skirt and blouse or
suit or dress -- 

A.121:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.122:   -- is what you see down here.  So it's nice with me working
at home because I can wear pants.  

A.123:   Yeah.  

B.124:   No, no one can see me -- 

A.125:   Yeah.  

B.126:   -- unless I'm, you know, g-,  

A.127:   But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband,
too, though -- 

B.128:   Yeah.  

A.129:   -- at home.  

B.130:   Yeah.

A.131:   Because that's, I, I believe,  

B.132:   But, I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him [laughter]. 

A.133:   Oh, you don't think you will, huh [laughter]?  

B.134:   [Laughter]. 

A.135:   Well, you'll be excused because considering everything [laughter]. 

B.136:   Yeah, I think that the main issue at home --

A.137:   Uh-huh.

B.138:   -- is being comfortable -- 

A.139:   Yeah.  

B.140:   -- in your clothing [laughter].  

A.141:   But I, I look at homemaking as a job also.  

B.142:   Right.  

A.143:   Uh, being a homemaker and I, I think sometimes we lose sight
[laughter] of that.  

B.144:   Yeah.  

A.145:   Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,
