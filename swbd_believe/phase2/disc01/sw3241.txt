=======================================================================

B.1:  All right.

A.2:  Well, I still don't trust them, I'm sorry [laughter].

B.3:  [Laughter] You don't.

A.4:  I probably never will [laughter].

B.5:  I don't, I don't think they have enough control to really,
uh, to really do anything against us.  I don't think they're as
strong as we think they are, personally --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- but yeah, that I see wh-, I see your point because, you
know, they, they feed us propaganda and we never know what
they're thinking.

A.8:  That's right.  I don't trust them, maybe, I guess it's
because of the way, what happened over there with their own
people, how they threw them out of power, and, you know, just a
big uproar --

B.9:  Right.

A.10:  -- but then, you know, me and my husband always talk about
it, because they're running out of money --

B.11:  Sure.

A.12:  -- you know, and what are they going to do when they run out
of food, are they going to just attack us and take it [laughter] --

B.13:  Right.

A.14:  -- [Laughter] it makes you wonder, because, you know, we
already, we have enough problems over here, we don't need to be
trying to help everybody else --

B.15:  Right.

A.16:  -- which (( )), that gets on my nerves too, but,

B.17:  Well, I think taking, you know, when we took that, went to
war with Iraq, I think we, that was kind of a, uh, display of
power --

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:  -- and I think we shou-, I think the Soviet Union knows what
we have and knows [laughter] that we're pretty serious and if
they ever tried to do anything, we would, we would be on the
offensive.

A.20:  Yeah, but I don't, I think they have just as much, see, I
don't know, I, I think that they have better, like, you know,
when we go over in Iraq and Iran, that's a different country, but
I think, see, that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet
Union, they spent more money on, um, what do you call, um,
military power than anything.  They have more of an expense of
military than we do,

B.21:  Yeah, but are they going to have the backing from the people,
you know.

A.22:  Well now see, that's another problem is they have it in their
own thing with all this, uh, what do you call it, uh, breaking up
of the Soviet Union --

B.23:  Right.

A.24:  -- right now I doubt if they had the help of anybody in their
country --

B.25:  Right --

A.26:  -- they're having so many,

B.27:  -- because there's fifteen different republics,

A.28:  Right, now [laughter] --

B.29:  Yeah,

A.30:  -- it's like whoa [laughter].  So I don't know if they would
have, you know, but it just depends on when --

B.31:  Right.

A.32:  -- they do it, so.

B.33:  Right.

A.34:  I guess it would depend on what, what state that they're
in --

B.35:  Well.

A.36:  -- when they do it, but I still wouldn't trust them, not, I
would trust them only so much.  

B.37:  Right.

A.38:  [Laughter].

B.39:  I know I wouldn't think we shou-, you know, I don't think
it's a matter of trust even any more, I mean, it's just, Okay,
you lay this down, we'll lay this down, but --

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  -- that doesn't mean we, we're not, we're going to stop
watching you and making sure you're not, you know --

A.42:  Doing what you're supposed to do.

B.43:  -- right.

A.44:  But I think that's what they're trying to do is to get us to
do everything, you know, and them not really do anything, because
who's checking them.

B.45:  I don't know [laughter].

A.46:  You know, I think that not only, if we check them, they're
not going, it's just like coming over here in the United States,
the government don't tell you everything.

B.47:  I know it.

A.48:  [Laughter] They feel they don't have to, which I agree --

B.49:  Right.

A.50:  -- because if you tell everybody everything, everybody in the
world would know because they'd put in on T V --

B.51:  Right.

A.52:  -- [Laughter] and that wouldn't do us any good, so,

B.53:  Right, I just, you know, that, that's another thing that
scares me is our country [laughter] --

A.54:  They're so into T V,

B.55:  -- you know, what are we doing --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- what are they actually telling us, and after, you know,
what happened the other day with that, uh, C I A guy, you know --

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  -- how much is, what all the wars we're getting into and all
the, you know, the messes we're --

A.60:  That we really don't --

B.61:  -- we're bombing us, ourselves with --

A.62:  -- that we don't know about,

B.63:  -- right, is that true, or, you know, is it,

A.64:  How much,

B.65:  is (( )),

A.66:  of it's true, and how much --

B.67:  really a threat,

A.68:  -- and how much of it is propaganda --

B.69:  Right.

A.70:  -- you know, what are, what are, what are we supposed to
believe --

B.71:  Right.

A.72:  -- but I don't, I don't trust the government here more than,
I trust, you know, to a point, but then, just like, I'm not going
to trust another government --

B.73:  Right.

A.74:  -- just because [laughter] there's no way, especially when
they've been such a, oh, a power to us, you know, a force that we
have to watch constantly --

B.75:  Right.

A.76:  -- a threat, but yet, now they're going to be our friends --

B.77:  Uh-huh.

A.78:  -- no, that's like Little Red Riding Hood to me, [laughter]
you know, letting the wolf in and saying, Oh, that's okay --

B.79:  Yeah, really,

A.80:  -- [Laughter] we're going to sit here but we're not, we're
going to watch each other, and I think whoever wins the, the wait
is probably the one.

B.81:  Well, if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does
anything, that's fine with me.

A.82:  As long as, I don't care about that, they can do whatever
they want, but I don't want it to get,
