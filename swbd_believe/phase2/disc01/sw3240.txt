=======================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any pets?

@B.2:  Yeah, I have five cats, two dogs, a snake, and a bunny.

A.3:  Oh.  (( )) [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] That's enough to keep anybody busy with pets.  

A.5:  I --

B.6:  How about you?

A.7:  -- oh, I guess, we have one miniature Dachshund.

B.8:  Um, I think I'm envious [laughter].

A.9:  Oh, I don't think I could cope with that many.  How d-, how do you, uh,
avoid having your house smell?

B.10:  Well, my cats are indoor outdoor cats, and, I don't know, I hadn't really
thought about it [laughter].  One thing is to keep everything clean --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- I mean, you have to keep cages, like for the rabbit, you have to keep it
cleaned, and you have to keep litter boxes scooped, but most of my cats go
outside, so there's not that much there.  I only have one who stays inside.

A.13:  Uh, do you let your rabbit run around loose?

B.14:  Oh, no, it's in a cage.  Lot of people do, but I've never been able to
quite handle that with a rabbit.

A.15:  Okay, I, I knew somebody who said they were easy to, uh, litter box train,
but she had trouble with its chewing on wood [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] No, I've never even tried it,

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  to be honest with you.  It's really my daughter's rabbit.

A.19:  Uh, how, what kind of a dog do you have?  

B.20:  Um, I have, I have one that's kind of a Golden Retriever mutt, that means a
mix [laughter] --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and then my daughter just got an American Eskimo.

A.23:  Do they get along?

B.24:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  All my cats and my dogs, and even the rabbit and the
dogs and the cats, everybody in my house gets along, except the snake, he kind
of keeps [laughter] to himself.

A.25:  See, we, our dog hates every other animal [laughter], and our, we have a
couple of children that are, are grown and on their own, and every once in a
while they will come home for a visit with an animal --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- and our, our dog just about has a stroke.

B.28:  Well, he's probably older and he's used to being --

A.29:  Well,

B.30:  -- the only dog, and that's hard for him, just like people, it's hard for
them to give up their, their place as the only one and kind of share the
attention, but almost all of my animals are used to --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- not being the only one in the house, and so they're kind of used to
being part of a group [laughter].

A.33:  Well, we, we kind of joke, that, that our, our dog's about eight years old,
and, but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a
Golden Retriever --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and, uh, when he left, you know, we swear our dog's muzzle turned white,
and then, uh, our, our other son is in the navy and was being relocated to go
to school down at college station, so he was here for a couple days in
between, waiting for his household goods and stuff, and with a beagle puppy,
and we swear after she left, the dog got gray on the front [laughter] two
feet.

B.36:  [Laughter] Maybe he's just getting old [laughter].

A.37:  I don't know, but, [laughter] a visit from, uh, one of his cousins,
cousins, who, uh, really,

B.38:  Turns him gray [laughter].

A.39:  Yes [laughter].

B.40:  One of the things they mentioned was why do you think people have pets?

A.41:  Well, I think they're, I think they're good company.  I have been trying
for years to convince my mother who lives alone that she would like a dog.
She loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap, you know, and
she'll just sit there and pet him and pet him, and I'll say, You need an
animal,

B.42:  I think so too.

A.43:  And,

B.44:  I really think that they are wonderful therapy, they're, they're ju-,
companionship, uh --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- obviously I'm a, I'm a real believer in them.

A.47:  Well, and I, I think they're good for kids in that they can teach the kids
responsibility.

B.48:  Yes, I think so too.

A.49:  You know, if, if you, if you have a, a kid who wants an animal badly enough
and agrees to take care of it, I mean, it's a responsibility, cleaning up
after it, and, um --

B.50:  Feeding it.

A.51:  -- feeding it, make sure it has water, and, uh, you know, just, just all
that kind of stuff, that's, that's good also, uh --

B.52:  That's right.

A.53:  -- but we just have a, we, we, in the past we've had great danes --

B.54:  Ooh, that's a big dog.

A.55:  -- [Laughter] which were probably the best pets we've ever had.

B.56:  Really.

A.57:  Oh, they were, well, the first one we had was wonderful.  She just finally
died of old age, but she was just so, the greatest house pet, and, uh, we were
asked when, she was probably about ten years old when our, our youngest one
was born, and she would totally ignore this baby, I mean the dog could be
laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room, and
the dog would just kind of sniff and wa-, walk out of the room, [laughter] and
would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until, uh, she got old
enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over --

B.58:  Oh, yeah.

A.59:  -- (( )) and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay, but,

B.60:  [Laughter] Um, here's a source.

A.61:  [Laughter] My husband decided it wou-, might be nice to have a lap dog
for a change --

B.62:  Yeah,

A.63:  -- and now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap --

B.64:  Sure.

A.65:  -- when he watches T V and sits in his recliner and falls asleep.

B.66:  That's neat, that's neat.
