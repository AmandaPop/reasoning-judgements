=========================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead.  What do you have to say on the subject?

@B.2:  Well, I am a tax preparer myself.  So, I do about five
hundred income taxes a year, in fact I even do television and
radio shows here in the Dallas market regarding income taxes,
make sure every one pays the right amount.  And I am convinced
that, uh, most people try to, uh-huh, cheat ever so slightly on
their tax returns, only because, uh, the way the I R S does
things.  They're not going to give you any breaks.  I mean, they,
they encourage you to cheat, because if you should get audited,
they're going to get you for everything and some more on top of
that.

A.3:  And then they're going to tax you on that for, or they're
going to give you an interest on it --

B.4:  That,

A.5:  -- I know somebody that it happened to.

B.6:  That's right.

A.7:  Now, see, believe it or not, I'm one of these honest guys,
but I get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so
therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer
expenses.  When I sat down, when we were through, and I sat down
with our accountant and we did it, if, I'm not presently working
outside of the home.  If I return to work, believe it or not,
with our state income tax, our city income tax, city we live in
and city we work in [laughter], 

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  I would have lost, and with social security, I would have
lost forty-eight cents on every dollar that I earned.

B.10:  Easily, easily.

A.11:  And, well, easily, just as [laughter] you said, and I sat
down and thought about it, and I should be in a pretty good
position, because I don't have little kids any more that I need
sitters for or anything like that.  If I go to work, it would be
for our fun money.  And we realized that how, it would disrupt,
disrupt our travel routine and things like that, and my husband
gets five weeks vacation, and we said, it's not worth it.  I'm
not working any more.

B.12:  Yep.

A.13:  It just isn't worth it.  And you get frustrated, and yet I
don't know what the T-, uh, the Texas --

B.14:  Well, see,

A.15:  -- rules are,

B.16:  Well, Texas, we are a community property state, so we have
some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate
property state such as, uh, where you, in Ohio, but,

A.17:  Do you pay a state income, income tax?

B.18:  We do not have state income taxes yet, but we see it --

A.19:  You don't,

B.20:  -- on the horizon.  It hadn't hit here yet.

A.21:  Um, they,

B.22:  #But we do have,#

A.23:  #start with one# percent and then [laughter] they get you
every two ye-,

B.24:  Yeah, but how much do you pay in sales tax?

A.25:  Uh, sales tax we pay seven percent.

B.26:  Okay, we're at eight and a fourth, right now.

A.27:  You're, so you're higher, but you get out of towners on that
then.  You get everyone on your state --

B.28:  True,

A.29:  -- uh, sales tax, which is good.

B.30:  True, true.

A.31:  As the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you
live in, right now we're living where there is a reciprocity.  So
if you do pay more in the city you're working, you don't owe your
city anything.  

B.32:  No.

A.33:  And this year, my husband's actually keeping track of all his
time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the
difference, because our city is a little bit less.

B.34:  But are you at a fact that when you prepare your tax return,
now obviously if you have an error in the I R S -s favor they're
going to be very quick to come back to you and say, Hey, you owe
this much more tax.

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  But if there's an error in your favor, they do not come back
to you and say, Oh, you get a refund.  They,

A.37:  Oh, abso-, and much less, they don't pay you an interest.

B.38:  Yeah.  So, you know, what's fair for the goose is good for
the gander, and unfortunately, the I R S is saying, you know, we
have screwed you all so many times, that's why so many tax payers
are starting to cheat more and more, which is a shame.  But I
think the I R S has brought it on themself because they're not
being very helpful to those who have made errors.  And I think if
they, I think if they would come back and say, Hey, look, this is
wrong, this is the way it should be done, we going to give you
some refund and so forth, and actually show an honest effort to
be good on both sides of the fence.  We want to collect as much
tax, we also want to give back as much tax --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- I think that you'd have a better feeling and you'd have a
lot better tax returns being done.

A.41:  Well, and it is now to the point that it has gotten so, um,
so complicated.  I can do ours in a normal year.  I have always
done our income tax.  And I've done it with transfers and sale of
property.  But this last time it was so involved that I just
threw it all up and said, Forget it, let's go see a C P A.  Well,

B.42:  And yet, if you went to visit five different C P A -s you'd
get five different answers.

A.43:  That's what I understand.  This one seemed to do well, and,
uh, she did go over our last three or four years, and she said, I
have to compliment you [laughter].  You have excelled.  She
said, I cannot find one thing to pull out that you haven't
already pulled.  And I said, Well I do keep records all year long
as I go.  One on twice a month, one on,

B.44:  I think, uh, you sound like one of the type of clients I'd
love to have [laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter] Well, that's what she said.  I went in there, and
I had all my books, and I said what do you want to know.  And I
keep every single thing.  As I write the checks twice a month, I
enter it, uh, in either donations, wherever it goes, I do keep
good records.

B.46:  But,

A.47:  And so, therefore, this time I did not like having to go to
someone else, because I said, Well,
