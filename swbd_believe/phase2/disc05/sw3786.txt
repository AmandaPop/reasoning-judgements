============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so you were with T I, huh?

B.2:  Yeah, I've been with, I was with, uh, T I for, uh, thirty-four years, so
obviously I found something worth, worth doing there and have, 

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  prejudices about, uh, what I want [laughter].  

A.5:  Well, any, stay any place that long, they got to be doing something right,
right?

B.6:  Yeah, uh, where do you work?  

A.7:  I, uh, work for myself.  I sell, uh, metal fabricating equipment and
tooling and, uh, [inhaling] oh, cad cam systems and things like that.

B.8:  Okay.

A.9:  And, uh, consequently, I can't really discuss big time benefits at the
moment, although I had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big
companies once upon a time.  But, uh, I think --

B.10:  Uh,  

A.11:  -- most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them, and they're
somewhat probably getting out of hand [laughter].

B.12:  Yeah, they, uh, [squeak] I'm not sure what the category's supposed to be,
but it was what, something about what benefits would you consider, something
like that, when you, uh, go to work for a large company.

A.13:  Well,   

B.14:  Uh,   

A.15:  I think, uh, oh, the way I,   

B.16:  Other than, other than salary, didn't it say?  

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  Well, no, it didn't necessarily say other than salary, but what would you
consider to be kind of important, I guess such as, 

B.20:  Well, I'm, I thought it said other than salary but,   

A.21:  Well, I, I imagine that's what they're -- 

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  -- referring to, you know -- 

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  -- like, uh, your health insurance and pensions and -- 

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- all that kind of good stuff.  Uh,   

@B.28:  Well, I, uh, personally, I left my previous job which was with ((chance
bought)) before I joined, uh, then, ironically, I left ((chance bought)), the
largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some thirty thousand
people as I recall and, uh, joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because
I wanted to go with a small company [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter] And they grew up around you, didn't it [laughter]? 

B.30:  And, uh, uh, that was twenty-five hundred people when I joined, and, uh --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- then it became Dallas County's largest employer.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  But, uh, one reason I left where I was definitely had to do with what I
wanted, uh, besides what I was getting, and it had to do with, uh, wanting to
do research and, in other words, I wanted to enjoy the job and have the
freedom to do the job.

A.35:  Well, I think that's one of the --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- keys that most people, uh, probably put above benefits.  That's why I
work for myself --

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  -- basically, too [laughter].  I want to do what I want to do [laughter].

B.40:  Well, I participated on many, uh, surveys and that sort of thing.  I was a
T I fellow, so I was down on the, you know, on the technical ladder side
rather than the --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- uh, heavy management, although I was a branch manager at one time.

A.43:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.44:  And it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey
results because to them, uh, money is the motivation and, uh, benefits, you
know, stock options, uh, perks, that sort of thing.

A.45:  Right, right.  

B.46:  And power, and they, they just couldn't understand why, with the technical
surveys that were done by the, uh, Institute of Electrical Engineers and, uh,
others, uh, including I B M -s that, in the technical community, salary was
never first [laughter].  It was usually about third.

A.47:  Well, I think as -- 

B.48:  And,   

A.49:  -- long as it's comparable with, you know -- 

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  -- the job, or can -- 

B.52:  #Right.#  

A.53:  -- #that, uh,# you aren't being [laughter] picked on in the sense of being
the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation, you know --

B.54:  Right.  

A.55:  -- you know, you got to, I,   

B.56:  Number one and number two usually were, uh, number one was usually, uh,
enjoyable work --

A.57:  Yep {faint}.

B.58:  -- or work that I enjoy, something of that sort.  Uh, and number two was
freedom to do that work --

A.59:  Yes.  

B.60:  -- normally.  

A.61:  Yes.  

B.62:  And, uh, third, or even fourth sometimes was the salary.  

A.63:  W-,   

B.64:  And that was in virtually every technical, uh, ladder survey that was taken
over the, oh, fifteen or so years that I participated.  But, invariably, the
managers would challenge this, you know [laughter].

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  Because they just couldn't believe that [laughter] -- 

A.67:  Right.  

B.68:  -- that people weren't motivated by money.  

A.69:  Well, I, I wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money, but I would say
that there are other things that are equal or greater important.  I, I guess
if you make enough money, uh, if the money were really big bucks, I guess some
of these other things you could, uh, live with for a while anyway, until you
had enough [laughter] to do what you wanted to do but, 

B.70:  Yeah, well, I'm sure, 

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  you know, if you were being paid a slave labor scale, obviously money would
be --

A.73:  Yes.  

B.74:  -- high up on the list.  But, in a competitive, uh, market, as it was most
of the time what I was in, where, you get a, you could get a job elsewhere
anyt-, any day of the week you wanted to go --

A.75:  Right.  

B.76:  -- until about the last two years and, uh, in that case, you felt more
secure, uh, money wise so that you could seek, uh, enjoyable work --

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  -- or creative work, that sort of thing.
