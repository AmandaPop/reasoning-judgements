=============================================================================

A.1:  (( )) they, they asked us, uh, you know, whether we felt the, uh, the war
was, was justified in dollars and lives, and [breathing] I mean, I, I really
can't see how it was.  I think the more interesting part of the question to me
was the effect that it had on, uh, on the U S.

@B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  #(( )).#

B.4:  #I# think that's what's called a moot question [laughter].

A.5:  Yeah, re-, good point.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  But I was, you know, I was, while I was waiting for a connection I was just
thinking about it and I said, you know, the [breathing] I don't know if
without the Vietnam war, if we would have had, you know, all the hippie era,
the protesters, demonstrations, uh, [breathing] you know, and the, the effect
that it had on rock and roll and, you know, all of the, uh, the baby boomers.
#I mean, I think it,#

B.8:  #Yeah, the, the,#

A.9:  you know, has a profound effect on all of us.

B.10:  I think that had we had the war or had we not had the war, we'd a had a lot
similar, uh, effect upon the population in terms of, uh, the freedom era, as
it were.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  I think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at
one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it.

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  Me among them #[laughter].#

A.15:  #Yeah, yeah, likewise,# likewise.

B.16:  And, uh, you know, Richard Nixon is my hero, because he kept me out of that
place.

A.17:  #[Laughter].#

B.18:  #And# my number was six and I was going.

A.19:  Wow.

B.20:  Yeah, #((yeah)).#

A.21:  #Oh.# Well, see, my, my, uh, the, the, I had, uh, I had forgot, I hadn't
even thought about that in a long, long time.  I had two numbers.  The lowest
one I had was like a, a sixty-eight, I think, and then another one, uh, I had
like a one thirty-seven, I think, you know.

B.22:  Yeah.  Forget that, you're not going.

A.23:  Yeah, but, uh, you know, nonetheless, uh, I was busy going to college when
that was happening, you know.

B.24:  Well, I quit college, when, uh, they, when they moved out.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Went into construction.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Took me seventeen years to finish my degree.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  Well, uh, I don't know.  It's, uh,

B.32:  Was it worthwhile?  From whose point of view?

A.33:  Well, I think th-, I think what it showed, though, was that, uh, y-, you
know, America was, was, i-, is not invincible and all powerful, and, uh, you
know, it, it also shows that even with the, the kind of money that was thrown
into it and the, the, uh, armaments, uh, with the way it was waged, which was
not an all out war, and I guess that's the other thing too, it was never a
declared war, so, you know, it never did really have the backing of the
people.

B.34:  Well, I think one of the, the major points that a lot of people, including
myself, missed until recently is the fact that we could have annihilated the
north had we won it.

A.35:  Oh, and I agree with that, but it was, it was such a, uh, a, a limited, uh,
you know, one hand tied behind your back, uh.

B.36:  Well, even, even at, even at the, not on the, you know, the gross tactical,
but on the, on the very minute tactical arena --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- you know, they were sending out, you know, eight or nine guys to engage
a company.

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  You know, and they'd get wiped out and you wonder why.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  You know.  And at every turn the tacticians were denied access to
information, which is a biggie, and, uh, components, you know, whatever it
took to do the job, by the politicians.

A.43:  Why, why was that?

B.44:  Why?  Because somebody was getting rich.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  I found that everywhere you look, if you find the money, you'll find out
why.

A.47:  Yeah, good point.

B.48:  And Dow Chemical had a real good thing going.  You know Dow Chemical had a
photographer at every demonstration?

A.49:  Oh, really?

B.50:  Yes, and if your picture was in that demonstration, you didn't get hired by
Dow Chemical.

A.51:  Really?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  How interesting.

B.54:  And, uh, Dupont was, was, uh, doing a lot of that too.

A.55:  Yeah, Dupont is, uh, [throat_clearing] they're, they're not high on my list
of favorites.  They have, they've fought, uh, the banning of ozone, uh, or
rather, uh, not ozone, but, uh, freon.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  Just tooth and nail.

B.58:  Well, it was a big part of their market.

A.59:  Oh, right, right, #but I mean,#

B.60:  #You know, and ((we)),#

A.61:  you know, they, they took, uh, you know, all the data that had been, uh,
produced, uh, from back, uh, in the late, uh, eighties, middle, mid to late
eighties about, uh, uh, how freon was, uh, shown to, to damage the ozone, and,
uh, they just, you know, were adamant that, uh, #you know a-, and,#

B.62:  #They have no# moral conscience.

A.63:  Yeah, really.

B.64:  And that goes into, and it, and it's all tied together too.  I kind of
believe that the Vietnam event, I'm not going to call it a war or a police
action, it was an event, that the main push for that was outside the United
States, our involvement.  For one thing, we were on the wrong side, you know.
We were side of the fascist dictator and, you know, Ho Chi Minh, if you've
read any of his writings, he was a democrat.

A.65:  Huh.

B.66:  You know, he wanted democracy.

A.67:  Really?

B.68:  But he was forced to sleep with,
