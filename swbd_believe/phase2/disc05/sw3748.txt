A.1:  So, national health care.  I don't know about you, but for me I am voting
for the next democrat for the president.

@B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  That says he is going to do something about a national health care program.

B.4:  Yeah, I, uh, I basically agree, uh, I have mixed feelings I guess there
are some, uh, somehow, there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of
--

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- of health care.

A.7:  Yeah, I myself, uh, I haven't worked for three years because of some
medical problems, and, uh, if I had not had insurance with the company I
worked with at the time, I believe I would have died.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  And that worries me thinking, cause I know a lot of people that don't have
any coverage at all.

B.10:  Yeah, if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a
company that provides it, it is, uh, pretty much unaffordable --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- uh, to pay for it on your own.

A.13:  Well, I, I think that paying for it on your own, it is like in my case, I
am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care.  I don't
think that would have been possible for [laughter] the majority of the people
in this world.

B.14:  Yeah, that is right.

A.15:  So, but then again, there is, uh, [inhaling] the high cost of medical care
is out unreal.

B.16:  Yeah.  I have a friend who, uh, uh, is from, uh lived at, lived in London
or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have med-, uh, health
care, uh, there and I guess, I guess there is some disadvantages too, I guess,
uh, uh, because of that they, there has been a great migration of doctors from
there over to more lucrative practices and --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- sometimes I guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat.
So, 

A.19:  Well, I think somewhere along the line, whatever plan they come up with, it
is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Uh, I myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more
years and, uh, [laughter] he is doing it for the money.

B.22:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't --

A.23:  So,

B.24:  -- have, I think, they don't get into it for any other reason.  #Uh,#

A.25:  #Yeah,# but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked
out for the people that can't afford it.

B.26:  Yes.  I, uh, agree too and also the, uh, the elderly a lot of times when
they, uh, reach retirement, uh, they can't afford any any supplemental
insurance --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- sometimes that is not enough to #cover the costs.#

A.31:  #I found out,# yeah, I, uh, my mother is on Medicare, Medicaid, whatever
and, uh, I know it doesn't pay all of her me-, hospital bills and so forth.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  And I think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still
has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- several thousand for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay.

B.36:  Yeah, particularly for people who are on, uh, on just living mostly on
social security or something like that.  They don't have enough extra money to
pay for that.

A.37:  I know one, uh, not this Christmas, but the Christmas before, she was out
here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and
we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem.
Uh, fairly minor.  She just strained it, sprained it, but [swallowing] when
the bills starting coming in, she had already gone home so I got a chance to
look at them --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- and I was shocked.  I mean I have been through a lot, I mean with
medical bills, but when I saw what they did to her that day and it cost about
three thousand dollars just to, uh, get a prescription for some pain pills --

B.40:  Yeah, yeah.

A.41:  -- basically.

B.42:  Uh, in, I guess in addition to, uh, [popping] national health care policy,
there, uh, has to be some sort of monitoring I guess too of the overall
medical field and hospital costs --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- and,  

A.45:  Well, that doesn't happen.  I, uh, it is weird.  I was in the hospital for
like eight days back in October.  Uh, so many mistakes were made during my
time there that I, uh, literally left the hospital in a taxi cab, just to get
away from the place.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  I was scared --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- as to what they were going to do to me next and when I got the bill, it
was outrageous.  Uh, pills that I had never heard of that I had taken which I
know that I didn't.  I mean I wasn't ill.

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  #I# was just in for some routine stuff and [laughter] it goes on and on.

B.52:  Yeah, I am afraid right now there is a lot of, I guess you would have to
call it, just basic fraud in the, uh, business --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not
questioned at all.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  Uh, I don't know which one of the, uh, democratic candidates, either,
either Kerrey or Clinton, I guess, one of those two.  I can't remember which is
pretty much in favor of some sort of, 

A.57:  I think Kerrey is and I think also Jerry Brown from California --

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- are interested.  Uh, actually, the way Bush has been going the last few
weeks, I think he may be interested.  Uh, [laughter] he, 

B.60:  Well, uh, he is probably campaigning -- 

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- I don't know how serious he is [laughter].

A.63:  Uh, yeah [laughter]. Uh, up until just recently, I, I would have thought
Bush would, uh, you know, I still, he has done a pretty good job.
