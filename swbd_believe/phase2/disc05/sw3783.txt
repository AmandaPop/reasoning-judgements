A.1:  Okay, uh, personal c-, I don't have a personal computer.  I'd like to have
one.

@B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  #If I had more# --

B.4:  #I've got one.#

A.5:  -- money, I'd have one [laughter].  

B.6:  I do have one, but it's a, kind of an old one that, uh, they didn't use at
work any longer.  Not the [noise], not the greatest one, but, uh, I use one at
work quite a bit.  All day long, in fact.

A.7:  Is it, is it hard to find, uh, compatible pieces for your, the one you have
at home?

B.8:  Yeah, because it's a little bit older.  

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  And, uh, it's a Wang machine.  

A.11:  Oh. 

B.12:  And Wang was, you know, a leader a while ago, but -- 

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  -- now they're kind of out of it.  

A.15:  I would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer
is the, it seems like every month [laughter] --

B.16:  What's that?  

A.17:  -- they're coming out with something new -- 

B.18:  Oh, yeah.  

A.19:  -- and so then -- 

B.20:  They're constantly --  

A.21:  -- you're not #compatible.#

B.22:  -- #changing.# 

A.23:  Oh, yeah.  Even with like the computer games, Nintendo and that kind of
stuff.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  I mean they change it every year.  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  And the, the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't
compatible.

B.28:  [Inhaling] Most of the, uh, [breathing] you know, WordPerfect and Lotus and
those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about fifty
dollars a year.  I think they'll give --

A.29:  Oh. 

B.30:  -- you the, the next release of their software.  

A.31:  Oh, okay.  

B.32:  And, but, uh,   

A.33:  Well, that isn't, that doesn't sound too bad.  

B.34:  Yeah, do you use one much?  

A.35:  Not really, not in my work.  

B.36:  Uh,  

A.37:  Uh, I did try and take a class, uh -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- I think last, was it last spring, no actually, it was last fall.  It was
at, at, I took desktop publishing.

B.40:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.41:  I just wanted to get sort of a, a slight feel for it, and -- 

B.42:  Sure.  

A.43:  -- it's an introduction course.  

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  And it was pretty fascinating.  We, we learned how to do, how to make a
brochure --

B.46:  Oh? 

A.47:  -- type thing out, uh, o-, off the computer, so -- 

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- it was pretty interesting.  

B.50:  Yeah [inhaling].  Oh, I'm a C P A, and I use it -- 

A.51:  Oh, so you,   

B.52:  -- almost all the time for --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- this Lotus program and -- 

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- I have, well --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- lot of good applications for what I have to do.  

A.59:  Now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs -- 

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  -- and things like that, right?  

B.62:  Or spreadsheets and -- 

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  -- that type of thing, yeah.  

A.65:  I'm not real good with computers at all.  And that's mainly because I don't
use them.

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  I wish I did.  I'd be, you know, more up on it.  

B.68:  Well, they, they've sure come down in price, uh, in -- 

A.69:  Oh, my goodness, yes.  

B.70:  -- you know, four or five years ago, they were, probably four or five times
what they are now [laughter].

A.71:  Yeah.  Have you heard about the phone that, uh, believe it's A T and T, is
it A T and T, coming out with the phone, with the, like on the JETSONS when
you could see the, you could see the person's face.

B.72:  Oh, yeah.  

A.73:  Have you seen that?  

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  When you have vision -- 

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  -- with the sound.  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  I saw that in a, in a magazine recently.  I was really shocked.

B.82:  I'm not sure I'd like that.  

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Once you get those calls early in the morning when you're -- 

A.85:  Oh, I know [laughter].  

B.86:  -- [Laughter] just out of bed [laughter].  

A.87:  Hopefully, you can -- 

B.88:  Decide if you -- 

A.89:  -- have control over -- 

B.90:  -- [Laughter] want to have picture or not.  

A.91:  -- whether they can see you or not.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  But it looked pretty nice and it's only going to be two thousand dollars
so, 

B.94:  Oh, really?

A.95:  Which is not bad for something new --

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  -- like that so,    

B.98:  Uh-huh [inhaling].  Well, you know, they've got these, uh, [breathing] all
these m-, uh, computers have modems in them now --

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  -- where you can call all over the place, uh,   

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  I can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main
computer system --

A.103:  Oh. 

B.104:  -- without much trouble.  

A.105:  My mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all
over the world.  She works at, at, she works at T I.

B.106:  Uh-huh, this is -- 

A.107:  And, uh,   

B.108:  -- how you got signed up for it?  

A.109:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  And, uh, you know, she talks to people through the computer --

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  -- from everywhere, so I think, I think that's really neat, too.

B.114:  Yeah, well, I have a sister that lives in Plano, that's my connection with
the project.

A.115:  Okay, uh-huh.  

B.116:  [Laughter]. 

A.117:  Maybe she knows my mother because my mother used to work in Plano.  Now --

B.118:  Oh. 

A.119:  -- she works in -- 

B.120:  Uh-huh.  

A.121:  -- uh, north Dallas, I think.  

B.122:  Yeah.  

A.123:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.124:  But --

A.125:  But,  

B.126:  -- I, you know, there, uh, I've got a six year old and I think he's, he's
got quite a bit of interest in, uh, in playing around with the one we have at
home and it's not a, it's not a real fun one.  It's not a color or --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- I don't have much in the way of game software.  

A.129:  I visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays, a lot of the
schools have computers and the kids are really, they're more interested in
their schoolwork --

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  -- with the computer.  

B.132:  Yeah.  

A.133:  You know, they can also -- 

B.134:  I think,   

A.135:  -- play games, but then they can help them write papers and help with their
math --

B.136:  Yeah.  

A.137:  -- and that kind of thing.  

B.138:  It adds a dimension that, uh, probably makes learning a little bit more fun
if you get to --

A.139:  Oh, yeah.  

B.140:  -- you know, try things a little different than just the standard pencil
and paper and crayons.

A.141:  And there's always something new even if you know, even if you think you
know everything about the computer, there's always one button that you never
quite use and you don't --

B.142:  Yeah.  

A.143:  -- really quite know what it's for [laughter] -- 

B.144:  Uh-huh.  

A.145:  -- and, you know, can be fascinating in that way, too.  Especially for a
kid that, you know, is just learning so, 

B.146:  Yeah.  

A.147:  Well, hopefully, I'll be able to get a computer at some point.  I don't
know when, but I don't need one right now.

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  But there's going to come a time, I'm sure when everybody's going to have
to have one.

B.150:  Oh, I think that day will happen.  

A.151:  Oh, yeah.  

B.152:  I'm hoping that perhaps, uh, what will ultimately happen is you won't have
to commute as much --

A.153:  Uh-huh.  

B.154:  -- but you'll be able to do so much from home -- 

A.155:  Yeah.  

B.156:  -- that, uh, you know, you won't have to be driving around like,
