A.1:  Kathy --

B.2:  Hi.

@A.3:  -- you know I was thinking about basketball teams, and, uh, the funny
thing is that when I was in college at B Y U, I followed the school team --

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  -- and, uh, and then when I graduated, I mean, and got married and
everything, I really, kind of, lost interest in following teams.  Have you
been following any?

B.6:  Not too much.  Uh, who is it from the Mavericks that just, wasn't there
some controversy about one of their players that did not get to play so now he
doesn't, he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to
play at all or something [laughter].

A.7:  Oh no.  I know they are always have, uh, I mean I can't believe the amount
of money that the players make --

B.8:  Its creepy.

A.9:  -- in the first place and, I, uh, I mean, I know that they have a short,
uh, career --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- and, everything,

B.12:  But even so, I mean, uh, I don't think, I will, uh, make a million or three
million [laughter] in a life time, let alone a season [noise].

A.13:  That's true.  It is really a lot [clinking].

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  But, uh, my sister always gets, uh, season tickets to the Utah Jazz.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And, uh, so she watches their games a lot and everything, but I don't
believe we have ever been involved with any teams that, you know, makes it to
the playoffs --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- too much.

B.20:  We came from Oakland.  

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  I went to B Y U also.

A.23:  You did!

B.24:  Yeah.  Any, and see, uh, we use to go to some of the, the games there, but
we really have not done much with the Mavericks [noise] here.

A.25:  Well, I was at B Y U when they made it to the playoffs [noise].

B.26:  Yeah!

A.27:  I think they played Notre Dame or something, uh, for the big game.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I can't remember now.  That was so, it seems like, it was eons ago.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  It was like ten years ago, I think.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  And #uh.# 

B.34:  #Did know,# let me think who was on that team.  There was a Dave Callus or
a Gordon Greun?  Remember those names?

A.35:  Uh, isn't that the one that was like, the star player with Danny Ange?

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  I think he started playing for the Bos-, Boston Celtics after that --

B.38:  Celtics, right.  Right.

A.39:  -- and, uh, [throat_clearing] and, uh, there was another, the center, it
has been so long, I can't think of anyone's name [clinking].

B.40:  Yeah [noise].

A.41:  But, uh, I [clinking] I, was there that year and enjoyed that game and, uh,
but mostly like I say, I haven't been following the team and don't know who's
got what record.

B.42:  Right.  So do you play for your ward team?

A.43:  I haven't played in, uh, I broke my knee cap [laughter].

B.44:  Oh.

A.45:  But, I did play in high school.  I was on a high school girls' team.

B.46:  Oh, uh-huh.  Where did you go to high school?

A.47:  Well, I went to Missouri.

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  And, I went, and I played for a Parkney High School in Springfield --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- Missouri and I played, uh, a forward [throat_clearing] and, uh, I
enjoyed that then and it's, I always loved sports.  Do you play for your ward?

B.52:  Uh, I, kind of, stopped playing for my ward, because I didn't like the
sportsmanship with the (( )) [laughter] [noise].

A.53:  Well, that is a problem.

B.54:  So, I play for a Richardson City league now.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  But as far as knowing anything about professional teams, you know, when
they said to put down what you are interested in, I wasn't really thinking
about [laughter] --

A.57:  [Laughter]  No.

B.58:  -- (( )).

A.59:  Well, I was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as
opposed to professional [child_talking].

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  You know, I had rather play than watch any thing.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  And, uh, so, I, you know, like I, uh.

B.64:  Do you have any players that you like watching?

A.65:  Well, I, uh, [noise] [clinking] I should (( )) [laughter].  (( )) Sampson?
[children_talking].

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  Do you remember him?  [children_yelling] And, because he came to Houston
when I lived there and, uh, to play for the Houston team and he was really, I
thought, a bad sport.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  And, uh, and, I haven't followed like I say.

B.70:  It really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap, you
know.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.72:  One that --

A.73:  Yeah, that is really true but a,

B.74:  -- publicity bound, you know that,

A.75:  Well, (( )) don't want to spend so much of my time, uh, memorizing
statistics.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  And, uh, keeping, you know, being wrapped up in a team, and, caring whether
they [laughter] win or lose in the sense that --

B.78:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.79:  -- it makes a big difference in my life.

B.80:  Yeah, #that's right.#

A.81:  #You know,# be-, I just don't have that kind of time.

B.82:  You know, once it gets into the finals then I --

A.83:  Uh-huh. 

B.84:  -- kind of rout for one or the other, but up until then, you know
[laughter],

A.85:  That's true, and you know, I get, I have interest in the games, but I am
satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on, you know, the sports news
report --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- or something.

B.88:  The highlights.

A.89:  Right, rather than just like you say watch clips from the game.

B.90:  Do you have kids that play?

A.91:  No.  I, my, both my children are little.  They are just in kindergarten and
first grade.

B.92:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.93:  So, no they don't play, and, uh, my husband loves baseball.

B.94:  Oh.

A.95:  Which I don't really prefer to, uh --

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  -- so, we haven't, uh, had, don't get into basketball too much.  But
anyway,

B.98:  Oh, did you stay with, now what team is it from Houston?

A.99:  Now, [laughter] [clinking] if, I can remember what they were called.  Uh,

B.100:  I want to say (( )), but is that right.

A.101:  No, I don't think so.  No, it was the Astros.  The Astros were the baseball
team --

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  -- and the Oilers --

B.104:  Rockets.

A.105:  -- Rockets.  Yes, that is it.  The Rockets. 

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  Yeah, I, uh, you know, we saw a game,
