=============================================================================

B.1:  All right.

A.2:  [Throat_clearing] What, uh, what are some of your favorite places to, uh,
eat at?

@B.3:  Uh, Royal Tokyo.

A.4:  Royal Tokyo?

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  Uh, Benihana's. 

A.8:  Okay.

B.9:  Enchiladas.

A.10:  Oh, all right.

B.11:  Um.  And actually Red Lobster.

A.12:  Oh, yeah?

B.13:  Uh, what about you?

A.14:  Well, I'm a vegetarian, so, uh, my places are, my, my, my choices are
somewhat limited, uh, but my very favorite is the Olive Garden, I think, uh,
if, or, or else, uh, uh, El Chico's, if I have, if I had my choice that's
where I like to go.

B.15:  Oh, really.

A.16:  Yeah.  I haven't been in Dallas for very long, and so I don't know, you
know, too many places to eat.

B.17:  Yeah.

A.18:  But, uh.

B.19:  Uh, I guess that would be really hard, being vegetarian (( )).

A.20:  It, it, it is a little bit, uh, you know, there, at almost every restaurant
there are, uh, things to eat, it just depends on, you know, whether what you
really want to eat is there.

B.21:  Yeah, yeah, I can appreciate that.

A.22:  Yeah.  Are you vegetarian also or,

B.23:  Uh, no, no, I'm, I do eat meat.

A.24:  Oh yeah.

B.25:  Uh-huh.  I guess being brought up that way I do have a tendency though,
toward chicken and fish --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- seafood.

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  So, um, what made you choose to be a vegetarian?

A.30:  Well, uh, several reasons.  Um, um, most importantly I have a, uh, a
disease and, and both of, in all of my joints that, uh, in which arthritis is
a big factor.

B.31:  Uh.

A.32:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] several reports, uh, in the last five years have
given validity to the, uh, to, to the theory that, that, uh, vegetarian d-,
diet greatly reduces the pain involved with, uh, arthritis.

B.33:  Oh.  Have you found that to be true?

A.34:  Yeah, it rea-, it really does work, um, even to the point now where, uh,
I'm able to run, you know, to go out running or jogging on a, a periodic
basis, which, [throat_clearing] which was impossible before.

B.35:  Oh, well, that's great.

A.36:  Yeah, it, it, it really has helped.  Uh, unfortunately, um, I, I can't give
up, uh, milk --

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  -- so, so I drink, uh, I drink skim milk, but [throat_clearing] if I had my
way I'd drink a gallon, gallon a day [laughter].

B.39:  [Laughter].

A.40:  So, but, but my, my restaurant choices then, uh, I guess, since I've, uh,
been a vegetarian, I've loved Fettucini Alfredo --

B.41:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.42:  -- [Throat_clearing] and so, and so, uh, but any place I go that has that,
that's wh-, that's what I eat [laughter].  It doesn't --

B.43:  Oh, well then there's --

A.44:  -- doesn't matter.

B.45:  -- there's a real good restaurant you should try.  It's called Rocco's.

A.46:  Rocco's?

B.47:  Uh-huh.  It's off of six thirty-five and, I believe it's Centerville.

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  You can see it from six thirty-five.  It's east of Central Expressway.

A.50:  Okay.

B.51:  And it's an Italian place --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- and they have really, really good food --

A.54:  Oh, really.

B.55:  -- nice healthy portions --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- and they're really, uh, reasonably priced.

A.58:  Oh, good.

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  Yeah, um, I'll try that out.

B.61:  It's, uh, yeah, my husband, matter of fact he works for T I --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- but he and I went there, and they have got some of the best bread,
garlic bread --

A.64:  Oh, really?

B.65:  -- you've ever had.  And, uh, I think I did have, I don't know if it was,
uh, Alfredo, I might have had Parmigiana.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  But it was really good.

A.68:  Yeah.  What makes you go back to a restaurant?

B.69:  Um, the food --

A.70:  Really?

B.71:  -- first of all, yeah, um, and then service.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  If the, if the personnel there are really attentive and if they, if they
really act like they care --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- I mean, whether they do or not, but --

A.76:  Right.

B.77:  -- if they, [laughter] if they act like they do, 

A.78:  [Laughter].  

B.79:  then those are, those are two big things that really make me want to go
back to a restaurant.

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  And what about you?

A.82:  The, I, I think more than anything else, uh, the atmosphere.

B.83:  Oh, really?

A.84:  Yeah, which I think, you know, the, the se-, the, the service is, is a big
part of, but --

B.85:  Uh-huh.

A.86:  -- but, uh, [throat_clearing] my very favorite place in the world to eat,
uh, believe it or not is in, I went to school in Abilene --

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  -- uh, and, and there's a pl-, there's a little restaurant there called
the, uh, uh, the Oxford Street --

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  -- [Throat_clearing] which, uh, the food is okay, uh, uh, and, uh, you
know, it's, it's on the better side of good --

B.91:  Uh-huh.

A.92:  -- and the service is okay, but the atmosphere is just beautiful.  It's,
uh, uh, you, you know, it looks like an, an old English, uh, home with, uh,
you know, the high back leather chairs and, uh, uh --

B.93:  Oh, okay.

A.94:  -- the cl-, the cloth, the cloth, uh, you know how they cloth the walls
with, with that --

B.95:  Uh-huh.

A.96:  -- tapestry cloth, it has that.

B.97:  Yeah.

A.98:  It's, it's just really nice, and I like to eat in there just because I like
the feeling in there.

B.99:  Uh-huh, I bet it makes you feel really good.

A.100:  Yeah, yeah.  Makes you hungry [laughter].

B.101:  [Laughter] Well, that's, uh, pretty good for a restaurant, I guess.

A.102:  Yeah [laughter].

B.103:  Oh.

A.104:  Yeah, you, uh, that, one, one thing I found was interesting is I read a, a
report when I was an undergraduate that, uh, was talking about the colors of a
restaurant,
