=============================================================================

A.1:  I guess you heard our conv-, our topic for today was clothing?

B.2:  Yes, I certainly did.

A.3:  How you dress for work and season to season and everything.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  How do you dress for work?

@B.6:  Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school.  I, uh, I am a graduate
student so, [throat_clearing] I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I
wear too much of the time.

A.7:  Sure.

B.8:  Which is nice.  Uh --

A.9:  You bet.

B.10:  -- Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of, I am a speech pathology major and
so I do a lot of clinical work and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh,
uh, look my best.

A.11:  Look professional [laughter].

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  [Laughter]  Unfortunately.

A.15:  Yeah, I understand.  I am a, I own my company.  I am in the, I am, uh,
manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and I am
very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- but then when I travel it is a little different situation.

B.18:  Yeah, sure.

A.19:  Uh, suits and sports coat, tie and the whole bit.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look
professional of course.

B.22:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give
uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to
professionally dressed #individual.#

A.23:  #Yeah, I think# in today's society, uh, there is more credibility
to be quite honest --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- I will always remember, I will tell this real quick story when I
graduated from college, my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago,
twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and I sold
uh, you know, manure.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers and I would always try to look
my best wearing sport coats and things like that, but I was calling on guys
that wore bib overalls.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you
know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of
told me that he expected me to be professional --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional --

B.34:  Oh, really?

A.35:  -- so, uh, it was sort of,  

B.36:  Even the farmers.

A.37:  You bet --

B.38:  Oh, wow.

A.39:  -- even back then so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and
--

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- try to look my best, but here again I dress casual quite a bit so, 

B.42:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, certainly.

A.43:  It gives you confidence.  In my business if I call on the the J C Penney
company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I
wear coat and tie.  If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I
might be casual.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  I call on Oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be
coat and tie.  #So it depends.#

B.46:  #Yeah, it# depends.  Sure.  Uh, so you don't, uh, if you had the choice
would you wear a tie or not?

A.47:  Uh, probably no.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Probably, no.

B.50:  [Sniffing] Uh-huh.

A.51:  Because, uh, today I believe you can get away with, but then it depends on
who you are calling on.  Who you're, you like your minister standing up in
front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.

B.54:  Right, right.

A.55:  So, it's its' just different.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that, uh, [throat_clearing] if if you wanted to, uh, uh,
really get into a hot issue, uh [sniffing], well at least in some in some
beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a
pretty, pretty hot topic.

A.57:  Yes, it is.

B.58:  Uh, un-, un-, un-, unfortunately.

A.59:  I am, uh, like a Catholic and the people that go to my Church, you know
Catholics dress very casual --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- a lot of the times.  People in jeans and in whatever, but yet the way I
was raised, I am a converted Catholic, the way I was raised, I was raised a
Baptist and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time.  I
guess that has changed also.

B.62:  Uh-huh  [sniffing]. Uh, yeah.  I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ.
I have been raised in the Church of Christ and, uh, [sniffing] but, uh, I, uh,
[throat_clearing] too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what
you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best --

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  -- uh, [sniffing] uh, and dress and proper attire and, uh, and sometimes
that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, [throat_clearing] when I see in other
economic areas like in Kentucky.

A.65:  Sure.

B.66:  You know, people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church
or afraid to go #simply because# --

A.67:  #But (( )).#

B.68:  -- they don't have the clothes to wear.

A.69:  That is a very good point.  I am from West Virginia so I understand what
you are saying there --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and it's it's a very good point.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  But you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its
cover.

B.74:  Certainly.

A.75:  And, uh, evaluation of an individual.  Course, all of it depends on the
type of job responsibility you have.  I think you have to dress sort of
accordingly.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or
evaluate a person by that.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  What about season to season.  Does, I guess your dress changes.

B.80:  Uh, yeah a little bit.  Uh, uh [throat_clearing], of course in the summer
if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts and that's it.  Run
around barefoot,

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  no shirt or anything [throat_clearing].  But, uh,
