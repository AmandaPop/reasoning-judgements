============================================================================

B.1:  Let me think, a political event that happened this year.

A.2:  Yeah, I.

B.3:  Well, there's David Duke.

A.4:  Yeah.

B.5:  And then there's the dissolution of the [laughter] Soviet Union.

A.6:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Those two pretty much take care of everything
[laughter].

B.7:  Yeah.

A.8:  So what do you think about David Duke?

B.9:  Well, if I was a mind to, I might burn a cross on his yard.

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  Thing, what scares me is some of the things he says I agree with --

A.12:  Yeah.

B.13:  -- you know, I just don't [laughter] agree with his methods --

A.14:  That's true, I.

B.15:  -- you know, I think that the way to, 

A.16:  [Throat_clearing].

B.17:  you know, cut out the welfare poor --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- is not to cut out welfare, it's to provide an equal opportunity for
people to make a living.

A.20:  Definitely.  I agree with that.

B.21:  And protect them from themselves.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  Basically, you know, I've, I've seen this very close hand.  A kid, twelve
years old, can make about three thousand dollars a day dealing crack.

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  If he lives to his twenty-first birthday would be a miracle.

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  So, we're, we as a nation have an obligation to our future generations to.

A.28:  Provide them some other avenue or,

B.29:  Yeah, to make dealing crack a, a crime punishable in such a way that nobody
would want to do that --

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  -- and, and our constitution expressly forbids that kind of punishment.

A.32:  Yeah, so I's going to say, what kind of, you know, what kind of punishment,
that's three thousand dollars a day, that, that'd take some kind of punishment
to, #to deter it.#

B.33:  #Yeah, I, I'm# considering doing it, you know.

A.34:  Yeah, definitely, I mean.

B.35:  And I got a job.

A.36:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.37:  Today, anyway.

A.38:  Sure, I, uh, I, uh, I haven't listened to a lot of his views, I just, you
know, the thing about that that kind of concerned me is how they, the people
now want to keep him off the presidential ballots and stuff.

B.39:  Well.

A.40:  And I've kind of wondered, you know, if that's right or,

B.41:  [Laughter] Right or wrong rarely has anything to do with politics.

A.42:  Yeah, that's true.

B.43:  Uh, what I'm seeing here is that the real problem, see David Duke addresses
symptoms.

A.44:  Uh-huh.  He's getting into some, some serious issues.

B.45:  The real problem is, if I work for a man, say I work for a guy, as a matter
of fact I'm going to work for a guy Friday, new job.

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  And he sells Kelley tires.

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  Now if I roll in there in a brand new set of B F Goodrich tires week after
next, should I expect my job to be there?

A.50:  Yeah, or well, I see.

B.51:  See what I'm saying?

A.52:  Yeah.

B.53:  You know, if you drive onto the Ford manufacturing lot in a Datsun --

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  -- I believe that not only should you be fired, all of your assets should
be given over to the government.

A.56:  Why's that?

B.57:  [Laughter] Because you're crippling the very economy with which you're
trying to survive.

A.58:  Oh, that's true, that's true.

B.59:  Now, I believe in free choice --

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  -- don't get me wrong.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  And I'm, I figure I'm allowed to drive any kind of car I want because I
don't work for a car company.

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  I drive American made.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  That's just because I'm an American.  I believe that that's the way you
ought to do it.

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  I mean sure, having a Mazda or a Nissan or whatever they're called these
days, sure that'd be a real status symbol, but you ain't going to impress my
neighbors.

A.70:  Yeah.

B.71:  My neighbor's driving a thirty year old pick up truck.

A.72:  [Laughter].

B.73:  You know.

A.74:  Well, I think you got a point, too.  I can see we do a lot of complaining,
but you don't see a lot of us, you know, a lot of people willing to buy the
American stuff, they're, like you said, they're all out for that status symbol
and.

B.75:  Now the last time I bought a calculator I bought one from Texas Instruments
--

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  -- because my wife works at Texas Instruments, and --

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  -- the next time I buy a computer it will be a Texas Instruments.

A.80:  Well, that makes, that makes good sense.  Like I say, if we, I think we're
of the opinion now that, uh, somebody's got to support the economy but it's
not necessarily going to be the American public.  They want somebody else to
do it, because we're not willing, you know, we're under the impression that
somebody else makes a better product or little snazzier or something but,

B.81:  They, they do make better products.  The scary thing is, we finance their
research.

A.82:  Exactly.  That's true.

B.83:  You know, the, T I, 

A.84:  [Throat_clearing].

B.85:  came out with, with the transistor.

A.86:  Yeah.

B.87:  They didn't make beans off of it.

A.88:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we just did the core research and then they put it into some
consumer product and --

B.89:  Right.

A.90:  -- make all the money off it.

B.91:  Exactly.

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  You know, I, I have a real fundamental problem, 

A.94:  [Throat_clearing].

B.95:  with people who drive a Mercedes and have a Sony T V --

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  -- and scream and holler about the welfare poor.

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  I really have a problem with those guys.

A.100:  Yeah, because they're not doing anything themselves to really help.

B.101:  They're, ex-, as a matter of fact, they're, exacer-, exacerbating the
problem.

A.102:  Yeah.

B.103:  They're making it worse.

A.104:  I can see, I can see, I, I see what you're saying.

B.105:  I used to work for a guy this summer.  He drove a B M W, I, I quit him.

A.106:  Oh, really?

B.107:  I say, hey!  You know.

A.108:  What, uh, was it in the tire business again or,

B.109:  No, it was in construction.

A.110:  Oh.

B.111:  Um, I, I, I se-, I am a dealer for construction software.

A.112:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.113:  And I had worked for this company as, as an employee,
