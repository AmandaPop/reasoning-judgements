B.1:  My name is Ferrell.

A.2:  #Are you re-,#

B.3:  #Where# are you calling from?

A.4:  I'm calling from Miami.

B.5:  Miami.  I'm in Utah.

A.6:  Utah.

B.7:  #Yeah.#

A.8:  #Well,# we've got a long distance connection #tonight.#

B.9:  #Yes,# it is, definitely.

A.10:  You ready to start?

B.11:  Sure, go ahead.

@A.12:  [Tone] Well, you know, the first thing I thought about whenever, uh, I
don't have children, but I, um, [throat_clearing] have a friend who's a school
teacher #and, uh,#

B.13:  #Uh-huh.#

A.14:  she has told me some horror stories, but, uh, other than that, I was
thinking about, um, the, the fact that, uh, so many, uh, kids nowadays can't
even identify on the map, on a globe, where they are.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  And it's just astounding to me.

B.17:  Yeah.

A.18:  Um.

B.19:  [Throat_clearing] I, uh, have a little bit of a background, well, my wife
taught school for about six years and, uh, I'm almost convinced there's a lot
of it has to do with environment.  Uh, she taught in a poor area, poor area
here in Utah, and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the
S A T scores in all the districts of the state --

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  -- and, uh, the district we're presently living in had like double the
scores where she taught.  And it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the
teachers there were bad.  I think a lot of it has to do with the environment
and the help the kids get from, from home.

A.22:  Yeah, and I think you're right, I think an awful lot of it has to do with,
uh, [throat_clearing] the kind of emphasis that, uh, the, the, children get,
uh, at home on education, because, um, uh, this friend of mine who's a school
teacher was telling me, she said, uh, you know, uh, th-, that she has, uh, uh,
kids that, uh, are, are Indian #and,#

B.23:  #Uh-huh.#

A.24:  Pakistani.

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  Uh, Oriental, you know, some of them who, uh, have only been, uh, in the
United States maybe for two generations.

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  That, uh, she said their English is excellent, uh, their, their so-, social
skills are good --

B.29:  [Noise]  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- and, uh, you know, why is it that, uh, that they can be such model
citizens and, uh, yet, you know, other young ki-, uh, uh, kids who have, you
know, been, uh, born and, uh, bred here in the U S, uh --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- just don't seem to get it.

B.33:  Yeah.  Well, you know, you see these documentaries on, uh, on Japan, for
example, and the, uh, rigors they put their students through.  I mean, their
high school students are going six days a week.

A.34:  Right.

B.35:  Uh, to get into college is, uh, no small feat there, I mean just to be
accepted.  I'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure
on their, on their children than, than we do.

A.36:  Yeah, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe, um, year round school would not be
a bad, uh, a bad thing.

B.37:  Now, we have that to a, to a degree here.  That's only because we have a
little bit of a, of a problem that's, I guess peculiar to Utah, and we have a
[throat_clearing] a high population of young, young people, young children,
one of the larger, uh, uh, [breathing] student teacher ratios (( )).  You
know, average class size is probably thirty-five or something like that.

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  And that poses another problem, where the, you know, just the individual
attention that's needed, sometimes, uh, is lacking because of the, you know,
the shear numbers of it [tapping].  And what they've gone to is a year round
program here where, uh, in essence they have what they call tracks and, you
know, the kids go year round, but you have, uh, you go like for, uh, eleven
weeks and you're off for two or three, then you go eleven weeks and, so you
have these, these four periods rather than, than the classic summer vacation.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  These are just mostly the elementary grades, however.

A.42:  Yeah.  Well, [throat_clearing] I don't know.  I, uh, I, uh, I don't,
certainly don't have the answer to it.  I know #that,#

B.43:  #Uh-huh.#

A.44:  uh, um, in Houston, uh, for example, where I'm, I have some friends who,
uh, uh, were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the
school that, uh, uh, they want their kids to go to.

B.45:  Oh.

A.46:  And, uh,

B.47:  Regardless of where they live, huh?

A.48:  Yeah, right.

B.49:  Oh.

A.50:  And, uh, 

B.51:  [Pounding]. 

A.52:  [Throat_clearing] the idea of running a, a school, sort of like a business
in a way, such that if enough people are interested in sending their children
there, it, it gets more funding, and those schools that are less successful,
uh, uh, uh, less successful get less money.  Uh,

B.53:  Oh.  That's, that's interesting.  It's kind of like, uh, turning it over to
the private sector to some degree.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  and the, the supply and demand works #(( )) uh-huh.#

A.56:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.57:  That's an interesting concept.

A.58:  But I don't know if that's the answer, but I do think that there needs to
be some changes made somewhere along the way.

B.59:  Yeah, yeah, I, I [breathing] the stories you read about the competency and
the literacy of the high school graduates, for example, 

A.60:  Oh, it's a nightmare.

B.61:  I can't believe it.  You,

A.62:  Well, and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and
not, and not know how to read or write.

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  It's scary.

B.65:  Yeah, their, their awareness of the, of the, uh, current events and
geography, like you were mentioned early.
