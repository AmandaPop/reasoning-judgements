==========================================================================

A.1:  I think it was, uh, discuss crime in America.

B.2:  Oh, okay.

A.3:  And what we might be ab-, uh, do to, uh, help stop it.

@B.4:  Um.  Well, you're in quite a, um, interesting city for, um, crime, drugs
and all kinds of things that we hear about, aren't you?

A.5:  Oh, yeah.  Well, actually, I, I, I live in Houston.  I'm in Miami on
business.

B.6:  Oh, I see. #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  #Uh, but# I've, I've been down here quite a bit for the past, oh, six
months #on and,#

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  off.

B.10:  I see.

A.11:  And yes, there is plenty #of,#

B.12:  #Um# {faint}.

A.13:  crime in Miami.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Uh [throat_clearing] but, you know, um, I don't know that it's any worse
than Houston.

B.16:  Well, it's probab-, each city, I guess has its own specific type of
difficulty.

A.17:  And I know there's plenty of crime in Dallas, too.

B.18:  Oh, there's a lot of homicides in Dallas.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  That seems to be, uh, well, a lot of it is drug related, but I, I think
that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms
bearing, uh, you know, personal arms bearing [breathing] uh, and it, it seems
to just lend itself to instantaneous, um, [lipsmack] if you're, don't feel
good about a certain thing, there you go, and the crime is committed
[lipsmack].

A.21:  Yeah.  #I have,#

B.22:  #So, uh# {faint},

A.23:  uh, I was talking with some, w-, with a friend of mine not too damned long
ago [breathing] and I'll tell you, it, it's, you know, I don't expect this
would ever happen in the United States, but I'm almost of the opinion that the
only way that a change is going to come about is if, uh, we really put some
teeth into the law and, and make it such that, uh, the punishment fits the
crime.

B.24:  Um.

A.25:  And, uh, have a, a swift and, and sure justice.

B.26:  {Faint} Uh-huh.

A.27:  That, uh, you know, do away with some of these automatic, uh, appeals when,
uh, I think that guilt is proven.

B.28:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.  I'm not sure I know sufficiently about the ins and outs
of the law to, um, know exactly what that brings about, you know, the, the
appeals and things like that, as far as, the [breathing] people being, um,
retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence.  It does seem, though, that
the jail capacities are stretching to the #fullest,#

A.29:  #Well,#

B.30:  and, #uh,#

A.31:  #In,# in Houston it's absurd.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  They are letting, uh, uh, people that have been convicted three times for
armed robbery, for example, and this was, they had a big article in the
Houston newspaper about it.  Because of the overcrowding, they're being
released from Huntsville.  They're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus
for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer.  Less
than twenty percent or tw-, ten percent, it was a ridiculously low, low number,
actually do ever report to a par-, parole officer.  And #the,#

B.34:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.35:  vast majority of them are then caught again.

B.36:  Oh.

A.37:  Go through the courts, back to jail.  Well, it's ludicrous and #absurd.#

B.38:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.39:  And I, I just don't think that, you know, we as a society can afford to
continue #to have,#

B.40:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.41:  these people that are repeat offenders #being,#

B.42:  #Uh-huh.#

A.43:  paroled after serving a, a fraction, sometimes, you know, a quarter of
#their,#

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#

A.45:  sentence.

B.46:  That's right.

A.47:  But, uh, #I, I,#

B.48:  #Uh# {faint}.

A.49:  don't know.  It's, uh, I don't own a gun.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] I you know, I believe and I adhere to the
thought that [breathing] you know if you [breathing] so often, I mean it's
having a gun leads to tragedy.

B.52:  That's right.

A.53:  And at the #same,#

B.54:  #I believe# that.

A.55:  and at the same time, I think, I have thought before, what would I do if I
were accosted.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  You know?

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  A, a fellow I work with, uh, in Houston, he told me, uh, just this past
week, his wife was walking out of a mall, ten o'clock in the morning in
Houston, and was robbed.

B.60:  Oh, my.

A.61:  Broad open #daylight.#

B.62:  #In the# parking lot?

A.63:  In the parking lot.

B.64:  Oh, yes, uh-huh [breathing].  Um,

A.65:  So anyway, it, #it is,#

B.66:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.67:  it's a scary situation and I really don't know what this, what the #(( )).#

B.68:  #It's very# difficult to know what the answer is, and, uh, along with that,
there's a lot of p-, poverty, a lot of homeless, and [breathing] and a lot of,
um, I guess, um, discrimination is still around and, I, I suppose until
somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things, people are just
going to take an extreme [lipsmack] uh, measure and, um, uh, protect
themselves in one way or the other.

A.69:  Yeah, I've, I'm, I'm a firm believer, though, that, uh [throat_clearing]
our justice system has, has no teeth any longer, that the idea of getting a
sentence, uh, a-, and knowing that the parole, uh, will come, uh, uh, just in
a short matter of time, not only that, we have people in jail now that, I
mean, had a program on SIXTY MINUTES, I mean, that they have telephones --

B.70:  Oh.

A.71:  -- in their jail cells.  It's absurd.

B.72:  Oh, I didn't know that.

A.73:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I #don't know.#

B.74:  #Oh,# that's very strange.
