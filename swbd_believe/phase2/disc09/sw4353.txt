B.1:  Okay.  Thanks.

A.2:  Huh.  Do you all have a budget?

@B.3: Well, uh, yeah, we, we do.  Um, we've been married for twenty-three
years --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  -- and we have, uh, three teenage daughters and, you know, they're very
expensive.  So, uh, [smack] uh, we, yeah, we have somewhat of, uh, a system.
Uh, [smack] it's, it's kind of, uh, you know, it's kind of hard to explain.

A.6:  Yeah.

B.7:  We've actually gone, uh, just recently, to you know having, having two
checking accounts.  We always had just one.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  And now we are having two.  Uh, it's kind of hard to talk [noise] about
this because to me it's very personal.

A.10:  Yeah.  It's, #uh,#

B.11:  #So,# I have to be.  That's that's kind of the way I feel about it.

A.12:  Yeah.  I usually, uh, my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and
of course, we're ju-, like ther-, like a lot of people.  We just scramble
through month to month, you know.

B.13:  Yes.

A.14:  And, uh,

B.15:  Do you have a two income family or one income?

A.16:  Uh, we have a two income --

B.17:  Yeah.

A.18:  -- uh family.  She also works --

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  -- and, uh, but she, she enjoys it and she's good at it.  Uh, if it's, if
it's, I am kind of, uh, uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- and one of these days I am going to do something about that ((I
believe)) [laughter].

B.23:  Yeah.  #Yeah.#

A.24:  #You know# how that goes, but, uh, uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well.
She, uh --

B.25:  So your wife,

A.26:  -- she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.

B.27:  Yes.  It that what her, is her career, uh, related to, to finance or
accounting?

A.28:  Uh, sort of on a peripheral.  She's, uh, uh, an annuity administrator --

B.29:  Oh.

A.30:  -- and so she, uh, she works for an insurance company.

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  But, but she enjoys it.  She likes keeping track of all that stuff and, uh,

B.33:  Yeah, so that's sort of related to her field #a little bit.#

A.34:  #Yeah# sort of.

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  And we, you know, we've experimented with, with, uh, budgets, you know from
time to time, uh, but, if, you know, you have to keep up with them.  So a lot
of times, we just, uh, just kind of play it by ear.  We try to keep our, uh,
[noise] our retirement and our savings kind of automated --

B.37:  Yeah.

A.38:  -- so we never see that money.  Just like taken #directly.#

B.39:  #It's just# taking it out, right.  #Right.  Yeah.#

A.40:  #Yeah.#

B.41:  Yeah.  #We do the same thing.#

A.42:  #And that, that's kind of handy.# Yeah, because if you don't see it, you
don't miss it (( )) [laughter].

B.43:  Yeah, #if# --

A.44:  #You don't spend it.#

B.45:  -- you have something to take it out.  That's exactly what we've always
done --

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  -- and we've had, uh, they've always had, uh, where they match your funds,
you know, sometimes --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- if you, if you save so much, then they will match it.  Uh, that, you
know, we've done that too.  But, my husband works for an insurance company --

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  -- and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I
guess.  But he was with another company before that, but we have, we have, I,
I work also, but I only have a part time job --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- and I get paid very little but, uh, you know, I try to use that money
for food mo-, Jim gives me a certain amount money.  You know, we just transfer
it --

A.54:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

B.55:  -- into my account and then I use that for food, household expenses, and
then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle, you know,
some of the clothes that the girls need --

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  -- and things like that, but the expenses that we need and have around the
house.

A.58:  Yeah.  #It# --

B.59:  #So.#

A.60:  -- sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do.  Just kind of --

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  -- play it by ear, but keep the, the #deductions# --

B.63:  #Yeah, we# --

A.64:  -- you know #(( )).#

B.65:  -- #well Jim# has, Jim has a budget.  I mean he works it out every month
--

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  -- and breaks it all down.  Uh, you know.  I am given so much mon-, money a
month, so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that.

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  So, I try not to, you know, we don't, you know, I don't ask for more.  I
mean I just try and make it on that.

A.70:  Uh-huh.  Yeah {very faint}.

B.71:  Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go
crazy --

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  -- with all the choices that you have --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- and, uh, you can, [noise] you can really waste a lot of money that way.

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  So, uh, well how long have you been married?

A.78:  Uh, about five years.  Yeah.

B.79:  Oh, yeah.  So you're just really getting started [laughter].

A.80:  [Laughter].

B.81:  So do you have a family too?

A.82:  Uh, I've got one little girl.  She's like, uh, nineteen months.

B.83:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

A.84:  So, uh, she's, she's not, uh, 

B.85:  She hasn't effected your budget yet really.

A.86:  Not, not really.  Not too #bad.  Uh.#

B.87:  #No.#  Not like she will later on.

A.88:  Yeah.

B.89:  You will see #that# --

A.90:  #Yeah when,# 

B.91:  -- all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are
going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have
of activities to do --

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  -- and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford --

A.94:  Yeah.

B.95:  -- you know, what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and
plan some more and, uh, but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't
have much of a budget --

A.96:  Yeah.

B.97:  -- [Smack] and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and
more of that.  You know, more budgeting as as they got older.

A.98:  Uh-huh.

B.99:  Uh, but uh, but what do you do?  Do you,

A.100:  I'm uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.

B.101:  Oh, okay.

A.102:  I work at a, for a university.  Uh, Georgia Tech, uh, research --

B.103:  Oh.  Well good.

A.104:  -- and, uh,

B.105:  Good.

A.106:  #So I just, uh,# 

B.107:  #Well, we just have,# you know, we have a good friend that's about to move
to Atlanta.  I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things.  I'd better
get back to the subject.

A.108:  Oh, well [laughter].

B.109:  But, uh, budgeting.  I found, you know, I feel a lot better.  You know, we
use to work out of one check book --

A.110:  Uh-huh.

B.111:  -- and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't
have any idea how much money I was spending #in one month.#

A.112:  #Yeah.#

B.113:  Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending and it's so much easier,
