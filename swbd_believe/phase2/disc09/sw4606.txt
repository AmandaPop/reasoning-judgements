A.1:  Hello.

B.2:  [Laughter] Phil here, in Rochester, New York.

A.3:  My goodness.  Well, I'm in Texas so I soun-, I found, sound very Texan.

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter] Uh,

B.6:  Well, this should be an easy one.  I, so much so, ((like)) we could, we
have lots to talk about [laughter].

A.7:  Well, what, what do you subscribe to or are you ready for me to press one
and, and let's continue our conversation?

B.8:  Yeah, that would be all right.

A.9:  Okay, hold on [beep].

B.10:  Okay.

A.11:  Wha-, what magazines do you prescribe to or do you have?

@B.12:  Uh, actually, it would be easier to tell you what I don't get
#[laughter].#

A.13:  #Okay.#

B.14:  Because, I, uh, I receive TIME, NEWSWEEK, and the U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
every week --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- I get, you know, all the news magazines [sniffing] and pretty much
everything associated with my hobby which includes gardening magazines and,
uh, uh, uh, radio and things like that --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- so I, I'm just loaded over here [laughter].

A.19:  Well, I'm not see.  I, I, I take TIME and, uh, uh, uh, off and on during my
life I've taken, uh, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING so there's, I work so much and then
when I'm not working, then I'm active in, I do, I do not do the, the, enough
reading like I should.

B.20:  Yeah, I, I, since I'm in radio up here, I have to try and stay informed
with, uh --

A.21:  Certainly.

B.22:  -- what goes on around there.  I, I like NEWSWEEK better than I like TIME.
I, you know, magazines for me, I get behind but I like them because, uh, the,
especially with the news magazines, you get much more analysis than the
newspaper can give --

A.23:  #Right.#

B.24:  -- #and, uh,# I'm interested also in reading some of the stories that just
aren't big enough to make into the local papers here.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  And, uh, of course, you know, for gardening I, I get BETTER HOMES AND
GARDENS up here.  Mainly I get gardening information, maybe some receipts and
sometimes these things have coupons in them too.

A.27:  Right, right.

B.28:  And that, more or less, pays for your subscription.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  Well I'm, I'm very conservative so I don't, uh, uh, I'm a single
parent so I don't blow a lot of money in anywhere #[laughter].#

B.30:  #Sure,# sure.  Oh, yeah.  It, that's the thing.  You know, they, they have
to be careful about which ones you get because they can be really expensive if
#you're# --

A.31:  #Right.#

B.32:  -- not careful, not to mention finding the time to read them.  It's even
hard for me, I'd, I have mail buckets full of magazines I haven't had a chance
[laughter] to look at yet [laughter].

A.33:  Right.  Well, see that, uh, I's, rea-, I's, I do good to even get through
[throat_clearing] excuse me, I do good to get through TIME sometimes
#[laughter].#

B.34:  #[Laughter]# Yeah, tha-, I, I, I like TIME a little bit, uh, I, it's
probably my second favorite of the news #magazines.#

A.35:  #Well you# think NEWSWEEK might be a better?

B.36:  I like NEWSWEEK better, uh, because they have, uh, a couple of things I
like.  They have the cartoons and the quotes in there which I think are funny.

A.37:  Huh.  

B.38:  And some of the stories, you know, they have the analysis like all the rest
of them do but they also get some more offbeat stories --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- which, uh, I'm interested in finding out more about and it seems, just
to me, to be a better read than TIME.  TIME is my second favorite.

A.41:  Uh-huh [inhaling].

B.42:  Uh, TIME excels at the coverage of in-depth issues, you know.  If you want
to really find out something in-depth and learn about it, TIME is a good
magazine.

A.43:  Right.  #Well what# --

B.44:  #And U S,# 

@@A.45:  -- about, wha-, in your, I'm asking all, uh, i, uh, uh, really different
question in a way, but since you are in the, in the public, what is, what does
your area feel about abortion?  Do you, d-, is there any general consensus or
#or,# 

B.46:  #[Talking] {in background} Well I,# I kind of fall down in to the choice
category just because, really, as a man, I really, you know, I don't
particularly believe that I have a particular say over what someone else, some
woman has, you know, she --

A.47:  #Right.#

B.48:  -- #has# her choice to do.

A.49:  Well, we won't fight over this because, you know, I, me, myself, I don't
know that, I'm forty-six.  I don't know that I ever could have or ever would
have an abortion.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  But now at forty-six, let me tell you one thing, I'd have an abortion if I
were to become pregnant --

B.52:  #Yeah.#

A.53:  -- #but# [laughter] don't intend to, you know.  But, uh, you know, j-, ju-,
leave my body alone.  I have my choices --

B.54:  #Yeah that,#

A.55:  -- #and, uh,# and I feel, I really, you know, I don't believe in, in
getting pregnant when, if there's any way to prevent it but it happens all the
time, you know.  I have a, a sister-in-law that had her --

B.56:  Huh.

A.57:  -- tubes tied nine years ago before she had her little bouncing baby boy.

B.58:  Sure.

A.59:  You know.  So there's things like that happen.  Of course now, they, they
didn't, she wouldn't consider an abortion, but they didn't intend for that
third child, you know, intend to have that third child.  But, uh, you know,
just, uh, I've seen Jane Fonda, I've, I watch very little T V also, but I've
seen Jane Fonda on T V at my mother's house and she said, tells you, she's
telling the government to stay out of her womb and I feel that way, you know.
You've got enough business, you've got enough problems, you've got enough
fraud, you've got enough, uh, you know,
