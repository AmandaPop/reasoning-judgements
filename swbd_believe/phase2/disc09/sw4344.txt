==========================================================================

A.1:  What, well, what kind of job do you have?

B.2:  Well, right now I'm just working, uh, temporary, just for a week or so at a
[lipsmack], uh, communication center --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- and so basically I wear, uh, I can wear casual dress or casual pants.

A.5:  Oh, okay.  

B.6:  I don't really dress up a whole bunch.  

A.7:  I-, is that because you're a student or,

B.8:  No, uh,

A.9:  Uh,

B.10:  I'm, I've just been at home -- 

A.11:  Oh, okay.  

B.12:  -- for a while --

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  -- and so I'm just,

A.15:  Well, I'm a student, that's why I was asking.  

B.16:  Oh [laughter].   

A.17:  And, uh [breathing], I, uh, I haven't been working this semester.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  So I don't really have, uh, much to say about that, but I do work in the
hospitals once a week.

B.20:  Oh. 

A.21:  Uh, I,

B.22:  They have really strict clothing rules -- 

A.23:  Yeah -- 

B.24:  -- don't they?  

A.25:  -- I have, I wear a uniform -- 

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- a nursing uniform so I don't really have much choice [laughter].

B.28:  Yeah, I went to school with some nurses and the cost of those was kind of
expensive I thought.

A.29:  Yeah, they, they tend to be pretty expensive.  

B.30:  They look like they'd last a while.  

A.31:  Uh, yeah, they should, uh, unless you just buy a few and w-, keep wearing
those --

B.32:  Oh.  

A.33:  -- all the time.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  And,   

B.36:  That's what I do [laughter].  

A.37:  Yeah, and people tend to use bleach on them -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- because, you know, you want them to stay white -- 

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  But, uh, [lipsmack] I'm hoping mine, my one [laughter] uniform will last
me a long time until I have to start working more days.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  And there's not much of a selection, at least in my price range, like
styles or things of,

B.46:  Yeah, they seem to all be, all the uniforms, even like in the fast-food and
everything, I mean, they're the, it's just different colors it seems like.

A.47:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.48:  They're all kind of alike.  

A.49:  So, uh,

B.50:  I, I used to work in a dentist's office and there I had to dress up and,

A.51:  Oh, you did?  

B.52:  Yeah, and I usually wore a dress most of the time or --

A.53:  Oh, okay.

B.54:  -- uh, dress pants and that gets expensive [laughter].  

A.55:  That sure does.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Yeah.  Were you a receptionist?  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  Oh, okay.  

B.60:  I mean, sometimes I think it's cheaper to stay home than -- 

A.61:  Yeah -- 

B.62:  -- because at home I -- 

A.63:  -- Definitely.  

B.64:  -- just wear, like, joggers or Levi's or -- 

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- you know, whatever's -- 

A.67:  (( )) sounds good.   

B.68:  -- comfortable and [laughter] I don't care what people think. 

A.69:  Right.  

B.70:  [Laughter]. 

A.71:  Also, the shoes are expensive.  

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  That's,

B.74:  And to find ones that are comfortable, you really have to pay. 

A.75:  Yeah, that's really tough.  Before I went back to school, I work as a, uh,
what do you call it, can't even remember, it's been,

B.76:  [Laughter]. 

A.77:  so long.  Uh, office administrator or -- 

B.78:  Oh, wow.  

A.79:  -- whatever it, one of those titles.  

B.80:  Like an office manager like?  

A.81:  Uh, sort of. 

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  And, it was mu-, a more of a casual, uh, atmosphere, but I still wore
dresses and things like that, so, I mean it was for a, uh, non-profit
organization.

B.84:  Oh, yeah.  

A.85:  So,   

B.86:  Well, you always try to look professional, but it's just, 

A.87:  Right.  

B.88:  I don't know, I always have a hard time between comfort and --

A.89:  Yeah.  

B.90:  -- looking nice because when you're working all day, sometimes you, I don't
know, comfort seems to come first [laughter].

A.91:  [Laughter] I agree.  I, I really, I totally agree.  I have a friend that
has a knack for looking really stylish --

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- but always comfortable.  

B.94:  Oh, wow.  

A.95:  Yeah, she's really good at doing that.  

B.96:  Because I've seen a lot of people that always look really hot, but I'd n-,
I could never make it through a #day wearing# --

A.97:  #Exactly# [laughter].  

B.98:  -- what they're wearing, you know [laughter].  Like -- 

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  -- how did you fit in that.  

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  But, and the high heels, I, I don't know, I guess I'm -- 

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  -- (( )).

A.105:  Well, she, she, you don't have to wear high heels to look good.

B.106:  That's true.  

A.107:  Yeah.  

B.108:  That is.  

A.109:  She never wore high, she's an engineer and she -- 

B.110:  Oh, wow.  

A.111:  -- never, yeah, she never wore high heels, just flats and low, low heels.

B.112:  And a longer skirt.  

A.113:  Uh-huh.  

B.114:  See, that's -- 

A.115:  More the -- 

B.116:  -- what I like.  

A.117:  -- classic look.  

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  Yeah.  See, that doesn't have to be uncomfortable.  

B.120:  It looks so much more natural.  

A.121:  Yeah, but you're right, I think those things tend to be more expensive.

B.122:  Yeah.  Well --

A.123:  Yeah {faint}.

B.124:  -- and quality, because, I don't know, I try to find things that, uh, even
if I'm not working that I can wear or else --

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- that I know will last, you know, not just for this year -- 

A.127:  Right.  

B.128:  -- then be out of style or something, and those usually cost a little bit,
but sometimes in the long run I'm sure they're cheaper.

A.129:  Yeah, because, uh, also you tend to, those things don't go out of style --

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  -- so much and, uh, I find,

B.132:  Some of the fads.  

A.133:  Right.  

B.134:  [Laughter]. 

A.135:  Yeah, and since I'm a student, I never buy fad clothes because I know
they'll be out of style the next --

B.136:  Yeah.  

A.137:  -- season and then I have to go buy more [laughter].  

B.138:  Yeah.  

A.139:  So I just don't buy any.  

B.140:  Where I went to school, though, a l-, at college, a lot of them, I mean, I
mean, I've never been one to feel pressured into wearing styles just because
everyone else is, but --

A.141:  Uh-huh.  

B.142:  -- I couldn't believe how some of the college people dress because, you
know, I always think of low inc-, I, at least I was low income --

A.143:  I know.   

B.144:  -- going to school, you know, and it was like,
