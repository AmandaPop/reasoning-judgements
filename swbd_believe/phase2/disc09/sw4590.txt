==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, do you have any brilliant i-, {mispronounced} ideas about how to reduce
crime?

@B.2:  No, I really don't.  They need to do more with, uh, you know, the police
forces.  They need to make sure you have more people out on the street, I
think.  You know, to try to keep track what's going on and be harder on
criminals when they go to court, you know.  Make sure they go to jail and they
serve all their term.  #But other than that# --

A.3:  #It seems,# 

B.4:  -- I don't really know.  What about you?

A.5:  Well, it, it seems like such a catch twenty-two, you know.  My first
inclination is to say stop being so lenient.  When people do something rotten,
you keep them in jail and you make them know that you se-, that you're very
serious --

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  -- [Cough] {in background} uh, but then, again, uh, the taxing
situation, you know, how can we pay to keep all these people in jail.  That's
when you say well don't raise my taxes, you know, maybe we shouldn't lock up
the guy who has too many traffic tickets.  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't do this,
an-, you know, and then #you [cough] {in background}# --

B.8:  #Right.#

A.9:  -- start, start eroding it, you know --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- I substitute teach.  I deal with high school kids and --

B.12:  Oh, you do.

A.13:  -- and I, I find that attitudes at home are such, I mean the kids will
curse right in front of my face and they won't even go oops, you know, they,
they just have no regard and I'm not saying they're going to turn into
criminals but I think it is a general trend toward people just [talking]
relaxing their standards so much and I think that's why we have more crime
because #parents# --

B.14:  #That's true.#

A.15:  -- and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  #Well,# 

A.17:  #And they# just keep pushing.

B.18:  I believe, I believe that's true.  I think you have to do more, the
teachers as well, education.  But before they get to the high school, of
course.  Because, by then, they're pretty much set, I think.  #You start# --

A.19:  #Yeah, well# you know --

B.20:  -- way back #when.#

A.21:  -- #and generally,# you know, a kid will do something that's outrageous and
they'll say well what are you going to do to me and it's almost like the
criminal system, 

B.22:  [Talking].

A.23:  there's not much I can do to them.  I can't really do anything to them.
One fellow said, I said how about you do your work and he said well, how about
I throw these scissors at you and instead of getting, ((uh)), flustered, I said
well I wish you would because then I can really punish you --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- I can send you to detention, et cetera.  If you just bad mouth me in
general and giving me a hard time there's really nothing I can do.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  An-, and I think, you know, minor criminals feel the same way, like what
are [laughter] they going to do #and# --

B.28:  #Right.#

A.29:  -- and, I think that's the, the biggest thing [bird_squawking] that unless
people know that you're serious and you're not going to tolerate that kind of
behavior in anybody, I, this is just going to keep going.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think it's like the problem with, you know, drunk drivers
that people don't, they're not cracking down, they let them back out on the
street, they don't really take away their license, they don't really make sure
they can't drive anymore, so people don't think it is any big deal and they
just go out and do it again.  #Nothing's going# --

A.31:  #Well, we had a,# 

B.32:  -- to happen to them [/talking].

A.33:  Yeah, we had a big incident at the local high school.  A teacher who
happened to be a parent and four girls were, uh, in a horrible head-on
accident.  A drunk driver hit them, uh, 

B.34:  [Talking]. 

A.35:  the people who were in the car who got hit, two of them died and
two of them seriously injured.  This guy, you know, crossed a divider.
He had been arrested twice for drunk dri-, driving, uh, they didn't
lock him up.  They took his license away but they didn't take away his
car key --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- you know, there he was, you know, [laughter] it's like, you know, in
the old Arab countries, you know, you steal they take your hand away.  I mean,
this guy can still drive, as long as he can get into a car, #he's driving# --  

B.38:  #Right.#  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- #you know, he's,# 

B.40:  #So, it doesn't# do any good.  People just do it again.

A.41:  #Yeah and I,# 

B.42:  #Same thing with# when you have, like sexual offenders and you don't make
sure they have adequate counselling, then they just go out and do it again
because you haven't really fixed their problem at all.

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  So and that's ((probably)) part of the problem too because do you bother
counselling these people or you make them go to jail.  Will it really do them
any good to counsel them or is it just going to waste taxpayers' money.

A.45:  Well, you know, I think counselling is kind of like dieting.  Until you
decide you really want it to work, you know [laughter] --

B.46:  Right, #right.#

A.47:  -- #it, it's not# going to work anyway.

B.48:  Yeah.  #And the problem is,# 

A.49:  #You have# to cooperate with that kind of stuff.  #I, I# --

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  -- it's a real scary problem.  I don't know what the answers are.

B.52:  I guess that's why we have the problem.  Nobody seems to know what to do
about it [laughter].

A.53:  [Laughter]. 

B.54:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.

A.55:  You know, and then they bring up the thing about, uh, whether we should
have death penalties.  Uh, I guess, you know, th-, the top of the, the bad guy
ladder may be, you know, some of those people would be affected, but there's
lots of crime going on besides murder where --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- you know, it's still out of hand.

B.58:  I'm just afraid that if you put back in the death penalty, every place that
((people will be)), uh, the juries won't want to convict a person because 
(( )) they're, they're really innocent because once ((and)) you kill them,
they're gone.

A.59:  #Right [laughter].#

B.60:  #You can't# like fix the problem so there will be that much, you know, they
will be really, really worried about sending them to jail when they really
should be in jail.  They will be like, well I don't know and the people who
don't want to put them, you know, to death, who think that's wrong, won't
convict them either even if they really believe they're guilty because they're
really just (( )) on their part, things like that.

A.61:  My husband makes a joke about well an armed society is a polite society.
If, if good guys had guns as well as bad [laughter] guys then, you know, maybe
that wouldn't be.  But I said no, you still have survival of the fittest
because, you know, then the bad guys would become better at using the guns
[laughter] #you know.#

B.62:  #Right, right.#  And if nobody had guns, they would just use some 
other [/talking],
