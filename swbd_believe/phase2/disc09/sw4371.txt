==========================================================================

A.1:  So, Rick -- 

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- you thinking about buying a new car?  

B.4:  Yeah, I am, uh, a truck.  

A.5:  A truck?  

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  Uh, Japanese or American?  

B.8:  Think I'm going to buy American this time [laughter].  

A.9:  You [laughter], this time?  You had a -- 

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  -- Japanese,

B.12:  I got a, yeah, we got a Toyota, two of them actually.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  They, uh, they've always been real good cars, but it's just, uh,

A.15:  They rust.  

B.16:  Well [breathing], I actually haven't had any problem with them at all, but,
uh, I, I think it's probably pretty important to, uh, to buy American.  I've,
I'm coming to that conclusion.

A.17:  You know, it's like, I'm, I've been driving like foreign cars now for, for
years and --

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- I, I'm actually thinking about buying a new car.  I, I, I'm, I'm sitting
here right now, it's like m-, --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- with a thousand dollars worth of repairs on my car.  

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  [Laughter] And, uh, I'm thinking about buying an American car also.

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  Uh, I, I think they're to the point now where they're just, they're just as
good as --

B.26:  I, yeah, I do -- 

A.27:  -- those foreign cars.  

B.28:  -- too.  I, I think, uh,

A.29:  [Cough]. 

B.30:  I've, I've had pickup trucks before, and I've had, uh, Chevrolets and they
were pretty good, but I, I think, uh, Ford, uh, is --

A.31:  That,   

B.32:  -- is pretty much focusing on quality.  

A.33:  That's the best, actually, uh, a guy that like is, in the next office, he,
uh, he's thinking about buying a truck and he's looking at an F one fifty --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- and, uh, he, one thing is defined about the, about the, the F one
fifties is that, uh, they a-, every, the word is out that they are like the
best truck.

B.36:  Is that right?  Yeah.  

A.37:  Uh, especially, like, if you want to get, like, you know, heavier than a
mini pick up --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- and, uh, they weren't cutting too many deals with, uh, with the prices
on the F one fifties, especially like in the, in the four wheel drive models
--

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- but, uh, I, I, I guess like all these people can't be that wrong --

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- you know, in terms of, uh, of how that, how they are.  

B.44:  Yeah, I was looking in, uh, it was, uh, I, I forget the name of the
magazine, used to be CHANGING TIMES, sort of like a CONSUMER REPORTS magazine
--

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- and, uh, they were saying that Ford Ranger was the number one selling
truck --

A.47:  Now, the Ranger -- 

B.48:  -- counting all of,

A.49:  -- is that, the Ranger is below the one fifty?  

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  It's like a, it's like a three quarter ton truck?

B.52:  Yeah, something, I believe something like that.  

A.53:  And was, is, and the, and the F one fifty is a ton and a half or, or I'm
not sure where they sit.

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  [Cough]. 

B.56:  I'm not sure.  I, I kind of think I'd like to go with a, something around
a, a one fifty.  I don't want a full size, but I don't want, uh, ((one of
those)) little, uh, mini trucks either.

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  Besides, I probably would look at something, uh, maybe a, a V six.

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  You know.  

A.61:  You going to get a King Cab?  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  Yeah that,

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  that, that, d-, you know, do you have any, any kids or anything?

B.66:  Yeah, I've got one little girl and, and, and a set of golf clubs, so
[laughter], 

A.67:  Oh, there you go, yeah.  You, you [laughter], you got to have, you got to
have --

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  -- just that extra space.  

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  It y-,

B.72:  Yeah, that's it.  

A.73:  The, uh, the, it's a, a buddy of mine, he just, he just bought a truck and,
uh, and it was a thing, was like, it would, there was no thought whatsoever
about not getting the extra size cab --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- even though, you can't really use, use that back area for a seat, you
know --

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- unless you're s-, like some kind of contortionist.  

B.78:  Uh.  

A.79:  [Cough] But, you just need it because, you do carry, you do carry stuff
that --

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  -- you don't want to like just throw in the bed.  

B.82:  Yeah, I, I kind of like,

A.83:  [Cough]. 

B.84:  ((the)) looks of the short bed, but, or the short cab, but --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- but, uh, you know, like I say, just y-, you just really need the extra
space, y-, unless you have some sort of a cab, you know --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- (( )) cover or something but,

A.89:  You'd get air-conditioning because w-, you're down there is pretty hot,
right?

B.90:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.91:  Uh-huh, that,

B.92:  Although, uh, I, I notice y-, y-, you said rust, ((right before that)),
that, we don't have that much problem down here --

A.93:  Uh,

B.94:  -- but I know you all have it up there.  I guess they salt the roads and,

A.95:  Oh, boy, I'll tell you, that's like, that's the number one car killer up
here --

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  -- is that, is the, is the rust, you know, it's like you're, you're
constantly taking, about every other, about every month during the winter, you
know, the smart thing to do is to go to like one of those, uh, drive in car
washes --

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- do it yourself -- 

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  -- and just fire a bunch of water underneath, you know up into your rocker
panels --

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  -- and stuff, because, uh, it just, like I said, it, it just eats the cars
like right alive.

B.104:  Yeah, I guess, I, I, as I was working with some people from Buffalo here
recently, or, actually, it was a couple years ago, but they were, they were
saying, you know, a lot of people up there, they got a winter car and then a
summer car [laughter], you know.

A.105:  [Laughter] Fac-, my neighbor's in the exact same sit-, situation.  It's
like he, uh, he has, he has two cars.  One of them is a, is a, a Mitsubishi,
you know, uh, I don't know, what is, a Starion, or, it's one of those hot cars
--

B.106:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.107:  -- and, uh, it's like come, come November when the roads like start to get,
you know, to get nasty, the Starion goes, like into the, into the garage --

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  -- then he closes it and locks it and then he, he throws, he, he pull, he
throws a tarp off of this beater that he's got in the backyard,

B.110:  Out comes the,

A.111:  [Cough]. 

B.112:  sixty-eight Nova.  

A.113:  And, I think it's a, it's actually like a, it's like an eighty-two, no,
yeah, it's like an eighty-two Toyota --

B.114:  Yeah.  

A.115:  -- Corolla -- 

B.116:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.117:  -- [Laughter] you know.  And this guy goes through this like role, you
know, this r-, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde,

B.118:  [Laughter].

A.119:  revert,
