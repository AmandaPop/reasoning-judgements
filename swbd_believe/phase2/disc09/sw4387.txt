A.1:  Um, what's your favorite kind of music?

@B.2:  Uh, it, it varies.  I-, it's totally dependent upon what mood I'm in.  

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  It can be anything from classical to, uh, uh, [static] rock and roll.

A.5:  Uh, not hard rock I take it?

B.6:  No, not hard rock.  I'm, I'm talking like Elton John or --

A.7:  Oh, yeah.

B.8:  -- uh, Steve Winwood or something like that.

A.9:  Yeah.  Well, I think I'm, I kind of agree with you on those.  Uh, 

B.10:  [Static].

A.11:  do you go to any concerts?

B.12:  Uh, usually, [static] the, the album sounds better than the concert and I
don't like fighting the crowds #[laughter].#

A.13:  #[Laughter]# Well you have a point there.  Uh, I've been to a few and
really enjoy them.  Uh, saw the Kingston Trio once.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Live and that's, that's an experience.  Uh, saw one in Vegas not too long
ago.  The Four Tops and the, shoot, another group.

B.16:  Yeah, yeah.  Come to think of it, I saw the Four Tops, uh, 

A.17:  [Cough].

B.18:  about three years ago.

A.19:  Fabulous show.  I mean high energy like you would, oh, the Temptation, the
Temptations, no.

B.20:  Yeah.  It, it was a lot of fun.

A.21:  Yeah.  But it was just so high energy and, and just an exciting show.  

B.22:  #It was,# 

A.23:  #I# do have symphony tickets for the first time this year so I'm getting
lots of doses of classical music [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah.  That, 

A.25:  [Cough].

B.26:  that, that's is something I, I'd rather, it's one of those things where I
have a very stressful day at work and then I'll get home and let's, uh, pick,
pick out a, something on the symphony.  Something that will really relax me.

A.27:  Yeah.  Yeah but,

B.28:  And, uh, that, that's where that is.  And the one thing, uh, I guess it's
opera is the only kind of music that I, I, I don't care for and, uh,
traditional country and western which I find offensive #[laughter].#

A.29:  #[Laughter]# I, I agree.  And where I grew up in New Mexico, we couldn't
get much else on the radio station #[laughter].#

B.30:  #[Laughter].#  

A.31:  It was, it was really rough [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter].  

A.33:  But, uh, but classical music, I think, is probably my favorite.

B.34:  Yeah.  Like I, like I said,

A.35:  [Cough].

B.36:  it depends upon the mood that I'm in.  Uh, I, I prefer instrumental over
{mispronounced} over,

A.37:  [Cough].

B.38:  anything.  But what I don't like is listening to a, a station that will
play, uh, I guess it's elevator music where they, they have people that have
re-, have redone the song.

A.39:  Oh, yeah.

B.40:  It's, it, if, if, if I'm going to listen to something like WHITE CHRISTMAS,

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  I want to hear Bing Crosby sing it.  I don't want to hear somebody else
sing it.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Uh, I'm, I'm a firm believer in the person who made the song popular that's
who I want to listen to.

A.45:  Yes, I agree with that.

B.46:  Regardless of how good the remake is #[laughter].#

A.47:  #[Laughter] That's right.#  

B.48:  Or how good they think the remake is [laughter].

A.49:  Oh, a, an exception to the classical music though.  The thing I like is the
sound track or the stage recording of the, uh, Santa (( )) Opera.

B.50:  Yes.  That, that, that's,

A.51:  [Cough].

B.52:  really good.  I enjoy that.  Uh, and that's where,

A.53:  [Cough].

B.54:  very rarely, live recordings of, uh, symphony music is good where they,
they have to get everyone in the studio to do it right [swallowing], depending
upon which hall they're in.  Cause I've listened to some, uh, albums or C D
-s, where the live recording, they did it in a, an auditorium or hall that was
horrible {mispronounced} acoustics and it just kind of washed out the very
highs and the very lows and you had this what sounded like mud music.

A.55:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  Yeah.

B.56:  It was like why bother.

A.57:  We're, we're blessed in Dallas with a new symphony center.  Just a few
years old.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  It was designed by I M Pei and it's absolutely fabulous.  I mean every note
[laughter].  #It's just# --

B.60:  #Oh, boy.#

A.61:  -- it, it's something else [laughter].  I've tried to get tickets to the
Pops concert, uh, series next year, along with the symphony.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  So I, I really haven't heard anything in this marvelous hall except for the
classical music and the Christmas concert.

B.64:  Uh, Christmas concerts are a lot of fun.

A.65:  Yes.  Oh, this was, this was, uh, so exciting when everybody stood up and
su-, sang a couple of the songs and we've got a few thousand people singing
[laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] Tha-,

A.67:  And they could drown me out with my bad voice [laughter].

B.68:  Well, with my voice I'm glad that they drown me out [laughter].  I can't, I
can't, uh, sing worth a darn.

A.69:  Yeah.  Uh, you said you liked instrumental music.  Are you partial to
pianos or guitars or #do you prefer?#

B.70:  #Yes, I, in,# when I was in college I got a minor in a music composition
with, uh, heading toward piano.

A.71:  Oh, is that right?

B.72:  And, uh, I, I enjoy, I really enjoy, essentially, any type of keyboard.
Whether it be, uh, uh, good organ music or, uh, uh, harpsichord, clavichord,
piano, uh, and even to, uh, synthesizer when it's done well.

A.73:  Uh-huh.
