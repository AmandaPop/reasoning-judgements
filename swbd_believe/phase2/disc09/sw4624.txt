REMARKS:        Speaker A tended to run his words together and stuttered
some.  It was difficult to understand him.

============================================================================

A.1:  ((Okay)).  It, it's, I, I'm, I'm not sure i-, if there's anything I could
really term invasion of privacy that ha-, happens regularly except maybe like
telemarketers and things.

B.2:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, I have the problem with the telemarketers over
here.  We get, we get all types.  We get the handicapped people calling up
here.

A.3:  You want to buy some light bulbs?

B.4:  That's right [laughter].

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  And, uh, if you don't want the light bulbs, there's vitamins and if you
don't want the vitamins, there's the household cleaner --

A.7:  Pens.

B.8:  -- no, [snorting] I've had, I, w-, I just today was looking into an
organization called Catholic War Veterans because they #were bugging,# 

A.9:  #Boy, they, they, they're# tugging on a few strings at once, aren't they
[laughter]?

B.10:  Yeah, they were, uh, bugging me for a donation earlier and I, I, you know,
I get these calls on one line just constantly --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- every single organization and, you know, you, it's, I've learned to hang
up on them but sometimes it's not so easy [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah, I, I got some call last night.  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, thi-,
this was like, thi-, this is kind of an invasion of privacy where, uh, I went
to a wedding expo because I'm getting married.  And, uh, there are like, you
know, uh, these places where they say, you know, sign, sign up for a free
whatever, you know, f-, for a drawing --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- and you do it and, you know, all of a sudden this guy is calling you and
saying Hi, we want to call, you know, and talk about video taping your
wedding.  When shall we set a time up and I couldn't get the guy to get off
the phone.

B.16:  #[Laughter].#

A.17:  #It's like how# many, what, what part of no didn't you understand, you
know.

B.18:  [Laughter] Well, it's the same thing with these oil well people.  What do
you mean, you don't want to get rich?  [laughter].  The other thing that I, I
think is amusing are these long distance companies now.  We have M C I here.

A.19:  Yeah, same here.

B.20:  And, uh, they have their friends and #family# --

A.21:  #Family.#  Right. 

B.22:  -- program and I love it.  You can call up on one of the lines.  #The,#

A.23:  #Yeah I# did.  They, they fixed it so you had to give some information
#((out, but)).#

B.24:  #Well, there's# another one.  The account balance line, all you got to know
is the person's zip code --

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  -- and you can find out how they're paying their M C I bills and, an-, on
anyone, you know.  All you got to do is cross reference a phone number with a
zip code [sigh] which isn't too difficult and --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- you can learn all sorts of things and Sprint does the same thing and,
#an-,# 

A.29:  #((They)),# I, I think, in general, you know, technology, as nice as it is,
is causing a lot, it's just too easy now to, it's like, you know, ((pay
banks)) used to be, you know, you could do anything over the phone.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  You had to know your pin number but I could jus-, I could just say to it
empty my whole account out if I wanted.  Transfer things and there, there's a
lot of, of risk involved there because, you know, it, it's like, you know, the
best example is probably credit reports now.

B.32:  Huh.

A.33:  Wher-, where, you know, God knows what goes on those things.  I mean, th-,
thankfully now you can get your reports for free.  At least from T I W.  But,
i-, it's like,

B.34:  [Throat_clearing].

A.35:  it's this anonymous thing where anyone can dump any information they want
about you in there with no real opportunity to rebut unless you want to go and
get the report and then, y-, y-, you know, th-, th-, then you find out, you
can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these
people been, you know, dumping information about you in there and I've heard
of cases where it was just done vindictively.

B.36:  Yeah, we had, uh, we got a report back in the mail, as a matter of fact and
found all sorts of problems with it.  Mainly account numbers that have changed
and they left both accounts #showing# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- as open and, uh, some other one that claimed I didn't pay them and I did
and then you have to try and get that company to take you off --

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  -- #and# they don't really want to bother and,

A.41:  Yeah.  When I, when I applied for my Gold Mastercard, they said well you
have to close this other Mastercard out (( )).  You mean the one I closed two
years ago?

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  And I had to get a letter from this other company saying that I had closed
it.

B.44:  Oh yeah.  It's a pain in the neck because they, you know, th-, they'll
believe these companies in a second over the individual and getting proof for
these people, I mean it's not my job.  You're the one that screwed up and, you
know, if you want to damage my credit rating that's fine, but I will take
whatever actions are appropriate to protect it, like lawsuit [laughter].

A.45:  Oh, it, it's very slippery though because, you know, it's, i-, one of the
things you do when you, when you sign those little credit applications is
there's all sorts of disclaimer {mispronounced} at the bottom about how, you
know, you're permitting them to d-, do credit checks of you and to make your
information available to other people.  And by the time you get through
reading it, you've basically permitted them to, you know, broadcast on the
evening news your credit rating.

B.46:  Yeah [laughter].  I know, I know.  It's just that con-, we need to have
stronger consumer protection laws #and# --

A.47:  #Right.#  #Right.#

B.48:  -- #we just# don't seem to be able to get the government to do it.  

A.49:  Well, you know, there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of,

B.50:  [Cough].

A.51:  privacy, like every time you call an eight hundred number, you're giving
them your phone number.

B.52:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I've been reading the ((comp-, Dcom telecom))
#((all about it)).#

A.53:  #Yeah,# w-, we probably both signed up for this in the same place
[laughter].

B.54:  Yeah.  I, I contribute every once in a while in there and yeah, I see the
messages about the, uh, #A N I.#

A.55:  #A N I,# yeah.  But, to some extent, I'm not as worried about that because,
yeah, yo-, you're getting a value for that.  You're getting to call these
people for free.

B.56:  Yeah.  I, uh, you know, the other boondoggle is this caller I D thing, you
know.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  I don't mind caller I D one bit.  Uh, if I don't want to use it or if
someone calls me that I don't know who it is, I can just not answer --

A.59:  #Yeah.#

B.60:  -- #the# phone.
