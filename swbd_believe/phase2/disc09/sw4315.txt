=======================================================================

A.1:  So, David, uh, what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of
Florida?

@B.2:  They have the, electric chair, I believe.  Remember Ted Bundy?

A.3:  Oh, that's right.  

B.4:  Couple years ago, they were all down there saying fry him [laughter].

A.5:  Oh, so the laws are still intact, then?  

B.6:  Oh, yeah, th-, yeah, they use that all the time.  Well, not all the time,
is, you know, it's, there's always backlogged.  It usually takes a guy on,
usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they
put him --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- you know, in the an-, actual electric chair.  

A.9:  And I imagine that costs a small bundle, too.  

B.10:  Yeah, he always gets all #these appeals and everything.#  

A.11:  #Go through the court process.#   

B.12:  He gets all these appeals and everything.  Uh, as far as it being a
deterrent to people, I don't think it's a d-, a deterrent.  Uh, I think it's,
I think it's more for the families more than anything --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- the families probably get some justification out of it.  But, uh, as far
as a deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that, I don't
think it really does.

A.15:  No, but I think it does serve a valuable purpose and since it, the victims
get some sort of satisfaction, the --

B.16:  The victims ((can)),

A.17:  -- community doesn't pay for the burden of having a, a prisoner in jail for
twenty years.

B.18:  That's right.  

A.19:  You know, and having --

B.20:  That's right.

A.21:  -- to supply them with a color T V and, uh, books and education, so forth.

B.22:  Right, mean what is it, how much it is a year to keep a ((prisoner, it's))
like twenty thousand a year to food and clothe a prisoner.

A.23:  #And I imagine# --

B.24:  #Some ridiculous price.#

A.25:  -- it probably costs a great deal, amount of money to, to even go through
the process of trying to electrocute someone.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  To the court processing, I mean, trying up attorney's ti-, uh, times, the
court system.

B.28:  Yeah, I don't know how many appeals Ted Bundy had.  Uh, they just keep
appealing it and appealing it to the next higher, next higher, you know, just
keeps, they keep going higher and higher up.  And, uh, you know, it does take
a long time.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  It takes money [laughter] ((for us)) to do that, so, and it's a public
defender most of the time so,

A.31:  Well, how do you feel about that?  Do you, are you in favor of capital
punishment as a,

B.32:  Yeah, yes, I am.  I am in favor of it.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  But as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime, I don't think it is.
Like I said, it's mostly for the families ((that, that)) I think, of the
victims.  Uh the, you know, the families of victims.  Do you guys have it up
there?  W-, w-, where did you say you were from?

A.35:  Yeah, I'm from New Hampshire.

B.36:  Okay, New Hampshire.  They have it up there?  

A.37:  Yeah, as far as I remember, we don't have it.  Uh, I know there hasn't been
anyone executed up here probably in about thirty, forty years, which is ironic
because we come from a very conservative state, uh, very strong on, on
punishment and crime.  Uh, it, uh, der-, one thing, we don't really have that
much crime up here.  When we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart, I
don't know if you heard about that.

B.38:  That's the schoolteacher one.  

A.39:  Right.  

B.40:  I saw the movie about that [laughter].  

A.41:  Yeah, that's a case where, uh, she's probably guilty.  I don't think
there's enough evidence there to convict her, I mean to, uh, execute her.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  I think if, because once you execute some-, the, the, the, the decision is
final.  You can't really reverse the process.  Uh,

B.44:  Well, that is the bad thing about it, and I'm, I'm sure that back in the
old days they, they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process,
but they're, but they're, uh, opinion was, well, if you got few, few innocent
people have to die to protect the majority, then that's okay, so [laughter],

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  I don't, I don't necessarily agree with that.  

A.47:  Yeah, I don't agree with that either.  I think if you kill someone who's
innocent, that's, uh,

B.48:  It screws up the whole thing in my opinion.  Yeah, I agree with you there.

A.49:  Something, you can't even live with it, if they, you really need to, you
know, case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President, uh,

B.50:  That's pretty obvious.  That's open and shut, isn't it?

A.51:  Right, and if he had succeeded, i-, i-, without a doubt, he should be e-,
executed.

B.52:  That's right.  

A.53:  Uh, whether he's insane or not.  

B.54:  That's right.  

A.55:  Same thing with Dahlmer.  I mean, he killed seventeen people.  Uh, it --

B.56:  Right.  

A.57:  -- it's a shame that we're going to have --

B.58:  Now,  

A.59:  -- to pay for,

B.60:  In his case, now, is that, that's Minnesota, right?  

A.61:  What's that?  

B.62:  Is that Minnesota?  

A.63:  I think s-, uh, Michigan.  

B.64:  Or, Wisconsin or,

A.65:  Or some,

B.66:  Maybe it's Wisc-,

A.67:  Somewhere around there.  

B.68:  Yeah, they, they might have capital punishment.  The thing with people like
that, they like to take and study him, put him in jail and do studies on him
like that, so, that's so they can try to get a profile of his personality, I
think.  You know, and, I guess in states where they don't have capital
punishment, that's the kind of stuff they do, but I think in his case, they
will put him to death because all the, all the kids, you know, all the
families and stuff aren't going to tolerate it.

A.69:  Yeah, but I thought he, he received his, uh, ((trying to remember, maybe))
what the, what the final turnout was.

B.70:  What is the final, uh, is he still going to trial for that?  

A.71:  I thought he went to re-, rehabilitation, mean, they, they were going to
put him in rehabilitation for a few years, then prison for the rest of his
life.

B.72:  That's right, because he's definitely insane.  I think they proved that he
was insane, and maybe that's, maybe that was, uh, what got him off, or made
him, uh, not get the death penalty.  Because, they can prove that he's insane,
then I, I don't think you get the death penalty.  But the, the, but, the, uh,
prosecution was trying to, uh, say that he was sane when he committed them so
they could, but they, they were going for the death penalty, I think was what
they were try to, I mean, the, they knew he did it --

A.73:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.74:  -- that he was guilty, it was just a matter of was he going to get the
death penalty or life in prison.  And I think the families wanted him to get
death [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah, I think that's a, a case where there really needs to be some change
in the laws to allow for flexibility.  I think if one person kills another
person out of,
