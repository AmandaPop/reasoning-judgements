=========================================================================

A.1:  Right, uh, actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years, I lived
in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system.  What they do is
they have, uh, three judges, basically.  And you get up there and the
prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents
their evidence and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out
and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.

B.2:  [Sneezing] Ou-, ou-, our judicial system is in such total chaos.

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow [lipsmack] take the
money out of it.  I mean, when you have a man that's signed a, a, a statement
saying he's guilty, we have a, a family called All day family.  They were all
murdered.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  All the people signed confessions, they went to a trial by jury.  They been
trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child.

A.7:  Wow.  

B.8:  And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after
Mercedes is what they've done, has nothing to do with justice whatsoever.

A.9:  [Breathing] Well, you know, it's, it's one of those things, I mean, uh, uh,
I would have to look at it.  I-, if they did it with the, uh, just the judges,
the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is
airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they
know all the procedures, they know what's good and what isn't, they'd be able
to say, I'm sorry, you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it
was either illegally obtained or whatever and, you know, you wouldn't have
this, uh, uh, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the, to
the jury and then the judge says, oh, no, d-, disregard that.  Come on, any
juries not going to disregard the evidence, you know [laughter].

B.10:  Uh, that's true.  I, I, I think our judicial system is attorney welfare
myself.

A.11:  That may very well be.  

B.12:  I, I hold it in the utmost contempt.

A.13:  Uh,

B.14:  The, uh, d-, my favorite is the police department, [breathing] they're not
aimed at the criminal.  The judicial system is aimed at the citizens because
you and I, we have work schedules, we can be called at work, we have Social
Security numbers, they can trace us down, we have telephones, then we have
checkbooks.  Criminals have none of these things.  They're real difficult to
catch, and if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it,
whereas us, we write a check.

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  So where do you think they target their efforts?  

A.17:  That's true.  ((You d-)),

B.18:  They target their efforts toward the citizens -- 

A.19:  Well,   

B.20:  -- not the criminals.  

A.21:  How would you go about changing it?  

B.22:  [Throat_clearing] You know, that's a, I've nailed the problem down but I,

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  [Laughter]. 

A.25:  Leave the details up to somebody else, huh.  

B.26:  Yeah, I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do
about, I think, to begin with, you would h-, you would have, like, here in
Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical, yet, you go out on the
streets and they're giving speeding tickets.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,

A.29:  Well, you know, uh, talking about the lawyers, you know what might very
well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like
that, is to set the fees for cases.  It's kind of like do it, do it in the
similar vein similar, like, uh, V C R or television repair.  If you take your
T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, well, I'll repair your T V
for a hundred dollars, and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and
finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he
eats it.  He, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred
dollars.  Now, if he comes in and says, you know, I'll repair your, your V C
R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's
a blown fuse, takes him two minutes, he fixes it, he still charges you that
hundred dollars.  So, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you
know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing
somebody else, you get X dollars for that case and that's it.

B.30:  Now,   

A.31:  None of this,

B.32:  I firmly believe in that because when you get the most heinous of crimes,
have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney?

A.33:  Oh, yeah.  

B.34:  And here's this bum that didn't have a job -- 

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford. 

A.37:  That's true.  

B.38:  Who's --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- paying for that?  

A.41:  Um, y-, well, you, you know, [laughter] you're talking to part of them
that's paying for that [laughter].

B.42:  [Laughter] Yeah, and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
[laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter] That's right.  You know that's, it, it's, it's amazing and, and
when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, th-, they're all former
lawyers.

B.44:  Yeah, well, that's another problem.  I think to really correct the judicial
system, you have to get the lawyers out of it [laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  I mean, they're, they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics
whatsoever, and with that type person running it, I mean, you, you could
expect that you,
