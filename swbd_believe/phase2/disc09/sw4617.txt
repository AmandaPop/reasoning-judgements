REMARKS:        Child talking through out B's conversation.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  I say they, uh, probably the best things to do is, is tie them with a rope
and throw them in the water # ((if they sink)) [laughter]# --

A.3:  #I see.  A# --

B.4:  -- they're innocent right.

A.5:  -- a good, a good southern solution.

B.6:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Uh, so, uh, how do you, how do you feel?  Th-, that's, of
course, being facetious but [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh.  You'd have to say that.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Uh, I don't know.  The, the things they asked to talk about were whether
the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that does the, uh, sentencing.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And seems to me that that's, I think that's the way it's done now.  Uh, at
least,

B.12:  [Child_talking].

A.13:  my understanding of the law which isn't very good.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it and I, I think that's probably
all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is --

B.16:  [Child] Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- for a particular thing.

B.18:  And, I guess, also what the system will absorb [child_talking].

A.19:  #Right.#

B.20:  #Probably# more tuned in to that.  Possibly though on, uh, capital cases
like maybe the death penalty --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the
sole, I mean he could have like a personal prejudice.  You know, judges are
people like #everybody else# --

A.23:  #That's right.#

B.24:  -- even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial but #maybe, 
uh,# 

A.25:  #And I# think that may, I, that may be an exception as well.  Because I
think that, doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than, than
#the judge?#

B.26:  #I, I think# that's, I think that's the way it is.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, [child_talking] the
accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty.  Do they have a
death penalty in California?  [child_talking].

A.29:  Yes.  #In# --

B.30:  #Yeah.#

A.31:  -- fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And, uh, there's a big uproar going on right now.  #Uh# --

B.34:  #Yeah.#  [child_talking].

A.35:  -- the, uh, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's
going to commute it or not.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  You know, it's someone who had, uh, 

B.38:  [Child_talking].

A.39:  killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.

B.40:  Yeah.  I, something like that, I've got no problem with [inhaling] it.
#Uh# --

A.41:  #Yeah.#

B.42:  -- I guess the way I think about it is [child_talking] not, it shouldn't
necessarily be thought of as revenge.  It's just like if you've got like a dog
that's running wild and biting people --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- put it to sleep, you know.  Just get it out, you know, it's not able to
fit in, you know [child_talking].

A.45:  Something inexpensive.

B.46:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly [child_talking].  Uh, I guess, 

A.47:  [Noise].

B.48:  kind of the way I think about it also, is they just, if somebody gets the
death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty, they got the death penalty,
they should have one year and one appeal.  Cover all their bases with one
appeal and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row
for, you know, [laughter] fifteen years.

A.49:  Yeah.  I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah, that,#

A.51:  #But I guess# there have been several cases where people have been executed
by mistake and --

B.52:  Yeah.  Oh, #I'm sure [/child_talking].#

A.53:  -- #you'd hate# to be one of those.  

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be
required to be unanimous.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Which, again, I think is the way it is now.  That all the, all verdicts,
well maybe not.  I don't know.  At least in capital cases I'd think they'd
have to be --

B.58:  I believe #it is# --

A.59:  -- #unanimous.#

B.60:  -- in capital.  I think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of
twelve or five out of six, whatever [child].

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  How ever many is on, sitting on a jury.  I t-, I believe that's the way it
is.  But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases.  Uh [child],

A.63:  Yeah.  The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. 

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other
eleven.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  And, uh, [talking] [noise] they've only deliberated four hours or,

B.68:  [Child_talking].

A.69:  something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.

B.70:  Oh, no [laughter].

A.71:  ((And)) the judge told them #[laughter],# 

B.72:  #[Laughter].#

A.73:  they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet [laughter].  

B.74:  [Laughter] [child_talking] I'm telling you, go one way or the other.  That,
that's probably an expensive trial.  #((Uh)),# 

A.75:  #Yeah.#  Six months so far they said.

B.76:  Yeah.  #Probably.#

A.77:  #So.#

B.78:  Yeah.  Probably.  You know, I'm not sure there's a number.  It's probably
like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day [child_talking] you know, worth of
all the free for all.

A.79:  Maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people
#dial in and give their, uh, vote.#

B.80:  #[Laughter] Yeah [laughter].# Yeah, that's, that's been so long I've prac-,
practically forgot who Noriega was, #you know.#

A.81:  #Right.#

B.82:  [Laughter] That has been going on [talking].  My, uh, cousin is a F B I
agent down in Miami.

A.83:  Oh really?

B.84:  Yeah.  So she [laughter] follows that stuff pretty closely.  #But, uh,# 

A.85:  #That's interesting.#

B.86:  [Talking] Yeah, she's not involved in that, that case.  But she does,

A.87:  Well have you ever served on a jury?

B.88:  No I haven't.  I never have.  My wife has but I, #I haven't.#

A.89:  #Uh-huh.# I got called but I, uh, never, uh, got selected for a jury
[static],

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  I [cough] {in background} sat for tw-, ten days --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- in a court room while they went through the selection process,

B.94:  [Child_talking].

A.95:  and they had some guy that was, uh, defending himself.

B.96:  Uh-huh.
