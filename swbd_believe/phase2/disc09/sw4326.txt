A.1:  ((How)) do you feel about the much of, uh, random or spot drug testing?

@B.2:  Well, I'm, I'm for it based upon my experience, uh, in taking, uh, drug
tests.  My, uh, my past experience in the military plus, uh, my current
occupation working, uh, for a defense contractor here in Massachusetts.  Uh, I
feel that it's, uh, there is some opinions whereas the, uh, people of the mind
that, uh, it's a right to privacy, that, you know, it's a, it's a bodily
function involved and that, uh, uh, people should have a right to protect
themselves and so forth, but I don't agree.  I think that, uh, it's important,
particularly for some jobs and some jog, job occupations that, uh, people can
be screened for, uh, should be screened for, uh, for drugs through your drug
testing.

A.3:  I, I tend to believe that, that it's, it's important for those jobs where,
uh, where the, the person has the safety of other people, uh, in their own
hands or within their control, then I think it should be mandatory.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  You know, the, the airline industry, the transportation industry.

B.6:  Right.  

A.7:  Uh, you know, the d-, defense and military, you know, any, any application
like that, I think it should be mandatory.

B.8:  Yeah, so I think we're in agreement that, that, uh, uh, that it's a good,
uh, it's a good idea in some circumstances.

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  The one reservation I have, though, in that, from my exper-, and I've taken
many urinal-, many drug tests.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Some of them random, some of them, uh, scheduled.  And every time you take
one of those tests, [laughter] you know, when you're submitting a sample --

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  -- there's always in the back of your mind, well, how are, you know, people
conducting the test, the labs that are performing the test, how adequate, uh,
are those facilities and --

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  -- uh, is, is always, is it always a chance, I know that what they call,
uh, the, I think it's called the chain of custody of the, uh, the specimens
themselves.  I know in the --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- in the military particularly, they, there's a, they, they go to great
lengths at protecting the samples before they get to the labs.

A.19:  Right.  

B.20:  But, my concern is, and I think that, that, that, what needs to be further
investigated is the, uh, the standardization and to have some hundred percent
insurance that the test that's given, uh, the, the, the lab that performs the,
uh, the analysis is, uh, validated in some way, you know --

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- some standardization, because I've heard some horror stories, you know.

A.23:  Yeah, y-, y-, you know,

B.24:  [Throat_clearing].

A.25:  you can easily envision the one, one mistake could, you know, ruin a, a
career that couldn't be, uh, you know, couldn't be resurrected.

B.26:  SIXTY MINUTES did an article on this whole subj-, subject a few, uh, a few
years ago, and there was a Air Force Captain [inhaling] who, uh, you know,
took the test [breathing] and it came up positive [throat_clearing], and the
guy swore on a stack of BIBLES.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Now, in the military, for, for a staff, staff N C O, which is a, a non
commissioned officer, but it's a certain rank, I don't know if you're familiar
with m-, military rank structure.

A.29:  No.  

B.30:  It's a, it's a high-level of enlisted personnel and officers.  For those
people who show up positive on one drug test, they're immediately discharged.

A.31:  [Laughter]. 

B.32:  Now, for certain ranks and below, like sergeant and below -- 

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  -- if you're found positive or come up dirty in a d-, on a, on a drug test,
you can be reduced in rank, forfeit your pay --

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- or if it's a repeat, repeat, of-, uh, offense [throat_clearing], then
they ((get)) discharge.  But there's this ar-, this, this Air Force captain,
he swore up and down that he didn't do anything.

A.37:  Right.  

B.38:  [Throat_clearing] And they went back and, you know, few months later to try
to investigate the lab --

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  -- and the sample that he had given was destroyed.  

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  So,

A.43:  Huh.  

B.44:  I, I think you got to be careful with stuff like that.

A.45:  Yeah, definitely.  

B.46:  That's, that's my only concern about the whole issue, I think.

A.47:  Yeah, I don't really feel like, you know, for the, any of the just routine
jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  Uh, only for the [ringing], only for the ones where it's critical.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  Uh, yeah, because there's a big thing in the, in the, here on the
east coast,

A.51:  [Ringing]. 

B.52:  the Boston Police Department, uh, the Policemen's Association took the,

A.53:  [Ringing]. 

B.54:  uh, the Boston Police Department to court because they were, uh, trying to
institute drug tests --

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  -- on the cops here in Boston.  

A.57:  [Ringing] Right.  

B.58:  And, uh, they won, the Police Dep-, the, the Police Association won
[throat_clearing], and it, it was a right to privacy type deal that they
approached it, and the courts agreed.

A.59:  Now, I, I guess I would feel that the, you know, police, uh, that the
police should be one of those public, uh, safety issues where --

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  -- you know, [laughter] mandatory d-, -- 

B.62:  Oh, yeah.  

A.63:  -- drug testing, where it would be favorable.  

B.64:  Definitely.  

A.65:  Uh,   

B.66:  Well, you know, the thing is, is in all these transportation accidents,
