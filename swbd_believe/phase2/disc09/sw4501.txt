===========================================================================

A.1:  Let's see.  I kn-, I can guess.  I know what the rules are in Washington D
C.

B.2:  [TV] [laughter] No handguns are permitted in D C at all.

@A.3:  But, on the other hand, in, in, uh, Virginia.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  It's supposed to be close to wide-open.  Right?

B.6:  Uh, sort of.  Yeah.  I live in Virginia.  I don't, I work in D C
[sniffing].

A.7:  So, I'm, uh, and I'm, well I'll give you a clue.  I've, if, if guns caused
crime, there'd be a lot of crime in Virginia and not much in D C #[laughter]
but# --

B.8:  #[Laughter]# So how does that rate you in the, uh, the scale that they've
given us.

A.9:  -- on a scale, I guess I'm about a nine and a half [breathing].  

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  So I've, let's see, ten means what?  Ten means no controls and one means,
#uh?#

B.12:  #One# means total restriction.

A.13:  One means total restrictions.  I guess I'm, I'm about, uh, yeah I've, I'm
between --

B.14:  Nine and a half [laughter].

A.15:  -- nine and a half and ten.  I'm, I'm not saying no control but, uh,

B.16:  [Squeak] {sounds like he is twisting the phone receiver} [laughter]
[sniffing] Are you an N R A member?

A.17:  [Laughter] #Yes, I,#

B.18:  #[Laughter].#

A.19:  have been since, uh,

B.20:  [Squeak] [sniffing].

A.21:  you know, it's one of those things where they say, uh, you're biased.
You're, uh, you're --

B.22:  Right, this is a rather a int-, 

A.23:  -- a member and so then the question comes up, uh, well, if you really
believed in it, why wouldn't you be a member.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  But, anyway --

B.26:  Huh.

A.27:  -- I, uh, [lipsmack] let's see [sigh].  Okay now, so y-, tell me where you
are #in the sc-,#

B.28:  #I, I,# I fall smack dab in the middle [laughter] [sniffing].

A.29:  You're about a five you think?

B.30:  Uh, yeah, #uh.#

A.31:  #Sometimes# it's right and sometimes it's wrong huh. 

B.32:  [Squeak] Exactly.  I mean I'm originally from New York [laughter] so.

A.33:  Well it's, I know it can be, uh, it can be kind of scary.  The idea of just
everybody wandering around with, uh, uh, you know, absolute no limits or
anything like that.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  On the other hand, the truth is that all the bad guys let me put this way.
All the guys that aren't scared have, already have them.

B.36:  Already have them or can get them if they want them [sniffing].  

A.37:  And, uh, and, uh, uh, when John Lennon got, uh, nailed --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- shot [laughter] I should say.

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  Uh, one of the, some, some of my friends were saying, you know, that's
another argument for gun control.  I said, oh yeah, he should have lived in,
in, uh, he should [breathing] have lived in, in, uh, Ireland,

B.42:  [Sniffing].

A.43:  where they have a total ban [laughter].  #You know, in northern Ireland.#

B.44:  #[Squeak] Well I mean the same thing went.#

A.45:  Yeah.  #Tha-,#

B.46:  #E-,# everyone uses England as an example.  Saying, oh well, you know, th-,
there, no one has guns in England and look at the crime rate there.  It's so
much lower.

A.47:  But --

B.48:  But [popping].

A.49:  -- the reason when I say, I was really (( )) about northern Ireland, you
know.

B.50:  [Squeak].

A.51:  Because in northern Ireland there is a lot of crime and it's totally
#banned.#

B.52:  #Right,# right.

A.53:  And, uh, the, [phone_ringing] the, uh, [sigh] how do I say this, the, uh,
the thing that I have noticed,

B.54:  [Squeak].

A.55:  with, uh, this topic is that, that, I know some very intelligent people.
And I, I say well here's a little brochure.  Why don't you read this and see
what it says.  I don't want to read that.  Okay [inhaling].  #And, uh# --

B.56:  #Uh-huh.#

A.57:  -- where as I'm the other way.  I'll read, I can read about, when I say I'm
the other way that's not to say I'm open minded, uh, as much as I think I am.

B.58:  [Squeak] [laughter].

A.59:  But I'll read anything [laughter],

B.60:  [Noise] {sounds like something dropped}.

A.61:  and, uh, try and pick it apart.  So, uh, let's see.  What was the other
thing I was going to say.  Uh [lipsmack],

B.62:  [Noise]. 

A.63:  now my earlier statement about if, 

B.64:  [Noise]. 

A.65:  if they caused crime then, Virginia should have a lot of them.  Should have
a lot of crime.  Uh, I do-, that, that kind of reflects my, my feeling about
it.  Because you notice the states,

B.66:  [Clinking].

A.67:  where they claim all of these things are coming from, they don't have a
very high crime rate.

B.68:  Right.  

A.69:  And,

B.70:  Well, I mean, look at D C.  I mean, you're talking [clicking], 

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  you're talking about a district where handguns are illegal to be have, to
have at all and it's also the murder capital of the country [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah.  Well, th-, the, 

B.74:  [Sniffing].

A.75:  the thing that I see, is it's not the availability because availability is,
you know, cocaine is, is outlawed too but --

B.76:  Right, exactly.

A.77:  -- but it's the, uh, the nature.  And, and my feeling, if you go back to
England.  Uh, England is one of those places where they have relatively low
rates but also the rates of other crimes are lower.

B.78:  Right.  #((Crime)),#

A.79:  #And# the other thing that happens is they also have the ability to stop
you and say, uh, Mister you look like a pickpocket.  Would you please empty
your pockets.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  And if you try that here in the States, I mean you could unload four pounds
of dynamite and, uh, you'd walk because they, #they're not allowed to search
you.#

B.82:  #They're not allowed to do that.#  Right.

A.83:  So it's, it's kind of like, uh, dandelions.  I don't know if you have any,
do you own a house?

B.84:  Uh, no.

A.85:  Well, anyway, if you had a lawn.

B.86:  [Snorting] W-, okay.

A.87:  #If you, if you've ever had a lawn.#

B.88:  #I get the point.#  Yes, I've had a lawn before [laughter].

A.89:  If you've ever had a lawn, uh, 

B.90:  [Sniffing].

A.91:  and somebody says, uh, wait till the place is full of dandelions and then
go try and, and pull the heads off as fast as you can.  You'd be pulling heads
off all day, #you know# --

B.92:  #Right.#

A.93:  -- of dandelions.  And, whereas in England where they co-, come up to a kid
and they say, uh, you look like you've got a problem.  And he says, I don-, no
I don't.  And then they say well, uh, let's go, they can even go to your
apartment and, uh, force you to open your apartment.  Anything they find in
there is used as evidence so --

B.94:  Right [/TV].

A.95:  -- the result is that, uh,
