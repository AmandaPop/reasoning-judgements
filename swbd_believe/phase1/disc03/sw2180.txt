=========================================================================

A.1:  Here we go.

B.2:  Okay, um, have you ever been involved in any trials?

A.3:  I sure was.  Two years ago I spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day on a
jury that was, uh, a change of venue from Columbus, Ohio for aggravated, uh,
murder and kidnapping.

B.4:  Wow.   

A.5:  Yeah, it was quite a session that distrup-, disrupted my whole summer, of
course,

B.6:  Sounds like it.   

A.7:  five days a week, but it was an absolutely fascinating experience.

B.8:  Oh, it sounds like it.  I haven't had any actual real life experience but,
uh, my father-in-law's been involved in, uh, several trials including, uh, a
couple murders.  And, uh, you know, talking to other people who have been
there and so I don't have any real experience with trials but I do, you know,
I, I've, I took a little business law in, in college and, and I've, you know,
try to keep abreast of things.

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  But, uh, m-, I think that the, uh, trial by jury is, is a great idea at
it's inception back two hundred years ago.  Um, right now though it's, it's so
difficult because there's so few courts to, to get anything really done as you
know you spent, you know, a whole summer on one trial,

A.11:  Uh-huh.   

B.12:  and it's just that I think they're just tieing up the, um, whole judicial
process.  Um, there's a lot of things they could do to, uh, make things easier
and, uh, you know, like, uh, the suggestion that, uh, maybe be, uh, a judge
should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the
jury.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think that there are many cases where, uh, the judges
probably do make the decision rather than the jury.  Our situation was
somewhat different, uh, in view of the fact that, uh, we haven't, we were a
landmark case, it was the first time in the state of Ohio that, um, D N A
testing was entered as evidence.

B.14:  Uh-huh.    

A.15:  And they were being, the judge was being especially careful that everything
was done correctly so there couldn't be a, a mistrial of any kind.

B.16:   Uh-huh.   

A.17:  Uh, the, um, uh, the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury
process, uh, that we experienced.  That took one full week, uh, to get
forty-three people qualified to sit on the jury.  And then it was a matter of
the selection of, uh, twelve people after that.  Actually it was fourteen
because we had two alternates.

B.18:  Jeez.   

A.19:  And the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare, if we were well, if
we were comfortable, and, uh, things of that nature which made us feel good.

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  Uh, and we were sequestered but the makeup of the jury, uh, was truly a
cross section of, uh, you might say a cross section of a country.

B.22:  Uh-huh.   

A.23:  There was one other person besides myself, we were the only ones that had
ever been to college.  Um, one was a former student of mine a few years before
who was out of work.  Uh,

B.24:  Gee.   

A.25:  two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out
looking for jobs, yet.  Um, a couple of them were housewives who had never
worked, and then some are people who did work.  So, we had quite a cross
section of black, white and women and men.

B.26:  Uh-huh.    

A.27:  And, uh, it, uh, it was interesting just to listen to the rationale, uh,
being proposed and the logic of some of the people, uh, it was also extremely
difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses, and we
were not allowed to take any notes of any kind.  Uh, and I thought that that
was a failing because, uh, from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to
remember everything,

B.28:  Yeah.   

A.29:  and, and yet the judge said, well, um, if you're taking notes you're
missing something, and he was right,

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  there also.  But, uh, I certainly, um, I think it depends upon how the
judge handles the case, and if the criminal chooses to have a three panel
judge, uh, a three judge panel I should say, I think he can,

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  have that rather than trial by jury.   

B.34:  Yes, yes I agree.  Uh, would surprise me that, uh, when I was in Texas I
had the, uh, displeasure of getting a, uh, traffic ticket.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  And, um, I went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic
ticket.

A.37:  You're kidding.   

B.38:  No.  And I thought, my God talk about tieing up things for, for,

A.39:  Yes, and money.   

B.40:  Yes, I mean that's extremely expensive.  I mean, the first thing you had to
do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial.  I'm
like ((God)),

A.41:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

B.42:  this is ridiculous [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah, I do think that, that, uh, I do think the jury system works but I'd,
I also feel, as you said, that the original concept of the jury as it was
originally setup, uh, back, uh, in a hundred years ago was fine but that it
needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the, the, uh,
level of education of them, of so many people now, uh,

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  by the same token we had, um, uh, some people who wanted t-, had
vacations planned and one man in particular had reservations made, plane
tickets made, everything, and the judge called and had it all canceled so he
could get his money back and then he wasn't selected on the jury.

B.46:  Oh, my God.

A.47:  And then another young fellow had to meet with the judge o-, and the
prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he
was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins.
And they had, he had to go through all of that ((if)) in three days to get
excused from that jury, to be with his wife on the birth of the twins.  And,
uh, you know, some of it just seemed rather extreme.

B.48:  Yes.  I, I think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that,
uh, you know, people would get a fair trial,

A.49:  Yes. 

B.50:  and not have to go through this process.

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  I mean, some things are just so cut and dry.  Um, in the, in, you know,
the, the level of evidence that they come up with now, I mean, you know, when
you start thinking about well, they've got video tape and, and audio tapes and
they've, they've got, you know, they've got ways to nail people [laughter],

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  to the point where they, they really shouldn't even be going to trial.

A.55:  Right, well, I guess ((he'd)) have to be careful whether, with entrapment
or some of those things,
B.56:  Yes.

A.57:  but, uh, I don't, I assume you have seen on television recently, as
probably the whole country has, the beating of the man in Los Angeles.

B.58:  Oh, that was horrible.   

A.59:  Isn't that terrible?  And, uh, you know,  

B.60:  That ((it)),

A.61:  and that certainly, uh, cannot be said to be, uh, something that happens
everywhere, but the fact that it can happen, that it probably does happen in
many places, it's, it's horrendous and it's just a stroke of luck,

B.62:  Yeah.   

A.63:  that someone was able to get it on tape and then, uh, to listen to the
tape recording, uh, at the police station of the whole conversation
afterwards.

B.64:  Yes, I know.  I mean, I only heard portions of that but it's absolutely,

A.65:  Yeah.   

B.66:  terrible.  And, you know, if you beat a dog like that, they'll put you,

A.67:  Absolutely.   

B.68:  in jail, 

A.69:  Well, we get a few other case,   

B.70:  you know. 

A.71:  uh, like ((up at)) the end of last year where one police officer, it was
on a drug raid, uh, was trying to extra, extricate, um, a confession or
information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot, a hot iron on his
chest, his bare chest, burned him.

B.72:  Jeez.   

A.73:  They wound up paying him, uh, the officer, of course, was fired, but they
paid the defendant, uh, three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop
the lawsuit, and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman.

B.74:  Huh.   

A.75:  So, uh, ((as)) some of those things, uh, are absolutely horrendous and we
do need an all-, an overhaul and we just need more discipline country wide.

B.76:  Yes, I,  

A.77:  ((It would)), then we'd need it on that, yeah.

B.78:  I believe that too.   

@@A.79:  Well, it's been very nice talking with you.   

B.80:  Well, it's been nice talking with you.   

A.81:  Yes, and, uh, good luck on, on (( )) calls.   

B.82:  Okay, thank you, you do the same. 

A.83:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye.    

B.84:  Bye-bye.
