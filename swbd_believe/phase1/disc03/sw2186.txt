============================================================================

B.1:  Okay, so I guess, um, I, start with maybe, if, if, does, do you know if the
population favors statehood, or where we, we're supposed to, whether we favor
it?

A.2:  I'm not, I'm not sure what, what the people of Puerto Rico feel?  Uh, how
do you feel about, uh, the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state.

B.3:  Well, see I have mixed feelings because, um, it, it, with the financial
situation, I don't really quite understand what would happen there, if they
would be a burden to us, or if they already are a burden.  So I, I really, 
(( )), uh, I really don't care, you know, I mean.

A.4:  Yeah.  I question whether it in their best interests to become a state.
Right now they are a commonwealth, and that means that they are under U S
protection in the event of, uh, defending their, their country.  Uh, they do
not have any voting privileges, though, and I don't believe they have any
representation in Congress.

B.5:  Yes, I think that's true.  So if that makes them feel definitely like
outsiders, but like, getting back to the, their government benefits, they,
they do have a lot of, uh, tax benefits?

A.6:  Yeah, I don't believe they have to pay any, uh, like federal tax.

B.7:  Yeah, so, um, also of course, they, they can, they join the, they can
always join the military service.  They are considered citizens, I believe.

A.8:  Uh, yeah, I think they are.

B.9:  Yeah, they can,

A.10:  They, they do get, uh, priv-, privileges like that.  But I'm not sure how
much that, uh, carries on.

B.11:  Yeah, that's a strange situation, you're a citizen, yet you can't vote.

A.12:  Yeah [laughter].

B.13:  So, if,

A.14:  I think they've got, uh, like a language barrier, too.  I think most of the
people there speak only Spanish.  I'm not sure how fluent they are in English,
and that's one of the major problems I, I see with, uh, other countries, as
such, being, uh, say, the possibility of becoming states.  That we don't have
a common language with them.

B.15:  Yes, I went, I worked, um, I went there for a class in a factory, and some
of the people in my class couldn't speak fluent English.  They had a very
difficult time with it, and they, they couldn't, the ones that could speak,
speak it had a really hard time reading it.  So.

A.16:  Right.  I think we'd have the same type of problem say with Mexico.  Uh,
Canada, on the other hand, uh, English is one of their national languages.

B.17:  Yes, as well as the, the, um, the Quebec people that, that speak French.

A.18:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.19:  And they're s-, [laughter],  

A.20:  So, I think they're.

B.21:  they're supposed to be bilingual.

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  But, um.

A.24:  I just see a lot of, uh, social and cultural differences that could, uh,
pose problems with, uh, Puerto Rico becoming a state.

B.25:  Yes, what do you, what do you, um, do, do you think they should become
independent, maybe,

A.26:  Um.

B.27:  or do you think they should (( )).

A.28:  I don't think they're strong enough, myself, to become independent.  Uh, I
think that it's in their best interest right now just, uh, to remain as is,
keep the status quo, and, uh, keep, uh, stay under the U-, United States
protection.

B.29:  Yeah, I think if I was the middle class Puerto Rican, maybe that, that
would be the, um, stablest thing to do.

A.30:  Yeah, because I think that if they, if they tried for independence, they
would,

B.31:  They would,

A.32:  probably have, uh, military factions that oppose each other, and, and
they would vie for leadership, and, uh, the people who are well off there, the
middle upper class, if there is such a thing, uh, they would probably be at a
disadvantage --

B.33:  Yes.

A.34:  -- losing, possibility of losing their, uh, their assets or wealth.

B.35:  So they've been talking about this for a long time.  Do you think they're
going to ever vote --

A.36:  Uh.

B.37:  -- whether they want one, one of the three choices?

A.38:  I don't see it in the near future.

B.39:  I know, because I think I've been rea-, I read this ten years ago, that
they were having these big, uh, um rallies, and people would be in the streets
flashing signs, statehood, yes, and other people were down with statehood.
It's, it, down there, if, um, if you're familiar with their politics, they,
uh, it's very, I don't know, it's called (( )), or they have loudspeakers on
their cars, and they run down the neighborhood, saying vote for, you know,
Pierre, he's, or, uh, P-, uh, Pedro, he's the best,

A.40:  [Laughter].

B.41:  it's really kind of comical.

A.42:  Yeah, I've never been there.  I'm not quite familiar with, with, uh, the
way they do things.

B.43:  Yeah, these, these people have these big loudspeakers, because they have,
uh, democratic system, just like ours, where they elect their mayors, and
their councilmen.  It's really kind of funny, it's it's kind of an invasion of
your privacy, too (( )),

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  going down these streets with these really loud speakers.

A.46:  Yeah, oh, I think that, you know, part of the biggest problem there is that
they still really are third world country.  And they haven't, uh, caught up,
uh, economically, with, uh, say, the United States.

B.47:  Yeah, there, there's some really poor areas, where, when I went, uh, it, it
looked like it was (( )).  You couldn't, if you didn't know the area, they,
they didn't advise you to go out and, uh, you know, go in the, the, uh, poorer
sections of town.  But the, the big cities where the big hotels were, that
was, that was safe ground to walk around, but, uh, particularly in San Juan --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- we wanted to go walk on the beach at night, and they looked at us like
we were crazy.  Says, no, you can't go at night, because, uh, we were, we, our
business was on the other side of the island.  We were only in San Juan, it
was at night.

A.50:  Okay.

B.51:  They didn't want us to go out on the beach, you know, said it was very
dangerous.

A.52:  Well, did you have guides from the area, or escorts or, uh,

B.53:  Um, actually we, um, met some people that were in the naval base down
there.

A.54:  Okay.

B.55:  And, uh, they didn't particularly like living down there, because it was
very foreign, very different.  The, the people, they, they didn't treat them
nice.

A.56:  Okay.

B.57:  You know, um, so, I think there, I, what I learned from them there was a
lot of resentment towards the Americans, so, and it was, like they were Puerto
Rican, and were Americans.

A.58:  Right.

B.59:  So that's why they're so, um, emotional about, about statehood, yet, like
you say, they can't really support themselves.  So.

A.60:  Yeah, they've got that Latin blood, they get fired up about every little,

B.61:  Yes, yes.

A.62:  thing anyway.

B.63:  It's very true.

A.64:  I think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of
attaining a fifty-first state is what would we do about our flag.  How do you
arrange fifty-one stars?  [laughter].

B.65:  [Laughter].

A.66:  What kind of pattern does, do we come up with for that?

B.67:  I don't know.  That, that's a good one [laughter].

A.68:  Good contest [laughter].

B.69:  Yeah, but the thing, the thing that bothers me about it the most is they
don't make decisions, they don't vote.  I, I think if they voted, that, as you
say, the, um, they, they would probably stay commonwealth, or that would be
the best for them.

A.70:  Well, that would give them, them more of an interest in what goes on in
this country, if, if they had, uh, a, uh, a privilege of voting, uh, that
would give them a vested interest in the government, and, uh, I would see that
as, as a positive, uh, thing for them to consider.

B.71:  Yeah, but as you say, it's two diff-, two different cultures.  I don't, I
don't know.  Um, so you, like I said, I was reading this ten years ago.
Whether they coul-, they're going to be talking about this in another ten
years.

A.72:  Probably.

B.73:  I don't see them doing anything.

A.74:  Uh, yeah, I really don't see any change in the near future.

B.75:  So, I don't know.  [music] And it's also a long way away [laughter].

A.76:  [Laughter].

B.77:  You know, if it was Cuba,

A.78:  Well, Cuba's closer but, uh,

B.79:  Yes, Cuba's very close.  But, uh, particularly, it's like, uh, I live in
Vermont.  From Vermont to Florida, it's another, another, uh, what fourteen
hundred miles across the ocean.

A.80:  Right.  That is a good distance.

B.81:  Yeah, they have to import a lot of their, um, cereals, and things, and I
don't understand that when they don't have a processing.  I guess, it, they,
it's just as easy to bring the cereal in boxes as it is to bring it in in, you
know, bulk grain, and produce it there.

A.82:  What is their major industry?

B.83:  Uh, I really don't know, um,

A.84:  Is it, uh, I, I believe, is it sugar cane, or, I'm not t-, sure exactly
what they do.

B.85:  It could be.  I'm sure they rely heavily on tourism, and even all the
American companies down there, with their, uh, electronics industries, and
pharmaceuticals are big down there.

A.86:  Right, okay.

B.87:  That's one thing that I did notice, pharmaceuticals, electronics tha-,
makes up, I mean, enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business.
But, um, I really don't know.  Agriculturally, they could have so much, and
they, and they don't.  They don't seem to, uh, I don't know if I heard they
don't feed themselves or not.  I don't think they support themselves,
agriculturally.  I found that to be really odd.

A.88:  Yeah, I'm not very familiar with, with the state of their agriculture.

B.89:  You know, I can see they can't grow the grains, I mean, they're, if they, I
guess, their grains don't do well in the tropics.  So like you say, grow sugar
beets and sugar cane.

A.90:  Right, you have to question,

B.91:  And that's all export.

A.92:  You have to wonder how much tillable land they have, uh, being an island.

B.93:  Well, yeah, that is, it's mountainous --

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  -- and, uh, but it, it looks fertile and it, it, um, I mean it rains
enough, they have the climate and the rain, and if not, it's like, I've been
to St. Thomas, and it just starts from the ocean up.

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  And, and it's very, it's like one big rock.  

A.98:  Right.

B.99:  But, uh, Puerto Rico has lots of, uh, lots of, uh, mountainous region and
coastal region.

A.100:  Yeah.  I think it must have a lot of tourism, too, but I don't see as much
advertising there as you do in the Baha-, say the Bahamas.

B.101:  Yeah.  I don't know, uh, i-,

A.102:  But, uh, say, St. Thomas, uh, the Virgin Islands, uh, places like that.

B.103:  That's very true.  I don't know if they just take it for granted that they,
you know, it's an American commonwealth, they really don't have to advertise
that much.  But that is an interesting point.  But I believe it's a very
popular vacation destination.

A.104:  Right.  Well the Virgin Islands are an American territory.

B.105:  Yep.

A.106:  And but you see a lot of advertising for that, uh, as far a vacation
cruises and ...
