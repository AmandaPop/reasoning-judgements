===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Art, you say you own a T I, or, you own a, uh, an I B M compatible?

B.2:  Uh, yeah, I have one of these little Zenith laptops which, uh, the, uh,
everybody here at school has to buy one.

A.3:  Uh-huh.   

B.4:  And,

A.5:  Oh, you're in school?  

B.6:  Oh, yeah.  I'm a student, uh, at, at Harvard Business School.

A.7:  Uh-huh.   

B.8:  And, uh, tremendously useful thing.  It's, uh, the, the, portability and
the compactness of it are, uh, pretty nice.  It's, uh, you know, enough that
you can kind of throw it in a briefcase or, uh, slap it over your shoulder and
carry it around.

A.9:  Wha-, what do you use to, to download into the system.  Can you p-, hook up
a, a floppy to it?

B.10:  Uh, it's got an internal three and a half inch floppy.   

A.11:  Oh, it's built in.   

B.12:  Yeah, and, uh, it also has a forty megabyte hard drive built in.

A.13:  Oh, that's pretty good.  Uh,

B.14:  And, uh, you know, the batteries carry it for at least four or five hours.

A.15:  Um.   

B.16:  And so, you know, I use it, uh, both in school to do, uh, spreadsheet
analysis for various, uh, businesses that we're studying and also, uh, you
know, it hooks up to normal printers,

A.17:  Uh-huh.   

B.18:  and what have you, and, uh, works pretty well in that mode as well.  I, I'm
curious what you'd use your, uh, your home computer for.

A.19:  Uh [throat_clearing], I do, I do, uh, word processing on it primarily.

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  Uh, the main reason why I'm, I'm hanging on to it is because of the
business that I'm in --

B.22:  Uh-huh.   

A.23:  -- the, the home computer business.  I have a, a store in my house where
I've got the, uh, the hardware and the software, and I also do repair work on
the system.  If, if I started using a different computer at home, then I
wouldn't be using the, the software and the hardware and it would be that much
more difficult for me to try and market it, the, the product.

B.24:  Does it, does it cause a problem for you to use a different computer at
work than you use at home?

A.25:  Uh, oddly enough, no, uh, because I do different things with it.  At home,

B.26:  Uh-huh.   

A.27:  I, I do mostly play and at work I do mostly work.  Uh, it's [laughter] you
know, you, you, you can put a game on an I B M compatible computer, uh, but,
uh --

B.28:  Yeah.   

A.29:  -- you know, I, I don't normally do that at, at work.  Uh, and I, I
typically deal with, uh, uh, Lotus, uh, WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet --

B.30:  Right.   

A.31:  -- and, uh, we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in, in Dallas, Texas.

B.32:  Uh-huh.   

A.33:  And the mainframe has a lot of software out there where I use to interface
my computer with,

B.34:  Are, are you at the point where the, the mainframe appears slow to you,
relative to your personal computer, given the, the ratio,

A.35:  No, uh, there was at one point in time where, where, it was continually
down.

B.36:  Uh-huh.   

A.37:  It, it appears at though whenever I wanted to use it, it wasn't working and
this was about [lipsmack] [breathing] seven, ten years ago.

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  And they made a dramatic effort of trying to reduce down time down to
nothing, and today, uh, I can't say that I can remember the last time it went
down.  Uh, several months.  It's, it's just up all the time now.  They take it
down, like, on Sunday nights like for a couple of hours to do maintenance or
whatever, but, uh, unless there's something dramatic that happens with the
telephone system, uh, usually doesn't break down.  And I think what they're
doing is they're using satellite somehow to, uh, to transmit the signals to
have a backup,

B.40:  Uh-huh.   

A.41:  some to back that, that system up so that there is no, no down time.

B.42:  You, you don't think that they went and did a, uh, what is it, an
((Ishihara)), uh, quality analysis?

A.43:  Analysis [laughter] I don't, I don't know how they fixed the problem, but
they're, uh, you know, the whole theme of, of what they were doing was, was to
measure and record and, and, uh, reduce down time.

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  And the other big thing is, uh, quality satisfaction or customer
satisfaction --

B.46:  Uh-huh.   

A.47:  -- how do, how do the users feel about the, the system and what are their
likes and dislikes.  And that's, that's, uh, that's where they, they were
heading and, uh, the system is fantastic, so it's, it's not slow.

B.48:  That,

A.49:  If anything, the, the P C is now slower than the mainframe.  We're
transmitting from, from, uh, New England to Dallas, Texas and I'm getting
responses in, in split seconds.

B.50:  That's tremendous.   

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  Are, are your computers at work net, uh, networked at all or is that,

A.53:  Oh, well, that, that's another system that I link in to.  I, I network
internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro --

B.54:  Uh-huh.   

A.55:  -- and use the mainframe for corporation, uh, type programs like payroll
and, uh, financial data bases.  And we also have, uh, a message system which
is a worldwide network within, within the corporation --

B.56:  Uh-huh.   

A.57:  -- where I can send telegrams to any T I site and they've also hooked up to
some company to allow us to do E mail and allow it to convert it --

B.58:  Huh.   

A.59:  -- to other companies so that th-, other companies can recognize our E mail
and now we're getting into faxes as well.  Right off the P C.

B.60:  That's tremendous.   

A.61:  Yeah.  That's, uh, the technology is really, [laughter] really blow, you
know, going, going crazy with this.

B.62:  It's clearly a, uh, a, uh, productivity enhancement, uh, device and allows
you to do,

A.63:  Uh, originally I didn't think it was.  I thought that what ended, you know,
we ended up doing was, uh, doing all of the secretarial work and the
secretaries had nothing to do.  Uh, and, and that, I guess part of that is
true [laughter].  Uh, I do all my own typing.  I, I, I don't give anymore, uh,
paper to the secretary to type up.  Only because, it takes me longer to write
it and then redo it and then give it back to her again than it does for me to
sit down and, and do it and correct it myself.  I, I, I am not a typist.  I
type with two fingers, but I do very well at it, and, uh, I, I do everything.
I do my only typing, do my own foils, uh, it's just, it's just so much easier
for me to do that.

B.64:  That, that's been my experience also.  I've actually, I guess I've been
doing that since probably when I was in high school.

A.65:  Uh-huh.   

B.66:  Many years ago and, uh, it, it, it's gotten to the point now, I think where
the, uh, secretaries are, are finding other jobs to do because, you know, the
typing and to some extent the filing is just not there anymore.

A.67:  Yeah and,    

B.68:  Big paper files are disappearing.    

A.69:  The, the files may be disappearing, but the secretaries are not.  The, the
people, people in power are, are afraid to give up that status symbol.

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  And, uh, although what they're doing now is, is they're maintaining
secretaries, but, they're piling more and more people onto that one secretary.
Rather than get rid of the secretary, [laughter] they're, they're just, you
know, they're finding justification by adding more people to her.

B.72:  I guess there's, there's a fear that one day, if the computers ever stopped
working, there'd be a bunch of people staring at the typewriter with no idea
what to do with it.

A.73:  Well, I don't know, like, back in my particular office there must be at
least, uh, twenty, twenty-five people, one secretary, no typewriter.

B.74:  Huh.   

A.75:  It's all computers, everybody's got a, a P C sitting in front of their
desk.

B.76:  Do you, uh, if, if, I assume you all are networked to a, a variety of, of
laser printers.

A.77:  Oh, uh, I, I have a laser printer, I have access to a laser printer in my
office, but I don't have one tied in to my system yet.

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  [Breathing] Uh, I'm, I'm networked into it, but it's so inconvenient for
me to, to, to run all the way downstairs that, [laughter] that I don't use it.

B.80:  Huh, because what I was, what I was going to ask you is, it seems like the
next big jump will come with color printing.

A.81:  Yeah.   

B.82:  You were talking about doing your own presentation and foils.  It would
seem that color capability would be the next big sort of leap in (( )) .

A.83:  Well, I think, what I see is a different direction.  I don't know if you,
are you familiar with, uh, programs like Harvard Graphics?

B.84:  Yeah.   

A.85:  Where they have, uh, uh, like a print shop --  

B.86:  Right.   

A.87:  -- or, or a thing in the system.  Well, we have, uh, instead of using
view-, view foil machines we have, uh, a transmitter that will pick up the
signal from the, the monitor and, and transmit it just like a view foil.

B.88:  Huh.   

A.89:  So, we, we do that somewhat.  Uh, we also have,  

B.90:  A-,

A.91:  uh, teleconferencing where we have, uh, the, the mainframe as being the
monitor, in other words, if you've got foils, you pull it out of the mainframe
and then use the telephone speaker system to communicate with.

B.92:  Wow.   

A.93:  And, and we use, uh, we do teleconferencing that way.  So that, that
everybody's looking at the same foil because we're pulling it off the network.

B.94:  Interesting.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, pretty powerful, uh, set of
tools to give to people who traditionally have had to go through a whole
production process just to get ((people together)) .

A.95:  Oh, yeah I can remember at one time the, the, uh, secretaries actually had
to be artists and [laughter], and technicians and today, uh, with the laser
printer they're, uh, really not being utilized as much as they had been in the
past.  I'm making some really pretty foils that, uh, four or five years ago I
wouldn't have ever dreamed I could be doing them and it's, it's so easy to do,
uh, with the, with the programs that are out there now.

B.96:  Huh.  Well, uh, Frank, I think I kind of need to get back to some other
things, so,

A.97:  All right, okay.  

B.98:  I hope we've talked, uh,

A.99:  I believe we have.  

B.100:  Covered enough of, of this for, for what this is all about. 

A.101:  Okay, nice talking to you.  

B.102:  Yeah, it was a pleasure.  

A.103:  Take it easy.  

B.104:  Thank you.  Bye.
