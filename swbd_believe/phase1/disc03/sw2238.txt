============================================================================

A.1:  ((In)) Carolina and I've had Baltimore, Maryland so,

B.2:  Wow, that's great.  You're just getting all over the country, aren't you?
[laughter].

A.3:  I'm a non-Texas Instruments employee and I alw-,

B.4:  Oh, really?   

A.5:  I always feel like when I get someone in Texas that you're probably
employed by Texas Instruments.

B.6:  Yes, I am, I am [laughter].

A.7:  Yeah, well, I was surprised that they had their peop-, their own people in
the survey, but then, why not.

B.8:  Well, I didn't realize that, I thought all of it was T I employees in the
survey,

A.9:  Oh, I see [laughter].

B.10:  I, I didn't, I was the other way around, I thought, I didn't realize
there were outside people in the survey, so.

A.11:  Uh, do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished?

B.12:  Um, I am not positive, um, I, I probably have gotten about the same
information you have because I don't work anywhere even near the division.
I'm in even, even in a completely different site so,

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  I know that, that once they get through with this, I, I've read where
they're, they may call ce-, certain people back for like the second phase or
something I'm, but I'm not really sure.  I mean, I know, d-, you know why
they're, yo-, gathering the information, right?

A.15:  No, I don't.   

B.16:  Oh, you don't?  What they're, what they're working on is, uh, the way I
understand it is the computer system that, you know, in the future and who
knows how far in the future they, they believe that computers will be able to
understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in
what you want the computer to do,

A.17:  Oh, I see.   

B.18:  you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do.

A.19:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.    

B.20:  And that's why they're gathering the voices, in order to do research to
enable computers to be able to do that.

A.21:  In other words, they want to know if other voice can direct a machine.

B.22:  Right.  That's exactly right.

A.23:  Well, gosh, I couldn't direct children.  I doubt that [laughter] I can
direct a machine.

B.24:  Direct a machine, huh?

A.25:  Are you in Dallas now?

B.26:  Um, I'm in Lewisville which is just north of Dallas,

A.27:  North of Dallas.

B.28: just about thirty minutes north of Dallas, yeah, so. 

A.29:  Yeah.  We, uh, just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through
the Dallas Fort Worth area,

B.30:  Did you?   

A.31:  without, uh, stopping for any reason whatsoever,  

B.32:  [Laughter].   

A.33:  and I, we're, our town is five thousand, so, I was very concerned about
what the trip, the traffic would be like,

B.34:  Sure.   

A.35:  around Dallas Fort Worth and, gosh, we were through there before we even
realized,

B.36:  Yeah.   

A.37:  that we were in heavy traffic, so you've got a good system. 

B.38:  Yeah, we really do.  We really do.  Unless you're doing it first thing in
the morning or last thing in the evening, you know.

A.39:  Right [laughter]. 

B.40:  But it's that way anywhere.   

A.41:  There is that time of day, isn't there?  [laughter]. 

B.42:  There is.  There is.   

A.43:  Uh, 

B.44:  It's that way anywhere you ((go)). 

@A.45: Shall we get on to nursing homes? 

B.46:  Yeah, that's fine.   

A.47:  Okay.   

B.48:  Go ahead.   

A.49:  [Beep] Uh, my mother is seventy-, will be seventy-nine years old,

B.50:  Oh, my goodness.   

A.51:  this fall and has been, uh, nursing home resident for nearly three years.

B.52:  Oh, really?   

A.53:  So, uh, I feel like I have, uh, my decision was not, I did not make the
decision to send her to a nursing home.  She made the decision that she could
not any longer live in, in her apartment by herself.  She had long since given
up her home and gone,

B.54:  Uh-huh.   

A.55:  into an apartment.   

B.56:  Uh-huh.   

A.57:  And, of course, that was her decision at the time too, so.  And then in
that we are in a small royal, a rural community, I think that makes such a
difference too because well, as a matter of fact, my daughter is now the
assistant director of nurses at that nursing home.  She,

B.58:  Oh, wow, how wonderful.   

A.59:  Yes, yes.  She wasn't at the time,  

B.60:  Uh-huh.   

A.61:  but she has since gone to that nursing home so I just feel that I did not
have any of the trauma that people talk about.

B.62:  You sound like you've gotten very lucky.   

A.63:  Well, it just did a,  

B.64:  You really have.   

A.65:  really marvelous thing,  

B.66:  Yeah.   

A.67:  and mother's mind is good.  It's her body,  

B.68:  Good.   

A.69:  that's bad.   

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  And, uh, fo-, to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing
home who's mind was not good,

B.72:  Uh-huh.   

A.73:  and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something, it
just would all be so different.

B.74:  Yeah, oh, definitely.  Yeah, we kind of went through a situation with my
father.  My father was a, um, dia-, he was pronounced a diabetic when he was
thirty,

A.75:  {Very faint} Huh.   

B.76:  and, uh, had diabetes for all, you know, many, many years and, you know,
didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have.

A.77:  Huh. 

B.78:  I mean, he was put on insulin immediately but his diet, he wasn't as
careful with as he should have been in the beginning, so, he deteriorated
rather quickly and by the time he was in his mid-fifties which is very young,

A.79:  Uh-huh.   

B.80:  he was, he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and
couldn't, couldn't walk for very long periods of time.  The muscles in his
neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had
to have something to lean his head back against and,

A.81:  Uh-huh.   

B.82:  and, you know, we were, you know, myself and my two sisters were, you
know, in the situation of the, a fifty-seven year old father looking in to put
him in a nursing home which was,

A.83:  I'm fifty-seven [laughter].    

B.84:  which was, at fif-, I'm not, it's scary, isn't it?

A.85:  Right. 

B.86:  Yeah, I mean it was, it was just a horrible situation for us to bo-, you
know, to be in and we just, you know, because, of course, like you say, like
your mother, his mind was, was perfect,

A.87:  Huh.    

B.88:  and wonderful.  It was, he just could not get around to take care of
himself and, uh, we ended up opting for, um, a live in nurse and, you know,
that came into his home and, and we set her up a room in the spare room, and
she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine a
fifty-seven year old man in a nursing home,

A.89:  Huh.   

B.90:  we just, you know, we just could not, could not imagine doing it.  And we
knew that it wouldn't, you know, we couldn't even do the, the live in nurse
thing forever, you know, and, but, he was just so against and, and when you
said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be,

A.91:  Uh-huh.   

B.92:  it was such a different story because he was so against going to a
nursing home,

A.93:  Huh.   

B.94:  which at that age I can't blame him,  

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  you know, it would just, it just scared him to death to be, you know,
that young and who knows, you know, the thought of being there another twenty
or thirty years,

A.97:  Yeah, yeah.   

B.98:  you know, just was, was just too much for him, you know, so we, you know,
we opted for that right out.  So, I kind of know what you mean about the, the
trauma of, you know, the thought of doing it,

A.99:  Uh-huh.   

B.100:  you know, it was just, it was just very hard.  But I guess, you know,
there's, there's, there's good things and there's bad ones.

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  I think you just have to be so very careful, you know, and, you know,
you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is, is still good and
they can tell you if they're being well taken care of.  I think otherwise you,
you end up with serious problems, you know.

A.103:  In our locality we have a lot of, uh, government services like the Home
Health Care and et cetera,

B.104:  Uh-huh.   

A.105:  et cetera, which I'm sure they do in cities too.

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  But we do not have the staff to draw fr-, from to find someone who could
stay for,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  day in and day out.  With th-, we just don't have those people.

B.110:  Uh-huh.   

A.111:  They just are not available, even though you would, 

B.112:  Well you know,

A.113:  like to make that choice. 

B.114:  That was another situation because my, this was, my father lived in
Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and, uh, we
just got very, very lucky and found a woman who was willing to do this, and,
you know, someone that we had known from, you know, had lived in ten-, you
know, that same town,

A.115:  Oh.    

B.116:  forever and we knew very well, and we knew her history, and we knew that
she wasn't going to steal from him,

A.117:  Yeah.   

B.118:  we knew that she would take good care of him and, and we just got
extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it.  And she stayed five
days a week and spent the night but did go home on weekends.

A.119:  Oh. 

B.120:  And then we found another girl who had been ((kind of)) coming in and
helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that
she was willing to stay on the weekends,

A.121:  Huh.   

B.122:  and help him.  So, we just got (( )) like you,  

A.123:  Huh. 

B.124:  only the other end.  We got extremely lucky, 

A.125:  Huh. 

B.126:  all the way around that we were able to find somebody,

A.127:  How long,  

B.128:  that would stay with him at home.   

A.129:  how long were you able to maintain that? 

B.130:  Well, at, we only ma-, we only did that for, um, I guess that went on for
about, all, not quite six months.  He passed away,

A.131:  Oh.   

B.132:  after six months,  

A.133:  Oh. 

B.134:  there at home which we were very thankful,  

A.135:  Yeah.   

B.136:  that we were able to keep him at home,  

A.137:  {Very faint} Yeah.   

B.138:  and that, you know, he did,  

A.139:  Oh.   

B.140:  pass away at home, and, uh, rather than being in a nursing home, I know
he was much happier spending that six months at home,

A.141:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.142:  you know, definitely, so.   

A.143:  Your mother was not living or,

B.144:  Uh, they were, they had been divorced,  

A.145:  Yeah.   

B.146:  many years earlier.   

A.147:  Yeah.   

B.148:  Yeah, so he was, he was alone, 

A.149:  Yeah. 

B.150:  and really had, you know, and, and, uh, my, uh, youngest sister was, um,
about an hour and a half away in college and, uh, I was, you know, down here
six,

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  hundred miles away, 

A.153:  Huh. 

B.154:  and then my, the third sister was in Atlanta, Georgia, you know, so we
weren't really, well, we were even right there, where we could take care of
him, you know, so it was really a hard situation,

A.155:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.   

B.156:  you know, when, in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out,
it's not as easy as it used to be to take care,

A.157:  Uh-huh.   

B.158:  of aging parents, you know, it, you know, yo-, it's hard to move them in
with you or you move in with them or even, you know, drop in everyday, you
know, you just,

A.159:  I just never considered the moving in with, I could not ever,

B.160:  Yeah. 

A.161:  have handled that.  My mother is in incontinent and, uh,  

B.162:  Uh-huh.   

A.163:  and I don't know, I suppose that would have been my excuse, uh, but I
don't think had that situation ex-, not existed that I could have done that at
all.  I'm not, I,

B.164:  That's a, that's a real trying experience to try to, you know, to move back
in and, and live harmoniously together after all those years.  {Very faint}
It's, uh,

A.165:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think, my sister is an R N and lives in Knoxville,
Tennessee, and I think that my mother had thought, in the back of her mind,
that she perhaps might go to Jean's and it,

B.166:  Uh-huh. 

A.167:  did take, when she first went into the c-, care center, she just
completely gave up.

B.168:  Uh-huh. 

A.169:  Uh, just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in.

B.170:  Oh. 

A.171:  And that went on for almost six months, and, uh, finally, my sister came to
visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care
center, and my sister is very blunt, and she said, mother this is going to be
your home you might as well get used to it, which I could not ((stay)) to her.

B.172:  Uh-huh.   

A.173:  And from that point on I think within the next six months she came to
except that as fact, and then she began improving and is walking better now
than,

B.174:  Wonderful.   

A.175:  she probably did in three years,  

B.176:  Oh, that's wonderful.   

A.177:  but still for the most part, she is wheelchair bound or bed bound.

B.178:  Uh-huh.     

A.179:  And, um, I don't know, I guess maybe I have excepted that the nursing home
is her home because I've started to decorate her room more than I ever did,

B.180:  Uh-huh.   

A.181:  in the beginning, so, uh, even though everyone knows that's the way it
has to be, you still, it takes a little bit to except,

B.182:  Doesn't make it easy.  

A.183:  No,  

B.184:  No. 

A.185:  no, and certainly it's very expensive.   

B.186:  Oh. 

A.187:  There's no question about that.   

B.188:  No doubt, no doubt.   

A.189:  But we had a severe ice,
