===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right.  Last thing I saw was, um, I think, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
with Julia Roberts.

A.3:  Oh, I hadn't seen that, but I've heard that it's real good.

B.4:  My husband didn't like it that much.  I thought it was okay.  It was a
little strange, you know, this woman supposedly is, um, being mentally abused
by her husband, you know, he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the
house, and she figures out this way to, um, to leave him secretly.  You know,
she fakes her death kind of thing and --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- he tracks her down [laughter].

A.7:  Oh [sigh].

B.8:  So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she
realizes he's in the house, you know, after her, but, uh, kind of had the
feeling along that, uh, why didn't she just tell him to straighten up.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  [Laughter] You know, why didn't she just tell hi-, Hey look bucko, you
don't get away with this nonsense [laughter].

A.11:  Oh [sigh].

B.12:  But anyhow, um, what have you seen?

A.13:  Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and we went to two movies.  We went to see AWAKENINGS --

B.16:  Um.

A.17:  -- with Robin {pause} Williams.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  And I really liked both of them.  I really did.  AWAKENING was, it was kind
of sad to me.  It really was, and it would, it would be to anyone because, you
know, they really don't know that much about it.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  So this is where the people have been kind of {pause} W-, I don't
a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  for a long time.

A.25:  Yeah, yeah.

B.26:  And the drugs let them come back.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  But the drugs didn't work for long, and they started having real
bad side effects.

B.28:  Oh [sigh].

A.29:  And this is about nineteen sixty-four, I believe, or something like that,
and there still hasn't been any, you know, new development in prescribed drugs
that can help it.

B.30:  Um.

A.31:  But, yeah, there, you know, it, it was a big breakthrough, but in time, you
know, the, all the side effects started showing.

B.32:  Well, how bad were the side effects?

A.33:  Bad.

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  Yeah, yeah.  They was actually went back like they were,

B.36:  Oh [sigh]. 

A.37:  you know, 

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  yeah.  All it was, they wasn't mild, you know, they was just bad side
effects.

B.40:  Um.

A.41:  But I really enjoyed it, though.

B.42:  Um.

A.43:  You know.

B.44:  Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP?

A.45:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's strictly for entertainment [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  That was just [laughter], it was,

B.48:  You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, uh, a bit of a variety
actor, you know.  At first he was just a big muscle man.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  But he's kind of branching out.

A.51:  He sure is.  He is, as a matter of fact, um, Sylvester Stallone, is that
his name?

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie-, variety
player more so than he is, because he really played the part good.

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  You know, he could be this rough, tough guy and then, you know, this
substitute teacher.

B.56:  Um.

A.57:  It was really good.

B.58:  Well, there was a movie out, it's been on cable, I get cable, and there's
this thing with, uh, Danny De Vito called TWINS.

A.59:  Oh, I've seen that. Yes.

B.60:  I thought that was just great.

A.61:  It is, it is, isn't it?  Yes, yes.

B.62:  I even like some, I mean, some of the original stuff, like I like THE
TERMINATOR.  At first, you know, it was kind of strange,

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:   but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  And, and some of the other things.  Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought
was really good, last summer.

A.67:  Oh, yeah.

B.68:  Guess it didn't last too long at the box office,

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  but I thought it was pretty good.

A.71:  I did too, I really did.  

B.72:  And,

A.73:  I enjoy a lot of movies.  Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't
handle [chiming].

B.74:  Um.

A.75:  I'm not into that, you know, I ju-, like RAMBO and all that.

B.76:  Um.

A.77:  I, that's just {pause} something I just don't want to watch.

B.78:  Yeah, yeah, and I, I have some, one person at work I know gets really into
those goofy horror flicks --

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  -- and I just keep telling her, how can you do that?  And I told her when
she had her, her little girl.  I said, now you better get out of the habit of
watching those.  You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl,

A.81:  [/Chiming]. 

B.82:  and she says her little girl's into it now.

A.83:  Oh, my goodness.

B.84:  And she wat-, she watches these really gross things you know, like,

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET,

A.87:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.88:  and, The, you know, that kind of,

A.89:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.90:  junk.  

A.91:  Oh.

B.92:  I don't go for that at all.

A.93:  I guess I'm a little too scary [laughter] for that.

B.94:  I remember when I was real little, I, we all went to some kind of scary
movie, and it was like this ho-, big house had a basement, and there was all
these weird things going on in the basement, you know, and I was scared to
death of our house had a basement for years.

A.95:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.96:  You know, and I got a lot of really weird ideas,

A.97:  Yes, yes.

B.98:  from that goofy movie.

A.99:  Yes.

B.100:  You know, they tell you that kids can, you know, be impressed by all that
stuff, and it's true.

A.101:  It is, it really is, yes.

B.102:  I, I had a lot of things that I, I, nobody told me that it was all fake.
I was just sitting there watching it,

A.103:  watchi-, yeah.

B.104:  going [talking] {like a scared child} Oh, jeez [laughter].

A.105:  Watching, yes, [talking] {as if a scared child} oh, I don't want to go
home, {normal voice} yes, yes [laughter]. Oh, goodness.

B.106:  But I think a lot of kids, it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like
there's somebody under the bed.

A.107:  Yes.  Oh.

B.108:  Where do we get that from?

A.109:  Yes, I know, uh, I have two children.  I really try to watch what they
watch, I really do, because my youngest one, he watches something, you might
as well just plan on staying up all night, because you know [laughter],

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  He'll come in, Mama, I think the ghost is in the house, Mama, I hear it,

B.112:  Um.

A.113:  don't you?

B.114:  How old are they?

A.115:  They're eight and ten.

B.116:  [Laughter].

A.117:  So they're, you know, (( )) it's just a movie, you know, I try to say, it's
just a movie, but no, Mama, I've seen it [laughter].

B.118:  Oh, but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, uh, three kids, and
the little boy must have been, oh, maybe about ten.  And we rented CHARLOTTE'S
WEB. Okay.

A.119:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.120:  And he just bawled at the end --

A.121:  Oh, 

B.122:  -- and just [noise] {imitating a crying child} uh, she's not going to die.

A.123:  Oh.

B.124:  And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay, and he didn't want to listen
to it.

A.125:  Oh.

B.126:  He just was beside himself, you know, this is supposed to be a nice
children's movie, CHARLOTTE'S WEB.  He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte
was going to die at the end.

A.127:  Die, oh [laughter].  Oh [sigh].

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  It's funny how your little minds work, isn't it?

B.130:  Oh, yeah {imitating a crying child}.  She's so nice, she can't die
[laughter].

A.131:  Oh [laughter].

B.132:  [Laughter]  Oh, it was jus-,

A.133:  Oh, I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars,
people like us, you know [laughter].

B.134:  [Laughter]  Oh,

A.135:  [Laughter]  Oh, goodness.  Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.

B.136:  You too.

A.137:  And maybe we'll run across each other again.

@@B.138:  Yeah, this is kind of neat.  I haven't ever initiated a call.  I've just
been called, you know, by the switchboard, and, uh, well, the first week, I
think, a lot more people were doing it.  But I normally get a call like every
other day.

A.139:  Do you?  Well, as far as, we could not call in last week.

B.140:  Um.

A.141:  You know, from where I'm at.

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  We couldn't call in.  They said it would be up Friday, the, March the
fifteenth before it was prepared.  So I missed several days, because I was
getting quite a few calls.

B.144:  Um.  How weird.  I don't know, and they, they do have a variety of topics.
My first one was the toughest,

A.145:  [Cough].

B.146:  it was something like discuss pollution.

A.147:  Oh, uh-huh, oh.

B.148:  [Laughter] (( )) It was discuss air pollution, 

A.149:  Yes.

B.150:  causes of it and cures.  I was going, oh, well [laughter].

A.151:  Oh.  Well, my husband, sometimes, you know, he'll receive a call and he's
at work,

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  and, if I, you know, if I know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as
mine, but the other day I got one about fishing and I thought, oh, my.

B.154:  [Laughter].

A.155:  I don't know a thing about fishing, so I'm not even going to try
[laughter].

B.156:  [Laughter].

A.157:  Because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good
time, believe me.
 
B.158:  Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water
[laughter].

A.159:  Yeah, but I'm really not for sure, though, if [laughter] Well, I'll let you
go, and we'll talk to you later.

B.160:  All right.  #Bye-bye.#

A.161:  #Bye-bye.#
