REMARKS:        Tape skipped badly in some places, and there was a clicking 
noise that sounded like the phone being disconnected. 

==============================================================================

A.1:  Have you been having any, uh, good weather lately?   

B.2:  Well, today was really nice.  The past few days have been rather chilly.
Uh, we had a lot of rain recently.  I'm in Texas, where are you?

A.3:  Oh, I'm in Texas, Plano.   

B.4:  Oh, you are?    

A.5:  Uh-huh.   

B.6:  Do you work for T I?   

A.7:  Yes, I do.   

B.8:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, so then we've been having just about the same weather
[laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, it was pretty nice today, but I stayed inside.  I came up with a cold
couple days ago so I'm taking care of that.  But, uh, yeah it's nice and sunny
out.

B.10:  Yeah.  Have you been doing anything outside in this great weather?

A.11:  Uh, not lately [laughter].   

B.12:  No.   

A.13:  But, uh, yeah, there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had,
uh, tornados up in, uh, Oklahoma and I guess in Wichita Falls, too.

B.14:  Yeah, I know we had a tornado w-, watch, uh, couple of days ago, but
nothing really happened.

A.15:  Uh-huh.   

B.16:  Are you originally from, uh, Texas?   

A.17:  No, I'm from Wisconsin originally.   

B.18:  The, 

A.19:  Uh, I don't know what the weather's been like up there, but, uh, typically
in March it's still, uh, kind, uh, kind of like winter.

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  Uh, very cold.   

B.22:  Well, I lived in New York for a long time so Texas is, Texas weather is
quite, uh, different for me.

A.23:  Well, we had a real mild winter here, though.   

B.24:  Yeah, we did, w-, they're always mild to me compared to New York winters.

A.25:  [Laughter] Okay I can believe that, uh-huh.   

B.26:  [Laughter] Have you have been to New York in the winter.   

A.27:  No, I've, well, Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes, too, but, [clicking] 
uh, probably not near as bad as New York, uh, I'm sure.

B.28:  Uh-huh.   

A.29:  I think it depends on what part of the state.   

B.30:  Right.    

A.31:  But this winter here, I think we only had one instance of ice, one weekend.

B.32:  Right [clicking].   

A.33:  And, uh, other than that, uh, it was, uh, maybe just, uh, three real cold
spells.  I don't have too much, uh, shrubbery damage from that, but, uh, still
some didn't manage to survive.

B.34:  Yeah.  The only thing I don't like about, uh, Dallas weather is that it
gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer.

A.35:  Yeah, it gets, it gets, uh, hot, but, uh, it's not very humid.

B.36:  Yeah [clicking].   

A.37:  And there's always a nice, uh, breeze blowing.   

B.38:  Yeah, like New York was really humid, you know, you, but you could, you
could walk around outside in New York.  You could stay outside in, in it, you
know, because it was, I guess the average summer temperature is about 
eighty --

A.39:  Yeah.   

B.40:  -- you know, in the eighties.  And it was pretty pleasant except for the
humidity.

A.41:  Yeah, I've been here about thirteen years and I've gotten quite acclimated
to the weather.  I, the summers don't bother me anymore at all.

B.42:  Uh-huh.   

A.43:  I don't mind when it gets over a hundred degrees.   

B.44:  [Breathing] Well at least you can plan, you can say well, I'm going to
go to the beach next Wednesday,

A.45:  [Laughter].   

B.46:  and you'll know it's going to be hot enough to go.   

A.47:  Yeah.   

B.48:  But, i-, in New York you really never know.  You can plan to, you know, to
go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then, you know, it might be
seventy degrees or something.

A.49:  Sure.   

B.50:  Uh-huh.   

A.51:  I don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year.  I imagine
it's going to be hot again.

B.52:  Yeah.  I'm sure it will in Dallas, Texas [laughter].   

A.53:  [Laughter] {pause} Well that's pretty typical, though.  U I don't, uh,

B.54:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.55:  I don't guess it's going to be any much different, uh, than, than it has
been in the past.  So I expect, uh, July and August we'll see our n-, or, uh,
share of hundred degree days.

B.56:  Right.  Have you ever been to Canada?   

A.57:  No, I never have.   

B.58:  Um.   

A.59:  I've been close, uh, was in Detroit one time.   

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  Just right across the river from Windsor.   

B.62:  That's supposed to be really cold weather in the winter.   

A.63:  Yeah, I believe that.   

B.64:  That's why New York gets so cold, because it's so close to Canada.

A.65:  I was in Wisconsin over the Christmas holidays --  

B.66:  Uh-huh.   

A.67:  -- and it was about, uh, twenty below zero when I got up there.

B.68:  Goodness.   

A.69:  They, uh, they had a high of, I think, eighteen degrees during the week
that I was there.

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  So it's stayed cold for the entire week.   

B.72:  Was it snow, snowing?   

A.73:  Uh, we got one day of snow and one day of ice.   

B.74:  Um.   

A.75:  Other than that it was pretty good, just cold.   

B.76:  You know, uh, Christmas really doesn't seem like Christmas to me unless I
do see the snow and the ice.

A.77:  We don't get too much snow here.   

B.78:  It's just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights.

A.79:  Well, I can live without ice.   

B.80:  Not necessarily, not the ice.   

A.81:  [Laughter].   

B.82:  I should k-, leave the ice out of it, but the snow is real pretty.

A.83:  Yeah, snow's nice.   

B.84:  Uh-huh.   

A.85:  Doesn't usually last too long here.   

B.86:  I r-, I know one Christmas when I was in Dallas it sn-, it snowed and, and
there was a white Christmas, but I don't, [breathing] I guess it's been
about five or six years ago.

A.87:  Yeah, I remember maybe, uh, maybe three winters where we had a white
Christmas here.

B.88:  Uh-huh.   

A.89:  Other than that it's, uh, the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or
two.

B.90:  Yeah.  I just think it's really, really pretty.   

A.91:  We,  

B.92:  (( )) one Christmas here it was sixty degrees [breathing].

A.93:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, that's not uncommon.   

B.94:  That was so strange to me having lived in New York, you know.

A.95:  What's really bad here in winter is when we get, uh, ice on the roads and
the temperature doesn't get above freezing.

B.96:  Yeah.   

A.97:  There is no, uh, ice removal equipment.   

B.98:  Yeah, and people drive like the street is dry.   

A.99:  Yeah.  That is if, if the businesses are all open, uh, lot of them close
down.

B.100:  Yeah.  I don't think T I's closed down in a couple of years for bad
weather.

A.101:  That's right, we didn't close at all this past winter.   

B.102:  Um.  I'll look forward to one of those days [breathing]. 

A.103:  Yeah {pause}.  Well,  

B.104:  Not, 

A.105:  we usually have to make them up, though, so [laughter].   

B.106:  Tha-, that's true [laughter].  Did you say you work in Plano?

A.107:  Uh, well, I work at the main set in Dallas.   

B.108:  Oh, you do.  

A.109:  I s-,  

B.110:  I do, too.  

A.111:  Yeah, uh-huh. {pause} I, well, did, uh, did you get much rain two days ago?

B.112:  Did I get what?    

A.113:  Much rain.  

B.114:  Two days ago?   

A.115:  Yeah, Thursday.   

B.116:  Uh, I know it sprinkled some.   

A.117:  I didn't get much rain, here in Plano, but I guess it really poured in
Richardson.

B.118:  Uh-huh.  I believe it, it, it, uh, [lipsmack] it rained at night or
something because I saw puddles of water outside.  But I didn't,

A.119:  Yeah, I don't think we got, uh, I don't think we got it near as bad as, uh,
Oklahoma and --

B.120:  Uh-huh.   

A.121:  -- I guess Fort Worth had, h-, high winds.  In fact,  

B.122:  Uh-huh.   

A.123:  uh, the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water
Gardens that killed two people.

B.124:  Uh-huh.   

A.125:  So they usually get, uh, worse weather w-, than we do.   

B.126:  Yeah.   

A.127:  In winter, too.   

B.128:  Well, March is the, the month for high winds.   

A.129:  Yeah.   

B.130:  And it's been rather windy here, too.   

A.131:  Uh, y-, get a lot of tornados, too.  This is the time of the year.

B.132:  Uh-huh.  Have you heard the forecast for the week coming up? 

A.133:  No, I sure haven't.  It's,  

B.134:  Yeah, I haven't either.   

A.135:  I think it's supposed to be nice, though.   

B.136:  Yeah, it's probably going to start getting summer.  Hot [laughter].

A.137:  Seventies to eighties, I guess.   

B.138:  Yeah {pause}.  Well, that's nice.   

A.139:  I've been checking on my plants, seeing the, the roses bud out already.

B.140:  Oh, you plant.   

A.141:  Yeah, somewhat, uh --  

B.142:  Oh.  

A.143:  -- have to kind of watch, watch the weather make sure everything is going
the way it's supposed to.

B.144:  Uh-huh.   

A.145:  Waiting for the, wai-, waiting for the weather to get nice out so I can go
ahead and, uh, [clicking] replace some of the, some of the dead shrubs from
winter.

B.146:  Uh-huh.   

A.147:  But, uh, like I said, I stayed in today because I picked up a cold the
other day, so didn't feel like going outside and doing much [clicking].

B.148:  Yeah.  Well, it probably, they'll probably do okay now.  I have a friend
that's planted some, uh, planted a garden, some things like collard greens and
cabbage.

A.149:  Uh-huh.   

B.150:  And, uh, they're coming up really pretty. {pause} Just need a, just need a
good rain [clicking].

A.151:  Yeah.  We, we really h-, didn't get enough rain the other day to, uh, do
much good for, uh, things growing.

B.152:  Uh-huh.   

A.153:  Just, a lot of weeds right now [laughter].   

B.154:  Yeah.   

A.155:  And they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not.   

B.156:  Yeah.  Well, I live in an apartment so the only thing I grow are plants
inside,

A.157:  Uh-huh.   

*B.158:  and I don't do very well with those.  I think the temperature in here,

A.159:  Well, you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature that you
d-, than you do outside [laughter]. 

B.160:  Yeah, but I guess I just don't know what I'm doing [breathing].

A.161:  Okay.   

B.162:  {Pause} Sometimes I, I sit the plants outside on the patio and, and I
forget about them and it gets too hot out there and, and they, you know, burn
up and so forth.  That's happened to quite a few of my plants.

A.163:  Yeah, I don't do well with potted plants outside.  I tend to neglect them.

B.164:  Yeah.   

A.165:  And they sit in the sun too long and dry up or, uh, if I don't put them in
the sun they don't grow [laughter].  

B.166:  Uh-huh.   

A.167:  I don't know.  But, uh, yeah, I guess next week's supposed to be real nice
outside.  I hope it is anyway because, uh, softball season starts and we're
ready,

B.168:  Uh-huh.   

A.169:  to, to go outside and do some [breathing] outdoor activities.

B.170:  Well, good, I hope, hope it's nice, too.   

A.171:  Okay.  Well, uh, I haven't heard the forecast for the ne-, for, uh, coming
up for this weekend or next week so I'm not sure what to expect.  I can only
guess that it's supposed to be nice.

B.172:  Yeah.  I hope it's as nice as it was today.   

A.173:  Uh-huh.   

B.174:  Seems like it was extra cold last night, though. 

A.175:  I'm not sure what the overnight low was.   

B.176:  But I know it was cold, I had turn on the heat and,  

A.177:  Oh, yeah?    

B.178:  quilts, [breathing] yeah.

A.179:  Guess I'll have to turn on the, the weather, 

B.180:  Yeah. 

A.181:  on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect {pause}.  Anyway, I
guess everything's been pretty typical for March.

B.182:  Uh-huh.   

A.183:  Have to see what, uh, April or May have to offer.   

B.184:  The summer really starts in Dallas that I r-, I remember on year seems like
it started about the end of February.

A.185:  Sometimes it does, uh,  

B.186:  Yeah, hot.   

A.187:  sometimes it'll get in the eighties, uh, as early as, uh, January,
February.

B.188:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, but it, up in New York it's cold till about June.

A.189:  Well, they still have snow on the ground through March, 

B.190:  Um. 

A.191:  and probably part of April sometimes.   

B.192:  Yeah.  One thing about the snow in March, it, at, at least it'll melt.  It
melts quickly up there.

A.193:  Well, it leaves a mess, then, when it does melt because everything thaws
out.

B.194:  That's true [breathing]. 

A.195:  Lot of mud,
