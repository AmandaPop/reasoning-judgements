A.1:  Okay.   

B.2:  Lead on.   

A.3:  [Laughter] Uh, drug testing doesn't bother me.   

B.4:  Doesn't bother you?   

A.5:  No, uh, I've been drug tested twice at T I and it doesn't bother me.  
Uh,

B.6:  Well, we differ there.   

A.7:  [Laughter].   

B.8:  It bothers me.   

A.9:  Why, why does it bother you?   

B.10:  I just feel like it's an invas-, invasion of my privacy. 

A.11:  [Breathing] [lipsmack]. 

B.12:  You know, I, you know, there's a lot, alcohol for example, I can go out and
drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job than if I go
out on Friday and, I don't know say take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night.
Not saying that I do, but --

A.13:  I know,

B.14:  -- I just,

A.15:  I understand.  Uh,  

B.16:  I think alcohol's a, a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted.

A.17:  Well, that's true.  I, I agree that there should be something done about
people that drink alcohol, because I'm sure that there's people that drink and
come to work especially on a second shift or third shift.  So, uh, I agree
with you there.  But it just, uh, and it, and it probably is an invasion of
privacy.

B.18:  I, I feel like it's okay, if there's, if there's cause, somebody's
performance is, you know, in-, indicates that they're, they're obviously not
all there, they're --

A.19:  Do, yeah, okay,  

B.20:  -- you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure, you
know, take them down there and test them.  But I think a lot of people are
going to go out and, you know, substitute something else for maybe what they
would have done.  A lot of people, I, I personally don't smoke pot, but, a lot
of people do and they do it in their own time at their, at their, at their own
place.  And they're going to find, they're going to go out and drink instead
because they know that it's their job on the line.

A.21:  That's true.   

B.22:  And, uh, you know, I've been, I've come to work hung over in the morning
and I know I'm worthless.

A.23:  Feel bad, yeah. 

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  I don't drink anymore, but I can remember [laughter].

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  I can remember the, you know, there's nothing worse than a hangover.  I
have to agree there, nothing worse than a, I can remember staying in bed a
whole day from a hangover [laughter].  And not going to work, but, I, that was
years ago and I didn't work for T I, so, but you, you know, really and truly
there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right, and you cannot perform
well.

B.28:  And the same is true of the drug hangover.  You know, if you,

A.29:  That's true.

B.30:  But, there's, I think there's a, there's a big difference between use and
abuse and I do agree that drug abuse should be punished, but if somebody's
going to, in their own home, on their own time in such a way that doesn't
interfere with their responsibilities, you know, do it, do some drugs then
that should be their business.

A.31:  Course, through this I think that they've helped a lot of people also.  Uh,
a lot of people have ended up going, uh, to treatment, you know, which is
offered, I think at most government places.  I know it is at T I.  Do you work
for T I.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  Okay.

B.34:  I do.

A.35:  Well, you know, a lot of people have used that treatment and I, center, and
that's probably been a good thing, especially for cocaine abusers and stuff.

B.36:  I think, I think that's true, and I think that the key thing is the
difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't, they, they don't
know how to use drugs for recreational purposes without it becoming, you know,
a dominant force in their life.

A.37:  The drug can use you.

B.38:  Yeah.  It's, it's, you know, it's easy for me to say I'm going to go out on
Friday night and maybe, you know, I don't have to work till Monday, and if I
want to go out and, and drink a little beer or do something, and just dance a
lot or whatever, that's fine as long as I realize Saturday that in order to,
you know, I'm going to feel like crap,

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  that's just the way it is.  Same thing if you drink,

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it
and, and unfortunately, and I think cocaine's a, a good example, it's, it's
just so much easier to just do some more, do some more and then before you
know it, you know, you're, you're always doing it.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  I don't know.

A.45:  That's true, that's true.  Yep, well,

B.46:  I mean, I, I work for T I, so I don't do drugs, you know.

A.47:  You can't,

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  I mean it, and, you just run the risk of --  

B.50:  It's too big a risk, yeah.

A.51:  -- of, of getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it's
not that big a deal, you have to go to treatment and that,

B.52:  But you're without a paycheck during that time.  And I don't, at least
that's my understanding is even, you know, the first time you go for
counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work.

A.53:  Oh, I didn't know they took you off the job.

B.54:  I was, that, I was told that, uh, somebody had, uh, some woman had, had a
cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband, or
maybe it was the other way around, one of them, anyway, had, uh, come down
with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day
and failed and was out of a job until they went through counseling.

A.55:  Wow.

B.56:  And it's, like, you know, I can't afford that kind of loss of income, you
know.

A.57:  Who can afford that [laughter].  My God, I can't afford to miss a day, let
alone six,

B.58:  I mean, I've always been, yeah, the first time, so what, I'll go explain
myself and, and,

A.59:  Now, I would have thought if he'd have brought in the pres-, (( )),
prescription, and explained the situation that they might have let him off of
that.

B.60:  That's what you would think, but I kind of,

A.61:  They didn't?

B.62:  I, that's, I, you know, I heard it through the grapevine, so,

A.63:  Okay.

B.64:  I don't, I don't know firsthand, but --  

A.65:  Yeah.   

B.66:  -- that's what I heard was that it was just, you know, there, there were 
no,

A.67:  Now see, that I wouldn't agree with.  See, see I think you got to be able
to bend the rules a little bit, here and there, too.  Without, you know, if,
if it's a case like that because look how many people take their husband's or
their wife's [breathing] medication, you know, but that's a really good
example.

B.68:  Oh, yeah, you know you've got the same exact thing.   

A.69:  Yeah, yeah.   

B.70:  Yeah.   

A.71:  And so, I would think that either the doctor could get him off with that
or, or that they should listen, I mean because I, I just can't see that they
would do some-, make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through
because he took his wife's medicine.  That just doesn't sound right, does it.
So it seems like they should be able to bend [beep] the rules, oops, excuse
me, a little bit on that.  But, you, but, I don't know,

B.72:  Well, I think,

A.73:  because I don't any anybody that's had to go through treatment or
anything, so I really don't know.

B.74:  I don't know anybody personally either.   

A.75:  You know.   

B.76:  I do know a lot of people that, you know, do use drugs, recrela-,
recreationally and there's such a big difference.  {pause} I, I don't know
it's, it's kind of, I've also been, you know, known manager at T I, I know
one, I guess I shouldn't make that a plural, but, uh, who drank on the job, had
whiskey in his desk drawer,

A.77:  [Breathing].

B.78:  and,  

A.79:  Ooh.

B.80:  you tell me, what's worse, you know.   

A.81:  Oh, that could have been his whole career down the tubes.  

B.82:  Yeah, but, everybody covers up, you know, it's the good old boy thing.  I
don't know.

A.83:  So does alcohol show up in these tests?   

B.84:  I don't think so.  They didn't test for it.   

A.85:  So, so it wouldn't show up.   

B.86:  It's not illegal.   

A.87:  Yeah, well it's not, that's true.  See there's the, there it is right
there, it's not illegal.  And drugs are illegal.  So I guess if they made
drugs legal or marijuana legal then we, the we wouldn't be going through this.
You know, they wouldn't be testing, which doesn't make any sense either
because they say, you know, it has no place on the job and you can't work
safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that.

B.88:  Well, that's true.   

A.89:  And so if it was made legal, that doesn't make it any safer,

B.90:  No.

A.91:  on the job [laughter].   

B.92:  No, I agree.  I think, I believe in test for cause if, if somebody's
performance, and I guess that there's the other argument is that, well, do you
wait until they screw up, you know,

A.93:  And get hurt.

B.94:  and someone gets hurt.   

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  Yeah, but at the same time, you know, you're telling me that on some given
day I'm going to walk in, they're going to tell me go down, and, and go down
to the health center and, you know, pee in a jar or whatever it is.

A.97:  [Laughter] Have you had to do it yet?

B.98:  No, I haven't.

A.99:  Oh, gosh,

B.100:  It's, uh,

A.101:  I was one of the first ones to go, I think.  The, with the January that
they started it up, I got called, so I was one of the first ones.  But, but,
y-, did you get tested when you got hired?

B.102:  No, see I was, I've been working for T I for almost eight years.

A.103:  Okay, so you were, well I, I got tested before I got hired, too, so.  But,
um,

B.104:  I have to, I have to honestly say that I drink more now than I did because,
you know, it's what I can get away with and if I'm going to go on the
weekends, spend my money and, you know, I, if you don't drink, you know, you
used to drink, okay you go out and you want to party and that's, that's
something you do when you're young and dumb I guess [laughter], you know.

A.105:  [Laughter] I'm not young anymore [laughter].

B.106:  I'm not as young as I used to be,

A.107:  I quit --

B.108:  but I still,   

A.109:  -- I quit drinking at, oh, a long time ago, quit drinking, I didn't sm-,
don't smoke, I gave everything up, so I guess, I don't know what, just old age
I guess is why I [laughter],

B.110:  I don't smoke, I quit doing that, and I've tried to quit drinking but it's,
it's the only thing left.  You know, I quit doing drugs when T I said quit and
it was no big deal, you know, it was like, I wasn't a regular drug user, but,
uh,

A.111:  Oh, I have a lot of friends that just are, uh, smoke, just, you know,
occasional joint at a party or something, you know, and, and I'm even afraid
to be around it.

B.112:  I, I understand.

A.113:  Because I'm afraid what if it gets, you know, because you can,

B.114:  I understand.

A.115:  inhale it if, if you're if a room full of it,

B.116:  I was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like, you
know, I smell it and I'm like, well is this going into my bloodstream, you
know.  Is --

A.117:  Into my bloodstream [laughter].

B.118:  -- is there going to be enough there to get me, get me in troub-,

A.119:  Yeah, and with my luck there'd be the notice Monday, you know, [laughter]
go take your test.  And that would scare me.

B.120:  So, see it didn't use to bother me when I thought that, you know, if I come
in there and they say, okay you tested positive, now explain yourself, and I
could say, yeah, well I was around some people that were smoking pot, but I
wasn't.  But, you know, it's the idea that,

A.121:  How can you prove it?   

B.122:  You can't, but, at least you've got a chance, whereas if they say for six
weeks you don't have a job because you tested positive, that, you know,
that's, that's devastating.  How, you know, I can't live without my income for
six weeks.  There's no way.

A.123:  No, not many people could.  I go paycheck to paycheck, 

B.124:  Exactly. 

A.125:  barely.  So,

B.126:  So, I don't know.   

A.127:  Well, this has been interesting.   

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  But, 

B.130:  Opposing viewpoints there.    

A.131:  Huh?   

B.132:  I said opposing viewpoints.   

A.133:  Sort, well, sort of.  I mean, I, I agree with a lot of what you said.
