==========================================================================

A.1:  So, what kind of garden do you have?

B.2:  Uh, we have a vegetable garden with a, we have some onions, potatoes,

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  uh, broccoli, spinach, lettuce,  

A.5:  Um.  That's n-, {very faint}.

B.6:  radishes.   

A.7:  Nice little garden.

B.8:  Yeah, we, he p-, we plant quite a bit, and we have the, you know, peach
tree and a plum tree and so, 

A.9:  Oh, do you get, get a good crop of plums?

B.10:  Uh, well, we just planted the plum tree this year so we haven't, uh --

A.11:  Oh, hadn't gotten any.

B.12:  -- haven't gotten anything off of that.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  Hopefully this will be the first year for our peaches.

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  We're hoping to get something off of that so, 

A.17:  Yeah, sounds nice.  I used it, we, we had some wild plum trees growing in a
field,

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  when I was a, near my house when I was a kid.  We used to go out there
and raid it.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  It was great.  Love plums.

B.22:  Yeah.  We, uh, I, I love plums and peach, I just love all fruit, you know.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  And it's hard to come, you know, the, I don't know the fruit we get down
here at the store has just been pretty lousy lately, so [noise] {sounds like
banging},

A.25:  Yeah, it's, same around here, too.

B.26:  Yeah, it's like,

A.27:  Makes you wonder what they're, what they're sending out.  I mean,

B.28:  Yeah, like where does all the good stuff go.

A.29:  Yeah, where is it.

B.30:  Yeah, where is it, I know they have to grow some of it.

A.31:  Because certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff,

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I mean, they use the junk for that.  It makes me wonder -- 

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- gosh, if they're using junk for that, what are we getting here.

B.36:  What are we, [breathing] yeah, yeah.  What's in the juice [laughter].

A.37:  Really.

B.38:  This is what I would put in juice.

A.39:  Yeah.  I, I've gotten to where I won't even buy juices anymore because I'm
afraid of what's in there.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  That's so true.  Yeah.

A.41:  Well, I don't do very much gardening.  I, I would like to, but I just
don't,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  have the time to do it,  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  or keep it up right.  I, I try to get into some flowers and stuff --

B.46:  Uh-huh.   

A.47:  -- I just placed an order again for some bulbs and --  

B.48:  Uh-huh.   

A.49:  -- waiting for those to show up and,

B.50:  Yeah, we got some bulbs, but we haven't gotten them planted, uh, my
husband's, uh, been growing, uh, lots of flowers from seed and,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  all of his own plants under a, a light he put out in the garage --

A.53:  Uh-huh.   

B.54:  -- to help keep them, you know, alive --  

A.55:  Uh-huh.   

B.56:  -- and get them a good start, so --  

A.57:  Well, I started,  

B.58:  -- we hope we have a lot of flowers this year.   

A.59:  Yeah, I started some about, uh, about a month ago, 

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to
them and,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  that was the end of them.   

B.64:  Oh, yeah, we don't have any pets so,  

A.65:  Yeah, these two cats, it's hard to keep anything around.   

B.66:  [Laughter] yeah, like my husband says we just have two kids, it's hard to
keep them out of things, let alone pets.

A.67:  Yeah, really.   

B.68:  [Laughter].   

A.69:  These, these cats are just about as bad as kids.   

B.70:  [Laughter].   

A.71:  I've got one that can even open the cupboard doors and get in, inside the
cabinets.

B.72:  Oh, no.   

A.73:  Yeah, she,  

B.74:  That's no fun.   

A.75:  Yeah, she's got it wired now.  She jumps up on the counter and stands up,

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  reaches up for the door and pulls on it till it opens and then jumps up
in there.

B.78:  Oh, you ought to, you ought to send a t-, videotape that and send it into
AMERICA'S (( )) {faint}.

A.79:  I know.   

B.80:  HOME VIDEOS. 

A.81:  I, I've been seeing all these weird things they send in, and,

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  I, uh, I says gee, I ought to get that.   

B.84:  That's right, you, you know, that could be worth ten thousand dollars 
so,

A.85:  You never know.   

B.86:  That's right [laughter].   

A.87:  Kitty cat, what do you think about being a star [laughter].

B.88:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.89:  I'll buy you, buy you lots of cat food with that [laughter].

B.90:  That's right, you can buy lots of cat food with that so,  

A.91:  Yeah, you believe that [laughter].   

B.92:  Or hire somebody to do your lawn, so then you don't have to worry about it.
We have a big problem around here with insect problems.

A.93:  Oh, yeah.   

B.94:  You know, fire ants and,   

A.95:  Yeah.   

B.96:  So that's, it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you're
always, you know, buying the fertilizer and the, you know, the bug killers,

A.97:  Yeah,

B.98:  and weed killers.   

A.99:  and all that stuff. 

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  Well, I'm, I'm pretty easy as far as yard work.  I'll go out there and cut
it,

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  and I'll edge it, if it dies, it dies [laughter].   

B.104:  Uh-huh.  Oh, my husband just has to have it green.  Has to be green.

A.105:  No, I, uh,  

B.106:  It's,

A.107:  I'll take my chances with it.   

B.108:  [Laughter].   

A.109:  Course, now, where I, where I'm at now, I don't have to worry about the
lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it.

B.110:  Oh, that's nice.   

A.111:  It is nice.  He, matter of fact he was here today.  It was the first really
warm weather we've had.

B.112:  Uh-huh.   

A.113:  And he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that.

B.114:  Yeah, well, we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out,
you know, in their front yards doing their yard and,

A.115:  Yeah.  I guess, I, 

B.116:  It's a perfect day for it.

A.117:  I guess we're really into spring now.   

B.118:  Yeah, I, I love spring.  I just love it.   

A.119:  I don't, I like winter.   

B.120:  Do you?  Oh, not me.   

A.121:  Yeah, I li-, I like cold, dreary weather.   

B.122:  Oh, I don't.   

A.123:  Yeah, I,  

B.124:  I,

A.125:  it, it's, 

B.126:  I grew up in Wyoming and it's cold enough there for me so, 

A.127:  Uh-uh, no, I gosh I got use to it when I lived in South Dakota.

B.128:  Uh-huh.   

A.129:  It's just great up there.   

B.130:  Oh, do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina?

A.131:  No, this is another one of those winters that wasn't.   

B.132:  Oh, winter that wasn't, oh.   

A.133:  Yeah, it's, I don't know I was expecting snow and all of that.

B.134:  [Laughter].   

A.135:  I, maybe I should have moved over to the mountains instead of here.

B.136:  Uh-huh.   

A.137:  But, uh,  

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  they didn't get a lot of snow in the mountains either.   

B.140:  No, talking to my folks in Wyoming they, uh, they were still hoping they
get some more, because if they don't they're going to have water problems this
summer so, 

A.141:  Yeah, yeah, that was a big problem was I was in South Dakota.  Course, we'd
had plenty of snow --

B.142:  Uh-huh.   

A.143:  -- but, uh, every once in a while, they, they get shorted on the snow and
the water supply starts drying up.

B.144:  That's right.  They need the, the snow for the water so,  

A.145:  Because those, I mean those, those summers up there are brutal.

B.146:  Uh-huh.   

A.147:  Terrible.  You get those, uh, Chinook winds coming across the prairies, 
and --

B.148:  And just dries everything out.   

A.149:  -- golly, it's, it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there.

B.150:  Uh-huh.   

A.151:  But I enjoy it.  Gosh I, I, I haven't been anywhere where the weather was
so tremendously great for me.

B.152:  Oh, well it sounds like you need to move back there.   

A.153:  Yeah, I, I've been thinking about it.   

B.154:  [Laughter].   

A.155:  Only problem is, I, I would be very limited in any job opportunities out
there.

B.156:  Yeah, that's, that's it.  We'd like to be closer to family, but limits the
job [child_talking] your welcome, Brittany {speaking to someone else in the
room}.

A.157:  Yeah.  The, uh, I mean there's still basically ranchers and farmers up
there, you know.

B.158:  Yeah, but it's hard to make it being a rancher or farmer.  

A.159:  Yeah.  I,  

B.160:  What, Brittany?  Okay, good hon {speaker is talking to child}.  Sorry,
[laughter].

A.161:  That's all right.  That's just another one wanting to get in on the
conversation.

B.162:  Oh, yeah.  She, she was wanting,  

A.163:  Oh, I meant to ask you, can you hear me okay on this thing. 

B.164:  Uh-huh.   

A.165:  Okay, good.   

B.166:  Yeah, I hear you just fine.   

A.167:  It's a, it's a, it's a headset.  So,  

B.168:  Oh.

A.169:  it makes it a little easier.   

B.170:  Yeah.  You doing lots of these calls?   

A.171:  Oh,   

B.172:  You work for T I?   

A.173:  No, I don't.   

B.174:  Oh. 

A.175:  I'm a, I'm a student, uh, uh,

B.176:  Oh, okay.  My husband works for T I.   

A.177:  Just about everybody I've talked to has been with T I.   

B.178:  Uh-huh.   

A.179:  I guess that's, I guess that's the same with your husband.  

B.180:  Yeah, he works for them right now.  He's been there almost six years now.

A.181:  Yeah.  I had a, I had an interesting call about, uh, two weeks ago.  Uh,
came in late, too, it was like eleven thirty at night.

B.182:  Oh, wow.   

A.183:  And, I answered it and I said, yeah, well, you know, I'm not doing
anything, so I took it and the subject was, discuss the weather,

B.184:  [Laughter].

A.185:  and find out how your weather compares to the caller's weather.

B.186:  I had one of those, too.   

A.187:  Well,  

B.188:  It was a weather phone call, yeah.

A.189:  the interesting thing was, this was from another student at state right
across town from me.

B.190:  Oh.  

A.191:  [Laughter].   

B.192:  [Laughter] Oh, well, you really kind of have the same kind of weather.

A.193:  I mean, yeah, gosh, what's your weather like, you know. 

B.194:  [Laughter]. 

A.195:  Well, I don't know, let me look out my window.  Yeah, it's kind of foggy
tonight [laughter].

B.196:  [Laughter] I had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were
out of their house because of the --

A.197:  Oh, that ice storm.   

B.198:  -- ice storm.   

A.199:  Yeah.   

B.200:  Yeah, they were living with families that would take them in and,

A.201:  Yeah, I talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester --

B.202:  Uh-huh.   

A.203:  -- and same story.  They, uh, they really had a lot of damage from, uh,

B.204:  Yeah.

A.205:  ice and all that.   

B.206:  Yeah.  They couldn't even be in the house because they had no, power,

A.207:  Yeah.

B.208:  and everything.   

A.209:  Yeah, that's pretty bad.   

B.210:  Yeah, and here we were, I mean I talked to her, we had just gotten over a
ninety-four degree day so, 

A.211:  Oh.  

B.212:  [Laughter] we really had a lot to compare so,    

A.213:  Oh.  Sounds like that young one wants some attention.   

B.214:  Oh, I, she's talking to my husband, I think so,    

A.215:  Oh, oh, that's okay [laughter].   

B.216:  Yeah, so, 

A.217:  Yeah, Rochester's a nice town, too.  They, they said that they had, had,
uh, lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out.

B.218:  Oh, yeah.  That's what she said, they,  

A.219:  That's too bad, because I,

B.220:  they were going to ha-, the governor was going to try to have it declared
a disaster area.

A.221:  Yeah, yeah.   

B.222:  What {speaker talking to child}. 

A.223:  That's too bad because I, I, I had a, an old, an ex-professor who, uh, is
up there in Rochester and he told me about how much they had worked to
beautify the place.

B.224:  Uh-huh.   

A.225:  And all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff.  Now
it's all been wiped out.

B.226:  Oh [breathing]. 

A.227:  It's a shame.   

B.228:  Yeah, it really is.   

A.229:  Oh, well.  Such is life.

B.230:  Yeah, it seems like you work hard and something else goes wrong.

A.231:  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, 

B.232:  Nothing's forever, I guess.

A.233:  me with gardens.  I can go out there and plant a garden and then watch
the bugs and,

B.234:  Oh, that's what it is with us, too, you just like, get so frustrated, you
get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs.

A.235:  Uh-huh, you get a, get a frost or,

B.236:  Uh-huh.

A.237:  something.   

B.238:  Or hail [laughter].   

A.239:  Hail, that's even better.   

B.240:  Yeah, it just, you know.   

A.241:  Yeah, my, the only, the only thing I ever accomplished, I, I mean, I've had
gardens for a long, long time.  When I was a kid, I started, uh, I had some
squash and tomatoes and watermelons.

B.242:  Uh-huh.   

A.243:  And I grew a thirty-four and a half pound watermelon.   

B.244:  Oh, my word.   

A.245:  Yeah, absolutely tasteless.   

B.246:  Oh, was it. 

A.247:  Had no taste whatsoever.   

B.248:  We tr-, grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were, just tasteless.

A.249:  Uh-huh.   

B.250:  You couldn't even eat them.   

A.251:  Cantaloupe's difficult to grow and get taste out of them.  

B.252:  Yeah.   

A.253:  I mean they're, they're easy enough, they'll grow easy enough,

B.254:  Uh-huh.

A.255:  but you can't get any flavor.   

B.256:  Yeah, yeah.  You have to be so careful when you buy at the stores.

A.257:  Yeah.  I, I buy them every once in a while and, and I bought one and it
was, you know, blah,

B.258:  Uh-huh.

A.259:  and then I said, well, I'll try another one, so this is several weeks
later, and I bought another one and it was just as sweet,

B.260:  Uh-huh.

A.261:  and wonderful.   

B.262:  Yeah.   

A.263:  But you never know.   

B.264:  Nope you don't.  It's hard to pick them.   

A.265:  Uh-huh.  It's like oranges and everything else.   

B.266:  Oh, yeah.   

A.267:  But, anyway.   

B.268:  The oranges here look disgusting so,    

A.269:  Oh, yeah, they look terrible here.   

B.270:  So, 

A.271:  I look at those thing, I say, I wouldn't buy them.  Not even to squeeze for
orange juice.

B.272:  Yeah, they're all,
