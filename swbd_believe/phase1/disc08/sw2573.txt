============================================================================

A.1:  Alright, what do you think about it?  Like, well, you can go first.

B.2:  Well, uh, I guess, uh, I hadn't, hadn't had a lot of time to think about
voters [noise] but, uh,

A.3:  Wow, I dropped the phone [laughter].  

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  That was loud, sorry.

B.6:  Uh, I guess, uh, voter apathy, of course, i-, is, uh, is a universal thing,
uh, not just, I don't think just United States, really.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  I think other places have the same problem.  And, it's basically because
the voters don't really feel like that their vote really has any influence on
the outcome, not just of the election, but of the results of the election.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  The, uh, the congressman, and the senators, and you know, the legislators,
don't really do, uh, most of the time, what the, what the, their constituents
really want them to do.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, they do what they think is either best for the, you know, the, the, uh,
economy or whatever is best for the people that are, the lobbyists that are
paying, you know, part of their way,

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  and, an-, and I think it's, you know, the voters don't feel like they
really have as much say-so in the government as, uh, they would like to have,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  so they, they kind of drift away because of that.

A.17:  Really.  I think that that's a big part of it.  I think that's probably the
root, and then also, that added with all the pressures on the American family
today.  It's a real, it's a real pain for us to go vote.  I mean,

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  I remember the last time that we had to go vote, it was like, man, just to
get up there and do it was major effort, you know.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  And we ran in there, it was like right at seven and my husband had worked
late, and I was going to go, we wanted to go together to do it and take our
son, but it was like, we ran in and whew, we were the last people in there,
and I thought, you know, Kyle gets off usually about, oh, by five, but we live
in Tarrant County, and he drives from Dallas, so you know, it's a drive, but
he still had a lot more cushion to be able to go vote a lot easier than most
people,

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  you know what I mean?  And, because he doesn't hit the North Dallas traffic
and all, then, he might have worked an hour late, it was just like ah, we had
so many things to do, and we just couldn't get them done, and I, I remember us
thinking that, man, it, I'm a Christian and I really feel like we have a
responsibility to vote, but I tell you what, if I wasn't a Christian, I would,
there's no way I would have gone to vote,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  just because of the pressures, the, you know, just the time factor, and
just the, anyway, and I felt like I was listening to Dobson this morning, and
I, I guess I even thought that then, this morning, so it's funny I got this
topic, because there were talking about how the Congress, it pays the Congress
to make, you know, legislation that encourages women to work outside the home
because, then you have two people you can tax,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  and you d-, put both of those people in a higher bracket, and that it's
probably not going to end anytime soon, the pressure, you know, to work, and
just the pressure it puts on the American family, and, um, I pro-, I thought
about that, and I said, yeah, that's funny, you ((hardly)) have time to go
vote for this Congressman, because, you know, women are expected to do so much
now,

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  and I just kind of laughed, and I thought, God, I never thought of it like
that, you know.

B.30:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

A.31:  So, anyway, I think that's the other side, that, 

B.32:  I think that's, that's a good observation, a-, and true, yes.  Uh,

A.33:  Yeah, but I agree, too, with what everything you said, but I think the two
g-, and then you put those two things together, and you're going to have, you
know, no one going to vote but then, um, I don't know, disillusion, what's
the solution?

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  Oh, what's the solution?  Huh.

A.37:  I know, now come on [laughter].

B.38:  Start over again.  You know, that's, we've, the people have talked, you
know, about hav-, about redoing the Constitution completely, or changing the
government a little, you know, to some extent.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And I think that's a, you know, we really ought to take a long hard look
at, at the system, and, and see if there's a way to improve it, not just say
that's the way it is, or it's been that way for two hundred years.  Let's, you
know see if there are some, some improvements.

A.41:  But I think that,

B.42:  Uh, not a, not a change, but some improvements.  I think the system itself,
basic system is, is, uh, appropriate.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  But I think there are some, some modifications even, that could be made,
uh.  Limitations on Congress, and r-, you know, restrictions that could be put
on, on the government itself.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's --

B.46:  To get them out of our everyday life.

A.47:  -- yeah, I know, they're, I know, you can't even spank your children these
days without, you know,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  with this, you know, I don't know.  

B.50:  I,

A.51:  We don't have, we don't have a little child, but I know that when you go in
a restaurant, we had some foster twins and, it was last year, and it wasn't
through the state, but boy, howdy, man, these kids needed a whipping
sometimes,

B.52:  Yeah, gi-,

A.53:  not to be beaten, not to be abused, but to firmly be told you are not going
to do that,

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  and you are not going to spit in my face, I said no, and if you do that,
this is going to be the consequence.  But, uh, you couldn't do that, even
through the state, even the m-, it wasn't through the state, but even though,
um, the mother really, would given approval, but because of the situation, we
just didn't think it was wisdom.  You know, you go in a restaurant and they
start spitting their food out at the table, now come on.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  But, you know, you couldn't do really a lot, because of the state's
control, so, that's, that's a good idea, there too, I like that but,

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  Anyway, you know, have you ever had a two year olds twins start spitting
their food at you at Luby's, 

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  you know, I mean, you're like going, I mean y-,

B.62:  I remember, our, our, our daughter's twenty-five,

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  and I remember when she was at, you know, at that age, and, and how she
was, and that, that's exactly, of course there was only one of her, it wasn't
twins,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  but that's exactly the, you know, the way it was.  And of course,
twenty-five years ago you could, you could, uh, you could --

A.67:  You could go in the bathroom at Luby's and take care of it.

B.68:  -- yeah, you could, could, uh,

A.69:  Yeah, I did, I stood there, and I did take care of it.  It took forever
though, and I think God just had some grace there, because I don't think n-,
if it had been my child, I don't think that would have worked, what I did in
order to get them to eat that food, you know?

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  But it took like twenty-five minutes, but it was, the whole thing was the
state.  But I don't want to rewrite the Constitution, I just wish people, I
wish it would be interpreted like the founding fathers wrote it to be
interpreted by,

B.72:  Uh-huh, right.

A.73:  and that they would begin to teach it, in the s-,

B.74:  Yeah, I guess the, the Constitution is not the part that needs to be
changed,

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  it's the, it's the rest of it, you know, the,

A.77:  Our society is so messed up, though, it's like, no wonder they interpret it
wrong.  We were in Dallas last night, and we ate dinner at Meadow Road and
Seventy-five, at a restaurant there,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  and I couldn't believe it.  It was like, this kid was like SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE.  We were the only normal seeming human people in the whole place almost.

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  And, I'm not kidding, and it's like these, it's this, it, this, I told
Kyle, I said, if this is reflective of our society, no wonder we are in such a
mess and,

B.82:  Yeah, well, it's,

A.83:  you know, 

B.84:  there are some, some strange things,

A.85:  these were the rich people, these were the, you know, these were, I mean,
just the things that happened, we had a bulimic in front of us, she just
looked crazy, but yet she had money. And, um, she was j-, 
so friendly, and I asked the manager as we checked
out, I said is that lady a ballerina or what, and he goes, he said, no, she's
a bulimic.

B.86:  Um.

A.87:  Because she was so skinny.  

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  And then, all these other people are coming up around us and, uh, this one
man, they went to check on their ticket, and the other man at their table
started taking their plates and, and in fear, just piling their food on his
plate and shoving it in his mouth.  I mean this was in one night, and I was
just sitting there thinking, now --

B.90:  You're, uh, you're kidding [laughter].

A.91:  -- I, he did! It's like (( )),

B.92:  You mean, it's, that, at a, like a st-, a total stranger?

A.93:  N-, uh, no, he was sitting at the table with them, another couple.

B.94:  Oh, he was sitting at the table with them?

A.95:  Right, but he took their plates up and made sure they didn't see him.  And
I think he was the one, I heard him mention about the tickets were messed up,
so they went to take care of the tickets, he took their plates and began
eating his f-, eating their food.

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  I'm not kidding, my husband was like, totally freaking out.  He said, I
can't believe it, look at that.

B.98:  [Laughter].

A.99:  But, and I, you know what I mean, i-, they were right next to us and it was
obvious that they didn't know, and so,

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  and he ate it all before they got back, and everything, and so, I just
thought, no, I don't know if there's an answer to the people not going to
vote.

B.102:  Yes.

A.103:  When they s-, when our society is falling apart like it is, 

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  I don't know if people,

B.106:  Maybe we don't want those people voting [laughter].

A.107:  I know.  Yeah, I know, and they, you know, these are probably some of the
lobbyists in Washington.  I can't help but think that, either.

B.108:  Yeah, yeah, that's, that's,

A.109:  Is it, no, seriously, because these were, this was a nice, North Dallas,
this was not,

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  we weren't over on Cedar Springs or Harry Hines or anything, you
know?

B.112:  Yeah, that's, uh,

A.113:  So anyway, 

B.114:  that's,

A.115:  I think our society is just worse off than I realized, that's what I felt
--

B.116:  I'm going to have to start going out to eat more often, I d-, I guess I
would like to see some things like that.

A.117:  -- we live in Euless, now, we don't see that in Euless too much, but,
you know, that's  what it, I mean it was just absolutely, maybe it was
just that night, right?

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  But I don't think so.

B.120:  A full moon last night, or something.

A.121:  I have a feeling that's more reflective of our government and everything,
then,

B.122:  Yeah, well, that's our time.

A.123:  Well, there's your another call.  Well I think we had a good call.  And so,

B.124:  Okay, yeah I enjoyed it.  Thank you.

A.125:  Okay, have a good day. Bye.
