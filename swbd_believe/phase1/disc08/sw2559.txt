@A.1:  Well, on this subject of invasion of privacy, yes, it's very easy for
anybody to find out about you.  Your,

B.2:  Well, I don't really like that very much. 

A.3:  Yeah, uh, the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast, I think, last
week or so ago, it detailed how this one person went about finding out this
particular pers-, from this particular person his home mortgage, how much he
pays for it, what his payments are, uh, his, uh, Social Security number,
driver's license, any kind of records he may have.  Uh, their credit card and
the status of their credit. 

B.4:  What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff?

A.5:  It was just as a demonstration to show --

B.6:  Oh. 

A.7:  -- those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any
single person.  And it was, mostly it dealt with, uh, marketing companies,
these, uh, direct marketing,

B.8:  # Oh, yeah.# 

A.9:  # associations.  #

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  That was the primary subject.  That's how they obtain information about
segments of society and group them into age brackets, uh, their habits, their
hobbies, their income. 

B.12:  Um. 

A.13:  And they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer. 

B.14:  Well, that, that's not really good.  I don't know, I guess that's an
invasion of privacy.  I'm not sure that that's an everyday thing, though, at
least not for, you know, an individual. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  Something that I feel is a, is a, pretty much an invasion of privacy is
something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now, is the
op-, the open office concept. 

A.17:  The open office?

B.18:  Uh-huh, where they have the, you know, the little partition dividers,

A.19:  # Yeah.  #

B.20:  # throughout # a, a large room and, and people have little cubicles.  Well,
that's all fine and good, but you don't really have any privacy at all. 

A.21:  Not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody, I suppose, because
it, you can easily be overhear-, overheard --

B.22:  Right. 

A.23:  -- and they get, I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily
seen. 

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  Yeah, there's, there is,

B.26:  And, and it's not, it's not just that, it's, uh, the whole thing about, you
know, if, if you're trying to concentrate, well, it's rather hard, sometimes
it's almost impossible to do --

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  -- because, um, you know, you're, uh, you're ((time)), you're space is, is
not your own space. 

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  And I work in a situation like that and I, I really kind of have a problem
with that. 

A.31:  Do you work with, uh, mixed company, male and female or,

B.32:  Oh, yeah.  Is there anybody who doesn't?

A.33:  Well, there are a few out there. 

B.34:  Um. 

A.35:  It's, I suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at. 

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  But, um, my own environment is open totally.  There are no cubicles.
There's nothing to block anything.

B.38:  Um. 

A.39:  So, yeah, but, um, I guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of
communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record,

B.40:  # Yeah.  #

A.41:  # or # the computers, the, the big advent of that, I believe, because it,
they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is
touch a button and it appears --

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  -- in front of them, and you don't have to, I, I know the government sells
information to private companies about individuals or families. 

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  That's no secret, and it shouldn't be that way I don't think. 

B.46:  Yeah, I don't, I don't think that's, that's quite right either. 

A.47:  I mean it's not really government for the people and by the people, I'll
tell you that. 

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  So,

B.50:  Hum, what do you think could be done about it?

A.51:  Uh, the only way it can change is, um, if, if everybody bands together.
It's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the
office.

B.52:  [Laughter]. 

A.53:  The only thing really that can be changed is for us to, everybody to say,
we've had enough of you, out you go.  But, uh, I don't see anything like that
to occur unless everybody bands together to do that.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  It has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done.  Um, I don't know,
it's, it's still a, a free, I suppose, country insofar as we're, we're able to
obtain information.  And I wouldn't be for total banning of, uh, all
information or, it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned
about.  But it's, it's hard to define --

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  -- uh, a lot of those boundaries. 

B.58:  It really is.  It's something that, something that I've just had a, a
dealing with is like a credit bureau. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  Well, they take, they take my name, which is a very common name, and my
last name is even more common --

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  -- and they [talking] {women's voices} they check that name against, uh,
their list and they find several.  And without even bothering to try to match
up any other information at all, they just report everything under that name.

A.63:  So you've received a lot of, uh, flack?

B.64:  They don't, they don't even check my Social Security number. 

A.65:  Um. 

B.66:  And companies are paying them good money to report accurately, and they're
not, they're so lazy.  They're just not doing it.  I mean they just find your
name and they match it up.

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  You know, and that just drives me crazy because they're, and then they
want, then, you know, to get it removed they say, well, you know, you have to
write this, write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them,
you know, and then it takes three weeks ((and all)). And I'm like, baloney.

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  You messed it up, you fix it. 

A.71:  Is that usually what you tell them in the letter?

B.72:  No, what I've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
--

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  -- like, uh, uh, recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts and
I don't.  So I called J C Penney and I said, uh, I just wanted to let you know
that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information
that you're providing to them.  And they say, uh-huh, because they really
don't want to pay for a service that's not being done properly either.

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  So then they can call the credit bureau and say, hey, you know, we're
paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job.

A.77:  Good idea. 

B.78:  So that's what I've taken to doing lately, and it seems to work pretty well
so far.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's good.  Uh, any other problems?

B.80:  Not that I can think of. 

@@A.81:  Yeah, [laughter]  I, I guess I've just about run out of,

B.82:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.83:  I, I can probably go on, but it's, it's, uh, I'm clouding up right now. 

B.84:  Oh, yeah, I probably better let you get back to work. 

A.85:  Well, it's nice talking to you. 

B.86:  Okay. 

A.87:  Maybe again. 

B.88:  All rightie. 

A.89:  Bye-bye. 

B.90:  Bye-bye.
