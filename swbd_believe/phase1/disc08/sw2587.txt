=============================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead. 

B.2:  Oh, um, uh, I usually don't get to hea-, hear any of the current events
probably until about the ten o'clock news. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Uh, you know, being, uh, I mean, by the time you get off work, go by and
pick up the, uh, baby from the baby sitter, it's, you know, after six and by
the time everything is settled in, it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on
anything.

A.5:  Yeah, I guess that's the way I am too.  I, sometimes I hear some things on,
on the radio. 

B.6:  Uh-huh, oh yeah. 

A.7:  I only get the newspaper on the weekends so [sigh], 

B.8:  Oh, uh-huh.  Oh, I don't even have, ge-, time to read the newspaper except
in passing,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # you # know, I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on.

A.11:  I,

B.12:  # But, uh, #

A.13:  # I guess # occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though.

B.14:  Yeah.  We have, uh, a news thing on the computer that, uh, that I'll, I'll
try to look at every day.

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  And, uh, it, it's pretty much headline news. 

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we loo-, look for anyway. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  But, uh.  I, do you think that the quality of the, uh, the, you know, the
news events that you get are, what do you think about it?

A.21:  Well I, I guess it's pretty good.  And, and like the Dallas area,

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # and # I, I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this,
there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,

B.24:  # Yeah.  #

A.25:  # borderline # at that. 

B.26:  Well, you know, there's a lot of competition in the media. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get
the best headlines.  And that they'll run a topic into the ground. 

A.29:  Yeah. 

B.30:  And, uh.  You know, they try to play public's opinion.  Which I think is
awful, because it usually works. 

A.31:  Uh-huh, true.  I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle
East. 

B.32:  Yes, uh-huh.  That, uh, l-, lots of new, uh, newsmen were created during
that so, it will be interesting to see what happens. 

A.33:  Uh-huh, true.  Trying to think what else is,

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  # Right.  #

A.37:  # is # current. 

B.38:  Uh, uh,

A.39:  Well, um, I don't know what to say [laughter]. 

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  Uh, that's a bad one, they, uh, looks like we're going to have an income
tax in Texas,

B.42:  Yeah, I hate to see that, but it's, uh, i-, that, you know, if what it's
going to take, well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our
federal income tax. 

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  But, uh, you know, but we need good schools.  Uh, we're more involved in
that now.  And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better
schools. 

A.45:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.46:  So,

A.47:  I would think they could find a better way to fund it though, but they
haven't for,

B.48:  No.  You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery. 

A.49:  Well, they're struggling with it. 

B.50:  Yeah.  I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.  I
mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state
income tax.  I mean, [laughter] probably would have paid the same amount but,
you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  True. 

B.52:  So,

A.53:  I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that. 

B.54:  No.  It'll be interesting to see what happens. 

A.55:  Trying to think what else is current. 

B.56:  I, you know, I haven't seen the news [laughter]  in a couple of days.  So
it, uh, I'm a little behind on things. 

A.57:  Well, the other thing I can think of is, uh, what is still going on in Iraq
--

B.58:  Yes, that's, that's sad. 

A.59:  -- and the Kurd refugees. 

B.60:  Yeah.  They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two,
two bad situations, and,

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # uh, # I don't know what I've would have done in the situation. 

A.63:  Yeah, it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,

B.64:  # Yeah.  #

A.65:  # finish # the job while we were in there. 

B.66:  Right.  But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and
uh, take sides.  I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.68:  # and # he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd
agree with it.  I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them
away. 

A.69:  Seems to have helped him though,

B.70:  # Yeah, it, it,#

A.71:  # popularity wise.  #

B.72:  it did a lot.  He did a real good job I believe.  I have, uh, in-laws that
live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too. 

A.73:  Hm. 

B.74:  It, uh, it, uh, you know, we, so we kept very much abreast of what was
going on.

A.75:  Yeah.  Were, were they in any of the areas where they,

B.76:  # Yeah, they were on #

A.77:  # some of the Scuds? #

B.78:  the, the, ne-, near, uh, Dahran. 

A.79:  Um. 

B.80:  On the,

A.81:  # Um-hum.  #

B.82:  # on # the wes-, east coast. 

A.83:  Yeah. 

B.84:  They were just north of it. 

A.85:  Um. 

B.86:  Probably about a hundred fifty miles, hundred miles from uh, the Kuwaiti
border.  Uh, and they stayed active was the, uh, the military there.  Taking
supplies out to them in the desert. 

A.87:  Uh-huh. 

B.88:  It was, it was a new situation. 

A.89:  Yeah.  I'll bet. 

@@B.90:  I don't really have much more to say [laughter]. 

A.91:  I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather and,

B.92:  You're right, and that's, that's awful in Texas [laughter]. 

A.93:  Have, have you all been getting rain storms down there?

B.94:  We got some awful rain, uh, the other morning.  And today's just been real
drizzly. 

A.95:  We did, we did last night.  Uh, some real massive thunderstorms. 

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  Apparently, I, I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small
tornadoes up this way too. 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  Caused some damage. 

B.100:  It did?

A.101:  We may get some more tonight. 

B.102:  Oh, well.  We, we've just got slight chances of rain.  But, uh, we had the,
we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning.  Course while everybody was
getting ready to go to work.  Making nice traffic jams.  So {faintly},

A.103:  Uh-huh.  Well the, the ground here is so flat, and it's all saturated now,

B.104:  # Oh {faintly}. #

A.105:  # we're getting # some flooding. 

B.106:  Right, uh, when was it, last week, we had all the rain? But, uh, we, I
think we had about eight inches.

A.107:  Hm. 

B.108:  It was between six and eight inches here where we are. 

A.109:  Goodness. 

B.110:  And, uh, it, you walk out on the ground, I mean you, I mean, it's awful. 
It's just so soggy. 

A.111:  Yeah.  It's a lot more humid down that way. 

B.112:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.113:  In fact, miserable. 

B.114:  Well, today it was, I mean, the air was just so sticky, so damp. 

A.115:  Yeah, I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they
got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just,

B.116:  # Goodness.  #

A.117:  # a # bunch.  Well, I guess that's it [laughter]. 

B.118:  [Laughter]  Right.  Well it's,

A.119:  That's about as much as we can do with current events. 

B.120:  Right.  Well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.121:  Good talking to you, Michelle. 

B.122:  All right.  Bye-bye. 

A.123:  Bye-bye.
