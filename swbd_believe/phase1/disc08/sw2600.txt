B.1:  So, what are the benefits working for a large organization?

A.2:  Gosh, I wouldn't know, I've never worked for a large organization. 

B.3:  Uh, that will make it interesting. 

A.4:  Well, I will take that back, I, I was in the Air Force for thirteen years,
I guess that qualifies as a large organization.

B.5:  Yeah, I, I would qualify the U S government as,

A.6:  [Laughter]. 

B.7:  Large, if not too large. 

A.8:  Sort of large.  Little bit, little bit bigger than T I. 

B.9:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.10:  Okay, I never really counted that as an organization because the,

B.11:  The benefits are funny. 

A.12:  Yeah, the benefits are strange.  They change every day and, uh, you don't
really have a lot of choice [laughter]. 

B.13:  Yeah. 

A.14:  Not like T I.  Do you want this, or do you want this, or do you want this?

B.15:  Well, we don't have that kind of choice either. 

A.16:  Um. 

B.17:  Yeah out here in the real world, it's all the same. 

A.18:  Oh, really. 

B.19:  No matter who your employer is. 

A.20:  No, I mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or some
other or something like that.

B.21:  Uh, yeah.  Here in the Springs, we have a choice of two, either an H M O or
a company,

A.22:  #Yeah.#

B.23:  #health# insurance. 

A.24:  Yeah. 

B.25:  So there are two. 

A.26:  Of course, I can't say we didn't have a choice, if you always wanted to,
you could, uh, go out and buy your health insurance.

B.27:  Out of your own jeans. 

A.28:  Yeah, out of your own jeans, and stay a way from the base hospital, which
is generally what I did.

B.29:  Uh. 

A.30:  It was scary. 

B.31:  It was that bad? Huh?

A.32:  Uh, I, I never fully trusted them.  The only time I ever went there was
when I had to for a flight physical or something.  Uh, which has to be their
doctor but they're not doing anything to me other than testing me so I let
them do that.

B.33:  Well, there are other benefits with the military. 

A.34:  Well I don't know. 

B.35:  That the civilians don't get. 

A.36:  Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't bad mouth the military too much.  I had a,
I had a good time.

B.37:  Well, I just meant from a benefit standpoint. 

A.38:  Well from benefit, well that's one of the reasons I made a decision to get
out, uh, I, what I perceived as the benefits were just eroding. 

B.39:  Yeah. 

A.40:  Uh. 

B.41:  Well, the, their pension plan is really good. 

A.42:  Yeah, you know that part is good except for the, except for the little
thing that you're paying into social security for twenty years and we.

B.43:  And then you can't draw it. 

A.44:  That's right.  And then, and then you start drawing your retirement pay and
if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for
dollar,

B.45:  #Yes.#

A.46:  #and# I always thought that that, that was a big ripoff.  Uh, but still. 

B.47:  Yeah, well, on the other side of the fence.  The way it works is some
employers, although they have a qualified pension plan, they don't have a
viable pension plan.

A.48:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.49:  And we won't mention any names. 

A.50:  [Laughter]  Don't worry they're recording every word. 

B.51:  I know.  I didn't say it was them. 

A.52:  You're right, you're right. 

B.53:  But I didn't say it wasn't either. 

A.54:  That's right. 

B.55:  We will let them draw their own conclusions. 

A.56:  That's right, draw your own inference. 

B.57:  Uh. 

A.58:  But, but, but what you are saying about the military times is, is true.  I
mean fifty percent, uh, of your base pay is pretty good. 

B.59:  And, uh, medical for the rest of your life. 

A.60:  Yeah, that, you know that sounds great on paper but it's not. 

B.61:  Well. 

A.62:  It's not something that I would look, would look forward to. 

B.63:  We have had some medical, I mean some military retirees work up here for us
or a bunch really, and they did use the heck out of the medical. 

A.64:  #Yeah.#

B.65:  #military# medical. 

A.66:  Yeah. 

B.67:  Now the military dental was poor. 

A.68:  Uh-huh. 

B.69:  At best. 

A.70:  Yeah. 

B.71:  But the medical seemed somewhat adequate. 

A.72:  Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong.  For something, something that was major
I, I wouldn't have any problems with them.  It's the daily, uh, go in with the,
with the flu or something like that.  And, and, the, the treatment is
terrible, I mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy
says you have a temperature, well I knew that.  I am going to give you
Sudafed.  You know I've been taking Sudafed for two weeks, it doesn't do any
good.

B.73:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.74:  That's all I can do, that's all I can do. 

B.75:  Yeah.  Uh, I'm a member of an H M O and, uh, from all indications, it's
quite similar to the military. 

A.76:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that, that's H M O's are designed that way.  I mean they
are going to,

B.77:  Yeah, exactly. 

A.78:  They're gonna they're gonna get the most bang for their buck, and, uh, you know, they're, they're in the big profit making business. 

B.79:  And so, the single benefits that I consider among the most important are
medical insurance. 

A.80:  Yeah, absolutely. 

B.81:  Because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life. 

A.82:  Forever and ever.  All, all you have to do is you don't have it, let
something bad happen and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast. 

B.83:  Yeah and. 

A.84:  They do it routinely. 

B.85:  Yes, and the funny thing is that, uh, private medical insurance grossly
expensive,

A.86:  #Oh, I know.#

B.87:  #if you are# not a member of a group. 

A.88:  I know.  My roomy's got insurance through the school. 

B.89:  Uh-huh. 

A.90:  And it runs fifty-eight, I think fifty-eight bucks a month something like
that and,

B.91:  #That's not bad.#

A.92:  #That's not bad.# But you don't get anything.  I mean to tell you. 

B.93:  Well, you get what you pay for, don't you?

A.94:  That's exactly right.  I mean, it's nothing.  Uh, it doesn't cover doctors
or anything else.  It's crazy. 

B.95:  Doesn't cover doctors?

A.96:  No, I mean it will cover something major but, forget about things like eyes
or your teeth or anything else.  What it is, it's medical insurance on paper. 

B.97:  Are you covered? Yes. 

A.98:  [Laughter] Yes that's. 

B.99:  Are you covered really? No. 

A.100:  [Laughter]  That's right.  Read between the lines.  Are you covered? No. 

B.101:  So. 

A.102:  But, you know, I mean the whole health care thing in the states is so
screwed up that, uh. 

B.103:  Yes.  It, it's a shame. 

A.104:  It is, it's totally ridiculous.  I'm one of those forty million Americans
running around with no health insurance at the moment. 

B.105:  In our state, currently, when, in Colorado whenever you fill out, uh, your
state income tax.  They ask you if you have medical insurance.  If you do, you
have to pay for those that don't have medical insurance. 

A.106:  Huh. 

B.107:  I think it's two or four dollars a person I don't remember, something along
those lines but, the still the idea irks me so that. 

A.108:  Well, it's sort of like North Carolina.  North Carolina has an interesting
thing on their income tax, uh, they create money to tax you with or to tax you
on.  There's a legal formula on the back that you have to complete and assuming
you're, you're, you're at poverty line where you're, uh, deduction or you take
the standard deduction of thirty-two fifty. 

B.109:  Right, right. 

A.110:  Uh, that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars tacked on to
your taxable income. 

B.111:  Oh, no. 

A.112:  And, of course, it goes higher and higher, the more money you make.  But
the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is
three hundred dollars.  And they create money out of thin air.  I, I attached
a little note to my, my return when I sent it in saying, Gee, I didn't know I
had this extra three hundred dollars.  I wonder where it went [laughter].

B.113:  Uh, Colorado is a nifty thing.  If you, or they did until last year, in
times past if you got a federal tax refund. 

A.114:  Uh-huh. 

B.115:  You paid state income tax,

A.116:  #On the refund.#

B.117:  #the next year.#

A.118:  Yeah, Alabama did that too.  And I always thought well, this is pretty
nifty, you taxed me when I made the money.  The Feds,

B.119:  #And now you're taxing me again on it.#

A.120:  #the Feds took it out and now# they're giving it back to me and now you're
going to tax it again. 

B.121:  #Yes.#  

A.122:  I s-, I seem to rec-, recall something about revolutions and wars about double
and triple taxation and stuff.

B.123:  Yeah. 

A.124:  Course uh course it it's the by word now I mean let let's tax everything three or four times.

B.125:  And there are tax revolutions going on currently. 

A.126:  There should be. 

B.127:  But the problem is, it's not an armed insurrection. 

A.128:  No. 

B.129:  It's not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington. 

A.130:  No because, because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic
about everything Washington can do what they want to do. 

B.131:  And they are trying to take away our guns. 

A.132:  Yeah that too.  I'm a lifelong member of the N R A, and I'm not as militant
as I was when I was younger, but I still firmly believe in the right to own and
bear arms. 

B.133:  And those people that say that, all that in the Constitution was
guaranteeing is that we will have a militia. 

A.134:  Yeah, that's garbage. 

B.135:  [breathing] I think they are sorely mistaken.

A.136:  They're they're wrong.  
The militia in those days was the common man.  There was no organization of
militia, the militia made up the everyday common man. 

B.137:  He pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard. 

A.138:  That's right, and, and if they said, Hey, we need a militia, then all the
able-bodied men were supposed to show up.
