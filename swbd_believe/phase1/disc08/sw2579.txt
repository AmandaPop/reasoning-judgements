A.1:  Well, good afternoon to you, Mary.  First,

B.2:  # And good, #

A.3:  # let me ask # you, what's, what's the weather like up there to begin with?

B.4:  Well, well, today, uh, when I got up it was twenty-nine degrees. 

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  [Laughter] Yes, and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon but
it's been cloudy, overcast and threatening rain all day.

A.7:  That sounds more like our winter weather down here. 

B.8:  [Laughter]  And we've also had extremely strong winds, fifteen to twenty
miles an hour,

A.9:  # Um.  #

B.10:  # for # the day. 

A.11:  Well, you know, I bet that's what we, that storm we had last night. 

B.12:  Is that right?

A.13:  Oh, we had a frog strangler go sw-, sweeping through here, uh, yesterday
and last night.  And we're expecting another one tonight.

B.14:  Oh, really?

A.15:  Oh, I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street. 

B.16:  [Laughter]  We had one of those two days ago. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  But not, uh, but, uh, no rain at all yesterday and, uh, no rain today. 

A.19:  Well, it's probably on its way up there.  It was heading north. 

B.20:  Thanks a lot [laughter]. 

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  Cu-, couldn't you send us some nice weather?

A.23:  Well, it was nice today. 

B.24:  Oh, was it?

A.25:  Uh, in between the thunder showers, yes. 

B.26:  [Laughter]  Well, the, one thing's for sure we can always discuss the
weather, how some ever we can't do very much to change it. 

A.27:  Well, you know, what they say about the weather here in Texas?

B.28:  What's that?

A.29:  If you, if you don't like it, wait five minutes, it'll change. 

B.30:  Oh, yes, well that's about the way our weather is here also. 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  W-,

B.32:  And I grew up in Saint Louis, and Saint Louis was much the same. 

A.33:  Uh-huh.  Well, tell me, uh, is, is it normally that cold up there in, in
the Spring?

B.34:  No, it's not.  This is, uh, about, uh, ten degrees cooler than usual.  But
about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty-five degrees. 

A.35:  You're kidding?

B.36:  No, no, it, uh, it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems. 

A.37:  You, are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open?

B.38:  [Laughter] I'm sure I didn't.  I was ready to turn on the air conditioning.
It, no, it really was extremely warm.  It only got down to about sixty-five in
the evening.

A.39:  Um-hum. 

B.40:  We had about three or four days of that, and then all of a sudden a cold
front came down and, uh, temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short
length of time.  And, uh, it has gone down gradually each day.  This morning it
was twenty-nine, yesterday it was about thirty-two.  Uh,

A.41:  # Oh.  #

B.42:  # cars # were scraping, ice off their cars this morning if they've been
sitting out all night.  So it,

A.43:  # Oh, Mother Macree.  #

B.44:  # it really wasn't # too, wasn't too pleasant [laughter]. 

A.45:  No, I should say not.  Well, I, I, sincerely hope that you don't have that
terrible storm we had. 

B.46:  # Oh, I  hope,#

A.47:  # I hope, #

B.48:  not. 

A.49:  it doesn't reach you up there. 

B.50:  Well, they are predicting rain and thunderstorms, and I wouldn't be a bit
surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had. 

A.51:  Well, I, let's hope it, well, i-, if it's the same as what we had, at least
it'll be warmer. 

B.52:  Uh, yeah.  [laughter]  Yes, warm rain, well, of course, by the time it gets
up here it may ru-, run into a cold front coming down from Canada. 

A.53:  Yeah, oh, boy, the, that, whew, that would be tear disastrous.  If you,

B.54:  # Yes.  #

A.55:  # had # that rain storm and freezing weather. 

B.56:  Yes. 

A.57:  Oh. 

B.58:  We had, uh, a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part
of the, uh, of the city of Dayton itself. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And, uh, then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in
less than an hour.  It was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal
of lightning. 

A.61:  Oh,

B.62:  # So, #

A.63:  # yes.  #

B.64:  it, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't conditions to being out in it and I had just
gotten home.  We had a lot of tornado warnings also.  And I had gotten home
shortly before that, uh, the rain started.  So, uh, I felt a little more secure
that I was at home rather than having to be out driving in it. 

A.65:  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, I heard on the news this morning that, um, one of our
local schools, uh, lost the roof of their gymnasium. 

B.66:  Is that right?

A.67:  And they suspected may have been a tornado. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  But, uh, uh, thank God for small favors, the, uh, uh, what do they call
them? The, the, the marching band or something?

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  Uh, uh, had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before. 

B.72:  Oh, they, that was, ca-, very, very fortunate for them because that could
have really been disastrous. 

A.73:  Oh, and how. 

B.74:  Well, of course this is tornado season, uh, in to, uh, we have many
tornadoes spawned in this area.  And northern Indiana, now we're in the
southwestern part of, uh, Ohio,

A.75:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.76:  # just # forty miles north, due north of Cincinnati, and, uh, but, uh,
northern Indiana, has many tornadoes come roaring across.  And we get the
backlash off of it, if not the part of the tornado itself. 

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  So, uh, we, you know, we get a lot of bad weather in this area.  But of
course you're supposed to be the sun belt, and I do know that you get some
freezing weather down there on occasion. 

A.79:  Oh, yeah.  Well, during the winter, yes, we do.  Uh, we've had, uh, well,
[sigh]  past four or five years, I guess, at least one day during the year when
just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain. 

B.80:  Um-hum. 

A.81:  And, uh, of course people down here, they just don't know how to handle
themselves and,

B.82:  Right.  Yes, I was going to say that it does make a difference when you're
not accustomed, to, uh,

A.83:  # Well, uh, #

B.84:  # having to, #

A.85:  not only that,

B.86:  drive in it. 

A.87:  but, we're, we're ee-, don't have the equipment to handle it either. 

B.88:  Right, right. 

A.89:  Uh,

B.90:  # And, #

A.91:  # they go # out there, and the, well all you can do with, with, uh,
freezing rain of course, is spr-, spread sand on the ice.

B.92:  Right. 

A.93:  And, but, uh, you know, we don't even have vehicles that will do that. 

B.94:  Um-hum. 

A.95:  They, they have to get, uh, a truck of sand and, uh, uh, four or five
laborers up there just spreading it by hand. 

B.96:  Right.  Well, uh, well here what they do and I, I contend that it's
certainly not the right thing to do, they spread salt.  And of course the salt
does melt the ice, but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes, uh, a
perpetual problem. 

A.97:  Well, and then to make matters worse, it destroys your vehicles too. 

B.98:  Oh, it sure does do that. 

A.99:  Yeah, they, well we, they do that down here too.  They mix the salt in with
the sand. 

B.100:  Well, sand, and, uh, but I have learned to do, is, uh, now that I am alone,
is, uh, to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car.  Um, not only in case I
need it for that for traction but for additional weight,

A.101:  # Yes.  #

B.102:  # in # the,

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  back of the car.  And then of course kitty litter is also excellent for
that.  I don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of,

A.105:  # Uh-huh.  I've, #

B.106:  # that but, # 

A.107:  no, I'm

B.108:  yeah. 

A.109:  a dog lover myself. 

B.110:  Well [laughter]. 

A.111:  [Laughter]. 

B.112:  Well, the dogs don't use litter.  But kitty litter is excellent for, uh,
getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction. 

A.113:  I guess it would be. 

B.114:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it, uh, works out, uh, really quite well.  Course I have, I
have a dog also.  My son brought me a little Lhasa Apso, uh, for my birthday
last Thanksgiving. 

A.115:  # Oh.  #

B.116:  # He # brought him from Dallas.  He,

A.117:  Oh, wasn't that nice of him?

B.118:  Yes, that, uh, he just thought I had been without a dog, uh, for three
years.  That was long enough. 

A.119:  # Uh, #

B.120:  # He, # he had,

A.121:  I have, uh, a, a Chowperd myself. 

B.122:  Oh, a what?

A.123:  A Chowperd. 

B.124:  Now that one I'm not familiar with. 

A.125:  Well, she's part Chow and part Shepherd. 

B.126:  Uh, okay. 

A.127:  [Laughter]. 

B.128:  Okay, that makes sense then [laughter]. 

A.129:  Uh-huh.  But she's the best,

B.130:  I believe,

A.131:  the best of both breeds. 

B.132:  Yes, right, well, I've always had big dogs before.  Never had a little dog
before. 

A.133:  Well, June,

B.134:  # And, #

A.135:  # is medium # sized. 

B.136:  Yes well,

A.137:  But she is scared to death of thunder storms. 

B.138:  Oh, well, I had a German shorthair that was frightened of storms.  The
minute it would begin to storm, he would just panic. 

A.139:  Uh-huh. 

B.140:  And, uh, I had to push him down when he was fourteen, and two months later
I had to put my yellow Lab down,

A.141:  # Oh.  #

B.142:  # because # he had leukemia.  And, uh, [sigh]  then, uh, then there was no
point in having all my acreage.  I had four and a half acres with game preserve
on three sides. 

A.143:  Oh, that must be nice. 

B.144:  Oh, well, it was great.  I loved it.  But then I didn't need all that
anymore, so I finally sold that, and I'm in a fair size condo.  And I have a
nice size patio. 

A.145:  Uh-huh. 

B.146:  And, uh, so this little dog has plenty of room to run. 

A.147:  Well, good. 

B.148:  Yeah, and he is a, a cutie and, uh, but I've never had a dog I had to keep
taking to the groomer's to have groomed either [laughter]. 

A.149:  No, well,

B.150:  # And it's, #

A.151:  # now, you # know, it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami
Beach somewhere. 

B.152:  [Laughter]. 

A.153:  Or better yet, down around Saint Petersburg, Florida. 

B.154:  Is that right?

A.155:  Uh-huh.  That's what I call home. 

B.156:  Oh, is that right?

A.157:  I lived there for ten years. 

B.158:  Oh, well I was there once way, way back in nineteen-sixty, I think for just
a week's vacation. 

A.159:  Uh-huh. 

B.160:  But, uh, I, that's about the only time I've been to Florida, except passing
through on the way to someplace else. 

A.161:  Yep. 

B.162:  # But, uh, #

A.163:  # Well, I lived # there in the seventies. 

B.164:  Uh-huh. 

A.165:  And, uh, I, I love it.  I have two sons still living down there. 

B.166:  Um-hum.  Well, uh, uh, most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in
Florida.  But, uh, I have just, that's just not been my thing.  We used to
always head west or head north.  Now that I'm alone why, uh, I, uh, prefer to
travel overseas if I'm going anywhere.

A.167:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.168:  And, uh, course there too you never know what the weather's going to be. 
When you,

A.169:  # Well, that's, #

B.170:  # start getting # over,

A.171:  that's

B.172:  to,

A.173:  why I was suggesting, uh, that Saint Petersburg is got, got to be the
finest weather in the world. 

B.174:  Oh, is that right?

A.175:  Oh, I, I loved it down there. 

B.176:  Um. 

A.177:  Course you could tell, always tell which were the, the na-, natives-

B.178:  # Yeah.  #

A.179:  # and # which ones were the snowbirds. 

B.180:  Oh, is that right?

A.181:  Yeah, the snowbirds were the,
