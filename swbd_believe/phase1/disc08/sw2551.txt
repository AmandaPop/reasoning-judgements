==========================================================================

A.1:  How are things in your area in that respect? 

B.2:  Well, um, starting with my work, um, we're in a, uh, aluminum can and paper
recycling, um, I work for T I and there's a, uh, a lot of paper that gets
thrown away here.  So we've started recycling our, uh, plain white paper.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And we have a, a company that collects it and takes care of tha-, that for
us.  Uh, in the community, um, Baltimore County, that I,

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  that's the county I used to live in, um, they just started experimenting
with, uh, trash pickup, where, uh, one day a week they pick up recycled items
and then another day a week they pick up the other trash.  And, uh, they've,
uh, contracted with a company here that has a special truck that has different
containers on the same truck, you know, one that holds paper, one that holds
plastic, one that holds tin, one that holds aluminum.  And, uh, so they've,
they've started experimenting with doing it, um, on a very large scale.  Also
in Baltimore City they've started doing it.  Uh, there's been a lot of
awareness, um, especially here on the East Coast because our landfills are,
you know, so filled now that, uh, there's just not enough room for all the
garbage that we, uh, that we create.

A.7:  I think we've all heard about the train load from New Jersey that couldn't
find a place to dump or something.

B.8:  That's right.  And the barge from New York,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  that went around the world and [laughter],

A.11:  [Laughter] until the garbage all rotted or something [throat_clearing].
We, uh, our town is just five thousand people and I've been very discouraged
by the local authorities dragging their heals about getting into a recycling
program.  Each politician who comes up from election promises that that's
going to be real high on his list of priorities, but it just doesn't seem to
be working out that way.  Uh, one of our local City Council members, who
happens to be a personal friend of ours, made the statement the other day that
there would always be landfills.  And we just sort of came unglued at that
point because if that's their thinking, then I think we're definitely in
trouble here.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Because there just cannot always be landfills.  Uh, my, we have always
saved aluminum, just absolutely forever, and, uh, I'm saving, uh, paper now
and glass.  Our biggest problem is that no one will take the paper.  It gets
really difficult to find someone.  In fact, now I'm donating it to a local
church, and by giving it to them, they take it at masse and then our junk
dealer gives them ten dollars just because they've, they're a church and he
writes it off as a donation.  But it's a real problem with, with the paper to
find that outlet for it after you've got it stacked up.

B.14:  Yeah, that's, uh, it's been a problem that I've noticed a lot in print,
that, uh, um, once you have collected this, what do you do with it, because
there's not a whole lot of companies that are taking it.  There's a lot of
people that want to participate --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and given the facilities will participate, and they've proven that time
and time again.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  And, uh, I was just reading some figures this morning that seventy-nine
percent of the people polled considered themselves to be environmentalists.

A.19:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.20:  And so, uh, you know, it looks like there's a lot of people there who want
to do it.  There's just not a lot of companies out there that know what to do
with it.

A.21:  Uh.

B.22:  Another problem that, that's, uh, is plastic milk cartons.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  They've got a way to recycle them.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  They've got places that can recycle them into products,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  no problem.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  The problem is that they can't, there's no facility to get it from the
people that have the raw material, the empty milk cartons --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- back to the guy who can do something with it.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And, uh, in order for this company to survive, they've had to, uh, in their
area, start sponsoring their own recycling centers --

A.35:  Uh.

B.36:  -- in order to get the raw goods.  But they, you know, of course they ca-,
they're limited with what they can do.

A.37:  Sure.

B.38:  They can only do so much.  And, uh, you know, it's, it's a matter of, I,
I don't think, you know, I hate to get government involved with anything,

A.39:  #I know, I know [laughter].#

B.40:  #because it always costs more money,# but, um, you know, it's a matter of
they're going to have to pass stricter laws,

A.41:  Uh.

B.42:  or start making the garbage collection, um, more costly.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And once they do that, then people will be more interested.  Right now it
doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road.  It's a flat fee a
month.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  If they started billing people by the pound --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- things might change drastically.

A.49:  As far as, well, that's one way to force them to recycle is that if they
bill them by the pound, then they're going to save it and not, not put it out
to the trash.

B.50:  That's right.

A.51:  Uh, we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the
roadsides when it starts costing people.  They simply take a bag and pitch,
pitch it into a ditch someplace.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Uh, my, my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is, is the tires,
what they're going to ever do with used tires.  My husband, uh, recently
retired after thirty-two years in a service station and, of course, originally
it was no big deal, you could get rid of them.  But now there's just simply no
way to get rid of these things.  And you see more and more of that around
about the country, where people have, have thrown a tire in the ditch or two
tires in the ditch and, 

B.54:  Well, actually there's a gentleman down in Atlanta who has invented a
process using a certain acid, and he can take a tire and turn it into
immediately burnable oil.

A.55:  Will the, will the E P A allow this? 

B.56:  It has less sulfur in it than processed fuel oil for the house.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  It does nothing to hurt the environment and the heat generated by the
process is in turn used to run the machine.  So it's self-sufficient --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and very efficient.  I mean, it, it control-, you know, it, it controls
its own process, it burns, it reduces the amount of fuel that's required in
order to get out the fuel at the other end.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Um, so far they've demonstrated it on a, uh, garage size unit that this guy
invented.  They're currently looking for funding to build a larger scale,

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  and I saw this about three months ago.

A.65:  A lot of these things can be placed in your area because of the density in
population, and yet they would be just frightfully expensive to put in our
area because of the scarcity of population.

B.66:  Well, if you think about it, if, um, uh, I remember that when they used to
take, uh, they used to pay you to take the tire, you know, get the, to turn in
your tire when you got your,

A.67:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.68:  and your, your husband probably remembers that better than I do.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  I remember there was a time when they'd give you one or two dollars for
your used tire.  Now they charge you two dollars for your used tire
[laughter].

A.71:  Right.  Well, he was at the point where if, if the customer did not want to
take the tire with them, he charged them a dollar to dispose of them, and
still there wasn't really a way to dispose of them.  This was just to sort of
encourage them to take them.  Uh, at one time not too long ago, uh, farmers
could use, uh, tires to start a fire burning fence rows,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  which, of course, was an air pollutant,

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  and they've put a stop to any open burning of any kind, and they are
fining people now.  I mean, it used to be the law was and no one enforced it,
but they are enforcing it now, and, and I'm glad they are.  However, one
solution presents another problem.

B.76:  Yes.

A.77:  Well, I would like, certainly like to see this, you know, if this is true
with this fellow in Atlanta.  It sounds wonderful.

B.78:  I saw it on the evening news and, um, the guy actually took the oil that
came out from the process in a measuring cup, turned around and poured it
right back into the, uh, tank --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- that he was using to fire the process in order to run it.

A.81:  Uh.

B.82:  And you actually, um, with this process, by putting in the tires, end up
with more energy from the oil --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- than you put into the process.  So it's a way of, of making a profit off
of the tires.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  And when you stop and look at the, you know, something like eight million
tires a month that are, you know, discarded --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- you know, there's a lot of tires out there that, that could go through
this process.

A.89:  Uh.  Well, I, you've certainly hit on the key to any of it.  Whatever we're
going to do, there has to be profit there, doesn't there?

B.90:  #There's not a profit,#

A.91:  #The fellow who# recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum, he's
got to be able to make a profit or he just isn't going to do it.

B.92:  I th-, the, the problem is that there's, there's always a payoff to
recycling but it's hard for people to see it.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  Because it's hard for them, it's hard to explain to someone that look, it's
costing us, you know, umpteen thousand dollars a year to bury this stuff in
the ground.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  And then what is the long-term effect of us burying that in the ground,

A.97:  It's costing us a lot more than money, isn't it? 

B.98:  if that stuff, yeah, it, it's going to leak into our water --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- and then we're going to have problems with our water,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  and then it's going to cause health problems,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  and so there is a long-term effect.

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  And when you stop and think about it, every, just about every single thing
that's produced can be recycled.

A.107:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.108:  I mean, if it's, if it's, uh, foo-, you know, if it's stuff you scraped off
your plate, it can go into the compost --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- and, you know, and so it's, I mean, it, there's a way to recycle
everything,

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  and, and, um, if your husband just retired, then I've got to believe that
you've got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars, hey,
recycling was the thing to do.  #I mean, you didn't,#

A.113:  #We didn't throw# away anything, did we [laughter]? 

B.114:  That's right.  If you, if you didn't recycle, you were un-American.

A.115:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.116:  And, and that was the bottom line.

A.117:  Well, we have to come to that now.  That's all there is to it.  You do see
a lot of positive things.  Uh, I saw a printout sheet the other day that I'm
going to, to copy and take to the girls at sorority {tape ends},
