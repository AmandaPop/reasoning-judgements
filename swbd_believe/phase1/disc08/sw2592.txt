==========================================================================

A.1:  There we go.  How, how many children do you have, Jackie?

B.2:  Well, I have two boys actually.  They're nine years old and, uh, five and a
half, actually, almost six now.  And they're in kindergarten and, uh, fourth
grade.  How about yourself?

A.3:  A, uh, oh, we've got, we've got three.  But,

B.4:  Okay.

A.5:  they're, they're kind of older children now.  Uh, we've got a daughter
twenty-three that's a senior in college,

B.6:  Oh my.

A.7:  a daughter, nineteen who's a freshman in college,

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  and a son, seventeen, who's a senior in high school.

B.10:  I see [laughter].

A.11:  What, what kind of activities do you do with them?

B.12:  Well, you now they're, especially the older one, uh, they, they're into,
their sports and their friends a lot.  You know, the younger one's getting
into it more.  Uh, what we enjoy doing with them, which we started a year ago
was, um, we go on fishing, you know, day time trips with them.  The younger
one, especially is really good at it.  [laughter] He enjoys fishing.  Uh, they
like to go to a place here called, uh, Chuckie Cheese, which is really like a
crazy arcade type,

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  of thing.  Has a lot of games.  Um, and we, you know, we like to do
outdoors types of things with them.  Um, I just got a bike myself, because I'm
hoping, you know, eventually, maybe, you know, for hikes or, you know, going
out along the canal area, or whatever to ride bikes with them.

A.15:  Oh, sure.

B.16:  And, um, you know, we enjoy, um, we enjoy doing more things outdoor.
Playing ball with them, my husband likes to play freeze tag with them.  And,
and I think, as American parents we probably, we spend more time than is
typical, I think, uh, with the kids.  And part of that is, that they're
demanding of it, you know [laughter].

A.17:  Oh, yeah.

B.18:  They, they want our time.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Uh, and, uh, my husband enjoys, you know, doing those things with them.  He
spends a lot of time with them.  And it seems to me, anyway, from observing
other families in the neighborhood, that he spends a lot more time, I'd say on
the average, than, um, a lot of the dads do here.  And I think that's good. I
think it's real important.

A.21:  I think, I think, uh, I think that is.  And, and we, we got involved really
in, in two ways.  Uh, my oldest daughter, I guess when she went, uh, was in
the first grade, brought home a note saying, uh, we're getting up a soccer
team.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And we're getting a chance to play soccer.  And, uh, so, gee, you know,
this was nineteen seventy-three, and none of us had ever seen a soccer game.
So then,

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  so then we go out and watch it, and she enjoys it.  And they play the
fall season and spring season, so she played two seasons in the first grade,
and was pretty good at it.  And then in the second grade, they said, uh, Oh,
the coach moved away.  Uh, call all the parents and say, Well, who's going to,
uh, coach.  Well, no,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  gee, you know [laughter].  Uh, well, we don't have enough time for that.

B.28:  Uh, oh [laughter].

A.29:  Then about the third call, they said, We want to know.  We're going to
refund the contracts and the money for these kids because nobody's going to
coach, and think that's terrible.  So at that point, you know, you come
forward.  Well that started about a fifteen year career,

B.30:  Oh, my,

A.31:  of coaching.

B.32:  goodness.

A.33:  Uh, coaching, administering programs.  And my wife and I, in addition to
coaching, I think when we finally finished up, we were managing, uh, this is
our volunteer time, managing a program with seventy-two hundred kids in it,
from grades, uh, kindergarten through twelfth grade.  And year around,
baseball, softball, soccer [laughter], 

B.34:  And I, I think that's really good though, because,

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  I'm sure those are memories they'll,

A.37:  Oh, there are.

B.38:  always keep.

A.39:  And, and, and, you know, my twenty three year old, she's a senior in
college.  And she comes in now, and she just loves to pick out the picture
book.  We took a lot of pictures at the time.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Dad, do you remember that sixth grade team we had that year, Dad?

B.42:  Yeah [laughter].

A.43:  God, we were great weren't we?  [laughter].

B.44:  That's right.  I, and I really, uh, I really think it's very important, and
I'm very sensitive to it, because I always felt that my parents are more, uh,
old school and they were older parents.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  And they didn't do a lot of things with us that way, and I always felt that
I missed out that way, and so I want to make sure that we spend a lot of time
doing activities with the kids.  And I think a lot of times the parents
[laughter] have fun as well.

A.47:  Oh, yeah.

B.48:  And, uh, you know, now that summer's coming. Of course, I'm sure in Dallas
it's already hot,

A.49:  Yeah, I'll say.

B.50:  but up here, well we've had, last weekend, we had eighty-seven, which
was,

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  extraordinarally hot for now.  But now we're back down to about fifty and
it's raining here.  But, uh, uh, you know, soon, next, end of next month, the
pools are open.  The outdoor pools,

A.53:  Yeah, oh, sure.

B.54:  only,

A.55:  That'll help.

B.56:  open over the summer.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  And that's an activity, that I, you know, take up with the kids.  And we're
starting to hit some tennis balls around.  Uh, but as, as they're getting more
fun for us as well, and I find that we're starting to doing more of those
types of things as they get a little bit older.  Um,

A.59:  Yeah but,  

B.60:  but, yeah, I was going to say, what do you feel in general, do you feel
that, uh, American families are spen-, spending enough time with their
children, or what changes do you? 

A.61:  Well, now I, I think that they're not, uh, uh, I see too many, uh, you, I
recognize that yes, a, a lot of families need two incomes.  In fact my wife's
working as we, the kids all start college.  And we're looking forward,

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  to the prospect of having three in there. Uh, they, they have to, uh,
both work.  But another activity that I found very rewarding, and I don't know
whether you've got it up there.  Are Indian Guides and Indian Princess
programs,

B.64:  No.

A.65:  popular in that area?

B.66:  No, no, I haven't heard of that.

A.67:  Okay, well what this is, is, it's, it's really sponsored by the Y, but it's
nonsectarian.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  Uh, is that it's the concept was that, I think it originally started with
Indian Guides, and, uh the idea was that dads are off working all the time and
mothers are left to raise the kids.

B.70:  I, see.

A.71:  So, uh, uh, it, it, it is a program that requires, uh, dads and ju-, and it
started out with, with fathers and sons.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Where they get together in what they call tribes.  Which is a neighborhood
with probably five or six, maybe up to eight, uh, father son combinations.

B.74:  I, see.

A.75:  And they get together and, and meet at each other's home, uh, maybe, uh,
twice a month.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Uh, to, uh, uh, have uh, uh, games and, uh, work on crafts and work on
projects, and,

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  and refreshments.  And you take Indian names and wear headbands and act
like in, and, uh, learn a little about Indian, uh, things.  But then, uh, the
highlight is that you go camping twice a year.

B.80:  Oh, I see.

A.81:  Like you go out to some, uh, camping spot and live outdoors, uh, in the
fall and in the spring.  And you, like you go out on a Friday night and come
back on Sunday morning.

B.82:  Oh, that's

A.83:  And it is,

B.84:  nice.

A.85:  to force the kids away from the mothers for a, a little bit.  And it's
even to the point where the host family, at the meetings at each other's
homes, have to pour-, uh, uh, have to provide refreshments and they've got to
be cooked by you, and you can't say, Mom, make some cookies for us.

B.86:  Oh, I,

A.87:  So part,

B.88:  see.

A.89:  of the thing is, when the father and son or father and daughter are
hosting this,

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  evening that, the week they have to plan it together.  What,

B.92:  Ye-.

A.93:  they're going to do when they're the host.  And what was interesting, I
got started in Indians and Princesses.  Now an offshoot to this was, I think
this program went on maybe for thirty years or so.

B.94:  I,

A.95:  And,

B.96:  see.

A.97:  somebody got to thinking, well it's even more important, it's even more
important for dads and daughters,

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  to get involved in something like this,

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  because a lot of families, think well, you know, I, I, I'll bring up the
son, mom, and you bring up the daughters.

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  And they don't notice the daughters until they're fourteen or fifteen and
start getting into trouble.

B.104:  Right, [laughter] yeah.

A.105:  So, uh, uh, because my son was the third one, I really got into it with
both of the girls first.

B.106:  I, see.

A.107:  And, uh, we just had a ton of fun.  And, I, I look back now, as I say, the,
the two girls are both in college.  But when they're here and we're, we're
talking about and we're digging out the old pictures books. And my twenty, we
took a lot of eight millimeter movies,

B.108:  Oh,

A.109:  of, uh,

B.110:  that's good.

A.111:  uh, Indian Princess camp.  And my, uh, uh, my, my twenty three year old
has, has hoarded all the movies.  And so,

B.112:  [Laughter].

A.113:  and, and just sets up the projector in her room and watches them, every
once in a while.  Uh, going back to things like that.  And, boy, those, these
are so many, precious things that,

B.114:  That's,

A.115:  you,

B.116:  right.

A.117:  can't ever buy back.

B.118:  That's,

A.119:  And,

B.120:  right.

A.121:  to answer your question.  Yeah, I, I don't see it.  We've got a lot of
younger families in our neighborhood, and everybody's so busy out there making
a living,

B.122:  Right.

A.123:  uh, you can see why the, well, I know uh, uh, my daughter who's a
freshman in college this year, her last couple of years in high school, she
made mo-, money baby-sitting.

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  And you can tell, by the number of people that would have her come and, and
spend the day.  Uh, my goodness, she went out on one job, she was only
seventeen.  I can't believe the lady gave it to her.  She said she interviewed
nineteen people and,

B.126:  Oh, my.

A.127:  she was the one she hired.  This was, uh, a three week old.

B.128:  Oh, boy.

A.129:  She went to the house at eight o'clock in the morning and, and both these,
uh, uh, there were, there was an only child,

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  and both parents were professional, uh, they were professional people.  I
think he,

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  was an engineer, and she was a computer programmer.  But she went to work
at eight o'clock in the morning, and Tracy would get there at seven thirty,

B.134:  Oh, my.

A.135:  and have complete charge of this, then three week old,

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  until the mother came home at, uh, at four or four thirty.

B.138:  Right, right.  Yeah, I think, and,

A.139:  And,

B.140:  I think that's, uh, uh, part of the problem now.

A.141:  Yeah.

B.142:  I was, uh, uh, I was in engineering myself. Um, right now, I'm taking, uh,
a year off.  But, uh, it was, it's very difficult, even when I worked, I
insisted on working thirty hours, not forty, so I was really considered part
time, and that,

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  was kind of difficult because that concept, when you get into professions
like that, isn't really there yet [laughter].

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  So, I really,

A.147:  Yeah, yeah.

B.148:  had to hound them for that.

A.149:  What, what kind of engineering,

B.150:  I was,

A.151:  were you in?

B.152:  a civil engineer.

A.153:  Oh, okay.

B.154:  And it was really important for me to be able to be out in time to swing by
the school and pick my son up.

A.155:  Uh-huh.

B.156:  And, of course, the younger one was in day care.  But, you find even
working six hours a day and not eight hours, or whatever, that it cuts into
your time so much.  And what happens, really, is that even though I had the
time with them in the evenings, all the things that, y- y- you know, normally
you can get done during the week, um, you save up for the weekend.  So your
whole weekend that your kids really want your attention, but you're saying,
Oh, can you go play now? or whatever because you have so many things to catch
up on.

A.157:  Yeah [laughter].

B.158:  And, I think that's what, you know, I think it really, uh, that's what
makes it very, makes it difficult.  And, uh, this year's much more relaxed
[laughter].

A.159:  Yeah.

B.160:  You know, and, um, a lot of people said they've seen very big changes in my
boys,

A.161:  Yeah.

B.162:  for the better, you know.  And, uh. I think that, you know, I've, I've
done both sides, and it's, it's no matter what people say, it, it is too
difficult ...
