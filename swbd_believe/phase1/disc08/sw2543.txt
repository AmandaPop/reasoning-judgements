========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what kind of music do you like? 

B.2:  Well, I, uh, several years ago [child] a radio broke in my car --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and I never, I got out of the habit of listening to the radio, and so I
haven't been listing, I, I used to just listen to the rock stations --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- but, um, [throat_clearing] lately I have been going back to classical
music.  I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are
unless, you know, they're in the, the news or something [talking].

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  But, um, so I tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular
back when I was paying attention.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And then I like some classical music --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and some of the pieces that have been around a while.  I haven't paid
much attention to most of the current music.  What about you?

A.13:  Um, I listen, I listen to a wide variety of music.  Sometimes I'll turn on
the classical music, [yelling] [talking] {man in background} sometimes I'll
listen to jazz,

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  uh, every now and then country and western.  Um, I'll listen to some of
the rock stations.  I also like the, uh, the, the classic rock stations,

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  that play the older, more mellow type rock music [talking] {man and child
in background}.  Um, some of the, some of the rock stations now are the, I
guess the top forty stations or whatever.  They just, it really gets on my
nerves because they play so many commercials and,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating
[laughter],

B.20:  That's true.

A.21:  and it gets kind of old, and they play the same songs over and over,

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  and I just get kind of tired of all that.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  So lots of times,

B.26:  [Throat_clearing].

A.27:  I'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio, actually.
But, uh, most of my cassettes, I guess, I don't, I don't like hard rock.

B.28:  No.

A.29:  Um, I have some, some rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two
country and western.  Some, uh, oh, I can't believe I can't think of his name.
Um, Garth Brooks,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  I have a couple of his tapes.

B.32:  [Throat_clearing].

A.33:  And, um, but it's mainly, it's mainly just the, the light rock type stuff.

B.34:  Yes, I don't, I never liked any of the heavy metal --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- music [laughter].  I never really listened to it because I, you know, I
prefer to have more, I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  But, and I, back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- it was kind of a novelty, and I listened to some of it,

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  but I, you know, now that there's just a million rap groups and,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  and, uh, they try to, tend to try to do, outdo each other with raciness,
I think,

A.45:  Oh, yeah.

B.46:  and, so I, you know, I'm not attracted to that at all, but, um, it made a
big difference in my life not to have a radio that was (( )) easy access, and
so now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.  But, you know,
if you go two or three years without having that, what I got the most exposure
to --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having a, you
know, easy access to current music, and so I did, like I say, tend to go back
to albums and --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- cassettes and things that I had, already had --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- purchased.  But we don't have a C D yet, do you?

A.55:  No, I don't.  I sure don't because I have so many albums and cassettes I
feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then
start collecting C D -s, and it just,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.

B.58:  Yeah, I, I kind of decided to wait until it, it was around a while.  It was
kind of like, remember when personal calculators first [laughter] came out,

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.

B.60:  and they were really, really expensive and then now you can get one for
two or three dollars.

A.61:  Just like V C R's, too [laughter].

B.62:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.63:  Yeah, I thought of that, too, that if I wait, it'll get a lot less
expensive, and I can do without it for a while.

B.64:  Sure and also they get better quality --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- w-, and they learn to have more features and things and --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- without, and making them less expensive.  So we're kind of waiting to,
like, uh, now, you know, and the price of cassettes has gone down --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- because C D -s are so popular, so,  

A.71:  That's, and a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too,
right now, I think.

B.72:  I haven't even priced them.  I guess they must be.

A.73:  They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece.

B.74:  Oh, really? 

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  That is awful [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah [laughter].  I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that
have C D players.  I thought, my gosh,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a
while.

B.80:  [Laughter] Take our time.

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  Well, I can't imagine, um, you can't record on them and so they won't be as
functional as like a cassette player, where if you heard something, you could
record it,

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  you know.  Uh, if you have, I guess, if you wanted to record something to
play out in your car or something,

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  that you'd heard or that you owned an album of, so C D -s won't be nearly
as handy.

A.87:  Yeah, see, I've got a, on my stereo I've got a, a, uh, turntable, and then
I've got a dual cassette so I can record off other cassettes.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  But I never realized you couldn't record onto C-, I just never really
thought about it because I haven't really looked into it very much.  I don't
have one and,

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  and I've never really looked at one very closely, but that, that would be
inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car.  Now I guess, you
know, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will
probably have C D -s players by then,

B.92:  Yes.

A.93:  but, uh, I'm not planning on doing that for a while.  I just got mine
paid off [laughter].

B.94:  [Laughter] Enjoy it.

A.95:  I'm going to stick with the cassettes and, and, uh, you know, until, until
they, now my sister, my younger sister has a, she does have a C D player that
she got for Christmas and she's got the, the cassette, so she can record off
cassettes onto C D -s.  I mean, I'm sorry, o-, other way around,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  off C D -s onto cassettes.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  Um,

B.100:  Well, that's good.

A.101:  so I can record some things from her and, you know, get cassettes and
record off other ones or off the radio if I want to but --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- but, uh, I just haven't gone to C D yet.

B.104:  Why, we haven't either, but we, you know, we like the, the idea of having
great extra quality, you know,

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  in your music and things.  But, but I'm satisfied to just have what I've
been used to, not have to think about the great financial [laughter] --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all
C D -s or something.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had
children, um, I really started to think about what kind of television programs
I was watching,

A.111:  Right.

B.112:  and what kind of music I was listening to and --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- activities because, um, you know, I just didn't want them to be exposed
to a lot of things, and a lot of the, lot of the songs have some lyrics that,
um --

A.115:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

B.116:  -- I just wasn't pleased with,

A.117:  And they get worse and worse, too.

B.118:  you know.  Uh-huh.  And so I really think we've tried to tone down --

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  -- our taste there to make, uh, you know, our children not be exposed to so
many ne-, negative things so early in life.

A.121:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's amazing how I used to, when I was in college, I used
to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something,

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  but ever since I've been out of college, I guess over the last several
years, I listen to the stereo less and less.  Now I, I will turn on, I've got
a small jam box in my bathroom.  I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and
while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- and it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, so I'll turn
the radio on and,

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because,
again, there's, you know, there's nothing else going on.  I might as well
listen to the radio while I'm driving to work.

B.128:  Right.

A.129:  But other than that, I've, I really don't, I don't listen to the radio or
even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore.  I guess I'm
just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go
decide what I want to listen to,

B.130:  [Laughter].

A.131:  and put it on the, on the turntable.  I don't know, I just don't, don't
bother to do it very much anymore.

B.132:  Yes, I know what you mean.  I, I know my husband, he, um, plays an
instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high 
school --

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  -- and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music, and he goes out of
his way to play marching band music,

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  or like you say, jazz or classical to the children to, to give them some
exposure to different kinds of music.

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all
different kinds and,

A.139:  That's good.  What instrument does he play? 

B.140:  He plays the, it's a euphonium.  It's like a small, a really small, not a
tuba, but I th-, it's hard to explain [laughter].

A.141:  Uh-huh.

B.142:  I never had known anyone to play one before.  

A.143:  Uh-huh, I've never heard of that.

B.144:  But it's kind of like a small, small tuba but it's not the kind that sits
up on your shoulder.

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  But it's a cross between a tuba and, and an, and, you know, a horn.  It's a
brass instrument.

A.147:  Uh-huh.

B.148:  [Swallowing] So he plays that and, and a little bit of piano and --

A.149:  Uh-huh.

B.150:  -- but he has some real fond memories of marching band --

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  -- and concert band type activities, and he thinks that would be good for
the kids [laughter].

A.153:  Uh-huh, oh, I'm sure it is.  I'm sure it is.  I was exposed to a lot of
music when I was younger.  I, my parents had me take piano lessons for eight
years,

B.154:  Uh-huh.

A.155:  and, so I was, I was a real good piano player, but then I got interested in
a lot of other things and I got real involved in many things and, and now I
don't have a piano in my apartment or anything.  I could sit back down and
play a few things,

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  but not like I used to be able to.  It's kind of sad that I've let that
slip away.

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  And I took guitar lessons, I think, for one or two years, and, uh, that was
about the same time I was taking piano.  And then I got too busy in high
school {faint} to really keep up with it between homework and ...
