============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  I don't think I've ever met anybody that thought they were paying too
little taxes [laughter].

B.3:  I [laughter] haven't either. 

A.4:  So,

B.5:  I know I pay too much.

A.6:  [Laughter] So I assume that we're going to agree that we all pay too much
taxes.

B.7:  Right.

A.8:  But then the question is, are we getting what we pay for?

B.9:  Well,

A.10:  And, and I think we don't.

B.11:  I, I agree.  I agree.

A.12:  I think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects.

B.13:  Absolutely. I, fortunately we don't have state income tax.  I know you guys
do and,

A.14:  Right.  Well, I lived in Texas for a long time so I was --

B.15:  And it's heading that way though.

A.16:  -- really hit hard,

B.17:  [Laughter].

A.18:  by the nine percent California --

B.19:  #Oh, gosh.#

A.20:  -- #tacked on to# the government's.

B.21:  Well, I think within the next few years we're going to have it here.

A.22:  #Yeah# --

B.23:  #They're# trying.

A.24:  -- I know Texas, uh, just raised their sales tax #again# --

B.25:  #Yeah,# #I know, we're just taxed.#

A.26:  -- #because, uh, I was visiting# in Houston over Christmas with my mother
--

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- and uh, I w-, bought a few things, and I think your sales tax is higher
than ours now.

B.29:  Probably is.  I'm tel-, and I pay enough in, I pay income tax that some
people make and it really just tears me up.  I can't believe how much I pay.

A.30:  Yeah.

B.31:  But, and, for, for what?  [Laughter] I don't know what I get for that.

A.32:  Well, I really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted
#on# --

B.33:  #I# do too.

A.34:  -- unnecessary, uh --

B.35:  (( )).

A.36:  -- bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things.

B.37:  I do too.

A.38:  We h-,

B.39:  I know there are.

A.40:  we have, uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars going to, uh, people to
supervise people who supervise people --

B.41:  Yes.

A.42:  -- who supervise people, and when it all comes out --

B.43:  #You know, and,#

A.44:  -- #they don't do# much supervising anyway.

B.45:  I know it.  Or, uh, who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly?

A.46:  [Laughter].

B.47:  And why do we have to have, you know [Laughter].

A.48:  Well, actually, as a matter of fact, that sort of research,

B.49:  [Laughter].

A.50:  I think is worth spending some money on because the, uh, basic research
really is what's made our country, uh, get to where it is in its --

B.51:  Right.

A.52:  -- ability #to compete.#

B.53:  #And I don't# mind spending on defense, either.  That doesn't bother me at
all.

A.54:  No.

B.55:  Course I work in a defense proj-, company, so naturally [laughter] #I'm for
it, but,# 

A.56:  #Well, y-, I don't# mind spending on defense for things that work.  But I
mind having people (( )) spend money to create five thousand pages of
#documentation# --

B.57:  #Yeah,# right.

A.58:  -- to order something.

B.59:  Right.

A.60:  #This is crazy.#

B.61:  #And you know# the companies that, that say they, you know the, uh, seven
hundred dollar, six thousand dollar toilet seat --

A.62:  Yeah.

B.63:  -- in reality it probably really does cost that because of all the paper
work the government requires --

A.64:  #Exactly.#

B.65:  -- #that you# have to go through to make that toilet seat to sell it to
them.  It probably does cost six #thousand dollars.#

A.66:  #Yeah, I think# the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate
#expenditure# --

B.67:  #Yeah.#

A.68:  -- given what the government requires of the manufacturer. 

B.69:  #Right.#

A.70:  #The manufacturer's# probably not making very much profit on that
[laughter] --

B.71:  Uh, no, no.

A.72:  -- but probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to, uh,
ridiculous kinds of, of paper work and #supervision.#

B.73:  #Uh-huh,# uh-huh, uh-huh, I know.

A.74:  Um, are, are you familiar with the Grace Commission?

B.75:  No.  What is that?

A.76:  Well, I don't remember exactly when that started, but it was back in the
early eighties, I think.  Uh, Peter Grace of W J Grace and Company --

B.77:  #Uh-huh.#

A.78:  -- #was, uh,# appointed by, I believe, Reagan,

B.79:  [Noise].

A.80:  to, um, create a commission to investigate government purchasing and
expenditures and see if there wasn't a way to save money.

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  And he, uh, he and his group, of course, he didn't do it,

B.83:  [Noise].

A.84:  but he got people to do it, came up with a, a whole book's worth of
recommendations for making the government run more like a business.  And he
said that, you know the, the kinds of things the government does even in
renting space would drive a business bankrupt --

B.85:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.86:  -- and, uh, people purchase things because of the rules that require them
to --

B.87:  Right.

A.88:  -- buy certain kinds of things in certain ways --

B.89:  Right.

A.90:  -- that are totally irrational.

B.91:  Yeah.

A.92:  They buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much
as they need in little quantities, when they ought to be able to, um, you
know, deal like a business --

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  -- and, uh, get things in quantity that will, uh, y-, give them a discount.

B.95:  #Right.#

A.96:  #They ought to# pay their bills on time.  One thing the government does is,
is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things
that the government could have paid for,

B.97:  [Whispering].

A.98:  the minute it was due and taken the #five percent# --

B.99:  #Right.#  [Noise] {shuffling in background}.

A.100:  -- uh, credit for early payment.

B.101:  Right, I #know that.#

A.102:  #Anyway,# there was this whole book that came out and I read some excerpts
from it and every single thing they recommended was so [laughter] eminently
sensible --

B.103:  [Laughter] They (( )),

A.104:  -- and it just astonishes,

B.105:  [Noise] {water running}.

A.106:  me that we have not put more of that into practice.

B.107:  I know it, I know it just boggles your mind when you th-,

A.108:  #And ev-,#

B.109:  #It's scary# to think that these guys are up there running our [laughter]
government --

A.110:  Right.

B.111:  -- that approve of all this stuff.

A.112:  And every time the, uh, Congress changes and people move offices they
redecorate the whole office.

B.113:  Uh-huh.

A.114:  They spend half a million dollars,

B.115:  [Noise].

A.116:  on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been redone less
than three years earlier  [/Noise].

B.117:  I know it, isn't that sick?  Isn't that?  #That's our tax dol-,#

A.118:  #And then they come up with these# crazy projects to do things like spend
seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welk's birth place a shrine.

B.119:  [Laughter].

A.120:  [Laughter] I do not need a national park around Lawrence Welk's birth
place.

B.121:  [Laughter] I don't either.  

A.122:  And I can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred
thousand dollars.

B.123:  I know it, but, you know, what can you do?  There's really, I don't ev-, I
really don't know what we can do about it.  #(( )) Ways other than,# 

A.124:  #Well, I don't think it# does much good, but I write my Congressman all the
time.  I've got a congressman who is very #concerned about# --

B.125:  #Responsible.#

A.126:  -- uh, uh irrational #expenses# --

B.127:  #Uh-huh,# uh-huh.

A.128:  -- and who is a real fiscal conservative.

B.129:  That's good.

A.130:  And, and so one of the things I do is donate money to his campaigns and,
uh, write to him when I see things that outrage me.  And --

B.131:  Uh-huh, #well that's good.#

A.132:  -- #uh, I don't# know that it's going to help any but if he got, if, if
a lot of Congressmen,

B.133:  [Noise].

A.134:  get that kind of input from their constituents --

B.135:  Uh-huh.

A.136:  -- maybe they'll do #a little something.#

B.137:  #Something be done.# Maybe, [laughter] that's a [noise] key is maybe, I, I
know.  I donate to work,

A.138:  Yeah.

B.139:  we have, uh, a thing to, you can donate, but of course what we're
donating our political party that we're do-, donating is whoever is, is for
the defense department, you know --

A.140:  #Yeah.#

B.141:  -- #of course,# our defense budget, that's who our mon-, money goes to.  We
really don't have any say so.

A.142:  Well, I'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense, but not of
wasting it, and --

B.143:  #I wouldn't either.#

A.144:  -- #some of the things# that we do, uh, like have three different kinds of
incompatible computer equipment for the three services --

B.145:  Yes, #yes, that's dumb.#

A.146:  -- #it is just dumb.# There is no reason why we shouldn't have somebody
take a look at, uh, all of the things that the various services use and make
them interchangeable.

B.147:  Absolutely, I, jus-, what's wrong with that?

A.148:  Then the same spare parts can be used [laughter] --

B.149:  That's right [laughter].

A.150:  -- in Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe [laughter].

B.151:  Yeah, yes, I know. 

A.152:  Oh.

B.153:  I can't understand, but, I know our c-, my property tax goes up all the
time.  I'm right at D F W airport so #we're# --

A.154:  #Oh,# yeah.

B.155:  -- we should be getting a tax break because we get all (( )), the town I
live in gets all of the, uh, revenue from D F W because its in our city
limits, but --

A.156:  Uh-huh.

B.157:  -- it doesn't.  All it's, [sigh] there just building these great big fancy
homes, and, uh, taxes are just going up and up.

A.158:  Um.

B.159:  Course my, the value of my home is going up too.  So that doesn't hurt.

A.160:  Well, that's good, but that's, that's small comfort because it doesn't
bring you any income until you sell it [laughter].

B.161:  That's true, [laughter] you got that right.  You got,

A.162:  Now we don't have, uh, property taxes going up as much as you all do
because we had proposition thirteen that says --

B.163:  #Enough's enough. [Laughter].#

A.164:  -- #once you have# had your house appraised, then they can only raise the
taxes I believe it's two percent or maybe it's three percent a year, uh --

B.165:  That's great.

A.166:  -- until you sell and then it's reevaluated.

B.167:  Oh, okay, well, that's #a good idea.#

A.168:  #Oh, and that's, that# helps people on fixed incomes --

B.169:  #Sure.#

A.170:  -- #and# older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but
who don't want to move out of them.

B.171:  Yeah, I keep reading where they (( )) in Mal-, in Los Angeles area, where
the, the property thing is just going to bust one of these days, you know, or
and San Francisco, too, I think, the p-, prices of #real estate is so high.#

A.172:  #Well, the prices are so# high, I don't see how they could keep going up.

B.173:  No, I don't, and they say it's come, you know, a lot of companies are
moving out of California because they can't afford, people can't afford to
live there to work there --

A.174:  #Yeah.#

B.175:  -- #so they're# moving.  I know, Silicon Valley, they say is just,

A.176:  Well, I'm in Silicon Valley.

B.177:  Oh, #are you?#

A.178:  #And they# have, the, the reason that the prices have gone up so high is
that there just isn't any more land left to build on.  Most of #the# --

B.179:  #Oh.#

A.180:  -- surrounding land is all, uh, in preserves of one sort or other --

B.181:  #Oh, okay.#

A.182:  -- #and it can't be# developed.

B.183:  Uh-huh.

A.184:  So there's very little property that hasn't already been built on.

B.185:  Oh, okay.

A.186:  And one of the problems our city is having is that, uh, with all of the
environmental requirements and the #anti-development# --

B.187:  #Uh-huh.#

A.188:  -- people taking over the city council, we've driven out some corporations
--

B.189:  #Yeah.#

A.190:  -- #which# were paying a lot of our taxes.

B.191:  #Oh, okay.#

A.192:  #And so# now they're going to have to assess us because they, we've --

B.193:  [Laughter] #Yeah.#

A.194:  -- #driven# out the businesses that were paying the freight.

B.195:  Now that's a shame.

A.196:  Yeah, for instance, we have the Stamford Shopping Center, which was, uh,
paying, oh, I think it was about a quarter of our, uh, city budget --

B.197:  #Uh-huh.#

A.198:  -- #because# of the sales taxes that were collected there.  And in this
recession, a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their
sales taxes have dropped and we're about a million dollars below budget,
primarily because of the sales tax drop off.

B.199:  Oh, okay.

A.200:  And that, uh, and also Hewlett Packard was, uh, headquartered here and --

B.201:  Uh-huh.

A.202:  -- so everything that they sold the sales taxes, uh, were paid,
