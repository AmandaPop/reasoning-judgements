============================================================================

@A.1:  There we go.  Uh, normally it takes me a lot longer to get through --

B.2:  Oh.

A.3:  -- but this is pretty quick.  Do you have children?

B.4:  Yes, I do.

A.5:  #Oh.#

B.6:  #I# have five.

A.7:  Oh, my goodness.  Well then you've obviously had some experience with child
care.

B.8:  Um, both ends actually [laughter].

A.9:  Really?  What do you mean?

B.10:  I tended in my home for about twelve years.

A.11:  Oh, wow.

B.12:  And, uh, uh,

A.13:  Now, what did you look for when you were looking for child care?

B.14:  When I was looking for child care?

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  I've never had to, uh, it's been --

A.17:  #Oh, it, it's, it# --

B.18:  -- #the situation where# I had to put, 

A.19:  -- #it, uh-huh.#

B.20:  #my own children# in child care, thank goodness.

A.21:  Yeah, that's nice, #lucky.#

B.22:  #I was,# I was, um, always been very grateful for that.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Excuse me just a minute [talking] {to someone in background}.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  {Resumes talking to A} I'm sorry.

A.27:  That's okay [talking].

B.28:  But it has been a, a factor.  My youngest is now in a, uh, preschool --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- which is different than {pause} day-care, I guess, you know, per se.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Um, well what, you know, I work in a personnel agency --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, so I'm constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs, and
I've just really become discouraged in people's own sense of responsibility
and dependability [talking].  Um, and what, what's hard for me is, I don't
have children, but I would imagine once I do, I am probably going to need to
find some sort of child care.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  And it worries me.  It worries me a lot, because I just, um, I, I, I don't
know who I could feel comfortable trusting my children with.

B.36:  Oh, it's very #hard,#

A.37:  #It,#

B.38:  it's #very hard.#

A.39:  #I, yeah.#

B.40:  I always felt like I ran a real tip-top in home child care. 

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  I think there are advantages to, to child care in the home.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  But, oh, I'd be very, very careful if I were putting my own children in a
home.

A.45:  I know.

B.46:  They, uh, and even if you get a place that's just perfect --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- just perfect.  You know, it's clean, and the people are responsible,
and, and the, uh, the other kids are decent and there are programs provided
and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that,

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  you think of, you know --

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  -- to worry about.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  I, you know, you, your children build bonds --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- with those kids that are there.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And yet, and they're usually very young preschool age --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and yet when that's gone --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- you don't, 

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  you don't even know who those other mothers #are,#

A.65:  #I know.#

B.66:  #chances are,#
 
A.67:  #Oh, I know.#

B.68:  they're like little cousins, you know, or brothers and sisters, and yet,
they never see one another again,

A.69:  Uh-huh [/talking].

B.70:  so.  You know, I think that's a, that's a factor, too.

A.71:  Oh, it certainly is.  Um, and,

B.72:  #Most of my, uh# --

A.73:  #Uh-huh.#

B.74:  -- I come from a family of nine children.

A.75:  Oh, wow.

B.76:  Myself, my own, you know, children, my, uh, nuclear family --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and most of us have somehow been able to work out either aunts and
uncles, siblings, you know, #older siblings# --

A.79:  #That's great# [talking].

B.80:  -- younger siblings, you know, some of us have had children that were quite
stretched out in age, or situations where, you know, kind of joint, where
mothers worked at night --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- or, you know, alternated, or dad worked out of the home, so he could
tend the kids, you know, different things and --

A.83:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.84:  -- um, not very many of us have had to actually have that full day, every
day day-care in a #herd kind# --

A.85:  #Uh, well# -- 

B.86:  -- of situation.

A.87:  -- not only, ye-, not only does that make you, uh, just have, you know,
more peace of mind, but isn't that great for the child, too --

B.88:  I think so.

A.89:  -- to not be with strangers.  And even though they're, you know, getting to
know the people, and it's probably good for them to, you know, be out of the
house and all that, but just to have a parent with them.  So few families are
able to do that these days, that the fact that you're able to do it and, and
that your siblings could, that's just wonderful [noise] {sounds like something
rustling}.

B.90:  Well, and at the time that I was doing, you know, in home child care, I, I
felt real strongly, you know that that was a, needed to be a real viable
opportunity for parents to, to have --

A.91:  Uh-huh [/rustling].

B.92:  -- that option, that they didn't feel, you know, a lot of people, most
people cannot afford to have a nanny --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- or a governess --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- you know, type situation where that housekeeper, someone in the home,
their own home, is tending to their own children --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- day in and #day out.#

A.99:  #Uh-huh,#  #yeah.#

B.100:  #That's# just a luxury --

A.101:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.102:  -- #most# people can't afford.  If they could afford that, they probably
wouldn't be going to work --

A.103:  Right [laughter].

B.104:  -- except for the person who's got a career, you know --

A.105:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.106:  -- who's, um, I think more and more, I think we're going to see child care
change.  I think there's going to be more corporate --

A.107:  Definitely.

B.108:  -- involvement.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  I think we're going to see a lot more, um, paternity leave and options that
involve the dads more.

A.111:  Definitely.  And we're going to see more, like you were saying, corporate.
I think we're going to see more, uh, #maybe# --

B.112:  #Flex#  #times.#

A.113:  -- #even# a corporate contribution.  I mean --

B.114:  Yeah, yeah.

A.115:  -- just companies helping to, to pay for it, because it's just not, #i-,
it's a necessity.#

B.116:  #Well, basically,# you know, we already have.  My husband works for a
large, uh, oil corporation --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- and they have, you know, a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free,

A.119:  #Yes, that's,# 

B.120:  #you know, if# you put it in ahead of time.

A.121:  what we do here.  Uh-huh --

B.122:  Yeah, I think that's --

A.123:  -- pretax dollars --

B.124:  -- uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.125:  -- that, that you're, yeah, that's, that's what we have here.

B.126:  And on site care --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- those kinds of things.

A.129:  Oh, they do have on site care?

B.130:  No, #no they don't.#

A.131:  #Oh, I'm sorry.#  Oh --

B.132:  I think that is one way, one wave of the future that we'll see.

A.133:  -- uh-huh, boy, yeah.

B.134:  And, and much needed.  I, I like to see those kinds of things that
emphasize the family unity, rather than, you know.

A.135:  [Talking] Sending people off and,

B.136:  Because we just have a generation,

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  of people that are not going to be happy with either parent, not, when,
and our economy is, almost precludes {pause} one person staying home.

A.139:  Oh, I know.

B.140:  If they stay home, they've still got to contribute #somehow# --

A.141:  #Uh-huh,# yes.

B.142:  -- you know, financially.

A.143:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Um, and, and I guess, you know, it's just, it's too scary
to be reading the papers and hearing on the news, they always say that, um,
you know, all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places,
like, uh, sexually abused children --

B.144:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.145:  -- it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody --

B.146:  Yeah.

A.147:  -- that they think they knew well --

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  -- and trusted.  Um, and #it's so# --

B.150:  #They say# #probably eighty percent.#

A.151:  -- #the scary# thing is that you think, okay these people are good because
you can trust them and, and all that, then they're the ones that might, you
know, turn around and be the ones that cause the problem [talking].

B.152:  Well.

A.153:  It's, it's really scary, it's, um, I, my husband is a professor, or I
should say, he will be a professor, and, um, I'm looking forward to his
schedule being flexible and to mine, a-, you know, at some point, being
flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and, and
create some sort of way that we can be around --

B.154:  Uh-huh. #Uh-huh.#

A.155:  -- #[Talking] you know,# not necessarily at the same time, but at least one
of us be there.  One woman that we have in our office, um, he works during the
day, and she works in the evenings part-time.

B.156:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.157:  And so, you know, even though she's only working part-time, she's not
spending money on the day-care.

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  So it's almost like you're not, um, you know, maybe you're not making as
much, but you're not spending as much, either.

B.160:  I read the most interesting article, here, oh gosh, it's been about two
months ago.

A.161:  Yeah.

B.162:  Right around Easter time I remember thinking it was when I read it, about a
husband and a wife --

A.163:  Uh-huh.

B.164:  -- that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas.

A.165:  Oh, my goodness [/talking].

B.166:  I'm trying to think, it was computer related, they were both over a
department --

A.167:  Uh-huh.

B.168:  -- he worked one week, she works the next.

A.169:  Oh, wow.

B.170:  They have two children.

A.171:  Isn't that ideal.

B.172:  How very unusual --

A.173:  Yes.

B.174:  -- you know, I mean, for to find two people who even could do the same 
job --

A.175:  Right.

B.176:  -- or have the same education to do it, but they'd met on site, you know,
and --

A.177:  Right.

B.178:  -- the relationship developed, and, you know, they married and,

A.179:  And a company that can #allow that.#

B.180:  #That would support#  #it.#

A.181:  #Yeah.#

B.182:  And the, uh, of course, you always wonder, you know, when you read it in
the newspaper, is it really all, you know [laughter].

A.183:  Right [laughter].  Is this true, or what?

B.184:  Did they just ignore half the team who can't stand this arrangements, but
the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of
it and, uh --

A.185:  Uh-huh, #that, what a neat idea.#

B.186:  -- #and said that their,# that their management styles meshed real well
and,

A.187:  Uh-huh.  Wow that's amazing.

B.188:  Isn't that interesting?  #Very novel, you know.#

A.189:  #Yes.  That is very good.#  I like that.  Um, it's,

B.190:  You know, you hear of women, you know, maybe like on flex time thing, you
know --

A.191:  Right.

B.192:  -- but you're talking file clerk.

A.193:  #Yeah, I know, you're not,# 

B.194:  #I mean, you know,# 

A.195:  #at, at this level [talking].#

B.196:  #you're not talking.#

A.197:  #Isn't that interesting.  Wow.#

B.198:  #Both with master's degrees.#  Yeah.

A.199:  I would imagine that must be hard to, to not bring your work home
[laughter] --

B.200:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.201:  -- though, you know, um, they probably,

B.202:  Our, uh, our dentists are husband and wife team, 

A.203:  #Oh really, oh.#

B.204:  #work out of# the same office.  Yeah, and, uh --

A.205:  Well, that's, that's good, I mean --

B.206:  -- they have children and,

A.207:  -- if some couples want to do that, I think that's great. 

B.208:  Uh-huh.

A.209:  And, uh, yo-, you just got to change your life around somehow when you're
going to have kids.  No question about it.

B.210:  And yet it's worth it.

A.211:  Uh-huh.

B.212:  It truly is worth it.  You know, there are some days when you wonder if it
is --

A.213:  Yeah.

B.214:  -- but, you know, face it, you know, the population is decreasing, you
know --

A.215:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.216:  -- and somebody's going to have these little babies and, and,

A.217:  Yeah.  Now do, are your kids, is, are your older ones at an age where
they're taking care of the younger ones yet?  Or,

B.218:  Oh, yes --

A.219:  Oh, they are.

B.220:  -- my, uh, my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one --

A.221:  Oh, good.

B.222:  -- and, uh, we are, we're to the point now where we only have one that has
to be sat, like you would say baby-sitting --

A.223:  Uh-huh.

B.224:  -- or tending, but I still believe that it's very important that moms be in
the home in the afternoon --

A.225:  Uh-huh.

B.226:  -- when those kids come home from school and stuff --

A.227:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.228:  -- it's just, you know, that's, I think it's just as critical for middle
school and high schoolers as it is,

A.229:  Uh-huh [/talking].
