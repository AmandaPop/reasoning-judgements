===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well what movies do you like?

B.2:  Gosh, I like just about anything.  We, I think the last one we saw was,
uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO. 

A.3:  Oh, now, I lo-, I like the turtles.  My little boy's four and he loves
them.

B.4:  Well, we don't have any kids but we like them anyway.

A.5:  [Laughter] Oh, that's okay.  How old are you all?

B.6:  Um, we're late twenties.

A.7:  Oh, and you just don't have any yet, okay.

B.8:  No.

A.9:  Well I've got two.

B.10:  Oh, gosh.

A.11:  Yeah, my little girl is three months old and my little boy just turned
four.  I had his birthday party yesterday.  

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  But he's a turtle fanatic.  He even had turtle cake yesterday [laughter].

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO.  Is it as good as they say it is?

B.16:  It was, it was actually better than the first one, I thought.

A.17:  Good.

B.18:  What's the last movie you saw?

A.19:  GHOST.  

B.20:  Oh we were just, when, when the topic came up, we, I was asking my husband
right quick, what's the last movies we saw.  He said well GHOST and TURTLES.
I really liked it.

A.21:  Now GHOST, yeah, I love tearjerker movies.  But that wasn't too bad on
tearjerker but,

B.22:  Not too awful bad.

A.23:  It was, oh, it was good movie, though, I can see why it won so many
Oscars [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Because that was just so good.  And I like Demi Moore.

B.26:  Did you see PRETTY WOMAN?

A.27:  No, but I've been hearing a lot about it.  I don-, we don't get to the
video store very often and we don't have cable.

B.28:  Oh, gosh.

A.29:  Well we don't really want cable, it's just, you know, glued to the T V all
the time anyway.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  So we get two channels down here.  (( )) I'm from Kentucky originally,

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  and we used to get five channels without cable.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  You know, forty, well I don't think you all have the same channels, but
here in Texas we only get two channels, and that's, um, do you watch soap
operas?

B.36:  Uh, once in a while, when I'm home.

A.37:  Okay, you work then?

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Okay, well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it.

B.40:  Okay.

A.41:  And then, uh, I think GENERAL HOSPITAL and that comes on different channel.

B.42:  Yeah, it does.

A.43:  But that's all we get, and that's no cartoons for my little boy.  But
we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  And, uh, my husband is a movie fanatic.

B.46:  I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN, it was, it was really a, it
made you feel really good.  It was just a happy movie.

A.47:  Oh, what about TOTAL RECALL, have you seen that.

B.48:  Yeah, I saw that one.

A.49:  That's good.

B.50:  I, I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was.  

A.51:  Yeah, it was violent.  I try to get away from that.  My little boy, oh, he
loves ROBO COP.  And that movie, I have to, I'll fast forward it every time
they come to the part where there is, have you seen it?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  The part where they're shooting ((mercy)).

B.54:  I don't like that.

A.55:  That, oh, that's horrible, [laughter] that is horrible and their, their,
the language on that's filthy.

B.56:  I don't see why they have to do that, I mean,

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  I mean n-, everybody knows that it, that the, the language is there so
they could just ignore it and, you know, 

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  use different words instead, I think.

A.61:  Yeah, yeah, I know.

B.62:  But I, I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite.  I went and bought
the video.  I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.

A.63:  Um, my husband bought me, like, um, uh, [child_whining] I think PRETTY IN
PINK for my birthday.  With, a, wait a second, [child_talking] I will in a
minute Kyle, {talking to child in the room}.  Sorry.

B.64:  [Laughter] That's okay.

A.65:  Uh, he bought me PRETTY IN PINK.  Just a second.  {Covers the phone and
talks to child} Sorry, now, you're glad you ain't got a four year old.  

B.66:  That's okay [laughter]. Now, 

A.67:  It this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls.

B.68:  Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK, that had, um, does that have,

A.69:  Molly Ringwald.

B.70:  Molly Ringwald?

A.71:  Yeah.  It was cute, but, it wasn't, I like the, um, SIXTEEN CANDLES, or
sixteenth birthday or,

B.72:  I think, I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it. 

A.73:  Yeah, oh, that was so good.  Of course I was a teenager when I seen that
and I loved it.

B.74:  I haven't seen it either.

A.75:  Oh, well if you like love stories, it's sweet.

B.76:  I do.

A.77:  Oh, it's sweet, it really is [motorcycle].  And that's a tearjerker it gets
you, [child_yelling] I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her.

B.78:  Oh, gosh.

A.79:  But it's hilarious too, especially with that, uh, little guy in it.  Oh he
looks like little, I don't know, he looks like a little boy next door, 

B.80:  Oh.

A.81:  but he's sixteen.  Oh, it's a cute movie.  I can't remember his name.
He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER.

B.82:  Huh, I don't know.

A.83:  [/Child_yelling] Don't know either.  

B.84:  Bu-, 

A.85:  He's got curly blonde hair, he just a little freckly, little boy.

B.86:  Probably know him if I saw him.  

A.87:  Yeah, if I could remember the name, I know you'd know his name, because
he's played in a few movies.  But, uh,  

B.88:  I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was, um,
SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.

A.89:  Okay, I've heard about that but I can't remember it.

B.90:  That, that's, that's Julia Roberts new movie.

A.91:  Okay, yeah, Julia Roberts is good.

B.92:  Yeah she's, this one, you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and
a romance,

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  and, and this one was a lot more dramatic.  

A.95:  Wasn't it a murder mystery?

B.96:  Y-, well, 

A.97:  Like, sort of [rattling].

B.98:  it was like, uh, it was a, it was a mystery.  She disappeared from her
hu-, uh, husband who was abusing her.

A.99:  Oh, okay, the, yeah, that's the one I wanted to see where he was on, she
was on a carnival, at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something.

B.100:  Yeah, yeah.

A.101:  Well did that come on T V or did it come out in the,

B.102:  No, it came out in the theater.

A.103:  Oh.

B.104:  And I think, you know, around here, it's all ready quit playing.  But I
don't, I don't know if it's still playing any where else.  

A.105:  Well I, I think, 

B.106:  But it was, it was,

A.107:  Real good.

B.108:  it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat.

A.109:  I want to see that.  Yeah, I seen the, uh, previews for it on T V down
here, but it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think.

B.110:  Oh, okay, 

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  because we saw it, probably,

A.113:  A month a-, 

B.114:  four or five months ago.

A.115:  Well I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it,
but yeah, I wanted to see it.  Her husband was a, dark haired guy with a beard
and moustache, or a-, no he shaved the beard off.

B.116:  Yeah, he's, uh, he was a real psycho in the movie.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  It was, it was scary.  

A.119:  Oh, I'd like to see that.  What about, oh, there was a, we got one back
here a while, I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too, have you seen that?

B.120:  Oh yeah, boy I, I didn't like it.

A.121:  You didn't?

B.122:  No, it was, I didn't like the way it ended.

A.123:  I know, well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one
night, Christopher Reeves told, 

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  that, you know, I can't believe they killed them.

B.126:  [Laughter].

A.127:  Or, or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas.

B.128:  Might have been Michael Douglas.  Oh, that starred in it.  

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  Yeah, it was Michael Douglas.  

A.131:  Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all?

B.132:  Huh-uh.

A.133:  Okay.  Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't
believe they killed them and Christopher Reeve, or, Mike Douglas went after
his throat, you dummy [laughter].

B.134:  [Laughter].  

A.135:  So I know that they die, but I haven't told my husband.  We've both been
wanting to see it.

B.136:  It was, I, I, it was, it was weird.  It was a different movie from
anything I've ever seen.

A.137:  [Child] (( )) well we was, uh, teasing, about, you know, splitting our
house down the middle [laughter].

B.138:  Yeah [laughter].

A.139:  They did that didn't they and they marked off routes that they could go or
something [laughter].

B.140:  Yeah, that would be kind of hard for us, we've only got one bathroom, I
don't know h-, [laughter],

A.141:  We've got two bathrooms but, well i-, mi-, actually, if he takes, my house
kind of looks like two trailers put together.  

B.142:  [Laughter].

A.143:  And one bathroom is at the end of one side and one's in the middle of the
other, so we could do it.

B.144:  That wouldn't be too bad.

A.145:  No, and he could climb out the window [laughter].

B.146:  [Laughter].

A.147:  Wh-, and we, our whole house has, you know, every room leads to three
rooms, so we can, you know --

B.148:  Get around.

A.149:  -- yeah, you can get around [laughter].  You just can't go out the front
door honey, sorry.

B.150:  [Laughter] Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION?

A.151:  Yeah, that's coming back, on too [child_talking].

B.152:  I know it's going to be on, on the, on C B S Tuesday night an, and that's
kind of what, in a way, you know, how it kind of bothered you, the way it ended
and stuff.

A.153:  Uh-huh.

B.154:  That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was.

A.155:  Huh, I, 

B.156:  Parts of, parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny but then other times it was
like it was just deadly serious, and it just left you with this kind of uneasy
feeling, you know.

A.157:  Eerie feeling, or, I want to see it though.  I'd like to see that and,
uh, THE NEVER ENDING STORY, came out on Disney this month, I think.  

B.158:  I --

A.159:  I wanted to see that.

B.160:  -- I've heard about that but I don't know what it's about.

A.161:  THE NEVER ENDING STORY? 

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  It's a child's movie, but, oh, it's good, I enjoyed it.

B.164:  I love Disney movies.

A.165:  Yeah, I do too and, 

B.166:  I mean, they're some of the best of, that are made.

A.167:  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, well it's about this little boy who, uh, I think he's
up in a attic, or some part of school.  He got locked in the school and he got
scared, but he starts dreaming and then, uh, he's saving the land of, uh, oh,
it's been so long since I've seen it.

B.168:  [Laughter].

A.169:  All I know, all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog,
this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing,

B.170:  Oh go-,

A.171:  it flies through the air.  And he's trying to save the land from some,
((ooze)) [laughter].

B.172:  [Laughter].

A.173:  But it's really good, I mean it sounds ki-, it, it had, uh, Fred Savage in
it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it,
though,

B.174:  I don't think so.

A.175:  with, uh, oh, he had, uh, uh, oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE.

B.176:  Nope, I didn't see that.

A.177:  You didn't see that, that was cute, that was real, that was a good one.
I, I like, I like slapstick comedy.

B.178:  So do I and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and, and
you're not sure whether it will be any good or not so sometimes we stick
with the stuff we've heard more about than,

A.179:  Yeah, well I heard, a friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night
and she said that was hilarious.

B.180:  Yeah, now, we saw that, and i-, and they're coming out with a sequel to
it.  

A.181:  Two and a half [laughter].
