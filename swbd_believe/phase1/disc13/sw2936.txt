============================================================================

A.1:  Well I've had a, a little bit longer to think here because, uh, they
waited about ten calls before they found you Bob, but.

@B.2:  Oh really.

A.3:  Uh, I, I've been thinking about the fact that the, uh, Gramm-Rudman Act
that was eventua-,

B.4:  [Throat_clearing].

A.5:  originally passed, uh, to s-, to s-, satisfy some of these deficiencies
and place a set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do
things outside the Gramm-Rudman, with consent of Congress, I guess, and that
doesn't seem to help us to much.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Uh, I mean the savings and loan was a great example of that, that's
outside, the Gulf War was outside, so it doesn't it, I guess we just don't
have the resolve t-, to really face up and, and, and follow those
instructions.  I-, if indeed they are politically viable.

B.8:  Yeah, I believe, uh, I believe that's right, uh, I guess, uh, uh, you know,
really what we've got to do is, is face up to the fact that, uh, our economy
just will not support, uh, all of the programs that, you know, that the, the,
some of the people, and I think it's, you know, the minority numbers, not in
minorities, uh, you know, I'm not talking racial stuff,

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  but minori-, minorities in numbers, [throat_clearing] uh, uh, want to
have passed.  Uh, special interest groups, uh, have, you know, their own
agenda --

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  -- and I think that it's time that, uh, Congress faces up to what I think
the, the people in general have faced up to, is that we just cannot really
support all of those things.

A.13:  Uh, it seems to me that, that there's, there's a couple of ways that I've
listened to, uh, various Congress people, and the President and the opposition
and other people propose and, and one thing that's starting to ring a little
true to me is, um, rather severe cuts in, in the defense programs like closing
bases and closing down programs, et cetera,

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  simply because, I, I just don't believe, as much as they want me to
believe, some of the special interests that you talk about, that, uh, mother
Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer.  

B.16:  Right, I, I believe that's true.

A.17:  I mean, we're seeing this thing just crumble.  If, if anything now, I see
the President wants another bi-, two and a half billion to loan them money,
because he's afraid of the outright, uh, 

B.18:  [Throat_clearing].

A.19:  chaos and confusion and anarchy because there's no food over there.

B.20:  Well I, ye-, you know, one of the things that I look at, uh, uh, I'm in
the Dallas area --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- and, uh, Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the, the
sponsors of the, the, uh, bill that's, that called for the closing of military
bases.

A.23:  Yes,

B.24:  And one of the bases that's being closed, or that's on the, you know, on
the agenda to be closed,

A.25:  Yes.

B.26:  is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth,

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  which is right, you know, right close by.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed then
there was really a, a huge cry, you know, from the Dallas, Fort Worth area,

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  about, you know, how it's, you know, that one is the one that should not
be closed, you know.

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  It's, it's not fair, you know, to, to Dallas, Fort Worth.

A.35:  Exactly.

B.36:  But, uh, you know, when Armey's bill passed everybody said, hey, that's a
great thing, you know, we're going to cut back on some of this unnecessary
spending.

A.37:  Yeah.  Just don't gore my ox, right.

B.38:  Right, and, uh, you know, I think that's the, the same case that, that you
know, would hold true for a number of other programs.  Uh, we all talk about,
uh, about how the, the, uh, transfer payments, you know, are not handled
correctly.

A.39:  Yes, that's right.

B.40:  You know, the, the welfare programs and som-, and some of those things
and, you know, they all need major overhauls, but, they all need major
overhauls until they're the ones, you know, until it's the one that, that I
sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from, or, you know,
the one that, that my children, or my grandchildren, or my mother, or
grandmother, 

A.41:  Wel-,

B.42:  you know, that we've all, we all, all got a special interest group that,
uh, you know, that's benefitting from some of these and all.

A.43:  Oh, I guess we'd almost have to, I mean, I don't know, 

B.44:  [Cough].

A.45:  it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in
government if we didn't have special interest groups.  I mean right down to
the state and city levels and so on,

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  but, I was wondering about, you know, I, I was a little bit encouraged
although it didn't seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when
they, last Fall when they, they, they did levy a tax on some of the, p-,
richer people.  I mean they increased that bubble tax there, I, I was a little
encouraged by that because that's another way to cure the deficit is by higher
taxes.  Nobody wants to pay higher taxes, 

B.48:  Right, right.

A.49:  but, I mean, there's going to be a crisis one of these days that's going
to force us to do it anyway.

B.50:  Right, I, I, I t-, agree with that, I, I'm an accountant, a C P A,

A.51:  Yeah, yeah.

B.52:  and I went to a seminar, some seminars today.

A.53:  Yes, yes.

B.54:  And, uh, one of, our opening speaker, our keynote speaker this morning
was, is the presid-, of one of the major Texas companies, 

A.55:  Yes.

B.56:  or fairly major anyway.  And one of his comments had to do with the
state taxes [throat_clearing]. 

A.57:  State tax.

B.58:  The state, the state of Texas,

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  is, uh, you know, in a little bit of a bind tax wise.

A.61:  Yeah, yeah.

B.62:  And one of the proposal is, uh, to, uh, have a new state income tax but
to have it only on, on corporations.  And of course, you know, he's corporate
president, corporate, uh, C E O and, uh, that was just not the right thing,
you know.  

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  The, the corporations are paying too much tax already.  So it's, you
know,  

A.65:  Well they pass it on to us anyway [laughter].

B.66:  Right, so the same, you know --

A.67:  I, I've never, I've never even thought that they, that they would absorb
that.

B.68:  -- right, the same, you know, the same thing applies, you know, if the tax
is, is geared, you know, or, or aimed toward me then it's a bad tax.

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  If it's aimed toward you it's a good tax.  And that's, ye-, 

A.71:  That's right, of course, it, that, that, that's again that, that issue
just like you sited (( )) bill on the bases, but,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  I, I don't know, I, I, it just seems to me that, uh, I mean, I, it, it
does seem to me now that twenty percent, I, I think I'm correct in this, that
twenty percent of the federal budget i-, i-, is allocated now, for debt
payments, or interest payment of the debt.

B.74:  Ri-, yeah, I be-, at least that much [throat_clearing].

A.75:  Yeah, and, and I know if I had to pay that much in my, out of my salary,
I mean it, it's, it, it just seems to me, I don't know whether it, that's kind
of a colloquium, just use common sense, but i-, it just seems like there has
to be some, there will be a crisis at some point when the Medicare programs
can't pay off, when the, w-, when they can't pay off the, the, the savings and
loans, uh, situation, 

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  when the banks can't be insured any longer, when the pensions can't be
insured, then people are really are going to demand something to be done, 

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  but it appears to me, that I don't know if there is any short term or
long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place.

B.80:  You know, I, I think that, uh, you know, I think we're just going to have
to, [laughter] as, as Gerald Ford said, we're going to have to bite the bullet.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  And, uh, uh, and, 

A.83:  but, how do you get people to do that, though, I mean, I, I, I, I don't
even find myself, you know, I see, I, I play that game with myself sometimes,
I know things are a little tough so I say, well I'll just charge this on the
credit card and I'll pay it off in a little bit and then, then every once in a
while I get a shock,

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  I get the credit card up to six, seven thousand, I say this is absolutely
insane and,

B.86:  R-, yeah.

A.87:  we sort of tighten up, or something comes by to pay the damn thing off,
but, I, I, I, I think that we're not paying anything off.  I mean obviously
we're not paying anything off.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  We, we've gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in
the last ten years and,

B.90:  Yeah, yo-, and I, I guess that's the, the problem or, you know, th-, as I
see it anyway that we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as
individuals would do, and that's, you know,

A.91:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.92:  we cut off our spending,

A.93:  That's right.

B.94:  and cut off our charging when our, when our credit gets out of hand, you
know.

A.95:  I saw some Japanese guy on television today, he was talking about the, the,
the trade deficit.  He said as lon-, it's so, it's so simple that, that it
was, it was kind of, it was kind of humorous, he said, as long as you continue
to spend more than you continue to, uh, sell, as long as you continue to buy,
in your country, more than you continue to sell,

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  you'll have a trade deficit, and until that comes under control, uh, the
lending comes under control, that, that's your problem.  Well I mean, 

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  I, I started to laugh at that, I mean it seems so simplistic, but I guess
it is the truth, we just keep buying their stuff,

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  and we don't have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas.
And it is a very complex situation, but, uh,

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  I, I guess.  But, as a, as an accountant, do you, do you find people are
worried when you talk to them about what our government might do or,

B.104:  Yeah, I think, uh, I think, y-, mi-, not so much about what the government
might do but, that, you know, they're worried about what they're not, you
know, what they can't seem to do, uh, it's,

A.105:  What they can't seem yes, that, that's right.

B.106:  you know it's, it's everybody seems to agree that we're really in, you
know, in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the
concern is that nothing is being done, you know.

A.107:  Yeah.  I me-, I guess I was a little comforted by the fact that on this
Gulf War, uh, that we have received, uh, at least sixty percent of the money
[laughter] that we asked for.

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  And I, I should imagine, I don't know how that's coming, you know.  I
remember some, I, I just don't, I haven't seen a real accounting of that.

B.110:  Yeah, I have not, uh, have not seen that.

A.111:  So I guess, I guess, uh, uh, if I was to take a position now and sum up,
because I don't want to talk too long is that the short term, I guess we have
to some how as you say address those issues.  In the long term we'd either
have t-, we'd have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big, the
transfer payments and the military, an, and just bite that bullet.

B.112:  Right, I, I'm, I believe that's right.

A.113:  Okay, I'm going to cut it off, and, uh, because I've got to go.

B.114:  #Okay, okay, okay, nice talking to you.#

A.115:  #Nice talking to you Bob.#  #Bye-bye.#

B.116:  #Uh-huh, bye.#
