===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay what kind of pets do you have?

B.2:  I have two miniature Schnauzers.

A.3:  Oh, how cute.  Are they very old?

B.4:  Uh, one of them is just a year old and the other one is four.

A.5:  Oh, so (( )) got one with a lot of puppies still in it.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  {sounds like drinking something} #I am afraid so.#

A.7:  #Do you train them?# Did you train them?

B.8:  Uh-huh, somewhat [laughter].

A.9:  Do, can they do tricks and stuff?

B.10:  Well, a little bit, I am, mainly I just like them for companionship,

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  and, you know.  They can retrieve and that sort of thing.

A.13:  Oh, really.

B.14:  But, I do not teach them to do dancing or anything [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  How about yourself?

A.17:  Well, my husband thinks he's married to Ellie May Clampitt [laughter].

B.18:  Is that right [laughter]?

A.19:  Yes, we have four dogs,  

B.20:  [/Laughter]. 

A.21:  four dogs and lots of fish and then, where I live, I have some wild
rabbits that live outside.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  So, I consider them my pets, too [laughter].  

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  I go out and talk to them and give them, you know, things out of the
refrigerator.  I do not know if they ever really eat any,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  of it or not, but, uh.  My dogs are mainly just mutts, they are, they are
all big though, they are like half lab and half Collie.

B.28:  Oh, okay.

A.29:  So I have big dogs and I had never had big dogs until I got married.  I had
a little toy Poodle as I was growing up.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And my dad had bird dogs, but, you know, I nor-, I was used to having a
little puppy that I could hold and snuggle,

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  and, boy these big dogs are something else [breathing].

B.34:  But you know what it would surprises me, my neighbor has, uh, Dalmatians,

A.35:  Oh, really.

B.36:  and they want to be in your lap just like puppies do.

A.37:  Yeah, that's what one of my,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  my male dog thinks he is a lap dog. 

B.40:  [/Laughter].

A.41:  But, uh, it's real funny cause we have a water bed and one of my dogs is
afraid of the thunder and so,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  when it thunders, she hits the water bed, and like catapults you up
[laughter].

B.44:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.45:  It's a real treat.

B.46:  Yes, I'm sure it is.  You just never know where you are going to be, do
you [/laughter]?

A.47:  No.   

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  But, it's real funny cause she's just big and she's real ferocious, but,
boy if it thunders, she is just like,

B.50:  Um.

A.51:  a little baby [breathing].

B.52:  That really tames her down quick, doesn't it?

A.53:  Oh, yeah.  It's real funny, 

B.54:  [Throat_clearing].

A.55:  I got a book on, you know, how to train you dog to keep from being afraid
of thunder,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  but golly, I had to quit my job and stay home [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] That's interesting, I, I had a, a miniature Schnauzer, um,

A.59:  [Breathing].

B.60:  I have always had them, well since the early seventies.  I really like
the breed.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Uh, but my silver one, I had to put to sleep a few years,

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  ago, but now she, she was afraid of thunder, but she would go into the
main bathroom, which is surrounded by the house.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  There's no outside windows,

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  or anything, okay.  And I guess she felt safest there, but she would
crawl into the bath tub.

A.69:  Really [laughter].

B.70:  Uh-huh.  Whenever there were thunder and lightning and then I felt just
bad for her, because she would shake,

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  even thought she was in there.  

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  But there was not much I could bo.  

A.75:  Huh.

B.76:  But the other, the, the puppy I got after that, 

A.77:  [Breathing].

B.78:  which is the four year old, and then, uh, I bought a mate for her to have
company and, uh, the young one that's a year old, they do not even notice it
when,

A.79:  Really.

B.80:  it thunders and lightning.  Huh-uh,

A.81:  That's good.

B.82:  it does not bother them a bit.

A.83:  Do they get along real well with each other?

B.84:  Uh-huh, very well together, yeah.

A.85:  Yeah.  Well, that's what my, uh, Dr Jim Humphreys, I watch his show
sometimes,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  and he said that dogs are pack animals and so they are a lot happier when
they have a buddy to play with.

B.88:  Yeah, and I always felt so guilty leaving the one,

A.89:  Oh, yeah.

B.90:  by itself, you know.  And, of course, with your four,

A.91:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

B.92:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.93:  they have, they have a big time [/laughter].

B.94:  Uh, that's great.

A.95:  But, it's really funny cause I, you know, obviously nobody plans to have
four dogs,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  but, uh, my husband had the two and, then shortly after we got married,
the couple behind us had a dog that they just were tired of, and they were
going to have her put to sleep, and she was just gorgeous.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  And, we said no, we will take her and find her a home.  And we did
[laughter].

B.100:  You kept her.

A.101:  And then, the little one that, or the last one, I guess I should say, uh,
my husband saw her get hit by a car,

B.102:  [Inhaling] Oh.

A.103:  so, he loaded her up and brought her home thinking we would find her a
home.  And we did [laughter].

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  [/Laughter] Cause, right now, I am so attached to all of them, I could not
get rid of one if I had to.

B.106:  [Throat_clearing] I know.  Well, they sound like they are real fortunate to
have found,

A.107:  Oh yeah,

B.108:  you too, you know.

A.109:  yeah, they are real fun.  We take them pretty much everywhere.  We have
to, god it costs us a fortune to board them.

B.110:  Oh well sure it would.

A.111:  But, uh, we go camping and they go with us,

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  and we have the best time [breathing].

B.114:  Well, how do you maintain any decorum around your house?

A.115:  [Laughter]. 

B.116:  [Laughter].

A.117:  It's difficult [inhaling]. 

B.118:  Oh.

A.119:  They are all black and so, I told my husband, I said, boy next time we are
either going to get a black carpet or blond dogs,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  because, I said this is just too much.  And then people say, when are you
going to have children.  And we are, like well, when we start getting rid of
dogs [laughter],

B.122:  Uh-huh.  My, I have a neighbor, we live on, most of the lots out here are a
half acre to an acre,

A.123:  Oh, wow.

B.124:  and they have five.

A.125:  Oh, my gosh.

B.126:  And what she's done, is she sees them along side the road, stray or
something,

A.127:  Oh.

B.128:  she will bring them home.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  And her husband finally said, that's enough,

A.131:  [Laughter].

B.132:  you know, we can not have any more.  [throat_clearing] But, it's amazing,
I have gone over there and the majority is,

A.133:  [Breathing].

B.134:  they were two, two large dogs and they are outdoors,

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  and the other three were in the house, but you would never know,

A.137:  Really.

B.138:  that she had dogs.

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  She must scrub the floors every day.

A.141:  Well, my husband vacuums a lot [laughter] --

B.142:  You almost have to.

A.143:  -- especially when they are shedding.

B.144:  That's why I had the miniature Schnauzers, cause they do not shed.

A.145:  Oh, really.

B.146:  Yeah.

A.147:  Well, now my dad just got a Schnauzer, but I do not know, I guess it's not
considered miniature, cause it's what I consider normal size.

B.148:  They have the standard and the giant.

A.149:  Oh.

B.150:  [Throat_clearing] And, uh, I understand, I have been to dog shows and I
have seen them, I have not been around them, but I understand that they are
very gentle animals,

A.151:  Huh.

B.152:  even, even so they are so big.

A.153:  Yeah.

B.154:  But, the only thing that,

A.155:  Well, how big is big?

B.156:  [Inhaling] [noise].

A.157:  I mean, like the size of a collie, big.

B.158:  Uh, [inhaling] I believe the, the standard are the size of a collie, and,

A.159:  Wow.

B.160:  the giant gets bigger than that.

A.161:  Oh.

B.162:  If I am not mistaken.  

A.163:  Well, then what Daddy has must be a [laughter] miniature too.

B.164:  The miniatures are usually about fifteen inches high.

A.165:  Yeah, yeah.

B.166:  Yeah, and that's how my are.  And then, you know, even though they are
miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size.

A.167:  Huh.  Well, have you ever seen a Schnoodle?

B.168:  Yes.

A.169:  I just love, they were so cute.

B.170:  Yes, on-, a member of my family has one back home.

A.171:  Oh, really.

B.172:  Yeah, they, they are real cute.

A.173:  Well, the first time I saw one I just fell in love and m-, and Kyle just
said, like, no we can not [laughter] have any more dogs.

B.174:  Come on now get serious, right,

A.175:  I know.

B.176:  that's, enough is enough.  Uh-huh.  

A.177:  [/Laughter] Yeah, it just kills me to go, 

B.178:  [Throat_clearing].

A.179:  I can not even go into a pet store, because,

B.180:  Oh.

A.181:  I want a puppy so badly.

B.182:  Yeah.

A.183:  And so, it's real funny, all my girl friends say, yeah everybody else is
saying I want a baby and Jackie is saying I want a puppy [laughter].

B.184:  [Laughter] Well, I do not know if you, if you have ever had a litter --

A.185:  No.

B.186:  -- but, it's a wonderful experience.

A.187:  Really.

B.188:  Yeah, um, the older one that I have got, she has had two litters,

A.189:  Oh, wow.

B.190:  and it is so much fun.

A.191:  Oh, but I just could not,

B.192:  [Throat_clearing].

A.193:  bear to give those puppies away.

B.194:  It, oh listen, I raised three of them.

A.195:  [Laughter].  

B.196:  I kept three until they were about four months old.  I just could not part
with them,

A.197:  Oh, yeah.

B.198:  and then, you know, I had to.  And I did not think I would be able to
sell them when they were three months old, but it was amazing, I have a, I
have an enclosed patio and so that's where I kept the dogs,

A.199:  Yeah.

B.200:  and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's
fenced.  So, the mother trained the puppies.

A.201:  Oh, really,

B.202:  Yeah, 

A.203:  well, that's neat.

B.204:  to go in and out.  And it's real interesting, to watch,

A.205:  Yeah.  

B.206:  how they, they take care of one another and how she corrects them and,

A.207:  Huh.

B.208:  and when they, they fight like kids,

A.209:  [Laughter].

B.210:  and she will break them up.  It was just really neat.

A.211:  Huh.

B.212:  And, uh, it was, it was quite an experience.  And I wanted to, the other
one that I have is black and silver, and I wanted to have puppies,

A.213:  Oh, yeah.

B.214:  with her, but she had a medical problem and I had to have, she had to
have surgery, so,

A.215:  Oh.

B.216:  she is not able to have puppies.

A.217:  Yeah.

B.218:  She, and do, don't you ...
