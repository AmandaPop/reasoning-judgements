@A.1:  How do you feel about, uh, drug testing, Bob?

B.2:  Well, I guess, uh, I really don't have a lot of contact with, uh, with the
business world.  I'm self employed --

A.3:  Okay.

B.4:  -- work in a one person office and so my, my contacts with the, with the
drug testing possibilities are pretty limited.  Uh,

A.5:  Uh, how do you feel about people that are subjected to having --

B.6:  Well,  

A.7:  -- to have the drug testing done?  

B.8:  I, you know, I understand why companies can, in some cases would feel a
need.  Uh, I have some reservations about it because I, I do believe that, I
believe in individual rights --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- and, and I think that, uh, that that does at least borderline on an
invasion of privacy or, you know, or violation of, you know, personal rights.

A.11:  Oh.  Uh, what recourse do you think a company would have then if they had
people using drugs and were jeopardizing the company structure.

B.12:  Yeah, well, I guess I'd, I'm, uh, I'm not sure that, uh, you know, you'd
have to prove somehow, show that there's a reason for, you know, for
suspecting that person as, you know, as being a drug user, or, you know,
whatever, and, I mean, you wouldn't, uh, you wouldn't, you're not allowed, a
company's not allowed anymore to give, uh, uh, what is it, uh --

A.13:  Protection?  

B.14:  -- the, no, the test, uh, now I've drawn a blank.  

A.15:  Uh, you mean, uh, uh, the test to,    

B.16:  Polygraph test.  

A.17:  Oh, the polygraph.  

B.18:  Yeah, you're not allowed to use polygraph test in prescreening, you know,
for employees anymore.

A.19:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh, so, you know, you don't have any, any proof or any way to check on a
person as to their honesty.  Uh, the only way that you, you know, the only
alternative you have if you suspect a person is, uh, is stealing from you is
to get evidence --

A.21:  Correct.  

B.22:  -- uh, to that effect, you know, and I kind of feel like, uh, drug testing
should fall into that, into that same category or potentially, anyway, that --

A.23:  Do you,  

B.24:  -- if you suspect it, that you should have some kind of proof, not, not
come up with a method to, to have the employee [laughter] furnish the, furnish
the proof against themselves.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  You know, in effect, you know, that's, that's kind of uh, of defeating some
of the purposes, I think, of the Constitution which, you know, which says, you
know, you don't have to give self-, incriminating evidence.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Course we're talking about, you know, criminal cases in that, in that case,
but --

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  -- I still, I think it still fits, you know, the same, uh, somewhat anyway,
the same area.

A.31:  I guess, uh, they feel because drug use is so widespread and there's not
any, uh, deviation, so to speak, between an executive and a lay person as far
as drug use goes --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- and, uh, I feel and, just looking at it on the surface, uh, that they
wouldn't have much of a choice, uh, in picking somebody, uh, sometimes drugs
don't, uh, the results of taking drugs don't come out until after something
tragic has happened.  And in order to, uh, resolve it before it happens, that
they feel that this is mo-, the most direct way and painless way of, uh,
scanning their, uh, employees.

B.34:  [Breathing] Well, 

A.35:  I know that in our company, I have not known a woman to have the drug test
yet.  But, of course, the men, I guess it's more pop-, and I don't know if
this is true, if it's more popular between men drug use than it is women
because I know there are a lot of women that do use drugs.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's not, uh, from my -- 

A.37:  But,  

B.38:  -- from my own personal, uh, knowledge, not experience, but knowledge --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- uh, there are, I would say there are as many women drug users --

A.41:  As there are men.  

B.42:  -- as there are men.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  Uh, in most, you know, most of the cases that I know of, you know, from
personal conversations, uh,

A.45:  I don't know anybody, uh, in even a random, uh, friendship that uses drugs.

B.46:  Yeah, well, I've known people in the, in the past that have --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- you know, that, uh, and in, in almost all of those cases it was, you
know, husband and wife or boyfriend, girlfriend --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- or, you know, that kind of -- 

A.51:  A casual user -- 

B.52:  -- situation.  

A.53:  -- of drugs or,  

B.54:  Do what?  A casual user?  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Uh, yeah, pretty much, uh,  

A.57:  Just to try and see what it was like and then,  

B.58:  Right, so-, social users.  

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  I, uh, in, in, you know, in some cases it would be, uh, a group of friends
that, you know, that I would know about that, you know,

A.61:  That were experiencing different things.  

B.62:  I'm not a drug user.  I have not ever been --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and will not ever be.  

A.65:  Sure.  

B.66:  But I, you know, I've known people that have talked about it, you know,
and, uh, and it was, you know, it was couples and groups and, you know, male
and female and --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- you know, it was not limited to, to,  

A.69:  Well, I, I would be, uh, I don't have any desire to, but I would be awfully
fearful because of all the, uh, um, illicit drugs that are around and the
methods by which they're made.

B.70:  Right.  

A.71:  And some of them are very deadly and it's kind of playing Russian Roulette
with --

B.72:  Right [laughter].  

A.73:  -- drugs.  

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  So it,  

B.76:  But yeah, I, I understand, uh, you know, the idea, I'm, I'm all in favor of
getting drugs out of the, you know --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- out of the, the system completely.  

A.79:  Well, it doesn't bring anything but chaos.  

B.80:  Right.  But, uh, you know, I think that, uh, I think that the companies
that, that have started the, the, the non voluntary drug testing and --

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  -- and Texas Instruments in particular or is, you know, is one that I know
of anyway.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  They, uh, I think they're asking for, for the Constitution to be
interpreted [laughter] to say, hey, you can't do this.  It's, you know, it's a
viol-, from my point of view, it's a violation of, you know, of --

A.85:  Do you think -- 

B.86:  -- of person-,  

A.87:  -- a rule against a certain, uh, uh, [lipsmack] substance is in violation
of their civil rights?

B.88:  Uh, not a rule against it, but, a, a non voluntary testing for it.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  Is, I think that's, you know, it's, it's, like you're telling, if they're
telling a person, you don't have any alternative but to, uh, accept this test,
go through this testing.

A.91:  I wonder if, uh, now in their applications when they hire people, I know it
wasn't in the application that I filled out years ago, but if now they, uh,
are very up front with saying, we are going to test you for drugs.

B.92:  Well,  

A.93:  And if it's then knowledgeable to the, uh, applicant.  

B.94:  Yeah, in T I -s, under T I -s current policy -- 

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- uh, new hire, new employees are tested.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  And, you know, so it's, it is a part of the, you know, it's a part of the
test, a --

A.99:  So they know -- 

B.100:  -- part of the -- 

A.101:  -- that it's not a,  

B.102:  -- part of the employment, employing procedure --  

A.103:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.104:  -- now is, is to test.  And, and there's, there's no problem with, you
know, with preemployment testing.  That's, I guess that's a little, uh, a
little unusual in that they can test, test for drugs, but they can't test for
honesty.  And, uh, you know, so that's, but that is, that is a, a,
 
A.105:  We live in a, in,
