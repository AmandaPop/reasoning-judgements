============================================================================

A.1:  I guess we're ready.

B.2:  Okay, so what's wrong with our school systems, besides it's really screwed
up, some of them?

@A.3:  Well, I,

B.4:  I don't think, I don't think all of them, I think maybe mainly Dallas
school system, between Richardson is fine, and my son was in Garland and
Plano, he was in all three of them, Richardson, Plano and Garland, and I don't
have any problems with, with, with them --

A.5:  Uh --

B.6:  -- as far as, you know.

A.7:  -- well, it's been a long time since I've been in, uh, involved with public
school systems.  Uh --

B.8:  I think,

A.9:  -- my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty-nine.  So.

B.10:  Oh, my goodness, I think the biggest problem for now days with the school
system, is some of the parents, I don't want to say all of them --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- because I'm not one of them.  But some of the parents thinks just, uh,
they're baby sitters, and they're not.  You know, they're putting a lot of
responsibilities off on the teachers, and I don't think they should.  I think
they should also get involved.

A.13:  Well, I don't know if, uh, you mean, they keep the children,

B.14:  {talking to someone away from the phone}.

A.15:  they want the teachers to keep the children longer?

B.16:  {talking to someone away from the phone} under the shelf, it's in there,
under there,

A.17:  Hello?

B.18:  Okay.

A.19:  Uh, what do you mean by that statement?  Do you mean they want the ch-, uh,
the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to?

B.20: No.  More or less, 

A.21: or are they, 

B.22: to train them.

A.23:  To train them.  

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  In all phases of life,

B.26:  Uh, sometimes [laughter] --

A.27:  Really?  You mean just,

B.28:  -- more discipline, discipline, uh, because they wouldn't be too much of a
discipline problems, I think, if parents would, um,

A.29:  Well, the discipline starts in the home --

B.30:  Well, that's, that's what I'm saying.

A.31:  -- and carries over into the school when --

B.32:  That's right.

A.33:  -- they are school age, and, and,

B.34:  I mean, you have kids, 

A.35:  and I think the school, I think,

B.36:  you have kids going to school with guns, knives --

A.37:  Oh, that's,

B.38:  -- that's, that's from the home --

A.39:  Well.

B.40:  -- but you know, it's, I don't know, I guess parents aren't like when I was
growing up, you know.  You didn't have all this problems.  I mean, we had
problems in school, but not like this.  Nothing like the guns and the, and
the, and the violence there is in the school with kids [laughter].

A.41:  Well, it's just gotten, uh, completely out of hand as far as the violence
in the schools --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- and I don't know what the solution to that is at all --

B.44:  Huh-uh.

A.45:  -- I mean it's just, uh, to me it's utter chaos.  I don't know how some of
those teachers function because, uh, they are being violated by the students,
and I know that there are some schools that are patrolled by, um, private
police and --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- even public police.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  And, and, and they're not getting any satisfaction from that effort,

B.50:  And they're not getting any paid neither.  I mean, there's not, you know,
it's like a hazardous job, now, in some schools, I should say.  Not all
schools.  Some schools.  You know it's,

A.51:  I think, uh, I don't know what the solution is, if the government doesn't
know, how are the, um, there's somebody that needs to rise up and have a plan
that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school
system.  And I wouldn't know where to start, since I haven't been involved in
the public school system that much.

B.52:  Well, I've been involved, and you know what, I still don't know the
problem, I mean, I wouldn't know where to begin to solve it.  I mean,

A.53:  When my children were in school, they were in a, in a private school
system, so I mean, we just, I mean, they just knew that they had to toe the
line, otherwise they would, uh, suffer the consequences, and, and that was
enough for them.  I mean, they just were very responsible kids, and I didn't
have any problems with them.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And I believe that, uh, that starts in the home, and then if the children
are influenced, I guess they're influenced by their peers --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- and, uh, monkey see, monkey do, a lot of times, and it kind of,

B.58:  And then, but see, that also begins at home, because see, my son has, well,
I've seen a lot of kids, you know, and it's like I tell my son, that's not my
child.  What that child does, don't you do.  I say, well, see, I'm not his
mother, and I, you know, you will get in trouble for something somebody else
parent may or may not let that child do.  But you know right from wrong, so,

A.59:  Well, I guess that's the bottom line, if the children do know right from
wrong --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- and, uh, with, uh, with so many of the parents being disorganized
themselves, it's no wonder that the children are so, you have to look at that,
uh, factor also, where those children are coming from, and what kind of home
life they have,

B.62:  Yeah, but wh-, and then you got, what about this other ...
