===========================================================================

B.1:  What are your m-, music interests?  

@A.2:  Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock [static], 

B.3:  [Laughter]. 

A.4:  I, I don't care, 

B.5:  Me, too.

A.6:  for acid rock, 

B.7:  Oh.

A.8:  but, uh, I grew up with country and western, 

B.9:  Yeah, I did, too,

A.10:  but, uh, 

B.11:  and then,  

A.12:  just about any kind of music.  I even like classical music.  

B.13:  Yeah, uh, I'm pretty diversified, too.  I, I don't, I don't like acid rock
either.  I, [sniffing] I grew up in a small town so, uh, the only, [static] we
only had one radio station so it was country music,

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  but then, uh, when I,

A.16:  Yeah, I grew up with Hank Snow, and ((Lefty Frizzell)) [/static] and Hank
Williams and all of those old country and western songs.

B.17:  [/Static] Oh, really.  You're older than I am [laughter].

A.18:  [Laughter] But, uh, I, did you happen to see last night the special on
Channel Two with James Galway?

B.19:  We don't get Channel Two.  My,

A.20:  Oh.

B.21:  uh, our cable doesn't, I wish we got that what, but,

A.22:  That is fabulous.

B.23:  Was it?  Well,

A.24:  We,

B.25:  we don't get Channel Two.  

A.26:  Yeah, when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought,

B.27:  [Laughter].

A.28:  tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.  

B.29:  Oh, really?

A.30:  Yeah, and, uh, it was tremendous.

B.31:  Now, he, he is a, uh, actually, I did, I played flute for,

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  almost ten years and, and, uh, so, I, I, I appreciate his too,

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  his, his mus-, he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he?  

A.36:  Yeah, uh-huh, and it was, uh, mostly all Irish tunes,

B.37:  Was i-, yeah.

A.38:  they had a band with him that, uh, had a harpist and another flute and
then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle,

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  and a couple of violins and, uh, drum, 

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth, it was just
fabulous.

B.43:  Yeah, I, he, he is really good.  Yeah, I, I, I come from a musical
background,

A.44:  Yeah.

B.45:  so, uh, uh, I've played fl-, flute, flute and piano, so,

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  I, I, I have a b-, big appreciation for music,

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  up to a point.  I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new
stuff that's coming an-,

A.50:  Yeah.

B.51:  and much of the new stuff that's coming out,

A.52:  Yeah.

B.53:  my husband says I'm getting old [laughter]. 

A.54:  Yeah [laughter].  I love, uh, I, li-, I especially like instrumentals.

B.55:  Do you?

A.56:  Yeah.  I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good
instrumental {volume got louder} on and just close my eyes and listen.

B.57:  Yeah, that's, that's nice to do, that is.  [breathing] I've got a,
[laughter] I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting, I'm getting
well versed in, in kiddy music [laughter].

A.58:  Yeah.  [laughter] {pause} I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life,
I've always wanted too,

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  I've always wished my parents [laughter] had forced me to learn the piano
or something,

B.61:  Yeah  [laughter].

A.62:  but, uh,

B.63:  I was one of the forced ones [laughter].

A.64:  [Laughter] but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something
and sit down at the piano and bang out music --

B.65:  Oh, I could never do that [laughter]. 

A.66:  -- and,

B.67:  I was never that brave but, uh, [noise] [sniffing] yeah. 

A.68:  I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in
the choir.

B.69:  Yeah, oh, yeah, I've, I've done, I've done that at church too. 

A.70:  Yeah.  

B.71:  I haven't done that in a long time.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  So, let's see ((what els-,)).  Well, what kind of music do you not like?

A.74:  Well, like I say the acid rock, I just do not ca-, an I don't care for rap
music either.

B.75:  Oh, go-, that's not music [laughter], 

A.76:  Uh-huh, no.

B.77:  that is not, I don't know what that is, but that's not music [laughter].

A.78:  If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.

B.79:  Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music, it's just, it's just, uh, uh,
talking in a beat, it is just,

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  it's not exciting at all it doesn't,

A.82:  Yeah.

B.83:  it doesn't give you relaxation, you can't dance to it, you can't do
anything to it [laughter].

A.84:  Right.  But,

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  I, and I love, I like orchestra music too.  Like the, 

B.87:  D-, 

A.88:  Boston Pops or, 

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  or anything.  

B.91:  [Breathing] Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony?

A.92:  Uh-huh.  

B.93:  Have you?  Is i-, are, 

A.94:  Yeah.

B.95:  are they good?  

A.96:  Yeah, they're good.  

B.97:  Are they?  I, I have, I have,

A.98:  And, uh,

B.99:  never been.  

A.100:  we went and saw, uh, L-, L-, LES MISERABLES --  

B.101:  Oh, really?  

A.102:  -- oh, the music in that was fantastic.  

B.103:  I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really, 

A.104:  Yeah.

B.105:  I heard that was hard to get tickets to.  

A.106:  Yeah, it, it, uh, I can't remember how far in advance we reserved,

B.107:  (( )).

A.108:  tickets but it was out, you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall and,
uh --

B.109:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a real,

A.110:  -- it was well worth the price.  

B.111:  Was it?

A.112:  Yeah,

B.113:  I, I bet it was,

A.114:  Yeah.

B.115:  I, I really bet it was [sniffing].  Is that the only, uh, musical, do you
go see a lot of musicals?

A.116:  Just, just ever so often -- 

B.117:  Yeah.  

A.118:  -- you know, a real, a real good one like that one and,

B.119:  That, that would be, that would be nice [laughter]. 

A.120:  I went and saw, uh, I think it was, uh, SUGAR BABIES, that was good, that
had good music in it.

B.121:  Was it?  How, how, I can't, I don't know what that's about.  

A.122:  Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney and, uh, oh, what's that real, oh,
not real old, my wife she is old too,

B.123:  [Laughter].

A.124:  dancer, uh, I can't think of her name.  I got it right on the tip of my
tongue and can't say it, Helen something.

B.125:  Uh, uh, uh, I think I know who you're ta-, oh, I know who you're talking
about,

A.126:  real long legs,

B.127:  she's got black hair, 

A.128:  and dark hair.  

B.129:  Yeah, okay, I know who [laughter] your talking about.  I can't think ever
her name either.

A.130:  I can't think of it. 

B.131:  Yeah, that wa-, that was, that was, I remember that being, uh, here a
few years ago.  

A.132:  Yeah,

B.133:  [Sniffing].

A.134:  but, uh,  

B.135:  Oh, oh, the last country music, my, my parents still, uh, really like
country,

A.136:  Yeah.

B.137:  music and they, they like, uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the
Statler Brothers,

A.138:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

B.139:  and, and, uh, well, my, my, my,  

A.140:  The Blackwoods.

B.141:  my parents, yeah, my husband likes, uh, country music real well and he,
he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,

A.142:  Yeah.

B.143:  and, yeah, he really likes Shenandoah.  

A.144:  Alabama.  

B.145:  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, Alabama, 

A.146:  Uh, 

B.147:  I think, I think they're a bit over exposed [laughter]. 

A.148:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.149:  I get kind,

A.150:  (( )).

B.151:  of tire-, get tir-, tired of every other song being Alabama on the,

A.152:  Yeah,

B.153:  radio.  

A.154:  either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.  

B.155:  Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, 

A.156:  I never have either, 

B.157:  Williams, Junior.  

A.158:  and I never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for
about,

B.159:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.160:  three or four years in a row. 

B.161:  Oh, we, we watch those award shows too, we enjoy watching the country and
the Grammies and stuff but I just, I just don't care for him,

A.162:  Yeah.

B.163:  I just never have.  I don't,

A.164:  I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer
is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.

B.165:  Is, is it?

A.166:  Uh-huh.

B.167:  Okay, I, I think, I, I know who that is, uh-huh.  I think my parents have
[sniffing] have, uh, some of his records.

A.168:  But, uh, 

B.169:  Yeah. 

A.170:  I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold
some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records
of country and western,

B.171:  Wow.

A.172:  songs, Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember
him [music] him.

B.173:  I've heard the name.  

A.174:  He was, uh, played in the old western movies.  He was the sidekick of Gene
Autry I believe --

B.175:  Huh.

A.176:  -- or they, I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy and, 

B.177:  I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,

A.178:  had a real raspy voice,   

B.179:  Huh.

A.180:  and, uh,

B.181:  No, I never have [sniffing].

A.182:  some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys --

B.183:  Yeah.  

A.184:  -- Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,

B.185:  Yeah, those go back quite a way [laughter]. 

A.186:  Yeah.  I took them up here to Collectors Rector-, Records and was able to
get a little money for them --

B.187:  Yeah.  

A.188:  -- but, uh, 

B.189:  It's hard to,

A.190:  my m-, mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant, 

B.191:  Oh, yeah.

A.192:  and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the
restaurant,

B.193:  Yeah.

A.194:  and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy
would give her the old records --

B.195:  Well, that wou-, that's neat.   

A.196:  -- so, that's where I got my,

B.197:  that would be gr-, great if they weren't too worn out, 

A.198:  Yeah.

B.199:  at the time.  

A.200:  Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M
records.

B.201:  Is there not?  You, you'd, well you'd think there would be. 

A.202:  Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them
because,

B.203:  Well, that's true.

A.204:  you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle --

B.205:  Oh, yeah.

A.206:  -- and, uh, they,

B.207:  [Breathing].

A.208:  just won't play on a modern day, uh -- 

B.209:  Well, that's a shame --  

A.210:  -- phonograph.  

B.211:  -- [Sniffing] because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot and you see
seventy-eights,

A.212:  Yeah.  

B.213:  a, a lot at, at the stores, a-, a-, at record stores, you'd, 

A.214:  Yeah.

B.215:  think there'd be a market for, I'm, I'm sure you could find old players
for them but that would cost a fortune,

A.216:  Yeah.

B.217:  if you could find them that worked [laughter]. 

A.218:  Yeah. 

B.219:  Oh.

A.220:  Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays
either because,

B.221:  No.

A.222:  you, you get that scratchy sound.  

B.223:  Uh-huh.  Well, those things were big and thick weren't they? 

A.224:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.225:  You could kill somebody with them [laughter]. 

A.226:  Yeah, th-, warped real easy.  

B.227:  And the ones you buy, go out and buy one now and they're just so thin and,

A.228:  Yeah.

B.229:  flimsy and they just, they're not meant to last,

A.230:  Yeah.

B.231:  at all, ne-, neither are tapes.  I, I bu-, we buy cassette tapes,

A.232:  Yeah.

B.233:  and machines will eat them, 

A.234:  Yeah.

B.235:  and so, the best bet, any, anymo-, these days are compact disk, those
things are practically indestructible [laughter].

A.236:  But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you, back then
when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,

B.237:  Oh, no.

A.238:  so that's all you had to listen to was the,

B.239:  Radio.

A.240:  radio, and, uh,

B.241:  [Sniffing] Tha-, that's just what, just what you had, we-, plus,

A.242:  Yeah.

B.243:  I think it was better back then to, th-, there's too much T V now --

A.244:  Yeah.

B.245:  -- and the radio is, you know, more exciting,

A.246:  Yeah.

B.247:  really, than, than television, kep-, your imagination --

A.248:  Yeah.

B.249:  -- i-, i-, kept and yo-, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television
does [laughter].

A.250:  Yeah, I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.

B.251:  Oh, yeah.

A.252:  Yeah.

B.253:  [Sniffing] Was it on the radio every week?

A.254:  Yeah.

B.255:  Wha-, what day, what day was that on, do you, ha-, can you recall.

A.256:  Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday, 

B.257:  Uh.

A.258:  Friday or,
