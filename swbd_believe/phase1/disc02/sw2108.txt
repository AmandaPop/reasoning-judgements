============================================================================

B.1:  So where have you been, where have you been camping before?

A.2:  Well I've been camping a number of, uh, of state parks as it were.  And,
one of the, the first ones that I ever went out [noise] with was with another
group of people.  There were some, uh, college students, uh, uh, out on a camp
out and there were probably ten or fifteen little tents strung in a row on a
little peninsula sticking out into Lake Texoma.

B.3:  Oh, yeah.

A.4:  And the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be
really out in the middle of no where as far as wind breaks go and, and we had
secured tents real well even if we had done it in the dark at eleven o'clock
at night.

B.5:  [Laughter].

A.6:  And, uh, oh, I guess an hour into my somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and,
uh, said, you'd better get out of the, the tent, they're, they're liable to
come down.  Several of the others had already come down, blown down.  They
hadn't blown away but they had flattened.  And I said okay, I didn't, you
know, was kind of groggy, didn't know what was going on and crawled out of
that tent and, uh, sure enough, uh, shortly after that, they blew down.  So
we're out here in the pitch dark in this wind and it starts to rain.

B.7:  Naturally.

A.8:  And we managed to, uh, fortunately the rain didn't last long but we
managed to get them all back up and, uh, got some sleep in that night.  And
after we got, uh, back from the weekend, we checked with one of the parents of
one of the other college kids and they were a little concerned.  They had
heard on the radio that the winds on the dam there anyway, had gotten up to
ninety-seven miles an hour,

B.9:  Good grief.

A.10:  straight winds.  And, and we could believe that, we were out in that at
that time.  It, uh, it, can be quite a horror story, I guess and I,  

B.11:  That was a bad, a bad place to be especially right there on the water at
night.

A.12:  Yeah, yeah.

B.13:  Especially, if it, I mean if it were summer, you're all right because it
probably wasn't too cold but,

A.14:  Right, it was summer.

B.15:  Uh, probably the worst one that ever happened to me was in, when I lived
in South Dakota.  Um, I was stationed at ELLSWORTH there at Rapid City and
it's right there at the Black Hills and I just absolutely love the Black
Hills, it's the greatest place in the world to go camping.  You throw a pack
on your back and get up in the mountains and you can understand how the
Indians got real religious up there because it's just, it's just awesome up
there.  It's so quiet and peaceful and the wind blowing through the trees and
all that.  I had a favorite little camping spot I used to go to it was, uh,
right next to a stream and all the streams, of, of course are mountain fed,
melted snow so it's nice and ice cold, a good place to keep your eggs and
stuff.

A.16:  Right, yeah.

B.17:  And this little place was, uh, it was a per-, a perfect circle of trees.
It was almost like they were intentionally planted that way and I would camp
right in the middle of this thing and it provided shelter and everything else.
It was just absolutely terrific.  Well, the winters are pretty tough up there
and right around March I start, get cabin fever.  And I say, oh, man, I got to
go camping.

A.18:  [Laughter].

B.19:  So, throw all the stuff in the car and of course, being the careful camper
that I am, I carried my, uh, propane heater with me and a couple bottles of
propane and so I get my tent up and I get my fire place built and all that,
and I'm just having a good time and, uh, that night it got down to seventeen
degrees below zero and snowed.

A.20:  Um.

B.21:  And I'm sitting in this tent in my sleeping bag freezing, so I said, oh,
time to get this heater cranked up.  So I cranked up the heater and this
things going, of course, I got it going full bore.  I run out of propane.

A.22:  [Laughter].

B.23:  So here it is about three o'clock in the morning and I've got to hike
back to my car to get more propane.  Well across the stream, there's a fallen
log that you have to walk across to get into this little place and I'm
crossing over the top of this thing, it's snowing, the thing is slippery, and
of course I slipped and fell in.

A.24:  [Laughter].

B.25:  So at three o'clock in the morning I'm up to my neck in freezing ice
cold water.  And I can just feel my heart just, you know, scrunch right up
the size of a pecan.  So, I finally drug myself out of that, I just got in the
car and drove home.  I left everything sitting there.  

A.26:  Huh.

B.27:  I just got, just got in the car, went home, got, uh, got a nice hot
shower, uh, I got some dry clothes on and then went back.  That was probably
the worst thing that ever happened.

A.28:  Yeah, yeah, I, I hope to never venture into something that drastic.  
[laughter]  Oh.

B.29:  [Laughter]  Yeah, it's fun, though, that was, I just absolutely loved it
up there.  That whole part of the country was great.  Went to, uh, Glacier
National Park a couple of times and Yellowstone.  Yellowstone is just too
crowded though.  It's not a lot of fun with a whole bunch of people around.

A.30:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.31:  And these stupid bears, I mean, they're almost tame they come up begging
for hand outs, you know.  Of course, I'm,

A.32:  Yeah a couple of generations of, you know, being around people and boy
there's nothing left of them as far as wildness goes.

B.33:  Well that's true and, and it's sad because now they, they're so used to
people, they're going into the towns and raiding garbage cans and stuff and
that presents a threat to the people living there and now they're having to
shoot them.

A.34:  Huh.

B.35:  You know, I, I mean, it's sad because those, those bears were doing fine
until we got there, you know, 

A.36:  That's true.

B.37:  and now they're, now we're killing them because of something, some
monster that we created.

A.38:  Right.

B.39:  So, I don't know, it upsets me a little bit.  I like bears.  They're
pretty, they're pretty cool.

A.40:  Yeah, that, it's a shame to change a whole area so much like that.

B.41:  Yeah, and to me Yellowstone was just too, uh, commercialized.  I mean it,
it's got some areas that are really nice, but, I mean, you get up there and
everything is just, you know, you know, souvenirs and all this kind of junk.

A.42:  Huh.

B.43:  And I, I sort of, I like the really raw land, you know, go out and,
where no man has gone before and that sort of thing [throat_clearing].

A.44:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I, uh, uh, I've been mainly with groups of people and, uh,
sometimes with a family here and there, a couple of families get together but
mainly, uh, college age kids and, uh, on this one weekend where the tents blew
down, that same weekend we had one, one college kid that, yeah, he thought he
wanted to come and then when he got there it was a little more boring and, you
know, that place doesn't have a whole lot to do up there.  And, uh, he sat in
his car most of the time and, and, uh, listened to his tapes.  And fortunately
he didn't keep them, crank them up too loud.  But he, uh, he stayed in the car
and did what he could have done at home, as it were.  And it was no surprise
when Sunday rolls around and the car won't start.

B.45:  Yeah.

A.46:  You listened to tapes all weekend, you know.

B.47:  That's right, there goes his battery [throat_clearing].

A.48:  It doesn't take much, but, uh, we got him all back going and packed up
and came on back.  Uh, let's see I had another, another camp out that wasn't,
uh, near as bad in fact, it had some really good, good points to it.  I'm
trying to think of exactly where we were.  Uh, we were on another lake, I
don't remember the, the name of it, but we were right up at the shore and the
way it was layed out the camp grounds were, uh, it was another state park and
the campgrounds had railroad ties blocking off a sandy pit and that made for a
fairly level place to put the tent.  But to get down to the beach you had to
walk down a real steep embankment.  I mean, it was so steep they had put
railroad ties as stair steps every once in a while, mainly for the erosion and
that became a path as it were.

B.49:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.50:  But the beach was beautiful.  We managed to comb out some of the broken
glass and the like, but the actual sand was a real good quality and real deep
and we set up the old volleyball net and, you know, just a typical, uh, twenty
or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this, this cove, this beach
was a bit of a cove and it was surrounded, oh, I'd say a couple of hundred
yards by, uh, this hill, this mountainous, uh, rock terrain and only that
little bitty section of it was actually beach.  The rest of it was water right
up against the rock.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  So you pretty well had the whole area to yourself.  There were enough of us
where we filled the whole peninsula as far as the, the, camping on both sides
so we di-, we all had to walk down to the one area to go down to the beach and
it was pretty much the whole area to ourself.  Beautiful weekend, however at
that time, at that stage in our life, our kids were, were, uh, real young and
one of them managed to catch diarrhea while we were there so we'd have to run
him up the, the hill and,

B.53:  [Laughter].

A.54:  you know, the little portable toilet was up there and, uh, it was a
little to bulky to bring all the way down to the beach with us and we probably
should have found some way to do that, or, but, uh, and it was hot and we had
a little trouble keeping ice.  It didn't last as long as we had planned so we
had to buy that a little more often but, uh, the beach just couldn't, uh,
couldn't have been any better.  A good place to dive for balls.

B.55:  Uh-huh, yeah, I, uh, I used to, uh, when I was over in Guam, I used to go
out and just spend the night on the beach and go, go scuba diving at night and
looking around.  It was a lot of fun.

A.56:  Yeah, you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to, uh, see the
stars and, uh, we do that on the camp outs.

B.57:  Yeah, all the, all the light pollution.

A.58:  Yeah, yeah.

B.59:  Yeah, that was one good thing about the hills you could get up there and
it was just, it was crystal clear.  It was just beautiful.  You saw stars you
never saw before.  

A.60:  Huh.

B.61:  Great place, I'd love to go back up there.  Maybe I'll get back up there
one of these days.

A.62:  Yeah, that's true.

B.63:  Of course I'm in, I'm in North Carolina now and, and, uh, the mountains
here are pretty nice.  I haven't been, I just got here last September but I'm
planning to do a little camping trip this summer.  Get up there in the
mountains and have a look.  We used to, uh, when I was in Alabama, as a boy,
uh, we used to have our Y M C A retreats in, uh ...
