===========================================================================

B.1:  All right.

A.2:  What kind of, um, besides y-, besides your salary what's, what's the most,
the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit.

B.3:  Yeah, [clanging] well I guess, uh, I, I, I'm kind of in, uh, in, an unusual
situation probably for this particular topic because I'm self-employed.

A.4:  Oh. 

B.5:  Uh.

A.6:  Have you ever worked for a large organization?

B.7:  but, yes, I have worked, I've worked for T I and I've worked for L T V, 

A.8:  Oh okay.

B.9:  uh, and I suppose that, uh, so far as benefits are concerned the most
important to, uh, me today would probably be, uh, something to do with
retirement benefits.

A.10:  Okay.

B.11:  At, at this point in my life though, I'm, I'm, I'm a little older probably
than, you know, than the typical new employee would be anyway.

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  Uh, in, you know, in my younger days I, I was interested in what's the
vacation policy and then as I matured a little bit, you know, I was more
interested in what are the insurance benefits, you know.

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  But, uh, so, I, I, you know, I guess it, from my point of view it depends
on, uh, you know, on where you are in life as to what's most important.

A.16:  Yeah, probably because you said retirement and that really has not even
occurred to me once.

B.17:  Yeah, yeah, uh, you know, if you're not, uh, if you haven't, haven't looked
forward to, you know, what are you going to do when you retire,

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it, then it gets
to be important because you've got to do some planning for it, uh, you know,
especially if the company is not doing it for you.

A.20:  Yeah that's true, that's true.

B.21:  And, uh, there are, you know, there are companies that do and there
companies that don't, you know, that don't have good retirement plans.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  Uh, I guess, uh, the companies that participate in the four oh one K type
plans where, you know, you have the, the, uh, option of contributing to, uh,
to a retirement plan and,

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  uh, maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that.
That's, those are good programs.

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  Uh, I, I, I'm a C P A, so I look at, 

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  you know, I get to see a lot of these, uh, a lot of different programs
and things and, along that line and, uh, I like to see where the company makes
those, makes benefits available at least to the employees,

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  So that they can pick and chose what they like, uh, you know, there,
they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan.  I don't know whether you're
familiar with that or not.

A.32:  No, what is that?

B.33:  And, uh, essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where the company
makes available a, a different, uh, uh, different packages of benefits.  You,
you know, you can pick the kind of insurance you want, and the kind of dental
coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an, and all of these
different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost
to the company, essentially the total cost to the company fits, you know,
within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of
benefits but they can pick them from different, whatever is most important to
them.

A.34:  Um, no, I hadn't heard of that.

B.35:  So you can, uh, so you can get, you know, you can get the insurance plan
that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's
important to them.  

A.36:  Um.

B.37:  And the company winds up paying the same, you know, the same amount.

A.38:  Is that something that you should change from year to year.

B.39:  Uh, I believe that you can, that you can change, well maybe not from year
to year, but at least you can change periodically, uh, as, to, you know,
as, t-, to #get the stuff that's more important to you.#

A.40:  #That sounds like it might be a really good idea.#

B.41:  Yeah, that's, uh, something that the, uh, that the Federal government, you
know, put into, uh, you know, into the I R S regulations as, uh, as, uh,
deductions, uh, allowable deductions for companies.  They put those in, oh,
four of five years ago,

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  uh, you know, the, the different insurance companies and things started
promoting those plans.

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  And, uh, I, I think there, you know, it's a pretty good option to have.  Of
course the four oh one, four oh one K is, is a good, you know, it's a good
savings vehicle.

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  So, uh, anyway, uh, what kind of plans are you, are you in now are what
have you been in before.

A.48:  Well, [throat_clearing] I think of, uh, you mean as far as retirement?

B.49:  Well, as so far as benefit packages, in, di-, in total.

A.50:  I think the, the most important thing for me right now i-, is really the
medical coverage.  

B.51:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.52:  Uh, I am in, uh, {pause} uh, in, uh, involved in a four oh one K but I'm,
uh, contributing such a, such a small amount right now just to go ahead and
have the account open.

B.53:  Yeah, yeah.

A.54:  Because, uh, uh, {pause} I just, let's see I've been with this company
for about three months and before that, uh, we were, we're, we're still in the
process of trying to catch up.

B.55:  Yeah, I understand that.

A.56:  We were, we were way behind financially and so haven't really, uh, quite
managed to catch up yet, 

B.57:  Yeah, yeah, so,

A.58:  exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters
even further.

B.59:  Right, yeah, it's, and it's, uh, it, it's, uh, uh, a hassle trying to, to,
uh, uh, put your money all in the right, in the, s-, you know, in the right
pockets, I guess would be a way to say it,

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  You know to get everything.  Do, do you have children and so, so they, I
guess the, uh,

A.62:  No, no that would complicate things even more [laughter].

B.63:  yeah the, yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important
if you had, uh, if you had children.  I guess if you're of child bearing age
then it's important too.

A.64:  Yeah, yeah that's probably,

B.65:  You know, because you have, yeah so it you got to have, uh, at least have
the coverage in case that your, in case you have another child, or have a
child [clicking].

A.66:  Uh-huh, yeah that's true.

B.67:  And, uh, you, you want to have that coverage, so, anyway, uh, but what
else.

A.68:  Well there's lets see, what other,

B.69:  Yeah, uh, I guess, uh, what, what kind of typical vacation programs, uh,
vacation plans do, do the companies have that you've worked for, uh, so far as
#when you get vacation and how much.#

A.70:  #It seems like everybody has,# it used to be that they used to give like two
weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months.

B.71:  Uh-huh, yeah, it's, I have not, uh, I have not seen vacation policies, you
know, written in about seven years, so, I'm not real sure how they're, how
they're changing what they're doing now.

A.72:  Most, most of the time now they do the first week after the first six
months so that if somebody really needs that time,

B.73:  Yeah, yeah.

A.74:  they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and
then have two.

B.75:  Yeah, but, uh, yeah, that's a good deal.

A.76:  So it wor-, it would work either way.

B.77:  Yeah, how, what do you, what do you find that they're, uh, when they
change from two weeks to three weeks, is it five years or ten years or,

A.78:  Probably five years I think,

B.79:  Yeah, uh,

A.80:   or seven, uh, that's kind of far away [laughter].

B.81:  Yeah, [static] that's uh, that's a bit of a wait, to, uh, to get.  I know
that, uh, in the past I've worked for [/static] companies, you know, where
they, they had a pretty good, uh, pretty good pa-, uh, vacation policy, you
know, you got, you got the two weeks [static] the first year and then, they
went up.

A.82:  Okay, um, I've got another call coming in.

B.83:  Oh, is that yours.  Okay, well and it's been nice talking to you.

A.84:  Okay, all right.

B.85:  Okay, thanks.

A.86:  Bye, bye.
