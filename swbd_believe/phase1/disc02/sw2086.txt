REMARKS:	When the side with only Caller A talking was playing, there 
was a lot of line noise during Caller B's part instead of silence.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:   until it was nice and brown, you know make sure it's nice and brown on
both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you, you let the chicken
you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it [cough].

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan and
you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the
oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.
Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the
chicken back in there.  And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe,
uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.  Stir it real, real well.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.  And you let
it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add, uh, about a
tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.

A.8:  Oh.

B.9:  And that's going to, it's going to be really good [laughter].

A.10:  That's very spicy, too.  

B.11:  Yeah, it's,

A.12:  I mean these bell peppers and curry.

B.13:  Right, and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot
peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.

A.14:  Oh, that sounds really good.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  Huh.  I guess it was, is this dinner time for you?

B.17:  Uh, well it will be in a little while, I'm trying to get it, get it ready
early.

A.18:  All done in advance, yeah.  That's um, [throat_clearing] I, uh, I'm, I'm
not that great a cook but I was single until I was thirty so I did cook a
little, you know.

B.19:  Oh.

A.20:  Uh, and I cook a little bit now.  What I like to do mostly is stir fries
and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight
and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort
of like a big wok.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables. 

B.23:  What kind of wok do you have, is it, is it a real Chinese wok.

A.24:  It's, it's called a stir fry pan and it, and it fits right on your, uh,
st-, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric so it's, it
has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.

B.25:  Uh-huh.  I see. 

A.26:  And, um, normally what happ-, what we do is, um, just, you know, like two
tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just
regular oi-, vegetable oil.  But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.
And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and,
um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.  That
gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor and then after the stir fry is over, just
mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth,

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze,

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  that sticks to the, the vegetables, I've used, you turn them over.  A lot
of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, we don't put in meat,

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  cause I guess we're, I'm not but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how
much red meat and things, so.  We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh,
carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.

B.35:  Oh that's,

A.36:  It's, it's a pretty big and we put that over rice.

B.37:  That sounds real good except the squash, I just don't like squash.

A.38:  Oh, you don't [laughter].

B.39:  I never did. [laughter] My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash
and she'd have squash and corn bread [laughter].

A.40:  Oh.

B.41:  And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.  

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  And I'd just be,

A.44:  Yeah, see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.  My,
my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.  I'm,
I'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  Yeah, recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  Red meat and a potato.

B.49:  Oh, that sounds good.  We, we were from North Carolina and we had a garden
and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash and she'd grow white potatoes
and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,

A.50:  Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.  

B.51:  Right.

A.52:  See, never, no vegetables in my family.

B.53:  Wow.

A.54:  Yeah, it was really funny.

B.55:  You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens [laughter].

A.56:  [Laughter] Well that was a real farm.

B.57:  You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?

A.58:  No, but I, I've, I've heard  stories uh, I've heard stories.

B.59:  And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.

A.60:  Uh.

B.61:  And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it
dies down, you get just a little patter and then it,

A.62:  Oh, this is ter-, you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while
you're fixing dinner.

B.63:  [Laughter]  Getting ready to eat chicken too.

A.64:  That's right, you should be careful [laughter].  That's pretty funny.

B.65:  [Laughter].

A.66:  But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat
chickens but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs, we, we bought
everything in a grocery store.  

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  There was no, but it was funny, you know, it so, but when we got married,
you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.

B.69:  Well that's good.  A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.

A.70:  I think so too,

B.71:  Yeah.

A.72:  but we just went shopping and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you
know, chocolate covered peanuts and --

B.73:  Ugh.

A.74:  -- uh, we came back with sweets.  We didn't bring all the healthy food back
too.

B.75:  Yeah,  I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all
of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.

A.76:  Uh-huh, well that's, that's  supposed to be, um, the trend of the future,

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  but, uh, the cut back.  I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's
Indian and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was
really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.

B.79:  Ugh.

A.80:  Yeah, that was a sweet and I was like ugh.

B.81:  [Laughter].

A.82:  This is a sweet.  Oh it is, it's a candy, I'm like ugh, you know, Indian
candy is not very good.  

B.83:  Uh, right.

A.84:  But everything was, and everything, you didn't notice it at first, but
everything was sort of hot.  Everything had a little bit of curry in it.

B.85:  The spice, yeah.

A.86:  It was funny, even the sweets did.  

B.87:  Wow.

A.88:  When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a
couple of minutes you could taste it.  You know, it had that, that after taste
that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  Good, they didn't have, I didn't like her desserts very well, they were
very, yogurt and carrots and pin-, pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.

B.91:  Uh-huh.  

A.92:  And it wasn't very good.

B.93:  Well I might have liked some of that I, I like hot stuff, 

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  I really do.

@@A.96:  Yeah,  well have we done our ten minutes.

B.97:  Oh is it ten minutes.

A.98:  Something like that, I think we're,

B.99:  I don't know, do we get a signal.

A.100:  No, nor-, normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your,
your conversation.

B.101:  Oh, well this is my first one.

A.102:  Oh, okay well that's, you'll see it will normally, it will come on and
it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes
to compl-, fifteen seconds to complete it.

B.103:  Oh wow.

A.104:  But, uh, I've been cut off twice.

B.105:  Uh-huh.

A.106:  So I just thought, in fact I'm just also, I'm hearing a siren outside I
think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know, he has one of those
alarms on his car, 

B.107:  Goodness.

A.108:  one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off.

B.109:  Uh-huh.

A.110:  So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.

B.111:  Well, okay. 

A.112:  Okay, hey thanks so much.

B.113:  Yeah, thank you, it was nice talking with you. 

A.114:  Uh-huh, and you said this was your fi-, well you'll, you'll get a couple
more probably.

B.115:  Yeah.

A.116:  I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday, maybe I talked to somebody that,
uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.  It was a housewife and she was home
with two kids.

B.117:  Ugh.

A.118:  And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you
know, that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she
just kept talking the whole time, it was pretty funny.

B.119:  Yeah, kind of hard that way.

A.120:  Okay.

B.121:  Okay.

A.122:  Hey thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later.

B.123:  All right, thank you, bye-bye.

A.124:  Bye.
