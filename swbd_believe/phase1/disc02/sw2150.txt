REMARKS:        Speaker B I've marked [child_yelling], the child yelled 
once on each mark.  Speaker A was hard to follow.  She constantly 
interrupted.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what do you think?  

B.2:  Well, I believe in capital punishment.  Uh, and I, I think, the way that I
understand the laws right now they are only for certain crimes.

@A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, I'm not sure exactly what they are, I think rape and, uh, capital
murder.

A.5:  Yeah [static]. 

B.6:  What abou-, is it kidnapping? 

A.7:  I think it's all f-, like a felony, I know, you know, like, uh, I think
it's kidnapping and [/static] the person gets killed.

B.8:  Oh, ok-, yeah,  

A.9:  You know.

B.10:  that would be a capital crime.  

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Yeah [breathing].

A.13:  Something like that.  But, my problem with capital murder, capital
punishment is they don't carry it out.

B.14:  Yeah, #I agree.  They,#  

A.15:  #So they're going to have it,# to me they ought to do it.  

B.16:  #I agree.  They, uh,#

A.17:  #You know, they people,# people been sitting like they had on TWENTY TWENTY
or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, one of them, they had them on, the man was twenty years
waiting on death row.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  See, that don't make no sense.  

B.20:  Yeah, I think that we waste a lot of money keeping people in prison.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  That, uh, is not necessary.  

A.23:  And now I think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers.

B.24:  Yeah.  Have you ever been on a jury?  

A.25:  Huh-uh.

B.26:  I haven't either, but and I, [breathing] you know, I, I have real strong
beliefs in capital punishment, but when it comes right down to it, #yeah,#

A.27:  #They're not# going to do it.  

B.28:  Yeah, #I, I'm wondering, though,# 

A.29:  #That's my biggest problem is,# even if you give them the death penalty,
they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it,

B.30:  #Right.#  

A.31:  #and, there's,# you know,  

B.32:  But what if they're not guilty?

A.33:  Huh?  

B.34:  What if they're not guilty?  

A.35:  What do you mean, what if they're,

B.36:  What if they truly are not guilty and they're convicted anyway?

A.37:  That's the whole system, though, isn't it?  

B.38:  Yeah.  #See, that's what,# 

A.39:  #There are a lot of# people that aren't guilty that's in jail. 

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  But, you know, uh, I, I, I don't know about if y-, if they was, like
capital murder.  And then if they were married then what would you do?

B.42:  Yeah.  I don't know, you know.  Like I sa-, said I do believe in capital
punishment, but if I were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision
[laughter] I wouldn't want to have to be the one to make it.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  And I do agree that they keep people, that we spend too much money keeping
people in prison.  The jails are overcrowded.  If they're going to do, well,
you know, let's do it [laughter] --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- do it and get it over with.  

A.47:  I don't know if I could, I could prob-, it depends on the crime.  My
problem would be that, like, people, to me, the like the child people, the
people that's killing kids --

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- uh, the ones messing with old people -- 

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  -- those type of people, now I, I have no pity for them.  

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  You know.  But, just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her,
that he shouldn't die because it might been accident, or you never know what,
you know, what, what they done went through together, should I say.

B.54:  Yeah, but I don't know if they, if they, if, uh, 

A.55:  I don't think,

B.56:  #the death penalty,#

A.57:  #they give them the# death penalty is given today anyway.  

B.58:  Y-, yeah, I don't think they give it to just,

A.59:  I think they just put them in jail and let them think about it [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah [laughter], for a long time.  

A.61:  So,

B.62:  ((I don't)),

A.63:  I don't know.  

B.64:  I definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail.

A.65:  Yes.  

B.66:  I don't think everybody that kills somebody should -- 

A.67:  Die.  

B.68:  -- die.  

A.69:  Because it all depends,

B.70:  On the circumstances.  

A.71:  There's a lot of circumstance, sometimes I even feel like, and up in
another state I think it was Ohio, where they don't have, uh, self-defense
laws and I think that's wrong.

B.72:  Is it?  I, I'm from, I've lived in Ohio and I didn't realize that
[laughter].

A.73:  Yeah, they had them on the news, this lady, her husband, she was sev-, I'll
never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her,

B.74:  Um.   

A.75:  in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat -- 

B.76:  Oh, my gosh.

A.77:  -- well she shot him and she went to prison.  She, you know, she killed
him, but she lost her baby and #then,#

B.78:  #Um.#  

A.79:  they sent her to jail, so that's not right.  

B.80:  Huh-uh.

A.81:  They, she's, nothing should have happened to her at all.  He shouldn't have
hit her in the stomach.  I don't care [laughter].

B.82:  Well, see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat anyway
[laughter].

A.83:  But, he did both.  

B.84:  Yeah.  Well, I wonder w-, did they say why?  

A.85:  Well, he was, he, he, she was abused woman.  He was, he was a, a, what do
you call it, abuser.  He would,

B.86:  Oh.

A.87:  he would beat his wife all the time.  

B.88:  So there was a history of that?

A.89:  Oh, yeah.

B.90:  So she's not going to get to have her baby.

A.91:  Sh-, no she lost the baby.  

B.92:  Oh, okay. 

A.93:  He hit her in the stomach with the shovel.  

B.94:  Oh. 

A.95:  It's just, you know, things like that, that, you know, I don't think those
women or even a man because a man they had a w-, man that his wife shot him,
but he didn't die --

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  -- and, uh, they put her in jail.  Now I don't think anything should happen
to him, but I think she should stay in there because really she just did it
because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  See, I think that's wrong, too.  #But, I don't,# 

B.100:  #Cheaper# than a divorce [laughter].  

A.101:  No, she, she wouldn't have got no property.  

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  See, there was no grounds for divorce.  She was, she wanted out because she
had a boyfriend.  It was #weird.#

B.104:  #Um.#  

A.105:  But, uh, the capital punishment, I don't know actually what they give the
death penalty for.  The only thing I, I know they give it for is shooting a,
killing a cop or, you know, assassination of the President and, and something
big, you know.

B.106:  Yeah, I think capital cri-, uh, capital crimes and,

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  I want to say kidnap, I don't know why kidnapping sticks in my mind.

A.109:  I don't know.

B.110:  But, uh, yeah, I think they should give it to them, but I don't think they
should keep them waiting in jail and let, having us pay for it for twenty
years [laughter].

A.111:  No, if they going to give it to them, I think they should go ahead, you
know, okay maybe a year or, you know, like that, two years, whatever.  But
twenty years, ten years on death, to me, that's worse for them, too.

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  They're not, they don't know when they going to die.  They know they got
the death penalty, but that don't mean nothing.  Not anymore.

B.114:  Well, I, I assume that you live in, do you live in Texas?  

A.115:  Uh-huh.  

B.116:  I think Texas is very, uh, one of the leading states, I mean, I think Texas
executes more people than just about any other state.

A.117:  I don't know.  They don't, they don't put it on the news, or they don't
broadcast it because, you know, the, I guess they don't, just don't.

B.118:  Well, and they, they, they don't sensationalize it anymore. 

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  They used to make a big deal out of it every time it happened, a-,

A.121:  Oh, yeah, all the people for right, uh, life, or something.

B.122:  And I think now that it happens more frequently than we know that it's just
not sensationalized as much.  At least in Texas.

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  Because I hear, every once in a while I'll hear something on the news.

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  I,

A.127:  But, I think they going to have to do something to make people wake up,
like on, especially the drug dealers.  You know, the, the, not the little
penny ante ones on the corner, I don't think they ought to get in trouble.  I
mean I know they ought to get in trouble, I'm not,

B.128:  But they ought to get, yeah, (( )) [laughter].   

A.129:  they ought to get in trouble but not, not death because see they, you
know, we're, to me, what they ought to do, if they can find the big man,
because see, that's where it's coming from, to me, it, it's coming in here
some kind of way, I don't care what anybody tells me.  People tell me, I said
if the government really want to, I think it's all government, something to do
with the government, I really do.

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  Because if you can stop, uh, Cuban cigars from coming, you can't buy
anything Cuban in the United States --

B.132:  Yeah.  

A.133:  -- so why can't they stop anything illegal?  

B.134:  Um.

A.135:  You know, if they really wanted to, I think they could.  They just don't
want to put, there's too much money.  People's been bought out.

B.136:  Yeah.  

A.137:  You know.  And that's what's wrong with some of the kids on the street.
They, you can't blame, just like the man says, he can make two, five hundred
dollars a day for just taking a bag somewhere.

B.138:  Uh-huh.  

A.139:  And his mom is not getting that much money -- 

B.140:  [Breathing] Um.  

A.141:  -- you know.  If you think, you think about all the kids in the ghetto.  My
mom would probably kill us, but [laughter],

B.142:  [Laughter].  

A.143:  But, you know, it's something that has to be done, to me, if they bring
kids into it because now kids are killing.

B.144:  Yeah.  

A.145:  And so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or, to
scare these people,

B.146:  Well, yeah, I mean,

A.147:  I think that's the whole thing.  They're not scared.  

B.148:  #When you think about it.#

A.149:  #They know they're not going anywhere.#  

B.150:  Yeah, when you think about how many people die from drugs, 

A.151:  Uh-huh.  Innocent people, 

B.152:  you know, ultimately.  

A.153:  not just the drug people.  I'm talking about innocent people when they
have they little drive by shootings.

B.154:  Oh, yeah.

A.155:  And, and, and see because I'm from Los Angeles -- 

B.156:  Um.  

A.157:  -- see, originally.  I've been in Texas twelve, thirteen years.  But
originally in L A, they, people die all the time just,

B.158:  Yeah.  

A.159:  from being in the way.  

B.160:  Um [breathing].

A.161:  At the wrong place, you know, see, you know.  But I think something should
be done for them.

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  So.

B.164:  I agree.  

A.165:  But, I don't know too much about the death penalty.  

B.166:  I think that, that they have much, I like that they've changed it to lethal
injection rather than, you know, the electric #chair,#

A.167:  #Yeah.#  

B.168:  #or gas.#

A.169:  #But they don't# use that no more.

B.170:  No they don't.  

A.171:  They use the, the injection thing.  

B.172:  #Yeah.#  

A.173:  #Or whatever# it is.  

B.174:  I think that's a lot more humane,

A.175:  [Cough].  

B.176:  than, uh, than the electric chair, 

A.177:  Uh-huh.  

B.178:  than the, than the ga-, or the gas.  

A.179:  It's funny because I had listened to a comedian talk about the death
penalty, you know, about people saying they, they don't have nobody to do
this, and I said, well if somebody killed my husband just because, I'll pull
the switch.  I'll even do, you know, to me, if, if that person can forgive
them, fine, but what is that man going to do next.  Is he going to go out and,

B.180:  #Kill [child].#

A.181:  #kill# somebody else.  

B.182:  Right.

A.183:  You know, how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people
before you kill him?

B.184:  Yeah [child].  

A.185:  Now, you know, sometimes I can understand maybe if they robbed something,
they didn't mean to do it, okay.  But how many times you going to go by that.

B.186:  Uh-huh [child].  

A.187:  How many times you going to this person keep killing, so, I don't know.

B.188:  Yeah.  

A.189:  I guess if you stay out of trouble, you don't have you worry about it, but
[laughter].

B.190:  Well, ((it's)) like you said, though sometimes people just get caught up in
it innocently.

A.191:  Uh-huh.   

B.192:  But,

A.193:  So I think it just, I think it depends on the circumstances and,

B.194:  [Child].

A.195:  how many times that person has been in,

B.196:  Y-,

A.197:  trouble -- 

B.198:  Yeah [child].

A.199:  -- I mean really big trouble.  

B.200:  Yeah.   

A.201:  You know, so,

B.202:  Yeah.  

@@A.203:  But, that's all I got to say.  

B.204:  Okay.

A.205:  And it's nice talking to you.  

B.206:  Well, it's nice talking to you [child].  

A.207:  All righty.  

B.208:  I'll have to start doing this again some more [laughter].  

A.209:  Oh, it's fun, I ca-, 

B.210:  I, I don't know what, I've tried it several times with,
