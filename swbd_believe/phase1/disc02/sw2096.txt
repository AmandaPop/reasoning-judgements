===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you feel that, uh, drug testing is necessary in the work place?

B.2:  Um, I have mixed feelings about it.  Um, I don't particularly care for
people who take drugs and, uh, it's a possibility of having accidents in the
workplace, but, uh, I also feel like it's an invasion of privacy.

A.3:  Yeah, I have some basic concerns about it, as well.  Uh, not just the
invasion of privacy but the, the chance of false positive being reported.

B.4:  Right. 

A.5:  I have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant
experience at work.

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  And, uh, it gives you the, uh, the impression that the company really
doesn't trust the people that work for them.

B.8:  Right. 

A.9:  And you're pretty much, uh, assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by
the test results.

B.10:  Right, yeah, yeah, I have a lot of problems with it.  Um, I have been
tested, also, several times and, uh, in fact, it has always come up negative, I
mean, but that's no problem with it coming up negative, but, uh, I take
prescription drugs and I'm always afraid that those were going to come up and
show something on any of the tests.

A.11:  Yeah, well, they make allowances for that if you report that at the time
you take the test.

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  But, there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later.

B.14:  Right. 

A.15:  Or, if the prescription say, ran out, or if you are using something that is
older, older than the date on the package or whatever.

B.16:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, but I agree with you though, they are trying to, they
are saying that you are guilty until proven innocent,

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  and I don't really appreciate that at all. 

A.19:  Yeah, if they do come up a positive regardless of what, what it was that
they detected, uh, we're required to go attend a,

B.20:  Uh.

A.21:  counseling session. 

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And that gets put in your permanent files on your record.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  Which is not, not a real good thing to have on your, uh, employment
records.

B.26:  No, no, because this can follow you, uh, at other places too.  I was
reading this morning in the newspaper, [throat_clearing] where they have
companies or organizations out now, who will go and do background searches on
employees before they ever hire them.

A.27:  Sure.  

B.28:  And, if you get one of those false negative reportings and you're fired
from your job, that's going to carryover into other jobs.  Um. No matter, uh,
if it's truth or not.  So, yeah, it can stick with you a long time.

A.29:  Yeah, uh, according to, uh, to the way that, that our test is set up,
apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period.

B.30:  Right. 

A.31:  And, uh, they do it on a random basis, I am not sure how they can guarantee
that everybody's is going to be tested within five years, if it really is
random.

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  So, I'm not sure exactly what they base that on. 

B.34:  Well, uh, cause you work for T I, also right?

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  Yeah, because, uh, I think what they say that they'll take your name out of
the hopper, so that whatever is left in the hopper, you know, it's, it's,
that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested, you would be taken
out of there.  So that's, that's how they said they would do it over a five
year period.

A.37:  Well, I'm not sure exactly, if that's true though, because I know people
that have been tested more than one time --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and many have not been tested yet.

B.40:  Hm, well, it's only been what a year?  Two years?

A.41:  Uh, a couple of years, yeah.

B.42:  Huh-uh.  Yeah, it hasn't been, I know, I was called up right away
[laughter].

A.43:  It took them awhile to find me.

B.44:  [Laughter] It didn't, I was called it, let's see, we started testing in
January and I was called up right away in January.

A.45:  They did all, all the top level managers,

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  at first. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  And everybody else, uh, gets to take their turn. 

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  They called me in just a few months ago.

B.52:  Right, right.  You're right it wasn't a very pleasant experience.

A.53:  Right [laughter]. 

B.54:  Because, I felt like there was a camera watching. 

A.55:  Oh, no, [laughter] I never thought about that. I had some questions for
the, for the nurse who was conducting the test in the health center though.
Asked her if she enjoyed her job [laughter].

B.56:  What did she say?  [laughter].

A.57:  She thought it was different, you get to meet a lot of people [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter]  Yeah, on a continuing basis too. 

A.59:  Oh, I try, I try to introduce some levity there.

B.60:  [Laughter] You know, that was, that was a really interesting because it was
a great big room, the bathroom was, it was a great big room, and, uh, and I
remember the vents, you know,

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  just right over the top of the toilet.

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  And I just knew I was being photographed, you know [laughter]. I'm glad I
don't have to go through that experience again.

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  Yeah, well, there are a lot of people who express much stronger feelings
about it than I have,

B.68:  Yeah. 

A.69:  and, in fact, I know some people that probably will quit before being
tested,

B.70:  Right. 

A.71:  even though there is nothing to, uh, to worry about, as far as I know.

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  from the test results. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  It's just a matter of principle.  

B.76:  Well, uh, I guess growing up in the sixties, I don't know that particular
era and generation, I think about it, though I have some friends who are
occasional, uh, marijuana smokers --

A.77:  Oh yeah.

B.78:  -- and, you know, it's just a hangover from, uh, from that particular
generation and, you know, but, yeah, they're just adamant that they're not
going to be tested and they're going to fight it, uh, and try and see what
they can do.  That it's an invasion of privacy, but I don't particularly care
to, you know, care to get into drugs or anything else, so it's not a problem
for me but I, I can kind of understand from the other point of view.

A.79:  Yeah, well, I know some people that I suspect are casual users of
marijuana, as well, and I expect that they probably mended, uh, their ways in,
in response to the drug testing.

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  They no longer, uh, even use it on a casual basis. 

B.82:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.83:  Because, it's a matter of, of losing your job if you get caught, say, a
second time.

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  And even the first time for these people are, uh, oh, well on their way up
the technical ladder of management and they're jeopardizing their positions.

B.86:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I could really see that, uh, so they'll have to find other
means of relaxing and [laughter].

A.87:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.88:  But, the one thing too, that, that I have a problem with is that well, if
marijuana and cocaine and the other so-called, uh, illegal drugs, you know,
what about alcohol?

A.89:  Well, some companies have gone that far. 

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  T I has not. 

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  But, others have and they're setting themselves up for more lawsuits, I
think, than we are.

B.94:  I think so, yeah, yeah.  But you know, alcohol destroys so many families
now, so that's, that's what I thought was interesting that there are still
drugs out there and,

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  there are those socially acceptable drugs. 

A.97:  Right.  I don't mind so much the fact that they test people, but, not
questioning the validity of the results.

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  Is a problem because, uh, I, I fully expect that, that any test results
that comeback for me would negative, that,

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than
get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt, they
won't accept anything else.

B.102:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because you would be strongly into denial.

A.103:  Right. 

B.104:  [Laughter] It's just like well, we know you take it, we've got the positive
test results and you are going, I don't, I don't [laughter].

A.105:  Yeah, well, if you turn down the counselling, they will fire you.

B.106:  Right. 

A.107:  That's the condition. 

B.108:  Right. 

A.109:  Of employment.  

B.110:  Right.  I think there's some flaws in it.  I think their main objective is,
is good, you know, to make sure they have a drug free workplace, but I do
think that are a lot of flaws in there, and I understand the government will
not use that particular drug testing agency that T I is using.

A.111:  Is that right? 

B.112:  Yeah, because it's not as reliable as the government wants them to be.

A.113:  I thought that's the only one that the government does use. 

B.114:  No, well, I heard just the opposite. 

A.115:  I'm not sure. 

B.116:  [Laughter] So, I don't know.  It could just be rumors that are just spread
around.

A.117:  There are not too many places, uh, that do testing like that for the
government, uh, uh, where the government gives them full rein,

B.118:  Uh-huh. 

A.119:  to trust the results.

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  Because they have to prove on a continual basis that the, that they are
meeting their standard for false positives and what not.

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  They claim zero false positives ever, and I find that very hard to believe.

B.124:  Yeah, I find that hard to believe too. 

A.125:  Okay, well, uh, hum. Well. 

B.126:  Is our five minutes up? 

A.127:  Yeah, I'm sure it is. 

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  I think that about covers what we want to talk about. 

B.130:  Okay, well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.131:  I enjoyed it. 

B.132:  Okay, bye. 

A.133:  Okay, sure.  Bye.
