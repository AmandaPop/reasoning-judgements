============================================================================

A.1:  Well, Jerry, do you have a favorite team?

B.2:  Oh yeah, uh, of course the Dallas Cowboys.

A.3:  Cowboys.

B.4:  Yeah, yeah, I live, live and die with them.

A.5:  Okay, well they're rebuilding right now, yet.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  I think it's going to take them a couple more years before they can be a
really good team.

B.8:  Yeah.  Uh, of course, I guess, really the reason I like the Cowboys is
because S M U was my favorite team, uh, col-, [cough] pardon me, college team
and of course they started out with Don Meredith.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  And, uh, so, that, that tie there between S M U and the Cowboys,

A.11:  I think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this, uh, past year.

B.12:  Yeah, uh, Jerry Johnson surprised me.

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  I didn't think he was going to do very good,

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  Because I thought he was a college football coach and not a professional
coach.

A.17:  Okay, yeah I think a lot of people had that impression that, uh, that he
ought, he should have stayed in the college ranks, but, uh, looks like they're
going to do all right.  My fa-,

B.18:  Yeah, course he, he came after a legend too, Tom Landry so he had some, uh,
tough row to hoe there.

A.19:  Yeah big shoes to follow [laughter].

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Well my favorite team, is a, is a sentimental favorite, uh, the Green Bay
Packers.

B.22:  Yeah [cough].

A.23:  I grew up in that area and, have been following them,

B.24:  Pardon my for coughing, I've been coming down with a cold.

A.25:  been following the Packers ever since, uh, they won the first two Super
Bowls.

B.26:  Yeah, they used to have some, uh, bang up fights and dig in the trenches
with the Cowboys.

A.27:  Yeah, they sure did, I remember those.

B.28:  The Ice Bowl and the other, uh, games that they would play for the Super
Bowls.

A.29:  Yeah, I actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl.

B.30:  Yeah, at, uh, they, they had some good teams, though.

A.31:  They could have had a good year this year, uh, unfortunately the
quarterback, uh, controversy they had where Don ((McCowskey)) got hurt and
couldn't play most the season.  They spent an awful lot of money on him, too,
a million and a half dollars for a one year contract.

B.32:  Yeah, yeah.

A.33:  So, I don't know if he's going to be in shape to,

B.34:  Course they were, they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after
Lombardi, who could fill his shoes, but, uh,

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Who did you root for in the Super Bowl.

B.36:  I, I, didn't really have a favorite in the Super Bowl.  I just wanted to
see a good game.

A.37:  Yeah, both New York teams.

B.38:  I, I was tired of blow outs and it --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  Well that turned out to be a good game.

B.40:  -- it was, it was good to see a good, good, uh, championship game. 

A.41:  I think Buffalo is an up an coming team.  They're going to, they're showing
some real promise for the next, uh, few years.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  The Giants are always, uh, always there, perennially a good team.

B.44:  Yeah, well their coach has a lot to do with that, I think.

A.45:  I think they had a lot of luck there too, with Montana getting hurt in San
Francisco.

B.46:  Yeah, yeah.

A.47:  I think if, if he was, uh, healthy, San Francisco would have stomped those
guys.  It wouldn't have been much of a contest.

B.48:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, there's a lot of parity now compared to what it used
to be.

A.49:  Yeah, I think it's getting better, more competitive.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Uh, we see, uh, teams getting in the playoffs every now and then with five
hundred records or a little below even.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  The, uh, A F C Central is a lot like that with, uh, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati,
Cleveland, and Houston.  Nobody really dominated that division last year at
all.

B.54:  Yeah, another one of my favorites was in the old, uh, A F L, or the, uh,
uh, American Football League, the Dallas Texans, when they started.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  In fact they were, they out drew the Cowboys there for quite a while.

A.57:  Okay, I wasn't living here then, so, I can't talk much about that
[laughter].

B.58:  But, uh, but some of these, some of the, uh, I get a little disappointed
sometime with, with, uh the players now days compared with the old players.

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  It seems like most the players today are, are, playing for the money rather
than the, the, uh, fun and for the, uh, competition #that used to be in the
older days.#

A.61:  #Well there's no doubt about that.#  The money's there and the owners are
willing to pay if unfortunately.  Uh, and you get star players like, uh, like
Joe Montana making four million dollars a year,

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now.

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  And of course the, the people end up paying for it are the fans.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  Uh, it's no wonder ticket prices are so high.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  I don't go to games myself, uh, uh.

B.70:  I can't afford to go to them.

A.71:  No, you, you really can't, not when it costs twenty-six dollars a ticket
and, uh, so much for parking.

B.72:  You, you take, yeah, you take, just two just a man and wife by the time you
pay the tickets, the parking, uh, any kind of refreshments or anything there,
you can spend a hundred dollars right quick.

A.73:  Sure.

B.74:  And not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend.

A.75:  Yeah, I think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because, uh, they
are all wealthy people.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  And, uh, the expect that, uh, the average Joe is going to be able to, to go
to a game and, uh, pay for that type of entertainment.

B.78:  And also, I don't like the deal with the, uh Cowboys stadium where that
you, to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket.

A.79:  Sure.

B.80:  The only seats they have available are in the end zone.

A.81:  Yeah, it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can
out of this deal.  Uh, he's got his own T V show and he opened the Cowboy
Corral out in, in the parking lot there.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  And, uh, every, every opportunity there is to make a dollar, he seems to
be exploiting that.

B.84:  Yeah, but that's, that's true just about, eve-,

A.85:  I think there's still a lot of distrust for, uh, for an Arkansas man to
come here and own, uh, uh, Tex-, a team in Texas.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  And, uh, I don't think that's going to die very quickly.  He is getting
some support.  There were a lot of people that are, uh, that were skeptical
and the Cowboys are coming back, and they have a pretty good team.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Troy Aikman looks like to be, looks like he's got the star qualities for a
quarterback.

B.90:  Yeah, if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him, before
he,

A.91:  Yeah, well I was surprised at, at the, the way they drafted last year.  The
didn-, really didn't go for the, uh, big offensive lineman, or the defensive
lineman.  They're going for the skilled positions, uh, quarterbacks we really,
really didn't need that type of, uh, player.

B.92:  Yeah, and I, you know I think defense really is what wins, wins, uh, in,
the long run.  You can have the best half back there is or the best
quarterback but if they don't have any blocking, maybe, they can't do
anything.

A.93:  Yeah, they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up.  It's going
to be interesting to see what they do with them.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  So hopefully we'll see some more improvement.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  And, uh, the other teams in the N F C East, uh, they're, they're getting,
uh, older, uh, they're going to have to, like the Washington Redskins, uh,
that, that's an older team and they're going to have to start rebuilding
pretty soon too.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Looks like we'll reach a point of, uh, parity there where the Cowboys may
start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  I don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan, it might
be interesting to see.

B.102:  Uh, I don't know, I, I have mixed emotions about him.  Sometimes I like him
but at the same times I love to see somebody beat him.

A.103:  Yeah, he's, uh, one of #those guys you love to hate.#

B.104:  #He's got a mouth on him#.

A.105:  Kind of like, uh, Jerry ((Glanville)).

B.106:  Yeah, the man you love to hate.

A.107:  Yeah, they, they do pick up the image of a team though, 

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  uh, and they create a lot of excitement locally, so I think they're good
for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different
attitude.

B.110:  Yeah, but, uh, to me he's --

A.111:  But, uh, they're not my favorite people either.

B.112:  -- to me he's just like the Yankees, 

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  you love to see someone beat them but, uh they do have a good team.

A.115:  Well Buddy will probably get another job.

B.116:  Yeah, and I think old, uh, I think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback.

A.117:  Oh, he's great, I saw him play when he as at, uh, U N L V.

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  He was not only the quarterback but the punter.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  And he can punt the ball sixty yards, no problem.

B.122:  Yeah, yeah, I imaging he could play just about any position on the team
except maybe a defensive lineman.

A.123:  He's a very good athlete, that is true.  

B.124:  He's a very excellent athlete.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year,
unfortunately, they, uh, they got cut a little short.

B.126:  Yeah, well I don't they, uh, the games they lost, I don't think they lost
by any blowout.  I think they were all close games.

A.127:  No, I like the team, I really, really like the Eagles a lot, but, uh, Buddy
Ryan, [laughter] is not one of my favorite people.

B.128:  No.

A.129:  So, I wasn't too disappointed to see them lose.

B.130:  I, I'm wondering where he's going to wind up.

A.131:  I don't think he's going to get a head coaching job this next year.  He'd
be lucky if he can get an assistant, uh, job someplace.

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  Um, he's just one of those guys, he's created such a controversy in
Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now.

B.134:  Yeah, but, uh, he'll, he'll wind somewhere.

A.135:  I'm sure he will.  He's not going to have problems there.  If not in the N
F L then in one of the other leagues.

B.136:  Yeah, I'm kind of interested how this new, uh, league's going to, summer
league's going to fare.

A.137:  The World Wide Area Football League, waffle, or whatever they call it.

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  W L A F, yeah I think that the N F L is going to use that league as, uh,
uh, kind of like as a minor league to recruit players.

B.140:  Yeah, but the way people talk about, uh, there's not that, it won't be as
good as the N F L because, uh, there's not that many good, or quality football
players, I can't believe that.

A.141:  Not only that, but, they don't pay the money either.

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  Uh, it's very low, uh, scale compared to the N F L.

B.144:  But, uh, I still think there's plenty of good football players around that
just were not able to get on the N F L because the N F L's teams were just
full.

A.145:  Right, well, some people, I'm sure the, the more talented people in that
league are going to try to, uh, impress N F L scouts with their play in that
league.

B.146:  Yeah, yeah and wind up in the N F L.

A.147:  Possibly, but that's, that's, uh, one in a million shot.  

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  If they have the talent to be in the N F L they're going to get drafted and
make a pro team.  There aren't going to be too many people that, that'll make,
uh, the N F L out of, uh, W L A F.

B.150:  Yeah.

A.151:  It will be like Italian basketball with the, uh, with, with the, uh, N B A.

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  Some guys can come back and play in the N B A but most of them don't,
really don't have the physical skills or the talent.

B.154:  But, uh, I'm, I'm looking forward to the season.

A.155:  I think it will be a good year.  The Cowboys are showing constant ...
