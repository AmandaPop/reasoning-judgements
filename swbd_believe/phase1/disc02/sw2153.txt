=========================================================================

A.1:  What would you do about this pressing problem?   

B.2:  Well, I can relate to, uh, when I decided to choose a college.  Uh, it
really had very little to do with academics [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter].   

B.4:  Uh, I, I stayed at a, I went to a local, uh, university, that was close to
home.  It's about sixty miles away, went to the University of Wisconsin.

A.5:  Oh.   

B.6:  And, uh, besides it being, uh, close and being a, uh, major university in
the big ten, a prestigious conference, I joined the marching band.

A.7:  [Laughter].   

B.8:  And, uh, that really was, uh, a good deal of the motivation for going to
that, uh, college.

A.9:  So, with the band,

B.10:  Yeah, something to do, extracurricular activity.   

A.11:  What do you play?   

B.12:  I play the trumpet.   

A.13:  My, uh, my husband played music, he was involved in music all of his life
and went to Notre Dame, where he decided he was going to have a good time
[laughter],

B.14:  [Laughter]  Okay. 

A.15:  and th-, [laughter] and, [laughter] never went into the scholastic
bands, he went into, uh, bands on campus.  And he played music but I, I just
can't believe that, [laughter] he can play in a Notre Dame band when he was
good enough to do it.

B.16:  Uh-huh.    

A.17:  He went the other route.  I think, uh, I think, the advise I'd give to
parents would be to start when they're like four years old today [laughter].

B.18:  At least start saving.   

A.19:  [Laughter] Yeah, at least start saving and, and, start routing them to
where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead.

B.20:  I think most people, when they are in high school, are very undecided about
what course of study they want to take.  And they really don't have the
foggiest idea of what kind of career they want to get into,

A.21:  Yeah that's,  

B.22:  at least until, at least until they've been in college for a couple of
years.

A.23:  It's, um, I wish I had known more when I was, uh, choosing a college.  I, I
kind of did or I'd, I went off to, I grew up in California and I went off to
the University of Utah and didn't find the atmosphere there what I quite
expected, so, I came back and went to Cal State.  And, so, I kind of do what
you did only by route of another school.

B.24:  Uh-huh.   

A.25:  And I wish I had known more about what a school meant [laughter].

B.26:  Yeah, well, I, I started, uh, studying mathematics basically because I was
really good at that in high school, and, uh, by the time I was a sophomore, I
decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good
job.  They weren't hiring mathematicians at the time.

A.27:  Oh.   

B.28:  So, I started taking computer science courses and, uh, that become my major
course of study.  Uh, I finished a major in mathematics also, I had a double
major, but, uh, computer science is what got me a job.

A.29:  Right.   

B.30:  And it was very, uh, very much in demand for a career.   

A.31:  Well, it still is.   

B.32:  Uh, still is, that's true.  ((It's, uh)), very good choice. 

A.33:  I was just looking at a job sheet, that's about all that's in there.

B.34:  Uh-huh.    

A.35:  [Laughter].   

B.36:  So, but, I know many people who have changed majors several times in, uh,
college, uh, in fact, very few people finish in four years now.  Most,

A.37:  Do you think it, do you think it's well worth going to, uh, bigger school
or more well-known school?

B.38:  Um, I really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the
school, college, or university one chooses as long as they have a decent
program and they're, uh, uh, well known throughout the country.

A.39:  Right, right, the reputation,  

B.40:  Uh-huh.   

A.41:  that they have a good reputation.  Um, some of these, I didn't, the
college I went to was a big school but I was an English major and it, the
English major is very small, so, I had the benefit of being able to talk to my
professors and hangout with them yo-,

B.42:  Yeah.   

A.43:  and I really appreciated that.   

B.44:  Well, that does make a difference, uh, Wisconsin had a very good reputation
in, uh, computer science and engineering departments, and I'm sure that
helped, uh, helped me get job offers.  Uh, if you choose a school that's not
well known or does not have a very good curriculum in, uh, in the, in those
areas, uh, it could be difficult to, uh, make a career out of it.

A.45:  Right.  I think that's what I would tell parents [laughter].

B.46:  Kind of like, uh, going to S M U.  They have a reputation as being a party
school, and, uh, I just, [laughter], I have to question how worthwhile it is
to go to a school that, uh, really isn't, uh, that well known for their
academics.

A.47:  Hey, I'm headed there [laughter].   

B.48:  [Laughter] I took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself.

A.49:  Well, they have the master of liberal arts there.   

B.50:  Right.   

A.51:  And, so, I thought I would go and do that.   

B.52:  Okay.   

A.53:  It's the closest thing to a humanities degree that they let you do at
night.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  It's not the, I, I not into the Bohemian thing, you know, were I waitress
during, at night and go to school during the day.

B.56:  Yeah.   

A.57:  [Laughter].   

B.58:  I was just mak-, making [laughter], a point that some schools develop
certain reputations and,

A.59:  No, I, I agree, [laughter] but, but it's like, oh, you offer this degree,
okay, I'll go [laughter].

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  I've always wanted a masters degree but to get one in, in English or
anything other than an M B A, it's really difficult to do at night.

B.62:  Yeah, that, that's true, uh, I, I took, uh, like I said, I took, uh, couple
of semesters at S M U and it, at S M U in, uh, engineering courses, but, uh,
it really did conflict too much with, uh, with my work.

A.63:  Yeah.   

B.64:  It's very difficult to maintain a full-time job and try to take, uh,
courses, uh, in off hours.

A.65:  Right.  That's true.   

B.66:  So, I quit doing that several years ago.   

A.67:  And, and just lived the easy life.   

B.68:  Well, yeah, somewhat [laughter]. 

A.69:  [Laughter].   

B.70:  I wouldn't mind going back to school again if I thought it, I wasn't going
to get in trouble again with the, with the work.  It just takes too much time.

A.71:  That's true.   

B.72:  Going back full-time I think is, is the way to go.   

A.73:  Oh, it, it would be wonderful [laughter].   

B.74:  Yeah.  If one can afford to do that.   

A.75:  I know, little dreams [laughter]. 

B.76:  That's, back to the reason why, why I joined the band, that was my
entertainment while I was in school.

A.77:  Right.   

B.78:  Going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games, uh,
because when you're a poor, staving student, you don't have the, uh, cash flow
to, uh, entertain yourself [laughter].

A.79:  Right.   

B.80:  You have to find whatever means you can.   

A.81:  That's true, yeah.   

B.82:  Those events were always free.   

A.83:  I, I, uh, I picked up sweats for the track team.  I was the track, track
team manager.  We got, I got to ride the bus all over the state [laughter].

B.84:  [Laughter].    

A.85:  I got to see everything.   

B.86:  That sounds exciting.   

A.87:  So, it was fun.  It was l-, I did that for a long time.   

B.88:  Uh-huh. 

A.89:  It was a lot of fun.  So, I understand [laughter] that.  

B.90:  I'd recommend that if someone was trying to choose a college that they,
they get, uh, as much information on the schools as they can as far as what
curriculums they offer, and, uh, how reputable they are, and what kind of
reputation they have in the country.  And, uh, go from there.  The rest of
it's just personal preference.

A.91:  Yeah.   

B.92:  Whether you like the mascot or not, or whether [laughter] it's close by.

A.93:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's true.   

B.94:  I mean, uh, Wisconsin was only, ((up, uh)), sixty mile bus ride away from
my parents house.  So, it only took an hour to get back on, uh, oh, a couple
weekends a semester.  It was very convenient.  Not to mention being a public
university, it was, the tuition was, uh, much less expensive.

A.95:  Yeah, that was a good thing to look out for.   

B.96:  I looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship
there, but it would have only covered, uh, about a quarter of the cost of the
first, uh, year.  Which, uh, wasn't enough a motivation to, uh, to go there,
to commit to, to four years.

A.97:  Well, we're still writing checks for the loans, 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  for Notre Dame [laughter].

B.100:  Yeah, I'm sure that that's, uh, it's not, uh, cheap either. 

A.101:  But he's really happy he went there.   

B.102:  Well, that's good.  I, I got, uh, by with the minimal amount of financial
aid and was able to pay it all off within two years of graduation.

A.103:  Wow.   

B.104:  So, I was very pleased with that, of course, I lived like a pauper too
during that time.

A.105:  Right.   

B.106:  I know a lot of people that did, most couldn't afford to, to go to a movie.

A.107:  Yeah.   

B.108:  It was, uh, really living on a budget.   

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  Forced you to learn a few things, that's true.   

A.111:  But we had fun.   

B.112:  Tried to have fun.   

A.113:  [Laughter].   

B.114:  Being in the band was about the only entertainment I had.  

A.115:  Uh, I really, I miss college.  I had a good time.   

B.116:  That was fun.  Uh, lived on Tombstone pizzas and Coca-Cola [laughter].

A.117:  Yeah.  It was fun.  Well, I'll just wrap this up.   

B.118:  Okay.   

A.119:  Now that we've done our conversation for tonight.   

B.120:  Well, wonder if, if this advice was, uh, worth following for, uh, choosing
a school [laughter].

A.121:  [Laughter] Hopefully.  I, I gue-, I don't know what they're doing with the
conversations.

B.122:  They're being recorded and, uh, oh, put in, uh, I guess in Washington, D
C somewhere for reference for speech projects.

A.123:  Aren't, aren't they like put, taking the words and, and listening to the
dialect and,

B.124:  Yeah, 

A.125:  yeah.   

B.126:  that is true.  Based on where, where you come from and all, 

A.127:  {Very faint} Oh my.   

B.128:  where you're educated in the first, uh, ten years, I guess. 

@@A.129:  That would be interesting.  Well, it was good talking to you.

B.130:  Okay, I appreciate it.   

A.131:  Okay.   

B.132:  Enjoyed it.   

A.133:  Thanks a lot.   

B.134:  All right.   

A.135:  Bye-bye.   

B.136:  Bye.
