===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  

@A.2:  Okay, well what are we doing about recycling in our community?

B.3:  Well, [talking] in our area we just introduced the, um, citywide, uh,
Clean King Sport campaign, and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo.
He's a kangaroo, and, uh, we're setting up curbside recycling bins for the
city home owners, and several of our local businesses also have recycling
stations set up in their parking lots.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  And how about in your area?

A.6:  Well, in our, I live in a very small community outside of the Dallas area,
and, uh, we're just getting started.  As a matter of fact this last week we
got a notice in the mail from City Hall.  And they've informed us that, uh,
we'd be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two, but we're
going to start a separation of our refuse --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and separating the cans from the paper, et cetera.  And apart of that we
haven't really done much of anything except for, uh, separating your
newspapers and taking those to, uh, an area that they've designated.  Um, but
in, uh, in the office place we've been doing it for some time, separating our,
uh, uh, computer paper from our normal garbage.

B.9:  And so have we, we've been doing the computer paper,

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  and then we've also been doing our aluminum cans.

A.12:  What do they do with the cans?

B.13:  I, that's the one thing I don't know.  I, I don't know if they take them to
the local aluminum, uh, recycling plant --

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  -- uh, just locally or, or what.  I assume that's what they would do.

A.16:  I would assume so, and then maybe do something with the money,

B.17:  I would hope,

A.18:  for charity or something.

B.19:  Yeah, I, I think that's what they do, I think they, they give that to
charity.

A.20:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  And, and, uh, other than the work place and here
at home, um, I don't know too much is going on in the community.  I know that
in Plano, it's a larger city in the area, they, they, uh, I believe about a
month or two ago, they started having the citizens separate their refuse.

B.21:  Okay.

A.22:  And they've even, um, got a particular huge, uh, wastecan that they have to
use.

B.23:  Oh, for each different product?

A.24:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.25:  Oh, okay.

A.26:  That makes it kind of easier, then you remember --

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  -- you know.

B.29:  I was going to say I've seen in some of these, um, local mail order
catalogs,

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  they've got trash can dividers for, for home owners who don't have those.

A.32:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.33:  It, it, it like cuts your trash can in half so you could put cans on one
side and, and other on the other side.  So.

A.34:  Other side.  

B.35:  So,

A.36:  That's a good idea.

B.37:  I think, I think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon.

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  Um, as far as, you know, should more be done, I think there's, I think
there's always more that can be done.

A.40:  I think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning,
don't you think?  [throat_clearing].

B.41:  Yes.  I've even heard them talking about, uh, recycling Freon from
refrigerators --

A.42:  Oh really.

B.43:  -- refrigeration systems.  Yes, there are pe-, there are companies that
recycle their Freon.

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  And, um, I'm sure there are a lot chemicals that, that can be recycled,
that,

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  there's a lot of,

A.48:  I know the motor oil.

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  We have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own
oil at home.  I [throat_clearing],

B.51:  Now, that's, we, we don't have that, that's neat.

A.52:  Uh, K-Mart does that.  Some of the K-Marts in the area where, I don't have
any except for the lawn motor, lawn mower --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- um, machine oil, because I always have my oil changed out of the house,
but.

B.55:  But you'd think that, uh, garages could do that.

A.56:  Yes, I'm sure they do, uh.

B.57:  That would be great.

A.58:  Uh-huh, because that's something that doesn't go back into the soil, does
it --

B.59:  No.

A.60:  -- doesn't break down.

B.61:  It's, it's really bad to not break down.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  I, uh, saw an article the other day in Ann Landers that talked about how
long it takes, like a cigarette butt, to decompose, and I think it was
between twenty and thirty years.

A.64:  Is that right?

B.65:  Yes. 

A.66:  I had no idea.

B.67:  I, I was, I was flabbergasted, and I think plastic was, um, plastic, never
--

A.68:  Never breaks down. 

B.69:  -- totally, total breaks down.

A.70:  Um, the Styrofoam.  

B.71:  That's the one that never did.  

A.72:  Yeah, never did some,

B.73:  Yep, plastic took fifty years.

A.74:  Fifty years.  

B.75:  Yeah.

A.76:  Um, I know that I had heard that, uh, McDonald's has gotten so much flack
about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work
on something #other than that.#

B.77:  #They, they have here.#

A.78:  Oh, have they?

B.79:  Yes.  I used to get my Egg McMuffin in one of those little Styrofoam --

A.80:  Uh-huh. 

B.81:  -- cup, uh, cups like, and now they wrap them in paper.

A.82:  Do they?

B.83:  Yes.

A.84:  Well, good.

B.85:  So I was really glad to see that.

A.86:  I think they're one of the businesses at large that do things like that.
They're more aware of it.

B.87:  They, they are good.

A.88:  Or at least they try and do something about it first.

B.89:  I think they recognize their, their position as a community leader --

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  -- and really work to keep that going.

A.92:  I think you're right.

B.93:  So, and, and the only other thing I've seen has been the setting up a
compost heap in your own backyard.

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  But that's, that's hard if you don't have a big yard or if you live in an
apartment [laughter].

A.96:  [Laughter] (( )) if you live in an apartment, right.

B.97:  That might not go over real well.

A.98:  Right, that's for sure.

B.99:  So.

A.100:  Well.

@@B.101:  Let's see, has it bee-, I think, have we been our five minutes?

A.102:  Uh, I really don't know.  I haven't been timing it (( )).

B.103:  I know the,

A.104:  [Throat_clearing].

B.105:  last time I did this they came on and said y-, you have exceeded your
ten minutes.

A.106:  Oh, okay [laughter].

B.107:  Hang up within the next thirty seconds, so.

A.108:  Oh, all right.

B.109:  Um.

A.110:  Well, I guess we'll just say good-bye then.

B.111:  Okay, and, and I think we just hang up, I don't think we have to do
anything else.

A.112:  Okay.

B.113:  But it's been very nice talking to you.

A.114:  Thank you, nice to talk,

B.115:  Okay.

A.116:  to you also.

B.117:  All right, bye-bye.

A.118:  Bye-bye.
