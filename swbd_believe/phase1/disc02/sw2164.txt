===========================================================================

@A.1:  [Static] Well, oh, our topic is capital punishment.  I guess, uh, one
thing is to compare, uh, how it is, maybe, here in Texas versus, uh, maybe
your part of the country.

B.2:  Yeah, I, you know, I'm not sure if we have the death penalty here, to be
perfectly honest with you.  Hold on a second.  {Speaking to someone away from
the phone} Do we have the death penalty in Rhode Island?  {Person not on phone
answers no.}  {Back on phone} No, okay, no we don't.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  But, you know, um, I, I have some feelings about it in the sense that I
feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and it's a really
heinous crime, I feel, like the Bible says, an eye for an eye.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Describing a heinous crime being like murder or?

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  What other ones would be?

B.8:  You know, something really, a serial killer, or, you know, someone who
really has no remorse, you know, that, that just does these things, uh, I
don't know, without feeling guilty about it at all, you know, and the, and
their, we, in fact we have an example going on right now with this, uh, school
teacher, involved some teenagers --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- into, uh, committing murder, getting rid of her husband.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  I don't know if you're familiar with it, Pamela Smart in New Hampshire.

A.13:  Don't think I've heard of that one.

B.14:  See, now in a situation like that, the boys are only sixteen years old, and
they were sexually involved with her, and I think, like at that particular
point she was twenty-three.  You know, so she wasn't really that much older
than them, and being a boy at that age, I think that they're very, uh, you
know, let's face it, that's at a point in your life when you're just starting
to realize all the things of life.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  I think she probably had a lot of influence on them, and they probably
would have never done something like that if it wasn't for the crime of
passion type of thing a-,

A.17:  Yeah, we had one, uh, course in Texas they, uh, used to string them up.
Now they --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- got more, uh, civilized and, uh, give them lethal injection.  So,

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  we, we definitely do have, uh, capital punishment.

B.22:  Now see, I agree with that.  I, I don't think a person should be
electrocuted or hung or, you know, in other words, I believe that they should
be punished and done away with, on one hand, like I say, if they're, if
they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  But if there's, the, the other, the
other hand, where you say, you know, if there's just that slim chance that
they didn't do it, and then, you know, spend the time, say life imprisonment,
then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty, you
know.

A.23:  Yeah.  There was one here recently that comes to mind that's about a woman
that, uh, this is ridiculous, I mean, it's almost, uh, it'd be funny if it
wasn't so, so sad.  I mean --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- this woman, this woman went out and hired somebody to, uh, to, uh, kill
another mother.

B.26:  Oh, that's the cheerleader thing?

A.27:  Yeah, have you heard about that one?

B.28:  Oh, yes, that was on T V here.

A.29:  Yeah, isn't that something.

B.30:  It made national, um,

A.31:  I didn't know it made the national news.

B.32:  Yeah, really.

A.33:  That was something, wasn't it.  Uh, it's unbelievable.  This,

B.34:  But you know, I, I, I saw, I can't figure out what people are doing any
more.

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  I mean, it's getting so bad, and I don't think unless that the cri-, that
the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something, because
they know they'll be punished.  You know what I'm saying.

A.37:  Well, that brings up, I guess, part of what would be a question is, uh, you
know, is, I guess you feel like that's a deterrent in capital punishment,
should be.

B.38:  Yeah, you know, and I, I don't know if it would be, but I mean, we don't
know that it wouldn't, either.

A.39:  Well, it, uh, i-, must be, I think it's a matter of degree, and, uh --

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  -- of course, uh, course it varies from case to case or individual to,

B.42:  And the other point someone made at one, one time was that if someone is
guilty of a terrible crime, or they're a serial killer, or mass murderer, that
if they're in prison, that gives you the chance to, um, get into the person's
mind to find out, uh, what led them to the point that they were at when they
committed the crime, to, uh, try to understand how their mind worked, to
prevent, you know, another person --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- from getting into the same situation.  But, I don't know, you know,
maybe you could do that for a certain period of time, but, I mean, how long
does that kind of a thing take, you know, to, to, uh, say, to question the
person or to get into their head.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  You know, even if it took five years, I think that if at that time you, you
feel that they were guilty or that they were of sound mind where they knew
what crimes they were committing, I mean, people know what they're doing.

A.47:  Huh.

B.48:  You know, that, that I really do, I believe that, uh, capital punishment
should be there.  The prisons are overcrowded.

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  It costs the taxpayers a lot of money.

A.51:  That's one thing down here, we certainly have a problem with overcrowded
prisons.

B.52:  Yeah.  I'll tell you, in the state of Rhode Island, it was so bad, that the
intake center that they have to house the, the criminals before they go to
the, uh, penitentiaries and stuff, uh, were overcrowded, and the judge fined
the state thousands of dollars a day --

A.53:  Huh.

B.54:  -- to build a bigger intake center.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  So I mean, it, it's like, where does this all stop.

A.57:  Well, they're releasing them, uh, early here.

B.58:  Exactly.  Same thing here, and that's, that's what they did.

A.59:  And, and then, uh, then you hear about ones that are on early release going
out --

B.60:  Yeah --

A.61:  -- and committing a,

B.62:  -- in fact the news tonight they had, uh, someone come on, a seventy-three
year old man, they, they had gotten into a housing for the elderly, and, and
the person who perpetrated the crime went in with someone who had a relative
there.  And, uh, apparently this, this person was on drugs, and the old man
was an invalid, and he was in an elevator, and he died for twelve dollars.

A.63:  Um, well I tell you what, I think that, uh, you know, this may, this may be
a cause rather the actual topic but, uh, I think that a lot of this is caused
by the steady diet of violence they seem --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- to want to be, uh, you know, showing on movies and television.

B.66:  Yeah, and I also think that the, uh, fact that a lot of mothers are working
today, and that children are not bonded to the parents.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And other people take the responsibility for raising these kids, or the
children are left out, you know --

A.69:  That's true.

B.70:  -- on their own, and they don't really feel the family, um, closeness that
we had when, oh, when I was growing up, and my, my mother didn't work, you
know, and when she did a part time job, she was there.  You know it wasn't
like she,

A.71:  Well, well, what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on, uh, you know,
the children.

B.72:  Getting mothers back in the home.

A.73:  Well, yeah --

B.74:  You know, kind of.

A.75:  -- well I don't know if that's going to be necessarily workable, but it
would be, uh --

B.76:  Oh, I know.

A.77:  -- one way.

B.78:  I know.

A.79:  It certainly has to start with the children.

B.80:  How do you feel about it?  Do you, do you think there should be capital
punishment?

A.81:  Yes, I do.  I think it's, uh, something that unfortunately, uh, at this
stage of the game, I would hope that at some point we would become, you know,
civilized enough where we could do away with it.  But as of right now and the
way things are, I think it's, uh, something we just have to have {/static}.

B.82:  Yeah, I, I do myself.  I really think that it's, it's all well and good to,
uh, be a do-gooder or to, to, um, you know, try to spare everyone's life, but
when someone has no regard for another person [throat_clearing] excuse me,
their property or their personal, uh, being or their families, I mean, you
know, when whole families are killed and [voices] --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- yet you have someone who'll commit a crime of robbery and spend
twenty-five years in jail.  I mean, to me, it's like we have things messed up
somehow.

A.85:  [Laughter].

B.86:  Y-, you know what I mean?

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  And, and like this banking crisis thing where people have stolen millions
of dollars and they're out walking around.

A.89:  Huh, well I just, uh.

B.90:  I think all our laws are really screwed up.

A.91:  [Laughter].

B.92:  I do.  I don't know what to do about it.  I wish I did.  But, uh,

A.93:  Well, I think it comes back to, uh, starting with the children once you get
them, you know --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- if you get them where they have a sense of values and, uh --

B.96:  Yeah, exactly.

A.97:  -- you know, that, uh,

B.98:  Morals.

A.99:  that's what it takes.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  That people start, uh, oh, you know, (( )), you know, they start to see
this violence in a steady diet and, uh, it's to be, uh, dis-,

B.102:  Did you ever see the program, uh, WHY DOES JOHNNY KILL?

A.103:  Uh.

B.104:  About these young children who were not even like sixteen years old, they
were eleven and twelve and fourteen and fifteen year olds, and they, they
actually committed murders.  And the question was whether to try them as
adults --

A.105:  All right.

B.106:  -- or as children.

A.107:  Can't remember that.
	
B.108:  Or whether or not to, uh, institute, you know, capital punishment where it
was necessary and things like that.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  That has to,

A.111:  That's a tough one, too.

B.112:  Yeah, I mean, what would you do in a situation like that?  You say, well
he's only ten years old.  But the crime he committed is that of an adult.

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  He made that decision.

A.115:  We had a personal experience with something like that.  It wasn't, didn't
go as far as murder, but this, this girl, young girl, had, uh, she had gotten
hold of a gun, and she came around to the office where my wife worked and she
was, she had this mental problem with, with a doctor she works for, and, uh,
he was, she was just after him, you know --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- and the cops would pick her up.  And there wasn't a thing they could do.
You know, they'd take her down to the juvenile hall, and then they'd have to
let her go --

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  -- and she'd be back, huh, doing it.

B.120:  Imagine.  So see this is what I'm saying.  And even with, uh, people who
are mentally incompetent, you know, uh, like deranged.  It's so hard to get
people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded.  So you have people
walking the streets that are child molesters, or, uh,
