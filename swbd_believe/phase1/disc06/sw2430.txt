============================================================================

A.1:  [Breathing] Well, what is it that you prefer to provides as far as
maintenance on your vehicle?

B.2:  I do all my own maintenance, as a matter of fact I just finished putting a
timing chain in my wife's Toyota [laughter].

A.3:  Wow.   

B.4:  [Laughter].   

A.5:  How about that,  

B.6:  I do, I do all of that myself.   

A.7:  that, I'm not quite as mechanically inclined, although that some of the,
the basic things that you need to do for, uh, the maintenance of your warranty
on a vehicle,

B.8:  Oh, sure, sure.

A.9:  is stuff that you can do yourself ((just the oil, uh, changed)) and
things of that nature.  That's about where I, my expertise ends, in, in that
category, just you know,

B.10: Well, there's two things that drive that up here, one is we, is, the lack
of, good service people --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- because there just aren't, are not any left hardly around up in this
area --

A.13:  I believe that.

B.14:  -- and the other thing is the cost, it's almost prohibitive to bring it to
a deal.

A.15:  Boy I'll tell you, I just got my car back from a dealer, and when it was in
there I had them just go ahead (( )) change the oil and filter, thirty-four
dollars.

B.16:  Oh, sure, sure.  The, the price is astronomical, but what I do is,
[breathing] I like to do this okay, and I and, I, I like to play with
mechanics, and that's, I, I really, I've done that all my life so,

A.17:  Huh.  Well, that's, uh, that's quite a savings,

B.18:  And the --  

A.19:  having that talent.   

B.20:  -- the little, the little Toyota is a nineteen eighty three so [laughter],

A.21:  How many miles ((has it got)),  

B.22:  I really don't have too much to lose if I mess it up too bad [laughter].

A.23:  [Laughter] now what did you just replace?

B.24:  The timing chain, well, the camshaft timing chain.   

A.25:  Now I'm not even familiar with what that, where that is.   

B.26:  Okay it's in the front of the engine, uh, say like directly behind the
radiator over the water pump.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And it, it drives from the crankshaft, it drives, uh, a chain that drives
the camshaft, which is an overhead cam, in most foreign cars --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and, uh, i-, it was getting kind of worn, the car had a hundred and one
thousand miles on it, and it was getting a little noisy so,

A.31:  Huh.   

B.32:  Not so much for the noise, but if it were to jump a tooth or something of
that nature, I would meet serious problems on the freeway, and I didn't want
to chance --

A.33:  Sure.   

B.34:  -- having driving the car like that so,

A.35:  Well, how much, how long did it take to replace that?   

B.36:  Oh, three nights, I worked on it three nights, and about four hours on last
Saturday, and, I just put it in, in the garage and worked on, I, I have I new
Oldsmobile so, [laughter] --

A.37:  Uh-huh.   

B.38:  -- uh, i-, it's, it's just a little hobby, and if it's not too cold outside
and the weather's starting to get pretty nice and --

A.39:  Oh, sure.

B.40:  -- if it's not too too cold out I can go out and work on it, don't have
heat in the garage or anything but,

A.41:  Uh-huh.  How much would something like that cost in the garage?

B.42:  uh, [lipsmack] well, I figured if I had it done in the garage at the
Toyota dealer, I would be looking at at probably three or four hundred
dollars.

A.43:  ((Jimminy)).

B.44:  Between the gasket kit, and the new distributor cap I put on, and the new,
uh, chain and the labor --

A.45:  And how much do you think the parts was by itself?

B.46:  -- well, the parts to, to me, I spent twenty-two dollars on the parts.

A.47:  Oh, really.   

B.48:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

A.49:  Wow.   

B.50:  So, I really, I really don't have, heart burn at all with doing it myself
over four nights,

A.51:  Oh gosh.

B.52:  kind of tied the car up if four days, but we're fortunate we didn't need
it.

A.53:  Yeah, fou-, at a hundred dollars a night that's not, still not too bad.

B.54:  No, I know, but you know, you, you save the markup on the parts, and of
course you buy upon them whole sale from the parts store, and, and you can
save a little bit there, and you can save an awful lot on the labor, which is
high today, and like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do
and --

A.55:  Sure.

B.56:  -- I, I don't blame the garage people, it's just that its very very hard to
find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work.

A.57:  Uh-huh.   

B.58:  All of our so called garages are now convenience stores that sell gasoline,
and they really don't do any repairs --

A.59:  Exactly.

B.60:  -- anymore, so, you know, your, your, your, your almost tied to the dealer
to go back to them and, well, it seems like they're just swamped with work, 
so,

A.61:  Yeah, well, fortunately I just well replaced the, the power antenna, uh,
you know, it kind of dumb having the, garage door, I drove out before the door
was completely up, and the radio on,

B.62:  Sure.   

A.63:  so it took off the antenna --  

B.64:  Sure.

A.65:  -- but the mast itself cost, uh, thirty-fou-, two dollars --

B.66:  Uh-huh.   

A.67:  -- and, I went, I called the dealer and they wanted two hundred and twenty,
to put it in --

B.68:  Sure,  

A.69:  -- and --

B.70:  and that's, that's held in by two bolts and a bracket --  

A.71:  -- gosh and then I went to,

B.72:  -- ((and then plug)) a wire in the bottom of ((it)),  

A.73:  well, it, I, I looked at it myself to see if I could do it myself,
because I, you know, I, I feel I'm, s-, pretty competent and handy --

B.74:  I'm sure,

A.75:  -- but, un-,  

B.76:  you could have,  

A.77:  un-, unfortunately they buried this one in the sixty-six Mazdas,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  you have to remove the dash, and the fuse box to get to the motor --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- and, so they say there's, uh, three hours of labor just to uncover,
where the, the metal shaft goes in, because it goes through the, [breathing]
through the door in-between the windshield and the drivers side door and comes
out above the drivers head.

B.82:  Okay, yeah, that's one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah,

A.83:  Yeah, so it's terribly engineered [laughter]. 

B.84:  yeah, [laughter].  Well, that, that's another problem, you know, and if
you don't have all these special tools, of course, like I said, we're very
fortunate with the older cars, we can work on ((them, what, uh,)) --

A.85:  Everything was visible.

B.86:  -- if you don't have all the special tools, and the technology, I, I would
hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them.

A.87:  Oh yeah.   

B.88:  I imagine that would be a bear to work on, you know, [breathing] uh,

A.89:  Anymore just putting everything on a chip is, your going to have to replace
the chip unless you have the tools,

B.90:  Sure.

A.91:  to diagnose what's the problem with the chip.   

B.92:  Uh-huh. Yes that's absolutely true. [sniffing].  Uh, have you done, have you
done much repair work yourself, ot-, other than just routine maintenance like
oil changes and stuff,

A.93:  I have a, a seventy-nine Mus-, uh, Mazda,

B.94:  yeah,  

A.95:  R X seven, first year of the rotary engine that I used to do, I used to
work on, because it, you know, back seventy-nine if I was to do something,
screw it up, electrically, uh, I co-, I handled everything.  I put in
antenna's there, you know, the antenna, the replacements parts,

B.96:  Sure.

A.97:  all that kind of thing.  But when it came to ever giving any kind of tune
up's or things like that I'd take it into the shop, anything basic,

B.98:  That rotary engine always fascinated me, I was, I was always ((enthralled))
by the rotary engine, I think that's a neat idea, and I surprised we haven't
gone that way, more and,

A.99:  yeah, and they just stop making them now.   

B.100:  Yeah, yeah.

A.101:  So it's kind of interesting when, it's, work great smooth --

B.102:  It's a smooth running quite car, I, I just, I don't know why, well, perhaps
the, the tooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know.

A.103:  -- I suppose, but I had a hundred and, twenty-eight thousand on it when I
sold it.

B.104:  The, uh, the automotive industry is in dire need of something in this, in
this country, and it's too bad --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- uh, the Toyota we bought, I, I bought second hand, I did not buy it 
new --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- uh, but if you look at what's in that little car, and, as opposed as to
what's in some of the American cars, you can see where we're probably a half a
step behind, and I think, I think we're trying to do something to correct
that, but I think we got away from ((us)) a little bit.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  (( )) but I, I, I just like I say, to work on it myself, I, one I like to
do that, uh, I, I think I would do all of the maintenance, I change my own
oil, and I change of course, spark plugs and stuff like that, that's routine,
that I, I would call routine maintenance once a year,

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  I do that every fall, I get ready for the winter, and I even lubricate
the car myself.

A.113:  Wow.

B.114:  Because I have a, I have means of, of running them up on jack stands, and,
and you know, I, I have a ((creep board)) I crawl on, underneath it, so it's
not a big deal.

A.115:  Sure, sure.  

B.116:  But even today, like with your waste oil, when you drain the oil, and
change the oil, now I have to bring it to a disposal center.  I, I no longer
can put it in, in the trash, you know,

A.117:  Oh really?   

B.118:  or, or in a container.  Yeah, we have, we're really on an ecology kick up
here I guess all the rest of the country and,

A.119:  Well that's good.

B.120:  And they really, really, they come down and pound you real hard if they
catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the
lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here, and it really
makes a mess around, around New England.

A.121:  Sure.

B.122:  So we have take the oil to, uh, a, uh, a disposal center that's an E P A
you know, authorized disposal center --

A.123:  Uh-huh.   

B.124:  -- and they gladly take it, but they only take it like for two hours on a
Saturday morning, you know,

A.125:  Right.

B.126:  and it's, it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that.  But I think
it's still worth it in the long run, because oil you can buy for eighty-five
cents a quart, but if you buy that same oil at a dealer, it's going to cost
you probably two dollars a quart,

A.127:  Sure, sure.

B.128:  and, and now the labor to put it in --

A.129:  Of course, of course.

B.130:  -- and, uh, I, I again, I like to do that, I, I would do, all the
maintenance on my car if I could --

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  -- uh, even into major things just to keep our car ((longer)) because I
don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them --

A.133:  Right.   

B.134:  -- in two years or three years, ((and of course, I was never in a position
where I could)) trade my car off every two years.

A.135:  [Laughter] Well, it seems like you've got a very valuable talent.

B.136:  Uh, well, I, I, like I said, I've done mechanics all my life, and I do that
with the company so, [breathing] uh, I'm a senior engineer for them, so,

A.137:  Oh great. 

B.138:  [Laughter] mechanics, and I, I just, uh, I enjoy it, I really, it's like
a diversion for me.  I, I think if I had to do it, if I had to do automotive
repair, or, or anything, I ((want)) to do woodwork too and it's a diversion
because I know I really don't have to this [laughter] okay, so I think like
that because I know I don't have to do this, but if, if I were forced to do
it, that may be a different situation.

A.139:  Uh, yeah, that's true.  Well it's been goods talking to you.

B.140:  It sure has, I really appreciate your call, and, uh, [laughter] it's nice
to talk with you folks from, from down in the the main office area,

A.141:  [Laughter] every once in a while down here at the main site,

B.142:  yeah sure, how's your weather?  It's pretty good?   

A.143:  Oh it's been beautiful.

B.144:  Yeah, we're just starting to get some nice little warm weather up here in
New England, it got up to seventy today, that's a good sign,

A.145:  There you go.

B.146:  we, we've been running around twenty in the morning,

A.147:  Starting to defrost.

B.148:  getting a little cold and, it's too cold to work on automobiles outside
generally, but we had the last few days been pretty nice.

A.149:  Well, that's great.

B.150:  I appreciate your call, and you enjoy yourself,

A.151:  You too.   

B.152:  and if your up this way, look me up in ((Attenborough)).  

A.153:  All-, ((all righty)). Good-bye.   

B.154:  Okay sir, thank you again.  

A.155:  [Laughter].
