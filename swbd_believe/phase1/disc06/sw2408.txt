===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have pets?

B.2:  Yeah, I've got, uh, three cats, uh.

A.3:  Three cats.

B.4:  Yeah, me and my roommate have a little business on the side,

A.5:  I see.

B.6:  and we, we breed, uh, cats.

A.7:  Oh, really.  That's interesting.

B.8:  Yeah, it's, it's,

A.9:  What breed do you, do you deal in?

B.10:  Well, just about anything we get our hands on.

A.11:  I see.

B.12:  Right now we've got a, uh, a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan
Persian.

A.13:  Oh, my.

B.14:  And, uh, ((well)), they're a lot of fun.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  We're not in it as a business.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  We just, we like cats.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And we decided, well, if we're going to have them, we might as well get
some purebreds.

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  And maybe make a little money,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  on the side.

A.25:  Yeah.  I've never, never done pets, you know, as a, for breeding purposes.
I've just, you know, usually always had a pet of some kind around.  We're,
((uh)), currently we have two cats.  I've got a big old seventeen pound black
male alley cat [laughter],

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  and I've got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the Humane
Society.  She's the cutest little thing.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  Then I have a twelve year old Dachshund that's, gosh, she's one of the
family, absolutely.

B.30:  Yeah.  A friend of mine had a Dachshund and it's the same way.

A.31:  Yeah, she's twelve years old.  She pretty well, you know, sets the ground
rules for the household.  Lo-,

B.32:  Yeah, and the cats listen, right?

A.33:  That's right.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  Lo-, the little dog loves to travel.  Of course she's dead asleep before we
get to the end of the block and she never, you know, she sleeps the whole
time.  But she loves to travel.

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  Cats, of course, don't care too much to travel.

B.38:  Uh, one of mine does.  The Himalayan Persian, the little Himmy --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- if I take her to the vet --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I used to put her in her, in a cage,

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  and take her down,

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  but now I just carry her out to the car,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  and she crawls up in my, uh, up on my shoulder --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and just watches everything.

A.51:  That's amazing.

B.52:  Yeah, she, she enjoys the car.

A.53:  We've never had a cat, of course, like I said I guess the only time I've
ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier.  Maybe, maybe if we didn't
put them in carriers, maybe they would enjoy it more.  I don't know.

B.54:  Probably.  I think it's the carrier that scares them.

A.55:  Probably so.

B.56:  Now, on the other hand, the Bombay hates the car.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  She'll, uh, when I bring that cage out, she knows what's going to happen.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  It's, I don't know.  Maybe it's the, maybe it's the thought about the vet
that worries her [laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter] Uh-huh, could be [laughter].  Could be, yeah.  That, our little
Tabby cat is the only cat that I've ever seen or had that she absolutely hates
to be picked up.  She would rather just do anything than be picked up.  More
normally, you know, you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  She just absolutely hates it.  I don't know if it's,

B.64:  Will, will she crawl up in your lap?

A.65:  Yes, she does that, but she, yeah,

B.66:  Yeah, some of them, some of them are like that.  They, uh, they --

A.67:  When she wants to, of course.

B.68:  -- yeah, they, they don't want to be held,

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  but, but whenever they want to sit in your lap,

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  they want you to be, uh, open to that.

A.73:  That's right.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  Yeah, she does that, that's true.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  That's true.

B.78:  Yeah, the little Turkish Van's like that.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  Pick her up and boy, those claws come out --

A.81:  Yes.

B.82:  -- and sticks her arms straight out,

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  with the claws just extended,

A.85:  Just tense, yeah.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Absolutely.

B.88:  Yeah.  S-, silly cat.

A.89:  Yeah, we've had our, our two cats, uh, declawed because we keep them in the
house all the time.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  Well, actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard
occasionally.  I have an eight foot, uh, security type fence out in the
backyard.  She just,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  But our black cat has never, never once been outside and has no interest in
going outside.  You can actually leave the door open.  He'll come to the door
and sit down but he never goes outside.

B.96:  Yeah, most, mine generally stay in the windows.

A.97:  Uh-huh, they love to watch the birds.

B.98:  Yeah, along the side, one side of our house there's nothing but trees,

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  and bushes --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- and we've got lots of squirrels,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  and birds,

A.105:  Oh, yeah.

B.106:  and all that around here, and they just,

A.107:  They enjoy that.

B.108:  they'll sit there in that window for hours watching,

A.109:  Uh-huh, that's right, just hypnotized.  Yeah.

B.110:  all this, yeah.  And they'll go to the doors and stand up on the screen
door,

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  looking out.

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  But, uh, they're not too interested in going outside.

A.115:  Yeah, our little cat just wants, wants out maybe once a day, that's about
all.

B.116:  Yeah, the Bombay, uh, actually went through one of the screens last week --

A.117:  Huh.

B.118:  -- trying to get out.

A.119:  Huh.

B.120:  Uh, so I had to go round her up.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  But, uh, yeah, they're, they're fun.

A.123:  Yeah, my wife's a cat person.  Until we married, I'd never really, oh, we'd
had a cat occasionally, you know, and left it outside.  Most of the time we
lived,

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  in kind of a rural area.  My wife's a real cat person.  One time, not
when we were together, but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats.

B.126:  Um, sounds like my next door neighbor.

A.127:  Yeah.  Boy, I try to keep her away from the Humane Society.  She always
want to bring something home, you know.

B.128:  Oh, that's my problem.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  I'll go down to the, uh, S P C A,

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  or the Humane shelter and I, I feel so sorry,

A.133:  Yeah.

B.134:  for them and I just want to, I want to bring them all home.

A.135:  That's what she does, yeah, that's right.

B.136:  (( )) it's so pathetic to see,

A.137:  Yes.

B.138:  them down there.

A.139:  It really is.

B.140:  I'm just, uh, it irritates me the way people mistreat animals,

A.141:  Uh-huh.

B.142:  and, and they don't do it intentionally.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  They just, they're just doing it.  They go [beep] out and they
think, oh, wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty.

A.145:  Get a kitten, yeah, uh-huh.

B.146:  And they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything,

A.147:  That's right.

B.148:  and it has kittens and they can't support it, and they take them down
there,

A.149:  That's right, or move off and leave them.

B.150:  and they end up getting, or move off and leave them.  And they, they end,
I don't know where this, my next door neighbor had a, had a dead cat next to
his front porch.

A.151:  Oh, gosh. [barking].

B.152:  Yeah.  I'd seen the cat around here before.

A.153:  Uh-huh.

B.154:  I thought it belonged to somebody, but I have no idea what killed it.

A.155:  Good, grief.  May have been poisoned or something.

B.156:  It might have been.  Might have gotten hold of something bad or,

A.157:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.158:  we had a cold snap here not too long ago.  It may have frozen out there.

A.159:  Could be, could be.

B.160:  I sort of doubt it.  Cats know how to take care of themselves.

A.161:  No, not if they've never been out in any ((weather)),

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  I wouldn't think so, especially,

B.164:  Well, this, this one was definitely outdoor cat because I saw him all the
time.

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  And I suspect somebody had just had him and moved on.

A.167:  Could be.  Yeah, that's, that's too bad.  It really is.

B.168:  It's sad.

A.169:  It is.

B.170:  And they do it to dogs.

A.171:  Absolutely, yeah.

B.172:  The last dog I got, I think, was that way.

A.173:  Uh-huh.

B.174:  Because he was, uh, he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't
have a home or couldn't find,

A.175:  Right.

B.176:  his way home.  I don't believe it because he was one smart dog.

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  Strange mixture.  He was, uh, the best I can figure, he was part Lab
because he had a Lab head --

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  -- uh, and definitely part gray-, uh, bloodhound.

A.181:  Bloodhound.

B.182:  Because he had these big old jowls.

A.183:  Yeah.

B.184:  Had the bloodhound mouth --

A.185:  Uh-huh.

B.186:  -- but he had the soft bite of a Lab.

A.187:  Uh-huh.

B.188:  And he was the smartest dog I've ever seen.

A.189:  Yeah.

B.190:  He just, I could talk to him --

A.191:  Uh-huh.

B.192:  -- and he knew what I was saying.

A.193:  Yeah.  They, they are smart, they really are.  Right next door, or my
neighbor across the street has a couple of Labs.  They're really nice dogs.

B.194:  Uh-huh.

A.195:  They really are [noise].

B.196:  Well, my, my brother raises, my brother raises Labs.

A.197:  I see.

B.198:  And he gave one to, uh, he gave one to me several years ago --

A.199:  Uh-huh.  [noise] {Sounds like ice in glass}.

B.200:  -- and she was, she was just the sweetest little thing --

A.201:  Uh-huh.

B.202:  -- but they love to chew.

A.203:  Uh-huh.

B.204:  And so after she had chewed up my, my redwood furniture --

A.205:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.206:  -- she chewed the corners off the,

A.207:  Yes.

B.208:  picnic table and chewed,

A.209:  Yes, I've seen that.

B.210:  the cross-members off the chairs.

A.211:  Yes, I had a German Shepherd that did that one time.

B.212:  Yeah.  Oh, I ended up getting her a six foot two-by-four --

A.213:  Uh-huh.

B.214:  -- and let-, and she had the best time with it.

A.215:  I bet she did.

B.216:  She'd grab that thing in the middle,

A.217:  Uh-huh.

B.218:  and it was just about as heavy as she was,

A.219:  Uh-huh.

B.220:  and she'd drag that thing around the yard.

A.221:  [Laughter].

B.222:  She was a sight to behold.

A.223:  That was cheap entertainment, wasn't it?

B.224:  It was.  It's so easy to entertain them [beep].

A.225:  It really is.  Our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our,
our new family is the, you know, our two cats and our dog.  We never really,
well, we had, we did have some time to devote to them, you know, but not
nearly as much time as we have now.

B.226:  Yeah.

A.227:  So they've really become children.  They're, they're real characters, they
real-,

B.228:  Yeah.

A.229:  ((Well)), all of them are.

B.230:  Well, they're enjoyable to,

A.231:  Oh, yeah, they are.

B.232:  to have around.

A.233:  Uh-huh.

B.234:  I, I, uh, I run a little business out of the house here --

A.235:  Uh-huh.

B.236:  -- and, uh, I'm usually alone.

A.237:  Uh-huh.

B.238:  And got all these cats around --

A.239:  Uh-huh.

B.240:  -- so they, they keep me occupied.

A.241:  They keep you entertained.  They sure do.

B.242:  (( )).

A.243:  We have a, my wife's, uh, mother is, uh, oh, about (( )) she's
seventy-seven, I guess.  She really gets a thrill when we go over to see her
and bring the dog.  I think she's more happy to see the dog than she is us.

B.244:  [Laughter].

A.245:  I can't get it, can't get her convinced that she really shouldn't try to
feed my dog chocolate, though.  She always wants to do a little Hershey
Kisses, you know?

B.246:  [Laughter].

A.247:  You really shouldn't feed chocolate to a dog.

B.248:  No.

A.249:  Especially a small dog.

B.250:  No, ((that's)) --

A.251:  So I kind of have to watch her,

B.252:  [Laughter].

A.253:  when she's around the dog.

B.254:  Get, get her a, get her a box of doggy biscuits,

A.255:  Yeah.

B.256:  to, to, to let her feed him.

A.257:  I guess so, yeah.

B.258:  [Laughter].

A.259:  For some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some
chocolate.  Of course, the dog thinks so, too.

B.260:  Well, of course, Da-, and Dachshunds like chocolate.

A.261:  They do, as a matter of fact, they do.

B.262:  I, I rem-, I remember that other one,

A.263:  Uh-huh.

B.264:  too.  He was always after somebody's chocolate bar.

A.265:  Yeah, they love it.  They really do.

B.266:  My, my cats don't think much of chocolate.

A.267:  ((No)).

B.268:  Of course, they're, they're so damn finicky anyway.

A.269:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I think they can read the price tag on the cans,

B.270:  Yeah, well, they do.

A.271:  of food.

B.272:  Well, i-, we found out that didn't work,

A.273:  Uh-huh.

B.274:  because we even bought the expensive stuff --

A.275:  Uh-huh.

B.276:  -- and they looked at it like, you've got to be kidding.

A.277:  Yeah.

B.278:  Like, you know, what are you, a fool,

A.279:  [Laughter].

B.280:  paying that much money for this?

A.281:  [Laughter]. Now, I think I've experienced my first cat here that will not
eat tuna.  We have a cat that will not eat tuna.

B.282:  I've, I've, I've got one that won't.

A.283:  Uh-huh.

B.284:  Doesn't even like anything with fish in it.

A.285:  Yeah, that's strange.

B.286:  Yeah.

A.287:  Yeah, I thought,

B.288:  Ac-, actually, you know, fish is not their natural food.

A.289:  Yeah, that's true.

B.290:  That's, that's the peo-, I don't know why.  I guess the cartoons and
everything,

A.291:  Uh-huh.

B.292:  people grow up believing cats like fish.

A.293:  Yeah.

B.294:  The only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it's moving.

A.295:  That's right, that's right.

B.296:  It's, it's, it's something to play with.

A.297:  Yeah.  I believe this is the first cat that I've ever had that would not
even consider eating tuna.

B.298:  I bet it likes chicken, though.

A.299:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.

B.300:  Yeah, every one of mine,

A.301:  And even beef, as a matter of fact,

B.302:  Yeah.

A.303:  in small quantities.

B.304:  Yeah, yeah, even mine love chicken.

A.305:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah,

B.306:  When I ge-,

A.307:  they love, love chicken.

B.308:  Yeah, when I get in there to fry chicken or something,

A.309:  Uh-huh.

B.310:  they're all standing around,

A.311:  Uh-huh.

B.312:  waiting because they know they're going to get a piece.

A.313:  That's right [laughter].

B.314:  I just, I usually --

@@A.315:  Well, ((Jeff)), it's been good talking to you.

B.316:  Yeah, okay.  Well, it's been fun.

A.317:  Yeah.

B.318:  You have a good day.

A.319:  Yeah, take care of those cats.

B.320:  Yeah, thanks a lot.

A.321:  Bye-bye.

B.322:  Bye-bye.
