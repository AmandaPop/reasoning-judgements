==========================================================================

B.1:  Uh, no I think that maybe the, the automation people that are --

A.2:  Oh, okay.

B.3:  -- ((very)) discrete.  Or not discrete, electronic devices.

A.4:  Oh.

B.5:  So, and, did he, i-, is he the one that got you connected with us?

A.6:  Uh-huh.   

B.7:  Okay.  It's a lot of fun.   

A.8:  Yeah.    

B.9:  [Lipsmack] You want to punch the button and go?

A.10:  Sure, you ready?   

B.11:  Yip [beep].  

A.12:  Okay.   

B.13:  Well, are you going to buy a car soon?   

A.14:  Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going
to re-, retire.  And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new
one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now.

B.15:  And what are you going to buy?   

A.16:  I do-, I don't know, we're either going to buy a pick up, or we're going to
buy a van.  Or we're going to buy an economy car, how do you like that
[laughter]?

B.17:  Well, have you been listening to ((Iacocca's)) arguments that, uh, that
Chrysler products are the only ones [breathing] that, that all have air bags?

A.18:  Uh, yeah.    

B.19:  Does that make a difference to you?   

A.20:  Yeah.  It sure does.  I really would like to have something like that, and
I'm hoping that by you know, [breathing] that's like, right now, my husband
would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.  But I keep saying lets
put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better
features.

B.21:  Yeah, like what?   

A.22:  Well, just like that air bag.  I think that thing is fantastic.  Because
I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things,

B.23:  Yeah.   

A.24:  when they had it [breathing], and people walk away from it.  We had one
here, I guess it was about three weeks ago, and the people walked away from
the, wreck,

B.25:  That's (( )).

A.26:  with no scratches nothing.  You know, a few bruises.   

B.27:  Di-, did you see the, uh, I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last
Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?

A.28:  Uh-huh.   

B.29:  Did that scare you a little bit?   

A.30:  Uh-huh.   

B.31:  With the lady being thrown out -- 

A.32:  You got it.  I,  

B.33:  -- and run over.   

A.34:  I, tell you what, I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat
belt where it was hooked under the door.

B.35:  [Breathing] that really sc-, I, I guess, I, that, that a little more than
scared me, that irritated me, uh, that, because it, it, it surely didn't come
as a surprise that, that if the door came open [laughter] the lady would fall
out, I mean, and,

A.36:  Well, you know what the average person, would you ever have thought of
that?

B.37: [Breathing] uh --  

A.38:  I mean now i-,

B.39:  -- no, probably, well,

A.40:  you probably wouldn't have, 

B.41:  I might, the problem is I'm really into cars, and so it's not a, uh, for
me it's, it's a real, it's a real consideration, uh, uh, and, and, uh, the,
[breathing] but no I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into
cars it's,

A.42:  Right --   

B.43:  it's probably my main hobby.   

A.44:  -- because you always think, I mean, I don't know, maybe you don't, but
[breathing] just like me, I always think well, you know, these things must be
safe, but that's just like, I don't know if you've heard about it a few years
ago, they said, [breathing] you know, before they had the, like the shoulder
strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist?

B.45:  Yeah.   

A.46:  All these people were, and, and it, it was on one of those kind of shows
like TWENTY-TWENTY --

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  -- these people were like paralyzed, [breathing] and because, it threw them
forward, but they were hooked at the waist, [breathing] and so it like, you
know, did something to their spinal cord --

B.49:  [Breathing] Yeah.  

A.50:  -- then they were like paraplegics.   

B.51:  [Breathing] yeah, you know, ROAD AND TRACK had a, had some articles on, and
particularly with, with back seat, uh, with some, where kids, were, were
sitting in the back seat with seat belts on, and they were thrown forward,
into the front seat, and there was enough stretching, [breathing] the
combination of stretching the spine to, uh, par-, I mean, the serious injury,
even though they were, they were still locked in the --

A.52:  Right.   

B.53:  -- they were forced to go, so really if your sitting in the back seat, your
better off not not to have your seat belt on, if it's just a seat belt.

A.54:  Yeah.   

B.55:  We have a van, that, uh, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a
shoulder harness --

A.56:  Well, tell me about your van.  Do you like it?   

B.57:  -- [Breathing] I have an Arrow Star van, we really do.  Uh, it's, it's a
mini van, we've had it, goodness in May will be five years and, uh, they
replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty.  And the
transmission was replaced but they really are nifty, uh, the mini van, it's
actually, we had a station wagon before, and it's a foot or two shorter than
a, we had a regular size station wagon --

A.58:  Uh-huh.   

B.59:  -- and it really, uh, we like it, it, the (( )) interestingly enough one of
the features we like are the electric locks.

A.60:  Huh.  The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a
trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida --

B.61:  Uh-huh.   

A.62:  -- and, like I said, I mean, we're not that old but my husband works for
the State, and after a certain amount of years you can retire.  And when he
retires I'm retiring.  Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm,

B.63:  Uh-huh.    

A.64:  retiring period, that's it,  

B.65:  Yeah.   

A.66:  you know, no more [laughter].  

B.67:  Well, but, the, did you,  

A.68:  As though -- 

B.69:  did you go to Florida in a van?   

A.70:  -- Uh-huh [lipsmack].  And we wanted to travel, well, that was really nice
traveling but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people
that have things like that you know?

B.71:  [Breathing] Yeah. 

A.72:  And see what they think of them, the different kinds --  

B.73:  Yeah.   

A.74:  -- because I've only ridden in the one,

B.75:  What, what kind was it?   

A.76:  that's it.  Uh, [lipsmack] shoot I can't even think of the name of it now.

B.77:  What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the, we have two kids, and
we went to Disney World --

A.78:  Uh-huh.   

B.79:  -- uh, actually I grew up in Alabama, and I went to see my mother, and then
went on down to Disney World, and it got better than, I think twenty-two,
twenty-three miles a gallon.  And this was with the air conditioner on and,
and you know --

A.80:  Yeah.   

B.81:  -- four people with, with luggage, and, uh, course this, grant it, that's,
you know, it's been four years ago, but it's remarkable that the, that the
bigger vans, uh, they're, uh, my boss just bought a, a pick up truck, and, uh,
he only gets seventeen miles a gallon.

A.82:  Yeah.   

B.83:  But it, it has a big engine, and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff, but it's,
and it, it's got the seats that, and the other thing that is interesting, is
it has, uh, rear air conditioning.

A.84:  Uh-huh.   

B.85:  And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm
climates.

A.86:  Yeah.  Well, now, this one that we went in, it did {speaks to husband} baby
what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?  Ford.  A what?
Ford.  A Ford?  Ford what, you remember? {ends conversation with husband}.
He was trying to think of what the name of it was,

B.87:  Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all,  

A.88:  this was a big one.  I mean it was a big one,  

B.89:  real nice, yeah, oh those are -- 

A.90:  it has the front and the back and you know, it has the -- 

B.91:  -- yeah.   

A.92:  -- uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed --

B.93:  Yeah.   

A.94:  -- and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel
chairs on the front --

B.95:  All right.   

A.96:  -- and, I mean it was fantastic,  

B.97:  Uh-huh.   

A.98:  and it got good gas mileage, but [breathing] I don't know I don't really,
I don't, I want something I can drive too, you know,

B.99:  Well --  

A.100:  and I was scared to drive that big van.   

B.101:  -- well, the mini, that, you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the,
the mini vans, uh, (( )) more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet and, uh,
well of course, Oldsmobile has got one, and Chryslers got one, but they drive
remarkably like cars.

A.102:  Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you
would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those
little side mirror things --

B.103:  Yeah.   

A.104:  -- and it would look like it was further back than it was.

B.105:  Yeah but, the little, thing etched in it, say objects are, are closer than
they appear or something [laughter].

A.106:  Yeah, does yours do that too?   

B.107:  Yeah.   

A.108:  Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that, 

B.109:  Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors, we've got the big
side mirrors, which are really nice.  I don't know if you've, well, if you've
driven a pick up truck, you know, these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six
inches across not nearly a foot high,

A.110:  Uh-huh. 

B.111:  and they're really nice, uh, got them on both sides, actually they, they
fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back.

A.112:  Yeah, 

B.113:  But they're -- 

A.114:  well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them, at first
we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it,

B.115:  -- uh-huh.    

A.116:  of it, but then that gas mileage was just atrocious, I mean it's,

B.117:  Uh-huh.   

A.118:  unreal, it's, it just practically don't get any.   

B.119:  Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the
aerodynamic features, you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage.

A.120:  Yeah.  And then, uh, he talked about a van, and I said, well, you know, I
don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these.  And another thing
was that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you
know, in a little economy car, but I said --

B.121:  Uh-huh.   

A.122:  -- maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along --

B.123:  Uh-huh.   

A.124:  -- when we went somewhere.   

B.125:  Yeah.   

A.126:  But really and truly the safety features but I wouldn't get one that, if
it had, the seat belts on the door now --

B.127:  Yeah.   

A.128:  -- I wouldn't get it.  Period. 

B.129:  (( )) Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh,
air bags in their, in their vans.

A.130:  Oh that would be good.   

B.131:  So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety, I, I, I, I really do believe in
this stuff, uh, and I, I think it can go, (( )), I'm not, the air bags are a
good deal but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh, you really need to do, you
need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh,

A.132:  Oh I think so too,  

B.133:  and the seat belts so,

A.134:  I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now. 

B.135:  Yeah.   

A.136:  I'm but I think you need the shoulder thing -- 

B.137:  Yeah.   

A.138:  -- I think you need the thing around your waist, but, I think you need that
bag to pop out too.

B.139:  Yeah.   

A.140:  You know, because [breathing] I know so many people, here that have been
killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that --

B.141:  Yeah.   

A.142:  -- air bag, they may still be walking around.   

B.143:  Yeah.   

A.144:  But, uh, I think it's fantastic.  I wish they required it in everything.
Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it.

B.145:  [Breathing] It would be (( )) that would do to our insurance rates, you
know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to
pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags.  Would be
interesting wouldn't it?

A.146:  Yeah.   

B.147:  Uh, that wouldn't be fair but, uh,  

A.148:  Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan
on, you know, they would have to do it, the insurance company would have to do
the same thing.  [breathing] They're given like, a ten year time limit --

B.149:  Yeah.    

A.150:  -- where, okay.  These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be
off the roads or something by the, in ten years --

B.151:  Yeah.   

A.152:  -- and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your
insurance would go up enormously,

B.153:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh, I've got to go [laughter] my son's in a performance
tonight, I have to leave,

A.154:  Oh that's okay, 

B.155:  in a couple of minutes.  Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable
amount of time.

A.156:  Okay.   

B.157:  It was good talking to you,  

A.158:  Well, you, you too.   

B.159:  Okay.  Good night.   

A.160:  All right bye bye.
