=======================================================================

B.1:  Okay, the car. If I buy a car it'd probably be an American made car
[laughter].  (( )) wrong, because I feel if the economy, I would probably buy
an American made car.  Even though sometimes the foreign cars are better, but
we're losing a lot of money [laughter] buying foreign cars, and people getting
out of jobs as it is.  So I'd probably buy, I've always own American car.  Uh,
the kind of car is probably something I couldn't afford, [laughter] like a
Lincoln.  I would love to have a Lincoln.

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  Mark seven.

A.4:  A Mark seven.

B.5:  Yes.

A.6:  Uh, what do Mark sevens usually run?

B.7:  Oh, about thirty-five to forty.

A.8:  Thirty-five k.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Well, that's a tremendous amount of money, alright.

B.11:  It's a luxury car.  It's a, it's a sports luxury car.  It's right below the
Continental, the Lincoln Continental.

A.12:  I see.

B.13:  You know, it's along that line.  Uh-huh.

A.14: I agree that, uh, American cars should be the ones to be bought.
Um, I just wish there were (( )) to still improve further.  Oh.

B.15:  Yeah, they're getting even better, I think.

A.16:  Yes, it's a matter of time.  It's probably going to be another two to five
years before they're really up to par where they should be, and then I believe
the majority of American people will,

B.17:  Already have foreign cars.

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  They will already have.  In fact I have one myself.  I'm reluctant to
admit.

B.21:  My mother has one.

A.22:  She does?

B.23:  Yes.  She finally, she wo-, she had a, she's got a Honda, not a Honda, a
Toyota that, what is it, Accord, no Honda Accord, yeah.

A.24:  Honda Accord.

B.25:  Yes.

A.26:  That's one.

B.27:  And she hasn't had any problems out of it.  So, 

A.28:  What year model is it?

B.29:  Oh, think it's a eighty-nine.

A.30:  Eighty-nine.

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  Well that's fairly new.  Mine is an eighty-four Sentra --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- and the only problem I've ever experienced, major type problem I've
experienced, is a, a fuel pump had to be replaced, and it's got eighty-four
thousand, no it's got eighty-nine thousand miles on it now.

B.35:  See, I have a Lincoln Continental right now.

A.36:  You do.

B.37:  It's a, yeah, it's a seventy-nine Lincoln.  It's got over a hundred
thousand miles, and there is no problem with the car. #See, I think,#

A.38:  #No major# malfunctions then?

B.39:  Huh-uh.  My air conditioner went out, but, I mean, ten years, [laughter]
but uh, I mean as far as major, there's nothing major with the car.

A.40:  I see.  Well that's #good to hear.#

B.41:  #But, it,# I think what it is, the American public had made good cars at one
time, and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff.  The first car
I think now that they have that's, that's made it on the, what do you call it,
the mechanic's list or the {hesitation} the why they check, the how they judge
cars, what is it list, where they come out with the consumer list.

A.42:  In CONSUMER DIGEST or #a CONSUMER REPORTS.#

B.43:  #Yeah, is a# Taurus.

A.44:  A Taurus?

B.45:  Yeah, that's the first one that's made it, and its a four door, it's a nice
car.  Now for me to buy a Taurus, I would have to buy top of the line Taurus,
and that's Taurus Show.

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  It has a four speed, I like that stick shift [laughter].  But see, that's
top of the line.  That costs twenty, whereas a Taurus would cost about, a
regular Taurus I think is twelve or thirteen.

A.48:  Well that's not too bad in price.

B.49:  Um, yeah, see, the Taurus Show has the (( )) and the big engine and stuff
like that.

A.50:  It has an eight cylinder.

B.51:  Well, yeah, I think it has a, it has that engine like the Mustang.

A.52:  Oh yeah.

B.53:  Yeah, and it's a four, it's, I think it's, you know, the speed, uh, uh,
manual transmission.

A.54:  Correct.

B.55:  So.  But yes I would definitely buy one of those before, if I had to,
between that and Lincoln, I'd probably buy the Show.

A.56:  What about (( )) stressed on the mini van, I mean, the mini van has been
one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler, isn't it.

B.57:  Yeah, I don't know.

A.58:  Um.  Their durability is a lot better, I understand, than most other vans.

B.59:  I thin-, it woul-, there's nothing much of the vans any more, or the cars.
Some of them are ugly.

A.60:  Right.

B.61:  I'm sorry.  They look like space mobiles.

A.62:  There's a lot of duplicity in the vehicles, the way the build them too --

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  -- insofar as their design.  Um, uh, American, even foreign.

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  I'm sure it's all for streamlining or for air streamlining.

B.67:  Why?  You can't still go fast, so what's the difference?  That's what I
don't understand.  You know, they're making it so that, they're talking about
the wind current and how, how efficient it is, but if you can't go fast, you
can't go fast, I don't care how sleek they make it.  It just makes sense to
me.  It's like they're making a model of a speed car when you can't go fast.

A.68:  Right.

B.69:  You know, in, in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that
Autobahn [laughter].  But over here, nobody should be going that fast to be
worried about wind [laughter].  No.

A.70:  Yeah, just a second {pause}.  You going to pick them up?  {Speaking to
someone off the phone}.  Excuse me for a moment. {On phone}.  Right, I'm
fixing to get them right now. {Off phone again}.  Excuse me, I had to, uh,
talk to my boss. {On phone again}.

B.71:  I know how that go.  But, I guess that's about it, and I better let you go.

@@A.72:  Okay, so I guess we have nothing to do, on the other end there's no
interruptions here to tell us what we're done?

B.73:  Uh-huh.  That's it.  Just hang up.

A.74:  Okay.  #See you later.#

B.75:  #Bye.#
