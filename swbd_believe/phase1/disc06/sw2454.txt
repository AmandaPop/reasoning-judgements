=========================================================================

A.1:  I'm not sure I even know where to begin on this mess.

B.2:  Oh, it, it is a mess [laughter]. 

A.3:  I do believe though, a lot of specula-, speculative buying,

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  and investment on speculation, uh, too many large deals, 

B.6:  Oh, definitely. 

A.7:  with too much risk. 

B.8:  Uh-huh.  Bad deals with friends [laughter].

A.9:  Uh, and, and associates of friends,

B.10:  #Yes.# 

A.11:  #and on it goes,# 

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  over a long period of time. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  And I think it, I think it's a, a type of situation where, okay, the first
investment didn't work, but if we throw a little bit more money in on it,

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  maybe this one mi-, you know, and try to get our money back. 

B.18:  Throw good money after bad you mean. 

A.19:  E-, exactly. 

B.20:  The, it's, it just not, doesn't work [laughter].  

A.21:  That's, that is, that is some of what, some of what I had read is that's 
part of cause of it.

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  Now, as to the question of what to do about it. 

B.24:  Oh, heavens [laughter].  I would, 

A.25:  Uh, it has to be government regulation. 

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  It, but, you know it, it's I don't know [laughter], it's not
something I know a whole lot about but, uh,

A.27:  I don't either [noise].

B.28:  it's some-, it's such a big huge complicated mess [laughter]. 

A.29:  But the other thing, this Dickson,

B.30:  #Oh.#

A.31:  #that# they convicted, 

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  he only got five years. 

B.34:  I know, #I couldn't believe it.#  

A.35:  #So that's going to# leave a message to other people that yeah,

B.36:  He can be out in twenty months they said. 

A.37:  Well, yes, but he's in very poor health, so you know,

B.38:  Yeah, but,

A.39:  twenty months may mean a lot longer for him.

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  But still [/noise].

B.42:  (( )) but still,  I mean, I, heal-, health and everyth-, I mean,

A.43:  It's our money, it's our taxes,

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  that have to pay for this mess. 

B.46:  Oh that, well there are too, I think there is too many savings and loans
period.  There's, you know, you, you drive down the street and there's one on
every corner.

A.47:  This is true, #this is very true.# 

B.48:  #And, and it,# it, I think it's too easy to b-, to, uh, form one.  That,
you know, cause I mean look, you look in Dallas, they're everywhere, they were
everywhere, and then, then they started being taken over by bigger, bigger
ones.  And then they just, the bigger ones took on the little ones' debt and
then it, it just snowballed.

A.49:  And that's probably another cause of the problem we are looking at 
right now.

B.50:  Yeah.  It's, it, there's just, it just seemed like everybody and their
brother had a savings and loan [laughter].

A.51:  This is a very true thing, I didn't think about that part of it. 

B.52:  You know, because, you know, I have never, I'm, we're originally from
Missouri and there are, you know, mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings
and loans in the area.

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  I mean, I have never seen so many as there are down here. 

A.55:  Oh, really.  That's interesting. 

B.56:  They're, they're, they're just everywhere.  A-, and, you know, set up
in trailers.

A.57:  Oh, yes, yes, #this is true.#  

B.58:  #[Laughter] I seen one# on Preston Road that was set up in a trailer for
a while before they built the little building.

A.59:  Oh, how funny.

B.60:  And then, uh, and then uh, it went out, uh, I mean,  and I just 
wonder [sniffing]. 

A.61:  How much that cost us? [Noise]. 

B.62:  Yeah, and how [swallowing] many people lost money on that, lost money in
that thing.  But who, but, uh, who knows it's,

A.63:  That is scary, I didn't think about that [/noise].

B.64:  Well, they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and
millions a lot, a lot better than they ar-, have been.  Dickson is the only
one I even heard of, I mean there may be more that they are prosecuting, but
Dickson is the only one I even heard of.

A.65:  They must be getting some on the national level, I think I've read various
things, but I just, no names #come to mind.#

B.66:  #Because,# if he only stole six, stole six hundred thousand dollars, that's
just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them that were, were skimming
millions.

A.67:  Yeah, because that's a drop in the bucket to the taxes,

B.68:  Yeah. 

A.69:  we're going to have to pay,

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  to, to make up for this.

B.72:  There are bigger fish. I know.  I mean, otherwise it wouldn't be in such a
mess.  That, the, the stealing, because, uh, stealing and leaving the country
probably they ca-, they probably can't find them [laughter] so what the deal 
is?  [Laughter].

A.73:  You know, you've got a good point there. 

B.74:  [Laughter] Oh but eventually, you know, the, the tax money is getting
extremely low on the F S L I C.  I mean they are, they are getting, they are
getting so low it, it's almost in trouble and,

A.75:  And the,

B.76:  and where's, where is that going to come from?

A.77:  And the other thing is they said the insur-, the, uh, insurance agents, the
insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry.

B.78:  Oh, yeah. 

A.79:  So they, they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance --

B.80:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

A.81:  -- as another, uh, 

B.82:  That's, and that's frightening, that is frightening because,

A.83:  My car insurance is frightening #right now.# 

B.84:  #Oh, oh,# our #car insurance.# 

A.85:  #I cannot believe# how much money I pay. 

B.86:  I can't either for, for, uh, for nothing, for almost nothing. 

A.87:  Well, and I just carry the absolute minimum required by law. 

B.88:  Right. 

A.89:  And I'm paying, I mean, every quarter I'm paying like five hundred dollars
a year and that,

B.90:  Oh well you don't pay, we, we, keep full coverage down here on everything.

A.91:  Oh, my. 

B.92:  Because well it's not, it's not that bad.  But that's getting off the
subject [laughter].  Uh, but uh, but the, you think that they, that they could
come up with a better system of regulating these, these little bitty, uh,
savings and loans #that, uh,#

A.93:  #Well,# I, you know, the problem is who is they, and you get, they is the
government.

B.94:  The government yeah, that's what I meant, Congress.  

A.95:  But, you get, you get into when you start getting them to do things, you
get into a lot of special interest groups #again.#

B.96:  #Yeah, exac-,# exactly.  

A.97:  And you know,

B.98:  And lobbying, oh, you know there's a big. 

A.99:  And, and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would
that offer new opportunities for other people?

B.100:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true. 

A.101:  That's what scares me, when you get into that type of situation. 

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  You know if you are going to change it, watch out for the person that's
changing it.

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  They may put another loophole in that, that,

B.106:  Makes it even worse. 

A.107:  wasn't even there to begin with. 

B.108:  Yeah, and, and, and people like us never hear about, about what's really
going on and what they, what they're really doing.

A.109:  And I think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of
time,

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  because they're there to sell newspapers.

B.112:  Yeah. 

A.113:  That's the problem with the news, both the, on television #and the 
paper,#

B.114:  #Television is worse,# television is worse.

A.115:  Well all they're there to sell, 

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  you know or to entertain, even worse.  

B.118:  Yeah, that's,

A.119:  And, uh, not to transmit information. 

B.120:  Oh, exactly.  What makes,

A.121:  So what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to
decide anything?

B.122:  Yeah, yeah, th-, we got these people up in Washington deciding all
this stuff for us, and we don't even know what they're deciding.  So it's.

A.123:  And whose best interests they represent, us or someone else? 

B.124:  And how many of them have, were invested in [laughter], #how many of
them have invested in a savings and loan?  [Laughter].#

A.125:  #In, in a savings and loan [laughter].# Or own a, or has a brother that
owns, yeah. 

B.126:  Yeah, oh yeah (( )).

A.127:  It's really a scary, scary thing. 

B.128:  Yeah, but, I'm, it's one, ONE of those things that I just don't know where
the answer lies.  It's, it's just, just going to, uh, it, it doesn't seem like
it's going as badly as it did in the past few years, it's kind of slow.
Because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit.

A.129:  Well, now, there was an article in the paper this morning in the business
section, how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore.

B.130:  Oh, really? 

A.131:  Yeah, whe-, when you know when you're trying to buy a house? 

B.132:  Uh-huh. 

A.133:  How incredibly hard it is to get,

B.134:  Huh.

A.135:  get a loan approved.  

B.136:  #Well, I can see wh-,#

A.137:  #simply because they're,#

B.138:  #I can see why.# 

A.139:  #they are tightening down# so much.

B.140:  I can see why because they were loan, they were loaning money to everybody
and anybody.  That, I mean, they didn't check up on people.  They were loaning
people ungodly amounts of money that were, that, that, that couldn't pay for
it and you wonder how in the world these people got their loans.  Why look at,
look at the I Thirty condos. I know somebody at T I that bought one of them
things uh, back when they first [laughter] opened, 

A.141:  Uh-huh.

B.142:  you know that big scam?

A.143:  Oh, yes. 

B.144:  And they just, they just left town.  They just, they just packed up and
left town.

A.145:  Smart move. 

B.146:  An-, I mean, I mean they left, well, yes but no, because they, uh, they
left their loan hanging.

A.147:  Oh, did they? 

B.148:  Yes.  They, they just, 

A.149:  Oh, that's not,

B.150:  And that happened that happened a lot in this area.  People just packing
up and leaving their houses and leaving the, the banks and the savings and
loans out to dry #on the,#

A.151:  #Well,#

B.152:  loans, on the car, on house loans.

A.153:  but they are hurting their own credit that way.  

B.154:  Hey, I know people that it does, they don't care.  It wouldn't b-, I am
extremely touchy, picky about my credit, bu-, but I know people that just
don't care F S L I C what they done. Bankruptcy means nothing to these people
and it hurts all of us i-, when they declare bankruptcy, it's you and me that,

A.155:  Oh, absolutely.

B.156:  have to pay for it and these people don't care.

A.157:  Yeah, because, they can, you know, they write all that and people that
write things off as bad debt.

B.158:  Uh-huh. 

A.159:  That lowers their threshold of income.

B.160:  Uh-huh. 

A.161:  Of what they have to pay taxes on.   

B.162:  Oh, yeah. 

A.163:  Which automat-, automatically makes our taxes go up,

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  because there is so much that has to be paid.  

B.166:  Oh, of course. 

A.167:  And if this guy is exempt from paying it, we #have to pay more.# 

B.168:  #We have to pick up# slack. 

A.169:  That's exactly right.  So, ((shst))

B.170:  So it's, it's, it's a lot of people just run, running out on loans that
they couldn't pay for in this area.  I mean, you just can't imagine how many
houses people just run,  have run out on.

A.171:  [Noise] Yeah, that is really sad.

B.172:  Yeah, I know it, I know it.  I don't think it's, it's as bad now as it was
a couple of years ago when everything just kind of fell apart, you know,
everything just kind of fizzled.

A.173:  Yes. 

B.174:  What, because when we moved down here in eighty-three, I mean there was
buildings going up on every corner every week and [laughter],

A.175:  And, and the unoccupied ...
