===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess?

B.2:  Um, a lot, well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the
NINJA TURTLE movie [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter] Obviously you have kids.

B.4:  [Laughter] That's right.  Yeah, but my preference is the one we saw before
that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

A.5:  I haven't seen that one yet.

B.6:  That's an excellent movie.

A.7:  Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. 

B.8:  Oh, was that good.  I heard,

A.9:  Uh, see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan.

B.10:  Oh, okay.

A.11:  But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would
be.

B.12:  Well, that's good. 

A.13:  It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Yeah, it was a pretty good movie.

B.16:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.

A.17:  I, I'm ready to go.  It just, it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way
yet.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  You know, it's, uh, it looks good, you know --

B.20:  Yeah, it is.

A.21:  -- if you like thrillers, anyway.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  And I do.

A.25:  In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a
while afterwards.  So [laughter],

B.26:  [Laughter] Really.  Oh, I love them like that.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  I'm not, I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies, [ringing] but I like that
where they run tense.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  I really enjoy, they keep me guessing the whole time.  It's really, it was
really interesting.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Well, what other movies have you seen then lately?

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  Other than the, I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES.

B.34:  Yes, the new one, of course [laughter].

A.35:  Is that any good, I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a
week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to
see the first one.

B.36:  Oh {sound drawn out}.

A.37:  So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon.  

B.38:  Amarillo.  I didn't see the first one.  My husband said it was, um, about
the same lines.

A.39:  Oh, well, then it won't be too bad.

B.40:  So, yeah.

A.41:  You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily, but it was better than it could
have been.

B.42:  Right, right.  And I was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that
childish.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You know what I mean.  It wasn't, my daughter's five, I mean she understood
everything.  She goes to almost all movies with us except, you know, R rated.
And she really enjoyed it, but it was on a higher level, you know, where there
were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did, and I liked
that.

A.45:  Yeah, I think that's important if you're going, you know, if you're going,
uh, kids are going to, uh, parents are going to have to go --

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  -- you ought to make it at least semi-,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  you know, semi for them too.

B.50:  That's right, that's right.  

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  It's pretty good.  But we take her to just about every movie, and, she, uh,
she does really good.  We've taken her from real young, and she does real
good.  Like I said, we don't take her to R -s.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  So, if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE
LAMBS, we go see it.

A.55:  I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure.

B.56:  Oh, no, no.

A.57:  Do you take her, or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to,

B.58:  Yeah, yeah.

A.59:  What was the last comedy you saw?

B.60:  [Whispering] {sort of to herself} Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw?
{back to regular speech} Huh, huh, huh.  Good question, [laughter] good
question.  We don't get to go that often, but something on the tip of my
tongue, and I can't think of which one it was.  Uh.  Gosh, I can't remember.

A.61:  The last, uh, in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- I said that wrong, the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J.
Fox.

B.64:  But that, that sounds good.

A.65:  Well, that really wasn't too bad.  There were, you know, he's supposed, you
know, he's this actor, right --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and he's playing a cop.

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  Or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.  I think he
did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.

B.70:  Oh, okay.

A.71:  I mean, there, there were times when he was, like, he'd be running with a
gun or whatever.  He didn't look like a cop when he did it.  And I was so --

B.72:  That's neat.

A.73:  -- impressed with that because, you know, usually,

B.74:  The part was hard, to do that.

A.75:  Oh yeah, because, I mean, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies
and trying to, you know, to imitate them or whatever.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  And, uh, I thought he did such an excellent job of not --

B.78:  Yeah,

A.79:  -- going that far.  Now, by the end he was looking more like a cop.

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, you
know, he was trying to, trying to get it, but he wasn't there yet.

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  And you could tell it, and I guess that I thought was a real good acting
and writing job both, you know, because I think, or directing job.  I think
they did a real good job of that.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  And James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.  I
mean, #you know, he just,#

B.86:  #Yeah, I like him.#

A.87:  Yeah, and there were, there were some definite, um, should I say, tense
moments,

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  with him in there.

B.90:  [Laughter] Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is
HOME ALONE.

A.91:  Yes, I, I, I had seen it before Christmas, but I took a date to it, uh,
about a month ago.  So, I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.
So.

B.92:  It was really cute.

A.93:  I really enjoyed it.

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  Of course, the bad thing about it was, uh, the second time I saw it, I
didn't really enjoy it as much, and I was kind of surprised at that.  I
thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  But before, maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.  I
had laughed so hard I was hoarse.

B.98:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.99:  I really was, I was hoarse getting out of there.  

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it, I
mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time --

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  -- because I had just gone overboard the first time.  I don't know but,

B.104:  [Laughter] Maybe so, maybe so.

A.105:  Yeah, I mean, it was, it was a great movie though.  I loved the movie.

B.106:  Yeah, I did, too.  I'm looking forward to this summer, uh, NAKED GUN TWO
AND A HALF is coming out.

A.107:  [Laughter] I love those movies.

B.108:  I do too.  I mean, they are just slapstick {word drawn out for emphasis}.

A.109:  Oh, yeah. 

B.110:  It, you have to see those twice to catch everything.

A.111:  Well, you have to see them more than that.

B.112:  Yeah, yeah.

A.113:  I, I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch. 

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I mean, it's amazing --

B.116:  I do too.

A.117:  -- I love those movies --

B.118:  I do too.

A.119:  -- I really do.

B.120:  So I'm looking forward to seeing that --

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  -- because that looks hilarious,

A.123:  [Laughter].

B.124:  as they all do.

A.125:  Oh yeah.

B.126:  Well, we [throat_clearing], we try to go a couple times a month, I guess --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- to see a movie.  It, it's just getting so expensive.

A.129:  Oh, isn't it though.  You know, but that's at least the good thing about
the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.

B.130:  But normally we don't think about it until,

A.131:  That's exactly what,

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  I was going to say.  I keep not doing it until after I'm there and then all
of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things.

B.134:  I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars --

A.135:  Easily.

B.136:  -- just getting in --

A.137:  Yeah, yeah,

B.138:  -- the three of us.

A.139:  And then if you want popcorn and stuff --

B.140:  Yeah.

A.141:  -- it's just, I mean, uh, it's incredible.

B.142:  I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both.  You know
popcorn is not that expensive.

A.143:  No, No, nowhere near that expensive.

B.144:  So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn
and coke.

A.145:  And, it, it's just the idea that these, uh, these actors, you know, live in
such lavish style.  I mean, it's as simple as that.

B.146:  Yeah.  We just keep breeding them.

A.147:  Yeah, and as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to
keep paying them.

B.148:  I guess so.  Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?

A.149:  Yes.  Oh yeah.  Oh, that was, that was an excellent movie.

B.150:  I haven't seen, we're waiting for the video.

A.151:  No, don't.  

B.152:  No, really?

A.153:  Don't.  That needs the big screen.

B.154:  Oh.

A.155:  It really and truly does, because to get the feeling --

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  -- of like when the buffalos are, when they're chasing the buffalos and
everything --

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  -- you've got to be where you feel it.

B.160:  Oh really?

A.161:  You really truly do.

B.162:  Oh.

A.163:  I would, I mean, I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video, too.
But I'm glad I didn't.  I really and truly am.  I mean, that mov-, that was
one movie I came out impressed.

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  I really and truly did.  I mean, I have absolutely no problems with them
winning seven Oscars.  None at all.

B.166:  Right.

A.167:  Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one, one movie taking
all the honors.

B.168:  Everythin-, yeah, yeah.

A.169:  I wanted him to win best actor on top of it, he was,

B.170:  Yeah, oh.

A.171:  Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.

B.172:  Yeah.

A.173:  But even though they were okay, the girl in it, they, somebody made an
interesting observation, now that I think back on it, I'd say yeah, I can't
believe that either.  She was the only indian to have her hair done at all
times.  You know what I mean, you know.

B.174:  [Laughter].

A.175:  It was just too perfect at all times.  

B.176:  Yeah.

A.177:  That was a mistake that they made.  They shouldn't have done it.

B.178:  Yeah.

A.179:  Now the best, the supporting actor, he was good, but from what I heard, the
guy who got it was better, so I, you know, I can see that.

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  But, oh, 

B.182:  You think my daughter would like it?

A.183:  Oh, well there are, there is one spot that was just a little bit on the
gory side.

B.184:  Oh, okay.

A.185:  But, um, it's it's 

B.186:  She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes.

A.187:  Okay, no problems [laughter].

B.188:  [Laughter].

A.189:  It, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has
come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides.
So there's,

B.190:  See, that's the one, that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want
to see the movie --

A.191:  Yeah, but, well,

B.192:  -- is because I love buffalos for some weird reason, [laughter] and I
know they're fake.

A.193:  And, and, of course, and, well, yeah, that, and plus, I mean part of it is
the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt.  So, I mean, they are
killing buffalos in it.  But they don't stress that very much, they really
don't.

B.194:  Okay, okay.

A.195:  And I think it's an excellent movie for, if, if she enjoys movies I think
it'll work pretty good.

B.196:  Oh, that'll be good.  We really need some, my husband keeps wanting to.

A.197:  It's, it's, it's a long movie.

B.198:  Yeah, and I heard the video's even going to be longer.

A.199:  Oh yeah.

B.200:  They did a lot of stuff that they cut out.

A.201:  I may have to see the video.

B.202:  Yeah, (( )) that's true, they said,

A.203:  I hadn't even thought of that.

B.204:  Yeah, they said there's a lot that had been edited, because of the length
--

A.205:  Uh-huh.

B.206:  -- and that they wanted in, so they're going to put it in the video.

A.207:  Yeah.

B.208:  And that way you can watch it at your leisure.

A.209:  Well, yeah, I kind of like it when they do that, because the video, like I
said, there are certain things you can't do with a video --

B.210:  Yeah.

A.211:  -- and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good
idea.

B.212:  Yeah, yeah.

A.213:  Because I mean when you rent a video, videos, of course, are not cheap
either --

B.214:  True.

A.215:  -- and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good
idea. Because they, they make bundles of money off those things.

B.216:  {Whispering} I know it {regular voice}.  Isn't that ridiculous.  We have
cable which --

A.217:  Oh, I do too.

B.218:  -- helps a lot [laughter].

A.219:  Yeah, but not enough.

B.220:  Yeah, we keep holding out, you know.

A.221:  Yeah I'm getting to the point where, you know, I watch, well I watch NICK
AT NIGHT.
