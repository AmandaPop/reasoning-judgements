REMARKS:	Caller A was very difficult to understand and did not finish
pronouncing words.  Caller B said uh-huh throughout Caller A's turn, also a
lot of other cross talk.

===========================================================================

@B.1:  Okay, uh, let me see, we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods
better or worse and have you had to take anything back recently.  Have you?

A.2:  Let's see, yeah, I'm always returning things but I have three kids and,
um, a lot of times it's just because it doesn't fit the way that I thought it
was going to. 

B.3:  Oh, okay.

A.4:  Well that's really clothes isn't it.  

B.5:  Yeah.

A.6:  Consumer goods {pause} trying to think.  No, I haven't returned anything
lately.

B.7:  I haven't either.  I think things must be getting better.

A.8:  We-, I haven't bought that much lately [laughter].

B.9:  Oh, my goodness, that could explain it [laughter].

A.10:  No, it's true, I think if you're talking about major appliances like
stereos, and refrigerators and washing machines, 

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  I mean we've had alo-, all ours for quite a while and,

B.13:  Of course, they're probably all Japanese, too.  I'm s-, [laughter].

A.14:  [Laughter] It's hard to tell anymore, who owns what --

B.15:  I know it, I know it.

A.16:  -- by the names, isn't it.

B.17:  And I really would like to buy American but I don't think it's possible, I
think i-,

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:   except for maybe in clothes.  But I think all the electronics are, 

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  you know basically, they're ma, ma-, assembled in Japan.

A.22:  I look for that tag, I look for that.

B.23:  I do too.

A.24:  Because, I, w-, uh, yesterday I bought a curling iron for my daughter and
there was two that were the same price and one had a made in America, you
know, tag,

B.25:  Oh, really.

A.26:  so I just picked it up.  I said I'll buy that one.  

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  Yeah, I'm trying to be more conscientious of,

B.29:  That's ((how come)) I like Wal-Mart, you know, they try and buy (( )),

A.30:  Yeah, that's where I bought it, 

B.31:  Did you.

A.32:  as a matter of fact, yeah.

B.33:  That's why I prefer, er-, if I'm going to shop at a discount place that's
where I like to shop,

A.34:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, 

B.35:  is because of that.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  Because I (( )) we ought to keep stuff at home and,

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  but [throat_clearing] no, I don't think I have returned anything in a, you
know, long time, uh.

A.40:  Yeah, yeah but you know, I think our expects, expectations are a lot lower
than they used to be.

B.41:  Yeah, I do too.

A.42:  You know, just in general when you buy something, you never, I mean,

B.43:  I don-, I never expect anything to, I'm amazed when things last, 

A.44:  And, and, 

B.45:  like my refrigerator, here ten years, you know, I'm amazed, but.

A.46:  Right.  Yeah, I'm always waiting for something to go on it, but.

B.47:  Me too [laughter].

A.48:  And if something does, don't you always try to fix it before you ever bring
it in because you know you're never going to see it again [laughter].

B.49:  Yeah right.  But now days, uh, getting it fixed is almost as much as going
out and buying a new one.

A.50:  Th-, it's worse, the service is worse.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  It really is, than buying new, because, um, people just don't know how to
fix things now and,

B.53:  I know it, 

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  they don't keep up with the new technology, you know an,  

A.56:  Right and cars, that's really bad too.

B.57:  Oh, that's the worse.

A.58:  We have, uh, mini van and the door, the sliding door on it has never worked
right and we've had it back twice to have parts replaced and stuff,

B.59:  Have you real-,

A.60:  and they just can't, you know, I don't, I, I don't, I think there was
just something wrong with the door originally and th-, I don't think the
service people have the foggiest idea of how to fix it.

B.61:  I know it and, you know, I, you think you ought to take it back to the
dealer because they know them but gosh they're so high, they just rip you off.

A.62:  Oh, they're terrible.  Oh, I, I try to avoid the dealer unless, you know.

B.63:  I do too, I absolutely have to.

A.64:  I think they, that's the worst service I've ever gotten anywhere is in a
dealer.

B.65:  Me too, and if they'd only realize that, that's what, what gets me back
to,

A.66:  Right.

B.67:  I have quit Ford and Chevrolet both because the dealers were so lousy
they gave me lousy service, they,

A.68:  Yeah.

B.69:  and, uh, so I've, it wasn't the car s-, well it was the car but I think
the car could have been taken care of,

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  if, if the dealer had backed it up, but they didn't.

A.72:  Right, but you know, we're not from this part of the country and it, I've
never had, uh, we're from up north in New England and boy it is, uh, real
different up there with the service.

B.73:  Is it really.

A.74:  Really different, whe-, you make an appointment for a certain time during
the day so you don't have to always drop it off first thing in the morning,

B.75:  Oh really.

A.76:  and you drop it off and sometimes they run late, but never, they never
keep it, I mean, I can't say never, I just say in my experience they'll say
well, you know, they'll get it, if they're, if they're not going to get it
done they will at least tell you.

B.77:  Yeah, I've had my ca-,

A.78:  Down here they just lie to you.

B.79:  My car has been in the shop since a we-, a week ago Saturday I put it in,

A.80:  Uh!

B.81:  for a new vinyl top and some hail damage.

A.82:  Uh-huh, oh.

B.83:  And (( )) I bummed a ride to work all week long, 

A.84:  Yeah.

B.85:  well, you know, I still had to go to the grocery store and to the bank,

A.86:  Yeah.

B.87:  and you, I just have to have a car,

A.88:  Right.

B.89:  so I finally ended up renting a car and I, I, you know.

A.90:  #That's ridiculous that you have to do that.#

B.91:  #I'm now renting a car, I,# and it may be ready next Tuesday of Wednesday.

A.92:  See, but I just can't understand that, I mean I, I because they haven't
gotten to it yet probably.

B.93:  I know it, they, uh, you, they don't people don't want to work anymore. I
I'd, t-, 

A.94:  Right, I just can't see that.

B.95:  I tried to get, uh, when I moved, I moved up here from Florida,

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:   and I wanted to get a, uh, my patio covered because down there we,
everybody had screened in porches and they're so pretty, 

A.98:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.99:  and they're so reasonable,

A.100:  Yeah.

B.101:  and everything and gosh I can't believe the prices they all quoted me,

A.102:  Really.

B.103:  I said my God, no wonder you guys are suffering up here, the, the prices
you're charging for,

A.104:  Uh, yeah.

B.105:  an, and finally up getting a, a steel, uh,

A.106:  Uh-huh.

B.107:  uh, top, but it wasn't uh, uh, I wanted an aluminum, uh, and I wanted it
insulated from the heat,

A.108:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.109:  but this is just steel.  And then he charged me, oh gosh I think eight
or nine hundred dollars.  In Orlando I got the whole thing done,

A.110:  Uh-huh.

B.111:  screened in, the carpeting, they insulated,

A.112:  No kidding.

B.113:  the, the gutters and everything for fifteen hundred dollars.

A.114:  Oh my goodness that's somethi-,

B.115:  Gosh, now up here I couldn't even begin to, I couldn't begin to afford a
room like that up here.

A.116:  Yeah, yeah.

B.117:  So I just, 

A.118:  I'll tell you another thing about, uh, about, uh, appliances too.  Um,
{pause} I'm, uh, more apt to try and get them fixed now than buy a new one
just simply to keep from throwing things away.

B.119:  Yeah.

A.120:  You know that kind of isn't back in with the ecology effort,

B.121:  Yeah.

A.122:  and, uh, and the, and the,

B.123:  And why, but I have six curling irons up there that have burned up, you
know, that I won't throw away.

A.124:  Oh I, yeah.

B.125:  I won't get them fixed either, though, you know.

A.126:  I know those, I mean those things are so cheap.  But I mean like we have a
vacuum that I got when I got married, like thirteen years ago, and it, it was
in real bad shape about five years ago,

B.127:  Uh-huh.

A.128:  and I've had it overhauled for eight, eighty dollars, I guess.  

B.129:  Yeah, but,

A.130:  And I could have bought a new one for ninety-five,

B.131:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.132:  but it still works.

B.133:  Well I have a Ki-, an old Kirby I've had for about, um, ten, fifteen
years,

A.134:  Yeah.

B.135:  and I, I'm like you I've spent eighty-six dollars on it last year, I
gue-,

A.136:  Yeah, yeah.

B.137:  having it y-, just redone and.

A.138:  I think that's better though, you know, to do.

B.139:  I do too, and it's just as good a vacuum cleaner as, 

A.140:  Right.

B.141:  because those things cost, well, you know what the price of new Kirby
vacuum cleaners right now.

A.142:  No, huh-uh.

B.143:  Just the basic, without an, any of the attachments or anything, 

A.144:  Uh-huh.

B.145:  I think is sixteen hundred dollars.  I said my gosh.

A.146:  Oh no.

B.147:  It would have to come out and clean my house by itself and serve me dinner
before I'd pay sixteen hundred dollars.

A.148:  F-, yeah, I wouldn't

B.149:  And that's without the, uh, you know, I s-,

A.150:  Ou-, everything on it.

B.151:  I couldn't believe it.

A.152:  No that's wild, boy, but.

B.153:  They're good (( )) vacuums, not that good.

A.154:  Gee, no.

B.155:  I jus-, I had a guy come out and give me, uh, a demonstration on a new
one,

A.156:  Uh-huh.

B.157:  and I s-, golly, of course he made me look like, now I keep a real clean
house, 

A.158:  Uh-huh.

B.159:  but by the time he got through with me with that new vacuum cleaner made
me look like a, you know, filthy mess, you know.

A.160:  Oh, no.

B.161:  He was sucking dead, uh, s-,

A.162:  Hey listen for sixteen hundred dollars, you just save that and put it in
the bank, you'd get new carpet in a couple of years [laughter].

B.163:  Yeah [laughter], just throw your carpet awa-, well he was sucking, uh,
you know, dead skin off of through the mattress, you know, went from the
comforter, through the sheet, an, 

A.164:  Oh, you don't --

B.165:  and he was showing me all this dead skin that you shed during the night,
((and I said)) oh, my God.

A.166:  -- you don't want t-, oh, yuck. That's gross.

B.167:  (( ))I know it. 

A.168:  I don't even want to, I don't want to know about that [laughter].

B.169:  I don't either, if I'm shedding, then I don't want to know about (( )).  As
long as I don't, can't see i-, well I let a guy talk me into, uh, a water
softener when I first moved out here.

A.170:  Uh-huh.

B.171:  A twenty-six hundred dollars (( )), 

A.172:  [Breathing].

B.173:  I just panicked after, well he kind of scared me,

A.174:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

B.175:  he just was really, uh, coming on strong and he jus-, almost threatening
me and he stayed until about ten o'clock at night and --

A.176:  You couldn't get rid of him.

B.177:  -- no and I'm not married and I think he, and I le-, let it out that I
wasn't and he was a big old guy and I thought, oh God, that was stupid,

A.178:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.179:  I should have told him I had a husb-, but I didn't.  Anyway the next day
I had this guy that works for me call and tell him that I was canc-, because
you had that three day cooling down period here,

A.180:  Uh-huh.

B.181:  and so I cancelled out of it [laughter] [breathing].

A.182:  Good, oh good!  I know that is scary, I just don't, I won't talk to
people, I mean I just tell them, I am not interested, I don't want anything
you're #selling go away.#

B.183:  #And i-, yeah, I don't care if I'm rude,# I just, that's what I do anymore,

A.184:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

B.185:  I just, I'm not interested and if they call me on the phone, I'm not
interested just clunk up.

A.186:  You know, I just read about, here's another thing that you can buy
[laughter].  

B.187:  [Laughter].

A.188:  I just read about it in the paper today, you can get this attachment
for your answering machine.

B.189:  Uh-huh.

A.190:  And what it is is it's like a little coder box and you tell all the
people that you want to talk to, like your family and your friends and stuff,

B.191:  Oh, okay.

A.192:  a three digit code and anybody who doesn't have it has to leave an
answering, answer, 

B.193:  Oh!

A.194:  a message on the answering machine so if you get somebody trying to sell
you something, they can leave their little message,

B.195:  Yeah.

A.196:  but if it's your sister or somebody they can punch in their code.

B.197:  Wow, yeah.

A.198:  Of course it costs a hundred dollars [laughter].

B.199:  Oh, naturally, naturally.

A.200:  This year, two years from now it'll be fifty.

B.201:  Yeah, right.

A.202:  I think I'll wait [laughter].

B.203:  Prob-, I'll wait and it'll come down to twelve dollars, you know, about
five years.

A.204:  Right, right.

B.205:  Well that's good.  

A.206:  Yeah that might be, come in handy if things keep getting as bad as they
do.

B.207:  Yeah, I always hated answering machines until I got mine.

A.208:  I do, I, I still don't like them.

B.209:  I don't either,

A.210:  I don't, I don't like them very much.

B.211:  I have it but I don't like it.  It was given to me and I feel like I
have to use, and it's come in handy.  I've had some messages I like,

A.212:  Yeah.

B.213:  but I almost refuse to leave messages, a-, 

A.214:  Yeah.

B.215:  my daughter, I said, well I called you and she said well I didn't get a
message, I said, I didn't leave one that's (( )) answering machines, so.

A.216:  Yeah, I know, I don't like to leave them that much.

B.217:  I don-, I feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason.

A.218:  Well of course.  But I, I know, I the thing is though, when you have an
answering machine, then you have to call everybody back.  If you don't have
one then they have to call you [laughter].

B.219:  That's right, [laughter] then you know that yo-,

A.220:  I jus-, I just was out this afternoon and I came in and I listened to
answering machine and I had a friend that called and not five minutes went by
and she called again and she said well, didn't you get my message on the
machine or do you just not want to talk to me [laughter].

B.221:  See, I know, yeah, you're right, you almost, 

A.222:  And I was like well I just sat down [laughter].

B.223:  I know, I just got in, or I have had, I've told them, I said well no I
didn't get it I guess the machine wasn't working or something like that.

A.224:  Yeah, yeah, I know.

B.225:  But (( )) know I'm lying.

A.226:  Yeah, they don't believe you.

B.227:  I know it, and I haven't had to take any of those back, um.

A.228:  No, I, I don't know whether, um.

B.229:  I think that's about the last time, well that was a gift to me, so I guess
that's,

A.230:  Yeah, I think we just, we haven't bought that much stuff lately but,
and,

B.231:  I think we all probably all have all the toys now.

A.232:  Yeah, right.

B.233:  There aren't any toys out there that we don't need so that's why we
haven't bought anything.

A.234:  Right.

B.235:  As soon as something new comes out, well prob-, I, 

A.236:  That's right.

B.237:  I guess everybody I know has got, you know V C R -s, and answering
machines and portable phones.

A.238:  Yeah, yeah.

B.239:  And I don't have a car phone, but I don't think, I hate that,

A.240:  Oh please, my goodness.

B.241:  I, I get mad when I drive up and somebody's talking on the phone.  I
think they're not driving safely. 

A.242:  Yeah.

B.243:  Did you know in England that's against the law to drive and talk on the
telephone. 

A.244:  Wow.

B.245:  And I think it ought to be he-, ...
