============================================================================

A.1:  Are, do you work outside of home?

B.2:  Uh, yes, I do, full time. 

A.3:  Do you have small children?

B.4:  No, I don't have any children. 

A.5:  Oh, okay. 

B.6:  No, uh-huh. 

A.7:  I, uh, I also work outside the home full time. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  I, I do have small children though. 

B.10:  Oh, my gosh. 

A.11:  It makes, it does make it very difficult.  I think that, uh, our culture
has, uh, broadened quite a bit so that it is very acceptable for a woman to do
so --

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  -- and, uh,

B.14:  Do you think it's gotten easier on you, personally, you know, as far as, at
work, uh, you know, other people how you interact, has it's gotten easier on
you? [TV] {faintly}.

A.15:  Uh, well, yeah, but I didn't, I, I never found it difficult --

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  -- as a woman.  My, I'm, I'm in the medical field,

B.18:  # Oh, uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # so I # don't, I, I'm not in a field that is typically a man's field, I'm
not a surgeon, I'm not a doctor, um,

B.20:  # Right.  #

A.21:  # and, #

B.22:  # [Sniffing].  #

A.23:  # so # I, I haven't, uh, oh, breached anybody's confidence on, I haven't
tried in, you know, going into a man's,

B.24:  # Yeah.  #

A.25:  # what # is typically,

B.26:  # Yeah, #

A.27:  # a # man's role,

B.28:  right. 

A.29:  are you in a, are you in a job that,

B.30:  Yeah, I'm an engineer,

A.31:  # Yes, #

B.32:  # and # so,

A.33:  you are [laughter]. 

B.34:  so, I, uh,

A.35:  you're challenged frequently. 

B.36:  I have, uh, uh, problem even when I was going through school --

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  -- I found it to be a man's world and I got a lot of static from that,

A.39:  # Yeah, it, it, #

B.40:  # and, it, my # first few years at T I, I found it to really be hard but
now that I've been there for a while it's, it's kind of a deal you have to
prove yourself and after I've been there for a while now, you know, the guys,
I'm just kind of one of the guys.  I'm, um, you know,

A.41:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.42:  # respected # and, and, and I do the same things they do.  I'm not
necessarily sure I get the pa-, the same pay but I'm pretty sure I do and, and
I feel a lot better about it.  I have a friend that had just turned forty-five
--

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  -- that's an engineer and she tells me horror stories --

A.45:  Oh, I'm sure. 

B.46:  -- of what it use to be like --

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  -- you know, you know, always getting, uh, belligerent comments like, you
ought to be at home having babies instead of doing these blueprints, and
things like that, things that would just make her cry at work, but she
couldn't cry in front of them because they'd do it more, you know,

A.49:  # Yeah.  #

B.50:  # so # she's, she, you know, builds me up and says be a strong woman and,
and present yourself professionally and, you know, builds my confidence quite a
bit --

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  -- so that's why I ask you that if, if you thought maybe times his changed
made,

A.53:  [Breathing].

B.54:  it easier on you at, at work. 

A.55:  Uh, for me personally I don't think that, um, my sex really has much to do
with, uh, with limiting me --

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  -- as a matter of fact, my, uh, employer wanted a female for my position. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  I do have trouble, um, I'm a physician assistant --

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  -- which is somewhere between a nurse and a doctor --

B.62:  Right. 

A.63:  -- and I, um, frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them --

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  -- and it is a, it's not uncommon that the, uh, it's typically Hispanic
males --

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  -- typically Hispanic males do not want me to be their medical, you know,
their, their medical care provider,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # that # day, they, um, they really have a problem with it and they'll, and
they will almost always ask me to see the doctor. 

B.70:  That is so strange. 

A.71:  Well,

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  not, not when you think of their culture though --

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  -- and their cul-, I, I'm talking about the ones who came from Mexico not
the ones that were reared in the states --

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  -- I'm talking primarily about, uh, you know, the, the guys that are over
here on work thesis --

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  -- you know, that,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # sort # of thing, but their culture is still very much thought not a
woman's thing --

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  -- and I'm a blonde and, and,

B.84:  # Yeah.  #

A.85:  # and # they are just like, you know, who is this girl [laughter]? 

B.86:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

A.87:  # Why is # she in here telling me anything? 

B.88:  This little young girl, yeah. 

A.89:  Yeah.  So, they, uh, so, that's, that's, that's the only place I've ever
even had a problem,

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # regarding # my sex.  Sometimes my size is one ((limitation)) because I
assist in surgery too,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # sometimes # I wish I were strong as a man --

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  -- but, uh, or the average man anyway. 

B.96:  Well, let me ask you this, how have, um, did children, do you feel like
children set you back or kind of went off track a little while, you know, this,
this is an issue, I'm on a women's subcommittee --

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  -- women's initiative subcommittee --

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  -- and we were discussing this, last week matter of fact, that certain
women have taken career kind of jobs, you know, and, and decided to go in and
have one or two children and then got back on track and they didn't see that
as a setback but,

A.101:  I, I don't, I don't see how I can ever get back on track.  I don't see,

B.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.103:  # that # as being a possibility.  I will, I will never work,

B.104:  # In other words if, #

A.105:  # seventy hour, #

B.106:  you wouldn't of had,

A.107:  weeks again. 

B.108:  Oh, yeah, that's what they were saying,

A.109:  # I mean I don't, #

B.110:  # before they had children # they were working like crazy people. 

A.111:  Yeah, seventy hour weeks, every week, I mean it was nothing,

B.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.113:  # I # mean, that was what I did every week and, but I don't, not only, I
mean I can't,

B.114:  [Sniffing].

A.115:  any longer.  My husband works a full time job outside the home too --

B.116:  Right. 

A.117:  -- and not only, I mean, I, I physically cannot do it,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # because # of day-care, et cetera --

B.120:  Uh-huh. 

A.121:  -- but I don't want to,

B.122:  # Right [laughter].  #

A.123:  # the desire # is not there --

B.124:  Yeah. 

A.125:  -- uh, and I am not someone, I, I, I, I didn't think I had the desire to be
a mother,

B.126:  # Uh-uh, #

A.127:  # even, #

B.128:  Right. 

A.129:  and yet the children had transformed me and, and, and the mothering has
transformed me to the point, I don't wa-, if, if something happened and I no
longer had a job --

B.130:  Uh-huh,

A.131:  -- #I don't even think,#

B.132:  # I'd be okay [laughter].  #

A.133:  I would go interview again. 

B.134:  Yeah. 

A.135:  I, I, you know, it's, it's, I mean, I love what I do but I love my children
so much more --

B.136:  Yeah. 

A.137:  -- and there's, there is a guilt that goes along with leaving them to, in
the hands of other people --

B.138:  Right, right. 

A.139:  -- that aren't you. 

B.140:  And a fear. 

A.141:  There's a fear there too, I'm not really afraid of what might be happening
to them,

B.142:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.143:  # in # an, in an abuse issue,

B.144:  # Yeah.  #

A.145:  # but # I'm afraid of what they're missing. 

B.146:  Right. 

A.147:  I'm afraid of what, of what's not being, you know, uh, di-, discussed with
them or what, or what,

B.148:  [Breathing]. 

A.149:  opportunities are missed that I could fill in --

B.150:  Yeah,

A.151:  -- so that,

B.152:  Yeah,

A.153:  fear's there. 

B.154:  yeah, yeah.  I, I hear that, uh, there's all men in my group, I'm, I'm one
of two women, the secretary is a woman [laughter], 

A.155:  [Laughter].

B.156:  and these men, a lot of them have, uh, small children, either just one
or, or two, you know, babies because we're all fairly young and, and I hear the
men saying that a lot, you know, and,

A.157:  # Yeah.  #

B.158:  # I # think that is a culture change that, you know, their lives have
changed since they had children,

A.159:  [Breathing]. 

B.160:  you know, they don't want to work that sixty hours anywhere.  They want
to hurry up and get home, you know, I can't wait to get home so I can play with
my son [laughter], 

A.161:  # Right, #

B.162:  # so, #

A.163:  see the kids. 

B.164:  and they have the same concerns as, not necessary an abuse guilt but, you
know, thinking, well, you know, if I, I could spend more time then they could
learn so much more, you know. 

A.165:  Ju-, just learn about me,

B.166:  # Yeah, Yeah.  #

A.167:  # learn what # I want them to be, learn the things that are truly important
to me because if you just tell them,

B.168:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.169:  # it # doesn't count --

B.170:  Right. 

A.171:  -- it's what they see, routinely that they remember --

B.172:  Right. 

A.173:  -- it's that they see routinely that you deal with the, you know, with the
gardener in a, in a nice manner --

B.174:  Uh-huh. 

A.175: -- uh, that they see routinely that you are, uh, you're doing Bible study or
--

B.176:  Yeah. 

A.177:  -- prayer group or whatever you are --

B.178:  Uh-huh. 

A.179:  -- they need to see that instead of you just telling them, well, after you
go to bed at night I, uh, you know, stuff, envelopes, envelopes for the Cripple
Children's,

B.180:  [Laughter].

A.181:  Association,

B.182:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.183:  # you know, # that doesn't count, they need to see what it is you spend
your time and your energy doing,

B.184:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.185:  # in order # to get part of you, otherwise they grow up with parts of their
child care, or there care givers. 

B.186:  That's right.  Their nannies and, you know,

A.187:  # Uh-huh, #

B.188:  # right, # day-cares,

A.189:  Yeah. 

B.190:  that's really interesting [breathing]. 

A.191:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's a tough thing, I don't, if you, if you have
children, you know.

B.192:  Yeah.  I was going to say if, uh, when I get to that point, I'm sure I will
know it, I see it from day-to-day, like I say, th-, the men are experiencing
this,

A.193:  # Uh-uh.  #

B.194:  # you # know, a lot of them, one of them just had a child within the last
year and he has totally changed,

A.195:  # It's incredible.  #

B.196:  # from this # seventy hour work person to somebody that goes, God, I ready
to get out of here, you know, I need to go to day-care [laughter]  and,

A.197:  # Yeah.  #

B.198:  # he # routinely calls the day-care during the day, you know, like can I
talk to my daughter, you know, and, and, uh,

A.199:  It is the most life changing experience I have,

B.200:  # [Laughter].  #

A.201:  # ever, # ever, I mean, I, I had no idea.  I never even wanted children --

B.202:  Yeah. 

A.203:  -- and, uh, then we were blessed with one in an expected fashion --

B.204:  Uh-huh. 

A.205:  -- and, I mean, I just, I can't believe it, I mean I can't believe this is
me --

B.206:  Yeah. 

A.207:  -- and neither can anybody else, you know [laughter], 

B.208:  # [Laughter].  #

A.209:  # I # mean, but it's just phenomenal,

B.210:  # That'll, #

A.211:  # it # is absolutely phenomenal. 

B.212:  they'll me too, and my family, they'll go oh, my God,

A.213:  # [Laughter].  #

B.214:  # you've # got children are you fixing to have a child.  They won't believe
it, they'll pass,
