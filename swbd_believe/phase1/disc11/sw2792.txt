A.1:  Okay?

B.2:  Sure, go ahead. 

A.3:  What kind of books do you like to read?

B.4:  ((Oh)), I like all kinds of books. 

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Mostly, uh, something, I like like true life,

A.7:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.8:  # ((not, uh)),# you know, documentaries or real stories about real people
and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  And, uh, I also like romantic novels.  I like, uh, I like READERS DIGEST,
believe it or not. 

A.11:  Yeah, so do I. 

B.12:  I usually read that from cover to cover. 

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it. 

A.15:  Right. 

B.16:  You know, that kind of a thing.  Uh, as far as like real novels, I haven't
gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  I wish I had in, in some senses but I don't have time really as much as I
would like to, to get into that kind of thing.  How about you?

A.19:  Um, well, I like, like you said, real life, um, I like biographies of
people's lives,

B.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.21:  # like, # especially like athletes, for some reason it seems to interest
me, like people that make a big comeback or,

B.22:  # Sure.  #

A.23:  # you # know, Orel Hershiser, things like that. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  And, um, I like to read books on improve, like family, marriage, you know,
things that are written by like Christian authors or, um, doctors about family
and, you know, how to improve your home and all that kind of thing.  Um, I
like to re-, the magazines I to rel-, I like to read (( )), I read a lot of
bicycling magazines.  They're, I mainly look at the pictures and stuff, but
they usually have some good articles in it.

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  But, uh, I don't know I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like
to read.  I, I'm more true, you know,

B.28:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.29:  # fi-, uh, # nonfiction.  I haven't found a lot of, uh, fiction books that
I really like but, uh, not to say I wouldn't,

B.30:  # Yeah.  #

A.31:  # eventually # I mean.  What was the last book you read?

B.32:  Uh, jeez, let me think, it, I tell you I haven't read a book in a long
time.  And it, I can't even really remember.  Uh, I think it was a romantic
novel by Danielle Steel or one of those. 

A.33:  Really?

B.34:  You know [laughter],  yeah, honestly.  Um, I don't do as much reading, like
I say, as I would like to. 

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  (( )) working a lot of hours at work and,

A.37:  Really?

B.38:  Yeah, and then, of course,

A.39:  # I know.  #

B.40:  # we have # a home so it's, you know, a lot time is spent doing things as
far as the yard work or housework or,

A.41:  # Yeah.  #

B.42:  # you # know, that type of thing. 

A.43:  I, I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like
about eleven more books than I would have read last year, but so far I've only
read like two books and so I'm not doing very well but,

B.44:  But see I do crafts too,

A.45:  # Yeah.  #

B.46:  # so # it's hard, I, if I have a minute that's what I, I do. 

A.47:  Yeah, I find it's real hard, I let papers, newspapers stack up and
magazines stack up, if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them.

B.48:  That's the, and, and that's like myself I've, I've, I miss it, because I
really find it a very relaxing hobby too. 

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  I really do and, um, I don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book,
you know, it, it,

A.51:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.52:  # it's # like an escape for me.  I don't know about you. 

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  It's, if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by
and I, I look up at the clock and say, oh, my word, you know. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  In fact, I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V. 

A.57:  Yeah, oh, I would too.  Um,

B.58:  But I think you get out of the habit, like you say, you have to like kind
of set yourself,

A.59:  Kind of train your mind. 

B.60:  Yep. 

A.61:  Have you ever read, uh, or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS?

B.62:  No. 

A.63:  That was one of the books I read this year, and it's really fast paced and
intense.  It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was ar-, it was
one of the best I read, I mean, it was real good, and it was, um, it was one of
the few books that like it, you know, just hurry up and go through without
putting down, you know. 

B.64:  Yeah, right.  See that's the other problem I have.  If I start into
something and I really enjoy what I'm reading,

A.65:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.66:  # then # I have a terrible time getting away from it too.  I'll stay up
until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because I'm so engrossed
in it and then before you know it, it's time to get up and go to work.  You
know, that type of thing.

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  That's why I, I don't know I'm, I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff
like that.  Even if I'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to
the end, sometimes I'll [laughter], do the same thing.

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  I don't know what you would call it, maybe I have a problem [laughter]. 

A.71:  No, I'm sure it's fast (( )) or something. 

B.72:  It's terrible, I, I really like books that, that you can get into and
that's that.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  I know what you mean.  I like reading late at night right before I
go to bed sometimes I just sleep better or something. 

B.74:  Oh, yeah, you do you kind of get relaxed, that's true. 

A.75:  But, uh,

B.76:  I have a lot of craft books that I have too and, uh, magazines.  I like
PEOPLE, you know, those things that are about real people. 

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  And, um, I, I like to, uh, read about people who have been a successful,

A.79:  # Yeah.  #

B.80:  # you # know, who, who made a success of their lives. 

A.81:  Which, what book have you read that is along those lines,

B.82:  # Uh, #

A.83:  # that # was really good?

B.84:  To, to give you specific titles I, I can't. 

A.85:  Well, how about who,

B.86:  Like I say, haven't done it in, in such a long time. 

A.87:  Do you know who it was about?

B.88:  Um, well, I went to, uh, seminar on, uh, it was for, by American business
and some of the people, uh, what the heck was his name, I'm trying to think. 
He's one of the, uh, Paroe, and um, it was more like, oh, it was tapes and
things that they had about him, too. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  How he started out as just a salesman and now he's, you know,
multimillionaire and that type of thing, and how you have to, uh, be
aggressive and, you know, really want something for yourself and that type of
stuff.  It's like up to you, in other words, whatever happens in your life.

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  It's not up, it's not someone else, you have to do it. 

A.93:  Yeah. 

B.94:  And I find that fascinating that people, you know, can do that kind of
thing.  Just make up their minds that that's it.  You know, have this one
direction. 

A.95:  And then do it. 

B.96:  Do it.  I can't, I'm not that focused on something. 

A.97:  [Laughter]. 

B.98:  I, I'm off in all directions. 

A.99:  [Laughter]. 

B.100:  Um, and I'm not, uh, uh, a planner which I wish I was. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  You know, kind of off the wall.  If someone says, do you want to do this
tonight, uh, and I got a mountain of things to do, it's okay, you know, we do
it. 

A.103:  Uh-huh, huh.  Well, that's all right. 

B.104:  I know, I know, but I wish I was more the other way. 

A.105:  You're more fun though, see.  You're not ((ridged)) right?

B.106:  Yeah, right I, I, that's ((see)), I like it that way though.  I, I, I
would, I don't want to change that part of me.

A.107:  That's good. 

B.108:  That's funny, e-, even though I admire someone who isn't,

A.109:  # Yeah.  #

B.110:  # like # I am, you know, and, and I wish I could be more that way but,

A.111:  There may be some schools you could read about and learn. 

B.112:  That's true, that's true.  How many people do you supervise?

A.113:  Uh, about twenty. 

B.114:  Oh, that's not bad. 

A.115:  No. 

B.116:  That's not bad at all. 

A.117:  No. 

B.118:  Do you like your job?

A.119:  Sometimes. 

B.120:  [Laughter]. 

A.121:  Sometimes more than others.  But, yeah, I do. 

B.122:  Oh, that's,

A.123:  # I've been there about three years.  #

B.124:  # oh, that's important.  Do you have # a family?

A.125:  Yeah, I just got married last year and, um, most of my family's in Indiana.

B.126:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.127:  So, I've only been in Texas three years. 

B.128:  Do you like it?

A.129:  Yeah, I do.  I love the weather down here. 

B.130:  I, I loved, I loved Abilene too.  That's what I liked, too, is the weather.

A.131:  Yeah, I know. 

B.132:  Except for tornados [laughter]. 

A.133:  Boy they, they have storms here I've,

B.134:  Yes they do.  And it, it,

A.135:  # Hail and thunder and, #

B.136:  # it's so surprising how # it just happens, you know. 

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  Unpredictable. 

A.139:  Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago?

B.140:  Uh, no.  Oh, I've been up here about three.  Uh, we were down there, uh,
from eighty-six to, eighty-five to eighty-six, no, uh, ei-, well, part of
eighty-four to eighty-six I should say. 

A.141:  Yeah, boy I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car, a lot
of people had their cars totaled just from hail.

B.142:  Oh, wow. 

A.143:  I think State Farm went bankrupt. 

B.144:  Oh, jeez. 

A.145:  Just about [laughter].  But, uh,

B.146:  I know the whole situation is bad up here, we're having a terrible time
with the recession.

A.147:  Really?

B.148:  Yeah, yeah.  It's not good at all. 

A.149:  Huh. 

B.150:  I know things are pretty booming down there.  I heard they sold ((Johnson
City)) ((though)).

A.151:  Yeah, and Colorado Springs. 

B.152:  And Colorado Springs?

A.153:  Yeah, I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was
telling me about it. 

B.154:  Oh, wow. 

A.155:  They just sold it. 

B.156:  Amazing. 

A.157:  Closed up and moved down to McKinney. 

B.158:  Oh, well, that's good.  At least they kept the business part of it. 

A.159:  Yeah. 

B.160:  It's scary though I'm telling you. 

A.161:  ((I know)).

B.162:  I don't know, and, well, you know, with the other part of this thing was,
how do you feel that this influences family. 

A.163:  How do I feel what?

B.164:  That, that books influence, do you know how to use them in your life or to
influence,

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  I, I feel like it's important for young children to read too. 

A.167:  Yeah. 

B.168:  And what you read to them.  When my children wer-, were younger, of course,
they were all married and grown and I have grandchildren now, they were, uh, I,
I read to them a lot. 

A.169:  That's good. 

B.170:  And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.

A.171:  That's re-, yeah. 

B.172:  I'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read.  Uh, where
a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all, and I think it's
important,

A.173:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.174:  # because, uh, # even today where people are so illiterate and they go off
to school and really nothing happens, I mean, they don't learn anything.  It's
because they can't read. 

A.175:  Yeah, it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school,

B.176:  # Yeah.  #

A.177:  # and # that I work with and people, I mean, I get memos all the time
across my desk and things are misspelled and,

B.178:  # Oh, it's be-, unbelievable,#

A.179:  # it's really, #

B.180:  isn't it?

A.181:  It's pretty sad. 

B.182:  Yeah. 

A.183:  A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read, you know. 

B.184:  Exactly, and I think that that's why reading is so important,

A.185:  Yeah. 

B.186:  because, uh, I think even mentally when you can do some,
