============================================================================

B.1:  Well, what books do you like?

A.2:  Um, a broad spectrum, [laughter] my tastes seem to change over the years,
um, [clicking] {mouth click sound}I like, uh, uh, mysteries, adventure, some
science fiction.  I like, uh, Sagan, I re-, I read just about everything that
he puts out.

B.3:  Uh-huh. 

A.4:  Um, Robert Ludlum --

B.5:  Great. 

A.6:  -- and I've just started, uh, I got a whole set of books on, uh, Sherlock
Holmes. 

B.7:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.8:  # So, # I'm just getting into that, uh, that's kind of interesting, it's
unique. 

B.9:  Yeah. 

A.10:  How about yourself?

B.11:  Yeah, those are great, uh, I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for years, and I
think,

A.12:  # Oh, you have.  #

B.13:  # I've read most # of his stuff multiple numbers of times. 

A.14:  # Uh.  #

B.15:  # I # just find it very relaxing and very enjoyable, and I always hope for
my memory to, to fail me so after a couple of years I can pick up a story and
read it again. 

A.16:  Oh, okay, uh, I got a whole s-, I got a set for Christmas. 

B.17:  That's great. 

A.18:  So, I've just started intes-, in to him.  I haven't, uh, I've, uh, I think,
uh, they had, uh, uh, Sherlock Holmes, uh, miniseries on, uh, on educational T
V,

B.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.20:  # uh, # channel two up here, I'm not sure what it is down there.  And they
had, uh, uh, some of his I, I started watching that and I got interested in it
so that's why I got the gift. 

B.21:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.22:  So you've been doing it for a long time. 

B.23:  Yeah, I started reading them years and years ago, whe-, I, it's and I, I'm
not really much of a mystery reader, although I've always liked Sherlock
Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances, um, and
he's, uh, a former jockey and he writes mystery stories and they always
involve horse racing in one form or another.  He's very, very good, if, uh,
you've never read him, that would be a great opportunity.

A.24:  No, I me-, is Dick Frances [talking]. 

B.25:  His name is Dick Frances and any book store owner will know who Dick
Frances is.

A.26:  Uh, yeah. 

B.27:  And you can pick up any of his stuff and you can just sort of try it and if
you like his style, well he's written, I'd say, twenty or twenty-five --

A.28:  Oh, okay, yeah, um. 

B.29:  -- novels, you know.  He's, he's quite, quite clever. 

A.30:  My taste runs, runs to, uh, Ludlum, you know that type of,

B.31:  The adventure stuff, yeah. 

A.32:  Yeah adventure, yeah, uh, some of that gets, I don't know, I think they've
got ghost writers now on a lot of them and, uh, they just put their name to it
because years ago, either that or my tastes are changing, um, they just don't
have the same depth that they seem to have before.

B.33:  Huh, yeah, you know, I always suspected, uh, uh, uh, Michener of doing
that.  You know, I read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his
later stuff, they would be these long, long, long passages that were just of
inferior quality. 

A.34:  It was, yeah, it was, uh, just to fill a page. 

B.35:  Yeah, I mean, I just got the feeling that he sort of has a (( )) of, of
students and he says, okay go write three chapters on this and he, and he kind
of, he might write some stuff, I don't think he writes all his stuff, every
word.  I may be wrong. 

A.36:  Yeah, you're probably right, um, [clicking]  uh, I'm trying to think of
that, uh, Stephen King. 

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  Have you read any of his? [/Talking]. 

B.39:  I've read a couple of his things, I, I just wasn't that crazy about him. 

A.40:  # [Laughter].  #

B.41:  # Which # really puts me in the, I know, in the vast minority [laughter]. 

A.42:  No, no, no, no, I've, I've read a couple of them that weren't too bad, um,
my oldest boy is into him so he's, oh, you've got to read this dad, you've got
to read that dad but I'm not, that's not, really not my, uh, cup of tea. 

B.43:  Yeah. 

A.44:  Except the, [clicking]  the latest one he's got out, uh, it's, uh, fourteen
hundred or fifteen hundred page, he had, he had published it about ten years
ago. 

B.45:  Huh. 

A.46:  [Clicking]  And he's got it out now with the, with the, the full text.  No
cuts and no, he, he explains that when he did it the first time because of
publishing costs they asked, they asked him to cut it back a third. 

B.47:  Yeah. 

A.48:  So that's what he did.  Now he's got it out and, [clicking]  I can't even
think of the name of it.  But it's starting out pretty good. 

B.49:  # Huh.  #

A.50:  # Um, # it's something that's not, like his present style. 

B.51:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.52:  Um, but other than that, um, [clicking]  I've read DUNE, I don't know if
you've read DUNE. 

B.53:  I read DUNE years ago and I again, you, you, i-, uh, I just did not care
for DUNE.  I read through it all, it was laborious, I, I,

A.54:  # Uh, #

B.55:  # felt # I had to get through it.  And when I put it down I never wanted to
read another thing by that guy again. 

A.56:  To read it again, yeah.  I've read, uh, I like the original DUNE, and then
they had, uh, he's had two others after it,

B.57:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.58:  # which I # didn't care for at all, so I kind of fell off. 

B.59:  Yeah,

A.60:  Um. 

B.61:  But again, I realize, I mean, I, all my friends were saying how great DUNE
was and I just could not, could not get into it.  I read the whole thing but I
didn't, en-, didn't enjoy it that much. 

A.62:  Have you read any science fiction at all?

B.63:  I really read a lot of science fiction and Asimov is one of my favorite
authors. 

A.64:  Yeah. 

B.65:  I think his stuff is, is great, just going back to his very early works and
almost anything he writes, I try to read. 

A.66:  Even, I haven't read any of his recent, but I've read some of his old, uh,
uh, things and in, yeah, I, I like him, he's, he's not too bad.  Some of it's,
uh, not him but some of the other science fiction, I mean, it's just so,
((well)), uh, like, uh, Tolkien. 

B.67:  Yeah. 

A.68:  I never could get into him. 

B.69:  Interesting, and I was just crazy about Tolkien.  I read his stuff and I
reread it and I read the whole twelve hundred pages aloud to my son when he
was, uh, a young boy, when he was about eight or nine.  We would just read ten
pages every night and I just did that, you know, for, a half a year until I'd
read the whole thing out loud.

A.70:  Huh, that's interesting. 

B.71:  And, uh, [laughter]. 

A.72:  Yeah, m-, um, both my boys are into him, but I don't know, it's just
something, I, I don't know if I had the time or put myself in the frame of mind
for it. 

B.73:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.74:  What do you do, what do you do for, uh, educational {pause} anything?

B.75:  Well, uh, uh, being a college professor there's just a certain amount of
academic reading I do as a matter of course. 

A.76:  Oh, so you have to, you're forced into it, no matter what [laughter]. 

B.77:  We-, well, yeah, forced is probably not too strong a word, but,

A.78:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.79:  # to keep # up in your field, you usually have to do some, uh, some
technical reading.  But, uh, I actually like, um, for technical reading, I like
to read what I call, uh, soft core science, like, uh, DISCOVERY MAGAZINE. 

A.80:  That's, I get that. 

B.81:  Which I like very much, and, uh, and then, uh, National Science Foundation
puts out an excellent publication called MOSAIC with, uh, th-, and they get
some of the best scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that
can be understood.  They're not highly technical but they're not, probably not
as simplified as in DISCOVERY.

A.82:  Huh. 

B.83:  But they're very good, except I couldn't, I just got on their list somehow,
because at one time I did some research for them and I'm not really sure how
one would go about getting this but it's, it's, excellent, uh, for finding out
what's going on in fields other than your own.

A.84:  Yeah, have, have you ever heard of the SOURCE BOOK PROJECT. 

B.85:  I don't believe so.  SOURCE BOOK PROJ-,

A.86:  Uh, it deals with anomalies, um, whether it's, uh, animal, vegetable or
mineral or, or geologic anomalies. 

B.87:  Oh, no, no. 

A.88:  You know, like, uh, [throat_clearing]  uh, ((raining)) fish, you know, that
type of thing. 

B.89:  Oh, that would be fascinating. 

A.90:  Or the, uh, the, uh, is it the (( )) mounds in, um, Kentucky, I think, or
Tennessee. 

B.91:  I don't know, {pause} what, what about them?

A.92:  Well it's just the SOURCE BOOK PROJECT.  Uh, it gives you a short, uh,
synopsis of, of whatever they're talking about and then it gives you all the
sources that you can look up,

B.93:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.94:  # if # you're interested in it. 

B.95:  I see, okay, that would be a very interesting thing. 

A.96:  And they, they tried to, uh, uh, sell out the, uh, sensationalism, you
know, like flying saucers and all that kind of stuff.

B.97:  Right. 

A.98:  The things that they, that they publish are documented sightings, you know,
and, an, or, digs, or whatever. 

B.99:  Uh-huh. 

A.100:  Uh, I'm kind of in to that, I'm, uh, uh, I belong to the (( )) Archeology
Society, so I like going back and, you know, digging up things.  It gives me,
you know, uh, it's kind of a, a thrill to see something that nobody's looked at
for two or three thousand years. 

B.101:  Yeah, do you have any interest in Stonehenge, or did you ever have any?

A.102:  Uh, as far as being, uh, yes, that type of thing, yeah, that's what these
(( )) mounds were supposedly like, early Stonehenge in America.  Uh,

B.103:  # Wean.  #

A.104:  # yeah, # I'm fascinated with that kind of stuff, in fact, just recently,
uh, a few days ago, they discovered a cave,
