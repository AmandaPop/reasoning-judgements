==========================================================================

A.1:  All right. 

B.2:  What, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?

A.3:  I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force. 

B.4:  Yeah. 

A.5:  Few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids
exclusively.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I, I, I grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies and, uh,
my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.  She didn't start working
until I was, um, well into high school.

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  So, I, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's
a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids. 

A.9:  Yeah, true.  Well, mine taught kindergarten but she was always, uh, I guess
her schedule was shorter so she was always, uh,

B.10:  # Always home by the time you got home.  #

A.11:  # home, yeah.  Yeah, that, that statistic I guess # has been growing every
year ((it's like something around)) sixty, sixty-five percent or so now. 

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  Uh, I'm not sure what the future holds for that whether,

B.14:  It seems like there's, ((it seems that there's)) a grass roots, um, effort
or whatever going on I, I, um, clean houses part-time,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.16:  # and # almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are
mothers that don't work [laughter]. 

A.17:  Huh. 

B.18:  Um,

A.19:  # That's unusual [laughter].  #

B.20:  # they are, th-, # they're all, um, it's, and it's, I think it's kind of a
new movement it's going back towards, you know, women have come into the work
force in the last twenty, thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to
the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and
try to give the kids quality time.

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  And I, I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot
more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  Um, I think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that a
lot of, a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are, um,
vice-presidents of companies and I think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's
more the upper-class people,

A.25:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.26:  # um, # I don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where I don't, I
don't have children yet, but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with
my kids.  But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not
going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on
one income.

A.27:  Yeah, that is tough.  Yeah, we're looking at that now, my wife's about six
months along. 

B.28:  Uh-huh.  I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home
with your kids.

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  You know, it's going to kind of [throat_clearing] kind of go along with the
B M W in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.

A.31:  True. 

B.32:  Um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever. 

A.33:  Yeah.  I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do
stay home.  I would think it would be women that were working full-time. 

B.34:  Yeah, believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real
busy when they are home. 

A.35:  Huh. 

B.36:  Um, they're real active in volunteer work. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  Um, one of the women is real active with, uh, Muscular Dystrophy.  And, uh,
does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis but it's still, it's
almost like a job, she just doesn't get paid for it.

A.39:  Huh.  Well, I guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep
them active. 

B.40:  Yeah.  When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home or is
she going to,

A.41:  # Yeah, we're, #

B.42:  # go back # to work?

A.43:  we're going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.  {Very
faint} What do you think?

B.44:  That, that, that, I would, I would like to be able to do that. 

A.45:  Yeah, we think it's, uh, that important and I, I kind of hope that the
trend goes back in that direction.  I'm a, a counselor and a therapist,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # and # I work with adolescents, and I see some of the problems the kids
have when they don't have a real good family structure. 

B.48:  Yeah, I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation
before me,

A.49:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.50:  # uh, # were, you know, mom was like, um, Mrs.  Cleaver, uh, you know, June
Cleaver or whatever, where the, the attitudes were a lot different.  Um, as far
as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more, um, ther-, there wasn't
a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,

A.51:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.52:  # um, # a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society, I
think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back
then as far as hig-, higher standards. 

A.53:  True.  Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore
in terms of being the father figure and with women working so much they're
kind of pulled out of it too.

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media. 

B.56:  Yeah, that's true. 

A.57:  And that's, you know, that's contributed,

B.58:  And I think, I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future. 

A.59:  Yeah, maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the
time, so.  If there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they
could work, you know, there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in
computers at home,

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # and # those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge
the gap {pause}.

B.62:  Yeah, I, I think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it,
as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent {pause}. What, how do
you, what do you think?

A.63:  About?

B.64:  That as far as do-, do you think there's going to be still a family unit
or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single
parenting?

A.65:  The [laughter] ((balance)) I don't, the, the divorce rate keeps hovering
around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while.  Um,
that's hard to say.  Families are such a strange configuration anymore.  Um,
I, I see a lot of families where, you know, in the, in the back, I grew up
about the same time you did,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # and # back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be
responsible. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  Uh, nowadays it's not the case, kids don't, kids are bombarded with all
kinds of junk and one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more
income in the family with both parents working.  They get bombarded with junk
and they don't have to do anything around the house.  They never learned to be
responsible when,

B.70:  # Yeah.  #

A.71:  # the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a
while and they come back, and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are
living at home with mom and dad [laughter] so,

B.72:  # Yeah.  #

A.73:  # you # know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after
generation but not really on purpose. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  So.  It's not, not a real functional situation anyway.  So, you know, I
don't know it's, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single
parent type families and the (( )) families, as long as we've got so many other
crazy things going on in society. 

B.76:  Yeah, I, I think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to
even exist anymore.  (( )) like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are,
um, you know, two parent families.

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  That's pretty sad. 

A.79:  Yeah, it is, I guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change
of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.  And I,
I don't know we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income it, it
may be tough but we may have to give up on some, some things.

B.80:  I, I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that. 

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  And it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile. 

A.83:  Yeah, I think so too. 

@@B.84:  Well, I, I need to go ahead and, and wrap it up. 

A.85:  Okay. 

B.86:  Um, it was really nice talking to you. 

A.87:  Well, I've enjoyed it, Stephanie. 

B.88:  And, uh, thanks a lot. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  Okay, bye-bye. 

A.91:  Bye-bye.
