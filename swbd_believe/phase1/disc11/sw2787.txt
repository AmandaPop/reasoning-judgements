======================================================================

@A.1:  All right, Cliff, what kind of hobbies do you have?

B.2:  Too many [laughter]. 

A.3:  Too many?

B.4:  I have,

A.5:  Not enough time for them all, huh?

B.6:  I, uh, have photography or I read a lot.  I also, uh, work with computers
as both hobby and, and work.

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  And, uh, those are the main ones I suppose.  I also design kites. 

A.9:  Really?

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  Wow, that's interesting.  Well, what all do you have to take into
consideration when you design a kite?

B.12:  The ones I like are the ones that are simple and cheap. 

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  I have one that I made from newspaper that, uh, you can't get much cheaper
than old newspaper. 

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  But it doesn't have any sticks or anything of that sort.  It flies like a
sled in other words. 

A.17:  [Laughter]  Are you, uh, have you made any money off your hobby?

B.18:  Oh, no, no.  My hobbies are hobbies [laughter]. 

A.19:  Yeah, so what do you like to read when you read?

B.20:  I read, uh, both nonfiction and fiction. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  Most of the name brand authors and so forth. 

A.23:  Yeah.  Uh, does that take up, do you, uh, watch any T V or anything like
that or,

B.24:  Oh, yeah, everybody watches T V, I suppose but I, uh, I, uh, not married to
it, let's put it that way. 

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  If I have a good book, I would rather read it than watch T V. 

A.27:  Well, that's good.  That's cool.  Um,

B.28:  How about yourself?

A.29:  Me? I, uh, I play chess.  I, uh, lift weights, play basketball, ride bikes,
that's my exercise part of my hobbies, I guess. 

B.30:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

A.31:  And I read, usually the Bible or some other type of Christian literature.
Um, let's see, uh, I like to play cards.  Uh, don't watch any T V though
because we don't have a T V, but, uh, every once in a while I'll sneak over to
some friend's house and we'll watch a ball game or something.

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  Uh, we're just, we're pretty much new in Texas, so, we're just trying to
get into the lifestyle like, we'd like to go see a rodeo sometime and, and we,
my wife and I went to a, one Ranger's game, and we'd like to go a few more
times, maybe see Nolan pitch one time.

B.34:  Should have been out the other night, right? [Laughter]. 

A.35:  Yeah, exactly.  That would have been the best.  Were you watching that
game?

B.36:  Well, we got to see the illegal broadcast that channel five had at the end
of the game. 

A.37:  Oh. 

B.38:  They were supposed to just show a quick flick and they, it turned out that
was the last batter that he was pitching to so they just stayed on the, uh,
network,

A.39:  # Yeah.  #

B.40:  # and # I understand that the producers got themselves in a little trouble,
they'll probably have to pay a, some compensation of some sort, for that. 

A.41:  Oh, that's terrible.  ((Should show)) a little bit of,

B.42:  But we got to see it anyway, so, [laughter]. 

A.43:  Yeah.  Show a little bit of,

B.44:  They showed a little initiative. 

A.45:  Oh, yeah, get your priorities in line,

B.46:  # Right.  #

A.47:  # see # a little bit of history. 

B.48:  Where did you, uh, come to Texas from?

A.49:  From Indiana. 

B.50:  From Indiana. 

A.51:  Yeah.  My wife and I both went to Purdue and she got a job with Texas
Instruments down here,

B.52:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.53:  # so I kind # of followed her down here and I'm looking for employment or
schooling or something on those lines. 

B.54:  The, uh, Sherman is far enough away from Dallas to be, uh, away from most
of the, the blithe that associate, is associated with Dallas.

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  They, uh, I work with Texas Instruments also. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  Actually, I've been with T I for thirty-four years,

A.59:  # Wow.  #

B.60:  # in # research.  My wife originally came from Des Moines so she's from
that turf up there [throat_clearing].

A.61:  Yeah, the Midwestern corn belt. 

B.62:  Right.  Yeah, I was in the, uh, Kokomo, uh, last year, uh, late on in the
year, uh, out to the Delco plant, Delco Electronics, out that way. 

A.63:  Yeah? Were you just out on loan or something or,

B.64:  They, uh, well, we had, we do a lot of, uh, work with automotives, that's
lots of T I parts on the, on automotive, uh, things that don't have the T I bug
on them. 

A.65:  Oh. 

B.66:  We make, uh, any-, anything that's, uh, metal clad, for example, aluminum
bumpers that are metal clad and all sorts, we have, ((they were that)),
[whistling],  we make that in Massachusetts.  The, uh, {pause}, a lot of the
sensors that go there,

A.67:  # Yeah.  #

B.68:  # when, # uh, automatic chokes were common in automobiles, well, we had a
hundred percent capture of the American market.  We made all the automatic
chokes for Ford, Chrysler, Chevrolet. 

A.69:  Wow. 

B.70:  All that, so there's a lot of things like that, that Texas Instruments
makes, that even the employees don't know they make, [laughter]  for the most
part. 

A.71:  No, kidding,

B.72:  # {Very faint} Yeah.  #

A.73:  # I don't know # that. 

B.74:  # {Very faint} Yeah.  #

A.75:  # So, the more # a car becomes computerized, the more T I becomes involved?

B.76:  Yeah, we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well, but what I described
was mainly, uh, associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our
Attleboro, Massachusetts group does. 

A.77:  Huh.  So, how did you like Kokomo?

B.78:  Oh, I liked it fine. 

A.79:  How long were you there?

B.80:  Uh, only two days. 

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  We, we were out visiting, uh, Delco to show them some of the, uh,
computerized map things that we had, that sort of thing.

A.83:  Well, you said something about, uh, the blithe of Dallas, uh, do you live
in Richardson?

B.84:  Yeah, well,

A.85:  # So, #

B.86:  # we, # we haven't been contaminated yet, shall I say, with the blithe.
But there's some older areas in Dallas and Oak Cliff that are pretty, you
wouldn't want to be out at night, let's put it that way, in that area.

A.87:  Yeah, but that hasn't reached Richardson yet, huh?

B.88:  No, no, thank goodness.  {Very faint} But, uh, and it's all the way across
town, it's on, more on the south side than it is the north side anyway. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  But, I guess, all the older cities have that, have that problem.  You say
you play cards, do you play bridge?

A.91:  Oh, I had a friend that taught me how to play bridge, we, we get all these
transplanted people here in Sherman.  Not too many, I don't know any one
that's from Sherman.  Now really, uh, a guy from New Mexico has been trying to
teach us how to play bridge and we liked it.  We played a game called euchre
which is,

B.92:  I'm familiar with it. 

A.93:  You know euchre?

B.94:  Yeah, right. 

A.95:  Hey, that's cool. 

B.96:  Yeah, my, uh, I was in the, uh, service right after college, the Korean war
going on. 

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  And my wife and I played, uh, all sorts of card games that we got out of,
uh, book of Hoyle. 

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  Of which euchre was one. 

A.101:  Right. 

B.102:  That we learned and pinochle and, uh, flabbergash, ever hear that? I bet
that's one you haven't heard of [laughter]. 

A.103:  I've heard of it but I've never played, yeah,

B.104:  # {Very faint} Yeah, yeah.  #

A.105:  # I read, read Hoyle # too,

B.106:  # {Very faint} Yeah.  #

A.107:  # not the whole # book,

B.108:  # {Very faint} Yeah.  #

A.109:  # but looked through # some of the games. 

B.110:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

A.111:  Hey, euchre's a, big Indiana game,

B.112:  # Yeah.  #

A.113:  # Indiana # and Illinois and Ohio. 

B.114:  Well, in Texas of course, the Texan game is with dominos playing forty-two.

A.115:  With dominos?

B.116:  Right.  It's, it's a bidding game also but not like bridge, you only go
around one time with,

A.117:  # Huh.  #

B.118:  # dominos.  # And, uh, you probably haven't even heard of it but,

A.119:  No. 

B.120:  I'm, I'm telling you that's a Texas game [laughter]. 

A.121:  Okay. 

B.122:  That's a very, uh, very well known old timers Texas game.  Lots of people,
uh, play that. 

A.123:  So, at least I got the scouting report ((so far)).

B.124:  Yeah, in fact, that used to be called Baptist bridge because the Baptist
don't believe in playing cards so, you could,

A.125:  # [Laughter].  #

B.126:  # but # it's okay to play dominos so you, forty-two is called Baptist
bridge [laughter].

A.127:  That's funny.  Wow.  Do you play cards a lot or,

B.128:  Oh, no.  I, I like cribbage, also.  That's a good game for two. 

A.129:  Yeah. 

B.130:  And, uh,

A.131:  Play backgammon or anything like that?

B.132:  Uh, I haven't really gotten serious about it like the ((resurgence)) I
played it in, uh, teams but,

A.133:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.134:  # not # until it came back, so to speak.  I haven't played that with, uh,
the doubling bet and so forth. 

A.135:  I figured a, uh, a computer man would be into chess. 

B.136:  Well, I, uh, had no one around me when I was growing up I, uh, solved chess
problems and have several chess problem books,

A.137:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.138:  # you # know mate and ((foremoves)) and that sort of thing,

A.139:  # Yeah.  #

B.140:  # which # I enjoy but, uh, I didn't have a, uh, anyone else around me, uh,
when I was growing up that was all that interested in chess. 

A.141:  Huh. 

B.142:  I know all the moves and I can follow the game and that sort of thing and
enjoy watching, experts play,

A.143:  # Yeah.  #

B.144:  # I # participated one time with a, uh, grand master.  We used to have a
chess club at Texas Instruments and, uh, we actually had a grand master in the
area who came out and played all of us [laughter], 

A.145:  # Yeah.  #

B.146:  # simultaneously, # you know. 

A.147:  Uh-huh. 

B.148:  And he also played us, uh, blindfold chess. 

A.149:  # [Laughter].  #

B.150:  # one, # one, one on, uh, one, [throat_clearing],  and, uh, as the game was
going along, uh, he says, uh, mate in six, and if you play chess, you know, six
is a long way ahead [laughter], 

A.151:  # Yeah.  #

B.152:  # and, # uh, we all looked at the board and couldn't figure out how he
could possibly mate in six and sure enough, he mated in six just like he said
he would.

A.153:  Wow.  That's scary. 

B.154:  But he played us, uh, on a round-robin where he walks around the tables and
plays everybody. 

A.155:  How long ago was this?

B.156:  Oh, it's been several years ago like, uh, probably ten years. 

A.157:  Remember his name?

B.158:  No, it's too long ago,

A.159:  # [Laughter].  #

B.160:  # uh, # I really don't, but he was, he was something else.  We had one
member who's really, uh, in the professional class if you will, he used to go
to the matches all the time.

A.161:  Uh-huh. 

B.162:  And his, let's see I've forgotten, let's see the grand master, and then
right out of that's master, what's the one that's just under master?

A.163:  Expert. 

B.164:  Expert, yeah, he was expert. 

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  So, uh, he gave him a run for his money when he, he had to be playing all
of us but if he passed you, uh, twice, uh, you were out.  In other words, if
you hadn't moved when he went around, so the more members he beat, well the
faster he got around.

A.167:  Yeah. 

B.168:  And, uh, so, Tony, the,
