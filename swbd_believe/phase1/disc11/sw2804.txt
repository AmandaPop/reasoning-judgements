A.1:  #All right.# 

B.2:  #Okay.# 

A.3:  What, uh, what baseball teams do you follow? 

@B.4:  I follow, I've been a long time Cincinnati Reds fan because when I was
growing up and I was five years old I wanted to be a catcher so I was a big
Johnny Bench fan so I've been through the Re-, with the Reds since, you know,
nineteen seventy --

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  -- and I remember the Seventy World Series, like I said I was only five
years old then but I had to give a report to my dad every, because that was
when they played World Series games in the afternoons sometimes --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- and I've kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years
because I didn't really know many players and their team but I also, being
from the Indiana area, I like the Cubs and the White Sox,

A.9:  Um. 

B.10:  so I kind of follow those two teams --

A.11:  Yeah. 

B.12:  -- a little bit and, you know, since moving down here, the Rangers, you
know, I've been picking up on them a little bit and, uh, it looks like they
could do all right this year and, uh, of course they're in there with the ri-,
White Sox I believe and they're in their division so,

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  The White Sox headed for probably another good year I hope.  What about
yourself?

A.15:  Oh, I guess mainly the, the Rangers, such as they are [laughter]. 

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  They do seem to have a pretty tough division though with Oakland and Kansas
City and White Sox all, uh,

B.18:  # Yeah.  #

A.19:  # jammed # in there. 

B.20:  Yeah.  Do you go to a lot of games?

A.21:  Oh, I get to, I don't know, quite a few in the summer. 

B.22:  Uh-huh.  That's, I've been looking forward to it. 

A.23:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.24:  I've only been to one game and I just moved down here at the end of last
summer so that, last season was winding down so I'm, hopefully I'll, uh, get to
a couple this year.  I want to see Nolan pitch one time,

A.25:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.26:  # that, # that's be, that'd be really neat. 

A.27:  Yeah.  It looked like they're starting off kind of shaky but they, they've
gone, I guess, over five hundred now. 

B.28:  Yeah?

A.29:  I was hoping that no hitter that he threw would, would get them fired up a
little bit #but it's hard#  --

B.30:  #It might.# 

A.31:  -- hard to tell. 

B.32:  Did they, uh, play today?

A.33:  Uh, I was trying to think.  They were up in a stand at Detroit. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  I don't know if they're playing today or not. 

B.36:  Yeah that's right, that's right.  Yeah I watched a little bit of the, I was
flipping back and forth between the, the Pacers and the Celtics and, uh, the
White Sox game --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- that was on today and I, I just like, I like the White Sox, I've
never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core
White Sox so he took me to a game and you know, I think they're, you know,
they're really neat because they're such a young team,

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  actually the youngest team in baseball, and they got some, you know, the
last three or four years their number one picks, you know, they're all suited
up and playing for them.

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  And the draft, and, uh, you got to like that, you know, building the team
through draft picks and stuff like that. 

A.43:  Says a lot for their future. 

B.44:  Yeah, it does.  Hopefully some of their players will come through and they
got Tim Raines, a veteran and they got Carlton Fisk, he's, you know, still
pretty solid, a lot of experience but, uh, uh, you like the Astros or anything
like that?

A.45:  Oh, I don't really follow them a whole lot.  Um, I, I hear about them
occasionally.  I've got a friend whose a, a trainer,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # for # one of their farm clubs, I think, so we hear off and on about them.
They've never really done a whole lot.  I mean they're up and down kind of
like the Rangers are [laughter] most of the time.

B.48:  Yeah.  Well when was the last time the Rangers really did well?

A.49:  [Throat_clearing]  Um, {pause} it's been probably three or four years since
they were, I think they finished second in their division.  I don't remember
what they ended up last year, third or fourth, I guess. 

B.50:  Yeah.  So they were contenders till about three or fours years ago?

A.51:  [Sigh] Yeah.  They have been off and on, uh, maybe, [laughter] maybe three
or four times since they've been here.

B.52:  Yeah.  I don't, I never really followed them, all I knew, uh,

A.53:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.54:  kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies, there again, you know,
cause I was a little catcher in baseball I liked to watch a Jim Sundberg and,
uh, like Jeff Burroughs,

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  uh, forget who else used to play for them, but, uh, yeah those guys
were, were really tough. 

A.57:  Well they've been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in
the past, they just got, got rid of their manager, this is, Valentine's the
first manager they've had in, on, you know, any kind of length of time --

B.58:  Yeah. 

A.59:  -- and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together. 

B.60:  You think he's pretty good?

A.61:  I, I can't, [laughter]  I don't know.  Uh, sometimes I think he is and
sometimes I wonder. 

B.62:  Yeah.  I was watching the game yesterday and they had, had bases loaded,

A.63:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.64:  and they tried a, uh, a squeeze play and, uh, I just couldn't understand
that.  I forget whose, who was batting and but, uh, I don't know I just,

A.65:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.66:  I couldn't understand that move, there was only one out,

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  and it's like, you know, give the guy a cut, you know, you got bases
loaded, you know, one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to
bunting that much,

A.69:  Yeah, true. 

B.70:  and it's a easy double play but,

A.71:  I guess I was feeling pretty confident about the team, Valentine, this year
until, uh, he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for, because he was
upset at him. 

B.72:  You didn't like that move?

A.73:  Well, I, I can understand his point.  I thought it was kind of childish to
just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up
and he started out real good for them and he, he's gotten kind of shaky now,

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  and I think they should have at least gotten something for him. 

B.76:  Yeah.  It's true.  What about, uh, Sierra? You a big Ruben Sierra fan?

A.77:  Yeah. 

B.78:  He's been around, what, four or five years?

A.79:  I think so, yeah. 

B.80:  You think you can see him staying there for awhile or,

A.81:  Yeah, I think, I think as long as he produces, he and Franco, they, they
run kind of hot and cold too.

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  I think Franco hit a home run, was it last night to win the game?

B.84:  Oh! Yeah.  I'd, I turned the game on, I don't know who won. 

A.85:  I think they won six to five and I think that was on his, he hit a home run
at the end and broke the tie up. 

B.86:  Well good.  Yeah, I'm kind of into baseball cards so, uh,

A.87:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.88:  last year I was buying a lot of Juan Gonzalez cards --

A.89:  Um. 

B.90:  -- so I'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday. 

A.91:  Yeah, [laughter]  that'd be nice. 

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  Yeah, I think the Rangers have th-, the pitching staff they need if they
would just produce some offense, they might do all right. 

B.94:  Yeah.  Well I'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this
summer.  That's good entertainment at a budget price. 

A.95:  Yeah, you said you were a Cincinnati fan, has, uh, all this brouhaha over
Pete Rose over the years --

B.96:  Yeah?

A.97:  -- caused, caused you any distaste for them or,

B.98:  No.  You mean like, no, I mean, the thing about Rose, I mean you know that
he's got a problem in his personal life, I just, you know, he, he messed up
but,

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  I still think he's, belongs in the Hall of Fame and,

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  and, you know, he played for so many, so well for so many years that,

A.103:  Sure. 

B.104:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's just too bad, it's, you know, like the players that do
drugs or do, you know, are alcoholics, they just have a problem,

A.105:  Uh-huh. 

B.106:  and it's too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything
else. 

A.107:  (( )) Didn't, didn't seem to really hurt the team, in fact seemed to kind
of fire them up and make them work harder --

B.108:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.109:  -- after he was gone. 

B.110:  Yeah, I think Lou Pinella is doing a good job too,

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  obviously.

A.113:  Yeah. 

B.114:  He knows, you know, he's, you know he's been there, he's played a lot of
ball himself so, he's been in some World Series and, you know, he's, a lot of
experience as a player and it looks like he's doing all right as a manager. 

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

@@B.116: So {pause} well, thanks for, this is the first time I've ever
been called --

A.117:  #Really.# 

B.118:  -- #so it's# kind of interesting.  Yeah, I usually get home and pick up the
phone and do some calling so, uh, but I appreciate your calling.

A.119:  Sure, I enjoyed talking to you Fred. 

B.120:  All right, take care. 

A.121:  You too. 

B.122:  Bye. 

A.123:  Good-bye.
