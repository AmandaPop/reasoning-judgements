==========================================================================

A.1:  I pay a good deal of taxes I guess, because I, I make a fair amount of
money, and, uh, the taxes that I pay, um, I guess as a, as a general statement,
I feel I, I guess I get my money's worth for. 

B.2:  Okay. 

A.3:  I'm not sure, though, whether I feel, I guess I am sure that I feel that,
in general, though, uh, the allocation, uh, of the taxes in certain areas, i-,
isn't correct.

B.4:  Well, I'm sure that, uh, probably every person in this country would agree
with you on that. 

A.5:  # [Laughter].  #

B.6:  # Because # everybody has a different idea of where the money should go. 

A.7:  Well, I, I, lately, I guess, um, uh, or, at least for the last twenty years
or so, I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, uh, defense
items, at least in the last ten years, have been, uh, there's been and
extraordinary amount of money spent there, and I'm not really sure that, that
we've gotten our money's worth there, uh, regardless of the outcome of the
Desert Storm, uh,

B.8:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.9:  # Desert # Shield, uh, situations. 

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  Uh, I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi-,
military off and on over the, over the years of being called back and things of
that nature, is, uh, I've found that, you know, there's an extraordinary amount
of waste.  I take that as a, as a given in any military operation and --

B.12:  Oh yeah, no argument here. 

A.13:  -- yeah, and I gue-, I, I should imagine that, that, that what the, what
the problem, why I, I'm, I'm a little concerned about today is that this, uh,
rather, uh, quick and, and easy, I don't know, I shouldn't say easy, rather
quick victory in the, in, in the, uh, Mideast, uh, uh, over the, uh, Iraqis,
uh, might lead us into, uh, a false sense of security that we can do that
against any other foe.  I'm, I, I don't know what other foe that would be,
but, uh, I, I'm just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up
that there has to be increased expenditures in that area.

B.14:  Yeah, well, of course, uh, a lot of, uh, a lot of w-, missiles and things
were expended in the course of fighting the war, and the, and the inventory's
going to have to be restocked, uh, on, now I work for T I, and one of the
things we were told is, like, they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I
is the sole supplier for, and they used up two thousand of them in, in the
war, so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that, to get
ready in case something else is needed.

A.15:  Yeah, but, it, it, it, would that be, uh, well, let's see, two thousand out
of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent.  Uh, I, I
should imagine that, that would be to keep it at a level, those levels, I
guess, that, that were originally appropriated w-, was when the Soviet threat,
I guess, was perceived as being a greater one.  I don't think there's very
much of a threat there today.  I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left
in the territories, uh, in their territory over there, and who's controlling
them, but [laughter],

B.16:  Tha-, that's true, that's true. 

A.17:  I, I don't know what amount of, what amount of, our hardware would stop
some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, uh, that would be irrational.

B.18:  Well, of course now, we used up twenty per cents, per cent of that
inventory,

A.19:  # Right.  #

B.20:  # in # a matter of just a few weeks,

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  and, uh, uh, uh, T I also makes the missile, which was the, the T V laser
guided bombs --

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  -- and, and, a big percentage of that was expended, as well, that n-, that
w-, that was just a matter of,

A.25:  Oh, what is the name of that?

B.26:  Uh, it's called Paveway. 

A.27:  Yes, yes. 

B.28:  And, uh, a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.
So tho-, those are two areas in which T I stands to, to gain some, some short
term business to restock that.

A.29:  Yeah, well, uh, I'm, what I'm, uh, I guess uh, it, concerned about, talking
about the taxes in general, and that, that was an area that I, I perceive as
not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for,
uh, in the area of defense, or perhaps we have paid too much there, I don't
know, it just seems to me that over the years, now, the, and, and it's, it's a
cliche, I, I, but I see it myself, I see where the infrastructure is sort of
breaking down, the roads, the highways.

B.30:  Oh, no doubt. 

A.31:  I, I, I don't know, uh, I kn-, I'm familiar with some, some upbeat school
areas, so I don't totally agree with the, the great, uh, uh, with the, with the
great ex-, expenditure of effort and time there, but I guess overall, because I
guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, and, and, uh, and, uh, rural
school systems are like, I, I should imagine that would take an enormous
expenditure. 

B.32:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, in Texas, um, we've had our school funding
system declared unconstitutional by the, a state judge, and they, and, uh, the
legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill, which, basically,
what it does, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts,
that are, that are, you know come from local taxes --

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  -- and send them to other parts of the state, that are not so affluent. 

A.35:  They, they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational
system,

B.36:  # Uh, well, #

A.37:  # or is # it all funded out of local taxes?

B.38:  okay, to g-, to give you some perspective, this, this town that I had lived
in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by
state funds.

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey,
we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this, but, they forgot to
put in the state budget the money to pay for it, and they dumped it all on the
local school districts.  So,

A.41:  Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now. 

B.42:  Really. 

A.43:  # Yeah.  #

B.44:  # So, # so what ended up happening was, was a, was a shift.  We went to
sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a
matter of four years.  And, uh, I mean,

A.45:  Uh, do you mean a, a complete reversal?

B.46:  Oh, complete, complete.  It's all shifted to local districts, and now, even
the money that's been raised for the local districts is being, is going to be
siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state. 

A.47:  Because, I guess, they can't raise that money in those, those poorer
districts, huh?

B.48:  That's right, and, and I have, I have no problem, with, uh, a certain, uh,
floor level, minimum level, that's a standard --

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  -- uh, that everybody, uh, ought to be able to have, uh, but, I am opposed
to, w-, any attempts to restrict, um, local communities from taxing themselves
above that to provide above the minimum. 

A.51:  Yes, I see what you're saying.  Uh, I, uh, I, I do, I, I guess I am a s-,
uh, a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education. 
I mean, by that I mean, I'm a product myself, I have, uh, a, a, a, a background
of, uh, being, uh, getting my college education through the G I Bill. 

B.52:  So did I.  My Masters, anyway. 

A.53:  What, but, uh, when I look at it to me, uh, it doesn't really make any
difference.  It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done, I don't
think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial --

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  -- uh, easement made possible. 

B.56:  That's right. 

A.57:  And I, I don't really care what it takes to qualify, whether you're, uh,
an, an ex-, whether you're a veteran or whether you, I don't even know if you
have to perform community service, or unless, uh, or, or you promise to even
do something in the future, I think that, uh, the, that, that, the subsidy
itself, or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation,

B.58:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.59:  # would # give many people who, I, I think, I think I perceive the fact, at
least what I read, is that some younger people feel that education is priced
out of their, uh, out of their, uh, budget.  I know in the state of Florida
just today, uh, the, the legislature, uh, adjourned, and, uh, they had
completed a fifteen per cent increase in the, in the, uh, state land grant
colleges, which, which isn't, I mean, to me it doesn't sound like a mo-, lot
of money, but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year.

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # They # went from eleven to fifteen hundred,

B.62:  # Yeah.  #

A.63:  # and, # uh, for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five
per cent.  I don't know what that would be.

B.64:  Yeah, they had to, they had to raise, uh, community college taxes here, a
few years ago. 

A.65:  But that, uh, I guess that goes along with the general idea that the
federal government had to, uh, was expending so much money on defense, uh,
that, that the program now is a, uh, program now is, uh, fees that, that fund
these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states and,

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  the states now establish, uh, don't have enough money so they, they must
charge fees.  Uh, I, I'm not too sure of that reasoning. 

B.68:  Yeah. 

A.69:  But I guess to get back to the main topic, I don't know whether I pay too
much taxes.  I, I, I travel extensively in Europe and see enormous, uh, people
p-, pay, uh, a great deal in taxes, they tell me when I sit and talk to people
there they tell me they, they, some states they pay, uh, in Germany or in, in
England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay
up to six-, fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes. 

B.70:  Oh, oh, I can believe that. 

A.71:  But, but, I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in, my car tax, my
income tax, and these myriad of, uh, now it costs me money to leave the
country, some sort of a tax to leave the country,

B.72:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.73:  some sort of an airport departure tax, uh, uh, a tax, a sales tax which is
getting to, uh, quite high levels, I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to
that. 

B.74:  Well, I guarantee you, you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i-, if, uh, the
Democrats had more say. 

A.75:  You really think so?

B.76:  Yeah, I really do. 

A.77:  But I mean, w-, what's, what's happened here is, is, is I feel that, that
in the last ten years, uh, my taxes have gone up, they haven't gone down.  I
pay ex-, uh,

B.78:  # Yeah.  #

A.79:  # quite # a bit more taxes and, and, and,

B.80:  # Everybody, everybody is.  #

A.81:  # but that's been # a Republican government for the last ten years. 

B.82:  Well, what, what, what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of
increase [breathing]  [laughter]. 

A.83:  Well I,

B.84:  To keep it, to keep it b-, from becoming even more obnoxious. 

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  Well, this has been really interesting, and I've enjoyed our talk. 

@@A.87:  Okay, uh, I guess I just push something here.  Push one again, right?

B.88:  No, you just, uh, we just say, say good-bye and that's it. 

A.89:  Just hang up.  Okay, Don, good talking with you. 

B.90:  Nice talking with you, too. 

A.91:  Bye-bye. 

B.92:  Bye-bye.
