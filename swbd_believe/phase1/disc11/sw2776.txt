=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Great. Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of
program.

B.3:  Huh-uh.  

A.4:  I'm mainly do a lot of walking.  I have a son that's a little bit
overweight and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.
So my wife and I kind of take turns.  At one time I had a fairly regular
exercise program.  But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new
residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.  All
this space that normally would be dedicated [laughter] towards the,

B.5:  Yeah.  

A.6:  exercise area, is covered in boxes.  

B.7:  Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?   

A.8:  Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups. 

B.9:  Huh-uh.  

A.10:  And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting.  Nothing, I'm not
trying to make big bulging muscles,

B.11:  Huh-uh.  

A.12:  just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age [laughter].

B.13:  Yeah [laughter].  Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out, it's been
raining a lot this spring, but I try to, uh, I have a bicycle and I like to
cycle a lot.  And, uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's
pretty popular in Texas, I don't know,

A.14:  Huh-uh.  

B.15:  if it's up north, but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and
thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for
thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.

A.16:  Huh-uh.  

B.17:  Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.
And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center so a lot of time after
work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the
tread mill, and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine,
that are fun to ride and workout on.  So I try to, I'm trying to stay in shape
on a regular basis.  I used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my
schedule, so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now, but it's a
big commitment.  We don't have any kids yet so, that's a lot of, part of it.

A.18:  Yeah.  That's a plus.  Oh, I have a total of five children.  I have three
left living at home.

B.19:  Huh-uh.  

A.20:  And they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend.

B.21:  Yeah.  

A.22:  And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do
for yourself, too.

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:  It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.  (( Yes,))
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your
children.

B.25:  Huh-uh [laughter].  

A.26:  [Laughter].

B.27:  That's why, they, uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in
shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that.
But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you
know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids
behind them on the bikes and I don't know if that would work for me because I
don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.  But it's really
hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and
stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.  I think maybe
walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and
much money or whatever.

A.28:  Yeah.   

B.29:  Yeah.  

A.30:  You have to, what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for
yourself.

B.31:  Huh-uh.  

A.32:  And you can use what ever rationale you want, but basically, the healthier
you stay, the longer you'll live.

B.33:  Right.  

A.34:  And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit
of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well,
then I'll around a lot longer,

B.35:  [Laughter] 

A.36:  And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away
from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would
have been if I wouldn't have taken it.

B.37:  Huh-uh.  

A.38:  If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.

B.39:  Yeah.  Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, um, I've been reading a
book by Kenneth Cooper, I don't know if you're familiar with him --

A.40:  Huh-uh.  

B.41:  -- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.  He's, he's,
kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.  Um, he
was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are
inactivity, and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity.  If you
can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know,
cause those are risk factors, so anyway,

A.42:  Yeah.  

B.43:  it's kind of a tip.   

A.44:  Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years and I found that probably one
of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.

B.45:  Really [laughter].  

A.46:  Yeah.  Um, the research that I've done and I've actually been in the
drinking watering business since eighty-three.

B.47:  Huh-uh.  

A.48:  And, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there
were very few heart attacks.

B.49:  Huh-uh.  

A.50:  There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.  Well, in nineteen-three they
started experimenting with chlorinating the water.  In nineteen-thirteen most
of the major cities, and after that we,

B.51:  (( )). 

A.52:  we started having the hearts attacks and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book
CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.  You can usually find it in a health food
store.

B.53:  Huh-uh.  

A.54:  I know they had it in health food stores in Plano, I used live in Plano.

B.55:  Dr. Price? 

A.56:  Uh, Dr. Price, yeah.  And it's amazing, he makes the, you know, it's a very
small book and the guys very opinionated, um, but he makes a very good case
against chlorine.  There were no heart attacks before we started using it and
he points out that people in, uh, England and, uh, or even diets that
quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,

B.57:  Huh-uh.  

A.58:  and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.  

B.59:  That's really interesting.  

A.60:  Yeah.  He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar
to ours.

B.61:  Huh-uh.  

A.62:  And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which
is the,

B.63:  Yeah.  

A.64:  clogging of the arteries.  And, uh, you know, he's, there's been a lot of
reports since then.  This whole thing about, first it was stress, then it went
to cholesterol, and now they're saying what's cholesterol, well there's good
cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.

B.65:  Huh-uh.  

A.66:  You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book and, in fact, he,
everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who
did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in
nineteen eighty-seven.  And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work
he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing
experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine
causes arteriosclerosis.  And, E P A never published that report.

B.67:  And what's the name of this book again?  

A.68:  CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.  

B.69:  I'll have to remember that.  

A.70:  Yeah.  

B.71:  That will be very interesting.  My husband wants to go into medical school
and be a neurosurgeon so, he's really interested in the heart.

A.72:  Yeah.  

B.73:  And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too, he's, uh, he's done a lot of
research on like how your heart reacts to exercise.  [laughter].  Sorry, he
made me laugh.  Um, so anyway,

A.74:  Yeah.  There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about
health.  And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around,
people are starting to realize aren't true.

B.75:  Yeah.  

A.76:  I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because
that's, that's good for you,

B.77:  Huh-uh.  

A.78:  uh, but to believe some of the things, you know, and I don't think
anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet, but to think
that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is
just hard to believe.

B.79:  If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.

A.80:  Huh-uh.  

B.81:  That's a real good, um, he talks about that.  Talks about high risk factors
and heart disease and all that.

A.82:  Yeah.  I actually eat pretty much anything that I want. 

B.83:  Huh-uh.  

A.84:  And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times and I've never
been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,

B.85:  Huh-uh.  

A.86:  never.  And, uh, uh, I mean, I,

B.87:  You have a good ratio of good to bad.

A.88:  Um, 

B.89:  Cholesterol.  

A.90:  Well, what they tell me, but, I mean, you know, everything is like within
five to ten percent and all that kind of thing.  [laughter].  You know, they
leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.

B.91:  Yeah.  

A.92:  But, uh, we've, I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

B.93:  Oh, really.  

A.94:  Yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and, um, you know,
I've always come out aces.

B.95:  That's good.  

A.96:  You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat, but I do eat, you
know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,

B.97:  Yeah.  

A.98:  low in fat and all that kind of stuff.  But, I mean as far as really
being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm
not worried about it.  {Tape fades}.
