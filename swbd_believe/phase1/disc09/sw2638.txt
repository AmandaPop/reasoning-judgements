etc, while B was talking.

=============================================================================

@A.1:  Well, I personally don't have any problem with, uh, drug testing employees
or potential employees, do you?

B.2:  # Um, #

A.3:  # I # mean, basically?

B.4:  Basically, no.  Um,

A.5:  Okay.  I don't, I really can't disagree with it. 

B.6:  Yeah, I, I, uh, uh, the policy that T I has, I think is, uh, uh, very fair.

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  Um, I, they first had a policy where they, uh, would test new employees
and, then since I've been with them the last four years, uh, there's been in
the last year, year and a half, um, they're doing random testing of all
employees.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  I think that's really the only fair way to do it. 

B.10:  Yes. 

A.11:  I really think it ought to be s-, you know, Junkins all the way down. 

B.12:  And it is, it, and fr-, from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the
way down.

A.13:  Right, as a matter of fact, I want to think they took the top managers
first, isn't that a fact? I've been retired from T I about a year,

B.14:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.15:  # but # the program, you know, was still fairly new.  I guess it had been
going on, maybe almost a year,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # before # I retired, so I was not, uh, ever called upon to do a drug test.
I certainly wouldn't object to it, and I think random is probably, you know,
the only really fair way to do it.

B.18:  Yeah.  Um, I like it because, um, you know, I, I, I grew up in the sixties,
I mean,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # I # graduated high school in sixty-eight and,

A.21:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.22:  # and, # uh, you know, I, I saw, you know, I know my friends who were you
know, druggies and,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # friends # who weren't and,

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  and, uh, you know, it's, I think it's a real problem,

A.27:  # Oh, I, absolutely.  #

B.28:  # and I think # it, and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and,

A.29:  # Yeah.  #

B.30:  # and # a lot of problems. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  And so I'm hoping that, uh, a lot of other companies will, will follow the
same path. 

A.33:  I don't think they'll have much choice, do you?

B.34:  Um, probably not. 

A.35:  Especially if they have anything do with, you know, government contracts,
or anything.  As matter of fact, I want to believe that the, uh, defense
department more or less mandated that people, you know, who work on defense
contracts, you know,

B.36:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # s-, # do some sort of, you know, drug testing.  I think that's really
what maybe prompted T I to do it.  I was in the, uh, Defense Electronic
Division when I retired.  I know it was, a, you know, it was a real hot, hot
item there.  I think, I want to think maybe they, you know, really got some
nudging from, you know, D O D to do this sort of thing.

B.38:  Yeah, I used to be in D S E G myself. 

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  Um, A P D as a matter of fact. 

A.41:  Yeah.  So you kne-, you know the atmosphere, then. 

B.42:  Yep. 

A.43:  # So, yeah.  #

B.44:  # Very aware # of it.  But I, I'd, I'd, I really like the idea. 

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # Uh, # in fact, I would like to see, uh, a lot more, uh, people, uh, adopt
it,

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # uh, # like, you know, school systems, and that kind of thing. 

A.49:  # Right, I agree.  I, #

B.50:  # I mean, I'd like, # I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a
teacher who's not on drugs or,

A.51:  # That's right.  #

B.52:  # or, uh, # who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid
drugs. 

A.53:  That's r-, absolutely.  Yeah, I d-, I just can't disagree ((with you)),
with ((you know)) the basic premise.

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  It's to m-, as far as I know, it's, you know, seems to be a fairly accurate
program, as far as, uh, you know, the testing goes.  And, uh,

B.56:  And, I like the idea that they have a, uh, system where they allow you to,
uh, be retested if for,

A.57:  # That's right.  #

B.58:  # some reason # there may have been a problem. 

A.59:  # That's right.  #

B.60:  # or something # did show up. 

A.61:  And offer you, you know, help if you need help. 

B.62:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.63:  Yeah.  I do too. 

B.64:  Yeah, rather than just, uh --

A.65:  Put you out on the street.  Yeah. 

B.66:  -- put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself. 

A.67:  That's right. 

B.68:  That's not going to help anybody get over the problem. 

A.69:  # No, ab-, #

B.70:  # I believe # it is a, a, a medical problem. 

A.71:  That's right. 

B.72:  Um, of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the
world, too [laughter].

A.73:  Oh, absolutely.  Not to mention alcohol. 

B.74:  Yeah, so I mean, there's a lot of things out there and,

A.75:  # Yep, yep.  #

B.76:  # things that, # uh, I'm just glad that they, uh, decided not to, uh, tax
drugs, otherwise they'd be legal,

A.77:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.78:  # and # they'd be getting tax money off it the same way,

A.79:  # That's right [laughter].  #

B.80:  # they are the # alcohol and tobacco [laughter]. 

A.81:  That's right [laughter],  oh, gosh.  Well, it's, it's a real problem, I'm
sure.  I'm sure. 

B.82:  Yeah.  I have friends that work in other companies that are just now
adopting the policy,

A.83:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.84:  # and, # and stuff, and I, uh, uh, I moved to a T I facility that, um, had
never had, uh, random drug sampling before,

A.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.86:  # because # they were outside of the military sector. 

A.87:  # Right.  Uh-huh.  #

B.88:  # It was, # uh, an industrial company, and, you know, that T I purchased,
and so the people here, a lot of them are real opposed to it. 

A.89:  # Oh, yeah, uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # Uh, they were # really opposed to it,

A.91:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.92:  # and, # you know, there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs,

A.93:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.94:  # and # that's why they were opposed to it. 

A.95:  ((That's)) right. 

B.96:  And, uh, it resulted in, in a few people leaving,

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  you know, because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the
policy. 

A.99:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.100:  # You # know, they had a life-style and they weren't going to change it. 

A.101:  Yeah, right. 

B.102:  And it's,

A.103:  Yeah, I know a lot of people who, when it first be-, or at least began, was
in the talking sta-, you know, everybody knew it was coming, it just a matter
of time, everybody was screaming, you know, invasion of privacy and all this
stuff.  But a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile,
and you know, weighed the pros and cons, decided, you know, it's really not a
bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.

B.104:  Yeah.  I mean, uh, you should have no objection to it, it's like, uh, going
down to get your license and checking your eyes. 

A.105:  # That's right.  #

B.106:  # I mean, # you know, why do I need my eyes checked, well,

A.107:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.108:  # we # want to make sure you can see [laughter]. 

A.109:  # That's right, yep, yep.  #

B.110:  # You know it's like, # [laughter]  why are we doing this? Well, so you
don't kill people on the road. 

A.111:  # That's right.  Or yourself or, #

B.112:  # Uh, it's a ba-, I # mean, it's the basic premise with,

A.113:  # Yeah.  #

B.114:  # you # know, drug testing. 

A.115:  That's right. 

B.116:  Especially some of the jobs, um, luckily I've always been in the
engineering sector,

A.117:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.118:  # and # it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as
far as, uh, you know, hurting someone, I mean,

A.119:  Uh-huh. 

B.120:  it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from
it,

A.121:  Yeah.  That's true. 

B.122:  But, uh, in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor,

A.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.124:  # and # down in some of those labs and stuff,

A.125:  Yeah, assembly people. 

B.126:  yeah, I, darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by
side, you know, that could kill me,

A.127:  That's right. 

B.128:  by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there
because they were on drugs. 

A.129:  That's r-, absolutely. 

B.130:  So, there's a, there's a lot of sectors where I think that would, would
help out, and I think in the long run, we all benefit.

A.131:  Uh-huh, oh, absolutely, yeah. 

B.132:  I mean, if you have, uh, you know, if you're not working with someone on
drugs, well then you're going to have less accidents,

A.133:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.134:  # and # you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical. 

A.135:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.136:  # And # you spend less money on medical, then the company's more
profitable.

A.137:  # Yeah.  #

B.138:  # The # company's more profitable,

A.139:  # Sure ((right)). #

B.140:  # then maybe # they can pay you more.  If they can pay you more, you can
buy more,

A.141:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.142:  # and # then, and it, and it goes around,

A.143:  # Sure.  #

B.144:  # you # know, to everywhere. 

A.145:  Trickles, trickles up and down. 

B.146:  Yep, all over. 

A.147:  Sure does. 

B.148:  # And, uh, #

A.149:  # Yeah, affects # a lot of people. 

B.150:  It certainly does and,

A.151:  # Yeah.  #

B.152:  # I, # I just hope that, uh, more and more companies, uh, get on the ball,

A.153:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.154:  # and, and, # and start it up. 

A.155:  I think they probably will.  You know, if, if they, I'm sure it's a very
expensive program to administer.  I'm not sure every small company could do
it.

B.156:  Well, a lot of companies are, are, coming down in price,

A.157:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.158:  # and # I think that the insurance companies are starting to give, uh,
benefits. 

A.159:  Uh-huh. 

B.160:  You know, re-, reduction in, in medical costs if, you know, they,

A.161:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, it's got to help them too. 

B.162:  Yeah, so, I think everybody will, will benefit from the program. 

A.163:  # Uh-huh, yeah, I do too, that's right.  #

B.164:  # And I think if, if a lot # more insurance companies get on the bandwagon
and say,

A.165:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.166:  # well # if you impose, uh,

A.167:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.168:  # mandatory # drug testing, we'll reduce your insurance costs by,

A.169:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.170:  # you # know, twenty per cent.  And of course, you know, the company's not
going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent, they're going
to reduce their own. 

A.171:  No, no.  But it'll save in some areas, yeah, right. 

B.172:  Yeah, and that'll cover it.  And maybe some insurance companies might
start offering it as a, uh, as part of the package. 

A.173:  That's right.  That certainly could happen.  That's a very ver-, very, very
competitive business. 

B.174:  Yeah.  So it, I, I think, I think all around it, it's going to help out a
lot. 

A.175:  Yeah. #I do too.# 

B.176:  # Course, #

A.177:  I just really can't disagree with you. 

B.178:  Yeah. 

A.179:  Okay, well, it's nice to talk to you. 

B.180:  It was great talking with you. 

A.181:  And you take care. 

B.182:  You do the same. 

A.183:  Okay.  Bye-bye. 

B.184:  Bye-bye.
