=============================================================================

@A.1:  Well, uh, what [laughter] what do you think about the metric system? Uh,
do you, uh, find it useable? Have you tried much with it?

B.2:  Well, wi-, with an engineering,

A.3:  #Yeah.#

B.4:  #degree,# it's, of course, it's a whole lot easier. 

A.5:  #Uh-huh.#

B.6:  #because,# uh,

A.7:  #To use you mean, uh-huh.#

B.8:  #yeah, if, if somebody ha-,# is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human
nature being what it is we don't like to change. 

A.9:  Yes. 

B.10:  Uh, it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all
decimal. 

A.11:  Yes. 

B.12:  And it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another. 

A.13:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  We, well I've lived both in the United States and, and in
a country where they do use the metric system and, uh, so I've, I've lived
with (( )) pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.
Um, the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to
centimeters and,

B.14:  #Right.#

A.15:  #pounds# to kilom-, uh, uh, kilograms,

B.16:  #That's right.#

A.17:  #and, I# think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a
minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters,

B.18:  #Right.#

A.19:  #how# on earth am I every going to do the math?

B.20:  Right. 

A.21:  And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to
centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters
rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or
whatever, and, you know, [laughter] and leaving it at that and, uh, you know,
a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch, cause I
still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but I'm
perfectly comfortable using either.

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  And I think the real problem with this, this weird conversion, yo-, you see
signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, you know, whatever it would be
one hundred six kilometers per hour, you know, people, you know, it's hard to
take it seriously.

B.24:  Oh, yeah. 

A.25:  And as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the
kilometers per hour, you just say, well look read the miles per hour one, the
other one must be for someone else. 

B.26:  That's right. 

A.27:  Uh, I don't know, I mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited
this mess from them and, uh,

B.28:  #That's right, it's all their fault.#

A.29:  #[Laughter]  Well, I mean, it's more# our fault than theirs at this point
because they, they saw the light, um, I don't know why they we-, um, were more
able than we were except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just
going to start using the things now and you sort of have to force people to
change since they don't want to [laughter]. 

B.30:  Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it
they, they were probably much more, is much more necessary for them than for
us. 

A.31:  That's true, that's, that's probably true and America does have a long
history of sort of doing things our own way [laughter]  rather than adopting,
you know, some other model. 

B.32:  There's an expression for that, With eyes on the past, backing confidently
into the future. 

A.33:  [Laughter] I've never heard that one, that's very nice [laughter].  Oh, so
I'm all for the metric system and converting over and I think, I guess, my
feeling is the way to do it is, is to just start giving weights, you know,
have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and
kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything
like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people
constantly trying to convert.  Remember me getting a package of something that
said one pound, this is a package of dates mind you, it's, was, presumably
something you weigh fairly precisely, it said one pound [throat_clearing] and
then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams
[laughter].

B.34:  Right, right. 

A.35:  And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric
propaganda cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of
something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they
couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um, every time I see something like
that I think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument. 

B.36:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I, I don't think it'll, it could ever happen with, with a
quick transition. 

A.37:  You don't?

B.38:  No.  I, I think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such
as it is,

A.39:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.40:  #I would# think it would take, probably, two or three years before people
co-, could completely cut the cord.

A.41:  Yeah, oh, oh, that's what I was thinking by quick transition, I didn't
mean, you know, I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or
anything, you know, [laughter] at midnight, tonight we all switch over or
anything.

B.42:  Did they switch?

A.43:  Uh, I believe so, yeah, and I think they did it overnight cause you know,
you can't do it gradually.  [laughter] That's an example of something you
can't do gradually.

B.44:  Well that's true.  It, it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
[laughter]. 

A.45:  Yes, it does [laughter].  A quantum leap from left to right hand drive
[laughter]. 

B.46:  Interesting. 

A.47:  And they, but, you know, that must have taken, uh, that was something that
had to be done quickly,

B.48:  #Oh, yes.#

A.49:  #you know,# because of external circumstances, but they decided to do it to
make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe,

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  #or# the rest of continental Europe and, you know. 

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate. 

B.54:  I'm sure. 

A.55:  Um, so I, I, I, I, I think it's essential that it's done and I think the
real trick is to avoid the [sigh]  you know, a little more attention to human
psychology and, whereas, people want round numbers and after all, the whole
reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers,

B.56:  #Exactly, exactly.#

A.57:  #so they# don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact,
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly
represented.  Really, I think. 

B.58:  Well, we do have the two liter soda pop bottles. 

A.59:  Uh-huh, I saw that, I saw that the other day.  I don-, don't drink soda
pop,

B.60:  #Yeah.#

A.61:  #but# I saw a two liter soda pop bottle so, yeah, things like that are a
good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then
the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers,

B.62:  #Right.  Yes.#

A.63:  #you know,# two point two pounds or something.  I think people will start
getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one. 

B.64:  That's true.  Well, sure have enjoyed our talk. 

A.65:  Yes, well get back to what you're doing and I'll do the same.  I enjoyed
talking with you too. 

B.66:  Okay, God bless y-, Bye-bye. 

A.67:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
