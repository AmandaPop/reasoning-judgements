========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, I was just trying to think about how I, how I dress for work, you
know, T I is a very casual atmosphere. 

B.2:  Uh-huh. 

A.3:  And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits and,
uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one [laughter]. 

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  Because it doesn't seem like people are really, ar-, you know, are that
alive on Monday, you know, so. 

B.6:  # Yeah.  #

A.7:  # And # then progressively through the week, I'll, I'll wear nicer looking
things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts,
or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.  Uh, but mostly what I
wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters
or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like, but.

B.8:  Yeah, uh, you know, that's a good way to approach it.  I've never thought
about, um, I do plan my clothes a week in advance.  Actually, I plan them a
month in advance.  I usually do a month at a time, so I don't repeat an
outfit.

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  But, um, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday,
because really no one's paying attention.  But anyway, um, I really, I don't
work outside of school.  Um, I work in the computer lab at school so I can
just wear whatever I have on for school, an, and, um, and really it's, I try
to dre-, dress presentable but very comfortable.

A.11:  Right. 

B.12:  Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button
up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants.
I usually, uh, you know, college is so casual, you really don't want to dress
up unless you, you, uh, have a job and you have to be there right after school
or something like that, so.

A.13:  Right.  Like where I work, it's, it's pretty casual, uh, it's, it's, I
guess it's more like a, a college campus also, I mean there's hundre-, you
know, hundreds of people work for T I.

B.14:  Yeah. 

A.15:  And, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the
time and they dress up like when customers are coming in,

B.16:  # [Laughter].  #

A.17:  # or, # uh, when we have department meetings or something like that.  And,
uh, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for
their, the real, uh, higher ups,

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # like # the the, lawy-, the T I lawyers, and, uh, those that work for the,
the higher executives, those secretaries.  They, uh, they really dress up all
the time. 

B.20:  # Oh.  #

A.21:  # So # there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know
[laughter]. 

B.22:  Well that's good that they're so casual. 

A.23:  # Yeah.  #

B.24:  # I # mean, uh, my brother works for T I and he's a computer programmer, or
computer engineer. 

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.26:  And, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to
having to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.  But, uh, he goes to work
in his blue jeans, t-shirt,

A.27:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.28:  # and # tennis shoes, and he just loves it. 

A.29:  And that's very acceptable at T I. 

B.30:  # Yeah.  #

A.31:  # I # believe at I B M they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some
kind of colored shirt and a tie. 

B.32:  That's what I've heard. 

A.33:  Uh-huh, I wo-, I would hate to be in that atmosphere. 

B.34:  But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building, he calls it
the new building.  I don't know, it's where all the executives are. 

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  And, um, and so they were, they were going to try to take their blue jean
code with them and trying to get all the, all the upper level to start wearing
blue jeans.  But, he just left for Italy today at four,

A.37:  # Oh.  #

B.38:  # and # he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of
computers for them. 

A.39:  I see. 

B.40:  Over in T, I mean for T I but over in Italy. 

A.41:  Yeah, oh, T I is everywhere. 

B.42:  Oh, yeah, he was so excited about going. 

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  But, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over
there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me
wear it [laughter]. 

A.45:  # [Laughter]  That's true, that's a good idea.  #

B.46:  # Because, uh, he just, he didn't, you # know, he's not really into all
that.  He would wear it if he had to for his job and all but, you know, if he
had the preference, I mean his, his preference is, um, blue jeans and a
t-shirt, so.

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  But I think that's great about T I, and also, uh, to get off the clothing,
the smokers, you know, how they have the,

A.49:  # The, no, #

B.50:  # the different # designated areas for smokers and stuff. 

A.51:  # Right.  #

B.52:  # I # think that's great. 

A.53:  Yeah, and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke, smoke area
and you don't smoke, you almost strangle. 

B.54:  Oh, really.  Do you smoke?

A.55:  [Laughter]  So much smoke in the air.  Yeah, areas, the smoking area, you
know, it's closed in,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # and # if you don-, if you don't smoke and you go in there, tha-,
everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when, when you go in
there.  I used to smoke a long time ago.

B.58:  # I think that's, um, #

A.59:  # I used to burn # my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes
[laughter].  I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes.  That's one of the
reason that I stopped [breathing]. 

B.60:  Well, um, y-, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college.  Well
when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions
and, uh?

A.61:  Yeah, she always had, uh, yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes. 

B.62:  See that's how, that's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and
so,

A.63:  No, I, I wasn't either, she, my daughter, she's real good at finding sales
though, you know. 

B.64:  # Oh, me to, boy I have # -- 

A.65:  # Sh-, she'll buy a lot of, #

B.66:  -- to, hunt them down [laughter]. 

A.67:  sh-, yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # and, # uh, just have them for the next year.  And she, you know, she
finds all the outlets and all the discount places and, uh, buys clothes.  Uh,
whe-, you know, when they were coming up, I, I didn't sew, but now I've, I've
learned how to sew, so I'm, well I'm, I'm still learning how, but I'm ge-, and
I'm getting much better at it and I,

B.70:  # That's great.  #

A.71:  # I'm going # to be able to make my own clothes. 

B.72:  I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just haven't fit it into my
schedule yet, but that, I mean, that can really benefit. 

A.73:  Right. 

B.74:  Um, that's something that I'd be very interested in, very interested in
learning. 

A.75:  Right, because clothes are s-, are really expensive. 

B.76:  Uh, they're outrageous!

A.77:  You know, uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you
can make for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a
decent fabric,

B.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.79:  # boy, # runs you like twenty something dollars in the store. 

B.80:  # Yeah it's, #

A.81:  # Just a # little shell to go under a suit, you know. 

B.82:  it's marked up.  It is, it is really outrageous but, uh, I mean like
whenever I, I was growing up and all, my mom, I never understood this then, but
I do now, but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come
out that were thirty dollars, or,

A.83:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.84:  # um, # or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like
that and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she wasn't
going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week. 

A.85:  Right, especially to pay that kind of money for it. 

B.86:  # Yeah.  #

A.87:  # I # have a friend who, uh, she had a, she had a ba-, a little boy and,
uh, she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus.  I mean,

B.88:  # Oh no [throat_clearing].  #

A.89:  # she dressed him, # uh, fabulously.  And then, seems like every time she
turned around he was outgrowing stuff. 

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # And # she finally learned that you just can not do this, you know.  So
now she finds the basement sales and, just like, you know, everybody else.

B.92:  That's the best way to shop.  I mean, I always thought my mom was being
mean to me but I look back at it now and my child is going to, I mean, I'm
going to raise mine the same way.

A.93:  Right. 

B.94:  Um, I don't know, I just, they're just so outrageously priced, it's just
incredible. 

A.95:  # Yes, and you, #

B.96:  # I try to, # uh, always catch the sales. 

A.97:  Right. 

B.98:  Always [laughter]. 

A.99:  And, yeah, and you just have to keep buying them, you know.  If you, if
you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the, the
quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.

B.100:  Yeah, it, it depends on, um, yeah, there's, there's always a reason why
they're on sale [laughter]. 

A.101:  Right. 

B.102:  So that, that has a lot to do with it. 

A.103:  Right. 

B.104:  But, um, well,

A.105:  Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, I
believe it was Ross Dress For Less [laughter]. 

B.106:  # Uh.  #

A.107:  # And # it wa-, it was really pretty, it was just, you know, it was just
plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater. 

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know, it had,
uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it and
I just thought it was so pretty and I go-, I got it at a real good price, I
think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something. 

B.110:  Oh, that's great. 

A.111:  And it was so pretty, and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why,
[laughter]  why it was,

B.112:  # Uh, oh.  #

A.113:  # it was # so cheap.  There was, in the middle of the back of it, there
was, it's like there, it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back
together,

B.114:  # Oh, no.  #

A.115:  # right in # the middle of the back, you know, wasn't a seam or anything,
you know. 

B.116:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.117:  And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really
noticeable, {muffled like she was moving the phone} uh, from the outside, but,

B.118:  [Laughter].  

A.119:  but still, it's, you know, it's really not, not, not a good quality.  And
then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross
is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.

B.120:  The defect. 

A.121:  Yeah, yeah, um, they don't really buy the first quality, they buy the
second.  And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds,
they'll send them back every time. 

B.122:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.123:  # But # places like Ross Dress For Less and, uh, T J Max. 

B.124:  T J Max does that,

A.125:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.126:  # yeah # we have a T J Max over here and, um,
