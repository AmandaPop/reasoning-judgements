A.1:  So, how do you keep up with the news?

@B.2:  Most of it is T V. 

A.3:  Um, do you read the newspaper?

B.4:  Yes, I do.  We get a daily, and then I get, uh, the WALL STREET JOURNAL
also. 

A.5:  Um, what daily?

B.6:  It's the CHARLOTTE OBSERVER. 

A.7:  CHARLOTTE OBSERVER.  Um, is that there in your city?

B.8:  Yes, right. 

A.9:  Uh-huh.  So, um,

B.10:  The WALL STREET JOURNAL gives financial news and other information I'm
interested in. 

A.11:  So, um, do you think you get anything from your local newspaper?

B.12:  Yes, but it's usually after the fact, uh, as far as the major topics
because most of the other has been on T V.  Don't you agree?

A.13:  Um, yeah.  I don't, I'm not exactly sure how good the national news is
though. 

B.14:  Yeah. 

A.15:  How accurate exactly?

B.16:  Oh, I think, uh, during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms
of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out, and I think
that's probably a, a good relevant, uh,

A.17:  # Fear? #

B.18:  # fear # of all of it. Yeah, I didn't see a movie a long time ago, but it
was about the news team that, um, tried to influence the world, and I, I have
a feeling that they're much more into themselves sometimes than they are into
what the world, um, is ready to hear.

A.19:  Yeah,

B.20:  # They create news.  #

A.21:  # it seems like # they're not really trying to report the news.  They are
trying to report how the news affects them. 

B.22:  Yeah, yeah.  I think so too. 

A.23:  Or where they're at with the news or something along those lines.  Um,

B.24:  Radio is sort of a catch up.  In fact, I was, um, listening to the radio
the other day and that, they were reporting on the condition of an, of an
accident victim, and I had already seen on the news about an hour before that,
that accident victim had died, but the radio news report was that he was still
in intensive care.  So, it's one of those, um, it, the most immediate is T V.
The others are catch up and fill in.

A.25:  Yeah, a little bit of color or something for the lack of total information
that was given on the T V. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  Lack, they give immediate for the lack of total. 

B.28:  How do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local
interest news?

A.29:  Well, rather biasly, I th-, I believe, huh, very procity. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  Um, for the city fathers but, uh {pause},

B.32:  # The, #

A.33:  # it # seems almost as though they don't {pause} care about how the
national news affects the local area.

B.34:  Uh-huh, I think about other topics too.  I, I'd like to go to a city and
sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city, but
it's always the national information that you have to flip through to find out
anything special about the city, and I think that's,

A.35:  Yeah, and then they give, give you just the local obits,

B.36:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # and # that's it. 

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  And well, hell, you don't know, know those people that died or, or what
from. 

B.40:  No.  The older you get the more you know though [laughter]. 

A.41:  Well, what I mean is, do you, if your in a strange city you certainly don't
know them. 

B.42:  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, that's true.  What type of work are you in?

A.43:  I work for Texas Instruments. 

B.44:  Okay.  Uh, that, uh is a news worthy company in itself so you're, you would
be interested in any news, related news. 

A.45:  Uh, yes. 

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  And yourself?

B.48:  Oh, I'm, I'm consulting right now.  I'm in between jobs.  So, it makes, uh,
it makes a difference.  I'm, I'm interested in many more industries than I used
to be just in terms of looking around.  So,

A.49:  Yeah, I understand. 

B.50:  I've been in the oil and gas business and then higher education and, um,
done a few other things, including international, uh, accounting so,

A.51:  Huh.  That's interesting I've always considered myself, um, how is this
best put, um, the ((Charles Bollfield)) trash.

B.52:  Oh, okay, [laughter] um, um. 

A.53:  Grew up in West Texas, thank you. 

B.54:  Yeah, yeah, I understand that.  I was in Oklahoma.  So, I, I know the area
very well. 

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  Um, so, do you think our local, do you think our national news tells us
anything important?

B.58:  Oh, yes.  They'll, they'll tell you a lot that's important, but the trouble
is the ((value)). Do you watch SIXTY MINUTES and some of those other,

A.59:  Um, yeah, I, I, I watch SIXTY MINUTES, # almost religiously.  #

B.60:  # I won-, # wonder sometimes where they get those topics, you know, some of
the topics are very, very good and others are like, uh, who, who, who dreamed
this subject up, you know,

A.61:  # Well and, #

B.62:  # and far # as affecting a national audience, I wonder sometimes. 

A.63: And more importantly than that I wonder how the other side of the story is. 

B.64:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

A.65:  And of course, they're not going to tell the other side of the story, and
they're not going to tell it accurately. 

B.66:  No.  But I do enjoy, we are here temporarily.  I enjoyed having C N N, so
that I could tune in the news any time I wanted to and not wait for network
broadcasting. 

A.67:  Uh, we don't, we don't have cable. 

B.68:  Okay, it's, it's a good addition because I think they're, they have a lot
of news obviously all the time and, #there's not the pressure then,#

A.69:  #Yeah, we've watched# little bits here and there during the Gulf Crisis,

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # and # we,

B.72:  Yeah.  The,

A.73:  I didn't exac-, I wasn't exactly sure how accurate it was either. 

B.74:  Oh, I think, it, it too is under pressure. 

A.75:  And it seemed as though during the Gulf Crisis it might have been under
pressure from {pause} the incorrect side. 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yes, it was.  #There are games played.# 

A.77:  #I, I'm not sure#  how to phrase that, uh, delicately. 

B.78:  Psychological warfare is a big factor all the way around,

A.79:  # Yeah, it is.  #

B.80:  # um, it's been, # it's been a big factor for many, many years, but this is
the first, uh, first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up.  It,

A.81:  I, I didn't feel comfy, you know, I, you know, you always hear about the
warm fuzzy feeling. 

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  I kept watching that, be it C N N in a bar or, or, or, or local news at
home,

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.85:  # or # federal news at home,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # or, # see, um, we don't subscribe to our Colorado Springs paper, we
subscribe to,

B.88:  # ((A different paper)) okay.  #

A.89:  # a different paper.  And, # um, but on occasion, more than occasionally,
we'll buy the local paper,

B.90:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # and that # warm fuzzy that we're talking about, I never could get that
warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about are these people really
telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth. 

B.92:  Yeah, I think all the truth is, is the big issue.  They obviously had to be
telling a lot of truth, because they were there reporting firsthand, but in
terms of,

A.93:  Well, I'd suspect that to be true but, you couldn't prove it to me. 

B.94:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.95:  And, and most importantly I {pause} couldn't believe any of those people. 
They didn't seem believable. 

B.96:  Did you just switch back and forth between programs?

A.97:  Oh, all four.  Um, well we have the independent here, and we've got the
three majors and P B S, and we watched all four of those and on, more than
occasionally I went to a bar that had C N N running around the clock. 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  And still I got this feeling as though, from these six or eight news
sources I had that, something was missing.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  I think they, they withhold when it's advantageous both sides,
both sides,

A.101:  # And, #

B.102:  # and # I think when Norman announced afterwards on the BARBARA WALTERS
SHOW,

A.103:  # Oh, Stormin' Norman? #

B.104:  # yes, that, um, # he knew, you know, what to expect out of S-, Saddam
Hussein that he was playing games, you know, and, and they both were, I think
that's all part of warfare is to play games. 

A.105:  Oh, of course, and you've got to expect that. 

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  But I had the feeling that no matter who I listened to, it wasn't that they
weren't telling me the truth, I felt that someone was lying to me,

B.108:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.109:  # and # there's nothing there still at this state that I can put my finger
on, and say, oh, here's where they lied to me, just a feeling. 

B.110:  Yeah, well, let's hope we don't have to go through that again [laughter]. 

A.111:  Yes.  Wouldn't it be wonderful #if there were no more wars?# 

B.112:  #Oh, that would be nice.#  I hope we never, never get to, but I'm afraid,
um, human nature is such that somewhere there'll be a fanatic that will start
something. 

A.113:  And more importantly wouldn't it be nice in this land of the free and home
of the brave if there were never again be any misinformation. 

B.114:  Oh yes, oh, yes.
