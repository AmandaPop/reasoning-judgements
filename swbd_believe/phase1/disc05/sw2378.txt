============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Jay, um, could you tell me, uh, what your thoughts are about crime.

@B.2:  I tell you what, here in Dallas it's, uh, it's awful bad because that,
they're, I, I believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes.
Uh, where you see armed robbery and, and, uh, rape and murder, you know, are
starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area.  And, uh, that's, that's
getting, that's getting scary because I grew up in a real small town, and I
moved here to Dallas and, uh, it's been a rude awakening, I tell you.

A.3:  Oh, so that's, what do you do work in Plano?

B.4:  Uh, right, right.

A.5:  How, how far away is that from Dallas, from #the city itself?#

B.6:  #Well, see it's, it,# it's really just a suburb, uh, I really can't even
tell where [noise] {like television} Plano starts and Dallas, #Dallas ends.#

A.7:  #Oh, so it,#

B.8:  But, uh, I grew up in a real small town in north Texas and, uh, moved
down here to Plano, an, and, uh, it's, uh, it's definitely a big change
[talking].

A.9:  Yeah, that's, uh, that's the same with me.  Well, um, I grew up in a rural
area, there's nothing but farms.

B.10:  Right. 

A.11:  And I still live in the same area, it's, it's built up somewhat.  and crime
really hasn't been a problem.  It's been, uh, uh, mostly outsiders coming in
and, you know, robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing, uh,

B.12:  #I see [/Talking].#  

A.13:  #radios# and cassettes and things like that. 

B.14:  Not really the violent crimes then?

A.15:  [Throat_clearing] Not so much in, in the town I live in now, but, but the
closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it's Boston which is
about, uh, oh, forty-five, fifty miles away.

B.16:  I #s-,#

A.17:  #Which# is really not that far. 

B.18:  Right. [Talking] 

A.19:  And Providence is only like a dozen miles from, from where I am.

B.20:  Okay, so that's real close. 

A.21:  [Throat_clearing] But the cities down there, yeah, and, and the next one up
is, uh, is a small city between me and Providence.

B.22:  Right. 

A.23:  And that, they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight, they're taking
the, the crime now the latest thing up here is, uh, they'll, somebody be
driving along whether they're, they're in their early twenty's or, or teens,

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  and they'll steal jackets and they'll holdup kids and they'll take their
jackets and chains.

B.26:  #Oh, Lord.#

A.27:  #You know,# just get out of the car and, because they have got some of
these like the leather jackets are, are quite expensive.

B.28:  Right.  You know, I've heard about that, uh, also for tennis shoes.  There
was, uh, uh, [noise] a big surge going on, oh just last year I think, where,
uh, kids like in New York, uh, were, uh, knocking off other kids to get their
tennis shoes.

A.29:  That's, [laughter] that's incredible. 

B.30:  [Talking] Yeah, I tell you what though, if you go price some of those
tennis shoes I can see why now, you know, they're getting up in the hundred
dollar range,

A.31:  Yeah that's,  

B.32:  and that just seems ridiculous. 

A.33:  Yeah, for a pair of tennis shoes.

B.34:  For a pair of tennis shoes, #yeah.#

A.35:  #Yeah,# yeah no shoe is worth that, that price.

B.36:  That's right [laughter].

A.37:  You know, not to, not to go out and scuff up and, but I don't know what
the, it's [throat_clearing],

B.38:  I don't know what the answer is though, to, to try to fix that problem.

A.39:  It's probably the, uh, the times now, um, 

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  I know you guys down there have had, have had a problem for a while which
we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and,

B.42:  Exactly.  Yeah, just ea-, overall economic, uh, times around here in Texas
have been tough.

A.43:  Yeah, and rents are extremely high, I mean, people, and they just don't
care.

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  You know, it's either, it's either you go out and you, and you steal
something, or you, you bash somebody over the head.

B.46:  To get it, yeah.

A.47:  #Or you starve.#

B.48:  #Well ano-,# another problem I think is the, the drugs, you know, uh,
people have to get money,

A.49:  [Throat_clearing].

B.50:  for the, the drugs,

A.51:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.  

B.52:  and, and they'll just go out --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- and do anything they can to do it.

A.55:  We had, we had, uh, an incident in our town not too far from where I live,
where, uh, the police made a raid on (( )) and most of them were teenagers or,
or, or in their early twenties.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  Which is unheard of in a small town, you know, you don't usually
associate, associate that,

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  but they did, they made the raid and the whole town was upset.  But I'm
not so sure now, if, if, uh, if the drugs are really prevalent, they're saying
that alcohol now is, is, uh, one of the major contributors.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  Like all of, all the students now on campus, I guess, most of them drink
or have binges on weekends and,

B.62:  Exactly.

A.63:  and, going to school, is also always very prohibitive now unless your
parents are wealthy,

B.64:  #Right.#

A.65:  #you know,# you either have to take a loan or, most of them don't work or
if they work, they work part-time for,

B.66:  Yeah, it's hard to get a job, you know.

A.67:  minimum wage.  Yeah,

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  yeah, I'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up, but up here
it's, it's terrible.

B.70:  You know we really haven't, uh, because the oil industry just hasn't come
back like it was, and so much of our economy was based on that.

A.71:  So, you're still suffering then,

B.72:  Yeah, yeah.

A.73:  as far as that goes. 

B.74:  Right.  That, that and real estate, you know, just have not come back, uh,
even close to what they were.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  And, um, yeah Dallas is, you know, you can see some economic turnarounds
but, uh, and I don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was,
you know, it was really blowing and going there for a while.

A.77:  Yeah, I was down, [throat_clearing], I was in Dallas about, uh, twelve,
thirteen years ago, and then I just went down again last month, #for a week,#

B.78:  #I see.#

A.79:  and it was, it's like one huge city when I was flying in.

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  It was just all lights.

B.82:  [Laughter].

A.83:  But you couldn't tell there was a problem.

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  You know, because it's so huge.
 
B.86:  Right and,

A.87:  Part of the problem, too, I think up here is, I mean, um, [lipsmack] all
the banking crisis, all the white collar crimes, uh, stock brokers have been
getting away with bloody murder, the bankers have been getting away with
bloody murder,

B.88:  Right.

A.89:  nobody's being prosecuted,

B.90:  That's right.

A.91:  So,

B.92:  What's going to stop them from,

A.93:  Right, what's, 

B.94:  you know, other people, t-, 

A.95:  yeah, what's, what's the poor guy going to do that's, that's, you know,
being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support
and he's got no job.  Um, I'm not sure how much of that is, is crime, rather
than just kids out there for a good time, yeah.

B.96:  Well, that's true too, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, the violent crime is,
is, uh, definitely something's got to be done on that because,

A.97:  Yeah, because there's more and more, there's more murders we had, uh,

B.98:  Right [Laughter] {in background}

A.99:  just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had
five murders,

B.100:  Golly, #that's ridiculous.#

A.101:  #Yeah, I mean,# Rho-, Rhode Island's just like a neighborhood compared to
you guys down there.

B.102:  Right [Laughter].

A.103:  It's just so, so, so small.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  And nobody even cares, or nobody seems to care.

B.106:  They just overlook that #as, uh,#

A.107:  #Yeah.# 

B.108:  common occurrence.  

A.109:  Yeah, and if it's drug related they turn the other way,

B.110:  [Talking].

A.111:  because that's one less problem that they have to put up with, the law
enforcement.

B.112:  Right.  #Oh that's {very faint},#

A.113:  #And, uh,# if they do come in, I've got some friends on the police force
and they say that, you know, they apprehend somebody and they bring,

B.114:  [Talking].

A.115:  them in, and, uh, they let them out, they're out on the street before they
get their reports done.

B.116:  Golly.  That's terrible isn't it?

A.117:  So, there's no checks and balances.

B.118:  Right. 

A.119:  And I'm not sure what, what to do about that or #which way it's going to
go.#

B.120:  #Well, see, I'm not either because I'm,# I'm really not for higher taxes,
you know, to go out and pay for, uh, more people to be out on the street.

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  As far as the officers and things like that, but, uh,

A.123:  They're being overwhelmed, I think anyhow.  I mean,

B.124:  I think, yeah, that's true.  

A.125:  the fire power against them now is, is atrocious. 

B.126:   #And, uh, {very faint},#

A.127:  #You know,# they've got all kinds of automatic weapons, these criminals do.

B.128:  Right. 

A.129:  And these poor guys out there, uh, trying to uphold the law, um, I don't
know, --

B.130:  So I don't know,

A.131:  -- I kind of think they should bring back capital punishment.

B.132:  Well, I do, too, and, you know, I know people argue that that's really not
a deterrent and,

A.133:  Well,

B.134:  people don't think about that but, I've, I've got to believe that in the
back of their mind, if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and
that, you know, they're going to get the death penalty then, and that it will
actually happen, #you know, so many,#

A.135:   #It's, yeah,# yeah.  

B.136:  so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then, you know, just
end up in prison, uh,

A.137:  Yeah, for twenty or thirty years, or, 

B.138:  Right.  

A.139:  ((forever)) there's no,

B.140:  You know, with the chance of even getting paroled and, uh, you know, that's
just, I just don't understand that.

A.141:  Yeah, um,

B.142:  But,

A.143:  and when I say there's no deterrent, you know, of the death penalty, um,
that's like saying, uh, you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's
not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads.

B.144:  Right.  That's true, yeah. 

A.145:  So, i-, it just doesn't hold water, 

B.146:  Right.

A.147:  and you look at some of the other countries that, that have the death
penalty, and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the
violent crime rates that we do.

B.148:  Right.  Right, because, you know, a lot of countries just shoot you on the
spot, you know,

A.149:  [Laughter].  

B.150:  forget that trial and the jury and all that, you know, they just,

A.151:  Ye-, i-, yeah, I wouldn't want to see it go that far,

B.152:  [Laughter].  

A.153:  you know, give them due process and then, and then, let them,

B.154:  And then do it, huh?  [laughter].   

A.155:  and then let them ((appeal)) yeah, then you'd get, yeah, 

B.156:  That's right. 

A.157:  because some of it, some of it's, it's, it's just down right, uh, mean, I
mean they go out #there,#

B.158:  #Right.#  

A.159:  just, just for the sake of, of harming somebody,

B.160:  Exactly [Cough] {in background}.  

A.161:  and those are the people that, you know, can you rehabilitate them?  Y-,
some of the ones that are, you know, perpetual, um.

B.162:  Exactly, and, and, you know, I don't even know if they are worth
rehabilitating if, if, uh, they go out and commit some of these violent
crimes.  So,

A.163:  Yeah.

B.164:  But I don't know what the answer is.  We'll just have to, I guess, each,
each person will just have to try to do their part and,

A.165:  Yeah, he can, [throat_clearing], because it's, eventually it's going to,
it's going to swing back.

B.166:  Right. 

A.167:  It was, they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way
and everybody ((swore)), you know, we're no better than they are if we, if we
put the death penalty in and ...
