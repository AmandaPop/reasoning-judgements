=========================================================================

A.1:  [Beep] Okay, what is your, uh, general opinion, then of, of taxes for the
Americans?

B.2:  Uh, I don't think that I'm paying too many tax-, you know, too much tax
myself.

A.3:  Yeah {faint}.

B.4:  Uh, I, uh, as far as, uh, you know, federal and state, uh, the, uh, the
state I live in has a five percent sales tax.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Uh, it's quite a bit different than, uh, Texas.  I don't know if you've
ever been outside of Texas, but, uh, when I moved to Texas I was told, Oh,
well there's no personal income tax.  Well, they nail you on property taxes
in, uh, Texas, and then that's how they get their money to take care of the
schools and things.

A.7:  Right, yeah.  Uh, as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the,
the tax situation in Texas because the, the schools are not, they're not
equitable within the state so they're changing the, they're talking about
changing the, uh, the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the
schools which will probably mean, uh, another increase in property taxes.
Either that or the, starting a state income tax.

B.8:  Yeah, I, I found it interesting, uh, when I moved to Texas the fact that,
uh, the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the
Plano school district because it was the best because it had more money than,
you know, other places and, uh, I, I just, uh, in the, uh, like here in
Maryland, uh, I just bought a, uh, a house for a hundred and forty-one
thousand.  It would be about sixty thousand down there [laughter],

A.9:  [Laughter]. 

B.10:  and, uh, the tax basis is actually, uh, less than the full price of the
house.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  So you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at.  I
think they only have the house valued at probably about [throat_clearing]
ninety or a hundred thousand dollars.

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  Whereas, when I was in Texas I notice that they put the tax basis at, at
almost the, uh --

A.15:  Almost full value.  

B.16:  -- full price.  

A.17:  Price, yeah.  

B.18:  And so there's quite a difference there.  

A.19:  Yeah {faint}.

B.20:  Uh, I think that the way they, they levy taxes is a little bit, uh, uh,
crazy.  I think if, if, they, uh, people, and, and I'll use Plano as an
example, uh, house prices in Plano were falling and so they decided, well, in
order to get more tax revenue, we're going to have to raise the price --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- uh, you know we're going to have to raise the, uh, the, the, uh, tax per
hundred dollars of value of the house and same time they were approving new
starts in homes hand over fist.  Well, when you start having a large supply of
homes then, of course, the price goes, you know, the value of the house is
going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling.

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  The new homes they were building cheaper and, and able to sell cheaper and
so people weren't buying the existing family homes.

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  So they were shooting themselves in the foot,

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  and, you know, if they, just would have thought, Well, gee, if we don't,
you know, if we put a freeze on new home starts, that will bring the price of
houses back up, our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase
taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here.

A.29:  Yeah.  I guess that's a possibility.  Uh, as I understand it, Maryland does
not have any, uh, state income tax.

B.30:  No.  

A.31:  Is that right?  

B.32:  No, they do have state income tax.  

A.33:  Oh, okay.  So,

B.34:  Yeah, that's, and they, uh, they divide it up by, uh, you know, you pay a
state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county
tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties.

A.35:  Okay.  Then, uh, all of your state income tax is deductible for federal
income tax purposes.

B.36:  That is correct.  

A.37:  Okay.  Did you live in Texas after the, uh, after they stopped letting you
deduct, uh, sales tax on your tax return?

B.38:  Uh, yes I did.  I only lived in Texas in eighty-seven and, uh, eighty-eight
and, uh, part of eighty-nine.

A.39:  Okay, so, so you couldn't deduct state inco-, uh, state sales tax when you
lived in Texas.

B.40:  No.  

A.41:  So what do you think about the difference between those two situations.

B.42:  Uh, in Texas I was, oh, I believe the, uh, t-, sales tax was somewhere
around seven, eight, eight percent.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Here in Maryland it's only five.  Uh, it was nice to have that, uh, you
know, deduction --

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  -- when it was available, uh, but when they revamped the, you know,
supposedly making things more fair, uh, I've heard a lot of different
arguments, uh, pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales
tax or even, uh, maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when
you think about it, the people that purchase more items are the ones that are
better able to pay the taxes.

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  You know, people that are out there barely struggling to pay their, uh,
house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying, you know, anything
else, and the people that, you know, have the, uh, disposable income that are
probably more able to pay the income tax, uh, or pay the sales tax are the
ones that are really, you know, have the money and they're out there buying
the items.  Maybe they should be, you know, paying more of the burden.  Uh,
there wa-, there's another crazy thing that gets me.  It's like the more
children you have, the less tax you pay and to me that is completely crazy.
And I have five children so,

A.49:  [Laughter].  

B.50:  I mean, you know, I, uh --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- I, you know, it, it's kind of odd when I talk about this with other
people because it, it just doesn't make sense to me.  You're getting more
services --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- you know, your children are going, you know, you've got five children in
school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you, they're
paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school.  It just, you
know, doesn't make sense.

A.55:  Yeah, that's, that's an interesting, uh, interesting concept.  I hadn't
thought about that, how you, you, you know, that, that's right, I guess
[laughter] in a sense.  I guess the, you know, the idea is that, uh, the more
people you have in the family, the more allowances you need, you know, the
more, uh, capability you need to, uh, to pay for food and clothing and stuff
for them --

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- so the, they give you more allowances, more dependent allowances for
that.  But, uh, you know, I understand what you're, where you're coming from
with the,

B.58:  Yeah.  Now, the other side of the question is about are we getting what
we're paying for.  Um, for the most part, I think we are, but there is a lot
of inefficiency.  Uh, both on the federal level and on the state level.  And,
uh, hopefully, w-, you know, as --

A.59:  Yeah {faint}.

B.60:  -- we start to go into computerization and all the processes, maybe we'll
be able to streamline it.  Uh, I haven't kept up with, uh, the Texas politics
other than that dirty little governor fight --

A.61:  Yeah {faint}.

B.62:  -- but, I mean, uh, we have a, a governor here in Maryland who's, uh,
pretty hard nosed.  And, uh, he's, you know, we're three hundred fifty million
dollars short.  And every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money,
everybody starts screaming and yelling.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  And, uh, every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try
to do something, you know, they start screaming and yelling.  They won't let
him raise the taxes and, and they, they won't let him cut any programs --

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  -- and he's, like, what do you guys want me to do.  

A.67:  [Laughter].   

B.68:  [Laughter] I mean,

A.69:  I guess, uh, one thought that occurred to me, uh, is we're, we're talking
about having a national, uh, military or, or public service deal for young
people.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  Maybe a program like that could replace some of the, uh, welfare programs
if, uh, you know, if we're going to do that, then we ought to really get some
benefit, dollar benefits out of it that, uh, to reduce spending in some other
areas, uh, you know, to do something to eliminate what, uh, what they refer to
as transfer payments --

B.72:  Yes.  

A.73:  -- because, uh, that's, I think that's where our real, you know, the real
problem with government is not, is not what the, not what the government's
doing, but where it's spending its money.  It's, it's encouraging people to,
to, uh, not do as well as they can, you know, uh, not have as much output and
all that.  You're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have
more kids, and you know, like you said, you know, more kids you have, the more
dependents you have, you know, the allowances you get and, uh, the more you
have, the more, uh, Aid For Dependent Children you can get and all of these --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- things go into it so, but, uh, some kind of a national service, uh,
concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a, I think would be
a big step so, 

B.76:  Yeah, that, and I think, uh, putting more emphasis on local handling of the
problem.  I think this is something that, that Bush came out and said in his,
uh, in his address, uh, to the nation at the beginning of the year.

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  Uh, you know, it used to be that communities would take care of their own
and that, you know, the states would take care of the communities.  And then
all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government --

A.79:  Right, it, uh,

B.80:  -- and, uh, you know, once you start up at the top and try to get those
dollars on down to the hands that need them, you know, there's a lot of places
the money stops and disappears along the way.

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  And, uh, maintenance and overhead and, you know, and --

A.83:  Yeah, right {faint}.

B.84:  -- and those kind of costs.  

A.85:  I, I think that a, a big part of the, uh, you know, the government concept
over the last fifty years has been, uh, redistribution of, uh, of wealth in,
in effect.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  Uh, you know, you, you tax the people that have the most and the people
that don't have anything get it for nothing.

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  And, uh, and I don't think that's the American way myself.  It, uh, it --

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  -- kind of rings of, you know, socialism, and, and I just, I don't
understand why the American leaders, uh, seem to think that that's the way to
go, you know, that, uh, there are not, I don't think that there are that many
people that feel that way that with what they could get support for.

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  Or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to.

B.94:  Yeah, there, there's, uh, you know, once you reach a certain plateau in, in
finances, uh ...
