REMARKS:        The two female voices sounded very similar.  And Speaker A
seemed more muffled.  Both voices have echo.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what kind of pets do you have?

B.2:  At the present time we have none.  We intend to purchase a pup in two
months.

A.3:  Are yo-, you're married?

B.4:  Yes.

A.5:  Ne-, newly married?

B.6:  No, we've got, uh, we've been married forever --

A.7:  Oh [laughter].

B.8:  -- about eight years, eight years, two kids [laughter].

A.9:  So what else.  Only we started off ours with, we had, we had pets before we
had kids.  That's why I thought when you were saying, you know, we're going to
have one in two months, or something, perhaps that you were newly married
[laughter].

B.10:  No. We've, uh, we-, we've got a five year old, but we've had one pet since
we've had her, but, uh, he didn't quite work out --

A.11:  Hm.

B.12:  -- and so, um, we-, uh, we've been now petless for a couple of years, and
we're going to get another one this summer.  We're, we've a got a vacation
planned, and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we --

A.13:  That's easier.

B.14:  -- bring a puppy in.

A.15:  Are you going to get a dog?

B.16:  Yeah. Yeah.

A.17:  That's what, that's what we have is two dogs. 

B.18:  What kind?

A.19:  Big dogs.  Well our first, at first they were our child substitutes before
we had our children [laughter].  And we got one right after we got married.  We
both decided we needed a dog.  We went to the pound, and we got this mutt.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  And he's been, it was alright, before we had our kids, it was, he's just,
he's a real hyper dog.  He barks, and, and jumps a lot.  So we had him for a
year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for
his entire life to have a Siberian husky.

B.22:  Goodness.

A.23:  And I think, why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog
[laughter], that this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky.  So
we got the other one for him and to keep the first one company when we were at
work all day.

B.24:  Right. 

A.25:  So we have, the, the old-, the older dog's a male, and he's, oh gosh
{whispering}, he weighs about forty pounds.  And then Pepper is a year younger
and she weighs about seventy pounds [laughter].

B.26:  Yeah, #they're big dogs.#

A.27:  #So we have two massive dogs.#  Go through lots of dog food.

B.28:  Yeah.  Are they primarily outdoor dogs?

A.29:  Absolutely.  I never wanted, my husband wanted indoor dogs, because he'd
grown up with them.  But I can't stand it indoors.  I don't, they shed, and,
you know, the mud, and,

B.30:  And the scratches, #and the smell, and the, uh, wherever, yeah.#

A.31:  #Oh, yeah, for me,# dogs are meant to be outside [laughter].

B.32:  I firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside.  We had Danes
when I was a child.

A.33:  Goodness.

B.34:  And, um, and we had our Danes in the house.

A.35:  Oh my goodness.

B.36:  But, I mean [laughter] it's almost dangerous to have them in the house.

A.37:  They're going to run you down [laughter].

B.38:  And, uh, we went through a time period that we had three Danes.

A.39:  Goodness, and all of them were in the house?

B.40:  Yeah, and we had, we had had a litter, and she had, uh, had thirteen
puppies --

A.41:  Hm.

B.42:  -- eight of which survived, and, uh, and she, we ended up keeping one of
those puppies.

A.43:  I see.

B.44:  We had the mom, the dad, and one of the puppies, and it was horrendous.  We
wound up getting uh, getting rid of the mom, selling the puppy and just
keeping the dad, because dad was the favorite one anyway [laughter].

A.45:  Oh, when I was growing up my folks, we had fox terriers, which are little
bitty.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  They weigh about ten pounds.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  And so we had, we had one for a long time, and then, oh gosh, when I was
about ten or eleven, I guess, my parents decided that dogs would be a good way
to teach reproduction.  So then they went out and got a female [laughter] --

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  -- and then we started having puppies.  And she had, she had four or five
litters.  She always had to look, we always kept them in the house when they
had the, when she, when the babies were little.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  And the rest of the time they were outside.  They had, we had a big, uh,
kind of a play house, and part of that was their dog house.  It was kind of
cordoned off.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  So they had a place to stay out there, and then they had the yard.  And
they had a little run that, uh, they kept them in when we were trying to do
stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out.  But we had the same kind of
situation at one point in time.  We had the mother, the, one of her last, her
next to last litter, we kept, we had one, one we never could get rid of.  He
was a real dumb dog [laughter].  Nobody wanted him.  The puppy was just one of
these dogs,

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  [Laughter] just as dumb as a stick, and we have him.  And then our fema-,
she had another litter.  We didn't think she was, we thought she was too old
to get pregnant again.  Turned out she wasn't,

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  and, uh, she had her litter.  I guess her last litter had, like, four,
and two of them survived.  And then she didn't make it --

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  -- two days after th-, they were born.  She had a, she died.  She had some
kind of an infection from it all.  She was just too old.  We had to feed the
puppies.  We had to get up night and day with tho-, just like with a baby.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  Yeah, and bottle feed them.

B.64:  We had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born,
and we had to feed all their bab-, feed all the babies.  There were five and
there were four of them that survived.

A.65:  Weren't they messy too, well did she, did the mother survive?

B.66:  Yeah.  She did survive.

A.67:  So you could still feed it, but she kept them clean.

B.68:  No.

A.69:  Oh she didn't.

B.70:  No, she didn't even, she did not even take the sa-.  This is the laziest
dog that ever lived.  When she had these puppies, she crawled up onto my
mother's stomach in the middle of the bed, had the puppies, and woke up my
mother --

A.71:  Oh no [laughter].

B.72:  -- to cut the sacks off.  She didn't even lick the sacks off.  Laziest dog
on earth.  She never, she never nursed them, she never cleaned them, she never
did anything to them.  They were like, sh-, they didn't exist.

A.73:  That was like, oh boy, they are so messy when they're little, too
[laughter].

B.74:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.75:  We were giving them a bath about every other da-.  (( )) bath at least once
a day.  But they were so horrible.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  They would roll and everything.  And oh,

B.78:  Yeah.  They just poop and it's,

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  And crawl through it [laughter]. 

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  I guess I had fish for a while when I was a kid, too.  I had a fish tank.
And I had a few, until,

B.84:  Like a nice aquarium?

A.85:  Well, it wasn't really an aquarium.  It was an old, you know how you used
to have these, um, this was a box, and it was originally, it was made like an
aquarium, I guess, except it was smaller.  It was, its original use was to put
in the refrigerator on the shelf.  Had a little spigot at one end --

B.86:  Oh, yeah.

A.87:  -- that you could get water out of it, you know, keep cold water.

B.88:  [Laughter] Oh, yeah.

A.89:  We outgrew the need for that, and so I used it for an aquarium.

B.90:  That's great.

A.91:  It worked, except the fish could swim, it wasn't tall enough.  I kept th-,
if I didn't keep the lid on it the fish would, uh, swim out and flop on the
floor sometimes [laughter].  Flip out of the thing.

B.92:  The cat was always happy.

A.93:  Yeah.  Those have been, I mean, and our dogs, now our dogs, with our kids,
I have two little kids, three and a half and one and a half.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  So we built the dog run down the length of our, uh, back yard, because the
kids were get-,.  I mean, we couldn't even let our older son, until he was
about two, I guess he was two when we built the dog run.  We couldn't let him
go out in the back yard, because it was.  We have a deck with a rail, and he
could go on that.  But the dogs were so big, and he was so little.  You know,
they just even walking by him they'd knock him down --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and the whole back yard had poop in it all the time.  It was a mess for
the little one.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  So now we have a back yard and a dog run.

B.100:  Uh.  We've, uh, we'll probably get real small Cairn terrier.

A.101:  Oh, that'll be nice.

B.102:  And, it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog.

A.103:  Yeah, back and forth.

B.104:  But, see, my, my oldest is five and a half, and so she can take part in
some of the, uh, responsibilities.  A three and a half year old,

A.105:  Three and a half year old, yeah.

B.106:  really can't quite,

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  take part of many of the responsibilities.  Maybe feeding them.

A.109:  Or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too, you
know, poke on it too much.

B.110:  Oh, she's got respect for animals.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  Thank goodness.

A.113:  Course, our kids have gotten over it with the dogs, behind it, they have
the run, it's kind of like a wire run, so they go, the first thing they do, is
they go out there and play with them, but boy, the little one still, he just
wants to poke.  My older one, our older son's pretty good about it.  He'll pet
the dog, you know [laughter].

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  And, and he's three and a half, like you're saying, and he, he's pretty
good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into.  But
boy, the little one still just wants to poke and, and, see if the dog will
back off.  You know, and,

B.116:  I think that's eighteen months.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  I mean, I think that's just,

A.119:  Yeah, I think it is too.

B.120:  kids trying to figure out, you know, what's going to happen, and it will
happen again and again and again [laughter].

A.121:  Yeah, I think if we didn't have pets, if we didn't already have our dog and
cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little.

B.122:  Yeah.
 
A.123:  I think, when they're really little, like the eighteen month old, it's not
fair to the animal.  The kids are so miserable to them, [laughter] if they're
out very much.

B.124:  Yeah, yeah.  It has to be a real mellow kind of animal, that can, uh,
survive it.

A.125:  Yeah, and not get mad at the kid.  That's the other thing too, that.  I, I
always felt Pepper, the Siberian husky, is really sweet.  She can, I think the
kids could walk up and they could literally probably stand on her back, and
she wouldn't even, she'd kind of look at them like what are you doing now
[laughter].  She's real good natured about it.

B.126:  Well, that's what you, I mean, that's what you need in a pet if your going
to have small children, too.

A.127:  Yeah.

B.128:  But we, uh, 

A.129:  Well, I think that's about all my pet stories right now. So [laughter],

B.130:  I'm just flat out of pet stories. I don't even have a pet anymore.

A.131:  Okay, well, it's been nice talking to you.

B.132:  Well thank you, thanks for calling.

A.133:  Okay #bye-bye.#

B.134:  #Bye-bye.#
