REMARKS:        Very slow moving.  Speaker B at times almost seemed like he
was bored or tired of talking.

============================================================================

A.1:  I, I really don't know enough about the Middle East to form solid opinions,
but, uh, how about you.  Do you have solid opinions on U S involvement?

B.2:  Well, I, I thinks its been interesting to hear, you know, about the overall
outlook and before we ended the war, what implications we'd be dealing with,
uh, you know, the strong religious beliefs, and, you know, it's just another,
uh --

A.3:  totally different world,

B.4:  -- attitude, you know, and what we are really getting into and the fact
that that war, you know, coalition forces stuck together, uh, and, uh, you
know, I just think now is that they shou-, should have finished it all off.
Because I think we're just going to see reap the gu-, {mispoke the words the
first try} repercussions down the line, because he's still probably maintained
power.  It sounds like he's, you know, knocked down the revolt.

A.5:  So you're saying that the coalition forces who got, went ahead and gone in
and taken out Iraq instead of just recapturing Kuwait,

B.6:  Or at least Saddam Hussein.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  You know, if they, uh,

A.9:  And the bad thing is, I mean, you can't do that because the the Saudis
asked, you know, the Saudis were helping, you know, out only under the
condition that they would help, that the United States and the coalition force
would help Kuwait regain their country,

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  and other, otherwise,

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  otherwise,

B.14:  No, I, I don't think a lot of them didn't want him to lose, com-, you know
--

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- power completely, but it's hard to say.

A.17:  And plus, it's illegal, you know, in warfare or any other kind of, uh,
international, uh,

B.18:  Yeah,

A.19:  to go against, 

B.20:  to go after the political heads of state.

A.21:  Exactly.  You can't go after the leader.  You can't legally do that.  Then
again, you know, there's people who say war is war, everything's fair, but
that's just not, it-, it's like some, you know, Geneva convention, or
something like that, said it.

B.22:  Yeah, anyway, but now it looks like, uh, Kuwait has asked us to defend its
borders.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  More of a permanent type of basis, which will be a first.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Uh, it's interesting, uh,

A.27:  Yeah, but it-, it-, it's very hard to deal with people that don't bel-,
don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do, you
know, it's like, as we think that Saddam Hussein ruined the country and that,
that, that Iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could
decide what they want.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  But, then again, you got, you have all the Palestinians that think that
this Saddam Hussein is, is, is a God, is, is someone who is going to relieve
them of all their troubles, and how can you get across to the people that
think that, you know, their sav-, your telling them that their savior is a
person of empty promises.  You can't, you know.  It's hard, it's hard to do
that.  So it's hard to change a diff-, a country, especially in the Middle
East --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- which has different views on life.

B.32:  Yeah. I don't know if the United States is interested as much as
establishing a democracy as opposed to just,

A.33:  Getting him out, yeah.

B.34:  getting rid of Saddam.  You know, if, uh.  But, you know, we'll see, if
anything, if he, if he gets stability and he doesn't, you know, get knocked
off, you know, by a coup or something down the line, you know, what happens on
down the road.  I just, uh, it'll be interesting.

A.35:  I think, I think the United States should, uh, stick around and play a
role, but I don't think that United States should uh, get directly involved
from now on.  They should kind of --

B.36:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.37:  -- stay, stay on the outside of, of the events, you know, kind of, I don't
know how to say i-, say it exactly in words, but you know, just kind of stay
with one eye looking in the situation.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Make sure that, the United States can go in when need be, you know.  It's
not like --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- that we'll be ready,

B.42:  Yeah, interesting.

A.43:  if they ever ask for help.

B.44:  Interesting, there's like a two square mile area that's occupied by some
Iraqi soldiers and Kuwait's saying it's their land.  And did, did their line
of demarcation, don't they call it, and they've already outlined that for the
cease fire.  And uh, apparently we don't want to deal with that, but the
Kuwaitis want these [laughter] this land back that they're saying is theirs.
So it's,

A.45:  So there's already some trouble brewing.

B.46:  interesting that we said, that we said no, we're not going to get
involved.  You know, we've already --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- established, you know, the line of cease fire, you know, and, uh, the
demarcation line, so, um, they were definitely trying to avoid any
hostilities.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  I thought it was interesting, though, that we did shoot down some of their
airplanes when they went up.  But I don't think they're doing that any more.

A.51:  You mean after the cease fire?

B.52:  Yeah,

A.53:  Well I think,

B.54:  yeah they warned them.  We told them we would.  This is after the cease
fire.

A.55:  Yeah, I think, uh, they, they also shot down some gunships.  Is that what
you're talking about, the, uh, helicopter gun ships that they shot down?

B.56:  I don't know.  Maybe they were helicopters.  I thought they were, I thought
they were letting the helicopters fly around.

A.57:  Because what I heard was that the, that the military was shooting down
civilians and, and, um, anti Hussein troops with the gun ships.

B.58:  Anyway, so it's,

A.59:  It's a mess.  It's hard, it's hard for two different societies to get
together and, and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so
many things.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  And then, you know, and, and especially with the Middle East the way it is,
it's too insane.  The Arabs are fighting amongst themselves, and then one Arab
decides to ask a non Arab for help and they just kind of turns everybody else
against them.  Like, you know, that's why the Palestinians were, were rooting
for, or were pulling for Hussein, because they're all Arabs.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  And they really didn't like the idea of the United States coming in and
helping out Kuwait who was so rich.

B.64:  Uh, well they hate, I mean they hate us over there --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- most of those people, but obviously I think it was, in fro-, you know,
the heads of state obviously, you know --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- you know, the ones that let us in, but, uh,

A.69:  Oh well.

B.70:  It-, it-, it's , anyway, I would think, uh, yeah I think it was good that
--

A.71:  I think we did the right thing.

B.72:  -- that we got that (( )), you know, that we drew the line somewhere, and
whether that you know, the effect it has in the long run, you know, to bear on
it,

A.73:  Well, I think it deterred, I think it deterred Hussein from doing anything
else because if, for example, we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait, it
could have been just, like, you know, World War two, I mean,

B.74:  Yeah but I think,

A.75:  Hussein got a little bit of what he wanted here, he'd try it again and
got some more, he'd try again and get some more.

B.76:  Yeah, and I think, you know, it'll deter the next person from --

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  -- you know, thinking the same types of things.  But I think the problem is
that we'll never get away from the expansion idea, I mean, you know, we're a
territory in general, we're going to run into another --

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  -- huddle and then go so far and say it's a Hitler, but perhaps Saddam
seems like he's as bad as Hitler, almost, by the way he, you know, they
torture and kill people, you know, from what you read, but, um, you know, once
the nuclear power, you know nuclear bombs, uh, get in the hands of some of
these other countries, uh, for them to, you know, who knows, uh, who may,

A.81:  Yeah, because they don't have anything to lose, so they'll go ahead and use
them.

B.82:  Yeah, that's the only thing is, they, they don't understand implications, I
don't think, or may or may not but, 

A.83:  Uh-huh, but they have less to lose, if they use them, you know, it's like
they're third world countries.  They are like, their people are in bad shape.
Well, we'll go ahead and use it and put some other country in our shape.
{speaking as if for a third world country} See that's the way they think.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  So,

B.86:  Well, we'll see and you know, it has, I may,

A.87:  It'll be interesting,

B.88:  Got to be going here.

A.89:  to see how it turns out now, you know, who does what, if Hussein actually
stays in power or not.

B.90:  They keep saying they think he won't make it, but it looks like he's, you
know, taking control of all these cities that were --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- besieged by the rebels, but sounds like he's gotten control and you
know, it's just a matter if he can survive --

A.93:  Yeah.     

B.94:  -- you know, without somebody else, you know a coup attempt or something.

@@A.95:  We'll see.  Alright, well, hey, it was nice talking to you.

B.96:  Alright and take her easy.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Alright.

A.99:  Bye.

B.100:  Bye-bye.
