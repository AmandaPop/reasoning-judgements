==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you want to go first? 

B.2:  Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what
was the topic.

A.3:  Fitness and exercise.

@B.4:  Oh, God [laughter].  No, why don't you go first.

A.5:  Okay, um, I like to do, uh, weight training and, and cycling.  And just
walking, uh, swimming.  I used to do a lot of basketball and running and
volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall.  And the doctor said that
running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore, so I had to kind of
change my life-style a little bit [throat_clearing].

B.6:  Well, let me ask a ((personal)) question, how old are you?

A.7:  Thirty-eight. 

B.8:  Oh, well then you should ((see)) over thirty-five everything goes downhill
((flop)).

A.9:  Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that
just doesn't want to do everything it used to.

B.10:  Oh, you're lucky then because I've battled arthritis all my life,

A.11:  Really?  

B.12:  I mean even since I was like about two or three. 

A.13:  Oh. 

B.14:  Then they diagnosed it, and usually most people are just absolutely
crippled, and, uh, I do water aerobics.

A.15:  Oh, I bet that helps. 

B.16:  Religiously do water aerobics,

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  I used to do it about six times a week and now I'm down to about four but
it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh-, in there, uh, I tried
weight training [laughter] and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift
the things.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  And the shock on the system is, is just too much, so I have stuck to water
aerobics basically, you know, the weightless thing and,

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  trying to keep this shape that way but, you know, it's hard to find.  I
mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics
because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of
women that are, [breathing], I think they feel this is going to be an
effortless ((sweatless)) way,

A.23:  That's right.

B.24:  to get in shape,

A.25:  That's right.  

B.26:  without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd.

A.27:  That's right.

B.28:  So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. 

A.29:  Well, I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by
yourself, and you probably do.

B.30:  [Breathing] Yeah, but you have to have an indoor pool. 

A.31:  This is true. 

B.32:  So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself
without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a
strenuous workout activity (( )) you look very odd in the water,

A.33:  Well, that, 

B.34:  that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training, and
that does look very odd in the water.

A.35:  I can believe that.  Have you tried the, uh, the pool at the Spring Creek
Fitness Center?

B.36:  No, and you know, that's the only place I haven't tried and people have
told me.  Now that's the Texins facility?

A.37:  Yes. 

B.38:  I have been told that thing is just lovely. 

A.39:  It is.  They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round. 

B.40:  Huh.  He-, do you use that facility a lot? 

A.41:  Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, uh, more on the weekends, uh, I try to
beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come
down to the Dallas Fitness Center.

B.42:  Huh.  Do you know if they have child care there? 

A.43:  [Laughter] Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet?

B.44:  [Laughter]. 

A.45:  You need to put that on there, seriously. 

B.46:  They don't, I don't, I don't work at T I. 

A.47:  Oh, you don't? 

B.48:  No, I used to work at T I,

A.49:  Oh.

B.50:  as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a
management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman
that was pretty much in the industry [breathing], and I used to fill out
those attitude surveys,

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with
each other and my husband still works there,

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  and, um, I get my attitude expressed through them, but I find it to be
very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short-, (( )) mentality
to save a few bucks.

A.55:  This is true.

B.56:  [Breathing] Uh, and never having lived in Texas before I starting working
for T I and I came down here and, you know, they did an attitude survey like
six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about, you know, day care
for the shift workers,

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say
that, you know,

A.59:  Well, it's not,

B.60:  it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified. 

A.61:  Now what year are we talking about?

B.62:  We're talking nineteen seventy-eight. 

A.63:  Okay, uh, things have become much more enlightened since then.

B.64:  They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages [laughter].

A.65:  Yeah, you know, we still don't have a day care facility but people are more
sympathetic to it.

B.66:  I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative
health care,

A.67:  Yes.  Yes.  

B.68:  and, uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was
scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was.  Um, I
had been rated number one in the field and then I took, uh, when I became
pregnant I also got meningitis,

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  and then delivered the first baby three months early,

A.71:  My gosh.

B.72:  and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home, and
the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered
preventative treatment.

A.73:  Could you hold the phone for one second,

B.74:  Sure. 

A.75:  Thanks. {Pause} Okay, I'm back. 

B.76:  And then they used to, uh, and then I had a second one eighteen months
later, they told me to put them back to back and, of course, to maintain and I
was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one,

A.77:  Wow.  

B.78:  because that's when I go into labor (( )) four and a half months and I
don't even know it.

A.79:  Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your
back.

B.80:  Oh, yeah, very easy, very easy and they, they put me on twenty-four hour
fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was
going, and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said
they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor.  I think that's kind of when my
husband hit the roof,

A.81:  Really.  

B.82:  because it was a, uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill, [breathing] but
after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work,

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  and that was when they had, God it would have been the eighty-five
layoff,

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  [Breathing] and I'll tell you how they handled this and I was just
outraged, I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I
had been, uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months
later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I
said what the hell is going on here, you know.

A.87:  Yeah, really.

B.88:  And they told me that, uh, oh, well, you know, you know, your husband works
here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back
anyway, and, uh, you know, we've got people here that really, you know, need
to be working and so that we had just, you know, it was, this way we didn't
have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go.  And it took me
about a year of arguing, I said, you know, I've got to put this in writing to
me,

A.89:  Yeah.  

B.90:  and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance
benefits and I couldn't get my, uh, termination benefits either.

A.91:  There you go.

B.92:  I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. 

A.93:  I, I can believe that. 

B.94:  [Noise] But I, I guess things have gotten better, I've been told that
this flex hour and those kind of ((things)),

A.95:  Oh, yeah, flex time is great. 

B.96:  I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you
know, get me to go back, ever again [laughter].

A.97:  I, I can understand.  I can understand.  Well, it's been good talking with
you.

B.98:  But let me ask you this, since you ((use)) Texans, how much is it a month?

A.99:  Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month. 

B.100:  Now that's for individual. 

A.101:  Yeah, I mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar
or something it's no big deal.

B.102:  That's it? 

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for
classes your taking?

A.105:  Uh, you do for classes, for classes, but to, I mean to use any of the
facilities is, is no extra charge.

B.106:  God, that's cheap. 

A.107:  Yeah, it is. 

B.108:  That's really cheap.  Do you have to be an active T I employee to join
Texans or,

A.109:  Or, or a depe-, or a dependent of one.

B.110:  Or a depe-, God, I am so dependent these days. 

A.111:  Really. 

B.112:  It's ((a sense)) (( )) [laughter].  Oh, (( )) seen that my, my
((co-dependents)) have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence.

A.113:  Wonderful. 

B.114:  Yeah [laughter].  So my position for management to domestic goddess has
been an adjustment but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans.  I really
think I am,

A.115:  Yeah.  

B.116:  I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time. 

A.117:  Oh, yeah, it's great. 

B.118:  Huh.  All righty.  When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell?

A.119:  Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not, it's not excessively
crowded on the weekends.

B.120:  See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten
thirty [noise].

A.121:  Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all.  If you're in Richardson you'd
probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site.

B.122:  [Breathing] Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line. 

A.123:  Oh, well, then you could go either one, 

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties,
amenities and you'd probably like the pool there.

B.126:  Oh, God it sounds like I would.  I might do that then.  Okay, I learned
something here.

A.127:  Well, good.  I'm glad.

B.128:  You can go back to work now. 

A.129:  Well, thank you. 

B.130:  Thank you.

A.131:  You have a good day.

B.132:  Bye-bye.

A.133:  Bye-bye.
