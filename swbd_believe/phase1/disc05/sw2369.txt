=============================================================================

A.1:   How did you first get involved in camping? 

B.2:   Oh, I guess, uh, it's hard tell, I guess, probably, I didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping. 

A.3:   Yeah. 

B.4:   Uh, but, uh, later on, uh, later on I think when my oldest daughter got involved, she and I got involved in Indian Princesses. 

A.5:   Uh-huh. 

B.6:   We used to go up at Possum Kingdom, and do a lot of camping at Possum Kingdom. 

A.7:   Are you a native Texan? 

B.8:   No, I'm, I'm New England, Massachusetts. 

A.9:   Okay, I guess I grew up camping, my folks were big campers from day one, as far as I can remember. We grew up in southern Oklahoma. 

B.10:   Oh, okay. 

A.11:   And they were, uh, we were always at Texoma, some camping area, always either Texas or Oklahoma. 

B.12:   Uh-huh. 

A.13:   And I was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid, and we were camping, uh, seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere. I, when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny. My brother and sister-in-law live in Oregon and go camping, uh, a lot during the spring and summer and fall, but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine, they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull. 

B.14:   [Laughter]. 

A.15:   It has, you know, two bedrooms, a TV and microwave and stove, and all that kind of stuff, and he pulls it with a big pickup. 

B.16:   You know, that. 

A.17:   When I go camping, I usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it. 

B.18:   Yeah, that's kind of cheating isn't it? 

A.19:   Well, it's not like leaving home. 

B.20:   No. 

A.21:   When you take it with you. 

B.22:   Yeah. 

A.23:   The whole idea is to get away from it. 

B.24:   Oh, sure, speaking of, uh, southern Oklahoma, you go up into the Arbuckle Mountains at all, camping up in there? 

A.25:   I have been, and some of the boy scouts have been up in there. They have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there. 

B.26:   Yeah, we went up to, uh, talking about being an Indian Princesses, I was actually in it seven years, with two daughters one went through and then another. 

A.27:   Uh-huh. 

B.28:   And with my second daughter, we camped up at Camp Classen one time. 

A.29:   I'm not familiar with that one. 

B.30:   And, uh, well, it's right, uh, you know, I'm trying to think where it is, it's not too far over the border, 

A.31:   Yeah. 

B.32:   and it's up in the middle of the Arbuckles, and it's near Turner Falls. 

A.33:   Oh, yeah. 

B.34:   And, uh, that is just absolutely neat, you consider how flat everything is here. 

A.35:   Well, that's a fact. 

B.36:   Absolutely beautiful country to, country to camp in. 

A.37:   Yeah, a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as I was growing up. There's a place that used to be called Platte National Park, 

B.38:   Uh-huh. 

A.39:   up around Sulphur and Davis, and not too far from Turner Falls. 

B.40:   Yeah. 

A.41:   They, I have heard they since changed name of the park to something else, but it was one of those parks with a natural, uh, spring fed river that flows through the camp sites, you know, all along the river the water was real cold, 

B.42:   Yeah. 

A.43:   because it was spring fed. But just like I say, it's a beautiful area, lots of hills to go camping in. Uh, Dad never believed in tent camping, uh, we had some old army cots that we would sleep on, uh, come good weather or not many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes. 

B.44:   [Laughter]. 

A.45:   A lot of good memories in camping. You know it helps you unwind and get away, and forget about T I and everything else back home, I guess. 

B.46:   Oh, yeah, uh, another thing, how about, have you been to the Texans Texoma side? 

A.47:   No, I haven't. I've never been up there. 

B.48:   Oh, for goodness sakes, that is, that is just really nice. We kind of, you know, I've been at T I thirty-two years and in my young single days, I used to camp there a lot. Then I sort of forgot about it for twenty years, 

A.49:   Yeah. 

B.50:   and, uh, two years ago, my children started out they thought since we were Texans and we started going there again. We sort of rediscovered it. 

A.51:   Well, that's true. I've never thought, heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there. 

B.52:   They got a lot, a lot of campsites, you know, there's, uh, uh, concrete pads that you can put tents on. 

A.53:   Yeah? 

B.54:   There's places to pull in R Vs and plug them up, uh, there's even two, and what we, we used, they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically, uh, four walls and a roof, log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them. 

A.55:   Oh, yeah. 

B.56:   And a ceiling fan and screened, uh, windows. So you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag. 

A.57:   Well, that would be great. That, 

B.58:   If you have sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor, you got a roof over your head. 

A.59:   Shoot, let come what may. 

B.60:   Yeah let come what may. 

A.61:   And they're fairly close to the water aren't they When they throw right on the lake? 

B.62:   Yeah, they're very close to the water within like uh a hundred yards. 

A.63:   Have they got a place where you can uh keep your boat while you're there for the weekend? 

B.64:   Yeah Yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat? You can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's uh it's in a protected area. 

A.65:   Yeah. 

B.66:   So, and I, I've got a son. We're going to start going, he's seventeen now, he was, he was fifteen then. Uh, I've got a son, son and both daughters like to go. 

A.67:   Yeah. 

B.68:   And they have got a, a dock down in the protected area where the fishing is pretty good. 

A.69:   Oh, yeah. 

B.70:   And, uh, you know, we will leave him down there at ten o'clock with his fishing pole. And sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up [laughter]. 

A.71:   Yeah, it's time. 

B.72:   But, you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there. But it's, it's a ninety-nine acre, I think it's a ninety-nine acre, in fact they have acquired some more now, that they are going, they're going to clear, but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers. 

A.73:   That's right, I'd forgotten then all about the Texan side. and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it. 

B.74:   Yeah, yeah, you got to be a Texas member, but if you are a master member. 

A.75:   Yeah. 

B.76:   Of Texans the membership to Texoma is free. 

A.77:   Oh, that's outstanding. 

B.78:   You can get a family membership. Do your family camp at all? 

A.79:   Oh, yeah. 

B.80:   Uh, what, 

A.81:   I've got a boy that is thirteen and the girl is eleven. The boy had learned to ski, oh, probably two years ago. He's a slalom skier now. 

B.82:   Oh, boy. 

A.83:   And the girl is eleven and she just now started to learn to ski. 

B.84:   What kind of a boat do you have? 

A.85:   I've got a sixteen and a half foot Bayliner. It's inboard, outboard, just a ski boat. 

B.86:   Yeah. 

A.87:   It's about the right size for us. 

B.88:   Yeah, in my young, in my young and single days, I had a Turbocraft, are you familiar with that? 

A.89:   Yeah, I know them. 

B.90:   Yeah, I had a, a sixteen foot, hundred and nine horse power, cylinder one. 

A.91:   You bet. 

B.92:   And I had that for two or three years and then I traded it for a eighteen foot, two hundred and twenty horse power V eight. 

A.93:   Goodness. 

B.94:   And, oh that thing eat gasoline. 

A.95:   Yeah, I expect it would. 

B.96:   We could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing. 

A.97:   Yeah, but boy it would move you across the water though. 

B.98:   Yeah it will move you across the water. It would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash. 

A.99:   That's what you want. Plus out on Texoma you have got all that, you know, mass of water to get across. 

B.100:   Yeah, plus it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything. 

A.101:   Outstanding. 

B.102:   Because there was nothing under it. But unfortunately what I did was and, I, I guess, what happened when I was single I had it and my wife and I skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along, when they're real little. 

A.103:   Uh-huh. 

B.104:   They can't really participate and I guess I was paying more on insurance and maintenance than I was getting out of it. 

A.105:   You're right. 

B.106:   And I sold it and I never had a chance really to get back to boating. 

A.107:   That's what happened to us. We had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there. 

B.108:   Yeah. 

A.109:   And so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh, I'd say eleven years since we got back into boating. Now, they are big enough. 

B.110:   Yeah, you rediscover, you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it. 

A.111:   You bet, plus they can help now too. 

B.112:   Yeah. 

A.113:   They don't go along for the ride. 

B.114:   Yeah right. Where do you? 

A.115:   Well, I guess that's our five minutes now so we will. 

B.116:   Oh, okay. 

A.117:   We will call this thing to a halt. 

B.118:   Okay. 

A.119:   I appreciate talking to you Bill. 

B.120:   Okay, just let me ask you one more question. 

A.121:   Sure. 

B.122:   Where do you ski? 

A.123:   Uh, well I had only had the boat two years now. Most of the time we either go out to Lavon or we have been going up to Arkansas. Her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas, 

B.124:   Uh-huh. 

A.125:   It's a dammed up the White River, real pretty Arkansas lake, but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and stay close to home. 

B.126:   Yeah, I tell you, I would recommend too, Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there. 

A.127:   Oh, yeah. 

B.128:   And, uh, in the Texans area has two nice launching ramps. 

A.129:   Yeah. 

B.130:   One of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm. 

A.131:   Yeah. 

B.132:   It's out more in the open, uh, the other place that I would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom. 

A.133:   Well, I have heard a lot about Possum Kingdom. 

B.134:   And that is absolutely the prettiest that, when I learned to slalom ski, it was the only place I didn't mind swallowing and boy I swallowed a lot of water learning. 

A.135:   Oh, yeah. 

B.136:   And the only place I didn't mind swallowing half the lake and I didn't feel grungy about it like I did at Lavon. 

A.137:   It's not over crowded? 

B.138:   No, it's not over crowded it's far enough away that it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm. 

A.139:   See that's one of my biggest gripes about Texoma, as many times as we would go up there, it's so rough. 

B.140:   Yeah and, there's, uh, they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom. 

A.141:   That sounds. 

B.142:   And you just get up and ski adjacent to those and, uh, and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is. 

A.143:   Oh, no. 

B.144:   You don't notice it. 

A.145:   Well, that sounds like a good place to start out this spring. I'm looking forward to it. 

B.146:   Okay well you ready to wind up? 

A.147:   All right. Thanks a lot, nice talking to you. 

B.148:   Well, nice talking to you my friend. 

A.149:   Good night. 

B.150:   Yeah, good night. Bye-bye.
