REMARKS:  	There as some dropout throughout conversation.  There was
noise throughout conversation on both parties.  Noises sounded very much like 
television or stereo.

=============================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] {like television}.  Well, who's the team? 

B.2:  Well, I think, uh, N C A A is going to go to Kansas. 

A.3:  Oh, really?  Well, I, I'm picking Duke because, uh, they just won
it. 

B.4:  They just won it. 

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Holy cow, I just walked in.  I, I didn't, [noise] even I guess, uh,

A.7:  #It's just,#

B.8:  #I can't believe it's over.# 

A.9:  Yeah, it's just over.  Just, uh, about f-, ten minutes ago, I
guess. 

B.10:  What was the score? 

A.11:  It was a good game, uh, they won by about eight, I think.  Either five or
eight. It was a good game but, uh, Duke was just too much for him.  Kansas
just couldn't, #couldn't hang with them.#

B.12:  #Well, I suppose they must be,# they must be pretty good if they took on
U N L V so,

A.13:  Oh, yeah.  And see I was, I was really thinking that they might have a let
down because I, I was in a basketball park and I picked, uh, Kansas for I
guess more or less an upset, but I, I was thinking that, uh, Duke might have a
let down after playing such a tough game with U N L V, but, uh, I tell you
what, they, uh, they came back and put it to them.  It was a good game, but I,
I thought all the way through that U N L V was going to be the team that would
just walk away with it.

B.14:  Well, you and everybody else. 

A.15:  That's right [laughter].  That's right.  I tell you what.  They, uh,
they, they looked like they were just men among boys.  But, they, they fell, I
tell you.

B.16:  Well, a lot of pressure on them, though, I think, uh, I don't think they
had the same type of enthusiasm,

A.17:  [Noise].

B.18:  or attitude, probably too conservative or too,

A.19:  Yeah, yeah.  They, they just need to go for it instead of, uh, worrying
about the other team.

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  Because I think if they would play their game I don't know if there's
anybody that could, that could keep up with them. 

B.22:  Yeah.  Well, what,

A.23:  But,

B.24:  about professionally?

A.25:  Uh, I, I was since the,

B.26:  I'm out in the, uh, Phoenix, (( )) so the Suns are starting to look
pretty descent, but,

A.27:  Yeah.  That's right. 

B.28:  I think, yeah. 

A.29:  Yeah, here in Dallas, I'll tell you what, the, the Mavericks are having
just all kinds of problems.

B.30:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.31:  I tell you. 

B.32:  I used to live out there and, uh,

A.33:  Oh, really. 

B.34:  seems like they, well, Tarpley just got pulled over again [laughter].

A.35:  Yeah, so he's, he's, uh, he's probably going to be going to jail and, and
the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so
whether he plays or not they have got to pay him ten million dollars.  So if
they, uh, they can't hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much
for him and if they, just keep him that hurts their salary cap.  So that guy's
got Dallas in a big old bind. But uh, they, they, I think they have just got
to forget about him.  And, uh, try to build a team without him.  Maybe go for
some good, they ought to get some good draft #picks this year.#

B.36:  #Who, who else# do they got on the team now?  I haven't, 

A.37:  They have, uh, 

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  they have got Derek Harper, that's a real good point guard, him and
Rolando Blackman, and, uh, really they're about it.  They've got a guy named
Herb Williams that, that I guess sort of was supposed to take the place of,
uh, Tarpley, but he, uh, he just doesn't have the offensive skills.

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  And then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing
center.

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  And, uh, 

B.44:  How's he doing this year?  

A.45:  Just all right but he's getting to where, uh, I don't know if it's
his age or what, but he just can't play the whole game.  They've got to
get somebody young that can run the court that's still big. 

B.46:  How about the guy from North Carolina? 

A.47:  Oh, uh, not McCrane, but, uh, let's see are you, uh, Perkins? 

B.48:  Perkins. Perkins.

A.49:  They traded Perkins, Sam Perkins, they traded him [noise].  He was
from North Carolina,

B.50:  That's right.  That's right. 

A.51:  and uh, they traded him to the Lakers last year.  And that,
he was a good player.  And then, they, they got a,

B.52:  He is a finesse player. 

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  He was good. 

A.55:  And then they, they, uh, last year went out and got oh, Fat Leever and, uh,
Alex English and Rodney,

B.56:  #Dantely.#

A.57:  #McCrane.#

B.58:  Didn't they get Dantely?

A.59:  Yeah.  They didn't.  And I'm not for sure what the deal is on him.  I think
he's been hurt.  But he hadn't, he hadn't played in probably two months.  And,
uh, uh, I've gone to about three or four of their games and I don't even think
he was on the sidelines.  So, I, I think he hurt his knee or something.  But
he, he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to.  So,
uh,

B.60:  I think that was involved with the Perkins trade to tell you the truth.

A.61:  It, uh, you know, #I bet it was.#

B.62:  #No, no, no, no, no,# no  it, was what is his name, McGuire.  That was
McGuire,

A.63:  That's right, that's right. 

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  From, uh, uh, Detroit.  That's right. 

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  That's who that was.  Yeah, because I don't think they got anything from
Perkins.  I think he was a free agent or, uh, yeah, free agent.  His contract
ended and they didn't sign him.  And, uh,

B.68:  I don't understand that, I thought that he was always a good player.

A.69:  You know, he was but he just went for the, the big bucks.  I think Dallas
was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something
like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles.  So he just went where the
bucks were.  And shoot, you can't blame him, man that's, that's a phenomenal
amount of money.  But, uh, yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up, I tell you.

B.70:  Are they over five hundred? 

A.71:  Uh, no, I don't think so, they, they were right before the, uh, uh, oh,
what do you call it, Allstar Break, but ever since the Allstar Break, uh,
shoot, they've played terrible.

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  And, uh, so now it would be really to their benefit to, uh, really play,
uh, some bad ball and hopefully get a lucky, uh, lottery pick.  Because, uh,
there is no way they can even, I think mathematically they're out of the
playoff scene, now.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  So, you know, they, they just need to just play for a playoff pick.  Or
a,

B.76:  I think the Suns are,

A.77:  You know, the Suns are pretty good.

B.78:  Yes. 

A.79:  They're, uh, 

B.80:  Well, they're, I don't think it was last year.  The year before they were
doing really  good.  And, I think they had an off year last year. 

A.81:  Yeah.  And they d-, they made some trades, uh, oh, they had one white
guy, I can't think of his name that was real good. 

B.82:  Did you say white or black?

A.83:  White. 

B.84:  Chambers?

A.85:  Uh, Chambers.

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  Yeah.  And, uh,

B.88:  He's the big guy here. 

A.89:  You know, if, if they could get somebody to help compliment him, you
know, I think they'd be, uh, awesome.  Because that guy can play.  That
Chambers is, is something else.  But, uh, I don't know, it will, it will be
interesting.

B.90:  I haven't been, I don't follow basketball real close but, 

A.91:  I, I really, don't follow the pros that close either, they, they just play
so many games that, uh, you know, it's just hard to keep up with them.  But
college, I really enjoy col-, basketball [noise] #the most.#

B.92:  #Yeah.  The Big Ten didn't# fair too well in the tournament. 

A.93:  No, they sure didn't.  Sure didn't. 

B.94:  I'm, I'm from the mid-, midwest so. 

A.95:  Oh, okay so you keep up with the, uh,

B.96:  Yeah I kind of watch, you know, see what's happening.  But, uh,  

A.97:  Yeah [typewriter].  More of a football powerhouse I guess. 

B.98:  What's that?

A.99:  More of a football powerhouse up there I guess. 

B.100:  Well, no, basketball is,

A.101:  Is basketball pretty big?

B.102:  you know, Michigan won it last year. 

A.103:  Do what? 

B.104:  Yeah, Indiana and Michigan, uh, and, uh, Iowa and Ohio State.  Ohio State
was ranked like number two most of the year.

A.105:  Tha-, that's true.  That is right [/typewriter]. 

B.106:  Michigan won the N C A A last year.  And you know, there's also about six
teams that go to the tournaments, uh, from the Big Ten, it's, it's,

A.107:  Yeah, so it's a tough conference, huh.

B.108:  They are really good in all the sports.  They (( )) actually in
the last few years, um, football you know, looks like it has gone down a
little bit so,

A.109:  Yeah.  Because Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse,

B.110:  And, uh,

A.111:  but, uh, and Michigan too.  But, uh, well, I tell you what I appreciate,
uh, the conversation and, uh, we'll have to, we'll have to see how Phoenix
ends up.

B.112:  Yeah.  We'll see [laughter]. 

A.113:  [Laughter]. 

B.114:  Alrighty.  Well, have a good one. 

A.115:  You, too.  Bye-bye. 

B.116:  Okay. Bye-bye [/noise].
