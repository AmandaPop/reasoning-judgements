@A.1:  So, what kind of camping do you like? 

B.2:  Well, we, uh, as a little girl, I used to go camping with my family.  And,
uh, we'd load up our car and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff, and
the place that we went the most often was, uh, in Oklahoma, it's about a two
or three hour drive and, it is a little bitty national park right in the,
right in a town called Sulphur, Oklahoma, and it was real pretty, had lots of
trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun.

A.3:  So, you like that more civilized kind of camping (( )) [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] Yeah, probably so. 

A.5:  Yeah, well I'm, I'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper,

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  I'll, uh, whatever I can carry on a backpack,

B.8:  Oh.  

A.9:  is, is what I go with. 

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  Um, when I was in the Air Force I used to be up in South Dakota,

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go
camping,

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  and I had this really nice place, you had to, uh, drive in as far as I
could and then park, and then you had to walk in the rest of the way.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  But it was across a little stream and it was sort of, um, uh, not a big
area, but there was a perfectly round stand of trees,

B.18:  [Noise] {background} Uh-huh.  

A.19:  and it had a nice little area inside that, course it gave you shelter and
everything,

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  and it was right next to a nice cold stream,

B.22:  Huh.  

A.23:  so it was my favorite place,

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the
weather starts getting funny, it will be warm one day and freezing the next.

B.26:  Yeah. 

A.27:  So, but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever.

B.28:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.29:  Well, I had cabin fever really bad so, I loaded up the car and took off,
and I got up there and got camped or got, got my camp setup,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing.

B.32:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  [Noise] Did you have, uh, very warm sleeping bag or,

A.35:  Oh, I had, I had a nice sleeping bag, I also had, uh, uh, catalytic heater.

B.36:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.37:  Um, but I woke up and the snow was halfway up the, the front of the tent.

B.38:  [Laughter]. 

A.39:  I'm going oh, no. 

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  I go out, I had all my stuff ((so)), I had my little campfire thing setup
and my pots and pans and stove,

B.42:  Oh, yeah.  

A.43:  and all that.  And I get, everything's buried under snow, so I'm out
there digging around so I think, well, to hell with it, you know, I'll go,
I'll go play around for a while.

B.44:  [Laughter]. 

A.45:  Well there's this fallen tree across the stream,

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  and these streams, of course, are fel-, fed by melted snow so they're
cold anyway.

B.48:  Yeah, oh, yeah. 

A.49:  So, here I am going across this snow encrusted log,

B.50:  Oh, no.  

A.51:  and I slipped and fell in.

B.52:  Oh, no. 

A.53:  And crashed through the ice,

B.54:  Oh.  

A.55:  right up to my neck,

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  in freezing cold weather, I could just feel my heart going cr-,

B.58:  Oh no.  

A.59:  Uh,

B.60:  How did you get out of that? 

A.61:  Well, fortunately I had the presence of mind when I slipped, I just, I just
went with it.  I didn't try to twist or anything.

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  And as I went, I just turned and stuck my arms out and I hit the,

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  hit the log with my arms and that pretty much saved me from going all the
way under.

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  Um, anyway,

B.68:  Oh, man.  

A.69:  I finally pulled myself out and, I mean, just as soon as I got out my
clothes started freezing.

B.70:  Oh, that's awful. 

A.71:  Yeah, so I, I trotted back to the car rather quickly, uh, jumped in, went
home, and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back [laughter].

B.72:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].  Oh, that's quite an experience.

A.73:  It was.

B.74:  I probably would have had a heart attack and died right there on the spot.

A.75:  I think I almost did. 

B.76:  Oh that,

A.77:  [Throat_clearing] That was something. 

B.78:  I bet. 

A.79:  Yeah, I, I enjoy camping.  I like getting out.  Especially, I don't,

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  I don't understand these peop-, people take these camper trailers,

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  and stuff.  I mean that's, that's not camping. 

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  I mean that's like,

B.86:  That's just like moving to another area for a while [laughter].

A.87:  Yeah.  I mean, here you are you got, you know, you got showers,

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  and stoves and refrigerators and T V's and air conditioning,

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  I mean good grief that's not camping. 

B.92:  I know, it's kind of funny. 

A.93:  I like to rough it. 

B.94:  Yeah, well, did you go camping by yourself then you didn't go with other
people or, 

A.95:  No, usually I went by myself,

B.96:  Huh.  

A.97:  it was sort of get away from everybody time,

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  and you've been locked up with folks all winter, it's time,

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  to get away by yourself.

B.102:  Yeah {very faint}.  

A.103:  And it was so, it was so nice up there that, just, I mean it was so,
quiet and peaceful.

B.104:  Yeah, well, that's nice [baby_talking]. 

A.105:  Yeah, it's nice, nice area. 

B.106:  Yeah, just a second.  {Speaks to her daughter in the background}.
[whispering], Tara would you hold on just a moment, please [/whispering].
{Resumes talking to speaker} Uh, when I, uh, planned my little, uh, schedule
of when I could talk on the phone, this one was suppose to be asleep
[laughter].

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  And she's not cooperating [laughter]. 

A.109:  Yeah, she fooled you. 

B.110:  Yeah.  I think so. 

A.111:  Uh, I've got three kitty cats and they,

B.112:  Oh.  

A.113:  were suppose to be taking a nap, and one just crawled up in my lap,

B.114:  [Laughter].  

A.115:  and every time she hears me on the phone, she's got to come sit in my
lap.

B.116:  Yeah, wants you to,

A.117:  Got to be, got to be part of the action here. 

B.118:  [Laughter] My kids want a cat so bad, and, uh, I'd, I'd like to get them
one but we live close to a busy street, and almost everyone has a cat, it's
been hit, run over,

A.119:  Oh.  

B.120:  maimed, you know, and I just can't stand the thought of it. 

A.121:  Yeah.  All,

B.122:  So, 

A.123:  all mine are, uh, purebreds so I keep them in. 

B.124:  Yeah, keep them in the house. 

A.125:  Yeah {very faint}. 

B.126:  Well, that may be our only option,

A.127:  Especially, 

B.128: if we ever get one.  

A.129:  especially, especially this one. 

B.130:  Huh. 

A.131:  She's a mess. 

B.132:  Huh. 

A.133:  {Talks to the cat} Aren't you kitty cat? 

B.134:  Well, this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because I
really thought this was, uh, uh, we're,

A.135:  Sort of like T I ((exclusive)). 

B.136:  Yeah, T I people.  Yeah, and so I just figured, no, it's just this area,
you know.

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  Well, that's interesting. 

A.139:  Have you had many calls? 

B.140:  Well, you're my third one and I have never gotten the courage to do it
myself, isn't that funny?  [laughter].

A.141:  Well, I tell you, it's, it's easy to do it's just, uh, like when I started
calling you,

B.142:  Uh-huh.  

A.143:  it was two twenty my time, one twenty your time, I guess. 

B.144:  Uh-huh. 

A.145:  And however long it took, however long we've been on, that's how long it
took for some,

B.146:  For it, 

A.147:  for the computer to find somebody. 

B.148:  Oh, my. 

A.149:  Yeah, I've been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here.

B.150:  Oh, I never thought about that, that it would take a long time to find
someone available.

A.151:  I didn't think it would take as long as it does, but like last night when I
made one,

B.152:  Uh-huh.  

A.153:  the lon-, that was the longest one, I waited thirty-five minutes.

B.154:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.155:  And sometimes you'll get it on the first try, I mean, it's just,

B.156:  Yeah, I guess it depends on the time of day, too.

A.157:  Yeah, this is not a real good time of day because most people listed their
home numbers, and,

B.158:  Yeah.  

A.159:  of course, they're gone. 

B.160:  Yeah. 

A.161:  But, I've got a class tonight so I wanted to get these out of the way.

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  This is, this is my thirtieth call. 

B.164:  Oh, wow. 

A.165:  Yeah. 

B.166:  That's great.  Well, I got a catalog that, you know, shows all the gifts
and things you can get and,

A.167:  Uh-huh.  

B.168:  I started getting inspired thinking, oh, we need to do this, I'd like ((
)) those things [laughter].

A.169:  Yeah, the only reason I'd do it is because I want to make sure that I get
all my calls in before they, they just up and pull the plug on the program,
you know.

B.170:  Yeah, that's right.  And they probably will soon so,  

A.171:  Yeah, because being a student I'm doing it for the money. 

B.172:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can see that. 

A.173:  I want to make sure I'm, I'm, my roommate does it, too. 

B.174:  Huh.  Well, that's pretty neat. 

A.175:  Yeah. 

B.176:  Well,

A.177:  (( )) nice little bit of money.  We're going to,

B.178:  Yeah, yeah, every time I've talked to them, (( )) my husband said I can't
believe that you made five dollars every time you do that, [laughter], it
sounds easy.

A.179:  [Laughter]. 

B.180:  [Laughter] So, he signed up to do it but he's never done one, so.

A.181:  Well, of course, 

B.182:  I know.

A.183:  there's this other one that, I've, I've talked to fairly regularly in
Dallas, um, same thing.  Her husband signed up for it and she's the one that
does it.

B.184:  Yeah.  I know, it's crazy [laughter]. 

A.185:  [Laughter] But he'll spend the money I bet. 

B.186:  That's right, yeah, he'll say, yeah, I did that. 

A.187:  Yeah, we're going to take the money and get, uh, go out and find a nice
stud for ((Himy)) Persian.

B.188:  Oh. 

A.189:  Yeah, she's a, she's a beauty, we're going to, going to get a nice litter
off of her.

B.190:  Well, that will be neat. 

A.191:  Yeah, she's, she's so sweet, too. 

B.192:  Oh, I tell you my kids would love to, they'd just want any kind of a cat,
bless their hearts.  And like I said, um, I really would like to have one,
too, because I know how much they want one.  It's just hard, one, my youngest
daughter has asthma, and, uh, been a little afraid to have a cat in the house
all the time with a child that has asthma.

A.193:  Yeah. 

B.194:  So, I thought well, I need an outdoor cat, but if I have an outdoor cat,
I'm afraid it's going to get hurt,

A.195:  Uh-huh.  

B.196:  so, I have a problem [laughter]. 

A.197:  Yeah, that's, that's bit (( )) I mean, you could always buy a, uh, you
could always buy a ((Sphinx)),

B.198:  Yeah.  

A.199:  those are hairless cats.  Of course they're, 

B.200:  Huh.  I don't think they'd be too fun.

A.201:  Oh, they are.  They're, they're loads of fun. 

B.202:  Are they? 

A.203:  That's the most playful cat around. 

B.204:  Huh. 

A.205:  But they, on the other hand, too, they cost twenty-five hundred dollars
[laughter].

B.206:  Oh, my land.  I'd be scared to dead to have anything that expensive
[laughter].

A.207:  Yeah, my, my roomy wants to buy a, a Sphinx,

B.208:  Huh.  

A.209:  and I keep saying no, no, no,

B.210:  Oh, I've never heard of that.

A.211:  no. 

B.212:  Yeah. 

A.213:  We both decided on a ((Devonrex)), though.  It's sort of like a Sphinx,
it's a very short haired cat,

B.214:  Huh.  

A.215:  it's almost like just fuzz.

B.216:  Huh. 

A.217:  But, uh, they're substantially cheaper. 

B.218:  Yeah, I would hope so. 

A.219:  We're, we're into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he,

B.220:  Well, that's good. 

A.221:  Yeah, as long as you don't lose sight that they're still kitty cats.

B.222:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.223:  And they're fun to have around. 

B.224:  Yeah, I guess so. 

A.225:  This one here is just sweet. 

B.226:  Oh, that's neat. 

A.227:  She's kneading on my, my stomach. 

B.228:  [Laughter].  

A.229:  pushing and pushing and drooling. 

B.230:  [Laughter]. 

A.231:  {Talks to the cat} Quit drooling on me, look at this I'm wet.

B.232:  [Laughter] Well, it was nice talking to you.  I think I'm going to have
to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy.

A.233:  Oh. 

B.234:  When I'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do.

A.235:  That's it.  All right, it was good talking to you.

B.236:  Yeah, you, too. 

A.237:  Talk to you later ((Janet)). 

B.238:  Okay, thanks, good-bye. 

A.239:  Bye, bye.
