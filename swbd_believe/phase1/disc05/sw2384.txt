============================================================================

@A.1:  Yeah, auto repair tends to be a, a topic that a lot of people don't, uh,
don't like, I guess, because it's usually expensive, and, uh, people end up
[inhaling] not pleased with the job sometimes, or not pleased with what they
had to pay for it --

B.2:  That's right.

A.3:  -- so, uh, I guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic.  I just recently
had, um, put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have, and fortunately
I, I could do most of the work myself, but, uh, this last time that I got into
it, I got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad, I, kind of
fluish type, and said, What a time for this to set in,

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  I've got the wheel off, I've got these brake pads off, and the car
jacked up, and need the car the next day type deal, so --

B.6:  Get sick with the flu [laughter].

A.7:  -- yeah, so, uh, I continued on and just decided to do part of what I had
intended to do when I got inside there, which means that when I just get
around to doing the rest of it I got to take all of that back off again and,
and, uh --

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  -- start over, so, with little things like that, it's, it's still a lot
cheaper.  That particular for that particular model car runs a hundred and
fifty dollars.

B.10:  Wow.  Are these disc brakes?

A.11:  Yeah, just the front little disc pads, but, uh, while you're in there
usually you pull the rotor and, and, uh, turn it down --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- and, and put the, uh, grease the bearings up since it's been a while
since they'd been done and,

B.14:  Well, I have Nissan, uh, Maxima --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and I had the rear brakes on those redone --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- but I guess auto repairs are cheaper around here.  I think it was around
eighty-five dollars.

A.19:  Yeah, the rear brakes, just doing the, just putting the brake pads in
wouldn't be too expensive --

B.20:  Is expensive, uh-huh.

A.21:  -- but it's when, while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and
pull those, the rotor off and repack the bearings and --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- you know, that's twenty-five dollars and the rotors another twenty-five
dollars,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  and then the brake pads are eighty or something, the labor and parts,
and I just go buy the things for, for, uh, about thirty bucks and put them on
myself --

B.26:  Uh-huh

A.27:  -- [inhaling] but, uh --

B.28:  You're very fortunate.

A.29:  -- it's a bit of a, bit of a pain, and you have to schedule it, you know,
get around to find a weekend you can do it and all, but still, for the, for
the savings it, uh, works out usually.

B.30:  Well, I ran into a problem with my car, uh, course we have a little colder
weather up here, and I had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing
rain apparently --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and there's some kind of a boot that had come off the car, so the
emergency brake froze on --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and my, uh, brakes were on all the time I drove to work one morning --

A.35:  Oh, boy, bet they got warm,

B.36:  -- It got warm, it was pretty smelly by the time we got there, which is not
too far a drive, but --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- that, that was the reason I had to replace mine,

A.39:  Yeah, that'll do it, it'll cook the whole, whole insides there.

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  Um, I don't know what the, what the solution for that would have been.  You
would have thought that they'd have put all those parts that were pertaining
to that near the brake so that if they did get hot they'd unfreeze [laughter].

B.42:  Right.  You would hope so, but [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah, it'd be nice if, uh, all that was, huh, that's interesting.  Yeah,
I'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here.  I've heard a lot of
horror stories about people that go down a straight road long enough, and the
wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get --

B.44:  That you can't turn,

A.45:  -- ready to make a turn, and, and, surprise, you can't turn --

B.46:  That's right.

A.47:  -- and you can't stop in a hurry, and, no, I'll stay down here in the 
South,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  it's, it's a little bit different.

B.50:  I've seen your spaghetti bridges though, when I wouldn't want to go over
them [laughter].

A.51:  Yeah, that's true, that's true, well I guess the only other, uh, things
that I like to do, you know, the oil changes and things that are not worth
paying for, at least in my neck of the woods, uh, we do that kind of
maintenance, and --

B.52:  You do that yourself?

A.53:  -- yeah, do the oil chan-, oil and filter and air filters and spark plugs
and the like.

B.54:  Oh, you're,

A.55:  Can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car, now that
computers taken over that control --

B.56:  That's right.

A.57:  -- um, it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that
reads that and,

B.58:  I've thought about taking a course, just so I could change my own oil --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- but, and that would help a little bit, but I haven't done it,

A.61:  Well, I'll tell you some of the horror stories that the male populace have
done to the women.  I, I recall a co-ed when I was in college.  Some of the
guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil
was to, uh, they showed her where to take it out, and she did that
successfully, and then showed her how to put it back in, but on putting it
back in they had her put in, they had her put in all four or five quarts of
this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick --

B.62:  Oh, no.

A.63:  -- and, she did it --

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  -- oh, and it was just --

B.66:  That's crazy,

A.67:  -- that was mean.

B.68:  That is mean [throat_clearing].

A.69:  Yeah, so I guess it, it is to your advantage to either not have friends
like that or,

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  take a little course.

B.72:  Or take it to the pit and let them --

A.73:  Yeah,

B.74:  -- let somebody else do it,

A.75:  Yeah, those have really cropped up, years of late, but, uh,

B.76:  They have, but I really hate paying twenty-two ninety-five for an oil
change --

A.77:  Yeah, yeah, that's,

B.78:  -- when I know what the oil costs [laughter].

A.79:  It's true, I usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so --

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  -- and, and, uh, stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars
filters when they're on sale --

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  -- and wait for a good weather, and go out there, course getting rid of the
oil is getting harder these days --

B.84:  Well --

A.85:  -- end up having to take it somewhere,

B.86:  -- right.  Some of the stations around here will take it.  

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  I think --

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  -- maybe they have to accept it.

A.91:  Well, they get a little money for it, I mean, they, they pay, they sell 
it --

B.92:  Recycle it,

A.93:  -- so, they should be, you know, unless it's a hassle or a labor in, you
know, just dealing with the customer, maybe that's there only reason why they
don't, it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it
pour here, and go on [laughter].

B.94:  That's right, 

A.95:  We'll take your money,

B.96:  Uh, we were down in Dallas right after Christmas, and on the way back we
stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother, and we were driving my husband's
Toyota pick up truck.  Well, we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton
Rouge, and he came back out, and the car, the truck wouldn't stop, I mean, it
wouldn't start.  So gave it a, somebody came along and helped give it a little
push, and the next morning, they took it to the garage, and [throat_clearing]
it was just a small private garage, and he said it was the starter motor
probably, and he was going to take it off, and either repair it or replace it,
or whatever, and we got a call in the middle of the morning, and he said, I've
got good news and bad news [throat_clearing].  Uh, the starter motor is fine,
it woul-, it just had a couple of bolts that held it in place --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- and one had been broken off --

A.99:  Right,

B.100:  -- and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't --

A.101:  Uh-huh, wouldn't catch,

B.102:  -- match just right --

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  -- and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and
pick them up, pick the bolts up for him [laughter] --

A.105:  Um.

B.106:  -- so he went to a used car garage, I guess, or place --

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  -- and got the bolts, and had it running for about fifteen dollars --

A.109:  Well, that's not,

B.110:  -- I couldn't believe it, because the man could have really stuck us.

A.111:  Yeah, that's true.  That's not too bad then.  

B.112:  No, it was great.

A.113:  Well, I hear my kids are needing me again, so I'll go see what they need.

B.114:  Okay, Greg.

A.115:  Well, maybe talk to you again.

B.116:  Okay, thank you.

A.117:  Bye.

B.118:  Bye.
