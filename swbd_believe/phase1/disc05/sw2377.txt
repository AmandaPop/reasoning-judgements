=====================================================================

A.1:  Well, I'm, uh, an engineer so I'm heartedly in favor of this country
converting to metric.

B.2:  I bet you are.  I bet you are.  I don't know, you know, when I was in, uh,
when I was in high school several years ago, you know, we did probably, two,
two or three weeks on the subject, you know, and tried to teach you the whole
thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really
don't care anyway and I didn't get into it very much, but then I took a, just
a basic math class a couple of semesters ago, and we, uh, we were pretty
heavily into the metric system and, and before we started I just thought oh,
no, I don't want to do this, you know, this is just going to be so hard and
once I really realized how easy it was,

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  uh, it was wonderful.  I mean, it was just incredible how much simpler it
is than what, you know, I guess we just all have this mind set that oh, this
is so hard and we can't do this.  And it's really not hard I was surprised at
how very easy it was.  I think most people just, uh, you know, automatically
have their minds set against it and don't give it a chance,

A.5:  #Yeah.#

B.6:  #you know,# so,

A.7:  Well, I think, uh, you know, from an elementary standpoint it would help to
get rid of some of the, the oddball conversion units like,

B.8:  Oh, sure. 

A.9:  twelve inches to the foot and, 

B.10:  #Exactly.#

A.11:  #thirty-six# inches, [laughter]

B.12:  #Exactly.#

A.13:  #to the yard# and things like that.  But, uh,

B.14:  [Noise].

A.15:  I think, uh, from my work experience I found, well, wh-, in college I
learned, uh, to use a rationalized system of measure.

B.16:  Uh. 

A.17:  which turned out to be the metric system ...

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  And an awful lot of the problems that we did on exams and our homework
assignments and everything else involved (( )) converting --

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  -- from, uh, english units or nonstandard units into this, uh,
rationalized M K F system.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And, uh, so I became quite accustomed to, uh, to a rationalized system and,
and used to making all the necessary conversions.

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  And since then I have discovered, uh, other engineers are very prone to
make mistakes because they will pick up a textbook and, uh, and find some
formula for solving a problem,

B.26:  [Lipsmack].  Yeah, #uh-huh.# 

A.27:  #and# they fail to realize,

B.28:  [Throat_clearing].

A.29:  that the formula is expressed in the, the rationalized M K F system,

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  and they'll proceed to plug in inches and feet and pounds,

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  and, uh, [laughter] things like that,

B.34:  It just don't work [laughter].

A.35:  and they come up with a funniest answers you ever, you can imagine.

B.36:  I bet, I bet. 

A.37:  And some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so, uh, you
know, a lot of energy and, uh, a lot of work and so forth, uh, goes into
building something only to discover it doesn't work [laughter].

B.38:  Right, right.  Well, you know I think that the, that the only way that we
are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start
other with, with the kids right now.

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  #You know,# you, you, you're going to have to start with the kids who are
in scho-, that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well.
Not like I was in school and do two weeks on it, in a math class and that's
all you ever hear about it, you know.  They're going to have to start with the
little ones and teach it right now and then when, you know, those little ones
are our age, you know, that's what they're going to know and that's what
they're going to use.  There's no way you're going to get, you know, most of
the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch,

A.41:  #Yeah.# 

B.42:  #you know,# it's just not going to happen that way.  But, I do think if
they would start with the kids now, at, you know, in, you know, twenty years
from now we could be switched over, #you know.#

A.43:  #Yeah,# I kind of agree that, uh, maybe ten on or twenty years ago we
should have gone into a, uh, sort of a dual display,

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  arrangement where, you know, our, our speed limit signs were, were sort
of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour,

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  type, uh, marking on the side.

B.48:  #Yeah, I agree.# 

A.49:  #and then# over the years the, the kilometers per hour gets bigger than
the miles per hour [laughter],

B.50:  Yeah. 

A.51:  and eventually disappears. 

B.52:  Very good idea, yeah, #yeah.# 

A.53:  #Uh,# and, little things like that.  I, I notice in a lot of, uh, uh,
technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will
find the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way
around the metric units are expressed first and then the english equivalent,

B.54:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.55:  #that's, uh,# is put into parenthesis,

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  for reference.

B.58:  Yeah, I think, I think it's going to take that but I, you know, I, I think
it's going to take a lot more than that too, you know, it's going to take,
it's going to take this education with o-, with our kids I really believe that
but, you know, yo-, we, we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it
again.  We knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class
so why take the time to really learn it.  You know, I mean, you would, you
know, learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because
you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of
school, you know, and, and that, that's not the way to convert over, you're
going to have these kids teaching it dually even, you know, teaching both
systems which is a lot, I know, a lot more for the teachers to have to teach
but that's the only way they're going to get switched over, #you know,#

A.59:  #Yeah.#  I think also equally important is that, uh, it needs to be put
into practice in, #in,#

B.60:  #Oh#, #yes,#

A.61:  #everyday# life.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  We're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and
you discover your english wrenches don't fit,

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  Yeah.  That's true too.  #That's true.#

A.67:  #You've# got to go out and buy a metric #set.#

B.68:  #Buy a# whole knew metric set, yeah.  Well, I think, you know it's
something that's going to take quite some time to happen but I, I still don't
think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen, you
know, it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to
be a lot more education involved than there is right now,

A.69:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.70:  #to get# it to, to get it to switch over. 

A.71:  I was a little disappointed that, uh, United States is lagging the rest of
the world #but,#

B.72:  #Oh,# yeah.

A.73:  all of the other countries in the world have made the change,

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  and even the British, which are probably the most stodgy, 

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  population and the originator of our english system of measure, uh, they
have gone metric.

B.78:  Even they have switched.

A.79:  #Yeah.#

B.80:  #Yeah,# so.  Yeah, we're not, uh, we're not necessarily cutting edge in
everything are we, [laughter]

A.81:  Right. 

B.82:  just like we think we are.  So, well I think eventually it will happen,
you know, it's just going to take, it's just going to take a lot of education
and a lot of time and like I said, I was just totally amazed at how, at how
very easy it was,

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  you know I, I just couldn't, you know, I just, when I going into it I
just had this block and I went there's just no way I'm going to be able to
learn this and when I sat down and really said okay just, you know, forget
your old prejudices and really look at it, you know, and once you look at it's
so really simple, you know, you, there's really nothing to memorize, there's
nothing to learn it just all works the same, you know, you just, you know,
transform that little, you know, dot,

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  from one place, one way to the other, you know, and that's about all you
have to do, so.  Anyway,

A.87:  #I,# 

B.88:  #I# think it will happen eventually. 

A.89:  I think one of the other concepts that, uh, comes along with using a
rationalized system of measure is, uh,

B.90:  [Talking].

A.91:  a technique of keeping track of units.

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  When you're solving a problem that if you're sitting there trying to, uh,
establish a relationship with some physical system, uh, when you come up with
your final formula if you analyze the units of measure they should come out
right.

B.94:  Uh-huh. 

A.95:  And the, the basic units of measure are, are distance and time and mass and
electric charge.

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  And so if you convert all your measure into those, uh, fundamental units
and analyze them you can, uh, get a pretty good sense as to whether your
formula is correct.

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  Maybe you left out a factor of pi or something like that but, [laughter].

B.100:  Right, right.  {Pause}.  Well, you know, I think, uh, I think it's going to
happen.  I don't know, I don't know what else I could suggest to them, you
know, if they ask me what should we do. I don't know, I wouldn't know what
else to suggest to them, just education.  Start with these little kids, you
know, and like you said, you know, start making it practice, you know, start
showing all the street signs, and all the ca-, of course I think all the cars
are manufactured that way, they, aren't, they aren't all of them, most of the
new ones I'm seeing,

A.101:  #Well, I,#

B.102:  #are, are# made with miles per hour and kilometers on #them.#

A.103:  #most# of them have, uh, the option.

B.104:  Oh, really. 

A.105:  The American, American made cars have, uh, the, the miles per hour as the
big scale and they're little tick marks,

B.106:  Right. 

A.107:  Uh, sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers,

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  per hour.  But those that are manufactured for sale in, in Europe, and so
forth, are quite the other way around.

B.110:  Right. 

A.111:  And in a lot of the Japanese cars that come to this country particularly
those that have the, uh, electronic panels there's a little push button some
place on the panel that you can switch between, uh, kilometers per hour and
miles per hour.

B.112:  Is there really, huh. 

A.113:  My wife's, uh, Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose
what display you want to see.

B.114:  Well, that's interesting, yeah.  #Well,# 

A.115:  #Yeah, I noticed# my van has a, uh, a button on the temperature gauge that
you can switch between centigrade and fahrenheit.

B.116:  Oh, that's interesting too, I had never seen that.  Yeah, you know, you
look at most of the, you know, like the bank clocks and stuff like that, it
tells you, you know, fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds
of things, you know, so sure, you know, (( )) getting us all accustomed to
seeing both, you know.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  But, most people don't pay any attention, you know, it's going to take
some education right along with it, most people don't know what that means,
#you know.#

A.119:  #Well,#

B.120:  So,

A.121:  we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start to not use the
english measure anymore like when you listen to the weather forecast the, the
weather man may give the temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit and
everybody ignores the centigrade and #listens,#

B.122:  #That's right,#

A.123:  to the fahrenheit,

B.124:  because that's what they're familiar with.

A.125:  and we, we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body
temperature is thirty-seven degrees centigrade.

B.126:  Right. 

A.127:  [Laughter]. 

B.128:  That's going to be hard to do.

A.129:  Yes.

B.130:  It's going to be very hard to do.  #You know you,#

A.131:  #and that it's# a nice day when it's twenty-five degrees outside
[laughter],

B.132:  [Laughter].  You know, I'm so used to saying oh, my babies got a hundred
and three degree fever and, you know, just say it's thirty-nine is not just
going to sound very bad [laughter].

A.133:  Yeah, the Europeans think that you're baby is boiling over [laughter].

B.134:  That's right, that's right your baby's still alive with (( )) [laughter].
So, yeah, it's going to take a changing lot of our old prejudices and, you
know, just making up our minds that yes we are going to do this and we're just
going to forgot this old way and we're just going to do it,

A.135:  #Yeah.# 

B.136:  #you know,# and I don't think the older generation is probably
ready to do that, you know. (( )) 

A.137:  No, I hope we get to the point where maybe a couple of generations from now
when somebody reads the old adage ...
