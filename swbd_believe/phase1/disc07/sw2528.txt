REMARKS:        Speaker A had a tendency to mumble, talk fast in places, and
run several of his words together in the conversation making it difficult to 
understand what was said.

============================================================================

@A.1:  Yeah, so, uh, what are your favorite T V shows? 

B.2:   One that I can't find anymore which is GABRIEL'S FIRE. 

A.3:  Oh, I haven't watched that very much, is that, do you like that?

B.4:  Yes. 

A.5:  When was that on? 

B.6:  It was usually on, um, Thursday nights. 

A.7:  On A B C? 

B.8:  I don't know [laughter]. 

A.9:  Oh, oh, yeah, well, um, um, it may be that, um, it was recently replaced,
by actually by, um, by what may be my favorite T V show of, because sort of,
uh, um, TWIN PEAKS.

B.10:  It was same time period, yes. 

A.11:  Yeah, so, TWIN PEAKS, um, what happened was, I think, TWIN PEAKS, um, went,
went off, they moved to a Saturday night for a while.  And then put, and then
put something, I guess, GABRIEL'S FIRE on it, and at Thursday nights, and then
they moved, um, no, GABRIEL'S FIRE was on C B S, I think, I, I take that back.
I'm not sure, but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when PEAKS
was back in that time slot as well.  So, I don't know.

B.12:  You don't know what happened to GABRIEL'S FIRE then?

A.13:  No, I have no idea.  I don't think, I don't think that was on A B C, anyway
I don't know what happened to it though.

B.14:  I don't remember one, from one station to another.  I keep forgetting one
station.

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  What's your second favorite? 

A.17:  Um, it's hard to say [laughter] I'm sort of a very big TWIN PEAKS fan,
and beyond that I just sort of watch anything that happens to be on.  I'm,
I'm, half the time I'm a T V addict and the other half the time I just ignore
it [laughter] it's really bad.  Yeah, there's some new shows that I sort of
like, um, have you seen this ((SHANNON FIELD SHOW)) or, uh, it's about a
lawyer, it's one of these lawyer shows, you know, ((they seem)) to be popular
these days.  ((And there's)) a lot of those (( )) ((Blair)) shows floating
around.

B.18:  Oh, is he the reformed, um, gambler? 

A.19:  Yeah. 

B.20:  Yes, yes, yes. 

A.21:  I just ((like)) I just finished watching that a few minutes ago,
[laughter].  Um, and it and, that, that's a interesting one.  I, I, I like
that, ((because there's, there are)), I've noticed that every, every major
station now has their own law show.  There's L A LAW, and there's, um, EQUAL
JUSTICE, some other one, LAW AND ORDER or something.  Lots of, lots of these
things that are floating around now.  They seem to be popular shows.  Do you
like the law shows or,

B.22:  I really don't watch that much T V, what I do is I tape the programs I want
to watch, and then on the nights I can watch, I'll pick out something.

A.23:  That, that makes ((logic)),

B.24:  But, um, 

A.25:  also ((saves a lot of time)) with commercials. 

B.26:  [Laughter] you're not kidding.  Do you ever watch AMERICAN GLADIATORS?

A.27:  Oh, I have.  I've, I've, I watched that late, um, I guess it's on late
Saturday nights or something,

B.28:  Midnight.  

A.29:  ((that's entering)) the day as well. 

B.30:  Midnight. 

A.31:  Have you, have, have you seen this often? 

B.32:  I tape it. 

A.33:  Oh, really? 

B.34:  Yeah, I tape it because I don't stay up that late to watch it,

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  I tape it.  But I understand, uh, that in England, they play it at normal
times because they don't consider that violent, and the reason they have it on
here so late is because they consider it a violent program.

A.37:  Really?  I don't know that.  I,

B.38:  And, I'm like, I don't believe this. 

A.39:  That ((don't, it)), it, it seems like, I mean, if wrestling is prime time,
professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a
wrestling to me, I don't, I don't see any difference though,

B.40:  I don't either. 

A.41:  I, I don't understand it, they consider it violent.  I have ((so ever)),
I have seen it on, ((where we are)), I live in, ((uh)), Rochester, New York,
and I think a,

B.42:  You're in New York?

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  Oh.

A.45:  Where are you? 

B.46:  I'm in Dallas, Texas. 

A.47:  You're, uh, everybody I speak to is in Texas, oh, oh, yeah, but I'm, I'm in
New York and, uh, we seem, we seem to have, um, I think the AMERICAN
GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well,

B.48:  Oh, really?  

A.49:  sometimes.  I think it's been on, I think I've seen it during the day.  I
know I've seen it during the day in Florida.  When I was at my parents down
there.

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  Definitely seen it do-, on, on, ((during the day down there)), and I don't
think it's a very violent show, I think it's funny.  I think it's a real good
concept, I think it's something completely new.

B.52:  I think it's great.  I love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a
policemen or something else,

A.53:  [Laughter].  

B.54:  and competition.  I'm going oh, great, you know, 

A.55:  Well, 

B.56:  it's a, it's a great role model for everybody.

A.57:  Yeah, I think so, I think because people sort of get through, you know, um,
I think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness
as well as the, as well as, you know, some mental fitness and I think that
people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.

B.58:  Oh, yes, I mean, when I had, uh, I was watching it, the, first time I ever
saw a microbiologist on there I thought well, it just goes to prove it has
nothing to do with your physical capabilities.  And, uh, there she was
terrific, she was really terrific.

A.59:  Well, don't they take people who have some sort of, um, big abilities like
and, and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones I saw they
had, um, a man on who was, uh, he played college football and almost went pro,
and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the, uh,
she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who
have very, very big sports backgrounds.  To have they, le-, leaned away from
that sort of,

B.60:  They hold competitions in Los Angeles in, um, Florida and Minneapolis,
Minnea-, um, trying to think of, I think it's in four places around the United
States.  They hold competition and the only requirement is, of course, your
skill of passing these tests,

A.61:  Oh, that's #how they do it.# 

B.62:  #and that's it.#  And we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made
it.

A.63:  Really?

B.64:  There is a woman that, uh, made, well, she called herself a craft person
so, I'm not quite sure what she made.

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  And, uh, she made it.  I mean there is no, your occupation has nothing to
do with it.

A.67:  Yeah, okay, I just thought they had some,

B.68:  Strictly your skill.

A.69:  yeah, I thought they had some sort of, I mean, I thought they were just
((poor people like us)) I guess not, that's great.

B.70:  Huh-uh.

A.71:  But, maybe I'll try it one day.

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  [Laughter] I'll get on there one day and see if I can, uh, um, what, what
do they win, they, they win money I think, don't they?

B.74:  I think the last I heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand
dollars.

A.75:  Really? 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  Wow.  All that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an
hour.

B.78:  Yeah, that's, you know, just minor. 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  Just minor little ball here or there, you know.

A.81:  One little ball here and there, yeah, and this guy's beating you up, so, I
don't know the beating up part.  I, I actually feel the tennis balls would
hurt.

B.82:  Oh, well, they,

A.83:  They look like, 

B.84:  they come out with a lot of bruises too. 

A.85:  Yeah, they seem like a tennis ball ((but it almost)) doesn't look like it's
almost livable ((yeah, the best)) (( )) I, I don't think I could, I, I could
handle those tennis balls.  So, what else to you tape besides AMERICAN GLAD-,
at, there anything else?

B.86:  Hey,

A.87:  Huh?  

B.88:  see I tape MURDER SHE WROTE.

A.89:  Okay. 

B.90:  I like mysteries. 

A.91:  Oh, okay. 

B.92:  I like mysteries.  I tape, um, FATHER DOWLING,

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  because that's another mystery, and I don't have to concentrate too hard
on them.

A.95:  [Laughter] But, I'm sure that's fun.

B.96:  Um, most of the lawyer programs like, uh, LAW AND ORDER,

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  they're not on the times that I've got, that I've watched because I
haven't had T got, T V GUIDE around here in ages.

A.99:  Oh, okay, well, ((they seem)) to be on later,

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  all, always right, right before the news is when I catch them.  I, I tend
to, if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch
the news, and or, or NIGHTLINE or something, just sort of get a good, you
know, a good, a good think for the day.

B.102:  Your news is on at eleven?

A.103:  Yes.  When is yours on? 

B.104:  Ten, I was just in the middle of watching it. 

A.105:  Oh, gosh, well, I'm sorry I interrupted, um,

B.106:  Oh, that's okay.

A.107:  Yeah, ours is on,

B.108:  No problem. 

A.109:  actually it, ours is on at eleven it, it's, um, eleven o'clock now here
or eleven twenty-five now here in New York.  Um, I think they wo-, they do
that, I think they put things on at, um, eleven o'clock here and I think they
put it like eleven o'clock, um, California time, like in California but in the
middle they sort of, um, like central time or mountain time they, they push
things back.  So, I was actually, actually ((I'm not sure)), I was in, I was
in Iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier, so, does
your prime time start at seven o'clock?

B.110:  No, well, they have it at six and they have it at nine,

A.111:  #Wait, no, no,#

B.112:  #and they have one at ten.#  

A.113:  not, not even the news but do they have like, um, do like sort of all the
regular sitcoms and so forth, start at seven o'clock?  You, so, like, you
know, the regular television shows that are, that are very popular, do they
start at,

B.114:  I'm trying to think.

A.115:  seven or, or at eight? 

B.116:  Both, um, let's see they start, um, EVENING SHADE at seven and then it goes
to, um, what is it after EVENING, um,

A.117:  Right, because that would (( )) the eight o'clock here.

B.118:  that's MAJOR DAD at eight I think it is.

A.119:  Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at
eight o'clock here, that wouldn't start at seven.  We have, um, at seven
o'clock we just have, um, the, they'll play, you know, they have old reruns of
CHEERS or something from seven to seven thirty, and then something else from
seven thirty to eight but then at, at eight o'clock is when everything starts.

B.120:  Huh. 

A.121:  Which is, which is strange, I mean, because yours start at seven and end to
ten and ours start at, at, at, at eight and end at eleven, that's why we ((
)).  I, I would actually like it better if everything started at seven and
ended at ten.

B.122:  Yeah, it's, it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night
programs, at that point which could be one of, you know, many different night
programs but it goes into night programs.

A.123:  Oh, that's great. 

B.124:  But, uh, do you ever watch CHEERS? 

A.125:  Oh, all the time. 

B.126:  [Laughter]. 

A.127:  Do you watch CHEERS or,

B.128:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

A.129:  There's, there's, it's at, that was actually a big dilemma for me now
because, um, CHEERS, CHEERS and TWIN PEAKS are now on the same time,
