============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, where do you like to go out to eat?

B.2: Oh, gosh, uh, we used to go out quite a bit, uh, but, since, [laughter]
we've got a family now we don't seem to go out near as much as we used to
[laughter].

A.3:  Oh, I can relate to that, lucky if you go out once a month.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Um, we, we like to go to all kinds of different places, of course, since
you're from the same, we're both from the same area, we're, we're probably
familiar with the same places.

A.7:  Uh-huh, I, we like all, most any kind of food and here in Texas they seem
to give such large portions, so, you know, you really, I really enjoy eating
out here [laughter].

B.8:  Oh, yeah, well it can kill your diet [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, I know, ea-, eating out is a real treat for me because, you know,

B.10:  Yeah, me too.

A.11:  I, with two, we have two children and it costs so much to take the family
out, you know.

B.12:  I know.

A.13:  We treated the kids today because they wanted to go out to lunch at
Wendy's but its like they, it cost so much to even go there, {pause} so.

B.14:  I know, I know, it's, it's, it's, uh, 

A.15:  Yeah, we like to go to, my, one of my favorite places is like Sizzler.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And, uh, you know, I like Red Lobster and,

B.18:  Oh, me too.

A.19:  and, you know the Sizzler's real nice because you get the, you know, you
get a lot of food,

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  but the atmosphere's nice and,

B.22:  They've got a great salad bar, too.

A.23:  Yeah, you can, you can just make a meal out of the salad bar.

B.24:  Oh, I know, I know.

A.25:  And, uh, I, I look for, in a restaurant, I, they have to be courteous and
clean, you know, that, you know, 

B.26:  Oh yeah.

A.27:  I don't, I'm not looking for, you know, gourmet food, but, you know I
want food that's, you know, good.  

B.28:  Yeah we-,

A.29:  Something that I would, you know, if I made it I'd serve to my family or
guests, so.

B.30:  Ye-, oh, yeah really. 

A.31:  So.

B.32:  Well when we lived in, in Dallas, uh, until, up until last, last year,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  so, uh, we, live close to Addison so we went,

A.35:  Oh.

B.36:  to a lot of places, ov-, over there.

A.37:  Yeah, Addison has some wonderful places to eat, yeah.

B.38:  Uh-huh, th-, we, um, I really enjoyed going to Copeland's,

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  over in front of Prestonwood Mall.  Have you ever been there?

A.41:  No, I haven't.

B.42:  It, it's, uh, new, it's, it's New Orleans food but it's not, strictly the
real ho-, 

A.43:  Cajun.

B.44:  not strictly Cajun.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  But it's, it's a nice place to go.  It's, it's relaxing.

A.47:  Uh-huh, yeah, see I grew up in Wyoming and so I'm so used to the, you know,
the beef and the barbecue type stuff, you know.

B.48:  Yeah [breathing] {heavily}.

A.49:  Uh, I like, uh, I think going to Steak-N-Ale is a treat too, 

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  I really like that, but, uh.

B.52:  Have you ever been to Spring Creek Barbecue?

A.53:  Uh, I can't remember if my husband's taken me there or not.   My husband's
probably gone there because he works up at the Plano plant.

B.54:  Oh, okay, it, it's, uh, it's in Richardson off Seventy-five.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  Um, just north of Beltline, I believe.

A.57:  Uh, I have, I don't think I've been there.  He might have.

B.58:  Yeah, a lot of T I people go there.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  So, um, when my husband wor-, worked at the North Building we went there,
we'd meet there for lunch or something, but that place has great barbecue.

A.61:  Yeah, my husband used to work at the North Building so he probably has
been there.  

B.62:  Yeah, he probably has.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Because, um.

A.65:  Uh, ye-, I en-, I, uh, and you know being on a budget, the pri-, it can't
be real expensive either.

B.66:  Oh ye-, I know, 

A.67:  {Talking to child in background}  What's wrong Melissa, do you need to go
potty.

B.68:  and I hav-, I can't even remember the last time [laughter],

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  we went out someplace like that [laughter].

A.71:  Yeah, yeah, it's real treat to go, so.  Some people, you know, they just
go out almost every night, you know and I'm like,

B.72:  Oh, you, y-, can't do that [laughter].

A.73:  No, no [child].

B.74:  Well when we, when we both worked before, uh, before the two year old came
along,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  we, we would go out once, at least once a week.

A.77:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.78:  And, and, uh, didn't think a whole lot ab-, abo-, about it but now we
just can't afford to,

A.79:  No, you can't, it, uh, it just cost too much by the time you,  yo-,
because you've got to consider a baby-sitter on top of that.

B.80:  Oh yeah.

A.81:  And, uh, I'm a person that loves to do coupons, you know, it,

B.82:  Oh yeah, uh-huh.

A.83:  with the grocery store, so, I just, you know, like this is why they come
out with coupons and stuff, so I'm not afraid to use a, a coupon at a place
either, so  [child_talking]. 

B.84:  Oh, me neither.  No they, uh, do you do, do you all do a lot of Mexican any
Mexican fo-, places down here.

A.85:  Pardon me.

B.86:  Mexican food.

A.87:  Oh, El Chico's I really like.

B.88:  I do too, I like El Chico's, I ha-,

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  um, I've been to several places, uh, On The Border is okay, but it is so
expensive even at lunch time,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  it's just not worth it.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  For what you ge-, for Mexican food, you know, whatever [laughter].

A.95:  Yeah, whatever, yeah, oh, I en-, I really like El Chico's so, that was one
place that when we lived over in the Green-, you know we just lived over on
Greenville and L B J, you know, 

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  so there was an El Chico's real close and,

B.98:  Oh yeah.

A.99:  and my husband working at the North Building, we would go there, this is
before we had kids, you know, 

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  we'd go there, you know, quite a bit, because we just really liked it
but I haven't been there in so long.  I think the last time I was there we
took our kids and so.

B.102:  I find it, it difficult to go out with, 

A.103:  With children.

B.104:  and have a good time with, uh,

A.105:  Uh-huh, it is.

B.106:  with ta-, tagging the ((kidos)) along, you know.

A.107:  Uh-huh, oh, I, I have to agree there it,

B.108:  Tha-, it just, it just kind of takes something out of it [laughter].

A.109:  Oh yeah, it does, you know, by the time you, you go through the,
you know, the spilling on the floor, and the sit down and be quiet and quit
yelling in the,

B.110:  Y-, you just can't enjoy yourself, uh, paying all that money,

A.111:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.112:  for [laughter] the same kind of hassle you get at home.

A.113:  One thing, my ki-, place my kids enjoy going is Denny's.  

B.114:  Oh really [talking].

A.115:  Yeah, because you get those, you can get coupons, you know, like in the
paper, you know, that come in the coupon section of the paper.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  They've had, you know, like buy get one dinner entree, get one for free.

B.118:  Uh.

A.119:  So, we've done that a couple times where we've taken the kids, and, you
know, they have a little kids menu and they really like that.

B.120:  Really.

A.121:  But then again it's difficult to keep them quiet. 

B.122:  Yeah [laughter].

A.123:  And then they like Showbusiness Pizza, you know.

B.124:  #Oh, oh, gosh.#

A.125:  #Oh, Showbusiness, sho-, my daughter calls it,#  

B.126:  #Oh, I can't wait until mine gets old enough to do that [laughter].#

A.127:  #Oh.#

B.128:  That place will cost you a fortune.

A.129:  Oh, you're not a kidding, it, it, that's why we've only been there a couple
times.  Yeah, that you might, when you go, 

B.130:  And their pizza's not that good.

A.131:  No, isn't that the truth, you mi-, you go there just for the kids, it's
the rides.

B.132:  Uh, yeah.

A.133:  We've taken our kids there just for, to play, you know.  

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  But, yeah, when you go in there you expect to spend twenty dollars.

B.136:  Oh, at least, 

A.137:  Yeah.

B.138:  well, you'd think they'd have decent pizza, for, uh, for all th-,

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  that you're having to sit through [laughter].

A.141:  Yeah.  No, for kids amusement parks we go to Monkey Business, that's a
pl-, plain amusement park, but yeah its,

B.142:  Where's that at?

A.143:  It's in, uh, Mesquite off of Military and Scyene on Six thirty-five.

B.144:  Huh, I've never heard of that.

A.145:  It's an indoor amusement park, yo-, you're child's probably too young.

B.146:  Yeah, she is.

A.147:  Yeah so, but, yeah, uh, my kids love it.  I have a two year, well almost a
three year old and a four year old, so.

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  And they love it, but, yeah, we enjoy going out and of course, McDonald's
and,

B.150:  Oh, oh, we do, oh, there so-, there must be something in McDonalds food
that little kids just can't do with out. 

A.151:  Oh, I know.

B.152:  I just can not figure it out.

A.153:  Um, with mine I don't know if it's so much the food, I think it's just
the, the play on the outside equipment. 

B.154:  Yeah, oh, I guess the, but mine she just loves McDonalds, she love, I'll
fix hamburgers and she won't eat them but she'll,

A.155:  You take them,

B.156:  scarf down a McDonalds hamburger,

A.157:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.158:  so fast it will make my head swim, and I just can't figure that out
[laughter] [child_talking].

A.159:  Yeah, yeah, I think they enjoy going out too, it's a treat for them too,
so, yeah.

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  Well, I think we've about discussed the subject [laughter].

B.162:  [Laughter].

A.163:  Before the lady comes on and tells us our ten minutes up.

B.164:  Yeah, oh, [laughter] well it was nice talking to you.

A.165:  It was nice talking to you too, bye, bye.

B.166:  #Have a good evening.#

A.167:  #You too.#

B.168:  #Bye, bye#

A.169:  #Bye, bye.#
