REMARKS:        Both speakers mumbled, spoke while they laughed, and speaker
A spoke so fast that she had a tendency to run all of her words together and 
you couldn't understand anything she was saying at the time.  Most of the 
conversation was garbled.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, what baseball team are you familiar with? 

@B.2:  Well, I'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up
in Boston for a while,

A.3:  Really?

B.4:  and, um, and that's,

A.5:  Oh, now come on, no Texas Rangers? 

B.6:  [Laughter] after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to
tell you if that was football or [laughter] baseball.

A.7:  Really?  I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason
which is something we can think about later but, um, I understand a little bit
about the Texas Rangers.  I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter
(( )) ((bounced off the ground)) and that, um, ((yeah)), I heard a joke on the
radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile
system,

B.8:  [Laughter].  

A.9:  and, uh, the ((radio's)) kind of cruel, I mean, think, the, he, ((this
chain)) that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off
the ground, I mean, goll-, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man.  I
don't care if you're President.

B.10:  Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that
far [laughter].  I couldn't do it.

A.11:  I know but he's a man come on, men know how to do that, right?

B.12:  ((Right, he's)) supposed to be able to do that. 

A.13:  I know so, I felt kind of sorry for him. (( )) that must have been hard on
him because he's just a person but, um, I never (( )), a major owner of
our t-, of the team here.

B.14:  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.

A.15:  Yeah, he's like, I thought he was the owner but it turns out my Mom said
that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you
hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  See, I even know his name because he's on the news a lot, and I never had
to watch the news not, you know, not like some people ((hour and a)) half a
day or anything.

B.18:  Yeah, and I've been watching, uh, my husband's French and so if I've been
watching the French news,

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  when I watch it.  ((It's incentive)), speaking of Bush, we're going to
get a little off topic but speaking of Bush, they that had a story where he
went to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff.

A.21:  Oh, I saw that.

B.22:  Did you see that, where he, the guy asked him for proof of who he was,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  ((he said his)) (( )).

A.25:  I want to see your driver's lic-, I, I,

B.26:  I know and ((see a)) credit card [laughter].

A.27:  I don't, you're not President Bush.  I know and he said ((yeah, it does
so fast)), I heard it on the radio.  I heard the audio portion on the radio in
the car but I didn't see it but,

B.28:  It was so funny to see, it was a really cute little kid too.

A.29:  That's about my extent of, um, about baseball, I don't know,

B.30:  Well, I can tell you,

A.31:  that much about it. 

B.32:  that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game, and I couldn't
tell you who pitched,

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  but they won, the Mets won.

A.37:  Did they? 

B.38:  But, yeah, not my a lot, and then somebody else lost, maybe it was the
other New York team which is the Yankees,

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees,

A.41:  That's so stupid that you all have two teams.

B.42:  or (( )) New Jersey.  Yeah.

A.43:  That's really stupid.

B.44:  Well, but it, the-, then they can have them play against each other.

A.45:  Yeah, I know.

B.46:  I think it's still the New York Yankees, you know,

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  (( )) I thought they were moving to New Jersey [laughter].  This is how
much I know about baseball.

A.49:  The Texas Rangers, they, they lost, I think.

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  But I know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year.  We got
free tickets because someone at our church, one of the deacons at church, um,
parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the, uh, the
places and stuff.

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  And he's their head chauffeur, is this funny, as they're parking the cars
the valet service.

B.54:  ((Right)).

A.55:  Yeah, he makes good money too doing that, you'd be sh-, I was shocked, but
anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  and then the Iranian couldn't, he didn't want them, so he gave them to
Alan, and Alan and his ((Dad)) had plans that night so they gave them to us,
so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian,

B.58:  With baseball tickets.

A.59:  (( )) with baseball tickets, and we ended up with them, right.  And so we
were,

B.60:  ((Yeah)) (( )).

A.61:  walking up and I looked at my husband and I said, you know what ((Kyle))
this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek ((a tip)) I bet these are really good
seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,

B.62:  Wow.

A.63:  oh, yeah, we (( )) they called us at five and the game started at seven
so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked
((and)) so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these
seats, you know because,

B.64:  Because they're fancy seats and stuff.

A.65:  yeah, and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up (( ))
you know, I just was there, you know, like I'm loaded, I'm here, you know,
and, uh, it was just kind of funny because, you know, but we got to sit by
first base if ((they did hit a)) ball I would have been afraid it would have
knocked my face in, you know.

B.66:  I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game.  I rarely go but
we went last year because my brother, my brother is impossible,

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of
stuff,

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  and if there's a game on, he's watching it.  I mean, that's all there is
to it,

A.71:  Really?

B.72:  and he's like glued at the T V.

A.73:  I'm glad my husband's not like that. 

B.74:  Oh, I'm glad my husband's not like that either, I'd kill him [laughter].
My brother's like that and, um, see he goes to a lot of games, not a real lot,
but he tries to go, then my father got us some tickets,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  so my brother's wife and my husband and I went.  Last year we wanted to
show my husband what a baseball game was because,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  you know, being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is
like.  And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd, it was nice weather
and stuff, it wasn't a real problem, but you sit there in a crowd, and you're
waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs
[laughter], um, because we made him try a hot dog, you know (( )),

A.79:  That's funny.

B.80:  and, um, so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored,
and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other
way during the time,

A.81:  You miss the whole thing.

B.82:  yeah, and so you're basically you (( )) sit there and wait for something
exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it,

A.83:  That's funny.

B.84:  and didn't understand it and it,

A.85:  Where is he from in France? 

B.86:  Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in (( )),

A.87:  Uh-huh. 

B.88:  which is the, sort of ((O strip)) east to west, eastern part, ((but
that)),

A.89:  Yeah.  I have a, I had a friend in college from Strasbourg,

B.90:  Yeah, he's not that far, he was sort of in between Strasbourg,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  and Paris. 

A.93:  Paris.  And my cousin lives in Paris and she's lived there for like, oh,
off and on for twenty years.

B.94:  Oh, is she still there?

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  Because,

A.97:  ((Saint Claude)) is that sound familiar?

B.98:  Yeah, Saint Claude,

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  yeah, we used to, that's one of the, um, entrances to the ((periphery))
to get in and out of the city.

A.101:  Oh, really?

B.102:  And it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  I (( )) exactly where she is.  But, um, we met in Paris.

A.105:  That's neat.  Yeah, she ((married)) and they have twelve children.

B.106:  Twelve children? 

A.107:  She has twelve children. 

B.108:  Oh, my God, the poor woman. 

A.109:  She looks gorgeous, no she's gorgeous and she just liked having kids and
she's thin and, I mean,

B.110:  Were any of them twins?

A.111:  (( )) four or more children are thin, I mean, I'm not kidding you.

B.112:  You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than ((two of them))
[laughter].

A.113:  No, your, I have a friend now that has seven.  And, um, and they're all
eight and under,

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  and nine and under, they're all real young, they're just raised ((right))
that's what God's told them to do but they're not condemning you, if you, we
only have one child, you know, they don't say, they don't put (( )) on bad or
anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do
that, you get a ((conviction)) like that and you think everyone should have
it.  And so I'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't
do that at all.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  You go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there.  And I
always give her a hard time (( )) who's toothbrush did you really use this
morning [laughter].

B.118:  But how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first
baby,

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  almost any day and,

A.121:  They live ((lean)) for one thing and they tithe and they (( )) it puts 
(( )) a whole in your money bag, we don't honor God with this (( )) portion and
so they, I think that helps a lot.  I think that's the key, in he, like his
((sales)) last year he just works a normal job.  He probably has an income of
thirty-five thousand, but last year he made (( )) that got him a bonus of
twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  ((He loves)) God, I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this
company had ever done,

B.124:  Wow.

A.125:  and he got to do it and so God just really blesses him in ways like that,
do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a blessing and, and some people
(( )) you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,
but kids are just as much of a blessing ((inside these)) material things but
it's a different kind and a lot times people think, oh, well, I'm not blessed
I have an old car.  But you've got five kids, you know,

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,
there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING,

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  by ((Richard Fugate)) and he's, you know, a lot of wisdom in it.  And the
kids at ((BIBLE)) talk about anything but training, and training is different
than anything else in, in psychology doesn't address it.  A lot of the
psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the
BIBLE and they don't quote you the proverb out of it, but the things that work
in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out
of the BIBLE and so this book it just really (( )) all these things and how to
train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're
thirteen.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  ((What)) I mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so,
you know, they do that and they, they just live lean pretty much they don't,
she doesn't shop at Foley's you know, and stuff like that.  But a lot women
((die or shop)) at Foley's so ((things)),

B.132:  I, I don't know what Foley's is [laughter]. 

A.133:  It's like a Macy's,

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  kind of store, it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and,
you know, you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or
you get pictures like we did. You know what I mean?

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  You do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways and I know
Manhattan's real expensive but, um, it's kind of a different situation because
you're probably living in an apartment, right?

B.138:  Yeah, well, that makes a really big difference.  But,

A.139:  Yeah. 

B.140:  but, still it's just as hard as having, that, but (( )) your cousin could
have a baseball team with twelve kids [laughter].

A.141:  [Laughter] Well, (( )) church (( )) softball leagues, so,

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls league because
I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to
doing it.  I keep saying we need to have one.  They go, okay, then start one.
((But)) everybody (( )) wants to do it but, you know, God's sitting on my
heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, but anyway, so they could
really only have four members on the team.  I think they only have four
((boys)).  I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  But, um, ((then)) you didn't believe me about her kids ((are the)) they are
so good.  I'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a
commitment and, that, that's what they're called to do.

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  I have a, most of my friends,

B.148:  I admire someone that can do that, you know, I really can.

A.149:  I know, I do too, I, most of my friends have three or four kids and they
feel like, you know, that's ((really)) why God (( )) and some of the people in
our church use birth control and some of them don't, I had my tubes tied so
you,
