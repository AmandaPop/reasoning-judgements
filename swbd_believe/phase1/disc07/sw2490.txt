A.1:   Okay, well what do you think? 

B.2:   Well, I'm kind of leaning towards, [sigh] I don't know, I'm thinking about what, from one to ten what my no would be. It would probably be somewhere closer to, [sigh] uh, less control because I don't see, I'm not a member of the N R A although my, 

A.3:   [Noise]. 

B.4:   father is. 

A.5:   Uh-huh. 

B.6:   But, I guess I believe, I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way. #You know,# 

A.7:   #Yeah.# 

B.8:   they're sitting there on number ten, they're saying absolutely no gun control, 

A.9:   [Noise]. 

B.10:   we don't even want to think about it and, and I think that's a dumb, 

A.11:   #Yeah.# 

B.12:   #situation.# Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see, 

A.13:   [Noise]. 

B.14:   that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose, you know, if, if you're going to hunt with it, 

A.15:   Uh-huh. 

B.16:   or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week. 

A.17:   Right. #That's true.# 

B.18:   #It's not a# big deal for them to go. If they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket, you know, I mean, they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record, 

A.19:   Right. 

B.20:   armed, you know, felony record. 

A.21:   That's true. 

B.22:   any of that kind of stuff. And, it seems to me right now that there's not, there's not that much of a check. I, I'm not really sure what Texas law, I think there's a check for (( )) felonies, on your record. 

A.23:   Right. #But,# 

B.24:   #If# the gun shop owner does it, 

A.25:   Uh-huh. 

B.26:   #you know, but,# 

A.27:   #Yeah, but he has to go out# and do it. That's true, #I think,# 

B.28:   #Yeah, if,# and if it's a private sale, of course, then there's nothing. 

A.29:   Right. And, see that's my only problem with, uh, [lipsmack] making you, [sigh] um, you know, get the check and everything is, is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys, they are going to get a gun no matter what. 

B.30:   #Uh-huh.# 

A.31:   #They're not,# I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check, I think they're going to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something #like that.# 

B.32:   #Yes.# But, but maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckley's. 

A.33:   Yeah. I hope. #That's true.# 

B.34:   #You know,# I, I, that, that's the kind of people, like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a #knife, baseball bat,# 

A.35:   #Knife, exactly.# 

B.36:   or, you know, whatever, 

A.37:   He's going to do what he wants to do. 

B.38:   but, #you know,# 

A.39:   #That's true.# I, I just think it makes honest people more honest and, 

B.40:   Yeah. And, and the people who want it, it's not that big a deal, like I say, #to wait.# 

A.41:   #Right#. Right. And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong [laughter]. 

B.42:   [Laughter] Yeah, it makes you wonder, 

A.43:   [Noise] 

B.44:   what they need it for #all of a sudden here. Um,# 

A.45:   #[Laughter] That's right.# That's right. 

B.46:   Oh. 

A.47:   Well, I'm married to a policeman, so we, we talk about this a lot [laughter]. 

B.48:   Yeah, [laughter] I, I imagine his, his opinion is a little bit towards the one #there,# 

A.49:   #Yeah.# 

B.50:   on the -- 

A.51:   Yeah. 

B.52:   -- scale of one to ten he needs some more. 

A.53:   Yeah. I was watching a, 

B.54:   Gosh, if I was a cop I would be, 

A.55:   [Laughter] worried about that. 

B.56:   Too many people have too many, too much access. 

A.57:   Yeah, they do. They #do.# 

B.58:   #and,# I guess I think, the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu-, I mean, 

A.59:   [Breathing]. 

B.60:   some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out, 

A.61:   #Right.# 

B.62:   #that are#, pie-, I mean, they're are basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven 

A.63:   [cough] right or even even the um the little um [lipsmack] toy guns look real. I mean 

B.64:   #yes they that's really gotten bad# 

A.65:   #I've heard so much about that on TV# and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one. 

B.66:   Or your child -- 

A.67:   Yeah. 

B.68:   -- accidently. If your child is old enough, I mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve, 

A.69:   #Right.# 

B.70:   #or fourteen# or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. Whether, 

A.71:   Uh-huh. 

B.72:   you know a racist or not, that's the truth. And, [sniffing] And if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up, 

A.73:   Right. I mean, you can't blame them. It looks -- 

B.74:   You can't (( )), 

A.75:   -- like they've got a weapon. 

B.76:   Jeez and you can't take the chances. 

A.77:   That's right, 

B.78:   Because there's been kids that age who have killed people. 

A.79:   [Laughter] Exactly. 

B.80:   And, you know, you know, there was a law in, [lipsmack] {pause} I think it's in Oregon, where they've now made all toy guns, they're making them neon colors. 

A.81:   #Right and I think, that's a good idea.# 

B.82:   #You know# like, yeah, and the kids don't care. 

A.83:   #That's right.# 

B.84:   #My kid didn't care.# 

A.85:   I know. 

B.86:   He picks up a stick and goes #bang.# 

A.87:   #Right,# [laughter] #right.# 

B.88:   #It doesn't# make any difference to him. 

A.89:   A gun is a gun to them. 

B.90:   #Yeah#. 

A.91:   #They# can play with anything and make it a gun. That's exactly right. 

B.92:   Yeah, so you like to do, I think they ought to do that with toy guns, they ought to make them very reasonably -- 

A.93:   #Right.# 

B.94:   -- #do something# outrageous to them. 

A.95:   #Right. Exactly.# 

B.96:   #You know,# so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun. 

A.97:   That's right. That's a good idea. I was, uh, watching T V yesterday and there is a town in Georgia, and it's the law that you have a gun, every adult, you know, uh, is able to carry a gun, and, 

B.98:   #That's kind of (( )),# 

A.99:   #and they encourage it.# 

B.100:   They encourage it? 

A.101:   Yeah. And, the police love it. Which really surprised me -- 

B.102:   Um. 

A.103:   -- and, and, I think, and that's what they were going after, uh, they went to interview this town, I mean it's a little dinky town, they went to interview them about the gun control laws [lipsmack] and, uh, the police said, (( )) all the people said, that's fine we could care less. You know, we're all honest, and everything like, 

B.104:   Huh. 

A.105:   that, we, we all carry them, but we, we don't mind being checked. And, uh, and I think it kind of took that uh, neatness away from it, you know, like, well heck, everybody's got one, you know and, 

B.106:   I don't know. I, 

A.107:   So, it was, it was quite unusual to see the people in that #town.# 

B.108:   #That's# kind of an odd thing. I don't know, I have a gun and, uh, my folks have always had. I learned to shoot when I was real #little.# 

A.109:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.110:   I think that's a lot of it too, is that people need to teach their kids, 

A.111:   #Right.# 

B.112:   #what# not to, what to do and what not to do. 

A.113:   Exactly. 

B.114:   Because I started shooting, my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B #gun,# 

A.115:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.116:   when I was probably five or six years #old.# 

A.117:   #Yeah.# 

B.118:   But, you know, it was, this is how you hold it, this is the only place that you do it, which, was, 

A.119:   #Right.# 

B.120:   #you know# out far and away and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here, and you don't -- 

A.121:   #That's what we're doing.# 

B.122:   -- #you don't point it# at people, and then they had, then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation, I guess, but anyway the s-, hunter safety program, 

A.123:   Oh, yeah. 

B.124:   that you have to do now. I think it started in about nineteen seventy. 

A.125:   Oh. 

B.126:   If you want, if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after nineteen something, 

A.127:   Uh-huh. 

B.128:   fifty-five or something, then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses -- 

A.129:   #Well, that's neat.# 

B.130:   -- #or you can't get a# deer license. 

A.131:   Well, that's real neat. 

B.132:   And it, and it, it's basic stuff, it's like, it's don't, you know, when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence, don't point, lean your gun against it, you know, 

A.133:   Yeah. 

B.134:   and then you crawl over it, 

A.135:   Right. 

B.136:   and shoot yourself. And, uh, 

A.137:   Well, that's real good. 

B.138:   those things happen. It, it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people. 

A.139:   Right. Right. And they usually are real basic, 

B.140:   Yeah, #put the safety on the gun.# 

A.141:   #common sense things.# 

B.142:   Don't assume, always assume it's loaded. That's, that's got to be the most common #thing that people,# 

A.143:   #I know and# people don't want to believe that. 

B.144:   Yeah. It's, oh, it's empty, it's empty. Boom! 

A.145:   Yeah, well see I, 

B.146:   I took the clip out, or whatever and I forgot about the one in the #chamber [laughter].# 

A.147:   #In the# chamber [laughter]. That's exactly right. 

B.148:   Oh. 

A.149:   Yeah, well we, we're trying to teach our daughter. She knows real well about, uh, about her Daddy's guns, 

B.150:   #Oh, yeah.# 

A.151:   #what not to do# and what to do around them. 

B.152:   Does he got them locked up all the time too? #When he's (( )),# 

A.153:   #Yeah, um, and,# and she, and she's real, um, she'll know, she'll even tell her friends, don't ever, 

B.154:   Don't even think about it, yeah. 

A.155:   touch my Daddy's guns or something like that. 

B.156:   Yeah. 

A.157:   So, she's real, she's real good about it. And, she's never been curious, 

B.158:   Um. 

A.159:   I mean, cause he's always, you know, if he has them out, cleaning them, you know, she can be there and he'll tell how he's doing it or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that. 

B.160:   Yeah, if you make it where it's not something, 

A.161:   to be feared --- 

B.162:   #Curious,# 

A.163:   -- #and,# 

B.164:   not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about. 

A.165:   Right, exactly. 

B.166:   If it, if it's just one more piece of something, but they, but they've got to understand, like you said, never touch it. 

A.167:   Right, they'd have that respect for #what it does,# 

B.168:   #Yeah.# 

A.169:   and what it can do. 

B.170:   Ours is a, we have a shotgun, and it's up in the closet, 

A.171:   Uh-huh. 

B.172:   and then the shells are in another part [noise] and it's something to think about, and I got it because my husband used to travel, and be out, he was out of the country at one time for three months. 

A.173:   Oh, yeah. 

B.174:   And, I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood, but #still,# 

A.175:   #still# [laughter]. 

B.176:   and then I've got it so far, sometimes [noise] I think, I wonder if I, I'm not about to load it because I, you know, I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up #there,# 

A.177:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.178:   and it's in a case, and it's, you know, it's put up and it's away and all that, 

A.179:   Right. 

B.180:   but, I don't want to take the chance and, I think, if somebody ever does break in, 

A.181:   [Laughter] He's got to go to a lot of trouble. 

B.182:   it's going to take me a year to find the shells, 

A.183:   Yeah. 

B.184:   and then get it, 

A.185:   hold on, hold on [laughter], 

B.186:   Yeah. 

A.187:   [Laughter] He's in here somewhere, I know he is. 

B.188:   Right. 

A.189:   Yeah. Well, I know how to use one. We, we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and I really enjoy it but, boy if someone did break in, I don't, I don't know that I could or would even grab it [sniffing]. 

B.190:   I know, I, I used to think about that, it was a lot easier when I was, when I was single, it was one thing and when I was just married with no kids, 

A.191:   Uh-huh. That's true. 

B.192:   when it was just me, it was an easy decision. 

A.193:   Yeah. 

B.194:   It was like, you, you come after me, you're going to get it. 

A.195:   Yes, 

B.196:   you know, and now there's so many other things, where are the kids, what are they doing, 

A.197:   Yeah. 

B.198:   you know, where is this person coming in from, 

A.199:   Right. 

B.200:   uh, you've got, and, and, if, if you manage to get it out and then, you know, what, how can you even afford to, to think about what, what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are, 

A.201:   True. 

B.202:   at the same time. 

A.203:   True, well we, we have dogs -- 

B.204:   [Sigh] Ugh. 

A.205:   -- that are pretty, you know, very protective, you know [laughter]. 

B.206:   We feel if they make enough noise that, 

A.207:   Yeah, if they're stupid enough to come through then [laughter]. 

B.208:   Yeah. It, it, we have two big dogs in the backyard, 

A.209:   Yeah. 

B.210:   and always kind of thought that too, #kind of an extra buffer.# 

A.211:   #Yeah. They've got to be pretty stupid,# and, and most people that, uh, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs, 

B.212:   Yeah. 

A.213:   luckily. 

B.214:   Anything, that the, well any, any advantage that they can take. 

A.215:   Right. And, that's one of them so, 

B.216:   Unfortunately, yeah. 

A.217:   Well, 

B.218:   Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years [laughter]. 

A.219:   [Laughter] Yeah. Really does. Well, do you think we've, 

B.220:   Yeah, I, I think that's about all I can, 

A.221:   Me too, on gun control. 

B.222:   We, we're in pretty good agreement actually on it. 

A.223:   Yeah. I think we are. 

B.224:   It would be an interesting, it would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum. 

A.225:   Right. Right. I'm glad you're not [laughter]. 

B.226:   [Laughter] Me too. I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in Garland. 

A.227:   Okay. Well good! 

B.228:   Well, it's been nice talking to you. 

A.229:   You too, thanks. #Bye-bye.# 

B.230:   #Bye-bye.# [noise].
