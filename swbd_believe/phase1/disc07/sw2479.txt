REMARKS:  	This conversation was difficult to transcribe due to heavy
static and or echo throughout conversation during dialogue.  There were,
at points during dialogue, a great deal of background noise which sometimes 
prevented clear speech interpretation.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you have [static].

B.2:  Are you there?

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Okay [laughter].

A.5:  There, okay.

B.6:  Okay.

@A.7:  Had to mess with my phone here.  Um, do you have children?

B.8:  Yes, I have one.

A.9:  Oh, okay.

B.10:  How about you?

A.11:  I have three.

B.12:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah, uh, do you work?

B.14:  Yeah, I do.

A.15:  #Okay.#

B.16:  #I do,# I work and, and, uh, Brian's in a day care center.  He's uh, he was
two in December,

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  so he's not quite two and a half yet.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  He, uh, I put him, I'm kind of had different, different ideas from what
probably the majority of people have,

A.21:  #Uh-huh.#

B.22:  #I put# him in a day care center from the very beginning.  He started in
day care when he was eight weeks old.

A.23:  Oh, no kidding.

B.24:  And I just, I don't know, I have kind of the opposite opinion of most
people,

A.25:  Really.

B.26:  I have had this real problem [children] with a, a private individual.  I
mean I, I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a, with
private individual, [child] when the door shuts,

A.27:  #Yeah.#

B.28:  #that# one person has total control,

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  #and I# always figured at least in a day care center there are other
people around,

A.31:  #Yeah.#

B.32:  #and if# you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that
can see it.

A.33:  #Yeah.#

B.34:  #They# can watch, and --

A.35:  Yeah, yeah.

B.36:  -- I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening
were less.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  #Because there's,# 

B.38:  #You know, how can you help# depending on the day care center, you know,

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day
care centers, have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center
where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, #kind of
thing.#

A.41:  #It's like a# family thing.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah.  You never hear about it really in the big ones.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  So, that's what I did and I have had just excellent luck.

A.45:  #Oh, good.#

B.46:  #I have been just# so happy.  He's,

A.47:  Oh, good.  I was just going to ask you how it, you know, if you liked the,
the, but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there, [laughter] I know,
but,

B.48:  Right.  Right. Well he was in, he was in the same center for two years,

A.49:  [Sniffing] Uh-huh.

B.50:  for the first two years, and, uh, it was wonderful, and I loved it, and I
was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it.

A.51:  Oh, #gosh.#

B.52:  #But, I# thought okay, I'm going to keep an open mind here,

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  and the people who came in, it just wasn't, it,

A.55:  #Wasn't the same.#

B.56:  #just wasn't the same# and their,

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  their attitude and philosophy was just completely,

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  opposite from mine, and I left him there for about a month and just
decided I can't do this anymore, and I,

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  moved him, which was an extremely traumatic experience but.

A.63:  Was it?  Yeah.

B.64:  but, he's done well, he's been there,

A.65:  #Good.#

B.66:  #a couple# of months now, and I just feel so lucky.

A.67:  Oh, good.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  That's great, that's good.

B.70:  How about you?  Do you work or do you get to stay home with them?

A.71:  Well, I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years.  My oldest
one is ten and a half now,

B.72:  #Wonderful.#

A.73:  #or she's,# I guess, yeah, it's, was about ten years.  So I, yeah, I, I
was really happy that I was able to do that.  But, I, that's what I wanted to,
because I, uh, you know I just couldn't wait to have kids and so, if I was, I
was so anxious to have them and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind
of silly, you know, to go back to work as soon #as I had them, so,#

B.74:  #Right.  Right.#

A.75:  so, it, it, it, it was really great.  By the end of the ten years I was
really ready [laughter],

B.76:  Yeah. I bet [laughter].

A.77:  to go back to work, and my youngest was only, uh, two and a half
[sniffing].

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  I mean she was already two and a half,

B.80:  #Uh-huh.#

A.81:  #so it wasn't,# you know, #she wasn't an infant.#

B.82:  #A baby.#

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  Yeah [child].

A.85:  Yeah.  Yeah, so, I felt real good about that, but, uh, boy, I tell you with
summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out, in terms of what I'm going to
do, I, I guess I,

B.86:  [Child].

A.87:  went back to work about a year and a half ago and, uh, I worked full time
all last year and now I'm going to school part time and, uh, [lipsmack]
graduate school, and I'm working part time [lipsmack].  #And, so I'm still,#

B.88:  #I know how that goes# [laughter].

A.89:  Yeah.  I'm still going full time, but I only have half time salary,

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  and, uh, when school lets out, I just don't,

B.92:  [Child].

A.93:  I haven't, I have no idea what I'm going to do,

B.94:  [Child].

A.95:  because I certainly can't afford what we did last year [sniffing] --

B.96:  Right, right.

A.97:  -- which was,

B.98:  Did you have them in a center or something last summer?

A.99:  Well, we did, we tried, we had all different things, we sent them to
camp.  One, first month, in June, they went to summer school, then the second
month they, uh, one, my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my
son, uh, went to camp and there we had, uh, I don't know some, forget what
else we did but it was all, uh, really expensive [laughter].

B.100:  Yeah, that stuff is expensive.  It really is.

A.101:  So, now they're a year older,

B.102:  [Noise]. 

A.103:  and I, my daughter's eleven, going to be eleven this summer and my son will
be,

B.104:  [Noise].

A.105:  nine and a half.  [Lipsmack] And so,

B.106:  [Child].

A.107:  I'm not, I think I can leave them home,

B.108:  [Child].

A.109:  for a, if I can work part of the day, you know, #I'm going to leave them
home.#

B.110:  #Yeah, yeah.  I was going to say they're getting to the age# where,

A.111:  Right.

B.112:  you should be able to trust that a little bit, yeah.

A.113:  Yeah.  Yes, in fact I'm doing that right now with their afternoons, when
they get home before I do.  You know,

B.114:  [Child].

A.115:  that's okay.  But, the four year old now I hav-, I have had her since I
went back to work, or before I went back to work really, in a home day care
situation,

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  and, uh, we've just been really thrilled,

B.118:  [Child].

A.119:  with it too.  We were what, actually we, it took us two or three different
people to find,

B.120:  To find the right one,

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  that's what we have to do though.

A.123:  Right.  But, I wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know, [laughter] --

B.124:  #No.#

A.125:  -- #so,# the, the person we found it through the, there's an association
here in town of professional home,

B.126:  [Child].

A.127:  care providers or #something like that.#

B.128:  #Where do, where do you# live?

A.129:  In Plano.

B.130:  Plano? 

A.131:  Yeah, and they have a number you can call and all these people are
registered with their association and, you know, go like our, our, uh,
[lipsmack] I don't want to call her a baby-sitter, she's doesn't like,

B.132:  [/Child].

A.133:  to be called that, [laughter] care provider.

B.134:  [Laughter] Care provider.

A.135:  Right.  She goes to seminars and, uh,

B.136:  #Oh, that's wonderful.#

A.137:  #she gets home visitations# by the s-, (( )) I don't know, the state
boards, I guess, some of them and then some by the association, and they have
weekly meetings and everything and, so it's just really, really well
regulated.

B.138:  That's great.

A.139:  And, she's just great.  In fact, uh, she's all upset because Galen is going
to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it, [throat_clearing] you
know, I'm not going to have her anymore and I said, Oh, no, don't count on
that [laughter].

B.140:  [Laughter].

A.141:  After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning
kindergarten.

B.142:  Right, #right.#

A.143:  #So,# but, we, we've tried, we've tried everything and one year, I guess
last year when I went back to work I had my son was eight at the time, just
barely eight, and, uh, we put him in Amrein's Day Care, after.

B.144:  Uh-huh, I've heard that,

A.145:  After,

B.146:  they were very good.

A.147:  Well, [lipsmack] that's why we picked it, because they were, were supposed
to be real great, and, you know, I think they were fine, but the thing is he
was in school all day,

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  in second grade, in, in Plano, it's open classroom situation where they
don't have walls,

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders [laughter],

B.152:  [Laughter] Oh.

A.153:  in the same area with no walls.  And, uh, and then he'd get on the
Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's and then there would be a whole ton of other
kids, all in the same room, you know,

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  you know what fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go
outside for awhile, they had snacks and story time and everything.  But, it
was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of #being
able to get home at two thirty.#

B.156:  #Poor kid was in school all day.  Yeah.#

A.157:  Yeah.

B.158:  Yeah.

A.159:  Because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed
being able to be by himself,

B.160:  #Uh-huh.#

A.161:  #and having# some [children] peace and quiet #or, you know.#

B.162:  #Uh-huh.#  Even at that age they need that time,

A.163:  Yes.

B.164:  we all need that time,

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  just some quiet time to wind down from the day.

A.167:  Right.  That's exactly it.  So, another thing that we tried to do, I, I
know your son's too young right now, but we're trying,, we tried to sign him
up for after school scouts and,

B.168:  Yeah, yeah.

A.169:  stuff like that and,

B.170:  I think that's really important,

A.171:  Yeah.

B.172:  and we've already started about, you know, I mean, how young can they
start T-Ball and soccer?  [Laughter].

A.173:  Right [laughter].

B.174:  You know, I mean, I just, you know, we both think of that that as just so
important,

A.175:  #It is.#

B.176:  #to get# him involved in stuff like that and,

A.177:  It is.  #And,# 

B.178:  #you# could hardly wait, I mean, he's, he's so much fun now,

A.179:  #Yeah.#

B.180:  #he's really,# he's really starting to get lots of fun and I can't wait
until stuff like that starts happening --

A.181:  #I bet, yeah.# 

B.182:  -- #you know, and,# you know, we did the Easter egg hunts,

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  which was really the first year he was really able to  --

A.185:  Un-, understand.

B.186:  -- and to know what we wan-, know what he was doing --

A.187:  Yeah.

B.188:  -- you know, and enjoy it, and it was so much fun and gosh he went a couple
of weekends ago and rode an elephant and, God --

A.189:  #Oh, my gosh.  You're kidding.#

B.190:  -- #he got up on this elephant all by himself# and Lord, I couldn't
believe it.

A.191:  #You're kidding.#

B.192:  #They had so much fun.#  [Laughter].

A.193:  Oh, that's great.

B.194:  I bought us tickets and stood there in line and I thought, I'm going to end
up on this elephant with him [laughter],

A.195:  [Laughter].

B.196:  you know, [laughter].  He did it by himself,

A.197:  [Laughter].  #Well, good for him.#

B.198:  #so stuff like that is# starting to come along where it's really,

A.199:  Uh-huh.

B.200:  getting fun,

A.201:  #Uh-huh.#

B.202:  #you know.#

A.203:  Yeah.

B.204:  Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he like comes
home with something new everyday, #you know and so,#

A.205:  #Well, that's great.#  #That's so good.#

B.206:  #I know,# I know they're working with him and he's excited to get there
in the morning,

A.207:  Uh-huh.

B.208:  and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye.  It's just like #bye, and
he goes running,#

A.209:  #He's out of there.#

B.210:  you know, and he's always having fun when I pick him up so, you know.
Yeah, this, this day care is, is,

A.211:  Uh-huh.

B.212:  it's Bright Steps in Lewisville.  And,

A.213:  #Uh-huh.#

B.214:  #whenever# you say Bright Steps, everybody goes, oh, I've heard that's
the best day care in town, you know,

A.215:  Yeah?  #Good.#

B.216:  #and it's,# it's one of those that's very hard to get into.

A.217:  Uh-huh.

B.218:  and they have, this, this, this woman owns three day cares, two
in Lewisville and one in Irving.

A.219:  Uh-huh.

B.220:  and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because,

A.221:  Uh-huh.

B.222:  her waiting list was just like, you know, like a year old, #it was
ridiculous.#

A.223:  #Oh, my gosh.#

B.224:  And, she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other.

A.225:  No kidding.

B.226:  Yes, so its, 

A.227:  She knows something right, that she (( )) and,

B.228:  She knows what she's doing, all the teachers, like about half the teachers
are degreed teachers.

A.229:  Yeah, that makes such a #difference.#

B.230:  #Oh,# it makes a huge #difference.#

A.231:  #That's the way# it is at my daughter's nursery school too.

B.232:  Uh-huh.

A.233:  And I think that really makes a difference.

B.234:  Yeah.

A.235:  They're in it because it's a profession,

B.236:  #That's right.  That's right.#

A.237:  #not because it's a job they could get# because they didn't qualify
for anything else, #you know#.

B.238:  #That's right.#  And, his old day care as much as I loved it, you know,

A.239:  Uh-huh.

B.240:  and the owner, I really liked her and she worked really hard to get good
people, but the people that she got --

A.241:  Uh-huh.

B.242:  -- were there because they weren't qualified
to do anything else --

A.243:  Uh-huh.

B.244:  -- you know.

A.245:  Right.

B.246:  And, and I got lucky and all of his teachers were,

A.247:  [Laughter] Because, because, 

B.248:  very good.

A.249:  Right.  Some, sometimes that's fine, that's great, #you know.#

B.250:  #Yeah,# but then sometimes, #you know,# 

A.251:  #Sometimes it isn't.#  You just have to.

B.252:  Yeah.

A.253:  Well, is it real expensive then?

B.254:  Um, it just went up the first of this month.  I'm paying,

A.255:  Uh-huh.

B.256:  uh, seventy nine dollars a week for now.  #So,#

A.257:  #Wow.#

B.258:  It's a little high,

A.259:  #Yeah.#

B.260:  #but, but# it's, you know, it's like where he was before I was only
paying sixty three, so there's quite a little jump #there,#

A.261:  #Right.#  Right.

B.262:  but, I looked all over Lewisville, I looked in every day care there was
--

A.263:  Uh-huh.

B.264:  -- in Lewisville, and,

A.265:  Uh-huh.

B.266:  you know, and there were places that were cheaper, but #is it,#

A.267:  #No.#

B.268:  you know, your peace of mind is worth a little bit of #money,#

A.269:  #Yeah.#

B.270:  you know, and I have peace of mind,

A.271:  [Noise].

B.272:  where he is --

A.273:  Uh-huh.

B.274:  -- and some of those other places I wouldn't have.

A.275:  That's exactly it.  See, we do the same thing, since Galen goes to nursery
school,

B.276:  [Child].

A.277:  we pay our, our home care provider, for our day care provider, full time
for a whole week, but she, she's gone three mornings.  Galen just doesn't go
there three #mornings a week.#

B.278:  #Yeah,# yeah.

A.279:  But, I said to her, I said, you know, it doesn't matter if for whatever
re-, when school holidays come around, I used to have such a problem with
that.

B.280:  Uh-huh.

A.281:  They wouldn't have anything to do.  I'd either have to {voices fade},
