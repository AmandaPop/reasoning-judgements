REMARKS:        Speaker A sounds like she's washing dishes or something, 
throughout the conversation.  I have noted when the noises are the loudest.  
The noises sound like water going down a drain and pouring water back and 
forth between glasses, and the loudest noises sound like banging or scraping 
plastic dishes on a counter.

===========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of lawn and garden work do you do?  [noise].

B.2:  Well, right now the place where I'm living, the yard was basically
neglected for about the last twenty-five years, [breathing] so I've been
trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn, and after three years of
working at it, I've, I've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing
{pause} help out things to the lawn has really brought it back.  Instead of
mowing in the same direction every time, changing, one day you'll, or one time
you'll cut it, cut the lawn the long way, then you'll go the opposite way,
instead of going lengthways, you go width, and it helps the grass come back.

A.3:  [Noise] Oh, does it really?  I didn't know that [noise].  Did, um, you've
been working on it for three years?

B.4:  Thr-, f-, for three years. 

A.5:  Really?  What have you done?  [/noise].

B.6:  Killing lots of fire ants. 

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  I was firmly convinced the entire, 

A.9:  [Noise].

B.10:  front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound.  

A.11:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.12:  Because it was like, you could, you couldn't even stand still out there.

A.13:  [Noise] You know, I can barely hear you [/noise].

B.14:  Is this better? 

A.15:  Yeah, a little bit, yeah [noise]. 

B.16:  It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something, you'd just be
standing still.

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  And the ants would start crawling up your legs.  It's like, [laughter] I'm
not standing in a mound, though.

A.19:  Oh, wow.  How did you get rid of them? 

B.20:  Uh, Dursban Two. 

A.21:  Pardon?

B.22:  A chemical called Dursban Two, 

A.23:  [Noise] Oh, Dursban Two, 

B.24:  it's a crystal.

A.25:  yeah, Dursban will get rid of just about anything, I think.  But um, so
you haven't had a problem with that, since?

B.26:  Um, not bad.  Every,

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  once in a while you'll have a mound pop up, but that's, gon-, to be
expected.

A.29:  What else did it , did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to?

B.30:  Um, 

A.31:  Not really.

B.32:  as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to.
Even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds --

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  -- it didn't kill it.

A.35:  Really?  Well, that's pretty wild.  Yeah, we used it for fleas.  We had
fleas in our yard real bad last year, and we did that um, I just, I'm not,
basically, I like to mow the lawn, believe it or not, but I sometimes have
problems starting the mower, so a lot of times I won't get out and do it, but
my husband, [noise] basically, does most of it, and he does the, you know,
edging and all that kind of thing, and we're renting, and so we don't really
put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like this lawn could probably stand
[noise] a couple of loads of dirt, and some Saint Augustine.  We just, we have
winter rye out back, and we have, I don't even know what it is out front,
[laughter] but, um, we, this is the first house we've ever lived in, and we're
just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, I guess, huh?  So,
it, anyway, 

B.36:  Well, 

A.37:  [Beep].

B.38:  you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard? 

A.39:  Right [/beep].  Uh-huh.  We were getting,

B.40:  Uh, I found one thing that, it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on
the lawn, but,

A.41:  [Noise].

B.42:  every time I've done it, it's got-, it, it drives the fleas completely
out of the area.

A.43:  What? 

B.44:  Powdered sulphur. 

A.45:  Oh, really?  Hm, I wonder why it does? 

B.46:  You, you don't have to put a whole lot out, just if you've got a broadcast
spreader --

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  -- I think it comes in a forty-pound bag, and it's real fine, like flour --

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  -- and you just --

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  -- go out, and do the entire yard, and you, I mean, you don't have to put
clumps of it, just very lightly cover the entire yard.

A.53:  Really?  Well, I'll have to remember that, because hopefully we won't have
them this year, but we have a cat that comes in and out, and the cat was
getting, um, fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house, so we had a real
problem last year with fleas, and uh, [noise] it was quite a drag [noise]
because, um, [noise] we got them in our house, and [laughter] we're
Christians, and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas, and we got rid
of them, [noise] believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which is just about
impossible to do, but we did, [/noise] and so we don't want them back this
year, you know?  [laughter] so I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in
the yard.  [breathing] we're almost, [breathing] they were so bad last year,
even ticks.  I don't know, we've had ticks before a lot, and we've had to get
out and treat our lawn for that.  I think we used [noise] Dursban for the, we
used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do [laughter] with
that thing, you know, and spread it all out everywhere, but that's about the
extent of our lawn care.  So, I don't know, do you enjoy doing it?  [/noise]
[breathing].

B.54:  Oh, I love it.  My wife can't understand it'd be a hundred degrees outside,
I'll be out there.  {imitating wife's voice} But it's too hot to be working in
the yard.

A.55:  [Breathing].

B.56:  I'm under the trees, I'm having fun, {pause} and I'm stopping to drink
water, so what's the problem?  [laughter].

A.57:  [Breathing] Yeah, [noise] well that's, well that's funny.  Yeah, not
everybody enjoys it, though.  Everybody has a different thing.  I kind of
enjoy it and my husband doesn't [laughter].  I kind of have to, [noise]
sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it, and he, you know, he
doesn't really enjoy doing it, but he'll do it, and he doesn't gripe about it
or anything, but, [/noise] you know, I'm kind of like you and he's kind of
like your wife.  I mean, you know, in that he doesn't really enjoy it, but I
would like to have a garden, you know, that's my thing, [breathing] but right
now where we're living we have the trees where their, uh, roots are at the top
of the ground everywhere over the ground.  I don't know what kind of trees
they are, but [breathing] you can't have a garden, you can't till it, or
it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller [breathing].  So we're going to wait until
we move.  We don't have a lot of sun, either, because it's big trees back
there.  So we're going to wait, and when we move that's one of our priorities,
[breathing] is to get a house where we can have a, uh, garden.  And so I'd
like to do that.  I have a feeling I'll be out there all the time [laughter]
taking care of that, but that's our next thing [smack].  Do you have a garden?

B.58:  I've got, the, this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at.

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  Sitting on about a two acre lot now, and half of it's, the back half is my
garden.

A.61:  [Breathing] [noise] Oh, are you kidding?  That sounds fun.  Where do you
all live?

B.62:  Uh, in Missouri City.  

A.63:  Oh, really, wh-,

B.64:  Southwest, southwest side of Houston. 

A.65:  Southwest where? 

B.66:  Southwest Houston. 

A.67:  Oh, really?  Oh, because we're in Dallas.  I guess I assumed you were here.
Well, that's neat.  And, um, yeah that's what we want.  We have a, yeah,
that's really what we want, but we just haven't been able to do that yet, so
one day we'll be able to do it, and I'm excited about it.  And then I don't
know anything about it, I have to learn, and then you'll have to give me a
call on gardening [laughter].

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  [Laughter] What do you do in your garden, and I'll go nothing, what should
I do?  But [breathing] anyway, I guess that's about it though.  It sounds like
we've covered all the bases [breathing] so I guess we'll let you go, and,
[breathing] um, do you have anything else you wanted to say?

B.70:  Uh, no, it's just,

A.71:  Okay.

B.72:  I've had an en-, very enjoyable conversation with you. 

A.73:  I know, you too.  I hope you have a nice day, and --

B.74:  Okay, you too. 

A.75:  -- we'll talk to you later. 

B.76:  Okay.  #Bye.#

A.77:  #Bye.#
