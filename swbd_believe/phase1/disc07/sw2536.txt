=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, how do you use your credit cards? 

B.2:  Um, I use them carefully I guess, um, 

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  I, uh, I usually don't, I usually use them to consolidate billing.

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  Uh, for convenience sakes.  But I usually just pay them off at the end of
the month.

A.7:  Yeah, especially what I do.

B.8:  I don't, I don't, avoid the finance charges, uh, as high as they are.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  I don't, uh --

A.11:  Ridiculously high.  

B.12:  -- don't, you know, I don't let them carry over, you #know,#

A.13:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.14:  I, I've been lucky I guess.  I haven't had a bills big enough where I
couldn't pay them off at the end of the month.  #But, uh,#

A.15:  #Well, so,#

B.16:  I try to, try to live within a budget, you know, and so, I keep that in
mind I just don't, you know, I guess it takes self-restraint when you have a
credit card to know that, that there's, re-, you really have to pay these
things off.

A.17:  Yeah, plus a lot more. 

B.18:  Plus a lot more, you know, and you got to realize that there's only this
much money in the bank and if you're going to live, you know,

A.19:  Yeah, #well,#

B.20:  #if# you're not going to try to, you know, say, well, pay it off sometime
in the future.

A.21:  Yeah, for so many years I was so deep in debt on credit cards and I finally
dug my way out of them --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- and that was enough to teach me, you know, you just, I can do without
them.

B.24:  Right.  ((Well)), some people ha-, a, rip theirs up just because they, you
know,

A.25:  #Yeah.# 

B.26:  #they# can't resist them. 

A.27:  I got rid of a lot of them, especially the ones where I paid fees.

B.28:  Right. 

A.29:  Uh, kept the ones that were free. 

B.30:  Right. 

A.31:  And basically the same thing, I use them if I'm running short of cash and
there's something I want or,

B.32:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.33:  #sa-,# a sale or,

B.34:  #Right.#

A.35:  #when I# travel I use them. 

B.36:  I use them to float sometimes,

A.37:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.38:  #if it's near# the end of the month, and you know, and you know I don't
have a check coming in a few days,

A.39:  #Yeah, it's about,# 

B.40:  #I'll go ahead# and, and charge it knowing that the money will be there --

A.41:  Yeah, that's what I do. 

B.42:  -- by the time the bill comes. 

A.43:  Yeah, if there's running into a cash short or something, there's some
things some purchases I make that I will do always on credit card just so I
have a record of them.  Just like when I take all my cats down to the vet I
always pay that on credit card.

B.44:  Uh-huh, right.  You know, we go out to eat a lot of times. 

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  I don't like to carry a lot of cash with me. 

A.47:  Huh-uh. 

B.48:  ((Yeah, I have)) so, I just carry my credit card and, and ((answer)) things
like that.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  As long as I know, you know, that I'm, I'm not over doing it, it's, uh,

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  And yeah, I have, I have, what, I have two credit cards, that's all I use.
I'm always getting stuff in the mail all the time.

A.53:  Yeah, yeah, I,

B.54:  You are a preferred such and such, and #you are,#

A.55:  #Yeah, you're, you're# already approved. 

B.56:  you're #already approved.# 

A.57:  #Then it's back.#  I, uh, for the longest time I, I'd gotten rid of my gas
credit cards, and then all of a sudden I started getting a flurry of these
things so I, I did, I have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple
months.

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  But, uh,

B.60:  Sometimes they just send them to you and say here, have a credit card
[laughter].

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  I have that one. 

A.63:  Oh, do you?  Yeah. 

B.64:  Yeah, I just ripped, I just cut it up and threw it away, but you know, they
had already,

A.65:  Oh, you should have used it, you wouldn't have been liable for the payment.

B.66:  Is that right? 

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  Huh.  I didn't #know that.# 

A.69:  #They, yeah,# they send you card that,

B.70:  That you didn't want.  

A.71:  that, you didn't apply for, it's yours. 

B.72:  Is that right? 

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Huh. 

A.75:  Of course, they could always stick something in the credit bureau
[laughter],

B.76:  That's right, that's right.  They could, they can make your life miserable
if they want to.

A.77:  Sure, yeah, I had a, I had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago,

B.78:  Is #that right?#  

A.79:  #uh, and I,# I tore up their card and sent it to them and now I've got
another one [laughter].

B.80:  [Laughter] we don't have too many Exxon stations out this way.

A.81:  Oh, really, what you got out there? 

B.82:  We've got lots of Mobile. 

A.83:  Mobiles, yeah.

B.84:  Mobiles are big and we have a few Exxon, we've got some other ones like
Citgo,

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  Yeah, is a, is a one,

A.87:  Yeah, well, I don't think, I don't think we've got a Citgo here in Raleigh,
no matter of fact I know we don't.

B.88:  Yeah, got some Shell stations --

A.89:  Um,

B.90:  -- a few Texaco stations. 

A.91:  We have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas,

B.92:  {Very faint} #Uh-huh.#

A.93:  #but they're# not Citgo stations, I guess,

B.94:  #Right.#  

A.95:  #the biggies# around here are Exxon, Texaco, and, um, well, gosh, that's
about it, D P, I guess.

B.96:  And there's another local one I can't, I can't remember what, there's some
few Sinclair stations.

A.97:  Gosh, I haven't seen a Sinclair station in years. 

B.98:  Yeah, the few ((with)) the green dinosaur --

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  -- they're, they're, they're,

A.101:  #Gosh,# --

B.102:  #logo.# 

A.103:  -- there used to, when I was a, when I was a kid there was a Sinclair
station about three blocks away, that's where I used to go to pump up my tires
and get my flats fixed and all of that.

B.104:  Yeah, there's not that many down here but, you know, once, once in a while
you'll see one.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  I guess they're still in business. 

A.107:  Just barely I guess. 

B.108:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.109:  Well, guess,

B.110:  You ever, you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they,
they've charged, charged you for something you didn't, didn't, didn't
purchase.

A.111:  No, uh, I, I've, nope, I've never had that.  

B.112:  Yeah, I have,

A.113:  I, I did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago,

B.114:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.115:  #when I first got# started in a business.  Um, they got my name, of
course,

B.116:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.117:  #and I said, yeah,# this will be handy because I can use this for all my
business expenses.  So, I used it, went on a, went on a trip and used it, got
the bill and paid it.  About three weeks later I get this nasty letter from
them saying you haven't paid, you're overdue.  Pay it.

B.118:  Right. 

A.119:  So, I ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail.

B.120:  #Right.# 

A.121:  #About# two weeks after that I get a phone call,

B.122:  #From someone saying,#

A.123:  #say you are really overdue,# you need to pay this thing.

B.124:  Uh-huh.  

A.125:  And I said, what are you talking about.  I've already paid you, and by that
time the bank statement had come in, and I had the canceled check.

B.126:  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  So, they said, okay, we'll take care of it.  Two weeks later I get another
nasty letter threatening legal action.

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  So, I sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card
cut up into about a hundred pieces.  I said here is your card, here is the
copy of my canceled check, never send me anything else.  I never heard from
them,

B.130:  #Uh-huh,#  

A.131:  #but I just,# 

B.132:  somebody blew #it.# 

A.133:  #Yeah,# I just, you know, I ain't got time to mess around with them.

B.134:  Right. 

A.135:  Too many people want my money out there, 

B.136:  {Very faint} #Right.#

A.137:  #I don't# have to pay somebody to take it. 

B.138:  Do you have the Discover card? 

A.139:  No, I don't.  I,

B.140:  Ne-, #neither do I.# 

A.141:  #I kept wa-,# I kept thinking about getting it but I just don't use the
things enough to justify getting it.

B.142:  They, they I don't know, I don't know how anybody can fall into this, you
get cash back,

A.143:  Uh-huh.  

B.144:  and buy into that because all they're giving you back is a little bit of
the #interest,#

A.145:  #That's right,# that's right,  

B.146:  you #paid in.#  

A.147:  #you're paying,# you're paying a higher interest rate so they can,

B.148:  #Yeah, their interest,#

A.149:  #rebate you two percent# of it. 

B.150:  Right, their interest rate's twenty-two percent. 

A.151:  Uh-huh. 

B.152:  Higher than any other #ones,#

A.153:  #That's right.# 

B.154:  and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money.

A.155:  Yeah, right.  

B.156:  How about like,

A.157:  And In the meantime for that entire year they've got the use of that money,

B.158:  #Right.# 

A.159:  #uh, yeah,# it's,

B.160:  It, it's a rip-off.

A.161:  Oh, it is, I, there's so,

B.162:  But a lot of people think it's wonderful, I guess, said they're, they're
doing well, everything I've read they've been getting,

A.163:  #Well, ((I)),#

B.164:  #a, more market# share, I guess they're, they're advertising and
promotions and,

A.165:  Uh, Americas, Americans are suckers. 

B.166:  I guess so. 

A.167:  They don't know how to sit there and look,

B.168:  #Yeah.#

A.169:  #at the interest rate# and say, well, this one is only sixteen percent,

B.170:  #Uh-huh.#

A.171:  #and this one's# twenty-two, huh. 

B.172:  Yeah, I have a, on my credit cards I have a grace period if I pay it off
within,

A.173:  Yeah. I,

B.174:  when the bill comes ((I)), I don't have to owe any interest.

A.175:  Yeah, right that's,

B.176:  And, uh, 

A.177:  I've only got, I've only got two, uh, two cards now, 

B.178:  {Very faint} #right.#

A.179:  #I've got a Bank of# Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard,

B.180:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.181:  #and,# and that's it.  

B.182:  Uh-huh.

A.183:  I mean, I don't need anything else now. 

B.184:  Yeah, once in a while, uh, my, I have an American Express they have
((Visa)) in a buyer protection #thing,#

A.185:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.186:  where, uh, they extend the warranty.

A.187:  Yeah.

B.188:  So, uh, they both can be nice around Christmas #time,#

A.189:  #Yeah.# 

B.190:  and stuff, if you're going to buy a T V or, uh,

A.191:  Yeah, so-, 

B.192:  or, uh, p-, #electronic.#

A.193:  #something like# that.  

B.194:  Then,

A.195:  My roommate really believes in American Express.  He's got the green ca-,
or the gold card and the, the Optima card and,

B.196:  #And everything, huh?# 

A.197:  #he just, he just thinks# they're terrific. 

B.198:  Uh-huh.  

A.199:  And I sit there and say, yeah, look what you pay for that every year.

B.200:  He pays for that, yeah, 

A.201:  #Yeah.#

B.202:  #a couple# hundred bucks probably for that like hike, high ((in card)).

A.203:  Gosh. 

B.204:  Well, if you have the money, I guess [laughter]. 

A.205:  Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm thinking myself,

B.206:  Get what you pay for, huh? 

A.207:  Really.  Yeah, you know, he's, he's impressed because they send you this
nice statement every, I guess, it's every year.  They itemize all your
purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that,
yeah, it's a nice report but is it worth, you know, is it worth sixty bucks a
year.

B.208:  For that little,

A.209:  For that report. 

B.210:  Right. 

A.211:  [Laughter] don't be crazy. 

B.212:  Yeah.

A.213:  Uh, when I was over in England I, I picked up that, uh, Bank of Scotland
Visa card, and I, I don't know, har-, I don't ever use it except when I want
to play the currency market.  #Um,#

B.214:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.215:  that's, that's when it becomes handy, because if I know that, you know,
if the, if the, uh, if the pound is high, I can buy more dollar things,

B.216:  #Right.#  

A.217:  #for what# I'm getting,

B.218:  #Right.#  

A.219:  #and then# if, if I think the rate's going to drop, then I pay them back in
less dollars.

B.220:  Right.  

A.221:  And it, it's worked out most of the times I'm, I'm usually pretty good on
calling the, the currency market.

B.222:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, a lot of people do that for a living, I #guess,#

A.223:  #Yeah.# 

B.224:  trade money. 

A.225:  Yeah, I, I did it [throat_clearing] when I lived over there I did it
quite often.

B.226:  Uh-huh.  

A.227:  Um, and I, I really had a racket going because, uh, my paycheck was being,
uh, electronically deposited here in the states.  And the bank that I banked
with, I could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me
instant credit for it,

B.228:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.229:  #so,# and, and I, and ov-, and over the course of a year I, I figured out
how long it took them to clear that check and the, and the shortest period of
time was eight days.

B.230:  Huh.

A.231:  So, generally about eight, days before payday, depending on what the
currency markets were doing, I would go up and start buying.  I'd, I'd start
cashing in my checks for pounds.

B.232:  Right.  

A.233:  And then by the time,

B.234:  The other check went through.  

A.235:  It, th-, it, the rate was either down or up depending on what I was doing,
and i-, it was great.  I mean, I, I could,

B.236:  Made a little extra money there, huh?

A.237:  Yeah, I mean, one day, you know, I might be able to get ...
