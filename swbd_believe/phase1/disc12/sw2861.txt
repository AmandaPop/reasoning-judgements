A.1:  Okay, what kind of home do you have?

@B.2:  Well, we, we bought more than we can afford. 

A.3:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.4:  And, uh, so we're in a fairly, uh, [barking]  exclusive neighborhood and,

A.5:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.6:  # and # got a [barking]  big house five thousand square feet with,

A.7:  # Wow.  #

B.8:  # a # bunch of kids running around,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # and # horrible real estate taxes,

A.11:  # Oh, really? #

B.12:  # and, and # everything else.  So it's about all we can afford
[baby_crying].

A.13:  Yeah, I know what, well, mine's, I guess I live in a upper middle class
type home or neighborhood.  Uh, most of them are all professionals in the
neighborhood.  Uh, I live by myself.  What I, uh, I have more than I need.  I
have a two story home which I don't need, but --

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  -- uh, I got it as a steal, the property ta-, I mean property in Texas, you
know, I bought, uh, came, I used to live in Texas and I moved to Florida for
four years and I moved back and when I moved back was in a slump and so I
really stole this house for, you know, for peanuts [breathing].  It was a, one
of those corporate buy outs.  A couple had, had moved in it, lived here three
months and, and got transferred to, uh, Atlanta.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  So, their corporation was trying to sell it.  You know, they just want to
get rid of it, so they took and offer I gave them, which was very low.  I know
the neighbors probably hated me [laughter] because it kind of ruined the
resale, you know I think what though, the average, I think we just ((killed
the)) sale, but we don't have too many homes for sale in this area because
it's, it is growing and building fast.

B.18:  Well, that's interesting because I, I've, I heard around Dallas that, uh,
real estate was up for grabs. 

A.19:  Yeah, it's, it's improving.  Now where I live, I live out by D F W airport,

B.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.21:  # and, # uh, it's really growing like mad.  I mean they're just building
and they're [breathing], I'm talking two and three hundred thousand dollar
homes, uh, and they're just building them, y-, faster than people can move in
them.  And that, you know, I understand the, the slump in the market didn't
af-, didn't affect that price range on because those people are going to buy,
you know, whether it's, you know, rich people like that are going to buy, you
know.

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  There, it's the, the middle income people, I think, and the lower middle
income they're, that are hurting, you know, the sixty and seventy thousand
dollar homes that are hard to get rid of.  But, and then I've heard pros, it
ha-, it's picking up, though, now.  It has,

B.24:  Well, we've sort of got the other end of the spectrum going here.  The, uh,
we had Mobil Oil Corporation move their corporate headquarters here about five
years ago --

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  -- and I bought this house, uh, just before they moved down --

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  -- and when they moved in here, the price on houses just about doubled. 

A.29:  Did it really?

B.30:  All over the area. 

A.31:  Huh. 

B.32:  And, uh,

A.33:  # That tells you something.  #

B.34:  # so we, we got # ours at a, a fairly good price --

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  -- but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  And so, we've got a lot of houses within a, a few miles of us that are one
million, million and a half --

A.39:  Yeah, I, I know, I do, too. 

B.40:  -- and, uh,

A.41:  It helps, though.  It helps the ((value)) of your property. 

B.42:  Yeah, it helps the value of our property, except we,

A.43:  It helps makes your taxes go up, too, though. 

B.44:  Except we had a neighbor here just about gave his house away --

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  -- uh, he sold it for only slightly more than he paid for it, uh, four,
five years.

A.47:  Really?

B.48:  And, uh, so he's kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while,

A.49:  # Yeah.  #

B.50:  # until # that, that average goes out. 

A.51:  Yeah, right. 

B.52:  But, an awful lot of these fancy homes are not selling. 

A.53:  Yeah, oh, really?

B.54:  Because they built them and put all this money into them and nobody's
interested in buying. 

A.55:  Oh, okay.  Well, boy, they're sure buying them here, grabbing them up.  It,
they're gorgeous homes, but, th-, I've never seen so many two story homes and
they're really building a lot of two stories.  All of the really fancy ones
are all two story.  You just don't find any sprawled out one story homes
anymore.  For some reason they're just, [breathing], and, boy the area I live
in is really, really growing fast.  In fact, they're just fixing to
[breathing] right behind me was a, a house sat behind my property, it was on
fourteen acres it was just a kind of a nice little brick home, [breathing] had
some horses and, you know, and a developer bought them out about six months
ago and so they were going to build some really nice, nice homes back there,
which will, you know, really help my house, [breathing] but like I said,
except for my taxes are going to go up because of these nice homes, you know,
I, they're going to jack the prices up, you know,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # so, # I mean taxes, so we end up probably having to pay more taxes but,

B.58:  Well, they're doing some, some strange things here.  I think that the price
of real estate's gotten so high and they're trying to get the value out of the
homes so, they subdivide around here.  They'll put a million dollar home on a
half acre lot. 

A.59:  Oh, do they?

B.60:  And, you know, you put a five thousand square foot house on, on a half acre
lot or one a-, you know,

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # half # acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors. 

A.63:  Yeah [laughter], right.  Man we have some, in Dallas has some of those zero
lot line homes are, you know, five hundred thousand dollar homes sitting on a
zero lot line.  You, you can, you know, wave at your neighbor, you know and
hear their stere-, well, they build them really where you can't hear them.
They put the living areas opposite one another, so I guess it's all right.  I
don't know.  I, I have a la-, I have an enormous backyard, a really, much,
much more than I can take care of, which I don't, I have it done because I
can't a-, [breathing] I tried taking care of it myself the first year I moved
here and I said, I'll go without groceries, but I'm going to have my yard
done.  I just, I can't do it.  You know,

B.64:  # [Laughter].  #

A.65:  # it # just wasn't worth it, [laughter]  so, I have it done and I, it's a
best money I've ever spent --

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  -- having it done.  And it's just so regular and I just, just don't have to
worry about it. 

B.68:  Well, sometimes it, uh, keeping after the yard gets me, we enjoy sailing
quite a bit --

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- and sometimes we go off on a one week cruise --

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  -- and I come back it's rained quite a bit while we're gone,

A.73:  # Oh.  #

B.74:  # I # can hardly find the house [laughter]. 

A.75:  Yeah, I know.  I know when I lived in Florida, my mother visited me, she
says, you know, you can almost watch your grass grow down here can't you, and
I said, yes, you can.  I mean it just grew and, I could have mowed it twice a
week down there if I had the inclination, which I didn't.  But, uh, that's
when I started, and when I lived in Florida I had my yard done down there,
too.  It was, the humidity was so bad that, I just, I couldn't get out there
and do it as much as I wanted to.

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  I like yard work, no I don't.  If I did, I'd do it.  Uh, if I had to, I
would do it, I'll put it that way.  I don't have to, so I don't do it.  But if
I had to, I, I bought myself, I bought the, the best of equipment, I said if
I'm going to do it I'm going to get myself a good lawn mower and get all the
bells and whistles, and, and I did, [breathing] and now it sits out in the
garage and hasn't been running in over two years.

B.78:  Um. 

A.79:  But, uh, but, everybody in the neighborhood keeps a very nice yard, thank
goodness. 

B.80:  Yeah, that's one of the things I have to face up to.  There's, uh, quite a
few retired people in our neighborhood --

A.81:  Oh.  okay. 

B.82:  -- and it seems like all they have to do is, is go out there and put down
lime and spread fertilizer,

A.83:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.84:  # and # pull up dandelions,

A.85:  # I know it [laughter].  #

B.86:  # and take care of # their lawn as, beautiful lawn, and I come over and
look at my lawn and,

A.87:  # I know it [laughter].  #

B.88:  # this, nicely cut crabgrass # and, uh, dandelions and plantains and
everything else under the sun coming up. 

A.89:  Oh, I know. 

B.90:  The, uh,

A.91:  But, you know, usually there, in this, uh, new, I've got one on this,
there's usually one neighbor in the, in, on a block that d-, doesn't take care
of their yard as, or doesn't do anything to the yard and I keep thinking, why
do th-, people buy homes if they're not going to keep their yard.  Why don't
you stay in an apartment?  If you're not going to touch your yard, you're not
going to, you know, you just ruin it for everybody else, I think.  I know
where my daughter lives, there's a woman that lives behind them, [breathing]
that the yard has never been watered and she lives in a real nice neighborhood
and it, it's, I saw it for the first time this morning, what a eyesi-, eyesore
that was, I said, I'd run her out.  That's a shame that somebody let their
yard, she has poison ivy growing over her garage.

B.92:  Um. 

A.93:  Can you believe poison i-, and she's got children.  And it's just, oh,
[breathing]  what an eyesore.  Terrible [breathing].  But, no, I, I really do
like my neighborhood.  It's close enough to D F W, I can be to the airport in
ten minutes, but I can't hear the planes flying.  I can see them, uh, from
upstairs I can almost watch them land on the runway --

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  -- but I can't hear them for some reason and, uh, uh, I like living real
close to an airport because when I get home from a trip I want to get home.  I
don't want to drive forty-five minutes, you know, after I get home.  I want to
be home.  So I, I always choose to live by an airport [talking].  In Orlando, I
did the same thing.  I lived right by the airport so I could get right home. 

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  And the, the noise isn't real, I say I can't hear this, and when I lived in
Orlando I couldn't hear the airplanes either.  I guess if I lived right on the
flight pattern it would be different but, uh, I don't.  I like, I like to
watch airplanes.  Fact, I can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes
coming in D F W and I, I know if they're two seconds apart, I just watch the
lights come over.  They must come all in from the same pattern.

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  And I can just lay there and just, just watch one come past the, the roof
line of the people across the h-, street from me and, uh, just like, seem like
every two seconds, I'll see them come in from about, you know, nine o'clock to
ten fifteen, they're just streaming in. 

B.100:  Is that your version of counting sheep?

A.101:  Yeah [laughter].  I guess so. 

B.102:  [Laughter]. 

A.103:  Must be.  They, I hadn't thought of that but I guess it is.  And sometimes
I have, uh, come downstairs at night and used my telephone downstairs if it
rings and, uh, and I look out my kitchen window and there must be thirty
airplanes circling above.  Not over my house, but over D F W --

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  -- it's the weirdest looking sign, I thought my, I guess they're, I don't
know why they're all circling.  I guess they're but, it's weird looking, so
many lights up in the sky. 

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  But I, I it's interesting, uh, I like to look at airplanes. 

B.108:  Well, we're kind of fortunate, we right about halfway between National
Airport and Dulles --

A.109:  Oh ((are you))?

B.110:  -- and so, they've, uh, sort of established sort of a no man's land here --

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  -- and so we don't get any traffic from Dulles over the house and we don't
get any traffic from, uh, National. 

A.113:  Oh, okay. 

B.114:  And but, you can sit in the backyard and you can watch the planes, uh --

A.115:  Yeah, that's nice. 

B.116:  -- lining up for the approach. 

A.117:  I have a girlfriend lives in Alexandria, West, is it Virginia, Alexan-, she
works for the government.  She's a,

B.118:  Yeah that's, that's not, well that's about forty-five minute drive from
here. 

A.119:  Oh, is it?

B.120:  Yeah.
