========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  What kind of vacations do you [noise]  participate in?

B.2:  W-, well, when we were kids we went to, uh, Mexico a couple of times. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And we went to Carlsbad Caverns and, uh, Alamo --

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  -- and Oklahoma. 

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  And since then I've gone to, uh, well, I went to Mexico on one [barking] 
trip.  And I went to Lake Caddo. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  And, um,

A.11:  Have you ever been on a cruise before?

B.12:  Uh, no. 

A.13:  No?

B.14:  Nothing like that.  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  Uh, w-, w-, would you like to go on one, do you think?

B.16:  No.  I don't think so.  Because [barking],  because, uh, I like to fish
[popping]. 

A.17:  Oh [noise]. 

B.18:  And I camp out and stuff like that. 

A.19:  Well, they sure are a lot of fun.  They,

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # sure # do a lot, uh, good eating. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  If you like to eat, that's the place to g-, that's w-,

B.24:  # Yeah.  #

A.25:  # one # to go on.  I, it's the best eating in the world. 

B.26:  Oh, yeah. 

A.27:  Oh, I mean, it's nonstop.  The minute you get on the ship till you get off.
You can start eating and you can eat all night long if you want.  Fantastic.
I'm going to go to Europe in the, in the Fall.

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  And, I'm really looking forward to that.  I've always wanted to go and I
have a friend that's a, uh, flight attendant for American and her route is
[noise] London to Dallas.  So, she wants to go see England [noise] just
because she just flies in and flies out.  So, she d-, she knows London but she
doesn't know the rest (( )). So we're going to go to Wales and Scotland and
England.  I think that'll be fun.

B.30:  Is that in the spring, is that this Summer?

A.31:  Uh, we're going in the Fall,

B.32:  # Oh.  #

A.33:  # September, # October. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  And, uh, I think that'd be great.  Plus, like I say, I like, I like
cruises.  I'm going with my sister-in-law, I'm going on a cruise next summer,
uh, for about seven days.  And, uh, I'd, I haven't deci-, I've been to the
Bahamas, but I think I'd like to try the, uh, the Mexico one this year, the
Cozumel and --

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  -- Puerto Vallarta and, that route around like that I believe this next
time [noise].  But, the Bahama one is nice.  And if that's one of the b-,
cruise we can get on, I, I'll take it again because it was really a lot of
fun.

B.38:  And the water's real clear,

A.39:  # Oh, #

B.40:  # down # there. 

A.41:  just crystal, absolutely crystal clear.  The fish are just beautiful.  And
if you like snorkeling --

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  -- [Lipsmack]  Oh, just, you just can't beat it.  Uh, I love to snorkel. 
And the, the beaches are just snow white, absolutely snow white.  Have you ever
been to the West Coast of Florida?

B.44:  Um, no.  Just to Galveston. 

A.45:  Oh, well, the West Coast of Florida, all, all those beaches are snow white
like,

B.46:  # Uh.  #

A.47:  # that.  #

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  And the East Coast, you have to get down to Miami before they're any, you
know, before they're snow white.  But the West Coast is just beautiful,

B.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.51:  # and # not, I go, I moved here from Florida a couple of years ago, back
from, I was living in Texas.  I went to Florida and came back.  And, uh, oh,
I'm going to retire down there one of these years and it's going to be in, on
the West Coast of Florida because it's so gorgeous.

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  The s-, sand is just out of this, and it's just like s-, powdered sugar
around, uh, oh, Venice Beach and, Clearwater especially has beautiful,
beautiful snow white sand.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  It's really nice.  But, I grew up in Colorado so I don't care for the
mountains too much. 

B.56:  Huh. 

A.57:  Uh, and California, I'm a native Californian and they have mountains there.
My mother lives up in Northern California [lipsmack] They're nice to visit and
I didn't enjoy growing up in the mountains and, I'd rather go to the sun than
I would to the, to the mountains.  I mean, they're all right.  I don't like it
because I have to go now s-, to see me mother, I have to go to th-, the
mountains.  But,

B.58:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.59:  # if # I didn't have to [noise],  if I didn't have to go I would never go. 

B.60:  Did you ever go to Yosemite?

A.61:  Yes. 

B.62:  That's pretty isn't it?

A.63:  Yeah.  It is.  And,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # I've # been to, uh, of course, I grew up in Colorado where it was really
mountainous and,

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  beautiful.  But, when I go back visit it I'm really disappointed.  It, uh,
it doesn't, uh, I remember it as a child and it, it's nothing like what I
remembered as a child. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  It's so commercialized and I, it really [lipsmack] made me ki-, kind of
turn my stomach when I went back and saw how commercialized it had gotten.
But,

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  I'm not a camper outer, so I, you know, I, if you like to camp out, so
that's fine.  But,

B.72:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.73:  # I, # I don't like to camp out.  I like the luxuries too much [laughter]. 
I,

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  guess I'm s-, I am spoiled [breathing].  And I spoil myself I guess, so,

B.76:  And then in,

A.77:  I,

B.78:  in Colorado it's mostly streams and they've dammed up some of them now,

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  so, you know. 

A.81:  It just, you know, [lipsmack] Colorado just doesn't really show me anything
anymore so,

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  Now out in my, where my mother lives in Northern California is absolutely
[noise]  gorgeous.  I mean,

B.84:  # Yeah.  #

A.85:  # just # picture postcard gorgeous.  And it [noise], you know, it just, out
of sight.  But, uh, it's too, uh, I've got to be by a big city.  I, I can't
stand living that far away.  I fly up into Oregon and drive down to her house.

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  And, uh, so she's really way up there.  And that, [swallowing] that's how I
ge-, it's just too far away from a, a big city for me.  I got to have a
shopping malls and [laughter] what have you.

B.88:  And Northern California really is out in the boondocks,

A.89:  # Oh, #

B.90:  # isn't # it?

A.91:  boy, she is in m-, it's, it's a good twelve hour, hour drive just from San
Francisco on winding, winding, winding river roads. 

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  And [noise]  it's way on up past the wine country and everything is, like I
say,

B.94:  # But, #

A.95:  # it's # really gorgeous.  But,

B.96:  You fly in to Portland then?

A.97:  No.  Medford, Oregon. 

B.98:  Oh, they have a airport there?

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  And then drive down, it's about an, oh, an hour, hour and a half's drive
from Medford, Oregon.  But it's all mountain driving. 

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  And, fortunately, my sister picks me up, I don't have to drive it. 

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  Tried driving it once from San Francisco and that was a, [noise]  that was
very dumb [breathing].  I'll never try that again. 

B.106:  They have a, th-, they have a Coast Highway there don't they? Or,

A.107:  Well, this, uh, where my mother lives is, uh, ((it)) kind of in the middle
of the state up north #so.# 

B.108:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.109:  They're about an, an hour or two drive from the ocean, for [noise]  the
coast.  So, you could go up that way but it would be out, it would be out of
your way.  Better fr-, from, to go to her house at, like up through Redding and
[lipsmack]  on up that way. 

B.110:  Uh-huh. 

A.111:  And, uh,

B.112:  How far is it from Tahoe?

A.113:  Oh, gosh I don't know.  Four hours I think.  Four, no, I can't remember.
I, seem like it's eight hours s-, somebody told me.  It may,

B.114:  # Huh.  #

A.115:  # be, # [lipsmack] it may be twelve, so, I can't remember.  Mine, I know my
son went from Tahoe to over to their house, so, and he knows that I, I never
have gone there, so --

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  -- I don't know. 

B.118:  ((Master)) the mountains, too. 

A.119:  Yeah, it real, like I say, it really is gorgeous. 

B.120:  Uh-huh. 

A.121:  Uh, I, uh, [breathing]  I like the sunshine better.  I mean, I'd rather go
out where there's beaches and, I don't, I like to sun bathe and, uh, you know,
it, it's getting so dangerous now, the sun bathe, the sun burns and k-, skin
cancer [noise]  and everything.  So, I load up, [noise]  you know, on the
sunscreens and, so I, because the ocean to me is real soothing and comfor-,
comforting. 

B.122:  Yeah. 

A.123:  And so that's why I like to, to go there.  But, [whistling] and, of course,
I don't like, uh, I like, uh, [whistling] I like to snorkel so I have to go
where there's real clear water to do that.

B.124:  Yeah.  And around here the, uh, the Possum Kingdom is about the, the
closest place.

A.125:  Is it really?

B.126:  Yeah.  They [/whistling], 

A.127:  # Uh.  #

B.128:  # have # real clear [noise]  water and,

A.129:  Oh,

B.130:  ((plants)).

A.131:  I've never been, now where is that near?

B.132:  It's, uh, near, um, well, it's, it's kind of near Abilene but it's, it's,
uh, about halfway in between here and, and Abilene. 

A.133:  Oh, okay. 

B.134:  It's, uh, you, if you know where Albany is and, uh, it's about maybe an
hour west of Weatherford.

A.135:  Oh, okay. 

B.136:  Out there west of Fort Worth. 

A.137:  Uh-huh. 

B.138:  [Noise]  It's a big, it's on the Brazos River.  They dammed up the Brazos
River. 

A.139:  Oh, I see [noise].  I see. 

B.140:  And it's beautiful. 

A.141:  Is it? No, I, I guess I've never been up there amon-, the, uh, when I moved
up here, uh, from Florida I, I misplaced my snorkeling, I think they, what
they did, they didn't unpack it.  It must have been in a box or something they
didn't unpack because I ended up without my snorkeling equipment and, and a
few other things.  And they must have been in a box that I had in my garage
and they just didn't get them to me, so --

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  -- I'm going to have to start from scratch, I guess, and buy all new
snorkeling equipment.  But, I had some really good snorkeling equi-, I really
hate to start over again.  But, there's no other ch-, choice. 

B.144:  Yeah. 

@@A.145:  Anyway, have we talked our five minutes?

B.146:  Yeah.  I think so. 

A.147:  Okay [noise].  Well, it's been nice talking to you. 

B.148:  Yeah.  Nice talking to,

A.149:  # All right.# 

B.150:  # you.  #

A.151:  Bye-bye. 

B.152:  Bye-bye.
