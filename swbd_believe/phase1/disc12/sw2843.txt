A.1:  I guess I'm calling to tell you about my exercise program.  

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  Which is a little bit lacking right now.  I've slacked off in the last six
months, but for several years I have walked three miles a day.

B.4:  Okay.  I'm a walker also.  

A.5:  Are you?  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  Uh, and that, my walking was a fast walk, uh, to get the heart rate up to
an aerobic level.

B.8:  Right. 

A.9:  And, I, in fact, I was enjoying it so much, uh, that I was doing it like
seven days a week, and I,

B.10:  Oh boy.  

A.11:  I pretty much had to cut that back though to five.  

B.12:  How far could you, how far did you walk?  I mean, I know time wise you need
at least twenty minutes.  How many miles a day?

A.13:  Uh, I well it was about three.  

B.14:  About three.  Okay.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  And I walked thirty minutes.  I did the, uh, slow walk kind of a
normal walk for five.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  And the aerobic walk for twenty.  

B.18:  Oh, okay.  

A.19:  And cool down walk for the last five.  

B.20:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  

A.21:  But, and, and it was, I was, it was so much fun to watch the progress
because as I, uh, went along when I started, uh, at first I had to, uh, I
didn't have to use my arms all that much to, uh, you know get the heart rate
up.

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  But, then after about, uh, four weeks then I had to use them all the time
and then I had to, I found that I had to raise them above my head and kind of
down my back to, to get the heart rate up,

B.24:  Oh boy.  

A.25:  it was very progre-, it was progressive.  

B.26:  Yeah, I, s-, (( ))  is very quickly also.  

A.27:  Yeah, I thought, well now, I guess probably six weeks before I had to do my
arms the whole time,

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  the whole twenty minutes.  

B.30:  I see.  Did you find that when you walked like after you, you were getting
this aerobic, uh, benefits di-, not just the heart rate but did you see a
difference in, in your body also?

A.31:  Oh, my gosh, yes.  

B.32:  Oh, is that right?  

A.33:  I have the cutest turned up tail you ever saw [laughter]. 

B.34:  [Laughter].  Yeah.  Okay.  

A.35:  No, no, I did notice, uh, a lot of difference.  

B.36:  Yeah.  The reason I ask is I've always really enjoyed walking and I know,
um, you know, I, I it doesn't bother me to take walks by myself I just, when I
walk I just, I, I think, I enjoy the scenery and I've always found it
relaxing.  It's always something I've enjoyed doing and for me I've found that
as long as I try to take almost everyday at least say a twenty minute walk or
a half an hour walk maybe more if I can that it's really makes a difference in
my weight control.

A.37:  Oh gosh, yes.  

B.38:  Um, in the winter months, well, here, I'm sure down there the winter's a
little better than here, but in the winter months January and February are,
are the hard months and you have some really cold days and I don't walk much
at all in the winter,

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  and I really, you know, I, I gain a little bit of weight but I think, you
know, you really start to feel it as far as your clothes, how you feel, um, and
I, I, I was doing, um, once in awhile, floor aerobics, uh, I bu-, I developed
arthritis and, and I had to give up the, the floor aerobics for a while but
walking is something that I continued to do.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, um, I don't know, I find for me that, um, it's just something that I
never have gotten tired of whereas when I take an aerobics class, by the end
of the twelve weeks, I'm glad to, uh, [laughter] finish it.

A.43:  Well, I think may be you like doing it alone.  You like doing it on your
own time too.

B.44:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's, uh, I th-, you know, I know my neighbor will
go, is very disciplined will get up six o'clock in the morning and, and do
rowing and aerobics tapes and I don't have that type of discipline but, um, I,
you know, I found that it's not necessary really necessary to knock yourself
out to that degree to keep fit and I really think walking is probably one of
the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties
[laughter] you could continue to do.

A.45:  I think so to.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  Well and I, I was very pleased, uh, when, uh, during cold weather and I
haven't lived in Charlotte, North Carolina for a full year yet.

B.48:  I see.  

A.49:  But, uh, when I lived in a colder climate, I had access to one of those
Schwinn bicycles.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.  

A.51:  The ones that you, you know, you have to use your arms also. 

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  And so on those days I did thirty minutes on the bike.

B.54:  Oh, I see.  

A.55:  Now, that was a little boring because I did it alone.  

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  And, uh, wh-, you know you can't read very, very well if you're using your
arms and you can't put a book on that,

B.58:  Right, right.  

A.59:  type of arms.  But that was, I was very lucky there but here I have dogs
that I take, uh, on long walks.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And that makes it a lot better to have their company.  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  But as I said I'm not doing qui-, quite as well now because we're in a
temporary situation and what I had, uh, also found that, I guess it's like
simple addition, uh, once it well, it's easier to quit if you start, uh, uh,
stopping,

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  shall I say, 

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  if you skip some days then, uh, it's awfully hard to get back to a
regular routine ...

B.68:  Yeah, I think that's true, um, you know, I found that, oh, I used to be
just a fanatic walker even when I was pregnant with, with my first child.  I,
I walked two, three times a day for twenty minutes to half an hour.  I must
have walked about five minutes a day,

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  and, uh, and, um, and then, uh, when I, well then I had two kids and you
know that makes it a little harder sometimes,

A.71:  Sure.

B.72:  and then I was working and then when I, I found when, when I got
arthritis one of the bad things about it that comes with it is, is fatigue,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  and, and I found that I was tiring very quickly, 

A.75:  Yes.  

B.76:  and I couldn't walk like a used to but I saw a big difference in my
figure [laughter].  Yeah.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  And, um, I'm just, I'm, I'm doing better because I'm under controlive
medications so I'm getting back into this walking everyday but it's really
true once you haven't done it for a while it's very difficult to start back
again but once you really are into it I was definitely addicted to walking I
had to have my walk everyday.

A.79:  Well, and I w-, I had support from my husband too which wa-, is very nice.
He felt that I needed to put that first and, uh, I don't believe a lot of
woman always have that kind of support.

B.80:  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Yeah, that's true.  I, um, um, fortunate enough that he
doesn't travel that much and that whenever as soon as he gets home from work
or whatever, I'll say after dinner well, you know, I'm talking off for my walk
[laughter], you know.

A.81:  Yes.  Yes.  

B.82:  And, uh, yeah, that's, that's true and, you know, I've, I've had his
support anytime I've taken a class aerobics in the evening or something, you
know, we've always been able to work it out, um,

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  but right now I'm taking water aerobics also and that's a little bit
different.  It's, it's more strenuous then I figured it would be,

A.85:  Yes.  Yes.

B.86:  uh.  

A.87:  I've had those and I think they're excellent.  

B.88:  Yeah.  I think so I've, I've talk, and now, I'm only talking it one day a
week.  Some of the woman there take it two and three days a week and they say
that when you take it two or three days a week you will see a difference.

A.89:  Uh, oh, I'm sure.  

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  Oh, my gosh, yes.  I, I think it's wonderful I've had it and on a regular
basis and, uh, I found it a lot more fatiguing than my, uh, walking program
even.

B.92:  [Laughter].  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree there's something about being in the
water and exercising and you come out and you have a big appetite [laughter].

A.93:  Yes.  Yes.  Well, it's been fun talking to you.  

B.94:  You also.  

A.95:  And I we shall you lots of luck with your endeavors.  

B.96:  Okay.  You, you too, and uh, have a good summer then down there [laughter].

A.97:  #Thank you.  Bye-bye.#  

B.98:  #Uh-huh.  Bye-bye.#
