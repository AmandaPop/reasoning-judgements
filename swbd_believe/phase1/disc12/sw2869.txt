===========================================================================

A.1:  Are you satisfied with the public school system in your area?

B.2:  Uh, well we don't have children but, um, from what our peers tell us, um,
most of them do, are not in favor of the way the Dallas public, well I
shouldn't get specific, the way the public education system is run here.

A.3:  Okay.

B.4:  Um, they just don't feel that, um, the quality of the teachers and the
quality of the, uh, curriculum.  And they actually send them to, uh, the
suburban areas.  I, I guess it's okay if I say the area, Plano.

A.5:  Sure, uh-huh.

B.6:  Um, and I think one thing that the state's doing right now, about the
refunding, I think is completely unfair.  It's not that I,

A.7:  Yeah, I don't agree with that either, the, the Robin Hood approach,

B.8:  Yeah, 

A.9:  where the rich give to the poor.

B.10:  Yeah, i-, is that the basic reason you don't agree with it.

A.11:  No, I don't.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  People move to the suburbs to Richardson and Plano, uh, uh, mostly
because of the school district, because of the level of education that's
offered.

B.14:  Yeah, and they're already paying for it, I mean, I, you know, um, I know we
used to live in Garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to
private school because, um, they just didn't like what was going on.

A.15:  Yeah, well it costs, uh, so much in taxes here, 

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  and, uh, even if they do give money to the poorer school districts, I
don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all.

B.18:  I know it, I mean, I look at high schools like, um, what was the one in
Richardson, J J Pearce High School that just won the national academic, some
kind, of, um, uh, championship or tournament that they had for academics.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  And that, Richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by
taking away from them.

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  That's a good way to say it, the Robin Hood, um, approach.

A.23:  Well that's, that's exactly what, what their doing, um --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- I don't think that's going to improve the talent as far as the school
teaching, uh, goes.

B.26:  You know, I used to work at E D S and Ross Perot, you know, the big joke
sometimes, um, about him, but the one thing he did a few years back in testing
the competency of the, uh, faculty,

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  I still think that's a good idea.

A.29:  Well, I think it is too, uh, ever-,

B.30:  Because, I don't, I don't know whe-, did you go to school in Texas?

A.31:  No, I went to school in Wisconsin.

B.32:  And I went to school in Chicago so I can tell you it's probably the same
type of thing that, um, I had a really good education but it wasn't where I
went to high school, it was an inner city.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  But it, the faculty was very good.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And I don't know what y-, 

A.37:  Well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the
inner city or the suburbs.

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  Uh, the trouble is that, uh, the suburbs are able to pay more.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  That's going to attract, the, the better, uh, teachers.  

B.42:  Which is understandable, I mean, I'd go where I would be compensated the
most.

A.43:  Sure, and, uh, it cost more in tax money too, so [laughter].

B.44:  Yeah, I mean, it's yeah.  In Texas, I don't know, I don't if it's because
of, um, the influx of minority, uh, in terms of that they're trying to please
all people and their not pleasing anybody, you know, I don't know if that's
what it is.

A.45:  Well, it could very well be, uh, #there is a definite racial split here.#

B.46:  #I don't know, I'm not really,# yeah, I mean, I don't know if that's
exactly it or not but it seems to be a little bit more, um, well, I don't
know, schools in Wisconsin, I'm trying to think of some of the things I know
about the schools up north compared to down here.  It just seems like down
here that unless you're in a suburban entity, their S A T scores, their
reading comprehension levels, they're just not as high.

A.47:  Well I was in a rural area in Wisconsin, 

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  and, uh, we had a good public school system, but I don't think it was
great.  I think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to
college.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  But, uh, the, the racial mix of, um, students in my area was entirely
white.  We had, uh, no minorities at all.

B.52:  [Laughter] And mine was, uh, mine was, completely, um, Hispanic in terms of
Puerto Rican, uh, Caucasian, and eastern European.

A.53:  Okay, #well that's interesting.#

B.54:  #Um [laughter],#

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  It was very eclectic, um, but the teachers were what did curriculum.  I
mean they had things like philosophy and journalism I mean, but there wasn't
a, uh, real, for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school
and knew they wanted to, um, go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program.
It wasn't what I would call a, uh, a career, a, academic pa-, preparatory
path, for college prep,

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  um, as opposed to suburban schools like Evanston, Illinois which has one
of the largest, [clanking] you know, uh, student bodies in the country.

A.59:  Sure.

B.60:  And the, and the money base to go with it.  Um, I don't know, I just look
at high schools like Plano East and West, and, the ones in Richardson and I
think, well, you know, I would send a child there.

A.61:  Well the good school districts here do have honors programs.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  Uh, they do encourage that among the students who are, uh, prepared to go
to college.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  But, uh, that brings up a whole, uh, bunch of other problems, um.

B.66:  Yeah, I mean, my high school did have honors programs and I was in it but
it really, you know, in terms of I'm wondering how much different it was
compared to, in terms of city.  Now there is a high school, um, is it W T, T
White, or is it Jefferson, I don't know that much about the Dallas high school
system, um, but I have heard that the, of one or two that are very good.  But,
out of how many, you know, fifty to sixty high schools,

A.67:  Sure.

B.68:  it's just, um, and then I read the other day that Plano was going to be
the site for a possibly new, um, parochial or Catholic high school.

A.69:  All right, I haven't heard that yet.

B.70:  Something like to be one of the largest ones in the Southwest or something.

A.71:  That's interesting.  

B.72:  Yeah, h-, 

A.73:  I know some people at work who, uh, have children in high school,

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  and they're not satisfied with the school district at all and they do
send their kids to the priv-, s-, private schools.

B.76:  Do they?  See, and are they in Plano or are they in d-, Dallas?

A.77:  Um, they send them to Saint Marks, I think where ever that's located.

B.78:  Okay, yeah, yeah, that's one of the more, um, yeah, I have some friends
that, uh, have younger children and they send them to the Montessori system.

A.79:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.80:  Um, and when you hear what they're paying you just [laughter], 

A.81:  Well h-, he said about six hundred a month,

B.82:  Oh my goodness.

A.83:  and that doesn't include their personal expense, so you're, you're
talking about, uh, college, uh, level fees here.

B.84:  Yeah, twelve years and you add more than one child to that and you say oh
my goodness.

A.85:  Sure.  

B.86:  Yeah, I,

A.87:  But I think, I think the honors programs are good in the high schools,
but, uh, some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs
get harassed by their peers,

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  for doing too well.

B.90:  This is true, yes, I can personally relate to that, yes.

A.91:  And that discourages them from doing well [laughter] so, uh.

B.92:  Uh-huh, I don't know, I think one thing the United States does, um, my
stepfather's from England and one thing they do their, at least in, in the
section of London where he was from, that they, um, they actually, they call
them externships, but they actually, the child's, um, a-, they go by forms,
they don't go by grades, and I guess, I guess, what would be the equivalent of
our early high school, nine, tenth grade.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  They call it the tenth of eleventh form, um, they actually are forced to
take time off and pick an area of study.  It's proctored, it's, you know,
regulated and all that sort of thing.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  Um. but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own
thing on a particular subject and it doesn't matter what it is, it has to be
academic, but they, it's free, of their choosing.

A.97:  Well their allowed to progress at their own pace, then?

B.98:  Right in that one, just for that one particular semester, quarter, or what
ever, you know,

A.99:  All right,

B.100:  that one quarter, uh, a study unit would be.  And I don't know, I don't
think we do enough of that here,

A.101:  No.

B.102:  in terms of getting children to think independently.

A.103:  I can relate to part of that, uh, in, in my high school, uh, 

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  say just, for, for example in my math courses, uh, I, I was, not to brag
about this at all, I was so far ahead of everybody else that I didn't have to
go to class.

B.106:  Oh my.

A.107:  And I got to sit by myself in an empty room,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  while everybody else was in class taking algebra, an work at my own pace.

B.110:  See, yeah, that's kind of what I'm talking about, I mean, um, uh, I mean we
can only speak from personal experience and I'm not bragging either, but it's
the same thing.  I mean I took A P or advanced placement classes,

A.111:  Sure.

B.112:  and, i-, there were things that I probably knew about in other segments
but they just didn't offer them.  I mean they offered them in things like
english and chemistry.

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  Two things that were obscure to what I was interested in in terms of, um, a
career.  Um, I think part of the thing about schools today is too, is the way
the families have gone down the tubes, the structure.

A.115:  Yeah. #I'm sure that has a definite effect.#

B.116:  #That now teachers play police officers, you know.#  

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  Their parenting, their disciplinarians, you know, and I'm doing thi-, all
this second hand.  We don't have any kids in school or anything, so I can't,

A.119:  Well, I, I know people, uh, I don't have any kids either, but, uh, fr-, I
know people who had been neighbors once upon a time,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  who had kids and whenever the father was traveling away on business or
they, they had financial problems, their kids, uh, their, it was definitely
noticed, at their performance in school.

B.122:  Isn't that something, I mean are parents, (( )), I mean my folks were
divorced, too, but I can't remember ever, I mean it was sort of just like, uh,
you knew you had to study, or you just didn't fl-, [laughter].

A.123:  Yeah, it got so bad with, with this one kid that, uh, the, the school, uh,
called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on.

B.124:  Oh goodness.

A.125:  Because his performance at school had degraded so much.

B.126:  I mean I wouldn't want to be growing up now a days, that's one thing, um,
but I don't know how you solve that, you know, those are social problems.  The
academic problem, I don't know, I think, of two or three things in my mind.  I
think teachers should be tested --

A.127:  I, I believe in that.

B.128:  -- and they probably would shoot me if they heard that, and I know a lot of
teachers.  Um, two, I think that they should leave the funding, or the money
where the proven programs are.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  And three I do think that parents need to be more involved.  I don't know,
I just it's probably easy to say because none of us have children,

A.131:  Right,

B.132:  but, um, I just,

A.133:  Well I remember as a kid, uh, they had P T A,

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  Parent Teacher Association meetings all the time,

B.136:  Association, yeah.

A.137:  and, uh, my parents always went to those, uh, [laughter].

B.138:  Yeah, mine too, I mean, and do they have those anymore, I mean, I don't
even,

A.139:  I, I don't know.

B.140:  I don't have any, uh, but you know just the other day we were somewhere,
actually on Saturday, we were in the Park Cities ordering, in a, we were in a
specialty, uh, food shop ordering something to send out of state and the man,
we were all upon the topic of adoption, which may be in our future, um, if
we're real lucky.  At any rate, he was saying how he was glad that his two
children, one biological, one natural, um, this had to do with the deo-, the
adopted one, which, biological, I mean, one adopted, one natural, um, that's
irrelevant, but he was saying that, uh, my husband said and what does, your
son is very good looking, what is he, well, he's nineteen, he graduated last
year, um, but he's interested in theater, and he's just going to Richland, and
he said, you know, he said I'm not calling him stupid or slow, he just, he
said he did, really didn't want to study, and he goes, and you know he leaned
over to my husband and he said, well, you know, so and so, he said, when you
have them, if you get one, what you'll understand is, you'll just be glad if
they don't, you don't get a call from the police.

A.141:  Sure.

B.142:  And he said our son Mark, you know, blah, blah, blah, um, he may be, have
only been a C student but we've never had trouble with him.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  He said and when you raise a child in today's society, he, you're just
glad they make it through school.

A.145:  Yeah, well the, the dropout rate is so high in Dallas and Fort Worth, uh,

B.146:  Is it?

A.147:  Yes it is,

B.148:  See, I don't even know that.

A.149:  I, I think it's thirty-eight per-, ...
