==========================================================================

A.1:  Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going
on legislation wise.

B.2:  Yes [laughter].  

A.3:  And, uh, the, the interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one
being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free [breathing].  I'd
have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.  I, I don't mind
regulating all of the, the guns and I would certainly call for a ban on
certain types.  Now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a
debate forever, I would assume.  Uh, the method of, of controlling it, well
that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls.  Uh,
one point that was made in the [breathing] House hearings or the
representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card
instantly, but, uh, we don't want to check his background, and of course those
are two different issues as far as privacy goes --

B.4:  Right.  

A.5:  -- uh, but there still, the, the technology exists to, to check it if they
want.  So, it's, it's kind of a, [breathing] I guess you could put a dollar
figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it
like that.  And then you've got the group of people that decide that there's,
there's no particular reason to have them at all and you got to balance those
against the ones that say there is some sport to it and I guess I would fall
more in the, the realm that I like the sport issue of it, but I, I could give
it up without too much trouble, not the world's most pleasurable thing and it
costs a bit to do it,

B.6:  Yes [laughter].  

A.7:  uh, finding ranges and things like that.  

B.8:  Right.  

A.9:  Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years, but it's just not
like golf or whatever.  I mean there are other things that you could go do.
So, uh, I, I don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving
factor.  I think that society could easily swing the scales the other
direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get
hurt,

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  I don't even keep the gun in our house, 

B.12:  Right.  

A.13:  so I don't have that problem, but, uh, [breathing] it's a hard, hard
topic, I guess.  A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings
about it.

B.14:  They do, and you, boy you can get them on either side and just like you
say, uh, well I think I, I guess I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven
or eight [laughter], because, or not, w-, w-, onto no control, I'm sorry,
excuse me, that, uh, two or three.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  I was going the wrong direction.  Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child
that was killed by another child --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- because they had a gun in the house and the father kept the bullets in a
separate place, but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent
enough to, uh, he knew where booth, both places were, loaded the gun and they
were playing cowboys and Indians and he shot the other little boy right
between the eyes.

A.19:  Boy.  

B.20:  So, uh, I mean it, it destroyed two families -- 

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- uh, in just that instant and, and I, a lot of people say that they need
it for protection, uh, having worked at one time in Baltimore, or, I don't
know if you're in the big city,

A.23:  Dallas.  

B.24:  are you, Dallas?  

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  That's a big city [laughter].  

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Uh, then you know that, uh, uh, if you live anywhere real close that, uh,
the safety is, uh, some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that
they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you
know.  But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children
growing up.  Uh, I, uh, once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a
policeman and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume
that you know how to use it well, and he's going to, you know, try to shoot
first.

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  Uh, [laughter] so, you know, if he's got one.  Uh, and if not, uh, then
usually they, uh, if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you, I
mean, you know --

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  -- they, they, he said that it, it was better not to have, especially
myself, now I'm a widow, and, uh, I, so I'm, when my handicapped son is, is
not at home, I'm by myself, but, uh, there's, I still won't have a gun in the
house because he said it's really [breathing], uh, playing Russian Roulette if
you do [laughter].  Uh,

A.33:  Yeah.  About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you
happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way.  Once you're
surprised, it's too late.

B.34:  That's right.  

A.35:  And, and the rare, 

B.36:  That's right.  

A.37:  circum-, you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in
such a way that you knew the guy was coming,

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  and had time to do anything about it.  

B.40:  That's right.

A.41:  And, I don't have that problem, as I don't use that argument as saying it's
worth keeping one.  In the, uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the
constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh, it's hard
to know the original intent, but I, I don't see it as that, that difficult of
a [breathing] story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's
the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public.

B.42:  Right.  

A.43:  And you have a, you have a earn a right, not just a privilege as it were if
you're going to serve in the militia, then you have a right to have that arm,
but, uh,

B.44:  That's right.  

A.45:  you know, there's all sorts of arguments there -- 

B.46:  I know [laughter].  

A.47:  -- but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,

B.48:  No.  

A.49:  they didn't have this problem back then [laughter]. 

B.50:  No, that's true.  That,  

A.51:  So, we change our rights with our social status.  

B.52:  That's, that's right, that's right.  

A.53:  They're man given rights and they can be taken away by a man, so,

B.54:  Right.  

A.55:  [Breathing] uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.
They can go live in another country if they want.

B.56:  Well, yeah, that's how I feel, too.  I know, well, e-, even here where I
work, uh, we have a, a gun club.  And, of course, those people are very avid.
They, you know,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  they say there should be no ban, that it's not, but I can't see why any,
uh, o-, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine
gun.

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that
would be hard to decide, but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh,
sport, or, I mean, I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go
sport hunting either [laughter].

A.61:  Right.  

B.62:  So, uh, I, I think they should have at least some control over, over those
things.  Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know,
on credit cards, well, I, I understand about the privacy act and everything,
but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has
had a record or not.  That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  And if they do, course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is
that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are
going to steal them anyway.

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them.  Course, some of
them do.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  So it, it is a hard question [laughter].  

A.69:  Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.  Most regulation does
[laughter],

B.70:  Right, oh, yeah.  

A.71:  and, most, it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever
you want, however you want to word it --

B.72:  That's right.

A.73:  -- so it's, well, this may be a never ending topic.  I got a couple of
calls waiting on me, so I'd better let you go.

B.74:  Okay, well thanks for talking.

A.75:  Okay, bye.  

B.76:  [Laughter] Bye-bye now.
