=========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any pets now?

B.2:  Oh, I sure do, I have a cat and a dog named Joey.

A.3:  Joey, th-, the dog is Joey?  

B.4:  Uh-huh, 

A.5:  The cat is, 

B.6:  he's the little boy Pomeranian.

A.7:  Oh, my goodness.

B.8:  And we just got a new addition to the family, so to speak, we also have a
fish.

A.9:  Oh, my [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter]  It's a mud dog.

A.11:  I beg your pardon.

B.12:  It's a mud dog.  It's, uh,

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  a cross between a catfish and, uh, I don't know what, a salamander.

A.15:  Well did you all catch it, or, uh,

B.16:  Uh-huh, we have a cat, Stripper.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Oh, the mud dog.

A.19:  No, did, no did you catch the fish?

B.20:  Uh, we had a friend give it to us.

A.21:  Uh-huh, and it's all alone in that aquarium.

B.22:  [Laughter] Yeah, we'd like to get him a friend but um, uh, we haven't
found one yet.  So how about you, do you have any pets?

A.23:  Well at the present time I have two dogs.

B.24:  Oh really, what kind?

A.25:  An English setter, you know, that's the white dog with the feathers and it
has, 

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  uh, yellow spots on it which they call, I think, uh, liver spots.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And that's a male.  And I have a wonderful female lab, black lab.

B.30:  Uh-huh, how long have you had them.

A.31:  Quite a long time, uh, probably five or six years and unfortunately the
black lab that's a female, it, tha-, it's, it's the most wonderful animal
we've ever had, an, i-, when she was about three years old we noticed that she
was having pro-, uh, problems limping and so forth and,

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  she has hip dysplasia.

B.34:  Oh no.

A.35:  And it's in that breed.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  But now I think there are tests that can be conducted, uh, to tell whether
or not the puppies have the, have it.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  But I think, I don't know, apparently they've been so in, well I don't
know inbred, or what, but,  

B.40:  Oh, is that right? 

A.41:  Well n-, I'm not sure that's the situation, but, it, um, for those dogs
that are registered and if, if you should have one, uh, that also has hip
dysplasia you cannot breed it, uh.

B.42:  Huh, I had no idea, I hadn't, didn't even know that.

A.43:  Uh-huh, but she's wonderful.

B.44:  Um, our dog, Joey, has, uh, a back problem.

A.45:  Um, like ha-, what are the --

B.46:  Uh, he, he's got a bad back but he's seven, uh, I guess he's abo-, almost
eight years old.

A.47:  -- what are the symptoms?

B.48:  Um, he just, uh, he doesn't, he, uh, yo-, he rolls o-, he doesn't like to
roll over.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Um, e-, you just, when you touch him a certain way on the back,

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  but otherwise, he can jump, uh, you know, just as long as he doesn't
bend a certain way.

A.53:  Um.  Well, uh, I have had just wonderful luck with this lab, uh, when i-,
uh, let's see, winter before last we would bring her in, and, uh, when it was
cold.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And she wouldn't, I, you know, the next morning you want to take them out,
and she wouldn't, I couldn't get her up without p-, picking her up and which
it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds.

B.56:  [Laughter] I bet.

A.57:  Um, until, if I allowed her to not get up on her own, it'd be two o'clock
in the afternoon.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Anyway, I, uh, met my son's, uh, college roommate, is a vet and he said,
um, let's give her some race horse shots.  And you know in, I'm, I'm kind of
glad to be able to tell people about this, but you, because you all the time,
you know, run into people with problems.

B.60:  Oh, yeah.

A.61:  Anyway, that's when we lived in Oklahoma, and, uh, so he gave this dog a
series of (( )), it's, they give it to race horses, uh, to get rid of, uh
cartilage,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  and it's called (( )).  Anyway, it's a series of six shots, once a week,
and then I noticed after two shots she was,

B.64:  Do you have to give those?

A.65:  Well I could have, but I can't give a shot.

B.66:  Oh, I believe me, I understand.

A.67:  I took her from Enid, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six
weeks.  

B.68:  Uh.

A.69:  And, uh, after the, the second shot she was significantly better.  Then I
didn't notice any improvement till the, after the sixth one.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And ever since, and he said, uh, a booster, uh, every year or two, 

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  I mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that and when I
notice in the winter, when it's worse, you know, it's cold weather and so
forth then I have, uh, gotten a booster for her.  But not many people in this
part of the country know anything about (( )).

B.74:  Um.

A.75:  I've had to get it from Oklahoma.  They've heard about it but they've
really never used it.

B.76:  Uh-huh, yeah, I've never heard anything about it either.

A.77:  So dogs that get down in the hips, like I think German Shepherds do it,
and probably large dogs.  

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And, uh, it's just wonderful.

B.80:  Does he get, is he an inside dog also, 

A.81:  Uh.

B.82:  or does he just run out in the backyard?  Is he fenced in?

A.83:  Um, um, well we're living now in an area where we, we, we're in the woods
and we take walks.  I just don't let them,

B.84:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

A.85:  uh, uh, go away from me, but we take walks through the woods twice a
day.

B.86:  Oh, that's nice.

A.87:  And, uh, I can over do it on her.

B.88:  Oh, yeah.

A.89:  But anyway, at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  Tell me about your cat.

B.92:  Oh, Stripper, well he started out being a little orphan, and we, we took
him in and, uh, he's about two years old now and he loves his treats, uh,
both, uh, Joey and, uh, Stripper get treats [laughter].  And, uh, let's see, 

A.93:  And is, um, Stripper an inside cat, or outside?

B.94:  Oh, well he's outside and, uh, 

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  he's got a way to get in, he's got free access of a window we like to
keep open.

A.97:  Yes.

B.98:  So, he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to.

A.99:  Well of course.

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter] That's nice, they, they, 

B.102:  Joey, on the other hand is a little different.  He has to go out whenever,
uh, we ask him and when he, when we ask him, he, uh, he barks.  He'll either
bark for food, or he'll bark to go out and he'll tell you which one he wants.
#He's been through obedience school.#

A.103:  #Well he just can,# well he has been trained and you've ke-, you've kept
u-, it up, haven't you.

B.104:  Oh, definitely.

A.105:  Yeah, it is wonderful, I, I have some neighbors across the field, and, um,
they when we first moved here, uh, when the dogs and I didn't fe-, we have a
very nice kennel and everything but, but since I, I didn't want to, I, wa-, I
just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while.

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  So I kept watch and never let them get away, but now every couple weeks,
they wou-, one would slip away and my neighbor said to me, oh, I noticed those
dogs, dogs are so well trained, anytime they hear your voice, they come.  So
that made me very proud [laughter].

B.108:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

A.109:  Well, have we been talking five minutes?

B.110:  I'm not for sure.

A.111:  I'm not either, but, 

B.112:  I think maybe we have, but, 

A.113:  Yeah.  Well, um, so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure.

@@B.114:  Oh, definitely.  Have you ever done this before?

A.115:  Yes.

B.116:  Oh, okay, um, I haven't ever called.  I've put in the paper work, I just
never made the call.

A.117:  Oh really, uh-huh.

B.118:  Yeah, so I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up or,

A.119:  No, they don't, no.  I, I glanced at the clock when, um, we started and I
think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something.  But one
day I was talking to a lady about gardening and I'm, I love gardening and she
did too, an, and,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  after, after about twelve minutes or something, 

B.122:  [Laughter].

A.123:  the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape [laughter].

B.124:  Oh, [laughter] well, at least you know you did your part.

A.125:  Uh-huh, but it's been so much fun too, uh, talk.

B.126:  How did you get into this.

A.127:  Well, my best friend in Virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in
Texas. 

B.128:  Oh, I see.

A.129:  And so she knew that I had the time and would be, would enjoy it.

B.130:  Uh-huh, that's true.

A.131:  Um, so.

B.132:  I mean, I, 

A.133:  But I have a hard time getting anybody, because I guess, do you work.

B.134:  Um, yes I do. 

A.135:  Yeah, and probably just got home.

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  So, um, during the day, I me-, I thi-, and I understand also they want
men.

B.138:  Right, I was going to tell you the same thing.  They're really looking for
a lot more men to participate.

A.139:  Yeah, my husband does.

B.140:  Does he.  Yeah, I need to,

A.141:  Yes.

B.142:  I've got some applications, I need to hand them out.  But, uh, this is a
great project, that they're working on and it's really going to lead the way,
uh, for a lot of econ-, um, applications and, and development in the voice
area.

A.143:  Yes, wh-, I think so too, and I haven't helped them out on the me-, on men
particularly, but my husband had been ma-, in fact, he's been, probably has
made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around
dinner time, 

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  I try to, you know, make them do, during the day, but nobody's home.

B.146:  Well this is the perfect time for me. 

A.147:  #Well good.#

B.148:  #Well maybe I'll get you next time.#

A.149:  Yeah it so fo-, much fun to talk to you.

B.150:  [Laughter] All right, have a good one.

A.151:  You too, #bye.#

B.152:  #Bye.#
