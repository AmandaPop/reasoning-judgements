============================================================================

@A.1:  Do you believe in, uh, capital punishment?

B.2:  [Breathing] You know, you're talking to probably one of the si-, late
sixties and early seventies original hippies --

A.3:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.4:  -- [Laughter] now living in suburbia, raising kids.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Um, [breathing] I don't know, I have a, I have a real gut response that
says nobody's got a, you know, a right to take anybody else's life.  On the
other hand I have seen an awful lot of, I have lived in major cities, and I
have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should
just be shot.

A.7:  Yeah, well, I think, that based on, um, certain crimes, it, uh, is merited.
Uh, there was a case just recently.  I don't know if you, uh, if you heard
about this in, uh, New Hampshire, I believe, about the teacher, school teacher
who hired her, uh, one of her high school students to kill her husband.

B.8:  Yes.

A.9:  And they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole.  And, in a case
like that, uh, where, well, you've got, [laughter] a moral problem and an
economic one.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Uh, when, when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life, no
chance of parole, what good does it do anybody, and the taxpayers are going to
be footing the bill for the rest of her life.  She's a young, young woman, uh,
in her late twenties, I guess.  So I just,

B.12:  Something like twenty-two or twenty-three, I remember reading that and
being horrified.

A.13:  Early twenty, well that could be.  Yeah.

B.14:  Well, had she had any previous criminal history?  Now that's the of thing
I'd have to kind of look at.

A.15:  Uh, I don't know.  I didn't hear that much about it, uh, just the, uh, the
verdict that they had.

B.16:  In Texas, if you're going to sentence somebody to, uh, to death, what, is,
is there a specific criteria that they have to meet?

A.17:  Um, I don't, I don't really know about that.  Uh, uh, if well, uh, I thi-,
I think it's, it's only, it only applies to a very few types of crimes.
Murder, and I think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well.  I'm not
sure what, ho-, what the range is for the crimes that, uh, would merit a death
penalty.

B.18:  Um.  [breathing] If you were on a jury would you be able to, to give
somebody a death sentence?

A.19:  I think it depends on what, what it was they did, and if the evidence was,
uh, uh, if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that
crime --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and if they were, uh, if, if I [laughter] had no doubt that, uh, they
would be a hazard to, to the rest of, uh, the population as long as they were
alive, uh, yeah, I could probably go along with that.

B.22:  How about if it was a, a seventeen and a half year old with a, a list and
all of ar-, what do they call it, uh, criminal sha-, as long as your arm, over
the history of violent crime?

A.23:  Well, [laughter] I guess you've got a choice.  Either you do life in
prison, or you can institutionalize somebody forever where they're not a
threat to, to the rest of, uh, the population, or you can put them out of
everybody's misery.  Uh, I don't know.  It's, it's a real moral dilemma.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  I mean, I come from the Catholic church, and [laughter] they, they, uh, are
definitely opposed to that type of,

B.26:  Yeah, I come from a Catholic church background, too --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and always thought, you know, that being raised in the Midwest, you
really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than, uh, shoplifting --

A.29:  Right, yeah.

B.30:  -- and it was very easy to maintain this stand that, you know, that, that
life is something that you have no right to take.

A.31:  When you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes, and they get
out of prison after a few years, all of sudden here they're, they're, uh,
committing the same type of crimes all over again.  Other people are
victimized, what do you do about it?

B.32:  I don't know.  There was a, oh what was his, Gary Gilmore.  Did you ever
read the book that Norman Mailer wrote, THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG?

A.33:  No, I never did.

B.34:  Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and, uh, found guilty of, I
think, two or three murders in Utah --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- outside of Provo.  And he was the one that was petitioning to have,
have, you know, himself executed.

A.37:  Okay.

B.38:  When you read his book, with all the interviews this guy did with Gary
Gilmore, you know, it sounds like the guy had about every turn given to him,
every rehab opportunity given to him, and even interviews with his mother, she
said that, you know, as a small child, he basically was amoral.

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  And when I finished that book, I kind of thought, you know, what do you do
with a person like this.

A.41:  Well, some people just are incorrigible, and there's no way that they can
ever deal with society and abide by rules.  So, in, in a case like that, uh,
given what crime they're guilty of, uh, yeah, I could, I could justify a death
penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to
grips with, uh, living in normal society.

B.42:  See, I would, I always come look at it, do they have, could they be put,
even in life imprisonment, could they be put to useful labor,

A.43:  Um, yeah, I believe so.

B.44:  Could they do road work and those kind of things.  (( )) And then you get
somebody like Charles Manson, who just (( )) the guy allowed.

A.45:  Well, people who tend to be, say, on death row, I think they're kept in
isolation all the time.  I don't believe that they're given a chance to, uh,
do anything productive or even mix with the rest of the prison community.

B.46:  And then what do you do about the, the thing that, you know, the, the, was
it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted
erroneously.

A.47:  Right, well [laughter] it's, it's, it's real small, but, uh, like I said, I
mean, the death penalty could probably be justified if the evidence, if
there's no doubt.

B.48:  Have you ever sat on a jury?

A.49:  No, I never have.

B.50:  Neither have I, and I'm one of these people who votes regularly, and I'm
always registered wherever I've lived, and I have never been called.

A.51:  I know several people at work who've been called on juries and they
absolutely hate it.

B.52:  [Breathing] Part of me says that I'd kind of like to do it, just to see
what it's like to be in that position where you are playing, you know, life
and death with somebody else.  Could I bring myself to do it?

A.53:  Well, so much of it is game playing with the lawyers.  They're doing their
plea bargaining, and, and, uh, give and take type situation, that, uh, they're
playing with people's lives in effect, uh, by offering, uh, to, uh, uh,
offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to
get a lighter, uh, sen-, sentence.

B.54:  Yeah, have you ever lived in a, in a, well but Dallas is, are you calling
from Dallas?

A.55:  Uh, yeah, I'm in that area, uh-huh.

B.56:  Okay, have you ever been a victim of a crime?

A.57:  Uh, yes I have, uh, automobile, uh, vandalism.

B.58:  When we lived in Boston, I had eleven cars stolen.

A.59:  My gosh.

B.60:  Yeah, some of them I had for two days.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  And you'd go to court and you'd see these kids, and then, and what they
did, they usually hired kids to do this because you would get a, you know, a
lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or, you know, something trivial.

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  And it'd be the same damn kids --

A.65:  Sure.

B.66:  -- over and over and over again.  And the first couple of times, you know,
I felt really sorry for them, but after a while it was like, you know, shoot
the little shits right then and there.

A.67:  Yeah, yeah.

B.68:  Then I felt really, you know, guilty about feeling that way.

A.69:  I don't have much sympathy for people that are, uh, uh, victimizing others
on a regular basis, you know, if it's a one time offense, and, and the kid
learns his lesson and, uh, shows remorse and promises never to do something
again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter, uh, it's, it's
one thing.  But when they're there over and over again and, uh, guilty of the
same crimes, uh, nothing seems to help.

B.70:  Yeah, yeah, I, you know, I really don't know what I would do in that
situation, if I had to make that judgment.  I think I would, I think I'd be
very easily swayed by fellow jurors.

A.71:  Uh, yeah, well, I think it depends on what the crime is.  Uh, you're not
going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car.  Uh, if it's first
degree murder or, uh,

B.72:  But if they ever catch this guy in, in Richardson and Coppell who's been,
uh, you know, abducting the, the young girls --

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  -- I don't think I'd even hesitate.

A.75:  No, something like that is just, uh, unforgivable.

B.76:  And then you get, what do you do with, you know, people that are, you know,
chronic child molesters.

A.77:  Yeah, well [laughter], I don't know.

B.78:  Where even a psychiatrist says, You're probably not going to change them,
they're always going to be --

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  -- you know, at risk in society, and, and I think, you know, having kids
has probably really changed, you know, my thinking on this.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  I don't know.  I really don't know.

A.83:  I think people like that, when they do get put in prison with the other
hard core prisoners, uh, the child molesters, in particular, are not looked on
kindly by the other prisoners.  They don't get a lot of respect, and they,
they probably tend not to even survive in that, uh, type of environment.
Because even in prison they have their code of ethics, I guess, if you can
call it that.

B.84:  Yeah, but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is so bent and
twisted that you wonder when they get out of there --

A.85:  Sure.

B.86:  -- even if they, you know --

A.87:  Uh,

B.88:  -- claim that they're rehabbed.

A.89:  Yeah, they don't have any really useful job skills, uh, lots of places,

B.90:  They don't even have social skills.

A.91:  No.

B.92:  [Breathing] Oh.  I don't know, I really don't know.  I, I think that if
somebody asked me I would hesitantly say yes, that I could hand down a death
sentence.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  Uh, then a big, you know, my big problem would be, what if you were in a,
in a state that absolutely did not allow it --

A.95:  Well [laughter].

B.96:  -- and you were on a jury with some heinous, you know, criminal, who had,
you know, just wiped out an entire family.

A.97:  Right.  You've got life without parole, something like that.

B.98:  Or parole in, in, uh, fifteen, twenty years.

A.99:  Sure.  Well, case like Charles Manson.  He's, uh, he's been eligible for
parole a couple of times already.  His case comes up every few years now, I
guess, and, uh, people have to, uh, stand up and, uh, denounce him again and
claim that he's not fit for society.  But we're that close to letting people
like that out of prison ...
