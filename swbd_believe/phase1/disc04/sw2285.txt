=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well like I was saying, Burlington's crime, it doesn't involve
children and, what you see on the T V -s from, you know, in Washington and New
York.  So what I believe the people want, the subject is, is big city crime,
which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about, but I
have, you know, concerns, and --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- I have a few ideas of, um, how to combat it.  I mean, I don't, I don't
think, ideally, you know, you need money to do everything so --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- That's one thing that, that's, that's crime that you can't fight it if
you need that money. # So.#

B.6: # Right,# yeah, well, when, uh, we lived in San Antonio, I grew up around San
Antonio, and it's always been a very large, uh, city, and increasingly
growing.  It's has kind of the split population.  Um, there's a lot of retired
military, uh, individuals that live there, and then there's a very large
Hispanic population there.  And the one thing that we noticed that over the
years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic, uh, gang crime in the city --

A.7: # Oh,#

B.8:  --# and# that has, uh, been the worse thing that we've seen happening.

A.9:  Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the, uh, retired
people's community, or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods?

B.10:  Um, the majority of the actual gang crimes, like the pat-, the drive by
shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods, but the crime spreads out into
the more affluent divisions through robberies, rape and, uh, car crime.
There's a very large, uh, or very high percentage of car theft.  And San An-,
San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico, so a lot of the, uh, cars go
to, uh, you know, (( )) shops, and they take them apart, and a lot of them go
over the border, especially like Mercedes.  A lot of those, those in the, the
Z, uh, the Z cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border, and uh --

A.11:  So that's a big concern if you live there,

B.12:  -- #very much so,# 

A.13: # is to really lock your car up#.

B.14:  very much so, in fact, for a while there they had downtown if you were to
come to a stop light, they had a rash of where people were, when people were
stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and
hold them up.  So now, ever since then, when you drive into the city, most
people keep their doors locked while they're in the car, until they get down
there, and once you've reached the, the river walk area, which is the tourist
area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious
and don't go down the back streets or alleys, and, um, you know, or alone.  If
you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol
cops, it's very nice.  But at, at evening, um, again, you, they have the high
tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice, but you don't want to get
off the beaten track.  Um, there's a lot of parking garages there because
parking is very tight.  And so you don't want to get caught in the parking
garage, uh, alone.

A.15:  Oh, my, it sounds like, um, San Juan, Puerto Rico, we were there just, well
for a lay over --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and, um, well, it wasn't a lay over, we were, we had, we were staying at
the other end of the island, and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  It was at night, and this boy really wanted to go on the beach, and they
look at you crazy --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- you don't go on the beach.  

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- Well, it's a big tourist town, you know, don't they, don't people go for
a walk on the beach at night?  And they said, no, it's very safe in the
daytime --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- but at night, they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound
their sirens, pretty much telling people, be wary, you know, and get off the
beach.

B.26:  It's just so sad, you know, it is just really so sad, you know, it is just
really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.  Um, in San Antonio I
don't know what the answer is.  Education, I think, is a lot of it.  Um, so
many of the kids are drop outs.  Um, uh, there's a lot of drugs that go on,
and that they just have hopeless lives.  They, they lead themselves down
hopeless tunnels.  I think education helps a little bit there.  Um, then
again, I don't know really what steps there are that they,

A.27:  Well, what they, what they say they try to do is to get the kids, um, early
and young.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And what we have here in Burlington, which it doesn't cost a lot of money,
but they have a kids council --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- that they have all these after school activities for kids. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  They set up kids with elderly people, in the winter time they shovel their
snow.  They have a big brother, big sister program.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  They have bottle drives, they have cleanup outings.  And they have also
organized fun activities like gyms, going to the beach, and playing volleyball
at the beach in the summer, and they have gyms open.  And it seems that the
younger you can get them and get them involved with programs --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- after school, you might keep them --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- but you, again, you need that one on one like a big brother, trying to
keep the younger kid, you know, tell him, hey stay in school, it'll get
better, you know, so that your mom doesn't have a job --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and she doesn't work, you don't know, you can be better than that.  You
don't have to live on the, you know, for a street life.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  But.

B.44:  Uh-huh, that's good, that sounds like they've got a lot going on there.

A.45:  Yeah, but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here.  I mean, um, they
can deal with that --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- scale.  They might have five hundred troubled youths. 

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  When you have five thousand troubled youths, plus when you're getting into
th-, well, the kids now, it's twelve years old and they're selling drugs --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- that is carrying a gun.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  It's just, it's the morals of the people which, I mean, I guess we,
everybody's responsible for the society, but, if I had a child that, that did
things so bad, it's not, they don't care about anybody --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- these people they're stealing from, they're just the big bad rich guy --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and we don't have it, so we deserve it, and we should take it.

B.60:  Uh-huh, yeah. I don't know how you combat that.  I, I don't know where you
start or, with a lot of these kids, um, so many of them, all they see is just
the gangs --

A.61:  Yes.

B.62:  -- and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they
don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from
school.

A.63:  Well, I think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible, too.
We're talking --

B.64:  Oh yeah.

A.65:  -- these kids are fourteen years old.  The parents might be thirty years
old --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and I'm thirty years old, and I'm kind of irresponsible, but I have the
morals that keep me from, you know, if I was going to go out and drink or do
something, I wouldn't do it in front of my child.  These people, you know,
they bring their, their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the
kids are just sitting there in the same room.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  It's just that they have absolutely no, no morals --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and it's really sad.

B.72:  And I don't know how you combat that.  I rea-, I don't know what the answer
is to that problem, you know.

A.73:  But I like your idea of education [laughter] --

B.74:  Uh-huh [laughter],

A.75:  -- I mean if the parents aren't supplying it, they've got to get it --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- from someone else --

B.78:  Yeah,

A.79:  -- from the schools,

B.80:  And what do those kids do, they get it at school and come home, what do
they do then.  I, I feel, I feel for them, I don't know how to make it better
for them or, you know, because it, they can't remove themselves, they can't
just leave and say okay, well, it's not acceptable, I'm leaving the big city,
Mom, and I'm, I'm going off, you know, when they're ten, they have to live in
it, and,

A.81:  Yeah, it's really sad, like if they did have a big brother, big sister
program --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- those, those people trying to help the kids, the parents might have
hostilities towards them, you know,

B.84:  Right, I think so, and uh,

A.85:  Like you're judging us, and I'm not good enough to raise my child, which
basically is true --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- It's, it's, it's, I'm glad I don't live in a big city --

B.88:  Uh-huh, yeah,

A.89:  -- just because, I mean, not just because I wouldn't feel safe, it's just
because that I would be reminded every day --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- of something that I don't see, and I might see it on a, you know, a
SIXTY MINUTES special.

B.92:  Uh-huh, no, in San Antonio it was like every day, it was just a matter of
who was shot that night,

A.93:  I know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city, believe it or
not [laughter].

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  I mean, they have all kinds of nice write ups about it --

B.96:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah, but,

A.97:  -- but any big city has a bad section. 

B.98:  But there's a lot of them, it's very prevalent, a lot of the crime is very
prevalent.

A.99:  Yes, they're very bold it seems.

B.100:  Uh-huh, very much.  When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change,
because it's such a small community, we're just above Carmel, and, um, there's
hardly, most everybody seems pretty well employed around here, and um, those
that aren't, there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive, which is
mostly migrant workers, and there's a lot of crime there, um, migrant Hispanic
farm workers, people that are down and out, and uh, they all seem to
congregate in Celinas, not so much here in Monterrey.  So, it's, it's pretty
quiet.  You know, we walk the streets at night, and, uh, people run in the
park, and you know, you're just, have your normal smarts about you, then you
really don't have to worry, or,

A.101:  Really, even, uh, even in the worst crime areas in Burlington, I, I can
walk the streets.  I wouldn't, I, if I did it every night --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- I think there would be trouble in our house, so you wouldn't get
confronted or anything --

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  -- but I don't think you would, uh, someone might grab you, mess around
with you, but they're not going to grab you, steal you-, your money and slit
your throat --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- which in a lot of big cities --

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  -- I mean that's what you, your going to have to expect that to happen.
People are just totally unfeeling.

B.110:  Uh-huh, uh, I didn't know that about Burlington, I'll have to keep that in
mind [laughter].
