=============================================================================

A.1:  Um, regarding health care, it's funny, because I have a sister who lives in
Europe --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and in Europe that's the way it is.  Health care,

B.4: They have socialized,

A.5:  is just,

B.6:  socialized health care.

A.7:  Right, exactly, and, um, the interesting thing is that it seems that they
don't even think about it.  It's not anything that seems to be, um, you know,
costing everybody a lot of money.  It's not a major topic of conversation.
It's just something that's done and accepted.

B.8:  How do they pay for it --

A.9:  Well, um --

B.10:  -- how is it financed?

A.11:  -- I think the government subsidizes most of it, but I, I believe that,
that, again, just people are taxed --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- a little bit more.  But it's just interesting how something, you know,
that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there
--

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- you know.  What do you feel about it?

B.16:  Well, I feel like something needs to be done here, and I'm definitely in
favor of the government, I just think me-, you know, medical costs have (( ))
I've seen over the years, just go up and up and up --

A.17:  Yes.

B.18:  -- and already just this year, you know, I'm a single parent, and, you
know, I have to pay for my coinsurance, and it's just outrageous --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- My son, you know, has got allergies --

A.21:  Um.

B.22:  -- and he's got this and he's got that, and he broke his arm, I mean, and,
you know, it's a thousand dollars here, a thousand dollars there --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and, you know, even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it,
you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- first of all, and then you're still paying --

A.27:  The twenty percent.

B.28:  -- yeah, the twenty percent.  And, so.

A.29:  And, and the sad part is that people to, to, you know, combat this, they
just won't go to the doctor --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- or they won't fill their prescriptions,

B.32:  Or they can't, yeah, they just can't

A.33:  I mean, that, you know, that's the alternative.

B.34:  Yeah, I've been in positions before where I've had to wait a few days, you
know, to have a prescription filled because I just didn't have it.

A.35:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.36:  And, I don't think that that's fair.  I don't think it's fair --

A.37:  I know,

B.38:  -- you know, to the kids, and, and to the people that are sick --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and I know that, you know, every city has, you know, their, their free
hospitals or whatever, and I know a few people that have had experiences in
those --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42: -- I've been fortunate enough not to, but I mean, you could go down there
half dead and sti-, wait, you know, it's hard to see a doctor --

A.43:  Oh, I know, I know,

B.44:  -- from what I've heard.

A.45:  Oh, yeah, it's true.  And, I don't think that that burden should be put on
companies, either.  I don't think that they should have to assume the
responsibility of paying for the person's health care.

B.46:  Well, yeah, there's a lot of people that, um, you know, don't work --

A.47:  Oh, yeah.

B.48:  -- you know --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and don't have, you know, any other means, they've, so they either don-,
again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- an arm and a leg for it --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- [Inhaling] You know, I'm thinking of, you know, I just did my tax return
for the last year --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- you know, if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your
income --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- you know, it's worthwhile to itemize --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and last year I, was the first year we reached that mark --

A.61:  Oh, you did,

B.62:  -- where my medical, where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses
--

A.63:  Wow.

B.64:  -- because they were just, they were that much of a percentage of my income
--

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- that it just --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- you know, I just did it, it's very frustrating (( )) a hot topic for me,

A.69:  I know, well, and well, you know, you're not the only one, though.  Um, I'm
in a situation where when I started my job they were paying full benefits.  I
thought, Great, you know, can't get any better --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and then slowly, each year, you know, now they're down to seventy-five
percent, and then they went down to fifty percent --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and I understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up,
but, um, you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your
salary, you know --

B.74:  Oh, at least, at least.

A.75:  -- to pay for this medical care, and then, I, I don't have kids, so I'm not
worrying about family coverage, but once you get into family coverage it's
crazy.

B.76:  Oh, it's out, it's outrageous.

A.77:  It's, it's just crazy.

B.78:  And then a lot of companies you know, offer, you know, you can have a
certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses --

A.79:  Yes.

B.80:  -- not covered by insurance, but, [inhaling] you know, that's something,
that's something fairly new, and not a lot of people take advantage of it, but
it's, you know, it's use it or lose it,

A.81:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.82:  I know people at the end of the year, you know, that have had that money
checked out regularly, and then it's like well, let's see, I guess I could go
get a new of glasses,

A.83:  Right, have a hundred dollars to spend in December.

B.84:  Get a (( )) crown done --

A.85:  I know what you mean  [laughter].

B.86:  -- you know, things like that.

A.87:  Yeah, we do that too.  We're fortunate though this year, somehow how it's
only March and we've already used up our entire amount --

B.88:  Oh, no.

A.89:  -- I don't know if that's good or bad.

B.90:  Well, um, do you think that, that, that the insurance and all, (( )) in
Europe, does it cover dental, or is it just medical?

A.91:  I don't know, um, I think it covers a portion, because, like I said, my
sister [child_yelling] lives over there, and they just, they just never have
to worry about it.  I think it might not cover full dental, but it does cover
some.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  And again, it covers, you know, major things, it won't cover cosmetic type
things --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- you know, if you choose to do something. [cough] But, um, it's just,
like all in, it's just all in practice, it's all in plan.  I think that we
could learn from that.

B.96:  What motivates people to go into medicine?  Are the doctors, you know, how,
how do the doctors,

A.97:  I don't know, I really don't know.  I know that they do equally as well
there as they do here.

B.98:  They do, so, they're getting paid.

A.99:  I mean, doctors still have that same status.  I don't know, I guess
they're getting paid for it, one way or another --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- and, and I would imagine, although I don't know, maybe there still are
private practices there.  I don't know.

B.102:  Yeah.  I don't know either.

A.103:  I don't know.  But, um, it would be great, and, and if only, I mean, health
is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with, you know
--

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  -- espec-, that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're
not, you know, they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills,
you know, they're, they're going to work every day because they're not sick.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  You know, I mean, it's just, some-, something that should be more of a
priority than it is now.  Yeah.

B.108:  I definitely agree, and I remember back in high school, being on the debate
team, and that was one of the subjects, one of the debates, Should we have,
you know, national health care --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- and I remember debating for it [laughter].

A.111:  Uh-huh.  Well, at least let them start off gradually.  You know, fine, so
they won't jump into paying full health care --

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  -- Let them pay, you know, partial and each year, just, you know, let's
increase it from there.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I don't know.  But,

B.116:  I don't know, it's going to be hard to switch.  I think that we're going
hav-, eventually end up, end up that way, though --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- I just don't see how we can,

A.119:  It'll take a while.  Maybe our grandchildren [laughter] will know it.

B.120:  I agree, it'll take a while --

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  -- But I think we have to be headed --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- [Sigh] have to be headed in that direction.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  Well, it was nice talking to you.

B.126:  Nice talking to you.

A.127:  Yeah, maybe one day we'll all have health care [laughter].

@@B.128:  First person from, not from Texas that I've talked to.

A.129:  It's what?

B.130:  You're the first person not from Texas that I've talked to.

A.131:  Oh, I know, like I said, everyone's been in from Texas.

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  All righty.  Well take care.

B.134:  Okay.

A.135:  Bye-bye.

B.136:  Bye-bye.
