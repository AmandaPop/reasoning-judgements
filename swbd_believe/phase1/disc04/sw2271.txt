============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  All right, there we go.  

B.3:  Yep.  

A.4:  So, what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke.  

B.5:  Well, I don't know about North Carolina, but, well, actually North Caroli-,
I think North Carolina's going to do pretty.  I think they'll go to the
finals.

A.6:  I mean, my gosh, uh, look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina.  I
mean they, they beat, uh, Arkansas --

B.7:  I know, Arkansas was good.  

A.8:  -- and they beat, and they beat -- 

B.9:  I can't believe,

A.10:  -- Ind-, they beat Indiana.  

B.11:  I can't,

A.12:  They creamed Indiana.  

B.13:  Yeah, I can't believe they beat Arkansas.  I thought Arkansas would go all
the way to the finals.

A.14:  Well, I, I thought so, too.  They, they just had a letdown in the second
half and they couldn't recover.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  Well, they say U N L V may be the greatest --

B.17:  I don't know {very faint}.

A.18:  -- amateur team ever.

B.19:  [Laughter] They beat Duke's ass last year.   

A.20:  Yeah, big time.  

B.21:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.22:  I, I'll bet they could hold their own in the N B A. 

B.23:  [Laughter] Think so.

A.24:  Seriously.  

B.25:  Really.  

A.26:  I, I bet there's teams they could beat.  

B.27:  Yeah.  Like the Hornets [laughter].  

A.28:  Possibly.  

B.29:  [Laughter] Anyone can beat the Hornets.  

A.30:  Yeah, actually I'm kind of a Lakers fan myself.  

B.31:  Yeah, me, too.  I like, uh, oh, the, uh, [talking] Magic.

A.32:  Oh, yeah, him and Worthy and, uh, 

B.33:  Dixie Green's pretty good.  

A.34:  Yeah, yeah he's good coming off the bench, now.  And, of course, the other,
they got Sam Perkins --

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  -- and that, that helps.

B.37:  I'm not much of an N B-, N B A fan --  

A.38:  Oh, okay --

B.39:  -- myself {faint}.

A.40:  -- well, you remember Sam Perkins when he was at North Carolina, don't you?

B.41:  Oh, no, I sure don't.  

A.42:  See, he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan. 

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  The, the three of those guys were the three pillars of the national
championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two, I think, when Jordan
was just a freshman.

B.45:  Yeah, I know it [noise]. 

A.46:  Yeah, in fact, uh, Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point with
like sixteen seconds to go.

B.47:  Huh.  

A.48:  The-, they gave him the ball, he took the shot, he makes it he's a hero, if
he misses it he's a goat.  He made it.

B.49:  Huh.  Made it.  

A.50:  Yep.

B.51:  Huh, huh.  How about, what do you think, who do you think is going to win
the final.

A.52:  [Breathing] Well, I really don't think anybody can beat U N L V.  They,
they might beat themselves, but, I don't know, they're at such a high-level of
intensity --

B.53:  Yeah.  I watched the,

A.54:  -- they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to
have a really on day.  And if that, if both of those happened at the same
time, you might have an upset.

B.55:  Yeah, they can keep on the pressure the whole game.  

A.56:  Yep.  Yep, they're absolutely relentless.  

B.57:  Pretty good.  

A.58:  Well, they're so close to an un-, undefeated season, they can taste it and
they want to make history, so I don't think they're going to lack for
motivation.

B.59:  Yeah.  They could be mighty mad, though [laughter]. 

A.60:  Well, I mean, it's, it's no disgrace to lose in the final four.

B.61:  Oh, yeah.  Well, the disgrace lay-, lose last year [laughter]. 

A.62:  Well, U N L V is kind of in a different league from everybody else.  It,
it's kind of similar to back when U C L A was winning seven titles in a row
from sixty-seven --

B.63:  Oh, yeah.  

A.64:  -- to seventy-three.  Back then they, they called -- 

B.65:  With Karim [laughter].  

A.66:  -- the un-, well, with him, yeah, and with Bill Walton and they used to
call it the, uh, the U C L A invitational,

B.67:  [Laughter].  

A.68:  because they figured everybody else is coming to, just to be there.

B.69:  Yeah.  Been a while since we had a straight winner.  

A.70:  Yeah.  I, I don't know that any one team is going to be able to dominate
for that many years in a row.

B.71:  Huh.  

A.72:  Uh, partly because the really outs-, many of the really outstanding players
leave college before they turn seniors.

B.73:  Yeah, like Jordan [laughter]. 

A.74:  So you don't, yeah.  So you don't really get to keep the, the nucleus of
your best talent for the whole four years.

B.75:  Huh {faint}. 

A.76:  Well, this has been fun.  I've enjoyed talking with you.  

B.77:  Okay.  

A.78:  And God bless and you have a good day, now.  

B.79:  All right, you, too.  Thanks.  

A.80:  Bye-bye.

B.81:  Bye.
