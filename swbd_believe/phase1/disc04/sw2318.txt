=============================================================================

A.1:  Yeah, so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on
the list.

B.2:  That's true.  

A.3:  Oh, we don't have capital punishment, I believe you do.  

B.4:  Yes, we do.  

A.5:  Oh. 

B.6:  We have, uh, the death by leth-, uh, by injection.  

A.7:  Yeah, the, the only thing about capital punishment is the, I, I remember
someone saying, I think it was a chief justice in this state, he goes, if you
make a mistake, how do you get the person back.  That's the whole, his whole
basis was if you do have that error, you know, some people have been in jail
for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then, you
know, if, if, if there, if you killed the person and it's like, oops, too bad.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  I mean I think I've heard of cases where someone did, they, uh, the, they
were, uh, it was capital punishment, they were killed and they found out years
later that, the, he really didn't kill the person.

B.10:  H-,

A.11:  I believe there was one case.  I don't, I don't know where I read it or
anything, but I think that there's has to, they have to have put innocent men
or women to death before, I mean.

B.12:  I'm sure that, that had to, has happened [noise], but then there's also
the, uh, number of people who have created, or committed murders, etcetera
that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row,
like, like, look at Charles Manson.  I mean, he just happened to have the
right timing [breathing].

A.13:  Yes (( )),  

B.14:  And yet, although he may never be free to kill again, there are a lot of
people like him that are free to kill again.

A.15:  I'm the type of person who sits, you know, it's the same thing about the
war, I'm this type person, you know you need it, but you're the one who, you
can't, you can't make the decision and go, yes or no.  I'd be a terrible
president because I would, you know, I knew we had to go to war and I --

B.16:  But I didn't want to do it [laughter].  

A.17:  -- know it was the best thing but I didn't, I would not want to be
responsible --

B.18:  Uh-uh.

A.19:  -- for people getting hurt if, you know, if, I don't know.  

B.20:  I don't think that I could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone
to death.

A.21:  Well like,  

B.22:  I, I, I would find that too difficult.  

A.23:  Yes, but like you say there, there's people out there that do such terrible
things.  I had one of the subjects was, uh, crime and it was talked about the,
the way society has worked out there's some people that are economically
trapped.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  And they really, their parents don't bring them up properly.  They have
absolutely no morals because no one taught them.

B.26:  Correct.  

A.27:  I mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart.  You're born with
it, you're, 

B.28:  Something that's taught.  

A.29:  It's something that's taught.  It's something on the streets that you see
so if it's a dog-eat-dog world --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- it, it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital
punishment, but I don't know how much of a deterrent it really is.

B.32:  I don't think it's a deterrent at all.  

A.33:  You don't think it's a deterrent.  

B.34:  I don't think that anyone that, uh, commits a murder actually thinks that
they will ever even, uh, be punished let alone put to death for it.  I mean,
look at the mentality of, of your average person who smokes cigarettes.  They
don't think they're going to get cancer yet it's written on every single
package.  Most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone
prosecuted to the, to the extent of the law.

A.35:  So, even though, even though you don't think it's a deterrent, which I have
a tendency to -gree, agree, I mean, it's a deterrent, it's, it's the ones like
carefully thinking it out and stuff.  They think about it, but a lot of the
street crime that goes on and stuff --

B.36:  Right.  

A.37:  -- they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them.
I can see where it's not a deterrent.

B.38:  Right.  I think for probab-, possibly the premeditated murders I think it's
possibly a deterrent, but --

A.39:  Yes.  

B.40:  -- for the, for the gang violence, the, uh, the street murders so to speak,
I don't think it is.

A.41:  Does it matter to you, do you have a lot of violence where you live?

B.42:  Not where I live, uh, but -- 

A.43:  Where you work?  

B.44:  -- I live outside of Dallas.  

A.45:  So is Dallas a bad city.  I talked to someone from San Antonio and the
barrio, she said it was very bad.

B.46:  The San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas.  

A.47:  Dallas.  

B.48:  Dallas does have, uh, an area of town, however the young men, I mean
sixteen to nineteen year old boys are shot and killed or sh-, at least shot,
frequently.  The, uh, the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds
here --

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  -- handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day.   

A.51:  Oh, jeez.  

B.52:  I mean a day [breathing].

A.53:  And that's relatively calm city.  

B.54:  Yeah.  It, it, obviously is not a D C, you know.  

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  It, it, I understand that Vermont's relatively calm.  

A.57:  Oh, it's very calm.  I mean you can, a-, our, uh, bad district, I wouldn't
advise going walking in there alone at night, but you could.  And if anyone
was bothering you, you could make such a fuss where people would come to your
aid even though you're in the worst part of the city.  Uh, the only difference
is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we,
we're a really [lipsmack] we're, uh, pampered up here.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  Uh, and when they do have a crime, a murder, let's, we had, quite a few
years ago a young, two young men, they were sixteen years old, uh, raped and
b-, and beat these two twelve year old girls really, died and it just shocked
the whole state.  I mean, how can anything happen like this and the guys that
did it were so ignorant.  They didn't even re-, they didn't, they didn't have
any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant that one
of them says, well, I didn't realize that w-, because I was beating her in the
head that she was really going to die on me.  You know, it's like, although,
why did you do it, she was screaming, all's I wanted to do was shut her up.
He, he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her.  The
kids were really quite ignorant about it and it, it was a tragedy on both
sides.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  But it just shocked the, uh, the state that something like this could
happen.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  I mean, usually if something, if someone robs in the night or something
and, uh, a home owner confronts him, I mean it's not a blaze of guns and
stuff, you know, the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start
running.  I mean, if this happened in the city, the, I'm sure the youth would
be armed and just take the family out.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  I mean we're really fortunate to live here.  But, doing these conversations
it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that can't, can't get out of
the situation they're in and they're, they'll eventually end up, even if they
want to be good kids, they'll eventually end up, uh, more or less victims of
crimes even though they're doing the crimes --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- they're more or less a victim.  

B.68:  Yeah.  Yes, they're the, they're the victims of neglect and, and, uh, many
years of, of perpetuated nonconcern for human life.

A.69:  Yes, it's, it's really sad.  

B.70:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's just a lack of concern.  They don't have, you know,
these kids, the ones that are involved in, you know, gangs, I think are
searching for self-esteem and they find something like that in, uh, their gang
activities and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if
they happen to know their parents.

A.71:  Yes, it's, bad.  Sometimes the kids have no choice because the parents are
j-, are worse.  I mean it, they'll do drugs in front of their kids, they bring
the boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids.  They, they treat them
like little slaves, they holler at --

B.72:  And it,

A.73:  -- they hit them.  And they go, they go to the gangs more or less for, uh,
family.  Oh, this guys nice to me, he doesn't hit me [laughter].

B.74:  Yeah, the, uh, the, we were shocked two mornings ago with, uh, the news
that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son for forty dollars
worth of crack.

A.75:  Oh, jeez.  

B.76:  And they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying
to sell, you know, they were trying to sell the baby or the boy.  And he's
three years old.  They were trying to sell him on the black market.

A.77:  That's stupid.  

B.78:  I mean, can you, that, that just repulsed me.  And it repulsed everybody
that I work with.  I mean it, you know we, 

A.79:  We sit up here on our fence posts judging, but we're not there, but it's
just, it is totally unheard of that you, you, you even think it would happen.

B.80:  And it was just, you know -- 

A.81:  Oh, g-.  

B.82:  -- t-, twenty miles from me [laughter].  

A.83:  Yeah, I know.  

B.84:  It's, it's, it's, it's real strange.  It's, it's a world that, uh, is, the
drugs are, the drugs are going to get us all.  I mean, drugs [laughter]
actually, I think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people.  I think
we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs.  Not the
kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better.  I'm
talking about the people, you know, who are bringing it to our country.

A.85:  Oh,

B.86:  I think they deserve capital punishment because they kill.  

A.87:  Yeah w-,

B.88:  They kill a lot.   

A.89:  Well, then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going
to, uh, institute the death penalty, or, or was it life in prison or whatever
for the drug kingpins.  I don't,

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  It's, it's so full of bullshit [laughter].  The, the drug war is just t-,
you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into
it, I mean --

B.92:  That's true.  

A.93:  -- you know, months ago, the, the military ...
