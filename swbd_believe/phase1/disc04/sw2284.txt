======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  What opinion do you have about what was, what happened?  [Dishes].

B.4:  Well, I, it's, it's a real mixed, um, feeling about it.  Uh, it's really
good that we did well --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- and that, uh, we, we went in and did what we set out to do.  I, I have,
there's been like a lot of things said about if it was a political, if it was
a war for oil or a war for ideals, and seems to be real mixed between those
two things.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Um, I don't know, I think the, the guy should have been ousted out of 
there --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and now we don't seem to be as interested in, in doing what's right --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- as we were when we started the whole thing.

A.13:  Yeah, see I feel like, I don't know, I feel like there's motivation, Bush
is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he's a member, he was a member of
the Skull and Bones at, I think at Princeton or Yale.

B.14:  Yale.

A.15:  Yale.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  And, uh, his motivation goes, I don't feel like he is absolutely on the up
and up with us on, you know, the mot-, the true motivation.  He talks a lot
about the New World Order --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean, and
I, maybe I'm being, maybe I'm assuming, but I don't think most real-, really
don't, and so I feel like the real motivation was something that, uh, most
people have absolutely no idea, and that that motivation is to, um, you know,
to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the
[meow] Middle East world so that they will [meow] submit under their, uh, One
World Order.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  Well, like that's what I felt, so I'm like going, um, am I glad we went
over there and did that?  Um, I think God's ultimately be in charge, and, you
know, I'm not afraid of what they've done, I'm not afraid of Saddam Hussein.
I feel he's lost and, you know, he needs to get saved just like everybody
else, but --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- you know, I just, I guess I have kind of like, um, kind of real cautious
in the whole thing because I know that there's a motive that hasn't been
openly discussed or revealed to anybody --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- and, uh, that's where, that's why I really don't have a real set
opinion, because I don't know everything --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- I don't mu-, you could watch the news all the time but you don't know
anything hardly, and he did talk about that, though.  He did men-, at least he
did mention that, you know what I'm saying, I don't think most people
understand what he's talking about when he talks about that New World Order.
So.  I don't know, what do you think about?

B.28:  It's, it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up, that's for sure
[dishes].  It doesn't, it's, they have far too much influence over there and
they're so unstable that it makes it hard for, um, it makes it hard for us to
deal with them.  I have that same problem at work [laughter] --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- Our plant is so unstable it makes it [laughter] difficult to plan 
ahead --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- or do anything, that, that's --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- productive.  

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  And, I can understand why he, he felt he needed to go over there.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  On the other hand, it's too bad that he couldn't use this, I know the oil's
real important to our life style --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- but it's too bad he couldn't use this as a (( )) --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- to say, let's conserve more.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Because he never said that, during the whole war, he never put out like a,
a conservation effort --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- for oil.

A.47:  But the motivation though, see wasn't, didn't have anything, I don't
believe it had anything to do with the oil, because, I think, I, I feel like
the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power, not to
disperse the oil, but to, there were big problems for the, the unifying of the
E E C, the European Economic Community --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- which is going to become, I mean, they're going to be, they're going to
put us under if we don't become part of the New World Order next year, the
United States, if we don't, I mean, we're going to be in big trouble, because
when Europe unites, and that's why T I -s building plants in Italy, because
they're going to have power like we can't imagine --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- because I think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing, and it
looks real good, but in the end, I just see that ultimately, who's going to be
in charge of this One World Order, you know what I mean, is, is George Bush
really any better than Saddam Hussein, or does he just look better, do you
know what I saying?

B.52:  [Laughter] Right.

A.53:  I mean, I think one person in power that's not really seeking God and
wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very
dangerous, and I don't see that this one world, this New World Order that him
and Gorbachev keep talking about, I just don't see that, um, that's just a
real good thing.

B.54:  But.

A.55:  I think it's something that's going to help him, but, I guess, I feel like
it's going to happen with the war.  That was the motive of the war, was to try
and break that up and, so that they could be, you know, get more power over
that Arab land, you know, and try and next year really start pushing this New
World Order.  He talks about it all the time, I mean --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- that's all he talks about, but, anyway, there's a good book by Leonard
Abraham, you probably have heard of NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON and --

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  -- CALL IT CONSPIRACY, well, CALL IT CONSPIRACY is a real good book, and he
talks a lot about this.  I heard him interviewed some, so I think it's kind of
interesting, but, anyway, he probably has a new book out that I don't know
about yet, because I haven't heard him in a while, but, I don't know, well
that's kind of my feeling on the war, I'm kind of like, No, [laughter] it's
all power plays, you know, there's so much stuff going on we don't know 
about --

B.60:  Oh, yeah, it's 

A.61:  -- you know, I'm like, uh, hey, Peter Jennings, you know, he knows a little
bit, but,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  [Laughter] I mean, we would all die if we knew what was really going on,
I mean --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- all of America would probably go into a coronary and die,

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  [Laughter] well, they would,

B.68:  I know, I agree,

A.69:  {Imitating speech in a high pitched voice} (( )) that they're doing this,
but, it doesn't change anything, so I'm just like, I don't know, just, I mean,
I was p-, most people probably think I don't even have a high school
education, you know, because of my attitude about it, but I just feel like
there's so much going on, but, you know, hey, I'm going to pray about it, and
[laughter] if I feel led to vote for a certain person, I'm going to do it, but
I'm not going to get all up tight about all this and stuff, you know.

B.70:  Well, you can't, yeah.

A.71:  Huh-uh, because I know at first we were watching the news a lot, and, man,
it was like (( )) all the time, and I thought, Gee, you know, God's going to
protect Israel and he starts, he starts nuking {nuclear bombing} Israel he's
in big trouble,

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  we'll hear about it, you know what I mean --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- anything major happens we're going to find out, so let's chill out and
just do what we need to do.

B.76:  Yeah that's where I got to, too.  The first, I got chills up and down when
I heard the, on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing.

A.77:  I know it was kind of exciting at first, but --

B.78:  Yeah,

A.79:  -- and then I know, the first night of the bombing we had, was a Wednesday,
and we had home church, and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a
sixteen year old.  And so, we, you know, we're on the way to home church, and
the bombing's just begun, you know, and we go into the birthday party for a
surprise party --

B.80:  Oh,

A.81:  -- that was, you know, we just went from one extreme to the other, you
know, and we felt kind of, it was like, man, this is really hard, you know, I
want to watch the war,

B.82:  [Laughter].

A.83:  and so, imagine the sixteen year old, yeah we're having a surprise
birthday party and a war started in Israel [laughter].

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  That'll be a good story when she's thirty, won't it.

B.86:  Right, it will be.

@@A.87:  Well, anyway, I guess, do you think we're finished.

B.88:  I guess so.

A.89:  I think so too.  I don't know if we did what we were supposed to, but,

B.90:  Yeah, we talked.

A.91:  Yeah, we did, they can do a lot of resear-, we get along good too.  Some of
the callers you don't along with that good, you know, you have, you know what
I'm saying.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  Isn't that funny.  I bet they're going to do a lot of research on that.

B.94:  [Laughter] Oh, yeah, one, one guy I talked to about, about colleges.  He
was very opinionated and --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- it was difficult [laughter].

A.97:  Yeah, he probably had those glasses on, like, you know, those Annie Hall
kind of glasses,

B.98:  Yeah, real thick.

A.99:  I don't know what you call, John Lennon glasses, that's what they are.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  The women I call Annie Hall glasses, but, if, I don't know if they're Annie
Hall glasses or not, I just, I don't know, I always think of Annie Hall when I
see them.

B.102:  Yeah, I think they're versions of that.

A.103:  Really.

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  I know, the female version of John Lennon's, but,

B.106:  Yeah [laughter].

A.107:  I know, I talked to some guy who was, I talked to some of the Yuppie types,
you know, and they're pretty interesting, but yeah, they're real opinionated,
but I guess that's better than nothing, you know.

B.108:  Yeah, yeah.

A.109:  But any-, yeah, it's been interesting, though, all these different people,
and some of them are real friendly, you know, and it's like, Yeah, man, when I
come to Dallas I'll call you, you know, and then others don't even relate.
They just want to go.  And then some of them have babies crying in the
background, too.  So.  There may be other reasons than --

B.110:  Right.

A.111:  -- you know, that, but, well, anyway, are you in Dallas?

B.112:  Yeah, I'm in Dallas, I didn't know that people from other parts of the
country were doing this.

A.113:  Yeah, I had a guy from Rhode Island, that we talked about fishing, so.
And, uh, I, I've had people in Massachusetts and Vermont.  They work at T I up
there.  Do you work at T I?

B.114:  No, my husband does.

A.115:  See, mine does too, in Dallas, and uh,

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  Yeah, but, no, there's T I -s up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy
talked about fishing, and I asked him if he took his wife, and he didn't have
a wife, and I felt bad that, Well, I'm sorry. and he goes, we're divorced,
well, I'm sorry --

B.118:  Oh, no.

A.119:  -- it was real sad, but he was pretty nice and stuff, and then him and my
husband started talking salary.

B.120:  [Laughter].

A.121:  How do you make up in Rhode Island.  So I was just going, wait a minute,
we're supposed to be talking about fishing, now stop, but, anyway, is that
funny, but we did talk about fishing, though, so, well, I guess I'll let you
go. I'm going to finish my dishes and if anything [meow] happens interesting
in the war [meow] maybe they'll have another [meow] thing and I'll get you
again.

B.122:  Okay.

A.123:  All right.

B.124:  All right.  Thanks,

A.125:  Bye,

B.126:  Bye-bye.
