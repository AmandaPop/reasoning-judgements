REMARKS:        A great deal of the middle of the conversation was no
sound.  I put it together using the monologues.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Yes, Jack, have you had your car repaired lately?

B.2:  Have I what?

A.3:  Have you had your automobile repaired?

B.4:  [Throat_clearing]  Excuse me.  Well, I'm not much of one for getting my
hands dirty, I never cared for that, but I do, uh, well like last weekend I
was, uh, attaching a tow hitch to the front of my little pickup so I could,
uh, tow it behind my motor home --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and I'm telling you, the air around Plano here turned blue before the
day was through.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Oh, it, it was a very simple thing to do, and I didn't start until three in
the afternoon, because I thought, oh, maybe an hour, two hours at the most --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- eight thirty that night I'm still working out there under the flood
lights.

A.11:  Was this a mechanical hitch?

B.12:  Yes, yes.

A.13:  So you didn't have, there was no welding involved.

B.14:  No, no, all nuts and bolts.

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  But trying to get the holes to line up --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- I mean, I had to loosen the front bumper --

A.19:  Well [laughter].

B.20:  -- and, I, you would be amazed, you, you think, well there's just two bolts
on each side that holds the bumper.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Huh-uh.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  No, no such luck.  No, uh, I don't go in, like I say, I don't go in for,
uh, any deep repairs, especially with today's automobiles that are computer
controlled and everything.

A.25:  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I've got a, a similar problem.  I used to work, uh,
believe it or not, repairing cars, about, uh, twenty years ago --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and didn't think anything about doing my own repair work, and I, about
twenty years ago I, I got a real job, and [laughter] I've been doing it ever
since, and I've been away from it for so long now, when I decided to do
something to my car, I couldn't.  Uh, my first experience was, uh, try to do
something with the, uh, the exhaust system on my car --

B.28:  Uh oh.  

A.29:  -- Try to work, out in the driveway, kind of cool outside, no lifts, so you
had to work with car jacked up enough up on blocks --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- pulling the pipes apart, not having the right equipment, uh, because I
knew what right equipment I needed, because I used to work in a garage, I
didn't have any pipe spreaders or chisels uh designed to do that, and it would
take me two or three times longer than it normally would to, you know, get the
professional to do it.

B.32:  Uh-huh, that's always the way,

A.33:  So I started, so I started taking my car to the garage, and, uh, I had a
little squeak, in fact, it was about a year ago.  When I applied my foot on
the brakes, and I, I'd, I'd been experiencing this squeak for quite a while,
so I stopped at one of these speedy muffler places, uh --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- to have them look at my wheel bearing, because my wheel bearing needed
grease, and, uh, after waiting a half an hour to get on the lift, I, uh, was
there, and he pulled the first wheel off, the one that I said that was
squeaking, and he said the bearing looks good.  So he pulled the other left
front wheel off, and he says, Uh, I think I've got the problem.  I says,
what's that.  He says, Your brakes are no good.  So he says, Want me to pull
the back off?  I says, No.  And so [laughter] he pulled them off anyway
[laughter].

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  So then he says, Uh-huh, you need brakes on the front, you need brakes on
the back.  I said, Well, jeez, you know, I only stopped here to get a wheel
bearing put in, and I says, I didn't, you know, I didn't have, uh, slightest
idea I needed brakes.

B.38:  Well, you know, I ran into the very same problem back last Christmas.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Uh, let's see, where was I.  I was over in Mississippi --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and, uh, driving, at that time I had this little Ford Escort, which tows
like a little baby behind a motor home.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And I dearly loved it for that.  But, uh, I was out driving around, looking
at the sights, well, this is Vicksburg, so I was looking at the Civil War
battleground, and I developed this hellacious squealing, just like you did,
only mine sounded like, uh, it was coming from the depths of hell somewhere
that, kind, kind, kind of a squeal.

A.45:  It was a continuous squeal?

B.46:  Yeah, and it was more outstanding when I turned in one direction --

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  -- rather than the other.

A.49:  What, uh, uh, this is, evidently it's a new technology that, uh, that came
about after I worked in my garage.  Twenty years they didn't have such a
thing.  But, what, what they've got now is like a little metal tab --

B.50:  Yes.

A.51:  -- that, uh, that, that, that's designed to squeak, when, uh, you know,
before the thing that they used to use was, uh, once, your, let me see, once
the pad reached the level of the rivet head, then that was time to change your
brakes.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Unfortunately you couldn't see it until you pulled the wheel off.  So, they
needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed.  So they came up
with that.

B.54:  Well (( )).

A.55:  But I didn't finish telling you my, uh, my story, that was only the
beginning.

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  After he pulled all my for wheels off, he says, you're going to need new
brakes.  So I said, Well, what is that going to cost.  So he said, Well, let
me figure it out.  So he says, Well, probably a couple of hundred dollars.  So
I says, Well, I said, that isn't too bad, why don't you go ahead and do it.
So he, but I says give me an est-, a written estimate.  So he went around, and
he says, Well, your back drum is no good, I can't turn it down, because it's
oversize, and you need new this, and you need new that, and he come up with a
bill of seven hundred and forty-eight dollars.  I've got a [laughter],

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  I've got a Cadillac [laughter].

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  So, --

B.62:  No wonder.

A.63:  -- I says, No, I says, I don't want to do it, I said put it back together.
He says, I don't know if I can [laughter].  So, I'm stuck over there, I've got
my car all apart --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and he's telling me he doesn't know if he can put it back together
again.  I says, Well, I came in here with a car with four wheels on, I said I
going to leave with four wheels.  So he says, Well, why do you want to put it
all back together again if you know you need brakes. Because he showed me, and
I did, in fact, need brakes.  And I was going to do it myself, and I just, you
know, it, it, I shuddered, because every time I try to work on my car lately,
I don't have all the right tools, and it ends up taking my twice as long.  So
then he turned around and said, I can give you a fifteen or ten percent
discount if you do it now.  So I says, Okay.  So it ended up costing me almost
six hundred, almost seven hundred dollars --

B.66:  Oh, boy.

A.67:  -- for that complete brake, and I just stopped for a squeak [laughter].

B.68:  Well, I guess I was pretty lucky, it only ended up costing my eighty-five
dollars, but of course, all I got was the front brakes.

A.69:  Well, the place that I've been going to, because I own a cadillac, you
can't go to a garage, you have to go to a dealer, uh --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- they charge thirty-six to forty-five dollars an hour, and, uh, I had
trouble with my fan, on my blower.  It, my, my high speed wouldn't, would not
work.  My low speed blower would work, but my high speed wouldn't.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  So I says, I'm not even going to, not even going to try it.  I'm going to
take it right down there and tell the guy to put it in.  So, I, uh, I went
down, I picked it up, picked up the car when it was all done.  And I says,
Well, how much is it?  And the part came to, I don't know, twenty-seven
dollars, and the labor came to something like fifteen dollars, which is
unusual, because I --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- never get out of that place for less than two hundred.  So I'm saying to
myself, if he only charged me fifteen dollars, that meant that he only worked
on it for about twenty minutes, and, and I said, just for the heck of it, I
want to open up the hood to see what he worked on.  Honest to God, the, the
blower, a two year old could have changed it.  It was right on top, I didn't
even bother looking, because inside my car --

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  -- looks like, uh, all tubes and wires and vacuums and --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- hoses, and, and this blower is sitting right on top of everything, and
it was only two little screws holding it down --

B.80:  Oh, for Pete's sake.

A.81:  -- so it took him about five minutes, and he charged me a half an hour's
worth of labor,

B.82:  Well, I thought they had a minimum charge of one hour.  

A.83:  No, evidently they, uh, they gave me a half hour minimum, is what they
charged me.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  Say are you from Boston, by any chance?

A.85:  Yes, I am [laughter] Can you tell by the accent?

B.86:  I'm afraid so, the car in the garage.

A.87:  Garage [laughter] I've, uh, I've had an opportunity to visi-, visit Dallas
and put some presentations down there, and every time I open my mouth
[laughter] people want to hear me say the word car.

B.88:  Where are you located right now?

A.89:  Attleboro, Massachusetts.

B.90:  Oh, no. (( ))

A.91:  I'm in the T I (( )).

B.92:  I'm in, I'm in Dallas.

A.93:  Uh-huh, well, I gathered that.  For some reason the people down in Dallas,
don't know that they also have an acc-, an accent [laughter].

B.94:  Well, I shouldn't have, because I'm a damn Yankee myself.

A.95:  Well, you are, but you do have a Southern, Southern, uh, drawl, I can --

B.96:  Well,

A.97:  -- I can tell that you're from, uh, the Southern, uh,

B.98:  I've spent better than half my life in Tennessee, North Carolina, 
Florida --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- Louisiana, Mississippi,

A.101:  Oh, so you've got a, you don't have a strong, uh, a strong accent, but the
people I was talking to, the guy that I was talking to last night had, uh, a
stronger accent.

B.102:  Um, well, twenty-five years ago I was in the radio business --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- commercial radio,

A.105:  Oh, so that helped.

B.106:  And, well, I was a D J at the time, and I, I really worked on losing my New
York accent --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and, uh, I like to think I managed to stay away from it, but you're
right, I do catch myself every once in a while talking along with
{imitating Southern speech} that Southern accent once in a while.

A.109:  [Laughter] It's not, it's not very strong, but it's there.

B.110:  Okay, so, uh.

A.111:  So, on, on the, on the car repairs.  Have you ever had any other
interesting things happen to you, or do you do your own repair work at all,
or, like I change my oil myself --

B.112:  Oh, oh, yeah, that I do and I've been,

A.113:  -- only because I'm too cheap to pay somebody, uh, twice the value of the
oil and the filter to,

B.114:  Well, I do it on my motor home --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- because it means, if I take it somewhere to do it, I have to take it to
an R V dealer --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- because local stations just aren't big enough to handle a motor home --

A.119:  Right, right.

B.120:  -- and so I do the, I change the oil myself, but something I have been
putting off for too long now is flushing out the radiator.

A.121:  Oh.

B.122:  That I've got to do this weekend.  I've been promising and promising to do
it.

A.123:  Why, uh, why do you feel as if you have to do that?  To keep it clean?

B.124:  Oh, yes definitely.  I had, uh, oh, a few years ago, I had a Ford one fifty
pickup --

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  -- and I didn't take very good care of it all, I must admit, red faced I
must admit that I didn't take care of the basics, and I never did drain, I
didn't even drain the radiator.  Every winter I'd check it, and, uh, well, it
was several years, many years have gone,
