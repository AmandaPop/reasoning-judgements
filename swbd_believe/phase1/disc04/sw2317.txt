REMARKS:        Speaker B sounded like she was smoking during the
conversation.  I could hear her puff, inhale and blow out at various 
times during the tape.

=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay [laughter].  

A.2:  [Laughter].  

B.3:  What kind of hobbies do you have?  

A.4:  Well, if, uh, I like to, I like to make stuffed animals.  I, I sort of have
not been doing as much as I did, you know, before I had to work for real
[laughter].

B.5:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.6:  But, I like to do things like that and, uh, you know, bottle covers and --

B.7:  Um.  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  -- that sort of stuff.  And dancing.  

B.9:  Oh. 

A.10:  The dancing I've, I've kept up with because, you know, you don't have to,
well, you don't have to get a lot of stuff out, you know [laughter].

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  What do you do?  

B.13:  Well, I sew.  

A.14:  Oh. 

B.15:  Clothes, you know.  

A.16:  Yeah.  

B.17:  That's like a hobby, because I don't ever make anybody nothing but me
[laughter].

A.18:  [Laughter]. 

B.19:  Or maybe little kids.  I've, I've done weddings, but -- 

A.20:  Oh, wow.  

B.21:  -- not, not, not big weddings, like, you know -- 

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  -- big, big weddings, just bride's maid's dresses and stuff like that for
people that I know --

A.24:  Yeah.  

B.25:  -- you know, so.  

A.26:  Yeah, wow.  

B.27:  [Laughter]  I don't want to be paid to do it because then it becomes a job
and then it's not a hobby, you know.

A.28:  Yeah, and then it, then it puts a lot of responsibility on you.

B.29:  Lot of stress, too.  

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  You know --

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- especially, I don't want to do this, I don't want to do that, so then
it's not a hobby, it's more of a job, but I like to sew, you know --

A.34:  Oh, well that,  

B.35:  -- it calms me down.  

A.36:  Yeah.  

B.37:  [Laughter]. 

A.38:  [Laughter] I like to sew, too, but, you know, if I'm not in the mood to
sew I can screw things up like you wouldn't believe.

B.39:  Oh, yeah.  And then I go ballooning.  

A.40:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.41:  Hot ai-,

A.42:  And then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years, at least.

B.43:  No, hot, I go hot air ballooning.  

A.44:  Oh, do you really?  

B.45:  Yeah, in a hot, a hot air -- 

A.46:  Oh, wow.  How -- 

B.47:  -- in a hot air balloon.  

A.48:  -- exciting.  

B.49:  Yes, now that's fun [laughter].  

A.50:  Oh, I'll bet.  

B.51:  And, uh, well I don't, I don't own a balloon, but I crew for a guy, he owns
two balloons --

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  -- and he'll call us up and say, let's go, and so we'll meet, you know,
real early in the morning.  People think we're crazy because we get up so
early in the morning.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  But I love it [laughter].  

A.56:  Oh, that's neat.  

B.57:  And I always tell people, if you ever go up in one, you just, that's it,
you be hooked [laughter].

A.58:  Yeah.  

B.59:  And they're so pretty and, 

A.60:  Is it, is it hard to make it come down when you want to?  

B.61:  Well, you don't have a choice.  

A.62:  Oh, it just comes down when it wants to.  

B.63:  Well, you don't have a choice of where you're going.  So -- 

A.64:  Yeah.  

B.65:  -- when you get ready to come down, you have to, you know, it's more or
less like letting the air out.  He can land more or less where he wants to.

A.66:  Uh-huh.  

B.67:  It's just that there's no, like if he wants to go one place, he would have
to know which way the wind's --

A.68:  Right.  

B.69:  -- blowing.  

A.70:  Yeah.  

B.71:  But, other than that, that's the only fall back, you know.  Because the
winds change and goes the other direction [laughter].

A.72:  [Laughter]. 

B.73:  And we, we have to follow him around, you know.  

A.74:  Yeah.  

B.75:  [Laughter].  

A.76:  Well, have you flown in one of those where they have a whole bunch that go,
you know, like up at one time.

B.77:  Yeah, that's just Plano.  They have Plano festival.

A.78:  Yeah. 

B.79:  [Lipsmack] Uh,

A.80:  How long have they been doing that?  

B.81:  Let's see, now I think we're on number eight or tenth.  We're almost to
number ten I think.  Because I've been here --

A.82:  Oh, that's neat.  

B.83:  -- ten years.  So, yeah, and then Mesquite is five.  They do one in
Mesquite [lipsmack].

A.84:  What about that one they do in Albuquerque.  

B.85:  That's old.  

A.86:  Yeah.  

B.87:  That is, that is like, 

A.88:  That's the oldest one, isn't it?  

B.89:  Yeah, that's the largest one in the world.  They have over six hundred
balloons.

A.90:  Wow.  

B.91:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.92:  [Laughter] How many do they have, like, at the Plano one?  

B.93:  About sixty.  It's getting larger.  

A.94:  Yeah.  

B.95:  Last year I think we had eighty.  

A.96:  Yeah, probably every year, it will,  

B.97:  Uh-huh.  More people get involved and stuff like that.  

A.98:  Yeah.  

B.99:  But, you have sponsored balloons, you know, like, companies like Coors,

A.100:  Yeah -- 

B.101:  Uh, 

A.102:  -- because those things are pretty expensive, aren't they.  

B.103:  Yeah.  Oldsmobile, they all have balloons, you know.  

A.104:  Uh-huh.  

B.105:  The, I B M had one last year.  Now, T I don't have one and Rockwell, I
mean, you know, Rockwell, they don't have one, Rockwell, whatever it is.

A.106:  Uh-huh.  

B.107:  None of the major electronic companies have them, but, uh, like,
Southwestern Bell, Seven-Up, they have balloons.

A.108:  Yeah, I had a friend at T I in Detroit a long time ago that had one that a
bank --

B.109:  Yeah.  

A.110:  -- had sponsored.  

B.111:  Yeah, now banks, they sponsor different banks out here like Bank One
sponsored one, one year.  And I can't think of the rest of them.  But they,
they, you know, they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is
just put the name of the bank or whoever is sponsoring that ball-, --

A.112:  Yeah.  

B.113:  -- that balloon.  Yeah, it's pretty good.

A.114:  And it looks so pretty when they're all -- 

B.115:  Uh.  

A.116:  -- you know, when there's a bunch of them that way.  

B.117:  Oh, yeah.  It's so peaceful.  We went out to Texas Stadium one time
[lipsmack] for a Boy Scout Jamboree --

A.118:  Uh-huh.  

B.119:  -- and we, we was inside of the stadium like, like I was thinking it, the
Astrodome --

A.120:  Uh-huh.  

B.121:  -- and they filled it up, the football field -- 

A.122:  Yeah.  

B.123:  -- and inflated all the balloons -- 

A.124:  Oh. 

B.125:  -- and it's, it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top --

A.126:  Yeah.  

B.127:  -- it looked like you could just dive off and, and,

A.128:  [Laughter]. 

B.129:  and bounce on a bunch of pillows, you know.  

A.130:  Wow.  

B.131:  It was good.  It was fun, I had fun.  But -- 

A.132:  Sounds fun.  

B.133:  -- that's, that's my, that's probably my main hobby.  That, sewing and
reading books.  That's about it.

A.134:  Oh, I like to read, too.  

B.135:  Do you really.  

A.136:  What kind of books do you like?  

B.137:  Romance [laughter].  

A.138:  [Laughter] Yeah, I like those.  I like mys-, I like murder mysteries,
too.

B.139:  Uh-huh.  

A.140:  Have you ever read any Dean Koontz?   

B.141:  Uh-uh.  

A.142:  He's, he's sort of, i-, he, he writes real good.  It's the kind, though,
that you don't want to start if you have to --

B.143:  Go anywhere.  

A.144:  -- put it down or anything.  

B.145:  Yeah.  

A.146:  Yeah.  Yeah, the, he does.  Well, they're sort of scary, you know, but
they're, they're just really, really good.

B.147:  Uh-huh.  

A.148:  THE WATCHERS, you know, they made a movie of THE WATCHERS, here not too
long ago --

B.149:  Uh-huh.  

A.150:  -- and that was a book that he wrote.  That, that was my favorite one.
It's about this dog named Einstein, and this --

B.151:  Huh.  

A.152:  -- it was, he was an experimental government thing, you know --

B.153:  Uh-huh.  

A.154:  -- and they were trying to do like, like robotic stuff and everything.

B.155:  Oh, I seen that movie.  

A.156:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.157:  Yeah.  

A.158:  Well, the book was just ever so much better.  

B.159:  Really.  

A.160:  Yeah, it was great.  

B.161:  I don't like, I don't like scary books [laughter].  

A.162:  [Laughter].  

B.163:  I, I can't read those.  I get paranoid [laughter].

A.164:  You like, uh, uh, who is it, uh, Victoria, Victoria Holt, is that right.

B.165:  Yeah, she's one.  

A.166:  Yeah, those are good, I like those.  

B.167:  But I like, I, I'm a Danielle Steele fan.  

A.168:  Oh, really.  

B.169:  Yeah.  

A.170:  Well that's, I, 

B.171:  I have every book the woman's ever wrote.  

A.172:  Really.  

B.173:  And two of her books have been on, three of them's been on TV. 

A.174:  Yeah.  

B.175:  And I got all three of them on tape.  And I'm going to this other one
that's coming on Monday.

A.176:  Oh.

B.177:  CHAN-,

A.178:  What, what, what one is that?  

B.179:  CHANGES.  

A.180:  Um.  

B.181:  And I had the book and I hadn't read it in so long so I read it the other
day to see if I could, so I can watch the movie [laughter].

A.182:  [Laughter] Yeah, usually the -- 

B.183:  The book is always --  

A.184:  -- the movies are not as good. 

B.185:  -- the book is always better.  

A.186:  Yeah.  

B.187:  You know.  But, you know, but because I know some of the stuff like that
one Judith Krantz made, that was [lipsmack], they did that one really, they
did okay, but I liked the book better.

A.188:  Uh-huh.  

B.189:  It was good.  

A.190:  Yeah, that's usually the way it is.  

B.191:  Uh-huh.  

A.192:  Sometimes, they just change them completely.  

B.193:  Yeah.  And you think it's the same, but it's really not.  

A.194:  Yeah.  

B.195:  Uh-huh.  

A.196:  Like JAWS.  Do you remember JAW-, did you, 

B.197:  Yeah.  The book was different from the, 

A.198:  Yeah, the book was a lot better, I thought.  

B.199:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  

A.200:  [Laughter] But, they just, they just,

B.201:  So what else do you like to do besides,

A.202:  Well, my dancing is, I, I like to belly dance.  

B.203:  Oh, belly dance.  

A.204:  Yeah.  

B.205:  You mean like those little thin, in the little, roll the bellies.

A.206:  Yeah.  

B.207:  I can't do that.  

A.208:  [Laughter].  

B.209:  I've always tried to do that.  

A.210:  [Laughter].  

B.211:  I've always wanted to, though, and it, how people can get they stomach,

A.212:  Well, you know, it's, it's real funny, because when I first started, it was
like, I saw someone at a Halloween party, this lady was from Turkey --

B.213:  Uh-huh.  

A.214:  -- and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old, you know, 
so --

B.215:  Yeah.  

A.216:  -- I thought, well, jeez, you know, that looks like fun.  I'll learn that
in a couple of weeks.  Ha [laughter].

B.217:  Yeah, right [laughter].  

A.218:  You know, I mean, you could just, you could just take lessons for forever,
I think.

B.219:  Um.  

A.220:  Course, I'm tend to be a slow learner, I guess anyway, but, it's a lot of
fun and it's, it's a good way to get exercise, you know, fooling yourself,
because you don't realize you're getting exercise.

B.221:  Um.  

A.222:  You know, it's so much fun you don't really think about it.  And
exercising, I mean, let's face it, exercising stinks [laughter].

B.223:  Um.  

A.224:  Oh, I go aerobics classes and stuff but,  

B.225:  I like that.  

A.226:  Do you?  

B.227:  Yeah.  I like aerobics.  

A.228:  Are you d-, do you, are you at T I in -- 

B.229:  In Dallas.  

A.230:  -- Dallas.  So, so you go to the fitness center.  

B.231:  No.  

A.232:  No?

B.233:  I go to Jazzercize.  

A.234:  Oh, yeah.  

B.235:  [Laughter]. 

A.236:  Yeah, I, well, the only time I can go in, too, and all these classes that
are available, are like Saturday.

B.237:  Oh, really.  

A.238:  Yeah, Saturday morning, which is, you know, I, I go to those when I can.

B.239:  Oh, they have them at night over here.  

A.240:  Yeah, well they have, uh, the, they have them like at six --

B.241:  Uh-huh.  

A.242:  -- you know, here, but I, 

B.243:  No, we have six and seven, 

A.244:  Yeah.  

B.245:  No.  Six and then one is at seven ten or something like that.  Uh-huh.

A.246:  Yeah.  

B.247:  [Lipsmack] But I like Jazzercize [laughter].  

A.248:  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  

B.249:  I like it better than aerobics.  

A.250:  Well, yeah, that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing, you know, you
don't really realize that you're working as hard as you are.

B.251:  Because you're having fun.  

A.252:  Yeah.  

B.253:  And, 

A.254:  It's sort of cute, too.  

B.255:  Yeah, I like Jazzercize [laughter].

A.256:  Yeah.  

B.257:  I'll tell anybody I'd go to Jazzercize before I'd go to aerobics
[laughter].

A.258:  Yeah, well, see I belong to the fitness center so I feel like I have to go
to the aerobics class to get my money's worth, you know [laughter].

B.259:  Yeah.  I used to belong and I, I, but I stopped that because I never used
it.

A.260:  Yeah.  

B.261:  You know, the, the fitness centers -- 

A.262:  Uh-huh.  

B.263:  -- so.  Oh, well, that's a waste of money.  

A.264:  Yeah, well, it's so neat because it's right there and I can go just right
after work.  And, you know, before I get home.  Because once I get home, that
tends to be it.

B.265:  Yeah.  I'm thinking about it.  My husband wants, he wants to go and sign up
for the weights.

A.266:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.267:  So, but, 

A.268:  Yeah, that's handy and they're just there, you know, when you want to use
them.

B.269:  Uh-huh.  And they're open till, I think, ten.  

A.270:  Uh-huh.  

B.271:  Yeah, so,

A.272:  Yeah.  And I -- 

B.273:  I don't know.  

A.274:  -- I did the family thing so my sweetie could go, too.  

B.275:  Uh-huh.  

A.276:  Do the weights.  

B.277:  Yeah.  

A.278:  He'll, he'll, he would never do an aerobics.  He'd die before he'd do
aerobics class.

B.279:  Oh, yeah.  

A.280:  [Laughter] But, he likes the weights and the, you know, stationary
bicycle --

B.281:  Uh-huh.  

A.282:  -- and all that.  

B.283:  Yep.  My husband likes the weights, period, that's it.  He wants to be up,
like, he wants to, he says I'm going to pump up.  I said uh-huh.

A.284:  [Laughter].  

B.285:  [Laughter].  

A.286:  Body build, huh.  

B.287:  Yeah.  Because I'm always looking at those guys.  I love them. 

A.288:  Uh-huh.  

B.289:  But I always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair.  Because
[laughter],

A.290:  I think they shave it.  

B.291:  Yeah.  They do.  

A.292:  Yeah, but, 

B.293:  I told him, I said, well, if you do it, you can't shave your hair.

A.294:  [Laughter].  

B.295:  [Laughter] I'm sorry, I can't handle it.  

A.296:  And then, then oil up I think.  

B.297:  Uh-huh.  They do and then I don't know how they get, because normally
they're not that pumped up and I ...
