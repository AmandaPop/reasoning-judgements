============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um.  How has it been this week for you?

B.2:  Weather-wise, or otherwise?

A.3:  Weather-wise.

B.4:  Weather-wise.  Damp, cold, warm [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter] Oh, no, damp.

B.6:  We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, uh,
in the last week.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.

A.9:  My goodness.  Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like
then.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  It was ninety-six yesterday,

B.12:  I heard about that.

A.13:  [Laughter] and we set a record yesterday.  And, uh, very windy, but then
today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, uh,
I think right now it's like sixty-nine,

B.14:  Um [music].

A.15:  and that's cool for u-, or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very
pleasant, no rain in the last month, I don't think.  The ground's very dry and
our yard work, everything is in bloom, so our yard work is pretty tough, the
ground being dry, but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies, we're
having a lot of allergies down here right now.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Everything blooming, and, and the weather.  

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,
so.  Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  and golfing, reasons and things like that.

B.22:  The blue flu,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  yeah, the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you
work, I guess.

A.25:  Yes.

B.26:  Oh, we have had, uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. Uh,

A.27:  Um.

B.28:  It has been untypically wet for this time of year,

A.29:  Um.

B.30:  and, also, we have a lot of green, you know, the grass has been growing
and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn,  

A.31:  Uh.

B.32:  if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those
lines, but fortunately it rains and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy
the spark plug,

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  you know.  But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring, and,
well I guess we're still in winter, and, uh,

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  we have had no snow.

A.37:  No snow?

B.38:  To speak of, to speak of.

A.39:  Um.

B.40:  We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the
winter and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches
total accumulation.

A.41:  Um.

B.42:  So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.

A.43:  Um.

B.44:  So, uh, in that regard, it's fine, but, uh, 

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  I envy you your ninety-four degrees.  

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the
nineties yesterday.

A.49:  Yes, yes it is.  Down in the more southern and western areas.  And, of
course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  and, and, uh, very windy.  It's amazing to me because I have only lived
in Dallas for three years, and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the
time.

B.52:  [Laughter].

A.53:  It does, I, I very seldom, if any, I can't remember, you know, a day that I
walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.

B.54:  Uh-huh  Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana.  In the
flatlands, and it was that way every day.

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an
hour.

A.57:  Um.

B.58:  Summer and winter, so, that, uh, you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  But, uh, otherwise w-, as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild
winter,

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  speaking for this area of the country.

@@A.63:  Oh, rea-, where did you go to school in Indiana?

B.64:  Purdue.

A.65:  Purdue.  I have a brother that lives in, uh, uh, South Bend, Indiana.

B.66:  Oh, yes.

A.67:  And, I had to always, I've lived there for eight years myself.  I'd
always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  But, I didn't. Uh.

B.70:  Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.

A.71:  No, originally I'm from New Mexico.

B.72:  Oh, okay.

A.73:  I was born in New Mexico and we lived in, uh, South Bend for eighty, eight
years, and, uh, then moved to, uh, Tennessee actually.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And, uh,

B.76:  Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.

A.77:  [Laughter] Very much, very much, cause I, I spent thirteen years there.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And, uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.  So,

B.80:  Gee, you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter] Yeah, uh, my father was in the Air Force, so,

B.82:  Oh, I see.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  Well, I worked for the government, so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently
than I had intended for sixteen years,

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh,
series.

A.87:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.88:  I, I received a call last night because of the, uh, I had not received my,
uh, personal identification number.

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I,
I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.

A.91:  Yeah [breathing].

B.92:  So, uh, is there any, I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.

A.93:  It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.

B.94:  Oh. O-,

A.95:  I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a
reasonable lengthy conversation.  Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments? 

B.96:  No, I do not.  I work for G T E.

A.97:  Oh, okay.

B.98:  And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from
Jack.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  I've known Jack for some time.  I'm in the speech processing business,

A.101:  Oh, okay.

B.102:  and have been for a number of years, so I was very much interested,

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  in, in being a speaker for this [laughter].

A.105:  Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments, and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an
environmental engineer,

B.106:  Oh, I see.

A.107:  and, uh, [static] they just published this internally, you know, getting
people involved.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  So, that, that's really strange.  I, I was wondering why we had somebody
from Maryland though.  I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland or,

B.110:  I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. 

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  If just nothing more than a business representative or government
services representative, and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in
other, uh, similar type of activities.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and
the program and so forth, so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in
being a speaker.

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  We haven't talked much about the weather [laughter].

A.117:  Oh, well.

B.118:  I know that's what we're supposed to do.

A.119:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, really it, [static] uh, the letter just says, um, let's
see, I can't, I was looking at it, I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,
and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead
and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed. So.

B.120:  Uh-huh.  In environmental engineering, uh,

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know,
environm-, the work place environment or,

A.123:  Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.

B.124:  Oh, I see.

A.125:  Taking, taking care of uh, I'm actually in the air division, and we
monitor, um, [static] anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a
building, or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the
work place and we take care of that, but (( )),

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  within our department.  We take care of everything.  Waste water, uh,
solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and [sigh],

B.128:  Well, I had my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about,
uh, concerning recycling [static],

A.129:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.130:  in the community.  The call I received, and so, I had, uh, I had
thought a little bit about it, um,

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  before hand.

A.133:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.134:  So, I, [laughter] but that, that's interesting.  I have a, uh, uh, friend
who is a planner.

A.135:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.136:  Uh, a city planner.  And, one of his, and he models, uh, city districts,
and so forth,

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  uh, does computer modeling.

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  And, one of the, uh, he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an
environmental engineer. (( )).

A.141:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we actually, our division is corporate wide, and we take
care of just the Dallas area.

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  Of course we have several plants here, but, um, we do air modeling also.

B.144:  Oh, I see.

A.145:  And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the
Dallas area.  What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this
information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and, uh, we
have a huge chemical data base.

B.146:  Well, that's interesting.

A.147:  And, uh, our, [static] our chemical data base, so that we know every
chemical on site and, and, um, it's concentration, and if, if anything ever
happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something tha-, we'd
be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.
