REMARKS:        Tape was distorted, sounded as if talking into a can.  

============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution?

B.2:  Well, I guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles.  Although I
suppose manufacturing contributes, uh, quite a bit to air pollution.

A.3:  Yeah, I, I, I think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders.  But
then there's, like you say, there's industry with all the, uh, sulfur and all
that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere causing acid rain and
everything else.

B.4:  Uh, yeah.  You know, I'm wondering, uh, of course, uh, Freon is, uh, is,
uh, eating away at our --

A.5:  Uh.  

B.6:  -- our, what you call it layer, there, 

A.7:  Ozone, yeah. 

B.8:  ozone layer. 

A.9:  ozone pollution, yeah. 

B.10:  I wonder when they're going to, what they'll be able to you in pr-, in
place of Freon, though?

A.11:  Well, I was, I was thinking about that, too.  I mean, uh, we don't have any
suitable replacement for Freon and, and you have to have it for refrigeration,
so.

B.12:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.13:  But, on the other hand, you know, I, I've, um, I took a boat cruise one
time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane.  I-, it
was actually powered by a flame.

B.14:  Uh, well, actually, you know, that is the way a refrigerator works.

A.15:  Yeah, uh, it, it, something with heat, I don't understand the mechanics of
it, but, uh,

B.16:  Well, basically, what happens is, you have to have some form of heat.

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  Be it electrical, as in your home refrigerator.  Or propane, as the one on
the ship that you said --

A.19:  Uh-huh.   

B.20:  -- uh, you had.  And, uh, somehow, cr-, heat must be created that Freon,
oh, I'm not exactly sure what happens, but apparently it expands in the heat.
And, in the process of expanding, it goes through cooler coils and whatnot,
and it becomes fr-, ice cold.

A.21:  Oh, okay.  So it still had Freon in it. 

B.22:  Oh, yes.  Yes, 

A.23:  Oh, okay.  I well, uh,

B.24:  Freon's, uh, Freon is in a closed circuit. 

A.25:  Yeah.      

B.26:  Uh,  

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  that's why our present day refrigerants, uh, systems are not dangerous
unless the lines are broken.

A.29:  Right.  Which happens all the time when they go to service the things.

B.30:  Well, did you ever see what happens when they, uh, replace the, or
replenish the Freon in your automobile air conditioner?

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  I mean, there's, uh, a lot of it, 

A.33:  Yeah.  Escape. 

B.34:  is, uh, turned out into the atmosphere. 

A.35:  sure.  Yeah, yeah, I,   

B.36:  And I understand now, uh, I don't know if it's international or just here
in Texas, or what, but, uh, service stations are going to require to have a
special device to catch this Freon as it is ex-, expelled, the excess Freon.
And therefore, you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to, or you wouldn't
even be able to do it yourself at home.

A.37:  Well, that makes sense.  I, I'm more worried about the ozone than I am
anything else.  I, I think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and all
that kind of stuff.  Uh, cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain
problem.  But the ozone, I mean, you know, we can't replace that.

B.38:  No, that's true.  

A.39:  We, we can't clean it up. 

B.40:  You know, I can remember as a child,  

A.41:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.42:  uh, spending summers at my grandfather's place, and I'd be running around
with nothing but a bathing suit, no shoes, socks, shirts, or anything.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  Uh, I mean, from dawn till dusk. 

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  And I developed a nice tan.  But, uh, my gosh, never had to worry about,
uh, skin cancer.

A.47:  Burning and everything else.  

B.48:  Or for that matter, you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably
clear and, and get a drink of water without worrying, uh --

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  -- about catching some disease.  

A.51:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  When I was a kid I used to do the same thing.
It's, uh, I, I don't kn-, I don't know what the rain forests have to do with
it, but, you know, they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate every day.
And I just have a feeling, that, you know, that's our, that's our air
scrubbing stuff there, and they're, [laughter] they're taking away the sponge.

B.52:  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  

A.53:  I don't know, this, uh, ozone, 

B.54:  I tell you, a funny thing happened to me with, with polluted water.  Uh, T
I sent me up on a trip to Wyoming, I think it was.  And I was out in this
little town, kind of backwoods town, you know, wh-, where a big night on the
town is going down watching the traffic light change.

A.55:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

B.56:  But, uh, I checked into a motel, and after I signed in and everything, why,
the, uh, clerk told me, uh, don't drink the water.  It's contaminated,

A.57:  [Laughter]. 

B.58:  He said, now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests, but,
unfortunately we're out of it right now.  But, as,

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  as soon as we get it, I, I'll see that you get a bottle of it.

A.61:  [Laughter].  

B.62:  Well, the next morning I got up and the water had not been delivered yet.
And would you believe it?  I brushed my teeth with Coca-Cola.

A.63:  Oh, I can believe it. 

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  You, you probably did less harm than what the water would have done though
[laughter].

B.66:  Oh, well, th-, they had this, uh, it's some kind of a bacteria cal-, or
carried by animals.

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  And it, they got their water from this, uh, beautiful mountain river.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  Well, maybe not quite a river, but a little bigger than a stream.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  But this, uh, bacteria had, uh, penetrated their entire pipe system, or
water system.

A.73:  Gosh.  

B.74:  And they tried flushing it out.  They, they couldn't get rid of it.

A.75:  Gaw.  That's,

B.76:  I've often wondered, now this is years ago, and I've often wondered what
they ever did.  Of course, oh, it was a beautiful mountain stream.  Bubbling
nicely, you know, the, which, uh, is what purifies the water when,

A.77:  Yeah, right.  The, 

B.78:  it bubbles.  

A.79:  the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff [throat_clearing].

B.80:  Yes.  And yet even at that it was still contaminated.  

A.81: Gee.  Well, that's scary.  I, it, it worries me to turn on the, turn on the
taps now because you never know what's going to come out, you know [laughter].

B.82:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Yes. 

A.83:  And I, and I, and I don't really trust these, these government agencies
that test this stuff.  I really don't.

B.84:  Well, I'm beginning to wonder, too.  I mean, you, you're always hearing
stories about, well, the government okayed this.  And then all of a sudden you
turn around and, my gosh, it's okay to, to doing it this way, but if you turn
around and do it that way it's dangerous.

A.85:  Yeah, well, it's, it's like so many, it's like chicken.  You know, they go
in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken.  I don't know if you ever
saw that SIXTY MINUTES thing where they showed a chicken processing plant.

B.86:  As a matter of fact I did.  

A.87:  Yeah.  I, I haven't touched chicken since.  

B.88:  Neither have I [laughter]. 

A.89:  Yeah, I, I, couldn't, I couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after
seeing that.  And, but the government says it's safe.  Uh-huh.

B.90:  Uh, yeah.  

A.91:  Right.  That's about what they say about the, the air pollution in this
country.  [sniffing] And they s-, yeah, it's getting better, it's getting
better.  And then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles,
it's st-, still so thick you have to cut it with a knife.  I don't know.

B.92:  I've often wondered about, uh, L A.  Now that's suppose to be about the
worst c-, c-, c-, {stutters} city in the country, I guess, for,

A.93:  Just about.  Yeah.  

B.94:  air pollution.  

A.95:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  You know, used to be a lot of states had, uh, uh,
you had to have your car checked for pollution every year, you had to have
that little sticker in the window.  I know Texas does.

B.96:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  And there are about three places in Georgia that does.  And I think
Louisiana does, I'm not sure.  But I, there's not very many of them around any
more.

B.98:  Well, uh, they used to do it down in Florida.  Now, I lived down there for
ten years.

A.99:  Yeah, they don't do it any more.  

B.100:  No, they did away with it, 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  because they found out that, uh, the people that were doing it, it was
just a racket to them.

A.103:  Uh-huh.  [inhaling] I think that's the problem with most of it.  The
politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about
having to pay that fee.

B.104:  And for, uh, for nothing.  (( ))  T-, t-, to,  

A.105:  And, yeah.  And, and I mean, all it was was a revenue generator.

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  It, it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve.  I mean,
you look at the cars driving down the road, and you look at these things
belching huge, blue clouds of oil smoke.  And you tell me that guy passed a
pollution test, y-, [laughter].

B.108:  Uh-huh.  Well, now, here's another thing.  Diesels, uh, diesel engines are,

A.109:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.110:  are the worst.    

A.111:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, those are,  

B.112:  And yet, they haven't done a thing to them.  

A.113:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, w-, was back in the, uh, late seventies when
diesel engines were the thing because it was, uh, so much cheaper than gas.
Now you look.  Diesel's what?  One forty, one fifty a gallon, while gas is,
you know, one oh five.

B.114:  [Static] Uh-huh.  Yeah.  T-, t-, tell me about it.  I just got rid of, uh,
a diesel engine Escort.

A.115:  I never did like diesels anyway.  They, they were too cantankerous.  Cold
w-,

B.116:  Well, they, um, I, I had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up
on me [/static],

A.117:  Um. 

B.118:  here a few weeks ago.  

A.119:  Yeah.  A friend of mine had a, uh, had a Buick, had, had a diesel in it and
he had nothing but trouble with the thing.

B.120:  Is that right?  

A.121:  Yeah.  Winter, 

B.122:  Well, 

A.123:  time the, the diesel would jell and it wouldn't, I don't know, liquefy
right.  And then his injector things got clogged, and, oh, go-,

B.124:  Uh-huh.  Well, now there was at one time, as a matter of fact it may have
been Buick, I think, because I think it was G M that came out with a dis-, or
diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  And, uh, they used the same pistons and, and cylinders and whatnot.  But
all they did was change the, uh, uh, the induction ports, and, uh, et cetera,
et cetera, whatever needed to be changed over.  And, although they were, it
seemed practical at the time, they were nothing but a headache.

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  And they did w-, w-, finally did away with them, 

A.129:  That, that may, tha-,

B.130:  and went to a straight diesel.  

A.131:  yeah.  That may have been what he had.  Um, but speaking of cars,
[throat_clearing] what more can we do to cars to make them less
polluting?

B.132:  Well, now, of course in California, they, they have much stricter codes
than we have elsewhere.

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  Now, could be, that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in
California.  I don't know what it is, precisely, but, uh, they're doing, they
do something a little more stricter than we do.

A.135:  I'm just wondering about the feasibility of the electric cars.  I saw an
article in the paper ...
