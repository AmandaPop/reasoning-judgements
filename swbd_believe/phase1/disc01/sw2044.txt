=============================================================================
 
A.1:  I guess we're, uh, uh, we're, we're experiencing, uh, what to me I guess is
a surprisingly mild, uh, winter.  Uh, we've had a lot more warm weather than
usual and we haven't had any ice storms.  Uh, usually we have at least one,
um, of course, I've only lived here three years, but, uh, but that, still in
that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm.

B.2:  My husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm.  He said that he pulled
up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped, just slid to the side of
the curb, that they're that bad.

A.3:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

B.4:  Lubbock, we get ice storms but not, not quite to that extent.  It's not
the thin sheet, you know,

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  all across the road.  Ours if it ices over, it's thick, it's with snow,
it's something that you can drive on, you can get a little traction with.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  Uh, I think we've been fortunate that we've missed any of the real bad
weather this year because we went to California instead [laughter].

A.9:  Oh [laughter].

B.10:  But right now, uh, we're having unusually warm weather.  It's, it's
almost like they're try, it's trying to skip Spring and go straight to Summer.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  It's either, uh, thirty degrees, you know, one day and ninety the next
and, and we're, we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere.  

A.13:  Right that's right, it's, it's the same way here.  How long have you lived
in Lubbock?

B.14:  Well, I have been here, permanently or full time since nineteen eighty.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And, uh, pretty much off and on since seventy-four.  So really quite a
while.

A.17:  Wow, yeah.

B.18:  And I've watched the weather shift.  You know, I can remember being here
back in the seventies in college and the Spring dust storms were, uh, they
were massive.  I mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see
buildings across the street.

A.19:  Dust storms.

B.20:  That dust, yeah, [laughter] not fun to be in. 

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  But I haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  So it's, it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are
cold but I guess I can live with it [laughter].

A.25:  Well I know when we first moved here it was, uh, it was at the very
beginning of the year in nineteen eighty-seven and, 

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  uh, we, when we lef-, we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing,

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  [Throat_clearing] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm
it was.  I mean, it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats
and we were all dressed like eskimos and, uh, and then soon after, we had this
big ice storm, uh, where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice
and everybody, and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this
weather.

B.30:  That's true.

A.31:   And, uh, we were feeling very cocky because, of course, we always, in
New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather. 

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  But, um, uh, and I just, I just assumed that was the way it was.  You
know, didn't get snow, which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it
and, but you alwa-, you could expect to have this ice storm and I think there
was, in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm.  Uh,
in the second year we had an ice storm and I was really surprised that, uh,
that we didn't have anything like that this year.

B.34:  Well, now does Dallas get snow, 

A.35:  [Throat_clearing].

B.36:  or is it usually just the ice storm?

A.37:  It, it, uh, it, if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown
grass, you know.

B.38:  Okay.

A.39:  And, uh, certainly nothing that you have to do anything about, um,

B.40:  Well that was one reason why I figured that I could stand Lubbock, Texas.

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  That was about as much winter as I could get because I grew up, West
Coast sunshine, green leaves on trees,

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  came back here and could not realize why I had been so depressed through
the winter, 

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  and realized that that was the first time in my life I had seen trees
lose their leaves.

A.47:  Oh.

B.48:  And, uh, and of course when Spring and everything came out again, uh, it
was beautiful but that's about as much winter as I can take.  I mean, it gets
cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets, you know, fifteen, twenty
degrees below because of the wind.

A.49:  Right, yeah.

B.50:  But it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months
out of the year and,

A.51:  Right,

B.52:  I know the sun is coming.

A.53:  [Laughter] Well that's the thing with us too, it's, uh, we just, you know,
in up in New England you had more winter than you had a, su-, summer.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And, uh, you could expect a long winter period.  Uh, for instance, um, we
co-, you co-, in New England it would still be cold, I mean ice cold snow kind
of weather, uh, now, in March.  It's ju-, in March is, is just when things
start, uh, approaching the fifty degree mark.  And, of course, we've already
had eighty degree weather here, 

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  and day, day before yesterday, it got up to eighty-eight I think.

B.58:  Well now when did winter start there?  You said you had more winter than
summer.

A.59:  Oh winter would start, oh yeah, winter would start, uh, in September.  It
would start getting cold in September.

B.60:  Now was there actually snow on the ground all tha-, that time from
September through what, March?

A.61:  There could be, yeah, 

B.62:  Oh goodness.

A.63:  there could be and, and it came, I mean, I used to, I used to work in
Boston which was and hour and a half away. 

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And I would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out the
driveway,

B.66:  Oh!

A.67:  And that's so I could leave by seven. 

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  And, uh, so it would sometimes take me, you know, an hour or two to
shovel the driveway in the morning.  Then I'd sitting in that car for an hour
an a half, an, an, well it was actually, if the, if the weather was bad enough
to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work.

B.70:  Oh, my goodness.

A.71:  And so now it takes me ten minutes [laughter].

B.72:  Well now was that expected though, 

A.73:  Oh yeah.

B.74:  I mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due
to the delays or,  

A.75:  Uh, well, then not, they didn't expect you to be on time, but they did
expect you to be there and you, the schools.  

B.76:  Uh, yeah.

A.77:  Well you know they also did a very good job of, of shoveling the, the
streets.  They had the snow plows and the salt trucks and, and, uh, they just,
you know, they were equipped for it.  Where as, here, if you have a bad snow
nobody is prepared to do anything about it, you know.

B.78:  Everything stops, yeah.

A.79:  Right, right, you know, you'd, you'd, you get the first, you know, the
first ice, uh, storm and the place closes up.

B.80:  Well now do you work at T I.

A.81:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.82:  I was going to say there have been several times when I know they had ice
storms down in Dallas, uh, that we would be up here trying to call,

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  and it, we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody
at work [laughter].

A.85:  There's nobody there.  Yeah, yeah, I, that happens a lot.  I, I just live
ten minutes away and I don't, I don't work in the, at the Dallas site, I work
at the Spring Creek site which is, which is in Plano.

B.86:  Oh, okay [breathing].

A.87:  And, uh, and so I usually, I can usually make it in, it's just a hop,
jump, and, uh, uh, whatever the expression is, I'm, I'm real close [laughter].

B.88:  [Laughter] Hop, skip and a jump.

A.89:  #Yeah right [laughter].#

B.90:  #There you go.#

A.91:  [Laughter] Um, but, uh, yeah, 

B.92:  Well that's good.

A.93:  I'd, I'd hate to have to get it, go to Dal-, drive into Dallas when the
weather's like that.

B.94:   Well are you, uh, do you prefer the kind of weather that
you're getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the
winters.

A.95:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Well it's like I keep telling people, you don't have to
shovel sunshine, you know,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  it's, uh, it's, uh, this is great, I mean, we're really spoiled.  I mean
there's a lot of things we miss about New England, you know.  Uh, uh, where,
there's no trees to speak of, you know, and the big, you know, thick trees we
used to have in New England and we used to enjoy that.  We had, uh, we had two
acres of land attached to our house.

B.98:  Oh my goodness.

A.99:  Of course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres
of land, and, um, and so we, that, now we have this, we have a house that's
three times as big, but we have less than a quarter acre lot, you know, and
uh, and, uh.

B.100:  Sure, once you're out of the house, you're in the street.

A.101:  That's right, and, uh, so we kind of, it, it's, we've gone from one
extreme to the other and that's, that's been hard to adjust to.  But, uh, the
weather, oh the weather's been wonderful.

B.102:  That's good, I did go up to New England one time during their fall season,
when the weather was just, 

A.103:  Oh, yeah.

B.104:  you know, it was kind of, uh, a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't
freezing, the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there I
could truly love, but, uh.

A.105:  Yeah, oh, I can remember, uh, walking around, you know, taking a lunch
break, you know, when the air's real brisk and the, the colors on the trees
are just so vivid, um, uh, it's just, that, that's something I miss.  I, I
keep, I'm [laughter], I get homesick thinking about it.

B.106:  Uh, oh.  Well what about your summers in Dallas.  Now is that similar,
was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there?

A.107:  Oh, yeah humid, very humid in New England, I mean you got hundred degree
weather, I mean in, in, like in the Boston area. 

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  I, Boston's right on the water and, uh, you'd have these hundred degree
days where the humidity was just on-, hundred percent and it was stifling.
Uh, here in, in Dallas, in the Dallas area, the humidity, you get some humid
days but it's not nearly as bad.  You ge-, you get a lot of dry days too.

B.110:  Well so that's no big ta-, I tell you what, that's funny to hear you talk
about that because for me to come to Dallas, in the summer it's stifling
humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry.

A.111:  Is it, okay.

B.112:  Uh, you know it may be a hundred and a hundred an five or whatever, up
here, 

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  but there is no humidity and its, you know, if there's a breeze blowing
it's nice comfortable day,

A.115:  Oh, yeah.  

B.116:  and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you,
you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity is so great, you know,
you're sweating to death again.

A.117:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, everything is relative, I guess.

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  I grew up on the east coast.

B.120:  Oh,

A.121:  And, uh, I'm originally from Virginia and, and my memories of summer
have always been that stifling humidity.

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  And compared to the humidity here, you know, in fact, uh, whenever I think
about moving, you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east
coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling
summers which, which I don't experience here.
