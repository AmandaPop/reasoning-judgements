===========================================================================

A.1:  All right.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  Uh, we got a lot of them, 

B.4:  Oh, yes [laughter]. 

A.5:  too many of them.

B.6:  and I believe we all do, and it's, it's just too easy to use.

A.7:  Yeah, well my husband is real good at using them.

B.8:  [Laughter] Oh, I believe that, uh, mine would say the same, uh, but, uh,
I seem too rely on them too much.

A.9:  I don't have any of them, I don't carry them.  He carries them.  I try to
take them away from him.

B.10:  [Laughter] Um, it, uh, you know, I seem to, uh, use those more than I do
cash, in fact, I'd rather carry the cards than I would the, uh, cash.

A.11:  Well, we got in, uh, spot of trouble with, uh, using the credit cards on
gas.

B.12:  Uh, yes.

A.13:  And, uh, that's got us in trouble.

B.14:  Yes, that's real easy to do, I have to watch it.  

A.15:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.16:  In fact, yeah, uh, [laughter] we, I can understand that predicament.  Um,
they, they've, um, you know, they've made them too easy and too accessible at
everything to, to buy,

A.17:  The A T M machines,

B.18:  Oh, yes.

A.19:  Those things there, that's what gets us.

B.20:  And then plus, then you for, end up forgetting to write it down.

A.21:  Well no, he doesn't have that trouble.  He, uh, has this little slip that
comes out with the, uh, A T M machine, 

B.22:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.23:  and he just keeps that.  He keeps fairly decent records.

B.24:  Oh that's good.

A.25:  But, uh, he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows
that anytime he pop up that credit card [laughter],

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  You know, uh, used the credit card a couple times to pay bills.

B.28:  Oh, yes, yes, uh, and then, then, then, that gets into a vicious circle.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  As far as, you know, paying off the, the loan that you just got from the
credit card to pay off the other loan.

A.31:  Yeah, that's what he's talking about doing now.

B.32:  Oh, no.  Um, yeah the A T M's they're, but, they're nice though to have, in
case you need to get some quick cash, and everything is closed.

A.33:  Yeah, well, yeah, I like them. I, I have to admit I do like my credit
cards.  Uh, I love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for
me.

B.34:  Oh that's the best way ((it's used)), [laughter] that's the best way, yes.
I think that sort of evens it out as far as, uh, letting them carry it, so, as
long as they do buy us something [laughter].

A.35:  Yeah, I don't know, I like it, he walks in, you know, and he's got this
little gift and how did you pay for it, credit.  You know, whipped out my
little card.

B.36:  And see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we
know how much they pay for it.

A.37:  Yeah, I've never thought about it that way.  I don't really look
[laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  I guess I ought to sometime.

B.40:  Oh, I have to open it, you know, they, mine always charges the flowers so I
can always end up saying, oh, you spent too much, you know, and so, yeah.

A.41:  I think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo.

B.42:  Oh, those are fun.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You get started on them and can't quit.

A.45:  Like credit cards.

B.46:  [Laughter] Just exactly.

A.47:  Oh, no, I never thought of it that way either.  He's, you know, he's
addicted to it at times.

B.48:  Oh, it's, it's real easy to get addicted to them, you know, you get out on
a shopping frenzy and, uh, just charge it all and then you don't have to write
a check or anything.  

A.49:  And see, the thing is, you know, he go out and he'll spend it when he
wants, you know, and, uh, uh, I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to use that credit
card.

B.50:  Yeah, there is a, a fear to it as far as what happens if.

A.51:  Yeah, you know, uh, is he going to yell at me for buying this with this,
you know.  He's not a yeller though, but he com-, you know, you shouldn't have
spent it all on that.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  He likes to buy the kids toys [throat_clearing] with the, uh, credit card
too. 

B.54:  Oh yeah that's (( )).

A.55:  You know, he'll go to, by Wal-Mart or something and,

B.56:  Oh yeah, there's that's a weakness there.  That's just, you know, you, you
always want to get your kids everything and, uh, you don't care how much it
costs or what it takes.

A.57:  Yeah, well, uh, I don't know, the, uh, uh, the, uh, Wal-Mart, that's where
all of our bills are for the credit card.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  Yeah that's, uh, I always end up going into Wal-Mart and coming
out with everything that, uh, I didn't have on the list.  We're just getting
more than what we went in for [laughter].

A.59:  We went in for, uh, uh, something for the car one day,

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  last week and he went, we went and bought a potty chair, uh, uh, one of
those Ninja Turtles for my son, uh, you know, the potty chair for my daughter
and he bought, uh, a pair of shoes for me, and, uh, let's see, what else did
he, he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids, you know, I got two kids
and he bought them shoes with it, and, uh.

B.62:  Oh, yeah, it's dangerous.

A.63:  You know, we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended
up sixty, seventy dollars for, uh, at Wal-Mart and then we went to Payless and
bought the shoes for the kids [laughter].

B.64:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, it's just too easy to do.  You go in for just one thing.
We're, we're infamous about that and so.

A.65:  Yeah, I'll second that.

B.66:  [Laughter] Oh well, yeah, I, well I'm, I'm glad we have credit cards,
that's, uh, because in sometimes when there's an emergency it, it comes in
handy.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  It's nice to have.

A.69:  I know we had the car break down one time and, uh, the credit card saved
us.

B.70:  Yeah, we've, yeah, we've had, uh, a sick animal and, uh, the vet, you
know, the dog, and vet's are so expensive that, uh, we, uh, the credit card
helped us a lot there too, so we wouldn't do without them.

A.71:  I don't think we'd live.

B.72:  Huh-uh, no, no, I think it's become too much of an everyday life here.
They're a part of it.

A.73:  Yeah, well I've been asking my husband for the credit cards.  I've got all
of them but one.

B.74:  [Laughter].

A.75:  I just hide them from him and when I feel that it's necessary to pull it
out, I'll pull it out, but he keeps one of them.  He keeps the one with the
least amount of the, uh, uh, what you call it.

B.76:  The balance?

A.77:  Yeah, uh, no, the, uh, credit line,

B.78:  Oh yes, uh-huh.

A.79:  you know, uh, the credit limit.  I let him have the one with the least
amount.

B.80:  So you know he can't spend too much.

A.81:  Yeah, you know, uh, I don't really exactly remember how much it is.  I
think it's about five hundred limit.  Uh, you know, it's just uh, just one for
him to fiddle with.

B.82:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.83:  I have to think of something else, I'm,

B.84:  I was, I was, just, uh,

A.85:  I'm blank.

B.86:  Oh, well, let's see I guess, we've talked, what, almost five minutes.

A.87:  Well six minutes, I've got a timer on my, uh, clock, on my phone.

B.88:  Oh, I wish I had one of those.

A.89:  Oh, we bought this with credit too [laughter].

B.90:  Oh, did you [laughter].  See there you go.

A.91:  Well we found it with a clearance, uh, down in Memphis, I guess and, uh,
popped that credit card out.   It was a Sears [laughter].

B.92:  Oh, your up in Memphis.

A.93:  No, I used to be, I'm in Texas.

B.94:  Oh, your in Texas, oh, okay, I was going to go goodness they really got,
uh, this out far. 

A.95:  Well I, I don't know, I don't know how far it goes.  Are you in Texas?

B.96:  Yeah, yeah I'm down in Houston.

A.97:  Oh, I'm in, uh, down here in Sherman,

B.98:  Oh, okay.

A.99:  or, Denison, rather.

B.100:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, oh, this has been just great, this was the first
one I had.

A.101:  First phone call.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  This is my first one too.

B.104:  My husband did one last night and he just loved it.  He's been getting, he
got a real good topic and so, well, uh.

A.105:  You know, we got to get back to credit cards.

B.106:  Yeah, I was just trying to think, uh, I think we've pretty much said it
all.  Yeah.  So, uh, but yeah, uh-huh, I think we couldn't make it without
them.

A.107:  I know I couldn't, uh, we went and we, maxed out quite a few of them
before, uh, I started taking the, uh, cards away, we maxed out a lot of, well
we had about six or seven and we maxed them out and, uh,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  that's got us in a little bit of trouble now.  That's why we, and we was
using one of them to pay off the bills on the others.  And that got that in
trouble there.

B.110:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, we, uh, we try to keep, uh, uh, tight controls ove-,
over them but it, it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and
birthdays.

A.111:  Uh, uh, my hubby does not have, uh, too much control when it comes to
using that card, uh, I know, uh, uh, for quite a while we was using them to,
uh, you know, I think even one time we used it to pay our rent.

B.112:  [Laughter] Oh goodness.

A.113:  You know it, uh, when we first moved here, we just had a little bit of
trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house, or apartment rather and,

B.114:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.115:  uh, you know, he was only down here for one day and we just, everything
just piled up, wrecked the car and,

B.116:  Oh.

A.117:  you know, in order to do that, we had to, you know, we was paying the
rent plu-, try-, plus trying to get the money for a ca-, another car and,

B.118:  It gets rough.

A.119:  it got, it got real rough.

B.120:  That's hard.

A.121:  He just popped out that, uh, MasterCard and,

B.122:  Get that cash advance, uh-huh [laughter].

A.123:  Yeah, we got big cash advance and really, that's what's, uh, holding us
back now that's, 

B.124:  Yeah, it, uh, it but see it does come in handy, those, they do, they're
worth it, so.  Well, I, I think we've pretty much come to an end here.

@@A.125:  I'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk.

B.126:  I think it was at least five minutes wasn't it.

A.127:  That's what I'm looking for now, that's why I was just trying to talk
without having to think about what I was saying and, 

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  uh, trying to look over this thing.
