===========================================================================

A.1:  Hi.

B.2:  Hi, um, okay what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of
music do you like?

A.3:  Well, I mostly listen to popular music.  I, uh, listen to it all the time
in, in my car, so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a
lot because I don't like commercials.  But,

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  uh, I find myself listening to popular music, and, uh, quite honestly, I,
I have some little children and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a
lot of nursery rhyme music here lately, but that's not by my choice.

B.6:  Oh, really.

A.7:  How about you?

B.8:  Well, um, [laughter] I don't have that, I don't have that {both are
laughing}, experience to share [laughter].

A.9:  Lucky you.

B.10:  I, I do, I do listen to a lot of, you know, I do, I switch the stations a
lot because I don't have a cassette player in my car.

A.11:  Um, um. Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, uh, however, I, I do, I do like a lot of different forms of music so I
switch quite often.  Um, I think I like, I, I'm really particular about the
type of music that I listen to.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  But, the, uh, there's such a wide selection, I think I like a lot, I like a
little bit of a lot of different types of music.  You know, I, I, I like music
that is, that I feel if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if
the version is done right, I like it [laughter],

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  but, if, if it's not, then I won't.  I, I really don't,

A.17:  How do you feel about rap music?

B.18:  Rap.

A.19:  It seems to be so popular these days.

B.20:  Yeah.  Well, I, I don't really have anything against rap music.  I, the one
thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant,

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  or, if it's, uh, violence oriented.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  I, I have strong objections to that.  Um, actually I listen to, one time I
remember, this was back when, even, uh, I would say about ten or fifteen years
ago I, 

A.25:  When it was really just starting.

B.26:  Yeah, right when it was just starting, 

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  I heard what was called talking blues,

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  which actually is rap.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And, uh, it was about, the, the piece of music, the piece of music was
about, I think about forty or fifty years old.  And, it was incredible, I
mean, the parallel, you know, between it and rap.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  And, um, you, you listen a lot, if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel,
uh, uh, especially well, the black gospel.  You know, you will, you know, you
can really pick it up.  I mean,

A.35:  Yeah, you really.  It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.
A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, they're not original,

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm.  And, uh, sounds, it sounds
so much different and yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a
lot of rap music and, uh, she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of
the words to songs that she's listening to, and yet,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  she thought they were brand new,

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  original pieces.

B.42:  they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, you
know, like standards, I guess you could call it.

A.43:  That's right.

B.44:  [Laughter] I think it's kind of absurd, you know, the fact that, you know,
they don't really, they don't really give, you know, the original artist, or
the original composer,

A.45:  No.

B.46:  the credit that is really due to them.

A.47:  Yeah, I guess there was even a, a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer,
who's really, you know,

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  seems to be the hot one of, of today.  He used, um, WILD THING.  Do you
remember that, that song.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  he used, um, I can't remember who the artist was on that.

B.52:  Jimi Hendrix was the original. 

A.53:  Who?

B.54:  Jimi Hendrix was the original.  He wrote [noise],

A.55:  Was it, well, ma-, maybe it wasn't that one. Because, it was a living, it
was a living person that I'm, I'm thinking of that,

B.56:  Okay.

A.57:  um, that said, "You know, hey that, those are my words."  And, uh, I
guess that they, because they hadn't originally gotten, um, permission,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  from him to use it.  And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and
paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on but, 

B.60:  Yeah.  I don't know it may have, it may have been somebody else, because I
think, I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it, I think that was a cov-, you
know, come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, like a John
Lee Hooker song, or something,

A.61:  Maybe so.  I,

B.62:  I mean it was just like, it was really old. 

A.63:  I, can't think.

B.64:  I mean I, I, there are a lot, there are so many different songs, I mean
like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times.  I mean I've heard
some songs that, that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of, I'm
like, you know, I, I don't want to listen to this.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  [Laughter] Because you know, you think of the original is like, you know,
oh, that was really great.  That was a, you know, a really good piece of work,
and then when you hear the cover it's like, you know, God, what are they
doing.

A.67:  Right. They destroyed it.

B.68:  [Laughter] I, I think a good one was, um, there was a Peter Frampton song,

A.69:  Oh, yeah!

B.70:  and, then the cover version, I think, I mean, I thought, was absolutely,
it was pitiful.

A.71:  I, I remember seeing the video of it on M T V, and I thought it was
hideous.

B.72:  Yeah.  I did too.

A.73:  It was, ugh, I didn't like that either.

B.74:  Yeah, but you know, whatever became of Peter Frampton.  I mean, there was
nothing, he was a phenomenon, I me-, there was no reason for him to really
come into, you know, great stardom or anything.

A.75:  I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was,

B.76:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I think it,

A.77:  I think it was in high school.

B.78:  Yeah, I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a
good stage performer.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  He was very good.  I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh,
Philadelphia.  It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.

B.80:  Oh man.

A.81:  Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.

B.82:  Yeah.  I've, I graduated back in seventy-nine, so,

A.83:  Um, um. Uh-huh.

B.84:  but, but I've really, I, I loved, I mean, I was, I was really into the
album oriented music, even then,

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  so I was really familiar with a lot, with a lot of, of the A O R type
music.  Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor,

A.87:  Oh, yeah.

B.88:  and, the, uh, the Beatles, and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go,
they're better than the Beatles, and I'm like, you know,

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  you don't know what you're talking about.

A.91:  No [laughter].

B.92:  I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles
[laughter].  It was just,

A.93:  You can only laugh [laughter].

B.94:  Yeah, you just sort of, you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you
know [laughter].  At this point.

A.95:  Right [laughter] well, they, I guess our age is showing when, we, we think
that.

B.96:  Yeah, but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.  I
think, um,

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  um, when I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave,
when it, when it came out, uh,

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  back in the mid and early eighties.  And then, um, I don't know music is
kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.  I think that, I
mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world
music.  Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music and, 

A.101:  Like Paul Simon.  Like,

B.102:  Yeah, yeah, Paul Simon.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  Well, you know, really that's not world music.  But, what, what Paul
Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I
think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  drawing from a lot of different sources and making, you know, a synthesis
of a new type of music.  Um,

A.107:  What do you mean by world music?

B.108:  Well, world music is, um, a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they
make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of
listener.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of
music and, with a certain style, and then you try to make it a little bit more
listenable for, let's say another audience, let's say a North American.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music,
and,

A.113:  Um.

B.114:  you know, sort of, um, trying to draw out the best sources.  The, the
best of every type of music.

A.115:  Right.

B.116:  Because, I mean, there are some, I mean, I, I li-, there are some, you
know, types of heavy metal that I really like, but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't
say that I, I completely like heavy metal.

A.117:  No.

B.118:  I, I think, you know, and it's the same way with, you know, world music
takes the forms that have really been, um, I guess, I you know, the best
example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say, and then,
and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that
are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,

A.119:  So then it becomes a kind of music of, of it's own, so to speak, or, uh,

B.120:  Yeah, yeah, it becomes a kind of music of it's own.  I mean, when you
listen to it, it's um, uh, I think that they don't use, elec-, some of it,
it's, they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa
now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not
particularly using certain types of folk styles.

A.123:  Right.

B.124:  But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.  I, I, I, a
good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis, and Miles Davis worked
with Robbie Shoncar,

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  if you can believe it, I mean,

A.127:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.128:  [Static] [laughter] You know, he's a jazz performer, and then he's playing
with Robbie Shoncar, who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.  Uh,
arrangement to, uh, we're going to have to get off.

A.129:  The, are they trying to (( )),

B.130:  I don't know. But, uh,

A.131:  (( )) We've talked our five minutes though.

B.132:  Yeah, okay, but, I mean, when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just
incredible.

A.133:  I've been listening to that a lot lately.

B.134:  Yeah, I, I listened and, I heard, you know, you hear this guitar, and then
you hear the muted trumpet.  I me, and you never would think that they, that
they can actually play together but,

A.135:  Oh yeah.
