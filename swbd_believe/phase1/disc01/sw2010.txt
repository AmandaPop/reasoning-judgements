A.1:  This is Archie.

B.2:  Hi, Archie.  I'm Sharon.

A.3:  Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?

B.4:  Yeah.  I've seen that, that's, uh, that was a really good movie.  Probably
one of the best things about it was the scenery and, uh, I thought the story
was pretty good, too.  I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it.

A.5:  Have you ever lived in that part of the country?

B.6:  No.  I haven't.

A.7:  Have you ever visited it?

B.8:  Um, I've visited the Wyoming area.  I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH
WOLVES was filmed.

A.9:  I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.

B.10:  Could be.  I, n-, I haven't been to South Dakota.  Have, have you been up
to that?

A.11:  Well, I lived in Omaha for five,

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  winters,

B.14:  Okay.

A.15:  and that rolling kind of, uh,

B.16:  Terrain.

A.17:  Yeah.  Is, is ((fairly famili-,)).  The thing that I thought was
interesting was that the critics, apparently it's going to win everything.

B.18:  Really?

A.19:  Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three
hours long, and all this,

B.20:  That's true.

A.21:  kind of,

B.22:  I agree with that.  Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something
said that it, I think it's been nominated for twelve awards and, and all the
critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was
just going to be a dud.  So, it, it has surprised everybody.

A.23:  Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that, and I, I, I tend to, I
think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great.  And,
and --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- it was, the thing is, it was, it was a good story.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  And, and, and I guess that's what I really like.  Although, I must admit I
did look at my watch after about an hour.

B.28:  Did you?

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?

A.31:  No.  I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though.

B.32:  Y-, you have to go see that one.  And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB?

A.33:  No,

B.34:  Go.

A.35:  You must really keep up.

B.36:  I do.  I go every weekend [laughter].  I, I, uh, those are two definite
must see movies, I think.

A.37:  Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a, i-, is it, is it
a terror movie or is it just suspenseful?

B.38:  It's suspenseful.  I don't think it's very t-, I mean, there's not really
any, uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that.  It's, it's more
suspense.  Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory
movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff.  It's, it's pretty
graphic at points.  But, uh, I think they're both excellent movies.

A.39:  Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill?

B.40:  No.  Huh-uh.

A.41:  Is, uh, do you know who he is?

B.42:  Yeah.  Somebody in South Carolina told me about him.

A.43:  He's a, the movie critic.  Um, oh, you've, oh, okay.  He's a movie critic
on channel eight in Dallas.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  And he does, uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F.  Anyway, it's on from
seven to nine, or something.  And, and, and people call in and it's, if you
keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting.  There's a certain a mount of
dribble that they do.  They've got, uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or
twelve years old, and they call in and they review movies.  But it's, uh --

B.46:  Oh.

A.47:  -- he, anyway, he, it's interesting.  You listen to him and then you, you
go watch the movie.  In fact, they had, people had just seen, I was listening
Sunday night a little bit when,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  I was going to pick up my daughter.  But, anyway, it was, uh, the, it,
it's interesting, though, the, the difficulty with, with DANCING WITH WOLVES
is that when you make a movie like that, and you produce it, and then you star
in it, uh, the question is, did he, did he really know it was going to be good
or did he just do it?

B.50:  I think that, I think he really, his heart was in it, but I, I don't think
he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.  I think it was something
that he really wanted to do.  He wanted to direct it, he wanted to, to star in
it.  You know, he, he enjoyed the story line and I think he just really w-, he
really wanted it.  And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or
whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy.
Because I think that, I think he did a good job and, and the self-satisfaction
he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him.

A.51:  Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, uh, the, the wagon
driver?

B.52:  [Lipsmack] Um.

A.53:  A little piece of trivia.  You know, the guy when he first headed out from
the army post.

B.54:  Yeah.  Who, no I don't know who that guy is.

A.55:  He, he plays [laughter] on MURPHY BROWN.

B.56:  Oh, he does?

A.57:  Yes.  He's, --

B.58:  As a recurring character every week?

A.59:  -- he's Eldon, her housepainter.

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  [Laughter] Can you,

B.62:  No,

A.63:  believe that?

B.64:  now see, I'd, I'd a never put those two together.

A.65:  That's, [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that
somebody said, did you notice that?

B.66:  Huh-uh.

A.67:  I thought, no, it's really funny.  But I thought, it, it, you think back,
and yeah, it was him, but with a --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- you know, with the beard and all that stuff.  I mean, it's, uh,

B.70:  Yeah, real scruffy looking [laughter].

A.71:  Yeah.  Real scruffy looking,

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  and it wa-, it was really funny, it's, uh, that, that he winds up
[laughter] playing in the movie.  But I thought, it's good that, you know, it
was a lot of fun.

B.74:  Yeah.

@@A.75:  I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at
about five minutes.  I should think we've done enough.

B.76:  You think so?  I mean, I haven't been watching my watch. Um, [static] I
guess, yeah.  Does it usually cut off?  Is that what,

A.77:  Well, I don't know.

B.78:  it does?

A.79:  Why do we end this thing?

B.80:  It used to,

A.81:  I think it just says hang up.

B.82:  it used to just automatically cut off but it says when the conversation
is over just say your good-byes and hang up.  So,

A.83:  [Laughter] Why don't we do that?

B.84:  I, I guess so.  Okay.

A.85:  Good-bye Sharon.

B.86:  Good talking to you Archie [/static].
