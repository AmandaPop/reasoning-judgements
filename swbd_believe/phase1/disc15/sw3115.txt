====================================================================

A.1:  All right and, and your occupation is teaching?  

B.2:  I'm a, I'm a substitute teacher.  

A.3:  Substitute teacher.

B.4:  Is, is this Pat I'm talking to now?  

A.5:  Yes, it is, it is.  

B.6:  Yeah, I'm a substitute teacher, in, I believe, the same school system we
both work in.

A.7:  Right.  Well, I was just trying to make an introduction, here [laughter].

B.8:  Oh, okay.  

A.9:  But, oh, and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school
this year, now.

B.10:  Oh. 

A.11:  I've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at Barron.

B.12:  Well, I bet you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.

@A.13:  Right.  I, well, not really.  I've got the, every day I've got to, uh,
read to kindergartners, so I'm going to be down on the floor with them.  I've
got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be doing, working with every day
for, uh, you know, a half hour.  So I'll be, I'll probably be wearing slacks
as often as I do because I'm, I'm, if I'm going to be down on the floor
messing with them, I'm not going to wear nylons and, you know --

B.14:  Well,  

A.15:  -- nice nylons and dresses. 

B.16:  What I wear sometimes depends on, on how cold I think the school might be
or what room I might be in --

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  -- since I'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to.  And always carry a
sweater.

A.19:  Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold
[laughter].

B.20:  Yes.  

A.21:  But, you don't know, uh, I guess at some of the other schools you go to
unless you've been there.

B.22:  No, you try to layer, so you can add or, or --  

A.23:  Subtract.  

B.24:  -- or take off.  

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  And it's, it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that
some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,

A.27:  I, I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools.
That's one of things, one of the things I ask about, you know, whether,
whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with
that, she just didn't like sloppy dressing.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  And, and I said, well, you know, that was okay.  And I'm, basically, I
just, you know, I wear slacks year round except every, about once a week I try
to wear a skirt.  And, and in the winter, you know, I just add a, maybe wear
longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer.  And add a heavier jacket or,
you know, wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  That's about, I don't, I don't really work in a profession that requires
that I wear a business suit and, you know, look really,

B.32:  Right, and, well, for me sometimes, they even have dress up days or they,
you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different 
outfits --

A.33:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.34:  -- and you have to have the color for that particular school if you, if you
choose to participate in --

A.35:  Right.  

B.36:  -- spirit week.  And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with
some --

A.37:  And you never know that, though -- 

B.38:  -- sort of hat.  

A.39:  -- sometimes when you're going in, do you?  

B.40:  No, but because I sort of stick to several schools, uh, I'm usually aware
that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember to
do it.

A.41:  Right, right.  

B.42:  And then many schools on a particular day during, uh, I guess football
season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day --

A.43:  Right.  

B.44:  -- which,  

A.45:  On what, Thursd-, Thursday.  

B.46:  Right, it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for
the senior high schools.

A.47:  Right, right.  So that would kind of give you a, a clue, I guess and, and
sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- of what's going on.  That, so that's, and I don't know, you know, I, I
think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know.  Are they
put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have to, the men have to
wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and, because some of the
teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans --

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  -- but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the
crease and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.  And, and, uh, I
don't know that that looks that bad.  But, if you're going to tell the kids
they c-, have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.

B.52:  Yeah, it, it, I see that the, I think the elementary school teachers, or
maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some
of the high school teachers, I think.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  But it, I think it varies, it, it just so much.  Anything, anything can go.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like
history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.  But they're just sort of into
clothes, and then there's other departments --

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  -- that aren't.  

A.59:  Right, right.  

B.60:  And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might
[laughter] --

A.61:  Yeah, there's a couple -- 

B.62:  -- might say,  

A.63:  -- teachers up there that, that do dress up more than others. 

B.64:  Right.  

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there, you
don't want to dress too tacky because you're [laughter] going to be in the
same room with them.

A.67:  Right.  Well, and you always, course, it's a standing joke, you know, when
the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat, you say, you know,
what, have you got a job interview today or,

B.68:  Or you're going --

A.69:  there, there's, 

B.70:  -- to be observed.  

A.71:  There's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh,
and would, would, uh, cause that to happen --

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- and I, I don't know how a coach would feel if, that teaches health or
Eng-, you know, English, or whatever that they had to wear a tie.  I, some of
those male coaches, that might really,

B.74:  Right.  They go around in their little coaching shorts or -- 

A.75:  Right, and a T-shirt.  

B.76:  -- parachute pants.  

A.77:  Right.  That I didn't ever understand.  I mean we've got coaches that teach
health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so [laughter], 

B.78:  Yeah, well at --

A.79:  Whether,

B.80:  -- Vines, the coaches don't do that.  They, they dress pretty good, I would
say and then they go to their coaching and they, they put their shorts --

A.81:  Change then.

B.82:  -- on there.  

A.83:  Well, see, that's what I would think.  

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  That's what I would think.  

B.86:  But, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or,
or anything.  They're, they dress like any other teacher would in --

A.87:  Right.  

B.88:  -- in a classroom situation, not in P E.  

A.89:  Course, we had, had one coach, one period he'd teach P E and the next
period Health and then a period of P E --

B.90:  Those I can understand.  

A.91:  -- and, and that's hard.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  You know, so he just left warm-ups on, but, but, uh, no, I think, really
probably, they could, they could, uh, really, and I don't know if, if they
put, make uniforms the thing for the kids, I guess the teachers will have to
follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and,

B.94:  I don't think we'll ever get to that.  

A.95:  You don't think so.  

B.96:  No, I don't think.  I think we're going the opposite direction.  It's the
parochial schools that I guess many ti-, they've had uniforms for years, I r-,
don't really know if they still do.

A.97:  Well, some of them, yes they do and, and it's not -- 

B.98:  It certainly makes it easier to dress.

A.99:  -- at some of the private schools, but even there's a couple public schools
in Dallas where, where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers, you know,
dress --

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  -- in accordance with that.

B.102:  Well, it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, I think, that you
don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe.

A.103:  Uh-huh.  Well I, I think it would make a difference at school.  I, I don't
think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or
wearing sh-, too shorts, too short or they've got the really short skirt and
the black nylons and the high, you know, I mean --

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  -- it's a lot of trouble to, to take care of that.  And, of course, the
kids say, then why bother, just let me wear what I want.  And, and yet we
can't to that either.  I'd like to see them go to, to not necessarily a
uniform, but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt.  You know,
that would, that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them.  But if
they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could
buy them anywhere they wanted and,

B.106:  Yeah, but I doubt that that would come ab-, --

A.107:  And then the girls, 

B.108:  -- that that will come about.  Just [laughter],  

A.109:  Right.  

B.110:  Yeah, I, I,  

A.111:  I don't, no, not in Plano.  

B.112:  No not,  

A.113:  They may get a-, --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational
process there.

B.116:  Well, I think it does.  It, it takes their minds off of, of trying to
compete.

A.117:  Highland Park's thinking about going that route.

B.118:  Uh-huh.  

A.119:  So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more
professionally than they do.

B.120:  Yeah, I, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but,

A.121:  Yeah, I agree with you on,
