[Beep]

A.1:  Okay.

@B.2:  Well, what kind of pet do you have? [breathing].

A.3:  One very old fat cat #[laughter].#

B.4:  #That's right.#  [laughter] I remember.

A.5:  Prissy, and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house.

B.6:  That's right. [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Prissy get's you in trouble #because# -- 

A.9:  #That's# right.

B.10:  -- you can't have them there.

A.11:  She does shed a lot of fur.

B.12:  And how many pets have you had?

A.13:  She's, we've had her for a long time.  We used to have a Spitz that kind
of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were
supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years [laughter].

B.14:  [Noise].

A.15:  Usually we've had dogs or cats.

B.16:  Yeah.  Well, you know we have a dog named Punkin.

A.17:  Yes.

B.18:  So what, we've had him [breathing] [lipsmack] a year and a half [lipsmack]
and, uh, it's okay.  I don't know, I, I told my kids, basically I would just
not as-, I just as soon not have a pet in the house #but# --

A.19:  #[Lipsmack] Yeah#. #I'm reaching# --

B.20:  -- #I give in.# 

A.21:  -- that point, too.

B.22:  Yeah, it, it's, it's hard for me.  I like pets a lot but I just don't like
them in the house.

A.23:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.24:  So I w-, you know, I wish we lived in an area where [sigh] we had a big
backyard.

A.25:  [Noise].

B.26:  I'd have a dog [breathing].  

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  You know, I'd have it outside but, um, #I,# 

A.29:  #Well,# I'm thinking of a, next time, about going back to a dog, though,
because the cats really do shed a lot.  

B.30:  #Do they?#

A.31:  #You just# never get rid of the cat hair.  And, I know there are a lot of
dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed, so.  Emily wants a dog.  A lot of
her friends --

B.32:  #Sure.#

A.33:  -- #have# little house mops, kind of like yours [laughter].

B.34:  Sure.  Well, it is easy and like Punkin is real easy.

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  #I mean,# we don't even have to walk him much or anything.  He, 

A.37:  But do you have to let him outside {pause} for all his business and all?

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  Yeah, he goes out in the morning.

A.41:  You see that's what would be hard for us #since# --

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  -- we're not there a lot.

B.44:  Well, unless you got a doggie door.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  You know, like my, my aunt and uncle have a doggie door and their dog just
goes in and out at will.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  So that, #that's nice.#

A.49:  #I think Jay# would go bananas over that, though. [laughter]  He likes for
our house to be as #secure as,#  

B.50:  #All sealed up# [laughter]. 

A.51:  possible [laughter]. 

B.52:  Yeah, I know, that that's the problem with it but, uh --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- but basically d-, our dogs worked out, has worked out well.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And I think it's nice for the children.  I, it's not my most favorite
thing in the world but,

A.57:  That can be so therapeutic though.

B.58:  #Yeah.#

A.59:  #When,# when I really want to just crawl into a shell I think, wouldn't it
be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat. [laughter]

B.60:  Right.  Well, they are loving, I mean, #that's# --

A.61:  #Uh-huh.#

B.62:  -- that's the thing, uh.  You know my friend Barb, I have a good friend who
has just moved here and she's gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy
about those cats.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  And she's single, lives by herself and they totally,

A.65:  [Noise] {Sounds like a burp}.

B.66:  have kept her company.

A.67:  #Yeah.#

B.68:  #You# know, I mean, it is just, it's really meant a lot to her to have
those cats.  

A.69:  [Lipsmack]  And I really, I, I don't think I'm prejudiced since I've had
both, but I think cats are more prone to really have personality.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  I mean they own you rather then the other way #around.#

B.72:  #Uh-huh.#  Uh-huh.

A.73:  And I really do believe that.  I get a kick out of seeing my seventy-seven
year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed not too long ago
and she said no more.  You know, I just, I can't go through that again and it
wasn't three months before she [laughter] had another one and just --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- adapting to it just like she always had.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  And it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your
friend.  

B.78:  Yeah, it's really, you know, Barb said she wishes that she had done it
years ago. 

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  You know that she had, uh, gotten an animal years ago because she's been
single a long time and,

A.81:  [Lipsmack].

B.82:  you know, she says it just makes a world of difference to #come# --

A.83:  #Yeah.#

B.84:  -- home and have them in the house.  

A.85:  [Breathing] Growing up it was so funny because Mother would always have a
soft heart for strays.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  And {pause} we never, back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals
that much, you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never
get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along.  It wasn't
usual, unusual for us to have six and seven cats and I remember my first
camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of
them that were going to be award winning type [laughter] photos.  They've
always been a part of my life [breathing].

B.88:  Well, I guess.  So you've had them, so you've had them just from early #on
then.#

A.89:  #Oh yeah.#  We had a cocker spaniel growing up but, but the cats were the
things that I loved.  [Lipsmack] And especially with just being around kittens
and the babies and all.

B.90:  Now were they indoor cats or #outdoor cats?#

A.91:  #No, no.#  Dad never would have allowed that.  

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  So they always just kind of showed up #and# --

B.94:  #Uh-huh.#

A.95:  -- came and went and had babies and [laughter] we played with them. We, we
used them as dolls sometimes.  We'd dress them up and put them in carriages as
much as they'd tolerate it.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  So, it was always fun.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  Well, now see we lived on a real busy,

A.99:  [Breathing].

B.100:  intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog --

A.101:  Oh.

B.102:  -- but he was killed.

A.103:  #Yeah [noise].#

B.104:  #We, we# couldn't, it was, it was not, it just wasn't conducive to animals.

A.105:  That was traumatic wasn't it?

B.106:  Yeah, it was --

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  -- it was very traumatic.  My sister, it was really upsetting to my little
sister --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- and, and, uh, so th-, it, we didn't have many pets growing up just
because our house wasn't conducive to that.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  And, uh, it just wasn't safe.  We didn't have a fence and our dog, 

A.113:  [Noise].

B.114:  just got killed.  We'd keep him chained up but --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- he got out and, you know, sure enough was hit by a car.  #So,#

A.117:  #Yeah,# that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took
it hard because he was the one who that had left the gate open.  So he --

B.118:  #Oh.#

A.119:  -- #blamed himself# personally although, you know, there were so many
things that could have been different.  But it was hard for him to cope with it
being his fault.

B.120:  #Yeah, I bet.#

A.121:  #So I do hate# that.  I, that's one reason I like cats and critters that
can stay inside, because you don't face that.

B.122:  Right.

A.123:  It's hard.

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  Especially if you really do get attached to them.  I'm, I'm already kind
of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and, oh, I just
know it's going to come sooner or later.  So, that's one reason I've been
letting Emily talk about dogs --

B.126:  #Uh-huh.#

A.127:  -- #because# I think,

B.128:  [Breathing]. 

A.129:  we, we say that's going to be the end but I think when it really comes to
it we'll want another pet. [noise]

B.130:  How old is Prissy?

A.131:  She's [noise] at least thirteen or fourteen.  We don't know exactly [noise]
because we got her as a young kitten --

B.132:  Uh.

A.133:  -- or a young cat and didn't know that much about her.  She's a neat cat,
I mean she owns us --

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  -- all the way.

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  But {pause} it does require a little bit of work --

B.138:  [Lipsmack] #Well# --

A.139:  -- #and housecleaning.#

B.140:  -- you know, it does.  

A.141:  [Breathing]. 

B.142:  That's just it and right now [breathing] I do well just to take care of my
children [laughter].

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  [Laughter] 

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  You know without taking care of an animal too.

A.147:  Uh-huh.

B.148:  So,

A.149:  And you have the trouble when you travel, #too.#

B.150:  #That's# right.

A.151:  We always, we board her now and that gets kind of expensive.

B.152:  That's right, we just, we just were on vacation and, uh, it was, you know,
it was expensive.

A.153:  Yeah.

B.154:  Plus, I think, you know for Punkin, he didn't, you know he didn't like it.
We #were# --

A.155:  #Yeah.#

B.156:  -- gone two weeks and that was hard on him --

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  -- to be boarded for two weeks.

A.159:  Where'd you all go?

B.160:  We can't talk about that can we?  [laughter]  We went to #Gulf# --

A.161:  #[Laughter] No, I# guess not [laughter].

B.162:  -- [Laughter] #Gulf# --

A.163:  #It's not# pet related.

B.164:  -- Gulf Shores, #Alabama# --

A.165:  #Oh boy.#

B.166:  -- and New Orleans and --

A.167:  Yeah.

B.168:  -- we had a really good time.

A.169:  Oh, how neat.

B.170:  So, but yeah, #Punkin was,#

A.171:  #But the# puppy survived [laughter].

B.172:  Yes, he did.  I always wonder, I think, well now how much do they remember.
You know, like,

A.173:  [Lipsmack] And you know my aunt says they do drug them.  I just went
bananas when she told me that that was a fact, that she had shopped kennels
and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot.
And that just --

B.174:  Oh.

A.175:  -- gave me the creeps because I, you know, I just hate to think they did
that to anything or anybody.

B.176:  Huh.

A.177:  But she said every vet's office {voices begin to fade} and kennel, if they
would let it, if they ...
