===========================================================================

A.1:  [Beep]  Well now I, I have a question for you.  

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  Do you like, uh, fresh water fishing or salt water fishing.  

B.4:  I like, well, what I usually do is fresh water fishing.  I haven't been
salt water fishing since I was about ten.

A.5:  Is that right?  

B.6:  Yeah.  And I do everything up at Lake Texoma.  

A.7:  Oh, you do?  

B.8:  Oh, yeah.  

A.9:  Okay.  

B.10:  I'm a striper fisherman.  

A.11:  Oh, where do you fish for striper there?  

B.12:  Oh, ever-, wherever those little suckers are.  

A.13:  [Laughter]. 

B.14:  But, uh, we camp at the lodge, Texoma State Park.  

A.15:  Okay.  

B.16:  Over on the Oklahoma side.  

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  And, uh, but usually when we go striper fi-, when I go out for the big 
ones --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- we travel down the, you know where the channel is down the middle of the
lake.

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  We usually --

A.23:  Pretty much.

B.24:  -- chase them down through there.  

A.25:  Okay.  So you're out in a boat then.  

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  

A.27:  Oh. 

B.28:  Oh, yeah.  Do you ever go up there?  

A.29:  I've gone up there camping, like at Eisenhower State Park.  

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  And I've observed fishing, but I've never actually fished there.

B.32:  Oh, it's good fishing -- 

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  -- up there.  

A.35:  So you like to go for striper then.  

B.36:  Yeah, of course, I, you know, I won't throw anything back [laughter].

A.37:  [Laughter] Well, the time I went and watched I went over to the, uh, to
the dam, and it was right after one of the major, major rains that we'd had.

B.38:  Oh, yeah.  

A.39:  Uh, in fact I think it had been over the spillway recently.  When we went
it was back down.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  But, uh, some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of
them.  And people were, they really had the gates open.

B.42:  Oh, my gosh.  

A.43:  Big time. 

B.44:  That's supposed to be the greatest time to fish.

A.45:  Well, I couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling
out.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  And there were just people galore for that matter.  Just,

B.48:  Oh, yeah.  

A.49:  Just everywhere.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.  

A.51:  Just huge fish.  

B.52:  It's fun, well my dad got me hooked on it.  

A.53:  So to speak.  

B.54:  And, uh,  

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  Yeah, [laughter], Oh, god.  Pun, pun.  And, uh, we'd go out, he liked to go
about five thirty and, you know, watch the sun come up every morning --

A.57:  All right.  

B.58:  -- and, uh, boy, we, we knew a bunch of the striper guides and, and so we'd
follow them and he had a C B on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd
just follow the channel and when it's, you know, middle July through late
August when it's so hot they stay down real deep, all the big ones do.

A.59:  Deep in the channel, huh.  

B.60:  Yeah.  Follow that channel on up.  

A.61:  I'll be.  

B.62:  But, uh, so now my cousin will, I make him get up early in the morning and
take me out striper fishing and then, we usually fish under the bridge at
night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that --

A.63:  Oh, wow.  

B.64:  -- because when we go, a lot of times, uh, the waves are so big, I don't
want my kids out there --

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  -- because it's sort of dangerous, but, I love it.  I love it. 

A.67:  [Laughter] Well, I used to go every summer to northern Canada.

B.68:  Oh, really?  

A.69:  And so, I've, I've been spoiled by that.  

B.70:  Oh. 

A.71:  Uh, but I had a string of seven or eight years in a row of, uh, sort of a
close knit group.  We would just hop in the car and drive straight through --

B.72:  Oh, how much fun.  

A.73:  -- two thousand miles.  And, uh, we started out fishing out of a lodge and
then we started, uh, either taking our own canoes or renting them --

B.74:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.75:  -- when we got there and hitting a few of the, you know, smaller lakes
along the river chain.

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  And, uh, catch Northern Pike and Walleye primarily.  

B.78:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.79:  And sometimes lake trout also.  

B.80:  Oh, how much fun.  

A.81:  We'd always go the first week in June.  You know, essentially as soon as
school was out --

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  -- and everything was all over and done we'd, uh, we'd go.  Uh, course one
year I went two weeks too early with a friend that was, he, this point he had
graduated from college and was in the Army and he had a two week period he, he
had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany --

B.84:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.85:  -- and so I went with him in the middle of May.  And much to our surprise,
when we got there all the lakes were still frozen [laughter].

B.86:  Oh, you're kidding!  

A.87:  No.  

B.88:  Ooh.  Not for me.  

A.89:  Yeah, the first week we were there we just had to camp and, uh, we could go
on the streams.  They were open up, you know, where the water was flowing.

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  But the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole f-, yeah --

B.92:  Oh, my gosh!  

A.93:  -- whole first week we were there.  

B.94:  Ooh.  

A.95:  But then the next week they were just, just like day and night difference.
We had some rain and wind and it, it cleared all the lakes off and, uh, you
know, the fishing was already really picking up.

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  But, uh, those were my favorite fishing trips.  The most serious fishing I
guess I've done.

B.98:  Yeah, yeah.  When I take the kids out, like I say, we, in fact Memorial Day
weekend we went up to the lake and, uh, [lipsmack] my cousins have a boat.  My
boat is sitting in my driveway not running.

A.99:  Oh. 

B.100:  And, uh, so we go up there and we decided that we'd, you know, go out f-,
we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on, let's
go fishing.  We hauled in, well, we brought in thirty-three fish and we had --

A.101:  Good grief.  

B.102:  -- thrown a bunch of little ones back.  

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  And, uh, so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back
out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty-three more and had --

A.105:  Wow.  

B.106:  -- thrown a bunch of little ones back, but we had more fun.  Those kids,
they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones.

A.107:  Right.  

B.108:  And it was so funny because I mean, they'd just be hanging over the side of
the boat, mom, I think I got a fish, I think I got a fish!  [Laughter].

A.109:  That's incredible.  

B.110:  It was hysterical.  But,  

A.111:  Boy.  

B.112:  Jamie is getting to the age now that, when I get up and go fishing early in
the morning, he wants to go, too, you know.

A.113:  Oh, boy.  

B.114:  He doesn't want to get left behind anymore.  

A.115:  Yeah.  

B.116:  [Lipsmack]  So, it's getting a little difficult to do that but, 

A.117:  [Laughter]. 

B.118:  We love it.  We just love it.  

A.119:  Well, I need to break my kids in.  They, I have a son, Wesley, that enjoys
it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any --

B.120:  Uh-huh.  

A.121:  -- fishing.  

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  So I, I'd like to break them in a little bit.  

B.124:  Well, I have to watch it because Ashley will out fish her brother half the
time.

A.125:  Uh-oh.  

B.126:  And so, you know, that gets a little sore.  

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  But where we camp, there, there's a, you know, little bit of a inlet where
we park the boats and stuff.

A.129:  Uh-huh.  

B.130:  So real early in the morning before it gets hot and then, you know, right
at dusk, uh, down in the trees down there, boy all those little sunfish come
up --

A.131:  Right.  

B.132:  -- and they'll go down there while I'm cooking dinner and just start
reeling those little babies in --

A.133:  Huh.  

B.134:  -- and they have more fun with that.  

A.135:  What do they use for bait?  

B.136:  Oh, usually I'll buy them a thing of worms or a lot of times I just give
them a piece of bacon and they're t-, they'll tear up bacon --

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  -- and stick it, I mean those, they'll, they'll bite empty hooks.  That's
what's so funny.

A.139:  Good grief [laughter].  

B.140:  And when we're out chasing the big stripers, we use those perch for bait
[laughter].

A.141:  Yeah, use those little ones for bait, yeah.  Why not.  

B.142:  Yeah.  It's great.  

A.143:  Oh, me.  

B.144:  But we just love it up there.  In fact, Jamie wanted to go up this weekend,
with it being Fourth of July weekend --

A.145:  Fourth of July, yeah {faint}.  

B.146:  -- but, uh, I can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet.
I'm still pretty sore [laughter].

A.147:  Oh, me.  

B.148:  So, anyway, but, have you been, uh, salt water fishing?  

A.149:  I haven't really done any of that.  Uh, and oddly enough, uh, Jackie's
parents live on the, the beach in North Carolina.

B.150:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.151:  And we've, I guess we went out one time and just fished, you know, from the
shore, like in the winter.

B.152:  Uh-huh.  

A.153:  You know, one Christmas trip.  But other than that, that's really been it.
They, uh, I've always wanted to actually go out in the boat.

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  I think I went out on a, a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time.

B.156:  Uh-huh.  

A.157:  But, uh, and I was, I was too sick to, [laughter] to enjoy that.

B.158:  Right.
