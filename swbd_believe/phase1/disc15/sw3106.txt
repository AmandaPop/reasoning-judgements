A.1:  Hello?  

B.2:  Hello?  

A.3:  This is Marilyn Spivey, Richardson, Texas.  

B.4:  Marilyn, it's Angela.  

A.5:  I knew that was you [laughter].  Well, this should be a good one.  Your
mother will like it.

B.6:  How funny.  

A.7:  Let's see.  Now, what do I do, push,  

B.8:  Push one.  

A.9:  Push one, okay, hold on [beep].  Okay are you there?  

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

@A.11:  Well, do you subscribe to any magazines?  

B.12:  Yes.  

A.13:  Which ones?

B.14:  Uh, SOAP OPERA DIGEST is one.  

A.15:  Oh. 

B.16:  And,  

A.17:  How many soap operas do you listen to?  

B.18:  Uh, j-, two mainly.  

A.19:  Oh, and so you can keep up with when you miss with that.  

B.20:  Yeah, well, it was a special thing.  I think it was like a free
subscription --

A.21:  Uh.  

B.22:  -- that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at
the end of it.  I never did, but,

A.23:  Oh, I see.  Do you --

B.24:  But we take CONSUMER,

A.25:  -- subscribe to any others?  

B.26:  Yeah, CONSUMER DIGEST.  

A.27:  Oh. 

B.28:  Now we do like that one.  

A.29:  Now, what do you find out in that?  Because I haven't read that one.

B.30:  It, it has all different kinds of, uh, tips on, on like appliances and T V
-s and V C R -s and cars,

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Just different things that you buy and, and what the latest items are out
and stuff.  It, it's real informative.

A.33:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.34:  And then PEOPLE magazine.  

A.35:  Okay.  Well, I only subscribe to two.  One of them is PEOPLE magazine --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- and, uh, that usually has the latest, oh, people in the world and very
interesting and then I subscribe, I bet you know what this one's going to be,
to the NATIONAL ENQUIRER [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah.  I'd forgotten,  

A.39:  Because it's good, light reading.  Some of it I wouldn't believe but I, but
it's [door] interesting reading and, believe it or not, there are a few
interesting articles in it, too.

B.40:  Yeah, they're, I've, I've bought it a couple of times.  That or one of the
other ones like that one.  You know, after reading the front page there will
be something that just catches my eye and I'll go ahead and buy it.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  Because sometimes, like you said, not all of it is believable, and if you
use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not.

A.43:  Well, it's good light reading and since our business is at the house I,
when I'm eating lunch I like to read one or the other, you know, comes in the
mail once a week and, and that's what I read when I eat my lunch.

B.44:  Do, 

A.45:  But I really don't read that many.  I never do buy them, you know, like
when I'm at the grocery store, magazines much.  I guess pretty much after
that, it's the newspaper and just books.

B.46:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't, I don't buy, I don't buy them at the store, either.
I can't even remember last time I bought one at the grocery store in a long
time.

A.47:  Yeah.  I used to, years ago, read like LADIES HOME JOURNAL and MCCALL'S and
some of those, but I, [breathing] I just kind of stick to these two now but,
uh, you know, because they come, to, I do subscribe and they come once a week
so --

B.48:  Right.  

A.49:  -- you know, they're, and I don't really have time to read anymore.

B.50:  What don't you like about the magazines?  

A.51:  We, you mean the two that I sub-, -- 

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  -- subscribe to?  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  Uh.  Oh, well, now, I, I guess I just pick out and read out of both of them
what interests me.  There's an article about something way out in the NATIONAL
ENQUIRER, or something, I just, you know, I just don't read it.  I just read
the ones that sound interesting to me.

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Usually about movie stars or famous people.  

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  I been --

B.60:  I,  

A.61:  -- reading all the stuff about Ken-, Kennedy [laughter].  

B.62:  [Laughter] I don't like all the advertisements and some, sometimes it
seems like the magazines are full of more advertisements than they are
anything else.

A.63:  Yeah.  Now that, that's true.  There is a lot of those.  I don't pay any, I
don't read those much either.

B.64:  I don't either.  It's just you have to turn all those pages to get to,
finally to the story you were reading --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- when it's interrupted.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  But I like PEOPLE magazine, too.  

A.69:  Yeah.  Uh, uh, although, it's getting rather expensive.  Since on the last
time I had to, uh, subscribe for a year, it was like seventy-five dollars
[laughter], and I thought, This will probably be the last time [laughter].

B.70:  Yeah, it is getting really expensive.  

A.71:  I'll just buy the ones off the newsstand, then, once a month or something
when there's something I'm especially interested in reading about, you know.

B.72:  Yeah.  Or get somebody in the neighborhood to, to do it and then everybody
pass it through.

A.73:  Yeah, that's probably what we should do like they, they do books that way.

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  You know.  So, uh, okay, so, does your mother still take PEOPLE magazine?

B.76:  They didn't renew their subscription because of [laughter] that.

A.77:  [Laughter] Cost measure, huh?  

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  We all have to have those every once in a while.  

B.80:  Yeah, well I think we're just going to do like you said, just take the ones
at the newsstand that, that look interesting from now on --

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  -- because seventy-five dollars for a magazine -- 

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  -- that's just, that's too much.  That's,  

A.85:  They're all so much more than they used to be years ago.  Years ago I think
people read a lot more magazines.

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  But, uh [breathing],  

B.88:  I don't think people have time to read them anymore.  

A.89:  Well, that's,  

B.90:  It's just usually the newspapers and, and then they're off doing their own
thing.

A.91:  That's true.  

B.92:  Weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time people
seem to read, on the weekends.

A.93:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.94:  Because mainly I, I'm like you.  I read books.  

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  More.  

A.97:  And, and it's, it's more, and I can think, more people do, I think just
read books.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  So, well, let's see, if you were going to subscribe to a magazine, which
one would you pick other than the ones that are you reading?

B.100:  Uh, I don't know.  I, I just, I don't, I'm not that interested in the
magazines, it, you know, other than like PEOPLE or this CONSUMER DIGEST and
the reason why we got that one was, you know, it has good informative things
in there for things you're going to be buying --

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- at, at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax
tips in it and stuff like that.  Maybe the, the other one, there's one out
that's, that has to do with, with financial things like how to save money and,
and what bonds and insurances and --

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  -- stuff like that to buy.  That, we've got, we had a sample subscription
to that one and that one was, was good, too.  It had a, the art-, the one
that, that, uh, was a sample one, had an art-, article in there about college,
saving for your children and --

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- and what to do and what not to do and how much the, uh, projected cost
was going to be --

A.107:  Yeah.  

B.108:  -- by the time like, you know, mine reached college age and stuff.  And
it's going to be pretty darn expensive and, and it was saying, you know, what
to, you know, how you could go about putting,

A.109:  Starting to save now.  

B.110:  Yeah, yeah, like those E bonds.  There's something called an E bond that
you can buy and it, and it, you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the
child and then when they turn it in when it mat-,
