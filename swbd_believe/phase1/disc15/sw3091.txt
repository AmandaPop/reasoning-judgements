=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess we are ready to go.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  Uh, what are your favorite types of restaurants?

B.4:  We enjoy various types of restaurants, uh, there is excellent Italian
restaurants here, there is some Cajun cooking and, of course, there is always
steaks [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter]  And barbecue, right.

B.6:  And barbecue, right.

A.7:  Uh, do you eat out quite frequently?

B.8:  Oh, not as much as we used to but, still at least about once a week.

A.9:  Really.  And, where is the last place that you went to eat?

B.10:  Let's see, we ate at Louisiana Purchase up in Plano, just recently.  We had
a craving for catfish,

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  and they had some good catfish, there.  And, uh, we enjoy, there is an
Italian restaurant over in Garland, also, called Taste of Italy.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  I do not know if you have tried any of those.  There is about four of them
around town.

A.15:  No, I have not.

B.16:  But it is good home style Italian cooking.  It is not the fancy veal and
things you get at some of the other Italian restaurants.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  They make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like
that [sigh].

A.19:  ((Oh)).

B.20:  And I have also recently eaten at Jacolya out at Addison, Cajun cooking.

A.21:  [Sigh] Okay.  Uh, what areas do you usually eat in, do you find?

B.22:  North Dallas and Richardson and Plano area.  We live out near Richardson
Square Mall.

A.23:  Oh, okay.

B.24:  So, it is generally in that north side of town.

A.25:  Do you ever get down to Deep Elm or Greenville or McKinney?

B.26:  Yes, there is an excellent, uh, I guess it is Taiwan ((the)) Southeast
Asian type restaurant down in Deep Elm, I, West Wind or,

A.27:  I have heard of that, I have heard several,

B.28:  ((Yes)).

A.29:  people say that, so it must really be, I think it is part Vietnamese or
something.

B.30:  Yeah, I believe so, I am really not sure exactly what style it is but, it
is very, very good.  Now right in the edge of North Dallas, there at Skillman,
just north of L B J --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- there is another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yoli's, Y O L I 'S,
--

A.33:  Okay.

B.34:  -- which serves some excellent food, too, in that, in that style of food.

A.35:  So what would,

B.36:  It's not a fancy place.  I have eaten there at lunch primarily.

A.37:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Uh, so what is your favorite restaurant in Dallas?

B.38:  Oh, that is hard to say, but the ones that we like most are out of business
now but (( )) [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter] Unfortunately, everyone else did not like them quite as well,
#right.#

B.40:  #Right.# But, Papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for, uh,
continental style cooking.

A.41:  We have not tried that one, 

B.42:  ((Oh)).

A.43:  I, uh, we belong to the Passbook, uh, Club.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  And, so we tend to use their coupons whenever possible.  And I know that is
in there and I would like to get over there.

B.46:  I think you would enjoy it.  It is a tad on the expensive side, uh,
probably run, uh, with dinner and, uh, some drinks about twenty-five, thirty
dollars a person.

A.47:  Well, when you have a half price coupon, it is not quite so #bad then.#

B.48:  #It# helps quite a bit.

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  Right, yes.  We have used some of the coupons also at some of the places,
but, uh, that is, I think one of our favorite, our, our most, most favorite
restaurant was LaLouve, which was here on (( )) in north, just off of Central
Expressway in North Dallas.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  But that has been gone for several years now.

A.53:  Well, it is just a shame that all the restaurants that, you know, open and
close, you, it seems you go to one and find one that is your favorite and the
next thing you know it's gone.

B.54:  It's gone, right.

A.55:  Well, I heard that there are more restaurants per capita in Dallas than
there are in New York.

B.56:  That does not surprise me [laughter].

A.57:  I know they are everywhere, people eat out in Dallas, like I have never
seen [laughter].

B.58:  Yeah [laughter] [sigh].  Well, we, we have enjoyed it, the, there have been
some excellent restaurants here through the years and of course, some go up,
some go down and, uh, it just depends on the chef in some cases,

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  of course. 

A.61:  Have you been to the new Sonny Bryan's down in, uh, uh, what is it, the
West End?

B.62:  No, I have not, uh, I have not been to that one.

A.63:  Well, I have not been to the old one for that matter, 

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  but I thought that since there is a new one opening, perhaps it would be
easier to get into.

B.66:  Yeah.  Well, again, the old Sonny Bryan's up there by, uh, what is it, by,
uh, Methodist Hospital,

A.67:  Is it by, over on Lemmon or something?

B.68:  Up on Inwood, (( )) yeah.

A.69:  Okay.

B.70:  Yeah.  That one is not re-, it's, it's a, it's a barbecue stand really.
It's not really a restaurant [laughter].

A.71:  Well, that is what I understand, you sit at school tables or out on the
hood of your car.

B.72:  That's right.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  They make some really good barbecue there.

A.75:  Well, that's fine for the summer, but I do not think I would be too
interested in the Winter [laughter].

B.76:  [Laughter]  Right.

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  I used to liv-, work over on, on, just off of Stemmons and we would go over
there about once a week for barbecue for lunch.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  But, there is, uh, oh there is a lots of good restaurants here.  I think
the really hard thing is that you want fresh seafood, of course, we are a
little bit away from the coast.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Not as far as Kansas but [laughter] ...

A.83:  Well, I am from Saint Louis, so believe me, it was harder to get in Saint
Louis,

B.84:  ((Right)).

A.85:  than it is here.

B.86:  (( )) for seafood, just all around good eating seafood, Vincent's has some
really good seafood.

A.87:  You know, I go by that place all the time, 

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  over on Midway.

B.90:  Well, there is several, there is one in Plano, one on Midway, there is one
over by Love Field, I think.

A.91:  Alright.

B.92:  There are three or four of them here in town, and [sigh] we have gone to
the one over on Midway and also, to the one up in Plano.  As a matter of fact,
we were there New Year's Eve at the one on Plano.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  We will have to try that sometime, because, uh,

B.94:  Yeah, I think you would really enjoy it.

A.95:  Well, we went to, or I went to Ralph and Kacoos for lunch one day --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and, I have heard good and bad about that.  The guide always reviews it
very poorly,

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  but, what I had, and then, uh, the two guys I went to lunch with, they
both let me taste what they had,

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  and it was delicious.

B.102:  We had dinner there, we have a group of friends we go out once with, and we
had dinner at Ralph and Kacoos last fall, I think.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  And we were there and it was excellent the night that we were there.

A.105:  Well, you know how these restaurant reviewers are.

B.106:  Oh, yeah.

A.107:  [Laughter]  I think their tastes are jaded.

B.108:  It depends on whether they got comp the meal or not.

A.109:  [Laughter] Yeah, right.  [/laughter] Well, I guess we probably have talked
about our five minutes worth.

B.110:  [Laughter] I think we have.  I certainly enjoyed talking with you.

A.111:  Well, and I also have written down the Taste of Italy.  We will have to try
that,

B.112:  (( )).

A.113:  sometime.

B.114:  You will have to try it.  Do not expect anything fancy.

A.115:  That is alright with me.

B.116:  It's home style food, not expensive, [sigh] and, uh, get the dinner salad
with the olives on it.

A.117:  Okay and do they have good lasagna?

B.118:  Yes.  My wife swears by the lasagna.

A.119:  Okay, because that is my husband's favorite.

B.120:  Yeah, they have excellent lasagna, and if you get like spaghetti with, uh,
get with the Italian sauce it should taste like home made Italian sausage you
get in Chicago.

A.121:  Okay, great.

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  Thanks for the tip.

B.124:  Thank you.

A.125:  #Bye-bye.#

B.126:  #Bye-bye.#
