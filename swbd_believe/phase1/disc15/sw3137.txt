REMARKS:        There was a steady bit of static in background of both
speakers during the entire conversation.  Speaker B appeared to be in the 
kitchen and preparing a meal.   

=========================================================================

@A.1:  Well, uh, Cathy do you have any pets in your home?

B.2:  We do.  Actually, we have a, a Golden Retriever [noise].

A.3:  #How nice [noise].#

B.4:  #Uh, dog.#

A.5:  #Uh-huh.#

B.6:  #And we# have a cat and we have, we just got two, uh, [lipsmack] Russian
Dwarf hamsters [laughter].  #Which,#

A.7:  #[Noise] Dwarf# hamsters.

B.8:  Dwarf hamsters.  Lucky us, huh [laughter].

A.9:  How big is a dwarf hamster?

B.10:  Real small.

A.11:  [Breathing].

B.12:  They're maybe about, oh, two inches long.  They're real small.

A.13:  #Yeah.#

B.14:  #They're# real tiny.  They're cute.  They really are cute [laughter].

A.15:  My goodness.  Where did you get those?

B.16:  Uh, my son's baseball coach, uh, had two and then had multiple [laughter]
hamsters that he was trying to get rid of.

A.17:  [Noise] Uh-huh.

B.18:  And so, that's, that's where we got them from.  Now we've been assured
they're both males and they're in two separate cages #so# --

A.19:  #Okay.#  [Laughter].

B.20:  -- we don't want any [laughter],

A.21:  I was going to say #that's,#

B.22:  #We# don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business #[laughter].#

A.23:  #[Laughter]#  Oh.

B.24:  How about you?

A.25:  Well, right now we don't have any pets.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  [Lipsmack] We've, uh, we've tried various things.  We, you know, 

B.28:  [Noise].

A.29:  obviously do have children [noise] --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and, uh,

B.32:  [Noise] {sounds like speaker is slicing cutting something on a cutting
board}. 

A.33:  we tried a dog first.  

B.34:  [Noise] {water running}.

A.35:  And we had a,

B.36:  [Noise].

A.37:  puppy, a, uh, [lipsmack] a what did they call him, a Westie?

B.38:  Uh-huh.  Is, are they very small?  [Noise] {water running}.

A.39:  They're small.

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #It's# a terrier.  And, uh, that didn't work out very well.  

B.42:  [/Noise] Oh.  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And, uh, for a variety of reasons but, the, the dog was just all mouth and
teeth #it seemed like.#

B.44:  #Oh, really?  Yeah.#  

A.45:  The only way it could show affection was by [noise] nibbling y-, #on
things.#

B.46:  #Oh, no# kidding?  #Uh-huh.#

A.47:  #Yeah.#  So, it, it never worked out,

B.48:  [Noise].

A.49:  and, uh, so we, we, ha-, we gave up on that and then we tried cats.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And we ended up with a, 

B.52:  [Noise].

A.53:  a bad set of cats.

B.54:  Oh [noise].

A.55:  If that's {pause} possible but [noise] --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- I'm, I'm a big fan of cats.  I always had cats growing up.

B.58:  Are you?  Yeah.

A.59:  And, uh, my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all. 

B.60:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.61:  But we had these two, that, they we knew someone that, uh, uh, you know,
wanted to get rid of these kittens and, uh, [sigh] so we gave it a try.  And,
uh,

B.62:  [Noise].

A.63:  they were impossible to house train.

B.64:  Really.  Boy, that's real unusual for cats.  Usually you just put down a
litter box and that's the end of that.

A.65:  That's the end of #that.#

B.66:  #Yeah.#

A.67:  And these, it was real strange, and, uh, they were both solid white 
cats --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and, uh, 

B.70:  [Door]. 

A.71:  one had blue eyes and the other had [noise] {like blowing} regular, you
know, yellow eyed --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- cats.

B.74:  Uh-huh [/door].

A.75:  Brothers and sisters.  And we had them declawed and we had them neutered
and, uh, invested all [laughter] that money in it, into it, but, uh, we
simply, one of them in particular, we just could not, uh, train to use, we
tried different types of #litter.#

B.76:  #[Lipsmack] Really?#  Really. 

A.77:  Changed it #frequently# --

B.78:  #Huh?# 

A.79:  -- #and# --

B.80:  #Huh.#

A.81:  -- it was just unbelievable.

B.82:  Oh.

A.83:  And so we finally found someone else that was willing to, to, {pause} to
give it a try with #them.#

B.84:  #Uh-huh.#

A.85:  And, sure enough, it, it [noise] worked for a little while and then they,
too, couldn't seem to get them to use the litter #box.#

B.86:  #Really.#  Really.  Um [noise].

A.87:  Uh, so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a
#try# --

B.88:  #Yeah.#

A.89:  -- and that's when I lost track of these two cats.

B.90:  Really.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's too bad.

A.91:  Yeah, that was, that was pretty sad because, uh, it took a lot of lobbying
just to get the cats in the house [laughter] to begin #with.#

B.92:  #Sure.  Sure.#  #Sure.#

A.93:  #So, we sure# couldn't make another try at it.

B.94:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we were real fortunate with our pets.  Um, [lipsmack]
when my husband and I were getting married, we, we had both been married
before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families
course through, uh, T I S C, you know, how they have --

A.95:  Huh.

B.96:  -- the, effective parent, parent training --

A.97:  Right.

B.98:  -- effectiveness training.

A.99:  Right.

B.100:  And, uh, so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitts, the person
who was teaching the course said, sometimes when you have children on this
side and children on this side, you have a, you know, a mutual child that
brings the family together.  And we looked at each other and laughed and said
we'll get a dog #[laughter].#

A.101:  #[Laughter].#  Yeah, I bet. That's funny.

B.102:  And, uh, so w-, I had always wanted a Golden Retriever.  I just think
they're real neat dogs.  That's a nice breed, you know they're real calm and
gentle and, and [lipsmack] whatnot, so, my husband thought well, for Christmas
he was going to surprise me with a puppy.  And, he was looking around for a
puppy and then, um, he saw, he decided, just on a whim, I think I'll call the
S P C A.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  And he called the Dallas S P C A and he said you wouldn't happen to have a
Golden Retriever, would you?  And they said, you won't believe it but we had
one dropped off last night.

A.105:  Good grief. 

B.106:  And he'd, they said, he's A K C registered.  He's two years old and
he's going to go fast.

A.107:  I'll bet.  

B.108:  So, we thought, okay, what's wrong with this dog?  Who would give up a two
year old Golden Retriever, you know, that's,

A.109:  [Noise].

B.110:  a nice dog.

A.111:  #Yeah {very faintly}.#

B.112:  #Something's# got to be wrong with this dog [breathing].  Nothing is wrong
with it.  We have had him now for three years and just love him to death
#[laughter].#

A.113:  #That's great.#

B.114:  He is wonderful.

A.115:  [Noise].

B.116:  Yeah, he is.  He's a great dog.  He's, he's, he makes a,

A.117:  [Noise].

B.118:  real lousy, uh, watchdog, though, because he, he just loves everybody and
he wags his tail and you know, [laughter] he's, he's great.  He's great.  We
jus-, we think he's wonderful.  And our cat just kind of, you know, pays us
the time of day when he's in the mood and, otherwise, we don't see him
[laughter].

A.119:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Is it primarily outdoor cat #then or just,#
 
B.120:  #Yeah he is.#  He comes in and he goes out.

A.121:  #Yeah.#

B.122:  #He's,# he's kind of you know, is just around.  We, we don't really don't
see him except for feeding time, you know --

A.123:  #That's interesting.#

B.124:  -- #or when he wants,# when he's in the mood for a little affection
[laughter].

A.125:  He'll show up, huh.

B.126:  He'll show up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, so that's our family --

A.127:  #Uh-huh {very faintly}.#

B.128:  -- #and we just,# you know, uh, everybody seems to get along real well.
The kids,

A.129:  [Noise].

B.130:  the dog and the cat.  So, we're okay #[laughter].#

A.131:  #Great.#

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  Well, has the cat discovered the, uh, the hamsters #yet?#

B.134:  #The# hamsters?  Actually, it's the dog that is enthralled with the
hamsters --

A.135:  Oh.

B.136:  -- because the hamsters,

A.137:  [Noise].

B.138:  are recent.  You know, they were just last week.  And, [lipsmack] the first
night we had them, somebody knocked over the cage and we thought,

A.139:  [Noise]. 

B.140:  it was the cat.

A.141:  #Uh-huh.#

B.142:  #We really# did.  We blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had
disappeared and had been eaten but, we found him.  He, he just, he narrowly
escaped with his life but he was found.

A.143:  [Laughter].

B.144:  But since then, we have discovered, 

A.145:  [Noise].

B.146:  the dog sits and watches them for hours on end.

A.147:  Oh, #my goodness.#

B.148:  #You know they'll# get going in the little wheel and he'll sit, 

A.149:  [Noise]. 

B.150:  there and just stare at them.  So, I'm wondering now if it really was the
cat who knocked them off the shelf.  It might have been, it might have been
the dog.

A.151:  Yeah.

B.152:  But the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them.  It's, it's the dog
that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters.  It's,
it's funny.

A.153:  I'll be.

B.154:  Yeah.  #Yeah.#

A.155:  #And# my sister has tried that with both hamsters, gerbils, and s-, birds.

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  And, it's amazing what their cat has been able to do.

B.158:  Really?

A.159:  I think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those
small creatures.

B.160:  #Out.#

A.161:  #Eventually.#

B.162:  Really.

A.163:  To get them out. #To get# --

B.164:  #Yeah.#

A.165:  -- the cage down from wherever it is.  Even if it's the top of the
refrigerator.  

B.166:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.167:  To get that cage down and into it somehow.

B.168:  Yeah. Yeah.  

A.169:  [Noise].

B.170:  Well, we warned them, y-, 

A.171:  [Noise].

B.172:  the kids, you know.  We said, you know, with the cat in the house, you
know, these may [laughter] not last --

A.173:  [Laughter] #That's right.#

B.174:  -- #too long.#  But he doesn't seem to be bothered with them.

A.175:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.176:  You know, he's real content, you know, chasing flies and birds outside,
so, you know, he's, he's not too bad.

A.177:  Yeah.  

B.178:  But, so, are you going to try again with another cat sometime?

A.179:  Well, I would like to.  

B.180:  [Noise] #Yeah.#

A.181:  #We# shall see.  I want it to be a, you know, indoor outdoor animal next
time.  

B.182:  Yeah.   

A.183:  And, uh {voices fade},
