=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, we're on.  

B.2:  Okay.  Well, I just, on, on gun control I just always felt like that I
think, I don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before
they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that
person out.  Uh, I don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done
are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop, though.  I believe it's
probably bought across the market.  And I don't think gun control is going to
have any control over that at all.

A.3:  So, uh, you're, you're for no restrictions or,   

B.4:  Uh, sort of a, a little bit of restriction, maybe, I might say.  If a, if a
criminal should go, happen to go into a gun store, I don't think it would hurt
anybody to wait a week --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- to go back and pick up that gun -- 

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- so that they can check them out -- 

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  -- and if it is somebody like that, then, no, but I really think that most
of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy
them.  I think they get them from other means.

A.11:  I, what, what, what kind of means would those be?  

B.12:  Oh, I don't know, like from each other.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  You know, uh,   

A.15:  In other words, you're saying that it would be hard, uh, to get rid of all
of the guns.

B.16:  I think so.   

A.17:  Well, doesn't it, doesn't, doesn't London have a ban on firearms, England?

B.18:  Jeez, now, I don't know.  

A.19:  Yeah, don't they carry, don't their policemen over there carry these billy
clubs?

B.20:  That's right.  Nobody over there carries guns.  

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  I don't know, but you get away with guns completely, I guess. 

A.23:  Well, it would be nice, uh, uh, to be able to take your family out, uh,
especially whether they're depending on you and not worry about, uh, having to
have a gun just to protect yourself and them.

B.24:  That's right.  I agree with that.  I agree with that.  I, we do not own
one.  Uh [lipsmack], and I don't intend to buy one.  And I'm not a hunter.  I
guess those people feel a little bit different, but I don't believe in hunting
either so, 

A.25:  Well --

B.26:  You know.

A.27:  -- I have a couple of guns and, uh, one I always worry about somebody
getting ahold of it that, that, you know, won't know how to handle it.

B.28:  Right.  

A.29:  And, uh, probably never will do me any good because bullets are in one
place and the firearm is in another.

B.30:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.31:  And I carry one in the pickup, uh, and I worry about it being stolen.  And,
of course, I'm like you.  I don't like to kill things.

B.32:  No, I don't either.  

A.33:  So,  

B.34:  Well, it is terrible when you have ride down the street and think somebody
could just shoot at you for nothing, which has been in the news a lot lately.

A.35:  Oh, yeah.  

B.36:  You know.  

A.37:  And, and there's a,  

B.38:  No apparent reason.  

A.39:  The crazies are out there in numbers.  

B.40:  Right.  Right.  

A.41:  Well, you know, I would love to see a ban, uh, on firearms and I'd have to
rate myself as a number one.  However, I worry that, that, that the country,
if it ever get to that point.

B.42:  Huh.  

A.43:  And then I worry about, uh, the fact that, uh, what if there was some sort
of insurrection in this count-, in this country.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  Then, uh, how would we as citizens, uh, band together and ever put down an
uprising --

B.46:  Uprising.  

A.47:  -- if there were no firearms.  

B.48:  You think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms?

A.49:  I don't think we ever will.  

B.50:  I don't either.  That's the problem.  

A.51:  Yeah, so,   

B.52:  Not in this country.  

A.53:  Some-, somewhere along the line, then, uh, you know, there has to be a
happy medium --

B.54:  Right.  

A.55:  -- and, uh, I know the, the, uh, oh, what's the organization that, uh,
that, the rifles association,

B.56:  Oh, yes.  

A.57:  The, uh, the gun association is, is heavily for no bans whatsoever.

B.58:  Yeah.  Well, I think we ought to have some.  

A.59:  Yeah.  Well, I think so, too, so I'd have to vote for, uh, uh, maybe a five
and, uh, and hopefully, uh, we could put some sort of restriction on the
handling of firearms.

B.60:  Right.  I could go for that.  

A.61:  Like, like you suggested.  

B.62:  Yeah.  I think that would, I think that's the only way. 

A.63:  Okay, Betty, well, sounds good enough to me, then.  

B.64:  Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.  

A.65:  Well, same here, and, uh, one of these days that name's going to come back
to me.

B.66:  Oh, m-, me, too.  

A.67:  Okay [laughter].  

B.68:  Okay [laughter].  

A.69:  Bye-bye.  

B.70:  Bye-bye.
