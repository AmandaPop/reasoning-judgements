REMARKS:        There was a noise that sounded like a telephone ringing at
intermittent times, from Speaker A.

============================================================================

A.1:  What's the, uh, in Texas law has a, uh, {pause} [breathing]  what does it
have, it has a death penalty doesn't it?

B.2:  Oh, yes, yeah.  They just, uh, started it again, too just late, or, within
the past few years [breathing].  You know for quite some time, just about
every one of the states had given up the death penalty. 

A.3:  But now it's coming back into favor. 

B.4:  Uh, yes.  Well, they find it is more deterrent. 

A.5:  Well, my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent.
Uh, but now that's just what they said.  Uh, I don't know maybe, maybe if I
went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.

B.6:  Well, uh, if you,

A.7:  Maybe they've changed their minds. 

B.8:  You know, compare the figures, I think that's where they're, uh, they're
coming from.  The, uh,

A.9:  Maybe that's it.  Maybe that's it, because that was back in the seventies. 

B.10:  Oh, there yes.  They are.  That was before the, uh, uh, they adopted the
death law again [breathing].  But, uh, I, I myself am in favor of it, uh,
particularly for, uh, well I think Texas has a good, good law.  Uh, crimes,
murders related with, uh, drugs or killing a policemen.

A.11:  I think, I agree.  But I think it ought to be expanded to include children.
I, I think they're, they have they're working on, uh, something in Austin now,

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.13:  # and # I'm not sure what it is, I just remember seeing a, uh, kind of a
synopsis of it. 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  Well, why stop at children? Why not go to adults, too?

A.15:  Well, uh, I'm, I'm personally very in favor of it. 

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  Uh, why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees
after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t-, or tried to, or done
their very, you know, given their best effort at doing that. 

B.18:  Uh-huh.  Yep. 

A.19:  I, I don't care to support them. 

B.20:  Well, I don't either but, uh, uh, but there is something to be said about
{pause}, or, uh, uh, j-, just for the sake of argument, I'm taking the,

A.21:  # Sure.  #

B.22:  # a # con, I'm, I'm against it.  Uh, you know yourself how many times have
you heard where, uh, uh, a citizen was wrongfully arrested,

A.23:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh [breathing].  #

B.24:  # and served time # at a penitentiary, uh, just recently this, uh, black
man served nine years was it,

A.25:  # And then, #

B.26:  # for robbery.  #

A.27:  there was the black woman that, uh, robbed and shot the furrier.  And she
was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently. 

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  [Ringing] But she actually killed the furrier.  Or someone, she was charged
with murder [ringing] and then, then they decided it was a case of mistaken
identity or something.  I didn't, I don't, [ringing] I didn't retain all those
facts very well.  But I know what you're, what if we make a mistake.

B.30:  That's it. 

A.31:  And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and
reverse everything. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the
death penalty in effect, I don't think that, uh, [lipsmack]  they're going to
use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately.  I, like you, say yes let's have
it,

A.33:  # Well, #

B.34:  # put # them all, give them all a shot, get rid of them.  Why should they
be sit-, sitting in, uh, prison getting their college degree.

A.35:  Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on
the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was
my judgement the person's guilty.

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  Now that's tougher.  It's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone
agree that, yeah, the death penalty's the way to go, it's a deterrent to crime,
they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway.  But to be the
actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me. 

B.38:  Yes, very true.  I, uh, I agree with you there.  Uh,

A.39:  I think I'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if
we're not in the circumstance.  It, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing
to say that, oh, sure I would, but I don't know [noise].

B.40:  Uh-huh.  Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that.  Uh, I,
it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot to, uh, to expect of a person, to, uh, to
kill somebody is what it amounts to.

A.41:  Well, yes, but, you know, that's what they did. 

B.42:  It, true.  Very true.  But they, they did it because they have a warped
mind for some reason.

A.43:  Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever
they wanted. 

B.44:  Yeah well, uh,

A.45:  And they, they wanted something worse than they, more than they respect the
human life. 

B.46:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, exactly.  Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,

A.47:  # [Laughter].  #

B.48:  # that # it is,

A.49:  # Hang them.  #

B.50:  # it should # be in effect. 

A.51:  Yeah, I agree it should be in effect.  Also I agree there should be a lot
of care in the enforcement, uh, so I guess I would say I want it to be in
effect but I want {pause}, maybe well, I'd, I, now I have a problem with
this, too.  I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back
and get one more chance.

B.52:  Oh, that's true.  Well now any, uh, just believe in just about any state
in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an
automatic, uh, appeal.

A.53:  That's correct.  It is, [noise]  it is. 

B.54:  And, uh, uh, yes, I'm inclined to agree with you.  I think so, there should
be a limit as to the number of appeals. 

A.55:  Now, there's some, and maybe, now, [ringing]  I don't remember if this is
Texas or not, that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the
death sentence. 

B.56:  Um, um, well, n-,

A.57:  Convicted drug dealers. 

B.58:  Not just for dealing in drugs.  It, uh,

A.59:  Is it, what is, what's the ru-,

B.60:  There are certain circumstances, and I don't remember what they are. 

A.61:  It's something of the dis-, they're on the distribution end. 

B.62:  Uh, yes. 

A.63:  They're not selling them, they're distributing them.  It's for the large
dealers is what,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # it's # reserved for.  And they, they are in effect killing people. 

B.66:  Oh, oh, yes, yes.  I, I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs. 

A.67:  Oh, okay. 

B.68:  I think that's the way it's worded. 

A.69:  Is that how it's worded? I knew it was there but, I, I, or p-, or is it
proposed or is it passed?

B.70:  I do believe that's in.  Uh, I wouldn't swear to it myself. 

A.71:  I believe it is,

B.72:  But I thought it, I thought it was in effect. 

A.73:  I believe you're right, though.  I think it is.  And I have to agree with
that. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  I, I think it certainly should be one of the options.  Uh, I've been
fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so far that I know.  I qualify
that heavily,

B.76:  # [Laughter].  #

A.77:  # because # you never know, [breathing]  but to the best of my knowledge we
haven't had a major problem yet. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  But it just touches so many young people. 

B.80:  Oh, it does.  Uh, I have four sons myself [breathing],  and the youngest is
twenty-eight,

A.81:  # Um.  #

B.82:  # so # they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it, you
know, going through high school and everything [breathing] and knock wood
that, uh, they have not, well I won't say they didn't try it, uh, I wouldn't
know, but, uh, they, I doubt very much that they're, they're using it now.  In
fact I'm sure they don't.

A.83:  Well, my children are about in the same age bracket.  I think, let's see,
the oldest is thirty-two and the youngest is probably twenty-seven,
twenty-eight. 

B.84:  Huh. 

A.85:  So, it's the same age bracket. 

B.86:  Yes. 

A.87:  And there's four, two girls and two boys.  And I think one of each
experimented very slightly with pot,

B.88:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.89:  # and # I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge. 

B.90:  Yeah.  That's usually the way it is.  It, it's just, uh, try it out with
their peers [breathing].  And none of them even smoke.  They don't, uh, they
never, strangely enough, uh, their mother and I both smoked when they were
growing up.  Now, my, my, my wife, my ex-wife, she quit, uh, [breathing]  well,
when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again.  And I
just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago. 

A.91:  Boy, that's tough. 

B.92:  Yes, it is.  I, and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by. 

@@A.93:  My husband hasn't quit, yet.  And he knows he has to and he knows he
should and he knows and he knows,

B.94:  # Um.  #

A.95:  # but # he hasn't.  I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke
in the same room with me.  He, he's very conscious of, of passive smoking and
he's concerned about it but,

B.96:  # Well, #

A.97:  # hasn't # quite made it yet [breathing]. 

B.98:  Well, when I was still smoking, I, I felt that way.  If I was in a public
restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers I would try to pick a s-, a,
a my, seat where the smoke would blow away from them.  Or I'd hold the
cigarette under the table.

A.99:  Yeah, I've seen all of this, yeah [breathing]. 

B.100:  And, uh, but, uh, now I'm on, the shoe's on the other foot [breathing].
Uh, I'm aware of other people smoking now.

A.101:  Well, Charles will actually, Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house
except our own. 

B.102:  Um. 

A.103:  He will get up and he'll go outside, you know, and he, he's so, when we're
invited to people's house, he will not smoke in their house.  Which I think is
good because there's a lot of people that are very,

B.104:  # Yes.  #

A.105:  # particularly # if they have children. 

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  But, uh, and he's, you know, he tries his best, but the actual quitting he
hasn't done.  He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like.  He put up all of
his ash trays.  He will not smoke in a comfortable position, you know, but --

B.108:  Uh, uh-huh. 

A.109:  -- still [laughter], he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to
do except quit smoking [laughter].  It's a,

B.110:  # Well, the, #

A.111:  # long process.  #

B.112:  there's a trick I use.  They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove
compartment. 

A.113:  Oh, how neat. 

B.114:  And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one.  One at
a time.  And, uh, that, that's, gets to be, uh, a deterrent. 

A.115:  He has his in the kitchen,
