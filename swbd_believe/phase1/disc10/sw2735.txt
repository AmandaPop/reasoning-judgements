A.1:  Okay, Jean, uh, could you tell me what you, what you think about, uh, gun
control?

@B.2:  Well, I think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they
were kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have.

A.3:  As, as far as firearms go?  Or, 

B.4:  Pardon?  

A.5:  As far as firearms going, or is it just,

B.6:  Yes.  

A.7:  The, the,

B.8:  The gun, the gun control.  

A.9:  Gun controls.  Yeah, I'm not really all that sure on, on, uh, what the
federal regulations are, but it seems like each state has their own, or at
least that's what my belief is.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  is that each state has their own regulations.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  You know, some require, uh, uh, a permit, 

B.14:  Right.   

A.15:  and some don't.  Some require waiting periods, 

B.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.17:  and some don't.  Uh,

B.18:  We require permits like if you're going to carry a pistol for protection or
for whatever reason, you,

A.19:  Right, that's,

B.20:  you know, have, you to have a permit for that.  

A.21:  That's what it is up here.  

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  It's like that, too, you need, 

B.24:  Uh-huh.   

A.25:  uh, as far as a rifle or anything like that, 

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  no, you can just go out and buy it, uh,

B.28:  I, I just, I just don't feel that, uh, a stronger restrictions is going to
stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse.  I really don't
personally feel that it's going to help.

A.29:  No, unless it's a, like one of those automatic weapons.  

B.30:  Well, those we don't need [laughter].  

A.31:  You know, I can see, 

B.32:  [Throat_clearing].

A.33:  there are, uh, gun collectors that, you know, go out and collect all
these and there are people that go out and fire on ranges and things,

B.34:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.35:  Uh, if you want an automatic weapon just for that because you certainly,

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  don't need it going out hunting.  

B.38:  No, no, no.  

A.39:  Uh, then I think,

B.40:  Somebody's who's, into, into shooting, though, like you say sharpshooters,
or --

A.41:  Yep.  

B.42:  -- uh, that type of thing wouldn't be so bad.  

A.43:  I,

B.44:  But, uh,

A.45:  Yeah, I think that should be regulated.  

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  Those types of weapons, 

B.48:  Uh-huh.   

A.49:  as far as a pistol, anybody and, uh, and their uncle can get a pistol,

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  anytime they want.  

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  Uh,

B.54:  I don't think the laws are going to keep them from getting them if they
really want one.

A.55:  No, no.  What I,

B.56:  I just, I really don't believe that.  

A.57:  What I think should happen is, uh, any violent crime with a weapon, with a,
with a pistol, or, or a rifle for that matter --

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  -- I think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.

B.60:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  

A.61:  And that's, that's what they're not doing now.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  That's, I say if they would use the laws they have on the books, I
think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on.  But they're, I don't know,
it, it sometimes seems like they're too lenient with some things, but yet if a
guy steals a loaf of bread for their family, he's in worse trouble than they
are.

A.63:  Right, they crucify him.  

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  Uh, but, yeah, I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's the, judicial
system like the judges that are too lenient,

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  because there are precedents saying, you know, well, it's, 

B.68:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh.  

A.69:  he really didn't mean to do it, it was a fit of anger, 

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  or, or, uh, he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didn't
know what he was doing.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  Uh, I don't really buy that.  

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  I mean if he, if he drank too much, he knew he drank too much.

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  Or, or if he was on dope he knew he was, he was, what was going to happen
when he, when he took it.

B.78:  Yeah, it's kind of a cop out.  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  But, yet, I've seen some jury trials where the people feel sorry for the,
whoever did whatever they did.

B.82:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  

A.83:  And they, and they're lenient, they go lenient on them and then after they
sit there and I read the paper and I say, sh, you know,

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  Uh,

B.86:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people put themselves in the pl-, in the place of
the person that has done the crime and they think of how they would react and
then they don't think anybody could do the things that this person is accused
of doing.

A.87:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.88:  And I think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on, uh,

A.89:  You're probably right, uh, and a lot of cases, too, it is uh, in a fit of
anger,

B.90:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.91:  people do things that they regret for the rest of their life.

B.92:  Right, right.  

A.93:  But yet, there are also the others that commit crimes over and over and
over again,

B.94:  Right, right.

A.95:  and they're out on the street after a short sentence. 

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  Those are the ones that, 

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  you know, should get the book thrown at them.  I,  

B.100:  They should be kept there, and overcrowding, of course, that has a lot to
do with, I think a lot of times with, uh, the type of sentence that's given.

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  You know, what's available for keeping them [laughter].  What,

A.103:  What's, yeah.  Uh, I grew up in a rural area and we've always, we've always
hunted.  I've hunted for years,

B.104:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.105:  Until I got older and then I, I just hung my guns up, and I just kind of,

B.106:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.107:  you know.  I'd rather go out with a camera now, 

B.108:  [Laughter].   

A.109:  and shoot the animals.  

B.110:  I don't have a, my, my, my husband and my one boy, he hunted, uh, so,

A.111:  Yeah.  Well, we, we passed a, or the town passed an ordinance that it's,
against the law now to, to shoot a firearm off in the town.  And it's, it's
still a rural area, and it's still farms,

B.112:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.113:  and orchards, and, and we live right down by next to the reservoir,

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  so there's a lot of ducks and, 

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  you know, there's all kinds of wild animals, 

B.118:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.119:  and, and for years it was like a shooting gallery down there.

B.120:  Uh-huh.  Well, some people have no sense at all in shooting to know how
far to be away from buildings and that, to shoot, I mean,

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  some of them use no sense at all.  

A.123:  Yep, yeah.  Because we didn't, but a neighbor of ours had, uh, uh, a bullet
came, came through, right, right through the side of the house,

B.124:  Uh-huh.   

A.125:  and it,

B.126:  Well, we've had that happen in our area also, uh-huh.  

A.127:  Uh-huh.  So, but since they've done that, since they've limited hunting,

B.128:  Uh-huh.  

A.129:  it's been, uh, the birds are back, the animals are back, it's, uh, it's
peaceful.

B.130:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.131:  So our town got together,

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  so maybe, uh, communities have to do that if you,

B.134:  Well, I think it depends on the community.  Now we're rural also and our
houses are not [throat_clearing], they're not that close, like we have a
shooting range across the road from our home.  But it's far enough away if we
have fields around it and it's,

A.135:  It's a regular, oh,

B.136:  it's far enough away from, you know, houses and --

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  -- that type of thing that, uh,

A.139:  It's a, what is it, like a rod and gun club?  

B.140:  No, it's just our own personal,

A.141:  Oh, okay, so it's,

B.142:  We just have a, a personal lot.  

A.143:  It's for you.  

B.144:  Yeah.  

A.145:  Oh. 

B.146:  Yeah.  

A.147:  Okay.  

B.148:  Now we do have a sportsman's, uh, club who has a, an indoor shooting range.
And it's very nice.  Our, our one boy was a sharpshooter.  He was interested
in,

A.149:  Oh, isn't that good, yeah.  

B.150:  yeah, he was interested in that.  Then, uh, did a,

A.151:  So what is he, does he have to follow certain rules and regulations because
he's a, uh, sharpshooter or, 

B.152:  Uh, no, not really.  He doesn't do it now because he's not here.  He lives
in Pittsburgh now.  And so he, he really hasn't been doing too much shooting
lately.

A.153:  Yeah.  

B.154:  But he, 

A.155:  But,

B.156:  he really did enjoy it.  

A.157:  But he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place.

B.158:  Uh, [lipsmack] I don't think they had to have, not for shooting, not for
their rifles and that.  It would be just like, uh, going hunting.  You don't
need a permit to carry,

A.159:  Oh, okay, yeah, no.  

B.160:  you know, you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that.

A.161:  Right, yeah.  

B.162:  Uh,

A.163:  So you just need a hunting license.  

B.164:  No, no I don't think so.  Uh, the rifles that they use like in their, uh,
uh, R O T C.

A.165:  Oh, okay, yep.  

B.166:  Now I think they had to, I think they had to do a little bit more when they
use them.  They also had a club at the college here that he shot in and --

A.167:  Oh, okay.   

B.168:  -- they had a few more restrictions there [static].  

A.169:  Yeah, so he was probably following whatever the protocol was for the
military.

B.170:  Right, right, yeah.  

A.171:  Yeah.  So I kind of agree with you, then, that, uh, uh, the only, the only
thing I would like to see them regulate is, is the automatic weapons.

B.172:  Yeah, there's no, there's really no call for, for, that, that type of
weapon.

A.173:  But as far as everything else, uh, if they, if they followed the rules and
regulations and the laws that were already in place, I think that, uh, uh,
that would suffice.  We wouldn't have to go any further.

B.174:  Uh-huh.

A.175:  We wouldn't have to put more regulations out there.  

B.176:  Uh-huh.  Now the lady said they, she wanted us to rate from one to ten as
to how we felt on, a one being, uh,

A.177:  That's right.  A, a total ban -- 

B.178:  Yeah.  

A.179:  -- on, on,

B.180:  Ten, ten would be no regulations at all, let's see.  No, wait how was it?

A.181:  Yeah, right.  Ten was no, no restrictions whatsoever.  

B.182:  Okay.  

A.183:  And one being was, uh, uh, a total ban.  

B.184:  Yeah.  

A.185:  You know -- 

B.186:  Yeah.  

A.187:  -- or totally restrictive.  I kind of think, uh, uh, probably a six, I
would go with.

B.188:  I would go along with that.  

A.189:  Uh, that's,

B.190:  A happy medium, so to speak.  

A.191:  Yeah, I'd like to see them restrict just those, like I said before,

B.192:  Uh-huh.  

A.193:  those, uh, the automatic, 

B.194:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.195:  weapons.  But the rest of it I don't think, 

B.196:  Yeah.  

A.197:  they need anymore.  

B.198:  Yeah.  

A.199:  Okay, so I guess we kind of, we've solved that problem, right? [laughter].

B.200:  [Laughter] I don't know if we solved it but,

A.201:  [Laughter].  

B.202:  It is a problem, and it, unfortunately, uh, [throat_clearing] I'm not real
crazy about guns myself, but being from hunting families I tolerate them
[laughter].

A.203:  Yeah, yeah.   Well, that's,

B.204:  And I like, I like them to learn their safety rules and that.  And, and I
think that is good that they have to have a, uh, now here at least they have a
hunter's safety course that the, the young people have to take before they're
allowed to hunt.

A.205:  Have to take before they,

B.206:  Yes.  

A.207:  Oh, that's good.  

B.208:  Yes.  

A.209:  That is.

B.210:  They, they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt.

A.211:  Yeah, and any responsible person or any responsible hunter is going to, is
going to go through some kind of a course like that.

B.212:  Uh-huh.
