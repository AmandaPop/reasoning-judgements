A.1:  Okay.  Hi Norma. 

B.2:  Hi. 

A.3:  Have you taken anything back lately, uh, that you've bought?

B.4:  Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants. 

A.5:  # Well why? #

B.6:  # Shrubbery, that # were guaranteed and we had no problem with it. 

A.7:  Very good. 

B.8:  We got our mo-, got our money back. 

A.9:  Good.  Well wh-, do you think that, uh, consumer goods, goods are generally
getting better, or worse in quality?

B.10:  Well, {pause} I believe they're better. 

A.11:  I do too.  I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible
time, but I don't, I, I believe that they're better now, you know, wh-,

B.12:  I think so.  I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy.  Electrical
appliances I think are pretty good, r-, reliable. 

A.13:  however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my
car with sixty-three thousand miles on it.

B.14:  Right [laughter]. 

A.15:  [Laughter]  And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that
was only one year old went out at, uh, on one side. 

B.16:  Oh, did you return it?

A.17:  No, I had moved away. 

B.18:  No, uh-huh. 

A.19:  I had taken the first one back.  I didn't think that it heated well enough.
It never did get anything but just moderately warm, took it back and, uh, the
people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and I fell for it and,
uh, when I got this one it did, a lit-, it heated a little bit warmer and then
after one year it started heating only on one side.

B.20:  Huh, so either you or your husband can be warm but not both [laughter]. 

A.21:  [Laughter]  Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year. 

B.22:  Oh. 

A.23:  Now I figure th-, uh, anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an
iron that will last a long time, and one year of ironing only once a week is
not long enough for it to last.

B.24:  No, huh-uh.  Did they replace it?

A.25:  Well without even any question, but I think it was the store. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  Wal-Mart. 

B.28:  Wal-Mart, I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart. 

A.29:  Yes [laughter]. 

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  And, uh, well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes?

B.32:  I haven't bought any new clo-, well the last thing I bought was a dress
last Summer.  And the buttons turned on it ove-, over the winter.  The buttons
tarnished slightly and I have not gone back about it.

A.33:  That was poor quality, I think. 

B.34:  I think it is too, and it was an expensive dress. 

A.35:  I wondered if it weren't expensive,

B.36:  # Yes it was.  #

A.37:  # and they should # have put buttons on it that would last forever. 

B.38:  That's right, that's what I think too.  And one belt loop, the wo-, uh, you
know, like the chain link, chain belt loop --

A.39:  Yes. 

B.40:  -- half of it raveled out.  And that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress and
it was, I think, over a hundred dollars.

A.41:  You spent that much on your dresses?

B.42:  Yeah, I don't usually, but I did that one. 

A.43:  You're really divulging very personal information. 

B.44:  [Laughter]  But I think it should have been better than that, for that
money, is what I mean. 

A.45:  Oh, of course, I do too.  Well I believe that we've been talking about five
minutes. 

B.46:  [Breathing]  [laughter]  Okay, I think so. 

A.47:  And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you. 

B.48:  Good talking to you too, I've enjoyed it [laughter]. 

@@A.49:  You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on
it all the time.

B.50:  [Laughter]  Well, we'll be talking to you later. 

A.51:  Bye, bye. 

B.52:  Bye, bye.
