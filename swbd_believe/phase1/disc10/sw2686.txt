============================================================================
	
B.1:  So how do you keep abreast of the world's happenings? 

A.2:  [Noise] {sounds like radio or television} When I'm driving to work, I
listen to a radio station which is twenty-four hour news, and that's how I get
most of my stuff.  That gives me about, uh, thirty minutes, thirty-five
minutes each way, each day.  So that's about an hour, a-, an hour and ten
minutes worth of,

B.3:  What station's that?

A.4:  Uh, K R L D. 

B.5:  K R L D.  I listen to, uh, ninety point one, which is K E R A. 

A.6:  Yeah. 

B.7:  So, uh, that's the same way I do it.  I drive about thirty minutes to work,

A.8:  # Yeah.  #

B.9:  # twenty # minutes actually. 

A.10:  Uh {faintly}.

B.11:  I listen to that going and coming. 

A.12:  Uh, I usually watch the news at night time. 

B.13:  Uh-huh. 

A.14:  Because I, I'm, you know, I just got home and ready for dinner and all
that.  And by the time I get done with dinner it's already over.  And,

B.15:  What a deal. 

A.16:  Yeah. 

B.17:  Well, do you feel like you're kept abreast?

A.18:  Pretty much, yeah, because they have the, uh, the C B S, uh, world news on
the hour --

B.19:  Uh-huh. 

A.20:  -- on the radio, so I get all that stuff, then plus I get all the local
news.  Uh,

B.21:  Well, what do you think about the U S telling the Iraqis to get out of
their camp areas?

A.22:  Uh, what do you think? I don't know, that's pretty strange. 

B.23:  It's a, it's a different bold move.  I mean, we, still, regardless if we
won the war or not, it's still, uh, the country is Iraq.

A.24:  Yeah.  You know, I mean, uh, li-, like with regard to the Soviet Union,
we're telling the, uh, Soviets, you know, hey, if the Baltic States want to
separate, go ahead and let them separate, that'll be good. 

B.25:  Uh-huh. 

A.26:  You know, but what if the American south wanted to separate, like they
tried to do in the eighteen sixties? Would we be so forgiving and say, Oh,
sure, go ahead, form your own country.

B.27:  Exactly. 

A.28:  You know, I mean, uh, it seems kind of hyp-, hypocritical of us to,

B.29:  # Uh {faintly}. #

A.30:  # to tell # other countries to go ahead and let parts of their countries
separate off, you know, and Gorbachev,

B.31:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.32:  # he's # the one that has to keep his country together, which I can
understand, you know. 

B.33:  Yeah. 

A.34:  And the other countries that want to separate, they want to get away from
all that garbage, the Soviet Union. 

B.35:  Uh-huh. 

A.36:  I don't blame them either. 

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  It's not something,

B.39:  It's, it's an interesting, uh, kind of a catch twenty-two. 

A.40:  That's something they've got to work out for themselves.  We shouldn't be
involved in that, we shouldn't even be talking about it, you know. 

B.41:  That is, uh [/noise], 

A.42:  The government should just stay away from them people and just let them
figure out for themselves what they need to do. 

B.43:  It is a bit difficult. 

A.44:  Yeah.  Bush should not do anything.  But, as, as, y-, as for the rest of
the-, I don't, you know we get the paper on the weekend,

B.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.46:  # and # I'll, I'll flip through that, you know, once or twice, but not, w-,
wo-, won't read it cover to cover. 

B.47:  Uh-huh. 

A.48:  And, uh,

B.49:  Do you read T News at work?

A.50:  Yeah. 

B.51:  Yeah.  That's, uh, I used to read that all the time. 

A.52:  I do that all, every day.  So that's another way but that's mainly, you
know, that doesn't have like a whole lot, just a few things on there which,

B.53:  Uh-huh.  Did you notice what T I stock closed at today?

A.54:  Huh-uh. 

B.55:  I didn't either. 

A.56:  I didn't see it. 

B.57:  I hear it's forty-two though. 

A.58:  Is that right?

B.59:  Yeah. 

A.60:  Is that up?

B.61:  No, it well, a couple of weeks, probably about a week ago it was at
forty-seven. 

A.62:  Wow!

B.63:  But that was, uh, I believe because of the stockholders' meeting. 

A.64:  Should have sold [laughter]. 

B.65:  Yeah, exactly, exactly. 

A.66:  The building I was in, well e-, I guess you work for T I too. 

B.67:  Pardon me?

A.68:  I guess you work for T I too. 

B.69:  I did until December --

A.70:  Oh. 

B.71:  -- and, uh, that's how come I don't read T News anymore [laughter]. 

A.72:  Yeah.  You got surplused.  I got, I got surplused last year myself. 

B.73:  Did you?

A.74:  Yeah. 

B.75:  That's, that's great. 

A.76:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.77:  [Laughter]  Did you just find a, a place in another --

A.78:  Another organization, yeah. 

B.79:  -- another T I organization?

A.80:  They needed somebody just like me, whereas before I was not even doing what
I was supposed to have been doing.  But, uh, that's not --

B.81:  That,

A.82:  -- # that's not the topic I guess.  #

B.83:  # that's kind of interesting that they can, # you know, say get out of here
in one si-, and then the other side says, come on over here. 

A.84:  Yeah. 

B.85:  So that worked out pretty well for you?

A.86:  It did, quite a bit --

B.87:  I was talk-,

A.88:  -- # better.  #

B.89:  # talking to # a guy from Colorado Springs yesterday, who i-, implied or
inferred definitely that he has been surplused from up there. 

A.90:  Yeah. 

B.91:  And he didn't know what he wanted to do.  He's been with T I for fifteen
years. 

A.92:  Oh, gosh. 

B.93:  So it's, uh, and he's a nonexempt.  Uh, he doesn't know what he's going to
do. 

A.94:  Yeah. 

B.95:  They're just shutting down the whole plant up there. 

A.96:  Yeah.  It's going to be a tough time all around the country.  I mean,

B.97:  # Exactly.  #

A.98:  # you # look at the, [cough]  look in the paper and you see all the stuff
about, you know, layoffs here and layoffs there, and you think, Oh, man, what's
going to happen?

B.99:  Uh-huh. 

A.100:  You know, thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because
that'll at least bring some money to the area. 

B.101:  Right.  W-, who got the contract?

A.102:  General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing. 

B.103:  Uh, yeah, I always get mixed up who's their partners with that late-,
latest deal.

A.104:  Lockheed and Boeing on this. 

B.105:  Is it Lockheed and Boeing?

A.106:  Yeah, Lockheed.  I used to work for Lockheed, and at the time I was there
they were developing the prototype for the, uh, that fighter. 

B.107:  Uh-huh. 

A.108:  And so, it was pretty big stuff there then, now they've got the contract
for it.  So,

B.109:  So G D didn't get it.  Or is not associated. 

A.110:  Well they're, they're in partnership with, uh, Lockheed and --

B.111:  Oh,

A.112:  -- # Boeing.  #

B.113:  # they are? #

A.114:  Yeah.  It's, it's a threesome. 

B.115:  So it's, I thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that, uh,

A.116:  No, #McDonnell Douglas# --

B.117:  # Northrop? #

A.118:  -- lost out.  They lost the contract. 

B.119:  Okay. 

A.120:  They were in partnership with Northrop, and they lost the contract, and so,

B.121:  Yeah.  That'll be a biggie. 

A.122:  Yeah. 

B.123:  I wonder what they do with those planes now that they've made as, uh, test,
test planes?

A.124:  Probably sell them to somebody who wants to pay for them [laughter]. 

B.125:  Yeah. 

A.126:  I don't know. 

B.127:  Becomes a new corporate jet. 

A.128:  Yeah.  There you go. 

B.129:  There you go. 

A.130:  Old Jerry can use that. 

B.131:  Yeah, exactly,

A.132:  [Laughter]. 

B.133:  All righty.  Well, it's been good talking to you. 

A.134:  Yes, have a good day. 

B.135:  Okay, you too.  #Bye.# 

A.136:  #Bye.#
