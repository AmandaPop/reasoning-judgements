=======================================================================

A.1:  I was at the point I might have had it sitting there somewhere. 

B.2:  No, I well, can you hold up, let me, I've got a portable phone here, let me
just turn it on real quick. 

A.3:  Okay. 

B.4:  I can go over to where I think I might have it. 

A.5:  Okay. 

B.6:  Okay, let's see here.  I just. 

A.7:  It's, it's supposed to be on the instruction sheet.  But,

B.8:  # Yeah, Oh, yeah, here we go.  #

A.9:  # I didn't see one on mine.  #

B.10:  Let's see, uh, just a second.  Oh, it doesn't [laughter]. 

A.11:  Um. 

B.12:  Uh, gee, if I was at work, I could give you, I tell you what.  Call this
number in the, in a, during the day. 

A.13:  Okay. 

B.14:  Nine, nine, five, zero, three, two, seven. 

A.15:  Zero, three, two, seven, okay. 

B.16:  And the person who answers there will be able to help you. 

A.17:  Okay. 

B.18:  My wife happens to be a secretary in the, in the group that does this. 

A.19:  Oh, okay, okay. 

B.20:  [Laughter]. 

A.21:  That will work.  Okay, let me hit one now. 

@B.22:  Okay. 

A.23:  [Beep]  Okay, uh, in my community they are doing a lot as far as recycling
goes.  Uh, Waco is a pretty small city, and so a lot of the city people.  I
guess, they want, they take, they take care of the community.  More than, I
think a big city does, or they can,

B.24:  # Yeah.  #

A.25:  # because # they are smaller.  And so they are doing all kinds of recycling
projects.  And the school kids are doing all kinds of things and,

B.26:  # Yeah.  #

A.27:  # I'm # a, I'm a news reporter, and so I report on a lot of the recycling
things that they do.  And just last week they opened up a new recycling
center.  Uh, so now they have two, uh, in an adjoining community, uh, Hewett,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # They # are doing uh, curbside recycling. 

B.30:  Oh. 

A.31:  Which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into, but for some
cities it's very expensive. 

B.32:  Yeah.  Plano, just, uh, just started, just started a program where they uh,
they gave everybody big plastic garbage cans. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  And uh, what they are doing is on Thursday they pick up the regular
garbage,

A.35:  # Right.  #

B.36:  # and # the plastic garbage.  But, on Mondays,

A.37:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.38:  # uh, # if you leave the heavy special huge paper bags,

A.39:  # Right.  #

B.40:  # And # if you put your clippings in that,

A.41:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.42:  # they'll # pick that up on Monday. 

A.43:  Yeah, that's a form of the curbside. 

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  Yeah. 

B.46:  Yeah.  And, uh, if I understand it, they're, uh, they're planning to, uh,
start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in. 

A.47:  # Um.  #

B.48:  # to, # to recycle that as well. 

A.49:  Uh, I know even Wal-Mart Department Store, I don't if they do it there,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # they # have the recycling bin right outside the store. 

B.52:  Oh, wow. 

A.53:  And it's got glass, aluminum, plastic. 

B.54:  I know all, the, the grocery stores here have a, a bins when you walk in,
if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags.

A.55:  Right.  The plastic bags. 

B.56:  I think it's great.  Uh, I know the kids, uh, at school are being
indoctrinated into the whole idea. 

A.57:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.58:  I know my daughter came home the other night and, uh, she was all excited
because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your
local recycling center was. 

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  And she called it, and turns out the, the nearest one is in Garland. 

A.61:  Wow. 

B.62:  Which is about, I don't know forty-five minutes to an hour from here. 

A.63:  Do you recycle yourself at home?

B.64:  Yeah we, uh, in fact, I've got a car full of newspapers. 

A.65:  Uh-huh. 

B.66:  That we're trying to, uh, here's a sort of, I guess, a setback, uh, there
were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here. 

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  I went to all of them yesterday, and none of them had bins,

A.69:  # Uh.  #

B.70:  # for # the paper.  I don't know if they just discontinued it or. 

A.71:  It's kind of rough doing the newspaper, I understand, because they can't
recycle the, uh, I guess it's the sale papers that have the color on them. 

B.72:  Oh, yeah. 

A.73:  And so it's kind of hard for them to, I guess, uh, separate all that. 

B.74:  Yeah, I know we don't sort that out. 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I don't think anybody would. 

B.76:  Yeah. 

A.77:  You know, I don't think they put the colored paper on there. 

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  So, that should be pretty difficult.  I don't recycle myself.  I live, I'm
single and so, I guess, if I had a family. 

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  I'd probably be more aware. 

B.82:  Right. 

A.83:  Now that I am single.  But, uh,

B.84:  Right, I, I, you probably, uh, eat, uh, fast food type stuff. 

A.85:  Yeah, yeah, especially on my job.  I'm hardly ever home so. 

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  You know. 

B.88:  When I was single I was a reporter too. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  So, I can identify with you. 

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  Uh, I know that a lot of times that you're working double shifts and odd
hours. 

A.93:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.94:  And you just eat when you have something to eat. 

A.95:  You just go in and you don't know when you are coming out [laughter]. 

B.96:  Right [laughter]. 

A.97:  So. 

B.98:  So. 

A.99:  Let's see what else they are doing, uh, jeez, I'm all out of recycling
[laughter]. 

B.100:  Yeah, [laughter]  I know, uh, the Boy Scouts collect newspapers here,

A.101:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.102:  # And, # uh, in fact, the, the kids at the end of the block come by every
once in a while when they want extra money. 

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  They, they come by, uh, collecting aluminum cans. 

A.105:  Um. 

B.106:  Because, we have places that you can go.  Where the, the city has places we
can just dump the aluminum cans. 

A.107:  Right.  My mother, before all this recycling stuff started, I guess, well
not before it all started, but she would collect the cans and you go like in
front of the supermarkets or whatever, and you put the cans in this bin thing. 

B.108:  # Yeah.  #

A.109:  # And # it spits out money. 

B.110:  Yeah, yeah.  That's where these kids take the aluminum cans [laughter]. 

A.111:  Yeah, yeah.  That, that freaked me out when it first did that.  I thought
okay.

B.112:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.113:  We got like eight cents or something.  Yeah exactly.  At work, we do
recycling.  We have a little recycling our cans and bottles, and those go out. 

B.114:  Yeah, where, where I work, they just started a paper drive. 

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  In fact, everybody has two trash cans. 

A.117:  Um. 

B.118:  Uh, one is for your normal trash. 

A.119:  Uh-huh. 

B.120:  And one is just for paper.  And they, they had a big campaign for it and
there's a list of things that you are allowed to put in the paper bin. 

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  And uh, you know, and but they, they're pretty good about it.  You know,
you can have the staples in them and have the paper clips on them, and the
plastic windows.

A.123:  Wow. 

B.124:  They take care of all of that. 

A.125:  Wow. 

B.126:  But they don't want certain types of paper. 

A.127:  Right. 

B.128:  Uh, they don't want anything, you know, they don't want like you know,
transparencies,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # overheads, # you know.  They don't want any of that in there. 

A.131:  Just regular paper. 

B.132:  Right, they don't want the garbage from your, from your lunch in there. 

A.133:  Right [laughter]. 

B.134:  And, uh, even little, uh, this board outside the cafeteria,

A.135:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.136:  # it # shows, it's a picture of a tree with a, with a squirrel going up,
and it's like a, like a gauge.

A.137:  Uh-huh. 

B.138:  And the higher the squirrel goes up, the more trees you've saved. 

A.139:  Oh. 

B.140:  And it shows you how many thousands of trees have been saved,

A.141:  # So that, #

B.142:  # because of # the recycling program work. 

A.143:  So, that gives you kind of an incentive. 

B.144:  Right, right. 

A.145:  Well, that's great.  If you know, like a lot of things you pick up today,
almost everything says recyclable. 

B.146:  Right. 

A.147:  Or this is made from recyclables or something. 

B.148:  Right, right. 

A.149:  It's amazing, it really is. 

B.150:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.151:  It's amazing to me how fast, I'm sure recycling has been going on forever
and it's just, I guess, everyone is picking it up now. 

B.152:  Yeah. 

A.153:  You know, but it's just amazing to me how much it's come in the last year. 

B.154:  Yeah. 

A.155:  Since last Earth Day.  You know, everything, I mean everything is recycle,
recycle everywhere you go. 

B.156:  Yeah.  Right.  Well, I know when I was a kid, uh, which was quite a while
ago, uh, we used to collect newspapers and take them to, there's a, uh, I don't
know what it was, a plant.  It was a paper plant, I guess. 

A.157:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.158:  It was fairly close to where I lived in Richmond, Virginia. 

A.159:  Uh-huh. 

B.160:  And, uh, you'd, you could bring your papers in to sell them there. 

A.161:  Um. 

B.162:  I remember doing that when I was a kid. 

A.163:  I remember my mother used to take the coke bottles in and you get like,

B.164:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.165:  # ten cents # or something like that. 

B.166:  Right, that's right. 

A.167:  I guess that was a form of it.  But now it's just like, perpetrated into
the, into the, you know, society. 

B.168:  Right. 

A.169:  Like if you don't recycle, you feel, you feel almost, uh, I don't know
like you're doing something wrong, or you feel guilty almost.

B.170:  That's right.  Well, that's good, I mean we're such a, we're such a
throwaway society. 

A.171:  Yeah, wasteful people.  Uh-huh. 

B.172:  It's, uh, it's nice, because you know, if you talk to people who grew up
during the depression. 

A.173:  Uh-huh. 

B.174:  Nothing was wasted. 

A.175:  Yeah. 

B.176:  I mean everything and nowadays, it's like you know, nobody darns their
socks.  I mean,

A.177:  # Yeah.  #

B.178:  # if # you get a hole in it, you just throw it away. 

A.179:  You throw it away, that's it. 

B.180:  And, uh,

A.181:  We're spoiled. 

B.182:  Yeah, you know.  I guess, I believe the propaganda, if you want to call it
that, that the, uh, you know, we're, we have, we have limited resources, and
uh, we really should think about conserving them instead of wasting them.

A.183:  Right, I know, I'm doing.  The beat I'm covering now is about our landfill
here. 

B.184:  Uh-huh. 

A.185:  And, uh, what was it, I think twenty-four million tons of garbage that we
throw away. 

B.186:  Wow. 

A.187:  Every, America could be recycled. 

B.188:  Wow. 

A.189:  Like twenty-four million. 

B.190:  That's a shame. 

A.191:  And I think that accounts for, uh, I think, one quarter or half of the
landfill space. 

B.192:  Wow. 

A.193:  So I mean, I just learn all these little propaganda things. 

B.194:  Yeah.  You know, I mean it would be nice if you could, if the landfill
space was reusable.

A.195:  Oh, yeah. 

B.196:  It isn't all.  It isn't all.  I know sometimes it is. 

A.197:  Not at all. 

B.198:  I know this place called Mount Trashmore,

A.199:  # Um.  #

B.200:  # which # is a park, they built on top of a landfill. 

A.201:  Um. 

B.202:  And I can't remember where it is.  I think it's in Washington D C or
thereabouts. 

A.203:  Mount Trashmore, huh?

B.204:  Yeah. 

A.205:  I never heard of that one [laughter]. 

B.206:  But, uh. 

A.207:  That's like the big stink around here.  This landfill thing.  They are
wanting to expand it, and a lot of the people that live around the area, don't
want it expanded. 

B.208:  Yeah. 

A.209:  Because, you know, they say it, uh, uh, it poison their water, and you know
poison the air.  And there's an elementary school right across the street, and
all kinds of stuff. 

B.210:  Yeah. 

A.211:  So it's a pretty big issue. 

B.212:  Yeah, I, I guess uh, you know, the scary part is that you don't know what
the effects are, you know fifty years from that. 

A.213:  Exactly. 

B.214:  You know it's easy to say, well, we'll build a concrete hole and, and
nothing will happen,

A.215:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.216:  # and # so the only way to test that is over a,

A.217:  # Right.  #

B.218:  # long # period of time.  And, so. 

A.219:  That's what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now,

B.220:  # Right.  #

A.221:  # but, # they are looking in the long run. 

B.222:  Right. 

A.223:  And they are saying, Well, forty years from now we'll,

B.224:  And there is no way to measure that. 

A.225:  Yeah. 

B.226:  The only way is to take the chance. 

A.227:  Uh-huh. 

B.228:  And see what happens forty years from now.  And who knows what kind of
havoc you've created.

A.229:  People don't want to wait. 

B.230:  No.
