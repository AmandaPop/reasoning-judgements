===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. 

A.2:  Anyway, so what have, what have you been into? Did you watch L A LAW last
night?

B.3:  Uh, no, actually I, I don't.  I, I don't, uh, it's funny. 

A.4:  [Beep]. 

B.5:  I don't really seem to watch a lot of television.  What, um, I usually like
to pick up on T V are some of the news type of shows like, you know,
TWENTY-TWENTY,

A.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.7:  # SIXTY # MINUTES.  Um, unfortunately, a [laughter] couple of weekly soaps
like KNOTS LANDING and, uh, DALLAS we watch [/laughter].  And, uh, and I,
usually, uh, I just other than those I, I catch movies once in a while.  I
like a lot of the movies that are, you know, true stories, true to life, that
type of thing.

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  Um, but I'm not, I'm not real big on, that much on television.  Uh, I don't
have really many favorite shows that I, I must see every week [laughter] you
--

A.10:  #Yeah.# 

B.11:  -- #know.# Uh, part of that I think is, uh, I have two boys, and, you know,
usually I don't get to sit down [laughter] to #watch the,#

A.12:  #They, they,# they get first crack, huh?

B.13:  Yeah, yeah, so, uh, anyway, um, but how about you then?

A.14:  Well, I usually, I guess, a lot of the sitcoms. 

B.15:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.16:  #COSBY,# CHEERS, uh,

B.17:  Well, I find I do sit down with them when they have those.  Tho-, they like
a lot of those,

A.18:  # Uh {faintly}. #

B.19:  # uh, shows, # and often when they have them on,

A.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.21:  # that's # when they're quiet [laughter]. 

A.22:  Yeah.  A DI-,

B.23:  #I like sit,#

A.24:  #A DIFFERENT WORLD.#

B.25:  sit down with them and watch it, yeah. 

A.26:  A DIFFERENT WORLD. 

B.27:  Yeah. 

A.28:  What else did I get in, uh? Uh, but some of the other ones, like I've been
getting into L A LAW and, uh,

B.29:  Uh-huh.  Do you watch, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING?

A.30:  No, I don't make a point.  I, I guess --

B.31:  Yeah. 

A.32:  -- I really never make a point to, to watch anything.  I'll just end up
catching it.  But, uh,

B.33:  So you catch whatever might #be#  --

A.34:  #Yeah,#

B.35:  -- #on if you're#  --

A.36:  #you know, if I'm not doing#  --

B.37:  -- #interested that evening.# 

A.38:  -- #that night, uh,#

B.39:  #Yeah.#

A.40:  #you know.#  Which I guess is usually most nights.  No [laughter]. 

B.41:  Uh-huh. 

A.42:  #But, uh,#

B.43:  #Yeah, yeah.# 

A.44:  #Oh,# --

B.45:  #Uh,#

A.46:  -- speaking of TWENTY-TWENTY, you didn't see the one in with the exorc-,
exorcists?

B.47:  Um, [noise] {sounds like a drawer being pulled out} I, you know I wanted to
and I forge-, I really, I kept seeing it advertised.  And I wanted to see
that.  And, I don't know, we might not have been home or something [noise]
{Sounds like a burp}. Excuse me.  And I didn't see that, but I was really
interested in, in that.  I, I found that a pretty interesting story that they
said the church recognized that as, as a real exorcism.

A.48:  Uh-huh. 

B.49:  Uh, did you see that show?

A.50:  Yeah, I did. 

B.51:  And what, what did you think? What did they, what, uh, was that all about?

A.52:  Oh, well the girl that supposedly was possessed, uh, had actually, uh, you
know, seen, uh, you know, s-, uh, some medical, the medical p-, side.  I don't
know if it was a psychologist or --

B.53:  Uh-huh. 

A.54:  -- what all.  But, um, you know, it was in-,

B.55:  [Sniffing]. 

A.56:  in-, it's interesting, uh, and, uh, you know, I'm from, you know, I'm was
raised Catholic fairly, you know,

B.57:  #Yeah.  My husband is too.#

A.58:  #fair-, fairly strong with my mom and dad,# so,

B.59:  Yeah. 

A.60:  But it, you know, that's kind of interesting, um.  But the bottom line, it,
you know, they did the exorcism.  It wasn't real major.  You know, s-, she was
fairly, you know, sh-, you know, obviously there, she, you know, she, something
was wrong with her [laughter]. 

B.61:  Uh-huh. 

A.62:  But,

B.63:  # [Laughter].  #

A.64:  # uh, # it wasn't really, uh, you know, extraordinary as far as her
actions.  And she had done that and she felt like that helped her. 

B.65:  Um. 

A.66:  But at the same time, shortly after that exorcism, they also started, um,
um, uh, giving her medication --

B.67:  Oh. 

A.68:  -- for like a split personality type s-, of,

B.69:  Okay. 

A.70:  So, uh, she's doing better, but, and, and the girl herself, you know,
believes that it, you know, that she was, uh, you know, possessed.  But,

B.71:  # Um.  #

A.72:  # and # you know, it, it's --

B.73:  It could be a mul-,

A.74:  -- # hard to say.  #

B.75:  # like one of these # multiple personality disorders --

A.76:  Yeah.  I'm n-, #I'm#  --

B.77:  -- #also.# 

A.78:  -- not sure.  You know, #who knows?#

B.79:  #Yeah.# 

A.80:  But, uh, anyway it wasn't,

B.81:  # Huh.  #

A.82:  # uh, # you know, it was, uh, it was, you know,

B.83:  It wasn't as dramatic as, I guess maybe they made it seem [laughter]. 

A.84:  Well, I, I can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that, that it's
pretty unusual for something like that --

B.85:  Right. 

A.86:  -- to be nationally televised.  Uh, or,

B.87:  #And, well,#

A.88:  #or have anybody# come in, you know, who, who would want to have that
televised,

B.89:  # Right.  #

A.90:  # you # know, if that was happening to your daughter?

B.91:  #Right.# 

A.92:  #And#  #her parents#  --

B.93:  #And also,#

A.94:  -- are right there, you know,

B.95:  # Yeah.  #

A.96:  # doing # it all, you know.  [laughter]  So,

B.97:  Um.  And also for the church to recognize it as a, a true exorcism, you
know.  Um, usually they're such, I think, I really think that there's a fine
line between what, um, [swallowing]  you know, a lot of people think is
possessed and what are really mental disorders, you know. 

A.98:  Um. 

B.99:  And maybe in the old days, you know, many years ago, what they often said,
oh, people were possessed, we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or
something.

A.100:  Uh-huh. 

B.101:  Um, and, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to, to say, you know, whether
it's, it's just a, it's a mental disorder or it's really, uh, uh, [child] it's
a, or if it's a split personality or something.

A.102:  Yeah. 

B.103:  {Appears to be speaking to child} Wait, honey I can't talk right now.  {Now
speaking to caller} Uh, but, um, what, I don't know, now what area are you
living in? {child talking in background, says Excuse me but},

A.104:  I'm in Phoenix, Arizona right now. 

B.105:  Oh.  {Speaking to child} Wait, Jackie.  What? {Child talking says Mom ((
)).  Speaker talking to child} Yes, okay, okay, go.  [laughter] {Now speaking
again to caller} Excuse me.  So,

A.106:  Are you in Dallas?

B.107:  Uh, no, we are, uh, outside of Washington,

A.108:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.109:  # D C.  # And I was just, the reason I asked that, I was curious. 
[barking]  [noise]  I thought maybe in different parts of, uh, you know, the
country, maybe there were certain shows that were more, more popular than in
other parts.  And I know in this area, it's, I don't know, D C is, especially
the newer areas, are really known for having so many yuppies,

A.110:  # Yeah.  #

B.111:  # you # know, [laughter]  And a lot of them are into THIRTYSOMETHING and,

A.112:  # Yeah.  #

B.113:  # you # know [sniffing].  Uh, I don't know some of the other shows they
watch.  Um, TWIN PEAKS [laughter], 

A.114:  # Yeah.  #

B.115:  # you # know.  And I'm not really into those shows. 

A.116:  # Yeah.  #

B.117:  # And # that really --

A.118:  I, I never got, caught up in # TW-, TWIN PEAKS either.  So,#

B.119:  -- #surprises people.# Yeah, yeah.  And I just, I was just wondering
demographically if, you know, if different parts, if there were shows that
were more popular than in other areas.

A.120:  Yeah. 

B.121:  I don't know like where you live, um, you know, what are the real, what are
the hot shows, you know, that everybody seems to want to watch?

A.122:  [Sigh]  Uh, I don't know.  I don't hear people talk at work, you know,

B.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.124:  # as # far as, uh, you know, what, what people are getting into.  But, uh,
um, you know, some of the top sitcoms obviously do, you know, always in the top
five.  You --

B.125:  [Swallowing]  Yeah. 

A.126:  -- know, the COSBY or I think A DIFFERENT WORLD is real strong and,

B.127:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.128:  # uh, #

B.129:  Now that's funny, see I haven't even heard --

A.130:  {Stutters} Well, that's the one,

B.131:  -- # of that show [laughter].  That's just, #

A.132:  # it's the one right after COSBY and # it's produced by Cosby.  And it's
about,

B.133:  # Oh, is that right? So, #

A.134:  # it's basically about, uh, college, # uh,

B.135:  # Oh, okay.  #

A.136:  # you know.  # And it, it, obv-, it's, you know, s-, since it's kind of
promoted by Cosby, it's, you know, mostly blacks. 

B.137:  I see, uh-huh. 

A.138:  But, uh, but it's, it's a pretty good show.  It, uh,

B.139:  And are all #the kids#  --

A.140:  #Have you ever#  --

B.141:  -- #into the SIMPSONS?#

A.142:  -- #heard of Jasmine Guy?#

B.143:  Pardon me.  Uh, yes. 

A.144:  Okay, now she's one of the main stars of that, and now she's just come out,
came out with an album. 

B.145:  Oh, okay. 

A.146:  And, uh, and which is fairly successful.  She's got one or two singles that
have done very well, so, but --

B.147:  Uh-huh. 

A.148:  -- she is a very strong personality in that show, uh, and, uh,

B.149:  I see. 

A.150:  It's #your#  --

B.151:  #And, uh,#

A.152:  -- basic college and what people run into.  And, th-, in fact they just had
a show covering AIDS (( )). So, you know, they --

B.153:  Oh, is that right?

A.154:  -- try to get their messages across ((I should say)).

B.155:  [Talking] Yeah, now there's a new show on, and I can't think of the name of
it.  Apparently the producer of it was a Potomac resident, um, you know, which
is right, right around here close to where we, we are living, you know, the
Potomac --

A.156:  Uh-huh. 

B.157:  -- area outside of D C.  And, and I, I think he went to like Wooton High
School here or something.  And, and some of the papers that circulating the
rumor [noise] that this show is based upon stories that actually happened at
Wooton High [laughter] where he went.  And that's, and he s-, denies some of
it, you know, um.  I, oh, eh, eh, I, eh, it might be the Beverly Hills, um,
there's that one called BEVERLY HILLS ONE OH TWO ONE OH, or something like
that,

A.158:  Um, not sure. 

B.159:  Uh, [swallowing]  and, uh, that's becoming a little popular.  And of course
the kids all like the SIMPSONS --

A.160:  Yeah. 

B.161:  -- here.  And, uh, I guess it's the same there [laughter]  also. 

A.162:  Yeah.  Uh, that one is, is it still competing with COSBY?

B.163:  Um.  I'm not sure.  I don't know what's happened.  Uh, I know a lot of,
some of the parents won't let their kids watch it, [laughter] you know.

A.164:  Such a brat? [laughter]. 

B.165:  Uh, yeah.  But, um, it, what, what, uh, what changes would you like to see?
I mean in, in, in, you know, evening television? Do you think there should be
more like news type programs like TWENTY-TWENTY or more comedies --

A.166:  Honestly?

B.167:  -- or weeklies?

A.168:  I'm indifferent [laughter].  #I probably, I probably,#

B.169:  #You're indifferent.  It doesn't ma-,#

A.170:  will watch a little bit of #everything.  Uh, I, I,#

B.171:  # Yeah [noise].  #

A.172:  I, I get into movies, I'll, uh, I'll see, you know, I'll watch
TWENTY-TWENTY or I'll,

B.173:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.174:  # uh, # you know, I guess I'm only, mostly into sitcoms.  I guess my f-,
you know, one show I'm really into is ARSENIO HALL.  (( )) [noise].

B.175:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  I watch that, uh-huh. 

A.176:  And, uh, and then, you know, I've been watching him for a long time now and
I, I needed a break.  And I watched JOHNNY CARSON last night.  A little more
level, you know, [laughter]  and so --

B.177:  Yeah. 

A.178:  -- it's like, I'm just think, Oh, what do I feel like today?, you know,
we're getting op-, our options on different talk shows.  And I always liked
watching LETTERMAN, but he starts so late. 

B.179:  You, so you like some of these late shows?

A.180:  Yeah.  Well, the, the talk shows,

B.181:  # Yeah.  #

A.182:  # with # the personality.  Yeah.  And, uh,

B.183:  Yeah, talk shows, yeah. 

A.184:  But, uh,

B.185:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.186:  # LETTERMAN # starts pretty late out here, about twelve o'clock. 

B.187:  Right. 

A.188:  But I'll still watch it #once in a while.# 

B.189:  #Oh, oh, okay.#  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I guess so, I think also probably because
people now, there are so many, uh, [sigh]  everybody has V C R's and rents so
many [laughter], 

A.190:  # Yeah.  #

B.191:  # movies.  # That might have, I don't know, that might have hurt some of
the, the popularity of certain shows, you know.  A lot of things that they put
on Saturday nights a lot of people,
