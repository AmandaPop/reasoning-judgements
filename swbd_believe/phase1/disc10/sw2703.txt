=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [static]. 

B.2:  Okay [static]. 

A.3:  Um, well, I'm not, I mean, I read a lot, but I don't, I don't read a whole,
I mean, {stutters} uh, eh, eh, eh, I, I, I, I tend to read like only out of a
couple, you know, groups. 

B.4:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.5:  Uh, and I'm, a, uh, I'm a big baseball fan, so I tend to read a lot of the
baseball books and,

B.6:  I'm a big baseball fan too. 

A.7:  Oh, okay. 

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  And, uh, I read a lot of science fiction. 

B.10:  E-, well, I like, I teach school, and so during the school year, I just
don't have time to read.  And I, you know, I would love to, to be able to read
more because I, I enjoy it so much.  But with correcting papers and, and I, two
o-, kids of my own, I just don't have time.  But in the summer, I try to read a
lot. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  And, and, of course, being a woman, I like romance novels and stuff like
that a whole lot.  I just, I really enjoy that because it's kind of a, a
getaway type thing.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  So I, I read a lot of that.  But I also love sports.  And, uh, uh, I, I
don't have time to read in, but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED --

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  -- i-, during the, the year because my son gets that.  And, uh, but, uh, I
don't read a lot of nonfiction, and I really should because there's so many
self-improvement books out right now that would, would be, benefit me greatly,
but I just don't. 

A.17:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, I, um, I don't really, I pro-, [laughter] probably
should.  I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that.
I, uh, um, I'll get like, uh, books on history and stuff like that that look
interesting.  And I, uh, of course, I don't ever get around to reading them
[laughter].

B.18:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.19:  You know, I got, uh, um, I b-, I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club. 

B.20:  Oh, do you?

A.21:  And I'll get, get stuff out of that.  Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, you
know,

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # like # a couple of years ago.  And I started reading, and got about sixty
pages into it and it's like eight hundred pages [laughter]. 

B.24:  Oh, my word. 

A.25:  And it was like, uh, I want to read something else for a while [laughter]. 

B.26:  Yeah.  It's, i-, some of those books are real tough to get into, but after
you get into them, they're really good. 

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so. 

A.29:  Yeah.  Well, especially, you know, well, BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off,
you know, in the eighteen forties, you know. 

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  And it's like, wait, the war wasn't until the eightee-, you know.  It's
like, okay, and I realize these things, you know.  These things take awhile
like to move up, but it's, you know, it's hard sometimes.

B.32:  It's right, that's right.  I find though, that if, when I find an author,
uh, and you don't read a lot of fiction, you said.  #But when I find,#

A.33:  #I read a lot of science fiction.# 

B.34:  Do you?

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. 

A.37:  Yeah.  That, and I, I do the same thing.  I,

B.38:  Because you, you get used to their style and you really enjoy it. 

A.39:  Yeah.  Uh, there's one science fiction writer named, uh, Allen Dean Foster.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  I've heard of him. 

A.41:  Oh, okay, yeah.  He, um, I must have like fifty or sixty books by him
[laughter]. 

B.42:  Is that right?

A.43:  I mean, I have, you know, I have everything he's ever well, almost
everything he's ever done. 

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  And, um, you know, I, I know that when I, you know, when I get his book
I'm, I'm usually going to enjoy it.

B.46:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.47:  Um, so it's really, you know, it's, it's fun to, to do that.  Uh,

B.48:  Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books [laughter]  about
science fiction? I think that's unbelievable. 

A.49:  Yeah.  Well, he does a lot of like, um, uh, movie adaptations and things
like that. 

B.50:  Oh, does he really?

A.51:  Yeah.  And, uh, his adaptations are usually really good. 

B.52:  Oh {faintly}.

A.53:  Um, it's, it's funny he, um, the, the novelization of STAR WARS was list-,
you know, it, it was out in the, uh, in the stores as being by George Lucas. 
But it turns out that, uh, Foster actually, uh, ghost wrote it for him. 

B.54:  Is that right?

A.55:  Wh-, which, you know, when I read it, I should have realized that because,
I mean, it had Foster's style written all over it [laughter].

B.56:  Is that right?

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, I've never read anything of his, but I've heard about
him.  But wouldn't you think he would, does he get some royalties from that,
#hopefully?#

A.59:  #Oh, I'm sure he#  does [laughter]. 

B.60:  Well, I would think he would [laughter]. 

A.61:  I'd hope so.  Well, I mean he's doing all right, probably [laughter].

B.62:  Oh, I'm sure he is, I'm sure he is.  But sometimes the more you get the
more you want too, so,

A.63:  Yeah.  That's true. 

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  Well, yeah.  You, you're a baseball fan, you're, you're aware of that kind
of thing [laughter]. 

B.66:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right, right, [laughter]  right.  I, in fact, I'm a sports
fan, period. 

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  We, I mean, th-, that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much
because there's everything in it. 

A.69:  Yeah.  I had a, uh, had a subscription to that last year, but I'm, uh, I'm
mostly a baseball fan.  So I'm,

B.70:  # Oh.  #

A.71:  # I'm # not, as inter-, you know, the other stuff is interesting but, um, I
was mostly interested in the baseball stuff. 

B.72:  So you're probably, uh, a Baltimore fan, right, an Oriole fan?

A.73:  Uh, actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything. 

B.74:  Is that right?

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  Boston? Oh, well, that's good too. 

A.77:  Um, but, uh, I, I, I do like the Orioles also. 

B.78:  I'm, I'm sure you do.  Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here. 

A.79:  Yeah {faint}.

B.80:  But I, I was, uh, I'm not from here.  I'm originally from Ohio, so I've
always followed the Tigers.  Because, you know, I was,

A.81:  #Toledo.#

B.82:  #I was#  born and raised in Toledo.  #Yeah.# 

A.83:  #I was#  in Toledo last summer.  Went to a, uh, to a Mud Hens double header
[laughter]. 

B.84: Oh, I love the Mud Hens [laughter].  They're great.  I love the
name #and, there#

A.85:  #Yeah.#

B.86:  was a b-, really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
last year. 

A.87:  Y-. I saved that issue, actually. 

B.88:  Did you?

A.89:  Um, that's when I had the subscription. 

B.90:  (( )).

A.91:  Yeah, it was a lot of fun. 

B.92:  Yeah.  I li-, I really enjoy that team.  I, we used to go there all the
time.  I used to live in Iowa too, and they have the Iowa Oaks.  And we used to
go, [laughter]  go to their games all the time.  And,

A.93:  They don't exist anymore, I don't,

B.94:  #I know,#

A.95:  #think.#

B.96:  #I know they don't.# 

A.97:  #At least not by that name.#  There's the Iowa Cubs, but I don't know if
they play,

B.98:  # Oh, they must, #

A.99:  # in the same # location. 

B.100:  they must have changed then.  Because it used, well I haven't lived there
for l-, I've been here for like twelve years now, so.  And I haven't been back
to Des Moines in a long time.  But --

A.101:  Um. 

B.102:  -- we used to always go to their games, and it was kind of fun.  It's
almost, uh, more fun than going to a major league game.  I don't know, I just
really enjoy #the,#

A.103:  #I,# #minor league,#

B.104:  #farm teams.# 

A.105:  baseball, I think [laughter]  is a lot more fun than,

B.106:  # Yes, #

A.107:  # major # league baseball. 

B.108:  it is.  It's not quite so serious, you know. 

A.109:  And it's a lot cheaper [laughter]. 

B.110:  That's for sure, that's,

A.111:  Yeah.  There's, um,

B.112:  for sure. 

A.113:  there's a city just west of Freder-, of, uh Baltimore, called Frederick. 
It's about --

B.114:  Is that right?

A.115:  -- forty miles west.  And they have a minor league team.  And I go out
there almost as much as the Orioles and, um,

B.116:  # Is that right? #

A.117:  # I, it's just # a lot of fun.  I mean, it's free parking and three bu-,
bu-, you know, four bucks now to get in.  And, you know, the hot dogs are a
dollar and, and it's #just great.# 

B.118:  #Well, how,# like how much is an Oriole game?

A.119:  Oriole game? If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium,
it's four bucks.  The ticket, the ch-, the cheapest ticket you can normally
get is like six fifty to seven fifty.

B.120:  Oh, gosh.  See, it's higher than the Rangers. 

A.121:  Yeah.  And, um, hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty [laughter]. 

B.122:  Oh, yeah.  A-, the food here is outrageous.  But, uh, you can get a good
seat for, uh, well it used to be three dollars.  But I think it's gone up to
fo-, four dollars this year. 

A.123:  Oh, that's nice. 

B.124:  But, you know, it's in the bleachers, way out in the, you know, in center
field, but it's still nice. 

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  You still can see well.  And, uh, we usually sit there unless somebody
gives [laughter] us tickets, you know, box seats --

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  -- or something, then we usually sit out there. 

A.129:  Well how much are the box seats there? Do you know #offhand?#

B.130:  #Box seats#  run from, oh, like eight dollars to twelve dollars. 

A.131:  Yeah.  That's, um, that's a little steeper.  I think the, uh, most
expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks.  But we're getting a new stadium
next year so,

B.132:  Oh, so it'll go up. 

A.133:  Yeah, it'll go up.  And, if it opens [laughter].  It's, uh, something we're
really irritated about around here.  Or some people are really irritated
about.  They're, they're building this new sta-, they built the new stadium
downtown.  And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for
the stadium.

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  But I park for free up at, at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can
do it for free [laughter].

B.136:  Oh, oh. 

A.137:  And, um, I'm not going to be able to do that downtown [laughter]. 

B.138:  Uh, that's, yeah, that's a bummer. 

A.139:  Yeah.  We,

B.140:  Well, see, baseball here though is the cheapest game in town.  Because the
Cowboys, it's out-, it's outrageous --

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  -- to go to the Cowboy game.  And the Mavericks are t-, it's high too. 

A.143:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.144:  # So # baseball's cheap,

A.145:  # Weren't you guys, #

B.146:  # compared to other # games. 

A.147:  supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas?

B.148:  Well, that didn't go s-, over,

A.149:  Oh, it d-, it didn't,

B.150:  # now.  They, they, #

A.151:  #go through.# 

B.152:  they decided, you know, George Bush, who, who's the main owner of the
Rangers, decided that, uh, they'd stay in Arlington.  So Arlington's going to
build a stadium, a bigger one. 

A.153:  Oh, okay. 

B.154:  So we're going to, they're going to stay there.  Which is fine, because
Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.  And, and that was their main, main
money making, you know,

A.155:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.156:  # deal # for the city.  And it would have devastated them if they would
have taken it away.

A.157:  Yeah. 

B.158:  Because everything, there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet
'n Wild and,

A.159:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.160:  # and # it, you know, that's, all the tourists come there. 

A.161:  Uh-huh. 

B.162:  And, and they, it would have been devastated, they would have collapsed.
So I'm kind of glad they're staying there.  Because it's right in the middle
of Fort Worth-Dallas, and, you know,

A.163:  Yeah.  That's, that's what I'd always heard, I've, uh,

B.164:  Yeah.  We, you know, we, I like it there.  And I think Dallas has enough to
offer that they don't have to hog everything [laughter].  So, I'm glad that
they're staying in Arlington.

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  And it's takes us maybe, uh, we-, well, thirty-five to forty minutes to get
there from Plano, which is not too bad at all. 

A.167:  Yeah.  That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial. 

B.168:  Yeah. 

A.169:  Um,

B.170:  # So, #

A.171:  # it's # actu-, it actually funny that, um, I live just outside of
Baltimore.  And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick,
but as it does to go to the, the ballpark in Me-, in, uh, Baltimore.

B.172:  Is that right?

A.173:  Because, um, to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate and,
because I live just south of the Interstate. 

B.174:  Uh-huh. 

A.175:  H-, hop on the Interstate, and the stadium's right off the Interstate
[laughter]. 

B.176:  Oh, gosh. 

A.177:  So, it's like I drive west and I'm there.  And, you know, and then to go
into Baltimore, I mean, it well, it's fewer miles, but I've got to go, stop and
go traffic and everything. 

B.178:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.179:  Do you read, um, I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED but you don't read
many sports books or,

B.180:  Well, not really.  Now my son does, I have, I have a son that just turned
sixteen,

A.181:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.182:  # and # he reads everything he gets, he gets his, get his hands on.  He's
reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle
fan.

A.183:  Um. 

B.184:  He's a basketball fan because he, he plays for the high school he goes to
and --

A.185:  Huh. 

B.186:  -- uh, just loves D-, Dick Vitelle, [laughter] which not many people do.
So, but he's reading it, [sigh] and he's r-, and he says, He's so interesting,
Mom.  You just can't believe all the things he's done.

A.187:  [Sniffing]. 

B.188:  And he's really enjoying that.  And I, and he said, Mom, you need to read
it after I get finished.  So maybe I will.

A.189:  There was, uh, I understand there was a really good basketball b-, book
called, uh, A SEASON ON THE BRINK. 

B.190:  I never heard that one. 

A.191:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I don't know.  {pause} I'm trying to think of the
guy's name.  It was like John Feinstein or something like that --

B.192:  Uh-huh. 

A.193:  -- wrote it.  I just heard about it the other night. 

B.194:  Huh. 

A.195:  Uh, I was listening to something on the radio --

B.196:  Uh-huh. 

A.197:  -- about, uh,

B.198:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.199:  # you # know, a talk show about sports books, and they, and they mentioned
that one. 

B.200:  I'll have to tell my son about that.  I'm sure he'd like it. 

A.201:  Yeah.  And, uh, I was thinking about, there was a, I saw a book kicking
around on the history of the A B A, which,

B.202:  Oh, that would be good [/hiss or static]. 

A.203:  Yeah.  I get in to, even when I don't like the sport so much, {sound
fading} I get interested in the history of sports franchises [/hiss or static],
