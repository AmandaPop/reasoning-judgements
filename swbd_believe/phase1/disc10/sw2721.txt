REMARKS:        Tape very broken at some places.  Speakers talked over each 
other quite a bit.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, I, I have, I purchased a gun, uh, recently and, uh, I wo-, I, I
feel like that, the way I feel about it that, uh, you know, it would be nice
if you get could get rid of guns completely, although I do like to shoot them
for sport, but I don't think you're going to be able to do that and to make it
difficult.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  You know, I think people are going to get guns, uh, no matter what.  Some,
somewhere or other, so make it difficult for the, for the, for the good people
of the world, I don't think it's going to solve the problem, so, but that's my
opinion.

B.4:  Yeah, I think, uh, I, I'm a, I'm an advocate of, uh, gun control
[laughter].  Uh, Maryland I think you'd be surprised is, is very pro gun
control.

A.5:  Really?  

B.6:  Yeah, as a state.  In fact we have, uh, they're now introducing some of the
more [throat_clearing] most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and,
uh, the, uh, N R A did a na-, nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat,
uh, Maryland's, uh, [lipsmack] local state laws and lost.  Maryland, uh, voted
in favor to have gun control here.  I think the problem is, is because of, uh,
we have, there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington, D
C,

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  that, uh, we're hoping that they could, you know, if they put in more
stricter laws, then that crime won't reach out into Maryland which is in a
sense, a suburb of that.  Uh, [lipsmack] I guess they're experiencing now, I
don't know, two murders or three murders a day in Washington, D C.  Normally
associated with automatic weapons.  So I think that's the, uh, that's the big
press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons.

A.9:  Okay, well, yeah, I,

B.10:  So yeah, I can understand, you know, guns for, and we, everybody else in
Maryland supports that,

A.11:  Well, #we have, we have,# 

B.12:  #and I hope-,#

A.13:  a very high crime rate here in Houston.  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  So, we're dealing with, uh, 

B.16:  Yeah, I think what you'll find, 

A.17:  that situation.

B.18:  though, is that the East Coast is very, uh, is pro gun control,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  I know I am.  

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  But, like, you know, you're a hunter, and you're a sport, you're a sport
hunter, that's true, and that, that's why, you know, in a sense, how it
doesn't, it does inconvenience you, but, it could save lives I think is the
way we look at it here.  And we're seeing so many murders, uh, [lipsmack]
between, uh, in, in Washington, D C.

A.23:  Well, do you think, though, that I mean if you have to wait seven days in
order to purchase a gun, are they really going to do these background checks,
and,

B.24:  #Well, I think,#  

A.25:  #and if they really,#

B.26:  I think the long run is, is to get, uh, is to get, and this is very
active in the pol-, politics here in Maryland now.  Then the long run, there's
also, there's a bill being, trying to be passed right now, I guess, through
the federal legislature on, uh, instant checkups.  Uh,

A.27:  I've #heard about that,# 

B.28:  #a total computerized system.# 

A.29:  but they say it's just so, going to be so expensive.  They'll never do
it.

B.30:  Right, and it's year, it's years away, but, it, it will be, it probably
will be implemented on the East Coast first because the F B I headquarters is
here in, in Virginia.  And the, this will probably be the places that will
start to come in faster [breathing].  So, yeah, it will take a while before,
uh, [lipsmack] it comes in, but that's one reason why, I guess the, the plan
is here in Maryland, uh, because I actually just received, uh, information
from [breathing] my, uh, uh, the, uh, Brady Organization that, uh, they want
this seven day bill passed, until the, uh, the new bill, until they can
actually have a computerized system [breathing].  And I think the idea of the
Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on
gun purchases or whatever.  Uh, until they can do it automatically on a large
computerized system.

A.31:  Yeah, but, what, what's going to happen to the, uh, purchasing of guns
illegally?

B.32:  Oh, sure that's,

A.33:  I mean, the guy who shot Brady was, he ha-, he purchased his gun many
months before he actually committed the deed.

B.34:  That's true, but he had, uh, he had a history of, of depression and,

A.35:  That's true.  

B.36:  and suicidal behavior, 

A.37:  They may be true, but if he wanted, 

B.38:  you know.  

A.39:  a gun, I meant, I meant you can purchase almost anything you want
illegally.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Meant there is a way to get it.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  Do you think he's not smart enough to figure that out?  

B.44:  Well, I don't think he would have been.  I think that his,

A.45:  Don't think so?  

B.46:  his type of crime, I, I don't think he would have been.  I think a street
criminal would be, you know, like what you find in Washington, D C.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  They would be capable of doing it.  I don't think this fellow would have.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I think, I think the idea is that they also, uh, my idea, too, is to remove
the automatic weapons from, from the markets.  You know, not to be able to
purchase, walk into a store,

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  and buy an automatic weapon [lipsmack].  

A.53:  So you think maybe some of the people who are mentally incapacitated,

B.54:  Right.  

A.55:  that will eliminate some of that, which, 

B.56:  It will,  eliminate some of the, 

A.57:  which really,

B.58:  you know, that, that type of crime or whatever, yeah and,

A.59:  I mean, if you can eliminate any, you're doing,

B.60:  Right, you can do anything.  Yeah, and, I, I think, 

A.61:  You're doing well.  

B.62:  that's, you know, in a sense, uh, I have friends that are peace activists
and, I'm not that extreme.  Everything, they think that everything comes down
to [breathing], you know, the whole world.  [breathing] But I just think that
right now we should do a little bit better checking, and, and, uh, and, I, I
believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country.
Uh, those are, you know, paramilitary.  I don't think even sport, you know, do
you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon?

A.63:  Huh-uh.  

B.64:  See, and I don't either, so, and I do have friends.  My brother is a
lifelong member of the N R A [laughter].

A.65:  [Laughter].  

B.66:  So, it's fun, you know, it's, uh, [breathing], but it's just a belief, you
know.  I guess we all work towards, uh, what we think will make it a better
society.

A.67:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.68:  Uh-huh [lipsmack].  And everybody's differences of opinion are probably
good.  That's what makes our, you know,

A.69:  Well, yeah, I'm, you know, I just, 

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  you know, I just couldn't understand what, Sar-, Sarah Brady just needs
something to do.  I mean this doesn't seem to be, you know, what is she really
going to accomplish if this goes through.  I mean it's really not going to
solve anything.  But if you're also talk-, does this have anything,

B.72:  [Breathing].

A.73:  her bill have anything to do with the automatic weapons?  

B.74:  No, but it's a start.  

A.75:  Yeah, but it's a start.

B.76:  I think, I think what you, I guess you have to look at things almost just
like the, I guess the, like the pro life and pro choice, is that you start
with something and if you accomplish it, then you increase your objectives
and, and you move to the,

A.77:  You can't, 

B.78:  next. 

A.79:  you can't do it all at once. 

B.80:  Yeah,  

A.81:  You have to do it gradually,  

B.82:  you can't do it at once. 

A.83:  step by step.  

B.84:  Yeah.  So once, if you can, uh, I guess if you can show the, put a seven
day waiting period in, you can mobilize for that, then you can also, uh, uh,
if you show the weakness in the N R A which is a big lobby, you know,
hopefully you can show enough weakness, uh, from the, the, the gun control
advocates, you can show enough weakness that you can, you know, get the
President to put a total ban on, on assault weapons or the legislatures, you
know.

A.85:  I guess once this passes in some areas, and then if you, after a year or so
you have some statistics,

B.86:  Yeah, 

A.87:  to work on, that would, 

B.88:  well, that's, yeah.  

A.89:  show that it, that, yeah, it does work, 

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  it has cut down at least in this area.  

B.92:  Right.  Yeah.  

A.93:  So maybe somebody else would want to,

B.94:  And see now, and if it doesn't work, I would be the first one to say, you
know, just like prohibition didn't work.  If it doesn't work, I think I'd be
one of the first ones to say okay, you know it hasn't worked in five years, it
hasn't reduced any crime.  The statistics still show the same so,

A.95:  But, it doesn't, uh, won't do anything to, uh, in other words, step, if
they, you know, I mean, I, I still keep my gun,

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  and you keep your gun if you have one.   

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  So it doesn't eliminate what's already out there, but just,

B.100:  Well, see you already registered.  I think the idea is, 

A.101:  Right.  

B.102:  to get a better idea of who purchases guns, uh, what type of person
purchases what type of, of gun, and, and, and also, you know, the idea that
somebody can go out, you know, a lot of the, the mass murderers, you know,
like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office, purchased, he was
severely depressed, uh, from, he'd just lost his job,

A.103:  Oh, right.  

B.104:  uh, the, he was severely depressed.  He'd been taking depressant drugs,
or whatever, and he walked into a, a store bought automatic weapons, bought
bullets,

A.105:  Right.

B.106:  drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former, uh,

A.107:  Right.

B.108:  supervisor.  

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  You know, and I think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on
some of these instant crimes, you know, this fellow may seek help before he
murders, you know, ideas like that [lipsmack].

A.111:  Um.

B.112:  And, you know, in, in all honesty, I think all of us believe that, uh,
that, uh, [lipsmack], uh, you know, people kill, guns don't.

A.113:  That's true, that's true.  

B.114:  You know, that I, I think, but the idea is to, is the, the compulsive,
neurotic by gun killer,

A.115:  So, do you think there, well, I guess there are quite a few of those.

B.116:  There, there are, and, and they always take a number of people with them
[lipsmack], so I,

A.117:  That's the unfortunate thing.  

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  The innocent, I meant, not that anyone should die,

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  (( )).

B.122:  See, and in the back of my mind, if we save one life, if you save one life,
you have to wait seven days, probably less, because if you have a clean
record, it probably would be faster than seven days, you know, but you have to
wait seven,

A.123:  But how would,

B.124:  you have to wait seven,

A.125:  how would any-, how would, if I went to buy a gun, and, and I had been
under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years, how would they have a
record of that?

B.126:  Oh, they probably wouldn't, not yet.  They probably wouldn't.

A.127:  I mean, that's something, 

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  that's privileged information, that's doctor patient type thing.

B.130:  Uh-huh.  

A.131:  So, how, how is that going to, you know, how, how is that going to work?

B.132:  Well, they might contact maybe an immediate member of your family and, and
ask them if, you know, they thought that you were capable,

A.133:  Oh, it isn't, you're really talking big bucks to start doing this kind of,
thing.

B.134:  Sure, yeah, but, I, I think it's worth it, you know, that's,

A.135:  Yeah.  

B.136:  you know they have strict gun laws in London and they have, and England,
and they have very few murders by, by, uh, automatic weapons and, and, uh, uh,
guns.  You know, even the, even the police for the longest time didn't really
carry guns and, all over Great Britain, though, the English,

A.137:  But, are, are there, are there, uh, uh, an equal amount of per capita
number of killings,

B.138:  No, it's far less,  

A.139:  by other means?  

B.140:  than what we have in the United States.  We're like the murder capital of
the world, [breathing] [lipsmack] in the civilized world,

A.141:  Yeah.  

B.142:  you know, above third world countries.  

A.143:  Yeah.  Sure would be nice to feel safe again, wouldn't it?  

B.144:  Yeah, and, I don't know it's, it's just, who knows.  It's an argument, I
guess.

A.145:  Uh-huh.  

B.146:  You know, but I, see that's the thing.  I totally a hundred percent see
everybody's point.  My brother's a member of the N R A.  We argue about this
over dinner [laughter].

A.147:  [Laughter].  

B.148:  And my mother and dad don't care one way or another.  So they just always
say, oh, just shut up boys.

A.149:  [Laughter].  

B.150:  [Laughter].  

A.151:  Well, I'm glad I talked to you because I have some, I got some, uh,
information from the other side, because I was,

B.152:  Yeah.  Well, and you know what's really funny is that it,
