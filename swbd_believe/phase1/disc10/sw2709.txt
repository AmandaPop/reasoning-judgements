=============================================================================

A.1:  [Child]. 

B.2:  Well, I'll tell you why I feel so, I feel strongly about this topic.  I
don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws.  But I do know that in the,
where I live and I teach school, there are so many Orientals that have come
here and there's a lot of Mexican people too.  Which is not, neither here nor
there, but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent,
uh, very wise in money matters and have ta-, have taken over a lot of
businesses, [laughter] and have, [child_talking] Really, ki-, it's kind of
scary because they're so bright.  They're, all the kids that I have that are
Oriental are really far above the American kids.  And they, and the, the
parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up.  And money is
their main goal.  And it's k-, it really is kind of scary [laughter] because
there's, there's just oodles of them.  And you can not believe the businesses
and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals.  And it's k-, it's
kind of scares me, not that I don't want them here and not that I don't
appreciate the fact that, you know, that they have rights too.  But [sigh] on
the other hand, you feel like almost they're, they're invading us to the point
where they're going to take over [/Child].

A.3:  Right.  Actually my son once said that, that, perhaps, uh, what we should
do is, is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest.  And, and
that might be the solution [laughter].

B.4:  I think probably that's,

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  a good idea. 

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  Because I lived in Iowa for, for about [child_talking] ten years before I
came here.  And I was born in Ohio,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # so # it, it really and there is, there are a lot of Mexican people here
because we're so close to the border. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  And, and they are wonderful people and, and I'm not, [child] you know, I
don't want to deny them their rights.  Just that you, you feel like when you
were born and raised here and you worked re-, very hard to make this country
what it is, uh, it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over.  And
a lot of these people plan one day to go back, you know, to, to Vietnam or to,
you know, Taiwan or wherever they're from.  And take with them a lot of
American dollars plus a lot of power in American com-, com-, companies.  And
it's kind of scary [Laughter].

A.13:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

B.14:  #And, you know,# I don't know, I don't know the immigration laws that, uh,
that well and I do not, and in fact I don't know them at all.  I don't know how
many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a, I
don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore.  Do you know
anything about #that?#

A.15:  #No,# I don't, I don't know.  I lived in the Middle East for sometime and
I, I --

B.16:  #Oh.# 

A.17:  -- #do# believe there must have been some sort of quota system because, uh,
[lipsmack] I know a lot of people that were, in a sense, not, qualified is the
wrong word, but certainly were deserving to come.

B.18:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.19:  #And#  it seemed to take them a long time or, or there was a lot of
uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come [lipsmack]. 

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  [Lipsmack]  And so I would guess that, you know, there are quotas for
different places. 

B.22:  I would think so too.  It,

A.23:  You know, I, I, I think there's something about being able to, to claim,
um, imminent danger or, I'm not sure what the terminology is.

B.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.25:  Maybe political a-,

B.26:  Asylum, of some sort. 

A.27:  Yeah.  There, there you go.  You got the term. 

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  And maybe that's a, an issue with a, a lot of people.  I don't know.
#But,#

B.30:  #Well,#

A.31:  Yeah, I, I guess I haven't been in a situation where it's, it's been
threatening to, to me.  Uh,

B.32:  Well, I teach in the suburb of Dallas and, and, uh, my kids go to school in
another suburb of Dallas.  And, with very, very good school systems.  And
they're considered, you know one of the top three in the state.  Both of them,
you know. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to
these schools. 

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here.  And the kids
in this area are very bright.  And come from, you know, parents that are
professionals or semiprofessionals and, and, uh, very interested in their
education.  But, uh, I think in the, last year, I'm not, if I'm not mistaken,
in four of the six high schools, the graduating class valedictorian and
salutatorian were, uh, alm-, half or more Oriental.

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.38:  And, you know, they're just extremely bright kids.  And also they value
learning. 

A.39:  I was going to say, I'm not s-, I, I would guess that it's not that they
are any brighter, but they just maybe work harder or,

B.40:  Well, I, I think things come easy for them too.  But I do think that they
have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of
kids in the United States.  I don't, they, uh, don't want to work for
anything.  They want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want
to work hard.  And these kids work really hard.

A.41:  Right, right.  #May-,#

B.42:  #And,# and they have,

A.43:  but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've, we've let this
value slip. 

B.44:  Yeah.  I know, I agree with that. 

A.45:  And they need to have some competition. 

B.46:  But what I see is y-, the competition is there, but instead of meeting the
challenge, they're starting to resent them. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  And it's causing, you know, I think some, some problems. 

A.49:  Well, that's too bad. 

B.50:  It really is. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Because we see a lot of racial problems in Dal-, the Dallas area anyway,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # especially # in Dallas.  And it's mainly Black and, and, and Hispanic. 

A.55:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.56:  But, uh, there is some, there has been some resentment with Orientals in
the Black community because they've started businesses there, and the Blacks
resent them coming in and taking their money, and there's been some violence
because of it.

A.57:  Oh, that's really sad. 

B.58:  It is.  It's, it is very sad. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  So, you know, I really, I, I've, I've always prided myself [laughter]  on
not being prejudiced and being, you know, uh, welcome, welcoming everyone --

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  -- that wants to come here.  And even when I was younger wh-, when I was in
college, I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north, and I was
very into that, the human rights part of everything. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  But I, I've, I've become very cynical --

A.65:  Uh-huh. 

B.66:  -- in the last three, four years living in Texas. 

A.67:  Well, and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change.  Maybe
the, [lipsmack] {pause} uh, you know, the e-, there is too big of a
concentration coming all at once to, to allow for adequate melting into the
society.

B.68:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, and exactly, that's exactly true.  Plus the fact
that these people do come for a short period of time.  Two, two, three, four
maybe five years and then go back.  And pick our brains, which is wonderful,
and take all that back with them.  And, and, uh, plus a lot of American
dollars.  But in, in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world
too.

A.69:  #Right.# 

B.70:  #You know,# you just don't know. 

A.71:  Exactly. 

B.72:  An-, and yet, you know, with, uh, with, uh, {pause} there's somebody on my
other line but I'm going to ignore [laughter]  --

A.73:  #Oh.# 

B.74:  -- #that.#  Uh, anyway I just, you, you kind of, you don-, you really don't
know what to do.  And, and I don't, I want my kids to have values where they're
accepting and so forth. 

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  And both of my children are really tol-, more tolerant of Blacks and H-,
Hispanics than they are of the Orientals,

A.77:  # Um.  #

B.78:  # for # some reason.  They feel, you know, like they've taken over.  They
feel like, uh, you know, they're taking some of the, the rewards that they
should have. 

A.79:  Right. 

B.80:  And I really don't want that to happen. 

A.81:  Right,

B.82:  # But, #

A.83:  # right.  #

B.84:  but it's happening. 

A.85:  Right. 

B.86:  And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too. 

A.87:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.88:  So, and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I [talking] 
{voice in background says, Hi.  Speaker responds, Hi.}  {Speaker resumes
talking} I really do wish I, I knew more about immigration laws because I have
no idea any more. 

A.89:  Right. 

B.90:  Because they've changed a great deal. 

A.91:  I would, I would suspect that they have.  Well, I guess, um, I don't have
much, [laughter] much more to contribute to the topic. 

B.92:  Yeah.  I don't really either.  I wish I knew more. 

A.93:  Yeah. 

B.94:  Probably if I did, [child]  I might be a little bit more, uh, tolerant,

A.95:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.96:  # perhaps.  # And I, and even if I, I really wish I knew the situations
they were going back to or coming from.

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  You don't know any of that and you feel, you know, you can't put yourself
in their shoes or really understand them.

A.99:  Right. 

B.100:  Unless, and for some reason Orientals are very, uh, my good friend calls
them pushy, but I call them very, that they know what they want and they go get
it. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  And in stores and so --

A.103:  #Goal directed.# 

B.104:  -- #and so forth# it's, wh-, pardon me?

A.105:  Goal directed. 

B.106:  Yeah.  But in stores and things, sometimes they can be very impolite
because they can, they get in front of you --

A.107:  Oh.  I see. 

B.108:  -- or they, uh, they take something that you had in mind to get before you
did.  You know, just going for it, they take it quickly. 

A.109:  Uh-huh. 

B.110:  And, uh, they don't think anything of that.  And I don't, you know, that's
makes people resentful too.  And so,

A.111:  Sure, sure. 

B.112:  And yet they have, they have a right to be here and I know that. 

A.113:  Uh-huh. 

B.114:  But it's, it sometimes it's gets touchy. 

A.115:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.116:  So, and I'm sure it's a lot different, you're from Maryland,

A.117:  #Yes,#

B.118:  #You said?# What part of Maryland are you from?

A.119:  Up in the Gaithersburg area. 

B.120:  Oh, okay.  My sister used to live #there,#

A.121:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.122:  in that area.  And I, I'm sure that it's a lot different there.  Uh,
it's a lot different in I-, than, in Iowa than #it is here.# 

A.123:  #Well, no.#  I think, I think there, as I recall in my son's class, there
were, were an awfu-, an awful lot of mi-, minorities. 

B.124:  Is that right?

A.125:  And, uh, of all, of all varieties.  And {pause} with the same, you know,
some of the, some of the same problems that you've mentioned.  But, uh, I don't
know, I guess I wasn't involved enough to, to, uh, really stop to think about
it. 

B.126:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, you know, since I teach, I see th-, see it.  And, and I
feel and I love the example that most of these children give the, our American
children.  And yet, you know, I can see why some of the parents are fear-, that
are #fearful too.# 

A.127:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

B.128:  And, and it's a kind of a touchy situation. 

A.129:  Uh-huh. 

B.130:  And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel
threatened.  But --

A.131:  Exactly, exactly. 

B.132:  -- it doesn't happen that way --

A.133:  Right,

B.134:  -- all the time. 

A.135:  right. 

B.136:  So anyway,

A.137:  Well, it was good talking to you. 

B.138:  It was good to talk to, #to you too.# 

A.139:  #And I h-,#

B.140:  And have a good trip in California. 

A.141:  Okay. And have a good weekend.

B.142:   All right. Well thank you.

A.143:   A- all righty,

B.144:   #Bye-bye.#

A.145:   #Bye-bye.# [noise].

B.146:   [noise].
