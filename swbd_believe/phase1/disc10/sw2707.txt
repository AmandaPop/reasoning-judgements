==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  Um, yeah. 

@A.3:  We're official now, yeah,

B.4:  [Laughter].  Yeah, it's um, it's very hot, in fact I've been cleaning,
because I live in an apartment --

A.5:  Oh, okay,

B.6:  -- so I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening --

A.7:  Oh, yeah. 

B.8:  -- um, you know, I have the little flower boxes with, um, a v-, a lot of
different flowers, and I do enjoy plants, but I don't have a yard or anything
that I can do gardening, really. 

A.9:  Oh, you're, you're, you're not the so-called ex-, you need a house, I
guess, to go through all of that.  I have had a couple of houses, and, uh --

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  -- the only recommendation I would have for someone who hasn't gardened is,
uh, one, get a couple of good books, of books, of course, and usually they have
talk shows. 

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  Here in Dallas --

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  -- they have two great, uh, talk shows that go through everything that will
grow here, which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are
--

B.16:  Right, right. 

A.17:  -- and so.  Uh --

B.18:  Well, the,

A.19:  -- in fact, you, you could easily do that now, listen to, turn on a talk
show up there --

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  -- and see if there, there's got to be some gardening folks --

B.22:  Yes, but,

A.23:  -- on the radio that says when to put your grass in, and, and what kind of
grass to grow up in Virginia and everything, so I, uh, for someone who doesn't
garden, I'd say, that, that's my biggest recommendation is to,

B.24:  Uh-huh, so you enjoy gardening?

A.25:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I like it a lot, uh --

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  -- uh, it's a lot of work.  I'm an engineer, I'm, I'm with T I.  You, are
you with T I up there or,

B.28:  No, no, I'm with a defense contractor. 

A.29:  Okay.  Uh, where was, oh, yeah, no, I, I like it, I, uh, I always know that
why I'm not a farmer when I garden though,

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  I mean, it is dog work, and it is tough --

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.33:  -- I have a lot of trees, down here, uh, the part I don't like, I guess,
would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves --

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  -- forever it seems like, and the wind blows all the leaves on from your
neighbor after you rake yours, so --

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  -- other than that, you know, those three months, when it's pure dog work
--

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  -- uh, the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences
of, of putting little plants in or whatever --

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  -- I, I haven't had to plant any trees because I've got so many, but, uh --

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  -- uh, but I do listen to that talk show.  There, there is some great
people from Texas A and M, I don't know, maybe you've heard of A and M down
here, but there's some great, uh, folks, uh --

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  -- that have been well trained, and, again, uh, to, to, uh, recommend
gardening for this area. 

B.46:  Um.  Yeah, I'm sure it is, you know, different in the different areas.  Um,
I'm originally from Pennsylvania, and I do go home on weekends during the
Summer and, uh, and, uh, mow my mother's grass and different things like that.

A.47:  Yeah, you probably have rye grass up there.  We grow bermuda and Saint
Augustine here. 

B.48:  Oh, I would have no idea [laughter]. 

A.49:  Right, yeah, see, you would have to learn that, though, see [laughter]. 

B.50:  No idea whatsoever. 

A.51:  [Laughter]. 

B.52:  Like I said, I'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and
my flower boxes and my herbs on --

A.53:  Um. 

B.54:  -- my window sill, and,

A.55:  Do you have much luck in the Winter, or they're, they're freeze it, freeze
out because the roots are all, in the Winter, uh, or do you have to start all
over every year?

B.56:  Yeah, I have to start all over every year --

A.57:  Right, yeah,

B.58:  -- well, except, I do have some, um, some day lilies that --

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  -- um, you know, I don't do anything with and they seem to come back year
after year, and I leave them on my balcony even in --

A.61:  In the same pot, that's amazing. 

B.62:  -- in the snow and the Winter, you know --

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  -- in the ice, everything, because here, you know, not as severe as the
snow is in Pennsylvania, but here we still do get some snow and ice and --

A.65:  Yeah,

B.66:  -- things like that. 

A.67:  I grow a few things in pots, but we have to bring them in here --

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  -- in the Winter because usually, uh, if it's not below the ground so you
can insulate the roots from freezing --

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  -- you know, the pots will, will die, everything in a pot will die --

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  -- so, you can bring them, well, we do bring stuff in the garage and
everything --

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  -- but, uh, it's quite time consuming, by the way.  I don't know how close
you are to getting a house or anything, but it's quite, uh.  But I would
definitely do it, I'm all for doing everything, whether, whatever subject you
pick, do it the knowledgeable way --

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  -- don't go out there and start digging holes, uh,

B.78:  Right, right, I agree with that. 

A.79:  Get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia --

B.80:  Uh-huh. 

A.81:  -- as, as well as, not your neighbors, of course, they usually know
nothing but,

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  listen to still, then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper --

B.84:  Uh-huh, yeah,

A.85:  -- or communications, as well as, I bet there's a talk show up there right
now that you, if you turn the dial around --

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  -- you'll, on Saturday,

B.88:  [Cough]. 

A.89:  this is Saturday, that you'll find someone, probably in the morning, I
don't know --

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  -- discussing, you know, what we do up in Virginia to get something growing
--

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  -- you probably don't have to do much over there, the soil's probably so
good --

B.94:  Uh-huh. 

A.95:  -- our soil's not very good down here.  We're --

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- I guess in the ice age, it, it, it's pushed a lot of, uh, limestone and
everything,

B.98:  [Cough]. 

A.99:  to some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid
limestone, you know --

B.100:  Wow, uh-huh. 

A.101:  -- so, uh, I think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of
like the Johnny Appleseed type trees, where people have come from, I'm sure
the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas, it's
so scrubby --

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  -- uh, and I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees
from Alabama and all that, too --

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  -- we, we call them native pecan trees but, they grow wild here, they're
eating pecans though [noise].  Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia,
they're probably only in the South --

B.106:  Uh-huh, right I'm,

A.107:  -- for pecan pie and all that, it's what they call pecan, pecan pie up
there in the East.

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  (( )) from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, I'm from New Jersey originally. 

B.110:  Uh-huh, oh, you don't sound like it [laughter]. 

A.111:  Yeah, I've worked on that [laughter]  with a little chewing gum, which I
shouldn't do, uh,

B.112:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.113:  Go ahead, you, how many times have you called by the way, or how many times
have you been called?

B.114:  Um, I've been called a lot, at the times, though, it's been not very
appropriate, I guess, that I haven't been able to actually participate.  I've
participated probably in about maybe, I don't know, seven calls --

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  -- and you know, I've called a couple of times, but most of the time I
notice that, um, you know, it takes forever to get a call through. 

A.117:  Oh, yeah, today, that's what I'm saying, today, I was, I got to laugh,
because I tried it this morning, and I thought everybody was gardening, I
thought, Well, no --

B.118:  Yeah. 

A.119:  -- no.  This is a great subject because they're out there gardening, you
know,

B.120:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.121:  I didn't tell you what our weather is like.  It is beautiful here --

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  -- today,

B.124:  Yeah, it's like eighty-five degrees here,

A.125:  It's not quite that hot.  Yeah, we've had a real nice mild Spring.  You
might have seen, if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that
were --

B.126:  No, I haven't

A.127:  -- north of us.  Uh, I don't know if you get C N N.  I don't get C N N but
it's here at work --

B.128:  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  -- in fact, I'm at work today, believe it or not. 

B.130:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.131:  But, uh, they have T V -s in the break areas --

B.132:  Uh-huh. 

A.133:  -- and there was some heavy tornados, uh, I guess in Kansas, quite a few
people were killed.  You'll see that on the evening news. 

B.134:  Oh, my, uh-huh. 

A.135:  Uh,

B.136:  I'll have to make sure I catch that. 

A.137:  Tornados, uh, which is not the right subject,

B.138:  [Laughter]. 

A.139:  but, uh, they blow through here all in the Spring.  I guess it's related
somewhat to the weather, you know --

B.140:  Uh-huh. 

A.141:  -- and, and the plants and all that, that, uh --

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  -- sometimes they do essentially nothing, and the weather men yesterday
were all alert, say, hey, there's something really terrible going to happen,
and they, they sure were right, but it wasn't in Texas, it was --

B.144:  Uh-huh. 

A.145:  -- north of us.  Yeah, look at the news tonight, they'll, they'll --

B.146:  I'll have to make sure I catch that,

A.147:  -- they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City, Kansas,

B.148:  Uh, Uh-huh. 

A.149:  Anyway, back on planting.  Uh, (( )). It is very interesting, uh, subject,
uh, when you, when did you get a house, uh, your, your trees grow up so well up
there, but I'm sure you have plenty of trees. 

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  That, that is a key thing for shade --

B.152:  Uh-huh. 

A.153:  -- and keeping your bills down, uh, I guess you have mostly pine trees, but
where in Virginia are you all?

B.154:  Um, right now, the District, Washington --

A.155:  Uh-huh. 

B.156:  -- um, in Fairfax, Virginia.  It's fifteen miles west of Washington, D C. 

A.157:  Oh, do you have the cherry blossoms there, in there or not? 

B.158:  Yeah, there's, there's a few, not, you know, nearly as many as what's
actually in the District.  But, um, they're definitely enjoyable. 

A.159:  Yeah. 

B.160:  Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful. 

A.161:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, azaleas grow all over, we grow those here, too, although
again, we have to prepare the soil. 

B.162:  Uh-huh. 

A.163:  You probably have nice big pine, you probably have all kinds of trees, the
oaks and everything, that's one thing I noticed there. 

B.164:  Yeah, there, there, there is a vast variety here of, you know, trees, like,
if I look out my window right now, I can see, you know, couple of pine trees,
some oak trees --

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  -- yeah. 

A.167:  Have you ever been down here?

B.168:  Um, no, actually I haven't. 

A.169:  Okay, it's interesting country.  It is wide open, uh, and flat --

B.170:  Uh-huh. 

A.171:  -- uh, and again as I said, I think the, when the Indians were here there,
there weren't any trees, but the, the civilization has brought all kinds of
experiments with all kinds of trees, and a lot of them have done well --

B.172:  Uh-huh. 

A.173:  -- uh, they do have some pine forest areas in wes-, in wes-, in east Texas
--

B.174:  Uh-huh. 

A.175:  -- where you have native pine trees, but here in Dallas it's, I think they
all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed, and Johnny Pecanseed,
whatever you would call it, you know, there's a tremendous amount of pecan
trees --

B.176:  Uh-huh. 

A.177:  -- that we use for, you know, uh, for eating --

B.178:  Uh-huh. 

A.179:  -- I think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop, uh, hundred
and fifty years ago, because they are all over the place --

B.180:  Uh-huh. 

A.181:  -- in the South.  What else?

B.182:  Um, well, [laughter]  I guess that I really don't know that much. 

@@A.183:  I don't have any say.  I, I, the subjects are usually pretty interesting.
I, I'm, I'm, of course, I'm a T I -er, so I'm hoping this works.  T I is very
good, uh, has done a lot of experiments in the speech, uh --

B.184:  Uh-huh. 

A.185:  -- speech, uh, synthesis, synthesis, can't say it. 

B.186:  Uh-huh. 

A.187:  And they've come out with some new products, in fact this week, they came
out with some new math, uh, you might see them in your advertisements, uh, new
math, uh, Speak and Math, uh, devices.  They, they have had Speak and Spell and
all that for years --

B.188:  Right. 

A.189:  -- but they've come out with some different ones --

B.190:  Uh-huh. 

A.191:  -- this past week, and, uh, my wife and everyone, what, what are they going
to accomplish out of all this, and I said, Well, you're not going to have to
type on the computer one day, you're just going to have to talk to it --

B.192:  Right, uh-huh. 

A.193:  -- you know, so, you, you, it's going to be much faster, of course, you
know, the classical thing for the handicapped, too, person who can't type very
fast or --

B.194:  Uh-huh. 

A.195:  -- like I can of course --

B.196:  Uh-huh. 

A.197:  -- not that I can type very fast either but, uh,

B.198:  Uh-huh, but then what about people that, um, I, I, I personally work with
someone that, that is deaf, and cannot speak.  She can speak, but she can't
speak very clearly --

A.199:  Yeah. 

B.200:  -- and she in fact is a data entry person, I mean she types away all day,
