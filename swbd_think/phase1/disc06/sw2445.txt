REMARKS:        Speaker A was very hard to understand.  She mumbled a lot.

==========================================================================

A.1:  I don't know, um, do you do a lot of camping? 

B.2:  Well, my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping, we, but we
bought a van last year,

A.3:  Yeah. 

B.4:  and we were hoping, uh, to do some camping in the van, um, we did go
camping in Arkans-, not Arkansas, Oklahoma.  Uh, last year in, we camped in a
tent, and, uh, there were two other couples with us and there was, uh, state
park.

A.5:  Oh, so (( )),

B.6:  And it was really nice. 

A.7:  Yeah, um, up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them
aren't, some of them are pretty rough.

B.8:  Really? 

A.9:  Um, yeah, they, they just have like outhouses, they don't have like a
shower room or anything, ((yeah)), but some of them are really nice they have
showers and full bathrooms,

B.10:  Um.  

A.11:  um, but I don't know, I, I've been camping a couple times but I'm not a
real avid camper, uh, a lot of people I know are, but, um, I don't, I don't ((
)).

B.12:  I, I don't like really camping in the rough.  I like the, the, the little
necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers
and things like that.

A.13:  Yeah, (( )) we went, we went once to a ((lean-to)) and it, um, I mean,
there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right, we only
spent two nights there.  I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights.  I
wouldn't want to go for like a week, but, um,

B.14:  Yeah, that would, that would be much. 

A.15:  two nights is good.  Um, especially there was a little store close by,
so, it was pretty nice.

B.16:  Yeah, the campsite that we went to was an area that, it's right on a big
lake, and there's a lot of boating out there, and we, we went up there to
hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still, uh, it
was still, too, cold.

A.17:  Oh, really?  Oh. 

B.18:  Yeah, it, it was pretty early in the year. 

A.19:  Um, yeah, up here you got to wait until, Aug-, August, ((until the water
warms up)).

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Well, it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly.  Um, I don't know, I
was, I have a tent and I ((fluff out)) in it, in the backyard and stuff, but
this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and
another thing is the thing seems to get, it's dirty [laughter] you know,

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  so, you can't keep the dirt out of the tent.  I don't know we have a
seven year old, it's pretty funny, #like stay out.#

B.24:  #Yeah, we, we have,# we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid
[laughter].

A.25:  Yeah, ((boy, he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times)).

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  And use it as a play, uh, they like to play in them. 

B.28:  Yeah, I don't know how you can really keep, uh, the inside of a tent clean.

A.29:  ((Yeah, I don't know)).

B.30:  Other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or
something and, and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to, to keep the
sand and dirt out of it.

A.31:  Yeah, well, what we were doing, we were just going to say, we're just going
to sleep in the tent and hang out at night, so, you know, no going in and out,
and, or what he wants to do, we had brought his friend along, was play in the
tent.  It was like, no, this is not working, [laughter], you can't do that,
you get the tent all dirty.

B.32:  Did,

A.33:  Plus you get it all wet, we were at a beach site, too. 

B.34:  Uh-huh.  Um, did you have another, a big tent, like uh, um, like a, looks
like a sitting area type, you know, like a two room type (( ))?

A.35:  No, but, you know, I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard
because they are really nice and, um, up here we have, uh, we have quite a few
mosquitoes at nighttime.

B.36:  Yeah, yeah. we don't really have a problem with that, um, in these areas,
um, and even, even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a
problem with bugs.  And I noticed that, I know that I said, that's, I've, I've
lived back east before, um, they,

A.37:  ((They're)) terrible, they're really terrible.  Uh, but, there's this one
campsite, that it, just some of them are known but there is one that's out in
this big lake and it's, it's, it's, mosquitoes are terrible and then there's
this, there's this other one ((that's)) more up in the mountains but it
surrounds a man-made reservoir and there's no bugs, that's the whole thing
that everyone told me, oh, I'm, I was going to go to, Lit-, Little River State
Park, (( )) that place is great, there's no bugs.

B.38:  Huh.

A.39:  But, oh, okay, because, uh, we were having a really big problem up here in
certain areas, we were really affected ((bad by it)), but really got it, um,
almost destroyed the ch-, the ((tourism)) in one town, because of the
mosquitoes, they're so, bad.

B.40:  Really? 

A.41:  Yeah, that was, it's a really nice area, I've been there before and it's,
I, I couldn't imagine ge-, living just sixty miles north of them but they were
plagued, they were plagued with them, with mosquitoes.  And you can go out,
outside in the daytime, all right, but the minute the sun went down, um,
that's when it's usually, the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out.

B.42:  Huh.

A.43:  I mean, just the very second, it's really strange.  They, uh, they must,
uh, work on that, you know, the, i-, it gets cooler when the sun sets and then
they all come out.

B.44:  Well, have you ever, have you ever taken any of those, um, what do they
call this, (( )) lights, have you ever used those?

A.45:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I never really noticed how effective they were, but, um,
because that wasn't really, I bought them, (( )) I really didn't get to use
them like, oh, there's mosquitoes let's turn them.  We just sort of lit them.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And, um, we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes, so, we didn't really
contribute it to that.  But, um, I think in an area that's really thick with
mosquitoes, I can't see all this little, uh, smoke buckets I call them,

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  (( )) they work, but they're suppose to work really well. 

B.50:  Huh.

A.51:  Oh, I'm in my paperwork here, that's what I do when I wait for a phone
call, I get in my paperwork.  [laughter].  Oh, to find my most important
parts.  But I don't know, I don't know if I'm going to go, I wish was an avid
camper and I could really talk about like gardening or something, you can talk
about that a lot,

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  but, um, I do want to go again.  We just moved to a new hou-, into a
house, so, I don't think camping, maybe in the backyard, but I don't see going
on a camping trip probably until next summer.

B.54:  Yeah, I'd, I'd like to go camping cross-country, um, I just got married
less than two years ago, so, we don't have any, any children yet, um,

A.55:  So, it's easy for you to go.

B.56:  Yeah, so, easy to pick up and go, and, s-, we have a van and we can just
throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it.

A.57:  Um, oh, God {very faint}. 

B.58:  So, it's not really, I guess, camping the way peop-, most people picture
camping in the tent but, 

A.59:  I don't know but that sounds that my, my kind of camping, it really does.
Yeah, okay, um, well, um, that is (( )) is to have a, a nice vehicle where you
can have everything in it, plus your tent.

B.60:  Yeah, or, or get, my brother has a real nice pop-up. 

A.61:  Yep.

B.62:  And he just, he just tows it behind his truck. 

A.63:  Um,

B.64:  And he, he's got three kids, so, his kids will sleep in the truck, in the,
in the back of the bed.  Um, and they sleep in the pop-up.

A.65:  Well, those, they're kind of nice but they're also, um, flimsy when you
really look at them.  But when you get inside they're really nice, you know,

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  everything's really, but then when you look underneath them, it's just
got these little wheels and this (( )) little axle, it's like, oh, my and then
a big windstorm it would pick you up.

B.68:  Yeah, he did have a problem, uh, when he went camping last year in Beavers
Bend, Ok-, Oklahoma, um, a, a storm came in and it started raining really
heavy and they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite,
[laughter], everybody was getting stuck in the mud.

A.69:  Oh, jeez, 

B.70:  And, uh,

A.71:  yeah, what do you, what do you do when you get a, I mean, like a really
violent storm like a tornado, just stay in your truck.  I mean, I wouldn't
stay in the, um, 

B.72:  Well, theirs was so bad, and they were so close to the water that the water
was coming up,

A.73:  Oh. 

B.74: and they had to get out of there. 

A.75:  So, then, were they successful?

B.76:  Yeah, they, yeah, they were. 

A.77:  But it took them a little while? 

B.78:  But, yeah, they [laughter] they decided that, that was enough camping for
the weekend.

A.79:  Yeah, so, did they get stuck? 

B.80:  No, they ended up getting out.  They ended up helping several other people
though that were, that were stuck.

A.81:  Yeah, huh.  Well, so, they evacuated it [laughter].  

B.82:  Yeah, yeah, they, the whole, the whole campsite was evacuated.

A.83:  Wow. 

B.84:  I mean some, I think some people that had fairly sturdy, um, vehicles or
whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in
away from the water, I think they stayed.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  But everybody that was real close to the water ended up, it was either that
or their truck was going to go floating downstream.

A.87:  I know I always I like (( )) to get right on the water, ((yeah, by the))
campsite, it's so,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  (( )) we have lean-tos up here.  I really like them, like I say, they're
kind of, just kind of more ((sturdy)) than anything, you know, just, just,

B.90:  They have them right at the campsites? 

A.91:  Yeah, they're, they're lean-tos.  They're, um,

B.92:  Wow.  

A.93:  Yeah, they're pretty nice, they're, they're, uh, it's like a little house
except the whole face is open, and the one time that we went, we got one, it
was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment, I wanted to get one
right on the water.  (( )) we had an electrical storm too, and it was really,
it was neat sitting there watching it, I mean, it was raining, when we called
(( )) home, everybody said, oh, we were worried about you in that storm ...
