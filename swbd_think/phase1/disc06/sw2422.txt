===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  Are you,

A.3:  Are, are you an exercise fanatic?

B.4:  Well, I'm sort of an exercise fanatic.  I'm big on swimming.

A.5:  Oh, really.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Well, that's way north, too.  I guess you have to swim inside, huh?

B.8:  Yeah, I, uh, I, I find I do more swimming in the wintertime than I do in
the summer.

A.9:  Really.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Wow.

B.12:  Uh, my wife has a sailboat, so I wind up on the sailboat a lot in the
summertime.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  But it's the winter months that I can get serious about swimming.

A.15:  Oh, well, that's good.  That's, that's one of the best ones I understand,
no stress on the joints.

B.16:  Well, it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a
while [laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter] Yeah, I guess so, but as far as the weight bearing.

B.18:  Yeah, well, I find that, uh, if I want to lose some weight, that, uh, I
can't do it unless I exercise as well.

A.19:  Yeah, that's true.  Plus even if you lose weight and don't exercise, it
ends up just l-, you know, looking unhealthy.

B.20:  Yeah.  Well, last year I had a campaign to lose about, uh, twenty pounds
and, uh, I ((wound)) up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during
the year.

A.21:  Wow.  Do you swim like at a, at a Y or,

B.22:  Yes, uh, Fairfax County has, uh, a number of, uh, park authority, uh,
recreation centers, and all of them have, uh, at least a twenty-five meter or
twenty-five yard, uh, swimming pool.

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  And, in fact, out here in Oakton we have, uh, there's a fifty meter, uh,
pool called Oakmar and it's sort of a, uh, uh, a landmark pool.  It's a very,
uh, excellent design, you know, top rated pool.

A.25:  Huh.

B.26:  And good, uh, gallery facilities for competitive,

A.27:  Really.

B.28:  uh, events and things like that.

A.29:  Is it like Olympic size?

B.30:  It's Olympic size, yes.

A.31:  Wow.  Are you, are you a TI employee?

B.32:  No, I, uh, work for E-Systems,

A.33:  What,

B.34:  which is, which is another Dallas company [laughter].

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  But I'm at the, uh, ((Melpar)) division here in, uh,

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Falls Church.

A.39:  Well, the reason I ask you, I, I'm a TI employee and, uh, we have a fitness
center, you know, that's on site --

B.40:  Huh.

A.41:  -- that makes it real, real convenient because I tend to find that once I
get home, that's it, you know.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I tend to not want to go anywhere after that.  But this way, you know, you
can go to the fitness center right from work, and they have aerobics and, you
know, all the nautilus machines and all that sort of stuff.  We're not, we're
not high rollers like Dallas.  We don't have a pool, but [laughter].

B.44:  Yeah.  Well, I have, we have a, uh, recreation center which is almost right
across the street from our, uh, office.

A.45:  Oh, that's good.

B.46:  And so I hit there at seven o'clock in the morning, get in a half hour swim
and still make it to work on time.

A.47:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, morning is usually a better time to exercise, but
I usually find that after work is when I have the time to do it.

B.48:  Huh.  Well, I get to put work after work.  I, I have to,

A.49:  [Laughter] You have ((honey dos))?

B.50:  hurry home and, uh, and help out with the kids, and,

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  fix things around the house and all those kind of chores.

A.53:  ((Honey dos)).

B.54:  So the morning hour is my time to myself.

A.55:  Yeah.  Well, that's gre-, I, I like to, to work out some in the morning but
it's not like, you know, I usually use the video or something like that to do.

B.56:  Oh you,  

A.57:  Plus I like to dance, you know.

B.58:  Oh, you do the aerobic, uh, dancing then?

A.59:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, and, and on Saturdays I go to a Jazzercise class.  That's
my,

B.60:  Yeah, well, that looks, that looks like so much work to me.  I,

A.61:  Oh, it's fun,

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  Jazzercise is really fun.

B.64:  But you put out a lot of energy, uh, keeping up that pace.

A.65:  Yeah, there, there's a lot of energy.  I, I, I like to belly dance, too,
but there's not the same, you know, you don't get the aerobic --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- workout as much.  But Jazzercise is wha-, it's, it's so much fun that
you forget you're exercising, you know.

B.68:  Huh.

A.69:  Aerobics you don't forget [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  You know you're exercising.  Oh, and we started the bench aerobics, too.  I
don't know if you've seen that.

B.72:  I haven't see that, no.

A.73:  That's, that's a fairly new thing.  It's just like, uh, one step.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  You know, it's like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and
up down, do different variations, you know, change feet and, and you'd be
surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up.

B.76:  Oh, okay.

A.77:  It's a, it's a lot quicker and, and that way it's completely low impact.
There's no jumping or, you know, no jarring on the knee bones [laughter].

B.78:  Yeah, I, I see some of these exercise machines that, uh, it looks like
you're constantly walking up stairs.

A.79:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.80:  And, uh, I think that should get your heart rate right up there at the
maximum and keep it there.

A.81:  Yeah, that will do it.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Yeah, we have one of those, too, but it's boring.

B.84:  Yeah, I can see that.  Well, I, a lot of people complain about swimming,
that that's, uh, boring.

A.85:  Oh, but that wouldn't be boring like walking up stairs [laughter].

B.86:  But I find that, uh, o-, over the years I've developed the ability to keep
track of my, uh, workout and at the same time, uh, do some creative thinking,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  while I'm swimming.  So I, I can write letters to congressman and,

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  uh, organize reports and, uh,

A.91:  Well, do you count your laps or do you just have a time segment that you,

B.92:  I, I count them.  I, I swim a sixteen fifty every day and, uh, so that's
sixty-six lengths of the pool.

A.93:  Jeez.

B.94:  And, uh, I, sometimes I may not be conscious of keeping count, but, uh, you
know, every now and then, when I do check up and say where is my count, I
check it relative to the clock and, and I also wind up coming out even
[clicking].

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  even side of the pool.

A.97:  Yeah.  Well, that's neat.  Do you, do you look forward to doing it or do
you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started?

B.98:  I usually, uh, look [clicking] forward to it.  Uh, and, in fact, some
mornings I, uh, almost feel a necessity --

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  -- to, uh, to get out and, uh, go for the swim.  I think, uh, there is
something to this endorphins,

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  uh, thing, but, uh, when I'm exercising regularly, I, I feel the need to
do,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  to do more exercise.

A.105:  And then when you don't for some reason you feel real lethargic.

B.106:  Yeah [clicking].

A.107:  It seems like, [clicking] like the, the, the less you exercise, the tireder
you are [laughter] for some reas-, yeah, yeah, that's true.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  Sometimes I find I have to kick myself, though, to get started, and once I
get started, you know, it's, it feels good.

B.110:  Yeah.  Well, sometimes, uh, I've had the effect that if I swim in the
morning, uh, I get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time.

A.111:  Wow.  Do you have time to do that in your job?

B.112:  Just barely.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  It amounts to running out the back door and, uh, heading for the pool,
jumping in, swimming some sprints or something like that, and then running
back again [laughter].

A.115:  [Laughter] Of course, you probably, I have, I have waist length hair, so
you probably don't have that problem whe-, [laughter].

B.116:  [Laughter].

A.117:  You know, that's a problem with, with getting, getting that much wet.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  But,

B.120:  Well, I've, I've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem [laughter].

A.121:  Oh [laughter].

B.122:  Then nobody really complains if I, uh, if I come in sort of half wet.

A.123:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, gee, well, that sounds neat.  And you do that like,
like almost every day or,

B.124:  Almost every day.

A.125:  what about weekends?

B.126:  I, uh, this spring has been, uh, a little hard to keep up the pace
because, uh, we've had a lot of family activities.  My wife has taken up
skiing --

A.127:  Oh.

B.128:  -- and, uh, she, she twisted ...

A.129:  Water skiing or snow skiing?

B.130:  Snow skiing.

A.131:  Oh.

B.132:  She did water skiing when she was, uh, young.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  And, uh, I think she was, uh, pretty competitive at one point.  She had a,

A.135:  Oh, really.

B.136:  bad accident that, uh, put her out of competition, uh, but she's taken up
snow skiing and she got me involved --

A.137:  Oh, that's good exercise.

B.138:  -- so I was out there, you know, stark terror coming down the side of the
hill [clicking].

A.139:  Oh, really [laughter].

B.140:  And we had another expedition where we took the three little kids up and,
uh, taught them to ski and, 

A.141:  How, how old are your kids?  Are they,

B.142:  Uh, seven, eight and ten.

A.143:  Oh, that's a good age to start something like that.

B.144:  Yeah.  It wa-, it was delightful watching them, uh, learn.  They, uh, they
went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own
little way.

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  Uh, the one we thought would be the most timid, uh, turned out to be the
one that stuck with it and was the first to learn.

A.147:  Really.

B.148:  And the other two got jealous and they went out and says, well, I'm going
to go and do it, too, so [laughter],

A.149:  Little competition there [laughter].

B.150:  So they learned, too.

A.151:  [Laughter].

B.152:  And, uh, we went to a good resort and the instructors were there, uh, took
a liking to the kids, so next thing you know they're, they've got the kids off
on the, uh, some of the bigger slopes.

A.153:  Really.  Did they have a separate, uh, like class or something for the
kids, or is it everybody together?

B.154:  The place where we went has a separate area for beginners.  It's called the
Sun Bowl.

A.155:  Uh-huh.

B.156:  And they just put instructors out there and you, you sign up for
instruction, and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor
who's not doing anything, you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him
questions and they'll show you,

A.157:  Oh.

B.158:  things.  And so they're pretty much available all day long.

A.159:  Uh-huh.

B.160:  And you can either take instruction or practice or, or just enjoy yourself,

A.161:  Yeah.

B.162:  whatever you like.  And the instructors are very enthusiastic and, of
course, they picked up the kids and, and took them on some of the more
advanced slopes.

A.163:  Yeah.  Did you all start this year or last year?

B.164:  Uh, yes, my wife did some last year --

A.165:  Uh-huh.

B.166:  -- [Swallowing] and got started, and so she grabbed me by the ear and made
me do it this year.

A.167:  [Laughter] do you all have, have you had a good snow this year?

B.168:  We were lucky, um, we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania, and
the first time we went up there the instructor said that was the first, uh,
really good weekend that they'd had this year.

A.169:  Really.

B.170:  And, uh, Charlotte went up in the, uh, middle of the season.
