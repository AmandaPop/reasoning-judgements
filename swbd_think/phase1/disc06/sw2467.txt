REMARKS:        Speakers' voices are extremely similar.  Extremely difficult
to separate them in this type of taped conversation.

============================================================================

@A.1:  So, uh, describe your family budget.

B.2:  Well, I've, uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one,
and, uh, just recently, uh, we, we set up a budget, and, and we're trying to
stick to it.  We just bought a new house.  So we've got everything, you know,
pretty much we know what our, uh, our fixed expenses are per month, and then
we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain
range, and then, uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about,
and that's, that's the food budget.

A.3:  Well, yeah, and to some extent, utilities, I imagine.  

B.4:  Yeah, well, the utilities are pretty much, you can pretty much figure what
they're going to be, and one of the nice things here is the electric company
has a plan where they'll average them out for you.

A.5:  They have that to some extent here, but it's not quite as good.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And, uh, transportation expenses, I guess you own a car.

B.8:  Yes sir.

A.9:  And you know how much you're going to drive every week?

B.10:  Well, I used to, um, I used to know, uh, fairly close to exactly how many
miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, uh, nine tenths of a
mile from work.

A.11:  Huh.

B.12:  So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day [laughter] to and from work.  So
it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.  But now I've just bought a new
house, and I'm a half hour, and so my transportation costs have gone up by,
uh, five times [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah, I understand that.  We, we have a real similar situation.  Ours, uh,
have quintupled, at least.  So there is a real family budget.

B.14:  Yeah, pretty much, um.  The problem is there never seems to be enough
money.  I have three children, and it seems like the more money you make, the
more money you have, the more things that they seem to need, and, uh, of
course, nothing ever goes down, I mean, uh, I remember, I have five children
total.  I have three left in the house.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  And I can remember years ago, when school would start, and I'd go buy all
five kids, you know, shoes, and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store
without spending more than thirty-five dollars.  Nowadays, thirty-five dollars
buys about one pair of shoes --

A.17:  If you're lucky.

B.18:  -- yeah, so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last,
uh, I guess about the last ten years.

A.19:  Exempt or nonexempt.

B.20:  I'm exempt.

A.21:  Wow, must be nice.  

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  Part of the high price spread.  Uh, no, well, we don't, we do, but we don't
have a family budget.  We have the fixed things we have to pay.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And we have the things that are extras.  But it seems that by and large the
extras just don't exist.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And, well, you know, the auto budget, car payment sucks a hell of a lot of
it dry.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And insurance, is insurance bad there?

B.30:  Um, I've got, uh, two older cars.  There both, one's a seventy-seven and
one's a seventy-eight.

A.31:  Well, we've got one eighty-nine.

B.32:  And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a
year.  But when I moved to the new town I live in, because it's a different
county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways and so
it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned, so
my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year.

A.33:  Wow.  That's not bad, four hundred and something a year.  That's, that's,

B.34:  It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.

A.35:  That's cheaper than we pay.

B.36:  Yeah, I was down in Texas for two years, and I was paying unbelievable
rates for both car insurance and for home insurance.  Um,

A.37:  Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Do you have that there?

B.40:  (( )) they have no fault in Maryland also.

A.41:  Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that {pause}
everyone pays all the time --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:   -- instead of just the guilty party pays.  

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go.  Uh, here if you
have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up.

A.47:  You're kidding.

B.48:  Nope.  They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up
with your insurance company.

A.49:  God.

B.50:  Well, if you, I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland, but, uh,

A.51:  Not at all.

B.52:  especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through
it is really heavily populated.  There's just so many people and so many
accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to
answer the traffic.

A.53:  They don't even try to keep up with it.

B.54:  No.

A.55:  God.

B.56:  Not a bit.

A.57:  So you lived in Texas for a while.

B.58:  Yes sir.

A.59:  Huh.

B.60:  I spent, uh, couple of years down there.  Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.

A.61:  Are, where you from originally.

B.62:  Uh, right here in Maryland.

A.63:  Huh, so you just basically went home when you had a chance.

B.64:  Yeah, my family, uh, didn't like Texas, and I had a chance to, uh, transfer
up.  T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right
here in (( )).

A.65:  That's nice.

B.66:  So I got an opportunity to transfer back, and I took it.

A.67:  God, that's great.  Uh, I'm a native Texan.  

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  West Texan.  

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  There is a difference.

B.72:  Yeah, believe me, I know there is.  I lived in Plano, and I don't know if
you're familiar with Plano --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas.
Everybody else was an import.

A.75:  Well, I'm a West Texan.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Lubbock, Midland Odessa --

B.78:  Yes.

A.79:  -- Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  A different world from down there.  

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  So, uh, Colorado's been fun.  But they have a real problem.  Next to every
window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.  And every time you look at
a, look at the mountains --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar.

B.86:  [Laughter].

A.87:  Or so it seems.  I may just be paranoid, but that state income tax is just
eating me alive.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah, they have a state income tax in Maryland.  But I noticed when I
was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax, but they
sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and,

A.89:  Yeah, yeah.

B.90:  school taxes and property taxes,

A.91:  Property taxes and,

B.92:  Oh my God, ate you alive.

A.93:  Yeah, well, Colorado, ins-, you know they have the state income tax, but
then they also have property taxes, and they also have sales taxes, and they
just get you every direction they can.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And I just don't know, sir, but it seems like they trying to get you every
which way.

B.96:  Yeah, it sure does.  Um, there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um,
that you might be interested in.  Uh --

A.97:  Oh yeah?

B.98:  -- Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V and
he's got seminars you can go to, and they try to hook you into his
organization, which costs about four hundred bucks.  But he's got a couple of
books out.  One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK.

A.99:  I've heard of the book.

B.100:  Yes, it's a very good book.  It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes
and on your insurance and then --

A.101:  Legally?

B.102:  -- what to do with the money that you save.

A.103:  Legally,

B.104:  Yes, yes,

A.105:  cut money on your taxes.  Huh.

B.106:  legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance, and then
he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier.
Uh, he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and
haven't had a chance to crack it open yet.  Um, FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the
name of it.  Uh, the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas, some of them I already
knew about, some of them I had already practiced.  But I suggest it to anyone
who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,

A.107:  And that includes everyone at T I.

B.108:  [Laughter] Yes, I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for
ninety-one.  Yes.

A.109:  Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had
our salary frozen yet.

B.110:  Yet.

A.111:  But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.  

B.112:  [Laughter].

A.113:  You know, survival is a funny state.

B.114:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,
and I had four non exempts, um, under me.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them.  I just
couldn't believe it.

A.117:  Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now.  I was a W F
for several years, and it just n-, never seems to improve.  It, and it
doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're
twenty-eight or above.

B.118:  Yeah, yeah.

A.119:  It's really a shame.

B.120:  Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very
high payroll.

A.121:  Oh.

B.122:  And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,
