==========================================================================

A.1:  Exercise tends to be a topic that I guess I've never developed any will
power to maintain any regular program.  I, oh, I guess all the factors that
drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some, some need for
reduction of weight or whatever --

@B.2:  Right.

A.3:  -- and I haven't been cursed or blessed with either,

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  depending on the way you look at it.  Um, I've always been a physique
that can stay skinny no matter what I eat or how much I eat or if I exercise
or not, and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday.

B.6:  Uh, well they say your metabolism slows with, uh, six percent with every
ten years of your life or something like that.

A.7:  Well maybe that'll allow me to outweigh some of the things I have to pick
up on occasion.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  When uh, I got married, I was working a summer in college in construction
and lost lot of what little weight I had.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  I got married at a hundred and thirty pounds --

B.12:  Whoa,

A.13:  -- and twenty years old, and I was just this little toothpick up there.

B.14:  Yeah [laughter].

A.15:  Had to buy a new suit for it, just to fit in there.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  And it took me a good ten years to put on some weight, and any exercise,
even when summer would come and I'd mow the lawn, I'd lose five to seven
pounds --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- just as soon as the heat kicked in.  And finally at around age thirty I
managed to keep some weight and not lose so much during the summer.  And I
hover at a hundred fifty, and I'm six one, so --

B.20:  Wow.

A.21:  -- it's not too bad.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  It's unfortunate though, I guess, because I probably should do a little
less of the hardening of the arteries with the salt and a little less of the
sugar here and there but,

B.24:  Well, to give you some perspective, my brother's six two and weighs about
two hundred and fifty pounds [laughter].

A.25:  Yeah, a lot, a lot of people, my brother in laws are all, everybody is
bigger than me, for the most part.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  But, it's kind of nice.  I've noticed a little bit of love handles here and
there and my face has filled out a little bit from the pictures, but --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- all that is ever so slowly.  So,

B.30:  Um.

A.31:  But then my father's sixty-five years old and he's, he doesn't show any
signs of having to cut back either.  So there's hope for me --

B.32:  Great [laughter].

A.33:  -- maybe I'll maintain that.

B.34:  Well, I know in my family, um, my father has always been an exercise
fanatic.  In fact, he's from, um, Austria, and he came to this country and one
of his first jobs was to teach gymnastics.  And he use to make a living for a
while doing gymnastics and swimming and, in fact, in Austria, that was what he
did for a living, too.  But, of course, he came over here, I don't know, fifty
years ago or something like that.  He, um, of course it was much more
prevalent in Europe.  Exercise was much more, taken much more seriously than
it was here.  In fact, it hadn't, it's just now getting to the level where it
was in Europe, you know, now with everybody is going to the health clubs --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- and everything.  Um, he keeps saying that he was too early, [laughter]
he came too early.

A.37:  Yep.

B.38:  But the irony is that I've been overweight all my life, and he almost
discouraged my brother and I from getting involved in athletics because he
felt that we needed to concentrate on other things, more important things in
life.  Uh, but now, and, and he's still into athletics, in fact, he's
eighty-two, and he is in the senior olympics every year, and he always brings
home silver and gold medals, and he competes against people, uh, as much as
thirty years younger than he is.  And he still wins these silver and gold
medals.

A.39:  Good.

B.40:  Uh, but I'm at the point right now where I have some concern. My mother has
history of heart problems, for herself and her family.  My father had
phlebitis, and I'm, I'm realizing that I need to do something, or you know,
I'm going to suffer for it if I don't, especially where I'm, I'm about thirty
pounds overweight.  And so I've started an exercise program.  I'm, I'm
sometimes I'm a lot more diligent than others, but I work, a fellow I work
with is a weight lifter, and he's, he's competed and he's helped me develop a
pretty simple program that involves some weights and, and, and some aerobics
--

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and really with the design not towards being a body builder, not towards
being, you know, Mr. America, but purely, uh, uh, geared towards being, being
healthy.

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  And, uh, and I'm at the point where I've got three young children, I really
don't want to have to have problems with, you know, my heart or anything like
that.

A.45:  Yeah, well, I've, I've managed to, I guess, the work I do, gives me a
little bit of, well, a lot of walking and --

B.46:  That's good.

A.47:  --  a little bit of lifting, on occasion.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  It's not all sitting behind a desk, so that's kind of nice.  It, uh, I
could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being
	there.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Prior to, to working a steady eight hour job as it were I had been working
for a camp and had rela-, real long hours, sixteen years old and could handle
getting up at five and not getting to bed until ten or eleven --

B.52:  Yeah,

A.53:  -- and virtually working or playing myself to death all day.  Boy after a
few years of sitting down and then going to that camp as a camper this time, I
couldn't even do what I used to do.  And it was really an eye opener for me to
see that even sitting down for a little while sure changes the old body's
capacity.

B.54:  Oh yeah, well, I, I have a desk job.  I don't, you know, I don't have an
opportunity to walk around all that much.  Unless I take it, and, but it's
gotten better.  I mean, for many years I lived in New Hampshire, and I'd
commute to Boston every day.  So I'd end up sitting in the car for an hour and
a half --

A.55:  Goodness.

B.56:  -- and then I, you know, a lot of it in car fumes, you know, inhaling car
fumes --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- and then I'd sit at a desk for eight hours and then sit in the car for
another {stumbles on words} hour and a half.  Now that I've moved to Texas and
I work ten minutes away, um, I have a lot more free time to take walks with
the family or go bicycin-, bicycling or play basketball or baseball with my
son, and it just, uh, from that standpoint, leaving that area was a turn
around, was good for my health, I guess you could say.

A.59:  Yeah, my kids and I like to bicycle.  I tend to be rather sore the next day
or two,

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  those ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that I sit on, but they tend
to like the parking lot up at the Spring Creek (( )) --

B.62:  Oh, yeah.

A.63:  -- The upper limit of it's terraced and its usually unoccupied.  Boy, you
can just, go down hill, down hill, down hill, then turn around and work your
way back up.

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  It's fun for them.  We take the long route, go up Alma, and across the back
way, come in the parking lot.  It takes a couple of hours off the day.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  But, uh, after all that, and I usually end up having to, by the end of the
day they're usually tired enough where one of them or the other needs a little
push along the way,

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  and I'm sitting here trying to go my bike and push them too, and it gets
to the old leg muscles.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  But, can't do too much of that or I'll waste away.

B.72:  [Laughter]  Well, I envy you [laughter].

A.73:  I sat down to, one of the nurses did the, oh, they do that um blood deal --

B.74:  Life track.

A.75:  -- no it was just one of the, pulse, no not the pulse,

B.76:  Oh, blood pressure.

A.77:  Blood pressure.  Yeah, sit there in the cafeteria sometimes and take that
on your way out.  And after having sat for twenty or thirty minutes and I get
up and walk over to that and sat down and they took it, it was pretty low,
like it usually is.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  It stays real low, I guess all the arteries are open and doesn't have any
trouble pumping it all through, but the lady looked up at me and said, oh, you
must be a jogger.  And I said if you only knew.  Couch potato with remote
control.

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  So fortunately, I don't know what the cholesterol level is, but at least it
hasn't clogged up yet.

B.82:  Well, they had that whole life track thing that I participated in at Spring
Creek, and at the time I was a real mess, I mean, I was eating poorly. I, you
know, my cholesterol was, everything was borderline, my blood pressure was
borderline, my cholesterol was borderline, but since then, and it had nothing
to do with the life track thing, but, but just, I think, well, maybe it did,
you know, it makes you think.  You know, we've changed our eating habits
dramatically.  I mean, when the phone rang, we were making granola --

A.83:  Um.

B.84:  -- and we're trying to cut down on meat, and, you know, we're doing all
the, all the stuff that the, you know, all the mags are talking about these
days.  But you know, I feel a lot better.  I don't, it comes a real worry, but
these things are like time bombs, and all of a sudden they go off.

A.85:  Right.

B.86:  And I guess, looking at my parents and seeing all the problems they've had,
you know, my mother's had bypass surgery, and she's ...
