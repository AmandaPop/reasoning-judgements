=========================================================================

@A.1:  So what kind of weather have you had in Dallas?  [Laughter].

B.2:  Well, it's been very windy, and it's, uh, probably unseasonably hot for
time right now.

A.3:  Really?  Yeah see, I didn't, I don't, I thought, uh, I thought, I lived in
Euless and I thought it was pretty normal, but [breathing] anyway, but I guess
you're right though it has been real hot, because it, um, I've had to use the
air conditioner in March,

B.4:  Yeah, we've already had to use that, 

A.5:  ((my husband)) usually,

B.6:  and we've had like, I mean, this is probably typical though, uh, we, like
tornado weather and tornado warnings, and, uh, [lipsmack],

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  so, uh, you know, I, I forget from year to year.  I'm getting too old.

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  But, the, uh, 

A.11:  [Noise].

B.12:  it, th-, the wind's blowing very hard, 

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  but I guess, you know, we're just out of March, and, uh --

A.15:  Yeah, I know,

B.16:  -- will bring the rain in, uh,  April.

A.17:  [Noise] The trees are real pretty right now and everything.  And, uh, I
don't know.  I know the pollen is real high, but I think it's higher than
usual, isn't it?

B.18:  Yes, it is.  Seems very high.  It hasn't bothered me, but I know that
people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high.

A.19:  Yeah, I know.  It's been bothering me a lot, but yeah, I think, nor-, I
think the weather overall has been, um, probably like you said, probably a
little bit warm and,

B.20:  A little bit warm -- 

A.21:  Uh,

B.22:  -- and a little bit blowy, I think.

A.23:  Anyway, so we basically live in the same area so it's real hard to,

B.24:  Really hard to make too big of different comparisons,

A.25:  I know.  

B.26:  right?  Yeah.

A.27:  I just think it's been warm, and it's been hot, [/noise] and I liked it,
and it's beautiful, and all the trees are pretty, and I wish it would stay
like this all the time [laughter].

B.28:  Yes, I could stand this all summer.

A.29:  So yeah, I could too.  And, uh, gah, I don't think we can say anything else
really.

B.30:  I don't think we can either, let's cut off.

A.31:  Yeah, that sounds like a good deal.  Well, you have a nice day.

B.32:  #You too.#

A.33:  #And we'll talk to you later.#

B.34:  Bye-bye.

A.35:  Bye.
