REMARKS:        Speaker A was very disjointed.  Both speakers talked over each
other.

==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay Charles, uh, gun control, what are you, uh, for, in favor or no
comment?

B.2:  I'm very much in favor of gun control.

A.3:  Oh, you are?  

B.4:  Yes I am.

A.5:  Well, this should be very interesting,

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  because I'm against it.

B.8:  I don't, I don't mind people owning guns, I just think it should be a
little, you know, a little, a little more regulated.

A.9:  Well, you know, uh, now he-, here's something that, uh, first occurred to
me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, uh,
weapons.

B.10:  Yes.

A.11:  Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic
weapons.

B.12:  I believe that's correct, uh-huh.

A.13:  And, yet, their, uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, uh, preaching
about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and
what not.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.

B.16:  That would certainly help, I'm sure. 

A.17:  Now this is not just a state law, this is a federal law,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  controlled by the Treasury Department. 

B.20:  Yep.

A.21:  Uh, for fully automatic weapons.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And, uh, all right, now for instance, 

B.24:  [Breathing].

A.25:  in California where they passed the uh, uh, semiautomatic --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- or, or, uh, now what was it they called them?  The military version,
attack weapons,

B.28:  Yeah, right, uh-huh.

A.29:  or something?  Uh, h-, how is that going to affect the, uh, sports
weapons?  I mean, rifles,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  that are automatic or semiautomatic?

B.32:  Yep.  I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, you know, uh, people
using firearms for sporting purposes.  I don't have any problem, the only
thing I, I am in favor of the seven-day waiting period.  I would like to see
that, see that happen.  I,

A.33:  Uh-huh, well, now, uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you
there --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- uh, even though I am a member of the N R A, 

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  and they are again-, they, their reason being that well, if you let one
little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another,

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  and so forth and so on.

B.40:  Yeah, I understand that.

A.41:  And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.

B.42:  Uh-huh, that's true.  I, I, like I say, I don't have any problem with
people using firearms, you know, for sporting purposes or hunting purposes, I
just think it's just may be a little too easy you know, to acquire one.

A.43:  Uh, 

B.44:  #On, on a whim of some sort.#

A.45:  #That, that's true.#
Uh, now did you hear about the, the control that they have up in Virginia?

B.46:  I'm not sure I have.

A.47:  Uh, it, it's, it's a little hard to believe, but they can, uh, of course,
like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony
law.  Anyone ever convicted of a, a felony is, cannot purchase a weapon.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  [Breathing] and they don't have a waiting period, [breathing] because they
have access to computer records concerning all these felons.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And the-, uh, when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in, uh, uh,
Virginia, [breathing] the salesman just calls some number and, uh, punches in
your name, [breathing] and if it comes up negative, okay, fine, and you get
your gwu-, your gun right then and there.

B.52:  I see.

A.53:  Uh, but they are the only state that does it.

B.54:  Hm, that's interesting.

A.55:  And, uh, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  [Breathing] and frankly, I, I don't understand why a state doesn't have
those records available anyway.

B.58:  Yeah,  

A.59:  Uh, uh, #at least# -- 

B.60:  #yeah, you would think they would.#

A.61:  -- uh, records of, of, uh, known felons -- 

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- which are available to local police departments.

B.64:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I'm surprised that more states doesn't do that.

A.65:  Uh, uh, uh, certainly those, those records are available,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  and all they would have to do is expand it.

B.68:  Yeah, right.

A.69:  To, uh, uh, well, connect them into a modem somehow.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  I wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do.

A.71:  Well, Virginia is not a particularly rich state, and they managed to fi-,
squeak out a few bucks to do it.

B.72:  Yep, right.

A.73:  And, uh, it's, uh, uh, one-hundred percent successful.

B.74:  Hm, that's interesting.

A.75:  Yeah, I just heard about this last week.  

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Uh, they were bragging about it, 

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  with, uh, uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a
good system,

B.80:  #Absolutely.#

A.81:  #and it's# working well.

B.82:  Yeah, I agree.

A.83:  And they don't need that seven-day waiting period.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  Because the whole idea of that waiting period was, 

B.86:  [Breathing].

A.87:  so that, uh, it, [breathing] uh, the police could check up on you.

B.88:  Yep.

A.89:  [Breathing] Well, you know what's going to happen there, those files are
going to back up on somebody's desk, just ((some of)) that typical
bureaucratic work.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  [Laughter] that's another, uh, uh, thorn in my side, 

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  bureaucratics,

B.94:  Yeah, right.  I agree.

A.95:  politicians.

B.96:  Yep, right.  #I was,# 

A.97:  #So anyway# --

B.98:  just thinking there's,

A.99:  -- well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.

B.100:  [Laughter] yeah, I guess that's about right, 

A.101:  Although neither one of us are, are, uh, really uh, uh, dyed in the wool.

B.102:  [Laughter] Uh,

A.103:  Uh, we, but we both,

B.104:  Yeah, I'm not totally rigid on the subject, I just think there should be,
you know, shouldn't be quite so easy to do.

A.105:  [Breathing] well, there should be some way of checking,

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  now here in, in Texas, uh, all you need is a driver's license.

B.108:  Right.  Uh-huh.

A.109:  And, uh, even felons can still get a driver's license.

B.110:  Sure, uh,  

A.111:  So I, I don't think they are too, well, they're not rigid enough here, in
Texas.

B.112:  Yeah, that's true.

A.113:  But don't tell the N R A I said that.

B.114:  I wo-, I promise.  I won't [laughter]. 

A.115:  They're liable to tear up my membership.

B.116:  [Laughter] Okay, I promise [laughter].

A.117:  You say you retired a year ago? 

B.118:  Yes, I did, uh-huh.

A.119:  I'm looking forward to it in about a, just, just over a year, myself.

B.120:  Yeah, I really enjoy it.

A.121:  Uh,

B.122:  I stay pretty busy. 

A.123:  Uh-huh. 

B.124:  I do quite a, not quite a lot, I do some, uh, volunteer work here in Plano.
I, I have a few, uh, handicapped persons that I, you know, try to do things
for, help them do.

A.125:  Oh, uh-huh.  Well, uh, I bought a motor home here f-, four years ago --

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  -- and I have been living in it ever since, 

B.128:  That's, uh,

A.129:  and I'm looking forward to just traveling.

B.130:  Sure, I can understand that.

A.131:  I have four sons scattered all over the country,

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  and a f-, few grandchildren.

B.134:  Yep.

A.135:  And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.

B.136:  That'd be neat.  Sure would.

A.137:  [Breathing] Well Charles, good luck to you on your,

B.138:  Okay.

A.139:  [Breathing]. 

B.140:  Nice talking to you.

A.141:  Yeah, nice talking to you, 

B.142:  Okay.

A.143:  too.

B.144:  Take care.

A.145:  Take care now.

B.146:  Bye-bye.        

A.147:  Bye.
