==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, do you know what the last repair was, uh, that, that you had
done to your car?

B.2:  I think the last thing we had done on the car had to do with, uh, the
transmission,

A.3:  I see.  

B.4:  and I'm not sure exactly what it was that they did, uh, [laughter]
speaking from other ignorance.

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  What about your car?

A.7:  Um, well, I guess, the last thing that we had done, uh, was prob-, we had
to have new tires put on it and, uh, it's sort of a long story.  We had to get
our car inspected, uh, for the state inspection sticker, and,

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  uh, the, the gas station, I didn't know this, but the gas station, if
they reject your car, uh, they put on X on your inspection sticker and, uh,
you have to go back to that same station to get it inspected.

B.10:  Oh, you can't go to a different one? 

A.11:  You can't go to a different one, and,

B.12:  Oh.  

A.13:  they didn't pass our tir-, our tires on, uh, on my car.  So, uh, what,
they didn't pass the, uh, the back tires, the two back tires.  So what I did,
I went down and bought two new, uh, tires, had them put on the front and then
my front tires were just rotated to the back.

B.14:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.15:  And, uh, so, I went back to the gas station and, uh, the guy said, well,
your back tires still don't pass.

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  And I said, no, you've got to be kidding because I, I just moved them, and
I told him what I did, and he got his little gauge out and said, well, these
don't pass.

B.18:  Oh, my.

A.19:  So, then I had to go back and buy two more,

B.20:  Buy two more [laughter].  

A.21:  oh, boy I was so frustrated with that, but, uh, besides routine oil
changes, I guess, that was about the, uh, the last, last major thing that
we've had done to the car.

B.22:  Well, that, I have forgotten, um, I, I have a little station wagon that I
drive to work and my husband has a, a van that he uses in his business,

A.23:  I see.  

B.24:  and he had a similar experience to yours just, I think it was last week
or, or, it certainly was in the last come of weeks,

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  uh, went to get his, uh, sticker renewed and had a couple little things
like the clip that holds the, uh, oh, the muffler pipes,

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  up,

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  had broken or sheared or whatever and they measured the tread, and I
don't know they did that to the tires.

A.31:  Well, see I didn't either, until it happened.

B.32:  And he had to get two new ones, too,  

A.33:  [Laughter].  

B.34:  so, I'd never heard of it before so my mouth was open when you mentioned
that,

A.35:  Right, right.  

B.36:  that circumstance. 

A.37:  Well, I tell you what ever since then I found a station that, uh, uh,
pretty close to our house that, you know, the guy is pretty lenient on the
inspection stickers, so, uh, he's definitely going to get my business I tell
you.  But uh,

B.38:  Well, yeah, you, you want it, you want them to check what's, what's needful
for your safety and so forth but the other sounds like a fluke when they
didn't do it.

A.39:  That's right, you know that the,

B.40:  You should have known when you went in the first time, uh, if there was, if
you needed four tires, okay, fine, but tell me all at the same time.

A.41:  Exactly.  And, uh, I don't know it made me sort of question, you know,
their, their techniques for testing the cars.  Someone thought they were just
trying to get to me.  And, uh, I know they probably weren't but that's, uh,
((the outlook)),

B.42:  You can't help feeling that way [laughter].  

A.43:  yeah, yeah that's right.  And plus me being a, uh, not a mechanic, you
know, I, I always, uh, have the feeling that people are out to get to me and I
don't know any better, you know, so,

B.44:  That's, yeah, that's a common feeling.  I, I empathize because, um, I'm
real glad my husband knows something about cars,

A.45:  [Laughter].  

B.46:  but when I go in I feel really at a loss,

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  and, and if we take my car in to be fixed, he'll, he'll tell them what he
wants and then he'll stay, well, well, call my wife if there's anything else
that needs to be done [laughter],

A.49:  Oh, really?  [Laughter].  

B.50:  and then they call me at work, because he, he doesn't work near, uh, uh,
doesn't,

A.51:  Have a phone. 

B.52:  have an office,

A.53:  I see.  

B.54:  yeah, a phone.  And, and so they'll call me and say, well, Mrs. Parker,
we've got some good news and we've got some bad news,

A.55:  [Laughter].  

B.56:  the problem we thought about this morning, is not a problem, but the real
problem is,

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  uh, and so the only way, that I, the only thing I know to do is, if, if
it sounds plausible, I'll say go ahead and do it but save me the parts or,

A.59:  Right.  

B.60:  something, so I can have him,

A.61:  Right.  

B.62:  look at it.  That's the only thing that saved us is his background there.

A.63:  I see.  Well, I, I wish I would have been paying more attention when I was
out messing around with, uh, my Dad when he was, uh, out looking at the cars,
he, he's a pretty good little handy man, but, uh, I, I never did pay any
attention, I never really was very interested in cars, so, uh, I'm, I'm just
the type that if it's got gas in it, it should,

B.64:  [Laughter] that's,

A.65:  it should be going, 

B.66:  That's, 

A.67:  and I need to be better because, uh, uh, we just bought it, my wife and I
just bought a new car and, uh, you know, we want to take real good care of it,
so, uh,

B.68:  Sure. 

A.69:  uh, I'm trying to have the oil changed at, the, the right times,

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  and things like that.

B.72:  All that scheduled maintenance ((right)).

A.73:  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, that, uh, thirty or forty dollars you
have to pay every so many months to, to keep the thing in hopefully good
shape, but, uh, I, I guess it would be better to pay it out now than a big
lump sum,

B.74:  That the,

A.75:  down the road.

B.76:  that's the truth. 

A.77:  But,

B.78:  I always wanted to know a little bit more, but I think it was more to
showoff,

A.79:  Yeah, I understand [laughter].

B.80:  when I was growing up.  And I, before I was married I was teaching
school, and teaching down in Corpus Christi, and I wanted to be able to at
least change a flat tire,

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  between Arlington, where my family lived, and down there.  And so I, I,
one day I had told my brother, I said now, I know everybody's suppose to
change tire, ((no help)), but I said, I can't do that, will you help me, will
you show me.

A.83:  [Laughter].  

B.84:  And so I had it out there and he was helping and mother came to the door
and said, Larry you've got a phone call, so he went in to talk to one of his
many friends,

A.85:  Right.  

B.86:  and I, I'm there, I'm there with this tire off,

A.87:  Oh, Lord [laughter].  

B.88:  [Laughter] so I thought, I have better things to do, I can do this
myself, and so, oh, I guess I was getting ready to start, that was it, it
wasn't even off so I started,

A.89:  Just taking it off.  

B.90:  jacking it up and, and so forth, and somehow or the other the, the jack,
since it's one of those that,

A.91:  Oh, Lord.  

B.92:  has the ratchet kind of thing, 

A.93:  Right.  

B.94:  [Breathing] and I reached out to grab it, and it caught the, the webbing
between my thumb and my, my forefinger,

A.95:  Oh.  

B.96:  it caught the, and I couldn't do anything, I, fortunately it was loss, it
was no longer under the car, and I, I could not get my, my, I could just see
me for the rest of my life with this jack attached,

A.97:  [Laughter] Oh, ((Lord)).  

B.98:  to my hand.  And I couldn't see anybody on the street nor (( )) kids all
over, so I went to the, to the door, and it was summertime, the air
conditioner was on, the door was closed, and I couldn't knock because I had to
hold the jack with the other hand [laughter],

A.99:  Oh, jeez.  

B.100:  I finally, with my elbow, rang the doorbell and mother came to the door
and I wouldn't let her touch me [laughter],

A.101:  [Laughter].  

B.102:  I wanted my brother to help me with this.  That was, he took the phone
down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate,

A.103:  [Laughter].  

B.104:  my hand, but, oh, I was scared to death,

A.105:  That's hilarious.  

B.106:  I, I could see them cutting out, my whole palm,

A.107:  To, to get that jack out,

B.108:  just to get this little ((flap of skin)) out [laughter].  

A.109:  that's all right.  Oh, that's a funny story. 

B.110:  So, that's, that's how mechanical I am.  

A.111:  [Laughter].

B.112:  And that was, oh, that was twenty-five years ago so,

A.113:  Oh, Lord.  

B.114:  I, I've not tried it since. 

A.115:  [Laughter]. 

B.116:  Oh, plus, plus before this, I had put all the lugs back in place,

A.117:  Right.  

B.118:  but I had the wrong side out, I didn't know there was a right and wrong
side,

A.119:  Oh, Lord.  

B.120:  the thread worked. 

A.121:  Oh, jeez.  

B.122:  And so I was so proud after she got me extricated, he looked, and went out
there to check it over, and he just laughed.  ((He said)), Sissy, I'm sorry,

A.123:  (( )), huh? 

B.124:  but we're going to redo this.

A.125:  Oh, jeez.  All that work and.

B.126:  So, uh, listen I'll call Triple A, uh, auto,

A.127:  That's right, 

B.128:  club, any time [laughter].

A.129:  any time, that's right.  Well, that's, uh, that's the way I feel, I, I
feel like I, I work hard enough and make enough money, I ca-, I can pay
somebody to take care of my cars.  So, um,

B.130:  It will save your fingers [laughter] trust me. 

A.131:  That's right [laughter].  That's right.  Well, hey I appreciate the
conversation.

B.132:  Well I enjoyed it, ((Jay)). 

A.133:  All righty. 

B.134:  Thank you. 

A.135:  #Bye, bye.# 

B.136:  #Bye, bye.#
