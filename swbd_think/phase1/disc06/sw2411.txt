==========================================================================

A.1:  All right [child_crying].

B.2:  So, let me guess, it's the Dallas Cowboys.

A.3:  No.

B.4:  No.

A.5:  No, not originally from Texas.

B.6:  Oh, okay.

A.7:  Uh, either San Francisco or Miami.

B.8:  Okay.

A.9:  Now, San Francisco I think's almost everybody's favorite.  And, uh,

B.10:  Uh, I don't know.

A.11:  Not many people know about Miami [laughter].

B.12:  I used to be a big Miami fan when they, back in the seventies when they
were real good.

A.13:  Larry Csonka and all them?

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  They were my favorite team for a while.

A.17:  Well, I didn't get, uh, [talking] {in background} into football until 
about Danny, Dan Marino's first year.

B.18:  Okay.  Are you, you used to live in Miami?

A.19:  No.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  Originally from Louisville, Kentucky.

B.22:  Okay.

A.23:  No, just, uh, I liked them.

B.24:  Yeah.  My biggest team ever, my favorite was, uh, the Los Angeles Rams.

A.25:  They're pretty good.  I like (( )).

B.26:  Yeah, I never lived anywhere near Los Angeles [laughter].

A.27:  I liked Eric Dik-, Dickerson.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  Uh,

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  I don't know [/child_crying].

B.32:  But I think they're on the down slide.  I don't know [sniffing].

A.33:  I think the team coming up is the Raiders.

B.34:  The Raiders, huh?

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Um.

A.37:  He's getting some teams togeth-, some,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  people together there.

B.40:  I think the, the team I like rooting for the best, which I don't, I don't
know if they really are the, a good team but they're an underdog, that's why I
like them, is the Philadelphia Eagles.

A.41:  Sometimes.  I don't like Randall Cunningham.

B.42:  You don't like him?

A.43:  No.

B.44:  I like him.

A.45:  Uh,

B.46:  I like him because he's reckless.

A.47:  I think that's why I don't like him [child].

B.48:  Okay.

A.49:  Now, my underdog team is the Broncos.

B.50:  The Broncos, oh, yuck, I hate them.

A.51:  Well, people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl.

B.52:  Yeah.  I used to live in Colorado and I, I kind of rooted against them and
everyone else couldn't understand why because the people out there are really
serious about them.

A.53:  Oh, yeah, I know.

B.54:  So I,

A.55:  My sister lived in Colorado for a little while and, uh, I don't know, she
said they go crazy.

B.56:  Yeah.  I had fun rooting against them.  It was [sniffing],

A.57:  Yeah, you'd have the whole town on you, didn't you?

B.58:  [Laughter] It was kind of funny because I wasn't from Colorado but, um,

A.59:  Well, I, I don't know, I've never been to any, [clanging] a game or
anything like.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  I just, uh,

B.62:  I've gone to a few games.  I, not in a while.  Went to, uh, actually went
to a play-off game once.

A.63:  That would've been great.

B.64:  When we lived, I lived in Maryland and we saw the Raiders play the Colts in
the play-off.

A.65:  When was this?

B.66:  It was like, uh, at least ten years ago.

A.67:  Okay.

B.68:  It went into double overtime [laughter].

A.69:  I bet that was a good one.

B.70:  Yeah, it was a great game.

A.71:  I like those close games.  Like (( )),

B.72:  So who do you think's going to win this year?

A.73:  [TV] This year, that's a toss-up between, uh, the Giants with them trying
to repeat --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- and, oh, I hate to hazard a other guess.  Uh, I'm trying to go through
and see who's got who.  Uh, I'd say the Raiders but I doubt it.  I think
they're going to be next year.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Uh, San Francisco might try to make a run back but I doubt it.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  They've lost too many people.

B.80:  Yeah.  I think Buffalo's got a pretty good shot --

A.81:  Yeah, yeah.

B.82:  -- if they hold together.

A.83:  Uh, I forget who their quarterback is.  I can see his face.

B.84:  Yeah, I can't remember his name either.

A.85:  What is his, uh, let's see,

B.86:  They have the defense to do it.

A.87:  Yeah, well, uh, if I could think of some of their names.

B.88:  Bruce Smith.

A.89:  Bruce Smith.  He's a guard, isn't he?

B.90:  No, he's a defensive end.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  He's a big mean guy [laughter].

A.93:  Uh, shoot, I can't even think who's quarter-, uh, the, uh, darn, uh, coach
name for the Bills.

B.94:  Um, isn't it Marv Levy?

A.95:  Yeah, I,

B.96:  Yeah, that's it.

A.97:  think so.

B.98:  I had fun,

A.99:  (( )).

B.100:  watching the Super Bowl last year because the, the Giants' coach looks like
my sister's boyfriend.  I'm like, what is he,

A.101:  The what?

B.102:  doing?  What's ((Matt)) doing out there [laughter]?  Called her up and
said, hey, what's your boyfriend doing out in T V.

A.103:  Now, who, who was this?

B.104:  Uh, the Giants' coach.  Um, what's his name?  I can't think of his name.

A.105:  Oh, Bill Parcells.

B.106:  Bill Parcells, yeah.  My sister's boyfriend looks like him [laughter].

A.107:  Oh, okay.

B.108:  So I had fun laughing at it [laughter].

A.109:  All right.  I, I didn't catch that for a minute.

B.110:  Yeah. [sniffing] Looks like him, a lot younger but,

A.111:  Yeah, well, there's one team that I out and out hate and that's the Bears.

B.112:  You hate the Bears?  I don't really like the Bears either.

A.113:  Uh, Mike Ditka, I don't like the way he treats people.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I didn't like him from, uh, oh, one year when, uh, McMahon was real big for
the Bears.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  And, uh, he had put Doug Flutie in --

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  -- and Doug Flutie had called a time-out.

B.120:  Huh.

A.121:  You know, he was in trouble, the time was running out on the clock and he
goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his
back on him and walks away.

B.122:  Huh.

A.123:  And I didn't think that's,

B.124:  No, I mean that's,

A.125:  You don't do that.

B.126:  not what a team is about.

A.127:  Uh, (( )) you know,

B.128:  I mean, if a guy screws up, you got to say, okay, you screwed up, what do
we do now and move on.

A.129:  You know, I played softball and I screwed up coming around third base one
time --

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  -- and the, uh, the coach actually called time-out and came and tapped my
tail with her foot and said, you know, pointed that finger and ((went))
((ah-ya-ya-ya)), you know, and I thought, okay [laughter] you know.

B.132:  So, that's better than ignoring you, I think.

A.133:  Yeah, well, it didn't hurt and she was more, you know, we was in a, uh, it
was a play-off of a sort, I guess.

B.134:  Huh.

A.135:  Yeah, we was down in there in North Carolina --

B.136:  Huh.

A.137:  -- uh, for the, uh, nationals.

B.138:  Wow.

A.139:  I'm trying to think where we were.  I don't remember where we were.

B.140:  Huh.  Well, Raleigh just got a, uh, one of the new football teams, the new
World whatever it is, World Football League.

A.141:  World League?

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  But Raleigh Sky-, Raleigh Durham Skyhawks [laughter].

A.145:  Have you watched any of those games?

B.146:  I watched a little bit this weekend, a few minutes of the one game.

A.147:  Oh.  I've watched the New Jersey and New York teams, you know, i-, they're
combined.

B.148:  Yeah, tha-, that's who was playing.

A.149:  And I've watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at
times.

B.150:  [Laughter].

A.151:  Uh, they don't look like they know what they're doing.

B.152:  Huh.

A.153:  And I know they do.  They've got to know.

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  But I watched them when they was playing that team over there in New
England, I think is where it was, and, uh, last week I watched them play --

B.156:  Huh [tapping].

A.157:  -- and they just, they looked terrible.  But they got the, the N F L
backing them so they might make it.

B.158:  Huh.  Yeah, that would be interesting to see.  I'm, uh, every attempt so
far, I think, has failed [laughter] at a second football league  [Noises] {in
background}.

A.159:  Yeah, well, well, uh, that's how I got to liking Doug Flutie.  He was
playing for the Generals --

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  -- on, uh, the, uh, U S F L.

B.162:  Uh-huh.

A.163:  And down in Memphis they had a, uh, team called the Showboats.

B.164:  Yeah, I remember that.

A.165:  And, uh, you know, I didn't care for the Showboats much but I did like a
couple of their players.

B.166:  Huh.

A.167:  Uh, and a couple of them even went to the, uh, N F L.  I just don't
remember their names.

B.168:  Huh.

A.169:  Uh, Doug Flutie's the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason.

B.170:  Huh.

A.171:  Uh, I think that's because of what Ditka done to him.  That just,

B.172:  Yeah.

A.173:  Put it in my head and kept it there.  But, uh, I don't know.

B.174:  Well, it will be interesting seeing these games across the, you know, from
London or wherever, Spain.

A.175:  Yeah, well, I, that, the London Knights, I think, is who it is.

B.176:  Uh-huh.

A.177:  Uh, they were a fairly decent looking team.

B.178:  Huh.

A.179:  They take the football serious.

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  Uh, shoot, I don't remember, remember what the score,

B.182:  Well, they have a whole nation behind them, you got to remember that,
instead of just, you know, one section of the country like we have.

A.183:  Yeah, that's true.  I never thought of it like that.

B.184:  They don't, they don't have another football team to root for, no
competition, yeah, so they're going to have a lot more support over there.

A.185:  Well, I know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious, I
mean.

B.186:  Yeah, definitely.

A.187:  So I guess they would take it serious.  I, I never thought of it like that.
I guess the next time somebody starts harping down, I'll just bring that up.

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  That's a good come back, thank you.

B.190:  All right [laughter].

A.191:  [Laughter].

B.192:  All right, sounds good.

A.193:  What about your kickers?

B.194:  Huh?

A.195:  Kickers on so-, football teams.

B.196:  Kickers?  Huh, I don't know, I hadn't thought too much about that.  I
always liked Matt Bahr because he went to Penn State.  I like Penn State.

A.197:  Oh.

B.198:  My da-, both my mom and dad went to Penn State so,

A.199:  I, I've, I've barely made it out of high school [laughter].

B.200:  Uh-huh.

A.201:  Uh, but I like, uh, Reggie Roby.

B.202:  Reggie Roby, who does he play for?

A.203:  He, Miami.

B.204:  Okay.

A.205:  Uh, at times I like Kevin ((Butler)) on the Bears.

B.206:  Huh.

A.207:  You know, there are some teams, uh, some guys I like on the Bears.

B.208:  Uh-huh.

A.209:  He's, he's all right.  But they got, uh, {pause} uh, what's his name?  I
was going to mention Majkowski but he's a quarterback.  Oh, well, I can't
think of his name.

B.210:  Huh.

A.211:  Can't even think of what team he plays for either.

B.212:  Huh.

A.213:  [Laughter] that's real bright {pause}.

B.214:  Huh.  All right.  Well, listen, I've got to go.  Yeah, well, It was good
talking to you.

A.215:  All right, bye-bye.

B.216:  Bye-bye.
