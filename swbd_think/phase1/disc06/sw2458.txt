was difficult to transcribe at times.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Hell, air pollution tends to be a, a topic that, uh, some people have a lot
to say on and some don't care much for it at all, but, uh, I found that
there's, there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as
air pollution and one thing it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit
but if you can just keep the automotive vehicles going properly instead of,
uh, letting them rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke
cars do that would, uh, make quite a difference we all seem to have one or
more of those things.  And, then we have a variety of people at least in this
part of country that, uh, love their fireplaces, and we burn off an awful lot
of, uh, acreage of wood and put it up in smoke and on a proper day as far as
the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a
neighborhood, that's just sickening really, I mean, it may be pleasant inside
but it stinks outside.  So, uh, little things like that, uh, an individual can
do what else do you think they can do.

B.2:  Well, you know, I, I think fireplaces are great but, you know, you really
don't have to have wood.

A.3:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.4:  You know, I mean fireplaces, [music] their great but you can get, you know,
one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces, and, I mean,
you know, most of the fireplaces are for ambience, anyway they're not that
efficient.

A.5:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.6:  They, they really are but, but, uh, I live in a place where cars are, are,
I mean you know, you, you, you see a picture of the freeway here in the Bay
area, you know, at anyone given time you'll see, you know, maybe four out of a
hundred will have more than one person in the car.

A.7:  Um. 

B.8:  So, I'm, I'm a real proponent for mass transit.  There's, there's just, uh,
uh, you know, there's just no reason on a regular basis for someone having,
you know, to, uh, i-, if, if we just did our mass transit better and longer
and more complete, you know.

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  Around the Bay area here.  We got, uh, uh, system here called, I don't know
if you've ever been to the Bay area?

A.11:  No. 

B.12:  Uh, it's called, uh, BART, Bay Area Rapid Transit,

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  and they, uh, um, uh, connect Berkeley with San Francisco with Oakland and,
and a couple of other cities, but if it were to go to co-, completely around
the Bay, and when you, ever you get on BART, BART's just absolutely wonderful
because it's fast, it's clean, it's really efficient and its, it's actually
fun to ride.  But, uh, it's just, you know, it's, its, its been half-assed
and,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  uh, they need to completely, uh, you know, 

A.17:  Make it,

B.18:  make the system so it goes completely throughout the, the Bay area,

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  a lot of people wo-, ride BART, but a lot more would.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  And I think that alone, that alone would just cut down so immensely on
that, we've, we've also, I mean, the fact of the mattered is, is that, you
know, they've just got to find other fuels and --

A.23:  That's true, yeah. 

B.24:  -- and, and, and, and go other routes.  Our, our, our, I think basically
our air pollution is one of the, one of the, uh, oh, one of main side effects,
uh, are, are, are, are, you know, one of those visible symptoms of the U S
energy policy, period.  And, our energy policy is just nil, just is
nonexistent.  And, uh, if we had one, you know, striving to meet certain
standards and certain goals and really to push it and, uh, let the
corporations and the, yeah, you know, the, the automobile manufactures and
stuff, it, it, it just keeps sliding, I, I think it would make a big, big
difference, it's just, it, you know, it just hasn't hit people yet that we may
have crossed the line.

A.25:  Right. 

B.26:  And that line being of, of, uh, you know, a, a, a, a, planet that's going
to be able to continue to live or it's gradually already dying and it will not
be renewable.  I mean, we may have crossed that line.

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  And it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to, you know, to find
out.

A.29:  Right. 

B.30:  And things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore.

A.31:  Right.  It may not be us.  Yeah, we have, uh, uh, they happen to use about
the same abbreviation for the Dallas area.  They use Dallas Area Rapid Transit
for DART,

B.32:  Uh. 

A.33:  And, uh, DART's problem he-, they own the Metroplex itself, suburbs and
all, it's a pretty hefty, uh, distance from one suburb to the southern suburb,
so they, they run, uh, they gather the monies from the other counties and the
other suburbs suburbs and run the DART system throughout the suburbs to
downtown Dallas, as it were.  And it's a good forty or so miles in each
direction, just about, and they also try to run city to city with, you know,
around locally.  The only problem is for me to go to work I live, um,
[lipsmack] less than ten miles from the front door of my, uh, place of work
and for me to get there it would take me an hour and a half of three different
bus transfers, and that's just ridiculous.

B.34:  Oh, that, that, that's terrible, I mean,

A.35:  Can't get there from here.

B.36:  that really is, you know. 

A.37:  And it's a large place.  I mean we're talking about,

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  Texas Instruments, thirty thousand people in the whole area, right and
then my building inside its fairly large and there's no reason for me to have
to go from point A to point B in an hour and a half.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  when I can roll that old beast of mine down there for a lot less than that,

B.42:  Sure. 

A.43:  plus it would cost me [breathing], oh, I think the last time I looked at it
was about had a dollar fifty one way, and I said no I'm not going to do that.
Gas isn't that bad yet.

B.44:  Yep.

A.45:  So, that part's one problem.  I wonder about the whole C F C issue, I've,
I've read some papers from some, some scientist that don't get published that
well, because of their opposition to that saying that they're really not sure
that the C F C's are the main problem.  Yes, we have a ozone problem, but is
it, 

B.46:  Well, I mean, it, it, it is a fact, uh, the, the C F C's do act like, I
mean, it, it it's, it's like a billiard ball you get a C F C up there high
enough, you know, it's a, it's in the ozone layer,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  it doesn't just breakdown one, it's not a one to one reaction, it's, it's a
catalytic thing, and it, it actually just rumbles around and around, and, and
breaks up every sea of, you know, O-, O-, O-three molecule it hits.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And, uh, I mean --

A.51:  Well they weren't negating,

B.52:  -- whether, whether it is the main contributor or not, it's, uh, you know,
I, I think no one can doubt the fact that it is, you know, I mean it's a bad
thing.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  It's a real bad thing and it's just, you know, I think it's so many of
these bad things some ((little)) really don't contribute that much, and some
just insignificantly, but, uh, you know, I, I heard something the other night
that absolutely floored me. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a space enthusiast and just
absolutely, uh, am absolutely crazy about the s-, you know, and think that we
ought to put as much money as we can possibly get into the, to the space
program, and I found out the other night from an Australian scientist one of
the most respected scientist in Australia, that every time I, the U S shuttle
goes up it dumps, more than, what is it, a hundred tons of these fluorocarbons
into the ozone layer,

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  it is probably responsible, our U S shuttle, 

A.57:  That's interesting.

B.58:  breaking down the ozone layer, each flight could bring it down as much as
one-tenth.

A.59:  That's interesting.

B.60:  And it's the solid rocket propellants --

A.61:  Great. 

B.62:  -- part of the system. 

A.63:  Huh.

B.64:  If, if it were to be jettisoned lower, you know, before it got up that
high,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  uh, it, it, it, it, it really wouldn't have that great of effect, but
what happens is, it goes all the way up through into the ozone layer and then
it keeps firing and dumping and I just, blew me away.

A.67:  Yeah, that's an awful lot [laughter].

B.68:  Yeah.  Uh, and it's frightening and, and, and a couple of these scientist
down there have been screaming about this for some time now and, of course,
uh, Australia is the one that's going to, you know, suffer the most because,
uh, that main whole that's over [noise] the, uh, Antarctica conti-, continent,
you know, uh, it, it expands out over Australia,

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  and at certain times of the year, you know, there's absolutely no ozone
protection whatsoever in Australia in the last, in the years of the shuttle,
the, uh, uh, the skin cancer and, and other, you know, uh, cancers in
Australia have gone up, you know, something like, like six thousand percent.

A.71:  Yeah, it seems like I heard that just this week on either C N N or
somewhere that they, they were talking about that.

B.72:  Yeah, they're, they're, they're so, they're, they're a little bit cross
with the U S, and we could remodel that system, you know,

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  we don't have to use those, as a matter of fact it wasn't designed that way
initially at all.  The solid propellant rockets were a, uh, you know, were
time saving, money saving, afterthought.

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  Uh, and, uh, I just, you know, I think it's just been, uh, uh, uh, terrible
anyway, anyway, but that th-, th-, th-, th-, th-, as an aside but there's
another one of those things, you know, it's like so many of these little
things th-, th-, that add to it that I, I just think this country, not only
this country, but the world has kind of started thinking, that, uh, if we
don't get it together here,
