=============================================================================

A.1:  So do you have a computer at home?

B.2:  I sure do.  I have an Amiga, it's an O-One thousand model but it's still
compatible to the, uh, late model Amiga personal computers, the Three thousand
and the Two thousand, even the Five hundreds out now and I love it.

A.3:  Do you?

B.4:  How about,

A.5:  I got my,

B.6:  you, you got one?

A.7:  I got my first one.  I've been at T I forever and I found an engineer
selling his really old T I P C.

B.8:  Oh, a Forty-four?

A.9:  Uh, I think so.

B.10:  Ninety-nine, ((I mean)) or som-,

A.11:  No, not Ninety-nine, it's one of the full T I P C's.

B.12:  I got you.  Right,

A.13:  And he's an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it
running,

B.14:  My goodness ((gracious)) [beep].

A.15:  for like two hundred dollars so I thought that,

B.16:  Well, you sure made a savings there.  I have never heard anything to beat
that.  That's just terrific.

A.17:  Well, now,

B.18:  ((Do-, does)), 

A.19:  it does.  

B.20:  is it I B M compatible type?

A.21:  No.  No, no, no, it's just the old P C and it,

B.22:  ((Oh, I see)) [beep]. 

A.23:  has two floppies.  It doesn't have a Winchester.  It doesn't have
anything.  But for what I need just,

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  keeping records it does just fine.

B.26:  Well, if you ever decide to get a newer, later model think about an Amiga,
because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen.

A.27:  Oh, really.

B.28:  It's got four thousand ninety-six color graphics, it's got realtime
animation capability, there's a world of games for it, if you're into that.
But it can do word processing, you can import pictures into your documents
and, uh, it just does everything a P C can do but it does it better.

A.29:  I'll be darn [breathing].  When I, uh, I'm in, uh, Plano, right now but,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  when I was up at, uh, McKinney, I had, uh, I B M, P S Two.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I loved that thing.

B.34:  You did?

A.35:  I loved it.

B.36:  Well, I, I venture to say your, you and your kids, if you have any, would
enjoy the Amiga better.

A.37:  Well, I have kids, fortunately, that have left, grown,

B.38:  Oh, really.  

A.39:  gone, thank heaven.

B.40:  [Laughter] Well, you're not supposed to admit that [laughter].

A.41:  To them I admit it [laughter].

B.42:  Okay.

A.43:  it was fun ((leave)).

B.44:  Well, my wife and I are going to be glad to get ours out of the house too,
I know exactly how you feel.

A.45:  The emptiness syndrome is a myth.  There's,

B.46:  Oh, really.  

A.47:  no such thing.  I mean --

B.48:  I'll tell her.

A.49:  -- it's nice.  It really is.

B.50:  [Laughter] We're sure not staying with the P C su-, subject too,

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  well are we [laughter]?

A.53:  We're talking though.  Uh, on my,

B.54:  Well, how, how, how much memory you got, have you got on your machine?

A.55:  You know I don't really know.  I knew,

B.56:   (( )).  

A.57:  when I bought it but I don't know.  Right now I've got a little
program, uh, genealogy program --

B.58:  Oh, yeah.

A.59:  -- called FAMILY TIES.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And I can research and go to the library and, and discover who married who,
what year, and all,

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  this sort of thing and come back and load it all into my computer and
then when I want to say this is, going to be a present for my grandchildren.
Tell them all, okay, here you are and then I can sort it all that they can
trace it back to their parents and the grandparents and on.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  You know do an explosion?

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  And it all prints out up to five generations.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  Per chi-, and, you know, you can select the child and,

B.70:  Well, that's neat.  

A.71:  get the whole thi-, I think it's just as neat as it ca-,

B.72:  Yeah, I'd like to have a ((piece of)) software like that for my machine.
Now No, on my machine I've got a microphone hooked up to it and I can digitize
me and the wife and kids all talking and all that,

A.73:  Oh, how fanta-,   

B.74:  but I can hook the V C R up to it and take our picture.

A.75:  how fantastic.

B.76:  And then, then, then if my parents have the same kind of computer, which
they don't.  They don't have a computer but if they did then they, I could
send them, all that on a floppy disk and it would play out for them for them
right there on the computer and they could click it to see each next seen,

A.77:  Oh.  

B.78:  but that's all possible to do on the Amiga.

A.79:  Get out of here.

B.80:  And frankly, my V C R camera cost more than my computer did [laughter].

A.81:  For heaven's sake, I've never,

B.82:  But you can, 

A.83:  heard of one.  

B.84:  do all those sorts of things on the Amiga.

A.85:  I didn't know anything about this.

B.86:  Yeah.  There's a lot of people,

A.87:  That's fantastic.  

B.88:  don't know about it.  It's put out by Commodore.  They made the
Sixty-four but this is a machine that they bought from a company that got
started up in California.

A.89:  I'm familiar with Commodore.

B.90:  Yeah, well, they make the Amiga and, uh, not only that but the Amiga is
Unix compatible, so, if anybody around there is using Unix and they want a
cheap Unix's work station that cost under, about four to five hundred dollars,
then the Amiga runs Unix and, uh, besides, uh, being able to do all the other
things I was telling you about.

A.91:  Well, I'll be darn.

B.92:  It's a fantastic machine.  If you've got to have I B M compatibility
they've got a card you can plug in and you can run I B M software.

A.93:  What,

B.94:  But the machine is so powerful I don't need it.

A.95:  What do you have at work?

B.96:  Uh, I use a Sun work station at work but I'm, I'm in the process of
purchasing Amiga to use it as my desktop computer.

A.97:  So you're into co-, 

B.98:  But research work though, I use a Sun Spark station.

A.99:  Oh.  We have some Suns in this building.  Uh, I'm a buyer,

B.100:  Are you?  

A.101:  and, and I help them with their maintenance contracts and repair and
things like that.  Just, it's, it's not much of my job but it, you know, I do
come in contact with them.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  Those are expensive machines.

B.104:  I know.  Well, see, uh, the, the Spark stations run about twelve thousand
dollars in color and an Amiga runs only forty-seven hundred in color.

A.105:  Good grief.

B.106:  So, it makes a real nice, cheap, Unix compatible desktop work station.  And
see I've got one at home and everything I run at work I can run at home by,
you know, same sort of stuff and, uh, uh, it really makes it quite nice.  It
definitely does.  I have four and a half megabytes on my machine here at the
house and, uh, sixty-five megabyte Seagate hard disk and it rips.

A.107:  Why do you think T I has not used the Amiga?  Because,

B.108:  The Amiga?

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  Well, because it's made by Commodore and, uh, most people, all they
know about is I B M compatible.  Because most people in this country that
know anything about computers don't know much but they do know about I B M.

A.111:  Um.

B.112:  So, when the P C came on the market, and then it being first one on the
market earlier than the Amiga was, but when it came market people just
naturally assumed that, well, if I B M makes it should be the computer of my
choice. And they ((intend)) to look around very much so as a result
Macintoshes and, uh, Amigas didn't get a fair break.

A.113:  Oh, I see.

B.114:  Where, but honestly, an Amiga is far and away a much better P C than the P
C will ever be.  It has a full multitasking operating system.  During the
Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines, I backed up my
hard disk because I used my Commodore Sixty-four as a terminal to it like a
main frame.

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  So, I was copying files off my hard disk to floppies and they were playing
a game using the, uh, joy sticks and they never even knew I was there except I
was sitting there and I was pushing another floppy into this little slot, uh,
while they were doing their thing to keep copying files out.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  You can't do it on any machine, a Mac or anything made.

A.119:  Well, that's wonderful.

B.120:  Yeah,

A.121:  I'd never even heard of it.  

B.122:  it's kind of neat.  Not to mention the fact that it's got four thousand
ninety-six colors and you can't get more than two fifty-six out of a P C or a
Mac either one.

A.123:  So your kids were having a good time and you were working?

B.124:  Yeah.  That's right, I can do that,

A.125:  That's marvelous.  

B.126:  exactly.

A.127:  Just marvelous.

B.128:  You sure can, you can network them together and everything.  It's a
fantastic machine needless to say so I'm very, uh, high on it.  But you said
you have comp-, Suns at work, right?  What other machines do you all have at
work?

A.129:  Well, I work in ((I A Smiths)).

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  So, we're forever looking at something else.

B.132:  I see.

A.133:  Uh, I, you know, I,

B.134:  Well, tell them to, 

A.135:  work.

B.136:  look at the Amiga, a lot of people think it's a toy and a game machine
but it is a most powerful work station, all the way around multitasking and
I mean a realtime multitasking operating system and computer made.

A.137:  Well, you know, you'd be surprised how many of the various ones are coming
in and giving us demos at all times --

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  -- and I sit in on all this stuff.

B.140:  Not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular T V set and
you can do video presentations with it.  It has all kinds of software you can
use that Commodore makes called Amiga Vision so that you can take pictures in
and then you can make up your own video presenta-, Hewlett Packard uses it.
Hewlett Packards makes P C's And they use the Amiga to do video presentations
and, um, uh, campaigns, educational type, uh, presentations for the engineers.
In-, incidently Bauch and Lomb uses it too.

A.141:  Let me ask you something?

B.142:  Sure.

A.143:  If you were, if you needed to go to another town somewhere, you know,

B.144:  Uh-huh.  

A.145:  fly to a, to see a supplier and do a review there, could you put your
presentation on a television and just kind of send him the disk instead of
going yourself?

B.146:  Well, what you would do in the case of the Amiga is you'd use N T S C
output that you can get on the machine, put it right out to a, uh, vi-, video
tape and just cut you a video tape by, uh, by running it,

A.147:  Uh-huh.  

B.148:  to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can
be put right out of the back of the machine to a common V C R and recorded on
a V H S tape.

A.149:  So, you could just say, okay, fellows we've got a problem, get everyone in
the room and let them see this tape rather than buying an airline ticket.

B.150:  Yeah.  If you wanted to you could, uh, but you could do the whole
presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and
modification until you had it down pat.  On the Amiga, once you had done that,
I mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you
want to do, uh, uh, uh, presentation on how to run some piece of gear.  Well,
you want to take pictures of it.  You might want to take pictures of it
running.

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  Because you can put more than one frame into to the machine and then you
can describe what's going on, you can record (( )) microphoning machine.  Then
there's a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied,
satisfactory done, you can then take it and play it back out of the machine
right out the N T S C port in the back to a V C R and record it.

A.153:  How much w-,

B.154:  After that you can put it all on floppy disk, it might take several, and
between on how big a space you're talking about and, uh, carry it to another
facility.  If they happen to own an Amiga, well, you slap it on there, put it
on their hard disk and away you go.

A.155:  How much would this cost?

B.156:  For what, to do it?

A.157:  Yeah.  For the,

B.158:  Well, ((the parts or)) the machines, 

A.159:  whole operation.   

B.160:  depending on wha-, well, you can get a Two thousand which is, uh, a bare
essential machine to do this with for about twenty-three hundred dollars.
And, uh, then you would, uh, with some add on options and things you'd have to
have, probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty-five,
thirty-six hundred dollars.  If, unless you want to use a video tape to, to,
do all kind of weird things like wipes and, and fades and things like that
which the, uh,

A.161:  We don't need that,

B.162:  T V people use.

A.163:  We don't need that type of graphics.  That's just,

B.164:  Okay.  Well, 

A.165:  not necessary.  

B.166:  if you don't need that which is really fancy and that has twenty-four bit
or sixteen million colors.  If you don't need that that's another fifteen
hundred dollars and that's made by a commercial company just for the Amiga.  I
B M and Mac both tried to get them to make it for their machines but they
can't because the Amiga's the only P C on the market that has special graphics
and sound and peripheral handling chips inside and that's why it can be a
multitask operating system and not, and handle num-, multiple jobs at once
because it has three co-processor chips in there that help out the main C P U
and off load from doing the graphics.  See the C P U in my machine is a little
old sixty-eight thousand and it loafs because there's three co-processors chips
in my machine to handle the graphics, the color graphics, one co-processor
chips handles all the sounds and it can make, it has four channels of sound,
two of them come right out the back as stereo ports.  I have mine hooked up to
my stereo down stairs.  Has excellent stereo, dynamic range.  And it has a
third chip in it that has all your peripherals so that, if I were to copy a
file from my hard disk to the floppy then the C P U just goes out and tells
Paula, that's the chip that does peripheral handling, copy this file from the
hard disk to the floppy and the C P U goes off and does something else because
