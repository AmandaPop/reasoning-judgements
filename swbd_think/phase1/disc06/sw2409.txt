A.1:  All right.

B.2:  Well, credit cards.

A.3:  I have some, do you [laughter]?

B.4:  Well, yeah, I, I, I've used them a bit too much sometimes.

A.5:  Yes, me, too.

B.6:  Yeah.  Uh, do you have, uh, like the Visa and MasterCard and, and those
that, are those the ones that you use the, the most?

A.7:  Well, I have, uh, we've got an American Express which we got that on
purpose,

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  #so we# could pay that off every month.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  That way we, we know our limit.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  But then I also have department stores,

B.14:  #Yeah.#

A.15:  #and,# um, you know, we keep a couple hundred dollars, um, if that much
charged on those, which isn't too bad.

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  #It's# just your normal --

B.18:  Yeah, just (( )).

A.19:  -- you know, getting clothes and stuff every #once in awhile,#

B.20:  #pretty, pretty, pretty# much, uh, what you can pay monthly anyway.

A.21:  Exactly.

B.22:  Yeah, well, we have, uh, have department store cards for nearly all the
department stores, I guess.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Uh, but, but we don't, you know, don't use them a lot.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  Uh, but we do have, uh, Visa cards.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Uh, my wife has, uh, has an American Express through her, through the
company.

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  And, uh, I don't even have an American Express to use for business so, or I
use a Visa all the time.

A.31:  Just your Visa, yeah.

B.32:  Right.  And, uh, I, I find that they, you know, they work all right.  I
haven't found anybody that will, will turn one down.

A.33:  Yeah.  I, you know, uh, people always complain about American Express
saying not enough people take it, but I've, I've rarely found a place that
wouldn't --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- that wouldn't take it, so that doesn't bother me.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Luckily [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, it's, uh, it is convenient to have that, you know, and
it, and if you can do a, the, a lot more with the American Express.  When we
do, when we go traveling --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- uh, the American Express works a lot better.

A.41:  Oh, does it?

B.42:  For some things because you can charge, you know, airline tickets --

A.43:  Sure.

B.44:  -- and, and get some benefits from that, I think, too.

A.45:  That's true, that's true.  That's, that's real nice to,

B.46:  But I tell you, it's, it's really, uh, it's tough to, uh, to deal with when
you let your, your balances build up --

A.47:  That's true.

B.48:  -- you know, so that it, it's, you've, we did it, uh, intentionally.  I did
it intentionally.  I was running some business expenses --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- through the Visa card, so I knew that I was running a balance up, but it
sure is hard to get it --

A.51:  Paid back.

B.52:  -- paid back down.

A.53:  I know.

B.54:  ((But, uh)),

A.55:  When we first got married we, you know, went and got all the credit cards
and --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- of course, charged those puppies up and it's, oh, boy, when those bills
start coming in, they want a lot of money when you sure ((kick them up
there)).

B.58:  The, you know, you find it's, uh, that the, uh, the interest rates vary,

A.59:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.60:  #so much on those# that, uh, that we've been paying real close attention
to that, so we're using the ones that, uh, have the lower rate.  As a matter
of fact,

A.61:  #That's good.#

B.62:  #the, uh,# the, uh, credit union --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- credit card I think has the lowest, about the lowest interest rate --

A.65:  That's good.

B.66:  -- of any of the ones that we use.

A.67:  I've noticed on the, like the department stores, they sure do hate it when
you pay double payments.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  You know, it's like, whoa [laughter] --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- wait a minute.  Don't pay us too much, you know, and they drop it, your
balance, uh, they drop your monthly payment down low,

B.72:  #Uh-huh.#

A.73:  #because# they want that interest to build up.

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  So that's what I normally try to do.  If it's pretty low, I try to make a
couple payments at a time,

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  #and# get it down quicker.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  But they're easy to use.

B.80:  So you haven't been tempted ((uh)) to, to call any of these nine hundred
numbers trying to get a credit card, then?

A.81:  No, have you?

B.82:  I have been tempted.  I ju-, I saw one of those ads on T V last night that,
you know, somebody call in right #now,#

A.83:  #Uh-huh.#

B.84:  you know, and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard.

A.85:  I don't understand how they do that.

B.86:  And, uh, of course it's a nine hundred number which that means they're
going to charge you --

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  -- you know, fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call.

A.89:  But they say you can't be turned down and I don't understand how they
can,

B.90:  Well, the thing is th-, that a lot of those are, like they're set up
through a bank or a savings and #loan,#

A.91:  #Uh-huh.#

B.92:  type thing, and you have to have a deposit in that,

A.93:  #Oh.#

B.94:  #you know,# that deal of, you know, if you want a five hundred dollar
credit line, then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance ((in there)).

A.95:  I see.

B.96:  Well, then they, sure they won't turn you down,

A.97:  #Sure, they've got your money already.#

B.98:  #because they've got your money [laughter].#

A.99:  Well, gosh.

B.100:  Yeah.  But that's, yeah, I know that's the way some of them work, anyway.

A.101:  Well, that's darn easy, then [laughter].

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  I wouldn't turn you down either.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  I'll give you one [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  Huh.  No, I haven't attempted that.  I'm satisfied with what we have right
now.  And we do have a gas credit card and we use that.

B.108:  Yeah.  That's one that we don't use.  Uh, I've had, uh, you know, had
different companies or, you know, gas company cards before --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- but I didn't use them.  We, we usually spend cash, you know, pay #cash,#

A.111:  #Right.#

B.112:  for gas and then, uh, most of the places will take, uh, the Visa card
anyway.

A.113:  That's true, that's true.

B.114:  So I, I can use that.

A.115:  Well, we, uh, my husband always, usually always pays with cash but I never
seem to have cash.

B.116:  [Laughter].

A.117:  Or at least not enough, you know, to fill a tank up so I always, almost
always use my credit card on that, on that.  And then it's (( )) you do tend
to pay more,

B.118:  #Uh-huh.#

A.119:  #for gas,# but other than that, it's, it's a good deal, I think.

B.120:  Yeah, but they're, of course now they're beginning to, to get the picture,
I think.  Uh, Like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back.

A.121:  Yeah, I saw that.

B.122:  So they quit charging the extra.  I don't whether they, they drop their
price back to the cash price or raised all their prices,

A.123:  #[Laughter] (( )) exactly.#

B.124:  #up to the charge price.#

A.125:  But they won't, they won't charge.  I saw that advertised, too.  That's a
good deal.  But it's real c-, it's real convenient for me.  I re-, I just like
being able to go in and do that.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  And, and it's like American Express, you have to pay it off at the end of
the month so --

B.128:  ((Huh)), yeah.

A.129:  -- it's not going to go up too high.  So it's good for emergencies.

B.130:  #Right,#

A.131:  #That's what# we do on,

B.132:  yeah, that's, it's always handy to have that, that credit card for
whatever it is that you might need it for.

A.133:  Sure.  We always use, especially on trips, you know, we just charge all our
gas.  That saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then.

B.134:  Yeah, that's, it, when, when we travel it's, we used to use our, the gas
card --

A.135:  Uh-huh, right.

B.136:  -- just for that, you know?  And now we don't have, of course we don't
drive on our trips very much anymore --

A.137:  Yeah.

B.138:  -- either.  We used to drive, like we'd drive to New Orleans twice a
year.

A.139:  Oh, yeah.

B.140:  And, uh, we don't go, we do-, we don't drive anymore.  When we go down
there we usually fly.

A.141:  Yeah.

B.142:  You know, you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive.

A.143:  I know, and isn't that terrible?

B.144:  Yeah, so,

A.145:  And save all that money.

B.146:  #Anyway.#

@@A.147:  #Um,# well,

B.148:  Well.

A.149:  do you think we've,

B.150:  I think they've got enough, uh, enough information from us, anyway.

A.151:  Okay.  Well, thanks for talking.

B.152:  Okay.  It's nice talking to you.

A.153:  You too.  Bye-bye.

B.154:  Okay, bye-bye.
