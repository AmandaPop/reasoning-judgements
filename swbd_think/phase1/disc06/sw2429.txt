A.1:  Well, what would you have at a dinner party?

B.2:  Well, uh, lately, since I have children I've cut down on having dinner
parties [beep].

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  but [laughter] when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I
can prepare ahead of time [beep], uh, I have one recipe for, uh, a really
good, um, type of a meatball.  It's called burgundy meatball and it's made
with red wine and,

A.5:  Oh, gosh, 

B.6:  um -- 

A.7:  that sounds great.

B.8:  -- It's, it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then, um,
make the sauce when you're ready to, um, to serve it.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  That's one of my favorite things to, to serve.

A.11:  Well, um, I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or
a informal dinner party.

B.12:  Sure.

A.13:  But if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.

B.14:  Oh, really.  Well, I guess being from that part of the country.

A.15:  Because, I mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish but --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- you know, I, I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest.  But if
it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like,
uh, shrimp, shrimp fettucini is real easy --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- to, um, make and everything and it's usually well liked by people, I
guess, I'm just a seafood fan so,

B.20:  Well, how do, 

A.21:  I think on the lines of,

B.22:  make, how do you, you cook crawfish?  I, in fact, I just came back from
the grocery store and being in Texas we don't have too many, you know, people
that, that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish,

A.23:  Oh, yeah, 

B.24:  on sale.  

A.25:  um, you're not supposed to, I mean, you're not supposed to eat them dead.
I mean,

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  well, you eat them dead but,

B.28:  [Laughter] Don't buy them that way [laughter]. 

A.29:  Right.  Because if, if they are dead for too long, you can always tell
whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their
tail straightens out.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you.

B.32:  Okay.  Well, I'll remember that.

A.33:  Yeah, so if you ever go in a restaurant, order crawfish, I mean, every once
in a while you'll see on-, I mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's
just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah,

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  don't eat it.  But, um, you just put some Cajun, well, lots of pepper
[laughter] --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's, uh,
they're a pain to peel for some people.  Once you get used to it they're real
easy but, [breathing] um, you know, if you have nails or anything you can
[lipsmack] plan on those
being shot.

B.38:  [breathing] Huh. When you were, um, whe-, when you [child] serve it do you shell them and then serve
em too?

A.39:  [lipsmack] [breathing] I think for a dinner party I, I don't know it depends.

B.40:  Um-hum.

A.41:  [breathing] Like if, like my age, if there was a bunch of college kids  coming over for a dinner party, no, I, they would shell their own,

B.42:  Sure.  

A.43:  you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but, [breathing] um, if 
it was more formal like if I was, you know,  working environment then I would
probably, um, [lipsmack] [breathing] sh-, shell 'em or at least disconnect
them from the head [breathing] [laughter].  But there's a,

B.44:  [Laughter] Still have see that. [Laughter] 

A.45:  There's a, [breathing] big thing over here that everybody sucks the head.  So, um --

B.46:  Ooh [laughter].

A.47:  -- it, it would just 

B.48:  [laughter].

A.49:   depend. That's the best part of the crawfish.

B.50:   [laughter] 

A.51:   [lipsmack] Sucking the head But um [lipsmack] I don't know it jus- i- it just depends on what type it was I guess But you can buy [breathing] uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything And usually you use those like for frying [breathing] 

B.52:   Um-hum 

A.53:   or to put in salads or to um [lipsmack] You know make a sauce with or something like that But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but 

B.54:   Does it taste a lot like shrimp 

A.55:   Um [lipsmack] Yeah it really does [breathing] 

B.56:   Uh-huh. 

A.57:   I like shrimp better 

B.58:   Yeah. 

A.59:   Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use 

B.60:   Sure 

A.61:   stuff like that but um I think that And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps 

B.62:   Yeah. [breathing] We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks 

A.63:   [laughter] 

B.64:   all the time And 

A.65:   That's what I need [laughter] 

B.66:   [laughter] Yeah that's what I wish I had [laughter] [breathing] but in our family I am the one who who cooks And I I really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids But I really do enjoy cooking [breathing] And we um we have them over for dinner 

A.67:   Uh-huh 

B.68:   back and forth quite a lot And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where 

A.69:   [lipsmack] 

B.70:   [breathing] 

A.71:   Oh! 

B.72:   you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him 

A.73:   [laughter] 

B.74:   and then he'd try to outdo 

A.75:   [laughter] 

B.76:   me and [laughter] [laughter] we we 

A.77:   [breathing] 

B.78:   was really a lot of fun 

A.79:   I bet 

B.80:   and 

A.81:   that that got pretty competitive 

B.82:   Yeah 

A.83:   you know as 

B.84:   it did 

A.85:   far as [breathing] 

B.86:   we we 

A.87:   who 

B.88:   tried 

A.89:   could come 

B.90:   to 

A.91:   up 

B.92:   be 

A.93:   with the best recipe [laughter] 

B.94:   fancier or more courses than the other 

A.95:   That 

B.96:   or 

A.97:   would be fun 

B.98:   Uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know [breathing] um whether it would be ethnic food 

A.99:   Uh huh 

B.100:   Or um sometimes it would be um [click] oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know [laughter] [laughter] It was a lot of fun 

A.101:   Sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back 

B.102:   That's 

A.103:   or something 

B.104:   right [laughter] 

A.105:   [Laughter] [breathing] Well 

B.106:   [breathing] 

A.107:   that's you know that's fun 

B.108:   it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time 

A.109:   Uh huh 

B.110:   Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking 

A.111:   [Laughter]. 

B.112:   and they were doing all the enjoying 

A.113:   [laughter] That sounds right I 

B.114:   I'm 

A.115:   would [breathing] I'd take him up on that 

B.116:   It does except that knowing them they would probably do something 

A.117:   [laughter] 

B.118:   ridiculous and terrible just 

A.119:   [laughter] 

B.120:   just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again 

A.121:   Uh huh 

B.122:   [laughter] 

A.123:   [lipsmack] I'd 

B.124:   make hot 

A.125:   be 

B.126:   dogs or 

A.127:   [laughter] 

B.128:   some potato chips 

A.129:   [breathing] I that's about how much I can cook 

B.130:   [laughter] 

A.131:   You know I'm I'm doing a lot more cooking now [lipsmack] than I used to 

B.132:   Uh-huh 

A.133:   but that's only because my mom just started working so [breathing] she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so I try to have things cooked for her but 

B.134:   Oh that's nice 

A.135:   uh um I usually try to stay out of kitchen I don't know [laughter] 

B.136:   [laughter] 

A.137:   [breathing] 

B.138:   [breathing] 

A.139:   not one of my favorite hobbies 

B.140:   It can it can be fun I if you have the time But you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it 

A.141:   Well um 

B.142:   able 

A.143:   my grandma speaking 

B.144:   to 

A.145:   of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has I don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and 

B.146:   Uh-huh 

A.147:   they are absolutely delicious [breathing] I don't know what she calls them in I don't I'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol But 

B.148:   [laughter] 

A.149:   [laughter] um 

B.150:   [laughter] 

A.151:   [lipsmack] I don't know I would I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around 

B.152:   Yeah it's um it's in the other room I don't know if we 

A.153:   Oh 

B.154:   have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings you can just light 

A.155:   Yeah 

B.156:   so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts [child] 

A.157:   Oh 

B.158:   which is something different um 

A.159:   that would be wonderful 

B.160:   makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop em up real fine 

A.161:   Yeah 

B.162:   But um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it [lipsmack] And then the sauce is just made with um [breathing] bouillion cubes 

A.163:   Um-hum 

B.164:   water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour 

A.165:   Oh 

B.166:   So it's not a it's not a thick [lipsmack] rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food 

A.167:   Um-hum 

B.168:   That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies And it gives it a bit of a different consistency 

A.169:   Well um how long do you cook the meatballs 

B.170:   [breathing] The meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until 

A.171:   Uh huh 

B.172:   they're [breathing] uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them And then when 

A.173:   [lipsmack] 

B.174:   you're ready 

A.175:   Oh 

B.176:   to serve 

A.177:   yeah 

B.178:   them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself Let them simmer in the sauce itself 

A.179:   Hum 

B.180:   [lipsmack] and it's real good 

A.181:   That sounds great Especially I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance 

B.182:   Right. 

A.183:   I mean like if if 

B.184:   And then freeze them 

A.185:   you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend 

B.186:   Sure 

A.187:   That would be great [breathing] I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I
