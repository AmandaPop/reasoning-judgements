=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay.  Well, our involve-, in, our involvement in the Middle East.  Well, I
don't know how you feel about, uh, Iraq but I think we did the right thing
there.  I think they stopped too soon, though.

A.3:  Yeah.  I kind of feel that way too.

B.4:  I think they should have just kept right on going into Baghdad.  Uh,
probably could have struck a deal with the Saudi's and just let them have
Iraq.

A.5:  Well, and now the way they're, uh, treating those Kurds, is that what they,

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Its terrible and we've just kind of backed off I don't understand that
why we,

B.8:  Well, I don't either [music].  And it's certainly foreseeable the Kurds
have always been that way and every time they try something, they, they get
the, partner my french, they get the crap kicked out of them.  And,

A.9:  Are they just kind of a nomad tribe type thing?

B.10:  Yeah, yeah, they're scattered all over really, you got them in Iran and
Turkey and, they sort of just meander around but they, they hold true that
Northern Iraq is theirs.  And, uh, I don't know, it, it was certainly
foreseeable right after the war, I mean it should have been obviously, if it
was to me it should have been obviously to the people in Washington there
should have been some plans to try to give them some aid, I mean we helped the
Afghanistan's, there's know reason why we shouldn't help the Kurds, it didn't
have to involve troops, could have just given them, uh, you know, supplies.

A.11:  Yeah.  But he's just shooting them and they just killing them off.

B.12:  Oh, yeah, I mean, Lord, there's things that we probable never will hear
about that he's doing,

A.13:  It's horrible things,

B.14:  of course he's been doing it all along anyway [laughter].

A.15:  Yeah, well, yeah I guess he has.  I think they should have gotten rid of
him that's, that's the thing.

B.16:  Yeah, I can't sa-, I mean it's, it's easy to understand why he's still
there I mean those people over there have nothing, I mean you can't, you can't
drag this guy down with nothing.  And the only thing that surprised me, I
really, I really expect the army guys to get him out, I really expected to
have the,

A.17:  His own people?

B.18:  Yeah.  I expected some of his own generals and stuff to quietly do away
with him,

A.19:  Assassinate him.

B.20:  but, uh it's amazing that they could,

A.21:  [Throat_clearing].

B.22:  stand around and watch their forces get decimated that way and not do
anything about it.

A.23:  Yeah, it's like he has some sort of a power over them, I, I can't figure it
out.

B.24:  Yeah, it's either that or he's well entrenched and they couldn't get to him
or something.

A.25:  But he's still running things. 

B.26:  He's still running things.

A.27:  And they're still doing things for him.

B.28:  And apparently still has a great deal of control. 

A.29:  See that's what I don't understand. 

B.30:  I don't either.  It's, it's tough to understand those Middle Eastern types
anyway.  They, they think completely differently the way [breathing], from the
way we do.  And I've got several Middle, Middle Eastern friends, uh, my, my
father was stationed in Iran many years ago and I was a little boy there, and
I have a couple of Iranian friends and I've got a couple Kuwaiti friends
[breathing], um,

A.31:  So you really know about them. 

B.32:  No, no I don't, I just,

A.33:  You don't? 

B.34:  No.  I know, I know a little bit more than most people but no where near
enough to even talk intelligently about them.

A.35:  Well, aren't you glad you're not over there or you weren't over there when
all this erupted?

B.36:  Yep [breathing], yes, I am.

A.37:  Ha-, have you ever gone back? 

B.38:  Nope, never have, never wanted to [laughter].

A.39:  How long were you over there,

B.40:  Uh, we were there for four years. 

A.41:  Well, that's along time,

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  out of a child's life anyway. 

B.44:  Yeah, yeah it was, it was nice I enjoyed it, uh, uh, Tehran was a beautiful
place.  I still remember the house we lived in, great big old, it was almost
something out of, Ali Baba and the forty thieves, you kno-,

A.45:  uh, you, oh, how neat. 

B.46:  yeah, it was, it was really nice.  We've got some nice, uh, uh, Persian
carpets,

A.47:  ((Uh)).

B.48:  That we still have.  Those are very nice. 

A.49:  Yeah.  Boy and you couldn't get them over hear for [laughter].

B.50:  Well, you ca-, you can, but they're expensive. 

A.51:  Yeah, I bet [laughter]. 

B.52:  I went, matter of fact I went to a, uh, Persian carpet auction about three
weeks ago, I'm just amazed at some of the prices they're getting [noise].

A.53:  And especially now, you know, because you probably couldn't get anything
out of there any more.

B.54:  No, not out of there.  Of course these things are made in, uh, Pakistan
[breathing] and India and Afghanistan and all the Iranian ones are, you know,
we, we don't them anymore but there was loads and loads of them sent over
before the embargoes, and so they're still floating around,

A.55:  Oh, okay. 

B.56:  Yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of them. The Afghanis-, the Afghani, uh,
carpets are nice too.  I mean you can't tell the difference if you're not an
expert.  They're all nice, I mean they,

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  they make nice carpet.

A.59:  And they probably, they do it all by hand probably. 

B.60:  Yeah, they do.  Uh, the goods are, you can tell the machine made ones.  But
the handmade ones are very easy to spot because you have the same, uh, you
have a, uh, oh, I forgot what they call it, it's the, the, um, [laughter] what
am I trying to say.  Not the picture, it's the, uh, way it's woved,

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  You know, we-, woven,

A.63:  Woven. 

B.64:  Yeah, woven, how it's woven into the fabric and, you know, they have
pattern, pattern, that's the word good grief, it's been along day.

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.  Um, and when you turn it over you'll see that very same
pattern, uh, it will be fainter of course,

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  but it will be that same way and the machine made ones they, they don't
look like that.  It looks like our carpet where you just have a flat backing
and then the thing is knitted into this backing.

A.69:  Oh, okay. 

B.70:  Uh, they're nice though I, I like them.  I'm still negotiating, I'm trying
to get a couple of them for myself.

A.71:  [Laughter] Your parents have them. 

B.72:  Yeah they,

A.73:  [Laughter] (( )).

B.74:  They keep, they keep coming with this, well when we die they're yours,

A.75:  They're yours [laughter].

B.76:  (( )) I don't want to wait until your dead. I mean,

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  you'll probably have it in your will that you're going to be buried with
them (( )).

A.79:  [Laughter] Wrapped up in their carpet [laughter].

B.80:  Yeah, just to spite us, you know. 

A.81:  [Laughter] Well, uh, my,

B.82:  Go,

A.83:  My, my ex-,

B.84:  Go,

A.85:  Oh, okay.

B.86:  I said go ahead [laughter]. 

A.87:  I was going to say my husband was, I was talking for him last night and he
was talking about going over to, uh, uh, Iran or wherever their asking, [meow]
he's an electrician, certified and he's gone to school and all that for it and
their asking for these specialized people to go over there for is a year,

B.88:  Uh-huh. 

A.89:  and he was talking about going over there and I said you really want to
do that.  I mean I think it's probably still very dangerous over there.

B.90:  Right, I, I think it is too.  There's too many factions running around.
Uh, when I was in England, [meow] uh, a lot of, uh, a lot of Brit's work over
in the Middle East,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  um, lots and lots of them and it, it, it's a, it's a real financial boom
to them because the, the wages are tremendously high [meow]. I mean, they got
all that money and they don't have anybody to pay it to.  [talking] Um, and
it's tax free, and they get free trips home twice a year, things like that so
they, the Brit's loved it.  But, I, I'm not so sure I would want to go over
there.  That's a little, being an American you're still, um, you're still is a
target over there.

A.93:  Yeah, until they really, a-, and it's not over, see,

B.94:  No, 

A.95:  That's the thing, it's not over,

B.96:  not by along shot, well,

A.97:  and their sending all these troops back and I think well, their probably
going to end up going back over there again.

B.98:  Well, you know we're not sending back as man-, I mean people think we're
sending back a lot, we're not sending back that many yet.  There's still a lot
of them over there.  A lot of them, a lot of airplanes, a lot of ground
forces.

A.99:  And their still shooting down planes every now and then.

B.100:  Yeah, yeah.  Honey I, you-, what we did, I mean, you know, telling, uh,
telling, uh, Saddam that, well, if you use your, if you use your, uh, fighter
aircraft against the Kurds we're going to shoot um down, okay, well, wow wee,
you know [laughter].  Why don't we go in there and just wipe out all their
airplanes then we don't have to worry about it.

A.101:  Yeah.  Well, you know they don't need the airplanes to wipe out those
people evidently.  They just go into and blasting them,

B.102:  Oh, yeah.

A.103:  You know from what I,

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  you know we don't hear, just hear, bits and pieces,

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  but it's pretty gruesome,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  and probably a lot worse like,

B.110:  Well,

A.111:  you said than even know.

B.112:  over there in that part of world anything like this always is, I mean
their,

A.113:  And it will never end,

B.114:  No.

A.115:  they've been fighting,

B.116:  No,

A.117:  for thousands of years,

B.118:  they've been fighting for thousands of years and it will be, their fight
for thousands more years.  It, it, it's going to go on forever.  Uh,
[breathing] the thing that surprises me really is that Israel's sitting there
in the middle of all this, I mean, [breathing] {exasperation}, I, I have bones
to pick with the Israeli's but you've got to admire their tenacity to be
sitting there surrounded by hostile Arabs and to maintain this is our
homeland, you know [laughter].

A.119:  Yeah and, and they,

B.120:  They, pretty brave.

A.121:  a lot of people still coming in from Russia and stuff, 

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  Jews coming in to, uh, Israel.  I saw that on, uh, TWENTY-TWENTY or
something,

B.124:  Yeah,

A.125:  last week, 

B.126:  yeah, they have,

A.127:  you know, the, about the migration ((has)) shift and, and, jeez, I don't
know what their doing with all the people.

B.128:  I don't eith-, well, you know, tha-, what you don't hear about is how many
they turn away.

A.129:  [Lipsmack] Oh, I didn't even know,

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  they were turning any away. 

B.132:  Oh, yeah, they'll help them relocate somewhere else, but, but their not,
their, their, their filling up to fast and their, their just getting to many
diverse groups there and that's something the, the Jews didn't really want to
happen, you know their, their stuck with the fact that you've got to take in
your fa-, your brother Jew, but their also stuck with the fact they don't want
to diversify their population that much,

A.133:  Um.

B.134:  I mean, they got a big problem with the Palestinians,

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  they don't need any other problems. 

A.137:  Um, boy what a mess.

B.138:  Yeah, I'm, I'm really surprised that Israel didn't take care of Saddam a
long time ago.

A.139:  [Lipsmack] And they just didn't do anything, did they?  Their just kind of
sitting there.

B.140:  They're sitting there.  It, it, it makes me wonder and they've, they've got
the capability, and they've got the people ...
