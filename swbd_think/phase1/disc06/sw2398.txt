REMARKS:        Voices of both speakers were so much alike that sometimes I
lost track of which one was speaking.  Echo around both voices, especially 
Speaker B.

========================================================================

A.1:  Have you had any, uh, major, uh, car repairs done recently?

B.2:  Well, as a matter of fact, I just got rid of a car [laughter] because of
the requirement to do some major repairs.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Um, I had a Ford Escort with about ninety-five thousand miles on it.  And
the engine was shot.  Um, I, I think the problem was, uh, the head gasket
needed to be replaced, and, um, but nobody would do just the head gasket.
Everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely.

A.5:  You say the repairs would have cost more than the {blank spot on tape} car
was worth.

B.6:  Right.  And, um, um, I did get, the water pump was shot at the same time.
So I got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until I could sell the
car, um, which I, which surprisingly, the car was in great demand.  Um, in
fact I had a bunch of people come to look at it, and they were fighting over
how much they,

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  were going to pay me for this piece of junk.  I was amazed. 

A.9:  I think any car that runs right now is in demand.

B.10:  I guess so.  Um, I ended up buying a, um, a used car to replace it.  I got
a, uh, eighty-five Dodge Aries which only had thirty-four thousand miles on
it.  And, speaking of repair problems, um, this car has a, has an interesting
problem that nobody seems to be able to fix.  Do, do you fix cars?

A.11:  Uh, I work on my own.  I've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that I've had,
uh, since it was new --

B.12:  Wow.  

A.13:  -- and I've had very good luck with it, uh, haven't had many repairs done
at all.  The alternator went out four years ago, and, uh, the, I had to
replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty-three.

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  But, uh, other than a few transmission leaks that I got repaired --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- uh, I really haven't had anything but, uh, regular maintenance.

B.18:  But do you do anything yourself?  I mean,

A.19:  Yeah, I change the oil, and I do the lubrication.  

B.20:  Okay.

A.21:  But if any major problems, say, like, uh, transmission leaks, I took it in
for that.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  And I had to have an alignment done last year, so I,

B.24:  Yeah, yeah.

A.25:  had that done.

B.26:  I don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself, is it?
[laughter].

A.27:  Not really,

B.28:  Unless you had the equipment.

A.29:  it's not too easy.  I had past, uh, state inspection, uh, just last
month, so, and I had a turn signal out, so I had to take it in to get the turn
signal fixed.  But, uh, other than that, for passing inspection, uh, they gave
me a shopping list of things I needed to get done [laughter].

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  Namely, uh, re-, putting the catalytic converter back on the car --

B.32:  Oh [laughter].

A.33:  -- and fixing the emergency brake.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  So those things I could do myself.  It wasn't a problem.

B.36:  Now, what state are you in?

A.37:  Texas. 

B.38:  Texas.  You're in Texas.  Oh my.  Um, yeah, the problem I have with this
Dodge, uh, this Dodge Aries, is that if I drive the car for reasonable period
of time, enough to get the car heated up, and then I, run t-, run out to do a
quick errand and jump back into the car, it won't start.  And it won't start
until the car is cooled off.  I've learned that, and as soon as it co-, cools
off, it'll start right up.

A.39:  I had that problem with a nineteen sixty-eight Camaro.  

B.40:  What was the problem?

A.41:  I never did get it fixed.

B.42:  Oh [laughter].

A.43:  It, it could be the starter --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- that it just gets too hot.

B.46:  Yeah, somebody said that, um, that, uh, there mus-, there's probably some
kind of short in the starter, and that when the car heats up, it, uh, the
metal expands to create the short, and then, i-, i-, it isn't until the car
cools down that the metal, you know, these two pieces aren't touching any
more, and, and uh, and your, you, you know, then it'll start, because you
don't have the short.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  But I've taken it to a mechanic and, and he started to look at it.  In fact
I drove it out there, and I said, I bet you anything if you go try start the
car right now you won't be able to start it.  Sure enough he couldn't, and
they had to push it into the garage.  But they started, uh, tracing the wires
back to see if they could find any shorts or anything, and after they fiddled
with the wires, the problem didn't, uh, didn't recur.  They couldn't get it to
fail.

A.49:  Hm.

B.50:  And sure enough, after I'd taken it home for a couple of weeks after that,
I didn't have the problem.  But now it's starting to recur again.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  So it's just one of those weird things.  I mean, he was willin-, he said,
Well, I think it's in the ignition switch.  It'll only cost you eighty five
dollars.  But I won't guarantee that's the problem.

A.53:  Right, they never do.

B.54:  Yeah, and I'm going we-, we-, I don't want to gamble.  So I just let the
car cool off until I get a hard failure.

A.55:  I've heard of that problem with many other different cars.  

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  Doesn't seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer.

B.58:  Well.  That's, that's, that's reassuring.  I've never had a Dodge before.
And, I mean, it seems like a nice little car. It's a great deal. It only had
thirty-four thousand miles on it.  And otherwise it doesn't give me any
problems at all.

A.59:  I  won't buy a Dodge.

B.60:  You won't? [laughter].

A.61:  My dad had one.  He had a Dodge,

B.62:  Oh, yeah?

A.63:  six hundred.  And after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out.

B.64:  Oh, really.  Holy mackerel.

A.65:  Nothing but problems with it.  So he finally traded it in and actually
bought a Ford Escort [laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] You know, I've actually had a lot of luck with Fords.  Um, um.
I'm not goin-, going to sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the
world.  Bu-,

A.67:  Oh, a lot of people do like Fords.  Yeah.

B.68:  I mean, this, this Escort, even when the head gasket went, I mean, it would
start first time every time.

A.69:  Sure.

B.70:  And, uh, so I-, I've just been real pleased and my step father happens to
work at a Ford dealership, and that makes things a little easier come car
time but, 

A.71:  I'm ready for a new car myself, but I've had this car for eleven years, and
it's given me such little trouble --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- that I, I, I don't think I could get an adequate replacement that would,
uh, cause me to le-, huh.

B.74:  [Laughter] I just, uh, I was just talking to somebody who'd had a, some
kind of, I think he had a Cutlass, and he had a hundred and ninety-five
thousand miles on it, and fin-, the thing finally went.  So he goes out and he
buys a Lexis.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  And I'm going whoa [laughter] he, he moved up [laughter].

A.77:  I guess. That's what, about thirty, forty thousand dollars.

B.78:  Yeah. I mean, you know, he's single, he's approaching fifty years old.

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  He doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter]  I guess not [laughter].

B.82:  Well, but, uh, I can-, I just can't imagine.  I mean, are those cars worth
thirty or forty thousand dollars?

A.83:  I have no idea.  I know the-, they're engineered very well, but I would
have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car.

B.84:  Really.  Well it's funny because talk about car repairs, I was getting my
oil changed, and I was sitting in the little lobby.  It's one of these, you
know, five minute change places, and this guy comes storming into the lobby
there, and he says, um, You know, you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil
change, and you charged me thirty dollars.  And the guy says, well, yeah, but
you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  And the guy was, oh yeah, he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten
bucks --

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  -- to get his oil changed.  I'm going, I don't think that's worth it
[laughter].

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  I don't think spending an extra, you know, twenty thousand dollars for a
car is worth it, you know.  I don't know.

A.91:  No, dealers will get you on the oil changes anyway.  I took my car in one
time, many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me
thirty dollars for it.  And they gave me this cock and bull story that because
there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the
oil.

B.92:  What?

A.93:  It's, it's, it's a bunch of hog wash.  I-, I've changed the oil myself,
I've put a filter on, you know, put the oil in and all.  It's no problem at
all.

B.94:  Yeah. I couldn-, I tried to do that with my Escort, but there's no way to
change, to get that oil filter out without, that I could figure out, without
getting underneath the car.

A.95:  No. I have to get under my car to get the oil filter out.

B.96:  Ooh.

A.97:  Yeah, you change it four times a year, it's not that big a deal.  Filter,
you can buy that on sale for two dollars.  The oil {stumbles over his words}
less than a dollar a quart.  It's really not that.

B.98:  Oh yeah.  I'd prefer to do it, but the Escort was very difficult for me to
get under, and I didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything --

A.99:  Right.

B.100:  -- it just made me nervous.  I mean, can you crawl underneath there or is
it,

A.101:  Well, I can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car.  I
can't crawl under it.  The clearance isn't enough --

B.102:  Yeah, I just couldn't,

A.103:  -- but enough to reach under and get the filter off.  It's not a problem.

B.104:  I think this, uh, the, the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on,
I think.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  At least I'm going to give it a try cause you can sa-, I mean the oil
filters, I mean, you can touch it.  It's right there.

A.107:  Uh-huh.  For anything else I'll put the car up on jack stands.

B.108:  You've got jacks?

A.109:  Oh yeah.

B.110:  It makes me nervous [laughter].

A.111:  When putting the catalytic converter back on.  I had to put the right side
of the car up on jack stands.

B.112:  Whoa, whoa.

A.113:  But, it wasn't a real problem.

B.114:  Yeah, yeah.  Hm.  Well, I, I, you know.  It's just a, that's the biggest
hassle.  I think that if I had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent
about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff I could have
probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it.

A.115:  Yeah, every three thousand miles I'll change the oil.  I've got about
ninety-four thousand miles on the car right now.

B.116:  Wow, wow.

A.117:  And, uh, its working just fine.  I don't have any problems at all.  So I'm
going to keep it.

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  Uh, I get offers [laughter] every now and then from,

B.120:  [Laughter].

A.121:  from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car,

B.122:  [/Laughter].

A.123:  because it's a Trans Am.  They're high school seniors, seventeen years
old, and they got to impress their girl friend.

B.124:  All right.

A.125:  The trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less.

B.126:  Right, right.  Well I bet you, I bet, I mean if it's in good condition and
stuff, you could probably get a pretty good blue book price.

A.127:  Yeah. It's in great shape.  Body is in excellent shape.  It just needs
paint.  I need to look up some place to get (( )),

B.128:  Pa-, paint job, yeah.  If you're going to look a new car, what would you
look at?

A.129:  A new car?

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  Oh, I'm no-, I don't think I'm in the new car market [laughter].

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  A new car that really hard pick.

B.134:  What, what, what brand, I mean what model?
