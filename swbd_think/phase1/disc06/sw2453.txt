============================================================================

@A.1:  Well, how do you think women's roles have changed?

B.2:  Well, that kind of caught me by surprise.  It's kind, I think, I think that
they have changed drastically, I mean, I think about people like my mother who,
you know, gave up their careers and stayed home to raise kids.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And, uh, you know, played a really subservient role in the family, and I
just don't see that anymore at all.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Even women who do stay home to raise families I think that they are still
thought of as equals in, in the r-, you know, as far as the role in the family
and society goes.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, I, uh, just in my lifetime I know that the role of women
has changed drastically also.  My mother, when she began having her family,
she quit her job and stayed home.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  Until, I'm the youngest in my family, until I was, uh, in junior high
school, old enough to care for myself,

B.10:  Um.

A.11:  When I got home for, from school.  But I think that, uh, the changes in the
next twenty years will probably be just as drastic.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  You, you'll see more women C E O -s and,

B.14:  Definitely.

A.15:  more women holding public offices. 

B.16:  I think the biggest problem, uh, the biggest change that needs to be made
is the way that women are paid.

A.17:  Oh, I agree [laughter].

B.18:  I mean, you know, it's just, the statistics are just staggering.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  that when they make like, you know, sixty cents,

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs, and tha-, I mean I can
get really angry about #that [laughter].#

A.23:  #Yeah.#  It, it's probably all, it, it's, the role of women is, is in an
evolutionary stage so we, I'm sure it will eventually evolve to where it is
equal.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  It just hasn't reached that point yet because women, uh, haven't been in
positions similar to men for that many years relative,

B.26:  Well.

A.27:  to how long men have had those types,

B.28:  #That's true.# 

A.29:  #of positions.# 

B.30:  But, you know, I'm a single parent trying to raise a child and it really
upsets me not to be paid, you know, the same for my job.  Now I don't see that
so much in my job, but I know in other professions, uh, 

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  I know that it's true.  I know, you know, friends of mine that are
affected by that.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  And, uh, just, you know it's just not fair [laughter].

A.35:  No, it's not fair.

B.36:  I don't know what to do about it.

A.37:  [Laughter] Well, there's not much you can do except for yourself
individually and, and stand up for your salary, I mean for what you want in
your own job and if, if it's not going to work out, go find some place that
will,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  do what you want to do.

B.40:  Yeah.  And then too, I think that, you know, I think a lot of women who
have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it, you know, to
raise a family nowadays, it takes two incomes.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  They have to work and then I think the majority of the time they get, still
get stuck with most of the, you know, running the house type chores.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  You know, taking care of the kids, and you know, arranging their schedules
and being responsible for those types of, of things.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  I know that, I do know some men that, that participate quite actively, um,
you know, in, in things but I know a lot that don't so,

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  It's just a real shame, you know, I think when you look at the changing
role of women you have to look at the changing role of men too,

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  because they're directly related.  

A.51:  Yeah.  Well I think it, during this, in this evolutionary theory that I
have here, that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate
more in the home.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Because when it gets to the point to where tha-, the house is dirty, and
the kids are dirty and,

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  and mom's not home, she's at work, men are going to gradually learn how to
do those #kinds of things.#

B.56:  #Yeah, they may.# Yeah, I think eventually but some men don't see, some men
just don't care.

A.57:  Well, at, I, the, the, the generations that are being raised now by working
mothers, I, I,

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  are, are a little more in touch with the household chores and duties and
what has to be done so I think over a couple of generations time, it will all
change.

B.60:  Yeah I, #I agree with that.#

A.61:  #Because it's really been,# uh, my generation, I'm twenty-five and, and my
generation grew up for the most part with mothers in the home.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  But again, my generation plan, of women plans on working and not being at
home.

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  So it will be my children who really make big changes, I think, because
that, they will, probably the majority of children now are at home without
their mothers.

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  Well or,

B.68:  #In day-care.#

A.69:  #in some type# of a day-care or something because so many women work now.

B.70:  Yeah, I agree.  I, uh, you know, it's fu-, being single.  It's like I
almost have to work.  Right now, I'm at home because I am recovering from
surgery,

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  but, uh, you know, I really resent that, in that I don't have that choice
to be able to stay home with my child. 

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  But, uh, I guess, as long as you are single, you have to support yourself
[laughter].

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Nobody else is going to do it for you.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  So,

A.79:  We-, how do you feel about women in public office, do you think that that's
going to grow, and how far do you think that's going to go in the next ten
years or so?

B.80:  Well, I think that that there's more, you know there is definitely more
women in public office.  Uh, I think it's going to be a long time before we
see a woman president.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Uh, I don't think that's going to happen in the next ten years.  I don't
think that's going to happen in the next [laughter] twenty years.  But, uh,
you know I think that there's progress.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  And I'm not very political, so I don't really know, you know, any, I
don't know any statistics on, you know, how many women run for public office.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  and how often they're defeated.

A.87:  I don't know any statistics either, but it's, it's probably going to be the
same type of situation that, that, uh, the Black people have gone through.  It
took them, well, Black men,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  a long time to, to get up to the pay scales of the white man, and now I
think it, it's, feasible for a Black man to be president.

B.90:  Yeah.  I think we will see a black, a Black man as president before we see
a woman president.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  And si-, since this evolution or this, this progression of Black
male salaries and all, that was all before women,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  were heavy in the work place.  I, women will probably go through the same,
#type of deal,#

B.94:  #Same type of# battle.

A.95:  it's just,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  further down the road. 

B.98:  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know, I think a lot of uh, states are, uh, do you live
in Texas?

A.99:  Yes.

B.100:  You know because we, now we have a woman governor.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  And of course Dallas, I, do you live in Dallas?

A.103:  No, I live in San Antonio.

B.104:  In San Antonio, well,

A.105:  We have a woman mayor.

B.106:  Yeah, yeah, you do now [laughter].

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  And uh, we have a woman mayor now, too in Dallas and Houston has had a
woman mayor for a long time.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  Because I used to live there too.  

A.111:  Well Texas had a woman governor a hundred years ago.

B.112:  Oh, #did they?#

A.113:  #or whatever.#  Ma Ferguson.

B.114:  Oh, I didn't know that.

A.115:  Yeah, yeah.

B.116:  Huh.

A.117:  I think it was Ma Ferguson, I know Texas had a woman governor. 

B.118:  Was she elected?  Or was it something that?

A.119:  I think she was, I'm not sure, it was a hundred or so years ago.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  So, I, I don't know.  I'm not real up on past history or anything.

B.122:  That's interesting.  I did-, I, I, I didn't know that. But, uh,

A.123:  I, I'm thinking it might have been the kind of deal where her husband was
governor, and he died or something.  

B.124:  Yeah.  That's ri-, why I asked if she was elected or if it, if it was
something that was passed, passed down to her thru, thru ((ways that the laws
work)),

A.125:  I'm not sure.

B.126:  but, uh, I'm surprised, I really am surprised, you know, that major cities,
you know, especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor.

A.127:  Yeah, yeah.

B.128:  And, uh, like I said, I really have [laughter] no interest in politics,
it's just not my field, but, uh, you know, being a woman, I don't know even
that I would vote for a woman in the high office.

A.129:  I wouldn't now, because I don't know of one that's, that's equipped to
handle.

B.130:  I certainly, I wouldn't have voted for Ann Richards for governor.

A.131:  No, i, why I didn't, #but, uh,#

B.132:  #And, uh,# I can't say that I would vote for a woman president now. We
might see a woman vice president,

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  that wouldn't surprise me,

A.135:  The,

B.136:  and then, of course if something happened. 

A.137:  the problem, #I'm sorry, go ahead.#

B.138:  #I'm sorry.#  Yeah, if something happened she would be president, but it
would not be something that she were elected to.

A.139:  Yeah.  I, uh, I just, I don't think a woman president is anywhere in the
near future, if not just for the, just for American prejudice,

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  but the world.  Several major countries in the world that we deal with
all the time, don't respect women,

B.142:  Is that right?

A.143:  as business people.  So a woman president would be laughed at by other
countries, because they wouldn't respect her as a business person.

B.144:  What about Margaret Thatcher?  Wasn't she fairly, she was, I thought, I
thought she was real, real well respected?

A.145:  She was, but I don't think that England deals as heavily with, with, like
for instance, the Arab countries,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  I don't know all the details of it but I, I know that, for instance,
in Saudi Arabia, women are just --

B.148:  Oh, yeah.

A.149:  -- and in, uh, my mother has done business in Germany, and it was very
difficult for her going over there, because they just don't have very many
business women,

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  and, and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get
coffee or something.

B.152:  [Laughter].

A.153:  It's just, it's very difficult to be well respected,

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  and, and Margaret, Margaret Thatcher had been in office, it was probably
very difficult for her at first, but, well, she comes from a country where the,
