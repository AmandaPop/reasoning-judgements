@B.1:  Family reunions. 

A.2:  Does this give us a signal? 

B.3:  No, you just, just talk [laughter]. 

A.4:  I guess not, okay.  Um, we have family reunions about every year with my
husband's family,

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  and generally, it's held in the summer and we have it in the state park,

B.7:  Huh.

A.8:  which has worked out pretty well. 

B.9:  Which state park? 

A.10:  Uh, over by Clifton Forge. 

B.11:  Huh. 

A.12:  Uh, ((Delford)) have you ever heard of that? 

B.13:  No, but it's in Virginia? 

A.14:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.15:  Oh, but it's bound to be beautiful [laughter].  

A.16:  Well, it's pretty good, yeah [laughter].  Uh, there's quite a few children,

B.17:  Yeah [laughter].

A.18:  in the family,

B.19:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.20:  so, we have to try to find a time when everybody can be there, and we've,

B.21:  Right.

A.22:  been pretty lucky so far. 

B.23:  That, that sounds wonderful, I, we, uh, we have family reunions, not on a
regular basis.  And there's mostly in my wife's family, uh, my family's very
small,

A.24:  Uh-huh.  

B.25:  um, it's essentially the four of us makes up my family [laughter] but,
um, when we do get together and, and the two families do get together, it's
usually a wedding or, or, uh, or a, uh, anniversary, uh, my wife's, uh,
grandparents are still living and on one side both [noise], (( )) both are
living and on the other side the grandmother is still living,

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  so, um, we do, uh, occasional get together, usually in New Hampshire,

A.28:  Oh.

B.29:  at my, uh, my, uh, mother-in-law's house.  And, uh,

A.30:  Where in New Hampshire?

B.31:  uh, at North Hampton. 

A.32:  North Hampton, uh-huh. 

B.33:  Right. 

A.34:  (( )) I'm from Maine originally. 

B.35:  I'm sorry. 

A.36:  I said, I'm from Maine originally. 

B.37:  Oh, really?  [Laughter].  

A.38:  I'm, I'm a maniac, in other words [laughter].  

B.39:  Yeah, oh, we lived in, uh, we lived in, uh, New Hampshire for ten years.

A.40:  Oh.  

B.41:  We lived in Dover, 

A.42:  Uh-huh. 

B.43:  uh, until we moved out here.  So, uh, yeah, and I don't know, do you do
anything special to make it interesting?

A.44:  Well, uh, we're, we're some of the older ones in the family, so the ones
with small kids usually have ball games,

B.45:  Oh, right.  

A.46:  and kick ball, things like that. 

B.47:  Yeah. 

A.48:  Uh, one of them has made big banners to put on the, oh, we have one of
those, isn't that awful, shelter,

B.49:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.  

A.50:  a covered shelter and they've had big banners to display across the front
of that.

B.51:  Right, right.

A.52:  And it's always a potluck, everybody brings food. 

B.53:  Yeah, yeah.  Seems to me, well, the, the, the, uh, main event, of course,
is the meal [laughter].

A.54:  Right [laughter].  

B.55:  But, uh, and, uh, everybody has a specialty.  And so, uh, it's sort of,
it's, it's sort of a high-class potluck, I guess you could say.  And, uh, it's
wonderful, it's, uh,

A.56:  Get all those good family favorites. 

B.57:  I mean, right, I mean, and, and if somebody didn't make the usually thing
they'd be, you know, everybody else would get all upset, you know, so if you
try something new,

A.58:  [Laughter] Drum them out of the family.

B.59:  Right, and try something new it's not, it's not acceptable.

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  And, uh, and then afterwards, uh, usually, uh, there's a gathering in the
family room to watch a football game or something,

A.62:  Oh, I see.  

B.63:  so, uh, and, uh, and the kids are usually, uh, playing out in the back.
She's got, uh, ten acres of property that go with, uh, with her house.

A.64:  Oh, that's great.

B.65:  So, there's plenty of room for the kids to go crazy,

A.66:  Oh, yeah, that's great.  

B.67:  and, and the parents can,

A.68:  What time of year do you, do you have it in the fall, like after,

B.69:  It tends to be in the fall, yeah.  #That's, that's a beautiful time in New
Hampshire.# 

A.70:  #Yeah ((at)) football games {very faint}.  It is, it's wonderful.#

B.71:  Yeah. 

A.72:  Uh, my next family reunion with my family will be a wedding in Atlanta,

B.73:  Yeah, oh, that will be nice.

A.74:  this month, so, we're looking forward to that. 

B.75:  Yeah.  Do you have a feel for how many people there are when you get
together?

A.76:  Uh, it will be quite a few because one brother has five children and
they're all going to be there with their children [laughter].

B.77:  Whoa [laughter].  Oh, gee.  Well, let's see, I, I don't think I could put
a number on it, uh, I know that, uh, we have three kids and, um, my wife has,
uh, two other sisters and one of her sisters has, um, two kids and then her
brother has two kids going on three, so there's, there's plenty of, plenty of
that and then her stepfather has, uh, a daughter and a son and the son has
two, two children.

A.78:  Golly, so that's pret-, that's pretty good. 

B.79:  Yeah, a lot of kids,

A.80:  Yeah.  

B.81:  kids and the cousins really get along with each other,

A.82:  Uh-huh.  

B.83:  they're all young, they're all, I,

A.84:  Do they, do you organize things or, get or do they just,

B.85:  No, I, they're pretty good at it, my daughter, I guess, is the oldest,
she's ten.  And, uh, she is really good at that, you know, that kind of thing,
getting everybody together to play games and stuff.

A.86:  Right. 

B.87:  So, they, I mean, they don't need much, uh,

A.88:  They just have a good time probably [laughter]. 

B.89:  you know, much direction in that area [laughter].  And, and then, of
course, Grandma always seems to provide a lot of things to, a lot of toys and
things,

A.90:  A lot of things to do, huh?

B.91:  yeah, there's a lot of stuff just there to, 

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  to let your imagination go wild with, you know.  

A.94:  Right.

B.95:  Of course, the new thing is the Nintendo.  And, uh, all the kids seem to
enjoy that, we, we will have an Nintendo, somebody ha-, will,

A.96:  Always bring one, huh? 

B.97:  bring an Nintendo, right.  

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  I ((well)) my, my, I know, my sister-in-law, who, uh, is, uh, engaged to be
married, her husband's an Nintendo, uh, are her boyfriend, I guess, her
fianc3e, hard to keep track these days, um, is an Nintendo freak,

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  so he'll, he'll have a, he'll, he'll usually bring a few games, um, and,
um, oh, and then we always video tape.

A.102:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.103:  So, we always have the gang on tape and we see how they grow each year.

A.104:  Yeah, that's interesting.  That's a good idea.  Yeah.

B.105:  Yeah, yeah.  That's a lot of fun {very faint}.  That's a li-, li-, there
will be times when we'll turn that on instead of, instead of watching
something on T V.

A.106:  Uh-huh.  Is her family in Texas?

B.107:  No.  Her family is in New Hampshire and in New York and in, uh, in, uh, oh,
in, in North Carolina and, oh, and one of them is living in Rhode Island now.

A.108:  Uh-huh. 

B.109:  They're all in the northeast part of the country, my family's in Virginia,
and then we're living in Texas [laughter].

A.110:  Yeah, right.  Well, I have two girls and one is in Texas and she's a T I,

B.111:  Uh-huh.  

A.112:  uh, employee right now.  And, uh, the other one is in New Mexico.

B.113:  New Mexico,

A.114:  Right.

B.115:  wow, that's, we've seen just a little bit of New Mexico, we haven't
really traveled that much since we've been here, uh, but we've seen a little
bit of New Mexico and that was very nice, and Colorado seemed very nice,

A.116:  Uh-huh.  Colorado is beautiful.

B.117:  but everything in between was, wasn't very interesting [laughter]. 

A.118:  That's kind of what we found, she's, uh, in the northern part of New
Mexico, it's pretty, it's up in the mountains.  Yeah, it's beautiful {very
faint}.

B.119:  Oh, yeah, up in the mountains.  Yeah, that's, that's what we miss, we miss
mountains and trees, of course, you have plenty of, uh, plenty of mountains in
Virginia,

A.120:  Right, right.  

B.121:  and then in nort-, and, you know, up in New Hampshire and Maine, too.

A.122:  Yeah.

B.123:  We had, uh, one of the, uh, times that we had sort of a family reunion was
when, uh, was this, I think it was last, last winter, we, uh, we went up to
New Hampshire to go skiing,

A.124:  Oh, great.

B.125:  and, uh, a bunch of us got together, 

A.126:  Uh-huh.

B.127:  it wasn't the whole family.  It wasn't all the, all the, uh, cousins,
usually when, when we make a trip out there somebody else flies in or
something because, uh, my wife's family all have, well, they have a lot of
connections with the airlines,

A.128:  Oh.

B.129:  my, I have a brother-in-law who is a pilot, my father-in-law is a pilot,
um, and, uh,

A.130:  That makes it great, doesn't it?

B.131:  so, yeah, a lot of mobile people so the, so the, uh, sister-in-law who
lives in North Carolina,

A.132:  Uh-huh.

B.133:  can usually get up, and, uh, but, uh, and then so we're, when we're in
New Hampshire everybody else is in that area anyway and usually somebody will
drive in from New York so, uh, it's usually some kind of, uh, semireunion,
[laughter].

A.134:  Right.  Well, we go to Maine every fall.  I have a brother,

B.135:  Oh.  

A.136:  who lives there still, and I have a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews,
so we always have a fam-, family reunion up in Farmington.  And it's usually
out on a farm.

B.137:  Oh.

A.138:  One of the girls has a farm and,

B.139:  Oh, gee, homesick.  Um, have you heard about these, uh, these businesses
these companies that, uh, I mean, their business is planning family,

A.140:  No, I haven't.  

B.141:  reunions for people? 

A.142:  Huh-uh. 

B.143:  Oh, yeah that's, I, I thought about this and, uh, it seems like a pretty
neat thing, they do, uh, family reunions, and they do, um, oh, what do you
call it, um, oh, class reunions.

A.144:  Oh. 

B.145:  And they make all the plans, they contact everybody, and they make sure
everybody's got travel arrangements,

A.146:  Uh-huh.  

B.147:  and, uh, and, uh, I guess, it's, in fact, I think it was started by
somebody who was a travel agent,

A.148:  Oh.

B.149:  and they got this brainstorm that, you know, they could make a living by
arranging for different,

A.150:  Uh-huh.

B.151:  family reunions and class reunions,

A.152:  That's pretty interesting.

B.153:  all over the country.  Yeah, I always thought that would be kind of,

A.154:  Yeah.

B.155:  might be kind of fun.  You know, especially with a class reunion where
you have to, you have to do a little research,

A.156:  Right.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.157:  try to find everybody [laughter].  I guess it's a little easier with a
family reunion.

A.158:  Uh-huh.

B.159:  And they, you know, and they, they're really organized, you know, they
setup, they, they get the hall, and they, and they, uh, uh, arrange for the
catering and they have name tags ...
