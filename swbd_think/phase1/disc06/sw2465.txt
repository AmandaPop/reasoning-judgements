==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you own a P C?

B.2:  No, I don't, I have one at, uh, the company I work for furnishes, so I can
work at home.

A.3:  Oh, wow. 

B.4:  And it's just an old, old compact, that is super slow and, but it does, it
does it's job, so.

A.5:  What processor does it have in it?

B.6:  Um, I don't know, it's so old.  It's one of,

A.7:  Oh [laughter] what kind of work do you do on it? 

B.8:  Um, I do, um, television ratings and I process some ratings and put, do
graphics for their television stations,

A.9:  Oh, okay.   

B.10:  (( )) their clients, so.  

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  It's basically just data entry and running, you know, some, some software
so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated, you know.

A.13:  Huh, yeah, I don't own a P C but I've, I've, yeah, I work for T I and, uh,

B.14:  Yeah, my husband does, too, so. 

A.15:  Well, I have, uh, pretty, fa-, a fairly fancy one, it's a T I model.  It's
an S P one thousand which, has a, it has a fast processor in it, a three
eighty-six.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  And I, the, the job that I do, I do a lot of training of our customers for
new products.

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  And I have to develop, uh, functional ((specs)) and [noise], ((disk)) and
((desk)) top publishing and everything, so it's,

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  it's kind of fun,

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  I mean, I, I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house but I
just haven't got around to doing it yet.

B.24:  Oh, yeah, I'd like to have one for the house, too, but sometimes (( )) my
husband, my husband says usually, I work on the computer all day at work, I
don't want to come home and have to [laughter] work on one, ((too)).

A.25:  Your husband, what, what group is your husband in? 

B.26:  Um, something with the defense. 

A.27:  Oh, (( ))? 

B.28:  Huh? 

A.29:  Defense systems and electronics group? 

B.30:  Yeah, something like that, yeah, they've changed their name so many times
I've lost track, so.

A.31:  I see.  Yeah. 

B.32:  He works up in Plano. 

A.33:  Oh, okay. 

B.34:  So {very faint}. 

A.35:  Yeah, I work on, uh, printers and,

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  the peripheral products division, basically, uh, I work in the airline,
ma-, marketing group.

B.38:  Oh. 

A.39:  So, we, we do a lot of,

B.40:  I didn't even know they had anything like that. 

A.41:  Oh, yeah. 

B.42:  Man, there's so, they're, I learned so many things that they, they do,
they're into so many different things, so.

A.43:  [Laughter]. 

B.44:  Yeah, I just kind of, (( )) in for a while, you know, he had a, he had, uh,
one of those, what are they, top secret things,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  you know, where he couldn't talk about what he did, so. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  For a while but then he switched jobs.  I don't understand half the stuff
he does and, I have, uh,

A.49:  Is he a programmer? 

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  I see. 

B.52:  Software design engineer, so, as they call it, so.  But I have a degree in
information management,

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  which is computer, you know,

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  it's basically the, more the bus-, business end of it than the programming
end of it, you know.

A.57:  Right. 

B.58:  So, but I've been at it for, you know, five years, so.  Everything's
changed so much I probably couldn't even [laughter] get a job right now.  It
seems like it's changed so much, so, you know, they've made such advances in
computers, so.

A.59:  Really.  So, uh, does your husband ever use, uh, a laptop or a notebook?
Does he bring a little one home with him or,

B.60:  No, huh-uh, sometimes he bri-, he brought home a, uh, a portable one,

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  but, uh, it, it quit working so he brought it, brought it back and he
just hasn't brought another one home.  But they did give him a new computer at
work, so.

A.63:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, we, we build, uh, laptop and notebook computers here in
Temple also.

B.64:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.65:  And those are really handy, I mean, we, they, they have modems in them, you
can send a fax from your P C,

B.66:  Oh, how nice, 

A.67:  but they're, they're really, 

B.68:  no, he doesn't have one of those, so.  

A.69:  What's that?

B.70:  He doesn't have one of those. 

A.71:  Yeah, they're, they're pretty handy because, you know, when I travel, it's
easy to check messages, just, you know,

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and,

B.74:  Yeah.  Well, my husband doesn't have to travel, so. 

A.75:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again.

B.76:  Oh, boy.  Well at least you get to,

A.77:  So that kind of reeks havoc with plans,

B.78:  [Laughter].  

A.79:  but, it, it's really not enough to become a big hassle. 

B.80:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's good.  Some people enjoy the travel but I don't think
I'd like it, {very faint} if ((he traveled a lot)).

A.81:  I see. 

B.82:  Yeah, I would love to have a computer, they, but they're so expensive.

A.83:  Well, I don't know, there, you can get, well, depends on what you consider
expensive, I mean,

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars,
where, you know, just a few years ago it would have been six, seven, eight,
nine thousand dollars.

B.86:  Yeah.  You know, I guess it's not, it's all, you know, it's, inexpensive
compared to what it used to be but it's a lot to put into one.

A.87:  Yeah, it's still, I mean, you know, two thousand dollars isn't just, just
pocket change to a lot of people [laughter].

B.88:  That's right [laughter].  No, it's not.  It's, it's not pocket change, so
it's major (( )).  Maybe when the kids get in school that will be, you know,
when they start needing something, you know, then that will be different but,

A.89:  Yeah, when I started at, uh, T I, I was a Summer development student,

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  and finishing up at school and so those papers really, I mean, it was
nice having access to the,

B.92:  Oh, yeah.

A.93:  equipment to, uh,

B.94:  Yes, I remember that.  I had to do some of my husband's papers because I
had access to one but, you know, he, his was more for scientific stuff than
for word processing, you know, so,

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  I did a lot of his papers.  Yeah, they come in real handy, that was a
lifesaver.

A.97:  Well, how many different types of packages do you use? 

B.98:  At home? 

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  Um, all I, the packages I, I don't really use, I (( )) what I use that
(( )) outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been
written in ((house)) that I use.

A.101:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Golly, I've got, up, up at work anyway, I use WordPerfect
and Lotus and,

B.102:  Yeah, I know those two. 

A.103:  and (( )) which is, uh, uh, a, a line-draw package. 

B.104:  Uh-huh, I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus and, the most.

A.105:  Yeah.  You probably use (( )) or something like that, 

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  for your, uh, data entry stuff that your,

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  talking about. 

B.110:  A lot of the data entry stuff they used, uh, survey system and, and, um,
you know, just in-house programs to do what they needed.  I work,

A.111:  Do you get, do you work at home all the time or just,

B.112:  Well, no, I worked for this company before I had my first daughter,

A.113:  Uh-huh.  

B.114:  and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other
things, so.

A.115:  Oh, that, that was, that worked out pretty good then.

B.116:  Yeah, it did.  You know, I don't do, I don't really don't do basic, a lot
of what I used to do, I just do, you know, something really minor but,

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  it's something that nobody else wants to do,

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  and it's time consuming.  So,

A.121:  So, it keeps you in the company, huh? 

B.122:  That's right, you know, it gives me a paycheck, you know, it's only like
the works only, you know, three weeks.  Goes for like three to four weeks
three times a year,

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  you know, it's not something that's continual because, you know, the
television ratings don't come out, you know, all the time.  They only come out
four times a year, so but.

A.125:  Yeah.  Boy I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here,
I'd get all kinds of stuff done.

B.126:  Oh. 

A.127:  Phone's always ringing and,

B.128:  Uh-huh.  

A.129:  people always asking me to do something else. 

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  I've got a lot of, especially right now, we've got several new products
coming out, and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I
need to revise.

B.132:  Uh-huh, will they let you take a computer home to work? 

A.133:  Well, yeah, but, you know, I need to be at the office, too. 

B.134:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.135:  You know [laughter], I've just got to deal, with all those other things
that happen but,

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off. 

B.138:  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah, my hu-, he took one home when they, when they had it,
you know, they had a big deadline coming up and it was looking a little touchy
to meet, so.

A.139:  Uh-huh, well, I've, I've done that before on, a couple times.

B.140:  Yeah. 

A.141:  But that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a
computer, you just bring home a few floppy disks, you know.

B.142:  Uh-huh, that's right.  I thought that would be, you know, because it's real
nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office I've maybe been
into the office once in the past ((three)) years, you know.

A.143:  Oh, my. 

B.144:  They just, um, they just send me everything and pick it up courier or
whatever, so, you know.

A.145:  Man that sounds really nice. 

B.146:  Yeah.  It is real nice, you know, I just deal with them on the telephone,
half the people don't even know who they're talking to.

A.147:  Uh-huh. 

B.148:  But I, you know, worked, I know most of them, well, I can't say that, a lot
of people changed around there but, most people know who I am, but I don't
know who they are, you know.

A.149:  Uh-huh. 

B.150:  [Laughter] A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice.

A.151:  Right.  Yeah, I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as
well.

B.152:  Yeah, you just know them by the telephone, so.  But, well, it's been good
talking to you, I think ((we've)) (( )) ((got)) the subject [laughter].

@@A.153:  Yeah, we sort of stayed to the topic anyway. 

B.154:  Yeah, we tried.  It's hard to sometimes. 

A.155:  Okay, well, we'll talk to you later. 

B.156:  Okay, well, thanks, bye, bye.

A.157:  Bye.
