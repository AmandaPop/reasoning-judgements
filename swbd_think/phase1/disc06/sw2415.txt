REMARKS:        Caller A has a child yelling crying through the entire
conversation.  She also made strange crackling noises in the background.

==============================================================================

B.1:  Uh, yes, I do believe that there is too much immigration now.  And do you?

A.2:  [Children] Yeah, uh, well, yeah, living in Texas especially I see it
[laughter] and, and,

B.3:  Well, it's not just that.  Are there enough jobs for people here now?

A.4:  No, no, it's terrible.

B.5:  And yet they're letting more people in daily.

A.6:  Yeah, from everywhere, too, not just from Mexico, you know,

B.7:  Yeah it,

A.8:  just everywhere.

B.9:  I wasn't talking about just Mexico.  I was talking about Europeans, the
Eastern Block, uh, it's terrible.

A.10:  Yeah, yeah, I,

B.11:  There's, and there's nothing we can do about it.  The government seems to
do as they wish, when they wish.

A.12:  Yeah, they don't ask us, do they [laughter], no.  You know, and it's really
hard, I think, on the immigrants because they come over here all, they, you
know, thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and
everything, and then they, then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and
not knowing anybody and no money, and it's terrible.

B.13:  Yes, living under a bridge so to speak.

A.14:  Yes.

B.15:  Now it's true, though, that the bulk of, of immigrants are successful.

A.16:  Really and tru-, how, how, how, how do you figure?

B.17:  Uh, I saw it on the news.

A.18:  Did you really?

B.19:  Yes, the bulk of immigrants, legal immigrants to this country are
successful.  You know, they pay to, end up as tax paying citizens making, uh,
above middle class incomes, whatever that is in the United States now.

A.20:  Probably more than what I'm making [laughter].

B.21:  Well, yeah, you work for T I.

A.22:  [Laughter] Maybe I should become an immigrant and go somewhere else
[Noise]. {cracking}.

B.23:  Uh, they say that's due to their work ethic.  Now I don't know if that's
true or not.  It just might be a matter of luck.

A.24:  Well,

B.25:  But then America always has been for the immigrant.

A.26:  Yeah, well, uh, you know, if it hadn't been for that, I guess I wouldn't be
here because --

B.27:  Huh, none of us would.

A.28:  -- [Laughter] my family came from France and, uh, one side, and one side
came from Germany so [Noise], {Cracking},

B.29:  Th-, there, you know, there's only a very few native Americans here.

A.30:  And then they're treated rotten, the actual Native Americans, the Indians.

B.31:  Yes, they are.

A.32:  Well, they've got, th-, they've got the worst deal around.

B.33:  Well, most of them, you're right.  But then I drive through Ruidoso and I
think, well, not all of them have it desperately bad.

A.34:  I never,

B.35:  You know, you've, you've driven by, you know, the Mountain Gods outside of
Ruidoso, haven't you?

A.36:  I've never been, been out there.

B.37:  Oh, it's beautiful country up there in the mountains of New Mexico.

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  Oh, just, just gorgeous.  And that inn is huge and, but now, uh, like I
say, that one tribe is the exception, not the rule.  You know, most,

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  tribes were treated dreadfully.

A.42:  Yeah, oh, and still are.

B.43:  And still are, yes.

A.44:  You know, don't have good jobs and living on reservations, alcoholics and,
oh, it's terrible, it makes me really ill.  But I've never even been to
Colorado.

B.45:  Oh, a native Texan.

A.46:  No, a native Californian [laughter].

B.47:  Oh.

A.48:  But a twenty year Texan.  I've been here twenty years so,

B.49:  Well, I'm, I'm, I'm a native born Texan, but, uh, you know how it is.

A.50:  Yeah, yeah.

B.51:  We go where the work is.

A.52:  That's true, that's true.  Well, did you start with T I out here and then
go to,

B.53:  Uh, in Lubbock.

A.54:  And, oh, okay, and then went to Colorado.

B.55:  In seventy-four.

A.56:  So,

B.57:  So yes, I am, I am a longtime T I -er.

A.58:  So do you see a lot of, uh, well, let's see, what's in Colorado?  Do you
see a lot of immigrants of any kind, like, like we do here?

B.59:  Uh, the ones we see are Americans by marriage, a huge number.  Here in
Colorado Springs there's an Air Force base --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- and an Army base, so there's,

A.62:  [Noise] {cracking}.

B.63:  people that marry G I -s.  Korean Americans, German Americans --

A.64:  Oh, okay, yeah.

B.65:  -- uh, a few Japanese, a few Chinese.  You understand.

A.66:  Yeah, yeah.  But then you know, too, on a, it's, uh, of course, what I
think about when we talk about immigrants, I know they're coming from
everywhere, but I think a lot about coming from Mexico because I guess I'm so
close to that.

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  And if they close the, well, the borders are closed, basically.  I mean,
they're, but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay.

B.69:  Well, that's not really immigration.

A.70:  Well, no, that's true, it's not, but it is.  I mean they're coming.

B.71:  Yeah.

A.72:  I mean, [noise] {cracking} we've, we've got,

B.73:  Yeah, you can't stop them, and once they're here, to some extent we support
them.

A.74:  They're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed
to hire illegal aliens and all this, and whether that's working or not I don't
know because I don't hear anymore about it.

B.75:  I don't either, but, uh, what I suspect is that illegals were hired for a
hundred and fifty years of Texas history.  I don't think they can stop it by a
federal edict.  I don't think the federal government can stop it by ma-, by
waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more.  It's just too
inbred in the culture.

A.76:  [Noise] {cracking}  Yeah.

B.77:  You know, I grew up in Dumas and Lubbock, and, uh, every roofing crew was
illegal.

A.78:  I know [laughter].  Well, all the restaurants here, too, at one time.  Now
it's, see, how, I'm not in the restaurant business anymore so I really don't
know.  But at one time the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything
were all illegals,

B.79:  Sure.

A.80:  in, in most of the restaurants I worked in as a waitress, you know.  It,
whether that came to a halt, I don't know.

B.81:  See, uh, still some migrant labor is legal, you know.

A.82:  In California I know it is.

B.83:  It is in Texas, too.

A.84:  Is it too, in Texas, also?

B.85:  Yes.

A.86:  I, I didn't know.

B.87:  Yeah, during cotton harvest and whenever the, the uh, tomatoes and all 
are,

A.88:  But see they'll come in and do work that other people won't do.  Now I
don't know about this day and time when there's so many people out of work.  I
know if I was out of work, I'd do anything to make money --

B.89:  Well,

A.90:  -- you know, [laughter] because it's pretty scary when you own a home and,
you know [noise] {cracking}.

B.91:  Well, the truth of the matter is, I don't know what your home payments are,
but you couldn't make a living on what they earn.

A.92:  You could?

B.93:  You could not.

A.94:  You could not.

B.95:  Have you seen how those poor people live?

A.96:  Huh-uh.

B.97:  Migrant labor camps.  Oh, my God, they live in cardboard boxes.

A.98:  Oh, it's horrible, isn't it.

B.99:  And these fine Americans take care of them [throat_clearing].

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  And I,

A.102:  See, and they put their children to work and everything, don't they?

B.103:  Yes.  And I don't hold it against the people.

A.104:  No.

B.105:  They're hard workers trying to make it.

A.106:  And no one, and see, Americans wouldn't do it, wouldn't, they wouldn't live
like that.

B.107:  No.

A.108:  They wouldn't do it.

B.109:  No, they'll, they'll ask for a handout first.

A.110:  You couldn't get the street people, I was just going to say, you couldn't
get these homeless people probably to do that.  I see them on corners with
signs saying, I'll work for a meal, but I'll bet you if you stopped and you
offered them a meal if they'd come and do your yard, they'd get out of it some
way.  They just really w-, 

B.111:  No, no, what they're doing is they're asking for handouts.

A.112:  That's right, that's right.

B.113:  Because if you took them into your home to, to work in your yard or
whatever, they'd know where your house is and how to break in then.

A.114:  I know it.

B.115:  Or, now that's not true of all of them.  There are,

A.116:  But how do you know, [laughter] ((the good from the bad)).

B.117:  I don't, I don't know, but I'm sure that times being as hard as they are,
and times are hard, not everyone's that way.  You know, good people are being
put out of jobs now.

A.118:  Oh, yes, how well I know.  I was laid off last year,

B.119:  From T I?

A.120:  but I was, I was lucky because I was one of the first groups to go,
((well)), in,

B.121:  Oh, so you don't,

@@A.122:  in division one and,

B.123:  Oh, and you got transferred to a different,

A.124:  I got, uh, went right to, you know, they have the job centers for us and
everything --

B.125:  Right.

A.126:  -- and I just, oh, boy, I worked hard through, I went through the J O B's
and found this and was versatile enough, had a little bit of office
experience, and they hired me.  And I was just real thankful, and now there's
nothing.  For all the people who are getting laid off now there's just
nothing.

B.127:  Yeah, I've, I've, I've noticed.

A.128:  You know, I know Colorado Springs has been hit, also.

B.129:  Uh, rumors still persist.  I try not to believe them and listen to them,
but they still persist that the plant will close.

A.130:  I don't know, I haven't heard any-, I don't hear much about Colorado
Springs.  It's kind of like they're kind of trying to be invisible, [laughter]
forget about us, forget about us [laughter].

B.131:  Yeah, so you're in division what now?

A.132:  I'm in, in, I'm in payroll,

B.133:  Corporate,

A.134:  division nine.

B.135:  Corporate?

A.136:  Yeah, corporate payroll.

B.137:  Okay.

A.138:  So,

B.139:  Yeah, that, that must feel somewhat safer.

A.140:  It didn't, for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and, uh,

B.141:  Bumping and,

A.142:  I still hold a red badge, and it's still, uh, I'm still under five years,
so if they had a layoff in division nine,
