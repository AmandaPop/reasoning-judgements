REMARKS:        The women's voices were very similar, making it difficult at
times to know who was speaking.  They also talked on top of each other a lot.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, I'm real happy with the car I have [laughter].

B.2:  Oh really.  What kind of car do you have?

A.3:  I have a Hyundai.

B.4:  Oh uh-huh.

A.5:  And I bought it in, uh, eighty, no no no, eighty-eight, or eighty-seven,
eighty-eight, it's an eighty-eight.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And, uh, I'm, I've taken real good care of it, and I'm real happy with it,
but if my financial situation was different there's probably other cars I
would like to have [laughter].

B.8:  Oh really.  Yeah, me too, many, many cars I'd like to have, too.  I bought
a car around the same time, in eighty-eight and it was a, um, a Toyota
Corolla.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, um, I like it pretty well except it's not real comfortable, it doesn't
give a comfortable ride, you know.  It's a cheaper car and it gives a cheaper
ride, and it's not the luxury car.  So if I bought one I'd probably want
something like a new Maxima.

A.11:  Oh, that, is that a Nissan.  

B.12:  Yes.

A.13:  I have a friend that has one that's just gorgeous.

B.14:  Really?

A.15:  Yeah, and then, oh, they do ride nice, too.

B.16:  [Laughter] Rides,

A.17:  In fact,

B.18:  and you don't hear wind noise and all that.

A.19:  yeah, when I, I was sitting here waiting for her to find somebody, I was
trying to think, what kind would I, and Nissan Maxima came into my mind.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  She has a real pretty one.  It's kind of a, oh, it's not white, and it's
not beige, it's kind of a cream color,

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  Oh God it's pretty.

B.24:  Really [laughter].

A.25:  It's got a sun roof in it. Yeah it's a nice car, but boy, she must have
paid a fortune for it.

B.26:  Yeah, well.  I'm almost convinced that you pay for what you get, because my
car in eighty eight was like ten thousand five hundred dollars, and it was
okay when I bought it, you know, it was great, running around town.  It's a
great little run around ca-, town car because I get good gas mileage.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  But when you're out on the road on a trip, like my parents live, like five
hundred miles away --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- you are exhausted,

A.31:  Oh really?

B.32:  by the time you get there.  Yeah, because it's just, the seats aren't
real soft and comfortable and there's only so many positions you can get in,
and your body gets tired.  Plus you hear the road noise a lot.  So,

A.33:  I probably do, too.  I like the way my car rides --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- though.  Uh, course I have a sun roof and I open it up,

B.36:  Oh.

A.37:  so I hear, I hear the wind [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah, yeah.

A.39:  And, but it's comfortable to drive.  I, I really don't have much problem
with that.  I think it's comfortable.  I'm really sold on (( )) you know.  I,
I don't remember what I paid.  [breathing] Pretty close to ten thousand.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  I think with everything all together it came to eleven, with tax and
everything --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- you know, but I'm, I'm real pleased with it.

B.44:  It, did you buy it here in Dallas?

A.45:  Yeah, I bought it at Eagle.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  Well,

A.47:  And I get great service there.

B.48:  Oh, really.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Well, that means a lot.

A.51:  See, I used to work at Lemmon Avenue, so I, that's right across the street
from it.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  So I just walked across the street and bought a car [laughter] --

B.54:  [Laughter]  Yeah, got to see them all the time.

A.55:  -- [Laughter] Yeah, you know, it was really convenient when I was there,
because I'd just pull it in during the day, and I worked second shift at that
time, and I'd just leave my car, you know --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and let them work on it.  I'd bring it in and go to work and then pick
it up, I'd go out on break at five thirty and pick up my car.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  It was real convenient.  Now it's not so convenient.

B.60:  Yeah.  Well, um, like how many, have you had any major repairs or anything
you've had to do to it?

A.61:  No, not a thing.

B.62:  Because, you know, my car's about same age as yours and --

A.63:  It's been,

B.64:  -- I've been lucky.  I haven't had any major anything happen.

A.65:  Me neither.  And I've, I've been really careful to take it when it needs
service.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  I do what the book says, and I take it in.  I took, you know, for the
valves, for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand, and I
change the oil every two to three thousand miles, and I take real, because I
figured it was going to have to last me a while, you know.

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  So I decided, no matter what, if I had to let a bill go,

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  I would take care of my car,

B.72:  Yeah, because,

A.73:  you know, no matter what.

B.74:  you have to get back and forth.

A.75:  Yeah, and I get good gas mileage, and it's just been a great car.  It's,
I'm real pleased with it.  I have no, no qualms about, and I wouldn't mind
buying another one --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- if I had to, you know.

B.78:  Yeah.  Well, that sounds good, because, you know, Hyundai is a fairly new
car --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- compared to, you know, Ford and everybody.  So I, I didn't know anyone
that had one.  That's good to hear.

A.81:  There's a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them.  [laughter] I
think a lot of people walked across the street [laughter].

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  But, uh, uh, there's a couple people that have gone a hundred thousand
miles on theirs, and it's still in good shape.  So,

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  And yet I know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves, and
that's about six, seven hundred dollars, but --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- they didn't take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to.

B.88:  Oh.  Uh-huh.

A.89:  And, you know, and I do that.  I think if you take good care of your car,
you know, I've got thirty, a little over thirty-two thousand miles on mine.
How much, how many miles do you have on yours?

B.90:  That's about what I have.  Thirty-two or thirty-four, I can't remember.  I
just turned over one, one or the other.

A.91:  Do you have the oil changed a lot and everything?

B.92:  Yeah.  Luckily my husband is real good at that, and he knows how, and he
changes it regularly and gives it tune ups, you know, replaces the spark plugs
and, uh,

A.93:  See, I don't have a husband, so I have to have it done, you know.

B.94:  I know.

A.95:  When I did have a husband, he didn't like to do stuff like that, but I
didn't have this car.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  But, uh,

B.98:  I bet the sun roof is great.

A.99:  I love it, I love it.

B.100:  That is something I would really want if, you know, if I bought a new car I
would want a sun roof.

A.101:  Yeah, you know, I gave up the automatic transmission.  When I test drove
the car, I didn't like the automatic transmission because it didn't have any
get up and go.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  And I, I like to shift.  So I got a five speed.  And the automatic
transmission was three hundred dollars and so was the sun roof.

B.104:  Oh, I see.

A.105:  So that was kind of a trade [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  Well, I'll take the standard shift, but I want the sun roof.

B.108:  Well, that's good.

A.109:  So, oh and I love that sun roof.  I use it all the time.

B.110:  Oh yeah.

A.111:  I really do.

B.112:  I think I would too, because, you know, even, I have to drive Seventy-Five
every day.

A.113:  Boo.

B.114:  [Laughter] I do, I drive Seventy-Five every day, so I would, I would still,
you know, (( )).

A.115:  Where do you live?

B.116:  In Plano.

A.117:  Okay, so you come down Seventy-Five. 

B.118:  Right, I come down Seventy-Five, and then I have to come up in five o'clock
traffic, you know.

A.119:  Ooh.  Which, where do you work, which part?

B.120:  The Dallas site, expressway, there at Seventy-Five and Six Thirty-Five.

A.121:  So you're in the, which building?

B.122:  Uh, S C.

A.123:  Oh, you're in the S C building?

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  I'm over in payroll, so we're, we're in Park Central.

B.126:  Yeah.  So you're in Dallas.

A.127:  Yeah, Park Central Five, just across, I come to the S C dock every
afternoon deliver checks and (( )) route on the trucks.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  And I'm just across the road.  But I live in Oak Cliff, so I drive the Toll
Road every day.

B.130:  Oh, yeah, that'd be the only way.

A.131:  And it's great, you know, there's never very much, well there's traffic,
but it's never stop and go unless there's a wreck --

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  -- you know.  I would never drive Central Expressway.  

B.134:  About how many miles is that?

A.135:  I go twenty miles one way.

B.136:  Twenty miles one way.

A.137:  Yeah.

B.138:  Yeah.  See I have about twenty-five round trip is what it is, about
twenty-five miles a day.

A.139:  That's not too bad.

B.140:  Yeah, I still want that sun roof, though.

A.141:  [Laughter].

B.142:  [Laughter] That'd be good.

A.143:  Yeah, I'd like, I wouldn't mind having a convertible.

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  Well, I saw a pretty little convertible the other day on the Toll Road, a
red one.  Oh gosh, it was so cute.

B.146:  Hyundai.

A.147:  No, it was, I don't, oh what was it?  I think it was a Mustang.

B.148:  Um.

A.149:  If I'm not mistaken, I think I noticed it was a Mustang.  And it was new,
and it was pretty.

B.150:  Oh, yeah.

A.151:  I also like the Rabbit --

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  -- uh, convertibles, I think they're kind of cute.

B.154:  Oh, I just had a friend buy one, and he loves it.

A.155:  I bet he does.

B.156:  He does.  It's convertible.  He puts that top down and it's just a fun car.

A.157:  They're expensive.

B.158:  Oh yeah, they are.  I couldn't believe what he paid for it.  It was like
sixteen thousand dollars --

A.159:  Uh {drawn out sound}.  Oh my go-.

B.160:  -- you know, and hear I am thinking, this car is smaller than my car?
[laughter].

A.161:  And I bet it's not comfortable.  Is it comfortable?

B.162:  No, not really.  I mean, it's, you know, the seats are typical Volkswagen
seats,

A.163:  That's right.

B.164:  the vinyl, you know.

A.165:  that's all that is [laughter].

B.166:  I know, but that car is so expensive, but, you know, talking to my husband,
and, he was real impressed with the car, the motor and everything in it is
just fabulous.  Supposedly it's one of the best built cars.

A.167:  Yeah, I, I hear the Volkswagen engine, you know, is really good.

B.168:  Uh-huh.

A.169:  Well isn't it made by, uh, oh, Mercedes?

B.170:  Yes.  And Kharman Ghia, it was the little sports car.

A.171:  I used to have a Kharman Ghia, a red one.

B.172:  On really.

A.173:  One time, and I loved that car. I, I wish now I hadn't sold it.

B.174:  Those are the best, supposedly the best built cars.  So,

A.175:  I'd like to have a Mercedes.

B.176:  The little Volkswagen he has, he's loving it.  Well,

A.177:  I can't see paying as much for a car as you could buy a house for.

B.178:  [Laughter].

A.179:  [Laughter].

B.180:  I know, I know.

A.181:  Sixty, seventy thousand dollars for a car, just a little bit out of my
league.

B.182:  Yeah, I, I can just see parking it at T I, you know, and then somebody,

A.183:  Smashing it, smashing it with their door.

B.184:  Right.

A.185:  Makes me so angry.  Or breaking into it.  We have such a rash of break-ins.

B.186:  Right [laughter].

A.187:  [Laughter].

B.188:  It'd be gone in a week.

A.189:  Yeah.  They've had to put security really heavy in our parking lot, and
people sitting up in the windows watching security --

B.190:  Um.

A.191:  -- because they were coming around smashing the windows and stealing stuff,
just in our parking lot, you know, and our parking lot's not so huge like what
you all have over there, you know.  And, they, we look right out.  My office
looks right out onto the parking lot, and I didn't see anything going on, and
I'm always looking out the window.  And there, in broad daylight.  Oh, I tell
you what, people just really have a lot of nerve, you know.

B.192:  Oh.

A.193:  Break into cars, just broad daylight.

B.194:  And it just ruins you, too.  You, just makes you sick, and then you have
insurance, you know, goes up, and, {takes deep breath} it's terrible.

A.195:  I know it.  And you all had a lot of problems over there, too, didn't you,
for a while ...
