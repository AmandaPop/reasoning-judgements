============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  My views, it asked for my views,

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  so my views on that are, yes, I do still consider them a threat.

B.4:  Really?  [breathing].

A.5:  And, yes, I do.  And the reason I do is because, um, I've, with, uh,
Gorbachev was raised and his mentor was, I be-, it was Nikita Khrushchev, I
believe.  I know it was one of the old, old school Russian --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and, uh, he, he is a definite, he is a Marxist, Leninist communist --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- through and through, and Marxist, Leninist communism is a threat to the
United States because, um, the whole nature of it is to control the world.
The, the, whole goal of the Marxist, Leninist theology is world domination.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And I do not believe that, it has not, they've never stated that their goal
is not to, you know, take over the world and they've never repented of all the
massacres, all the, just the, you know, the hundreds of thousands of, uh,
massacres.  They've killed more Jews --

B.12:  Oh, yeah.

A.13:  -- and all this, and so no, I don't trust them a bit.  I think it's a big
scam.

B.14:  Think so?

A.15:  Yes, I do.  I, yes, I would all but say I know it's a scam.  You can't
trust him.  He was the head of the K G B for years.

B.16:  Was he?

A.17:  Yes, he was, for many, many years.  He was trained in the old school of
Lenin theology and he, he's never changed any of his, any of the, he, he deals
in that kind of theology.  He's, you know, he might say one thing, but what he
does is Marxist and Leninist in nature.

B.18:  Uh-huh {Background noise of kids or cats}.

A.19:  And so that's why the Russians are so angry with him right now,

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  is because they've, they know it's a scam and,

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  so, you know, I, that's what I feel.  I don't know, what do you feel?  Do
you agree with me or disagree?

B.24:  Um, you know, it's, it's hard to say.  Uh, if, if things change,

A.25:  [Cough].

B.26:  uh, change there so rapidly, but, uh, G-, Gor-, Gorbachev is, I don't
know.  I think, I think you, you're right, he's a chameleon.  He's just a,
he's, he, he's just, he seems to have flip-flopped on, you know, uh, uh, you
know, when they first came into power.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  When, uh, President Reagan was in, he was this real nice guy and he was
trying to, uh, win everybody in the West over about what, oh, what a great
reformer he was and all this other stuff, but then, you know, now he's, uh,
you know, crushing the re-, uh, demonstrations,

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  and, and, and trying to clo-, close it off again.  So I, I, I can't
figure, I can't figure him out.  I don't know if he's being pressured from,
uh, above or arou-, or, uh, from other places in, in,

A.31:  Well, if he got out of line too much from the old school, they'd just knock
him off.

B.32:  Yeah ((that)),

A.33:  I mean, they're not go-, they're not going to permit anyone in that Russian
Parliament to get in power that's going to change anything too much.  So,

B.34:  Their people are starving.

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  I mean, they cannot, something, they've got to know that something's got to
give because they're, in, their society, you're not at, you know, it's
supposed to be all for one and one for all, but that ain't how it works, baby.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  I mean, that's, you know, they're not going to do something unless
they've got incentives and they don't have any incentives to work.

A.39:  No, because they've taken them from the people because the Marxist,
Leninist theology is to, I mean it really is its own religion.  It, it could
be classified in theological terms as a religion,

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  because it is, but they deny God.  Self is everything.  Self, you know,
everything is, um, for me, for me, for me, and therefore,

B.42:  Or for the, for the people, for the people, which means everybody else
except you.

A.43:  Right, but that's not what they really do.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  They say that but that's not the reality of it.  Even the Bolshevik
revolution, the whole thing was, uh, an attempt to, uh, gain authority
without, you know, having to be risen up in authority.  The best way to get
godly authority is to, you know, work and, and work your way to the, you know,
work your way up.

B.46:  ((Uh-huh)).

A.47:  Not, not being promoted by man because promotion comes from God.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  But when you, anytime you see a (( )) go in and just overtake it, and it's
take it, take authority, take control --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- it's a, I believe it's a spiritual thing that happens and it's like a
spirit of witchcraft.  It's like a, a bad spirit goes over that nation because
you have these people that want, they're power hungry.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And they want all this power and they want to control all these people, and
it's not for the people, it's for themselves.  And the way you know that is
because they didn't work their way up from the bottom up.  They went in and
they took power and they,

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  took authority and they cut and they stab.  And, and our nation does that
a lot, too, I know.  It's not necessarily, I don't think this is the greatest
system either, but I just feel like there's just a lot of oppression over the
Soviet Union because of that.  The authority is there to exalt self.  That's
the whole Leninist,

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  theology.  They deny God, they deny any creator.  They've forbade
religion for years and years, and God's the one that opened the doors for
their reli-, for, for Christianity to go in Russia.  It's not,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  it's not Gorbachev.  He will not receive the credit for that because one
man saying that could not have done anything.  God had to open those doors.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  And I believe that the, the pressure just got so great from the people,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  because, that they, you know, they, God just honored their prayers and
did a miracle because, I don't know.  We, our pastor went to Russia and we
work with a lot of churches in Minsk and in ((Belev)) Russia and some other
places, and (( )) for Russia.  That's why I think it's funny we got this call
because I have a good friend, my, one of my best friends is going into, into
the underground church,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  because it, basically it's still underground.  It,

B.66:  Oh, yeah.

A.67:  and so they're going in a mission trip into Latvia in about six months
and so they're preparing for the trip, you know, and, and it was, I sat behind
her Sunday and they had their Russia ((team folder)) [laughter] so I thought,
oh, that's cool.

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  So anyway, so this is kind of one of my little pet babies, but [laughter]
anyway.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  I don't know.  I just, I think they want a one world order, that's what I
think.  I think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order, a one world
economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  And Bush is going around talking about it, too.  And it's like all these
pawns on this chess b-, all these players on this big chess game, you know,
and it's a world championship and who is ultimately going to get the power?

B.74:  ((Yeah)).

A.75:  Who's going to get put in checkmate and who's going to be ruled out of the
game,

B.76:  [Talking].

A.77:  and who's going to have the power over what they want to establish in
this one world, you know, communi-, they're always talking about it all the
time.

B.78:  Oh, yeah, you hear a lot about it.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  But it, it's all that, it's, it's all that, uh, the new age philosophy.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  And, uh,

A.83:  Are you a Christian?

B.84:  Yes.

A.85:  You must be to know new age [laughter].

B.86:  Oh, yes, oh, yes,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  I know all about the new age philosophy.

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  Yeah, and, uh, it's, but they are in such disarray over there.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  They're not in any position to exalt, exert themselves over anybody right
now like they were.  I mean with Eastern Europe falling apart and their whole
economic system falling apart, they,

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  ca-, that, that, we need to take real advantage,

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  of that --

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  -- to, to pull their satellites away from them.

A.99:  But, yeah, I think that they still are a threat, but yet maybe a different
kind of a threat --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- than a military threat, but I do believe that they're a military threat.
I think, I mean just look what we did to Iraq, I mean,

B.102:  Well, it was with Russian we-, they fought us with Russian weapons.

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  And they've, they found out the hard way how bad, badly put together the
Russian weapons are.

A.105:  Uh-huh, that's true, yeah.  That's true, they did, didn't they?  I know,
it's, it's interesting.  I still wouldn't want to take them on, though, you
know?  I still wouldn't want to take them.  I still think we need to be very
careful, but I believe that their economic and, or, an economic threat more
than anything at this point in, because they, because they want control over
the, I know they want control over the European economic community.

B.106:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

A.107:  And that, you know, that's why I see them diversifying their, their power
and their control that they have.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  And like for, you know, instead of just being, oh, big tough Russia,

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  but I still believe they've, uh, they've probably got weapons we ca-, I
mean, they, they never would sell to anybody else.

B.112:  Oh, of course.

A.113:  You know?  So I guess I feel like, yeah, they probably, I wouldn't want to
mess with them, but I don't trust them.  I'm not all like, oh, yeah, they're
just like us.

B.114:  (( )).

A.115:  I, I have a heart for the people of Russia.

B.116:  Not, not, not for the leaders,

A.117:  No.

B.118:  definitely not for the leaders.

A.119:  I wouldn't be surprised if Gorbachev wasn't a s-, wasn't a satanist.  I'm
not kidding [laughter].

B.120:  Well, they're, they're, they're a secret, they're a secret socie-,

A.121:  ((You're right)).

B.122:  they're a secretive society.

A.123:  Even, yeah.

B.124:  You know, and they're not going to let you see what they don't want you to
see.

A.125:  Exactly.  Even, you know, in our own country, I mean, Bush was in the scull
and bones, the Trilateral Commission and all these groups with ulterior
motives, and so it's like, what on earth is, you know, are these people ever
here and involved in, in the higher, high ranking things.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  I mean, when you look at their history and what they've done to their own
people,

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  what they've done, it's like, man, can we trust them?  Have they repented
for what they did?

B.130:  No, they haven't.

A.131:  Have they made a world apology?  We, we repented for (( )).  We're going
to start seeking God and we're going to start seeing God to do for our nation
what needs to be done.  And even Bush will call a national day of prayer.  Is
Bush saved?

B.132:  ((Yeah)).

A.133:  I don't know.  God knows.  He says he is.  And I'm going to trust that with
him,

B.134:  {Background music}.

A.135:  but, I mean, it's just, no, I don't trust them [laughter].

B.136:  No.

A.137:  You'd be crazy if you trust them, but anyway, call it, what is it,
McCarthyism?  No, [laughter] I'm not like that.  I just got enough common
sense that, nope, you know, I'll, till you come repent, make a world apology,

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  for all the wrongs that you've done.  And yeah, we've done wrongs but
we've not done near the atrocities they've done.  And we need to maybe do that
also, you know?  You know I'm saying, I'm not saying like, oh, America, we're
so, we're perfect over here,

B.140:  ((Uh-huh)).

A.141:  I'm not saying that either, but that's not what the question asked so
[laughter],

B.142:  [Laughter].

A.143:  Boy, I could pr-,
