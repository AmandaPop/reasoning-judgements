A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay, that made a nice ugly sound.  So,

A.3:  Your name is Lynn?

B.4:  Linda.

@A.5:  Linda.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  So, sounds like you like to read.

A.7:  Yeah, I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.

B.8:  I don't read as much as I would like to either.  I'm, I'm a single mom, but
I have always loved reading.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  What do you like to read?

A.11:  Um, well [static] um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade, so most
of my books are, um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.

B.12:  That what I've been reading lately a lot of.  Um, my interests switch
around dramatically.  I used to read just, mainly fic-, fiction, and now I,
lik-, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  What kind of things have you read?

B.14:  Oh, I read all kinds of things for, um, helping people survive a divorce.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.  Have you
read that?

A.17:  Uh, I haven't gotten through [laughter] it yet.

B.18:  You haven't?

A.19:  No.

B.20:  Okay, what would you recommend?

A.21:  Um, as far as dealing with divorce?

B.22:  Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.

A.23:  Good self help.  

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Well, um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the
time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE --

B.26:  Um, that sounds good.

A.27:  -- by Robert McGee --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and it's one that we use in our work.  It's probably one you'd find in
like a Christian book store.  I don't know what the chains are down there.
Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  I'm writing it down.  That does soun-, that's sound really good.
Um, what kind of counseling do you do, or should we stay on the topic of
books?

A.31:  Um, probably should stay on the topic, but that has a little bit to do with
some of the things that I read  [throat_clearing].

B.32:  (( )).

A.33:  I'm a therapist for Rossa.  It's a Christian treatment organization --

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  -- and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically, so I
see a lot of kids with, with various problems.  Right now some of the things
I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse, so a lot of the
books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.

B.36:  Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a
bad stage anyway, and then to have to deal with sexual abuse --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- would be terrible, as a teen.  That's, uh, (( )) that must be a
wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution
like that.

A.39:  Well, sometimes it's rewarding, and, and sometimes it's a struggle.

B.40:  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.  Uh, what oth-, is, is that just the only type of
reading you've been doing, or do you, have you read any good novels lately?

A.41:  Um, [laughter] I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read
it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, uh,

B.42:  just joy reading.  Yeah.

A.43:  reading, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.

B.44:  I hear you there, that's for sure.  Um,

A.45:  In fact,

B.46:  I guess, the last book I've read, my oldest daughter had to read LOST
HORIZONS for her English class,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And I just realized I had never read it growing up.  So, I just finished
reading that [laughter] for enjoyment.

A.49:  Um, that's neat.

B.50:  And it wa-, it was good.  Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much, so I
didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her.  But I thought it
was real interesting.

A.51:  Yeah, I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts
from college --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much, but I never seem to
have the time to do --

B.54:  I know.

A.55:  -- that kind of reading.  

B.56:  Yeah.  Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books, but, I, I
keep lists, I must have a list of, oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I
want to read.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  Just like, (( )) I want to read that and I write it down.

A.59:  Yeah, I've got a stack next to my bed [laughter].

B.60:  So do I.

A.61:  I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book and then I, I get distracted,
and, or have to start on another one, [throat_clearing] it's pretty tough to
keep up with.  I was trying to think of, I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS
TRAVELLED but I was trying to think, there's another Scott (( )) book that
I've got that I had read.

B.62:  Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.

A.63:  Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of.

B.64:  Yeah.  I, I bought that one, and I didn't get into, involved in that one as
well.  There's another one he wrote that even sounds better, and it's kind of
the whole concept of global peace, you know, like, and communities --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- building communities.  Someone just recently said something really neat
about that.  Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends, and,
uh, it was of the people from there that said that.  His latest book, and I
can't recall the name of it, is just excellent, and his whole idea is, we can
build a better world if people get involved in good community building
projects.  And he did, uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of
the, you know, one of the places.

A.67:  Uh.

B.68:  So, I've ha-, um,

A.69:  That's interesting.

B.70:  Yeah, it, it really was.  A real fun boo-, bunch of books that I read, uh,
the beginning of last year were, um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN
LIVINGSTON SEA-, SEAGULL --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- I can't think of his name.

A.73:  Is it (( ))?

B.74:  Pardon me --

A.75:  (( ))?

B.76:  -- uh, no, uh, {pause} oh, it'll, it'll come to me, but he wrote, he wrote
the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER TI-, A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.  Those are (( ))
mind expanding books [laughter].

A.77:  Um.

B.78:  His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of.
{pause} I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though.
But, uh, they, they were fun.  They were real just books for fun.

A.79:  Uh-huh {pause}.

B.80:  Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?

A.81:  Um, not very long.  I really just started.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  How did you get involved?

A.83:  My wife has been working for T I.

B.84:  Oh, I see.  I'm a former T I-er.  I just recently quit.  And so, uh, I got
myself involved in a sales job, and right now, my list of books to be read
have to do with, uh, the art of selling.

A.85:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.86:  So.

A.87:  It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa they tend to come out with a
new book every couple of weeks --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.
[laughter] So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read, and,

B.90:  Never, never --

A.91:  I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.

B.92:  -- there's never going to be enough hours in the day.

A.93:  I don't think so.

B.94:  Even if you took speed reading.  Huh.

A.95:  Yeah, I don't think so.

B.96:  So, {pause} well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.  Do you like to
read mysteries.

A.97:  Yeah, a little bit.  

B.98:  Do you like Ken (( ))?

A.99:  Um.  Trying to think.  

B.100:  He writes, uh, spy novels, {pause}  THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- and, uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable
{pause}.

A.103:  I like that kind of stuff.  I think the last novel I read I read, I guess,
in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.  It was a, um, last
name's (( )), it's called PIERCING, no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS.

B.104:  Um.

A.105:  It's, uh, kind of unusual book.  It's a lot about spiritual warfare and
some things like that.

B.106:  Oh that sounds interesting. [Noise] {sounds like phone knocking against
something} It sounds really good.  Hey, you should make yourself a promise
that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your
work, or, you know, self improvement, and you kind of forget the fun of
reading {pause}.

A.109:  Yeah, that's true.

B.110:  Yeah, very easily.  So {pause},

A.111:  Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.

B.112:  I think so, too.  And I thank you for calling.

A.113:  Yeah, nice talking to you, Linda.

B.114:  And, uh, I'll have to check out that book you,

A.115:  Okay, great.

B.116:  told me about.  Okay,

A.117:  Hope you like you it.

B.118:  Thank you.

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  You take care.

A.121:  You, too.

B.122:  Bye-bye.

A.123:  Bye-bye.
