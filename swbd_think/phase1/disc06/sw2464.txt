REMARKS:        Both speakers made it hard to transcribe because they would
both constantly overlap each other, and their laughter made it hard to 
understand the words that were spoken.

===========================================================================

B.1:  Hi.

A.2:  I don't know, much about this topic, let me ask you does she spell her name
with two N -s and an E?

B.3:  Uh, no, she doesn't. 

A.4:  Oh, okay, well, then we're all right.  Okay. 

B.5:  Okay. 

A.6:  That ((would have been)) totally weird. 

B.7:  Yeah.  

A.8:  I ((have no idea who)) listens to this. 

B.9:  Oh, yeah that's right, well, we'll find out later [laughter]. 

A.10:  There you go, yeah. 

B.11:  They've got this all reported, I guess.

A.12:  Oh, right.  I didn't know there was a proposal ((to serve)) young people to
have a year of public service.

B.13:  Actually I didn't either, um, uh, I really wasn't familiar with that and,
um, I didn't even realize I had put that as, you know, this must be something
fairly new because I don't remember this as even being one of the topics,

A.14:  Yeah, #I didn't,# 

B.15:  #you know,# (( )) had to put, have, be discussed.

A.16:  I didn't either, are you from Pennsylvania? 

B.17:  Yes. 

A.18:  Are you from Pittsburgh? 

B.19:  Oh, God, close, Johnstown. 

A.20:  Ha, we're not suppose to do this [laughter].  I, I can, I'm from,
originally from Beaver County, #oh, my God.#

B.21:  #Oh, your kidding.# 

A.22:  No, I could smell an accent a #mile away.#

B.23:  #Oh, isn't that fu-,# only people from there can tell.  Everyone else is,
where did you get that weird accent?

A.24:  Are you in Pennsylvania or Dallas right now?

B.25:  Uh, no, right now I'm in, uh, Washington, D C area. 

A.26:  Oh, okay. 

B.27:  And you're in Dallas? 

A.28:  Yes, I'm in Dallas.

B.29:  Okay. 

A.30:  My husband's a T I -er. 

B.31:  Oh, okay.  

A.32:  #Are you ma-,#

B.33:  #Well, my, yeah,# actually my husband he's with the, uh, he's with the
federal government and, uh, I'm a civil engineer but I'm taking a year off.

A.34:  Oh, how nice. 

B.35:  Um, what, uh, how do you feel about, uh, 

A.36:  [Breathing]. 

B.37:  the, the young people, are they, are, are they talking, uh, do you think
eighteen years of age like ri-, or during high school?

A.38:  I don't know, I'd, first of all, is there a proposal in the (( )), I mean,
is there a legitimate proposal?  I didn't see that on the list.

B.39:  I've never heard of such of thing,

A.40:  #But I guess,# 

B.41:  #this is,# #this is really,#

A.42:  #it's, unless# it's,

B.43:  a surprise to me,

A.44:  Yeah. 

B.45:  I wasn't ((total)), I'm glad it was you because I was afraid I'd get some
guy on here that knows all ((about this)) [laughter].

A.46:  Yeah, really.  I guess, I would say that if there is one, I would think
that they are talking eighteen years or twenty-one years of age,

B.47:  Uh-huh. 

A.48:  But I personally don't think it's a good idea for a year.  I would look
at it more as a, uh, internship kind of thing, maybe three months.

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  Throu-, you know, ninety days to six months or something. 

B.51:  Yes. 

A.52:  Um, but more than that, I would have a problem with it. 

B.53:  And, and, how do, how do you think that they would propose to do it as far
as if, uh,

A.54:  #((Enforcement)).#

B.55:  #a person is# coming out of high school and going to college, how could,
you know, I wonder how they could possibly, uh, if this would be a voluntary
thing or a mandatory.

A.56:  Yeah the way the, the way the voice ((might have)) worded it, it sounded
almost mandatory as opposed to elected.

B.57:  Yes, it did.  Yeah. 

A.58:  And I would obviously, I mean not obviously, but I would be against
anything like that being mandatory.

B.59:  Well, I think I would also, and I think it, it really, uh, would be very
difficult in terms of, uh, you know, people, I'm thinking mainly people going
to college I don't see how,

A.60:  Right.

B.61:  how with, uh, the work load kids have nowadays and what often most
college students, I'm like, maybe when we went to school, I don't know how
long ago you went but,

A.62:  Thirty something [laughter].

B.63:  yeah [laughter] me too,

A.64:  There you go, yeah.

B.65:  and, uh, you know, I think it, it's, it's most of them now carry
part-time jobs, on top of having fifteen or sixteen credits.

A.66:  That and ((thus)) think, I mean, I don't know, I went to, uh, even though
I'm from that part of the country, I did go to high school in, uh, the Midwest
and Chicago, and I, we had, it was mandatory that we took civics every year.

B.67:  Oh, really?  

A.68:  Yeah, it was a mandatory and then you had to take a test that showed you
had a certain knowledge of ((state)) government and state service.

B.69:  Yeah. 

A.70:  And they did offer actually certain types of public service internships,

B.71:  I see.

A.72:  that I think is a very good idea that that's mandatory,

B.73:  Yeah.  

A.74:  but I don't know how any, I mean, the whole thing sounds a little bit
ludicrous but that's my word.

B.75:  Yeah, the other thing I think that they could do possibly is with, um, I
don't know, when I went to school we had, um, in our social studies we had it
divided into, for every report card period,

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  like there were five or six, six week sessions,

A.78:  Right.  

B.79:  and we could pick what we wanted to take, you know, whether you wanted to
study American Indians or this or that.  Maybe as one of those six week
sessions instead of having a class, um, or have the class but as part of that
or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis.

A.80:  And when they're younger not when they're getting into undergraduate and
college age,

B.81:  Yeah, yeah, I, 

A.82:  ((situations)).

B.83:  I, uh, I really, I'm bewildered as far as how they could even work
something like this in, if they try to make it mandatory.

A.84:  I don't, yeah, and I, maybe that's not what they meant, maybe that's just
the way both of us took the wording, but I, I think it's a good I get-, idea
to get younger people involved in the government in some way or the public,
you know,

B.85:  Right. 

A.86:  (( )) it's just they, they're not aware of why things cost what they do,
why things operate the way they do, and I just,

B.87:  Right, and in this area there's so much going on volunteer wise like for
home life, uh, I, you know, I know, it's ((for)),

A.88:  You mean, in th-, in the area of geographic region you're in.

B.89:  Yeah, 

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  yeah, there, there are many organizations, uh, feed the hungry, all
these, there's a lot of,

A.92:  ((Grass roots)) (( )).

B.93:  ((drives)) in school for this type of thing already, you know, not nec-,
sometimes, um, they might even have I know, uh, ((which)) a niece and nephew
of mine, they're school was, uh,

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  like, uh, church school and they even had things where,

A.96:  Huh.

B.97:  they would have them go to shelters downtown and help for a day,

A.98:  Oh, my.

B.99:  or, um, what a lot of kids do here is, um, they have things to school
where, they have actual, they have a holiday (( )) night, but every-, your,
uh, your, uh, fee if you want to call it or the way you get admitted to going,

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  to this show,

A.102:  Uh-huh.

B.103:  is to bring a can or two for the hungry.

A.104:  Oh, yeah, they do that, I mean, in, in, in north Texas they do that quite a
bit where, you know, if you want to go to this particular movie or concert,

B.105:  Uh-huh.  

A.106:  or a discounted thing, the big thing down here is rodeos, uh, [laughter]
if you,

B.107:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's quite different from up here, I guess, yes.

A.108:  Yeah, really, (( )), Pennsylvania, [laughter], (( )) listening, you know, I
just talked to my ((brother)), it's like really weird [laughter].

B.109:  Yeah, that is, this, yeah, that is,

A.110:  ((Coincidence)) [laughter]. 

B.111:  pretty wild,

A.112:  Yeah.

B.113:  that is pretty wild, yeah.

A.114:  Um, I really don't think they can do it though, I mean, I, I, you know, I
think that things that your talking about like anything that emphasizes the
social services with the public service,

B.115:  Right, right, or, yeah,

A.116:  I,

B.117:  I think they can integrate maybe a short period of time in with high
school students and get them to be aware that, you know, they're not,

A.118:  Uh-huh.

B.119:  uh, ((especially)) teenagers, they're not the only ones around and what
maybe their, you know, their parents are going through, (( )), I know in an
area like this, it's, uh, fairly affluent and, and kids here are really out of
touch with reality,

A.120:  Are they?

B.121:  I always call it Disneyland here.

A.122:  Ev-, are you, are you in northern Virginia or are you in the District of
Columbia?

B.123:  Uh, we're in, we're in, uh, where they call it now north Potomac. It's,
it's,

A.124:  Yeah.

B.125:  (( )) town but it's close to Potomac.

A.126:  Okay. 

B.127:  And, um, you know, you see sixteen year olds driving around in brand new B
M W -s,

A.128:  Yeah, that's,

B.129:  and it's just unbelievable, you know.

A.130:  We're in a, yeah, that's we're in a, near next to a town called Plano,
Texas and it's very, um, it's like ((Falls Church)) Alex-, I mean,

B.131:  Right.

A.132:  Montgomery County, I'm familiar with where you're at.

B.133:  Yeah.

A.134:  Um, and they really, that's a good way to put it, I know, I went to high
school in the city of Chicago at an inner city school,

B.135:  Uh-huh.  

A.136:  although I lived in a different area near a place called Evanston,
Illinois,

B.137:  Uh-huh.

A.138:  and the reason that I stayed at the school I did was because at Evanston
township which, back then was like one of the three larger schools in the
country,

B.139:  Yes.

A.140:  everybody was already doing the, um, driving the beamers, and, you know,
with nothing to think that, um, they didn't have five hundred dollar
wardrobes, you know, every week,

B.141:  Yeah.

A.142:  that kind of thing.

B.143:  Yeah, yeah.

A.144:  I, I just, I just think, the one thing they do so strongly about is what
your saying that I don't think kids have a sense of civil responsibility.

B.145:  No, they don't. 

A.146:  I think then, that's a step away from even duty, I don't think they even
have a sense of the responsibility.

B.147:  Right, and I think one other area here is that, um, this is typically what
we call in this area, yuppie area and people,

A.148:  [Laughter].

B.149:  aren't, my kids, you know, other than,

A.150:  Uh-huh.

B.151:  you know, occasionally they're not even aware that there are people over
fifty that exist [laughter].

A.152:  This is true. Yeah.

B.153:  And, and I think it might be another good public service might be to have
them help out in geriatric homes or, you know, this type of thing, they are
around.

A.154:  Yeah, I think the one thing the, the, there's a program called, uh, Habitat
For Humanity,

B.155:  Uh-huh.  

A.156:  that Jimmy Carter ((started)), the former president.

B.157:  Uh-huh.  

A.158:  And I think, I think programs like that with what you just talked about
going on in your area, local area at, and something like that would be good,

B.159:  Yeah. 

A.160:  you know, but not that specifically but things along that (( )) of, of
activity.

B.161:  Right, and I, I, in general I feel that, um, I don't know what this still
proposes far as what age or, or how they would do this, but I feel that
reaching the kids when they're younger is better though, I think once they're
out of high school they're so into their own thing that I think it would be
very difficult, maybe by that time they're too, uh, calloused to what is,

A.162:  Formed, yeah.

B.163:  even going on, you know,

A.164:  They're already, yeah.

B.165:  where as younger children, it's the, it's the grade school children,

A.166:  Right.

B.167:  ((when there)) say no to drugs and that type of thing in school,

A.168:  Uh-huh.

B.169:  they're the ones that will come home and tell you, you know, you
shouldn't smoke it's bad for you, shouldn't drink it's bad for you, and I
think it's the younger,

A.170:  Uh-huh.

B.171:  it's the younger, uh, kids that it reaches more, and so if they want to
start this type of thing, it should be integrated maybe from a young age, and,
and,

A.172:  Yeah, I agree with you like prejunior high, and,

B.173:  Yes. 

A.174:  and, um, see (( )) make it, you know, a curriculum oriented type of
proposal as opposed to anything mandated like the old selective service or
anything.

B.175:  Right, right.

A.176:  So, it sounds like we're in agreement with that.

B.177:  Yeah, I think so, uh,

A.178:  Anything, any else we can [laughter]. 

B.179:  I don't know [laughter]. I guess, (( )).

A.180:  We can talk about,

B.181:  (( )) Pittsburgh (( )) [laughter]. 

A.182:  talk about Pittsburgh, yeah, your right, it's like, I mean this is very
str-, because I'm not in that part of the coun-, I don't care if they listen,
I'm not in that part of the country [laughter], I don't want ((to offend
you)).  I, and I'm not in their part of the country, so ((what)) I hear all my
best friends are in western Pennsylvania and it's like, oh,

B.183:  Yeah, yeah, (( )) yeah, I don't know if you miss ((it or not)) but,

A.184:  Yeah, I, I do.  I mean, I, didn't grow up totally there because of a parent
parental divorce in my family but, um, you know, it was always ((shuttle))
back and forth, so, uh,

B.185:  Uh-huh. 

A.186:  it's like two homes, but, yeah, I miss it. 

B.187:  Yeah, well, this is a good area because you're far enough away and yet
you're close, you know, so,

A.188:  Yeah.

B.189:  holidays and things or whatever you wanted to, you can be there but, um,
you know, I enjoy being here, I don't know if I'd ever, you know, I might go
back there eventually one day (( )) uh, right now, you know.

A.190:  Yeah, really is, they've cleaned it up a lot though, I mean,

B.191:  Oh, yeah,  

A.192:  I don't think we'll get in trouble doing that.

B.193:  oh, Pittsburgh, I lived there four years I, I liked, when I was a
teenager ((and)) early twenties, and I liked it there, a lot people didn't but
I really enjoyed it.

A.194:  Yeah, I lived there in my early twenties, too, before I moved here
[laughter].

B.195:  Oh [laughter].  That's the,

A.196:  That's weird, I hope we never me-,
