===========================================================================

A.1:  [TV] Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?

B.2:  Well, I don't know.  I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I
listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh,
things that are happening.  Uh, I'm against it but on the same token,
uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to
do that [laughter].

A.3:  #((Ye-,))#

B.4:  #So# I, I have a rifle in the house.  Uh, the ammunition is probably so old
I'm afraid to use it.  But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and
also because I wanted a weapon.  Uh, how do you feel about it?

A.5:  Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on
handguns.

B.6:  Huh.

A.7:  And, I think they need that.  Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.  It's a
little twenty-two and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  An-, you know, I do like to have my guns.  

B.10:  #[Laughter].#

A.11:  #Uh, I# don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.  And like you, my bullets
to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old [sniffing] [child].
Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  [Swallowing] But, uh, I like to have them where [child_crying] handy.

B.14:  Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit
before you could buy any amu-, am-, ammunition.  And I thought that was really
good.  And I think if they, uh,

A.15:  [Child_talking].

B.16:  takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not
as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.  You have to get a permit from
the police station in your local area to do that.

A.17:  [Child_talking] I've never heard of anything like that.  

B.18:  Yeah.  Uh,

A.19:  [Child_talking] That would be nice.  #But,#

B.20:  #[Snorting].#

A.21:  [Child_crying] a-, you know, the criminals that are going to get their guns
#one# --

B.22:  #I# --

A.23:  -- way or the other.

B.24:  -- I, I agree.  I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs
to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly
and, and, uh,

A.25:  [/Child_crying].

B.26:  maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.  But if someone's
really determined to, to pick up a firearm [inhaling] you can pick it up any
place.

A.27:  #Yeah [child].#

B.28:  #And# you can get them really cheap.

A.29:  I know I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh,
Tennessee.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And, uh, they had a waiting period and, uh, we bought it there.  #And,# 

B.32:  #How# long was the waiting period out there?

A.33:  About nine days.  

B.34:  Huh.  That wasn't too, too bad.

A.35:  No.  No [child_crying].  

B.36:  Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I
think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with
it.  You're not going to react that quickly.  In other words, you know, you
don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.

A.37:  Th-, somebody wants to do that, I, I, at times I think they ought to have a
waiting period on all firearms.

B.38:  Yeah.  I do too.  Uh, because [laughter] it doesn't make any difference,
uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.  They both #do the same
kind of job.#

A.39:  #[Dishes] A shotgun hurts worse# than a pistol does.  

B.40:  Uh, yeah.  I suppose.  I never got shot with either one.  But I don't know,
uh, I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun [laughter].

A.41:  No, a shotgun's got too much of a spread.  #Or at# --

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  -- least ours does.  Uh, it's, you know, you have a little, uh, thing on
the bo-, bottom of th-, on top of the barrel --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- where you, you turn it, you can make it either tight or [laughter] as
loose as loose can get.

B.46:  Oh.

A.47:  And the spread changes.

B.48:  Uh, [throat_clearing] I've got a manual single shot and I guess it doesn't
have any, any automatic features to it.  The further away I get, the, the, uh,
wider the shot gets --

A.49:  [Child_talking] Yeah.

B.50:  -- from the target.  And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets.
It's got a hell of a kick to it.

A.51:  Yeah.  My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time.  And I shot
[child_crying] that thing one time.  Almost knocked me down.

B.52:  #[Laughter].#
 
A.53:  #And it just ((a li-,))# I don-, I forget, I think it was a three
fifty-seven.  I'm not sure.

B.54:  Do you belong to a gun club or you?

A.55:  He belonged to one awhile back.  Uh, since we moved, we've only been here
in Texas for about a year [/dishes] --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot.  #Just for# --

B.58:  #No kidding.#

A.59:  -- target practice.  I'd love to get used to that shotgun.  We traded his
pistol for that shotgun.

B.60:  Huh.  Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of
expensive but, uh, it's well worth it.  You can go down and shoot up against a
sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.  Uh, I've never really
joined a club because I haven't got the time.  Not because I haven't got the
desire.  Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.
Plus there's ini-, an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first
time, uh, uh, member.

A.61:  [Child].

B.62:  So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.
Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would
join in.

A.63:  Yeah.  Well, that's what my husband, when he was in that gun club where he
was doing that [noise] {can't tell if it's a cough or something was hit}.  It,
you know, he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.

B.66:  I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.  In fact, I'd like
to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon
you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know
how to handle that weapon.

A.67:  That's a good, I've never thought of that.

B.68:  #[Laughter].#

A.69:  #That's# a good point.

B.70:  And, you know, it, it, even after you wait your nine days, if you don't
know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that
doesn't know how to drive.  And you give him a license because he waited nine
days.

A.71:  Yeah.  That's, and, {pause} yeah.

B.72:  He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.  He could, he could,
uh, mishandle a weapon.  Leave it at home and let a child get at it.

A.73:  It, well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis and, uh, this
one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.  And he was
twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot.

B.74:  Wow.  He was fortunate.  He could, [laughter] he could of hit something
else #[laughter].#

A.75:  #[Laughter]# Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh,
shooting his foot almost off.  He broke his leg and --

B.76:  Wow.

A.77:  -- collar bone and a couple of other things #I'm sure, being,# 

B.78:  #[Laughter].#

A.79:  Mister Cowboy.  I can't remember what the na-, the term was going around.
It was about four or five years ago.

B.80:  #[Laughter].#

A.81:  #[Laughter] But.#  Now, I guess that would be a good idea [noise] [/child].

B.82:  About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?  Like if you wanted to sell
your pistol to me.  How do you feel about that?  Do you believe there ought to
be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?  And, or do you believe
that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh,

A.83:  [Squeak].

B.84:  because you own it?

A.85:  Uh, that's a hard one because we did that.  But, uh, I think there ought to
be some rule against it.  I'll, uh, you know, the person who sells the gun
ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and
somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.

B.86:  Yeah.  #I-, isn't# --

A.87:  #Uh,# 

B.88:  -- there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun?

A.89:  I have no idea.  #I've only# --

B.90:  #Because I# --

A.91:  -- had one gun and I've kept it, #you# --

B.92:  -- #have,# 

A.93:  -- know, the one gun that was in my name.

B.94:  Yeah.  Is it registered?

A.95:  Yeah.  I-,

B.96:  The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered,

A.97:  [Noise].

B.98:  and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it but the, uh,

A.99:  I don't think you have to register a shotgun [squeak].

B.100:  [Noise] Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary [rustling].  The, uh, the,

A.101:  Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.  If they go to, uh, regulating, uh,
[sniffing] all right, uh, banning guns.  Pri-, pri-, pri-, private cit-,
citizens --

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  -- this, my kid is jumping on me.  I can't hardly talk.

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns.

B.106:  Yeah.  I guess that could happen.  It's just like the, uh, the social
security system [noise].  Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number and now
they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.

A.107:  [Clanging].  

B.108:  #And# --

A.109:  #Yeah.#

B.110:  -- once they have your number, they have your identification.  And if you
try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government,
they know who you are.

A.111:  [Swallowing] Yeah.  And everything about you.

B.112:  ((And)), that's true [laughter] [noise].

A.113:  Uh, I, bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to,
uh, probably your, uh, my kid is banging.  I was seeing what they was banging
on.  Uh, I've lost my train of thought.  I'm sorry [laughter].

B.114:  That's all right.  You, you were talking about, uh, uh, --

A.115:  Oh, the Soc-,

B.116:  -- Fed-, what the Federal government knows about people.

A.117:  Yeah.  They, they probably know everything from, half the time wh-, ho-,
what time you go to the bathroom.

B.118:  [Laughter] #They probably do.#

A.119:  #No, that's# that's a little bit extreme.  But they could know anything and
everything about you.  And, uh, I'd like to have my gun.  If they go to
banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pis-, our, uh,
shotgun.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  But I don't, I don't, uh [ringing],

B.124:  Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not
registered?

A.125:  No.

B.126:  No.  I don't either.  I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.
#Just# --

A.127:  #Yeah.  W-,#

B.128:  -- you know, put up the money.

A.129:  Yeah.  Well, you can look in the, uh, the, we got a thing down here called
A SHOPPER.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  It's a, a ho-, it's a, it's a bargain thing.  Uh, you go and ever-, you
know, always see guns in there.

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  Five to seven guns a day.  It comes out every Tuesday.

B.134:  And there's, there's no waiting period on that.

A.135:  No.  None whatsoever #[laughter].#

B.136:  #[Laughter].#

A.137:  You call, we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve
hours.

B.138:  To sell the refrigerator?

A.139:  Yeah.  

B.140:  Yeah.

A.141:  You know.  And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.

B.142:  Huh.  And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from,
uh, uh, control.  I, I don't believe in, uh, I'm s-, I shouldn't probably say
control.  I mean regulation.  Control is something that I wouldn't want the
Federal government to have.  Uh, but I would like to see them have a
monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons.

@@A.143:  Yeah.  Well, I agree with you there.  They do have too much control over
us already.

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.

B.146:  [Laughter] Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend
the money, so I can't complain too much.

A.147:  [Laughter] Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know.  They're [/TV] [/child]
