REMARKS:        Baby sounds throughout.  There is confusion from the 
paper that comes with the tape as to which is Speaker A and Speaker B.  
I have used that Speaker A, being the first one to speak individually, 
is the male, and begins with the words all right on the individual section.  
These words are not well heard on the conversation between both speakers.

============================================================================

A.1:  All right.

B.2:  Okay, are you on an exercise program now or, 

@A.3:  Yeah, I exercise pretty regularly.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  I lift weights quite a bit.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Um, I run occasionally.  Let's see what else do I do.  Play golf some, and
I work out on a, on a hanging bag.  I'm brown belt in karate, so I --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- keep up with that a little bit.  

B.10:  Oh, yeah.

A.11:  How about you.

B.12:  Um, the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  I've got a nine month old, and I'm four months pregnant with my second, and
so, at the time, walking seems to be the best.  It's something I can do with
her, plus, um, doesn't tax me too physically.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  I have enjoyed aerobics in the past, and I enjoy that because I like the
group association, you know, like exercising with other people.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  And, um, and that's my favorite way to exercise.  

A.19:  Well, that's neat.  Yeah, I do walk some too.  My wife's about five months
along --

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  -- so she's been walking quite a bit, so that is a good exercise for that.

B.22:  Yeah, it's nice to do it together, too, I guess.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  My husband and I use to walk together, but our schedules don't coincide as
well as they used to, and so, we very seldom get together to walk but, when
you, when you work out, do you pretty much do it on your own schedule, or do
you go to groups or,

A.25:  I, I do it on my own schedule.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y, stuff like that, but it was so
difficult to go on a regular basis, to drive the distance you have to go.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  Save the fees, we've, uh, just save the fees and buy some of our own
equipment.  So,

B.30:  And then you can do it whenever you want I guess.

A.31:  Yeah, I've got a weight bench, and we got my wife an exercise bike, and I
use that sometimes too.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  It's a little more convenient, but, you're, I guess you're not as dedicated
if you don't drive [baby_talking] over to do it.

B.34:  I guess it depends on the person, depends on how [laughter] motivated you
are.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  Because my husband used to work out three days a week with, uh, at the
Texas Instruments gym.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And then I would just go on Saturdays.  But, since the first of the year
neither one of us have been going.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  So, I guess, like I say, we've been paying these fees and not going, so
it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it.

A.41:  Yeah, I think you really have to be disciplined. 

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I, uh, I try to work out at least a couple of times a week, and I think you
really have to, at least twice a week, just to maintain the shape that you're
in.

B.44:  Yeah.  With the walking, I think they said you need to walk at least twelve
miles a week for it to be aerobically {pause} beneficial.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And we, I have two friends, that we walk.  They have babies that are about
the same ages as, as mine, and we've been walking every morning at, going when
it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- very easily.  So we, when we go, we have about, do about fifteen miles a
week, but the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been
[laughter] real consistent.  So {pause} it's a little harder when you're
depending on other people to do it with you --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- because you have to meet their schedules as well, but --

A.51:  Sure.

B.52:  -- but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me.  You know,
I usually do it because I want to, because I know it's good for me, not
because, I don't feel obligated to do it.  I enjoy it.  If I feel too
obligated to do it, I start to rebel, and I won't be as consistent with it.

A.53:  Yeah, I understand.  Did you exercise between your first child and your
second?

B.54:  I exercised pretty well up until I found, uh, until I was pregnant, and I
started having pains.  So I've calmed down everything except, I was working
out doing aerobic exercises as well as the, um, walking,

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of {pause} painful.
But the T I rec center has an aerobics program for, for, um, prenatal and
postnatal aerobic type thing.

A.57:  Um.

B.58:  And I was going to wait until, um, about my sixth month and then start
that.  I did that with the second baby, and, um, I went to my exercise class
one day, and then she was delivered the next day.

A.59:  Gosh.

B.60:  So, it would seem to be real beneficial.

A.61:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Maybe it, maybe it speeded up the process and all that.

B.62:  Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier.  And, and is this your first
that you're having?

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Oh, okay, well, then I don't know how much you've been through it, but I
think parts of it made a lot easier.  And, I've talked to a lot of ladies that
exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other, and they said that they
had ex-, that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier.

A.65:  Really.

B.66:  And we've, I had, having both of them natural, the first one was natural
and going natural the second, and, and it's, it's rough but [laughter] it's
not as bad as I thought it would be, and I think the exercise helped.

A.67:  Well, that's good.

B.68:  So, do you work with T I?

A.69:  No, I don't.  My, my wife has been working with them.

B.70:  Oh, okay, well then she could go if she were interested.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  I think, that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings.  So she
could find out if she wanted to go.  [baby_crying] It's kind of fun because
with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first
pregnancy, and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating
to the birthing process.  And so for us it was educational [laughter] as well
as exercise beneficial.  So,

A.73:  At least its something you enjoy.  I know a lot of people that talk about
exercise and say, Well, I don't want to exercise, it's too much work.  But
there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't
have to strain yourself or sweat --

B.74:  That's right.

A.75:  -- or be real sore afterwards.

B.76:  Yeah. [laughter] And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like,
Well I've done a good job because I got, worked myself to that point.  But I
guess that you don't want to overdo.  But [baby] {pause}, well have we
reached our limit?  I'm not sure how long we've been talking but, 

A.77:  Yeah, I think we've talked about six minutes or so.

B.78:  Okay, well it's been good talking to you.

A.79:  Been good talking to you as well.

B.80:  Okay, I hope your baby goes well --

A.81:  Thanks.

B.82:  -- comes out well.

A.83:  Yours too.

B.84:  Bye-bye.

A.85:  Bye-bye.
