==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what kind of cars are you looking at?

@B.2:  Well, we've, uh, we've, we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta
Eighty-eight --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac, about three or four years old
--

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- because, uh, I get married in a couple of weeks and I have two kids and
my fiancee has two kids --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- so we need a car that's big enough for six.

A.9:  Yeah [laughter] {pause}.

B.10:  And so we went, I guess it was two weekends ago, we went, uh, car shopping
--

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and looked around.  We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile
Cadillac up there on Central Expressway --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- that, uh, {pause} in addition to getting a new car there, they can get
you a car that's new but it's been, uh, a demonstrator model --

A.15:  Oh, okay.

B.16:  -- for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they
can give you for a new car.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  So, they call this program cars, and they come,

A.19:  [Cough].

B.20:  with a new car warranty, and it just seems to make sense to me to get the
most car for your money to get something like that.

A.21:  Right.  That's a real good deal.  In fact my dad recently got a, um, a
Pontiac, uh, believe six thousand --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and he got a demo.

B.24:  Okay.

A.25:  And it's been a real good car --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- and it's, it's like new --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and it only had, had very, very low mileage on it.

B.30:  Sure.

A.31:  And so I think he got a real good deal.  Of course, they're fully loaded
usually.

B.32:  Oh yeah.

A.33:  So it's, I think it's a pretty good option.

B.34:  Yeah, I think so too.

A.35:  Are the, uh, Oldsmobiles that you're looking at, are they the demos or they
used, are they new [laughter].

B.36:  Well, the ones that we were test driving were the, uh, were the new ones --

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  -- #there.# Uh-huh.  Well now, uh, {pause} now, they may be the
demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in.

A.39:  Uh-huh. {pause} And then the Cadillac is, is definitely a used car or,

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.  He says it'll
probably be gone in a done, and it's probably gone by now.

A.43:  Oh no [laughter].

B.44:  Those things go fast.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  Uh, of course we're not, we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac,
because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  But when they're three years old they're, the price already drops in half.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  So then it becomes, uh, more realistic.

A.51:  Right.  That's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get
another brand new car because last two cars are brand new --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- or do I look for a used car that's maybe two, three years old that --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- but that's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.  But I just, I kind
of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because
you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it.  Is it a
lemon, or [laughter],

B.56:  That's right.

A.57:  or is something wrong with it but --

B.58:  That's right.

A.59:  -- I guess that's a risk you have to take.  

B.60:  Well, you can reduce that risk by, uh, having the car checked out, I mean,
you know, if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do
this --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- but if you've narrowed it down to one or two --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- you can have the car, uh, uh, checked at, uh, an independent service
station --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can
find anything wrong, because they don't have any financial interest in it.

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  And then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  About how much do they charge to do something like that, do you
know?

B.70:  Oh, I'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars.

A.71:  Yeah, that's not bad.

B.72:  No, huh-uh.

A.73:  It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car [laughter].

B.74:  I would, I would think so.

A.75:  to find out.

B.76:  I would think so.

A.77:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars
because I just got mine paid off about a month ago, and I,

B.78:  Isn't that a good feeling.

A.79:  Yes, I don't want to think about buying a car for a while.  I just want to
enjoy [hum] not having any car payments for a while --

B.80:  That's right.

A.81:  -- and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and, uh, you know, hang
on to the one I've got for a few years because it's, it's, it's almost four
years old, but it's still in great shape.  I have a Mazda R X seven.

B.82:  Well, what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for
three or four years --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it.

A.85:  Yeah, I just about could really --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- because I think my car, if I continue taking good care of it, it's going
to hold a pretty good resale value --

B.88:  Oh yeah.

A.89:  -- and, uh, if I consider going the used car route and save up some money,
I shouldn't have too much trouble at all.

B.90:  Yeah, I, I would think that's true.

A.91:  Could you hold on for just a moment?

B.92:  Sure.

A.93:  [Clicking] [beep] {on phone} [/hum] Okay.  I'm on a cordless phone, and I
was picking up, uh, some background noise, so I just switched the channel up
on it.  I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record.

B.94:  Right, right, that's fine.

A.95:  Anyway. {pause} But, uh, I really, I really enjoy the car I have now, and
I do want to hold onto it and, and you know, enjoy it while it's not having
any mechanical problems whatsoever,

B.96:  That's right.

A.97:  in fact it never has --

B.98:  That's right.

A.99:  -- and, uh, it's been kind of nice, and I, surprisingly enough after four
years, I'm not tired of the car at all and --

B.100:  Well.

A.101:  -- I want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while I'm
not tired of it and while I'm single --

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  -- and can handle a two seater for now [laughter] --

B.104:  That's right.

A.105:  -- and get that out of my system.

B.106:  That's right.

A.107:  Because one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too.

B.108:  Eventually.

A.109:  So [laughter],

B.110:  Yeah, the first two cars I ever bought, well, uh, uh, I've bought three
cars, and I've always bought them new.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  The first car I kept for thirteen and a half years --

A.113:  Wow.

B.114:  -- and got a hundred and sixty-one thousand out of it.

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  The second car I ever bought I drive to work now.  That just turned ten
years old, and I've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  So that, that's kind of in the way I've done things is to get things that
are new and then keep them forever.

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  {Pause} But, uh, {pause} my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.

A.121:  Oh my gosh [laughter].

B.122:  About, about a quart every hundred miles.

A.123:  Oh, no.

B.124:  So, but, uh, it runs fine, all you hav-, it's just very thirsty.

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  If I just keep the oil in, it seems to be okay.  But, you know, that's a
sign that I'm going to have to do something sooner or later.

A.127:  Right.  What kind of car is it?

B.128:  It's a, a Buick Century.

A.129:  Uh-huh.  Are you going to trade it in on this new one or,

B.130:  No, my fiance is selling, uh, a nineteen seventy-eight Cutlass Supreme that
she has.  It's actually,

A.131:  Okay.

B.132:  in better condition than my car.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  {Pause} And so she's going to get some money for that and take some money
from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible --

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  -- to keep the monthly payment low.

A.137:  So she's going to sell it rather than trade it in.

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  That's probably the best thing.

B.140:  You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in.

A.141:  Or maybe more than that, as I've learned.

B.142:  Oh really.

A.143:  Yeah.  When I bought my R X seven, I, uh, best offer I got for my other car
was twenty-five hundred.  Well I turned around and sold it myself for
forty-two hundred.  So,

B.144:  Oh there you go.

A.145:  You can do much better.  I'm glad you're, you're taking care of it
yourself.  I, I think trading it in, they just use that as additional, they
may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying, but they
just, are going to give you that much less for your trade in.

B.146:  Well that's fact.

A.147:  What I think.  So,

B.148:  I think you're right.

A.149:  But strangely enough, the best off-, I mean, the best bargaining I had made
with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price --

B.150:  Interesting.

A.151:  -- trade in, but it's a place in Arlington, and I think, maybe, as you get
outside the Dallas area, I kind of, I bet you it's kind of what I decided.
Well, maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better
prices, plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program.

B.152:  Okay, did, did you use it at the car shop place.

A.153:  Well, it's before they had that.  

B.154:  Oh, okay.

A.155:  I had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which
dealers participated in the, in the fleet program,

B.156:  That's right, yeah.

A.157:  and what you could expect, they said, you know, a five percent over cost
--

B.158:  Right.

A.159:  -- and then options at cost and everything.

B.160:  Right.

A.161:  So, I figured out a price based on that.

B.162:  Yeah, that's good.

A.163:  But I, I guess I got a pretty good deal, because I went back to the Town
North Mazda right off Central --

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  -- and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to
get it for in Arlington --

B.166:  Right.

A.167:  -- and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price,
especially if we add on the equalizer --

B.168:  Yeah.

A.169:  -- and the cruise control.

B.170:  Yeah.

A.171:  He said, You're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage.
And they just laughed at me.  And I went the next morning to Arlington, and
they gave it to me for that price.  And what's so funny, they took the car,
they, I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that's where
the white one was.

B.172:  Is that right.

A.173:  And they had already told me, We located one at Town North.  So it was that
same car.

B.174:  My gosh.

A.175:  Yeah, well, unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage
[laughter], I got the car off your lot for that price [laughter].

B.176:  And you laughed all the way to the bank.

A.177:  Oh I did.  And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand
mile checkup --

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  -- and, uh, that they required you to do.  And I took it to Town North, and
sure enough I saw that guy, and he recognized me.

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  He said, Oh, hi, Dana, and he kind of looked down and saw that car, and I'm
sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day --

B.182:  Yeah.

A.183:  -- of course, when the place in Arlington went and took the car --

B.184:  That's right.

A.185:  -- because I told him there's a place in Arlington that's going to give it
to me for that price.  He said, No they're not.

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  And the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington.  So
I'm sure he knew [laughter].

B.188:  Such a deal.

A.189:  So I loved it.  I sat there, and I just had the biggest grin on my face.

B.190:  I'll bet you did.

A.191:  It was kind of nice.

B.192:  Well, Dana, it's been really interesting, I appreciate talking with you.

A.193:  Yeah.  Good talking to you too, Don.

B.194:  Okay have a good evening.

A.195:  Okay, good luck in your car hunting.

B.196:  Thank you much.

A.197:  Uh-huh.  #Bye-bye.#

B.198:  #Bye-bye.#
