=============================================================================

A.1:  Hey, Dick, who's your favorite team?

B.2:  I think I'm going to have to go with the Chicago Bears.

A.3:  Oh, how come?

B.4:  Well, I like Mike Ditka.

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  And, um, of course, I used to like Jim McMahon and, you know, uh, Walter
Payton --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- but they got rid of them.  But I still like Ditka and I think they've
got, still got a pretty good team if they could just find a real good
quarterback.

A.9:  Yeah, they really, uh, uh, they found out that all the guys that were
backing up McMahon, when they got to be the first guys, weren't all that good
after all.

B.10:  Yeah, I was kind of, I was, I was disappointed.  They came along pretty
good, but, but they just didn't have anybody that could actually go in there
and win the game.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Tomczak was, was trying hard, but he just can't do it.

A.13:  Yeah, and, or they found that Tomczak really wasn't a, he was a good backup
quarterback was what he was.

B.14:  He's not a starter.

A.15:  Yeah, yeah, he wasn't the guy to take them, take them to the championship.

B.16:  So I'm hoping maybe they'll draft a good quarterback this year.  I don't
know who they're going to get, but ((I hope)),

A.17:  Yeah, I don't, I don't know what's out there for quarterbacks, and they've
got a what, about a mid, a mid first round choice, I think.

B.18:  Yeah, they don't have much in the way of rounds, but,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  who knows, if they don't get one maybe they can trade for one.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  After all, you know, I, New Orleans picked up, uh, old, Steve Mo-, or
Walsh.

A.23:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Steve Walsh,

B.24:  Who's your favorite team?

A.25:  yeah, he had, had had sort of mixed success with them, uh,

B.26:  I, think he'll be okay once he gets on (( )).

A.27:  when he was there, but, well, I, I think once he goes into training camp
with them and gets a full year at, uh, to do it, it, it'll work out okay for
him.  I, uh, you know, I, uh, he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because,
my gosh, Aikman was the number one choice, number one draft choice, uh, and
with a longterm six year contract and they were paying,

B.28:  And a bunch of, and a bunch of money, oh yeah.

A.29:  him a lot of money.  So Walsh, yeah, Walsh didn't have that much.  Uh,
well, as you probably guessed, I'm a Cowboy fan, uh,

B.30:  Gee, that's too bad,

A.31:  more or less. 

B.32:  that's too bad.

A.33:  And, well, it's hard, uh, because,

B.34:  It must get a long time between thrills.

A.35:  Yeah, uh, I was here in nineteen sixty.  Well, I got to go back ((that)).
I moved down from Pittsburgh --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- in, in fifty-nine and, uh, in fifty-eight, I really became a pro
football fan, went to all the Steelers home games and they finished second
that year, I guess.  And it was Bobby Lane's first, it was the year that Bobby
Lane got traded to them,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  two games into the season.  Uh, so, that's where I started cutting my
teeth on the N F L, and then I got to Dallas and we didn't have any N F L in
fifty-nine.  So I sat and watched, uh, watched it on television.  Then at the
end of the fifty-nine season, when they announced we're going to get a team in
sixty, I went out and bought two season tickets and I was in the first twelve
season ticket holders --

B.40:  Good grief.

A.41:  -- for the Cowboys.

B.42:  You still got them?

A.43:  Uh, yeah, except I don't use them.  Uh, [laughter] then what happened, so
we go a little bit further than that, uh, [swallowing] and I, uh, uh, I was
single then, later I got married.  And I had my two season tickets and they
were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard
line.  Uh, it was really nice [laughter].  And, uh, in the early days, uh, you
know, ten, twelve, fourteen thousand people, I'm talking about sixty through,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  about sixty-four --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- uh, was what we got.  I also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans
football team,

B.48:  Oh, the old Kansas City Chiefs, yeah.

A.49:  which is now the Kansas City Chiefs, and I, and I may have been the only
one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like
both.  You had to,

B.50:  Oh, yeah.

A.51:  like one and hate the other.  And, and it was interesting because the A F
L, uh, when, when the Chiefs, when the Texans were playing, they would give
the scores of the Cowboy games and the N F L games, but the N F L refused to
admit they existed, so when the Cowboys were playing, you never got the scores
of their games.

B.52:  Huh.

A.53:  And it, you know, it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison
crowd.  And, uh, and the, the popular joke around Dallas was that after the
sixty-two season, uh, in fact, I went down to Houston in sixty-two and watched
them win the A F L championship.  Uh, after the sixty-two season, Murchison
and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  And, uh, then in, uh, uh, sixty, uh, uh, let's see, sixty-nine, when they
decided to build the new stadium in Irving, uh, they let the, uh, uh, they let
the fans build it.  I mean, it wasn't built with any tax payer money.  Uh,
they floated bonds that the, that the season ticket holders had to buy to
maintain their status as season ticket holders.  So what was neat is,

B.56:  [Cough].

A.57:  you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket
holder and, uh, so I had a first choice, and, uh, I got in the upper tier.
Uh, ((yeah)), actually, there was two types of seats.  There were two hundred
and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy
[laughter].

B.58:  Good grief.

A.59:  And so I got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds, so
I was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line.  I ((wonder
if)) that guy that's in the eleventh row, see, he bought thousand dollar bonds
[laughter].

B.60:  Huh.

A.61:  That guy.  So, uh, that happened, then, uh, ultimately, I had, uh, I got
transferred overseas by T-, I'm with T I,

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  and I got transferred overseas, uh, through most of the eighties, so I,
ea-, each year I just sold my t-, I had some people take custody of my tickets
for me.  I served, uh, three year-, four years in Malaysia and three in the
Philippines.

B.64:  Huh.

A.65:  And, uh, now I got back, I got kids in college, and, gosh, I can't afford
that price so I still keep them in my name, but the guy who takes them calls
me every year and says, can I have the tickets one more year?  I say yeah,
fine, take them.

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  So I still hold them but I don't go.

B.68:  Oh, ((that's too bad)).

A.69:  But, uh, the, the funny thing about the Cowboys is, is that everybody is
really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices,
and, uh, but when you look back on the team, uh, uh, except for probably
Emmett Smith, nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve years is a
starter.

B.70:  No, I'm kind of, uh, actually, uh, I think they've got the draft choices to
make, to make a good run at it, but I, I'm not sure how ((well)) they'll
draft,

A.71:  But if you don't make smart selections, it doesn't do any good, or if you
make smart selections and they, and you can't sign them.

B.72:  ((Yeah, they'r-,)), they're having trouble doing a little bit of both.

A.73:  Yeah, well, I heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and I, and I, it
must border on legality or ethnicity.  On draft day, he's got about thirty
people that are going out to their potential players, and when it comes their
time to choose, they get thirty minutes or so.  These people will negotiate
with the players and get them to sign a contract, and if they won't sign a
contract, they won't draft them.

B.74:  Huh.

A.75:  And, and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that.

B.76:  So you,

A.77:  And, uh,

B.78:  you got thirty minutes to make your decision, then.

A.79:  Yeah, because, see, last year their first two draft choices were, uh, Alex,
uh, Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn't get either of them until
half way through the season and,

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  they didn't get to go through training camp with them.

B.82:  Well, Smith came on pretty good.  Wright was --

A.83:  Yeah, Smith came on pretty good.  Wright is,

B.84:  -- Wright didn't do much.

A.85:  is still in the, in the potential category.  Everybody likes his speed,
but he can't catch the ball.

B.86:  And it doesn't ((do him as good)) to run down field if he can't catch the
ball.

A.87:  No, no, no, but, but, you know, that's where Bob Hayes was in his early
days, too.  So,

B.88:  I'll be interested to see how they do.  Of course, actually, I was in
Dallas in, of course, I worked for T I, too,

A.89:  ((Huh)).

B.90:  for a while, and I left them, I guess in eighty-two.  But I was in Dallas
there when, uh, Roger Staubach and --

A.91:  Oh, yeah.

B.92:  -- all the bunches up there, and,

A.93:  Yeah, well, those were the glory years.

B.94:  and, uh,

A.95:  The seventies were absolutely,

B.96:  I got so tired, I, I guess I just got so tired of hearing about the
Dallas Cowboys and, and, you know, what-, whatever the Cowboys did that day --

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  -- that it just kind of turned me against them.

A.99:  Yeah [laughter].  And, and, and, and, and the seventies were really a, it,
it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to
Texas Stadium.

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  Uh, and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of,
uh, of the seventy-one season, and that was the year they went to the Super
Bowl and beat Miami,

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  in the Super Bowl.  The previous year that they'd finished in the Cotton
Bowl, they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in the, in the,
in the last second or two.  But, uh, I mean, in the seventies it was play-offs
every year.

B.104:  I had some friends of mine, well, I guess, it's, it's some friends of my
parents, uh, lived in Dallas and, of course, they're avid, you know, just avid
Cowboys fans.  And, uh, they have this, uh, little mini-Winnebago that they
take out there on game day.

A.105:  Oh, yeah, there's so many people do that.

B.106:  And, uh, we used, and, uh, we used to, ((well)), my first wife and I used
to go out with them all the time because every Sunday, you know, the,

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  the Cowboys there, they had like four tickets.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  They, they, they had four tickets because their kids were there.  Of
course, their kids came and went.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  But, uh, every time the kids didn't go, we'd go and we'd go out there and
just, you know, at, at like ten o'clock in the morning and set up and there
would be all these people gathered around that, you know, all the tailgaters
and stuff.  And then everybody would wander into the stadium, you know.

A.113:  [Laughter] Well, I own four tick-, I might, I told you I had two.  I
actually own four, and in seventy-one, the year they moved into the stadium, I
bought two more because I had, uh, two children and they were very little, and
we just ended up taking the neighbors kids, who were teenagers, because our, I
thought that ultimately my own would want to go, and the way the stadium was
selling out in season tickets, it might be totally sold out, which it never
did.  But, uh, uh, at twenty-nine dollars a pop now, let's see, six ((four's,
is, uh,)),

B.114:  Is it that much (( ))?

A.115:  that's a hundred and sixteen dollars,

B.116:  ((Damn)).

A.117:  and another five for parking, so that's a hundred and twenty-one dollars,
and with two kids in college and the potential of having,

B.118:  Uh, yeah.

A.119:  three there next September, uh, I, you know, I'm going to watch them on
television for a few years [tone].

B.120:  I would imagine.  Speaking of that, what are your Cowboys going to do for
backup quarterback?

A.121:  Uh, boy, they don't have one.

B.122:  We sure figured out that old ((Babe Wassenberg)) they don't be walking 
(( )).

A.123:  Yeah, they, they sure, they sure found out in a hurry that ((Babe
Wassenberg)) wasn't it, didn't they?

B.124:  Yeah, he was pretty good staying on the sidelines and (( )) but he wasn't,
he wasn't worth a damn in the game.

A.125:  Yeah, but you know, it's, it's interesting because old, uh, uh, you know
everybody said when they signed Steve Wal-, boy, they're going to have to
trade him, [/tone] they're going to have to trade him.  But you cannot
seriously contend, uh, in the league without two front line quarterbacks.
And, and, and you know, the years that we were good we had Staubach and
Morton.

B.126:  (( )).

A.127:  Now the one that wasn't playing, the one that wasn't playing was pissed
off most of the time, but nevertheless, in, in over three or four seasons,
both those guys went down with, with severe injuries and the other guy stepped
in and they didn't never,

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  lost a lick.

B.130:  But they were still ((bet your money)) if somebody sent me off.

A.131:  Yeah.

B.132:  I guess being an athlete, of course, I played in high school and college --

A.133:  Yeah.

B.134:  -- and I can understand, you know, wanting to play, but, of course, as I
get more seniority on earth --

A.135:  ((Yeah)).

B.136:  -- I kind of wonder, you know, gosh, if I could sit on the bench and earn
five hundred thousand dollars a year, I'd just be happy to sit there.

A.137:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, that last championship they won in the Super Bowl,
Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the
game.  But he got his winner's share.
