@B.1:  Okay, what is your feeling on drug testing?

A.2:  Well, uh, I'm, I'm for it to be honest with you.  I think, uh, that, um,
uh, honestly, if you feel you have something to hide that would tend to make
you be against it.  But if you don't really have anything to hide even though
I know it is sorted an invasion in ones privacy, uh, I think as a protection
for me and people who do know that we're drug clean, if you will, that, uh,
it's one way to, uh, try to, uh, catch those who might not be and, and, and
the kinds of problems that they can cause in the work environment or even
outside the work environment.  I hate to think about, uh, the fact that, uh, I
might have someone on the job that takes drugs and maybe could maybe on the
way home harm somebody, uh, if, you know, um,

B.3:  Not even,

A.4:  Run over them or something like that.

B.5:  yeah, not even on the way home while on the job. 

A.6:  Oh, yeah, well that, that's right.  I, I, I, I haven't quite thought of
that, uh, that's a very good point.  Now, limitations I, I, I do think there
needs to be some sort of limitations to the way you test because my wife who
is a nurse tells me that there are a lot of drugs, prescriptions drugs like
that the, uh, medical profession can put on and which could cause a test to
show positive.  One point in fact, uh, that was not necessarily the case.  So,
it seems to me that, uh, even though I, I personally think it's a good idea,
that there does need to be some, some, uh, thought given to it some serious
thought about how you can do it, how you can exempt people at least the
expense of time, short or long periods of time, uh, um, who are on
prescriptions drugs, or maybe come up with some other way of being able to
test them.  Uh, I don't know.  Uh, I'm not in the medical profession,

B.7:  [Laughter]. 

A.8:  so, I wouldn't have any idea, but what do you think,

B.9:  Well,

A.10:  about that?  

B.11:  I personally think that it should be done also.  Uh, my feelings are the
same as yours from that standpoint.  I spent thirty-four years in education,

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  as a teacher and administrator, ((right)), 

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  and, uh, so I saw drugs from, um, the early, very early fifties,

A.16:  You saw it begin to come into the schooling system.

B.17:  absolutely, coming into the, uh, the community more,

A.18:  Uh-huh. 

B.19:  and more, and,

A.20:  Oh, that's terrible.

B.21:  the, uh, children being introduced to it and giving it, you know, to get
them started on drugs,

A.22:  Oh, yeah.

B.23:  they give them for nothing.  And,

A.24:  It's horrible. 

B.25:  uh, you know, and then I see, um, um, the, uh, the problem with testing,
uh, now they test athletes, they test horses, uh, [laughter] they test, uh ...

A.26:  Well, now they test athletes for, uh,

B.27:  for steroids. 

A.28:  yes, steroids, #right.# 

B.29:  #Right,# and,

A.30:  Yeah, and the Olympics that's always, that became a common practical
several years ago.

B.31:  Yes. 

A.32:  It just seems to me the idea of having random, and I agree with the idea of
random because that way nobody ever knows for sure when it might be their
time.  I, I, uh, agree that, uh, random checks uh, of, uh, people be it in
schooling systems or on the job, uh, I think the ticks, the topic was suppose
to be on the job.

B.33:  Yes. 

A.34:  Uh, uh, but, I, I think that, uh, that is, uh, in this day and age,

B.35:  Yes. 

A.36:  if the problem ever got under control where it became no longer a problem
then maybe, you know, let the rules relax somewhat.  But,

B.37:  Well, now just stop and think of, of, uh, um, NASA, for example,

A.38:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.39:  All the people who work for NASA are, uh,

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  of course here in Dayton we have, uh, Wright Paterson Air Force, uh,

A.42:  Base, uh-huh.

B.43:  base right here or where there's so much research going on,

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  if these people, uh, are on drugs, uh, it doesn't, the test results, uh,
the results which they are striving for could differently be in error or
misconstrued or misread or any number,

A.46:  Oh, sure.

B.47:  of things which could mean,

A.48:  Absolutely,

B.49:  peoples lives. 

A.50:  a-, a-, and just any as any work place like you say, you said if you've
come from the, in ed-, education,

B.51:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.52:  environment.  You know you said you don't want teachers,

B.53:  That's right. 

A.54:  or principles, or administrators on the job who, uh, uh, just as guilty of
something that we want pre-,

B.55:  That's right.

A.56:  prevent the student body from taking part in.  It do-, doesn't set a good
example.  There's also the matter of the same kinds of problems you get into
in terms of handling ki-, uh, kids.  Uh, uh, teaching kids, uh, it can cause
erratic behavior.  It can cause all kinds of major problems.

B.57:  It can and it does.

A.58:  Uh-huh. 

B.59:  It do-, most, most,

A.60:  I see, well, 

B.61:  differently does. 

A.62:  do they have any kind of random testing in the schooling system,

B.63:  No, we,

A.64:  over the teachers or students? 

B.65:  We do not have,

A.66:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.67:  uh, we, um, no, I spent the first eighteen years on, in sch-, between
two schools on the west side of Dayton, which was primarily black,

A.68:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.69:  and the last fourteen years I spent, um, doing nothing but resolving
problems with schools that were assigned to me that couldn't be resolved on a
local level,

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  which could be a complaint on a principal or teacher, or a riot,

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  a bus action, stabbing,

A.74:  Um.

B.75:  taking parents to court, kids to court, and what have you,

A.76:  Um, um, um.

B.77:  and I was on the east end of Dayton which is primarily Appalachian,

A.78:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.79:  and, uh, I could ((by)) see a tremendous difference between it, but we
would see, uh, children, um, taking, uh, a product called toil.  Which is a
Toluene, which is used,

A.80:  I never heard of it.

B.81:  to clean automobiles motors and what have you,

A.82:  Oh, Lord.

B.83:  and they would put this in, they have, they'd steal a whole gallon of
it and we finally found the chemical company from where they were stealing it.
Tapping through the bottom of a, a semitrailer because it's so volatile.
The, uh, companies could not keep it inside a co-, a, uh, building,

A.84:  Um. 

B.85:  and they would tap it from underneath, drain off a gallon, put a gallon
in an abandoned house and the kids would go to the abandoned house, wet a
cloth with it, put the cloth in a plastic bag and then inhale the fumes.

A.86:  [Noise].

B.87:  And, they, they, they do this like on lunchtime, they come back to school
and they'd have red marks all around the nose and mouth and we knew
immediately what they had been doing,

A.88:  Um, um.

B.89:  and then would have to try to take appropriate action. 

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  But, uh, you know, there are a lot of things we think in terms of drugs.
We think of crack, we think of heroin,

A.92:  Uh-huh, um, 

B.93:  we think of marijuana, we forgot that there are other types, of, of, uh,
habituating drugs that are used [barking],

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  that are just as dangerous as, as the others. 

A.96:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.97:  So, uh, it's, I, you know, [barking] it's, it's terrible [barking], um,

A.98:  Well,

B.99:  of,

A.100:  don't you agree [barking] though that if I do test [barking] in, in, in a
company or a business, or in a government agency that random testing is,

B.101:  I think so,

A.102:  the right way to do it [barking]. 

B.103:  uh, I, I see nothing wrong [barking] with that. I think that, that it
should be [barking], uh, better accepted than, um, uh, forced testing of
everyone,

A.104:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.105:  uh, it, uh, perhaps people would accept it better and then [barking],

A.106:  Uh-huh.

B.107:  they know perhaps of a, of future years down the road, uh, 

A.108:  Uh-huh.

B.109:  that, uh, uh, mandatory testing if every-, everyone could, uh, would come
about just as small pox vaccinations were for years,

A.110:  Right, right.

B.111:  and some of the other types of vaccinations for syphilis and gonorrhea,

A.112:  Oh, yeah,

B.113:  what have you. 

A.114:  yeah.  Well don't you think the government really in this case should set
a good example,

B.115:  Yes.

A.116:  by ((them)) doing it first. 

B.117:  Absolutely.  And I think it should start right with our legislatures.

A.118:  Well I agree.  I, I concur a hundred percent.  I,

B.119:  Yeah, and you know,

A.120:  really do.  And, uh, it's not the cities you can, people go and
petition the legislatures to do.  Uh, unfortunately it seems to be the sort of
thing that somehow legislatures do to pressure from the private,

B.121:  Yes.

A.122:  sector when you're having trouble.  Have to eventually bring to the
legislatures to get them to enact and then it final comes to government,

B.123:  Absolutely.

A.124:  and I'll always be a little disappointed that we the government sometimes
don't initiated certain things like that, I mean, we, we did back in the
Kennedy time try to initiate the civil rights,

B.125:  Yes.

A.126:  issue.  But, on, on, on just hundreds of other issues is seems like we
sort of sit back and react rather than,

B.127:  That's right.

A.128:  act. 

B.129:  But, but, we, we do, uh, legislate, uh, things now like, uh, children in
the seats, in car safety seats,

A.130:  Oh, you mean, uh,

B.131:  seat belts,

A.132:  yeah right. 

B.133:  we can legislate them, we can legislate say children cannot get into
school without having certain immunizations to protect them.  You would think
that we would, you know, taken another step further, than the,

A.134:  Uh-huh.

B.135:  we'd have, uh, some other kind of protection for them.  Uh, uh, in for
the staff, the people, you know, and I understand they, they fear,

A.136:  Uh-huh.

B.137:  as I'm sure your wife will tell you of age. 

A.138:  Oh, yeah right.  Well, testing has several things that, that come along
with it.  It, it, it enables you to, uh, uh, if you do find someone, then it
enables you do two things.  One, It enables you to help them not necessarily,

B.139:  Oh, absolutely ((it)) helps.

A.140:  to fire them.  But, but it should be given in a positive light so that
you can try to help them,

B.141:  Absolutely.

A.142:  and at the same time you can find out where they're getting the
substances from, it puts pressure on those who try to push things illegal like
that, because they know that the people that they're pushing it to, if they're
in a work place where they can be randomly checked when it happens then they
stand a chance of being turned in and you got ways now of cutting the whole
traffic trade because of the fact that you've got,

B.143:  Right, right.

A.144:  that kind ever pressure. 

B.145:  Well, that, that's very true and it is an immense problem and I think that,
that perhaps they, uh, money is spent in the wrong spots.  Uh, I, th-, I, uh,
am very much in favor of the types programs we're having in our schools here
now with, uh, teaching children.  We have a program called, uh, DARE.  Um,

A.146:  Uh-huh.

B.147:  I wish I could remember what all it stood for but, it was against, uh, ways
to, uh, say no to alcohol and drugs,

A.148:  Uh-huh. 

B.149:  and the police departments in all the communities in and around the
Dayton area have teams which go into the schools in the first, second, and
third grades,

A.150:  Uh-huh.

B.151:  and they, their talking with the children on that level and that's to me
the level where you need to have it.  You can't wait until their already in
high school because they've already tried it long before that,

A.152:  Uh-huh.

B.153:  and, uh, but you implant the idea that this is not what they need to be
doing for themselves,

A.154:  Uh-huh.

B.155:  and here's how to,
