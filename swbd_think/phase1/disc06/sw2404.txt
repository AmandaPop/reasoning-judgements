she was too close to the phone, as well as breath sounds in the phone.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I've kind of resisted having any pets because, well, I had some pets
as a child, but now that I have two kids they're sort of like (( )) you have
to take care of them a lot, and they require a lot of time and, um, neatness,
and plus, you know, now that I'm married I have a husband, that I do some
things that, you know, help him --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and so it seems like I have plenty things to do, and so I thought that
if we got a pet that that would be just one more person.

B.4:  What kind of pet did you have as, what kind of pets did you have as
children?

A.5:  Well, the kids, you know, the kids wanted, the kids love all kinds of pets,
you know, cats and dogs and things.  And I know some kinds of pets are more
[throat_clearing] independent.  And as a child I had, um, you know, like a, we
had a dog and we had turtles, and we had, you know, small, lot of the small
things.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Like I know we got a little bunny at Easter, a little baby chicken, and all
that, but they say --

B.8:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- you shouldn't do that any more but, um,

B.10:  We, I had a cat, that I've had for about eight or nine years.

A.11:  Oh yeah.

B.12:  And I wouldn't trade her for anything [laughter].  I also have a child.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Cat's lot easier [laughter] to take care of than the chi-,

A.15:  Yes.

B.16:  You can go away and leave her for a few days.

A.17:  They can take care of themselves, especially cats are pretty good about
being independent.

B.18:  Yeah, I've left her, well I've left her alone up to about four days --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- because she doesn't, she's real good.  She doesn't overeat or anything,
and so I can leave food out and know that, you know, she only eats when she's
hungry.  I know some people have cats that no matter how much you put down
they'll eat it all.

A.21:  Oh yeah.

B.22:  And then if I'm, if I'm gone longer than that, then I'll have somebody come
in and, um, you know, make sure that she has food and, and fresh water.
Usually I just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen.  And I've
even, she drinks out of the toilet [laughter].

A.23:  [Laughter] Well, we just last week, we got a gerbil.  That's a thing that
I picked for the kids --

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  -- #because# they were wanting to have a pet, and I didn't want to have one.
I picked gerbils because they apparently, they aren't like, you know, they
don't smell as bad [laughter].

B.26:  Well (( )) if you don't keep them clean.  My friend had gerbils and you
could smell it the minute [laughter] you walked into her house.

A.27:  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  And I don't like that odor, and, um, they don't
require as much, but we'll see how it works out.  It wasn't as, it's not
something that, um, I had to like learn to --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- something that's going to be running around your house, that if you're
unaccustomed to that, you wouldn't like such a big change.  And they stay in
their little cage --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- and you throw a few things in there.  They're not loving, you know, you
know, like a ca-,

B.32:  Can you hold, will they let you hold them?

A.33:  Well, we're just getting used to them right now.  We're kind of just
letting, you know, touching them, and we've picked them up before, but that
was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now.

B.34:  Are they young?  Do you know how old they are?  

A.35:  Well, they, they seem like, you know, they were smaller compared to some of
the other ones.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  But we, we, I did that, I let the kids have a pet because I wanted them to
have practice in caring for someone else and, you know, not being so selfish.

B.38:  How old are your kids?

A.39:  They're four and five. 

B.40:  Okay.  Mine's five.

A.41:  And I thought it would be good for them to just practice, you know, having
someone else to care for and everything.  I know that a lot of pets, a lot of
people have pets because they make good companions --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- and friends and,

B.44:  They do, or my cat does to me, like she doesn't like anybody but me.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  In fact no one would know I had her because if anyone comes over she
immediately goes into hiding.

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  But, I, I had a dog for a while, before I had my son, and I grew up, we
grew up having dogs, and I would like to have a dog, but kind of like for the
same reasons as you, I just, the care that goes into them, and, you know, if I
decide to take off for a week or so, you know I can't leave a dog like I can
leave a cat.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  And plus because they require a lot in the way of training and, which now
that I'm home, would probably be a good time to do it if I were going to do
it, [child] but, you know, I just don't, you know, there, I don't know why,
but with dogs it seems you have to have a lot more vet bills plus they're a
lot more expensive to get.  Now my cat, I've had her for eight or nine years.
I had her spayed and I had her declawed, which, you know, was an initial
expense, but then she has not been sick one day.  I have never had her to the
vet other than, just her, you know, her maintenance stuff, and it seems like
whenever I've had a dog, you know, something always, they're always getting
sick, or, you know, breaking a leg --

A.51:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.52:  -- or something, and I guess I don't need that expense right now.  Plus
they eat more and, 

A.53:  Expensive to maintain, and keep the flea powder and the flea dip, and
[laughter].

B.54:  Yeah, that, yeah, I don't know if that's such a big problem here in Dallas.

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  My cat stays inside because she's declawed, so I don't really have a
problem with that.  But yeah, if you had a dog, you know, they need exercise,
and you have to walk them.

A.57:  That's true.  They are a lot, I guess that's the number one reason why I'm
{pause} not really ready to have a pet too much [laughter].  I kind of
consider these gerbils just kind of something you forget --

B.58:  Not really pets, just kind of things.

A.59:  -- because they don't really acknowledge that they know you.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  You know, it's not like a pet pe-,.  A pet is someone that comes up to you
and is happy to see you --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- and that kind of thing.

B.64:  They make you feel special, you know.  I live alone with my five year old
and my cat, and she really does, she makes me feel like she cares about me 
and --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- you know, it gives you some strokes there that you may not get
otherwise, because I'm cooped up in the house all day.  And um, I would like
to have, what I would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really
nice fish.

A.67:  Um.  

B.68:  But until I get in a place where I feel like that's where I'm going to be
for a long time --

A.69:  A long time.

B.70:  -- they're just so hard to move.

A.71:  Yes, and they, they take up a lot of, you know, good space, you know, kind
of like a bookcase.

B.72:  Now I have some friends who have aquariums, and I enjoy watching the fish
and looking in at them, you know.  But that's something that you really, I
feel, need to learn about and read about.  You know, you need to learn how to
take care of them, and you need to learn what fish are compatible, you know,
what ones you can put together and what ones you can't.  You know, how to feed
them, and how to, you know, to clean them.  You know, the thought of cleaning
an aquarium is not very [laughter] pleasing --

A.73:  No.

B.74:  -- but with filters and all that stuff that they have now, I mean, they're
almost maintenance free.

A.75:  Yes, and I noticed, um, that's kind of what I was attracted to these
gerbils for, is that they, they have a certain area that they use like their
bathroom.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  And you can just, um, you know, rinse that out.  It's kind off to the side,
it unscrews and --

B.78:  Well, that's good.

A.79:  -- and so you can just take it out with a garden hose, rinse it out --

B.80:  Oh.

A.81:  -- and you, supposedly you don't have to change all of the, the bedding and
everything except every three weeks --

B.82:  #(( )) that's not bad.#

A.83: #-- which is not very often.#

B.84:  I used to have, I guess when I was in high school or junior high, I managed
to talk my parents into letting me have a gerbil.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  I won't tell you what happened to it [laughter].

A.87:  Oh no.

B.88:  (( )) [laughter].

A.89:  It's something awful [laughter].  Oh.

B.90:  (( )) part of it was my fault.  I guess I just didn't take care of it like
I should have.

A.91:  Um.  Well, I'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the kids
and a little bit of a,

B.92:  Do they like to watch him?

A.93:  They do, and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it, but I, these
just aren't going to be as tame as the book. I got a book first.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  [Throat_clearing] They just don't seem like, um, well I guess we've have
them about a week now, and they're just not kind of,

B.96:  How many did you get?  Did you get #two?#

A.97:  #two.#

B.98:  Are they male or female?  Does that make a difference?

A.99:  Well, we hope that we got two females, so that they're supposed to get
along better --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and they won't have any babies.

B.102:  But you don't really know?

A.103:  I guess we won't know unless they never have any babies [laughter].

B.104:  [Laughter] Really, until there are about six more in the cage.

A.105:  Well, you know, the people that sold them go, well, it's hard to tell, but
we think {speaking as the sellers did} [laughter],

B.106:  [Laughter].

A.107:  and we're going, oh great.

B.108:  Oh no.

A.109:  So if they have babies, then we'll have to get rid of one of them.

B.110:  But I've heard that it-, after they have babies that you have to separate
the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies.

A.111:  Yeah, that's what I hear, so I'm hoping, I think they have a really quick
reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  So within a month I guess, [laughter] we'll know.

B.114:  [Laughter] That's funny.

A.115:  Well, I guess I better run now.

B.116:  Okay, well it was nice talking to you.

A.117:  Yes, nice, 

B.118:  And good luck.  

A.119:  Well, thanks, and it was nice to hear that you've had such good luck with
your cat.

B.120:  Yeah, I know my cat, she's reaching her life expectancy, and I'm already
thinking, oh no.
