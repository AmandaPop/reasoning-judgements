REMARKS:        Speaker A (male voice) is very loud and difficult to determine 
what he is saying because of the loudness and the echo.  Short space in 
conversation filled with blank pauses; marked these in the text and filled 
in what was missing from the individual speakers' section.  Buzz came on
the phone and continued.  This also marked in text.

==============================================================================

A.1:  In Dallas, about another block over, I'm in Garland [laughter].  So,

B.2:  [Laughter] That's funny --

A.3:  I'm not very far away.

B.4:  -- I didn't expect to have any more calls.

A.5:  Oh, okay.

B.6:  I thought I was, uh, through.  I had done ten.

A.7:  Oh, I don't know, is there a limit on it? 

B.8:  I thought ten was the maximum.

A.9:  Okay, I didn't know that, because I got to be pushing ten some where.  I
lost count around six or seven.

B.10:  Yeah.  I've been writing mine down just in case anything, you know, just.

A.11:  Yeah, I should have been, and I just, I just forgot to.  So, uh, we're, uh,
you work at T I?

B.12:  I did.  I don't any more.

A.13:  Oh, I, I, I do, 

B.14:  My husband does.

A.15:  but I'm not going to be at the end of this month [laughter].

B.16:  Oh, well, where you going?

A.17:  I'm an ex T I-er.  I'm officially retiring.  

B.18:  Oh, how neat.

A.19:  Unofficially I'm going to go work for a supplier of ours.  

B.20:  Well [laughter] that's a good choice.

A.21:  A company called Onum.

B.22:  Oh, Onum.

A.23:  Yeah, located in Korea.

B.24:  Yeah, I know them, I used to work with them.

A.25:  You, you did?

B.26:  I was a mechanical engineer.  I did, uh, package design, and I, when we
first contacted on them years ago, I was part of the Gene Rickey, was part of
that,

A.27:  Oh okay, well, you worked with a whole bunch of friends of mine then.

B.28:  Yep, probably.

A.29:  Yeah, I know, Gene's in Sherman now.  

B.30:  Yeah, he's been there for, since I left.

A.31:  Oh, okay, 

B.32:  Well, I worked up there for a year.

A.33:  and I was in the Philippines for about three or four years, and Gene used
to come out and visit us,

B.34: Oh yeah,

A.35:  while I was in the Philippines.

B.36:  he made a lot of trips.

A.37:  Yeah, well the Vice President for Operations for Onum stationed in Korea is
a guy named Michael Bryant.

B.38:  I don't know him.

A.39:  He used to be a, a vi-, in fact he started four of the T I plants --

B.40:  Um.

A.41:  -- and he left T I about eight or nine years ago and went elsewhere, and
he's, he came through town and visited with me, and bottom line is I'm going
to retire and go to work for him.

B.42:  [Laughter] That's sound like a good deal.

A.43:  So, uh, we're going to talk about, about advice giving parents to kids
selecting colleges.  You about ready to talk?

B.44:  Yeah, go ahead.

A.45:  Okay (( )), you said you're Judy.

B.46:  Yes.

@A.47:  Okay, Judy.  {pause} [beep] Okay, I'm, I feel like I'm almost an expert on
this subject.  I've got two in college, and if one doesn't graduate, I'm going
to have three, 

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  [Laughter] there by September.

B.50:  Well, how did they decide which colleges to go to and what'd you tell them.

A.51:  Well, its interesting because it sort of fits their, it sort of fits their
personality.  My oldest, who's a senior at U T D now, she, uh, uh, always, our
house borders Richland College.  I mean you walk out our back door and you're
on the campus.  And she, uh, has always, uh, never really wanted to leave
home.  And, uh, it turns out that when she came time to go to college, well,
we're in the Philippines, in fact she stayed out there with us for a year.
Then we brought her back and set her up in apartment.  She went to Richland,
and then moved back in the house when we got back.  But she just kind of went
from Richland to U T D, and it's too bad she's never lived on a campus, and
she has a younger sister who's a freshman at Saint Edwards in Austin who is
living on a campus.

B.52:  Um.

A.53:  And she sees what, what she's missed out of college, now wishes she'd done
something like that.

B.54:  (( )).

A.55:  But at eighteen, you know, uh, I wanted her to go away, but she was just
too much of a home kid.

B.56:  Yeah, that's kind of the way I was when I started school, I was in Midland,
and when I was looking for things, and what I probably recommend to other
people was something that I was comfortable with, and I wasn't quite ready to
be a long ways off,

A.57:  Um.

B.58:  And I knew I wanted to be in engineering, so I was looking for a good
engineering school.  So I ended up going to Tech in Lubbock.

A.59:  Oh, okay.

B.60:  So I was there, I was, you know, two hours away from home, so any weekend I
wanted to come home, I got in the car, hopped [laughter] you know, I was home
in a couple of hours.

A.61:  Oh, that, that's,

B.62:  And so that worked out real well.

A.63:  yeah, that's not a bad deal.  My, my, my middle daughter who's a
freshman, she has always wanted to live on campus, and she'd been kind of a
home body, I mean, this was a kid who, who when she was little and went to
stay over at somebody's house at night, I'd always know I'd get a call at ten
o'clock to come get her [laughter].   Because when it came bedtime she wanted
to be in her own bed.  But, uh, she, uh, I was raised in New England and went
to school in New England, and she always thought she wanted to go to school in
New England.  She and I took an interview trip last year, and she was accepted
by several of the good schools there.  But when it came down time to make a
decision, she said, Dad, I don't think I want to go that far away.  I've never
been away before.

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  So, uh, she wanted to go to a small school --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- so, uh, like a place like U T was out of the question because she needed
to be in a more of a small, small school environment.  So we went down one,
uh, uh, I took a day off from work, and we went down, uh, to St. Edwards and
interviewed, and it just kind of met her, her criteria.  It's a school of
about twenty-five hundred undergraduates on a gigantic big campus, and it's in
Austin's a nice city.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  And she's pretty happy, I mean, here she's finishing up her freshman year,
and she's pretty happy and likes Austin.  And I got a son, though, who is a
senior at Berkner.  He is not academically inclined at all.  He's very kind of
unacademically inclined.  He wants badly to go to Tech because that's where
all his friends in the neighborhood are going.

B.70:  Um.

A.71:  And he, uh, I don't think, he didn't apply, I don't think he'd get admitted
there, but he's started to get enough motivated, he wants to go there, that I
think he'll go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take the
qualifying test and then try to go to Tech the next year.

B.72:  Oh, well, that'd be good.  I think he'd enjoy a lot, it's a good school.

A.73:  Oh, sure.

B.74:  It's a good place to grow up.

A.75:  Yeah, and he [buzz] went out there and spent a weekend here with some
friends here back a month or two, and what I like is that when he saw it, I
think he's now motivated to, to, to go to work.

B.76:  Oh so though so academic standards will improve, yeah.

A.77:  Yeah and the uh uh i- you know one thing you know in in terms of how how I I would advise people is of course you got to look at what you can afford too and the state school system in texas uh is probably one of the least expensive in the world 

B.78:  Absolutely.

A.79:  Again, I mean, people think it's expensive, but you, my goodness state
schools in Massachusetts and the other New England states cost more than
private schools do here.

B.80:  Yes, and a lot of people that I knew would go to school in some really, in
Rochester and some of these really nice, these name schools, and of course
they would get out, but they got, they ended up getting more or less the same
job I did --

A.81:  Yeah, they got a,

B.82:  -- and then they, but they're thirty thousand in debt from student loans.

A.83:  Yeah, you end up getting the same degree, and it's, it's, uh, uh, now I
think that what happens is the prestige, you can't sell that too much --

B.84:  No.

A.85:  -- because after all the degree just gets you in the door.

B.86:  Yes, it's what you do after that.

A.87:  It's what you do after that, that, that, the, th-, that really judges how
far you're going to go with a degree.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  And, I think that, uh, it's getting so darned expensive now.  I went to a
school in Maine, Bowden College in Brunswick, Maine, and it's a small, at that
time all male, school.  There are more male, men's schools than women's
schools in those days.  They're all old New England traditional schools are
now co-ed.  But, uh, I'm talking about early nineteen fifties, and you know,
tuition was six hundred dollars a year.  My goodness, it's eighteen thousand
now.

B.90:  Yeah, it's incredible now.

A.91:  And I don't know how, I mean, they always have a waiting list a mile long
for students,

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  And the only thing I did notice is about seventy percent of the students
are on some kind of financial aid.

B.94:  Yeah, and they're all going to be paid back they're going to be in debt for
the rest of their lives.

A.95:  And they're going to be in debt for the rest of their lives.  Yeah, uh, uh,

B.96:  I guess the main thing if I was recommending to someone, like you said,
you've got, you've got do something you can afford.  But then to go to a
school that also is somewhat well known, at least in the state for what you
want to do.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Like Tech is known to be a good engineering school, and A and M maybe is
known more for computers.

A.99:  Right.

B.100:  And that kind of thing.  I would, I would, if you know what you're going to
do, I think that would be important to deal with too, because, when, then when
you do try to get your foot in the door at the various compa-, the companies
that you would possibly want to work for tend to interview more heavily at
those locations because they know that that particular school had a good
department, you know, in computer science, or in engineering, or in business,
or, or whatever.

A.101:  Yeah, I, I, I think that's exactly right, and you know, a lot of girls are
going to engineering know what they want to do.  You know, I've got two
daughters, that started off (( )) My oldest thought she wanted to major in
psychology, and she's carried through on that.  But Tracy is what in April of
her freshman year, and she's gone from political science to international
studies to bilingual education to elementary education.

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  And fortunately, as a, as a freshman, everything she's taken has been, is
applicable.

B.104:  Will transfer.  So that's good, yeah.

A.105:  Yeah, yeah, its applicable to those degrees, and those are strong degrees
all of them in the school that she's going.

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  And, and I think you made a very good point though that somebody that is
really, has some direction and knows what they want to do, then they need to
go to a school that's got a good reputation in that field.

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  And, uh, uh, but I would guess a very, very small percent of college
freshmen know what they want to do.

B.110:  I think to some extent you're right. 

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  Most people have a general idea --

A.113:  Yeah, I --

B.114:  -- and then there's, there's probably fifty percent have a general idea,
and the other fifty percent are waiting to see what hits them when they get
there.

A.115:  -- yeah, I, I, I, went off to school wanting to either be a high school
algebra teacher or a high school French teacher because my two favorite people
in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher, and, uh, and I was
going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted, we came
time to sign up for majors, and I had taken chemistry for the first time that
year and surprised myself.  I did well in it.

B.116:  Um.

A.117:  And sort of made a decision as we were walk-, me and a friend of mine were
walking over to campus to sign up for our majors, it was sort of an off the
wall decision.

B.118:  [Laughter].

A.119:  And, uh, I had no earthly, I didn't do well in chemistry in high school and
had no earthly idea that I'd get my degree in chemistry, on the way in.  So,
it's, uh, but I, I think, uh, a person who has some idea, like you did, is,
is, is, well, uh, you know, that, that helps a lot.  Were you well prepared
for Tech in your school?

B.120:  Yes.

A.121:  Did you go to public school in Midland?

B.122:  I had, yeah, I was in public school.  I was in all honors classes.  I was
also a National Merit Scholar --

A.123:  Oh, okay,

B.124:  -- and I had --

A.125:  well, you, you got a lot of things,

B.126:  -- I think the other things that a lot of kids could benefit from in high
school is taking an aptitude test --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- because there are some good ones out there, and I know, in our high
school at least, they offered several different ones where you went through
and, you know, you answer all these questions back and forth, and things, it
ended up being things you liked versus things that you had an aptitude ...
