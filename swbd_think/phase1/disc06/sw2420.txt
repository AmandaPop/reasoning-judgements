===========================================================================

@B.1:  [Laughter] Views, huh?  Political views, huh? [Breathing].

A.2:  Well, just any, any political event or view or anything.

B.3:  Well, I think Bush ((done)) screwed up.

A.4:  Well, uh, in what way?

B.5:  Well, as far as like the, the people over there.  He told them to up-, have
a uprising, you know, and overtake Saddam.  So now that they're listening,
he's not helping them.

A.6:  I don't think he ever told them to, to rise up against Saddam Hussein.

B.7:  Yeah, that's what he said when it first started, that they should think
about what they're doing and, and, you know, what he's doing.  That they
should, you know, make him understand it.  It's just like them saying that we
should understand what Bush is doing, but they don't have no say so in it, I
guess.

A.8:  Well, unfortunately, the, the United States as a government can't get
involved in a civil war in another country because it's not, it's,

B.9:  Well, that's what Vietnam was, was a civil war.  That's what get-, you
know, it's like a double, double standard.

A.10:  Well, 

B.11:  You know.

A.12:  That's, I'm, I, uh, the, uh, the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq,
unfortunately, when the, the, uh, Mid Eastern countries were, when the
boundaries were adjusted and changed and all, the Kurdish were basically
forgotten because there's a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq, there's some
in, uh, Western Iran and there's some in Southern Turkey.

B.13:  Oh, yeah.

A.14:  And, uh, 

B.15:  Well, that's where he bombed before, with the Turks.  That's where he put
the chemical weapons before --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- and killed all them people.  What's, uh, Saddam did.

A.18:  Yeah, it, it's just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn't get their
own, uh,

B.19:  Land or something.

A.20:  Well, their, their own government or their own something,

B.21:  Um.

A.22:  originally.

B.23:  Yeah.  Now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out, more or
less, taken on from each side.  Because they're getting it from, like Turkey
closed their borders --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- you know, so I think they're screwed up there.

A.26:  Yeah, they've, they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem.

B.27:  Uh-huh.  And then Iran, I don't know if they can go to Iran or not.  That
wasn't,

A.28:  The, the Iranian borders are still open.  Uh, from what I under-,

B.29:  David {Talking to someone else in the room}.

A.30:  understand, um, the Iraqis, the Kurdish are going into Ira-, to Iran and
into Syria.  I know that the S-, the, uh, that Saudi Arabia has some pretty
strict,

B.31:  Yeah.

A.32:  uh,

B.33:  Now they have, yeah, they're pretty strict anyway [laughter].

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  [Laughter].

A.36:  And I doubt that they're letting too many Iraqis in --

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  -- unless the people have proof that they're leaving --

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  -- that they're not going to stay.

B.41:  I don't even think that will help right now because you never know who's on
whose side and they're worried about that, and they could get over there and
change their mind or something, you know.  Who knows.

A.42:  Then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them.

B.43:  Yeah.  Now that's something I like about the country.  There's not a whole
lot of crime over there, as far as petty crime, you know, ((they)),

A.44:  Well, they, it's a, it's, all the countries over there are very wealthy.

B.45:  Yeah.

A.46:  And so most of the people are wealthy and, and they don't have some, most
of their basic needs for, for food and shelter and clothing are met, so they
don't have any --

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  -- uh, any need that's going to drive them to, to petty theft or, or to
that type of crime.

B.49:  I wish it was as good over here as it is over there, but these people,

A.50:  Yeah, but those, uh, those countries are so extremely wealthy, but from
what I understand, though, that it's pri-, it's the same type of wealth
distribution where you have a, the very few are very wealthy.

B.51:  Yeah.

A.52:  But since there's so much more to go around, that, that leaves the, the
lower classes with more.

B.53:  Yeah.  That's better than none at all, I guess.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  They don't have no crime.  Then,

A.56:  So you think that, that George Bush's foreign policy is poor because of,
because of what's happening to the Kurdish people?

B.57:  No, I just think, I don't know if he should have made that statement.
Other than that, you know, he's all right, you know, but, I don't know.  I'm
not a Bush fan.  I'm not really none of them's fan.  I just wish something
else could be done in this country.  I don't know what.

A.58:  Something else done here that would, would solve the problems in the Mid
East or, or,

B.59:  No, that would solve our own problems.  I don't know, I think the war was
good to a point, but then it really didn't help us any, you know.

A.60:  No, other than, than reestablishing the dominance of the United States,

B.61:  Yeah, that's it, that's all,

A.62:  in the, in the world e-,  

B.63:  that's, that, the, to let the world know that we could do what we say we
was going to.  That's about it.

A.64:  Another thing that was good, if you're looking at the balance of the super
powers between the United States and the Soviet Union, you know, the United
States went in and led the battle and, and solved the problem, and the Soviet
Union is, is a whimpering, is a whimpering country right now because they,
they've got so many problems that they can't even,

B.65:  Now, they, now they have an internal problem themselves right now.

A.66:  Yeah, yeah.

B.67:  And I think that has to do with them having problems with food and, and,
and, and prices and all of that stuff.

A.68:  A lot of their, their civil problems where they've got their, uh, Baltic
states rising against the, the, uh, the leadership in,

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  in the Russian state, uh, is the same type of deal as what occurred with
the Kurdish people.  It's the same type of situation where --

B.71:  They, they want their own, their,

A.72:  -- where, where ethnic groups were split up and, and our, and don't
necessarily have the same, uh, social structure or value systems as the
government.

B.73:  Yeah [breathing].

A.74:  It's, I, it's, it's kind of fortunate that, that the United States was
founded in the way that it did because it's such a mixture of people,

B.75:  Oh, goodness, yes.

A.76:  with, with, for the most part, with the same ideals.

B.77:  Yeah, more or less.  Just whatever it, it's really that choice,

A.78:  Yeah, ((and, and)), 

B.79:  that's the biggest, that's the bottom line, is it's your choice.

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  It's not told to you or pushed on you.  It's whatever choice you want to
make, you can make it yourself.

A.82:  And, and when the, when the United States was founded, the people, the
people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and
so immigrants coming in understood that and, and it wasn't as if it was forced
upon them.  They chose to come to this country.

B.83:  Yeah.

A.84:  It wasn't as if a, a new government was established when they were already
here.

B.85:  Uh-huh.

@@A.86:  So, well, I think we've taken up at least five minutes.

B.87:  [Laughter].

A.88:  I've enjoyed talking to you.

B.89:  All rightie.

A.90:  Bye.

B.91:  Bye-bye.
