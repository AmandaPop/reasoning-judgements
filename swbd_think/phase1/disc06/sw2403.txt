============================================================================

A.1:  There, so we're discussing U S involvement in the Middle East.  That's a
tough one now isn't it?

@B.2:  Well, it is, it is, but, uh, in a way, and in a way it isn't.  Uh, our
involvement is kind of over, I hope, [laughter] although, um, from the news,
as I get it, they're trying to get us back involved again beca-,

A.3:  But should we be the world police?

B.4:  Well, I, 

A.5:  I, I, that's my question to myself.  I don't know.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Would that be smart on our part?

B.8:  Well, {pause} uh, what we've, what we did in the war I was behind
completely.  But getting into the countries' civil wars, no.  I don't think
that we should have to take that responsibility.  Um, I think that they should
be totally, uh, able to handle it themselves.  I mean, if we went and policed,
just like you say, every country when they had squabbles,

A.9:  Well, but we've done it before,

B.10:  Oh, I know we have.

A.11:  and it has not been successful.

B.12:  Well, that's true, and we've done it before because of, I think, more that
we are afraid Russia was going to get in on it, and there was going to be a
battle for, you know.  But, uh, now,

A.13:  Those poor souls aren't going to get in, to anything but food lines at this
point.

B.14:  Well, that's for sure.  It's hard to realize, that there are places that
are just so, uh, bare on the shelves as there.  I saw that on the news last
night, too.  But, uh, but now, I, I think that our involvement in the Middle
East should be, I think that now, instead of coming to the U S for help in
their civil wars and things, they should go to the U N, and if they need help,
it should be handled through the U N and not the United States.

A.15:  And use the U N as it was set up to be.

B.16:  That's correct.  Too many times we get our fingers in the pie, and the U N
isn't even brought into it.  And, uh, I hate seeing our boys put on the line,
so to speak.

A.17:  Our people, now.

B.18:  Yeah and, uh, us paying for it.  Uh-huh.

A.19:  They had an interview with, uh, I'm going to mispronounce his name, I know.
Schm-, I can't pronounce his name.  I give up.  The general.  Stormin Norman
[laughter].

B.20:  Yes, oh, I know who you mean [laughter].

A.21:  And at the end of it, it must have been SIXTY MINUTES or something like
that, no DAVID FROST, that's what it was.  Anyway, at the end of it, they
rolled all of the U S names of the U S casualties --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and there were two women there.

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  So it's not our men anymore.

B.26:  Oh yes,

A.27:  It's, it's our people.

B.28:  Well, that's true.  Uh, there, one woman was killed when they hit that
quonset hut, and I do-, I'm not sure where the other one was.  But that is
true.

A.29:  My husband thought both of them were the quonset hut.

B.30:  Oh, they were. Oh, okay.

A.31:  He thought so.

B.32:  I wasn't sure where the second one was. But, uh, yeah, well that's true,
there were several women involved directly in this war where they weren't
before.  But I think, uh, that, I really think that we should let the U N take
care of these things --

A.33:  Well.

B.34:  -- instead of us being responsible because, you know, you hear all this
about government spending and about the budget and (( )) and all this other,
and, uh, then we go off chasing these, you know, what, giving people tanks,
and equipment and, uh,

A.35:  Well, I mean, I think it's horrible what they did to the (( )), and I think
gassing a whole village of women and children and all this sort of thing,
that's even before this latest event.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  It's horrible.

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  And I think what he's doing to them is horrible.  What did he do, he did
some atrocity the other day.  He dropped something on them.  Um, {pause} it
wasn't chemicals.  What was it?  {Pause}.  It, it was dread-, I can't even
remember what it was now.  It was something melted.  But it was just 
dreadful --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- you know. And I, I'm, I'm horrified, but I don't think every time there
is an atrocity committed --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- in the world we should run over there --

B.44:  Yes, I agree.

A.45:  -- and monitor it.  We can't afford to.

B.46:  No, like I said.  That should be the job of the U N, not the United States
[laughter].

A.47:  And we're not smart enough to know who's right and wrong either.  Maybe,
you know, there's no telling what the (( )) did at some point in time.  You
know, we're not smart enough to be objective with all these situations and
say, okay, these are the ones, this is the side we should be on.

B.48:  Right.  That's right.  Well besides, uh, they, they, what the countries
need is guidance and how to handle their civil wars and their, uh, their
disturbances, their borders, their, you know, their struggles.  Uh, they don't
need somebody else coming in and saying, you know, okay we're going to be with
them and we're going to zap it to you.  Uh, they need to learn how to handle
it themselves.  We could go on and on forever helping them, these other
countries try to handle their disputes.  Uh,

A.49:  And we have so many internal problems.

B.50:  I know. I'd like to see them,

A.51:  That are not, they are growing.  We are twenty-fourth in the world for
{pause} malnour-, oh, no infant --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- infant mortality.  That's what it is.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And I mean, the countries ahead of, ahead of us that the babies live longer
and are more healthy are rather embarrassing.  I mean there are some countries
in there that we have no business being behind.

B.56:  Yes.  Right.

A.57:  Our technology is there.

B.58:  I know.  It's just that, uh, the people just do without, you know, the poor
people kind of get, in fact, all of the cutting of, you know, back of the
budget and everything now, there's plenty of money to go and help these
countries out and give them all this equipment and everything, but there's not
enough money to feed, you know, people, uh, in a lot of areas in the United
States.

A.59:  And, and I've found,

B.60:  And they're cutting back on programs for the handicapped and programs for
the, uh, aged, and, you know, things like this, that, uh,

A.61:  And I think we're breeding another disease, this, {pause} I think, I think
we have a social disease called poverty.  I think people get into the syndrome
of poverty.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And they don't know how to get back out again.

B.64:  Uh, yes.

A.65:  They're following what their parents did and their parents did.

B.66:  Right.  Well, that and we make it so easy for them to stay there with
welfare that they can get by just signing some papers and, you know, and not
having to work for it or anything, you know.  If people are used to working
for, uh,

A.67:  But the money they get is just, I mean, it's borderline survival.

B.68:  Oh, I know, I know.

A.69:  I couldn't live on two hundred and thirty dollars a month.

B.70:  Yep, I know.

A.71:  I can't go to the grocery store twice for that kind of money.

B.72:  That's right, not anymore.  So, uh, 

A.73:  I can't, with my family, and I have a small family.

B.74:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.75:  So, you know, I, granted, they can do that very easily, it's easy to do,
but look where it puts them.

B.76:  Well, that's right.

A.77:  It puts them in a trap.

B.78:  Yep, it does.  It's like a catch twenty two.  Yeah and, uh, some of them,
you know, are not trained, so they can't, they haven't learned, they couldn't
make as much money out on their own.  So, uh, and then jobs are harder to get,
too.  People cutting back while the government cutting back a lot of [cough]
{sounds like a man} contracts and stuff like that.  Uh, so it's just kind of a
snowball effect, you know.  Uh.

A.79:  And hopefully, things are more merciful where you are.  But we actually had
some ho-, uh, street people picked up last week in Dallas for picking up tin
cans.

B.80:  My gracious.

A.81:  For picking up tin cans.  They were going to turn them in, they were going
to cash them in.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  And they picked them up, what for?

A.83:  Disturbing the trash, or something like that.

B.84:  My gosh.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, dear.  Well in our area right now,

A.85:  It just blew my mind.

B.86:  Yes, I guess so.

A.87:  Wait a minute.

B.88:  Yeah, that is a little, uh, going a little bit too far.

A.89:  Well Dallas politics are rather strange, you know.

B.90:  Um, yeah.

A.91:  Anywhere they're stran-, down here they're strange.  I can imagine from an
outsider's point of view.

B.92:  [Laughter] Yeah, well.  We've, the county that I live in now has gotten
into recycling.  So,

A.93:  Oh, we are too.

B.94:  we recycle everything.  And, um, so there really isn't much for them to
get, but that is kind of sad that when, when the focus is more on the other
countries than our own.  So, I mean, some of the social problems and the
poverty problems,

A.95:  I think we should promise to solve all of our problems and then we can work
on somebody else's.

B.96:  Right.  Right.  Or like I say, to just have the U N take care of it.  It
should, it should be their baby, not ours.  We shouldn't have to get into it
at all, unless, except for the peo-, our people that are on the United Nations
as advisors, then I think that would be appropriate.  But, uh, for us just 
to,

A.97:  Well, they may have come into their own, because for so many years they
were just a lame duck organization --

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  -- that really didn't have anything.  And maybe they have at last achieved
the status or the need for a --

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  -- organization such as --

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  -- that, that they will achieve the status they should have had all along.

B.104:  I hope that, uh, they will start picking up on some of these things and,
and getting involved, because that's the only way that we're going to get out
of it.  And, that jus-,

A.105:  Well, the other way is to say no.

B.106:  Well, yes I know.

A.107:  And to refer to the U-, and to just say I'm sorry, we're not.  Yes, yes
it's sad your losing people, but why should we lose people because you, you
know.

B.108:  Right, well that's it.

A.109:  That's not the answer though.  The answer is, yes you're losing people and
we're sorry, but we're not the people to make these decisions.

B.110:  Right.  But you should go to, uh, somebody that can be, you know, that is
not representative of one country.

A.111:  A, a world council.

B.112:  Yes, right, right.

A.113:  Well now that we've solved the problems of the world.

B.114:  [Laughter].

A.115:  That was easy.

B.116:  Yeah, but I wish we could get someone to listen, though.  You know?

A.117:  Well, I think people agree.  I think it's just getting it implemented.

B.118:  Yes.

A.119:  Uh, that's a very costly thing, and it's turning lose of power.

B.120:  Yes, yes, that, I think is one of the biggies, uh,
