REMARKS:        Both speakers spoke very loudly, causing some distortion noise.

============================================================================

A.1:  Well, I don't know, but, uh, I'm twenty-two years old and I think it would
be, uh, it's not a good choice to do that.  I mean, you have, uh, everything
here, you know, like, uh, the Army and everything else is al-, all voluntary.

B.2:  #Right.#

A.3: #And that's# the way you're going to dedicate yourself to, to that,
you know, to your job, if it's voluntary.  I mean, if you don't like
it, I mean, if you're, like in other places where they have a, you
know, mandatory, you know, services, yeah [Breathing and static],

B.4:  Sort of like the draft.  Do you know, in the Army, you're not going to,
uh, uh, be, I, I, I understand what you're saying.  I'm, I'm twenty-four and,
uh, you know, I'm, I don't think that I would be willing to, to dedicate, you
know, a year or two years of my life --

A.5:  Because, I mean --

B.6:  -- to a,

A.7:  -- the thing is is that whenever you, I mean, you seen like, for example,
you know, like the war just that went on.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  You saw, you saw that some people were not going.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  You know, people that, that had all the benefits that were sitting around
for years, you know, maybe three, four years getting paid, uh, by the
government or, you know,

B.12:  #Exactly.#

A.13:  #because when,# when the time came, they said no way.

B.14:  #Right.#

A.15: #You know,# when they, when that was their job, they joined it
because they wanted to or well, you know, some people didn't, didn't
have the, you know, the money.  They said it's a good way of, uh,
coming in.  But those are public service.  I mean, you, I mean, you
would be getting paid very little,

B.16:  #Right.#

A.17:  #you know,# or anything at all.  And, um, you would just hate it so much
that whatever you had to do would be just, you know, it's like, you know,

B.18:  You just do the minimum,

A.19:  Yeah, I mean,

B.20:  yeah.

A.21:  you wouldn't, you wouldn't do it.  I mean --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- the, the thing would be that it would throw you, you know, totally the
wrong way.  You would be there because you had to be there,

B.24:  #Exactly.#

A.25:  #but yet you# would still respond to everything in a very, you know,
negative way.  You know, it's like,

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  do this, why?

B.28:  Right, right.

A.29:  You know, I, I have a, I, I don't have to do anything.  You know it's like,
what am I going to do,

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  if I sit here, if I stay here for a whole year they'll let me go and then
I can get back to my life.

B.32:  Exactly.  You know, I, and I'm sure there is a problem about, uh, getting,
you know, the volunteers to do that.  And maybe they could, uh, spend a little
bit more money on promotion and,

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  and, uh, advertise it a little bit more, uh, so that the public is a
little more aware of it.  But, uh, I definitely agree with you.  I would hate
to, uh, to see that become mandatory.

A.35:  Well, the-, I don't think there's any way it can, you know, like they say
this proposal would any-, would get anywhere because of the, I mean, first of
all, I've never heard of it until this, this phone call, you know.

B.36:  Right [laughter].

A.37:  And, uh, if it is actually proposed and taken, you know, to the government
or something,

B.38:  That would be political suicide --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- for anybody to, I would think.

A.41:  To, to actually support it,

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  you know, it would be just like saying that, you know, what, what are
you, crazy?  I mean, ther-, --

B.44:  Right [laughter].

A.45:  -- I mean, I mean, you know, we had enough of the abortion issue that's
still going around,

B.46:  Exactly.

A.47:  that you guys want to bring, you know, the next, you know,

B.48:  Next big issue up, yeah,

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  yeah, because I think, uh [throat_clearing] young and old alike, uh,
would, would more or less agree on this issue.  Uh, maybe certain religions,
uh, you know, I think it's, is it the Mormons or somebody.  I know at Brigham
Young University they have to do like a mandatory, um, year or two years worth
of, sort of service, but, uh, #whatever that religion is.#

A.51:  #But see, but you're going there# and you know what you're getting into.

B.52:  That's right, and that is a, that is a definite choice.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  Uh, and, and I, I believe it's just that religion.  That's not a, you know,
a prominent, uh, predominant re-, uh, religion.  So I know, I don't think
that, that issue would hold much water,

A.55:  Yeah, but it's,

B.56:  in a political,

A.57:  it's not like saying, like I'm born and then when I reached a certain age
I'm going to have to do something, you know.

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  It's, uh, it's not by choice.  It's like every-, everything else, you know,
it's like, if I want to do it, I'll do it, but, you know, it's like, you know,
and, um, yeah, I have a background, I'm from Argentina.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  And, uh, everybody, everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military
service.

B.62:  I see.

A.63:  And, but you go into this whole big lottery every year and, you know, each,
uh, your last three digits of your document, you know, like your Social
Security number, you're matched up with other numbers, right?

B.64:  Oh, I see.

A.65:  From, from, uh, one to a thousand.

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  And so if your number is below four hundred, you're not going to have to do
it.  Say,

B.68:  I see.

A.69:  it's between four hundred and six hundred, you might have to do it,
depending how many people are in your class, and, you know, and like you, the,
they,

B.70:  Your age group or whatever?

A.71:  right.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  And if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it.

B.74:  Oh, Lord.

A.75:  And I got one thirty-one.  And so,

B.76:  Oh, okay, so you felt pretty good, then, huh?

A.77:  yeah, I didn't have to do it, but the thing was that you have, you know,
the whole, the whole nation's watching, you know, like,

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  if it's your class, everybody that's your same age is l-, listening to
the radio waiting for them to announce the number, you know,

B.80:  Golly.

A.81:  and it's like, and then, you know, you have people, you know, going, you
know, it's like everywhere, you know, you have some people that are glad, some
people that are saying shit, and the other people that are going, oh, my God,
I'm somewhere in the middle,

B.82:  Right, yeah.

A.83:  you know, it's like, wow, #am I going to have to do it?#

B.84:  #Right there on the borderline,# huh?

A.85:  Yeah.  And you know, but it's (( )), my brother goes, everybody in my
family had to do it, and they go, you know, it's just a year and a half of
your life that's, that's totally wasted.  You don't do anything else.  There's
no time, and you don't do anything.

B.86:  Jeez.

A.87:  You know?  You go there, you train, you get treated like shit and then you,
you, I mean then you get out.

B.88:  So it's, it's no, is it not educational training?  It's st-, it's strictly,
uh, military?

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  I see.

A.91:  And so, I mean, but, you know, it's like the thing is is that, you know,
you just get treated, I mean, one, one of the guys that was doing it was, uh,
like, uh, a waiter at one of the restaurants that, you know, like the military
had.

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  And that was his job,

B.94:  God.

A.95:  you know, he got, he got, you know, like three months of, uh, you know,
physical training,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  and then he got to serve all these people.

B.98:  [Laughter].

A.99:  You know, but that's what they do.  I mean, that's a year and a half of
your life that's, that you don't do anything,

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  that you have to be there, you know, maybe five times, you know, five
times a week and that, you know, you have I guess a round-robin schedule or
something.

B.102:  Jeez.

A.103:  And, uh,

B.104:  And I guess a minimal pay or,

A.105:  No, oh, there, I don't,

B.106:  #Do you they get paid very we-,#

A.107:  #I don't think there# is any pay.  Wait, I'm not sure because what happens
is you, you get to, like to ride buses for free.

B.108:  Oh, #you get a, little benefits?#

A.109:  #Well, you do, I guess# you do get paid, but the thing is is that, you
know, people are, what, if they see you in the uniform.

B.110:  Oh, they know,

A.111:  Right.  Like, for example, you know, like when they go around the train
asking you for tickets, like short distant trains --

B.112:  Right.

A.113:  -- they won't ask you, if you, if you're wearing your military uniform for
a ticket.  They'll just skip you.

B.114:  I see, #I see.#

A.115:  #And, uh,# you know, it's like they, they consider that, but it would be
the same way here, you know.

B.116:  Right.

A.117:  It's like if, if you had to do it, you know, you have a big sign, I'm
sorry, I don't get paid, you know?

B.118:  Right [laughter].

A.119:  ((It's like)) please let me ride for free.

B.120:  [Laughter].

A.121:  You know, it's like, I'm, I'm living off Dad for these wonderful two years
which I have to do.

B.122:  [Laughter].

A.123:  You know, it's like,

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  And then the other thing is when I get out of college at twenty-eight with
my B S, you know, it's like, by the time,

B.126:  Well, yeah, yeah, you're thirty years old,

A.127:  Yeah.

B.128:  and trying to get your first job, yeah.

A.129:  And so that would be, that would be, see, there are too many things that go
against it that would be ridiculous.

B.130:  Right, right.

A.131:  So, oh, well, it's been,

B.132:  Well,

A.133:  seven minutes.

B.134:  That sounds good.

A.135:  I don't, I, well, I don't, I don't think they'll ever pass this.  I, I, I'm
just going to laugh if I ever see it in the newspapers.  I, I mean, I don't
read the newspaper that much, but I never heard anything about it, so,

B.136:  Well, I'm, I haven't either.

A.137:  So.

B.138:  And so, uh, yeah, I, I won't think much will come up of it.

A.139:  And, but then you won't have to do it. 

B.140:  That's right [laughter].

A.141:  Just imagine sometimes your kids, you'll be saying, well, it's your job, go
do it, you know [laughter].

B.142:  That's right [laughter].  It's easier after you, you don't have to worry
about it.

A.143:  Yeah, really.  Then you'll have to say, ((see in my age)), I didn't have to
do it [laughter].

B.144:  That's right, that's right.

A.145:  (( )) yeah,

B.146:  [Laughter].

A.147:  Oh, well, okay.

B.148:  Well, hey, I appreciate the call.

A.149:  Yeah, bye-bye.

B.150:  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.
