REMARKS:        There were a lot of faint replies.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Probably, uh, the life-styles and the size of the area we live in, and an
age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used.  Um, at this
point in life, I do not carry a credit card that I have to pay a service
charge on.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  None at all, huh? 

A.3:  Right.  Uh, we used to have American Express, and, uh, Visa that, of
course, there's a yearly fee on.

B.4:  I see, yeah, has it,

A.5:  And we got rid of those, we now have Discover, we have a Visa that does not
have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a
promotion,

B.6:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.7:  this year, that out of the first year there is no yearly fee,

B.8:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.9:  and, of course, we don't plan on keeping it the second year,

B.10:  Yeah that,

A.11:  because I'm pretty frugal about things like that. 

B.12:  That's what we, we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason,
(( )) though we have a, a credit union and we get our cards, our other
MasterCards for free.  So, we don't have to pay a, a fee at all.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  And, that's, I, I know people who don't have any credit cards at all and
I'm always amazed [laughter], because I don't know how they can get by
without them, it doesn't seem like you can do anything anymore without a
credit card.

A.15:  We find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and
we travel quite a bit and we, we like to leave a credit card when we check
into a motel.

B.16:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.17:  In case we want to make a phone call or whatever, 

B.18:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.19:  which we do pretty often and, and, uh, fact, in a lot of motels we noticed
from our most recent trip, they, that you do not even get the telephone turned
on in your room unless you've left a credit card at the desk.

B.20:  Uh-huh {very faint}. 

A.21:  So, I suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some
kind but,

B.22:  Yeah, I like, um, too, with, with us, we've got insurance ((of course)) but
(( )) husband's work, but by the time, like, two weeks ago we all got sick,
all four us, and one ((kid had to)) go to the doctor twice and then all, the
other, the rest of us did, and he was like six hundred dollars.

A.23:  Oh, my. 

B.24:  Yeah, and it was, we were, we all had, it was a viral pneumonia, it was
really bad, and,

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:  and we were just horribly sick but, I mean, six hundred dollars, I can't
come up with but, um,

A.27:  Can you do that on a credit card? 

B.28:  Yeah, all the doctors here will take a Visa, so,

A.29:  Oh, for heaven sakes.  

B.30:  that and, you know, (( )) go to K-Mart and use the pharmacy to pay for the,
uh,

A.31:  For the drugs, yeah.  

B.32:  medicines.  And then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it
to come back,

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  you know, and, so, our part of it was still twenty percent, but twenty
percent I can payoff in one month,

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  or as, you know, (( )) then I got to wait for the re-, the rest of it to
come back from Aetna but it basically floats, you know, during the, the time
because we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card,

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  as long as you pay it, you know, within that time, and that's usually
enough time for the insurance to get back.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  I try to make that our biggest use of credit cards, I know people who are
so in debt.

A.41:  Uh, yes. 

B.42:  People who have five Visa cards, I can't belie-,

A.43:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.44:  you know, it's like, why did you go get, they charged up one so then, they,
but they were still paying their minimum,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  so their credit rating was still good,

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  and, and you would, you know, they get this in the mail, say oh, well, we
can't use that one anymore we'll just get another one, ((and that's like)) who
you,

A.49:  [Laughter] I have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesn't know
she has,

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  now, uh, she must rent a p-, post office box or something or, I mean, she
couldn't beat him to the mail every month I wouldn't think,

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  because they both work and they, uh, he's a fireman, so, he's home two days
a week that she teaches,

B.54:   Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.55:  and would not be there, so, I don't know how she manages it, but she
((keeps)) that a secret and I would not want to pay her monthly interest rate
on the thing,

B.56:  Oh, yeah {very faint}.

A.57:  it just has to be awful because it,

B.58:   But that's, that's a good way to make a big problem in your
marriage, 

A.59:   Oh, I would,

B.60:  real quick. ((Gosh, that's just dishonest)).

A.61:  think so, they've been married almost thirty-five years so,

B.62:  Oh well [laughter].

A.63:  I think they've done things [laughter], like that to each other for a long
time.

B.64:  Maybe, maybe they'll be all right [laughter].  I know in mine, if I did
something like that and then my husband found out, jeez, he would just be,
well, (( )) I think I would feel the same way I'd,

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  I'd really feel like I'd been deceived,

A.67:  Yes, yes.  

B.68:  you know, that, that wasn't the thing to do.

A.69:  Well, many, many, many, many, years ago, uh, I bought wallpaper, we have a
large kitchen, uh, dining, kitchen family room combination and I wanted to
paper it, and I bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card, and at
that time I was only able to pay about ten dollars a month, an-, which meant I
was taking about eight dollars a month off the balance,

B.70:  Uh-huh {very faint}. 

A.71:  by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it
off, and at that point I promised myself I would never pay interest on a
credit card again,

B.72:  Um {very faint}.

A.73:  so, that's kind of been my (( )). 

B.74:  Yeah, we've tried to do that, we've paid ours off, you know, all the way
down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before I, I
quit work two years ago, to stay home with the kids and right, and before I
left we had everything paid off, we were in great shape, we were putting
money, you know, because we were both working,

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  we were finally putting money in, but we've gone back the other way to some
extent because, just because, there are times when you just can't pay it all,

A.77:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.78:  because there are just too many bills. 

A.79:  Well, as you say, when you're taking children to the doctor,

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  and adults, too, it does make a difference.  Our children are matured out
of the home and our needs are much different than they were,

B.82:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

A.83:  uh, when we were raising a family.  I think back then we just, now, we feel
like we might could live without one, but, uh, we have a Discover card and I
have to laugh about the cash back.  Do you,

B.84:  Oh, isn't that silly?  

A.85:  have one of those?  [laughter]. 

B.86:  I, I sent that one back, 

A.87:  Did you?  

B.88:  because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth
during the year and what we un-, and I think we got back fifty cents or
something,

A.89:  Yeah [laughter], yeah.  

B.90:  it was like please what is this, this is, and the interest rate on it was,
was eighteen or nineteen percent,

A.91:  Oh. 

B.92:  and our Visa card was, we could get through our credit union was like
fourteen,

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  percent, so we just, we sent it back, we, we keep gas credit cards and we
have Visa and then I have started my own business, I have a photography
business.  And I went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography
business,

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  because there are things that I have to buy, and, and with my photog-, when
I, when I take things to the lab,

A.97:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.98:  to get developed, it's several hundred dollars at a time, and I was using
up all of our personal credit with my photography business,

A.99:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.100:  even though again it's paying off every month because I'm, I'm putting
everything, I'm, I'm, uh, you know, I'm getting the pictures and I'm taking
them back so the people already have their money,

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  but I wasn't depositing them until I gave them the pictures back.

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  Another practice I found I'm going to have to stop,

A.105:  Oh.

B.106:  hot checks.

A.107:  Oh, I see.  Oh, dear.  Well,

B.108:  You wouldn't think for a, for a, twelve dollar school picture,

A.109:  Uh-huh. 

B.110:  that, uh, that people would write a hot check but they do.

A.111:  I think those are the same people who have their credit cards, uh, charged
up to the max and,

B.112:  I guess.  

A.113:  that's just a way of life, I guess. 

B.114:  It's just, you know, and when I think about that lad-, this, this
particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced,

A.115:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.116:  and I sent it through, you know, sent it through the check, through the
bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee,

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  for a returned check,

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  so, now, she's already doubled the price of her check and I've sent it
through a second time because they said there's money in the account now.

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  You know, and, and if it doesn't go through the second time, that woman's
out thirty bucks.

A.123:  For one twelve dollar check. 

B.124:  For one twelve dollar check. 

A.125:  It's never quite made sense to me, but then, uh, when my husband was in
business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because
he spent more than he made every month.  And, he was perfectly serious about
it.

B.126:  Gosh.

A.127:  So, I don't know why he, you know, didn't go ahead and project to the fact
that eventually that,

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  was going to catch up with him but,

B.130:  He's going to have a debt ((going out the)),

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  ((year)).

A.133:  I was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing.
[laughter], so, we've, we have a little problem with our gas card, we're, uh,
we've always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil,

B.134:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

A.135:  and, uh, we, it's very difficult to find their stations, so, I guess that's
one reason why we use,

B.136:  Uh, uh-huh {very faint}.

A.137:  uh, we've used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fueling. 

B.138:  Well, we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and I used to use that
card almost exclusively.  But now they're charging the extra five cents to use
your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else, is not anymore,
they'll take it, you know, at the cash price, or you, they'll now let you
write a check if you have their card,

A.139:  Uh-huh.  

B.140:  so, you pay for it immediately instead of, um, you know, putting it off for
a month.

A.141:  I thought that was illegal? 

B.142:  What's that, writing a check for gas? 

A.143:  No, no, no, to, uh, put a surcharge on a credit card of,

B.144:  Well, all of them down, down here you had a cash price for gasoline,

A.145:  Oh.  

B.146:  and a credit card price. 

A.147:  So, what they're doing, they're discounting for cash is the way they're,

B.148:  Right, that's, that's the (( )),

A.149:  because I think it is illegal to add a surcharge, so, that's, that, they're
looking at it differently.

B.150:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.151:  It amounts to, that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but,

B.152:  Right and, and they've changed that now. {Talking to someone in the
background}. Now stop it, go play and leave me alone [laughter].  Yeah, and,
so, I'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and
then they're,

A.153:  Yeah, uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.154:  nickel a gallon cheaper so,

A.155:  So, what we're saying is, that we use a credit card when it, uh, is
convenient, but if,

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  it's going to cost us money, we don't ((though)) [laughter].

B.158:  We try not to [laughter], we're probably the only two people in the United
States.

A.159:  Probably [laughter].  

B.160:  (( )) the banks don't want to hear from us because they want those people
who charge it up to ten thousand dollars,

A.161:  And leave us [laughter].  

B.162:  and, and then get all, yeah, and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all
goes to interest.

A.163:  Uh-huh.  

B.164:  Oh, I guess they must, they must make a ton, (( )) there's not too many
places you can make eighteen percent interest,

A.165:  That's right, that's right.  

B.166:  on things anymore.  That's what we need, see you and I need to get in the
credit card business.

A.167:  I guess so [laughter]. 

B.168:  We need to start our own credit card. 

A.169:  That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?  [laughter]. 

B.170:  [Laughter] If you can, yeah, because you sure can't get that interest
anyway else.

A.171:  Huh-uh, huh-uh.  Not on those C D's we're trying to live on.

B.172:  Oh, yeah, ours are like seven percent,

A.173:  Uh, yeah.  

B.174:  we've got one.  And with, with, I R A stuff in it,

A.175:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.176:  and, uh, jeez, you can't get any interest ((rates)).

A.177:  Yeah. 

B.178:  My folks have just retired, just in the last couple of months,

A.179:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.180:  my Dad has and, uh, they're trying to figure out, you know, what they're
doing with stuff and my Mom's in there cutting up the credit cards,

A.181:  Sure, sure.  

B.182:  ((you know)), can't use these anymore [laughter]. 

A.183:  Yeah, well, like I say, the only reason we do, in fact, I, when my
husband and I were tr-,
