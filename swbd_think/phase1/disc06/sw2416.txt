A.1:  Oh,

B.2:  Well my,

A.3:  so wha-, what's your favorite exercise?

B.4:  I guess, uh, sports.  Uh, I'm, don't play as much sports as I used to
because I'm, I'm too old for it now.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  But, uh, I still play golf.  I like to bowl, although I hadn't bowled in
quite a while.  But I guess my main exercise right now is probably golf.

A.7:  Oh, that's pretty good exercise.  Do you drive a cart or do you carry your
bag?

B.8:  Uh, this last tournament I was in I walked nine holes and almost dropped
so,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  I shared a cart.

A.11:  Yeah, it gets a long ways after a while.

B.12:  Yeah, especially on a real hilly course.

A.13:  Yeah.  Oh, let's see, I, I play racquetball mostly.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Um, I don't play very much anymore because I've fractured my right ankle
twice.

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  And, uh, fractured it on both sides and so it's kind of weak.  I'm afraid
to get out there and try it again.  Uh,

B.18:  Yep, they have a real nice, uh, health club there at T I Lewisville,
racquetball courts and hand ball courts, and it's a real nice facility.  I
just haven't taken,

A.19:  Do --

B.20:  advantage of it yet so,

A.21:  -- do they give the employees time off during the day to go?

B.22:  No, not really.

A.23:  A lot of places do that now.  They'll, they'll set aside --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- you know, like an hour a day that you can go exercise.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  That's a pretty good idea because,

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on
health care.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  Um, yeah, I like bowling, too.  I haven't been for a while, just don't have
the time.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  But, uh, I guess bowling and racquetball's about it for me.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  Walking every once in a while but not a great deal of that.

B.36:  Yeah.  I've, I, wish they'd split that bowling season up into, uh, three
seasons.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Right now they have a real short season and a real long season.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  The summer league is just too long.

A.41:  Yeah.  Well, that's my, uh, I mean every time I've tried to go, you know,
it's always, th-, there's always a league bowling.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah.

A.43:  And it, it's just so, you either have to wait or --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- you're next to, to league bowlers, and after a while it just gets to be
a pain.

B.46:  Yeah, yeah, there's, there's hardly no open alleys anymore.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  It's all, all taken up.

A.49:  Yeah, especially here in Raleigh, we've got such little bitty bowling
alleys.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  ((Got)) little bitty everything here.

B.52:  But, uh, also T I has some good, uh, uh, some good jogging tracks.  Every
once in a while, while I'm sitting there eating lunch, I'll lo-, look out and
see people jogging, I guess on their lunch hour.

A.53:  Yeah, um, a friend of mine works at, uh, I B M in Charlotte.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of
land.  And it's a huge plant.  I mean, this thing's just enormous.  And that's
what they do at lunch time.  They go out and run around the building.

B.56:  Uh.

A.57:  I'm not, I was never into jogging. I hated that when I was in high school playing football.  The coach was
always making us run.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  Yeah, I just sort of hated it from that point on.  Well,

B.60:  Well, I guess, I would love to play basketball, but, but I, I don't think
I'd have the wind for that.  I guess of all the sports that probably gives you
more exercise than any, any sport there is.

A.61:  Yeah.  It's, that's a tough one to play.  I --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- I used to play it when I was younger, but took it out of me then and I'd
hate to think what it would do to me now.

B.64:  Yeah, but, uh,  

A.65:  Yeah, I got to stick to more sedate sports [laughter].

B.66:  Yeah [laughter], yeah.

A.67:  [Talking] as soon as I, as soon as I can find me an ankle, a good, uh, a
good ankle brace I'm going to start playing some racquetball again, but --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- I'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  I'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time.

B.72:  [Laughter] Huh.

A.73:  And I'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  You know, the things got to get fractured so,

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  that it never heals properly.

B.78:  You might have to go to those old, old, old-timey high top tennis shoes
that they used to wear.

A.79:  Well, I've got a pair of those.

B.80:  ((You have))?

A.81:  Uh, that's, those are the ones that I wear when I go out there.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Um, trouble is I can't get them tight enough --

B.84:  Tight enough to really support your ankle?

A.85:  -- to, to really give me what I feel is support.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Um, so I'm, I, I, I think probably just an ace bandage would work.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  But I want to get one of those, um, padded ankle --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- what you call its.

B.92:  Only bad thing about an ace bandage, if you wrap it tight enough so that
really supports your ankle,

A.93:  Yeah, it's going to cut off the circulation, yeah.

B.94:  it's going cut off the blood.

A.95:  Yeah, I, I think I tried that one time a couple years ago, and it did the
same, did that same thing.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  You end up loosening it up, and then of course you don't have any
[breathing].

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Yeah, I think I'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces
or something.

B.100:  Yeah, but, um,

A.101:  Well, I guess that's about it for exercise.

B.102:  That's about it as far as exercise [laughter] (( )).

A.103:  Us old guys just don't do it very much, do we [laughter]?

B.104:  [Laughter] No, unless, unless you call pushing yourself away from the
table exercise.

A.105:  Well, that's, that's good exercise, and I don't do enough of that either.

B.106:  [Laughter].

A.107:  I sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight.  I,

B.108:  Yeah.  Well, I was cooking me a grilled cheese.

A.109:  Um, I like grilled cheese, too.

B.110:  Yeah, cheese is bad for you, I know but,

A.111:  Well, you know, I, I wonder, though.  It's, I think it really depends on
the person.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  I was reading an article in the paper the other morning.  These doctors are
baffled about this eighty-seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a
day.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  Did you see that?

B.116:  Yeah, yeah, I heard about it.

A.117:  And they're wondering where does that cholesterol go.

B.118:  Yeah.  I think it, it's all in the metabolism of, of the,

A.119:  I think it is, too.  And I, and I think things like eggs and cheese,
anything like that, I think it just depends on who you are.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  Because, uh, I know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're
just as healthy as can be.

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  I mean, I, I'm sort of strange in a way.  I'm, I'm about twenty pounds
overweight and I smoke, but my blood pressure is about, my last reading was
just the other day.  It was one hundred two over seventy-nine.

B.124:  Well, that's, that's the same with me.  I do both and my blood pressure is,
I think it was the last time I took it, it was a hundred and, hundred and ten
over seventy,

A.125:  Yeah, good and low.

B.126:   or something like that, yeah.

A.127:  And, uh, I mean, you'd think by looking at me my, I'd have a bad heart and
everything.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  Terrific heart, great blood pressure.

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  Jeez, I'm not worried about it [laughter].

B.132:  [Laughter] No, if you didn't eat, if you knocked off everything that they
say is not good for you to eat, uh, you'd be just about down to bread and
water.

A.133:  Yeah, exactly.  And, and, and even then you've got to watch the bread and
the water [laughter].

B.134:  Yeah, it would have to be a diet bread.

A.135:  Yeah.  You never know what's in the water, either [laughter].

@@B.136:  [Laughter] Well, it's been nice talking with you.

A.137:  Well, good talking to you.  You have yourself a good night.

B.138:  Okay.  You too.

A.139:  Talk, thank you.  Talk to you later.

B.140:  Bye-bye.
