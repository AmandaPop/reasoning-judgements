===========================================================================

A.1:  [Beep] #Okay.#  

B.2:  #Pretty# loud one.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Uh, where do you stand on gun control?  

@B.4:  I'm against it.  

A.5:  Aga-, your a one then?  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.  I, I, uh, your against gun control?  

B.8:  #Yes.#  

A.9:  #Wh-,# why?  

B.10:  You, you can't enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more.

A.11:  That's a good, that's a very good point, very good point.  I personally, I
guess I would be a five, they said pick a one to ten,

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  uh, because I, I'm, I think I'm dead smack in the middle.  I think that if
there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced, like you
said, and I feel like if there, if, if there is a band put upon us it wouldn't
be a forc-, enforced, just like, um, there's suppose to be working on a drug
problem, suppose be working on our education,

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  problems, things like that, and those aren't being enforced but at the
same time I want to see people protect themselves because things like the
drug, the drug war is not, is not helping and I feel like I have to protect
myself when I go out somewhere because there's so many people, they're crazy
people out there,

B.16:  That's correct, 

A.17:  you know, and so,

B.18:  I don't know how, maybe that's, I agree one hundred percent, I just, uh,
what irritates me, I guess, is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws
that do nothing but take away your, your constitutional amendments,

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  and that is, that is really not, gun control is not the problem,

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  it's the people using the guns -- 

A.23:  Exactly.  

B.24:  -- and all they're doing is look at this new Brady Bill, 

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  the seven day waiting period -- 

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun. 

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  There's spots here in Austin, 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  on Sixth Street to Eleventh, ea-, east of the interstate --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want --

A.35:  Wow.  

B.36:  -- I mean, you know, 

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  and whether you want guns, drugs, women, 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  anything, uh,

A.41:  Yeah, it's just, it's just like the drugs, I mean, they're legal,

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  but you can get them anywhere, 

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  if you want, you can get it.

B.46:  You can make two phone calls if you know, if you know anybody here in town,
uh, you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons.

A.47:  Uh, that is a shame.  

B.48:  The law's just, you know, they can't enforce what they have --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- you know, and I'm not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- but he was on one of the, on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on
there and Brady, Mrs. Gonzalez,

A.53:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.54:  #and some# of the other liberals but, you know, and he, he pulled this big
stack of papers out that was about, oh, four feet tall and he said these are
all the current gun laws you have the books, if you can't enforce these why do
you think you can pass another,

A.55:  Right. 

B.56:  one and enforce it.  

A.57:  Exactly.  

B.58:  But, uh, the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the
people that are honest to buy one, th-, those that are criminals which are
the ones that are refusing guns in the first place, uh, they're not going to
walk in and buy one anyway.

A.59:  The reason I think I'm so cloudy on the issue [squeak] is because, I mean
it, it, I want to protect myself but at the same time I don't want anyone to
have a gun that could harm me, you know what I'm saying?

B.60:   Well, uh, the, uh, #proper,# 

A.61:  #And so,#   

B.62:  solution is, education of the masses, 

A.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.64:  you've got to educate the people, 

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  in, in, using the weapons --  

A.67:  Exactly.  

B.68:  -- and, you know, our forefathers, you know, everybody carried a gun, here
in Texas --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- you know, for, you know, a couple of hundred years.  

A.71:  Right, but everyone weren't, they weren't going around killing each other.

B.72:  That's true, unless, of course, there was, you know, 

A.73:  Trouble, yeah.  

B.74:  su-, sufficient provocation which we have basically the same something now,
it's just that all the honest people, you know, the citizens as it were, no
longer carry guns to defend themselves, because on-, only the criminals are.

A.75:  But, do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons?

B.76:  Oh, yeah.  

A.77:  I mean just to, I'm talking about the regular like, 

B.78:  Oh, yeah,  

A.79:  Joe Blow, on the,  

B.80:  uh, I, 

A.81:  street.  

B.82:  have a class license,  

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  for firearms and a friend of mine owns a gun shop in (( )), 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  and I go up and help him, you know, work in the store and stuff like that
and it, it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns, and the reason
they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car
with them --

A.87:  Right.  

B.88:  -- and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and
they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse --

A.89:  Right, uh-huh.  I mean you,

B.90:  -- and,

A.91:  you have to because I, I mean, I don't have a gun, it just scares me to
have one, but I feel like that very soon I'm going to have to get one just,

B.92:  Well, 

A.93:  because I #would probably feel safer.#

B.94:  #if you get one, you know,#

A.95:  Right now I have a knife under the seat in my car, uh, if I'm going
anywhere at night, anywhere, I mean if I'm just stepping outside my door I
carry something on me.  If I'm, you know, going up to my door and I don't have
anything I put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand, you
know.

B.96:  You're single I take it.  

A.97:  I'm sorry.  

B.98:  Are you single I, 

A.99:  #Yes, yes,#  

B.100:  #take it,#   

A.101:  #I am.#  

B.102:  #yeah, okay.#

A.103:  I have a boyfriend,

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  but, you know, he's not always around.  

B.106:  Well, my wife, uh, before we got married, uh, she didn't carry any sort of
thing and,

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  uh, I, I've got, uh, I've acquired, you know, her, you know, bought several
that I give her to carry, one of them she carries in her purse --

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  -- and there's some in the car, I, I always have one in my truck when I'm
driving any place,

A.111:  Yes, my boyfriend,

B.112:  you know.

A.113:  that, that got me, you know, put the knives here and there and, you know,
just,

B.114:  #You know, knives or mace or,#  

A.115:  #different things and,# 

B.116:  something, 

A.117:  Yeah,

B.118:  but, uh, you know.

A.119:  and I have mace on my key chain, I mean, I have a lot of, you know, little
things that, that, I don't, I don't like to have to carry them,

B.120:  #Well, it's a sad state of affairs when,# 

A.121:  #you know, but I have to.#  

B.122:  have to but, uh, 

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  you know, they're are more and more homes getting broken, 

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  into and everybody says well, uh, it's because of guns.  No, it's not
because of the guns,

A.127:  No, no,  

B.128:  it's because of the people, 

A.129:  that's right.  

B.130:  and, and actually they're breaking into the homes, 

A.131:  That's right.  

B.132:  and, and using weapons to buy drugs, although, you do have those that, you
know, like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that A K forty-seven and shot
everybody up at the McDonald's in California,

A.133:   Uh-huh, uh-huh, now that's just, 

B.134:  you know, 

A.135:  lunacy, that's,

B.136:  we're talking about somebody whose crazy, having a gun law is not going to
stop him,

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  because he's going to find one,  

A.139:  #He'll find,#  

B.140:  #and, uh,# 

A.141:  some other way whether it's a gun, 

B.142:  California, 

A.143:  or bomb or what.  

B.144:  California, Hawaii, and New York state have these and, uh, now New Jersey
had the stiffest gun laws.

A.145:  Oh, do they?  

B.146:  Oh, yeah, but, you know, where, where are the most crimes committed,

A.147:  Yeah, 

B.148:  New York state.  

A.149:  uh-huh.  

B.150:  As, you know, uh, John Lennon was, you know, you know, was shot
and killed, 

A.151:  Uh-huh.  

B.152:  in, uh, New York by a guy that bought a gun in Hawaii, which
has a tough gun law --  

A.153:  Uh, uh, uh. 

B.154:  -- and, you know, I mean, this clown out in, uh, California he, uh, had a
criminal record, you know, a mile long --

A.155:  And still got a gun.  

B.156:  -- but he still had, not one but several -- 

A.157:  Uh-huh.  

B.158:  -- and there was one not too long ago but in the last six months, uh, he
shot up that Alstate, or, or, or that G M C credit place,

A.159:  Right, 

B.160:  in Florida --  

A.161:  Uh-huh.   

B.162:  -- well he went out and bought six different guns -- 

A.163:  Uh,  

B.164:  -- #you know, and he had,#

A.165:  #and I mean if you fi-,#

B.166:  a criminal record.  

A.167:  if you offer a, uh, enough monies to somebody they'll go get you a gun,

B.168:  Oh, yeah.  

A.169:  you know, if your not eligible, you know, come to me, offer me enough money
I'll go get you a gun, you know, there's probably,

B.170:  #And there are peop-,# 

A.171:  #a lot of people like that.#  

B.172:  Yeah, they're people doing that,  

A.173:  Yeah.   

B.174:  so, I mean, the, the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't
enforce,

A.175:  Uh-huh.  

B.176:  because they're, they're going to pass one now, they're trying too, either
the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill,

A.177:  Uh-uh.  

B.178:  either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money,

A.179:  Right, and not probably, 

B.180:  #B-, and, and, and,# 

A.181:  #going to help too much.#  

B.182:  we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and
what are they going to do, they're going to punch your name in the computer
and you're going to come up as, no you're not a criminal and no, and no you
have no criminal record, you know, and yeah, you can by gun --

A.183:  Uh-huh.  

B.184:  -- but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three
days later shoot somebody --

A.185:  Exactly,  

B.186:  -- you know,  

A.187:  #a lot, a lot of people,#

B.188:  #there's no substitute for people.#

A.189:  that are in jail, you know,

B.190:  Oh, yeah.

A.191:  it's their first shooting or why do people, you know, not everybody has
shot someone before.

B.192:  Actually guns are not the prime, uh, weapon used in killing people in
crimes of passion or whatever --

A.193:  Uh-huh.  

B.194:  -- it's knives and baseball bats.  

A.195:  Uh-huh.  Baseball bats?    

B.196:  Yeah.

A.197:  I didn't know that.

B.198:  Oh, yeah.  

A.199:  I could see knives, yeah, stabbings and things.  

B.200:  See, you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks
anything about it --

A.201:  Uh-huh.  

B.202:  -- you know, and how many times have you seen people walking down the
street carrying a baseball bat --

A.203:  Uh-huh.  

B.204:  -- you figure, what, little leaguers on their way to practice. 

A.205:  Yeah.  

B.206:  They could be gang members, just as easy.  

A.207:  I didn't,

B.208:  If you,

A.209:  know baseball bats, 

B.210:  Oh, yeah,  

A.211:  was like that.  

B.212:  it's, uh, it's quite a deal.  

A.213:  Uh.  

B.214:  Nobody pays attention to a baseball bat,  

A.215:  Uh-huh.  

B.216:  you know, and you, you can see a baseball bat in the back of the car and
nobody, no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of
your car.

A.217:  That's a very deadly weapon.  

B.218:  Yeah, so why, you know,

A.219:  I mean one blow at that and,

B.220:  Yeah or knives, you can have knives, 

A.221:  Uh-huh.  

B.222:  everybody's got knives, 

A.223:  Uh-huh.  

B.224:  of course, you're limited, you know, you can't have switchblades and stuff,

A.225:  Uh-huh. 

B.226:  but, uh, you know, guns are used but so is everything else.  

A.227:  Uh-huh.  

B.228:  If you're going to ban that, if you're going to band guns, I've got an
article in the Wall Street Journal where they had, where they had, uh, used a
satire where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were
used for commission of drug regulated crimes --

A.229:  Uh-huh.  

B.230:  -- and they immediately decided, well, lets start banning the public
telephones,

A.231:  [Sneezing]. 

B.232:  bless you -- 

A.233:  I'm sorry.  

B.234:  -- and they said, well, let's band the public telephones too because the
public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes --

A.235:  Very true.  

B.236:  -- makes about as much sense --  

A.237:  A lot of sense.  

B.238:  -- but, you know, the, 

A.239:  Uh. 

B.240:  to my way of thinking, you know, uh, I'm a, I'm, you know, I spilled blood
on the ground, you know, for in the United States --

A.241:  Uh-uh.  

B.242:  -- and, uh, if, if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun
after that then I trust them enough to govern me --

A.243:  Right.  Right.  

B.244:  -- but, I'm kind of radical on that I just, you know,

A.245:  You sound like you're pretty strongly.  

B.246:  Well, I, I see too much, 

A.247:  Yeah. 

B.248:  of it and I see people come into the shop up there and, you know, and I buy
guns and, and they haven't got the faintest idea what you're doing, you know,
and they want to buy a gun,

A.249:  Right.  

B.250:  now I think there should be some sort of I D card that you carry.

A.251:  What do you think about making some kind of application or something?

B.252:  There's an application, you fill out now --  

A.253:  Do you, okay. 

B.254:  -- it's a yellow form -- 

A.255:  Uh-huh.  

B.256:  -- but, uh, see that's, it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for
your name, your address and phone number and the county, where you birth and
all and, you know, and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and if
you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American,

A.257:  [Laughter]. 

B.258:  seriously, and, 

A.259:  Yeah, uh, uh, uh. 

B.260:  it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial
number, the gun, who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the
gun shop and it never goes anywhere, it stays right there --

A.261:  Uh. 

B.262:  -- we've got boxes full in the back room -- 

A.263:  Well, that's a lot of help.  

B.264:  -- and, and the only thing that it's used for is, if, uh, if Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection --

A.265:  Uh-huh.  

B.266:  -- they look through, and if they look through, and if they look through
your legal logbook, you have to log it,

A.267:  and they probably,

B.268:  down in and out, well you got,

A.269:  really do that.  

B.270:  and they, and they don't come out very often,

A.271:  Uh-huh.

B.272:  I've seen them once in about five years. 

A.273:  Oh my goodness.

B.274:  They come down,
