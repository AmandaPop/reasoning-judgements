@A.1:  All right, Betty, uh, what do you think about air pollution?  What all you
know about it?

B.2:  Well, I guess, I've, uh, just I've listened a lot to the media and I've
tried to read some things on it and I've tried to take some steps to, uh,
understand it and figure out where I am in the whole mess.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Um, apparently it's getting worse, I mean,

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  I can tell that just by driving in Dallas, you have the low flying, gray
cloud on certain days but, you know, it really gets to you in terms of being
able to breathe and, and, and things like that so we know that if you do the
same thing to like your plants and you don't let them breathe, they kind of
die,

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  on you.  Um, and, so, you know, looking at the different areas that, um,
cause air pollution, um, I guess we have industry for one, um, that has to be
I guess a little bit more aware of, you know, the output and, uh, harmful
chemicals and things that they use, um, what do you think about that?

A.9:  Well, I think it's very true, uh, they are a lot of companies that don't
have much regard for the environment, they're, [breathing], primary goal's to
produce a product as cheaply as they can,

B.10:  Oh, right.

A.11:  and, uh, you know, some environmental standards, like a filters on
smokestacks, et cetera, are quite expensive, and they just don't want to sink
the money into it unless someone clamps down on them, makes them do it.  And
dumping chemicals, et cetera, and all that, you know, they're just looking for
the easy way out which, you know, I guess they're very shortsighted and they
only look at what,

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  interests them and so, I guess, sort of you g-, you got to blame them but
you understand what they're, why they don't do it.  You just have to educate
these people to what they're actually doing, show them like this is what your
plant is doing, and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost
for the product which probably stops a lot of people from getting involved in
the environmental issues, you know, they, besides sinking their own time into
it is, that, when we police these companies, you know, they say, well, look,
we're having to pay two million to put this filter device on it, you're going
to pay an extra thirty cents at the store for, uh, whatever.  And we're like,
oh, no, you know.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  That's a, sa-, but and recycling, I'm big on recycling. 

B.16:  Oh, good, yeah.

A.17:  And, uh, but, you know, a lot of people aren't.  I mean, people I know that
are ju-, you know, they're good people and they know, I go you don't recycle
that, no, like, well, just stick it in a different bag, you know, like,

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  aluminum cans.  Like if I, if I give you a bag and you stick the cans in
there, will you give them to me.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Oh, yeah, I'll do.  So, you know, I, I'm going to, uh, work on doing that a
little bit more to people that, you know, they just aren't, they're just not,
either not aware or they just,

B.22:  Well, 

A.23:  don't think about it. 

B.24:  that's true, I think, you know, we, we had such, I mean, I'm, I'm close
to forty and I can remember the good old days when we didn't have to worry
about all this stuff and life was pretty, you know, um, complacent in these
areas and, uh, I think you're right though that we not only pay the price in
money, we're going to pay the price in health and our, you know, in the future
whatever's going to happen here,

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  and, you know, it takes a few people, you know, on the alert to, uh, um,
really make a change and make a difference in the way people think, and you're
right about the education, it's just got to be little by little by little
until people become aware, but I think we've got sort of a snowball effect
going on now and I think that, you know, in terms of air pollution we're, um,
pinpointing certain, you know, industries in our own communities that are, you
know, blatantly, um, abusing the airspace [laughter],

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  and I think we're beginning to make them aware that, um, you know, it's
not just the, a financial bottom line that they have to look at it's, you
know, um, it has a, a bigger impact on the, on the whole environment and the
whole area.  And gosh I, I don't know, you know, health seems to get in, in
the act too, you know, your, your health and your lungs and, and all this, I
mean, this comes down to smokers,

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  and I don't know what to do about smokers because, you know, that's sort
of an infringement of they're rights, see you can go overboard too, you can be
real radical about this and I'm not for that.  I'm for persuading people by
the use of education and by demonstration and by, um, you know, your example
of how things go, um, and, you know I know there's some real radicals out
there and that, that will tend to turn you off any time and think that
they're, you know, full of baloney and they're not, you know, [laughter] on
the right planet sometimes.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  But, you know what I mean about that? 

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  I think it's education like you said that really needs to, and it starts
with you.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Like you said, just tell them to, you know,

A.37:  ((They're)), 

B.38:  wh-, why you're doing, why you're collecting cans and why you're
collecting glass and why you're recycling the stuff and gosh.

A.39:  It just seems though, um, I guess we could talk about smoking because it is
a form of air pollution.  And, uh, oh, my, my father passed away at the age of
fifty of a coronary artery disease.

B.40:  Oh. 

A.41:  And he had smoked, you know, pretty heavily since he went in the army like
age eighteen.  And, you know, I've been fairly well educated on that subject
and,

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  and I feel that, uh, you know, that was a primary factor that caused his
premature death, so I'm sort of on a ban wagon to say about the s-, the
adverse affects of smoking, and I just wonder, you know, all the time when I
was a little kid breathing the smo-, second-hand smoke which people say is
just as bad or,

B.44:  Just as, yeah.

A.45:  even worse than what the smoker gets through the filter, you know, what
affect that had on me for a coronary artery disease when I was younger but,
you know, I, I don't think I'm what you'd call a radical but it just seems
that people that smoke, you just don't, they just don't listen.

B.46:  Well, get, it's, yeah, it's hard.  It's really hard and they have to maybe,
sort of like, like hit bottom, like they either have to die or they have to
be, you know, totally incapacitated,

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  before they change their mind.  And, you know, bless their hearts, you
can't do anything that will impact them or, or you, you can't find a way
really that it's, it's, it's almost like, you know, ((you can)) talk about
alcoholism too, I mean, you know, in this ((hidden)) in this manner sometimes
I think that it's just a person has to change their mind.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  And, uh, it's tough but, um, you know, it, it, I don't allow people to
smoke in my house and I, I hope they respect that,

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  and, you know, I, I send them outside [laughter],

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  sort of thing and, and they respect that or else they just don't come
back, they don't smoke in my car,

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  and, you know, and it's not getting to be a big deal anymore [laughter],
I, you know, they,

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  they seem to, uh, understand or at least have a little bit of respect for
your wishes and they don't just necessarily light up and, and, uh, you know,
not expect to get some flack these days [laughter].

A.59:  Yeah, so I guess the education has sunk in a little bit as to not, you
know, as to respect an-, another persons clean air,

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  in that respect, but, I had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery
and was near death many times and he's, you know, they told him for years to
quit smoking and he still smokes, you know,

B.62:  Well, yeah.

A.63:  you know, some people is just, but he's, he's good and then he came to
visit and he would run outside to smoke instead,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  of smoking in the house, so, you know, I have to say, well, I guess if
you're going to do it, do it out there, and don't,

B.66:  Use your own lungs, don't borrow mine [laughter].

A.67:  Right.  That's cool. 

B.68:  ((Can)) take part in your air, [laughter].  Yeah, well, things are getting,
I mean, like I said, I don't know, why I know how old I am and I know that I
never had to worry about the stuff, I thought, you know, the grass is green,
the sky was blue and the ocean was a pretty light blue, [laughter], you know,
and, and I'm finding out that that's not always the case anymore,

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  and that, you know, the damage has been done and, you know, we're left
with a mess in a lot of ways, you know, caused by, um, starting with the air
pollution and, and that's just one of the factors that goes into, you know,
trying to get this place cleaned up but, 

A.71:  Yeah, if you notice, uh, I'm from Indiana,

B.72:  Oh. 

A.73:  and we really gauge the weather, the winters,

B.74:  Gary, Indiana, huh? 

A.75:  by how much snow we get.  

B.76:  ((which one)), oh, really. 

A.77:  So, uh, it's, when I was growing up you always could expect some snowfall
(( )) twenty-four even up to, we had thirty-eight inches of snow one time, but
the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all.

B.78:  Really? 

A.79:  Yeah, it's, you know, maybe there will be six inches on the ground at one
time and it will blow for a while and then it will all melt away it's just
like, they kept talking about this, you know, the global warming, the
greenhouse,

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  effect and all that, well, I can just see it because, you know, school
would get canceled probably a week, week and a half each year,

B.82:  Oh, I remember yeah, oh, I'm from Chicago.

A.83:  Pardon.

B.84:  Gr-, I grew up in Chicago, so, yeah, you know, we had a lot of snow up
there.

A.85:  Yeah, you had a lot of snow and,

B.86:  Oh, absolutely. 

@@A.87:  and you always had to scoop it and it was, it was fun to play in but, you
know, last few years ...
