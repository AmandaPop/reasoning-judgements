============================================================================

A.1:  All right, I guess our, we're in the process of a home repair right at this
point because we're, we're painting the outside of our house.  I don't know, I
guess you would consider that a home repair. 

B.2:  Huh-uh. 

A.3:  Certainly, uh, uh, and interesting enough, this time we're changing the
color which makes it an addition.  What is your most recent,

B.4:  We just (( )) did that, too. 

A.5:  You did that recently too, uh,?

B.6:  Yes. 

A.7:  Does it make a big difference?

B.8:  Oh, yes we have brick on the outside and, uh, the colors that were there
changed the, and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the
house. 

A.9:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.10:  # Completely.  #

A.11:  That's neat isn't it. 

B.12:  Yeah.  That was really exciting.  It was fun. 

A.13:  I was really, really tired of the color.  That it's, it's helping.  We're
not quite through, but it's, it really is looking good.  Uh, we went through a
process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had, probably the
most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned
about what we could do.  Um, we didn't have very much money and so we had to
do it ourselves in kind of a slow process, but we learned how to do, uh,
retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual.

B.14:  Huh-uh.  So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house. 

A.15:  Huh-uh. 

B.16:  And, uh, we did that a different color also. 

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men. 

A.19:  Huh-uh. 

B.20:  And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved but, uh, they really were helpful, I
know, to our house. 

A.21:  It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it [laughter]. 

B.22:  Yeah [laughter].  Yes [laughter]. 

A.23:  [Laughter] That's awful.  Um, ((Howard)) and I were talking about
home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting.  We've got a
scout coming up and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how
to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing
faucets, dripping faucets,

B.24:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.25:  # and # putting in panes of glass and stuff like that. 

B.26:  As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son and one thing we did,
was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall
way of our house, rather, and we were repainting the, the front room in the
hall there, and we took down that paneling and he helped me and, and, uh, he
was, it was fun to work with him.

A.27:  Huh-uh. 

B.28:  And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,

A.29:  # [Laughter].  #

B.30:  # like # that. 

A.31:  How does the paneling, it looks lots better than, do you like it better?

B.32:  Oh, I like it so much better.  It makes it so much lighter. 

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  You know, it really does.  You know, and people that have been to my house
before and then now really have liked,

A.35:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.36:  # much # better, too. 

A.37:  That's nice. 

B.38:  It's been fun. 

A.39:  Nice to have it come out positive and look,

B.40:  # Yeah.  #

A.41:  # look # good. 

B.42:  Yeah.  Exactly. 

A.43:  Well, we have a lot that needs be done.  We have, uh, uh, carpeting, and,
and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen.  And, um, I have my
mother living with us and so she was in a room with a carpet and, of course,
she's quite aged, she's ninety-three now, so that meant she had problems now
and then and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a
linoleum down.  So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was and
[laughter],

B.44:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.45:  # so # that was a really positive, uh, uh, it was fairly expensive though. 
I, I was impressed, I think, that, uh, we had somebody do it and it was, it
seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than
it is to put down carpet. 

B.46:  Huh-uh. 

A.47:  Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,

B.48:  # Yeah.  #

A.49:  # but, # uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything
and, and fix the floor so it's, uh, I don't know, what ever, but they have to
put stuff on the floor and it's, uh, kind of a process.  Well, it sounds like
you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair.

B.50:  Huh-uh.  We have.  It's been really fun. 

A.51:  Yeah.  All right.  Happy home repairing. 

B.52:  Okay.  You too [laughter]. 

A.53:  Bye-Bye. 

B.54:  Bye-Bye.
