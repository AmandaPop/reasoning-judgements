A.1:  Hello. 

B.2:  Yeah. 

A.3:  Okay. 

B.4:  Okay. 

A.5:  Uh, do you work at T I?

B.6:  No, I don't.  Do you?

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  Oh, okay. 

A.9:  What company are you, are you working at all?

B.10:  Yeah, I work for N C N B. 

A.11:  Oh, okay. 

B.12:  And, let's see, the question was, what benefits you consider most
important,

@A.13:  # Yeah.  #

B.14:  # I # think, uh, definitely medical and dental insurance. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  Um, life insurance, long-term disability, uh, vacation. 

A.17:  What?

B.18:  Vacation [laughter]. 

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  Don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are. 

B.20:  Yeah, and, um, I think what I don't like some of the policies that our
company has that I don't like, I don't like their sick leave policy, their
short-term disability policy, and I would like to see them do something about,
uh, child care. 

A.21:  Yeah.  What is their sick leave policy?

B.22:  Oh, it's only like, I don't know like six days a year which is way below
the national average.

A.23:  Is it paid?

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  Uh, do you get penalized for taking it off?

B.26:  No. 

A.27:  The reason why I ask that is, um, T I, uh, the hourly employees, um, they
have, I'm not sure, up to five years they have a certain number of days and
after five years they have, um, unlimited, uh, personal time off, but if they
miss more than, say, ten point five hours in a three month period,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # they # get penalized for it. 

B.30:  That's not even two days. 

A.31:  So, really they don't ever, huh?

B.32:  That's not even two days. 

A.33:  Huh-uh. 

B.34:  And what if you get the flu and you're sick for a week [laughter], 

A.35:  # The problem is with that,#

B.36:  # or two? #

A.37:  is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so,

B.38:  # Oh, no.  #

A.39:  # no one # could even take off a day for pay, you know, P T O,

B.40:  # Yeah.  #

A.41:  # um, # because they get penalized for it and they lose their certification
pay which is like fifty-five cents an hour for three whole months, so,

B.42:  # Wow.  #

A.43:  # it's # really not a very good benefit. 

B.44:  No, that's (( )), [laughter], I wouldn't call that much of a benefit at
all.  I think, you know, people get sick and if you get sick usually you're
sick for more than a day and then, you know, if your children get sick,

A.45:  # Yeah.  #

B.46:  # uh, # you know, parents have to take time off for that and,

A.47:  # Yeah.  #

B.48:  # um, #

A.49:  That's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids
get sick it's like, well, I can't afford to,

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # take # off but I have to. 

B.52:  And I think, you know, it varies from manager to manager.  Some managers
keep track of it and some managers don't,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # and # it's really unfair {very faint} you know. 

A.55:  That's true it is.  It's not really, uh, consistent. 

B.56:  But I think, you know, at N C N B in any, any work place being a single
parent I think that child care is my greatest expense and, uh, you know, it's,
it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore. 

A.57:  Yeah.  I really wish that somebody in big companies or any company would
take a hint from like that movie NINE TO FIVE, did you see that?

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  Where they had the child care right there on the,

B.60:  Right there, yes. 

A.61:  That was so good and that would help the morale of parents,

B.62:  # Yeah.  #

A.63:  # I # think,

B.64:  # Very much.  #

A.65:  # so much, #

B.66:  # Very much.  #

A.67:  # because I # hate to see that, I mean, probably ninety percent of the
people that work for me are single parents and they have to, you know, use
child care at least for a couple hours a days.

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  So, I don't know, I, I really think a big company needs to take
responsibility for that. 

B.70:  And I think they should even do something for when children are sick,

A.71:  # Yeah.  #

B.72:  # you # know, provide facilities for sick children, although, I know that's
not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just
would rather stay home but, um, you know, i-, my options are, you know, to
either call in sick, to take, to take him to one of those places that takes
care of sick children, uh, and that's about it.

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  You know, a lot of times I don't have the option of staying home
((without)), you know, I just can't ((you know)) there's something going on
that day or, you know, that I have to be there for.

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  And I know a lot of, um, what I do like though is I see a lot of men taking
off and they take turns with their wives. 

A.77:  Yeah, that's good. 

B.78:  You know, staying home with the kids but that's still, you know, kids are
sick a lot [laughter]. 

A.79:  I know, it's real, I don't have kids yet but it's tough. 

B.80:  And, uh,

A.81:  Um, what kind of, uh, [breathing] how many vacation days do you get a year?

B.82:  Well, u-, I get three weeks. 

A.83:  That's great, for how many years you been, have you worked there?

B.84:  I got that when I started because I was, because I'm an officer of the
company. 

A.85:  Oh, wow.  That's great. 

B.86:  So, it depends on if you're an, if you're not an officer, it depends on how
long you've been there.  I think you get like a week your first year, and then
two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or
four years,

A.87:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.88:  # and # then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to
four weeks,

A.89:  # Huh.  #

B.90:  # so, # I'm real happy with the vacation.  I guess, you know, you could
take vacation days if you had to stay home but,

A.91:  Yeah.  T I isn't doing very well, so, like I'm, I'm negative vacation
because I've only worked there three years and I,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # I # get five days every six months.  Well,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # every, # about two, three months we shut down for a week because,

B.96:  # Oh.  #

A.97:  # you # know, there's no,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # demand # for our product, so. 

B.100:  I've heard of companies that do that. 

A.101:  Yeah, and, so, we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only
shut down two.

B.102:  Huh. 

A.103:  And so it's kind of hurt. 

B.104:  Yeah, and you have to use your vacation pay for that. 

A.105:  Yeah.  And luckily my boss has maybe, you know, allowed me to work it off
but a lot of people, you know, go in the hole and, uh, take, you know, weeks
without pay and it's tough. 

B.106:  Oh.  Can you collect unemployment?

A.107:  Um, I don't ever but the people that work for me do. 

B.108:  Do they?

A.109:  Yeah.  I, mainly the reason because I'm salary so I don't ever lose pay, I
mean,

B.110:  # Yeah.  #

A.111:  # I # just go in debt for vacation [laughter], 

B.112:  # [Laughter].  #

A.113:  # so, # yeah. 

B.114:  Well, that's, yeah, that's not, not very good.  Are you satisfied with your
insurance?

A.115:  Um, yeah, mainly because I haven't had, really had to use it much, I mean,

B.116:  Does your company pay for it or do you pay for it?

A.117:  Yeah.  I have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him, I
mean, it's like,

B.118:  Do you have ((flexible)) benefits where you can get, sort of like pick and
choose. 

A.119:  So-, sort of, yeah.  Um, the reason why I don't know much is because I
don't real, uh, I haven't really had to use like, my medical I know they
increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt.

B.120:  Uh-huh. 

A.121:  And, oh, and after that they pay like eighty percent, and the dentals, the
dental covers quite a bit, but, like I said, I've never really been sick or
anything so I've never had to use it. 

B.122:  I think our, our insurance, we have to pay for part of it and the company
pays for part of it, but it's expensive but I don't think it's out of line with
((what)) other company, you know,

A.123:  # Huh.  #

B.124:  # with # what other companies do, it's just that in general it's, it's
expensive and, you know, I don't, I don't like it.  Do you have, uh, um, four O
one K?

A.125:  Is that like match savings?

B.126:  Yeah. 

A.127:  Yeah.  It's fifty percent matched. 

B.128:  Well, that's good.  How,

A.129:  Some companies I know are a hundred percent matched. 

B.130:  Really?

A.131:  Yeah, like,

B.132:  Where, where are [laughter], 

A.133:  Harris Semiconductors in Florida. 

B.134:  (( )) [laughter] look for a new job. 

A.135:  Huh?

B.136:  Ours will only match twenty-five. 

A.137:  Really?

B.138:  Yeah, for up to ten percent of your salary. 

A.139:  Ours is only up to four percent though. 

B.140:  Oh, okay, well, then I guess that's makes a difference. 

A.141:  Yeah.  Because, I mean, I only put in like a real small amount because it's
four percent,

B.142:  # Yeah.  #

A.143:  # you # know, af-, af-, after that you put it in and you get like in-,
interest, I mean, I've saved quite a bit, it's helped me a lot,

B.144:  # Well, that's good.  #

A.145:  # but you have # to roll it over to an I R A if you ever quit. 

B.146:  Yeah. 

A.147:  But, you know, that's still a good deal. 

B.148:  Yeah, I'm glad that we, that we have that, um, the company that I worked
for before N C N B was just, they were just starting it, and, uh,

A.149:  # Huh.  #

B.150:  # I # think that's, I think that's great. 

A.151:  Yeah.  It teaches people to think of the future I think. 

B.152:  Well, yeah, because retirement plans now are so bad, I don't know about
your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they
compensate employees more with bonuses,

A.153:  # Really? #

B.154:  # and # incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their
expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what
your salary was not what your salary plus bonuses where and your,

A.155:  # Oh.  #

B.156:  # your # bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary. 

A.157:  Wow. 

B.158:  So. 

A.159:  That's kind of a rip. 

B.160:  Yeah.  But more and more companies are going to that now. 

A.161:  Huh.  T I didn't even give raises this year, so. 

B.162:  At all?

A.163:  No.  They gave, uh, a few bonuses but for the most part no, nobody in T I,

B.164:  # Really? #

A.165:  # got # raises. 

B.166:  Gosh, that's pretty bad. 

A.167:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.168:  Especially with, you know, inflation and I, I've noticed that the cost of
living, I've lived in Dallas now for three years and,

A.169:  # Yeah.  #

B.170:  # the # cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that
I've been here. 

A.171:  Really?

B.172:  Yeah.  Your housing, housing mostly, I guess, is where I notice it.  But,

A.173:  {Very faint} Huh. 

B.174:  you know, in, in, you know, kids can't get more expensive as they,
