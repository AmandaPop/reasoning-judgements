A.1:  And, uh, what part of Virginia, uh?

B.2:  Uh, I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg. 

A.3:  Blacksburg.  Okay, I've been,

B.4:  Uh-huh, have you ever heard of Virginia Tech?

A.5:  Sounds vaguely familiar. 

B.6:  V P I. 

A.7:  Yeah, okay. 

B.8:  Yeah, okay. 

A.9:  I, I hadn't been down in that part of the state really. 

B.10:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Well, we vacation a lot.  How about you? [laughter].  Quite
frequently. 

A.11:  Uh, I wish we did [laughter]. 

B.12:  [Laughter]  Well, we retired early --

A.13:  Oh, okay. 

B.14:  -- so, we're, we take trips pretty often. 

A.15:  Where all you guys go?

B.16:  Well, we go to Maine every Fall --

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  -- then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the
coast --

A.19:  Uh-uh. 

B.20:  -- and I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico, so we go out there
and we go to Florida --

A.21:  Uh. 

B.22:  -- and down, oh, we were just out recently at the outer banks of North
Carolina. 

A.23:  All these places that I've never been [laughter]. 

B.24:  Is that right [laughter].  Where do you go?

A.25:  Uh --

B.26:  What type of vacation?

A.27:  -- well, it really depends, I mean, uh, {pause} seems like I do a lot in
the Midwest lately, uh, my, uh, fiancee's family's from Wisconsin --

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  -- and so we've been out there a couple of times and, uh, I, uh, went to
Purdue for a couple of years, so I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to
visit friends --

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  -- and, uh, uh, I'm a real big baseball fan so I usually try to combine it
with, uh, catching a couple of games somewhere. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  What club do you follow?

A.33:  I'm, uh, I'm a big Red Sox fan,

B.34:  Red S-, good,

A.35:  # but, uh, I, uh,#

B.36:  # me too [laughter].  #

A.37:  uh, you're a Red Sox fan too?

B.38:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.39:  I usually try to catch whoever's in town though, I don't specifically, I,
you know, go to Cleveland to see them play,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # the # Indians or the Red Sox, uh, uh, that's about it, we don't, I mean,
we do a lot of little trips around here, uh, and, uh,

B.42:  Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains or,

A.43:  Not that much.  We've gone out to, um, uh, a place in western Pennsylvania
called Falling Water. 

B.44:  Oh. 

A.45:  Uh, have you ever heard of it?

B.46:  I've heard of it.  I've never been there. 

A.47:  Yeah, it's, it's really neat.  It's this house built on, on a waterfall and
it's, uh, really cool [laughter]. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  Um, of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there,

B.50:  # [Laughter].  #

A.51:  # uh, # the first time we went out there was, uh, the day after hurricane
Hugo had come through [laughter]. 

B.52:  [Laughter]  Gee. 

A.53:  So, I mean they, they didn't have any power and it was really cold and, and
rainy and, uh, we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole,

B.54:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # lot # better [laughter].  So, uh, where else did we go, uh, {pause} we've
gone to Richland, last year --

B.56:  Oh, did you?

A.57:  -- and, uh, had a good time,

B.58:  # Did you go,#

A.59:  # down there.  #

B.60:  to Williamsburg, have you been down there?

A.61:  Uh, my girlfriend has with her sisters but I haven't been,

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # down # there.  Uh, I hear that's nice.  We're going to get down, probably
down Norfork sometime this Summer,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # just # to see why, catch a football game actually [laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter] We were down, well, when we came back from the outer banks we
came up due Norfork [noise] and spent the night there with a friend in
Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night.

A.67:  Uh, spend a day and a lot of money [laughter]. 

B.68:  [Laughter] Yeah [laughter]. 

A.69:  Yeah, I've heard, uh, I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of
the, of the price attached,

B.70:  # Yeah.  #

A.71:  # to # it.  We just, we, I,

B.72:  But it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around, if you like to
walk, it's a good town to just,

A.73:  # Uh.  #

B.74:  # walk # in. 

A.75:  Uh, yeah, we'll,

B.76:  # You can go,#

A.77:  # do that.  #

B.78:  to the buildings and not go in if you're not,

A.79:  Oh, okay, so I can wander around without,

B.80:  Yeah, you can wander, it's a good town to wander in. 

A.81:  Oh, okay, I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings?

B.82:  That's right. 

A.83:  Oh, okay, I didn't know that.  Yeah, I think, uh, they do the whole with,
you know, paying,

B.84:  # Yeah.  #

A.85:  # they # really did throw away a lot of money to get, getting one thing or
another,

B.86:  # Yeah.  #

A.87:  # but # they had a good time so. 

B.88:  We really didn't do that really this time, we just, uh, visited around. 

A.89:  Uh, uh,

B.90:  We've done it a couple of times and that's enough for, uh, [laughter] 
probably another twenty years. 

A.91:  Yeah, I was, uh, we use it live in California and, uh, my, um, up, up
around San Francisco, and, uh, there was one year when my father was, uh, my
father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles, so, my father
was working down in Los Angeles for like, uh, six months or so, uh, actually I
think it was closer, I think to a full year and, you know, we'd, he'd fly down
there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays, well, any time we had a school
vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles, so I saw, I went
to Disneyland about five times,

B.92:  # Oh [laughter].  #

A.93:  # in one # year and I really have no great urge to go back now. 

B.94:  [Laughter]  That's great as a kid though, isn't it, I mean,

A.95:  Oh, it was great, because, uh, well, the times that were really fun were
when, uh, we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't --

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- so we basically had one of the parks. 

B.98:  Right. 

A.99:  Uh, Disneyland, I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland, but
there was another, um, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens, uh,
there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride
like five straight times, we just get, get done with them and they go, oh, do
you want to go again,

B.100:  # [Laughter].  #

A.101:  # sure.  #

B.102:  Have you ever, you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney --

A.103:  No, I'd like to,

B.104:  -- # that's good,#

A.105:  # sometime but, #

B.106:  we, we really enjoy that, we've been two or three times and probably go
back again this winter. 

A.107:  Yeah, I've never been, the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is
Charlotte. 

B.108:  Oh. 

A.109:  So, I, um, keep wanting to get further, you know, I thought I would go to
Florida a couple Summers,

B.110:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.111:  # ago # but never did it. 

B.112:  Charleston is a really nice place to visit. 

A.113:  My, uh, my sister lives in Charlotte and they've gone to,

B.114:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.115:  # Charleston # a couple of times and had a real good,

B.116:  # Yeah, #

A.117:  # time.  #

B.118:  it's a real pretty place. 

A.119:  Uh, yeah, one of these days we'll get down there, although [laughter]. 

B.120:  [Laughter]. 

A.121:  I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it [laughter] {pause}.

A.127:  # to # go, and, uh,

B.128:  Is it on, uh, one of the lakes?

A.129:  It's, um, uh, I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin but there's
kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, uh, [laughter] in the Lake
Michigan,

B.130:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.131:  # that's # Door County [laughter]. 

B.132:  Oh, okay, yeah, that would,

A.133:  # So, #

A.135:  Yeah, they call it the Cape Cod of the, uh,

B.136:  # Oh.  [laughter].  #

nice, kind of like a travel guide --
