A.1:  I was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were
all out on the golf course. 

B.2:  Oh, really?

A.3:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.4:  Well, it's, it's raining in Texas right,

A.5:  # Okay.  #

B.6:  # now # in my area so there's probably not any golfers out on the course. 

A.7:  Oh,

B.8:  # Uh, #

A.9:  # Yeah, # I'd,

B.10:  they just, they just said that the, uh, Byron Nelson Tournament here had
been suspended --

A.11:  Oh, no. 

B.12:  -- for it because of rain, of course, that's just for today.  It'll,

A.13:  # Yeah.  #

B.14:  # It'll # play again, finish tomorrow, you know, or finish today's round
tomorrow. 

A.15:  Well, near Dallas you're used to playing golf in the wind too. 

B.16:  Oh, right.  Yeah. 

A.17:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.18:  Well, I, I'm not really much of a golfer.  I have not played golf in
probably fifteen years but, uh, it, it is an intention to take up the (( )),
the, uh, sport again. 

A.19:  The biggest problem with it I think is time. 

B.20:  Right.  Uh,

A.21:  And I, I know that it's a four hour dedication.  It could be four hour
relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much
time,

B.22:  # Yeah.  #

A.23:  # uh, # and not, not having that much fun [laughter].

B.24:  [Laughter] Right.  Well, yeah, if, if you're good at it I guess it's a, not
so much frustration but if you are it, it, you know, if you're not a really
good golfer it, it can be real for-,

A.25:  # Yeah.  #

B.26:  # real # frustrating. 

A.27:  And I, I played tennis for exercise but I play golf for fun,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # uh, # and,

B.30:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

A.31:  # apparently # it's the attitude that you have that makes the big
difference.  The, uh, I,

B.32:  # [Cough].  #

A.33:  # I # enjoy catching it too.  Do you ever go out to the,

B.34:  # Well, I, #

A.35:  # tournament there.  #

B.36:  well, it's, it's been a while since I've been out to watch.  I do watch a
little on T V, you know, when I have the chance --

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  -- but, uh,

A.39:  Uh-huh.  I keep wondering why, I, you can understand in sports like, um,
basketball or baseball or football there's an age --

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  -- uh, position in there but I keep wondering why some of the real legends
can't go just a little bit longer than they do. 

B.42:  Well, you know, I wonder that too.  In watching some of these senior
tournaments, uh, you know, the, uh, the seniors skins,

A.43:  # Right.  Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # and stuff # like that on T V you see how well they're playing and you,
and you wonder why they're,

A.45:  # Uh, #

B.46:  # they're # not,

A.47:  In the,

B.48:  able,

A.49:  regular tour. 

B.50:  to, you know, to play with, uh, with the, with the younger guys on the
regular tour. 

A.51:  And they do mix, some of them mix it but it's, uh, it, it does amaze me
sometimes just to see it.  I don't know whether it's a lack of concentration or
particular muscle development,

B.52:  # [Cough].  #

A.53:  # or # what but it seems to be, uh, I, to me it's not a sport that you
would be overwhelmed with muscle activity.

B.54:  Right.  Well, as I understand it and, of course, it's, like I said it's
been a while since I played but, uh, as I understand it as you do get older
that your concentration in the putting area, you know, really suffers and
that's, that's the primary reason that some of these older, that, you know,
that the old players don't play as well,

A.55:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  But, uh,

A.57:  I tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though. 

B.58:  Oh, yeah.  I,

A.59:  I, as I said I play tennis and there are no tennis jokes.  I don't know if
you,

B.60:  # [Laughter].  #

A.61:  # can # think of one at all. 

B.62:  I guess come to think of it I've never heard a tennis,

A.63:  # [Laughter].  #

B.64:  # joke # [Laughter]. 

A.65:  But, but there are a slew of golf jokes.  So,

B.66:  # Yeah.  #

A.67:  # it, # it indicated, and it's great, uh, sport for equalizing the
handicap,

B.68:  # Right.  #

A.69:  # system.  #

B.70:  And,

A.71:  # Allows, #

B.72:  # uh, #

A.73:  you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level,
play competitively with just about anyone, you know,

B.74:  # Right.  #

A.75:  # go # out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas, uh,
if the handicap system, uh, worked properly and it should so,

B.76:  # Yeah.  #

A.77:  # it's # nice to be able to, to, uh, compete and, and be together with
someone and yet have a basis for competitiveness such as, uh, ten cent,
anything over a, a dime I joke on so [laughter].

B.78:  And perha-, and perhaps even learn a little bit,

A.79:  # Oh, yes.  #

B.80:  # of something.  #

A.81:  Oh, yeah. 

B.82:  It's interesting we're talking about golf, the television own in my den
right now and I'm watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole
[laughter], 

A.83:  # [Laughter].  #

B.84:  # in # today's Byron Nelson so. 

A.85:  Well, you know, that's one of the other things I, I'd, I'm am fascinated
sometimes, two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all
the other functions that the human body performs really are, are, uh, as
equally amazing.  But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination
and trying to get a little sphere, uh, four hundred and twenty yards away into
a little whole in about,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # four # shots.  And it's true you have loft of club and everything else
but knowing how far to bring it back and the, the concentration and all the
things that go on in the human body to get it there,

B.88:  Yeah, there's an awful lot of mechanics,

A.89:  # Yeah.  #

B.90:  # involved.  #

A.91:  The same, the same thing is true with basketball where a, a fellows running
along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward,
uh, a hoop and it swishes through but,

B.92:  # Yeah.  #

A.93:  # the, # the human body is amazing and I think I'd like to see, uh,
elements like that in almost everything I do.  And golf, uh, I walk down the
fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then, of course, I'll miss the
putt [laughter].

B.94:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.95:  But,

B.96:  So, Well, what, uh, what course do you get to play on over in North
Carolina?

A.97:  We just moved here from, from Oklahoma as a matter of fact,

B.98:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.99:  # and I'd # been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid.  But,

B.100:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.101:  # so, # uh, I'm used to the wind too. 

B.102:  Yeah. 

A.103:  In fact, that's the onl-, that areas the only place I know of that you
really have to, uh, consider the wind on putts [laughter]. 

B.104:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.105:  Out on the grass, green and,

B.106:  # Yeah.  #

A.107:  # everything # else but the wind effect. 

B.108:  Yeah, but, I guess in North Carolina you, you're in an area where there are
some really,

A.109:  # Oh, I know it,#

B.110:  # nice courses.  #

A.111:  I know.  We had just moved to Charlotte and, uh,

B.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.113:  # I've # gone to a couple of, uh, public courses.  Uh, we haven't settled
in here yet.  We're just here temporarily but,

B.114:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.115:  # uh, # the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on
it too. 

B.116:  Yeah, that's,

A.117:  Now Richardson, maybe you can too. 

B.118:  Yeah, Ri-, Richardson has, it's, you know, it's pretty close to year round.
There are times, uh, well, I guess, that, there are times in the winter, you
know, when you can't play but then there are times when, you know, when it
thaws out and warms up and people flock to the golf course, you know, in
December and January,

A.119:  # Yeah.  #

B.120:  # so.  #

A.121:  Yeah.  In fact, uh, the last few years I've had in Oklahoma, I went to
Norman, and it would play New Year's day down there.  Now ther-, it was
stretching the imagination to enjoy it but [laughter], 

B.122:  [Laughter]. 

A.123:  but at least I played. 

B.124:  Yeah.  Probably a week later it was warm enough you could have gone out and
played and really enjoyed it,

A.125:  # Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  #

B.126:  # even then # so. 

A.127:  Well, I have enjoyed talking to you and,

B.128:  Yeah.  I have enjoyed it too.  I, I really intend to play golf in the
future.  My wife and I even, uh, are going, try to play together,

A.129:  # Yeah.  #

B.130:  # sometime, # you know. 

A.131:  Yeah.  Well, that, that's a good sport when people enjoy it because it can
be very social at the same time. 

B.132:  Right.  Well, it's been nice talking,

A.133:  # And, #

B.134:  # to # you. 

A.135:  good luck,

B.136:  # Okay.  #

A.137:  # on # the course. 

B.138:  Okay.  You,

A.139:  # Bye.  #

B.140:  # too.  # Thanks.
