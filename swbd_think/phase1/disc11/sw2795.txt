============================================================================

A.1:  The basic question is, too much.  And I don't know, my, my opinion, I guess
here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the, uh, tax day.
That's when you, everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes, the rest
of the year is yours.  That represents about a third of your income, and I
don't know, uh, who came up with that figure but I think it really comes out to
be more than the third.  But, uh, I, I don't know, I find myself in a position
sort of like selective approval.  Almost like the United Way campaign where
you agree with most of the agencies but, uh, don't agree with some of them.
And I think that we could have less tax by cutting out some of the, the, uh,
programs that we support.  But overall I guess we're pretty fortunate natured,
((nationed)) as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay.  How do you
feel?

B.2:  Well, I, I've lived overseas, you know, it's wit-, in the Army and I see
what kind of taxes they pay in other countries. 

A.3:  Yeah, I've done some business overseas, in, in Latin America and, of
course, know about the, ((we)) hear about Sweden with their, uh, social
program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Eur-, in Britain and other
nations, much higher tax rates.  But the,

B.4:  It just seems as if, from the time I've been following politics which was,
I guess, about seventy-five, really got interested in politics and keeping up
with it.  It just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just
gotten so out of control,

A.5:  # Oh, yes.  #

B.6:  # and then # they scream about that, that, or the, uh, politicians scream
about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for
themselves every year. 

A.7:  Oh, yes, that, that's the, uh, the type of thing that really irritates me,
where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs
or, or cutbacks or, uh, equating it to a personal income situation.  And yet
it's almost automatic or it's hidden and, uh, I think they need to bite the
same bullet that most individuals do.  The, one of the other problems that I
have recently is centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta,
Georgia to play golf.  And I realize that constant communication is necessary
especially when Bush had his heart rhythm problem this weekend, but we can
always send jets for someone I think if, if they're out of pocket rather than
accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip.  So, that's what I meant
about the selectives, some things I think we're doing extremely wrong could
save a lot of money but other things, uh, like I enjoy seeing money spent on
the Smithsonian Institute, in Washington.  I think it's one of the nicest
national treasures, and I love to see kids of, uh, any background roaming
through and seeing such great collections, but then when, when we talk about
all the foreign aid that we give away, that bothers me a lot.  I don't know
how to solve the problem though wh-, as you said the, uh, bureaucracy gets out
of hand regardless of who you vote for.  The bureaucracy continues too.

B.8:  I, I have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign, I understand
going into countries where they've had natural disasters, and going in and
giving relief aid that way,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # but # paying for their, these countries to run their own governments,

A.11:  # Oh, I think it's way, #

B.12:  # I, I've got a big # hang-up with that. 

A.13:  it's way out of hand.  I'm almost turning into an isolationist [laughter].
Which is not, not a good attitude in, in global, uh, communications and
everything that we have, this, these days, but it's a matter of, uh, I hate to
see money thrown away and that's what I re-, I equate to some of our foreign
aid policies.

B.14:  It just seems like, they keep saying we're helping this country or we're
helping that country out. 

A.15:  And they,

B.16:  Wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at, at home?

A.17:  I agree.  I think that's, I have some problem with social programs at home
in terms of making it too convenient to be on, on welfare. 

B.18:  That's something I would, and that subject in itself, I'd love to see that
entire thing revised. 

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I, I think when you get to a point where it's more
economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job, you've got a basic
concept problem. 

B.20:  Something's got to change. 

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  ((And turn)) drastically. 

A.23:  But I, I think, uh, if we're going to waste money, I'd almost se-, rather
see us waste it at home [laughter],  than overseas too, and that, there's some
unusual things which can occur in the foreign aid, uh, by a stroke of a pen, I
think our president can forgive foreign debt, and that's a lot of power vested
in one, one person in our system of, uh, governance.  And I've seen that happen
over the last few years, and you and I are paying for it.  But ((Jim)) it comes
back a lot to the same thing that you said initially, you've been overseas and
have seen other places and I guess we're still fortunate but I think we're ju-,
I just want us to be smarter than we are. 

B.24:  Well, we've got, it's not like this country doesn't have the people with
the knowledge, we've got it.

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  We've got people that are willing to make change, but as long as you've got
career politicians that spend twenty-five to forty-five years in Washington
playing power broker, they're not going to do anything to t-, tap out the
well.

A.27:  Yeah, well, your, your neighbor to the north, Oklahoma, just voted for
state legislators, uh, one term, no, let's see.  I forget, was it one term or
two term ((fixed)), uh, incumbency.  In other words, ((they)) can't be reel-,
reelected after I think maybe the second term.

B.28:  Now that's something I would love to see happen not only in all the states
but in,

A.29:  # Federal.  #

B.30:  # the # federal legislatures too. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  Two terms, then they got to sit out one. 

A.33:  Yeah, I think it takes away the issue of, of a lot of the, uh, special
lobbyist groups and everything else.  Creating the incumbent, uh,
((invincibl-,)) invincibility but there's another problem with that I'd, we've
got some good ones and I hate to see them leave [laughter].  But it, I guess
it's hard to, to really, uh, identify which are the good and which are the
bad.  The electorate seems to be putting them all back in.

B.34:  And I think,

A.35:  And I thought this last election would be different, but it, it turned out
it really wasn't. 

B.36:  The thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were
elected to do, it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not.  If they
have to sit out a term, fine.  They're going to be able to do things behind
the scenes either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in working within their
party of, of the state or national level,

A.37:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.38:  # to # get things enacted.  That's not going to slow them down at all. 

A.39:  Uh, it doesn't solve the ((nonelected)) bureauc-, bureaucrats either.
That's, that's an issue I think that really fits into it because there are a
lot of people that sit in the same position and really don't give a hoot who
gets elected.  They still kind of run the show and, and setup all the
roadblocks and the, the, uh, horrendous regulations and everything else.  But
it's, uh, it's our system, I think, now, we have to figure out how to really
manage it well.

B.40:  I think compared to the other systems that are out there, without a doubt
we've got probably the best system it just needs,

A.41:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.42:  # some # fine tuning. 

A.43:  Uh-huh, I think that's right.  Well,

B.44:  Well, the question is wh-, who's ready to put their hand on the first
wrench and tighten the first bolt.

A.45:  Yeah.  How do you feel about the information we get, uh, from Congress
that, that affects us as far as the, uh, knowledge to, to elect the right
people? I have, I have a real problem, federal register, for instance, uh, you
can have almost put anything in there you want to.  No, it's not in the
federal register, what's the, uh, the congressional record.  Uh, someone can
put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something
or, uh,

B.46:  Trying to get, the, um, politicians to actually truthfully report what they
did vote for what they didn't vote for, when they were actually on the floor at
their desk is almost, is going to be impossible to do. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  There is no accountability of them. 

A.49:  And,

B.50:  At any given time, if you've been to Washington,
