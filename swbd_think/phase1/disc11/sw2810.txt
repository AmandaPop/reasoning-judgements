=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, the, one of the things that I've heard, uh, many people complain
about the school systems was that,

B.2:  [Bird_squawk]. 

A.3:  they didn't feel like, uh, people were dedicated to teaching their
children,

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  or their heart really wasn't in it, 

B.6:  [Bird_squawk].

A.7:  you know, so what, they went and got a degree and, and everything but it
wasn't, their not doing it just because they want to.

B.8:  [Bird_squawk] Are you saying the teachers or the parents?

A.9:  The teachers, 

B.10:  Uh-huh [bird_squawk].

A.11:  the teachers, you know.  We-, how do you feel about that?

B.12:  Well I guess I have mixed emotions, on one hand, I think golly the pay
isn't good enough, if you didn't really want to do it, [breathing], 

A.13:  Yeah, you shouldn't be doing.

B.14:  there's probably something else out there.  But on the other hand I
think that maybe some people have thought that was kind of an easy way out.
You can major in something basically useless to the world as a whole like
say Spanish or geography, 

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  geography being one of my favorite subjects, 

A.17:  Oh really.

B.18:  but nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's going to make you
bucks.

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  But you could then go ahead and get a teaching certificate and perhaps
feed your family a little, uh,

A.21:  Yeah.  What do you think about the, the recent bill that was just passed,
you know, where they're taking the money from especially, th-, the Dallas
area scho-,

B.22:  You're calling from Texas then?

A.23:  Oh, oh yeah, I'm in Dallas, Texas. 

B.24:  I'm in Plano [swallowing].

A.25:  Okay, yeah, they're taking, uh,  the money from our schools here and
distribute it, uh, some of the other outlying and, and,

B.26:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.27:  especially like west Texas.  What,  what do you think about that, because
it's, it's, you know, the money's coming from us here, that live here and work
here and,

B.28:  Well, I have always believed in sharing.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  You know, if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to
eat or something to wear, I'd be glad to share, 

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  and so I guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling
to a certain extent, but I also don't believe that people who get funds or
equipment, [bird_squawk] or anything without some of their own personal input,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  take care of it nicely, 

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  or appreciate it, or use it properly, um, those things have to be taught.

A.37:  [Sneezing] excuse me.

B.38:  So.

A.39:  Yeah, I agree, you know, [sniffing].

B.40:  You know, so there's that end of it too an, an I think it's going to
really, [sigh], you know, so I don't, I don't say that in a selfish way
because I think, there, that it's probably not totally equitable.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  [Sigh] And I don't know that there is a good situation entirely, but
golly, it sure going to make a big difference in our school system
[bird_squawk].

A.43:  Yeah, it is.  

B.44:  You know, it, uh, I was,

A.45:  Plano, yeah [sniffing].

B.46:  uh-huh, I was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents
advisory council with the Irving Independent School District and she was
saying they are number one, they are adding, next year they are adding thirty
minutes to their school day,

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  [Bird_squawk] in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to
be needed because they're eliminating all aids.  They're going to th-,

A.49:  Oh, really.

B.50:  all aids, all paid aids.  Everything is going to have to be volunteer,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  through the parent teacher organizations.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And frankly, we're all ready maxed out,

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  with parent, you know, uh, volunteer [breathing] work.  I work part-time,
out of my home,

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  and they y-, you know, I'm always getting called and you know, 

A.59:  [Sneezing].

B.60:  and used, utilized, you know what I'm willing to do it, but,

A.61:  Yeah, yeah [sniffing].

B.62:  I know during the days when I was, uh, just not a working mom at all, it
was ridiculous.

A.63:  They call you all the time.

B.64:  Uh, yeah, yeah, until I just finally had to say, I am so sorry that, you
know, just cannot do everything for you.

A.65:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.66:  But, uh,

A.67:  I agree.

B.68:  you know, so there's and, and the moms that work, a lot of times just
can't help at all and, yeah.

A.69:  Right, well, I, I, I believe that the school puts a big demand on the s-,
on the teachers and the students for, for the fact that they expect the
parents to go out [sniffing] and, a lot of times chauffeur or, lot of times,
you know, buy a lot of things that might seem unnecessary but,

B.70:  [Bird_squawk].

A.71:  i-, it's unreal on the cost of sending a kid to school,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  because of, you know, you spend your time,

B.74:  [Bird_squawk].

A.75:  voluntary and plus you buy a lot of extra arts, crafts aids, things like
that.

B.76:  So many, yes, 

A.77:  #notebooks for reports.#

B.78:  #well and just you know, the yearbook# and the t-shirt,

A.79:  Right [sniffing].

B.80:  and the teachers presents and the, you know.  It really starts, 

A.81:  Projects.

B.82:  you know we have five children so I know that it really, you know.

A.83:  Oh my goodness, so you really do.  Yeah like, uh, all types of projects,

B.84:  [Bird_squawk] [talking].

A.85:  little bug things, you know that [sniffing].

B.86:  Uh-huh, I just helped a little girl yesterday, a teenager friend of ours,
she had to prepare something for, to study Greece,

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  and they were, I think she needed a recipe and the history of, of the
recipe or the type of food, and also, um, had to actually make it and bring
it, enough to serve, you know, fifteen people.  

A.89:  Oh my gosh.

B.90:  And I found the cheapest thing I could find that I could help her with
and even so, figuring it up, I think she spent close to twenty dollars.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  Um, and it was (( )) you know, we did a couple of different ones and it
was the least expensive.  And, [throat_clearing] and still be able to fix it at
home and tote it up there and what not, so.

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  But that's, 

A.95:  That's amazing because, 

B.96:  Yeah, it's a lot of money.

A.97:  i-, if every child does that, what are they going to do with all that.

B.98:  Yeah, and would they really eat it.  

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  Of course that's not really, you know, the quality of education.  

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  But, [sigh] you know, I think that probably, you know, here in Plano we
are, uh, of course state legislature, you know, added, uh, five days next
year.

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  And, uh, I think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very
soon.  I, I'm still basically against it, although I, I  do understand the
positives that are,  

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  you know, touted, but, I think overall, 

A.107:  How do you feel about the Plano school system?  You feel like it's pretty
good compared to the others around, you know, Richardson and Allen and,

B.108: There is a quality of excellence expected here.  It's very
difficult, [talking] for the children in this school district to excel
in more than one area,

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  because if you get into drama, if you get into speech, if you get into
drill team, or athletics, or whatever it is, I mean, they want you night and
day.

A.111:  Oh, really.

B.112:  They want your time, they want your blood, you know, so.

A.113:  Yeah, money an,

B.114:  And, uh, you know, I have children who have been fortunate enough to be
in, in these extra curricular things, but golly, you know,

A.115:  Real demanding [sniffing].

B.116:  it's just really, you know, it's like a smaller school system, you know
you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too, and you could
be, you know, on the football team and still be on the basketball team {said
in a sing song voice}.

A.117:  Basketball.

B.118:  and still try out for band, you know [noise] {sounds like snapping 
fingers}.

A.119:  Right, yeah, that's amazing.

B.120:  So, you know that, and you, 

A.121:  That's, uh,

B.122:  you can't do that in this school system, so.  

A.123:  #that's a big difference.#

B.124:  #You know we've been working# on college stuff for my oldest daughter and,
shoot, 

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  you know, that, uh, you know, you kind of, you know, you have to, to look
[sigh], when we were writing things down I said, you know, you can't really
talk about all your individual things but, you know, you've got to make sure
that when you put down band here that it's not just any old band, that this is
a band that took this honor and that honor and participated in this
competition and participated in that competition.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  So they understand, really.

A.129:  Right, right, [sniffing] that's wild.  Well, it's been good talking to you.

B.130:  Well yeah, this is, uh, this is interesting, interesting topic.

A.131:  [Laughter] Thank you. #Uh, good night, bye-bye.#

B.132:  #Thank you Jackie, have a good day.  Bye-bye.#
