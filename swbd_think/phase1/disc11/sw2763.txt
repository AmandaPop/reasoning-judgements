@A.1:  Okay, Nancy.  What do you think about drug testing?

B.2:  I'm all for it. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Because I [noise],  I think if you don't do it, you don't have anything to
worry about it. 

A.5:  All right. 

B.6:  And, I don't do drugs, so [laughter] I never worry about it.  And I, I
think it's a, I think it's a good idea.  I, I even think the random is fine,
you know.  You shouldn't do it and that's [laughter] ((an)) egg in a nutshell.

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  And I think, you know, like I say, if you, if you don't do it, you r-,
really don't have to worry it. 

A.9:  Yeah.  Do you feel that, see, I don't know what questions to ask because
I'm, I agree with you.  And I was hoping to find someone that,

B.10:  # [Laughter]  That disagrees.# 

A.11:  # disagreed, #

B.12:  Right [laughter]. 

A.13:  so I could, so, I, I could fire questions at them. 

B.14:  Yeah [laughter].  Right. 

A.15:  But,

B.16:  Well, I, ((y-, y-,)) just, uh, like I say, I just think it's a, a fine
idea.  And I, the companies that I've heard that had a random testing, I (( ))
think it's a great idea.  Uh, where I work they don't do random testing.  And,
uh, now when I hired in, I had to have a, uh, a drug test, which was fine with
me.  I, I wasn't worried at all about that. 

A.17:  Right. 

B.18:  [Throat_clearing]  But, and then I think that's perfectly, I don't think
it's infringing on your rights or, I think the company has a right to have
employees that are drug free. 

A.19:  What do you think company should do if they find someone that tests
positive?

B.20:  Well, I guess I'd give them, I'd give them one chance maybe.  I don't know.
Perso-, I'd f-, if it was my company, I'd fire them right then.  But, n-, you
know, in today's society you can't do that.  Yeah, I guess you, guess, have to
give them a, a warning and then, then the second time they'd be terminated
[noise] if they tested positive.  And I really would watch them after that,
but, uh,

A.21:  Would you help them get into a drug,

B.22:  # E A-, #

A.23:  # rehab program # or,

B.24:  I'd probably send them on a E A T program, you know, Employee Assistance
Program.  I'd, I'd make them go through that.  And, uh, the first time, they'd
have to go through the E A T program.  And I think most companies have those
[throat_clearing] now.  I think they have (( )), it must be a law or
something, because an awful lot of companies have them.  And I'd make them do
that.

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  And, if they refused to do that, then they'd be fired, is the way I'd do
it.  What would you do?

A.27:  Uh, probably about the same thing.  Just, uh, give them a chan-, you know,
with w-, a positive, have them sit down with their boss and their boss's boss
and, uh, you know, just talk with them about what happened, what the problem
was, [breathing]  po-, there's a possibility that, uh, you know, you've got to
give somebody a benefit of the doubt because everybody would probably say, Oh,
well, that's just, you know, I just tried it once to see,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # what # it'd be like. 

B.30:  Or, maybe, It's a, my antihistamine I was on then p-, t-, you know, m-,
tested positive.  I, I don't do it.  You know, you never know if they're
telling the truth or not.

A.31:  Yeah.  So, you pretty much got to give everybody [noise] one,

B.32:  # Second, #

A.33:  # shot.  #

B.34:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.35:  And then after [noise]  that, you might want to, [/noise]  and, and if they
admit to having a problem or something, you know, I would,

B.36:  # Yeah.  #

A.37:  # help # them out as, as long as they wanted help and would stay in the
program I'd, you know,

B.38:  # Right.  #

A.39:  # help # them out. 

B.40:  Right.  But, if they flat refused, you know, and said, No, I won't.  Then
I'd say, Well then I'm sorry, then you can't say. 

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  We're not going to have druggies in our payroll --

A.43:  Right. 

B.44:  -- is the way I'd look at it [noise].  Fortunately I've never had to worry
about that since I, I have never even tried, uh, a puff or whatever it, uh, you
know, and if somebody gave me a thousand dollars and said, Nancy, go by some
do-, I wouldn't even know where to go buy it. 

A.45:  Yeah. 

B.46:  I'm sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me, but
I don't know.

A.47:  What if, along a similar topic, straying from the drug thing, what about,
what do you think about AIDS testing for, uh, say you're a physician and, uh, a
patient comes in and wants treated, should you have the right to test them for
AIDS?

B.48:  Uh, [lipsmack]  I c-, if he suspected, sure.  I w-, because if I was a
physician, I wouldn't want to test them, I mean, I wouldn't want to treat them
--

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  -- for fear that they would, you know, I, I'd get that, but I think if, if
you suspect it, and I'm sure a doctor can look at somebody and suspect, don't
you think, by looking at them?

A.51:  In advanced cases, yes. 

B.52:  Yeah, not, probably not at the first. 

A.53:  Right. 

B.54:  I don't know.  I don't know if you, if they have the right or not.  I n-,
had never really thought of that. 

A.55:  See, that's a question I'm wondering because I'm pursuing a career in
medicine. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  And, you know, they're deciding that in the courts, you know, as I'm
continuing my education. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  So, it w-, you know, by the time I get out and begin practicing, then, I
don't know, you, you n-, or it could be either way. 

B.60:  Y-, right. 

A.61:  I would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS.  I mean, I'm n-,

B.62:  W-, I would, too.  Absolutely. 

A.63:  but,

B.64:  Absolutely. 

A.65:  and,

B.66:  I just don't, uh, and I would, if I were a doctor, I wouldn't, I don't
think it's (( )) wrong for a doctor to refuse to, I don't want to care about
((give)) medical, I don't think they should have to treat a patient with AIDS
if they don't want to.  You know, why take a chance? Like that doctor in New
York that got infected from a patient and, you know, she ended up, I think,
she died, ((I don't remember)) if she died or not, but she's suing that
hospital because, uh, she was working w-, o-, with a AIDS patient that got
them.  So,

A.67:  That's,

B.68:  I, I don't know.  I don't think I would treat one. 

A.69:  it's such a tough issue.  I, I just wanted to throw that out to you to make
the conversation a little more interesting because,

B.70:  [Laughter]. 

A.71:  since we both agree, it's kind of hard to,

B.72:  Yeah.  Totally boring [laughter].  Mother [laughter]. 

A.73:  [Laughter]. 

B.74:  Oh, me.  Well, uh, no, I, like I say, I've only been tested the one time
when I hired in, uh, I ha-, was tested for drugs.  And, of course, they do
everybody.  You can't work where I work unless you're tested for it and so
that, you know, and that was fine with me.

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  But they make you do all the sealing, you know, you, you have to do
everything yourself.  They're not allowed to seal them or tag them or
anything.  You, you do it all yourself.  They tell you what to do, but you
have to do it all yourself.

A.77:  Huh. 

B.78:  So if there is a mistake it's your mistake, I guess. 

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  I don't know. 

A.81:  Uh, you work for T I?

B.82:  No.  I did years ago for seventeen years.  I worked, uh, in Fort Worth at
a, a landing gear company.

A.83:  Oh. 

B.84:  Menasco. 

A.85:  Oh. 

B.86:  [Throat_clearing]  And, uh, love it.  Just love it.  I wish I'd found this
company twenty years ago. 

A.87:  Oh. 

B.88:  So, I started out at T I years ago.  My daughter works at T I. 

A.89:  Is that how you got on the,

B.90:  # Yeah.  #

A.91:  # phone # program?

B.92:  Because she was on it and she, how did you get on it?

A.93:  My wife works for T I. 

B.94:  Oh, does she?

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  Yeah.  I liked T I.  I loved it.  I qu-, quit back in eighty-five, uh, and
went with Mark Marietta down in Orlando.  And just [breathing]  hated Or-,
Orlando.  Just, oh, yeah.  Just hated it.  Couldn't wait to get back.  And, it
took me about almost four years to get back, but I made it. 

A.97:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.98:  And, [laughter]  but I've almost doubled my salary since leaving T I.  Now
that's how bad T I pays.  I,

A.99:  # Yeah.  Wow.  #

B.100:  # have almost # doubled my salary.  I really have.  And I, uh, but I love T
I.  I w-, I really enjoyed working there.  And, uh, but, you know, it wasn't to
be anymore. 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  [Breathing] Had to move on [noise].  But, uh, t-, you know, tha-, I know
they do the random testing at T I.  And, I, well, I, I don't see anything
wrong with that.  If, you know, if they, I don't even know, they don't even
have to do it on suspicion.  They c-, they can just do it.

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  And, uh, and they do it quite often I understand.  And, I don't blame them
at all. 

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  Their company and you're a danger to people if you're on drugs.  And I
think you're a danger to, to people that you work wi-, and th, they have too
much sophisticated equipment out there f-, to have somebody out, you know,
doped up working around it, I think.

A.107:  Right. 

B.108:  So, uh, and I understand that they, even if, even if you see somebody off,
you know, away from work using drugs --

A.109:  Uh-huh. 

B.110:  -- that you can come back and, and rat on them, and they'll get them that
way.  If you see them at a party t-, you know, doing dope, you can go back to
work and tell on them. 

A.111:  Huh. 

B.112:  Is what I've un-, I've heard. 

A.113:  Well, it's pretty serious. 

B.114:  Yeah.  It is.  There's, they're cracking down on them.  But, uh, that's
good.  You know, somebody needs to get tough on these guys.  And, you know, and
they take them to court and then they just slap them on the hand and let them,
the dealers out and, you know, I just, makes me sick.  I, [throat_clearing] 
that's why we have so much crime.  I know it's because of dope. 

A.115:  Yeah.  A lot of it is.  That's,

B.116:  I know #when I,#

A.117:  # for sure.  #

B.118:  was growing up, you could sleep with your windows open.  Well, even my kids
were growing up, we didn't lock our house at night.  We just went to bed, you
know, and left the doors open, the windows open, you could w-, take walks at
night.  You can't do that anymore.

A.119:  That's right. 

B.120:  And I think most of it's drug related, most of the crime that we have is
drug related.  And, uh, [breathing]  I, I don't, I don't think my children have
ever, if they did I didn't know it. 

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  But I know they've never been on it, if they ever tried it I didn't know
it.  And, because my son was a athlete and athletes normally can't, don't do it
because they're, you know, they have to stay in shape. 

A.123:  Right. 

B.124:  My daught-, [throat_clearing]  my daughter just wasn't the type.  She just
didn't care for stuff like that.  And neither one of them smoked cigarettes
either.  So that's,

A.125:  Well, that's good. 

B.126:  Yeah.  I, really is.  I did when they were growing up and I th-, that's why
they don't because I did. 

A.127:  [Breathing]. 

B.128:  [Breathing]  And I quit about ten years ago.  And it's the smartest thing I
ever did. 

A.129:  Yeah.  Good. 

B.130:  Took shots from a doctor in Richardson. 

A.131:  Huh. 

B.132:  And haven't had a s-, puff since.  She gave shots in the nose and in the
ears,

A.133:  # [Breathing].  #

B.134:  # and # ((in the arm)). Six shots.  And that's it.  Never smoked again. 

A.135:  Wow. 

B.136:  So,

A.137:  Well, that's good. 

B.138:  Yeah [lipsmack].  I'm real proud of myself. 

A.139:  Well, Nancy, it's been good talking to you. 

B.140:  Good, nice talking to you.  ((If I can will)), ((um)), good luck on it
[breathing]. 

A.141:  Well, thank you.  And, uh, I guess I'll brace myself for a heavy storm,

B.142:  # Oh, you, #

A.143:  # coming my # way. 

B.144:  you please do. 

A.145:  All righty. 

B.146:  Talk to you.  Bye-bye. 

A.147:  Bye-bye.
