========================================================================

B.1:  Women?

A.2:  Yeah, the changing roles of women, how roles changed and what do you see
coming in the future. 

B.3:  Oh, okay, that's not a broad enough topic [laughter]. 

A.4:  Okay, yeah.  Sounds good. 

B.5:  I'm ready when you are. 

A.6:  Okay, hold on. 

B.7:  Okay. 

A.8:  [Clicking]  Are you there?

B.9:  Yeah, I'm here. 

A.10:  Oh my goodness, I can't believe I did that.  Okay, hold on. 

B.11:  That's okay. 

@A.12:  [Beep]  Okay, um, I. 

B.13:  Okay, um, I don't know, are you in your thirties, or,

A.14:  No, I, I'm twenty-three. 

B.15:  Oh, okay. 

A.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.17:  # Well # then I can tell you that roles have changed.  I'm thirty-eight
[laughter], 

A.18:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.19:  # and they # changed quite a bit. 

A.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.21:  # Um, # I, this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago. 

A.22:  Uh-huh. 

B.23:  And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know, you probably heard that
in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.

A.24:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.25:  That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early
seventies. 

A.26:  Right. 

B.27:  It was sort of just to um, go protest,

A.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.29:  # and, # uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one, and, you
know,

A.30:  # Uh-huh, I know that, th-, #

B.31:  # soci-, social morals were a # little bit lacking. 

A.32:  Uh-huh, I know that, uh, in, in the early seventies, uh, I think women
were the first people to, to make a move as far as individuals. 

B.33:  Uh-huh. 

A.34:  Um, uh, before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large
groups like, uh, black people, or, you know, just large, large groups of
people, but, but the,

B.35:  Right it was more, it was more civil rights oriented,

A.36:  Right,

B.37:  or race oriented rather than gender based, yeah. 

A.38:  and I think, I think the women's movement kind of brought in individual
lives where you had women's movements and you had gay movements,

B.39:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.40:  # and # just the smaller groups of people. 

B.41:  # It did.  #

A.42:  # And I # think since then is, is when a lot of the women's roles have
started to change. 

B.43:  It did and some of the other stuff that, um, I think that changed it, you,
uh, when I first got out of college fifteen years ago, they were always saying
well, if you, if you were assertive you were a libber, or you were aggressive
not assertive and independent. 

A.44:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.45:  # And # in terms of the corporate community, I've seen a big change in
terms of men finally being quote, unquote, used to women,

A.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.47:  # who # are in, uh, controlling positions,

A.48:  # Exactly.  #

B.49:  # as # higher, you know, corporate, in the corporate hierarchy. 

A.50:  # Uh-huh [breathing].  #

B.51:  # So I # think that's good. 

A.52:  I think that, uh, you know, you can just look at home life and see, I've
been talking to a lot of people a-, about education and things,

B.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.54:  # and, # and what, what, what affects the school system and I think that a
big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore,

B.55:  # Right.  #

A.56:  # um, # like she used to be.  She used to be kind of a, kind of a, a rock,
you know,

B.57:  # The mainstay, yeah.  #

A.58:  # in the house, # yeah.  And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and
working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,

B.59:  # and restructuring, stepfamilies, yeah.  #

A.60:  # uh, the mother's not # there anymore and the children are, I think, I
think a lot of society is suffering.  Not to say that women shouldn't, you
know, go out and do what they want to do but I think that, um,

B.61:  # Right.  #

A.62:  # society's # really going to have to get used to it.  And they're not
quite used to it yet and that's I,

B.63:  The schools or the mo-, the schools or the parents, yeah. 

A.64:  Yes, uh-huh. 

B.65:  Um, I'm trying to think of what else.  I have a lot of opinions on this
except all of a sudden I went blank [laughter]. 

A.66:  [Laughter]. 

B.67:  A lot of the things, um, the demographics do, I mean, there are more, I
don't have the numbers in my head right now, but, a lot of the things that
brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics,
just generally,

A.68:  # Right, uh-huh.  #

B.69:  # in the # United States, in terms of being,

A.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.71:  # I # mean, I'm the typical baby boomer, I hate that term,

A.72:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.73:  # but in # terms of women,

A.74:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

B.75:  # [Laughter]  women # going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that. 

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today, I mean, when I was
twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married,

A.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.79:  # um, # those were the general issues. 

A.80:  Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on
the project,

B.81:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.82:  # and, # uh, uh, we were talking about child care and he asked me if I had
any kids.  He was about forty or fifty years old and I said no, I'm just
twenty,

B.83:  # He was ancient, yeah.  #

A.84:  # and I said no, # I'm just twenty-three,

B.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.86:  # you # know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children
but h-, the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your
life.  And I just, I, my, my mind just went,

B.87:  You didn't know what you're going to be missing. 

A.88:  I went, what. 

B.89:  [Laughter].

A.90:  You know, because it d-, it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me
right now to have children, becau-,

B.91:  I don't have any either and I've been a married for eleven years, so. 

A.92:  Yeah, and I, it just, you know, I think that I'll probably have children
when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like,

B.93:  # Yeah, when it's time, uh-huh.  #

A.94:  # just because, I'm not sure # if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women
in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my
career.  I'm trying to go somewhere, and,

B.95:  # Yeah, you want to establish, #

A.96:  # and get there quick and # then worry about, you know, because right now,
in my career I'm, I'm really starting out, and it's going to take me a while to
move up. 

B.97:  # Uh-huh, #

A.98:  # And # I don't need anything kind of holding me back, um. 

B.99:  Right and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed
in terms of,

A.100:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.101:  # um, # women don't feel like they need to get married anymore. 

A.102:  # Right, uh-huh.  #

B.103:  # I was # twenty-seven when I got married and I just at the time, um, my
husband actually even jokes about it. 

A.104:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.105:  # He # was twenty-three when we met an I was at a point where it was like,
I didn't date, e-, I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time,

A.106:  # Right.  #

B.107:  # but # I didn't have to have male companionship. 

A.108:  Right, right. 

B.109:  Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who
had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs,

A.110:  Uh-huh. 

B.111:  um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad.  But
then by the time I got married, um,

A.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.113:  # it # seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage
track. 

A.114:  Yeah, yeah,

B.115:  So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that
women feel like they need to have, the dependency,

A.116:  # Yeah, yeah, #

B.117:  # their self-identity # is stronger. 

A.118:  it's, it's just really not there anymore. 

B.119:  # Yeah.  #

A.120:  # And # that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and
other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,

B.121:  # Right.  #

A.122:  # out # in the corporate world. 

B.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.124:  # That's # like, oh, I can do that.  You know, maybe,

B.125:  Right, and I, I, I mean, #I don't know how,#

A.126:  # I don't need to get married.  #

B.127:  how old your mom is, she's probably, let's see my mother's in her early
sixties, so. 

A.128:  # She's, she's about forty.  #

B.129:  # Okay, [laughter]  I'm thirty-eight, # your mother's for-, [laughter]  I
just turned thirty-eight. 

A.130:  # [Laughter].  #

B.131:  # Um, # [laughter]  yes I'm laughing, oh my God.  It does start to creep
up. 

A.132:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.133:  # No, # um, but it's okay, don't ever let age, I mean, I don't thi-,

A.134:  # Okay.  #

B.135:  # nobody # talks about it for women except other women and other men. 

A.136:  I, I just turned twenty-three, uh,

B.137:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.138:  # April # twentieth, and I'm still going, you know, oh my God, I'm s-,
getting so old.  I just, because me, myself, I just like to move really, really
quickly. 

B.139:  # Yeah, an, #

A.140:  # I like # to, anything I do, I got out of school quick.  I'm, you know,

B.141:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.142:  # I'm # working quick.  I want to move up quick.  I want to make money
quick.  I want to retire quick. 

B.143:  # Yeah.  #

A.144:  # And # so anything, i-, i-, when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three
and twenty-four,

B.145:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.146:  # I'm # thinking my time is running out.  You know, but I'm actually very,
very young. 

B.147:  Yeah, you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is,
my background is in journalism and corporate communications,

A.148:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.149:  # and # what you'll find is, I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where,
I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner,

A.150:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.151:  # but # this is probably typical of the women's movement too,

A.152:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.153:  # is # the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want
to go back to school.  I'm seriously considering going back to school for law. 

A.154:  # Um.  #

B.155:  # Um, # which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a
((subway)),

A.156:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.157:  # but # it's still is a different application.  And I mean, if you think
about it, you know, I c-, I still can have another career.  I mean I've worked
for over fifteen years in what I've done. 

A.158:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.159:  # And I # mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably
one thing that your generation coming up after mine,

A.160:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.161:  # is # thinking that, um, they have to do everyth-, you know, sort of,

A.162:  # Right.  #

B.163:  # I # call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome.  They have to eat real
fast they have,

A.164:  # Uh-huh, exactly.  #

B.165:  # they have # to, rapidity of speech, they have to just go through
everything. 

A.166:  # Exactly.  #

B.167:  # And # you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if
you haven't slowed down,

A.168:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.169:  # something # will slow you down.  Do you know what I'm saying?

A.170:  Yeah, yeah,

B.171:  Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling
the roses, and I know that sounds trite,

A.172:  # Yeah, #

B.173:  # and # all that. 

A.174:  I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way, I know,
I'm probably feeling that way because it's, [breathing]  everything's geared
towards young. 

B.175:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.176:  # You # know and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on
television is young,

B.177:  # Oh it is.  #

A.178:  # young, young, young.  # You can't be a model after thirty, you can't do
this after twenty, you know and,

B.179:  # That's right.  #

A.180:  # e-, y-, # everybody that's in the music business is starting out at
fifteen. 

B.181:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.182:  # You # know, and so I feel like I'm old.  It's like I sing,

B.183:  # [Laughter].  #

A.184:  # I # sing and I would really love to become,

B.185:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.186:  # uh, # a professional singer, but I think I'm too old now,

B.187:  # Oh, you're not, no.# 

A.188:  # and I'm twenty-three, #

B.189:  # No.  #

A.190:  # because # everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen. 

B.191:  # That's true I mean, it's, it's, #

A.192:  # You know, and so I'm going, # I'm so old and I'm, I, I really have to
always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young. 

B.193:  # No, you're extremely, yeah, it's, it's ju-,#

A.194:  # And, you know, so it's, #

B.195:  Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption
and I have friends that say well why would you do that,

A.196:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.197:  # if # you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know,

A.198:  Uh-huh. 

B.199:  why would you do that now, at this part, point, and, um, it's just
individual choices. 

A.200:  # Yeah.  #

B.201:  # I # stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um, in
my family my brother's children,

A.202:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.203:  # I # mean, he just turned forty, his children will be out of high school
before he's forty-five. 

A.204:  Wow. 

B.205:  Um, I mean that's like your mother, look how young she is,

A.206:  # Uh-huh, yeah.  #

B.207:  # compared to # where you are out of school and everything. 

A.208:  # Right.  #

B.209:  # It's # just, it, but what you find is you don't compare the woman,
because you just get into trouble.  It's all independent and choices.

A.210:  Uh-huh, yeah, very true. 

B.211:  Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably
just won't say it, but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying,
uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,

A.212:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.213:  # you # girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these
choices, you know, you went to school,

A.214:  # Right, uh-huh.  #

B.215:  # you can # do this, you can do that,

A.216:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.217:  # we # couldn't do that then.  And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't
you [laughter]. 

A.218:  Yeah, that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, b-,
because I'm not married and because I don't have children.  I'm out of school,
I'm twenty-three, I can do anything I want to do, anything. 

B.219:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.220:  # And # so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now, but, and
I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't
figure out what I want to do. 

B.221:  And that's normal, I mean,

A.222:  # And yeah, #

B.223:  # I think # that's the world today. 

A.224:  and I thi-, and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit
there and go gee, I don't know what to do.  I have so mu-,

B.225:  # Right that's exa-, #

A.226:  # you know, not # a lot of people,

B.227:  # Yeah.  #

A.228:  # but # it's depressing too. 

B.229:  # That's how, I mean, #

@@A.230:  # What do you, what # do you that you're,

B.231:  What, I'm right now. 

A.232:  Uh-huh. 

B.233:  I'm, I'm a free-lance writer right now. 

A.234:  # Oh.  #

B.235:  # And # then, um, what I'm doing is working at, um, a electroni-, an
electronics company,

A.236:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.237:  # for # their company newspaper,

A.238:  # Oh.  #

B.239:  # right # now on the side, and then I'm also, actually, I'm excited,
tomorrow I have a, uh, ((luncheon)) appointment with a perspective client to
do,

A.240:  # Huh.  #

B.241:  # uh, # marketing communications for them. 

A.242:  Huh, okay, I'm a, I'm a news reporter, now,

B.243:  # Oh you are? #

A.244:  # and what I'm # looking for is something in, I really don't want to stay
in news, but I would like to stay in journalism,

B.245:  # We-, #

A.246:  # and # I've been looking for something exactly like that jus-,

B.247:  Here's what you shoul-, d-, this is off the topic, and those people
probably won-, [laughter].

A.248:  # Uh-huh, okay [laughter].  #

B.249:  # Did you go # to Baylor by any chance?

A.250:  No, I don-, I went to U T at Austin. 

B.251:  # Oh, okay, that's even better.  #

A.252:  # And I, I just happen # to work at a Waco station, because you know. 

B.253:  I went to, or you in radio, or television or news.
