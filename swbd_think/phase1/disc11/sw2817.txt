@A.1:  Okay, Amy, uh, what do you think about taking care of the elderly?

B.2:  Well, I certainly, um, can appreciate the patience and the, you know,
energy and money and time and effort it would require for someone to, you
know, take care of their elderly parent or whatever in their home.

A.3:  Huh-uh. 

B.4:  I think that, you know, would definitely be preferable if the person is,
you know, able to do that.  I think sometimes people take on, I know I have
one friend who is taken on more than she can handle.  You know, with her, her
mom needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with
that, you know, is really difficult, but, I know, it's hard not to feel
guilty,

A.5:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.6:  # You # know, to put somebody in a nursing home.  I, if, I suppose if you
could find a nursing home that you thought really comfortable, you know, that
they were getting adequate care, but I think that's probably pretty hard to do
at times. 

A.7:  Huh-uh. 

B.8:  I've not ever been put in this position.  I personally would have a real
hard time taking care of my father [laughter].  He's getting up there, but he's
very difficult to live with and I think that would be a real consideration in,
in, um, entering him into our family unit here.  You know,

A.9:  # Yeah.  #

B.10:  # so # there's a lot of factors involved. 

A.11:  What is the point at which you would go from home care to institutional
care?

B.12:  Well, I think I would in some ways have to decide how much personally, you
know, I was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect the rest of
my family, because I have two small children. 

A.13:  Huh-uh. 

B.14:  And, um, we don't have a real large house.  If you had a lot of money and
you were able to, you know, have like a little separate wing or something where
I wouldn't have to constantly be having my children, you know, be quiet and go
away and that kind of thing,

A.15:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.16:  # to # accommodate an elderly person.  I think, you know, just the medical
aspects, too, would be a big question.  How much, um, it would require, you
know, in terms of nursing care at home, and I know, that there is often times,
insurance companies won't even pay anything to the families for doing things. 
If they were in, a nursing home would cost, you know, a hundred times more. 

A.17:  Huh-uh. 

B.18:  So that's a consideration too, but, I don't know, it would be a really
rough choice to make.  Depending on the parent and their personality and, you
know, your own family and what's going on with.  I'm home all day anyway right
now with young kids, but if I was working full-time and had to give up a
career,

A.19:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.20:  # that # would be another, you know, problem too.  But, um, the only people
I've seen is, my husband's grandmother has been in a nursing home for several
years, I know, that, uh, there's been a lot of questions from other family
members as to whether she's getting enough attention, and whether they just
kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while.  It, it's really
tragic to go in those places.

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  So.  So. 

A.23:  What would you look for in an institution?

B.24:  Um, I think I would, uh, look for a place that definitely had the physical
attributes and it wasn't a sterile kind of environment, but had a comfortable
feeling to it,

A.25:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.26:  # that # respected, uh, that you seem to see some respect for peoples
privacy and the attitude that the staff would have towards the patients.  I, I
was visiting a friend in the hospital and there was a nurse screaming at an
older man.  That was a head injury unit and he had apparently wet his pants
and they had a blanket draped over him and the blanket had either fallen to
the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming
at him about how obscene that was or something [laughter].  And I just
thought, gosh, if I walked into a place and I saw a staff member just berating
or humiliating a patient, I'd definitely, that would be something I'd really
want to be on the look out for.

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  Um, I would hope they would have some consistent staff.  I know they don't
pay that much in a lot of those places and so there's probably a lot of
turnover.  That would be another thing that would be, you know, something to be
important.  Because I think it's confusing, particularly if people are in some
state of mental, you know, confusion, anyway to have constant new people on
staff, and having to develop new relationships and,

A.29:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.30:  # Oh, # I don't know what else, other than, that maybe some place that had
activities, you know, that they could participate in instead of just kind of
sitting there watching the wall [laughter] or something, you know,

A.31:  # Right.  #

B.32:  # talking # to other people who had family members there.  See how
responsive the staff was to the things I brought up, you know, that I thought
were important for my family member.  It would really be hard because when we
go to visit I'm sure places have, you know, their best foot forward kind of
thing.

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  Unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on
behind the scenes, it would really be hard to know.  It's kind of similar in
away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for
your kids. 

A.35:  Huh-uh. 

B.36:  You know.  So, uh, I'm sure if you have enough money you can find just
super care.

A.37:  Right. 

B.38:  But, you know, the cost of it is probably just horrendous. 

A.39:  Would you consider a transitional institution such as one that allows the
resident, sort of like an apartment complex for elderly people?

B.40:  Yeah.  I think that would be great.  I had wished often with my husband's
grandmother that she had been in a place like that, because she had lived
alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even friends not
really close by her or a grocery store or anything, and I thought she could
have lived a, a lot longer if she had been in a place where she didn't have to
climb up and down the stairs, haul groceries and then she would have people to
check on her and didn't have to cook, because she just got to a point where
she wouldn't cook just for herself.  And then she fell down and nobody knew
about it for hours and hours and hours,

A.41:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.42:  # So # I think that would be great.  If I had to choose a place for myself
that's definitely, I think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful.  Even,
I recall, where I was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student.
I thought how, how neat, you know, that you can have a place where you can,
you know, go down together, have dinner with other people.  Because if your
living alone, the isolation and the depression and all those other factors
should be taken into consideration, too.  So I thought, you know, they should
have dorms for older people, so they had activities going on all the time and,
you know, it was [laughter] really a much more comfortable lifestyle.  I could
imagine for an older person so, yeah, I think that would be great if they had
places like that.

A.43:  Yeah.  That's, uh, you know, I hope if my, my mother ever gets to the point
where she can't take care of the home herself that she would consider,

B.44:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.45:  # Uh, # the apartment type setting,

B.46:  # Yeah.  #

A.47:  # You # know, from what I've seen with my grandmother who passed away maybe
ten or twelve years ago, they had her in a setting like that where she was
responsible to go to, they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own
little room.  It wasn't like she didn't have a stove or anything in her own
room,

B.48:  Yeah, they had their own privacy.  Yeah. 

A.49:  Yeah.  But, you know, she could walk to, walk to the dinner hall,

B.50:  Huh-uh. 

A.51:  Had games and should have, so it was sort of like a step between a nursing
home and, you know, a retirement village or whatever they're called. 

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  So, I guess there's different levels you just have to be sure to match your
loved one with that. 

B.54:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know how many of those there are, but I
definitely think it's a great idea to have that kind of thing.  You know, for
people.  I know, um, in that way, too, that sometimes the elderly can be more
involved with their families.  They can have their grand kids and that kind of
thing over to spend the night or, there's a lot more freedom, I think. 

A.55:  Huh-uh. 

B.56:  Instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and being told
where you're going to be and what you're going to do [laughter] in a nursing
home. 

A.57:  Yeah.  It's, she'll become, uh, you know, a big issue.  As you know, the
medical profession continues to you know, increase longevity. 

B.58:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.59:  We're going to see, you know, geriatrics will be a, a big part of the
medicine profession, I think. 

B.60:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.61:  So. 

B.62:  Let's hope it's true. 

A.63:  There's a lot to consider. 

B.64:  It is.  I've, I've had a lot of thought, thought provoking conversations on
[laughter] the topics [laughter]. 

A.65:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I guess I'm a big advocate of, um, ((decreased
morbidity)), which is where the elderly person through, I don't know, a
healthier lifestyle,

B.66:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.67:  # and # exercise and eating right can, you know, sustain them for longer
periods of time. 

B.68:  Right.  Right.  Well, as the insurance companies get more into this
preventative health care, I think that will help.  It just seems very slow
that, that is happening [laughter].

A.69:  Right. 

B.70:  But, uh, yeah.  I definitely think that will help. 

A.71:  Yeah.  Hopefully the insurance companies will see the advantage of signing
up a sixty year old for a, uh, you know, exercise class or,

B.72:  # Yeah.  Yeah.  #

A.73:  # something like # that.  Well, it's been fun talking with you. 

B.74:  [Laughter]  Okay, well take care. 

A.75:  All right. 

B.76:  Thank you. 

A.77:  Bye. 

B.78:  Bye-bye.
