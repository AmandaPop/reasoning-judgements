=============================================================================

B.1:  Yeah, I, I think that, uh, recycling is, uh, is real important right now,

A.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.3:  # or, # or, you know, for our future, of the ecology and everything.  Uh,
Richardson has, uh, started recently a newspaper recycling program,

A.4:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.5:  # where, # uh, they pick up newspapers in their, is, they're part of the
regular garbage pickup. 

A.6:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.7:  On, uh, Wednesdays every week,

A.8:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.9:  # and # then we have recycling centers around, you know, for aluminum and
glass and that kind of stuff. 

A.10:  Uh-huh.  So, do you recycle up those products?

B.11:  Well, I have not, uh, I haven't been doing much in the way of glass and
that kind of stuff, I have started recycling aluminum cans,

A.12:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.13:  # because # of, you know, I just keep those and then take them to one the
sale, there's a, centers around that buy those. 

A.14:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.15:  And, and, yes, I do stack the newspapers and put them out,

A.16:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh, #

B.17:  # in the # alley. 

A.18:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

B.19:  I did notice, uh, this Wednesday when I put them out, I must have gotten
them out late because they didn't pick them up,

A.20:  # [Laughter].  #

B.21:  # so, # they probably picked them up with the regular garbage yesterday. 

A.22:  Yeah, probably. 

B.23:  Yeah. 

A.24:  Well, they're, uh, out, I'm out in, uh, California recycling has been in
for a while, I mean, it's, yes, it's very important now I think it's actually
always been important, we're just recognizing it now that things,

B.25:  # Right.  #

A.26:  # are # starting to run out.  Um, it's, um, the main key to making
recycling is to make it more convenient for people I think.  And a community I
was just in, not the one I just moved to, uh, had basically, whenever you took
your trash out you could just throw another bin of recyclable,

B.27:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.28:  # refuse # out and not to be very, you know, you ((could have)) cans and
aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they
((sorted these)) out which increased their labor costs tremendously,

B.29:  # Right.  #

A.30:  # but, # uh, that sure made it easy, I mean, there was like no excuse not
to recycle, you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable,

B.31:  # Huh.  #

A.32:  # you # throw it in one, and if it's not, you throw it in the other,

B.33:  # Yeah.  #

A.34:  # and # take both out.  Um, so that seemed to have been working quite well.
Um, seems like the other thing to make recycling more viable is to make it
more economically, uh, [breathing], you know, increase the economic incentive,

B.35:  # {Very faint} ((Right)). #

A.36:  # uh, like news, # recycled newsprint isn't worth very much right now
because there's a lot of it available and trees are still cheap,

B.37:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.38:  # so, # [throat_clearing], from a purely economic standpoint I'd say re-,
one way to in-, to increase the viability of recycling is to increase the cost
of the raw materials, uh, through selective taxation or whatever.  Currently
most things like aluminum will only cost what it costs the company to produce
them, um, without any charge for, you know, long-term effects on the land or,
you know, (( )) with, with, min-, minimal taxation for repla-, replenishing the
land after the ((mine)) is gone or health costs or all sorts of things like
that,

B.39:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.40:  # or # for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground, you can
view it as you're stealing if from future generations. 

B.41:  Yeah, I guess that's a,

A.42:  # And, #

B.43:  # one # way to look at it [laughter]. 

A.44:  and no one ever pays them.  You know, basically you run out of these
things and, uh, and then you have to start using something else.  ((Yeah)), it
seems like we're using up a lot of the abundant mat-, minerals right now.  ((I
mean)), petroleum will be gone in about three decades,

B.45:  # Yeah.  #

A.46:  # at # the rate we're going, and it, it just seems like increasing the raw
cost of those would, uh, through, you know, more sensitivity of what the
long-term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would,

B.47:  Yeah, I guess, uh, i-, my main concern with, uh, with the recycling is that
we should be more geared to recycling or to eliminating the use of so much
stuff that does not or return to it's original and is not biodegradable,

A.48:  # Yeah.  #

B.49:  # uh, # the plastics and the,

A.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.51:  # Styrofoams # and things like that, uh, I really think we need to, to
really concentrate a lot more,

A.52:  # Yeah.  #

B.53:  # on, # on limiting tho-, the use of those.  Uh, I'm finding I'm, I'm
almost offended when I go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a
Styrofoam cup for coffee or something,

A.54:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.55:  # you know, # but, uh, I think there's, there's got to be a better way. 

A.56:  Well, things are changing, I mean, I've been really encouraged, I've, I
mean, I come from a family that's been recycling for thirty years and, uh, has
always been, you know, concerned about these things, and I'm just now starting
to see, you know, significant social movement towards recycling. 

B.57:  Yeah. 

A.58:  Um, the community, the Berkley City Council coined a term called precycling
which I liked which is the idea of, well, you can recycle all these little
aluminum cans and all this and that but you can also purchase products in the
first place which, uh, use less resources, you know,

B.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.60:  # not # buy those Styrofoam cups, not buy individual aluminum cans if
you're going to buy soda but get some, you know, larger reusable, cheaper
container and things like that,

B.61:  # Right.  #

A.62:  # uh, # they call it precycling, in other words, keep recycling but
minimize the original consumption too.

B.63:  Right, yeah.  I guess that's a, a good idea.  I d-, I would like to see,
yo-, we talk about buying the larger containers, I'd like to see those larger
containers not the, uh, not the plastic bottles I guess is the main thing. 

A.64:  Well, it's funny because plastic is incredibly recyclable.  Um, the problem
is there's so many different types of plastic and they can't be mixed
together.

B.65:  Right, yeah. 

A.66:  But any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than
anything,

B.67:  # Huh.  #

A.68:  # because # it melts down real easily,

B.69:  # Yeah, it's got to, #

A.70:  # and so ((forth)) can # be ((reloaded)).

B.71:  but it's got to go back to, to the same product or is that, is that the
way it works?

A.72:  Um, there are a number of laws about that.  Some things can't be recycled
back into the same products for health concerns even though they're not
scientifically valid health concerns, I mean, because some, you know, anything
will get killed when you melt down plastic. 

B.73:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.74:  Uh, but, and other things made to be, uh, can go back, you know, glass can
go back into glass bottles and stuff,

B.75:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.76:  # but # if it's mixed plastic, it can only go to certain uses.  It can make
actually plastic lumber for like, uh, park benches and things like that,

B.77:  # Yeah.  #

A.78:  # out # of mixed plastic. 

B.79:  Yeah, I saw a, uh, an advertisement on television yesterday for a garden
hose, it's a, a soaker hose,

A.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.81:  # it's # made out of recycled tires. 

A.82:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.83:  And, uh, I thought that was a, was an interesting idea, I had not, I had
not heard of that before,

A.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.85:  # but, # I, you know, I knew that tires were recycled quite, you know,
quite a bit for different things.

A.86:  Yeah, although there's far a lot more could be done, there are just, there
are yards just heaped with mountains literally mountains of tires,

B.87:  # Right.  #

A.88:  # which # they don't know what to do with. 

B.89:  Yeah. 

A.90:  So, if we can do more things with those, that would be helpful. 

B.91:  Yeah.  But, uh, I thi-, you know, I think that, uh, that the future should
be that, uh, home builders and, you know, designers and everybody should be
really gearing, you know, the, the home to have a recycling center in it. 

A.92:  Yeah, yeah,

B.93:  # {Very faint} And, uh, that's, #

A.94:  # and more efficient pickups and # everything. 

B.95:  Yeah.  We're, uh, my wife and I are, are looking at, you know, designing a
new house now,

A.96:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.97:  # and, uh, # probably, you know, some years away before we'll be ready to
build it but,

A.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.99:  # that, # uh, that's one of the things that we're looking at is, you know,
where we, where are we going to put the recycling bins [laughter]. 

A.100:  Sure, some kind of recycling chutes [laughter] or something. 

B.101:  Right, so, uh, we're going to have that designed, you know, where, that in
mind when we do our floor plans. 

A.102:  Well, that would be admirable,

B.103:  # Yeah.  #

A.104:  # I, # I think that's wonderful. 

B.105:  Yeah. 

A.106:  Well great.  Uh,

B.107:  # Okay it's been, #

A.108:  # oh, the last # thing, as long as I've got on audience [laughter], 

B.109:  # [Laughter].  #

A.110:  # is # the, uh, I really want to see more recycling of batteries.  Because,

B.111:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.112:  # batteries have # all kinds of toxins in them and they're quite recyclable
and most people just throw them in the trash or they leak into the ground water
or all kinds of stuff. 

B.113:  Right. 

A.114:  But most people aren't even aware that batteries are something you
shouldn't throw away in the trash.

B.115:  Yeah. 

A.116:  I mean, like Japan, it's illegal to throw batteries away in the trash. 

B.117:  When you say batteries do you mean, uh, automobile batteries or,

A.118:  Well, those are the worst defenders, it's because they're biggest, but even
some of the small ones,

B.119:  # Oh.  #

A.120:  # need # to be disposed of properly.  Just your basic ten cell batteries,
um, once they rust out there's some pretty nasty things in them, especially the
mercury ones. 

B.121:  Huh. 

A.122:  But, um, it's, it's, it's a regular trash item in this country. 

B.123:  Yeah. 

A.124:  Um, despite the fact that if you were, if you were a company throwing that
kind of stuff away, the E P A could give you a major fine. 

B.125:  Yeah. 

A.126:  [Laughter]  Because it's a toxin. 

B.127:  Yeah, so, well, that's, uh, that was some interesting ideas anyway and, uh,
if I get a chance I'll, uh, pass those along. 

A.128:  Okay [laughter], 

B.129:  # Okay.  #

A.130:  # well, # nice talking with you. 

B.131:  Uh-huh, nice talking to you. 

A.132:  Bye-bye. 

B.133:  Bye.
