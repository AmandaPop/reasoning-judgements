============================================================================

A.1:  Um, you know, one thing that I miss being in a small company is the
opportunity for, um, job growth.  Just different job opportunity.  I was
talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today, and she was telling me how
she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another
department and moved on and so forth, and so forth, and is now, uh, personnel,
uh, director, and I mean, it's just, it's, there's so much opportunity in a
larger company, to, uh, stay within the same company, so you're not losing
your seniority level, but, um just to try new things and, and see new areas
and departments and, I mean, you can, in, in a large company you can go from
one department to another department as if, if you switched companies
sometimes.

B.2:  Well, yes, you have an opportunity to, [throat_clearing] to use a J O B
system which is a job opportunity system, it's,

A.3:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.4:  # most # com-, most big companies have that, but.  Tha-, I think sometime
that you get lost in that also. 

A.5:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.6:  # I really # do, I, I, I sometimes think that a small company may offer
{pause}, well, I'm not sure how to pu-, [laughter], 

A.7:  # Well, uh-huh.  #

B.8:  # I'm not # sure how to put this but that's not, uh, perhaps better one on
one, uh, relations.  A, a big company, sometime you can get lost,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # you # can, you can, uh, opportunities do arise but the competition is
much greater for that, opportunity (( )).

A.11:  Uh-huh, well it's true, yeah.  There is a very, uh, a-, at least in my
office, and I know that's not necessarily the way it is all over, but the
camaraderie within the office, when you are with a small company, I think
you're right, you could be even, uh, you can be a big person in a small
company, you know.

B.12:  Exactly, I, and I think you get a lot more support from your co-workers
and,

A.13:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # and often # times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in
other areas that [breathing] may not be your expertise, okay,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.16:  # but # they require you to do this as their, as your, uh, stepping stone
or whatever you'd care to call it.

A.17:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.18:  # And, # and that can get to be, sometimes, very, very disastrous. 

A.19:  # Uh-huh, sure.  #

B.20:  # Wi-, the # consequences of that because people do the best they can,

A.21:  # Right.  #

B.22:  # and # often times it's not really what was aimed at in the first place,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # if # that makes sense. 

A.25:  Yeah, I understand that.  You know a question that I have for you is, um,
do you feel wo-, working in a large company do you feel that you can see the
impact that you make? Do you feel that you can see like the results? I know in
my company, each person is vital because we are the company, and each person
really can see the results that they produce.

B.26:  Yes, I can, I see that in my job,

A.27:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.28:  # because # my particular job is of, of a troubleshooting nature. 

A.29:  # Oh.  #

B.30:  # And # I'm, you know, it's one of these put out fires things. 

A.31:  Uh-huh [sniffing]. 

B.32:  So, I can see the results of that. 

A.33:  I see, yeah [laughter]. 

B.34:  But, um, yes, I, I'm, I, I get a lot of gratification from my job.  Bu-,
some, some folks, I guess they go to work every day and they just go to work
for a paycheck every, every two weeks,

A.35:  # Yeah, #

B.36:  # or # every month or whatever. 

A.37:  # I, I, #

B.38:  # But in # my particular job, I really enjoy it because I do have an
opportunity to help other people do better, okay,

A.39:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.40:  # and I # really like that. 

A.41:  Uh-huh, I, I do feel bad for the people, I mean, obviously we all work for
a paycheck but it's nice if you can be enjoying it, you know,

B.42:  # Yeah, #

A.43:  # while # you're doing it. 

B.44:  I, I, I also teach school at, at T I,

A.45:  # Oh.  #

B.46:  # at, # uh, Texas Instruments, I'm a, I'm an instructor there so. 

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # I # teach new, well not new employees, but al-, ye-, all employee, any
employees really that, that care to.  And we talked about the job opportunity
system.  We have, uh, a system where we train people t-, to become what we call
automation specialists. 

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  And, and, it's a job where if you, as a secretary, you decide you want to
be, uh, an automation specialist, which is a much higher paying job and a much
more technical job,

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  and then you would come to one of our in-house classes. 

A.53:  That is great. 

B.54:  On, on company time. 

A.55:  Oh really. 

B.56:  And, and, and or on overtime, so we don't involve the, the, uh, production
process,

A.57:  # [Breathing]  Uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # okay, of, # of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and
establish these sixteen and twenty week classes at, at, uh, three hours a day,
twice a week for automation specialist training.

A.59:  That is wonderful. 

B.60:  When you finish, hopefully, you've acquired enough knowledge to, uh, you
know, move on into advanced machinery type operations,

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # and, # and, and that, that's really gratifying to me, I, I see a lot of
young folks come in and, and gals and guys both and some gals will say I kno-,
I don't know a hammer from a, a nail or a wrench, [laughter] I me-, you know,
an,

A.63:  # Uh-huh [laughter].  #

B.64:  # okay, that's # and that's where we'll start,

A.65:  Uh-huh, well,

B.66:  but, and we have the other side of the coin,

A.67:  # Yeah.  #

B.68:  # where # you have you know, really advanced people coming in and, and top
notch, uh, mechanical type people and they want to do better so they,

A.69:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.70:  # of co-, # they, they jump right on it, so. 

A.71:  That is great.  And that is so smart because with, uh everything becoming
so much more technical and sophisticated, you're just not finding people out in
the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need. 

B.72:  No, that's a fact and,

A.73:  I me-, you just don't find them.  And i-, it's su-, such a great way, take
the people that you already have and train them. 

B.74:  And tra-, train them. 

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  We, sometimes we have to, uh, simply for, for two reasons,

A.77:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.78:  # one # that we, we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our
methods of doing things.  And we are finding more economical methods and more,
okay. 

A.79:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.80:  And the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in
off the street and help us.

A.81:  Uh-huh, right. 

B.82:  So, but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job.  I'm that
one time we, the girls used to have just the typewriter and then they,

A.83:  # Uh-huh, exactly.  #

B.84:  # and then # they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk
top publishers, so, you know. 

A.85:  Oh, my, oh exactly, I mean it's incredible. 

B.86:  It is, I, I'm, that amazes me, tha-,

A.87:  # Um, yeah [laughter].  #

B.88:  # you know, people # say your job amazes me, well my job is really nothing.
I sit there and I watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view
foils and graphs and,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # and # it's, I, it's, you know, they use laser printers and all that. 

A.91:  # Wow.  #

B.92:  # And # it's absolutely mind-boggling. 

A.93:  # Yeah.  #

B.94:  # Uh, # because I could probably turn it on before I get the screen to go
completely blank, you know.

A.95:  [Laughter]. 

B.96:  And I generally do that. 

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  But I, I was in the same situation, I had to learn,

A.99:  # Right.  #

B.100:  # I, # I had no knowledge of a computer at all, I'm a master mechanic but
not a computer expert. 

A.101:  Right [breathing]. 

B.102:  But now I'm in to Lotus and word processing and I can hold my own with that
[laughter]. 

A.103:  Oh, that's great.  That is fabulous. 

B.104:  But, um,

A.105:  You know another benefit that, that I wish I had more of, and who wouldn't,
is vacation time. 

B.106:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

A.107:  You know, um, I think that, uh, whe-, when you're working and, an
especially, I don't know, I mean, every job, you, you say how you're
constantly putting out fires, you know, I, I feel like my job is like that
too, unfortunately.  But that just, it drains you, you know, after a while.
It jus-,

B.108:  Yeah, I, I, I feel that way and it's a long time to get, you know, you work
for many years with two weeks vacation, per year. 

A.109:  # Yeah, yeah exactly, right.  #

B.110:  # And then if you # have extra days out for what other reasons, uh, there
may be, uh, an, and we, we try to deal on an individual basis with them but,

A.111:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.112:  # you # can be penalized for that, an, and it,

A.113:  # Oh.  #

B.114:  # it's, # penalized against your merit increases,

A.115:  # Oh, wow.  #

B.116:  # and et # cetera.  So I mean you are allowed a certain number of days, o-,
what we call sick time and personal time off,

A.117:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.118:  but if you, you know, if you extend beyond those an, and at times we will
adjust on a one to one basis,

A.119:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.120:  for some unusual circumstances.  But,

A.121:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.122:  # to # work for a company almost fifteen years, with two weeks vacation,

A.123:  # It's hard.  #

B.124:  # it seems # to me like an awful long time. 

A.125:  Is that, uh, what your company policy is, too?

B.126:  Well no, it, well in some instances yes, okay. 

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  In some instances it would be.  We start with a, a weeks vacation and then
it's two weeks after a year or so. 

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # But # then that two weeks stays,

A.131:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.132:  # and # then it goes to three weeks for a long, long time and then after
fifteen years it's four weeks. 

A.133:  Oh my goodness. 

B.134:  But that's still, that's a long time (( )), you know. 

A.135:  But that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation, I
was just talking to somebody about this today, it's funny.  It takes you until
Tuesday or Wednesday, to really wind down.

B.136:  Oh, sure. 

A.137:  You know, to say, okay, I, I can relax, I can sit here for an hour if I
want to and just not do anything.  And realize that you don't have to be
worrying about something, you know.

B.138:  I think, uh, I would like to see, I would like to see more, well, if like
the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they
have breaks every ninety days,

A.139:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.140:  # or # thirty days, or ninety days or whatever it is,

A.141:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.142:  # they # have two weeks off or a week off or someth-,

A.143:  Right. 

B.144:  And they find that that's much better for them than having the whole summer
off, an where they're completely bored,

A.145:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.146:  # like # the second month into, I think,

A.147:  # That's true.  #

B.148:  # I think # industry re-, would really benefit from that. 

A.149:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.150:  # I'm # not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on
vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded I guess, but. 

A.151:  #Yeah, well that's where temporaries come in [laughter].# 

B.152:  #So that's a problem, you know, that's a problem.#  Pardon me. 

A.153:  They could hire temporaries to fill in [laughter]. 

B.154:  Well, yes, that's, and that's exactly what we do in many instances, you
know, where our work load increases an, and our vacation periods and stuff. 

A.155:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.156:  Of course we have, uh, what we called an S D S, a Summer Development
Student Program so,

A.157:  # Oh.  #

B.158:  # we, # we put a lot of school, um, colle-,

A.159:  Like a co-op type thing for the summer?

B.160:  Pardon me. 

A.161:  Like a co-op for the summer, almos-,

B.162:  Yeah, they work for us and, and they, they go to school back in the Fall. 

A.163:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.164:  # And # hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on
full-time. 

A.165:  Right. 

B.166:  And they've, uh, established themselves with a work pattern an,

A.167:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.168:  and, the, you know, they're familiar to our,

A.169:  # Right.  #

B.170:  # our # ways and stuff and they're on our records and we find that that's
very very helpful.

A.171:  Yeah i-, that is and, uh, it also gives you a chance, you know, to look at
these kids and make your own determinations. 

B.172:  You sound u-, like a very young person. 

A.173:  I'm twenty-five.
