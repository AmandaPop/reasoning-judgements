=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, I currently don't have a pet, 

B.2:  Oh.

A.3:  although, uh, I have in the past [laughter].  

B.4:  You don't have one?  

A.5:  Not right now, we,

B.6:  I have a cat and a dog both.

A.7:  Oh, my gosh.  Well, you should have a lot to talk about then.

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  But, uh, no, the place I live in is a little too small right now for, uh,
for a pet.  I hate to, hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have
enough room for it to run around in,

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  so, but, uh, I guess you don't have that problem,

B.12:  No, I have,

A.13:  at least with a cat.  

B.14:  I have a house that, uh, has a, a fairly good sized yard and I, I also
I'm here at, by, at night by myself because my husband works at night,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  and, so, I, I wanted a dog for protection and we-,

A.17:  I can imagine.  

B.18:  and we got a Dalmatian.  

A.19:  That's a pretty big dog.  

B.20:  Yeah, and he, 

A.21:  That's a pretty dog though.  

B.22:  he's wonderful because, uh, he's really protective, 

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  and, uh, that was probably our main reason for getting him.  But,

A.25:  How, how's he like the cat or how's the cat like the dog, I guess, 
((it)),
 
B.26:  Oh, he loves the cat, the, uh, Sam, our Dalmatian, loves the cat, but the
cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all.

A.27:  [Laughter].  

B.28:  You know, he'll flap at him and hiss at him and everything and the cat
stays in all the time, so.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  That's a, uh, you know, barrier there but,

A.31:  I guess it's a good reason to, to have a pet then as protection, I guess,
is one thing.

B.32:  Huh.  Yeah, it is.  

A.33:  But, uh, I guess, I, they're a lot of company though.

B.34:  Friendship, yeah.  

A.35:  Yeah, friendship, they're an awful lot of company.  

B.36:  Yeah, oh, Sam is very loving if, if one of us are out in the yard, you
know, he wants to jump and play and lick a typical puppy,

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  type atmosphere although he's almost two years old but, 

A.39:  Oh, jeez.  

B.40:  um, yeah, the cat is a lot of companionship.  

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  He just, he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you to pet him
and, and that kind of thing.

A.43:  Doesn't, doesn't get too excited about anything?

B.44:  No [laughter], not at all.  Not at all.  

A.45:  He's not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television,

B.46:  No.  

A.47:  is he?

B.48:  [Laughter] My Mom has a cat though that does that,

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  and that's kind of weird, we haven't figured that out yet.  

A.51:  Yeah, I noticed ((how they)) get black cats it seems like they always want
to sit on top of the television set and let their tail, only when, when
there's something you really want to see, then they let their tail down in
front of the T V set.

B.52:  Yeah.   

A.53:  In front of the screen and, uh, they, they just seem to know, I guess.

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  But, uh,

B.56:  just intuition or something, instinct (( )).

A.57:  It, it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though I guess, uh, you
know, a lot of people, I mean, I guess I never cared for birds or fish or, um,
or gerbils or anything like that.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  But dogs and cats are about the only thing I think of when I think of pets.

B.60:  Yeah.  I've, I've never had any of the ones that you just mentioned, I have
had a rabbit,

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat.  It stayed in the house
all the time,

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  and it used a litter box, 

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  so, it had free run of the house.  

A.67:  Was it as, was it as friendly as the cat or do you, 

B.68:  Uh, not, 

A.69:  do you think you, uh,

B.70:  not to strangers, 

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  not to strangers at all.  Matter of fact, it would run and hide, but
after it got to know you, it was funny because it would jump up on the couch
and sit right next to you, you know, and it kind of pants.

A.73:  Huh.

B.74:  I didn't know a rabbit panted but, 

A.75:  Neither did I.   

B.76:  [Laughter] they pant kind of like a dog.  

A.77:  Huh.  

B.78:  And it's kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them, and my
rabbit got real large.  I think he was thirteen pounds.

A.79:  Oh, gee, that is a big rabbit.   

B.80:  [Laughter] So he was really big.  That was kind of funny looking.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  But he was a good guard.  

A.83:  Was he?  

B.84:  Yeah.  At, he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove
up or anything.

A.85:  But, but he's not much protection I would imagine.  

B.86:  Oh, no, [laughter], no.  No, I don't think so.

A.87:  Not, not an attack rabbit or anything like that?

B.88:  No, nothing like that.  

A.89:  Not real protective but, uh, well, I, I guess that's about [laughter], to
say about that.

@@B.90:  Okay.  

A.91:  All right, well, very nice speaking to you.  

B.92:  Thanks.   

A.93:  #Bye-bye.#  

B.94:  #Bye-bye.#
