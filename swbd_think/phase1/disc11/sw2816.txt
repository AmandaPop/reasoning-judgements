A.1:  Well, le-, tell me about, you said your daughter ha-, had some of this, why
don't you tell me a little bit about that. 

B.2:  Well, um, she has had, she had ((some)) experience with child care, uh,
service one, um, and, uh, it was with, well actually, she's had two.  She's had
one with a baby sitter and one with, uh, a child care service and, uh, what she
[laughter]  has done is to actually, uh, find a way of working at home so she
does not have to be a away from her children [laughter], 

A.3:  # [Laughter]  Without a (( )) completely,#

B.4:  # that's right, #

A.5:  Oh, my gosh. 

B.6:  that's correct.  Uh, she was not happy with the, uh, child care service,
um, the particular one that she was with was, uh, kind of, well, they just
weren't very attentive to the children, uh, each child is an individual and,
uh, to be treated at a very, very early age as a ((map)) [laughter] and say
you have to do this at a certain time and you have to do this at a certain
time.  It just wasn't working out very well,

A.7:  Really isn't any substitute for mothers (( )) [laughter]. 

B.8:  That's right and, uh, um, I'm, I'm not sure about there in Texas but I know
here in Maryland, uh, we have had a couple of incidences that, uh, where child
care has not turned out to be very good,

A.9:  # No.  #

B.10:  # it # has been very, very bad,

A.11:  It's (( )) very bad. # I found out,#

B.12:  # so, you could (( )), #

A.13:  ((seen)) the thing that scares everybody to death,

B.14:  that's right, and you can't tell beforehand,

A.15:  Right. 

B.16:  um, she, uh, the second route went with, uh, uh, an individual that she
knew to care for her child and this was fine as long as the person was willing
to do it, but then she decided that she was [laughter] going to go work
[laughter].  So, uh, and not do it anymore, so she was kind of left in the ((
)),

A.17:  I think maybe when you talk about the criteria that's the one thing is
to is to somehow get to know well enough --

B.18:  Yes. 

A.19:  -- what, where you're putting this child and if you know your child well
then, then you know whether this is going to work.  Sometimes some of these
things work out well, uh, interesting enough, my daughter, uh, just started
working in, uh, in a day care center.  She needed to go to work and she has two
little boys.  one's about, uh, uh, almost five and the other's almost three. 
And, uh, uh, they were driving her crazy [laughter]  because they were never
busy enough, you know,

B.20:  # Right.  #

A.21:  # she # couldn't ever do enough things to keep 'em, uh, away from the
television and, uh, uh, and that sort of thing.  And, uh, so, but she looked
at places to work for along time before she finally chose one tha-, that she
said she could not have been comfortable in any of the others because, uh,
this one's kind of laid back a little bit, you know.

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  It's kind of flows with the children,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  That's good, #

A.25:  # like her children # play in another area but they're welcome to come and
sit on her lap anytime they feel like it. 

B.26:  Right. 

A.27:  And, uh, and she can go by and wave at them, you know, and talk to 'em and
visit with 'em and she gets this feeling of, uh, of, uh, intermingling with
them and yet they get the activity of the other children which they seem to
need at this point.

B.28:  Right.  Well I agree there.  Uh, my granddaughter is in a preschool and it
has been the best thing in the world for her. 

A.29:  Yes,

B.30:  # Yes.  #

A.31:  # there's # a lot of times when you need some of that but the idea of, of
having nothing else, is what's,

B.32:  Right.  Right.  # I understand, uh,#

A.33:  # uh, and, #

B.34:  and it is hard, I, thr-, I work with a girl here that just went through a
very, ve-, traumatic cha-, change.  She has one that is, uh, six months old and
another one that is three years old.  And, uh, trying to, I mean she has to
work.  There is no choice,

A.35:  # Uh-huh.  No.  Right.  #

B.36:  # uh, uh, and # but child care for those ages, uh, runs into a, a week,

A.37:  It's very difficult,

B.38:  and, uh,

A.39:  costs so much but you can't hardly afford to work even when you have to,

B.40:  that's right.  That's right.  And that's what, she's almost working for
her child care [laughter]. 

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  Um, uh,

A.43:  There are some ways rightly so, you know, it's a sad thing, that, uh, that,
[breathing]  you realize the child care if it's done right is probably
[laughter]  the most demanding job in the world [laughter]. 

B.44:  Right.  Oh, yes. 

A.45:  And if they real are good at it [laughter]  you're probably not paying them
any too much. 

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  And, yet, and yet, it's, uh, you can't get something else to do.  I guess,
uh, that's probably the reason Sheila felt like going that direction,

B.48:  # Right.  #

A.49:  # uh, # I have a niece that stayed here to that, uh, uh, they were here for
about six months with their two, two little girls and, uh, she look in children
here at my house [laughter], 

B.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.51:  # while # she was here.  Uh, you know, not many, like three,

B.52:  # Right.  #

A.53:  # others, # and, uh, uh, we have a big house so it wasn't a problem, and
she, uh, but it was kind of an interest-, it was interesting watching her, you
know, her interaction with the children.  She didn't do anything else all day. 
She just sat and played and intermingled with 'em, you know, and read to them,
and change their pants, and fed them,

B.54:  # Right.  #

A.55:  # and # moved 'em from one thing [laughter]  to another. 

B.56:  Well, that's what they, that's what should be, you know, that is ideal, um,
my middle daughter is interested in day care, uh, has been since she was in
high school and they had, uh, uh, a day care center there at the high school.
Of course, it was only for, uh, like four hours,

A.57:  # Yeah.  #

B.58:  # so # like it was really not a true day care, but, um, uh, she is taking
classes, things to work toward, uh, becoming a day care teacher,

A.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.60:  # uh, # because she loves children so much, but, uh, she's baby sitting
now.  She has one of her own, and she has three others. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  And, uh, she had three of them for, uh, th-, their parents worked shift
work --

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  -- so, she was three of them off and on for, uh, more than twenty-four
hours. 

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  So, uh, but, uh, uh, but it is hard and, and if you move into a new area --

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  -- uh, it's almost impossible because you have to know somebody who will
recommend some place,

A.69:  # That's true.  #

B.70:  # that, uh, # you know is going to be safe and secure.  I would like to see
more companies, uh,

A.71:  # I think so too, #

B.72:  # develop them right in # the company,

A.73:  I think that's the answer. 

B.74:  yes, I do too. 

A.75:  I think it's got to come through the work place,

B.76:  # Right.  #

A.77:  # where # they where, uh, uh, a parent can take a child and may be even
have an area an isolation area where children who are ill,

B.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.79:  # can # be there,

B.80:  # It would, #

A.81:  # and, uh, #

B.82:  save 'em money all-around [laughter]. 

A.83:  you know, if there not too ill, uh, and,

B.84:  # Right, well, yeah.  #

A.85:  # uh, and a # parent can go and do her work and there is somebody there who
can do it.  Think of how many jobs they would supply people who,

B.86:  # Sure.  #

A.87:  # are # not trained to do other kinds of things. 

B.88:  That's right. 

A.89:  And with the right kind of supervision, you know, if you had somebody who
su-, who really knows what she's doing supervise other people --

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  -- you could really go a long ways to alleviating some of the problems that
people have. 

B.92:  Right. 

A.93:  And, so, well it's been great talking to you. 

B.94:  Well, its been good talking to you. 

A.95:  Right.  Uh, perhaps we'll talk again. 

B.96:  #Right.# 

A.97:  #(( )). Okay.# 

B.98:  Bye-bye now. 

A.99:  Uh-huh.  Bye.
