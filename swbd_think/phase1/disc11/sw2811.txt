=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what I was going to tell you about is that my fianc3e and I have just
finished, as a matter of fact today, restoring a seventy-three Mercedes. 

B.2:  You don't mean it? 

A.3:  I, I, we've done a little bit of it ourselves, but mostly we were lucky
enough to find a, a guy that works for a Mercedes dealership and he restores
cars,

B.4:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.5:  # on # his, on his, uh, you know off time. 

B.6:  How'd you find this one?

A.7:  Well it was, uh, a gentleman that works with my fianc3e and he had bought
it for his daughter and she wasn't taking care of it and boy was that obvious
when they pulled up in it.

B.8:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.9:  # It # had been really, uh,

B.10:  # Pretty shabby shape, huh.  #

A.11:  # it was in a # mess,

B.12:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.13:  # it was # just in a terrible mess.  Uh,

B.14:  So what's the last thing you ever had done to it?

A.15:  Well the last thing we did to it was today they had, uh, replaced the gear
shift. 

B.16:  My goodne-,

A.17:  Um, it's, uh, it wasn't, we had to order the part from the dealership and
the guys put it in today.  When you shifted it down, you didn't know if you
were in park, drive, reverse, whatever.

B.18:  Oh, I hear you. 

A.19:  So that was the very last thing that we had to, uh, had to have done. 

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  Uh, basically the whole car's been redone.  They put in new, uh, they used
new sheet metal and stuff to, to repair the body,

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # I # mean there were, you know, these rusted dents,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # a # new paint job,

B.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.27:  # they, # uh, redid all of the trim. 

B.28:  My goodness. 

A.29:  We had the seats reupholstered,

B.30:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # we put # in a new dash, it's been recarpeted, it's just, it was, you
know, just com-,

B.32:  My goodness you all put a lot of money in this. 

A.33:  Yeah, it was completely overhauled and, uh,

B.34:  # Uh-huh, is it a diesel? #

A.35:  # for what, it's a diesel, # uh-huh,

B.36:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # it sure # is [throat_clearing]. 

B.38:  I guess it's what, four speed on the column. 

A.39:  Yeah, you're right, uh-huh. 

B.40:  Uh-huh, I seem to recall the old Mercedes had four speeds on the column. 

A.41:  Yeah, yeah, and it's, it's just been lovingly restored. 

B.42:  # Uh-huh [throat_clearing].  #

A.43:  # That's one # good thing about, about having somebody to do it your,
you're, you're there because they worked on it here at our home. 

B.44:  Uh-huh, so how many miles does it have on it. 

A.45:  I have no idea, I, I doubt that anybody will ever really know [laughter]. 

B.46:  Why the speedometer was disconnected or something. 

A.47:  Well I, I, I can't really remember what it shows on there,

B.48:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.49:  # but # I remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure
that that was like,

B.50:  # Uh-huh, uh.  #

A.51:  # times, maybe # or a-, an additional one hundred added on to that, a
hundred thousand. 

B.52:  I hear you. 

A.53:  Yeah, because it's, uh, it had definitely been through the mill, but, uh,

B.54:  Well I've got a little car that, uh, has a certain history to it too. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  It's an old seventy-one Maverick and I'm not trying to redo the body or
anything,

A.57:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.58:  # but I've # had it to drive back and forth to work now for some, I guess
nineteen years or so,

A.59:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh my gosh, you've had it,

B.60:  and it's got two hundred and one thousand miles on it. 

A.61:  Oh my word. 

B.62:  And it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go
back and forth to work car. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  And, uh, I, uh, I guess the interesting about this is about the only work I
do on it myself, an the last time I did do some work, was I did a brake job on
it,

A.65:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.66:  # and # that costs me fourteen dollars,

A.67:  # Oh my word.  #

B.68:  # by buying the # parts at one of the local discount parts houses you know.

A.69:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.70:  # And, and luckily # this time didn't need to have drums turned or
anything. 

A.71:  Replaced, yeah. 

B.72:  And I was able to do a brake job on there at fairly, I think expensive
price by doing it myself, of course.

A.73:  Yeah, oh definitely. 

B.74:  But another interesting aspect of this car, like yours is, uh, it's only
had the oil changed about six times since, uh, seventy-five thousand miles.

A.75:  Oh, gosh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.76:  Because I only change the oil every twenty-five thousand miles. 

A.77:  Ri-, [laughter]  right. 

B.78:  I do change the oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred, though. 

A.79:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.80:  But, uh, other than that, it only has the oil changed every twenty-five
thousand miles and that is a, a true statement. 

A.81:  # Yeah.  #

B.82:  # I # just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact,

A.83:  # [Laughter].  #

B.84:  # two # weeks ago thanking them for the, uh, good durability that Mobil One
oil, which is what I use in it, provides. 

A.85:  Uh-huh. 

B.86:  [Throat_clearing]  Because it does have two hundred and one thousand honest
miles,

A.87:  # Gosh, that's unbelievable.  #

B.88:  # and it's only # had the oil changed those few times,

A.89:  # Um.  #

B.90:  # and, # uh, it, uh, performs very nicely. 

A.91:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.92:  # It's # sh-, the, uh, transmission of course, I get overhauled on it, not
overhauled but all the, uh, fluid drained out and new screen and, and filters
and everything,

A.93:  # Right, right.  #

B.94:  # put them # in every fifty thousand miles, religiously. 

A.95:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.96:  So it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new,

A.97:  # That's am-, that is amazing.  #

B.98:  # and the engine still runs # just as strong today as it did when it was
brand new. 

A.99:  Is it the same engine that's been in it all the time. 

B.100:  Oh yeah, the, the engine's never had any work done on it all except at
ninety-five thousand miles, I think it was, uh, we rebuilt the carburetor, and
a hundred thirty-five thousand miles we put a new, uh, water pump on it.

A.101:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.102:  # No internal # work has ever been done on the engine.  It's had, uh,

A.103:  # Wow.  #

B.104:  # three # starters, one fuel pump, about six, eight, ten batteries, I guess
been put in the car. 

A.105:  Uh-huh, ye-, [laughter]. 

B.106:  And, uh, uh, one, uh, uh, um, voltage regulator during all this time. 

A.107:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.108:  And that's it, nothing else been ever done to it except, you know, the
usual filters,

A.109:  # That's amazing.  #

B.110:  # and this # that and the other that you have to put on i-,

A.111:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.112:  # an d-, # it, and the, uh, radiator on it has been rebuilt twice. 

A.113:  So the car was how old when you, when you bought it?

B.114:  Well, I bought it from a fellow that I knew, uh, that worked up here.  It
had sixty-nine thousand miles on it at that time. 

A.115:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.116:  # He always # took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat
with.  And when it,

A.117:  # Yeah, oh I see.  #

B.118:  # when it got to # be old and, uh, or older, I bought it in seventy-seven
from him, it was about six years old. 

A.119:  Uh-huh. 

B.120:  And, uh, it had sixty-nine thousand miles on it and I had written about
synth-, I had read about synthetic oils in POPULAR SCIENCE,

A.121:  # Yeah.  #

B.122:  # so # I decided, hey this is a good car to experiment on it. 

A.123:  # Exactly.  #

B.124:  # I # won't have much money in it, you know,

A.125:  # Yeah.  #

B.126:  # I # only bought it for a thousand dollars. 

A.127:  # Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.128:  # So I changed # it over to, uh, Mobil One at seventy-five thousand miles,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # and # I proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every
twenty-five thousand miles, as they say on the can. 

A.131:  Yeah. 

B.132:  And, uh, but I,

A.133:  Oh is, it does say that on the can. 

B.134:  but the oil gets, yeah it says that on the can. 

A.135:  # I didn't realize that, uh-huh.  #

B.136:  # Mobil One cans, if you # read them says, uh, uh, it, it says as, as the
automobile manufacturer recommends or twenty-five thousand miles, what they
used to say, anyway.

A.137:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.138:  So I decided this would do as a good experiment and I had read about this,
these kinds of synthetic oils in, um, as I said POPULAR SCIENCE. 

A.139:  # Uh-huh, right.  #

B.140:  # [Throat_clearing]  But # the oil gets so black that, uh, at every twelve
thousand five hundred miles I do pull the oil filter and change out the oil
filter,

A.141:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.142:  # and # when you do that you have to add a quart. 

A.143:  Oh, I see, yeah. 

B.144:  But this car uses no oil at all, between oil changes. 

A.145:  # That's amazing.  #

B.146:  # I mean # not a drop. 

A.147:  Yeah, and this is a Maverick, you said. 

B.148:  It's a seventy-one Maverick. 

A.149:  Maverick.  Well I had, uh, I had owned a Cougar up until, oh, just several
months ago that I had had since, uh, um, I think it was in eighty-two or
something. 

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  And I had that car only, uh, about two years and the engine blew in it. 

B.152:  Oh. 

A.153:  And so I had to put in a new engine, that was, that's an experience when
you have a two year old car,

B.154:  # Uh.  #

A.155:  # you # know, and it wasn't in warranty th-, I mean it must have like the
day after the warranty was expired,

B.156:  # My goodness, #

A.157:  # it must # have exploded. 

B.158:  what kind of engine was it?

A.159:  I have no i-, uh, V, is it V eight, I don't, I don't know a lot of,

B.160:  Well they have V eights, they have V sixes, and they have,

A.161:  What's the biggest one, is a V eight bigger. 

B.162:  I guess the V eight. 

A.163:  Yeah, that's what it had in it,

B.164:  Well that's interesting. 

A.165:  And, yeah, so it, it, uh, that's my latest experience, with anything major.

B.166:  I guess that's, uh, uh, y-, you must undoubtedly get all kinds of
different, uh, uh, engine types or whatever in terms of their durability
depending on how they got made,

A.167:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.168:  # but this # one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted. 

A.169:  Well see that's what I was thinking, I thought maybe it has something,
because that turned me off from American cars, I mean,

B.170:  # Oh really.  #

A.171:  # [Laughter]  you # know, someth-, and I'm sure I shouldn't, I shouldn't
feel that way. 

B.172:  # Um.  #

A.173:  # That's # why I was surprised to hear you talk about this car, it sounds
very resilient.  Whatever they have in that en-, whatever a kind of engine it
is in that car.

B.174:  It's just a V eight, same as what was in your Cougar probably. 

A.175:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe it has something to do, but I, I know, I took good
care of it.  I changed the oil quite often.

B.176:  You did?

A.177:  I didn't even do that myself.  I, I could never do any of this myself. 

B.178:  Yeah. 

A.179:  You know, I'm just not, uh, I'm not, uh,

B.180:  And it still blew up?

A.181:  # Yeah, and it still blew up.  #

B.182:  # You're sure nobody ever sugared your # gas tank or anything, that got mad
at you about something. 

A.183:  Well now that, yeah, not that I know of [laughter]. 

B.184:  Because I had a van that, uh, somebody sugared my gas tank and it, it tore
that engine up and I had to replace it,

A.185:  # Oh really.  #

B.186:  # but, if # it hadn't been for that, then, uh, I would have never had any
problems. 

A.187:  You would never have a problem.  Well you know that's possible, I never had
thought about it, but that's my, I'm, I have a,

B.188:  All it takes is a cup full of sugar dumped down your gas tank and it will
ruin the engine. 

A.189:  What, what does that do?

B.190:  It, uh, freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate
sugar does, it turns to like a, a syrupy, like crud. 

A.191:  Okay, just like, just like sugar would, it,

B.192:  Yeah, and, uh, it, it freezes everything up, it scalds, it scalds the
bearings in an engine. 

A.193:  Uh-huh. 

B.194:  It essentially just freezes it up,

A.195:  # Yeah.  #

B.196:  # and # the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it
from bottom out,

A.197:  # Yeah.  #

B.198:  # and # generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to
replace it.

A.199:  Yeah, ugh, well that, maybe that's what happened to it because it had, it
had been fine, but the odd thing about it was is after I had that engine
replaced, that car ran hot.  Every summer, I mean, even though, yes, Texas is
notorious, I mean, we, it's true we have a hundred and eight degree days but,

B.200:  # Um, uh, uh-huh.  #

A.201:  # you know, it, # uh, I had, I had trouble with that car after that.  I
don't know if it was just a lemon, even though it was a brand new engine,

B.202:  # Uh, that's amazing.  #

A.203:  # you know, so, # uh,

B.204:  Might not have been rebuilt properly, or they might have put too high a
degree thermostat in it. 

A.205:  Yeah, course it was a brand new engine, supposedly.  Now that's what the
dealership told me, you know. 

B.206:  Yeah, well even if it was, if they put the wrong size thermostat in it for
the climate you're in it c-, could make it run hotter. 

A.207:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I, I know my, I had, uh, had my dad to-, finally
took it down there because I would take it back and forth and the dealership
would not, it was, I still had the problem it just continued and continued and
they would charge me, you know, two hundred dollars every time they looked at
it. 

B.208:  Uh-huh. 

A.209:  And, um, he kept saying the same thing, he said it seems like it was your
thermostat, but at any rate it was really never rectified,

B.210:  # Huh.  #

A.211:  # and # I told the people that when I sold it to them.  I said, you know,
you, you might need to watch out, but they didn't seem to mind. 

B.212:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.213:  # They # wanted the car, so. 

B.214:  Huh. 

A.215:  You know, as far as my ability to do anything on it, I can check the oil,

B.216:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.217:  # I # know, that's about as far as it goes.  It's been amazing to watch
these guys work on this car, I mean, you know just. 

B.218:  How did you all come to, uh, to, uh, make the seventy-three your your
collector's item, you might say. 

A.219:  Well it just, this, this gentleman had this car and, uh, you know, he had,
he had told my fianc3e that he was going to sell it, I mean he just, I mean he
sold it to us for like three hundred bucks. 

B.220:  # Um.  #

A.221:  # You # know, and, and we took, before we said we'd buy it, we, uh, took it
to a Mercedes dealership and they looked at the engine, and, uh, the engine had
been rebuilt about, uh, I think, the guy had told us two hundred miles
previously or something. 

B.222:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.223:  # An # they said it, you know, the engine alone was worth, you know, much
more than that, so we didn't feel like there was any problem and,

B.224:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.225:  # uh, # it's, it's definitely been amazing to, to see the transformation. 
We took, we took after pictures, it's a shame that we didn't take before
pictures, because,

B.226:  # Oh you should have.  #

A.227:  # yeah, it was just, # uh, as I said, rusted dents and the color was that
dark, dark green that's almost,
