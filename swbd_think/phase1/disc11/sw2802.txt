=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay [breathing]. 

B.2:  So, what do you think is the major cause?  [Breathing]. 

A.3:  Well, I, I definitely think it's our, the cars we drive, and --

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  -- [Breathing] I think, you know, everyone has good intentions and, and
thinks, well, I should car pool and I will and, but [breathing] that we just
have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do,

B.6:  Right.  

A.7:  it's, it's a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a
doctor's appointment or something and they have to get another ride home or
[breathing] you have to arrange, it's just a hassle, [breathing] and I guess
we're not willing to do that.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  But that, to me, is probably the thing that needs to be done or to start
using,

B.10:  Now, do you live,

A.11:  public,

B.12:  in a major city?  

A.13:  [Breathing] D-, Dallas area,    

B.14:  In Dallas,

A.15:  I live in Plano -- 

B.16:  okay. 

A.17:  -- which is just a, a suburb of, of Dallas.  

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  Do you live in a major city?  

B.20:  Uh, I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.  

A.21:  Oh, okay [breathing].

B.22:  And probably not quite as big as Dallas, 

A.23:  No.  

B.24:  but, uh, 

A.25:  [Breathing] Well, myself, I, I go to Richardson, which is a, I teach
school, and so I don't ch-, ch-, commute that far, it's only about four miles,
but [breathing] the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas
to work and, and [breathing] when you're, if you go out on the freeway and you
look you see almost every car is just one passenger.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  [Breathing] And our public transportation system's a joke.

B.28:  Oh. 

A.29:  So, people just don't bother to take that because it's inconvenient.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  [Breathing] We don't have any kind of a, a train or, uh, you know,
anything like some of the big cities do.

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  [Lipsmack] We're supposed to get one but it's, you know, way off the in
the future.  But,

B.34:  Well, yeah. 

A.35:  no, it's just, it,

B.36:  Well, I've found the easiest way is, uh, is to ride bikes, in Raleigh,
anyway, and --

A.37:  Oh, is that right?  

B.38:  -- I used to live in Colorado, and it was even more of a bigger deal there,
but,

A.39:  Sure.

B.40:  uh, [lipsmack] I ride my bike everywhere in town.  Well, there, I
probably wouldn't ride it to the, the opposite side of town, but I can ride it
to downtown with no problem at all.

A.41:  How large is Raleigh?

B.42:  It's about two hundred and fifty thousand. 

A.43:  So, it's pretty big.  Yeah [breathing].  

B.44:  Uh, the diameter of the city is probably, it's got a belt line around it,
which is a, has a diameter of about ten, twelve miles.

A.45:  Uh-huh [breathing].  And so you ride your bike to work and everything or
aren't you,

B.46:  Right.  

A.47:  Well, that's great.  

B.48:  It's about three and a half, four miles.  

A.49:  See, that's, that isn't even, I mean, I'm not sure that a pers-, even a
percentage [laughter] of, of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  You know, I just don't think they do, I never see anybody.  

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  [Breathing] Um, [breathing] another thing that, that I think our, my
family's real conscious of is, is, is to stop using aerosol cans and,

B.54:  Right.   

A.55:  you know, uh, you know, get, find another way instead of,  

B.56:  Yeah, that one's so easy, 

A.57:  you know,

B.58:  I don't know why people won't do it. 

A.59:  I know, it really is.  And we just need not to buy the stuff and those
businesses will have to chan-,

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  you know, the corporations and so forth have to change.  If you don't buy
it, they're not going to make it, so --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- [Breathing] yeah, that is an easy one [breathing].  But, uh, you know,
and I notice probably a lot of, uh, commercial pollution and, [breathing] and
factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days,

B.64:  Yeah,  

A.65:  it's really bad.  

B.66:  you can see it in Raleigh [breathing].  It's ugly [laughter].

A.67:  Yeah, it's awful.  It's nothing like California where the smog is constant,
but,

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  it's still there, and, you know, it, [breathing] if we, I think if we
really realized how much we do breathe in that's unhealthy, we would
immediately do something about it --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- but I don't think people realize how unhealthy the, the air is.

B.72:  Yeah, that's what, you said you're a school teacher?

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Uh, how much, how much education of air pollution and all that do you,

A.75:  Well, I think, I don't, see I only teach English, 

B.76:  Okay.  

A.77:  and, and, uh, but the science teacher, I teach fifth grade and we're
departmentalized, and [breathing] the science teacher does a really big unit
on it,

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  and I think the kids are more informed than adults are,  

B.80:  Yeah, I would,

A.81:  I mean, and,

B.82:  I would agree with that because I've done, actually I've done some
volunteer teaching on, on, uh, ecology and all that,

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  at, at a middle school, 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  and, uh, the, the kids knew, well, the teach-, the science teachers were
pretty sharp too,

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  but the kids, in general, know more than adults do about it. 

A.89:  They do, they do.  And they, and, and I think that they are, [breathing]
they care a little bit more, and I think as adults we need to care, because
it's the,

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  the future for our kids, and I, [breathing] you know, I mean, my kids are
much more aware than I was at their age about things like that, and I think
it's,

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  it's definitely, has to be that,

B.94:  Well, it, probably at your age it wasn't a problem [laughter].

A.95:  No, it really wasn't, it wasn't a problem.  It, I mean, I'm sure it was
beginning to be a problem,

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  but people were, just weren't [breathing] aware of it like they are
today, and I think that's where it has to start with the kids because it's
going to be their world soon,

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  and I think it, [breathing], and, and we're real big on, you know, Plano,
which is a small suburb of Dallas --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- about a hundred thousand [breathing].  Um,  

B.102:  Okay. 

A.103:  I think we're more than that, about a hundred thirty thousand now, but
[breathing], um, they're really trying their best to start recycling,

B.104:  Right.  

A.105:  and things like that, that will, [breathing] and we just, we have
separate garbage collections now for plastics, and cans,

B.106:  Right.

A.107:  and newspaper and, which I think is, I mean, that's, that should be just
a way of life,

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  for everybody, you shouldn't even complain about it, you should just do
it.

B.110:  I think they ought to, well, the way it used to be was that you had, you
had to take your recycles to a special place.

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  It should be the other way around, where [laughter] you have to take your
nonrecyclables to a special place, and then people would,

A.113:  That's true.  

B.114:  would have an incentive [laughter].  

A.115:  You're right.  You're right [breathing].

B.116:  Yeah.  Raleigh has, has curbside recycling, which is really nice.

A.117:  Well, you know, it just has to be when you consider the landfills, we,
we're not going to have any, soon,

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  and it's, it's ridiculous, but [breathing] the thing, the quandary that
I'm in is that, that we had a great big article in, in, in the newspaper last
week about [breathing] I've been real big about going to, to the store and
asking for paper instead of plastic, well,

B.120:  Right.

A.121:  that was really controversial, because some scientists, you know, feel
like plastic, I mean, paper is worse than plastic [breathing].  It's just,
it's just a real, um, debate about which one is,

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  is the best, 

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  really, the best thing to do is to bring, 

B.126:  Your own bag.  

A.127:  um, you know, a cloth bag, yeah [breathing].  

B.128:  I do that sometimes, 

A.129:  Do you?  

B.130:  but I forget a lot [laughter].  

A.131:  Yeah, see that's what I do too.  I forget, and, [breathing] and besides
when I go to the store I have a family, you know, I, I get maybe ten, twelve
bags,

B.132:  Yeah.  

A.133:  of groceries and, you know, it would be a little [laughter] a little
expensive although,

B.134:  I think,

A.135:  you know, I'm sure some,

B.136:  I, I don't know.  I think the paper's still got to be better because, well,
the, the major problem with paper usually is when they bleach it,

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  the dioxins, they just usually end up getting dumped into the water
supply, but, um, the grocery bags, with them being colored or being raw paper,
I don't see that much of a problem as opposed to a petroleum product.  I mean,
tre-, trees can grow back --

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  -- if, if they're handled in the correct way -- 

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  -- but the petroleum products like plastic, I mean, they're going to run
out of oil, what are they going to do?

A.143:  Yes, that's right.

B.144:  It doesn't grow [laughter].

A.145:  That's right.  You're right.  

B.146:  That's where the main, that's where I see that paper's got to be better.

A.147:  Uh-huh [breathing].  Well, you know, and they say that [breathing], you
know, plastic is recyclable, but not that many people use them,

B.148:  No, it's,  

A.149:  again, you know. 

B.150:  and plastic like that is not a hundred percent recyclable, 

A.151:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.152:  it, they lose a lot, and it takes a lot of energy to do it. 

A.153:  Sure, sure, [breathing] I think that, you know, I think that it's
tremendous the research they're doing on all of this,

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  because I think we need to, to know and be more aware of it so we can do
some changing, but [breathing] the majority of people are so lazy about it,

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  that they're not willing to, to sacrifice a little to, 

B.158:  Yeah.

A.159:  to make the world a better place, and it's kind of sad because,
[breathing] especially if you have children, and [breathing] because, you
know, you want your kids and their kids to, [laughter] to be able to,
[breathing] be a part of a,

B.160:  Have a nice place to live, yeah.

A.161:  yeah, a world that's halfway decent, and, [breathing] you know, just in
my lifetime I've seen such a change in the environment, and it's scary because
by the time my kids have kids [breathing] and they're growing up, it's going
to be a completely different world,

B.162:  Yeah.  

A.163:  you know, and it's, it's scary,  

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  so, [breathing] you know, like I, I know that I need to car pool, and I
don't, and, uh, and I, you rationalize and say, Well, I only am four miles
away, and that it's no big deal, and --

B.166:  Yeah.

A.167:  -- well, you know, but,

B.168:  I guess, w-, the, the first step is to find a happy medium.  I mean,
[lipsmack] you could easily say, Well, we should go back to living in caves
[laughter],

A.169:  Yeah [laughter].

B.170:  but no one's going to do that, so I think you need to make compromises
slowly enough people adjust to it.

A.171:  Right, right.

B.172:  #And, uh, not too slowly, but [laughter],#

A.173:  #Well, you know, just,# yeah, just with, with our thing in Plano, it had,
w-, recycling garbage it hasn't, [breathing] it hasn't been that long, and it
was just, uh, really an easy adjustment for most people, but there was a small
percentage that griped and complained and wrote,

B.174:  Yeah.

A.175:  you know, letters to the editor and, you know, like it was some real,

B.176:  Um.

A.177:  great big deal inconvenience, and, [breathing] but it seems to me you
should just be able to give up a little bit to make the world better,

B.178:  Yeah.

A.179:  but some people don't think that so, [breathing] and some people don't,
and some people, I think, really believe, and maybe they're rationalizing, but
[breathing] they really believe that everybody's making a bigger deal out of
the problem, than it is.

B.180:  No way [laughter].

A.181:  And that, and that it's right, no way, it's,

B.182:  Yeah.  

A.183:  it's there, and we've got to face it [breathing].

B.184:  I think they're not making a big enough deal about it [laughter].

A.185:  That's right.  I think in some cases they aren't.  

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  And I see, I wonder, I wonder how much the laws [breathing] that Congress
passed several years ago are really enforced as far as big companies and, 

B.188:  Yeah, well, I think there's a lot of violations that slip under the table.

A.189:  Oh, I think so too, and I think that they're not fined the way they should
be, or they're,

B.190:  Yeah.  

A.191:  they pay them off or whatever, so they can get away with it [breathing].
I, I was born in Ohio,

B.192:  Uh-huh.

A.193:  and [breathing] when, um, [lipsmack] when I was young we, we did a lot of
fishing, and on Lake Erie,

B.194:  Right.

A.195:  and I, [laughter] I mean, when I went back [breathing] I just couldn't
believe the difference, it's just terrible the way it's polluted because of,
[breathing] of big corporations that dump,

B.196:  Right.

A.197:  [Breathing] and, you know, and you just feel so bad, because at one time
it was a wonderful, beautiful lake,

B.198:  Um, I,

A.199:  and now it's a mess.

B.200:  I've never known it to be one [laughter].  I guess [breathing] I'm a
little bit younger than you [laughter].

A.201:  Yeah, I, when I was little my dad had a boat and we would go fishing on
Lake Erie, and it was beautiful.

B.202:  Uh-huh.

A.203:  [Breathing] And [laughter] it's not beautiful anymore,

B.204:  Um.

A.205:  so, and that's,
