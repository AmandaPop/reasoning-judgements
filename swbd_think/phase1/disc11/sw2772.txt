==========================================================================

A.1:  All right. 

B.2:  Okay.  Well, I can go ahead and start and tell you mine and,

A.3:  Okay. 

B.4:  We're from San Antonio and that's where I grew up,

A.5:  # Oh, #

B.6:  # So # I was used to the heat, out here right now,

A.7:  # Yeah.  #

B.8:  # Gosh, # it gets to about seventies, high seventies and it gets very cold
at night. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  And Monterey it's, um, right on the coast.  And, I don't know if your
familiar with California coastline, but we're we're about two hours, about a
two hour drive south of San Francisco,

A.11:  Oh, okay. 

B.12:  And it's, uh, really nice.  It's a big area for people to come from the
different, uh, countries, mostly like Japan, Germany and England.  And they
usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches, so it's, it's pretty nice,
uh, year round.  But, uh, cool, always cool in the evenings.  And warm, warm
in the Summer, but it's stays pretty cold even, uh, during the Winter, for as
nice as it is.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  And, um, we usually get a fog.  Uh, right about, I guess, about four
o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast.  And, uh, then it usually
breaks back off again the next morning.  And if you go just a little bit ways
in, I'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.16:  # uh, # the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and the
fog never makes it that far. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  But along here it's, uh, very [laughter], very different from the Texas
type weather.  What's it like down there?

A.19:  Well, right now we're we're having the little bit of Spring that we have. 

B.20:  Oh, really, well at least you've got some [laughter]. 

A.21:  We don't have many seasons here.  It goes from Winter to Summer, usually. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  Spring usually consists of a lot of rain.  Especially thunderstorms.  We've
got, we had one of those blow through tonight.

B.24:  Oh, well, that's good. 

A.25:  And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three
days. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  So. 

B.28:  Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree,

A.29:  It's gotten up to, uh, ninety a couple of times. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  But, basically, it's been in the low seventies and eighties. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Women, that's good.  For this time of year. 

A.33:  Yeah.  It's not really been too bad. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  Usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier. 

B.36:  Uh-huh.  So do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year?

A.37:  Yeah, quite a bit. 

B.38:  Oh, Uh-huh. 

A.39:  Well, the season is just about over for that, uh, in fact we drove down to
Corpus last week --

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  -- and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along
the way. 

B.42:  Oh, I miss that [laughter]. 

A.43:  (( )) drove through San Antonio and I spoke to somebody else this morning
from San Antonio and were, they had, and we came back.  What day was that,
Sunday evening, and they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the
same thing we're getting now, I guess.

B.44:  Oh.  Oh, well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in
about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just
continued.  At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas.  I'm glad to
hear that [laughter].

A.45:  Yeah.  That's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy
Spring. 

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  We had a pretty rainy Fall last year, as well. 

B.48:  Y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were
you?

A.49:  Um, we've had a few down here, but not anything like Kansas. 

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  But this is the season for that. 

B.52:  Oh, gosh. 

A.53:  They do, they do pop up occasionally,

B.54:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # around # here. 

B.56:  Oh [laughter].  Yeah.  I really don't miss all the heat there. 

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings so we get a bit of a
relief. 

A.59:  Yeah.  I'm from here originally, so when it's July and August, I'm pretty
well used to the,

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # hundred # degree temperatures. 

B.62:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.63:  The biggest problem with, with the weather and the rain in this area is the
soil.  It's that black clay soil. 

B.64:  Oh.  Is that what Dallas is, #okay.  Yeah.# 

A.65:  # You know, it's# not sandy like most of the state is, so it doesn't absorb
the water real well.

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  You know, once it rains a little bit, it's, it's filled up and everything
else just runs off,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # you # know. 

B.70:  Yeah.  San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come.  It's, it's a
complete mess, everything floods, all the under passes. 

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem. 

A.73:  Yeah.  We have it, especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of
years.  And there's a section in South Dallas that's had a whole lot of
flooding problems because of the rain.

B.74:  Uh-huh.  Well, we could use some rain up here.  We're like in the bottom of
the fourth year of drought,

A.75:  # Really.  #

B.76:  # up # here and they had a pretty good early Spring and we got quite a bit
of rain, but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four
years. 

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  And, uh, so they're still talking water rationing this Summer, so it would
seem strange because in San Antonio, we had lived out, um, west of San Antonio,
in Castroville,

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.80:  # And # the water in ((Medina)) Lake and that area was really going down,
that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing and I
thought oh, gee I'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the
California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's
no problem with water.  And then I came here and found out they were in the,
you know, four year draught [laughter].

A.81:  Uh-huh. 

B.82:  So I said, well, gee, this is pretty much like Texas.  And it pretty much
is in the middle of Summer.  They have rolling hills around here but,

A.83:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.84:  # um, # they turn to golden dead grass,

A.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.86:  # for # the majority of the Summer just because there is no water to keep
them green. 

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  But, um, it's a really nice area.  It's just, it's just such a change from,
uh, Texas because I had grown up with, uh, the heat,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # and # used to essentially, like you said, you have the cold Winter and
then you have the hot Summer Spring [laughter]. 

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  And, uh, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round. 
It's kind of like, uh, Spring, I guess, if you, year round, except, and then in
the Winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall,

A.93:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.94:  # year-round.  # So it seems like we only have two Springs which is, or two
seasons and that would be Spring and Fall. 

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  We never really get any of the other ones. 

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  But it's a really nice, uh, change of pace. 

A.99:  I guess I'd prefer that [laughter]. 

B.100:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  To the heat.  I really don't miss the heat. 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  Um, we do a lot of, you know, when you do a lot of outside, like running
and stuff, it's just so much easier,

A.103:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.104:  # up # here and you don't have to worry about the high humidity. 

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  Does Dallas get high humidity? Or is it pretty dry. 

A.107:  It's pretty dry.  We get some when it's this rainy, but it's nothing like,
I guess, San Antonio Summers, ((it's )) nothing like Houston.  {Tape is
cutting out}.

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  (( )) or East Texas, is a little more humid. 

B.110:  Yeah.  It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years,
because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years,

A.111:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.112:  # and # it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid,
more and more humid [laughter].

A.113:  Uh-huh. 

B.114:  And here it's, uh, well it's right by the ocean, but, um, it's not the same
as Corpus.  Corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air. 

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  But here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here, you can lay on the
beach all you want, but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming,
you have to wear a wet suit. 

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  And a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold and I, for
some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always
cool.  It's never humid or sticky or salty feeling, so I really like that
about this area.  And, uh, we just hadn't expected it, we were used to, what,
uh, gulf coast weather was like,

A.119:  # Yeah.  #

B.120:  # when # we came here to Pacific coast weather.  It's just completely
different and it's much nicer.

A.121:  Yeah.  Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference,

B.122:  Uh-huh.  It does and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the
gulf coast region.  But you, um, but we like it so it's a nice change.  So
we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well, we'll take advantage of
it and see what all the Pacific coast is like.

A.123:  That's nice. 

B.124:  So it's been good. 

A.125:  Well, my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine
months and that was a real change for me. 

B.126:  Oh, I imagine.  Virginia, I imagine, gets real humid, doesn't it?

A.127:  Um, parts do.  We, we're over in the western edge in the mountains. 

B.128:  Oh. 

A.129:  And, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, Winter storms, snow
and that type of thing. 

B.130:  Uh-huh. 

A.131:  But they're so good about clearing the roads, that, you know, it doesn't
usually bother you very much. 

B.132:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [laughter].  Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand
still. 

A.133:  Yeah.  Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild, too.  It never gets real,
real hot. 

B.134:  Uh-huh.  I'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina
was sort of like that. 

A.135:  Uh-huh. 

B.136:  And, uh, I've just never really been in that region of the country and I
guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like. 
Because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like
it.  And, uh, they get the snow, but they said it doesn't really get messy and
it doesn't really hang around that long. 

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  So, they, the people I know that are from there, uh, they always miss it
and they want to go back [laughter].  Nothing seems quite as good.  But,
anyway.  Well,

A.139:  Well, as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood
watch and,

B.140:  # Oh, gee-whiz.  #

A.141:  # more rain # for the next three or four days. 

B.142:  Oh, gosh.  Well, I hope it moves up this way, but I'm sure it won't
[laughter]. 

A.143:  Yeah.  Maybe we can send you some [laughter]. 

B.144:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Because we could sure use it.  Well, you think that takes
care of the time and,

@@A.145:  I think that will do it. 

B.146:  Okay.  Well, I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and,
uh,

A.147:  Well, I enjoyed talking with you Lisa,

B.148:  Yeah.  Good luck to you. 

A.149:  Uh-huh.  You, too. 

B.150:  Okay.  We'll see you. 

A.151:  Bye. 

B.152:  Bye.
