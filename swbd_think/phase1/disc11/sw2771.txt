==========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  You know, like you said, I haven't been keeping track of what
all has been going on in Central America, myself, um, and, uh,

B.2:  ((Well, other than the)) Nicaraguan situation where we kicked out the
dictator of that country, and his case is yet to come to trial and all that,

A.3:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.4:  # I # can't say that I've kept up too much with it.  I know that the
Colombians for awhile, we were trying to do something to give them the
incentive to get out of the drug trade.  And there was a lot of assassinations
and killings and that sort of thing going on down there, because they were
trying to cleanup the mobster crowd.

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Uh, but, uh, other than that, the only thing I ever hear about a country
like Brazil or some place like that is advertisements to come enjoy their,
their beaches and the like and what is it, Rio de Janeiro?

A.7:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know what is it your talking about.  Um, I've, I've,
listened to a lot of things going on.  I mean, the Manuel Noriega Panama thing,
I think was probably the right thing to do.  I mean the guy was just blatantly
going out and shooting Americans and,

B.8:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.9:  # and, # uh, so I think what they did there was right.  I'm not so sure
about what they're doing in some of the countries where we're supporting
guerillas that are fighting the communists,

B.10:  Huh-uh. 

A.11:  You know, (( )) that are in there, because it never seems to really work.
You know, we end up throwing in money and a lot of people getting killed and
when push comes to shove, we seem to back out on the gorillas, like we did on
the Kurds like we did in the late seventies.

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  And so that kind of thing concerns me.  Um, it's the things that we're not
doing that we should be doing.  Like right now, there's a big outbreak of, uh,
of course, it's a little further south in South America, but there's an
outbreak of, uh, what is it, cholera.

B.14:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.15:  # Peru # and all, it's gotten into Columbia, now.  And it looks like,

B.16:  # Yeah.  That's right.  #

A.17:  # it's going to # be pretty serious, uh, thing there.  They're talking
about it lasting for ten years.

B.18:  Yeah.  I heard about that.  That's supposed to be sweeping on up to the
Central American countries, too. 

A.19:  Yeah.  And it's already gotten into Brazil a little bit.  And it has to do
with the fact, I mean, in that part of the world, they just dump raw sewage
right into the rivers.

B.20:  Huh-uh. 

A.21:  I mean, things that we don't do here anymore because we know how bad it is
for you. 

B.22:  Huh-uh. 

A.23:  Yet, they're, they're, you know, they're steadily doing it now. 

B.24:  Their filtration systems, I guess, haven't kept up with the pace. 

A.25:  They actually don't have filtration systems. 

B.26:  Oh. 

A.27:  Some of the major cities do.  Um, but for the most part, most of those
countries flat out pump it right into the rivers and let it float on down and
pump it right out into the ocean. 

B.28:  Huh-uh. 

A.29:  And that's, that is how they deal with it.  And, you know, they're just
steadily polluting that part of the, part of the world that way. 

B.30:  Huh-uh. 

A.31:  Um, the other thing is the economic assistance. 

B.32:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.33:  Right now we're starting, we're starting to have free trade with Mexico. 

B.34:  Right. 

A.35:  And my God this is something we should have done years ago and Mexico is
our closest neighbor.  They've been in financial trouble for years.

B.36:  Huh-uh. 

A.37:  And I think we've exploited them.  I mean, when I was in Texas, I noticed
that, you know, you think, uh, of Texas and you have good meat and fresh
vegetables and all that,

B.38:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.39:  # well, # most of the vegetables they sold in Texas came from Mexico and so
did the meat. 

B.40:  Huh-uh. 

A.41:  The meat that was raised in Texas, they sent back east to sell because they
had get more money for it. 

B.42:  Huh-uh. 

A.43:  And, uh,

B.44:  Well, I ((don't)) think I agree with you.  I think you're right, we have
exploited, but, I think that the leadership that Mexico has had up until, for
some phenomenally lucky reason, has been a rather than corrupt, um, feudalistic
type of leadership, everybody sort of on the take.  Sort of like the way, uh,
the, uh, uh, what was that bunch that used to run the Philippines?

A.45:  Yeah.  The Marcos. 

B.46:  Yeah.  Yeah, so that sort of thing.  And the guy they got in this last
time, uh, he for once is a tried and true and really, you know, outright
capitalist from the word go.

A.47:  Huh-uh. 

B.48:  And he wants to take the government off the peoples backs and really get
free enterprise started.  And I was reading, I think in NEWSWEEK or TIME or one
of those or U S NEWS WORLD REPORTS, one of those mags, that, uh, uh, they were
having a tough time with the peasant farmer situation, being able to compete
with American farming industry because we have these huge conglomerates,

A.49:  Right. 

B.50:  Well, he went out using the governments, uh, uh, finances or whatever you
call it.  He went out and, and gathered together a lot of the farmers who had
small farms inside one another and he pulled together sort of like a commune,

A.51:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.52:  # but, # yet he let's them each be a free enterprise, uh, uh, person, but
they work together in terms of what they organize to grow.  And they grow
massive amounts of things that are common to each other in certain areas and
yet they vary their crops in such a way that they, they, uh, can be very
productive in how much of these crops they make, but they can also roll them
over and then they mark it altogether as a group, as a force.

A.53:  Huh-uh. 

B.54:  And, as a result, uh, it said that since they started the program, of
course, it went sort of, kind of, kind of rough at first, but apparently since
they got the program going, that they, uh, the amount of money and the, uh, uh,
profit and standard of living, that they're able to, to reap from it, has gone
up almost tenfold from this. 

A.55:  That's great. 

B.56:  And so this guy may be actually going to finely turn the, uh, the country
on.  I mean, it's always been tough for the southern, lower latitude countries
to be as productive as the higher latitude countries.  I've often wondered if
that does have something to do with the, the climate being, uh, so warm that it
tends to make work harder to do. 

A.57:  Huh-uh. 

B.58:  I don't know.  But it does seem like there has always been a preponderance
of countries in the middle latitude zones that seem to always lack in their
ability to, to develop industrially as well as, even agriculturally. 

A.59:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That probably has some bearing on it.  Um, there is always a
tradition of just doing enough to get by. 

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  They're not as motivated as, uh,

B.62:  # Right.  #

A.63:  # as # we are.  And people farther south. 

B.64:  Huh-uh. 

A.65:  Now, you know, once you, you get down into Chile and Argentina and those
kinds of areas,

B.66:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.67:  # their # climates are pretty much the same as ours. 

B.68:  Huh-uh.  Yeah.  And they have been, they have had spurts at times, I know.
I think it was Chile, uh, that has been fairly capitalistic, that have spurts
of times where they do rather well.

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  And then they sort of reverse because they have some sort of a military
take over or something like that and they go into a dictatorship for awhile
and, and it would just sort of go downhill.  But, uh, uh, I don't know if they
don't seem to be able to keep any particular stable regime for any particular
long period of time in their capitalistic type governments.

A.71:  Yeah.  And while we're sitting here talking about it, I'm thinking.  You
know, we know every darn thing that goes on in Europe,

B.72:  # Yeah.  #

A.73:  # you # know.  I mean, we know what's going on in Poland, we know what's
going on in Rumania, we know the Germanies are getting back together, we
didn't, you know we all know what's going in Europe, but we never here
anything about what's going on, you know, in South and Central America.

B.74:  Yeah.  Unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of
proportion like it did for awhile. 

A.75:  Or unless we're sending thousands of troops down to kick somebody's butt,

B.76:  That's right, or unless they're kicking the British's butts, [laughter]
like they did in the Falkland Islands, something like that where it involves
one of our allies,

A.77:  Yeah.  We just don't pay any attention to them. 

B.78:  You're right and, um, wonder why that is?

A.79:  It's, it's, you know, it's, it just doesn't make any sense.  I mean we're
in the same hemisphere, so to speak.  I mean, you know, the same side of the
earth, I mean,

B.80:  Could it possibly be because of the, the little third world countries, and
they are all independent from one another where as if they had somehow or
another, from their past history, formed into a larger country like our
continental U S did, and, uh, developed, uh, uh, a free enterprise capitalistic
type of economy with a common form of government, that they could have, uh, uh,
been a force in the world, though. 

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  I don't know, I ask what, what went wrong, what was different.  They
certainly have the climates in the southern hemisphere, uh, uh, to have been
easily as productive.  And I certainly think they have rich enough land.  I
don't think, uh, the continental South America, as I recall my geography,

A.83:  # Yeah.  #

B.84:  # that's # along time ago, as being any particularly different or, or,
lacking in terms of agricultural or industrial or river, rivers that were
naturally there or so forth, that they could not have developed a pretty, uh,
uh, by today's standards, modern type of economy. 

A.85:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, it doesn't, it really doesn't make sense to me.  I
don't know, you know, it's, I mean, they've never really been a real force in
the world.  I mean, uh, we heard about Argentina only when it tried to take
over the, Falcons,

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  And England had to go down there and kick their butt. 

B.88:  Huh-uh. 

A.89:  Um, so it's, it's like really strange that we never pay that much
attention.  I, I, you know, I just find myself lacking in a lot of knowledge
about South America. 

B.90:  Huh-uh.  Huh-uh. 

A.91:  I'd like to think I know a lot about a lot of things, but you know, I have,
something is amiss here,

B.92:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.93:  # as # far as, as the amount of information that's available. 

B.94:  Huh-uh. 

A.95:  Uh, I don't know if it's intentional on the part of, you know, the powers
that be or whether no body really cares. 

B.96:  I think that's kind of it.  I mean, I certainly don't tend to think about
it, like out of the site out of mind, uh, myself, uh, in general unless there's
some sort of a controversial thing going on that either affects me or the
country at large, one way or the other politically,
