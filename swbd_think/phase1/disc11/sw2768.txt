==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Um, I don't have any, I guess, definite views about elderly care. 
Um, the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you
see,

B.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.3:  # where # elderly people are abused and things like that. 

B.4:  Yeah. 

A.5:  I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my
grandmother or my mother, uh, in some sort of home.  The first thing that I
would look at would be their history. 

B.6:  Right. 

A.7:  As far as any court cases that came out of there, um, the history of, you
know, their doctors, um, their nurses, and things like that. 

B.8:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree with you.  I, um, a group that I'm a part of goes
once a month to a, um, they call it the Heritage House.

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  It's, it's a nursing home for elderly people. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape. 

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  A lot of them have had, um, limbs amputated, or, um, have serious
illnesses. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  You know, that kind of thing.  And, um, I watched, the interesting thing
was I watched this particular one change hands.  It started out just being a
terrible place for the people,

A.17:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.18:  # and # then a new company bought it,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # and # came in and remodeled the whole place. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  Hired new nurses and, uh, just really, just redid it, you know. 

A.23:  Just out of curiosity, what, what kinds of things were they doing when they
were considered a bad place?

B.24:  Well, to me, it was dirty, for one thing. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  Uh, when you would walk in, the smell was just,

A.27:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.28:  # awful.  # The, you know, the floors, you could just,

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # if # you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  Um, there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in
their beds hollering and, you know, crying,

A.33:  Oh, my goodness. 

B.34:  Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right
mind. 

A.35:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.36:  # or # how many were,

A.37:  In pain or something. 

B.38:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just really don't know, but I feel like they were
neglected. 

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  And, um, yeah, that was what I was going to say.  It sounds like just
neglect all over. 

A.41:  Right. 

B.42:  You know, neglect to cleanup. 

A.43:  Right. 

B.44:  I don't really think anyone was being, you know, cruel or,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # or # trying to mistreat them or anything.  I just think they were not
doing anymore, you know, than they had to do.  And, um, just kind of letting
everybody live in a not very good environment [laughter]. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  But this new company came in and they, like I said, they remodeled the
place. 

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  And it smells nice when you walk in.  And it looks nice.  And they got like
several new color T V's for the people,

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  And redid the dining room, where they made it, you know, a lot more place
for them to be. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  They made a little patio area where they can go outside. 

A.55:  That's great. 

B.56:  Yeah.  Just, you know, small things that make it seem a lot more homey. 

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  Yeah.  And it's like, it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of
just, uh,

A.59:  I would, I would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or
anyone is in a home like that.  And my biggest fear would, that they would be,
is that they would be lonely. 

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of
activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room,

B.62:  # Right.  #

A.63:  # You # know.  Just makes, just brightens and, and,

B.64:  # Right.  #

A.65:  # and # just makes them, just a little more active.  Television,

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  They can go outside and, just to know that they're not, you know, laying in
a room,

B.68:  # Right.  #

A.69:  # looking # at gray walls.  You know,

B.70:  # Exactly.  #

A.71:  # that, # that's what would just really kill me. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  I'd like to know that, you know, they have friends there,

B.74:  # Right.  #

A.75:  # and # they have little conversations and things. 

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and,

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  maybe some kind of, of activity, little field trips or something. 

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  I don't know how they would do that.  But,

B.82:  Well, they, uh, this place that we visit, it's really neat.  They have,
everyday, they have schedules of groups that come in. 

A.83:  Uh-huh. 

B.84:  And they will do bingo.  Our group does a church service once a month. 

A.85:  Uh-huh. 

B.86:  And then other groups come in and do the services, you know, other Sundays,

A.87:  Uh-huh. 

B.88:  So that they have at least one service every Sunday. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  So there are a lot of things.  There are places that have a lot of things
for them to do.  But you really do have to kind of seek it out, you know,

A.91:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.92:  # and # make sure that it's not a place like this one was [laughter]. 

A.93:  I didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that.  That's,

B.94:  # Yeah.  #

A.95:  # really # neat. 

B.96:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's real nice.  And, um, I know our church does it
and there are a lot of other churches, and they are just like civic
organizations,

A.97:  # Right.  #

B.98:  # that # do. 

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  And, uh, I have other friends.  It's kinds of neat, they take animals over
and let the people pet them. 

A.101:  Oh. 

B.102:  Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all
up,

A.103:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.104:  # and # make sure it's, it's a friendly animal,

A.105:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.106:  # you # know.  And take it in and let, just let the old elderly people pet
the dogs. 

A.107:  That's great. 

B.108:  Yeah. 

A.109:  That will be something, you know, they would look forward to if they knew,
you know, that the puppy is coming on Wednesday. 

B.110:  Yeah. 

A.111:  You know, that would be something to look for.  That's really neat. 

B.112:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.113:  That really is. 

B.114:  I thought that was a real unusual thing,

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  for someone to do.  So, yeah, there's a lot that can be done. 

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  It's just a matter of people not being lazy. 

A.119:  Right. 

B.120:  And, you know, doing the best they can.  Again, I don't know what I'd do if
it was my own mother or grandmother,

A.121:  # Yeah.  #

B.122:  # you # know. 

A.123:  Putting any of my family in an elderly home, to me would be the very last
resort. 

B.124:  Right. 

A.125:  You know, it, um, and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're
trying to, to work or trying to take care of your own family,

B.126:  # Right, #

A.127:  # it's # kind of hard to, to because an elderly person sometimes can be
totally dependent,

B.128:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.129:  # you # know, on you.  And I know that's hard sometimes and,

B.130:  # Yeah.  #

A.131:  # but # it would really have to be a last resort,

B.132:  # Yeah.  #

A.133:  # because # that would just, I would feel so guilty. 

B.134:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would, too. 

A.135:  I don't know.  Unless I knew that they were somewhere, just really, I mean,
just really great. 

B.136:  Yeah, right. 

A.137:  You know, that they were really enjoying. 

B.138:  Yeah.  I know.  I know what you mean. 

A.139:  I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home. 

B.140:  Yeah.  Well, I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people
because, um, many of them, of course, their minds are not good. 

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story, you know,

A.143:  # Yeah.  Yeah.  #

B.144:  # every time # I visit them. 

A.145:  Yeah. 

B.146:  They'll reminisce about childhood,

A.147:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.148:  # and # tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it's
the same thing, you know,

A.149:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.150:  # that, # just somebody to listen to them. 

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  Uh, just seems to make them really feel good. 

A.153:  Nod your head and smile at them. 

B.154:  Right.  I'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for, there's a guy at
this particular one I go to,

A.155:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.156:  # that # I think that he's really an intelligent person,

A.157:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.158:  # but # he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate. 

A.159:  Uh-huh. 

B.160:  And, um, he's blind and he has seizures, you know,

A.161:  Uh-huh. 

B.162:  I mean, he's just like in a world of his own, and yet he wants so much,

A.163:  # Right.  #

B.164:  # to # be around people.  And if you come over to him, if he can touch your
hand, he'll grab it and kiss it. 

A.165:  Oh. 

B.166:  Oh, and he's always got a smile.  I mean, he really tries to, brighten up
your life.  Oh, it's just amazing. 

A.167:  Oh. 

B.168:  But he can't say anything.  He can just kind of make noises. 

A.169:  That's something, that, if I had to work in an elderly home, I don't think
I could do it.

B.170:  Yeah. 

A.171:  Like I, I would really like to be a teacher,

B.172:  Yeah. 

A.173:  But I don't think I could do it.  Because I'm very, very emotional. 

B.174:  Me, too. 

A.175:  And the minute, I mean, the minute something happens,

B.176:  # Yeah.  #

A.177:  # I # cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials. 

B.178:  I know. 

A.179:  That's just the end of me. 

B.180:  I know. 

A.181:  And so I mean something real life, I just,

B.182:  Uh-huh. 

A.183:  I interview a lot of children, I'm an education reporter,

B.184:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.185:  # and # I always go and do an education things. 

B.186:  Uh-huh. 

A.187:  I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right.

B.188:  Yeah. 

A.189:  And all the sudden, they're in this program.  They're making straight A's,
they're going to graduate early,

B.190:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.191:  # and # I'm just, I just want to hug them,

B.192:  # Yeah.  #

A.193:  # and # go, you are just fantastic. 

B.194:  Yeah. 

A.195:  And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that,

B.196:  Oh, yeah. 

A.197:  And those people, they're so sweet and,

B.198:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.199:  # and # so genuine,

B.200:  Uh-huh. 

A.201:  You know, and all they want is just for everything to be happy,

B.202:  # Yeah.  #

A.203:  # and # you know,

B.204:  Yeah. 

A.205:  And so that would probably just tear me apart. 

B.206:  Oh, it does. 

A.207:  I mean, in a good way, but,

B.208:  Yeah. 

A.209:  You know. 

B.210:  Yeah, it is, it's really hard and,

A.211:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.212:  # But # one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our
kids.  I have a three year old and a six year old,

A.213:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.214:  # and # they, um, have gotten comfortable being around these people,

A.215:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.216:  # because # they've always gone with us,

A.217:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.218:  # and # the people love them. 

A.219:  I'm sure. 

B.220:  And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand and,
so far, my kids will do it.  Just real easily,

A.221:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.222:  # and # I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,

A.223:  # Yeah.  #

B.224:  # and # they've never been afraid.  But that's something, to me children,

A.225:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.226:  # you # know, need to, people need to take groups of children,

A.227:  Right. 

B.228:  [Laughter]  Because the kids just brighten up their lives. 

A.229:  Yeah. 

B.230:  As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here.  I want
to see her [laughter].  I would love to hold her. 

A.231:  And children, I mean, usually a (( )) of elderly people like to, they like
to, uh, share their experiences with the,

B.232:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.233:  # with # the younger children.  They'll be telling them all kinds of
stories. 

B.234:  # Yeah.  #

A.235:  # that # they don't even know what they mean. 

B.236:  That's true. 

A.237:  You know, they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it. 

B.238:  Yeah. 

A.239:  And I'm sure I'll be like that, too. 

B.240:  Well, me, too. 

A.241:  Yeah. 

B.242:  Yeah.  It's quite an experience. 

A.243:  But, that's great.  I didn't know there were such groups. 

B.244:  Yeah.  Yeah there are.  And, and, uh, it really helps those people, I
think. 

A.245:  Uh-huh. 

B.246:  But, like you said, I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put
any of my own family members there. 

A.247:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

B.248:  It would be a last resort. 

A.249:  And I would hate it if anyone put me in one. 

B.250:  Oh, I know.  I'm always afraid like, oh, no, what if I lose my mind. 

A.251:  Yeah. 

B.252:  Am I going to end up in a place like that [laughter]?

A.253:  [Laughter]  Somebody take care of me. 

B.254:  Yeah, that's right. 

A.255:  Okay. 

B.256:  Well. 

A.257:  Okay, well, nice to talk to you. 

B.258:  Yeah.  You, too, ((Tonya)). Thanks for calling. 

A.259:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye. 

B.260:  Bye.
