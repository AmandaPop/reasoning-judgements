========================================================================

B.1:  So, do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work?

A.2:  Well, I do a little bit.  I just do mainly, you know, change the oil and,
uh, I'll do an occasional tune-up, things like that.  [Breathing] change set
of disc brakes, but most of the stuff I have done [breathing].  I just don't
have time to fool with it or, [breathing] you know, it's just out of my
technical expertise.

B.3:  Yeah.  Do you have like an American or foreign car?

A.4:  One of each. 

B.5:  Okay. 

A.6:  A foreign and, uh, and I have a, a truck. 

B.7:  Because I know, like I've got a, a Honda and, and it's just beyond even my,
my dad's and my husband's comprehension, a lot of that stuff.  They grew up
with Americans, little simpler --

A.8:  Yeah. 

B.9:  -- arrangements on, under the hood.  So, so they'll change the oil for me
and, um, that's about it these days. 

A.10:  Yeah.  I don't work on anything foreign. 

B.11:  Yeah.  It's, it's,

A.12:  Well, you've got to have a different set of tools for it and everything
else too.  So,

B.13:  You have to have metric don't you?

A.14:  Yeah, metric,

B.15:  # Yeah.  #

A.16:  # well, # even, even some American cars have that now, but, uh, [breathing]
uh, they're still a little bit over all simpler, you know, to work on, but,

B.17:  # Yeah.  #

A.18:  # uh, # [breathing]  I feel like i-, if I can afford to have it done, I'm
going to have it done. 

B.19:  [Breathing] Well, it's, it's a lot easier than getting under there and
finding out something major has happened that you didn't know about, and
Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago, and --

A.20:  Yeah. 

B.21:  -- getting into that kind of hassle. 

A.22:  [Throat_clearing]  Well, have you had anything done to yours lately? Or,

B.23:  [Noise]  Yeah, I had, um, I was having problems with the cruise control. 

A.24:  Uh-huh. 

B.25:  So I had to take it down and have them look at that, and they said it was
something with the, um, the way the choke was adjusted. 

A.26:  Yeah, automatic choke. 

B.27:  Yeah. 

A.28:  [Breathing]  How much did that cost you to have that fixed?

B.29:  [Breathing] Well, I had the, um, like the sixty thousand mile tune-up done
at the same time, [breathing] so the whole thing was like two hundred dollars.

A.30:  Yeah [breathing].  It's not cheap like it used to be. 

B.31:  No.  It, I mean, the first time I found out how much it was going to be I
about fell over.

A.32:  Yeah,

B.33:  But,

A.34:  I've had, uh, we have a Volvo, and, uh, I had some steering problems, and
it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly.

B.35:  Holy cow. 

A.36:  And by the time I got everything done it was twelve hundred bucks. 

B.37:  Wow [breathing]. 

A.38:  [Laughter] So, something, something that small and that minor, uh, well, it
was not really minor, but something that small [breathing] can cost that much
money.

B.39:  Was it, is it a fairly new car,

A.40:  [Chiming]  {Sounds like a  clock in the background}.

B.41:  I mean, was it,

A.42:  Well, it's five years old, but,

B.43:  # Well, that's still, #

A.44:  # but still it # doesn't have that many miles.  It's got, uh, [\chiming]
just over sixty-five thousand miles on it, and rack and pinion steerings,
[breathing] uh, I don't think I've ever heard of one going out.

B.45:  I know I haven't, the little bit I know about cars, I've never heard of
anybody having that happen to them. 

A.46:  [Breathing] The, uh, the guy that I talked to that replaced it, he said, I
just, he said, we've never really had to replace one [breathing].  We've had
to go in and do some adjustments, but never replace one.  But the actual gear
teeth on this one had, had broken.

B.47:  Man. 

A.48:  So, I think it was a de-, defect, and I tried to get the Volvo Corporation
to cover it, but they just refused to do it. 

B.49:  Did they?

A.50:  [Breathing] So I just, rather than get tied up in, in a bunch of, you know,
garbage, I just went ahead and, and got it done, and, and to heck with it.

B.51:  Yeah. 

A.52:  [Breathing] But, uh, and then the, the truck I have, I have, uh, I've had
just virtually excellent luck with it, [breathing] and other than taking in
for just regular warranty work and things like that, it's, it's been a real
good truck.

B.53:  Well, I've, the only two cars I've had, I had a Honda Civic,

A.54:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.55:  # and # it was, let's see, uh, I'm trying to think how old it was.  I got
it in eighty-one and got rid of it in eighty-eight.  So it was seven years old
and had almost a hundred thousand miles on it.

A.56:  They're good cars. 

B.57:  Yeah.  And I, I mean, I never had any problem with it, and I've got an
Accord now, and other than, you know, minor tune-ups, like with the, the choke
and stuff, I've never had any problem with it.  So I've been really lucky. 

A.58:  I had a, I had a Honda Accord, uh, it was a, [breathing]  trying to think
what year it was, uh, I think it was an eighty-eight or eighty-seven,

B.59:  # Mine was an eighty-eight.  #

A.60:  # eighty-seven.  And, uh, it's # the, the, was the L X I with the, the fuel
injection. 

B.61:  Yeah. 

A.62:  Is that what you have?

B.63:  No, I've, I've got the L X [breathing]. 

A.64:  ((Well,)) I think it still has fuel injection.  There's, I think the D X is
the one that does not. 

B.65:  Okay. 

A.66:  [Breathing]  But, uh, they are probably one of the nicest running cars I've
ever driven.  They run good and they're, and they're peppy. 

B.67:  Yeah [noise].  And this one's, you said yours was just now about sixty-five
[\noise]  thousand, and mine's an eighty-eight and it's, it just turned over
seventy [laughter]  thousand,

A.68:  # Yeah, well, #

B.69:  # so [breathing].  #

A.70:  I, I will, I don't, I don't think I'd ever buy another Volvo.  I bought it
mainly, uh, for my wife and daughter for safety --

B.71:  Yeah. 

A.72:  -- more than anything, and I thought well, it'd be an investment, we'll be
able to keep it for ten or twelve years --

B.73:  Sure. 

A.74:  -- [Breathing]  and, uh, I, I don't think I'd buy another one, only because
the maintenance costs are very, very high. 

B.75:  Yeah. 

A.76:  And that's just a little bit out of my range.  It's enough just to buy it
without, uh, having the other problems,

B.77:  # One th-, #

A.78:  # but, uh, # [breathing]  I will definitely go ba-, go to, uh, [lipsmack] 
now go back to Honda or Mazda or something like that next time. 

B.79:  [Breathing]  We've been looking recently just, you know, mainly window
shopping but, um, we've been thinking more American, just,

A.80:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.81:  # because # we want a bigger car this time. 

A.82:  Uh-huh. 

B.83:  And we've been looking at, um, [lipsmack] Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis,
and we're leaning a little bit towards the, uh, Grand Marquis as far as just
looks, but my parents have a, um, Continental, and they've had nothing but
nightmares with that car.

A.84:  Oh, really?

B.85:  It's been, it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local
dealer either says there's nothing wrong, it's your imagination or says, well,
it's supposed to be that way, just get used to it.  It's been an absolute
nightmare for them. 

A.86:  Um. 

B.87:  So, it kind of makes me dread going back to an American manufacturer. 

A.88:  [Breathing] That's been, I think until they get the reliability [breathing]
up, I don't, you know, other than trucks, I've had, always had good luck with
American trucks, but with cars I, I've not had much luck with, uh, American
cars, especially General Motors [breathing].

B.89:  Yeah. 

A.90:  But, uh, [breathing] you know, I look at reliability and, and you know,
like, stuff like tires and, and belts and stuff like that [breathing], uh,
actually, you can buy the parts cheaper,

B.91:  # Sure.  #

A.92:  # for # foreign cars, if you buy them and put them in yourself. 

B.93:  Yeah [noise]. 

A.94:  But if you have to have it done, of course, it ends up costing you the
installation fee, but [breathing]  I have had, if I had to say dollar for
dollar,

B.95:  # [Noise]  Uh-huh.  #

A.96:  # spending on # foreign and as opposed to, to American, I spent far less on
the foreign cars. 

B.97:  [/Noise]  I believe that. 

A.98:  Long-term, a lot, a lot more.  And then, then you add the, the fuel savings
on top of it. 

B.99:  Yeah. 

A.100:  [Breathing] So, my money's on foreign cars until, Amer-, until the American
cars can, can meet the standards.

B.101:  I wish there were bigger foreign cars really.  It seems like #they kind
of,#

A.102:  #[Breathing] Well,# that, that's interesting that you say that, because if
you'll start looking now at some of the Hondas, and some of the Mazdas, and,
and [breathing] a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up,

B.103:  # Really? #

A.104:  # you # know, like the, the Lexus. 

B.105:  Yeah. 

A.106:  [Breathing]  See, those cars if, if you'll go look at them, they're as big
as some of the General Motors cars. 

B.107:  I hadn't,

A.108:  # If you, #

B.109:  # really even, #

A.110:  if you put them side by side,

B.111:  # Yeah.  #

A.112:  # and # I, I didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out, and he
says, Well, if you'll look and see what's happening, [lipsmack] foreign cars
[breathing] are able to keep the same ga-, or keep, keep good gas mileage,
good reliability, but they're scaling up.  Whereas, the Americans now are
scaling down [breathing] and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore
[breathing].  So, the J-, the Japanese have, have definitely beat us in both
sides of the game.

B.113:  Yeah. 

A.114:  [Breathing]  They, they thought, you know, build them small, cheap, a-, you
know, and, and little repair [breathing]  and, you know, get them hooked, and
then start slowly,

B.115:  # Moving them up.  #

A.116:  # adding stuff on # [breathing] and people like the reliability, but they
also like the size.  And now they're sizing up, they've got the reliability,
and they've got the gas mileage, [breathing] you know?

B.117:  And I don-, I don't think people mind too much taking the car in for a
tune-up, you know, just general fifteen thousand mile maintenance or, or even
getting the oil changed, if they know that they're not going to have any other
major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that. 

A.118:  That's right.  And with American cars and the warranties you don't know. 

B.119:  What did they used to say Ford stood for? Fix or repair daily? [Laughter]. 

A.120:  Yeah.  Expect I've got a Ford truck, and I know a lot of people that have
Ford trucks, [breathing]  and really they're very maintenance free. 

B.121:  Well, that's great. 

A.122:  From, I now I, I, I'm speaking only from trucks. 

B.123:  I wonder why they can't extend the truck's, you know, reliability out to
the cars?

A.124:  [Lipsmack], 

B.125:  # I mean, I don't know.  #

A.126:  # [Breathing] I don't know.  That's # su-, surprising because, [breathing]
you know, everybody I know that has a Ford car has had nothing but trouble
with it, but the-, they have a Ford truck and they're, they're virtually, uh,
flawless.

B.127:  #That's weird.# 

A.128:  #The, uh,# the undercarriage and everything else, if you put them next to a
Chevy or, or another type of truck, uh, American truck, you can't even come
close to a Ford.

B.129:  Really?

A.130:  And, uh, that's why I buy Ford trucks.  Mine runs like a top.  It, it,
I've, like I say, I've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking
in for normal maintenance [breathing] and, uh, and I, I put over a hundred
miles a day on it --

B.131:  Man. 

A.132:  -- and I've never, I've never had trouble with it. 

B.133:  That's great. 

A.134:  So, I'll buy Ford trucks, but I'll buy foreign cars. 

B.135:  I think they need to, uh, take a look at and see what they can't figure out
what the catch is there. 

A.136:  I know.  It's, it's, it's kind of, kind of crazy, but [breathing]  I don't
know, but, but until they, until they meet the standards that, you know, that
I'm used to, anyway, that I'll, I'll buy what, whatever I get, you know, that's
best for my money. 

B.137:  Yeah.  And, you know, like I said, I've had, I've had great luck with the
Hondas, and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's,

A.138:  # Yeah.  #

B.139:  # you # know, you're not sure what you're going to get when you change. 

A.140:  They're, they're good cars.  I, I, I will say that you probably made a good
choice,

B.141:  # Yeah.  #

A.142:  # in # that one [breathing].  But how about, have you had tires changed on,
on that car?

B.143:  I had the, um, tires changed at fifty-two,

A.144:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.145:  # thousand.  #

A.146:  Uh-huh. 

B.147:  They'd, they'd started to, to look pretty bald. 

A.148:  [Lipsmack]  Did you put the same kind of tires back on it? Did you,

B.149:  No, um, let's see, I had,
