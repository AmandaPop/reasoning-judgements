=============================================================================

A.1:  Do you own a P C?

B.2:  Yeah, I do, I own a, um, I own an, I, an X T clone.  It's a Samsung and,
uh, with a Hyundai monitor, monochrome monitor that I just keep at home for
work.

A.3:  Yeah. 

B.4:  And acts as a terminal for me, because I'm a graduate student and I log out
of school from there. 

A.5:  Oh good.  What are you taking in school?

B.6:  I'm a graduate student in psychology, yeah, I do, uh, language acquisition
work. 

A.7:  Um. 

B.8:  But, it's, it's, it's very helpful, it's nice to have a machine at home
that I can use locally, for things like writing and so forth, but I don't,

A.9:  # Oh, it, it's, uh, ideal for that.  #

B.10:  # Yeah, and then I don't need a # printer,

A.11:  Word processing part is, is extremely useful, I think. 

B.12:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't need a printer or anything, because I just sort of, I
can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone
lines, so.  How about you, do you have, um, a P-,

A.13:  Uh-huh.  An, an P S E. 

B.14:  Okay, I know it. 

A.15:  And, I've been used to working, and this my first years, but all of the
work that I do is plus getting to know it a little bit better.  They're
powerful little rascals.

B.16:  Yeah, P S T general architecture? There'll better we just bought it last
year, and they, um, there are some slight differences between those and other
machines I'm finding.  Oh, it fine, I actually don't, I haven't actually
noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else, actually,

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  Um, you know, in, in, in terms of performing faster or better or anything,
I'm not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else
is, with the possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built
in the back.

A.19:  Yeah [laughter].  I'd, I've noticed, uh, there was some scattered at work.
And I notice the, uh, through put is much faster on mine than, than those, but
I think it's just because of the, the lower level in expectation out of them,
that the processing speed is much faster on, uh, the same canned programs.

B.20:  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  Um, it's, it's, although it's funny, because I
just, I just had to discuss one of our machines because it's just too slow. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  Somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of, of
memor-, of, of ram and one with only one. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  And we're running this new version of Lotus, I don't know if you've ever
seen this or not, you know,

A.25:  Or performed to, uh, eighty per cent expectation, anyway. 

B.26:  That's true, actually, I, um, I found that this particular version three of
Lotus one two three actually, I think performs maybe even in the high ninety
per cent of what I'm expecting at this point, I U,

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  I'm, I'm, it's, it's, it's because I'm new enough at it yet, that I haven't
figured everything out.

A.29:  What was your first exposure to the computer?

B.30:  [Clicking]  My first exposure was, I guess when I was an undergraduate, um,
a couple of years ago we had, they, they inundated us with MacIntoshes. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  They brought a bunch of Macs into, uh, there must have been some sort of
program and they brought MacIntoshes in for us to for the school to do, you
know, for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and,

A.33:  Right.  Is there an undergraduate requirement on them?

B.34:  No, there, there never was an undergraduate requirement, it just, everyone
really, everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them
available, and,

A.35:  What about all the majors? Are there any, such as business, or, uh, or
other undergraduate majors.  Do they require it of any of them?

B.36:  Uh, I'm not sure, they must have.  They didn't in my case, I was a Psych
major, and they didn't, I know that here they're required of some, of, of, um,
where I am now,

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  they require it of, of actually a number of different, uh, majors.  You
know, um, some Psychologists people, Psychology can take that in lieu of other
courses, and people in business have to, uh, I think are supposed, and people
in cognitive science definitely have to.

A.39:  Well, actually it's expanded your field too, because the psychology of, of
man working with machine, is [laughter]  is a whole new element that,

B.40:  Oh, yeah.  I, I actually, um, you said, you said you work on mainframes a
lot. 

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  That's a lot of what I do is on a, a SUN.  I don't know if you work on SUNs
at all, um, so SUN Micro System machine, which is another mainframe in a type
of a mainframe.  We do lots of, um, sort of brain, you know, neural network
modeling,

A.43:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.44:  on, on, on a, on a lot of mainframe machines, so yeah, this is, been a lot
of expanding and having, to be able to have things at home, and, and to study
the interaction too, has been wonderful. 

A.45:  Yeah, it's interesting.  I think, uh, I've, I've worked with computers
since nineteen sixty.

B.46:  Wow. 

A.47:  Yeah, I'm an old man [laughter]. 

B.48:  Well, no, I mean, wow, they must have been very different back then. 

A.49:  No, they were.  The I B M six fifty took up a whole room, as a vacuum tube,
uh, machine, and it was bi-, quinary.  Um, base five. 

B.50:  Uh, uh, wow, why base five?

A.51:  I have no idea [laughter].  I didn't, never did learn why, but it was a
base five, which is very interesting.

B.52:  God, so you've really watched the whole, the whole thing grow. 

A.53:  Oh, it's been amazing, it really has been. 

B.54:  I mean, the, the, the notion of personal computer back then meant you had
to have your own living room.

A.55:  Oh, I know it, I know it.  And, it's almost like talking about the
checkless society and, and all of that and, you know, there was talk, in fact
my brother, uh, was with I B M from nineteen fifty-four until about three
years ago, so we really had a family history of talking about development of,
uh, of equipment.

B.56:  Wow, so this is the perfect topic for you. 

A.57:  Oh [laughter].  You know, and, I do, I do some programming of my own too,
using COBAL rather than any of the newer languages,

B.58:  # Okay.  #

A.59:  # it's # just one that I've known for a long time and still use it even on
this P S two.  So, I have to learn a tolerance with canned programs because I'm
so used to being able to do exactly what I want to do, rather than having to
work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the, the final
one.  But, I am amazed at the power, and, uh, ability of these small units that
sit on a table or desk. 

B.60:  Well, how do they compare with like, um, you know, the big, um, the big,
you know, the ones that, that took up a whole room in the sixties.  I mean,
how would you, you know, power wise, was that less, well actually less
powerful?

A.61:  Oh, it, it was almost, uh, well, it's hard to describe, but it's almost
like, uh, an abacus versus an ele-, electronic calculator, you know, y-,

B.62:  Oh, God. 

A.63:  you go [laughter], 

B.64:  tha-, that much, and, and, and that much bigger too, for the same analogy. 
Wow. 

A.65:  Oh, yeah, but I mean, the speed, using punch cards, and for your
information, Ken, this first, uh, first computer had one, had two
accumulators,

B.66:  Okay. 

A.67:  and one focal point that you had to channel everything into, it was called
a distributor, and you moved it from memory, and you had to know exactly where
in memory it was, there was no relative memory.

B.68:  Oh, God, okay. 

A.69:  And you had to know exactly in memory where it was, move it to the
distributor, put it into one of the accumulators, and add it, take it back out
of the distributor, and put it somewhere else.  So it, it was as basic as you
can get [horn].  And, uh, of course, the speed of processing was very very
slow, but compared to anything then, it was very very fast.

B.70:  Right. 

A.71:  So, it, everything is relative [laughter]. 

B.72:  That's true, that's true. 

A.73:  Twenty, twenty years from now, we'll we'll call up again and say, what do
you think of the new, uh, thought, computers. 

B.74:  Right, and they'll, and they'll say (( )), imagine those big clunkers --

A.75:  Right. 

B.76:  -- laptop computers way back one. 

A.77:  Yeah, but I think they're, they're excellent tools for people to learn how
to use.  And I'd like to see them in grade schools right now, I think they are,
in fact,

B.78:  # Yeah, they, they # --

A.79:  # uh, instruction, #

B.80:  -- going to say, there's a big move for that.  My, uh, my, my sister-in-law
is a principal of a school,

A.81:  Uh-huh. 

B.82:  and she just switched, but before she was in a, um, a, in a, in a different
school and she wrote a grant with, I think it was Apple or I B M, one of the
two. 

A.83:  Uh-huh. 

B.84:  I'm pretty sure it was Apple, actually, to, uh, to get a whole bunchy of,
you know, P C -s into, or P C type machines into the school for the kids to
use, and, and it just, according to her, it's just a wonderful thing.  Kids go
in and are able to work at their own pace, and, you know, computers aren't
impatient,

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  They'll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesn't want to answer for
awhile, or it'll, um, it'll, you know, the kids, for those kids who really have
a problem working with faster than the class, or slower than the class, it lets
them go.  What she's finding now is that, in evenings, the parents will come in
and do it too. 

A.87:  Oh yeah, yeah.  But it has a lot of home uses too.  I've, I've not, I don't
have mine hooked up to anything, uh, you know, it's just a stand alone, but the
abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh, automatic built-in
telephone,
