A.1:  Uh, are you a T I -er?

B.2:  No. 

A.3:  Okay, well, we might have a difference, uh, to talk about on clothing, uh,

B.4:  You sound like somebody I talked to yesterday [laughter]. 

A.5:  What?

B.6:  You sound like the same person I talked to yesterday. 

A.7:  I am, how come we got the same,

B.8:  # I don't know [laughter].# 

A.9:  # subject? [Laughter].  #

B.10:  Okay. 

A.11:  I was amazed that they had the same subject on clothing too, I never have
had that before. 

B.12:  Well, so was I. 

A.13:  I noticed it on the weekends occasionally when I call,

B.14:  # [Laughter].  #

A.15:  # and # how could ((they)) possibly get the same person, that's ridiculous
[laughter]. 

@B.16:  Okay, well [laughter], have your opinions changed in the last twenty-four
hours?

A.17:  No, no, they sure haven't.  What other aspects, I'm, I, I'm this is funny,
you know. 

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  Uh, clothing, let's see, uh, I was curious, you know, if they just want to
talk about the words of, uh, related to clothing that polyester was coming
back, have you heard that, uh, I saw it on the T V that the,

B.20:  # No.  #

A.21:  # models # were,

B.22:  # Oh, gross.  #

A.23:  # they had # a new kind of polyester, uh, whether that they just like to
switch materials, uh, periodically I don't know, we might, I haven't, we didn't
talk about materials I, I prefer, you know, the cotton with very little, in
fact, when I look for,

B.24:  # Oh, definitely.  #

A.25:  # uh, I, # I try to go for the cottons and I don't know that polyester
will, although men's shirts are half-and-half or sixty forty or whatever.

B.26:  I mean poly-, especially in this climate, polyester just doesn't work too
well. 

A.27:  Yeah.  I, uh, I'm originally from the east and I, we used to wear sweaters
and things,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # and # sweaters are, this isn't necessarily sweater country, uh, you know,
I, I guess they're not as popular as they were.  I don't know about how women,
if you, do you have problems with air-conditioning or were you, you were, uh,

B.30:  # Yeah, it's always, #

A.31:  # is that a # factor?

B.32:  yeah, it seems like it's always cold inside, and part of my problem is
that I'm in and out a lot because,

A.33:  That's very bad, yeah. 

B.34:  Yeah, we've got a lot of buildings downtown and I have to go to a lot of
meetings in different buildings and so I'm in and out of the air-conditioning
and, you know, like I said, we have to wear suits and that's,

A.35:  # Yeah.  #

B.36:  # you # know, it, it gets to be quite uncomfortable at times [laughter]. 

A.37:  At T I, I am too in and out and, well, of course, we don't wear ties and
jackets, certainly not in this kind of weather.  The, the jackets, they don't
disappear but th-, you know, they're, they're on a hook usually,

B.38:  # [Laughter].  #

A.39:  # the # vice-president's or the manager's and again I used to wear them but
I don't, I don't bother with it right now.  Yeah, that is a problem, uh, where
did I see an article about where they're, about that subject where they're
trying to have, oh, I know, it was lunchrooms, where they're trying to
encourage people to stay at work and so that's why they, even downtown this
might be applicable,

B.40:  # Huh.  #

A.41:  # where # they're trying to have restaurants within walking distance but at
the same time, in other words, you go down in a subway or whatever,

B.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.43:  # and # go to lunch, and they say that's so much more healthy for you than
going out in the street in the open traffic and going to lunch,

B.44:  # It that right? #

A.45:  # you'd be better # off I'm sh-, maybe you do have some tunnels down there.

B.46:  Oh, def-, yeah, I mean. 

A.47:  And they, they say that's so much more healthy for you to, you know, when
you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to, to walk or however and
get to a place that is, uh, you don't have to go in and out of the, of the
temperature. 

B.48:  I ((haven't)) heard that. 

A.49:  Whether that affects how you dress I can imagine, uh,

B.50:  The last thing I heard about fashion, I think I mentioned it yesterday, was
that wide ties were coming back. 

A.51:  Right.  Yeah, I, uh,

B.52:  I don't know, I think I always run a little bit behind.  It takes me awhile
to get used to,

A.53:  Well, I-, I'm for colorful things and I sure I, I do enjoy the, uh, the
newer products along those lines.  What do you think about women and wearing
slacks and all that, we haven't talked about that. 

B.54:  Oh, I wouldn't wear slacks to work. 

A.55:  Okay. 

B.56:  Um, people don't where I work, I mean, it's just not done,

A.57:  # Yeah.  #

B.58:  # at # all, but now, I have worked places where they do and even then I
still didn't. 

A.59:  Do you have children, I might comment on teenagers how they dress. 

B.60:  I don't have a teenager I have a six year old,

A.61:  Oh, you have a lot to experience I have two,

B.62:  and he's still, he's still at the age where I can dress him how I want to
[laughter]. 

A.63:  Right [laughter], well have the opposite then [laughter].  I have, uh,
well, one of, they're almost now teenagers at one twenty, almost twenty and
one almost sixteen.  And I learned early on being surrounded by women here
that the, I, I love to take them shopping but I don't pick anything out, you
know,

B.64:  # Yeah.  #

A.65:  # I, # I just kind of influence but, uh, the, the, teen, the junior high
teenagers really, I don't know if you can describe how they dress, you know,
you, you,

B.66:  Well, I have a girlfriend who has a daughter that's a teenager and every
year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they
fight [laughter] too much. 

A.67:  I, I know what angle that we can talk about here, we, they want us to talk
about clothes around work but, uh, the way kids in school should dress and
I'll give you my opi-, I don't think that the school should just kind of let
the kids dress what is the current style not that it's totally ridiculous of
course but,

B.68:  Well, I just read something, in fact, I think it was today about how the
public, a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to
uniforms. 

A.69:  Public schools?

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  Oh, I didn't hear that ((yet)).

B.72:  Because, uh, they feel like there's too much competition in the clothing
and it, it clearly defines, you know, class lines ((in where)), you know, the,
the GUESS jeans and the, you know, stuff as opposed to the people who can't
and, so if takes people's concentra-, the thought behind it is that people
won't concentrate or worry about what they're wearing, what everybody else is
wearing, and it will take their mind off that and, you know, enable them to,
you know, study better,

A.73:  # Right.  #

B.74:  # plus # they sa-,

A.75:  Well, well, whoever said that in my opinion doesn't have any teenagers who
didn't ((grow)),

B.76:  # [Laughter].  #

A.77:  # they # won't do that, they'll never pass it that will be like,

B.78:  This (( )) they weren't talking about,

A.79:  # Right.  #

B.80:  # it # wasn't talking about, {dead spot}, actually I, I kind of like that
idea and I had my son in private school where they do wear uniforms and, uh,

A.81:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.82:  # I, # I really like that. 

A.83:  I can, uh, of course, I went to school, you know, a hundred years ago in
college and, uh, we did wear ties and jackets and this was, they have since
changed, it was an engineering school, a city, it was in an downtown area like,
I don't know, well, you can't compare anything around here to the school in
like, no, U T A here is in Arlington, it's not exactly down-, but I guess like
that.  And they just historically, since it was in the city, they wanted us to
wear jackets and ties and I did,

B.84:  # Huh.  #

A.85:  # my # whole college career which is, I guess, terribly unusual, we wore
jackets and ties,

B.86:  # ((That is)) (( )). #

A.87:  # for four years.  And # I, so, subsequently, I wanted to get a masters
degree in, in, after I got out of the service and, uh, they changed drafts so
there was a, the styles have certainly changed to where, I guess, my campus now
looks like typical, uh, college campus, I guess. 

B.88:  Yeah, I think, well, I think for a while kids were dressing nicer in
colleges but, um, nowadays, uh, I, I still, I take classes at U T D and they,
um, you know, they wear jeans,

A.89:  # Huh.  #

B.90:  # and # sometimes they don't even have shoes on [laughter]. 

A.91:  The older I get the mo-, more open to other people's ideas {dead spot}, uh,
you cannot be, you have to let them come out with, uh, whatever they, not
whatever, but some of their ideas too and so you kind of back off and see what
people, and I know their clothing is changing,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # you # know, all the time and I'm, I'm certainly open to how you should
dress, uh, now, of course, the subject is work, uh, or clothes really, I guess,

B.94:  # Yeah.  #

A.95:  # uh, # and the on-, again the one thing I am at, at work is, is certainly
a professional look but I'm not saying that that will not cha-, the
professional look will look differently from year to year, perhaps.

B.96:  Do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work?

A.97:  No, I really don't.  It's, uh, uh, go through a lot of shirts and ((think))
no, I don't really. 

B.98:  You know I think, and, and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it
seems to me like women have to spend more money on clothes for work then men do
because men can have a few suits,

A.99:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.100:  # and, # you know, a bunch of different shirts and some different ties but,

A.101:  # Right.  #

B.102:  # you # know, women practically have to have, you know, a whole bunch of
different suits. 

A.103:  Well, you're sure right there because not even when I wore a jacket and a
lot of the guys when I was up at Spring Creek in, uh, Plano, uh, we think he
just brought the same jacket even that wasn't a, that's not a black mark
against the man,

B.104:  # Yeah.  #

A.105:  # and # you're right that, uh, women are expected to look more,

B.106:  And then of course, you know,

A.107:  # Everything matches, I guess.# 

B.108:  # accessories, you know, #

A.109:  # Right.  #

B.110:  # shoes # and hose and earrings, and, you know, all that stuff,

A.111:  # Right.  #

B.112:  # um, # it's just, I, it's outrageous, you know, because, you know, you
still spend two, three hundred dollars on a suit. 

A.113:  Your work, without saying much about it, do they ever bring the subject up
of asking your opinion on, on whether you want things to change on how you
dress or,

B.114:  No, I ult-, {dead spot} leave and I haven't been at work in awhile so,

A.115:  # ((Are the ties)), #

B.116:  # I, I don't # really know,

A.117:  # Oh.  #

B.118:  # you # know, from what I,

A.119:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.120:  # I # went to a concert earlier this week and saw some people and just
noticed how (( )) a lot of the wider ties. 

A.121:  Right. 

B.122:  But they're not, they're not the same as the wide,

A.123:  Uh-huh.  Uh, T I has several locations {dead spot} different sites have a
little bit different dress, like I said, at Spring Creek it was definitely more
formal.  I think because it was newer and, uh, (( )) type and many, many more
people wore, there was very, there was very few production areas. 

B.124:  Do you think it has anything to do with the ages of people?

A.125:  Uh, that,
