REMARKS:        Speaker B had some banging noises at quite a few points in
the checking section of the tape that I did not hear during the dialogue.

============================================================================

A.1:  The Latin American situation in, the last development I know of was the
military and financial assistance Columbia --

B.2:  Uh-huh. 

A.3:  -- for the, for the drug, uh, control.  And I support that fully.  I'm not
sure we have the right solution to it, but at least we're, we're going to the
source of the problem.  And,

B.4:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.5:  # the # source of supply.  Uh, the problem is here, but the source of
supply is there.

B.6:  That's true.  Very definitely so. 

A.7:  In fact I think a lot of the, I've been to, uh, Peru several times. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  I've never been to other parts of South America, but, uh, I have been to
Peru, and they need some assistance down there and I'm sure that, uh, as an
undeveloped country they look, look for it, but there is not exactly a lot of,
uh, physical responsibility there. 

B.10:  No.  Very immature [laughter] in that --

A.11:  Yes, right. 

B.12:  -- respect. 

A.13:  And I, I think that, uh, they need guidance and assistance, but they need
to learn how to stand on their own, own two feet also.

B.14:  I agree.  I think that for so long power financially, uh, governmentally,
every which way was in the hands of such a few --

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  -- that [breathing] there's not the middle class that we, we perceive. 

A.17:  Oh, no, the, and the poor are extremely poor.  I know,

B.18:  Are extremely poor.  That's correct. 

A.19:  I know, uh, some of the areas in, in Texas seem poor, but until you've seen
some of those, uh, native,

B.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.21:  # Latin # Americans come down from the hills, you can't imagine what poor
is.  And, uh, the worst scene I've ever had I think was, uh, someone eating
out of, out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima, Peru.

B.22:  And, and just very happy to get that. 

A.23:  Oh, yes.  Yes. 

B.24:  I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  And this is very much his, you know, reaction that the rich are so rich and
the poor are so poor. 

A.27:  Oh, the, there's a joke, the, the graft and the, uh, payoffs down there are
[breathing], are an accepted way and, in a way, 

B.28:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.29:  And there's, there's a sad joke.  I guess all jokes are really sad, but
there's a joke about the, uh, Ambassador from Latin America that came to visit
a Senator in the U S and was taken to his home for dinner and the, uh, home
was palatial.  They had five or six servants, you know, and, and, a lot of
expensive, uh, holdings and all that, and the Ambassador said, but I know what
you make as a U S Senator, how can you afford all of this? And he said, come
I'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and the, uh, Senator said do
you see that hospital over there? And the Ambassador said, yes.  And he patted
his pocket and he said fifteen percent.  He said, you see that school over
there?  And the Ambassador said, yes, and he pot, patted his pocket and said
fifteen percent, so,

B.30:  # [Laughter]  Oh, gosh.  #

A.31:  # so the next # year the Senator went to Latin America to visit the
Ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home and it was twice as large and
four times as many servants.  He said, well I know how poor your country is,
how can you afford this, uh, in such a poor country, and he, he said, come
I'll show you and he walked out the backyard and he said, do you see that
hospital over there? And the Senator looked and he couldn't see anything, he
said, no.  And the Ambassador potted, patted his pocket and said one hundred
percent so,

B.32:  Yep [laughter]. 

A.33:  Yeah, that, it's a sad story but,

B.34:  Intentions, intentions [laughter]. 

A.35:  Yes, yes, but it, uh, it is a problem. 

B.36:  I know.  Uh, I have a sister-in-law who is from Nicaragua and her family,
her father was a fairly, uh, high ranking official under Somoza.  And when that
went down the tubes they had to get out. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  And seventeen children,

A.39:  # Um.  #

B.40:  # filtered # through into, into America through Guatamala, through Mexico,
through Honduras, you know, two here, three there, one here, you know, this
kind of thing until,

A.41:  # Yeah.  #

B.42:  # and # now, uh, couple of the older ones stayed or went back, but the rest
of them now have their American citizenship and are leading productive lives,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # but, # you kn-,

A.45:  Well, the oth-, the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle
things, the cholera,

B.46:  # Yes.  #

A.47:  # and # hepatitis epidemics now in, in Latin America.  And it shows the,
the unpreparedness for such, such a problem.

B.48:  Yes. 

A.49:  And yet they're so,

B.50:  Oh, the stories she tells, you know, are just unnerving --

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  -- just unnerving. 

A.53:  And they're, they're so rich in resources there.  They're very rich in oil
and gas.  And they're very rich in gold and silver, and very rich in, in, uh,
natural resources such as the fish and, uh --

B.54:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.55:  -- timber, and, and copper and all types of, uh, resources but they,

B.56:  And the uranium. 

A.57:  Yes, and, but they don't have, it's sort of like Russia, they don't have
the ability to develop it.

B.58:  The technology. 

A.59:  Right.  And they, they're very,

B.60:  Well, and, you know, they're very willing to be taught in many cases now,
too, but, you know, there's just always this kind of resentment underlying I
think that when they [breathing]  receive help from us, they want it, but, they
don't want it, I mean [laughter], 

A.61:  You're --

B.62:  It's kind of a --

A.63:  -- you're exactly right. 

B.64:  -- catch twenty-two. 

A.65:  Uh-huh.  It, it's sort of illustrated by the, uh, World Bank and
International Monetary Fund not wanting to continue to do business there
because they offer assistance, then don't get repaid.

B.66:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.67:  So it's sort of a thumbing of the nose, uh, approach.  They need it, and
they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations, but uh, then
don't.  Of course it's a very volatile government, uh, situation, too. 

B.68:  Well, and I think that, you know, it, somewhat a sarcastic view, but some
of those drugs czars, you know, they, they know that by pumping that poison
into our system --

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- that that's the way to bring us to our knees, more on their level. 

A.71:  You know,

B.72:  You know, that's really, uh, kind of a far fetched idea, I know, and I
don't think people probably think those things consciously,

A.73:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.74:  # but # it's like in any sibling rivalry [laughter]  --

A.75:  Well the,

B.76:  -- we're hearing the same,

A.77:  The solution discussed at one time and I think it has real merit on the
drug situation is that the g-, the U S government could spend less money by
buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to, to beef up the
military and to do all other things.  I think it would be cheaper to buy it
and destroy it, which would still give the, uh, the grower in Columbia and
elsewhere in Latin America the, uh, the money that they apparently need and
go, go to the illegal crop for.  And it would save the U S money in --

B.78:  In the long run. 

A.79:  -- in the long run in how much they're trying to do,

B.80:  And in the short run probably [laughter], too. 

A.81:  [Laughter] True. 

B.82:  Course, then could, you know, at, at some point, could you ever convince
someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind. 

A.83:  No, no. 

B.84:  You know. 

A.85:  And, I, I think finding an alternate to that would be very good. 

B.86:  I mean even their, even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive
as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view, coffee --

A.87:  Right. 

B.88:  -- tobacco --

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  -- you know [laughter]. 

A.91:  Argentine beef, yeah, yeah. 

B.92:  They're certainly legal, but they're certainly not healthy. 

A.93:  Well, have we come up with a solution yet, Salina?

B.94:  No, not that I know of [laughter]. 

A.95:  [Laughter]. 

B.96:  But it's been fun hashing about it I suppose.  At any rate, yeah. 

A.97:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, one of these days, uh, I hope we'll find some, some way
to substitute the good crops for illegal ones.

B.98:  Well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little
bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and
I do here tonight but,

A.99:  I agree. 

B.100:  Well, it's been nice chatting with you. 

A.101:  Yes, it has. 

B.102:  I appreciate it, and, and tell your wife I hope we, I get her again
sometime, too.  This is fun,

A.103:  Very good [laughter]. 

B.104:  It's kind of nice to, [breathing] to see old friends now, you see. 

A.105:  All right, thank you Salina. 

B.106:  Bye now. 

A.107:  Bye.
