=========================================================================

A.1:  So I, personally, uh, do consider the Soviet Union a threat.  I, I, I think
that although there's been some fundamental changes and that there's uh, uh,
the, uh, the mood for change that there's a lot of change left to happen and
that there's, uh, still communism which is fundamentally opposed to democracy
and there's still missiles. 

B.2:  Uh-huh, yeah, well, I mean that's, that's certainly true.  I guess I'm, I'm
confused, uh, by what it means to be a threat to the United States and so I'm
not sure I even recognize the United States as anything to be threatened. 

A.3:  ((Oh, really)).

B.4:  Um, the, uh, I guess the main issue is, is that it, it seems to me that the
Soviet Union is breaking up into it's own internal problems. 

A.5:  Yes. 

B.6:  Um, and it would certainly be nice if the various, um, republics seceded,
on the other hand I also think it would be very nice if the various states in
our union seceded.

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  Uh, but that's beside the point. 

A.9:  Right. 

B.10:  Uh, and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power, um,
there's going to be anything left, uh, given that anything like that happens. 

A.11:  Right [breathing]  [laughter]. 

B.12:  Uh, given that anything like that happens. 

A.13:  Right. 

B.14:  Uh, they've got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry
about, you know, nuking other people who aren't bothering them. 

A.15:  Right.  Well I guess that that, that brings up a question, is it, their, I
think in, in the long term we could see a, a situation where there are, in h-,
h-, incredible civil wars and that the, the structure of the country breaks
down and there's strife and much, much death.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  But until that happens, be, between now and then there's a lot of other,
uh, events that could happen, including a resurgence of communism with, uh,
violent, uh, backlash against democracy.  Wh-, which is where we could be in,
threatened I guess you'd say.

B.18:  I guess I'm co-, why is, why is communism antithetical to democracy.  I can
understand why it's antithetical to capitalism. 

A.19:  I'm sorry yo-, you're right, I'm am meaning to say capitalism. 

B.20:  Okay, uh, all right but we've already got a lot of anticapitalism in this
country. 

A.21:  Yes, that's true, uh-huh,

B.22:  Um. 

A.23:  but not necessarily enough from the Soviet Union's people's point of view. 

B.24:  That could be, that could be. 

A.25:  I-, yeah. 

B.26:  Uh, but certainly the latest rumors in Congress right now is let's soak the
rich some more so we can spread out the money,

A.27:  # Yeah.  #

B.28:  # and # that's certainly communism as far as I can tell. 

A.29:  Right. 

B.30:  Uh, so, um, you know, they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait
for it to happen.

A.31:  That's right. 

B.32:  Um, and they, so, so, I guess since the primary question is whether or not
it's a military problem, that's less than clear to me.  I mean if they're smart
they're just going to let us head toward communism on our own very, merry way. 

A.33:  That's right. 

B.34:  And there seems to be enough people in our country who are happy to do that
sort of thing because they think they'd get more out of it that way. 

A.35:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.36:  Um, so from that point of view, I don't consider them a threat. 

A.37:  I see. 

B.38:  I don't think they're going to, you know, somehow import communism to us. 

A.39:  I, I agree with that, I don't believe that will happen.  The, um, well one
thing that's cu-, of interest is, is if the Soviet Union's structure does break
down,

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  and  there is civil war, at the end of those civil wars or during those
civil wars in whose hands will those missiles be. 

B.42:  Right.  

A.43:  And there are a lot of them, uh, scattered throughout the many, many
republics. 

B.44:  That's true, that's, that can be a frightening thought. 

A.45:  Right, almost a terroristic thought,

B.46:  Um, yeah, yeah.  

A.47:  come help us or we'll bomb you. 

B.48:  Yeah, um, of course, that's not a good way to win friends but, yeah.  I
mean,

A.49:  That's,

B.50:  I, I think there's also the whole third world issue, uh, with him, with,
uh, the Soviet Union having, uh, supported, uh, Iraq, uh, previously.

A.51:  Right. 

B.52:  And, and so there, there's a whole lot of political possibilities, um,
but, you know, just, just to put this in perspective, I mean, George Bush was
recently in the hospital and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been,
[laughter]  uh, having his finger on the trigger,

A.53:  That's right.

B.54:  and God knows what that would have done. 

A.55:  I know, it's almost amazing how little you hear about Dan Quayle,

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  and when you do it's usually totally,

B.58:  It's a joke [laughter]. 

A.59:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah.  He still wants to send people to Mars. 

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  The guy's, uh, lame to say the least. 

B.62:  Yeah. 

A.63:  Oh well, so that's, uh, what, what's going to be real interesting is if
when they have the next presidential elections,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  if Bush is going to run with Quayle again,

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  or if he's going to run with someone else, which I think would be, uh, I
wonder if that's, if there's precedent for that.  Where, uh, there's, uh, same
president but a different vice president. 

B.68:  Uh, I think so,

A.69:  Is it?

B.70:  I can't think off hand who,

A.71:  But without something like death or impeachment. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  I, I can't recall. 

B.74:  I mean, I just can't imagine voting for anybody that has Quayle on their
ticket. 

A.75:  Yeah that's right.  I guess i-, in the last elections it was, it was the
lesser of several evils, but from i-,

B.76:  Right, and also, he was basically unknown. 

A.77:  Yeah that's right. 

B.78:  So, I mean, you're just like, okay, so it's, it's Bush and somebody
else. 

A.79:  Yeah.  Oh well, so let's see back to the, that key issue. 

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Uh, the, the other part of the question was what would, uh, what would
have to happen to convince me. 

B.82:  Right, right. 

A.83:  And, I, se-, seems to me, uh, that the missiles are the threat. 

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  And so what would have to happen is a complete disarmament. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  Uh, and, uh, that's, you know, I'd love to see that happen but I doubt it's
going to happen in the next fifty years. 

B.88:  You don't think so?

A.89:  I don't, no.  Personally, I, I, re-, as I said I would really love to see
it happen but I just,

B.90:  I just I can't see them maintaining the missile bases, in fact I think if
the Soviet government starts retreating, you know, because of these civil wars
and stuff,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  the first thing they're going to do is close down the missile bases in
the republics,

A.93:  Oh, under the fe-, --

B.94:  because they're not going to want them to fall into the republic's
hands. 

A.95:  -- I see under the fear that, that, uh, #Moscow gets bombed.# 

B.96:  #Might be used against them.#  #That's right.# 

A.97:  #That's a good point,# that's a very good point in fact [breathing]. 

B.98:  And so I think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of
disarmament.  They'll still be republics with the missiles, the ones that are
under the firmer control of the, of the Soviets. 

A.99:  Right. 

B.100:  Uh, but certainly, you know, like Lithuania and stuff I think would lose
theirs. 

A.101:  Yes, I see, that's a good, great point.  Okay, well so,

B.102:  So it was good talking to you. 

A.103:  Yeah, it was nice talking to you too Brian.  Good day. 

B.104:  #Okeydokey.  Bye.# 

A.105:  #Bye-bye.#
