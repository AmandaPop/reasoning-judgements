@A.1:  Okay.  uh, we're going to talk about our lawn and gard-, garden chores, do
you have either one?

B.2:  Well, I don't do anything with the lawn really, but I do gardening,

A.3:  # ((Do you)). #

B.4:  # both flowers # and vegetable gardening. 

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  Um, I, we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
and that's fun, well, actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big
yard because, um, we enjoy that.  We love fresh vegetables in the summer, and
it's just one of the things I enjoy doing.

A.7:  So do I.  I would, I had rather be outside than, than inside any day. 

B.8:  So would I [laughter]. 

A.9:  [Laughter]  Do you work during the week, uh, outside the home?

B.10:  Yes, I do. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  Uh, so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward, I work for a
school system so I'm able to do that, um, because I get home a little earlier,

A.13:  # Yes.  #

B.14:  # and # I can still do some, some sorts of things but,

A.15:  Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with
your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight. 

B.16:  Oh, absolutely [laughter]. 

A.17:  [Laughter] Well, I unfortunately am not gardening this year.  I love
gardening, in fact, I was prevented at like tw-, no, about thirty years ago
with a life membership, uh, from the Richmond, Virginia counsel of garden
clubs.

B.18:  Wow. 

A.19:  And it wasn't because I was so good, but I organized a very large garden
club, but I still have, uh,

B.20:  Oh, that's wonderful. 

A.21:  It, well, it's always something that seems so odd to me [laughter] but, uh,

B.22:  [Laughter]  But that, that's, and you really feel you can accomplish
something and to help other people too, that's neat. 

A.23:  Yes, it has really nothing to do with, uh, actual gardening or flower
arranging or anything like that,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # it # was just that I happened to organize this group,

B.26:  # Right.  #

A.27:  # that # was about seventy people. 

B.28:  That's wonderful. 

A.29:  That, isn't, yeah, that, that,

B.30:  # Yeah.  #

A.31:  # those # numbers were, were great but it,

B.32:  Yeah, well, I think it sounds good.  I've never belonged to a garden club
because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own,
I've never had,

A.33:  # Yes.  #

B.34:  # the # time really to get involved in the organized sort of format, but I
know people who do it and, and enjoy it very much. 

A.35:  Well, and actually, I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been
aware of in the past, uh, are only flowers, what I would like, we've spent the
last twenty years in Oklahoma.  Just moved to, to North Carolina,

B.36:  # Oh.  #

A.37:  # and, # uh, we were orig-, originally, of course, from this area, from
Virginia, but, uh, in North, uh, in Oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that
I would have wanted to join.

B.38:  My word. 

A.39:  And you would have because they do all kinds of, uh, gardening and not just
flowers like women do. 

B.40:  For heaven's sake. 

A.41:  Uh-huh {very faint}. Uh-huh. 

B.42:  Well, um, there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of,
they're, they're women.  But, um, and usually they're the tea type things, you
know, where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing. 

A.43:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

B.44:  But, um, flowers are primarily the emphasis,

A.45:  # Yes, I think so too.  #

B.46:  # um, whereas I enjoy vegetable # gardening almost more, I do flowers sort
of look pretty but I, I really like to do the vegetables. 

A.47:  Yes, and, and I have spent the last ten, ten years being a florist. 

B.48:  Being what?

A.49:  Being a florist. 

B.50:  Oh, my.  Well, what a wonderful thing. 

A.51:  [Laughter]  It was nice, it was exhilarating, uh, for many years. 

B.52:  Yes. 

A.53:  Uh, many of those ((tanned)) until the last couple when, uh, we had such an
economic slowdown. 

B.54:  Oh, terrible yeah. 

A.55:  Yeah, well, tell me what's in your garden this year, since I don't have
one. 

B.56:  Okay.  Well, uh, the flowers I'm just, in fact, I was going to go out today
to buy some plants so I could put them in, I, I always have geraniums and,

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # um, # and then I have a shady area that I need to, uh, be concerned about
not getting something that has to have sun, so I've discovered that, uh,
impatiens that tried and true is, turns out to be about the best thing to use
there along with coleus. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  Because they, uh, look pretty and, in my front garden, uh, but I like the
vinca which is something I hadn't, they look sort of like impatiens, you know,
but they're not quite [laughter]  and they're better for the sun areas.  Um,
and, of course, you know, the, mine are old ((theory)) ordinary flowers,
marigolds and, and that sort of thing. 

A.61:  Yes. 

B.62:  In my,

A.63:  Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds?

B.64:  No.  I don't. 

A.65:  Maybe it's,

B.66:  I don't know, maybe this climate is a little better. 

A.67:  Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.68:  Um, but in the vegetable garden we grow, um, usually, what our favorite is
something called ((white half runner green beans)), now that's,

A.69:  Do you, isn't that funny, so is my favorite. 

B.70:  Well, you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina,

A.71:  # Okay.  #

B.72:  # and # that was my mother's, um, favorite bean she alw-, she always grows,
you know, five different varieties,

A.73:  # Yeah.  #

B.74:  # but # that's the kind that produces the best. 

A.75:  Yeah, well, I think it has the best flavor. 

B.76:  And, and they're wonderful, and I pick them when they're very young and
have very little string and then just steam them a little bit, my mother picks
them when they're fat and she cooks them for an hour with some ((fat backs)),
[laughter],

A.77:  # Yes, uh-huh, well, I like them in between.# 

B.78:  # and they're good both ways.  #

A.79:  I like them in between. 

B.80:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.81:  The flavor is better I think in between. 

B.82:  Oh, in between the ((size wise)) yeah,

A.83:  # Yes, yeah.# 

B.84:  # yeah.  #

A.85:  Uh-huh.  My mother,

B.86:  Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them
[laughter]. 

A.87:  Well, and I know I love them, well, that's the yankee way.  But I think,

B.88:  # Oh, of course.  #

A.89:  # that's like another # vegetable.  I love them that way just, just the
thrill of,

B.90:  Yeah, it is.  They're two different vegetables that way, uh-huh. 

A.91:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  In fact, I, my mother, who is eighty-six years old, canned
over a hundred quarts of half runners last year.

B.92:  Oh, my gosh.  My does, mot-, mother will be th-, ninety this year and she
lives in western North Carolina and, uh, she would do that if, if we didn't
tell her that she'd better not [laughter].

A.93:  Yes, uh-huh, yes. 

B.94:  But she doesn't have that big a garden, but she has a bigger one than I do.

A.95:  Real-, yes. 

B.96:  And I have four children, you know, so,

A.97:  And she tends to it herself?

B.98:  Oh, yes, oh, yes. 

A.99:  Uh-huh, isn't that wonderful. 

B.100:  Oh, it is, it's great.  It's, it's really her joy and I suppose that's why
I enjoy gardening,

A.101:  # I think so too.  #

B.102:  # because, you know, growing # up with it. 

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  We also grow, um, yellow and green squash,

A.105:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.106:  # um, # much to my children's chagrin,

A.107:  # Right.  #

B.108:  # and, # uh, we grow a lot of tomatoes, uh,

A.109:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # there's # just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes. 

A.111:  No. 

B.112:  So, we enjoy that, um, we grow I, I have been trying to grow watermelon and
cantaloupe and get teased by my family but I actually was successful for the
last two years, so. 

A.113:  Wonderful. 

B.114:  I'm going to do it again. 

A.115:  Bet you showed them. 

B.116:  That's right.  And we grow broccoli. 

A.117:  Oh. 

B.118:  And I have been very, uh, happy about the new way of controlling the, the,
uh, worm that gets in broccoli, um, by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which
is the, uh, little, well, in fact, that's what they use for gypsy moth, I
don't know if you have had that problem there or not.

A.119:  No. 

B.120:  But it's, you know, it's a problem that's, that's moving south from, from
the New England area. 

A.121:  Yes. 

B.122:  And they devastate the trees so they, they spray, the government, uh,
sprays, um, t-, two, three times in the spring when the, uh, caterpillars are,
are coming along because what they do, this, this, uh, bacillus, um, the worms
ingest it and it expands in their, in their, um, digestive tract and they die. 

A.123:  Uh-huh. 

B.124:  So, that's the same technique that is, you know, for any of the other, uh,
little varmints that get in vegetables so it, that's really very nice because
it's a non toxic way of, of handling the problem. 

A.125:  Great.  Well, we could ch-, we could really talk gardening a long time.
I'm enjoying hearing you so much [laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter]  Well, it's nice hearing you talk and I'm, I wish you, uh, good
luck, have you just recently moved to Charlotte?

A.127:  Um, a-, no, October. 

B.128:  Oh, so, well, that's not very long. 

A.129:  Uh, so, yes, recently seven months and it,

B.130:  # Yes.  #

A.131:  # the # weather is wonderful, I love it. 

B.132:  Oh, that's great, that's great. 

A.133:  [Laughter] It is just terrific, you know, rains a little too often. 

B.134:  Well, I hope you have a, an opportunity to garden again. 

A.135:  Oh, I think so, I have a little spinach [laughter]. 

B.136:  Oh, well, good [laughter]. 

A.137:  Bye-bye. 

B.138:  Bye-bye.
