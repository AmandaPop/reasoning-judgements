A.1:  Hi, this is Judy, I'm from Maryland [noise]  and I'm in California visiting
right now. 

B.2:  Hi, Judy.  This is Norma, and I live in Virginia [laughter]. 

A.3:  Oh, okay. 

B.4:  We got a great topic [laughter]. 

A.5:  [Laughter]  I know.  I'm sitting here going oh, dear [laughter]. 

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  [Laughter]  Should we give it a try?

B.8:  I guess we might as well [laughter]. 

@A.9:  Okay [laughter].  Okay. 

B.10:  Okay. 

A.11:  Well, um, so [laughter], 

B.12:  Let you start [laughter], 

A.13:  [Laughter]  So, so what changes have you seen? [laughter]. 

B.14:  What changes, uh,

A.15:  # [Laughter].  #

B.16:  # I # guess the biggest, I don't know your age Judy, but, uh, in my
lifetime the biggest is in more women working,

A.17:  Well, actually,

B.18:  # definitely.  #

A.19:  # that's # what I was thinking too. 

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  And, um, you know, just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up.
Is it, perhaps, woman in politics is for the future.

B.22:  For the fut-, well, yeah. 

A.23:  Because I don't see that really yet in positions of power, really. 

B.24:  Right.  I don't see them in positions of power in corporation either
[laughter]  --

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  -- not many. 

A.27:  That's true.  That's true.  Um, do you work in private corporation or
government?

B.28:  I did work in government. 

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  And before that I worked in a bank for eight years. 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  And now I'm retired. 

A.33:  Oh, you,

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  [Laughter]  That's the best status. 

B.36:  That's right. 

A.37:  Yes, um, I don't, I see, um, and,

B.38:  Which do you work in, excuse me?

A.39:  A government. 

B.40:  A government. 

A.41:  And I work in academia before. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  And, um, actually there's one, um, woman in our, I don't know what you'd
call it, uh, institute who is a manager and, I mean, in a since, perhaps, um, a
lot of, she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token. 

B.44:  Oh. 

A.45:  And, and it's sort of unfortunate because, I think that they don't accept
her technically and, but she's a good paper pusher. 

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  And it's in a technical position really.  And you know she should be more
technical for what she does. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  And I think that's sort of unfortunate,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # because # it doesn't, it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
[laughter]. 

B.52:  [Laughter]. 

A.53:  But, um, you know, I don't know.  And, and teaching I still see that that's
where most of the woman are. 

B.54:  In teaching. 

A.55:  In teaching.  And, you know, and it's always been that way. 

B.56:  But not at the college level. 

A.57:  Right.  Not, well,

B.58:  We live in a college town and I worked at the university for a while. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And there are, there are woman there but they're not the high paid --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  Not department,

B.62:  -- #professors that,#

A.63:  # chairmen.  #

B.64:  the men are [laughter]. 

A.65:  Yeah.  Not the deans and things like that. 

B.66:  Well, they did have one woman dean but, and I guess she, she probably did
very well but that's the minority. 

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um, and do you think it's because women aren't qualified
or, or just don't, or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs. 

B.68:  None of the above [laughter]. 

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  I think they are extremely well qualified. 

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  Uh, I don't know how,

A.73:  They're just not selected somehow. 

B.74:  I think they're not selected,

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  And, of course, at this university, uh, this, it's a big engineering school
and I don't think there are many women in the engineering college. 

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  And that's where the high pay is. 

A.79:  Oh, okay.  But I'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering. 
Act-, but, you know, I say that but yet I know too. 

B.80:  Quite an, well, I think there are more than there used to be. 

A.81:  Yeah, I'm sure there are, yeah. 

B.82:  But they may not go into teaching,

A.83:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I mean, the two that I know obviously are not in teaching
but,

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.85:  # um, # it's, it-, I suppose in a since I was surprised when they told me
they majored in engineering.  I don't know why.  I, but I don't know that many
men that have majored in engineering,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # either.  # I mean it's just, because I'm in the humanities it's just,

B.88:  # Oh, uh-huh [laughter].  #

A.89:  # [Laughter]  You know, # it's not,

B.90:  # Yeah.  #

A.91:  # it's # not something that I tend to hear about. 

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  But, um, yeah, it's a,

B.94:  Well, I met one one day that, uh, had just joined the faculty in
agricultural engineering and that really surprised me.

A.95:  Oh, that's interesting,

B.96:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.97:  # Yeah.  # Yeah, I mean, I, I suppose that, that it's difficult to really
say why because, uh, you know, there, there probably are a limited number of
women who are interested in the subject and well qualified. 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  And maybe there aren't, you know, [laughter].  Maybe they don't apply for
the job. 

B.100:  I don't know.  I don't, I don't know how many go on and get a P H D in
engineering. 

A.101:  Right.  Right.  Which could be, you know, part-, partially cultural anyway.

B.102:  That could be.  That's true. 

A.103:  So that it might be circularly being the same problem of, of expecting not
to get hired for the good jobs anyway,

B.104:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.105:  # so # why spend your time getting qualified. 

B.106:  That's right. 

A.107:  It's a, it's a rough [laughter], 

B.108:  [Laughter]. 

A.109:  It's a rough, a rough situation.  Um, and I guess what I, what, ama-,
amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or
and, in our case we actually have one father who works part-time, a six,

B.110:  # Oh.  #

A.111:  # hour # day so that he can take the kids, kids or kid, I'm not sure,

B.112:  # That's interesting, #

A.113:  # to school # in the morning and be home when the children or child,

B.114:  # [Laughter].  #

A.115:  # comes # home in the afternoon. 

B.116:  Is it, uh, was she the major wage earner,

A.117:  # This is, uh, #

B.118:  # I mean, did # she earn more money that he did or --

A.119:  Well, see,

B.120:  -- # you know.  #

A.121:  # I don't know # anything about the family but, but, yeah, I would imagine
she might.  Um, because he's, you know, he's a really nice guy but he did say
that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a
technical situation that he had trouble finding a job. 

B.122:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.123:  So that maybe he, you know, maybe she was more qualified.  But, but still
it's interesting that, you know, he,

B.124:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.125:  # he's # been doing this evidently for a, a good number of years. 

B.126:  [Laughter]. 

A.127:  And, uh, but it's unusual. 

B.128:  Uh, I know one, uh, gal that's, she's a C P A, and her husband is a house
husband. 

A.129:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I,

B.130:  And then they had a child and he, he was still the house husband.  He
wasn't,

A.131:  # Oh, he was,#

B.132:  # going to, #

A.133:  even before they had children. 

B.134:  Uh-huh.  Even before that, right. 

A.135:  Oh, now that, that really is [laughter]. 

B.136:  She was a little perturbed about it. 

A.137:  Oh, she was. 

B.138:  At one time. 

A.139:  Uh-huh. 

B.140:  I don't know how, she's moved away.  I don't know how it is now but I know,
uh, we're, we all went out one evening and [lipsmack]  after work and, uh, she
was, there was an underlying note she was perturbed about it. 

A.141:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I mean I think that would be, it would, it would strike one
as strange if there's no reason for --

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  -- somebody to stay home that,

B.144:  I don't think there was a valid reason [laughter]. 

A.145:  Yeah [laughter].  That's true. 

B.146:  Because her statement was, I told him let's face it you're a house husband
that's what your going, that's what you'll always be. 

A.147:  [Laughter]. 

B.148:  [Laughter]. 

A.149:  But, but yet, you know we have to think about that because if, if she had
offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran-,

B.150:  She wouldn't have be, that's right.  Uh-huh, that's right. 

A.151:  # So, so we're, #

B.152:  # it would, it # wouldn't have been a ((doubter)).

A.153:  carrying our own prejudice [laughter]. 

B.154:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.  That's true. 

A.155:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Oh, gee. 

B.156:  [Laughter]. 

A.157:  I guess we can't win [laughter]. 

B.158:  Huh-uh.  Oh. 

A.159:  Because if, yeah, if, if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're
surprised.  But if [laughter]. 

B.160:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.161:  Oh, dear.  So, so,

B.162:  I think maybe more men would like to be if they [laughter]  --

A.163:  If they could get away with it [laughter]. 

B.164:  -- weren't put down so badly [laughter]. 

A.165:  [Laughter]  Oh, dear.  You know, well, uh, I mean it, it's an interesting
topic yet I must say it's not one that I've given a great deal of,

B.166:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.167:  # of # thought to but, uh,

B.168:  # No, I didn't.  #

A.169:  # in the past.  # It's, um, one of those things that, you know, seems to
happen. 

B.170:  How do you feel your career has gone?

A.171:  I don't, I don't feel for the most part that I've been discriminated
against. 

B.172:  You don't.  That's good. 

A.173:  No.  I was a department chairman.  I, but I don't like administration. 

B.174:  Oh. 

A.175:  So then I'm, uh, uh, probably a poor example, although, you know, I was an
administrator and could still be I suppose. 

B.176:  Uh-huh.  I was discriminated against very definitely in banking. 

A.177:  Uh-huh. 

B.178:  It was terrible. 

A.179:  Oh, really.  You were, you were more ambitious than they would let you be?

B.180:  Right.  And the money didn't go with the positions. 

A.181:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I would,

B.182:  The promotion, promotions came but there wer-, there comparable pay for the
responsibility. 

A.183:  Uh,

B.184:  And I was told you don't need as much pay as I have because your children
are older than my children, or your husband has a good job and [laughter]. 

A.185:  Oh, jeez. 

B.186:  [Laughter]. 

A.187:  Yeah, actually in a since I suppose, when I was hired into the government,
um, at, I was taken advantage of and, and that's true that, you know, sometimes
other people get, get higher increments,

B.188:  # I thi-, uh-huh.  #

A.189:  # for, you know, # even,

B.190:  I think we, uh, are programmed to just take it [laughter]  --

A.191:  Right. 

B.192:  -- as it comes. 

A.193:  Right.  That's probably true.  I hadn't, I hadn't thought about it because
I do like what I do and,

B.194:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.195:  # uh, # I just sort of ignore the administrative,

B.196:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.197:  # part # of it since I didn't like it when, when I had to do it. 

B.198:  [Laughter]. 

A.199:  So I, I figure, you know, nobody must, uh, nobody must like it.  It must be
a rotten job for everybody [laughter]. 

B.200:  [Laughter]. 

A.201:  But I know some people thrive on it [laughter].  Oh, gee.  Well, since I
don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic. 

B.202:  I don't,
