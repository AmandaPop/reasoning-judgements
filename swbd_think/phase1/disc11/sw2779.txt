======================================================================

A.1:  Now, we have to talk about the savings and loan scandal.

@B.2:  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.

A.3:  Do you have any strong opinions on that?

B.4:  Oh, absolutely.

A.5:  What are yours?

B.6:  I, I think, uh, it's all congresses fault.

A.7:  Well, I think there's a lot to be said for that point of view.  I, I really
think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people
there to carry away the water.

B.8:  Yep, and I think the real problem wasn't the regulation, which I supported,
but that they failed to (( )) regulate the insurance.

A.9:  Huh. 

B.10:  I mean, I think that was the real mistake,

A.11:  Well,

B.12:  they should have seen that coming.  It's, that was like giving away free
money, oh, sure we'll continue to in-, insure you cheaply but you can, you
know, do whatever you want with the way you loan the money.

A.13:  Right. 

B.14:  And it should have been do whatever we want with the way you loan the money
and by the way when you buy insurance, you know,

A.15:  You'll pay for it. 

B.16:  they're going to be looking at how you do it. 

A.17:  Absolutely. 

B.18:  Right?

A.19:  That,

B.20:  And then the guys what want it, spend it that way, sure I'll pay more for
insurance.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  I think that would have been a much smarter way to handle it, and
the other thing that would have helped a lot would be to make concern that,
[throat_clearing], the people who were going to use the money that we were
providing,

B.22:  Yep. 

A.23:  should have had their own at stake.  They should have had a lot more of
their own capital on the line. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  When they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of
dollars worth of taxpayers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than
that,

B.26:  Right. 

A.27:  then they have absolutely no incentive to, uh, treat it prudently.  They
just, uh, hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it.

B.28:  Absolutely.  Absolutely, because I mean, their return is guaranteed. 

A.29:  Uh-huh.  They have nothing to lose and everything to gain if they,

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  uh, can keep lending and keep growing,

B.32:  Right. 

A.33:  then they can take the big salaries and have the, all the perks and, uh,

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  entertainment and so forth and then,

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  uh, if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just,

B.38:  Sure, in fact, they're got a strong incentive to, uh, you know, guarantee
your money, your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in, you
know, the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is
high.

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  Uh, because if they win, they win big, and if they don't, who cares
[laughter].

A.41:  Yeah, they don't, #they don't lose,#

B.42:  #They don't lose.# 

A.43:  anything. 

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  Well, uh, I don't know what could have been done other than the, uh,
insurance regulations, but I certainly think that was a mistake and the, uh, I
also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred
thousand dollar when they were told up front that that was, uh,

B.46:  Yep. 

A.47:  uh, the limit. 

B.48:  Yep.  I agree with you there too. 

A.49:  Because,

B.50:  This,

A.51:  uh, the promises don't,

B.52:  this, the whole concept of too big to fail,

A.53:  Yeah, the promises,

B.54:  it's just silly. 

A.55:  don't mean anything now,

B.56:  Yep. 

A.57:  when, uh, the people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation,

B.58:  Right. 

A.59:  ((and)) they figure the taxpayers will bail them out because they have. 

B.60:  That's right.  And I also think the first thing they should have clarified
was that the taxpayer will give you a hundred thousand dollars maximum, I don't
care how many accounts you've got. 

A.61:  Absolutely.  Uh, I would have been in a little danger of, uh, you know, I
would have had to be very careful about where I put my money but I certainly,

B.62:  Right. 

A.63:  would have been alert, and I would not have just been chasing the
highest percentage return,

B.64:  # That's right, #

A.65:  # on a # C D. 

B.66:  and, I mean, it would have put these money brokers out of business. 

A.67:  Yeah, and I don't think,

B.68:  # Which, I mean, certainly contributed.  #

A.69:  # that's any great loss [laughter].  #

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  [Laughter]  We could do without a few of those. 

B.72:  Yep. 

A.73:  They don't seem to be providing very much useful, uh, service,

B.74:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.# 

A.75:  # to people.  #

B.76:  I mean if you invest in stocks or whatever, you know, it's, it's not just
the responsibility of your broker it's your responsibility, you know, to know
what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking,

A.77:  # Absolutely.  #

B.78:  # and # it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand
dollars or whatever the limit's going to be in a bank that you should be
aware.  I mean, it's one thing to have insurance and ((you're)) protecting the
little guy who doesn't have the time to make, or the expertise to make these
sorts of decisions but it's another thing that, you know, supposedly you would
think, hope that the big depositors like voters and everybody else are
supposed to be educated about what they're getting into.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Yes, you would and, uh, uh, I don't see why the, for large sums of
money, why it should be any different from investing in a C D, uh, I mean, in,
uh, uh, mutual fund or a,

B.80:  # Right.  #

A.81:  # money # market fund or something like that. 

B.82:  Absolutely. 

A.83:  Uh, there are no guarantees on them. 

B.84:  That's right. 

A.85:  You, uh, you trust that the broker won't sell because certain brokerage
houses will guarantee at least up a certain point the investments in the funds
that they manage, but, uh, then you're, uh, just at the mercy of them because
they can go under. 

B.86:  That's right, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, there is like for the brokerage houses,
there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage won't go bankrupt and you'll
lose your money, but there's certainly no guarantee that, for example, uh, the
commercial paper that the money market invests in won't become worthless,

A.87:  # That's right.  #

B.88:  # and your, # and your stock price will go down. 

A.89:  Yeah. 

B.90:  And that's fair enough. 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  Well, do you think that we're heading for another debacle of the
sort in the, uh, insurance industry?

B.92:  Uh, yes, I mean, yo-, there's got to be long, long-term consequences over
this, you know, just because,

A.93:  # And we ((see)), #

B.94:  # reimbursing this is # going to be a substantial ((cost)). The banks are
failing because of all their accounts that were these, you know, savings and
loans and stuff rate,

A.95:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.96:  # uh, # some ((of these things)) just got to spread,

A.97:  Well, I don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're
already how many trillion dollars in the hole.

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # where's # the money going to come from?

B.100:  Yep. 

A.101:  And yet the, we've got this enormous, uh, First Executive Insurance Company
just sailing out here in California, and, uh, maybe the people who have bought
term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium.  But
all those, uh, people who have money invested in, uh, uh, annuities,

B.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.103:  # for # their retirement are,

B.104:  # Huh.  #

A.105:  # going # to be up a creek, and I don't know who's going to bail them out. 

B.106:  Yep.  It's a problem. 

A.107:  They're al-, there are already a few companies that had switched over from
their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting
their benefit checks this month. 

B.108:  Huh. 

A.109:  And they, the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those
people, but how are we going to do that?

B.110:  Uh-huh. 

A.111:  Where the state itself is already in hock and we're running thirteen
million dollars, no, billion, sorry, thirteen billion dollars in the hole for
the next fiscal year and yo-, we've got to come up with that money because
they can't run a deficit the way the federal government can,

B.112:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.113:  # and they're going # to have to be laying people off out here in the
states.  Some of whom [laughter], I don't think anybody will miss,

B.114:  # Yeah.  #

A.115:  # but # when it gets down to teachers and cops, it makes a difference. 

B.116:  Uh-huh, well, if only they don't, you know, pull the usually firemen first
scam, right?

A.117:  Well the,

B.118:  Pay more taxes or the firemen go first. 

A.119:  Yeah, I think that's absolutely unconscionable.  They keep all their,

B.120:  # Yeah.  #

A.121:  # fancy, # uh, perks in the legislature,

B.122:  # Yeah.  #

A.123:  # and # they, uh, still do their junketing and they still have all their,
uh, I think it's something like twenty-five, uh, people on the payroll per
legislator,

B.124:  # Huh.  #

A.125:  # you # kn-, I, I came fr-, out here to California from Texas and I can
very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every
year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution required, and
people,

B.126:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.127:  # consistently voted it # down.  It says [laughter] they do enough damage
every two years think of,

B.128:  # That's right.  #

A.129:  # where we'd # be if we let them meet yearly. 

B.130:  Yep. 

A.131:  [Laughter]  And I really feel that way about the California ones too. 

B.132:  Uh-huh. 

A.133:  I, I, I think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation
and let things settle down, maybe we could figure out what, in fact, we need
and start over.

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  But anyway. 

B.136:  Yep, I think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea. 

A.137:  Uh-huh, yep.  I, I would vote for that. 

B.138:  Uh-huh. 

A.139:  Well, it's been interesting talking to you and I think we're in,

B.140:  # Yeah it's been good.  #

A.141:  # pretty much agreement on # this [laughter]. 

B.142:  Yep.  I think so too. 

A.143:  Thanks for talking. 

B.144:  We'll see you. 

A.145:  B-, bye-bye. 

B.146:  Bye.
