==========================================================================

B.1:  All right, uh, what kind of recent camping experience do you have?

A.2:  Well, there are several things that we've done as a family, uh, as far as,
uh, when we go on vacation, we have four children and so it's difficult
sometimes for us to afford the hotel all the time. 

B.3:  Uh-huh. 

A.4:  And so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at
camping.  My husband and my son are scouts and are very adept at that kind of
thing and so it makes it a successful thing.  You know, we just pitch the tent
and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because
there are a lot of them across the United States now. 

B.5:  # Right.  #

A.6:  # And, # um, an, uh, uh, like I said our kids are just really good and we
have a four year old and even he's not any big problem with it. 

B.7:  Oh that's good, yeah. 

A.8:  Yeah. 

B.9:  I think it's, uh, it's a lot of fun, uh, my camping experiences have been
mostly with my son who was in the scouts. 

A.10:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.11:  # He's, # he's, huh, he thinks he's an adult now but,

A.12:  # [Laughter].  #

B.13:  # uh, # we started camping with the Cub Scouts,

A.14:  Uh-huh. 

B.15:  and, uh, camped, uh, you know for several years with the, with the Boy
Scouts, and, and went to some of the scout, uh, camp sites around and,

A.16:  #They're nice too.# 

B.17:  #we've had, really had a good time,# uh, with that. 

A.18:  Yeah, um, and I was a den mother for a while too,

B.19:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.20:  # and, uh, # like they have a thing called Mom and Me,

B.21:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.22:  # and # that's right, you'd go out with them, even the mothers do. 

B.23:  # Yeah, but, uh, #

A.24:  # And camp over # night, so. 

B.25:  our first, uh, first camping experience was, uh, the fathers took the,
the, uh, Webelows, I guess it was, camping, uh, and we went over to, uh, a lake
over in East Texas and w-, my son and I borrowed a, one of these pop up trailer
tents. 

A.26:  Oh, how fun. 

B.27:  And it rained, it started raining about the time we left home and it
rained, uh, like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday
and it was still raining Sunday morning.  We went over and set up camp and,
you know, stayed there over night.  We couldn't do anything, so as soon as we
woke up Sunday morning we, you know, we had breakfast and then we all came
back home.

A.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.29:  # But # I think he and I were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to
speak,

A.30:  # Yes, yeah [laughter].  #

B.31:  # but, uh, most # of the, most of our camping experiences have been, you
know, pup tent type,

A.32:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.33:  # you # know, little two men tents, on the ground and sleeping in a bed
roll, you know, and that kind of thing so, it's i-,

A.34:  We did have a really bad experience, uh, we went to Corpus Christi one year
and, uh, while we were there we l-, uh, had camped on kind of a sandy ground
area instead of, uh, the hard firm, uh, dirt ground. 

B.35:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.36:  # And # in the night there came a very, uh, windy type weather, and it blew
our stakes out an, and the, the tent fell. 

B.37:  Oh yeah, tha-, tha-, that's always bad when the tent falls on you in the
middle of the night. 

A.38:  Yeah, yeah, so that wasn't too exciting,

B.39:  # Yeah.  #

A.40:  # but # good experience for us to know that we definitely didn-, needed to
do the stakes into a firm ground. 

B.41:  Right, yeah.  You need to be on higher ground sometime,

A.42:  # Yeah.  #

B.43:  # you # don't want the, if, th-, if it's going to rain you don't want the
water to run down into your tents, so. 

A.44:  Exactly, exactly. 

B.45:  But, uh, yeah we had, we've had some really good experiences, i-, it's been
several years since I've been camping,

A.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.47:  # but, # uh, as a matter of fact, my son, uh, is camping now.  He camps
every weekend. 

A.48:  # Oh, how fun.  #

B.49:  # He, he's, uh, # involved with the, uh, Scarborough Fair,

A.50:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.51:  down at Waxahachie.  And he goes down there on, uh, Sa-, on, uh, Friday
night and camps,

A.52:  # And stays, huh.  #

B.53:  # and stays, uh, # Friday night and Saturday night, and then comes back
home after it closes Sunday.  So, he has a tent that's, I guess he's got a
permanent tent site, for his tent stays down there all week, you know, and he
just goes down and spends the weekend down there.

A.54:  # Well that sounds neat.  Yeah.  #

B.55:  # So he's really having a # good time camping and, and, you know, his
experiences that he got from scouting have really, you know been good for him,
uh, from that.  He, he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he
learned, so. 

A.56:  See that's, that's very nice.  The only thing I think about camping is when
you have to cook outdoors,

B.57:  # Yeah.  #

A.58:  # and # you don't always have to do that but, uh, we have a dutch oven and,

B.59:  # Yeah.  #

A.60:  # and # we found some really fun recipes that we can do in that, that are
quite tasteful. 

B.61:  Do you, uh, do you do the cooking in the coals where you wrap everything in
foil and,

A.62:  We've done that before, uh-huh. 

B.63:  Yeah, that's, we, uh, my, my wife and I took the, uh, the scout leadership
training program,

A.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.65:  # and # we really had a good time with that.  We did have a, uh, I guess it
was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food, you know,

A.66:  # Oh [laughter].  #

B.67:  # that we # didn't have set up.  I think it actually went into the tent
with, uh, with a couple of ladies that were in our group.  You know, went in
an, and got stuff out of their tent.  But, uh,

A.68:  Oh ((jeepers)).

B.69:  But th-, uh, you know, it was, uh, it was a fun time and we, we've enjoyed
camping, what, you know, what little we've done, uh. 

A.70:  Uh-huh, well I think camping is one of those things that you can make
memories with, so,

B.71:  # Right (( )). #

A.72:  # I think it's # a wonderful activity.  And it's jus-,

B.73:  We went, uh, one time, one time with a, uh, another group, or with the, the
scouting group but it was the parents, uh, you know, it was a family camp out.
And one of the things was that, uh, the, uh, we had, uh, uh, a couple that
were, uh, from India.

A.74:  # Oh.  #

B.75:  # And # they demonstrated cooking some Indian food, out, you know, on a, on
a little gas burner type thing out there,

A.76:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.77:  # you # know, it was part of our, our entertainment, you know for the
thing.  They cooked some kind of, uh, of an Indian pastry type thing on a, in
a skillet, you know, so it was really, it was really interesting.  We went to,
uh, down to Glen Rose,

A.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.79:  # to # the, uh, where the dinosaur tracks are. 

A.80:  # Yeah.  #

B.81:  # And # there's a campsite, you know, down there in that area that we, uh,
that we went to. 

A.82:  Well, I'm from Utah an,

B.83:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.84:  # before # we moved to Texas and, uh, I, I see the different kinds of
camping there are.  You know, like the mountain camping and then here it's
mostly flatland,

B.85:  # Right, [wheezing]  uh-huh.  #

A.86:  # and, uh, I'm # not sure which I like better, it's kind of nice to be on
flat land. 

B.87:  Yeah, right. 

A.88:  But, but I think you get a more scenic type thing in there, so. 

B.89:  Right, yeah, so.  If you haven't camped down around at that place down
around Glen Rose, you might enjoy that,

A.90:  #No, I don't think we've ever gone there.# 

B.91:  #uh, you know, it's got some,# it's got some hills and stuff down there,
so. 

A.92:  Oh, that sounds nice. 

B.93:  Yeah, but, uh,

A.94:  [Breathing] [laughter] Well thank you. 

B.95:  Yeah, well, I've enjoyed it, and, uh,

A.96:  # I've enjoyed talking to you.  #

B.97:  # ma-, you make me want # to go camping again, you know. 

A.98:  Well go, go, go [laughter]. 

B.99:  Okay, thanks. 

A.100:  Have a good day. 

B.101:  You too, bye-bye. 

A.102:  Bye-bye.
