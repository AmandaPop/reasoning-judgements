@A.1:  Okay, what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
[laughter]. 

B.2:  [Laughter]  Have a big family, I guess, that's a start. 

A.3:  Well I guess so. 

B.4:  # [Laughter].  #

A.5:  # Have # you had any in the la-, ha-, well how old are you?

B.6:  Twenty-five, so,

A.7:  # Okay so you ha-, #

B.8:  # I just got married.  #

A.9:  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps. 

B.10:  Right, every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh,
like my p-, grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their
kids and grandkids. 

A.11:  Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know? 

B.12:  Well, we plan on it, it's like the third weekend in August,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # so # it's every four years and so,

A.15:  So they all know it. 

B.16:  Yeah and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for
you know, um, food and whose, whose staying where, because a lot of people
fro-, are from down here, in Texas.

A.17:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.18:  And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.  That's where I'm originally
from. 

A.19:  Yes. 

B.20:  So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake
and, uh, make a couple days of it. 

A.21:  Well that sounds like fun, do they all have the small children too, that
come?

B.22:  Yeah, pretty much. 

A.23:  So all ages. 

B.24:  Yeah and, uh, [throat_clearing] you know, there's some my age and then
there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.

A.25:  Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,

B.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.27:  # and # they don't ever plan it li-, as, like you do. 

B.28:  # Uh-huh [breathing].  #

A.29:  # I think # if you can count on it every four years then people have it in
mind so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together
about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,

B.30:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # because # they're rather socially active too. 

B.32:  # Yeah.  #

A.33:  # And # so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can
pretty much get everybody there.  If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh
we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend
with somebody else and we're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed
to be okay for them.

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families. 

B.36:  Oh. 

A.37:  Therefore, they don't have many people left. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh, I haven't known many of those
people, but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate
family and that's been very nice, with, uh, I have one sister,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # and # three brothers and they're only three out of five of us who have
children. 

B.42:  Oh. 

A.43:  So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other. 

B.44:  # Yeah.  #

A.45:  # And # that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so
large,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # and # they don't see each other very often, we don't really know many of
them. 

B.48:  Yeah, that's kind of bad. 

A.49:  It really is, they're fun, they're a lot of fun,

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # but, # uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis and, uh, you
kind of forget what happened, [laughter] and who they were from the time
before. 

B.52:  Yeah, it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.  A lot of my
cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings
and stuff like that, so. 

A.53:  Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?

B.54:  # Uh, no, #

A.55:  # Or you # go to Indiana on that?

B.56:  the ones in Indiana, uh-huh. 

A.57:  Uh-huh, where in Indiana?

B.58:  Lafayette. 

A.59:  Lafayette, I don't know where, I used to live in Indianapolis.

B.60:  Yeah, it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour. 

A.61:  Yeah, yeah, it's very pretty country in there I think, it's gorgeous. 

B.62:  Uh-huh, so. 

A.63:  Well I, uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now. 

B.64:  [Laughter] Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation the
next one was when I graduated from college, so I guess about two more years.

A.65:  Yes, well, and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
[laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter]  Uh, maybe, I don't know,

A.67:  # Maybe [laughter].  #

B.68:  # two more # years, I don't know, probably. 

A.69:  I mean you need another milestone, you know. 

B.70:  Yeah, I guess that's, that's what, I mean I've been married now for about
nine months so that was another milestone, I guess [throat_clearing].

A.71:  Yes, well I'm sure, and ha-, then all of your family probably has not met
your husband. 

B.72:  Um, yeah, he's from Indiana,

A.73:  # Oh, is he?  #

B.74:  # so they all # met, yeah. 

A.75:  And, and he's living, your both living in Sherman. 

B.76:  Yeah. 

@@A.77:  Do you work to T I?

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  Uh-huh, and does he?

B.80:  No, he's trying to get in med school, so. 

A.81:  Uh-huh, well, we don't either, but, uh, I have a friend who, uh, is working
on this project. 

B.82:  Oh, really. 

A.83:  Yes, and,

B.84:  Are they getting all the data they need?

A.85:  Well, I don't know, uh, I, I have a hard time getting, uh, people on the
telephone. 

B.86:  Oh really. 

A.87:  Uh-huh, getting through to anybody.  Sometimes I call off and on all day,

B.88:  # Huh.  #

A.89:  # but # anyway, uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family
reunions aren't we [laughter]. 

B.90:  [Laughter]. 

A.91:  But I got off that. 

B.92:  [Laughter]  Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess. 

A.93:  Yes, well, um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half
minutes. 

B.94:  Oh, okay. 

A.95:  And, uh, uh, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure. 

B.96:  Oh yeah. 

A.97:  [Laughter] But it has been fun talking to you. 

B.98:  Well you too. 

A.99:  Thank you. 

B.100:  And maybe I'll talk to you again. 

A.101:  Okay, good. 

B.102:  #Okay, bye-bye.# 

A.103:  #Bye-bye.#
