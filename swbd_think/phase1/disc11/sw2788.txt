out at the end.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what kind of ex-, do you have children?

B.2:  Yeah, we have one that's seventeen, one that's fifteen, and one that's just
now six. 

A.3:  Oh, okay. 

B.4:  And we had kind of a hard time finding someplace (( )) we could put
Michael's ((goods)), his birthday is the first of September,

A.5:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.6:  # and # he was going to school at five. 

A.7:  Oh. 

B.8:  So, he started the first grade when he was five or,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # started, # yeah, first grade when he was five years old. 

A.11:  And you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five. 

B.12:  Yeah,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # so, # we could, you know, we tried to find him someplace where he could
learn something. 

A.15:  Right. 

B.16:  And it was, uh,

A.17:  # But, #

B.18:  # mediocre # expensive, it wasn't really that expensive,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # but # it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child
and expect him to learn something.

A.21:  To learn something.  And that's, I mean, that's [laughter],  even not only
toddlers but, you know, ((even)) your older children. 

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  It's hard to find anywhere they're really going to learn something. 

B.24:  Yeah, well,

A.25:  And then, yeah, you do have to pay, you know, if you, the better the place,
the more you're going to pay. 

B.26:  Yeah, but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway [laughter]. 

A.27:  True, very true.  It's,

B.28:  You know, my wife works so,

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # it # costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go
to the baby-sitter so.  {Very faint} We try to,

A.31:  If I had any children I would, uh, I hope that I'll be in a position to
stay home with my child because I'm not real, uh, uh, trusting [laughter], of
a lot of people,

B.32:  # Yeah, see I don't know, #

A.33:  # uh, especially today.  People, I # work in the news business and I just
see different things all the time,

B.34:  # Yeah.  #

A.35:  # and # people are just crazy these days.  They're crazy and,

B.36:  # Yeah.  #

A.37:  # [Laughter]  # and I don't, you know, it takes me a, takes me a long time
to just trust someone as a friend,

B.38:  # Yeah.  #

A.39:  # much # less to, you know, trust someone with my, with my child. 

B.40:  Well, see we took our time and we checked it out,

A.41:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.42:  # and we found # a preschool for him. 

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  And it, you know, through other folks where I, where I work, I work at T I.

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  So, through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool it was
actually at a licensed preschool,

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # you # know, we, had those requirements,

A.49:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.# 

B.50:  # so, #

A.51:  I guess that's the best way, you know, to get,

B.52:  # Yeah.  #

A.53:  # recommendations # from your friends or,

B.54:  # I know, I'm, well,#

A.55:  # family members.  #

B.56:  that and, you know, I don't think I would have left him anywhere that
would, I would have stayed home with him first,

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # before # I left him somewhere that, you know, they still have unlicensed
baby-sitters running around up here and,

A.59:  # Huh.  #

B.60:  # you # know, I just, I, I don't think I'd take that chance. 

A.61:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

B.62:  You know, I think it's out of sight or out of mind,

A.63:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.64:  # for less # than,

A.65:  I mean you have to be, you've #got to be sure,#

B.66:  # for more than, #

A.67:  that these people,

B.68:  a minute or so. 

A.69:  I mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything,

B.70:  # But you never know.  #

A.71:  # but you just have # to be sure that they're going to be watching them,
you know,

B.72:  # Yeah.  #

A.73:  # that # they wouldn't let them drink something or, you know, eat something
off the floor,

B.74:  # Yeah.  #

A.75:  # you # know, just simple things,

B.76:  # But you, you know, as,#

A.77:  # that can be harmful.  #

B.78:  as far as (( )) child abuse is these days you never know,

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.80:  # you # don't know who you can trust,

A.81:  # Huh.  #

B.82:  # and # who you can't, you know. 

A.83:  Then you hear so much, you know, on the news about, uh, child care places
and also, um, senior care facilities, you know, you hear abuse. 

B.84:  Yeah, senior care, is getting real bad. 

A.85:  Yeah, and so you just, you just don't know, and you almost want to, you
know, spend a couple of weeks with, in class with your child just to see how it
is or something. 

B.86:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

A.87:  But,

B.88:  So, you have no children at all. 

A.89:  No, I don't.  Huh-uh. 

B.90:  {Very faint} Gee. 

A.91:  No.  I'm,

B.92:  Do you miss that part in your life or,

A.93:  Uh, no, I'm only, I'm twenty-three so I,

B.94:  # Yeah.  #

A.95:  # still # have a little bit of time,

B.96:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.97:  # um, it's # just not in the cards for me right now I'm trying to get my
career going.  And,

B.98:  I imagine,

A.99:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.100:  # yeah, # working in the news production,

A.101:  # Yeah.  #

B.102:  # anyway # back to the subject,

A.103:  # Yeah.  #

B.104:  # we # should have discussed this earlier,

A.105:  # [Laughter].  #

B.106:  # but # anyway, it's tough,

A.107:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.108:  # it really is, # it's hard to find good child care,

A.109:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # and it's hard # to find someplace where you can leave your child and
trust that he's,

A.111:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.112:  # going # to be fine all day long. 

A.113:  And you brought up a good point, you know,

B.114:  # And, #

A.115:  # about # learning, you just don't want a baby-sitter you, you would hope
that maybe they'd come home and know some of their A B C's or something, you
know, get them,

B.116:  Yeah, you know, and he's, he's doing real well, it, it, it has paid off for
him. 

A.117:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

B.118:  He's in first grade now,

A.119:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.120:  # and he's, you # know, got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade
math level. 

A.121:  Huh. 

B.122:  So, you know, those early ages when he would, you know, when his mom and
dad are at work,

A.123:  # Yeah.  #

B.124:  # and # he's actually in child care in a preschool not,

A.125:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.126:  # just # child care,

A.127:  # Right.  #

B.128:  # you # know, we could have sent him to anybody,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # you # know, there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him but
sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something,

A.131:  # Right.  #

B.132:  # has # paid off not only for us, his, his attitude is I think a little
bit,

A.133:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.134:  # tall for a # six year old and, you know, but his,

A.135:  Did you take this same, uh, route with your other two children?

B.136:  Um, they, they were outside my marriage,

A.137:  # Okay {very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.138:  # so, I don't know.  #

A.139:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  I was wondering how,

B.140:  I would say, no, but, you know, all my children,

A.141:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.142:  # excel, they're, they're # really good,

A.143:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.144:  # and I guess, # no, he learns from the older boys too but,

A.145:  Right.  And it helps that he has older brothers, uh,

B.146:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.147:  # you know, # just to have role models and things like that. 

B.148:  Yeah, seeing like, uh, in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all
boys, but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman
in the house for my wife to share, but, you know,

A.149:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.150:  # so, we # faced that too but,

A.151:  # Huh.  #

B.152:  # he # learns quite a bit, he learned quite a bit from, not only from
nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys,

A.153:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.154:  # and, # you know, he's excelled and it's paying off for him, it really is.
He's,

A.155:  # That's excellent.  #

B.156:  # he is # pretty smart, sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed,

A.157:  # Uh-huh [laughter].  #

B.158:  # but [laughter]  # he is smart {very faint}, you know. 

A.159:  Well, what kid isn't [laughter], 

B.160:  # Yeah.  #

A.161:  # these # days, so. 

B.162:  But I think it's important, I think it's really nice to know that you can
find someplace, I don't know, you know, how it is down there in Waco,

A.163:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.164:  # but in Lubbock # we have a few that you can send your children to and
they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat.  And,

A.165:  Do they have any kind of program like at T I or wherever your wife works,
um,

B.166:  # No, not in, #

A.167:  # some ((in)) kind # of day care?

B.168:  Huh-uh.  We just,

A.169:  Huh, because I know they're, they're putting that into a lot of, uh,
corporations now. 

B.170:  Yeah, they're trying to.  The federal government is trying to ((intercede))
on that too,

A.171:  # Right.  #

B.172:  # so, # no, we don't get,

A.173:  So, maybe that will be an option for,

B.174:  Well, it would be nice, you know, there,

A.175:  But then I, I foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much
learning but, you know,

B.176:  # Yeah, there's not, well, #

A.177:  # kind of somebody to # just watch your kid while your at work. 

B.178:  You know, where, where we sent Michael the first few years was, there was
different teachers all the time, you know, some,

A.179:  # Huh.  #

B.180:  # girls # were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in
the afternoon,

A.181:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.182:  # and # they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all
day. 

A.183:  Right. 

B.184:  You know, and then (( )) they had a group of kids and they put on skits and
they put on plays,

A.185:  # Huh.  #

B.186:  # and # they did the Halloween thing,

A.187:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.188:  # and # the Valentine's Day things and it's, you know, it was important to
us,

A.189:  # Huh.  #

B.190:  # so # we, you know, we took a good look at it and made sure it was going
to go that way.

A.191:  Do you think it would have been better for him to have, um, maybe one
continuous teacher, somebody to, that he could, uh,

B.192:  # Um, #

A.193:  # get # attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different,

B.194:  No, because I think, you know, as a child growing up I think is a task that
belongs to his parents. 

A.195:  Uh-huh. 

B.196:  I don't think he needed to be attached to too, even though he did,

A.197:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.198:  # you # know, he attached himself to a couple of those,

A.199:  # Right.  #

B.200:  # but # I think his attachments at home and, you know, he gets the idea of
what school is for and, uh, you know, I have different teachers,

A.201:  # {Very faint} Huh.  #

B.202:  # here and this # person can teach me one thing and this person teach,
teach me another and, no, so, I, I, I really can't say that it would be, it's
important for him to attach himself to anybody.

A.203:  Right, huh. 

B.204:  He did well,

A.205:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.206:  # you # with, with another child I can't say that. 

A.207:  Right. 

B.208:  Because I don't have that experience. 

A.209:  Yeah, each child is individual,

B.210:  # Yeah, see.  #

A.211:  # ((in life)) # learning and things. 

B.212:  But I don't have that experience, so, I can't say that,

A.213:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.214:  # you # know, he did well, so, I don't think we made too many mistakes. 

A.215:  Right.  Well, it sounds good,

B.216:  # We tried hard.  #

A.217:  # sounds like he's # doing real well. 

B.218:  Yeah, he's doing real well. 

A.219:  Huh, good. 

B.220:  And he learned from it so, and that was the most important thing that we
wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day.
You know, baby-sat sounds to me like, well, you're here, I guess I'll watch
you when I get time.

A.221:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.222:  You know, maybe I'll clean my house, maybe I'll cook you lunch,

A.223:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.224:  # maybe # I won't, you know, and,

A.225:  And they'll probably sit him in front of the television,

B.226:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.227:  # you know, # while they do other things, yeah. 

B.228:  Yeah, and I don't, you know,

A.229:  # Huh.  #

B.230:  # I # don't allow that when he's at home so, but we had a good experience,

A.231:  # Yeah.  #

B.232:  # and # we really did well. 

A.233:  Well, that's good, that's good. 

B.234:  So, and he did, he served better than we did, you know, he gained, he
actually gained from it, you know, sure we gained from it,

A.235:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.236:  # because # we were allowed to continue our employment and,

A.237:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.238:  # continue # our family but I think in the long run he gained from it just
being somewhere where we learned something,

A.239:  # That's great.  #

B.240:  # instead of # just sitting around watching T V,

A.241:  # Right, right.  #

B.242:  # and playing # all day.  And it's important. 

A.243:  That's probably what I'll try and look for whenever I do have [laughter] my
children,

B.244:  # Yeah.  #

A.245:  # I # don't know when that will be,

B.246:  # Yeah.  #

A.247:  # but, # um, you know, just really look into, it will, it will take me a
long time to find somewhere I'm sure,

B.248:  # Yeah, well, #

A.249:  # just because # I, I just want to be, I want to be so positive that, you
know, my children are okay,

B.250:  # Yeah.  #

A.251:  # as # well as the other children in the center, you know. 

B.252:  Well, you know, his Mom didn't go back to work until, you know, when he was
six months old. 

A.253:  Uh-huh. 

B.254:  And we just didn't want to dump him somewhere,

A.255:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.256:  # and # make him feel like he wasn't wanted. 

A.257:  Exactly. 

B.258:  And we wanted his center of attention at home but,

A.259:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.260:  # we # did what we could and it, it worked out real well, I'm glad,

A.261:  # It's difficult these day, #

B.262:  # we were so careful.  #

A.263:  It's, it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents
working a lot of times,

B.264:  # Oh, yeah, you know.  #

A.265:  # and, so, you have # to find day care,

B.266:  # Well, it, #

A.267:  # whereas, you # know, here,

B.268:  Most of the time now it's a necessity,

A.269:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.270:  # you # can't afford,

A.271:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.272:  # so, # you know, I'm not making seventy or thir-, eighty thousand dollars
a year so,

A.273:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.274:  # it's # pretty tough. 

A.275:  {Very faint} No choice, so child care's a necessity, whereas years ago, you
know, the husband basically worked and the wife,

B.276:  # Yeah, and, #

A.277:  # basically stayed # home. 

B.278:  Mom, Mom was allowed to stay home and,

A.279:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.280:  # you # know, there was a few families outside of that where dad stayed
home and mom worked but not very many that I know of when I was growing up,

A.281:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.282:  # and, you know, # I'm forty now but, you know, when I was a kid Mom was
always at home. 

A.283:  Right. 

B.284:  So, we didn't,

A.285:  I think that has a lot to do with just, just all children how they learn
and things just because the basic family is, is breaking, you know,

B.286:  # Yeah, it is, yeah it is, #

A.287:  # the basic family is not there # anymore. 

B.288:  I'll agree with that, it is.  It's, it's not there. 

A.289:  Uh-huh.  I think that plays a big part in, in a child's learning and, you
know, what they can and cannot do in child care. 

B.290:  Yeah. 

A.291:  I don't think,
