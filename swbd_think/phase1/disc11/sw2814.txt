REMARKS:	On the monologue for Caller A, you can hear Caller B sometimes 
very loudly, then faintly, then loud again and it is not the Caller that is 
making the variations.  Caller B's monologue was fine, although you could 
hear Caller A.

============================================================================

@A.1:  Uh, [throat_clearing]  what, have you had any home repairs done lately on
your home?

B.2:  Yeah, that's, that's something, um, yeah, we have.  It's a very timely
subject I think in the Spring everybody decides that they're going to start
over and do something with their house.  And we started last year an we have a
little I guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and
I here, but, um, we decided that, uh, we wanted to build a sun room and, um,
it's a good thing we got a contractor.  I mean this is not something you need
to do by yourself.  So we ended up with a contractor and went through that
whole schmeal with, um, the contractor saying one thing and then doing another
and, and, uh, anyway we ended up with, uh, a really neat sun room on the back
of the house.  It's beautiful, it's like two hundred square foot.  But, that's
not, um, something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs, um,
Tom's real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden, so that's about it.

A.3:  Yeah, we, uh, [throat_clearing]  of course, we have a new house that we've,
uh, that we bought about a year ago and it's been a chore just getting the, uh,
builder to come back and finish everything up the way it's supposed to. 

B.4:  Isn't that amazing. 

A.5:  Uh, yeah, it's been an experience [laughter]. 

B.6:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

A.7:  # It's one # I don't want to repeat anytime soon.  But we've had some, we
haven't had anything really major wrong, other than, uh, we did have like a
water leak in the wall in the, in the garage, and, and, uh, the water heater
upstairs, in the attic, it, uh, had a little leak and leaked down in, uh, under
the ceiling and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint,
you know, treat the ceiling, but nothing,

B.8:  # Yeah.  #

A.9:  # nothing # major.  Those, those kind of things really weren't major, uh,
just some of those kind of things that can happen.  But, uh, just getting him
out there to finish up and that sort of thing was, has been a real effort
[throat_clearing]. 

B.10:  All those little details that you, you don't really understand, you know,

A.11:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.12:  # like # we had some water leaks in the, um, well in the sun room there was
a part that was fiberboard and, you know, tape and bed over that and when it
did rain, of course, the only way to tell if this place leaks is to see if,
what happens after it rains.

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # And # of course it leaked [laughter].  Um, which is no big deal because
they said they'd come fix it.  Well that's true but, you know, fixing the tape
and bedding to make it look nice again, it's,

A.15:  It's hard, it's hard to make it fit perfectly,

B.16:  it's, it's a chore and a half, without tearing the whole thing out and
repainting and doing everything again. 

A.17:  Well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in
ceiling, the little, uh,

B.18:  # Oh.  #

A.19:  # the # little, the little, you know, uh, Styrofoam balls that they paint
over. 

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # So # it was easy to disguise that, but, uh, it was in an area where you
don't really look at very much, so we were lucky in that respect. 

B.22:  I don't know, I guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect
and you know what, this isn't a perfect world. 

A.23:  No, however, I do think that,

B.24:  # It, but you do, #

A.25:  # a lot of times # contractors try to get out of doing things that they say
they're going to do and, uh. 

B.26:  Oh, I know, because every time they send somebody out they have to take
them off a crew that's making money doing a job and they have to send them
back to you, where they're not making any money trying to repair something,
that you know, should have been right in the first place.

A.27:  Yeah, and, and then they don't do a real good job doing it too. 

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # They # just, kind of get, get it done as quickly as possible. 

B.30:  Well, I was real happy with our contractor, um, actually I wasn't happy
with the contractor, I was happy with the job foreman, so I think that made
all the difference, because he was pretty, um, you know, concerned about how
it looked and, and, you know, how it should be done the right way.  And he
gave us a lot of clues.  You just wish you knew all this stuff going in that,
um, it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to
do in addition to this, you know, like the tape and bedding, and, and doing,
finishing off this wall and that wall, that wasn't in the contract, you know,
kind of thing.

A.31:  # Yeah, they, #

B.32:  # So that # was kind of interesting. 

A.33:  I, I like when they come in, of course, I designed my own house, I'm, I,
I've had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that,

B.34:  # Oh neat.  #

A.35:  # so I # know basically if it's done right. 

B.36:  # Oh yeah.  #

A.37:  # The problem # is I don't want to do anymore, I want someone to do it for
me. 

B.38:  # [Laughter].  #

A.39:  # And, # uh, just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to
do is a real effort.

B.40:  Yeah, well we've taken this another step further this year, we're going to
build a deck.  We've got some people building, uh, a deck out in the back, you
know, to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing, and, um,

A.41:  Well I could recommend something there, if, if, you know, if, if it's not
just cost prohibitive --

B.42:  Oh yeah. 

A.43:  -- for you.  Uh, I've built probably three decks on three different houses
--

B.44:  Oh. 

A.45:  -- and the first time I went with regular just treated pine,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # kind # of a ((womanized)) pine, and then I, I tr-, spray treated it with
some, um, um, ((panta)) oil which you have to do about every two years.

B.48:  Okay. 

A.49:  The problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have
to start replacing boards. 

B.50:  I was wondering about that, yeah. 

A.51:  The second time, I did it out of cedar, which I soaked in Thompson water
seal. 

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  And that works fine,

B.54:  # You soaked it.  #

A.55:  # but there again, # i-, it discolors real bad. 

B.56:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.57:  # You know # the sun and everything else, it just makes it look gray and
dull an, and it doesn't look attractive after a few years.  The wood lasts
fine, but the color,

B.58:  # The color is, #

A.59:  # I was real # dissatisfied. 

B.60:  what you're, yeah sometimes after. 

A.61:  And if you can stand the additional expense, which yo-, you'll recoup
after a while because it will last forever, is the redwood, if you'll go with
the redwood. 

B.62:  That's, that's what we're doing is just the redwood, and we're doing it
where they use the screws that are, um, they're not nails, they're, the screws
have,

A.63:  They're screws, the self adhesive screws, all right. 

B.64:  Yeah, those and so they're not going to split and, and I was really
concerned about bugs, really, when I, when we were considering other types of
wood because, you know, termites can be a real hazard around here. 

A.65:  You have to pretty much spray them regularly, you know, under an, and
around or whatever, so you want to leave yourself, uh, enough space to get
under it or, or be able to lift it up on some ends.  A lot of times they won't
even detach them to the ground.  They just lay them up on some cinder blocks,
underneath in the ground.

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  And they're heavy enough where they won't, the wind won't pick them up or
they won't shift if it's big enough and heavy enough. 

B.68:  # Yeah.  #

A.69:  # So, # they're several ways of doing it but the redwood is by, by far the
best and I would, and I would also insist on that they do treat that with
Thompson's water seal. 

B.70:  Yeah, that's, that's the end part that's where you, you know, get the, uh,
that's the part we have to do [laughter].  We got that up front, we figured it
out, you know, we need to know what we need to do, uh, that's not included in
this and that's one of the, uh, details, but, that's fine as long as they tell
you. 

A.71:  # Yeah.  #

B.72:  # It's # so funny because Tom is getting more and more adept at doing
things it's just things like painting just, always used to really scare him,
he didn't know where to start.  Um, you know, with a paint can, you know, an,

A.73:  Well it is, it's, it's a frightening experience. 

B.74:  # It sure is.  #

A.75:  # The one thing # you might do, if he will deliver the boards that he is
going to make the under structure with,

B.76:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.77:  # before # he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water
seal,

B.78:  # Oh and do the water seal before.  #

A.79:  # on those and then when he cuts # them and puts them together, then
that'll already be treated.  And a fast way of doing that, if you'll go get a
piece of guttering material like a little trough,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # And # co-, cover both ends or some sort of something that that will fit
in,

B.82:  Okay, I got you covered there. 

A.83:  and pour that in, pour the wa-, Thompson's water seal in there and just put
that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in. 

B.84:  Kind of like marinate them, yeah [laughter]. 

A.85:  That's right.  That, that works wonders.  It, I know it takes a lot of
extra time but it's, it's by far worth it.

B.86:  And that's just a water sealing.  What happens if they aren't water sealed.

A.87:  Well over a period of time, any, any lumber will deteriorate. 

B.88:  # Yeah, will deteriorate, yeah.  #

A.89:  # Redwood would take quite # a few years, it depends on how many years you,
you plan to stay there.

B.90:  Yeah. 

A.91:  But, uh, redwood even if you don't treat it properly will begin to discolor
and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong, structurally strong
and, and, will be there for a lot longer. 

B.92:  Yeah they did tell us that we'd have to, you know, every couple of years,
just, you know, do brush up on the color, um,

A.93:  Actually if you do the, the water seal correctly,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # you # don't even have to do that. 

B.96:  # Oh, really.  #

A.97:  # I've seen # decks that are ten years old that, uh, that still have never
had t-, had the, uh, the water proof stain put back over it, or whatever. 

B.98:  # Huh.  #

A.99:  # And, # uh, or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there
that makes the redwood color come back, but it's expensive and, and, and most
cases if you do it properly it will not even be required. 

B.100:  Well that's a really interesting tip, and, uh, definitely something Tom
could handle, doing that. 

A.101:  Yeah, and, and the Thompson's is, is good because you can roll it on with a
roller, you can spray it on, you can,

B.102:  Yeah, he suggested just getting, uh, um, a, uh, um, a mop like you would
use,

A.103:  # Or, or a mop anything,#

B.104:  # a mop, jus-, #

A.105:  you can put that on with anything, whereas a lot of this other stuff you
have to, you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush. 

B.106:  # Paint it, yeah.  #

A.107:  # Uh, and or # spray it, but then you've got to worry about the over spray,
whereas this stuff is clear,

B.108:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.109:  # even # if you got it on the side of some of your bricks, or, or on your
concrete, it wouldn't hurt anything,

B.110:  # You couldn't tell, oh.  #

A.111:  # you would never be # able to know it, so. 

B.112:  Well that's definitely interesting because here we go with another home
project [laughter]. 

A.113:  Well, it's kind of fun though, things like that,

B.114:  # It is, I l-, #

A.115:  # especially something like that # where, where you're outside, you're not
worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up.  Outside you
can learn a lot by doing that.

B.116:  [Laughter]  Well like I said Tom does great with his garden.  I, I always,
uh, enjoyed working on the crew in the plays and building stuff so I'm, I'm
really in, infatuated with building things and, and making things. 

A.117:  Well and it's and it could be cheaper in the long run, and,

B.118:  But there's nothing like getting a profess-,
