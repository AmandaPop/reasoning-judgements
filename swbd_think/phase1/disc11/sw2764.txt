REMARKS:        There were several places that were difficult to 
transcribe because of the continual talkovers.  I could distinguish 
what Speaker B was saying because Speaker A could not be heard on 
his portion of the tape.  However, since Speaker B could be heard 
on Speaker A's portion of the tape, it was pretty difficult to 
decipher what Speaker A was saying.  And, since both speakers were 
male, I think that added to the fact that these parts were difficult 
to transcribe.

=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Credit cards.  They leave a bad taste in my mouth.

A.2:  Uh, yeah.  They've sort of left a bad taste in my mouth, too.  I've been
sort of [lipsmack] irresponsible a couple of years ago and I'm still paying
for #the,#

B.3:  #Yeah.#

A.4:  the, my own stupidity.

B.5:  Yeah.  Well, the thing I hate about them, I went through a divorce.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  And I will never own another joint credit card.

A.8:  Oh, but #you're,#

B.9:  #Because, uh,# even if in the divorce decree one is, agrees to pay it --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- if you're a cosigner on it, they'll still come after you.

A.12:  If the other person doesn't.

B.13:  If the other person doesn't.

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  And boy, that, that's, that's a rotten deal.

A.16:  Oh, I'd, I'd say so.  And isn't it, isn't it, now on those, those cards,
was it, um, mostly her that, that ran up #the,#

B.17:  #Yeah.#  

A.18:  bills?

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  About twenty thousand dollars worth.

A.22:  Twenty thousand?

B.23:  I can't imagine an-, anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit
card.

A.24:  Wholly smokes.

B.25:  But, uh, they call me.  I sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told
them I refuse to pay it.

A.26:  Yeah.  That's got to be like,

B.27:  #And,#   

A.28:  #close,#

B.29:  #uh,#

A.30:  #to# what?  A thousand bucks a month?

B.31:  Yeah.  And they said, Well, I'm sorry.  Even though the card is in her
name, you, you're a cosigner on it.  And I, I threatened legal, legal action
and everything.  I, I don't know.  I've sent them a letter and I said, I want
this removed --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- from, from my credit rating.

A.34:  Right.

B.35:  And, uh, haven't heard anything back, but I haven't run a credit check
either.

A.36:  Yeah.  You, might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar, uh,

B.37:  #Yeah.#

A.38:  #credit# checks just to find out what it says.

B.39:  Yeah.  But, uh, that's, uh, I'll never own another joint, 

A.40:  #Yeah.# 

B.41:  #credit# card.

A.42:  I need to find, I need my credit card mostly for, uh, just government
travel.  You know, #I'm,#

B.43:  #Yeah.#  

A.44:  uh, program manager for the Air Force and, uh, I, uh, I have to go on,
uh, travel quite a bit to contractors facilities.  And, when I do, I have to
have the hotel and all that kind of,

B.45:  #Yeah.#

A.46:  #stuff.#  But I've been trying to curtail my use of it to, to nothing e-,
with the exception of, uh, of th-, those type things.

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  And I also found out something else.  Uh, for your information, and I don't
know if you're married or not --

A.50:  No.  I'm not.

B.51:  -- but, uh, one of the credit cards, the, uh, the account was paid off.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  Oh, it was paid off for a couple of years.  Never even used it.  And then
all of a sudden I got a phone call from them saying, uh, uh, she's behind in
her payments.  And I said, Well, I don't care.  She's my ex-wife.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  And, uh, they said, well, your name is still on file as cosigner.

A.56:  Oh, gee.

B.57:  So even dormant credit cards you have, uh, you, you have to go and send
them a copy and tell them you're not responsible for any bills.

A.58:  Right.

B.59:  But, uh, it, it can turn into a mess.

A.60:  Sounds like it.  So, the, the credit card was inactive,

B.61:  #Yeah.#  

A.62:  #when# you,

B.63:  it was inactive.  And I never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or
anything.

A.64:  Right.

B.65:  Because they wasn't even mentioned in the divorce decree --

A.66:  Right.

B.67:  -- as to which party would pay w-, what.

A.68:  #Oh, my,#

B.69:  #Because,# 

A.70:  gosh. 

B.71:  the, the credit card was zero.  It was, you know, don't, and it was
dormant.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  But, uh, 

A.74:  Guess the, the bottom line is, uh, you got to be darn sure you're marrying
the right person when you --

B.75:  That's right.

A.76:  -- when you do that, too [laughter].  But, uh, I guess a divorce in any --

B.77:  Yeah.  

A.78:  -- circumstance, doesn't normally, they're #((cir-)),#

B.79:  #Either# that or make, or, each, each party have their own, own, uh, credit
card --

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  -- not a joint.

A.82:  That's for sure.  I know, I happen to know of a different guy who, um, a
girl I used to date, her brother, [noise] h-, his wife ran up thousands of
dollars in credit.  Well, I guess they're, they are both responsible for the
stupid things.  #But,#

B.83:  #Yeah.# 

A.84:  um, had a similar situation.  And then it was almost like he couldn't get a
divorce because, uh, uh, I guess she didn't even work or anything, and #then,#

B.85: #Yeah.#

A.86:  he would've been,

B.87:  ((Strapped with everything.))

A.88:  strapped with everything.  #I,#

B.89:  #Yeah.#

A.90:  I #remember ex-,# 

B.91:  #About# the only credit cards I have now are, are gas cards.

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  But they're in my name only. 

A.94:  Yeah.  

B.95:  And, uh,

A.96:  Well, uh, I'm, about, uh, thinking about doing a, getting a consolidation
loan just to lump everything together,

B.97:  #Yeah.#

A.98:  #so# that, and it's down to one payment and then just get rid of all
these old accounts #and,#

B.99:  #Low.# 

A.100:  just #work,#

B.101:  #Yeah.#

A.102:  on a cash only --

B.103:  Yeah.  

A.104:  -- system.  Because, uh, I'm just, I am v-, sort of irked at this, at these
credit card companies and, you know, they got you.

B.105:  Yeah.

A.106:  And,

B.107:  And, uh, you'll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your
credit line.

A.108:  Right.

B.109:  And, uh, and it also makes it bad because you can't deduct that interest
now.

A.110:  No.  

B.111:  You #know,# 

A.112:  #No.#

B.113:  at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct, deduct all
that #interest,#

A.114:  #Right.#  

B.115:  and finance #charges.#

A.116:  #Right.#

B.117:  You can't even do that anymore.

A.118:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember, uh, was it two years ago?  Or they did away with
it last year, right?

B.119:  Yeah.

A.120:  Yeah.

B.121:  Well, y-, uh, this last year was ten percent.

A.122:  Uh-huh.

B.123:  This next time it's zero.

A.124:  Yeah.  Well, remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger, uh, two
years ago than it was this year.

B.125:  Yeah.

A.126:  That's for sure.

B.127:  Yeah.  About on-, the only interest you can deduct now are, is a house
payment, mortgage,

A.128:  #Right.#  

B.129:  #interest# and, uh --

A.130:  Right. 

B.131:  -- and taxes.  But, uh, 

A.132:  #I,# 

B.133:  #credit# cards, you can't. 

A.134:  I can't even declare that here becau-, uh, in my situation because it's,
uh, uh, not until I sell it.

B.135:  Uh-huh.

A.136:  The, the way it works for me because I own it as, jointly with my father.

B.137:  Yeah.

A.138:  And, uh, the, they've changed those, or it's a, ends up getting classified
as a rental property and it's not,

B.139:  #Right.#

A.140:  #classified# as a regular family dwelling, so,

B.141:  #Right.#

A.142:  #there's# some reason we can't declare any mortgage interest. 

B.143:  #Well,# 

A.144:  #And,#

B.145:  I'm not, do you, do you or your father either one have it homesteaded?

A.146:  Um, do you mean do we, do I live in it or,

B.147:  No.  No.

A.148:  #What,# 

B.149:  #Homesteaded.#  

A.150:  what,

B.151:  Uh,

A.152:  does that mean?

B.153:  in Texas, uh, you get a, uh, a big tax break if, if you call what they
homestead it.  You have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary
residence and, and I live here.

A.154:  Oh, oh, and, well, that would be an interesting situation because I'm a
resident of Pennsylvania.

B.155:  Oh. 

A.156:  And, uh, because I'm in the Air Force.   

B.157:  Yeah.  

A.158:  And, um, I'm living here in New York.  So, I ca-, I can't even vote here.

B.159:  Huh.

A.160:  I'm a property owner but I can't vote [breathing].

B.161:  Yeah.  Huh.

A.162:  So,

B.163:  That's crazy.

A.164:  Yeah.  Well, that's only fair because the reason I'm a w-, resident of
Pennsylvania is because they don't charge military income tax.

B.165:  Oh.  So that's,

A.166:  #So,# 

B.167:  #good.#

A.168:  and so it's like Texas.  Texas doesn't either.

B.169:  Yeah.

A.170:  Uh,

B.171:  At least now.

A.172:  Yeah.  (( )).

B.173:  They're, they're talking about instituting a, uh, state income tax.

A.174:  Yeah.

B.175:  Everything else that, that would bring in money, the, uh, the, the people
want it, but the, uh, the Con-, or Texas State Congress and so forth, won't
pass a bill to do it.  Like a, uh, lottery.

A.176:  Uh-huh.

B.177:  They've been trying to get a lo-, ((l)), I think the last poll they had
here, seventy percent of the population voted, wanted a lottery.

A.178:  Right.

B.179:  And yet, the, uh, the House voted it down, the Texas House --

A.180:  Huh.

B.181:  -- voted it down.  They, all they want to do is increase property taxes and
--

A.182:  Sure.  

B.183:  -- put a income tax in.

A.184:  Well, [noise] [lipsmack] I don't know.  Just, [noise] getting back to the
#subject,#

B.185:  #((Huh)).#

A.186:  of credit cards.  I think the best, uh, thing maybe is that even though
the American Express charges the annual fee, is the American Express card, is
it makes,

B.187:  #Makes you,#

A.188:  #you pay# it every month.

B.189:  Right.  It makes you pay it.

A.190:  Yeah.

B.191:  I, I do have an American Express, but I got it through, uh, T I.

A.192:  #Yeah.  I've,# 

B.193:  #((It's just got a)),#

A.194:  #got a Diner's Club# through,

B.195:  #((it's a)),#

A.196:  #the government# as well. 

B.197:  yeah, 

A.198:  Yeah.  They,

B.199:  it's a corporate, uh,

A.200:  they force us to have, yeah, 

B.201:  Yeah.

A.202:  uh, government Diner's Club.  And I had an American Express of my own.  I
probably, if I was smart, I'd get rid of the American Express and get, stop
paying that annual fee on it.  But,

B.203:  Yeah.  And if you're late on this, on my American Express, they write T I.

A.204:  Ooh.

B.205:  Since it's a corporate, corporate American,

A.206:  #Yeah.#

B.207:  #Express.#  And,

A.208:  That, #that's not good.#

B.209:  #if you don't pay it,# you get a call from your supervisor saying, Why
hasn't this been paid?

A.210:  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.

B.211:  So you don't dare run up anything on it that you can't, you know that you,

A.212:  #Really.#

B.213:  #can't pay.#  That's, that's the problem with credit cards.  It, it's,
people don't think of it as cash.

A.214:  No.

B.215:  They think of it like, uh, monopoly money,

A.216:  #Right.#

B.217:  #that,# Hey, I can just charge this and pay it wherever I feel like it.

A.218:  Yeah.  It's like going, Oh, I'll have that money by the end of the month.
And then --

B.219:  Yeah.  

A.220:  -- end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and
--

B.221:  Right.

A.222:  -- a few other things and then you're like, Oh, jeez, ((hey)).

B.223:  Yeah.  #Well,#

A.224:  #Yeah,# I know that feeling [laughter].

B.225:  [Laughter] So, I guess the, the secret's not to have credit cards.

A.226:  Yeah, oh, w-, I'm getting to, just about to that point myself.  So,

@@B.227:  Well, I guess we've been, I'm surprised they hadn't beeped in and said
your ten minutes,

A.228:  Yeah.  

B.229:  is up.

A.230:  Really.  They've been,

B.231:  They've been, uh, even before ten minutes here lately, they've been saying
you should cut,

A.232:  Oh, 

B.233:  it off.

A.234:  really?  I haven't, I, I, actually haven't timed any of them.  I just
kind of go into a little conversation.  Ends on it's own or, uh,

B.235:  Yeah.

A.236:  or that, uh, that they do come in with that.  So,

B.237:  Yeah.

A.238:  Well, anyway, it was nice,

B.239:  Well, listen I've enjoyed talking with you.

A.240:  Yeah, it's nice talking to you Jerry and, uh,  {fade out} ...
