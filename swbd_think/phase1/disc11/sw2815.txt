============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  Um.  Where are you from, Connie?

A.3:  I'm from Dennison. 

B.4:  From Dennison.  Well, we live in Plano. 

@A.5:  Plano, great.  Wha-, are they doing anything down there for recycling?

B.6:  Yes, as a matter of fact they really are.  In, uh, February, I think it
was, the city started the first phase of a three part, first two phases of a
three part phase in for, uh, uh, city wide, you know, collection,

A.7:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.8:  # type # thing.  And the way they're doing this is they said no more trash
bags.  Is that how you set out your trash?

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  Yeah, that's the way we always had, too.  No more trash bags and they
assigned everybody, [breathing]  well, I think it's ninety-five gallons, big
bucket,

A.11:  # Well, that's neat.  #

B.12:  # and, uh, and # you can put every-, you know, they all look the same. 
They're great big green things.  They ru-, on rollers.  They're not hard at all
even my, you know, eight and ten year old can do it,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # take # them out to the street.  We used to have twice a week collection,
and now they have once a week collection for that.  And you don't have to use
the garbage bags anymore you just, uh,

A.15:  Do you separate your trash?

B.16:  Not yet,

A.17:  # Well, that's,#

B.18:  # but, #

A.19:  ((what)) they should do that. 

B.20:  that's the third part.  The second part is we now have a, uh, paper type
biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything,

A.21:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.22:  # and # they've always been encouraging us to not bag our,

A.23:  I thought about that last --

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  -- # last, # this last, couple weeks ago when we bagged up our leaves. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  It was sixteen or eighteen bags of leaves. 

B.28:  Oh, gosh. 

A.29:  And, yeah, and it takes forever for that plastic to,

B.30:  # Well, #

A.31:  # dissolve.  #

B.32:  we have a garden.  And so we have always, you know, we'll rake the leaves
and then we mow them. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  So they're little chibbles ((you know)),

A.35:  And you use it as mulch. 

B.36:  Uh-huh.  And use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard, so you
know, we've done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings
unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so
I've never worried about that, but, [breathing] um, they are doing that now
where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular
trash.

A.37:  They won't let you. 

B.38:  Huh-uh.  Now, the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May
but something, and I don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf, um,
trickle down --

A.39:  Right. 

B.40:  -- fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until end of June. 
But then they will give us another container that where we will put everything
recyclable, glass, plastic,

A.41:  Paper. 

B.42:  Uh, paper can go now.  We bundle that on top of our [noise] and set it out
beside our green --

A.43:  Okay. 

B.44:  -- thing.  (( )) a newspaper but, but the other kinds of paper will go. 

A.45:  Uh. 

B.46:  And ((like I say)) did I say glass, glass, plastic, other papers, tin,
aluminum, and there's something else. 

A.47:  Oh, I can't think of anything, milk cartons and soda bottles. 

B.48:  Yeah, like that too, that all comes under plastic and glass.  I can't think
what the other thing is.  Anyway, we won't even have to sort it.  At least
that's what they say. 

A.49:  Well, that's good,

B.50:  But the guy will come by and sort it there at the,

A.51:  Oh, that's going to be a lot of hard work though. 

B.52:  Well,

A.53:  # For them [laughter].  #

B.54:  # well, yes, but # it will be more profitable in the long run from what I
understand because,

A.55:  Well, I know everybody's throwing away millions of dollars worth of plastic
and stuff everyday just to be buried. 

B.56:  they have [breathing] already, they sell all this stuff and see we have
recycling centers here in the town that are setup by the city and that are, you
know, emptied but you know like it will say on there, uh, green glass only,

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # or # aluminum only and then somebody comes along and mixes it up, doesn't
do it right its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it
right because if you even put in just, say you had this huge container of
white glass and three or four brown or green glass bottles got in there and
got shattered there's no way you can pick all that out.

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  You see what I'm saying. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  So it, you know, its useless [laughter]. 

A.63:  Yes. 

B.64:  That well,

A.65:  (( )),

B.66:  it's not useless.  It just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to
the recycle places.  They say well, uh, you know, look, you already,

A.67:  # Yeah.  #

B.68:  # you've # got, and they have percentages, you know --

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- that, what they will accept. 

A.71:  The only they think I've heard of them doing down here in Dennison is
Wal-Mart let's you put there, you know, uh, milk cartons and --

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  -- two liter bottles.  Those clear plastic bottles. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  That's about it. 

B.76:  Well, all of our, um, grocery stores are going to, um, they have each of
one I shop at, I go to a Skaggs and Albertson's and a Kroger,

A.77:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.78:  # and # they will let you bring in your own little,

A.79:  # carry (( )), #

B.80:  # paper bags or # plastic bags.  They'll let you recycle them,

A.81:  # [Cough].  #

B.82:  # or # you can bring them in and actually use them again. 

A.83:  Okay well, they're doing that but every time I get paper bags at a grocery
store I bring home bugs. 

B.84:  Do you?

A.85:  Yeah.  And,

B.86:  # Um.  #

A.87:  # I # can't do it. 

B.88:  I don't know that I've ever had that problem. 

A.89:  Okay. 

B.90:  I just try to reuse mine a lot at home too and, but used to, you know, if I
had a torn sack when I got home,

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  I just trashed it, you know and anymore I don't do that I'll put it in with
the paper recycling, you know, the newspaper,

A.93:  # Yeah.  #

B.94:  # or # something. 

A.95:  Well, they ought to do that around down here. 

B.96:  Um, that always seems to help. 

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  The, uh, um, a lot of times if I know I'm just, even if I know, I've got a
big family so, you know, I rarely come home with, you know, just a sack or
two.  But, I have two canvas sacks that are big,

A.99:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.100:  # that # are especially for taking to the grocery store,

A.101:  # Right.  #

B.102:  # that # kind of thing,

A.103:  (( )).

B.104:  and I'll always take those and use them and, um,

A.105:  Real environmentally,

B.106:  # Yeah.  #

A.107:  # conscious, # aren't you? [Laughter]. 

B.108:  Yeah, I always have been.  I always have been and, uh, I kind of got out of
the habit of it, you know, for a few years when my children were --

A.109:  Small. 

B.110:  -- [Breathing]  well, when they,

A.111:  Did you use diapers?

B.112:  What?

A.113:  Disposable diapers?

B.114:  I didn't with my first three,

A.115:  # [Cough].  #

B.116:  # but # I did with my last two. 

A.117:  Goodness, you've got,

B.118:  # And, #

A.119:  # five # kids?

B.120:  yeah, I have five.  And, uh, well, [noise]  the actually now I think about
it I think it was number three that I used them a lot with and then number four
came along and I used them some with him most of the time I think I used them
with number four. 

A.121:  Well, I've got a three month old I used disposables on her for about a
month and a half,

B.122:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.123:  # just # to keep her from breaking out so bad. 

B.124:  And then she had reaction to the,

A.125:  Oh, she had reactions to cloth diapers,

B.126:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.127:  # it # was from staying wet more often. 

B.128:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.129:  and,

B.130:  Oh, they've just improved the --

A.131:  Yeah,

B.132:  -- # disposables so much.  #

A.133:  # they have.  Are they # biodegr-, or more biodegradable? I heard they're
the worst things. 

B.134:  Oh, yeah, they really fill up,

A.135:  # Because they stay forever.  #

B.136:  # but they work so # good [laughter]. 

A.137:  Yeah, they do. 

B.138:  I mean that's one thing that we moms just think, oh gosh,

A.139:  I don't mind using cloth diapers.  I really don't. 

B.140:  I, uh,

A.141:  It's not all that much more work. 

B.142:  Pardon?

A.143:  It's not all that much more work for disposable, I mean for, cloth. 

B.144:  Well I, always had, you know, several in diapers at the same time so that
may have been, you know, why they looked so nice to me but,

A.145:  Yeah, well, cloth, I mean disposables do look better.  They look they're
not quite as bulky,

B.146:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.147:  # she # looks like a little mushroom [laughter].  But I used disposables
with my first little boy. 

B.148:  Well, you know, that, we-, I think its just, [breathing]  you know, that
you, I think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off. 

A.149:  Uh-huh. 

B.150:  You just say to yourself, well, this is not worth it to me to do such and
so, but I want to make up for it because I want to be real conscientious in
this and that, you know what I'm saying, you,

A.151:  # Right, #

B.152:  # you # know,

A.153:  well, (( )),

B.154:  all of us can to something and you know what works for one family may not
work for another family, and,

A.155:  well, I know to with disposable diapers though if you use cloth diapers
your polluting with more soap and using more water and all that. 

B.156:  Yeah, that's true.  And you're using more electricity. 

A.157:  Right. 

B.158:  You're using it, uh, more where as when you buy the others they used it
more at the factory [laughter],

A.159:  # Yeah, you're right, #

B.160:  # so, you know, # you wonder,

A.161:  yeah. 

B.162:  you know, you're not using it but somebody used it to create that item,
you know,

A.163:  You're right [laughter].  I didn't even think about that. 

B.164:  So, but, you know, you know then you, you figured on down the line it did
give people jobs.  I use cloth diapers for a lot of stuff just besides, you
know, if my kids have got a cold, you know, I put them in bed with cloth
diapers [laughter] you know,

A.165:  # With a cloth diaper.  #

B.166:  # to use instead of # a hanky or,

A.167:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.168:  # or tissue # you, you know, they can could just flat go through,

A.169:  # Right.  #

B.170:  # three # dollars worth of tissue you in a morning, you know. 

A.171:  And they are the best dusters [laughter]. 

B.172:  I know it [laughter].  And they make wonderful dusters.  [Laughter]  No
question about it.  Well, I just, you know, I'm really glad to see us a world,

A.173:  # Yeah, it's really (( )),#

B.174:  # coming back to this, #

A.175:  it's building up for a few years.  I remember this going on when I was a
teenager. 

B.176:  Sure, sure. 

A.177:  For about the last ten years,

B.178:  How long have you been married?

A.179:  Five years. 

B.180:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

A.181:  And I've got two children. 

B.182:  Uh-huh.  So, you know when you say you're a teenager, you know, I, uh, I've
been married seventeen years,

A.183:  # Um, #

B.184:  # and # have always been, you know, Like I say always been conscious this
way but,

A.185:  I haven't, not until this year.  It's really starting to,

B.186:  So it's all brand new to you then,

A.187:  # r-, yeah, #

B.188:  # to think # of these things?

A.189:  well, they've really started, you know, I wish they would do that, um,
with, uh, the buckets here instead of the trash bags,

B.190:  # We-, #

A.191:  # here # the city sends us trash bags. 

B.192:  Uh-huh, yeah.  That's what we had the program before too.  Well, there's a
lot of information if you ever get to Dallas.  You come in very often?

A.193:  No, I don't. 

B.194:  Well, if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go
[laughter] is a place called Whole,
