===========================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, official time.  Well, what do you think of about the budget here,
you first.

B.2:  Oh, well, I think it needs some drastic, uh, drastic help [laughter]. 

A.3:  Oh, yeah. 

B.4:  Um, I, I think there's a lot of waste that, that could, uh, that would be
cut out if we could get, uh, politicians to be less, less of politicians.  Um,
and, um, I, I think it needs to be given a really high priority because I, I
think it has a horrible effect on the economy and, and what we can do as a
country and everything else. 

A.5:  I know that we're affected, uh, directly, uh, at T I because of, uh, the
defense budget cuts,

B.6:  # Sure.  #

A.7:  # but # I certainly think that's one of the, the things that they're doing
already which is,

B.8:  # Right.  #

A.9:  # uh, # wh-, which was av-, needed to be done for probably the last few
years, uh,

B.10:  # Yeah.  #

A.11:  # although # with the Russian situation and all the world situation
changing the way it is, uh, it certainly needed, I, the obvious one that
people all talk about that I still don't understand is, uh, I'm at work let me
turn my radio off here.

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  Uh, is, uh, all the foreign aid I, you know, it's,

B.14:  # Yeah.  #

A.15:  # over, # it's a fifty years roughly since World War Two,

B.16:  # Yeah.  #

A.17:  # I # don't understand why we're, I understand that we support Israel and
all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash rather than just
selling them military things at a discount or something.  I don't get the id-,
the idea,

B.18:  # Yeah.  #

A.19:  # of # giving people three billion dollars a year. 

B.20:  Right, I, I have a hard time with that too.  Now I can understand, uh, for
instance, the, uh, situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash
to jump start their economy. 

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  But I don't see where we, I mean, I think it's crazy to be just pouring
money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged, for instance. 

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  Um,

A.25:  Well, I think that we should give humanitarian aid and that's it. 

B.26:  Right. 

A.27:  You know, I think,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # we # can loan food or, or relief, relief aid or whatever,

B.30:  # Right.  #

A.31:  # you # want to call it but I, not cash money, I think you can send them
wheat, in other words, I think that helps our ((farmers)) but,

B.32:  # Right.  #

A.33:  # to # send them money I don't, I don't,

B.34:  # Yeah.  #

A.35:  # see # under any circumstances where you send anybody money. 

B.36:  I'm not sure I understand the, I, I guess there's a, a, a reason for that,
[laughter], and I, I just don't know enough about it to understand the sense
of it because it's, it's not an obvious, I, I mean, on the surface there's no
obvious reason why we should be doing that.

A.37:  Right. 

B.38:  I have to agree with you there. 

A.39:  I'm would imagine that neither party or, or the, which I guess they're
independent parties too, why they don't talk about it.  I mean, they don't
bring it up at all, why you would think they'd be real, having a real campaign
with one party or the other,

B.40:  # Right, yeah.  #

A.41:  # and they # never talk about it, they just keep doing it, you know.

B.42:  Yeah, that there's some kind of justification there and I don't know what
it is, and I don't know if I agree with it or not [laughter].

A.43:  I, I just like to hear them talk about it. 

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  You know, I like to hear some of the congressmen or senators,

B.46:  # Right.  #

A.47:  # at # least say, well, let's, let's bring this before, let's examine every
one of our foreign aids,

B.48:  # Right.  #

A.49:  # and # look like, like they did with the defense with the military bases. 
They, they investigated all those rightfully, wrongly, wrongfully whether which
ones should be closed I don't know,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # but, # at least they looked at it.  I think they should look at foreign
aid and say, hey, which ones do we not need to give, you know.

B.52:  Right.  Well, you know, the, the, the other thing is that you have all th-,
th-, this, all this partisan politics where you have a person who's
representing a particular state and he says, well, my state it would
advantageous if the, if the United States spent money to, uh, you know, to
investigate, uh, potato blithe or something, you know.

A.53:  Right, yeah. 

B.54:  And that's, and there is tons of that and,

A.55:  # I know that is amazing.  #

B.56:  # and that is just a # horrible waste of money I think, and it's, and it's
done because some constituent ra-, you know, I, th-, well, it's done because
they want to impress the, the people that are going to vote for him next
month.

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  And, uh, if, if there was a way to get around that and I think, I think
some of that could be avoided if we put, uh, uh, a finite term on, on some of
these peoples, um, uh,

A.59:  # Oh, I agree with you there.  #

B.60:  # uh, you know, stay in office, # um, I, I think they would, they wouldn't
have time to, I mean, they'd have to, I think their incentive would be to go
out, uh, or, and making their mark on history and they wouldn't even be
wasting their time on little ((piddly)) stuff that's just draining, draining
money, uh, instead they'd concentrate on doing something that was significant.
Um, I would hope so anyway.

A.61:  Yeah, I saw one about a month or so ago on TWENTY TWENTY, I think it was
where one of the congressmen, I think it was from Connecticut and I probably
will, will screw that up but,

B.62:  # Yeah.  #

A.63:  # he # wanted to start another drug headquarters in his state and no one
was asking for it but him.

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  And he got the money app-, he got it approved,

B.66:  # Yeah.  #

A.67:  # by # tagging it on some other bill, and it di-, you know, the, the
newsman asked him wh-, no one is asking for this, why do you, you know, and it
was just totally a boondoggle,

B.68:  # Yeah.  #

A.69:  # I # mean, it was just, uh,

B.70:  # Sure.  #

A.71:  # him # wanting to build something that nobody wanted,

B.72:  Right, well, that's, that's you know, that's the catch word these days,

A.73:  # Right.  #

B.74:  # is # drug, you know, drug fight drug. 

A.75:  Right. 

B.76:  (( )) I mean, he got himself,

A.77:  But the drug agency wasn't asking for it, he was asking for it, you know,
which didn't make any sense at all. 

B.78:  [Laughter]  I don't know th-, he, it, looked, ((can)) look good on his re-,
resume [laughter]. 

A.79:  Right.  It is amazing how the, the congressmen and senators just start, are
totally in another world once,

B.80:  # Yeah.  #

A.81:  # they # get elected. 

B.82:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, and well, you know, it's like, I've, I've really gotten
cynical I guess as I've gotten older but I've, I've been watching, you know,
the, the campaigns and stuff and it's, it just, it's just amazing how little
anybody really says. 

A.83:  Right.  Or, ((well, done)) I thought you were going to say what they do. 

B.84:  Oh, that too [laughter]. 

A.85:  I, I've been trying to go over in my own mind when they say we're going to
really, if you vote for me I'll control crime and drugs and then,

B.86:  # Right.  #

A.87:  # they # don't do anything. 

B.88:  Right. 

A.89:  Nothing, they don't, have they had any president or anybody every done
anything,

B.90:  # No.  #

A.91:  # against # crime and drugs, you know. 

B.92:  No, I mean, and because it's, you know, and it's because nothing is black
and white. 

A.93:  Right. 

B.94:  You know, you just can't go up and, go up there and say, well, we're going
to, we're going to stop crime now. 

A.95:  Right.  Yeah, exactly. 

B.96:  If it were that simple, somebody would have done it [laughter] a long time
ago. 

A.97:  Right, exactly. 

B.98:  And that's what ki-, you know, they, there's the people that says, well,
we'll, we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or, you know, it's like
the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes doesn't, isn't realistic
about what he see, you know,

A.99:  # Right.  #

B.100:  # what # he's doing.  The guy who says, well, we should raise taxes will
raise them but, but it will all, it, the money will not help anything.  That's
what kills me, um, you know, the, for instance, here, here in Texas they're
talking about, uh, an income tax.  Well, I could almost support an income tax
if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax.

A.101:  Right.  Yeah, you can't double up, yeah. 

B.102:  But nobody's talking about that,

A.103:  # Exactly.  #

B.104:  # [Laughter]  # they want both, you know. 

A.105:  Exactly, they never go away. 

B.106:  No, I know, and they never go away.  They just get higher and there's more
of them, you know. 

A.107:  The, the funniest thing I heard lately about politicians ((this)) joke was,
uh, uh, do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying?

B.108:  [Laughter]  How?

A.109:  His lips are moving. 

B.110:  [Laughter]  Yeah, my favorite,

A.111:  [Laughter]  That, that,

B.112:  # Yeah.  #

A.113:  # see # that covers is all, you know [laughter]. 

B.114:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, my favorite one about politicians is that a politician's
a person who's made it to the top because he didn't have what it takes to make
it at the bottom. 

A.115:  Right, yeah, but it, it is the budget thing is just and I don't know why
they don't talk about it logically it's always, always, uh, the, the only thing
I guess they're doing logically ((now is the)) defense which is certainly
hurting T I to a degree although we've done so well,

B.116:  # Yeah.  #

A.117:  # with # the ((go for)) we got a lot of good positive press with all the,

B.118:  # Right.  #

A.119:  # exotic # weapon systems and I think we'll get a lot of those, you know,
but, uh,

B.120:  # Yeah.  #

A.121:  # uh, # you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some
missiles or I mean some, uh, programs and all. 

B.122:  Right. 

A.123:  Uh, and they're doing that I think that's, that's,

B.124:  # Well, #

A.125:  # really # good even though it, it hurts a lot bit, you know. 

B.126:  Yeah, the, the problem is that the budget is so complicated, and what
they're doing are the things that are easy.  They're making the easy choices. 

A.127:  Well, then that's probably true. 

B.128:  And, and, uh, um, and it's, and I think part of it is that the budget, you
know, the, the economy and the budget is too complicated for a lot of the
politicians.  I mean, they can't comprehend, um, you know, what it takes, what
it needs,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # they # just don't have the expertise.  The other thing is they can't,
it's too, uh, it's not in their political career interest to make some of the
hard decisions that are going to need to be made.

A.131:  Right. 

B.132:  Uh, and so what you do is you do the obvious things, you know. 

A.133:  Right. 

B.134:  And, and they, they don't really help all that much.  I mean sure they help
some, and I'm sur-,

A.135:  I do-, go ahead, I was going to say, I know you mentioned it but I don't
know why we can't change the laws where the-, the congress and the senators
just have eight years or terms,

B.136:  # Right.  #

A.137:  # because # the president has it and I think that, uh, is, you know, you
don't want someone in there forever. 

B.138:  Right. 

A.139:  And the congressmen go in there forever and th-, that's their whole life
then,

B.140:  # Right.  Right.  #

A.141:  # and their # family's life and every one of their relatives gets on it has
got a job, you know, it's ridiculous. 

B.142:  Yeah, well, uh, you know, I think, uh, it's got to come from the, you know,
it's, it's got to be, you know, their, certainly the politicians aren't going
to introduce that as a bill.

A.143:  Right, there you go.  There you go. 

B.144:  So, so, so, you know, if something like that's going to happen, it's
usually because somebody's, you know, somebody has gotten angry enough and has
got the time an the energy to, to, you know, hav-, to, to develop something
from the, from the, you know, ground ((swell)) level, you know, where you get
a petition up and you, you know, get signatures and you call for a referendum
and it's not easy, it's not easy.

A.145:  No, that's true.  Maybe that long-term though, I think that is a, a factor
that is to keep the, our government, uh, rotating, you know, keep them moving,
uh,

B.146:  # Yeah.  #

A.147:  # and # not get the career politicians (( )).

B.148:  Right. 

A.149:  Yeah, there's, uh, historians I thought that keep saying will that, that
never was meant that the politicians would make a career, it was just something
that you would serve like in the military,

B.150:  # Right.  #

A.151:  # and # then you'd be done, you know. 

B.152:  That's right.  Well, you know, it and, and what was supposed to be, uh, so
healthy about our former government is that these were regular people,

A.153:  # Right, right.  #

B.154:  # who were, # who, you know, these were the doctors and the lawyers and the
accountants and the janitors and the, uh, who were in there,

A.155:  # Right.  #

B.156:  # for # their brief period of time to do their,

A.157:  # Right.  #

B.158:  # to, # to, to serve proudly and,

A.159:  Right.
