============================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the, uh,
jury system, do you?

B.2:  Uh, not at all.  In fact, I'm graduating from college in about a week and
this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a
lot on trials. 

A.3:  Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do [breathing]. 

B.4:  [Laughter]  Uh, I think, I think, uh, s-, the system right now, you know,
should, you know, is fine.  I think it should be by a jury.  I don't think the
judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee [laughter]. 

A.5:  Uh-huh, Uh-huh. 

B.6:  Uh, I don't, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either.  Uh,

A.7:  Well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt? I thought that was the point of, uh, a unanimous
jury was the idea that if everyone agrees --

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  -- then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt. 

B.10:  Right. 

A.11:  But, if there are some people who don't agree --

B.12:  Exactly. 

A.13:  -- uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a
reasonable doubt for some people. 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  Uh, [lipsmack] I don't know.  I, uh, you, you rarely hear, you
hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh,
prison, uh, falsely accused but, uh, more than likely the people that are on
the, the jury know what they're doing.  Uh, I mean you,

A.15:  Really? Have you served on a jury?

B.16:  Never. 

A.17:  I never have either, but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just
the opposite [breathing].  They say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent.  And,
uh, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then
as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their
prejudices hang out and to, to air, and all that.

B.18:  Huh.  Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the
prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would
come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're
chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or
something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the
jury. 

A.19:  Right, (( )), they don't want anyone with exper-, [throat_clearings]  --

B.20:  Exactly. 

A.21:  -- anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system. 

B.22:  Uh-huh, exactly.  Uh,

A.23:  And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they
don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury
just about, and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that, if I were
ar-, let's say I were arrested falsely or not --

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  -- and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried
by a jury of my peers.  I'd be, I mean I'd be tried by a jury of [breathing],
you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable
about certain sorts of things, and, uh,

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  I don't know, I, I get a little bit nervous about it, and, uh,

B.28:  I've, I've never [throat_clearing],  I've never even been called to jury
duty. 

A.29:  Yeah, I, I was called once, but I was out of the country, and apparently I,
apparently they thought I served so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it
[laughter]. 

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  I came back and they said the record showed I served, but I was out of the
country at the time, so I'm pretty sure I didn't.  Uh,

B.32:  [Laughter] Yeah.  I, uh, {pause} I don't know, I think the, I guess there's
a lot of problems with the legal system [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, well, I [throat_clearing], I, I don't know, I definitely feel like we
need to keep it at least unanimous because, [breathing] uh, you know, there's
the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you
know,

B.34:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.35:  # jury # which [breathing]  can have all kinds of prejudices and things
that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have.  Though, of course
they can, too. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or
something you could pretty much brow-, you know, [breathing] browbeat the
jury,

B.38:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.39:  # a # majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury, that's hard to say.
Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he
looks and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I
hear, I, I have, I have some friends who do expert wis-, witness testimony and
they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional
pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, [breathing]  oh, I don't know
show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was
and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with
the victim, and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know,
har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well,
you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.  Let's, let's make them
pay as much as possible. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  Things like that.  So, not, I, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't
guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury, but
I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the
settlements would be,

B.44:  # Ri-, #

A.45:  # things # like that. 

B.46:  I, uh, I do-, I, I don't think the judge should just make the decision
alone. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know --

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  -- that are going to decide, you know, you're the, the person's fate. 

A.51:  Well, how about having a j-, jury and a judge work together on it somehow?
I wonder if that's possible?  [breathing] I guess the judge's time is worth
too much, though.

B.52:  Exac-, (( )) judge [laughter]. 

A.53:  [Laughter]  They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little
money compared to that judge [laughter]. 

B.54:  Right, exactly [laughter]. 

A.55:  He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together. 

B.56:  Probably, yeah [laughter].  Yeah.  But, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though,
that, uh, that the people, though, that you, you, somebody's life is in twelve
people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less. 

A.57:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.58:  And, uh, or they fool the, the defense in thinking that they're, you know,
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they
want. 

A.59:  Oh, of course.  It's, it's political maneuvering.  The, the one side is
looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang
everyone, and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic.
They're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or
sensible or rational juror.  Neither side wants that.  They want to find a
juror that's going to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.

B.60:  Exactly. 

A.61:  Uh, I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually.  I
mean, I know, it, it, it's tricky because I know, you know, an awful lot of
intelligent people who just, well I'm too busy to serve on a jury,

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # so # I'll tell them that and they won't, or just, you know, just answer
one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,

B.64:  # Oh, yeah.  Well, #

A.65:  # they just say # do you believe in such and such.  Uh,

B.66:  I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you
know.  If it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was
innocent and, then they'd want to be on that jury. 

A.67:  Right.  Course, they'd be, they would be barred, but [laughter], 

B.68:  [Laughter]  But, uh, if everyone would take it, I think if everyone took it
seriously --

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- and, uh, I mean, something you have to do [laughter]. 

A.71:  Yeah, well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a
jury. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  I hope we're called up before too long. 

B.74:  I would love to be called, I'm ready to go [laughter].  They just haven't
called me up yet [laughter]. 

A.75:  They will, they will eventually. 

B.76:  [Laughter]. 

A.77:  [Laughter]  Okay, well it was nice talking with you. 

B.78:  It was nice talking to you. 

A.79:  Bye-bye. 

B.80:  Bye-bye.
