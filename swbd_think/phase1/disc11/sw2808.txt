started cutting out in the third conversation. 

============================================================================

@A.1:  Uh, the clothing I guess that, uh, I wanted to talk about is the
different, uh, uh, types of wardrobe that one might need to have in the kind
of job or, well, I think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a
college student.

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  A full-tim-, do you consider that full-time?

B.4:  I consider a full-time college student, I don't consider it really a job
but I guess in a way it would be [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  I never really thought about it. 

A.7:  Well, do you, um, do you have a kind of wardrobe, I suppose you do, that is
suitable for almost all the year or do you change quite a bit during the
seasons?

B.8:  Um, [noise]  oh, my.  Everyone pretty much, well, like in the winter
everyone, more susceptible to the sweatshirts and, you know, the big heavy
sweaters. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  And basically everyone wears jeans but in the summer everyone's basically
in shorts.

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  And sometimes we still do wear sweatshirts with our shorts, you know. 

A.13:  Sure. 

B.14:  So, um, I would just say the only difference is, you know, like long sleeve
and short sleeve,

A.15:  # Yes.  #

B.16:  # between # summer and winter. 

A.17:  Yes.  Um, what year are you in college?

B.18:  I'm a senior. 

A.19:  Okay.  Well, uh, what I might, uh, suggest since I have had a working
career, at the present time I'm not working, but it was so helpful to me, you
do plan probably to work when you receive your degree.

B.20:  Yes. 

A.21:  Yes [laughter]. 

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  And what are you receiving it in?

B.24:  Finance. 

A.25:  Finance.  Well, my,

B.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.27:  # husband # is a financial person. 

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  Uh, but when I worked, I tended to, uh, be confused a lot at first and tr-,
I, I would t-, get things out of the closet and oh, that wouldn't do and this
wouldn't do, I just seemed to have more clothes than I could wear. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  Or that I wanted to wear.  And I went and had that, uh, Color Me Beautiful
thing done. 

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  And, uh, in fact, I did it rea-, that part just for fun because I have
gotten her book before, your re-, aware of that book?

B.34:  No. 

A.35:  Well, it, uh, tells you what colors really are best on you. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  And, uh, what season you are, winter, spring, you, you heard people talk
about that?

B.38:  Yeah, um, I've had one of those things done for like makeup and stuff. 

A.39:  Okay.  Well, I did it, uh, primarily for clothing because, um, I have dark
hair and kind of ((shallow)) ((ready)) complexion,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # and, # um, those ba-, good-looking cashmere, beige suits that I wanted so
badly were horrible on me, and so when I got this color test done for clothing,
I found out that that's probably the worst color I can wear. 

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  So, I started buying only those colors that were good for a winter and I'm
a winter.

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  And, um, so after about, uh, and, and I was working and I added a few
things to my wardrobe, uh, in the colors that I out-, that I already, to the
colors that I already had that I could wear,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # plus # I bought some.  And do you know, it made traveling and working so
much more simple because and I, I did away with all those colors that, like the
beige blouses I couldn't wear.  I can wear white but I couldn't wear beige. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  So, I got rid of all those.  I mean I hated to get rid of those. 

B.50:  [Laughter]. 

A.51:  Suits that, pantsuits that were a hundred and fif-,

B.52:  Knowing how much money [laughter]  you spent on ((that)).

A.53:  Really, but I didn't look, people would say, have you been feeling well
lately, when I would wear those beige,

B.54:  # [Noise]  Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # suits.  So, # it made it so much more simple for me to have everything
pretty much in one color family.  For instance, I wear burgundy well. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  And, uh, purple and hot pinks.  Well, very often those can be comp-,
combined and navy blues and whites.  So, when I travel for a week, I really
would only have to take one pair of shoes, a suit, several blouses, an extra
shirt or two. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  And it was so much simpler if you will think about that. 

B.60:  Yeah, well, see, um, I'm, I'm a cold person they call, they, and the-, I
think that's relates to the same thing as the winter. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  And the summer is the warmer colors. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  And I, I pretty much wear the same colors you just described.  I wear a lot
of navy blues, um, I wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink,

A.65:  # Yes, exactly.  #

B.66:  # color, you # know, and, and in those shades. 

A.67:  [Throat_clearing]  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  Um, I wear a lot of greens though too. 

A.69:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.70:  You know, just the, the darker greens.  I don't like wearing the light
greens. 

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  And, uh, black and maroon and, you know,

A.73:  # Yeah.  #

B.74:  # I # wear the darker colors. 

A.75:  Yes. 

B.76:  Yeah. 

A.77:  Well, now when you start, have you started interviewing for jobs yet?

B.78:  No, I haven't. 

A.79:  Um, well, when you start interviewing for jobs, and if you do put in some,
quite a bit of money in your clothing, keep that in mind because those, those
pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years. 

B.80:  Oh, yeah, I already started buying suits and I've already, you know, I've
bought the suits that I always wear colors in so [laughter]. 

A.81:  Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  Well, that's, that's very smart.  Well, I, i-, have we exhausted our
subject? [laughter]. 

B.84:  [Laughter]  ((Oh)).

A.85:  I've talked so much why don't you, uh, uh, tell me, uh, what kind of, if
you had an interview tomorrow,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # what # would you probably wear?

B.88:  What would I wear?

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  I have, um, this suede suit, it's a double breasted coat with a shirt, and
I have a number of different blouses I could wear with it.  One blouse that
looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  Sounds pretty.  Well, I read an article in the, uh, Charlotte
paper yesterday from,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # one # of the fashion experts here,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # who # said that stockings, um, are also not given enough emphasis.  Uh,
it choo-, we don't choose them, uh,

B.96:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.97:  # quite # so well and it says that suntan really doesn't go with everything
[laughter]. 

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  And try to get one of the experts, uh, where you buy nice stockings to tell
you the color to wear with outfits. 

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  Uh, uh, in fact, she doesn't give white a real high grade. 

B.102:  No, I don't even wear white stockings with this just because it's just too
much white.

A.103:  It's too white, isn't it?

B.104:  With the white shoes and everything. 

A.105:  Yes. 

B.106:  Uh-huh, I wear, I wear the tan. 

A.107:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.108:  You know, or the nude or whatever you want to call it. 

A.109:  Yeah.  Or,

B.110:  # Yeah.  #

A.111:  # I # think, uh, I don't know what.  Is that a white, white suit or is it a
kind of creamy white?

B.112:  It's really different, it's not quite, it's, it's not what you would call
really an off-white and it's, I don't think it's a real white, white either,
you know [laughter].

A.113:  Well, it probably looks good on you then but since it's not very off-white.

B.114:  Uh-huh. 

A.115:  Well, anyway I thought that i-, it was the first time I had ever read an
article on stockings or, or panty hose or whatever you call them these days. 

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  And, but it did say that, uh, uh, they really pretty much needed to be, uh,
they need to look good with, uh, the shirt and the shoes.  And you ((coun-,))
you think of it as a total outfit. 

B.118:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

A.119:  But it said also they find that navy shirt and navy stockings and navy
shoes are very boring [laughter].

B.120:  Yeah, that would just be too much. 

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  [Laughter]  Oh, gosh. 

@@A.123:  [Laughter]  Well, it's been fun talking to you. 

B.124:  It was nice talking to you too. 

A.125:  And I hope, uh, it would be nice, I'm getting to talk to some of the same
people. 

B.126:  Oh, really?

A.127:  Yes.  And I,

B.128:  # Oh.  #

A.129:  # I # understand we need some more guys to talk to so you might, uh, leave
a message if you know any guys that want to do this.

B.130:  [Laughter]  Okay. 

A.131:  Okay.  You have,

B.132:  # Okay, thank you.  #

A.133:  # you have a # nice day. 

B.134:  You too. 

A.135:  Bye-bye. 

B.136:  Bye-bye.
