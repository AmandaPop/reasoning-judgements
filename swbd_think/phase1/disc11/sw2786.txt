A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  My daughter this week, uh, as part of a, uh, in her high school her
humanities course she's been taking a little subcourse that was offered where
they actually write off, you know, and request their, um, preferred colleges,
they had to write to a minimum of three preferably five. 

A.3:  That's probably a good idea. 

B.4:  And I think she did four.  And they actually had typed their own letters
requesting, you know, catalogs and whatnot and figure up mileage expenses and,

A.5:  # All kinds of little, #

B.6:  # trips home and they # had to figure one airline, uh, trip home and at
least one car trip home per year and, gosh, you know,

A.7:  I was going to say it's good that,

B.8:  # [Breathing].  #

A.9:  # that # if you visit at least four or five colleges before they even, you
know, go to attend, go,

B.10:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.11:  # down # there and visit for the weekend they do have those programs where
you can go down there.

B.12:  Have your kids gone to state schools?

A.13:  Uh, well, no, uh, actually, uh, my, my daughter's quite young yet but, uh,
I went to a state school.

B.14:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.15:  Uh, and I find that overall they're probably much cheaper,

B.16:  # Yeah.  #

A.17:  # and # the quality of education's probably, I would say not much different
than what you'd get at, you know, most of your, like A and M, Texas and, uh,
you know, Vanderbilt,

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # some # of those. 

B.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.21:  I think there are some differences but probably in size, in, in, in
capacity of classes and that sort of thing,

B.22:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.23:  # but all # in all I think the, the education level's probably just as
good, if you, if you participate.  Uh,

B.24:  My folks kind of had a unwritten rule, there were nine of us and we all
just worked really hard to get through college [laughter].  ((Most of us)),
we, we did but if we went to state schools, we got virtually no help.  If we
went out of state, we got, a lot more help from them, um, and kind of the
premise being that, uh, if you, you know, part of college is being far enough
away that you can't come home and do your laundry and,

A.25:  # Yeah.  #

B.26:  # come # home for old football games, and that kind of thing, so, I think
that that's, was some of the focus, although, I think they relaxed that I was
one of the older ones [laughter]  ((and they got more experience)). You know
and,

A.27:  [Laughter]  I'll tell you what, it, it's expensive, of course, I worked my
way,

B.28:  # Some, #

A.29:  # through # and, uh, I think that's a good idea in some cases except
nowadays it's just so expensive. 

B.30:  It's just so expensive and, you know, this little exercise we did this week
with our daughter we just crammed (( )), oh, you know, chances of her being
able to go to her father's and my alma mater's pretty slim I'm afraid, you
know, {very faint} but, uh,

A.31:  Well, yeah, it, it, it, it can be cost prohibitive real quick, you know, I,
I want to be able to at least I want to pay my, pay the tuition, you know,
give her transportation if it's necessary,

B.32:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.33:  # and # of course, I'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible.

B.34:  I just really believe in dorms for at least the first year, depending on
the child but, you know, I,

A.35:  But I don't want her to have to work I, I would, I don't mind if she has a
little part-time job to earn just a little extra spending money and that sort
of thing,

B.36:  # And of course, summer work and, #

A.37:  # and summer work and things like # that unless she just tends to go all
the way through but, uh, I don't want to, to have her feel financially, you
know, burdened, uh, and not, you know, concentrate on studying and that sort
of thing.

B.38:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.39:  But, uh, I know like, I guess probably one of the things that, that I've,
I've learned is that to try to pick a college where they have at least three
different degree plans that you would like,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # as # an alternative. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  If you start one you don't particularly like that one,

B.44:  # Then that's okay.  #

A.45:  # you have something # to go through because if you have to change
colleges, then you lose hours and then you've got to go through all that, uh,

B.46:  # Oh, #

A.47:  # preliminary, # uh, application. 

B.48:  and some ((of the things)) just don't switch,

A.49:  # Yeah.  #

B.50:  # they # just don't switch. 

A.51:  Yeah, a lot of times you'll, you'll, people will just go to a college, when
they get there they find out, gosh, I don't like this at all and there's
nothing there that they want,

B.52:  # Yeah.  #

A.53:  # other # than that so they are faced with having to do all that and that
can, that can throw as much as a year out of your degree plan.

B.54:  That's really a very viable suggestion, I had now never really thought of
it like that, although, as you outline it, it certainly makes perfect sense.
I just,

A.55:  But, uh, that was one of the things that, that I, that I encountered.  Uh,
so, I, I know [throat_clearing]. 

B.56:  You know [laughter], 

A.57:  # Yeah.  #

B.58:  # from # experience.  Well it's,

A.59:  So, and then also the other thing is, is going to a jun-, to a junior
college,

B.60:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # for at # least two years to get all your preliminary courses, your math,
your English, history, government, all the things that, that are
time-consuming, uh, and some of the courses that you can even take on
television,

B.62:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # and get # those out-of-the-way before you even start a four year college
because a lot of those courses, especially English and history. 

B.64:  So much less expensive and,

A.65:  Well, less expensive but not only that but a lot of those courses they,
they're extremely difficult.  If you're starting out in a, in a four year
degree plan, in a four year college, they're extremely difficult and they go a
little faster in, in junior college they go a little slower and you do learn,
you know,

B.66:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # a little # bit more self-paced.  And, uh,

B.68:  Well, the, uh, Collin County Community College that we have out here is
just growing by leaps and bounds, we've been so impressed with it and, uh, you
know, my husband an I both have taken advantage of some of the continuing
education, uh, programs through it, and as a family we've, you know, been
involved in some of the arts things and, you know, that is provided.  I've
been really [laughter], impressed but there was just that little piece of me,
you know, going back to my own experience of, oh, gosh, you know, if my kids
go there I'll never get rid of them.

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  [Laughter]  I mean they're never going to be on their own.  How long am I
going to have, you know, kids in my house staying up until, you know, two,

A.71:  # Well, I think it's, #

B.72:  # and three in the # morning. 

A.73:  I think it's important that they do get away.  You know, then not
necessarily so far that you can't get to them,

B.74:  # That's right {very faint}, that's right.  #

A.75:  # but at least, you know, a # hundred miles or, or even two hundred miles
where you can at least go down there on a, on a, like a one, one month basis so
they can come home. 

B.76:  Yeah, yeah, that's,

A.77:  You know, and it's not real expensive, uh, uh, you know, a lot of times
they can share rides coming back and forth if they, you know, have people in
the local area that live near them but, uh,

B.78:  Well, and, you know, I think if they know that they can't get home all the
time,

A.79:  # Yeah.  #

B.80:  # then # they, they're more brave, they know they're going to have to
((forge)) some new relationships and, you know, be able to make new friends and
they don't just hold on to the old hobbies and the old activities they're a
little more adventurous, you know, and,

A.81:  Yeah, none of us did that, we all stayed right,

B.82:  # ((Thoughtful)). #

A.83:  # close # to home and,

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.85:  # of # course, I was married the whole time I was in school but, uh,

B.86:  # So that, #

A.87:  # but it # was, uh, it was still one of those situations where Mom and Dad
were still around if you needed them and, uh,

B.88:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.89:  # you know, # not that I could really depend on them that much but they
were still there.

B.90:  Yeah, it's nice to know, well, we always,

A.91:  # And you're not far enough, #

B.92:  # were [breathing],  we had a # lot of family in the area, extended family,

A.93:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.94:  # my # husband and I both, uh, uh, went to a church school and we didn't
have our families there but we had extended families {very faint} and, uh, uh,

A.95:  You know, I guess, probably one of the other things I noticed is that some
of the colleges are, are very much, uh, encouraging you know, the kids to
participate in all the fraternities, sororities, and all the extracurricular
activities much so because they, they are money making things,

B.96:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.97:  # and # they do support, they do help support the, the school. 

B.98:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.99:  But I prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus. 

B.100:  ((Now)), me too [laughter]. 

A.101:  Uh, I'd rather go to the schools that focus on the, on the academic part of
it, and that's a, that's a, that's a key nowadays because a lot of the colleges
promote to partying and the, and the sororities and things like that and, and
once you get hooked, you know, you can really get, uh, locked up in that stuff
and your grades suffer. 

B.102:  And your grades really suffer. 

A.103:  They really do.  Uh, I got wrapped up in that, of course, I was in, you
know, athletics and stuff like that,

B.104:  # Huh, uh-huh.  #

A.105:  # but it # got so time-consuming that it got to be to where I had to decide
either I was going to just quit all that mess and go study or, or, or, you
know, basically just skim through.

B.106:  And at that point, did you almost say, gee, I going to have to get out of
this school [laughter] to do this. 

A.107:  Well, I quit, I quit fo-, I quit football because I just, uh, figured that,
it's not worth it.  What am I going to do with this after I get out.  I'm not
going to go pro football.  Uh, I'm not good enough.  I faced the, you know,
faced that up front and say, you know, I'd rather get my grades.  And that's
what I did.  I quit and went aft-, after the grades. 

B.108:  Have you been sorry?

A.109:  No.  Not at all.  So [laughter]  it,

B.110:  We need to have you in our high school [laughter]. 

A.111:  Uh, but it,

B.112:  [Laughter] ((in)) our Texas school system.  ((So we're in)),

A.113:  But you know, you, a lot of the kids get hurt and then they, they, when
they can't play pro ball anyway and then they don't have the education they
should have, what are they going to do.

B.114:  Yeah. 

A.115:  And that's,

B.116:  # My, uh, #

A.117:  # that's a, # that's a big thing right now that you-, that your seeing is
((all the)) athletics be, a lot of them are playing before they even can finish
college,

B.118:  # Yeah.  #

A.119:  # they're # playing pro ball.  I think it ought to be, be a prerequisite
that they ought to have a degree with a certain amount of grade point average
before they're even eligible for pro ball. 

B.120:  Yeah, I agree because,

A.121:  # But they don't, they won't do that.  #

B.122:  # I was just reading a thing in # the, this is off the subject somewhat but
in the READERS DIGEST about, uh, ath-, pro athletes that, uh, had gotten on to
drugs, you know, and,

A.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.124:  # invariably # it was ones that didn't have the confidence to, you know,
some way or another to finish or realize that there was any other money
anywhere except, you know, in dealing drugs,

A.125:  # Well, I know it is getting down to,#

B.126:  # but incredible, incredible athletic abilities and, #

A.127:  It's getting down to grade school now, I think they really need to get away
from, you know, from stressing the athletics and extracurricular activities and
get, even at the young age get, get the politics and the money out of the
athletics and,

B.128:  # Well, #

A.129:  # start # getting back in the school. 

B.130:  [Throat_clearing] A thing that we had here just recently, and I, I really,
I forgot to cut the article out, I was mad at myself that I didn't because I
wanted to follow-up on it, but there was a dad here in the Plano school system
who had, who has the premise that our grades in the metroplex in, in, you
know, some of these, you know, Irving and, and, uh, Richardson, Lake Highlands
and Plano I think were his target ones, are inflated, artificially inflated
grades.

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  Uh, he felt like those kids when they actually got in to college situations
were not, um, able to pull the same,
