============================================================================

A.1:  All right, well, tell me all about your reunion planning. 

B.2:  Well, we, uh, uh, this will be, uh, uh, the reunion for not my grandfather,
but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers, so it's a
couple of generations, uh, and these were pioneers who came across the plains. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And, uh, the families were, are quite large, and so we've ha-, we spent a
lot of time trying to gather up, uh, names and addresses of all the tons of
people that are involved. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  And so it takes a lot of time and planning.  Uh,

A.7:  Are you going to # do it over a weekend?#

B.8:  # good activity.  The what? #

A.9:  Are you going to do it over a weekend or,

B.10:  Well, interesting enough we're going to, we're going to do it over an eight
day period. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  Uh, they will not, everyone won't be there for the whole time --

A.13:  Right. 

B.14:  -- but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet
on the, on the living family level, like, I will come there kind of early and
my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that [breathing] we
can get acquainted and then, uh, it goes back the, the generation before will
join us and they may meet kind of individually in this camping area.

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  And then, uh, toward the end of the week there will be two specific days
when we honor these two, uh, groups, my, the grandfathers and the great
grandfathers. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  Uh, so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again, but, uh,
it's, it's, it's, uh, it requires a lot of, uh, logistics for food for the
people who will have to meet --

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  -- and, a lot of, uh, arranging for activities, uh,

A.21:  What are some of the activities?

B.22:  Well, uh, course you want to do some kinds of things that, which will help
them to get to know the ancestor that you're honoring. 

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  But, besides that, if you have a lot of children, and, and different ages
you need to try to find things that, uh, that they will just ha-, like to do
together so that the next time somebody says reunion, they won't run like
[laughter]  --

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  -- the four winds. 

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  So it has to be pretty fun, too, I think.  Uh, we're, we're going, uh,
going to Utah to, uh, uh, place near Park City.

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  And, uh, and it's a, a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and,
and then there will be, uh, oh, just, uh, general kinds of things like, uh,
swimming and whatever during the, uh, in the area roundabout, which they will
do during the days when they want to [breathing], when they're not, uh, uh,
rehearsing or whatever for a part of the, the play and then we'll kind of get
together and, and, uh, work out some small, oh, vignettes or, or, uh, acts, or
things like that.  Musical numbers.  And the fact that we're together early
during the week will help us to get together to prepare those things for the,
for the programs at the end of the week.

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  So, it, it, we're real excited about it.  Now, always before we have only
had my grandfather's family and, uh, we only did it for one day. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  And, uh, the last time we d-, we were doing it every two years and we
decided last time we would wait a third year because it came across so often
that it was kind of hard to get there. 

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  And, uh, some people come from Back East and, course I come from Texas, so
there's some of us come from quite a ways. 

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  Uh, and so we, we had a little longer and decided to try to hold it, uh, in
a situation that was a little longer like a camping situation, something that
wasn't too expensive, but [breathing], uh, could be more of a vacation
situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their
ancestors and relatives. 

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  Uh, so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families.  Now,
I've never gotten all my family to come before, but this year I have, uh,
several married daughters and, and sons whose families are coming en masse.
So, it, it, it looks to be a lot more interesting activity.

A.41:  This is, what, how did you pick, uh, the place in Utah? Is it central
location or,

B.42:  Well, uh, the ancestors came from there. 

A.43:  Okay. 

B.44:  And, uh, and we, we were holding them there because there were some living
ancestors up until, uh, fairly recently.  At this point, in that generation
that we're honoring, there's only, well my mother is ninety-three and she
won't go this year because it's just too hard on her.  But, uh, and there's
one other wife.  But all of, all of the children are now gone.  They, they've
passed away in the meantime.

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  And so, uh, at that point we were going for that reason, we were going
there.  But, it just, there just more of them there still than there are other
places.  The rest of us are kind of strung around some but, we-, you know, if
you, if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority, it still is
there. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  Also, we had a, we had a, the member who was in charge of it in general
this time had some access to this park --

A.49:  Uh. 

B.50:  -- which was a big factor.  Whether we'll be able to do it there again, but
there are other kind of arrangements like in, in, uh, in some of the areas in
Colorado, you know, where they ski in the winter time.  You can make some
pretty good arrangements for, for, uh, for group, uh, activities and things
like that.

A.51:  How,

B.52:  So we might do something like that.  Also sometimes universities will, will
rent out, uh, areas --

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  -- for doing things like that. 

A.55:  Okay. 

B.56:  But, uh,

A.57:  How long in advance did you set the date?

B.58:  [Breathing] Well, we knew generally the time of year, uh, that we wanted to
do it in three years ago, but we could not set the date until the first of
January this year because this park where they have it, uh, they allow people
in the vicinity to make their arrangements ahead of time and so we kind of had
to take what was left.

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And, uh, so we, we feel pretty fortunate to have gotten ((in)) at all. 

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  But, uh, uh, I think you need to plan on, you need to be sure and plan, uh,
at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people, you know, they
have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit. 

A.63:  Right. 

B.64:  If not exactly, at least know generally what they're going to do. 

A.65:  Okay. 

B.66:  Well, it's kind of important to, to know quite a while ahead of time.  Uh,
the last time we had one, uh, I was in charge of it and my goal was to write a
history of my, of my father and his brothers and sisters. 

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  There was a history of his father and mother, but there was no history on
them.  So I spent the two years before that compiling and, and writing the
history and then we gave it out at that.  [breathing] This year we're not,
we're, we're combining it in the, and the parents before and so we're going to
do some, uh, uh, acting out of, of these groups and try to help them get
better acquainted.  And mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're, we're
just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes, I think.

A.69:  Wow.  Sounds like you guys are, uh, your family's really into family. 

B.70:  [Laughter] Yeah, we're kind of like, we kind of, uh, well, we like each
other and we liked our families and so we figure they, the little kids ought
to get to know each other, and, and we are scattered enough.  There, I have
several children who live here, but I also have children in, in, uh, Nevada
[noise], and Arizona,

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  So, it's, it's really neat to be able to get acquaint-, get around with
them, you know. 

A.73:  Wow. 

B.74:  And, y-, you're younger. 

A.75:  Yes. 

B.76:  You have any family at all?

A.77:  Uh, well, I'm married.  And, uh, my wife is from a large family [noise]. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  But, my family, my mother's living and she has one brother that has no
children that's living and my deceased father has one sister that has one child
with, and no other children.  So I have, like, four relatives. 

B.80:  Not very many, huh?

A.81:  Not very many, no. 

B.82:  Do you, do you enjoy your, do you enjoy your, your wife's large family,
though. 

A.83:  It, too, it's, it was a large transition, let me tell you. 

B.84:  Was it? Is it?

A.85:  Because they had to meet one person, they only had to meet me and I had to
probably meet,

B.86:  # Yeah.  #

A.87:  # twenty-five # or thirty people. 

B.88:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.89:  So getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything
straight was a --

B.90:  Yeah. 

A.91:  -- quite a task.  Uh, I, I still kind of balk at it because they're really
into family, too, and like,

B.92:  You don't feel quite involved, huh?

A.93:  Well, they try to involve me and if I allow myself to be involved, you
know, I'll fit into the picture.

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  But, uh, they, uh, they make a big deal out of everything. 

B.96:  Well, you have to try it.  You'll like it [laughter]. 

A.97:  Yeah.  Uh, I guess so, uh,

B.98:  [Laughter]  It really is quite a lot of fun. 

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  And, uh, uh, uh, uh,

A.101:  I'm just not used to it. 

B.102:  Yeah. 

A.103:  Because our family has a reunion about once ever two years and, and it's
about a, you know ten people show up,

B.104:  # Yeah.  #

A.105:  # so # no one there's my age so I just kind of sit there and hang out. 

B.106:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.107:  But, uh, Carla has a lot of cousins that are our age,

B.108:  # Yeah.  #

A.109:  # and, # you know, so we get,

B.110:  Cousins get really, get really close sometimes.  Almost closer than
brothers and sisters sometimes.

A.111:  Yeah, it seems that happened with their family. 

B.112:  Right, especially if they live fairly close together so they get a chance
to see each other, it's --

A.113:  Right. 

B.114:  -- kind of special. 

A.115:  Yeah, there family was pretty well centralized.  Everyone kind of stayed
around the,

B.116:  Um. 

A.117:  the, uh, the grandparents. 

B.118:  Uh-huh. 

A.119:  For at least for a while.  At least while they were growing up. 

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  Now they've kind of moved out a little bit but not too much.  So,

B.122:  Yeah.
