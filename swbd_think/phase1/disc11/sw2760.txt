REMARKS:        Speaker A was on a portable phone and at one point it 
started a high pitched noise.  Speaker A's section of the tape was not 
very loud and was more difficult to pick up on everything. 

===========================================================================

A.1:  All righty.  Okay.  Have you recently had to return anything?

B.2:  Yes.  I have. 

A.3:  Okay.  Tell me about it. 

B.4:  Well, I have a V C R and I've had to return it a couple of times because of
the same part failure and, uh, it's,

A.5:  [Sniffing]. 

B.6:  still not getting a real good picture. 

A.7:  Oh, my goodness. 

B.8:  And after about three hundred dollars, I think it's going to be worth it
[noise] just to go ahead and get a new machine [/noise]. 

A.9:  You mean, it,

B.10:  So, 

A.11:  the warranty wasn't on it or,

B.12:  Well, I didn't get the extended warranty. 

A.13:  #Oh.# 

B.14:  #It was# out of warranty just barely.  So, uh,

A.15:  [Breathing]. 

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  Gosh. 

B.18:  So, how about you?

A.19:  Well, I haven't had to return anything recently, but I, you know, I feel
[noise], I'm going to, I'm on a portable phone.  I'm going to go closer to the
station here [/noise].  Uh, I, I feel like things are, are not made as well as
they used to be.  I, um, just c-, you, for instance, clothing.  I, you know, I
have two children and, um, w-, we s-, they, they like nice clothing and I
spend a lot of money on it and it just doesn't last.  And, I mean, I'm very
careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly what it says and it
s-, still, it, they still wear out very quickly.  Uh, I find things that are
sewn very poorly.  Uh, they, they co-, come unhemmed or unstitched so easily.

B.20:  Well, I will agree with that.  We've had some run-ins, [noise]  especially
with buttons.  As soon as you get [/noise]  them home, the buttons fall off,

A.21:  # Right.  #

B.22:  # after # the first time. 

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  And, uh, the threads on the inside of the garments --

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  -- seem like they're just, they don't cut,

A.27:  # They never cut them off.  #

B.28:  # threads off.  They're just a # wads of threads, and stitching does come
undone, you know, fairly soon.  And then, the prices you pay for them are,

A.29:  # Oh, #

B.30:  # ridiculous.  #

A.31:  I know.  It's really, it's silly and, and my, I have teenagers and they,
they think they want a certain brand or a certain item, well, when you buy a
brand name that's popular, you're paying for the brand name,

B.32:  Not only that,

A.33:  and,

B.34:  but they're no better than,

A.35:  no.  Ex-,

B.36:  a lot of the, the, the nonname,

A.37:  exactly. 

B.38:  brand stuff.  So,

A.39:  That's what I, you know, I'm saying that the, you know, if I'm paying for
the name and I'm paying that much money, it'd better be a quality product.
Now, I do, there's, there are some that I think are a little bit better.  And
I, and I've been real pleased with them and my kids ar-, have enjoyed wearing
them and they've lasted until they've outgrown them.  But, uh, the majority of
things, um, don't last and they're just very inferior.  And, you know, I try,
I try to look at the labels and I tr-, I try to l-, to buy things that are
made in the U S A because I think that's important.  And yet, I find a lot of
the, the, the homemade goods are, are inferior.  And also, with cars, I, um,
I, I bought a new car last Summer and I shopped around for a long time.  I
mean, we went to a lot of different dealers and I wanted to buy an American
car because I had had a Toyota and I really liked it, but I felt like
[swallowing] I needed to b-, buy something that was American made.  I felt I
owed that.  Well, I just could not find an American made car that I felt was
worthy of the price they wanted.  And, um, I ended up buying another, I ended
up buying a Nissan.  And,

B.40:  Well,

A.41:  I love it [breathing]. 

B.42:  (( )) the Americans just haven't gotten the message yet. 

A.43:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.44:  #That's#  one thing.  Because I'm, I'm the same way.  We, I do own an
American car, well a truck. 

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  But,

A.47:  # [Sniffing].  #

B.48:  # uh, # in trucks [noise]  I think you're pretty safe.  But, in cars, I've
not had an American car that I've been really pleased with. 

A.49:  Oh, I know. 

B.50:  One, for gas mileage.  And two, uh, the reliability, things falling off
the,

A.51:  # Exactly.  #

B.52:  # inside, # uh, you know, frequent tune-ups.  Every foreign car I've ever
made, I mean that I've ever bought,

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  I've, I've loved it. 

A.55:  Yeah.  And they're so much more solid.  They sound better [breathing], when
you're in them they feel, you feel like you're in a car and not rattling
around in something.  I, you know, I just, (( )) I just am real pleased with
the Nissan I had.  And I had a Subaru before the Toyota and I loved that.  It
was just the best car I've ever had.  In fact, I wanted to buy an-, another
one, but I, really [noise] it, really wa-, didn't have what I wanted.  They
didn't have the, the type of family car I wanted.  But that car, I had for
five years and I never had one thing go wrong with it and it, um, [lipsmack]
only thing I had to have replaced was the clutch and I had to do that twice
because it was my fault because I ride it all the time.  And, uh, so, you
know,

B.56:  # Well, clutches, #

A.57:  # it wore # out. 

B.58:  are something that you really can't,

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  judge.  I mean they, they, some go out faster than others and, you know,
that's, those kind of items like that, wear items, [noise]  there's no way you
can judge --

A.61:  No. 

B.62:  -- uh, like brakes. 

A.63:  Yeah.  That's,

B.64:  # Uh, #

A.65:  # true.  #

B.66:  I, we have a, a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen
thousand miles. 

A.67:  Is that right?

B.68:  It's just inherent for that car.  But, the, the car is super. 

A.69:  Oh, I know.  I've,

B.70:  # I'd rather put the,#

A.71:  # heard great things.  #

B.72:  brakes on it and, uh, and have the, the reliability,

A.73:  Yeah. 

B.74:  in the car itself. 

A.75:  Oh, yes.  And it's a,

B.76:  # But, uh, #

A.77:  # safe car, # too.  It's a good made car. 

B.78:  for the most part, it's been a good car.  We've had it for six years,

A.79:  Oh,

B.80:  now. 

A.81:  that's great.  Well, that, the, the Subaru I had, when I sold it, it still
had the tires, the factory tires on it and the factory battery [static] one.
I mean, that's how good it was.  I never had one trouble with the battery.
And, which is amazing in five years I didn't have to get a new one and it
worked perfectly.  And, it was amazing, the tires were, um, excellent.  And,
uh, you know, when I sold it, it didn't have that man-, it was low mi-, I
didn't think I had like thirty-seven thousand miles on it, which is, nowadays,
low.  But, uh, I got a good price on it.  It's got good resale value and it
was really a good car.  And, you know, it, it kind of is frightening.  I think
that you're right.  American, uh, manufacturers still haven't got the, the
idea that, that quality is important and,

B.82:  # Well, #

A.83:  # that, #

B.84:  if you can see the transition, what I'm beginning to see is that,

A.85:  [Breathing]. 

B.86:  the Japanese cars and, and even just foreign cars in, as a whole --

A.87:  Uh-huh. 

B.88:  -- are beginning to get larger. 

A.89:  Yeah. 

B.90:  But, they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability. 

A.91:  #Right.# 

B.92:  #Whereas#  the U S are beginning to scale down. 

A.93:  Uh-huh. 

B.94:  But the gas mileage doesn't improve,

A.95:  # You're right.# 

B.96:  # drastically.  #

A.97:  You're right. 

B.98:  And, that right there ought to tell them something. 

A.99:  Oh, yeah. 

B.100:  I know we have the technology, but I think it's the, the glut of the oil
companies and, and, uh, big business,

A.101:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.102:  # and # the government --

A.103:  Yes. 

B.104:  -- in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and, uh, they're
not controlling the things they should control. 

A.105:  Exactly. 

B.106:  So, I think there's a, there's a lot of things there to be said and, uh, I
will continue to buy [noise]  foreign cars if that's the most reliable product,

A.107:  # That's right.  #

B.108:  # especially when # I'm paying for it. 

A.109:  That's right.  Because you,

B.110:  And I, and I hate to have that attitude, but I do. 

A.111:  Well, the thing is, when you have to take your car in continually because
it's not working and pay that much money in repair pri-, bills, it's
ridiculous.  I, I had a Plymouth that was just the worst car in the world.
And, I mean, everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it.  I had
it in to the dealership more than I had it out.  It was terrible.  And I got
rid of it as fast as I could.  It was the most, it was a lemon is what it was.
And, uh, you know, I will never buy a Plymouth again.  Simply because of that.

B.112:  Oh, I know.  I'm the same way with G M.  I won't buy a G M car. 

A.113:  Is that right?

B.114:  Yeah.  I like Ford trucks. 

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  And then I like the foreign cars, especially Honda.  I've had a Honda --

A.117:  Oh, I've heard good things,

B.118:  -- # that I liked,#

A.119:  # about a Honda.  #

B.120:  and, uh, I mean, it was,

A.121:  [Sniffing]. 

B.122:  super car. 

A.123:  Yeah.  My niece has one and she loves it, too.  Yeah. 

B.124:  So, I think, you know,

A.125:  But, you really liked your Ford truck, huh?

B.126:  Well, it's been a good truck so far.  It's only got a forty-two thousand
miles on it. 

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  And, so far so good.  I,

A.129:  # Yeah.  #

B.130:  # don't # know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty
thousand miles on it. 

A.131:  Well, I'm looking for a used truck for my son and it's, it's really been
hard because we, I, we just don't have that much money to s-, to spend.  And he
just turned sixteen and --

B.132:  Oh, boy, huh. 

A.133:  -- uh, you know, I don-, I want to get an inexpensive truck, (( )) a small
one that, um, you know, I only have to pay a couple of thousand or, you know,
three,

B.134:  # Well trucks is,#

A.135:  # thousand.  #

B.136:  trucks keep, they hold their value --

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  -- pretty much.  And, and even used trucks are pretty expensive. 

A.139:  Yeah.  They are.  We did find a couple, but, uh, you know, they just, I
wasn't real sure about them and, uh, so w-, we kind of passed them up.  Um,
this one guy is not, is trying to make up mi-, his mind whether he wants to
sell his.  It's a Mitsubishi and it's an eighty-five, and he wants to sell it
for about two thousand.  But, uh, he's not sure he wants to give it up and
start car payments again.  So, we're kind of waiting for him to make that
decision, but,

B.140:  # Well, #

A.141:  # you # know. 

B.142:  I can't, I can certainly understand that.  I don't want any car payments
either.  In fact, when,

A.143:  Oh. 

B.144:  mine's paid off and,

A.145:  [Sniffing]. 

B.146:  our other one's paid off, uh, I don't want to get another car until they
just both fall apart. 

A.147:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're, car payments are outrageous,

B.148:  # Well, #

A.149:  # now.  #

B.150:  it's, it's just anymore they don't benefit you, uh, from the income tax
standpoint. 

A.151:  Oh, that's right. 

B.152:  And, uh, of course, we just can't afford to trade cars like that.  So --

A.153:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.154:  -- we're just going to make it go as far as it can.  And then when we're
forced to get one, we will. 

A.155:  Well, that's why it's important to find a car that you don't have to keep
taking in for repairs.  Because,

B.156:  # That's right.  #

A.157:  # if you're # going to keep it a long time, uh, you're, I mean, (( )) you
don't want to spend thousands of dollars on repairs.  So,

B.158:  Which can be easily done these days. 

A.159:  Yes.  Easily.  Easily.  And, you know, tha-, another thing about, not only
about, uh, you know, products, but services [breathing] you're not real sure
of anymore.  You, you take a car in and you think it's fixed or, and, and how
do you know if they really even fixed it.  And, and sometimes I wonder, you
know, and it's kind of scary.

B.160:  [Breathing]. 

A.161:  You just, you're not sure. 

B.162:  W-, where are you from?

A.163:  I'm fro-, I'm originally from Ohio. 

B.164:  Ohio.  And,

A.165:  # (( )), #

B.166:  # where are # you now?

A.167:  I'm in Texas. 

B.168:  You're in Texas?

A.169:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.# 

B.170:  #I# was going to say, because, uh, I was going to say, if you're up in the,
in the northern countries, the salt would be a big factor on,

A.171:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.172:  # I didn't # know how m-, how they take care of the warranty items when it
comes down to corrosion and that sort,

A.173:  Yeah.  It's, uh,

B.174:  of thing. 

A.175:  bad up there.  But, I'm, I've been in Texas like thirteen years now.  So,

B.176:  Yeah. 

A.177:  What are, what part of Texas are you from?

B.178:  Uh, from Coppell. 

A.179:  Coppell.  I'm from Plano. 

B.180:  #Plano?#

A.181:  #We're not,# yeah, we're not too far away [laughter]. 

B.182:  No. 

A.183:  [Breathing]  #((Uh)).#

B.184:  #In#  fact, my brother lives in Plano. 

A.185:  Is that right?

B.186:  Uh-huh.  #But,#

A.187:  #Well,# I don't n-, have much more to say about things.  I, I feel the same
way that you do, though.  I think it, things are, you know, need to get better
and I think you need, we need to have somehow more of a trust in, in U S made
goods and it's sad that we don't.  But, #uh,#

B.188:  #I# would, I would certainly like to.  And I hope that, that before it's
too late they do get the message.  And, I, I don't know, I think a lot of it
has to do with, uh, you know, just the attitude of the {fade out}.
