A.1:  Okay.  When is the last time I saw a movie?

B.2:  Yeah. 

A.3:  Well, I don't know it hasn't really been that long but my, my, uh, the last
movie I saw was on T V.  Uh, and I was trying to rememb-, it was called BACK
STAB and it was, uh, it was really intriguing and I found, I, I, I have, have a
problem where I just about forget them once I've seen them.  But I guess the
really, the one that I really saw that I really liked was GHOST.  Did you see
that?

B.4:  The GHOST?

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  Yeah, he wa-, it was really good.  I just thought is that was great. 

B.22:  Right.  Yeah, I thought that it made you think about, um, you know, what
happens when you die and everything and are there really angels and ghost and
things. 

A.23:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, it almost makes you kind of think about things.  It gives
you a different way of thinking, um, because,

B.24:  #Yeah.#

A.25:  #you're,# you're in, you, you know, you always wonder and when you see
something like that that kind of, well, hey, well, maybe it could be that way. 

B.26:  Right. 

A.27:  ((Uh,)).

B.28:  Maybe it's really, maybe I should take life more seriously and [laughter], 

A.29:  #[Laughter].#

B.30:  #and# be a little bit more careful but, uh, yeah.  #Um.# 

A.31:  #I know.#

B.62:  Oh. 

A.63:  Yeah.  And his, uh, an image of him was at the wedding and he was, uh,
talking to his friend Michael telling,

B.64:  An image of him. 

A.65:  Well,

B.66:  #Oh, like a ghost.#

A.67:  #it looked, looked like# him but it would have to been his spirit or
something. 

B.68:  Oh, that's weird. 

A.69:  And, uh, oh, I'm telling you I just cried and cried and cried and cried.
It was so, it was sweet but it was sad because, you know, you just really miss
Gary,

B.70:  Yeah, Yeah. 

A.71:  So. 

B.72:  Well, yeah, I know some of those, some of those shows are very moving. 

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  Um, I know I really liked some of them.  There, there's one about someone
got divorced, um, uh, one of the partners. 

A.75:  Oh, right.  Elliot and, uh, Nancy. 

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  Right.  But they're back together.

A.87:  #watch# those for a time if you haven't, if you,

B.88:  #Yeah.#

A.89:  #don't# need to know what's going on at all. 

B.90:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I don't have much time to watch T V, I'm a grad
student. 

A.91:  Oh, you are?

B.92:  Just trying to, uh, just trying to get a P H D thesis out so,

A.93:  Well, that doesn't leave,

B.94:  #Uh,#

A.95:  #too# much time for a movie. 

B.96:  Right.  Right.  But we go out occasionally and, um, there's some, there's
some good, um, sort of artsy movies.  I saw a computer animation festival.  It
was all about computer generated or else, um, actually, it was just sort of
animation in general.  Some where computer generated and some were hand drawn,
um,

A.97:  #Um.#

B.98:  #cartoon# like things.  Um, and there's some really neat stuff they can do
now with computers.  And [breathing]  and some of the cartoons are just
hilarious, um, but,

A.99:  Was this, uh, done not by T I people was it?

B.100:  Uh, no.  It's just there's an annual festival I guess, where they, they
collect the best entries and they make it into a full-length movie.  And each,
each cartoon is completely independent and separate from everything else and
laugh, you know, a few minutes. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  Uh, but some tell stories.  You know some are serious and some are funny. 
Um, but, uh, there all, there all fun to watch.  Uh, they're, they're, for, you
know, they're for adults they're not just,

A.103:  #Uh-huh.#

B.104:  #kids# cartoons they're,

A.105:  #Uh-huh.#

B.106:  #they're# genuine stories,

A.107:  #Uh-huh.#

B.108:  #and# things. 

A.109:  Um. 

B.110:  So, anyway. 

A.111:  That sounds interesting. 

B.112:  Uh-huh. 

@@A.113:  Well, go watch some movies and, um, if we get this topic again maybe

B.114:  Okay.  So, how does this topic get picked, did you, did it just get picked
at random or?

A.115:  Um,

B.116:  I don't know. 

A.117:  It's at random, right.  No,
