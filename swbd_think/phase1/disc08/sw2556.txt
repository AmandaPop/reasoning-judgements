=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, are you big into lawn and garden work?

B.2:  Well, um, I just bought a home so I've just now went out and purchased my
brand-new lawn mower, and, um, so I've been assembling it and haven't had a
chance to get out there and, and test it out [laughter]. 

A.3:  Well, do you, is it a new house or,

B.4:  No, it's, um, uh, it's an older home and, uh, so it already has the, the
yard's already been established, um, but there have like big oak trees in the
front --

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  -- and so the grass is not growing out underneath the oak trees.  So I'm
going to have get out there and do something about that, you know, spread some
seed and fertilizer and stuff. 

A.7:  Yeah, I think one of the, some of the problems with, uh, oak trees is their
leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of acid,

B.8:  #Oh.#

A.9:  #into# the soil. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  So I found that when I had a, uh, wooded lot that I needed to put a lot of
lime out --

B.12:  Oh, okay. 

A.13:  -- to, uh,

B.14:  #Okay.#

A.15:  #neutralize# the, uh, the acid from the, uh, oak leaves. 

B.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.17:  But there's still a problem that, uh, the shade,

B.18:  #Right.#

A.19:  #from# the trees just, uh, grass cannot grow. 

B.20:  Right, right. 

A.21:  And, uh, one of the things that, uh, we did, uh, just, we sort of made a
little garden that, uh, surrounded the trees --

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  -- and planted, uh, Pachysandra --

B.24:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.25:  -- which is a, a shade plant that seems to do well underneath the trees. 

B.26:  Um, that's an idea. 

A.27:  Yeah, so that saved the bare spots,

B.28:  #Uh-huh.#

A.29:  #and,# uh, it also eliminated mowing the, uh, that area of the lawn. 

B.30:  Yeah, [laughter]  that's true, that's true.  Yeah, I have, um, in between
the street and the sidewalk, see, are two of the oak trees. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  And then there's one, uh, sitting on the, facing the house on the
right-hand side in the middle of that whole section.  And then I have this
whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but j-, just the grass.
So that may be an idea to do, is, uh, because I've got that concentration of
trees right there, is to, uh, you know, just do something like what you said,
was to put some kind of, um, uh, little plants that does well in shade, uh,
the shaded area and forget about, you know, trying to plant grass and stuff
underneath that.

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  The other thing, too, is that the oak trees have those acorns, and I don't
know if I'm going to have to go out there and, if I can rake those up or if I'm
going to have to pick them all up by hand or what. 

A.35:  I don't think there's, it's, it's an impossible task [laughter]. 

B.36:  [Laughter]  Well, I know, but if you saw how many acorns were sitting up
under there you'd see.  It looks like an impossible task [laughter].  But we
have, um, um, Texas has a lot of the, um, wooden fenced in back yards --

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  -- for privacy fence.  So I did buy, a, a weed eater, too, and, uh, so I
could get, you know, around, uh, around the wooden fences.  And, um, uh, you
know, get all the weeds and stuff up out of there. 

A.39:  Yeah.  Well, one of the things you may need come Fall is a leaf blower or a
leaf,

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #vacuum.#

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.43:  Because I've, you know, my wooded lot at my previous house, uh, I didn't
have to mow the lawn very often because it didn't grow that fast. 

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  But in the Fall, I had to spend a couple of weekends out there on, you
know, two separate weekends,

B.46:  #Uh-huh.#

A.47:  #just# getting rid of leaves. 

B.48:  Wow.  So what, what did you, did, did you use, did you have a blower or did
you have the, uh, the vacuum?

A.49:  Well, I had a, a leaf vacuum,

B.50:  #Uh-huh.#

A.51:  #to# pick them up and, uh, in the front yard I would, uh, just drive up to
the curb and drop them at the curb.  The, uh, county had a pickup service for
leaves,

B.52:  #Uh.#

A.53:  #dropped# at the curb. 

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  And for the back I would, uh, vacuum them up and then put them on a tarp
and drag the tarp out front,

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  to, to dump them. 

B.58:  Wow. 

A.59:  And in Springtime you have to use bags to pack them. 

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, that, I've never, I don't think I've ever seen, um,
a, a vacuum, though, for the, for the lawn.  I know I've seen the blowers. 

A.61:  Yeah.  Well, uh, Craftsman put out a, uh, leaf vacuum a few years back. 

B.62:  Who was it?

A.63:  Craftsman, Sears and Roebuck. 

B.64:  Oh, Craftsman, uh-huh. 

A.65:  And, uh, I think it was about two hundred dollars or something like that. 
It was a very powerful machine. 

B.66:  Uh. 

A.67:  And it would have a tendency to pick up some of the, uh, acorns if they
didn't get, uh, pressed into the ground. 

B.68:  Uh-huh.  Ooh, that would be good [laughter].  I think that's, that's my
problem, is I, I couldn't believe, uh, because I, I guess the other people,
they weren't really outdoor type people because the lawn really needs to be, I
have, uh, bushes and stuff that really need trimming, and, um, so, uh, so I'm
just thinking how in the world I was going to have to scrape up all those, uh,
acorns that are sitting out there.  They even have some little trees growing
--

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- because they just left them, the acorns, I guess, sit --

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  -- rather than raking them up.  Um, so, you know, I'm going to have to get
out there and, but it was interesting.  I had to go buy a hoe and a rake, I
mean the whole works, because I've, I've lived in an apartment for so long
I've never had that kind of equipment.

A.73:  Right. 

B.74:  So that was, that was interesting to go down there and, and get all that
kind of stuff. 

A.75:  Yeah, it's especially delightful moving from an apartment to a house so
that you --

B.76:  Yeah. 

A.77:  -- you can have a little piece of turf you can call your own. 

B.78:  Right, right.  So this has been, uh, this has been an experience for me.
And, uh, but I, I can't wait until we have, uh, uh, some more time to get out
there in the front yard and, and really do, uh, you know, a lot of
landscaping.

A.79:  Uh-huh. 

B.80:  Because I want to cut all the, the trees that they, or the little shrubs
that they have, because some of them are like, um, they have the new, uh, green
leaves.  I don't if it's getting green up there where you are, uh, but they're
almost fully blossomed and, but there are like sides of them where there are
like whole dead, uh, portions --

A.81:  Uh-huh. 

B.82:  -- of the shrubs.  And, uh, so I've been debating of whether or not just to
cut out the dead portions or, you know, just to take it all out.  And I think
I've pretty well decided I'm just going to take it all out and start all over
again. 

A.83:  Well, you better price the new shrubs before you do that [laughter]. 

B.84:  [Laughter]  I'm just going to get the little baby shrubs [laughter].  The
little baby ones, you know, that take several years to grow. 

A.85:  Uh-huh. 

B.86:  There, um, well, it's not too bad.  I mean I, I thought they were pretty
reasonable, but I don't know.  I have nothing really to compare it with, uh,
you know, four or five dollars for a, for a shrub.

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  I don't know.  And, uh, I hadn't really wanted to get that many, you know,
to put out there.  I, I much prefer flowers. 

A.89:  Well, my wife got carried away this past year and, uh, she cleared out a
lot of the existing gardens,

B.90:  #Uh-huh.#

A.91:  #and# replanted with new things,

B.92:  #Uh-huh.#

A.93:  #and# I think she spent over a thousand dollars on plants and, uh,

B.94:  #Wow.#

A.95:  #and# fertilizers and mulch,

B.96:  #Uh-huh.#

A.97:  #and# everything else. 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  And it's,

B.100:  #Wow.#

A.101:  #it's# not hard to go through the money doing that. 

B.102:  It's true, it's true.  Ju-, just picking up the equipment that I have, you
know, and I didn't blink an eyelash.  That's what got to me when the man, you
know, said and that will five hundred and something dollars, you know, with
my, my big new lawn mower and stuff.  I was just, okay, you know.  So, yeah,
you're right, you're right.  You can, I think you can go through quite a bit
of money.  I think it depends, too, where you buy it from.

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  If you buy it from a nursery or, um, we have like Home Depot here.  I don't
know if you have that there. 

A.105:  We don't have that here.  W-, we've got,

B.106:  #Yeah.#

A.107:  #some,# uh, local nurseries,

B.108:  #Local,#

A.109:  #that# are pretty fair on price,

B.110:  #Uh-huh.#

A.111:  #but# still in the metropolitan area, they, they hold a gun to your head
while they, while you write out your check [laughter]. 

B.112:  There you go.  That's right, that's true.  I understand that.  Well, it was
nice talking to you. 

@@A.113:  All right.  Good luck with your new home. 

B.114:  Well, thank you. 

A.115:  And, uh, nice talking to you. 

B.116:  Oh, okay, talk to you. 

A.117:  Bye. 

B.118:  Bye.
