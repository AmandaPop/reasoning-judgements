REMARKS:        It sounded as if Speaker B was doing something to her phone
while she was talking or working on a computer keyboard.  It was a 
clicking-type noise.  Speaker B was understandable, but she sounded like 
she was talking through a can.

@A.1:  So, the, the topic is hobbies [laughter]. 

B.2:  In your spare time. 

A.3:  Yeah.  Who has spare time [laughter]? 

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.  I
used to.  I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  But that was, oh, good many, many years ago and --

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  -- I have, I really, my spare time I [noise] usually go do aerobics and
read, and that's,

B.10:  #Yeah.#

A.11:  #about# it [breathing]. 

B.12:  Yeah.  I understood that.  I'm, [noise]  you know, I work full time and I
have two kids [lipsmack] so my spare time usually [/noise] involves something
with the kids. 

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  You know, hobbies, we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.  It's
more like maybe [noise] projects or something on the weekend.  [noise]  You
know, we like to go out {pause},

A.15:  #Yeah,#

B.16:  #go# out,

A.17:  family.  Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, [noise]  we did
that like as a family, little ornaments and,

B.18:  Oh.  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  things like that, and just kind of really got into it.  Like during the
Christmas season,

B.20:  Right. 

A.21:  making them up for other people and things like that.  But --

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  -- as far as, I've just never been very skilled at,

B.24:  #(( )).#

A.25:  #far, you# know, needle,

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  work [/noise]  ((cloths)). And the things I've tried to do just don't look
very good [laughter], 

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  and,

B.30:  I, I guess mostly as far as, as [noise] crafts go, I've done, um,
[lipsmack] some needlepoint.  I've done mostly cross stitching.  I used to,
uh, do like, um, one that I did for both kids are like, oh, [breathing]
they're plaques [noise] with, you know, different kind of animals and then you
have their birth date on them,

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff,

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  but nothing steady.  Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll
work on it, but, you know, it's nothing [noise]  that I,

A.35:  It's not,

B.36:  can really,

A.37:  like you sit and knit every night [laughter]. 

B.38:  No.  Not at all. 

A.39:  Yeah.  I don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit, you know,

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #all# the time and, and I don't even know how to knit [laughter], 

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  I'm like, that's a lost art from this family [laughter]. 

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  So, um, but, it's not a very good topic it feels like,

B.46:  #No.#

A.47:  #if,# you know, not when you're n-, neither one of us are really, I, I
have seen things I really like,

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.  Needlepoint,

B.50:  Yeah. 

A.51:  cushions and things.  But, it just seems like there'd be so much time
involved in it,

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  you know, and, [noise]  and that the petty point and things like that. 
It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already
#made [laughter].# 

B.54:  #(( ))# I don't know [noise] what, what, is, it's like there, but here a
lot of the [/noise] country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a
lot of, uh, stenciling.

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff and there's
just tons of stuff everywhere and,

A.57:  #Yeah.#

B.58:  #you# know, people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go
out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more. 

A.59:  And see, they do that as their job.  Whereas,

B.60:  #Right [noise].#

A.61:  #you know,# for us it, and they make it cheaper [/noise]  for us to buy
[laughter]. 

B.62:  Yeah [noise].  Definitely. 

A.63:  So, but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those
figurines and things.  It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative, you felt
very creative. 

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  But, it just was so time, time,

B.66:  #Yeah.#

A.67:  #involved,# you know, so much time involved [noise]  and the different
steps and things. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  So, #and,#

@@B.70:  #Okay#  [/noise].  Well, I think, I think we're okay.  I think we did
[noise]  ((the)) five minutes, so we don't have to keep talking about nothing
anymore [laughter]. 

A.71:  Yeah.  #So,#

B.72:  #Okay.#  Well, thank you. 

A.73:  Okay.  I hope you have a good rest of your weekend. 

B.74:  Thanks.  #Bye-bye.# 

A.75:  #Okay.#  Bye-bye.
