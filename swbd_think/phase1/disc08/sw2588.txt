REMARKS:        The recording was muffled and it was often difficult to tell 
whether A or B was speaking. Both speakers ran phrases and words together, 
and both often spoke at the same time.

============================================================================

A.1:  Yeah.  Um.

B.2:  Okay.  I'm, uh, we're not that, we're not that big at dining out.  But, uh,
[laughter]  in fact, I guess, sin-, since, uh, we don't make it, uh, uh, make a
big hobby of it or anything, we're, we're really into, uh, we're interested in
economy and, uh, you know, a nice enough atmosphere that you can carry on a
conversation. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Good food, I mean, that's important too. 

A.5:  Yeah.  That sounds about what we, I mean, we go out to places, I mean, we
don't go to places where we all dress up and all that,

B.6:  Right.  

A.7:  you know, and all that.  We try to get, uh, you know, some place that, you
know, that's a little better than home and all.  But,

B.8:  Right [laughter].  

A.9:  you know,  it's not going to cost a ton of money either. 

B.10:  Yeah.  W-, well, we've got three kids and so, uh,

A.11:  Huh {faintly}. 

B.12:  I guess there's, there's two kinds of dining out.  There's dining out with
the kids and dining out without the kids.

A.13:  Oh, yeah. 

B.14:  And, uh, when we're dining out with the kids, the, the great places are
those where you, you know, I don-, uh, are you, uh, you in Texas?

A.15:  No, I'm in, uh, Maryland. 

B.16:  Maryland? Well, they've got a couple of places here, I'm in, I'm calling
fr-, Texas.  Um, there's a place that, you know, I can feed the five of us for
under fifteen dollars and, and it's all you can eat.  And, uh,

A.17:  [Breathing]. 

B.18:  that, that's the kind of place that you take the kids to [laughter]. 

A.19:  Well, I'd go there [laughter]. 

B.20:  [Laughter]. 

A.21:  All five, I mean, how, how old are the kids? [laughter]. 

B.22:  Well, they, they range from four to eleven.  And,

A.23:  That's pretty impressive [laughter]. 

B.24:  Yeah.  Oh, well, I, I was amazed because we lived, uh, I'd lived, uh, in
Virginia.  I was born and raised in Virginia --

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  -- and then, uh, we spent, uh, about ten years in New Hampshire --

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  -- and dining out, especially with the kids, has always been a major, you
know, thing. 

A.29:  Yeah.  We're, we're having a kid in October,

B.30:  Oh.  

A.31:  and  it's like, well, you know, no more,

B.32:  [Laughter].  

A.33:  no  more eating out for a while [laughter]. 

B.34:  Right.  But, uh, I was, I was just amazed.  There's this one place called,
CiCi's pizza,

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  and it's all you can eat.  And it's f-, for grown ups its like four
dollars, and it's like, I don't even think it's four dollars, it's three
dollars and something.  And for the, for the, the, uh, eight year old and the
eleven year old, it's, it's like, uh, two dollars and something, and for the
four year old it's a dollar something.

A.37:  Oh, that's incredible. 

B.38:  And it's all you can eat and it's decent pizza, [laughter]  you know.  And
it comes with a salad bar too.  But, I mean, the salad bar is essentially
lettuce and carrots. 

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  But, uh, but, you know, it's good enough to eat [laughter].  And then, um,
there's, uh, another place called Pancho's.  Course they have to have Mexican
food.

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  And, uh, the, uh, the grown ups eat for four dollars and something, and
the, and the, uh, the eight and eleven year old eat for, uh, two dollars and
something, and the four year old eats for free.  And, uh, the grown ups get
all you can eat and the kids have to have, can only have, like four items.

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  But you go sit down at a table.  The great thing about this is you sit down
at the table and they have a little Mexican flag.  And when you raise the
Mexican flag, the waiter comes over and he just gives you whatever you want
[laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter]  We've got, we've got to look around here. 

B.46:  [Laughter]. 

A.47:  Find out if there's anything like that around here. 

B.48:  Oh, you'll find something like that, uh,

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  especially  when you have kids. 

A.51:  [Laughter] Oh, yeah.  I mean, we just, we're like, well, we're not going
out for a while.

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  You know, my folks live close, you know, fairly close here, so it's like,
well, we, if we're going out to dinner, we can drop the kid off at my folks,

B.54:  [Laughter] I know.  

A.55:  and [laughter] it's like, oh, great, grandpa, you know [laughter]. 

B.56:  Well, Maryl-, Maryland has some, I mean, um, Maryland has some great
seafood, doesn't it?

A.57:  Yeah.  There's, um, there's a place, I live just outside of Baltimore, in a
town called ((Olicott)) City. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  And, uh, there's a seafood place here called the Crab Shanty that's really
good.  It's like rated higher than like the, the seafood restaurants down in
the inner harbor in Baltimore, you know, the,

B.60:  Wow.  

A.61:  the trendy section of Baltimore. 

B.62:  Yeah. 

A.63:  And, uh, you know, we've eaten there sometimes, and it's pretty good.
It's, you know, it's a little more expensive than,

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  than I normally like to spend.  Plus, the other thing is I'm not, uh, I'm
not a big seafood fan.  So, you know, it's like great, we go,

B.66:  Oh [laughter].  

A.67:  to the  Crab Shanty, and I'm going to have veal, you know. 

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  So wha-, what's eating out cheap for you? Is McDonald's or something like
that?

A.71:  Not that bad.  There's some, well, actually we've been, we end up doing a
lot is, uh, there's a couple of places around that are like, uh, yuppie, I
mean, it, it, seems like a big thing now with, uh, with diners.  Uh,

B.72:  Diners? Oh, yeah, the back to the fifties. 

A.73:  Yeah.  There's, um, there's a place up in, my, my folks actually live up in
Delaware.  And there's a place up there that we like to go to called, um, The
Hop.  Which is,

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  you know, just a fifties diner, basically. 

B.76:  Right.  Yeah. 

A.77:  And then there's, um, a chain around here called Silver Diner.  Um,

B.78:  Huh.  

A.79:  and, you know, you, and, uh, let's see, there's another one up in, uh,
just north of Baltimore, called Ralphie's Diner. 

B.80:  [Laughter]  Ralphie's [laughter]. 

A.81:  Yeah, um, it was fu-, I'm, uh, I'm a baseball fan, I, you know, my, my
girlfriend's like, you know, she, she puts up with me being a baseball fan, you
know. 

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  But, uh, we go, we walk into this place, Ralphie's Diner, and I look on the
wall, and there's like, uh, like a relief of the, of, of the guy who Ralphie's
Diner is named after.

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  And it turns out he used to work for the Orioles. 

B.86:  Oh, no kidding? [laughter]. 

A.87:  And she's like, No, not more baseball! [laughter]. 

B.88:  [Laughter]. 

A.89:  But, um, all these places, you know, you can get, like, you know, a
hamburger or, um, you know, um, I've had turkey and meatloaf at all these
diners.  And, you,

B.90:  Right.  

A.91:  know, we usually get out of there for around twenty bucks. 

B.92:  Yeah.  That's okay.  Yeah. 

A.93:  You know, it's good food and everything,

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  and, um, you know, you get [static] malts or whatever, so it's really good,

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  you know.  My only big gripe is every time I've gone to Silver Diner, I
have tried to get the banana cream pie, and they, they are always out.

B.98:  Always out, yeah.  We had a place like that, that had, uh, in Virginia.  It
was called Bill's Barbecue. 

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  And they had the grest-, greatest banana cream pie, and it wa-, was, uh,
you could take it home.  It was, was just, it was so popular.  It was great
stuff.  And now, now, my mou-, mouth's watering.  I'm beginning to think about
that.

A.101:  Oh, sorry [laughter]. 

B.102:  [Laughter]  Yeah, the, uh, yeah, twenty dollar, that's, we can do pretty,
that's, that's what we try to aim for, just the two of us.  Or, naw, you know,
if we want to have some wine or something we start get into the forty dollar
range, I guess and,

A.103:  Well, neither of us are big wine drinkers. 

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  Yeah, we went out tonight, and I had a, you know, I had a beer, and, and,

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  you know, obviously since, you know, she's, we're not, we've been kind of
laying off the alcohol since she's expecting and all that. 

B.108:  Yeah, sure,

A.109:  Um, 

B.110:  sure.  

A.111:  but w-, I mean, even before, I mean, usually we, you know, we might have a
beer, but that's about it.

B.112:  Yeah. 

A.113:  So,

B.114:  Yeah.  That's the same.  Well, we'll go to a place, and, of course, being
in Texas, we'll go to a place and the big thing is frozen mag-, margaritas.

A.115:  Yeah. 

B.116:  And, uh, so we'll have some nachos and drink, and they, they serve these
margaritas in, I don't know, do, do you ever go to Howard Johnson's? In, uh, I,
I don't know if there are even any Howard Johnson's around any more. 

A.117:  Yeah, there are. 

B.118:  You used to get an ice cream sundae in that big old goblet?

A.119:  Yeah. 

B.120:  Well, that's ho-, that's what they serve these margaritas in, these frozen
margaritas.  It's just,

A.121:  Yes, I've seen them. 

B.122:  huge things.  

A.123:  I know that, uh, CiCi's, has margaritas,

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  in  big glasses like that. 

B.126:  Yeah, yeah.  CiCi's, they, they have CiCi's down here,

A.127:  Oh, oh.  

B.128:  too.  But that's, that's sort of looked down upon because they're a chain.

A.129:  Yeah. 

B.130:  [Laughter]. 

A.131:  Well, I, I, I would, I mean, you know they've got them out here because
it's, you know [laughter], 

B.132:  Right [laughter]. 

A.133:  they don't actually know what Mexi-, you know, what Mexican,

B.134:  Yeah, uh, [laughter] yeah.  

A.135:  food is here [laughter].  

B.136:  [Laughter] Well, I didn't either.  I mean, you know.  To me, Pancho's,
where I can, where I can eat for less than fifteen bucks, to me that's
gourmet.

A.137:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.138:  And everybody, I say I went to Pancho's, they all down at me, down their
noses, you know.  It's like, uh, it's all right with me [laughter].  Well,
we've been to some, wha-, what have been rated fancy Mexican restaurants, and,
uh, they were good.

A.139:  Huh. 

B.140:  I have to say, they were good. 

A.141:  Yeah.  I was going to try, I, um, years ago, um, we, we're, uh, my folks
were, um, we were visiting Los Angeles or something.  And I remember being
taken to a real fancy Mexican restaurant there, called Senor, something
[laughter].

B.142:  Yeah. 

A.143:  Senor Pico, or something like,

B.144:  [Laughter].  

A.145:  that.  And, you know, I hated everything. 

B.146:  Did you? [laughter]. 

A.147:  At the time I just hated,

B.148:  Mexican, yeah.  

A.149:  Mexican food.   I'd, I'd love to go to some place like that now,

B.150:  Yeah.  

A.151:  where  it's, you know, a real Mexican,

B.152:  Yeah.  

A.153:  restaurant, 

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  because  I like it. 

B.156:  Yeah.  What kind of, what kind, do you like, uh, like Chinese or Italian
or,

A.157:  I, um, I like Chinese and I should experiment more.  The problem is, that
my favorite food in the world is cashew chicken.

B.158:  Oh, yeah.  

A.159:  So any time I go,

B.160:  My wife too.  

A.161:  to a Chinese restaurant I want cashew chicken [laughter]. 

B.162:  That's her favorite too [laughter].  Yeah.  You know, it's funny with
Chinese restaurants since you can't read the menu or anything, you tend to
stick with one thing.  I used to, it used to always be sweet and sour pork for
me,

A.163:  Uh-huh.  

B.164:  and then I just, I, I started getting a little more health conscious, and I
try to, uh, you know, try something else, you know, something with a little
more vegetables [laughter] or something.  But, yeah, I was the same way.  But
we haven't really eaten Chinese that much since we've been in, uh, Texas.
It's funny.

A.165:  I was just thinking the same thing.  It's like we haven't had Chinese in a
while.  ((Let's have a shake up)).

B.166:  Yeah, right [laughter]. 

A.167:  We get this, uh, there's this take out Chinese place,

B.168:  Yeah.  

A.169:  that,  I mean, you know, stone's throw from my apartment here. 

B.170:  Yeah.  

A.171:  And, uh, we can get, they do this thing for dinner for two, where we can
get like, um, Kung Pao chicken,

B.172:  Um.  

A.173:  you know, it's a big, you know, container full, Kung Pao chicken,

B.174:  Yeah.  

A.175:  um,  pork fried rice,

B.176:  Um.  

A.177:  two egg rolls and like, you know, I don't know, a pint or two pints or
whatever,

B.178:  Yeah.  

A.179:  of, uh, of, uh, wonton soup.  And it's like twelve fifty. 

B.180:  Ooh.  What a deal. 

A.181:  Yeah it's great. 

B.182:  Yeah.  That sounds great. 

A.183:  [Laughter]  We should have done that tonight. 

B.184:  Well, you know, it's funny, because the grocery store down the street, it's
one of these, you know, super grocery stores, they have, a, a Chinese take-out,

A.185:  Um.  

B.186:  in the corner of it.  And the food's decent but it's expensive, I think,
for, you know, especially since it's all take out.

A.187:  Uh-huh. 

B.188:  Uh, yeah, I'm, well I like Italian food too.  But you don't, there aren't
that many Italian restaurants around here. 

A.189:  There's, um, I'm trying to think, there's a French restaurant real close,
but we've never gone there because I'm not,

B.190:  Yeah.  

A.191:  oh,  I'm, you know, I'm not a big French,

B.192:  I'm into quantity, 

A.193:  you know, I,  I don't eat,

B.194:  and French, the French restaurants aren't [laughter]. 

A.195:  Yeah, well.  I also, I also don't do snails so,

B.196:  Right.  I don't do [laughter], 

A.197:  It seems to me there's an Italian deli nearby that's pretty good.  Uh,

B.198:  Well, of course when we,
