==========================================================================

A.1:  Hi Jim, the, uh, how do you get the most of your information?

B.2:  Uh, generally the most of my information I'll get in the morning with my
newspaper. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Periodically updated through the day.  I try to catch the news at least
once before I go to work, either on T V or on the radio.  Most days it's just
catching it on the radio dr-, on the drive in to work.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Do you enjoy mainly network news or like C N N?

B.6:  Uh, for world events I'll take C N N any day. 

A.7:  Yeah, [laughter]  any day.  Yeah. 

B.8:  But for, local, local coverage or statewide coverage, I'll take the local
news. 

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  A lot more indepth. 

A.11:  Do you, um, [lipsmack]  do you, do you get ((them)), do you feel like the
newspapers are generally biased, either liberal or conservative views?

B.12:  I, extremely so. 

A.13:  I, that's how it is here, too.  That one newspaper is very liberal, one of
them is very conservative. 

B.14:  And there's no midground anywhere in it. 

A.15:  Uh, doesn't seem to be.  Um, granted I, I, I read primarily the more
controversial topics, so I'm sure that it's easier for them to, uh, [lipsmack] 
be, you know, polarized, more so on the top-, on the, the news items that
interest me most.  But, uh, it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground,

B.16:  With,

A.17:  in either of the papers. 

B.18:  {Long pause} what I'm involved with doing is kind of a controversial job
anyway. 

A.19:  Really?

B.20:  I work with the, uh, state prison system, so I'm always kind of interested,
I look at the,

A.21:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.22:  what the liberal view is on the inmates need more rights, and I hear the
more conservative lines that we need to get back to {pause} making the
punishment fit the crime, but they never do go far enough. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  After four years with the system, I've got an extreme, almost an extremist
view on {pause} that end of the criminal justice system. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  Because what they got now sure isn't working. 

A.27:  [Breathing]  Well, I think that it's been proven since, somewhere in the
early nineteen hundreds, that rehabilitation, [breathing]  in the forms that we
have been attempting it, is not realistic.  {Pause} Um, I can't remember the
study but it was, there was a, quite a long-term study done in Europe that, uh,
evaluated the incarceration systems that America has based their systems on,
and, uh, it's been proven useless for rehabilitation.  Uh, which is what a lot
of people tend to believe happens in a prison.  And, um, there are amount of
reforms that could be helpful in that area [breathing]  are numerous and costly
and would de-, require a lot of task forces and [breathing]  et cetera and
ther-, there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof
[laughter].  Um, ((ar-,)) do you work with the inmates themselves?

B.28:  Yes.  That's, I'm a {pause} inside guard.  I also work in the segregation
department for the ones that mess up. 

A.29:  Goodness. 

B.30:  So, I get the real sweethearts [noise]. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  But I get a, {pause} asi-, aside from that I, {pause} I'd almost say I've
got extremist views on gun controls, on personal crime conventi-, uh, personal
crime prevention. 

A.33:  To, to,

B.34:  #There was a,#

A.35:  #which end?#

B.36:  thing recently in the paper.  There was a bill in front of the state
legislature that was going to allow {pause} the average citizen to be able to
pack his own weapon again,

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  concealed or unconcealed.  I'm all for that. 

A.39:  [Laughter]  Why is that? Do you think the average citizen has the, the, um,
uh, the wherewithals in order to use it?

B.40:  I don't know if every citizen does or not, but just, {pause} you having
lived in Houston you know what it's like out there. 

A.41:  It's,

B.42:  When I go to a shopping mall, if I, I feel under dressed if I'm carrying
less than two blades. 

A.43:  {Pause} [breathing]. 

B.44:  From the training I had in the military, I'd rather take somebody with a
blade at close range than I would with a pistol, because I know they're going
to go down, I know I can keep them down.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

B.46:  But, if the, if the option came up to where I could pack a side arm in the
open, I, I don't worry about carrying it concealed, I want them to know I'm
packing it. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  And given the option of that, I would definitely, {pause} when I went
shopping to the malls, I would definitely be packing all kind of pow-,
firepower. 

A.49:  Yeah.  I, uh, I, {pause} I lived in a part of Houston that was, uh,
unpleasant.  I lived s-, down [breathing]  in, uh, the Montrose area. 

B.50:  Wisdom City, okay. 

A.51:  Yeah.  And it was, it, I was, um, keenly aware of the, the, the danger in
my area.  [breathing] Um, my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed,
but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her.
[breathing] Um, and then I had another friend that was also approached and got
away.  [lipsmack] And this was in broad daylight both times.  [breathing] So,
I was keenly aware of the danger in those areas but I didn't [breathing], I
guess I didn't feel like I was competent enough with any kind of weapon
[breathing] to, to carry one or to feel [breathing] like carrying one would be
a benefit to me rather than just having them take it [laughter], you know.  I
mean, that's, I, that's, that's truly how I felt.  I felt like if I were
carrying something [breathing] and if I actually pulled it on somebody that
was trying to attack me, [breathing] that their chances of getting it from me
would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them.

B.52:  ((That's where)) the only stipulation I'd like to see tacked on to the
legislation saying that there had to be some form of formal {pause} firearms
instruction, N R, say N R A certified firearms instruction. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  You can't train somebody how to shoot in a combat situation until they've
been there.  I've seen it in Lebanon, I was in, in the Granada invasion in
eighty-three [baby_crying],

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  I was an advisor down in Central America in eighty-four.  I'm very
accustomed to knowing, when I pull a piece out, whether it's a full sized
firearm or a handgun --

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  -- when it clears leather, sh-, the shot's going to be fired. 

A.59:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.60:  #You# don't pull it out for show.  You pull it out to take care of
business.  The same way with the blade.  It, it comes out of my back pocket or
it comes out of a {pause} sheath on my web gear.  It's coming out and it's
going to draw blood.  You don't pull it, I'm trying to think it was the, uh,
{pause} in the Gurkha forces, out of India, [/baby_crying] had a legend that
went along with their legendary side arm, the kukri,

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  which is their blade. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  You never drew that thing out unless it was going to draw blood.  Which is
a,

A.65:  Huh. 

B.66:  good {pause} [talking]  {Woman talking to child} mental training aspect for
it. 

A.67:  Uh-huh {Pause}.

B.68:  Th-, that or any side arm, whether it be a blade, or whether it be a
handgun, or whatever. 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  [breathing] Oh, I feel that is, certainly if you're going to carry
one you need to be, uh, very comfortable with the piece and have enough, uh,
knowledge and insight for your own self on whether or not you're going to use
it in that situation and not pull it unless you intend to, because I, I feel
like that's, [breathing] you know, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm all for, uh, people
having, having firearms or having whatever form of protection they prefer,
because, you know, even though the odds is, you know, the criminal ends up
getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with, you know, the people
that had it in the beginning.  [breathing] But, [breathing] if the, if, if
you're talking about, uh, two people, if you're talking about a criminal, an
assailant that is coming at you with a gun and you don't have a gun at all,
well the chances are a hundred percent they're going to get you.  If you, if
you, both of you have a firearm, you've at least got that fifty percent chance
{pause} that you may get them first.  And so, I believe in that, [breathing]
but I, I've not ever felt comfortable in it.  I guess it's [laughter], I'm
glad I [laughter], I'm glad I [breathing], um, I'm, that I'm married to
someone who feels comfortable with them.  [breathing] You know, it's, it's one
of those things.  [noise] Um, I was reared in Texas so.

B.70:  There's also a moral aspect to it.  A lot of people have not, {pause}
either mentally sat down and gone over the moral aspect, can I take human life
even in a life threatening situation to myself or to a loved one?

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  And when it actually comes down, they don't have time to think about it. 

A.73:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.74:  #In that# fraction of a succeed that they're caught, {Tape flutters} I
don't know if I can do this, there's a bullet already on the way to them or
there's a blade already cutting them somewhere because they, {pause} they had
the time to react but they {pause} hesitated. 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

B.76:  And that's {pause} impossible to, {pause} in a classroom setting, explain
that to somebody.  They've got to {pause}, on their own, have made that
decision long before they ever decided to carry a weapon of any type, whether
it be a fighting staff,

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  up to a forty-four magnum.  Any, any of them.  In the correct hands they're
an absolutely fantastic weapon. 

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

B.80:  But, if you haven't made that moral decision, can I take a human life, even
under those situations where either my life, or a life of a friend, or a life
of a family member, is threatened, {pause} can you do, you defeated the
purpose of even having the gun --

A.81:  Uh. 

B.82:  -- or the, or whatever the weapon is. 

A.83:  Uh, I agree.  I agree.  That would be something that would have to be
[breathing], uh, evaluated, [lipsmack] I feel prior to ownership.  The, uh, I
think a lot of people hear only the sensation stories of this child being
killed or,
