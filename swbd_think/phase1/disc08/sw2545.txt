REMARKS:        Speakers talked on top of each other a lot.  Also, the tape
skipped many times throughout the conversation.  It also skipped
in different places on the individual segments.  This was a very difficult 
tape to transcribe.

===========================================================================

@A.1:  Um, so do you have a personal computer?

B.2:  [Breathing] Uh, well we do have one in, in our home, uh, it's on the
fritz right now, because the monitor isn't working properly but, [breathing]
uh, it has been, uh, used tremendously, mostly by my children [breathing] for,
uh, playing games [breathing].

A.3:  Oh [laughter].

B.4:  However, [laughter] um, you know, the bane of our existence these days,
[breathing] uh, but it does have a word processing program, which all of us
have used for [breathing] re-, reports and papers and that sort of thing.

A.5:  Yeah, that's what, when this subject was mentioned to us I said, well, I
went, gee, that's all I use mine for is a word processor, and I haven't used
it since I got out of college, and that was six years ago,

B.6:  Oh, wow.  

A.7:  but it, it was my sister's who, my sister bought it --

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  -- and, uh, my father had a small business and she thought that he would
incorporate it and use it in the business, and he never did,

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  he always did everything out by hand.  He only had three employees,

B.12:  Oh, yeah.

A.13:  so, you know, it wasn't really worth it to him to do, to do it.

B.14:  Yeah.  Actually, it would be worth it, if he were able to get a program
that would do something that he normally had to do by hand.

A.15:  Yeah, like pay, the payroll and,

B.16:  Exactly, and there are, 

A.17:  yeah, basically payroll. 

B.18:  lots of them on the market.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  [Breathing] But you do have to research that, find out what works for
your system [breathing].  What kind do you have?

A.21:  Um, it's an I B M, I think it's a Professional Three Hundred, no, that's,
that's the digital one.  It's an, uh, I B M P C Junior, I think.

B.22:  Oh, well, that's a nice computer. 

A.23:  Yeah she, she, uh, she uses it now, uh, my sister, to, actually, she moved
and my father wasn't using it,

B.24:  Uh-huh, so she took it with her [laughter]. 

A.25:  She (( )) took it with her,

B.26:  Yeah, don't blame her. 

A.27:  because she needed it to do, she just finished up her Bachelor's degree --

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  -- so I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore.  It, it's,

B.30:  Yeah [breathing].  Oh, well, well, encourage her to try other things,
because, [breathing] um, I am, uh, I work in a school system, and I teach
writing and [breathing] we use the computers a great deal for word processing,
[breathing] you know, because students really do seem to be freer when they
write on the computer, as you probably found out yourself,

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  [Breathing] but, um, I also am sponsoring a literary magazine, and we're
doing our entire layout on the computer [breathing], uh, because of the
graphics program and a page maker program that we have,

A.33:  Oh, yeah,

B.34:  a publishing program [breathing]. 

A.35:  that's, that's neat, that's,   

B.36:  So, it is wonderful, 

A.37:  a very good use.

B.38:  once you get into some of the programs [breathing] that are out now, you
can do so much with them,

A.39:  [Breathing] Yeah.

B.40:  that you don't do until you really make yourself use them. 

A.41:  Well, I know there, there's got to be a lot of uses, but [breathing] it's
just y-, you have,

B.42:  You have to make yourself do it, yeah.  

A.43:  to have a need.  Yeah, but you have to have a need.  I really have no
need for it at all,

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  [Breathing] um, I work for Digital Equipment --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- [Breathing] and we have a powerful computer down at work.

B.48:  Oh [laughter] so, you don't need a personal one [laughter]?

A.49:  No, and I, 

B.50:  Yeah. 

A.51:  I still really don't do that much, as you say, play games on it [laughter],

B.52:  Yeah, yeah.

A.53:  they're great for playing games.  

B.54:  #Right.#

A.55:  #My brother,#

B.56:  [Breathing]  Well, my son is, uh, studying electronic technology, and he's
been able to do things on [breathing], uh, on the personal computer here that
really have enhanced his, [breathing] um, reports, and his learning and all
because he can lay things out that way.

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  Um, and I guess it, if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful,
but, [breathing] um, unless it is, I guess it's kind of a waste.

A.59:  I know some people who just, they just went through a course, uh, and took
the electronic grafting course,

B.60:  Oh, that's,

A.61:  drafting, not grafting,

B.62:  fascinating.  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  [Laughter] but drafting course,   

B.64:  Yeah, 

A.65:  the C A D.

B.66:  I knew what you meant, yeah. 

A.67:  Yeah, and that's really neat, I mean, yeah, you can do graphs, graphs on it
too,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  but this is, you know, this is one step above it, but it's actual, um,
drafting,

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  and I always,

B.72:  Yes, you can do wonderful design.  It, it's really, s-, well, especially
when [breathing] anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering
w-, uh, dr-, drawing, [breathing] um, [breathing] you have to be so precise.

A.73:  [Breathing] Yeah, and the computer does it all for you. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  [Breathing]  So it was really neat.  I wanted to go to that course, but
[breathing] my boss wouldn't pay for it,

B.76:  Oh, well [laughter]. 

A.77:  I'm like, I'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it, I'll be
needed.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  Because, um, I, I, I didn't want to go do it myself because I didn't think
I was really going to use it.

B.80:  Uh-huh. 

A.81:  [Cough] ((I got)) this cough, I've got a cold because it was eighty
degrees up here and I went outside with no coat on.

B.82:  [Breathing]  Oh, boy [laughter].

A.83:  Yeah, it was bad. 

B.84:  What a change, huh? 

A.85:  Yes, it was a big change. 

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  You couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot, and then, again, I
picked up a cold.

B.88:  Right. 

A.89:  [Cough] But I'm doing all right, getting over it. 

B.90:  Well, that's good. 

A.91:  So I don't, I don't even know how much, um, personal computers cost
nowadays.

B.92:  [Breathing] Well, they vary tremendously.  Um, because you can get because
you're, they're, uh, the ones that were made a few years ago, [breathing] uh,
have come down in price significantly, [breathing] um, you can get them, I've
seen them for five, and six hundred dollars, but they're much less,
[breathing] um, have much less memory, and capable,

A.93:  Yeah, they can't do your, um, 

B.94:  of much less.

A.95:  your drafting and your graphs, 

B.96:  no, you can't do very much on them.  

A.97:  and all of that.

B.98:  Right.  Right.  Um, well, it's just that you have to have, uh, you have to
be able to get your program in, and, and,

A.99:  [Cough].

B.100:  m-, many of the programs are so big, [breathing] uh, they take up so much
space that you don't have any place then to work.  You don't have any,

A.101:  Yeah?

B.102:  bytes left [breathing] but, um, if you, um, if, if you want to go into
one that's really useful, [breathing] you're going to have to go over a
thousand dollars, and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to
spend that much, [breathing] an-, and we've, ours is not quite that powerful,
and so, you know, we are, we are limited,

A.103:  You do run in-,

B.104:  which may be one reason why,

A.105:  you do run into limitations on yours?

B.106:  Oh, yeah, 

A.107:  Oh, wow.

B.108:  uh-huh, some things we can't do, [breathing] but, but then we haven't
needed to either,

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  you know, um, but we've been able to do what we can.

A.111:  Wow, that's neat that you ev-, you even reach the limits of yours.  I
haven't even begun to reach the limits,

B.112:  [Laughter] No, but I, mine is not as good as a P C, uh,

A.113:  Junior, yeah.

B.114:  uh, Junior, yeah.  Yeah, ours is a Commodore One Twenty-eight.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  [Lipsmack]  And it, it's not quite as, um, as useful, not quite as
powerful.

A.117:  [Laughter] Yeah.  They,  

B.118:  So,

A.119:  say that Commodore has made a good, um, P C for the price, though.

B.120:  [Breathing] They did, yeah, that's very true, that's very true, they did.

A.121:  Very competitive.  I don't even, I don't even know much money my sister
spent on hers, but I, I just thought I, it's, it's going to be a waste, she's
not going to do it,

B.122:  [Laughter].   

A.123:  not going to use it.

B.124:  #[Laughter].#  

A.125:  #Oh, well.#

B.126:  Sounds like he, that you were right [laughter].

A.127:  Yeah.  Well, she likes it, she gets to write her reports, but like I say,

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted.

B.130:  And she could have bought a typewriter also [laughter].

A.131:  Yeah, a typewriter with memory would, {pause} would have been fine, 

B.132:  Yeah, 

A.133:  it's all she ev-, uses it for.

B.134:  yeah. 

A.135:  Um, I think it might have a spelling editor on it, I'm not sure.  Um,

B.136:  Yeah, it, yeah, it prob-, if, sh-, if it doesn't she could easily put it
on.

A.137:  Yeah.  Yeah,

B.138:  Yeah, right.  

A.139:  that's one of, the one great thing about it [laughter].

B.140:  Right.  Which program did you use?  Did you use Word Perfect?

A.141:  Um, no, I, I really don't, it's, it was six years ago.

B.142:  Oh, yeah. 

A.143:  She pretty much set it up.  She goes, here, this is, you make your file,
[breathing] and then you can, uh, edit it.  Right?

B.144:  [Laughter]. 

A.145:  Um, I used the one, the one at work a lot, um, matter of fact, anything
I've had to write from now on, [breathing] I had to ca-, [breathing] God
forbid, write a couple of resumes, and I was just great, and all you have to
do is just put it in a, uh, the sp-, spelling check mode,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  And [laughter] I don't even have to look my, my words up anymore.

B.148:  Yeah, they're great, you're right [breathing].  Well, 

A.149:  Oh,

B.150:  I guess we've spent our time.  I need to go help my daughter do
something, so --

A.151:  Okay. good.

B.152:  -- this has been fun talking to you. 

A.153:  Okay.

B.154:  Good luck. 

A.155:  Yeah, well, bye. 

B.156:  Uh, bye-bye.
