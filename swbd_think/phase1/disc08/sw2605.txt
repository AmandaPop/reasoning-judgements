REMARKS:        Speaker B tended to slur words and phrases, making it 
difficult to understand him in some places.  There is a loud squeak in 
the tape itself.

=========================================================================

B.1:  So, uh, I don't know what you mean by camping, but I mean tent kind of
camping, I guess. 

A.2:  Yeah. 

B.3:  That's what I normally do. 

A.4:  Yeah.  Well, do you?

B.5:  Yeah, yeah, nothing like R V -s or anything like that. 

A.6:  Because, uh, my father and I, in like back in eighty-three, we went, uh,
camping down the Appalachian Trail. 

B.7:  Oh, really.  The whole length or, uh?

A.8:  No, no, uh, it was just for three days. 

B.9:  Uh-huh. 

A.10:  We must have done like, uh, sixty miles or something. 

B.11:  Was it very crowded out there or,

A.12:  No, no, not at all, but, uh, you had, uh, you know, there was one part
like, we were waiting to get some water,

B.13:  #Yeah.#

A.14:  #right?# And we were looking at where we could get some water, and it said,
you know, it was like, we can either try to get here tonight or just sleep it,
and try to get there tomorrow morning.

B.15:  Uh-huh. 

A.16:  And we said, okay, let's just sleep in and try to get there tomorrow
morning.  And so, when we got there, the water that we were supposed to drink,
wasn't potable, like, well, you couldn't drink it. 

B.17:  Right. 

A.18:  And so, what we had to do, is we had to get on the trail or, on the road --

B.19:  Yeah. 

A.20:  -- and start walking down the road.  And then we found this little hut a
couple of miles down, that had, you know, that sold stuff. 

B.21:  Uh-huh. 

A.22:  So we just stopped there, uh, you know, had some breakfast, got some water
and kept on walking. 

B.23:  Sure. 

A.24:  And then, uh, my mother, who went to pick us up, we had a barbecue and, it
was, it was cool.  It was like, you know, you see a lot of deers up there. 

B.25:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.26:  And, uh, like one time I opened up the, the tent, and there was a deer
drinking out of a stream. 

B.27:  Um. 

A.28:  And so it was, it was cool, you know, and, and it was just, uh, very tiring
though. 

B.29:  Yeah.  The last, the last big camping trip I was on, was, uh, probably a
few years after that, but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado.

A.30:  Okay. 

B.31:  A bunch of us, uh, from here went up there.  And, uh, and I got hit by the
same thing, because we thought we were going to be real mountain men.  And,
uh, we got up there, and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the
water and make sure that it's,

A.32:  #Yeah.#

B.33:  #potable.#

A.34:  Yeah. 

B.35:  And of course we're up, you know, up above, you know fourteen thousand feet
or whatever, and we said, we-, well, how dirty could the water be? Right? You
nev-, never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that.

A.36:  Right. 

B.37:  You think, well, nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream, so it's got
to be all right.  So we were doing things like, uh, you know, we all had our
little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the water was coming over
rocks and all that, and we'd just kind of stick our cups in there and drink. 

A.38:  Yeah. 

B.39:  And then, we were there for five or six days.  And n-, n-, it was neat.
You know, we saw deer and, uh, had to put our, uh, food up in the, in the
trees and all that.

A.40:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.41:  I was the unlucky guy that got up every morning and said, well, I guess
might as well putz around here while everyone else is sleeping.  So I was
usually the guy who had to get it out of the tree, and all that. 

A.42:  Yeah.  I was, uh, I told my dad, you know, it was like, listen, Dad, you
know that I sleep a lot of hours.  Right?

B.43:  Yeah. 

A.44:  And so he goes, yeah, I do.  Okay, so he goes, You know, at least I sleep,
you know, maybe ten hours.  So if we go to bed at, you know, eight or
something, right?

B.45:  Right. 

A.46:  So he goes, well, if you go to bed at eight, then you'll wake up like six
in the morning.

B.47:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.48:  And then I go, no, no maybe I sleep more than ten hours, [laughter]  you
know. 

B.49:  That's, that's right.  You don't want to be the first one up and have to
put the fire on and have to ta-, take care of everything while everyone else
is sacked out.

A.50:  Yeah. 

B.51:  And then if they wake up and you haven't done everything, it's like, why
haven't you done that? But, uh, well, we were drinking, you know, back to that,
uh, water thing.  And of course I got sick. 

A.52:  [Laughter]. 

B.53:  About the second or third til the end of the day, I'm, I'm uproariously
sick, and I'm in the tent, sweating it out,

A.54:  #Yeah.#

B.55:  #and# the two guys I was with, they were like, well this, you're a wimp,
you know, because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay.  So they
went out fly fishing and they're having a great time. 

A.56:  Uh-huh. 

B.57:  And, and just all the way back to Dallas, I'm just uproariously sick.  And,
uh, we get back here, and of course, the first day back at work, I go to work
and where are these guys? And they were off, both off a week, sick. 

A.58:  [Laughter]. 

B.59:  Because they were just, it's just like it took,

A.60:  #It hit them, wham!#

B.61:  #them a little longer# to hit, it hit, and it hit them, and they were just
like calling into work going, oh, I'm miserable, I'm, I'm just, I can't keep
anything down,

A.62:  #Yeah.#

B.63:  #I'm# and I just cramps.  And I'm just going, hey, tell me about it,
right? And, uh, but, uh, that was probably the last big camp, that's probably
the last big camping trip I've, I've gone on.  I haven't gone in a few years on
anything real big. 

A.64:  What, uh, do you work for T I?

B.65:  Uh, no, no.  But I know somebody who does, and that's how I got into this. 

A.66:  Oh, okay. 

B.67:  So, but, uh, but in fact it's funny that's this was the topic, because I
was just reading Outside Magazine here this morning.

A.68:  Yeah. 

B.69:  And, uh, and that, some big issue on the only way to camp, about, about
canoe camping.  And, uh, and I've, I've done a lot of canoeing, but never have
camped out over night.  And, and they makes a lot, make a lot of good points
about, at least with a canoe, you don't have to carry everything. 

A.70:  Yeah. 

B.71:  You just, you can throw big tents and food and, and,

A.72:  #Yeah.#

B.73:  #stoves# and everything in.  And all you have to do is just, you don't even
have to, if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle, and it's, uh,

A.74:  Well, it all depends on what the rapids are like. 

B.75:  Well, that's true too, as long as you're not going to, going to hit any
white water or, you know, if you're just doing a nice calm river,

A.76:  #Yeah.#

B.77:  #it's,# uh, it's, it, uh, you don't have to put very much effort into it. 
And, uh, boys, I guess as I get older, that'll get more and more [laughter], 

A.78:  #[Laughter].#

B.79:  #appetizing.# The truck and,

A.80:  And then all you'll have will be road camping trips, you know.  Let's just
go out to the mountains with the car,

B.81:  #That's,#

A.82:  #honey# and, uh,

B.83:  right, and, uh, and if we're lucky, we'll talk somebody into taking the car
downstream, and we'll just throw the canoe in there,

A.84:  #Yeah, really.#

B.85:  #and, uh,# and, uh, tell you what, we'll just, we'll just float downstream
and, uh,

A.86:  [Laughter]. 

B.87:  That's, that's, that's about as,

A.88:  #No paddling,#

B.89:  #tough as,#

A.90:  no paddling,

B.91:  nope, that,

A.92:  we'll just grab the rudder and you, you work the rudder yeah,

B.93:  Just keep us off a rock, and we'll just let the, let the stream take us
down river and all that.

A.94:  Yeah. 

B.95:  But, uh, but, uh, well, you, over there in ca-, North Carolina, you
probably get a lot of chance to, you've got a lot of rivers and a lot of, uh,

A.96:  #Yeah.  But,#

B.97:  #white, white# water over there, I think. 

A.98:  But I'm a, you know, I'm a student,

B.99:  #Uh-huh.#

A.100:  #and# so, and I also don't have any transportation. 

B.101:  Yeah. 

A.102:  And so the, the people that actually do cam-, do camp, I don't, I don't
really get along with them. 

B.103:  Uh-huh. 

A.104:  You know, they're like, I don't know if I could stand to being, you know,
two days in the woods with them, you know. 

B.105:  Yeah, yeah.  That's probably true, because, uh, that's,

A.106:  You have to know who you're going with to get along. 

B.107:  That's true, you can't even, uh, because I know, uh, even I and my wife
would probably, uh, have a hard time sitting in, sitting out in the woods for a
couple of days.  And, uh, you've really got to be careful who you go out there
with --

A.108:  Yeah. 

B.109:  -- and that they're out, they're out for what they're doing and you're out
for what you want to do, and then you all get, get to do what you want to do, I
guess, while you're out there. 

A.110:  Yeah. 

B.111:  But, uh,

A.112:  Oh, well. 

B.113:  Well, well,

A.114:  It was nice talking to you. 

B.115:  All right. 

A.116:  Bye-bye. 

B.117:  Bye-bye.
