REMARKS:        Problem with the recording.  Choppy, starting & stopping.  

=============================================================================

B.1:  Oh, I'm sorry [laughter].

A.2:  It's okay.  ((You)) can get started there.

B.3:  Okay, I think L A LAW.

A.4:  Oh, that's probably what I was going to say.

B.5:  And, uh, DALLAS.

A.6:  Okay.

B.7:  [Laughter] I, I'm a, I'm a veteran of all of DALLAS shows.

A.8:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.9:  It's very embarrassing [breathing].

A.10:  ((Oh, yeah)).  Where, where are you calling from?

B.11:  Dallas.

A.12:  Dallas, yeah.  I'm from Rowlett.

B.13:  Oh, okay.  I just moved,

A.14:  (( )).

B.15:  here last April.

A.16:  Oh, really? 

B.17:  And, uh, I, I got, I got married to a T I -er and the first thing my mom
and I did when we moved out here was go to Southfork [laughter].

A.18:  Really?  I was going to ask you if you've been out to Southfork.

B.19:  It was very embarrassing [laughter].  They have a museum there of all the
DALLAS, uh, uh, people.

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  And they ha-, they even have a, a genealogy chart of all of the people who
married who and whose children are whose, and they even went so far as to put
dotted lines on there as to who had an affair with who.

A.22:  Uh.

B.23:  It was pretty bad because I understood all of it [laughter].

A.24:  Okay [laughter].  I, I can't say I'm that much of a faithful DALLAS
follower.  Maybe it's because, because I live here and I know how hokey it is
[laughter].  I don't know.

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  One of my, uh, uh, I went to school out in Plano, and one of my, my
classmates married one of the, uh, uh, oh, God, Duncans that actually owned,

B.27:  Oh, yeah.

A.28:  Southfork, that started, so, and I think she was in some of the shows for
a while as extra and stuff so, 

B.29:  Yeah, that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family.

A.30:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

B.31:  They kind of went in there and took over.

A.32:  Well, what are you going to do?  They're, they're coming to the end of
their season, uh.

B.33:  Well, that's what I'm doing May third. 

A.34:  (( )).

B.35:  I'm going to sit right here watching.

A.36:  I was going to say, there's going to be no more DALLAS reruns.

B.37:  Actually, I haven't watched it much this ((season)).  In the last couple of
years I've been on that, uh, downward trend.

A.38:  Yeah.  Of course, they're, uh, they're probably going to set it up for some
kind of sequel or something in the future and, uh [laughter],

B.39:  Yeah, those T V movies,

A.40:  Yeah, it's got to come back.

B.41:  or something.  It was funny, I, I spent a, a year overseas a few years
ago.  And all the T V was, I was in Japan and all the T V shows were in
Japanese.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  But they showed reruns of DALLAS, and it was great because I could turn it
on and all of the people were very familiar to me, and I'd seen all of the
shows so I knew what was going on [laughter].

A.44:  So you didn't need to know the language.

B.45:  Huh-uh.

A.46:  How about that.

B.47:  But it was, it was really nice when you ((move to)) such a foreign
culture to see all these familiar faces [laughter].

A.48:  True, and hear, hear the weird voices.

B.49:  Yeah,

A.50:  But, uh, 

B.51:  all those dubs, it's terrible.

A.52:  Yeah, somebody one time was talking about John Wayne movies with these
weird Japanese voices and,

B.53:  [Laughter].

A.54:  it's hard to imagine.  Well, what do you think about what's going on on L
A LAW this year?  It's,

B.55:  Well, 

A.56:  Have you seen it the past couple of weeks? 

B.57:  I can't remember the last time I saw it.  I know that, um, Susan Dey is
with Jimmy Smits.

A.58:  Yeah, and she's pregnant.  Did you know,

B.59:  #Yeah.#

A.60:  #that?# 

B.61:  And that just, she doesn't belong with him [laughter].

A.62:  And that they kicked Michael Kuzak out.  Did you know that?

B.63:  No, he's not with the firm anymore? 

A.64:  No, he, uh, the, the, I'm trying to remember, Leland decided to extend
Brackman's, uh, reign as a senior partner.

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  And the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it.  And Michael met
with them and said, and said you know, we got to do something about this.  We
need to make a proposal that somebody else be the leader, and he kind of
elected himself.  And everybody else went along with it, and they, they, uh,
gave it to Leland and he hit the roof.  And, um, he and Brackman talked about
it and, and Brackman decided to try and do away with him, so he fired him
because he, he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior
partner's back or something.  So they fired him.  They chased him off with the
security guards.

B.67:  Really.

A.68:  They're fighting out that battle.  Now he's firm-, formed his own firm.
He, uh, what else did he do?  He did a lot of nasty stuff behind their back.
Yeah, he stole Grace and Victor.  They've gone with him.  Um --

B.69:  Wow.

A.70:  -- and, um, who are the other two?  He stole two associates [talking]
{sounds like speaker is talking to someone in the room}.

B.71:  Um, the, the tax attorney.

A.72:  Abby and Jonathan.

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  He, he took Abby and Jonathan with him.

B.75:  Really.

A.76:  Yeah, and he, he went to, uh, he went to the bank and he took, um, I can't
remember the guy, the guy he defended for murder, [talking] Earl.  You know
they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills.  Do you
remember that?

B.77:  Ear-, the, the black guy that, 

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  He was a teacher? 

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  Th-, they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because
it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something.

B.83:  Whoa.

A.84:  Well, Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars --

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  -- so that, they cut that out so they, they couldn't have a lien on his
house anymore.  So he did away with that and then he went to the bank, because
the bank gave him, apparently, some extra credit because they had that lien.
Well, since they didn't have the lien anymore, they couldn't have the credit
from the bank so that, that got the firm in hot water.

B.87:  Oh.

A.88:  And then, then Michael went to court and, and, uh, petitioned that they
needed to go into solvency because they were so financially in bad shape.

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  And, uh, they all showed up in court.  Um, Leland was going to try a
motion, make a motion before that.  So they ended up both being in court in
front of the judge pleading their case, and, um, I think, I think Michael was
doing it on the one hand and the guy that, do you remember the guy that, that,
uh, Grace had an affair with, the other lawyer that she had an affair with for
a while?  Kind of an older guy [talking]?

B.91:  At the firm? 

A.92:  No, he wasn't at the firm.  

B.93:  Oh,  

A.94:  He was like Rosalyn Chase's lawyer before.  It was earlier in the season.
She had an affair with this other lawyer.

B.95:  No, I guess I didn't see those.

A.96:  And, and anyway, Le-, Leland apparently has hired him on now, and he's
[breathing] and he's defending this case.

B.97:  Jeez.

A.98:  And what happened at the end is the judge, um, um, Michael wa-, wanted the
firm put in receivership and the judge wouldn't do it, but he said he, he's
going to give a, like a ten day evaluation, and he was going to put it in the
hands of a businessman to, to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or
not.

B.99:  Uh-huh.

A.100:  And, and both parties had to come up with, with lists of people that were
suitable to, to run it, and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his
own person.

B.101:  [Laughter].

A.102:  You'll, you'll never guess who this person is.

B.103:  Who? 

A.104:  [Laughter]  Think of the wor-, well, it might be hard, but think of the,
the worst person that's been on the show in, in the past two years besides
Rosalyn.  She's dead and gone.

B.105:  Yeah, she's, that was weird [laughter].  That was very weird.  Um, the
worst person.

A.106:  Goofy.

B.107:  I don't know.

A.108:  You'll never get it.  It's, it's, uh, was it Roxanne, Roxanne {sounds like
speaker is talking to someone else in the room}?

B.109:  Roxanne the, the secretary? 

A.110:  Roxanne's ex-husband.

B.111:  [Noise] {Sound of disbelief}.

A.112:  David Meyer.

B.113:  Well, he's got a lot of business smarts, though.

A.114:  Yeah, I know [laughter].

B.115:  [Laughter].

A.116:  That's who he put in charge of the firm.  He, 

B.117:  I think what she did to him was a travesty.

A.118:  Yeah, but he's going to be, he's going to be running the firm for the next,
I don't know, ten days or whatever to evaluate.

B.119:  That's funny.

A.120:  [Laughter]. 

B.121:  Boy, they've really got their, uh, talk about a genealogy chart [laughter].

A.122:  Yeah, that's pretty, pretty strange.  Well, they, they've already said
that, um, who is it, I guess it's Susan Dey and, and, uh, whoever plays Kuzak
isn't coming back next year, so,

B.123:  Yeah.

A.124:  some of this, some of this has to do with why they're not coming back, I
guess.

B.125:  Well, is, um, the tax attorney and his wife still married?

A.126:  Yeah, they're going to stay there.  In fact, um, Susan Dey and, and, uh,
the wife had, had a confrontation about it --

B.127:  Oh.

A.128:  -- why, why they didn't invite them.  And, and the, the firm that Kuzak
founded is just a litigation firm.  And they said, well, we wanted, we wanted
you but we didn't really want Stuart because he's not a litigationist --

B.129:  Right.

A.130:  -- and we didn't figure you, you would come without him and, and we're
going to be fighting against each other so [laughter],

B.131:  Oh.

A.132:  so it's just kind of weird.

B.133:  That, that's a weird marriage.

A.134:  Yeah.

B.135:  They're married in real life.

A.136:  I know [laughter].

B.137:  [Laughter].

A.138:  I know.

B.139:  They've had, I was surprised when they started having big problems, and
then I only caught part of the episode where he went on that, uh, nature deal.

A.140:  Uh-huh.

B.141:  And he got real into it,

A.142:  Yeah.

B.143:  I guess.

A.144:  Yeah, that was kind of a bummer.  Yeah, it's interesting to talk about
their, their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that,

B.145:  Oh, she did.

A.146:  Yeah, and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show
where there were some real emotional things going on with,
