==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. 

A.2:  Okay. 

B.3:  What's, what's your most recent one that you've seen?

A.4:  Well actually, what I do, I haven't been to a movie theater in probably
eight or nine months,

B.5:  #Uh-huh.#

A.6:  #so# I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater but I rent
probably four or five movies a week. 

B.7:  Really, I used to do that too, but I haven't been doing it lately but,

A.8:  We've got a good video place out here and, uh, uh, oh gosh, uh, I'm just
[laughter]  trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen.  Uh, oh, AIR
AMERICA. 

B.9:  No, see, I haven't seen that one, uh. 

A.10:  Have you seen WILD ORCHID?

B.11:  No, is it good?

A.12:  Well, it depends, do you like, uh, steamy movies [laughter]. 

B.13:  Uh, no, not ye-, [laughter]  I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,
but usually I don't [laughter]. 

A.14:  Oh, okay, what type of movies do you like?

B.15:  Um, action [laughter]. 

A.16:  #Bu-, d-,#

B.17:  #I, I# guess one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably
like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO.

A.18:  Okay. 

B.19:  And those are, those are like two of my most favorite, I mean they're just
really good movies.  And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. 

A.20:  Yeah. 

B.21:  And movies like that. 

A.22:  Do you like suspense movies or do you like, uh, just action or,

B.23:  Um, yeah, some, I guess like, what do you mean like, like are you talking
about movies #like DIE HARD TWO.# 

A.24:  #Oh, JAGGED EDGE,# JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. 

B.25:  Okay, yeah, I liked that, that was pretty good. 

A.26:  Or, uh, FATAL ATTRACTION. 

B.27:  Um, that was okay, I, I don't, I guess I thought it was too far fetched but
so many people said oh, no it wasn't, you know.  But I guess,

A.28:  Oh, [laughter] well I hope I don't run across them. 

B.29:  [Laughter] Really, that's true because, I don't know, I just didn't find
that one to be real, I, I just thought it was too far fetched. 

A.30:  What was your favorite all time movie?

B.31:  Um, {pause} oh gosh, I don-, I can't think off my head.  Do you know which
one yours was?

A.32:  I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the
most, uh, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, uh, STAR
WARS.

B.33:  Oh, yeah, well that's,

A.34:  When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or
anything like that. 

B.35:  #Right.#

A.36:  #I# mean, I guess, uh, out of all the movies, I've, I've never been as
excited to go back.  I was ready to go back and see it again, you know
[laughter]. 

B.37:  Really.  Yeah, yeah, you're right about that, but that that's really like
an all time classic.  I mean, I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat
that.

A.38:  Now, I, I also liked, uh, oh, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic,
like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. 

B.39:  See, I've never seen that. 

A.40:  Oh, you haven't?

B.41:  No, should I rent it?

A.42:  Oh, yeah. 

B.43:  Should I go rent it tomorrow [laughter]. 

A.44:  No, that's, uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie and it's got a
good historical perspective to it. 

B.45:  That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking
history in school [laughter].

A.46:  Oh, yeah. 

B.47:  So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. 

A.48:  [Laughter]  Actually, I just saw a movie, uh, called THE LOST CAPONE. 

B.49:  Oh. 

A.50:  And it's about Al Capone's brothers. 

B.51:  Oh, really. 

A.52:  Primarily one of his brothers, and I won't give the, the whole plot away
but it's, it's really a good movie.  Uh, Al Capone had three brothers,

B.53:  #Uh-huh.#

A.54:  #and# one of them was lost for many, many years and, uh, he actually, he
turns out to be a law man. 

B.55:  Really. 

A.56:  Yeah, it's really interesting it,

B.57:  Oh, you just gave it away, I guess I can't go see it [laughter],  no. 

A.58:  No, that's okay, I didn't give away the whole thing, I just gave away just
enough to get you interested [laughter]. 

B.59:  That does sound good, is it one, I guess it's a rental. 

A.60:  Yeah, it is. 

B.61:  Okay, I may have to do that.  Go see it, or go rent it. 

A.62:  And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an
actress,

B.63:  #Yeah.#

A.64:  #and# seeing like all, I've seen all of James Dean's movies. 

B.65:  #Uh-huh.#

A.66:  #Uh,# all of Mae West's movies.  And, just kind of, kind of go out and,
uh, rent all the movies and, uh, uh, you know, just kind of go, I guess you
could do that, you know, get all of David Carradine's movies,

B.67:  #Uh-huh.#

A.68:  #or,# uh, uh, Segal, to, what's his first name.  I can't remember his first
name.

B.69:  Um, it's not David is it?

A.70:  Is it David Segal.  I don't know, he was on, uh, on, uh, uh, Arsenio, just
recently. 

B.71:  Oh, I don't, I don't watch that [laughter].  Um,

A.72:  It was really kind of interesting because,

B.73:  #Really.#

A.74:  #Arsenio# was asking him about, uh, what he thought of, uh, one of the
other action guys.  God, I can't even remember the name.  He said well, he
wouldn't really talk about it.  Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't
think he was such a, uh, a good action guy. 

B.75:  Huh. 

A.76:  It wasn't Stallone, it was, uh, I can't remember.  Shoot, I can't remember
the guys name.  But I like all the, the RAMBO movies. 

B.77:  Oh, see, I didn't really care, [laughter]  that's, that's one side of the
action I guess that I didn't really care for but see I don't really like
Sylvester Stallone. 

A.78:  Yeah. 

B.79:  I don't think he's really a very good actor.  I know that sounds awful
because so many people think he's so wonderful but I just have never been a
Stallone fan. 

A.80:  Yo, Adrian {imitates Rocky}.

B.81:  [Laughter] Hey that's pretty good. 

A.82:  [Laughter]. 

B.83:  No, I guess like I say, I just have, I don't know, I just have never seen
any interest in him, but. 

A.84:  No, we, we actually rent, uh, probably a go-, good combination of movies
with the exception of horror films. 

B.85:  Oh. 

A.86:  Don't watch really very many horror films at all. 

B.87:  Yeah, I don't either [laughter]. 

A.88:  You know, I don't know, there's something about people coming up through
the sofa to get you, or something, you know,

B.89:  #[Laughter] Yeah, you're right.#

A.90:  #coming out of the# T V that just doesn't make my day, you know. 

B.91:  Well it's so, I guess, I'm a real, I'm a realist, and so, when I watch
movies like that, it's like this can not happen.  So, I just don't enjoy it,
you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break.

A.92:  #Yeah.#

B.93:  #You# know, I mean, I just and so many of them are done so poorly,

A.94:  Yeah.

B.95:  you know that, it just doesn't even give you the effect, I mean
some of them are done good and they do scare you.  But, um, so many of
them are just done real, I don't know, I'm not really into those.

A.96:  I just saw, uh, uh, a really interesting movie called, uh, FLATLINERS. 

B.97:  Oh, that was one of my favorites, yes. 

A.98:  [Laughter]. 

B.99:  I thought that was a very good movie. 

A.100:  Yeah. 

B.101:  I was really impressed with that one.  I mean it was, what I liked about it
was that it was a new subject.  Nobody had ever touched it before. 

A.102:  Yeah. 

B.103:  You know, and it was just, it was done so well, you know, it was just,

A.104:  It was just crazy enough for th-, you know students might try to do it.
You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.

B.105:  Right, well that's probably true [laughter].  But it was a very good movie.
It was done real well too.  I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really
felt like, no, this can't happen.  It seemed re-, it seemed real, you know it
was really good.

A.106:  Yeah. 

B.107:  That, that was one, I mean it's not my all time favorite movie but it was
good, it was really good. 

A.108:  Yeah. 

B.109:  And, um, I don't know if you like this kind, but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was
a really good movie, too. 

A.110:  Oh, yeah, that was a great movie. 

B.111:  Yeah, I've, we've seen that two or three times.  We waited and we rented
it,

A.112:  #Yeah.#

B.113:  #you# know, but, but it was really good. 

A.114:  Uh, have you seen SHRIMP ON THE ((BARBY))?

B.115:  No, I haven't, I don't know if I've even heard of that one. 

A.116:  Ye-, ye-, yeah, it's got,

B.117:  It must have, uh, what's his name in it. 

A.118:  No. 

B.119:  No it doesn't,

A.120:  No. 

B.121:  Really. 

A.122:  Uh, Hogan?

B.123:  Yeah, Paul Hogan. 

A.124:  No,

B.125:  #No, really, I'm surprised.#

A.126:  #no it's got, uh,# uh, Cheech ((Marin)).

B.127:  Oh really, [laughter]  that must be pretty good then, was it good. 

A.128:  Yeah, it is, it's kind of, uh, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in
reverse. 

B.129:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.130:  But it was kind of cute.  Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS?

B.131:  Yes, yes. 

A.132:  I though that was a really cute movie, #I enjoyed that.# 

B.133:  #Yeah, it was.# TWINS was good too, because when I thought of that, I
thought of, [laughter] anyway.  Um, oh, there was another one, what's the one
that just, oh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet?

A.134:  No, I haven't. 

B.135:  Oh, you've got to see that one, it's really,

A.136:  I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of
home video [throat_clearing]. 

B.137:  Right, that's probably true, that's probably true.  It's, it's very, very
good.  Very good. 

A.138:  #Yeah.#

B.139:  #That's# another one that, I was really glad when it won all those awards
because it really deserved it. 

A.140:  Well my wife, uh, has got a, uh, a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed
it.  It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES. 

B.141:  Really. 

A.142:  Yeah, and he signed it.  He, he happens to be, uh, a friend of one of her,
her business associates. 

B.143:  Oh, wow, that's impressive. 

A.144:  And, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin. 

B.145:  #Oh, neat.#

A.146:  #So, uh,# uh, but anyhow we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, picture and it came
in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES so we've got to, uh, try to get
out there and see that one.

B.147:  Oh, yeah, it's really worth it.  I mean it's a very good movie and yes, I
would suggest seeing it at the theater.  I know that they're still playing it
and they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until like August,

A.148:  Huh. 

B.149:  I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in
July and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August,
{pause} so.  But, yeah, that one is definitely worth seeing, it's really good. 

A.150:  Now did you see, uh, DRIVING MISS DAISY?

B.151:  Yeah, and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good. 

A.152:  Okay. 

B.153:  You know, I guess it was okay, I mean it was all right, but, um, when I
compare like the winners of this year and last year, it just, I don't know. 
Maybe, it's, it's not,
