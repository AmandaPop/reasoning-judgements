REMARKS:        Speaker B spoke very rapidly and was difficult to understand.
Where both spoke at once, it was not always possible to determine what
was said.

============================================================================

A.1:  The, uh, whole savings and loan thing seems to be, uh, a bit of a system
whereby the [sigh], the natural human greed was able to flourish.  And some
people were able to do some things that, that, uh, they felt that since the
government was backing them, they could, just, uh, go ahead and make these
transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were.  And it
was rather difficult to catch all, if, if any of the people that were really
responsible for it.  And even those who were caught didn't seem to get, get
much in the way of punishment, as far as getting, uh, restitution made.  So,

B.2:  #Yeah, I think the,#

A.3:  #it seems like, a,# a really set up.  You know the whole thing was set up
to, to be abused.  And so,

B.4:  Oh, yeah. 

A.5:  Human nature did so. 

B.6:  Yeah, I think the government is it's own worst enemy.  About the time it
was all going on, they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to
stimulate the economy.  And plus they had cut back on the way of government
regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry.  And,
uh, I think the whole economic situation was set up to, uh, put the savings
and loans in the position they were in.  And they need the banks too.  Uh,
economically we had gotten into pretty unsound conditions, and so the idea of
trying to make the money supply good and loose, via whatever medium, whether
it be savings and loans or banks, either one, was the order of the day.
[throat_clearing] So needless to say, they did.  And, uh, since they didn't
really regulate it well or watch it well, uh, by cutting back on, uh,
government, uh, uh, uh, monitoring in that respect.  Then it did get out of
hand, and you're right, you're absolutely right.  There were some people who
saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it.  And, uh,
because of it, you and I are the main taxpayers now, are going to have to pay
not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made, but we're going
to have to pay for the, uh, mistakes in the, uh, uh, taking advantage of the
system to some of these, well, really when you get right down to it, crooks,
uh, uh, took advantage of the system with.  And, yeah, they've seem to caught
a few.  I, I've heard on T V  or read in, uh, the newspaper about a couple
of these guys.  I forget the, the name of one of them, but I heard that they
did, uh, [throat_clearing] prosecute him and maybe a couple of others.  I
think you all had a major crisis down there in Texas, right?

A.7:  Yeah.  there were quite a few down here.  Mainly by, just because of the
sheer numbers that were here and, you know,

B.8:  #Um.#

A.9:  #the,# and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of
the sheer population of them being,

B.10:  #[Throat_clearing].#

A.11:  #here.# And the whole problem seemed to start, start toward, uh, uh, not
that California was the instigator of it, but it seemed to start out that way,
and,

B.12:  #Yeah.#

A.13:  #then,# then work its way here.  And it wasn't, kind of funny that it
wasn't a national problem until it hit the east coast.  You know, when,

B.14:  Yeah, that's always interesting, isn't it? See, he's right. 

A.15:  it started hitting the big New York banks and the up-,

B.16:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.17:  #New York,# then it became a nationwide problem, and Congress got to do
something.  But, uh, Texas, is on, basically on the way to recovery as far as,
uh, the banking industry goes.  And, uh,

B.18:  Oh, I'm glad to hear that because I've been concerned that the banks may be
going the same direction that the savings and loans.  Primarily because, uh,
what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's
beginning to get the banks in trouble.  [throat_clearing] And that was, uh,
the real estate, uh, backing in investment and just building, in general,
backing contractors and those kinds of, uh, corporations, uh, who were trying
to build a lot of, uh, uh, rental business space and, uh, mall type space and
things like that.  And, uh, it looked like in the seventies, that that was
going to be a real booming thing, uh, ad in finitum, I guess.

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  And, uh, anybody if they would just stop and use a little common sense
would realize well you can't soak up this much real estate, uh, and continue
to have this kind of growth indefinitely.  I mean, you, you, it's, it's like
anything, you eventually reach sort of a plateau where, you've overbuilt if
you're not careful.

A.21:  Right. 

B.22:  Uh, and, uh, it, it's as if, uh, they went crazy.  Just, just like in
gambling almost. 

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  And th-, there was no regulation or anything like that, uh.  I, I, frankly,
though, uh, uh, I'm glad to hear you say, what you said about Texas, because I
have been concerned that the banking system, uh, which is going through some
economic difficulty now,

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  #and# with all the foreign investments that they, uh, put money into
also.  [throat_clearing]  I, I've been concerned that the banking system is
going to find itself in dire straits.  Or, if they even didn't find themselves
in dire straits, we're going to find ourselves with so much of our money, uh,
lent out to foreign owners, who are willing to soak up some of this, this, uh,
capital to keep us afloat, you might say, hoping to make a buck off of us in
interest in the future.  But, uh, we find our own econom-, economy, even though
it may not have slipped into so-, so, some kind of either deflationary or
inflationary depression, uh, we find ourselves having sold out our futures in
terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign
investors who have the money to build, to buy up all the debt. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  And, uh, I'm glad to hear that you, do you know, uh, how, uh, they're
beginning to get over the ((fleet)) in Texas? Are, are, is a lot of the money
in loans and, and the like that, uh, uh, is that being covered by foreign
investments, maybe or, uh, uh?

A.29:  Well, part of the problem, as I see it, uh,

B.30:  #[Throat_clearing].#

A.31:  #my# family's involved in, in both industries as it were.  I've, I've,

B.32:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

A.33:  #got, uh,# grandfather that was in the S and L's back in the sixties and
the seventies.  And,

B.34:  #I see.#

A.35:  #in another# part of Texas, and in a, uh, my immediate parents were both
in banking, as it were.  And so, uh, we've, we've kept up with the industry as
it were.  And,

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#

A.37:  #the,# the feeling has been, in some of the discussions that, that get
started on that topic, has been that, you know, we went through the, the bad
times of a number of bad loans and fortunately the, the banks and the S and
L -s, that, uh, our family were associated with, really didn't have that much
problem.  They were fairly conservative and,

B.38:  #Uh-huh.#

A.39:  #they# just had to ride out the storm with the, the reputational problems
that came with the,

B.40:  #Yeah.#

A.41:  #news# media, as it were and, uh, there were a number of banks that made
the bad loans.  And basically it's been a good weeding out process.  There's
just been a lot of people, a lot of banks, a lot of whole organizations that
were going to make these kinds of loans, and, and they are no longer in
business.  Uh, so, you know, you, you have some, all your bank failures that
the government's having to take over, you know, that's gone up in the hundred
and, twenty or thirty or so,

B.42:  #Yeah,#

A.43:  #for# the state. 

B.44:  it's been quite a few every year. 

A.45:  Yeah, and that's pretty well leveled off and, and, uh, that's,

B.46:  Well, do you think maybe it's peaked, you think?

A.47:  Yeah,

B.48:  #Yeah.#

A.49:  #yeah,# I don't think there's going to be that many more of them.  I, I
would,

B.50:  So, y-, y-, y-, you would, uh, predict, based on at least your knowledge
and experience, that in time we'll see the numbers of banks and maybe savings
and loans too, if they're still failing, uh, that, that, that, the, the number
beginning to sort of taper off now.  Instead of a hundred to two hundred a
year, you begin to see it go down to maybe fifty to a hundred a year,

A.51:  #Right.#

B.52:  #and# maybe,

A.53:  #Right, there's just,#

B.54:  #What kind of,#

A.55:  not that many,

B.56:  time fr-, time frame would you, guess that's going to take, to wring
itself out?

A.57:  Well, it's hard to say, how many more bad, bad systems or bad apples there
are out in the system.  But, I would, I would be willing to bet, that, uh, it
shouldn't be more than a couple more years.  That, that,

B.58:  Oh, you think two years? I, I would have guessed five to ten but,

A.59:  #Well the,#

B.60:  #you wouldn't# think two years. 

A.61:  As far as, as far as, not having this, getting over this peak, as it is,
uh,

B.62:  #Uh-huh.#

A.63:  #there's# still going to be an unusual, you know, it depends on how far
back you want to go.  Let's say if you went back ten years, and said here's a
failure rate we could live with.  Well, then it may take us three to five years
to get back to that level of,

B.64:  #Oh, okay.#

A.65:  #failure.  But# if you want to just say, we're over the hump and we're
starting to get better, I think in a couple of years, it'll be quite obvious
that we're over the hump and getting better. 

B.66:  Well, tell me, all this, all these bad loans and debts that, uh, I, I know
in the case of the savings and loans, we're just going to have to pick it up as
American taxpayer. 

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  But even the banks and the likes, some, some of those are merging and, uh,
uh, the, the basic question I'm trying to get to is, all this bad money that's
essentially not going to get paid back, how's it going to get covered?

A.69:  I'm not sure if, uh [sigh], 

B.70:  I mean, is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it
we're going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to
sell some of these bad loans or pick them up some how or another? Uh, uh, by
foreign investors, uh, buying pieces of our, our economy, like buying some of
our, ((been to some of our)) banks? Uh, like the things that, uh, I forget the
guy's name downtown here, uh, was involved in, those two banks.  I think that
was in Georgia or someplace.  Uh, what, what, what, how do see that this, this
indebtedness, of which is bad loans and the like, just not going to get paid
back, at least by the people who caused the debt? Uh, you, you can't just
write that off, completely.  You can write off a certain part of it, I guess.

A.71:  Right. 

B.72:  But you just can't just write off the whole.  Somewhere along the line,
you've got to recoup some of that money, some of the, even if it's twenty-five
to fifty cents on the dollar.  Ha-, how's that going to happen?
[throat_clearing].

A.73:  Well, like one guy I heard just talking, earlier this week on the topic,
was saying, that, that there wasn't any one given, uh, you know, sort of like,
uh, uh, s-, guy making a, uh, suit for you.  It, it's custom made to the
individual situation.  If you, you don't try to find, well, write off all
these to the government, or have, have, the, the entire, uh, bank failure
covered by the government.  So you, you take each individual situation, yeah,
and if you can find a foreign investor, or if you can find any investor
that'll, that'll fine this, I guess that's what the majority of the, uh, R T
C -s doing.  Is,

B.74:  #Uh-huh.#

A.75:  #trying# to, to resolve all these individual cases in any way possible.  I
mean, they're looking for,

B.76:  How good a job do you think they're doing? Because, you know, there's been
quite a bit in the various news magazines up here, and even the Washington
Post and various places, about, uh, how they felt that the, uh, the people on
the committee, were sort of selling out at, uh, ex-, exorbitantly low prices
to some rather astute investors.  Some of this had been misinter-, who were
tending the, who were really tend to make the nice killing off that.  How do
you, do you feel about that?

A.77:  Well, I was, I was talking with another gentleman about that same topic. 
It's hard to get a feel for what's going on in a nationwide, uh, system like
that, when the news media reports the segments that they report.  You know, you
hear,

B.78:  Yeah, mainly they look for the, the wild news. 

A.79:  Yeah, you hear things, like, uh,
