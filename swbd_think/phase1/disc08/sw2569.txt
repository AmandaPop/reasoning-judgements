===========================================================================

A.1:  W-, well, do you like to do your yard work?

B.2:  Yeah, this is actually a duplex that we're in,

A.3:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.4:  # so, # and it's rented. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  We're looking into buying a house, but, um, the landlord is supposed to do
the yard work, although he doesn't do it any frequency.  Every once in a while
he comes around.  So, in the meantime, we have our own lawn mower and we
probably do it a little more than him. 

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  But we don't do a whole lot since it's a rental property.  We've added a
few things like around the patio and I've tried to get a few shrubs to grow
around here but since it's, you know, rental we haven't spent a whole lot of
time and effort in trying to do landscaping.  We just kind of maintain what's
here and mow the grass and trim and that kind of stuff, when it's needed.

A.9:  Oh great, what kind of lawn do you have?

B.10:  You mean the type of grass?

A.11:  Yeah. 

B.12:  [TV]  Um, what kind of a grass we have? [talking]  {to someone else in the
room who answers back Saint Augustine in the front} Oh, Saint Augustine, yeah,
it's [talking] {background voice says Bermuda in the back} Bermuda in the
back. 

A.13:  Oh. 

B.14:  It's the kind that has those, you know, grows sideways. 

A.15:  It grows in runners, right, right. 

B.16:  Yeah, that stuff. 

A.17:  I just love that.  In the middle of the summer, when that gets real thick,
that's so nice to walk on, isn't it. 

B.18:  Well, the problem has been in the winter of, um,

A.19:  # Yeah, two winters ago.  #

B.20:  # eighty-nine, yeah.  A lot # of it got zapped,

A.21:  # Yeah.  #

B.22:  # and # it's, it's slow coming back.  Like our landlord didn't really
replant any. 

A.23:  # Yeah.  #

B.24:  # Last # year a lot of the front lawn looks pretty bad. 

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  And he didn't redo anything so it's, it's coming back a little bit now. 

A.27:  Well, you know, you know, mine did, and it was late, at this time last
year, I held out no hope for it.  But I watered and fertilized the hell out of
it and I, by July and August, it was as strong and thick as it had ever been.

B.28:  # Oh really.  #

A.29:  # And, uh, # and of course, this year it never really died out that much.
I mean, this year, here it is only April and it's looking good.

B.30:  # It was very mild, mild winter, yeah [TV].  #

A.31:  # Yeah, we had, we had a mild winter.  # We-, you know, everybody in my
neighborhood hires their yard work done and I think, I think the fun of owning
a house is doing the yard work.  And I mean I thought so, I've owned a house
for m-, twenty-five of the, of the thirty-two years that I've been here in
Dallas.

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  And I just enjoy it so much.  And, uh, and, and particularly the lawn, I
love it d-, I love to see it get a deep dark green. 

B.34:  # Uh-huh [breathing].  #

A.35:  # I love # to, uh, I, I love to mow it.  I don't like weeding the flower
beds around the house and my son's supposed to do that,

B.36:  # Um, #

A.37:  # but # pre-, every once and a while they get ahead of him [laughter]  so I
end up doing that for him and, and my wife sometimes takes care of the flowers
and so between us, we got all our own little things to do. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  And we go-, we got two girls off in college they don't do anything. 

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  But, uh, I, uh, and I love to be out in the summertime, I love to be out
when the sun is really nice and hot and just go out there and sweat a bit
mowing the lawn.

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  I just love it.  In fact, I, uh, mow my lawn, but there's a gigantic vacant
field in back of us, uh, that belongs to Richland College,

B.44:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.45:  # and # everybody that we have that backs up to it, mows about, uh, oh,
maybe ten or fifteen or twenty yards into the vacant lot,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # to # keep weeds from growing and coming over and seeding in your yard. 
So, so we all even get more, u-, get more lawn to mow that way.  But, uh, it's
fun. 

B.48:  Do you back up to it on the south side or the east side. 

A.49:  Uh, I am on the east side of Richland,

B.50:  # Oh.  #

A.51:  # in # fac-, so Richland's on my west side.  When I look out my back door
to see the sun set, I look across the Richland field.

B.52:  Oh, okay. 

A.53:  Okay and,

B.54:  Because we had one of our, uh, a person si-, similar stature to (( )) from
the legal department, Mel Sharp.  He lives around in that area too, he lives on
Whiteman Place, I think. 

A.55:  Okay, I, I live on Wharton Drive. 

B.56:  Okay. 

A.57:  And Wharton intersects, uh, uh, it dead ends into Chimney Hill. 

B.58:  Yeah, yeah, okay. 

A.59:  And then it, it dead ends, just dead ends up here where I live [laughter].

B.60:  # Okay.  #

A.61:  # It # runs, uh, it runs north and south from Chimney Hill north. 

B.62:  Um. 

A.63:  Uh, anyway, I love to do that and the other thing that I love is that I am
a distance runner by hobby.

B.64:  Oh. 

A.65:  And some nights I'll come home from work like I did last night and with
rain in the forecast and the lawn was getting pretty high, I said I got to mow
the lawn, but I want to go out and run.  Now, which do I do first?

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  And I'm sitting around thinking well if I go out and run now, because I
messed around until almost sev-, uh, six thirty or so, if I go out and run now,
I'm going to get back and I'm going to be mowing the lawn and it's going to get
dark and I'm going to have to guess where, where the line is to mow. 

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  So, if I mow now then I'll go out and run afterwards.  And what the mowing
does, it limbers you up, so that you go out and have a good run.  I finished up
right at about dark and then I went out and ran four and a half miles, and it
was great. 

B.70:  # Wow.  #

A.71:  # Just # because the mowing, it, i-, I don't, I didn't, I don't have to do
any stretching before running if I've been pushing the lawn mower around for an
hour, for an hour and ten minutes or so. 

B.72:  [Laughter]. 

A.73:  So that's just, you know, I just, I, I, I just really enjoy it and I hate
to he-, see people gripe and moan about doing, uh, yard work.  What about
trees, do you have any trees around?

B.74:  We got a couple of big trees, out front,

A.75:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.76:  # um, I # guess right along our street there used to be one of the, um,
lines, I guess there was fields here many, many years ago, cotton fields or
something and,

A.77:  You bet, and I remember that. 

B.78:  Yeah, well we have a lot of trees that, that go across our front yards,

A.79:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.80:  # that are # very old that must have been like where the line was in
between the fields.

A.81:  # Where the fence was or something, yeah.  #

B.82:  # So we have a couple of huge # trees out front.  That's pretty nice, no
trees really in the back. 

A.83:  How, how, how long have you live there Maureen?

B.84:  Almost two years. 

A.85:  Oh, do you have children?

B.86:  No, not yet. 

A.87:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.88:  # We've only # been married two years. 

A.89:  Oh, okay, okay.  Because you've got a, a excellent elementary school over
there.  Uh, our middle daughter went over there one year while ours was being
built here. 

B.90:  Oh. 

A.91:  And, uh, Richland Park is just a super neat school. 

B.92:  # Oh.  #

A.93:  # And # they got a lot of neat programs.  The, uh, uh, how often do you,
when, when the, when the, uh, growing season's good, how often do you have to
mow your lawn?

B.94:  Uh, nearly every week. 

A.95:  Yeah, yeah, I got, I got so carried away with water and fertilizer last
year in, uh, June, July, and the first part of August I was mowing every four
days.

B.96:  [Laughter]. 

A.97:  And I talked to my parents, I'm from Massachusetts originally,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # and # I talked to my parents on the phone, I said, you know, we Texans
are a funny breed, [barking] we, we wa-, we water, we spend hundreds of
dollars a month during the dry part of July, August watering our lawn.  We go
out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch
and gripe about having to mow it so often [laughter].

B.100:  [Laughter]. 

A.101:  We (( )) because we Massachusetters weren't like that.  We never did
anything to it except mow it.  And, and it always looked nice. 

B.102:  Yeah, that's right, we never did this watering stuff, everybody waters. 

A.103:  Yeah we didn't do all that stuff here.  But they get more natural rain than
we do.  You know, we get so much rain in the Spring and then we go sometimes
entire June, July and August without any. 

B.104:  # Yeah.  #

A.105:  # So, # I guess we're, where are you from originally?

B.106:  Uh, Philadelphia area. 

A.107:  Oh, okay, so you've been in Texas how long?

B.108:  Eight years. 

A.109:  Oh, we-, you're, you're almost a Texan.  I've been here thirty-two years. 

B.110:  That's a long time. 

A.111:  Yeah, thirty-two years and my wife's a Texan, so of co-, naturally my
children. 

B.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.113:  # But # they still think I'm a Yankee [laughter]. 

B.114:  [Laughter]  And I was never called that until I came here. 

A.115:  Yeah, isn't that funny, I wasn't either, I have, uh,

B.116:  And I, I was just taken aback by that. 

A.117:  Yeah, when I got here my, uh, uh, best friend who was my office mate when I
first ((got)) here in nineteen fifty-nine said the only Yankees he could ever
stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball.

B.118:  [Laughter]. 

A.119:  But, but people weren't as mobile then as they are now.  I mean I will bet
half of your neighborhood, or three quarters of it, and I know it's true with
ours, is not from Dallas, is not even from Texas. 

B.120:  Well, I keep reminding these people that it's good thing we came down here
and got some changes made, like shopping on Sunday. 

A.121:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.122:  # I said # it's a little hard to do everything on Saturday.  No pass, no
play, uh, kind of thing. 

A.123:  # Yeah.  #

B.124:  # I # said, you know we had that for years in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

A.125:  Uh, i-, yeah, that's true, that's true, we did, we did.  And, uh, do you
all, do you all, uh, do you all have to water a lot over there. 

B.126:  [Breathing]  Uh, pretty much and our landlord, always asks us to, uh,
continue doing that,

A.127:  # Yeah.  #

B.128:  # even # though we pay for the water because of, you know, foundation
problems,

A.129:  Oh, yeah because of the foundation problem.  You know that's an interesting
thing.  I've had two overseas assignments with T I. 

B.130:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.131:  # Uh, # I was in, uh, Malaysia eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, and
eighty-four, and I was in the Philippines eighty-five, eighty-six and
eighty-seven and I had two different tenants.  And my first one kept the inside
of the house nice.  This is a two story five bedroom. 

B.132:  Uh-huh. 

A.133:  And, uh, uh, they only lived in the downstairs because he was divorced and
had two children and they only visited him one weekend a month. 

B.134:  Um. 

A.135:  And (( )) was the only time the upstairs wa-, so the upstairs looked as new
as we left, uh, they only lived downstairs. 

B.136:  [Laughter]. 

A.137:  Uh, and, and his wife was an interior decorator and the house was just kept
very nice.  You know, I've, I've heard horror stories from other T I -ers that
have had tenants.  But, he didn't like yard work. 

B.138:  # Um.  #

A.139:  # And # what happened was the Saint Augustine grew up, you know, if you
don't watch it and keep it trimmed back, it will totally take over your flower
beds. 

B.140:  Oh, yeah. 

A.141:  Well when we came back, what used to be our flower beds were solid Saint
Augustine [laughter]. 

B.142:  Oh.  

A.143:  We had to, we had to dig it out [laughter].  And the second tenant, when we
went to the Philippines, the second tenant, he had two little girls.

B.144:  Uh-huh. 

A.145:  And so they lived throughout the entire house.  He also had a dog in the
house, that I didn't know about,

B.146:  # Um.  #

A.147:  # and # so our carpeting was in bad shape when I got back, but, uh, my yard
was immaculate.  He did a great job on the yard so, yo-,

B.148:  # [Laughter].  #

A.149:  # so, # I guess you can't have everything. 

B.150:  [Laughter]. 

A.151:  But, but, you're right and I guess that's very important because of this
black earth with have here that cracks terribly. 

B.152:  # Yeah.  #

A.153:  # Uh, # and it shifts badly in the summertime.  That, uh, if you don't
water around the foundation, you're going to lose it.  And, uh, and boy, I'll
tell you, you've really got to have a conscientious tenant and it's hard for
him to be conscientious when he's thinking of paying a hundred dollar water
bill, uh, every, uh, uh, i-, you know, every month when you get into the June,
July and August time period.

B.154:  Yeah. 

A.155:  And, how, how big is your duplex. 

B.156:  Um, each side has three bedrooms and two baths,

A.157:  # Oh, okay they're, they're fairly big.  #

B.158:  # living room and then a big, # uh, kitchen that has, uh, dining area in
it.

A.159:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.160:  So, each side is like seventeen hundred square feet. 

A.161:  Yeah, yeah, well, wh-, uh, where did you go to school?

B.162:  Uh, Ohio State. 

A.163:  Oh, you went to Ohio State.  Oh, you're, uh, up in the Woody Hays country,
huh. 

B.164:  Right, and I was, I was going to school in his prime back when we had
Archie Griffin, and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose
Bowl, that was when I was going to school there.

A.165:  Yeah, yeah.  We were really excited about the we're,
