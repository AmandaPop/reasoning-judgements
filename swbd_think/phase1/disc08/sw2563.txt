REMARKS:        Speaker B sounded very muffled and was extremely difficult
to understand, especially during the actual conversation.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Crime in the cities, and I guess in some of the rural areas, too, seems to
be going up.  I don't know it'll go down on any steady basis.  More people,
more opportunities and somewhat of a lessened, uh, sensitivity toward it.
It's almost, um, you know, it's almost expected that that's going to occur.
It's not quite the shock any more, especially the so-called littler,

B.2:  [Throat_clearing].

A.3:  things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few
supplies or the whole defense industry's had some problems in that realm, even
the C E O -s tend to steal a little of that here and there, and then you get
into whole areas of crime, like drug usage and organized crime.  And as far as
steps to reduce it, uh, I'm not sure that there's anything that hasn't been
tried, we might ought to come up with something new if we could, but can't
keep throwing money at it, and,

B.4:  Well, you mentioned one of my pet buzz words there which is sensitivity to
it, and particularly violence.  I, uh, really get, uh, ticked off with, uh,
seeing this violence, so much of it on T V and so forth in the movies.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I think that, uh, it does goes a lot toward, uh, you know, like you say,
gives people a, kind of a, makes them insensitive to it, and {pause},

A.7:  Yeah, it's hard to judge (( )) just thinking back, I don't seem to recall
my growing up days, I'm only thirty-three, but, it, looking back on the years
that I played with other kids, we only played so-called war, you know, a few
times and, 

B.8:  Cowboys and Indians in (( )) [Laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, that kind of deal as opposed to, to, uh, having, shooting giant
cannons and all the kind of warfare that kids are playing with today.  You
know, they turn the stick into a cannon instead of a simple little gun.

B.10:  I think kids are the answer.  That's, uh, that's where our, uh, hopefully
the cure lies, if there, you know, is to be one.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Get uh, get the schools, uh, corrected, to, to some extent.

A.13:  There is another angle that I started seeing as the Polish situation and
some of the Soviet, uh, countries as it were, as they started coming into the
news and you started hearing about some of their troubles and the like, and
some of their, their crime problems.  It made me wonder just how the outlook
of the future affects people's decisions to either commit crimes or [Static]
how they live or whatever.  Uh, it seems like they, the poorer the situation
or the poorer the outlook, the more likely they are to commit a crime.
[Static]

B.14:  Yeah, I think, uh, [Throat_clearing] if you got, that's of course, I guess,
one of the root causes is the have nots or the people that are without
[Static] you know, while that's not, of course that's not the total thing, but
that'd explain a lot of it, and then, uh, I guess the drug thing is really
[Breathing] become a, an engine for crime here lately.

A.15:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, it feeds it by itself.  Not only does it make
the person stagnant and not very capable of social progress in the realm of,
uh, earning a living in the way that the norm is, but it, makes for a habit
that has to be supported at a rate --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- that, uh, can't be supported by, uh, that person as far as working goes.
I mean, you can't be that much into drugs and still hold a job capable of
paying for that much drugs.  So --

B.18:  Uh-huh

A.19:  -- it's a vicious circle in and off itself.  There's really, uh, I don't
know, a bit of an eye-opener, I guess, even to see some of the, the portions
of the United States that are becoming depressed economically and to see that
the high schoolers that are coming out of school, why even for the past two to
three years, uh, there's nothing for them.  You know, a lot of these rural
areas, college wasn't even a consideration for the majority of them.  They
kind of were confident that they could just move right on into industry, and
industry's gone from a lot of these areas, and there's nothing to go into.

B.20:  [Throat_clearing]

A.21:  So they still feel trapped and feel, you know, they were looking forward to
getting out on their own and getting away from whatever, uh, family problems
they had, and so they just turned to whatever, be it drugs or be it crime or
some way to make the money to get away from the situation they're in.

B.22:  Yeah, I'd agree with that.

A.23:  I guess that's not going to do anything but spread as, as, uh, economic
hardships spread and so will the crimes of that age group, I guess.  I've got
a, a brother-in-law that's on the police force and his, uh, wife is a, uh,
nurse in an emergency room, and boy when they come home from work together,

B.24:  [Laughter]

A.25:  they have the worst stories to share.  I mean, we spent a week with them
down in Corpus Christi, and just the things that they have to, you know Spring
Break's a big deal, and, and, uh, he was telling me that he had to be on the
scene of an accident where five teenagers, all of the them st-, drunk,
collided head on and every single one of them died --

B.26:  Um.

A.27:  -- three in one car and two in another.  

B.28:  Huh.

A.29:  And, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the ones that were half alive that
they rushed to the hospital, she got to work on, and she got to see them die.
And they just get all the world's worst situations.  Very few rewarding
situations.

B.30:  [Laughter]  That's got to be a, a grim --

A.31:  Grim family, yeah.

B.32:  -- grim supper topic.

A.33:  Yeah, and they, fortunately they have some success stories to share, and I
try to tell them to dwell on those.  I can't see how they can both stand, uh,
to live that way.  But they don't see much hope for, neither one of them sees
any real solution to the, to the problems.

B.34:  It's got to be frustrating as hell for a, particularly a cop.  You know,
they, uh, they go out and [Throat_clearing] make the arrests and I guess, with
the jails crowded the way they are, before they can get the paperwork
finished, huh, they're releasing them or they're releasing somebody just like
them, you know, it's a revolving door that --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- has to be, uh, just, uh, beat your head against the wall frustration.

A.37:  Yeah, I meant to ask him the last time I was talking with him if, uh, if
there are any circumstances under which they suspend the normal paperwork for
just even a minor wreck because numerous times there have been just a two car
or three car incident and he starts his paperwork when he gets there and then
by the time they all cleared out and gone, he's still sitting there doing
paperwork on this deal.  I said, Wonder what those California officers do when
they have those twenty and thirty car pileups on the highway.  It'd take a
whole army of officers just to do the paperwork.

B.38:  Well, uh, I know that, uh, minor wrecks don't require, uh, police here.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  You just exchange your insurance --

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  -- information.  

A.43:  It just be up to something, I guess, that was big enough to call them out
for.  Well I got one, one kid needing me, so I'll see if we get together again
sometime.

B.44:  Okay.

A.45:  Nice talking to you.

B.46:  Nice talking to you.

A.47:  Bye.

B.48:  Bye-bye.
