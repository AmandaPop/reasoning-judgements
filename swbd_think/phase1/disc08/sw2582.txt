A.1:  [T V] Hi, Rick.  How you doing?

B.2:  Pretty good.

A.3:  You say you live in your own home or you do not?

B.4:  No, I don't.  I'm, uh, renting a townhouse right now.

A.5:  Uh-huh [static].

B.6:  But I'm moving, uh, the end of May.  I'm going to move into renting a
house.

A.7:  Wow.  #I've, I've# --

B.8:  #I'm, uh# ...

A.9:  -- never heard of that before.

B.10:  Well, actually, this will be {sounds like his mouth is full} the second
time I've done it.  #I'm, uh# --

A.11:  #How does# ...

B.12:  -- in grad school right now. 

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And on my kind of salary, you just [laughter] it's kind of hard to come up
with money [bell] to make a house payment [cough].

A.15:  Well, I, I'll bet you end up spending more money renting a house than you
would if you put a down payment on it and #uh# ...

B.16:  #Yeah.#  Well down payment is a tough problem I guess.

A.17:  [Laughter] Yeah, if you can get by that hurdle.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  I can remember when I, uh, when I brought my house.  I needed help.  
#Uh# --

B.20:  #Yeah.#

A.21:  -- and my folks helped me out to get started.  And now my rent, uh, well my
mortgage if you will, is, uh, cheaper than, uh, you know, one room, uh,

B.22:  [Click].

A.23:  apartments.  

B.24:  Well, I don't know.  You're in Massachusetts.  I think the, the market is
a little bit different here.

A.25:  It's a lot cheaper in, uh, in, uh, Texas?

B.26:  [Throat_clearing] Oh, no.  I'm in, I'm in Raleigh, North #Carolina.#

A.27:  #Oh,# North Carolina.  

B.28:  Yeah.  Uh, [swallowing] it's probably, what I'm paying now for an apartment
is six twenty-five.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And this, this house we're moving into is only five hundred dollars a month.

A.31:  So you'll actually be saving money.  

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  How about the utilities for the, uh, for the house that you're in now?

B.34:  Well, the one now is, is, uh, it's got a heat pump.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  So it's, it's kin- I mean it's not that cold in Raleigh in the wintertime
but I mean, the air conditioning is probably your biggest threat.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And the new place doesn't have air conditioning and has gas heating.  So
it's going to be [swallowing], I know it's going to be cheaper #[laughter].#

A.39:  #[Laughter].#

B.40:  #Maybe hotter but# ...

A.41:  #[Laughter]# I, I, uh, probably make you sick if I told you what my, uh, my
mortgage is #with, with the taxes.#

B.42:  #[Laughter] Yeah,# I can imagine.  I know how things are up there.  

A.43:  I'm paying, uh, two hundred and thirty dollars a month.

B.44:  What?

A.45:  [Laughter] With taxes.  

B.46:  What?

A.47:  [Laughter] I #bought# ...

B.48:  #You have# some kind of deal.

A.49:  No.  No deal.  It, when I bought my home, 

B.50:  [Clinking].

A.51:  uh, twenty-five years ago, it was #it's very expensive.#

B.52:  #Oh, ((oh))# twenty-five years ago.  #Okay {mispronounced}. Yeah, that
ma-,# ...

A.53:  #Yeah.  I'm an old,# I'm an old guy [laughter].

B.54:  Well, that makes it more (( )).  My parents have the same kind of deal too.

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  They've had their house that #long.#

A.57:  #Well# it works that way with, uh, with anybody who buys.  It's very
difficult when you first buy your house, #uh# --

B.58:  #Yeah.#

A.59:  -- ((but once)) {mispronounced} but once you do that and hang on to it,
you'd be surprised what inflation does to, uh --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- to the housing market.  And even though we're in a slump right now, it's
not going to last forever.  It's going to catch up sooner or later.  #And# --

B.62:  #Yeah.#

A.63:  -- uh, you g-, you got to live in a house some day.  Uh ...

B.64:  Yeah.  See the problem I have now is, uh, I, I want mobile because I'm not
really sure what is going to happen a year from now.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  I've moved like three times in the last two years [click].

A.67:  When you rent the home, do they, uh, force you to lease and #guarantee
payment?#

B.68:  #Uh#, yeah, they usually do put a, a year lease on it.  

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  I was living in Colorado and I didn't have a lease which was really nice
[clicking].  #But I# --

A.71:  #[Barking] Well, the, the lease# ...

B.72:  -- just kind of a verbal agreement.  Yeah, I'm going to stay a year and --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- I'll be nice to you [laughter] #if you'll be nice to me [static] [door].#

A.75:  #The, the lease can work,# uh, work two ways.  It can work to your benefit
too.

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  #Where,# uh, they can't increase your, your rent, uh, if something goes
wrong with, with a written lease,

B.78:  [Thumping].  

A.79:  But with an oral #lease [static]# --

B.80:  #Yeah.#

A.81:  -- they can.  So it works both ways.

B.82:  [Noise] {sounds like water} Yeah.  Huh.  Well, what would you suggest.
Think it would be a good idea even I think I might be moving, to buy a house
[thumping] [door].

A.83:  W-, buying a house is, is, should be your ultimate goal.

B.84:  [Thumping] [rustling].  

A.85:  Because you're going to have to live somewhere.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  And, uh, even if, uh, [static] if you hang on to it for five years.  Put a
little bit of, uh, uh, money into it, you're going to get it back again,

B.88:  [Talking].  

A.89:  #with, uh# --

B.90:  #Okay.#

A.91:  -- with (( )).  Just like putting money in a bank.  It's #((for-,))# --

B.92:  #Yeah.#

A.93:  -- forced savings [throat_clearing].

B.94:  [Talking] [/rustling].  

A.95:  If, uh, [rustling] --

B.96:  Yeah [clanking].

A.97:  -- you know, living in a house is something you're going to have to do
[laughter] #whether# --

B.98:  #Yeah.#

A.99:  -- you, you're doing it alone.  Whether you're doing it with a, with a, a
partner or #you're going to have to, you know.#

B.100:  #Yeah. See I'm single now# and, and, see I may be going back and
getting a P H D.

A.101:  Uh-huh [rustling].

B.102:  And I know [laughter] I can't afford a house {mispronounced} if I'm going
to be doing that [laughter].

A.103:  You, you sound like a young guy and, and, uh ...

B.104:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm twenty-five.  

A.105:  All right.  When I was, uh, in my early twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two
years old, I was working for a, a guy in a gas station.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  And he tried to convince me to buy this single family house that he saw for
sale. And #uh#

B.108:  #Huh# [talking] [noise].

A.109:  e-, the price will sound odd because it was, uh, you know, about
thirty years ago, but it, they wanted, uh, forty-nine hundred dollars for it.

B.110:  Wow.

A.111:  And the, buying a house was the last thing that I wanted to do.  

B.112:  Yeah [noise].

A.113:  So I didn't buy it.  And I'm sorry now.  #Because I# --

B.114:  #But you wish you did.#

A.115:  -- I, you know, I wasted a lot of money.  Uh, when you're twenty,
twenty-one, twenty-two years old --

B.116:  [Noise] [talking] paying it on rent.

A.117:  -- you, you throw it away.  You, 

B.118:  [laughter] {background}.

A.119:  and I wasn't paying rent, I was living at home.  #But, uh, but, you know# --

B.120:  #Oh.  Well that's the ideal thing [laughter].#

A.121:  -- [laughter] I was throwing my money away.  #With ((but))# --

B.122:  #((Oh, I'm just))# ...

A.123:  -- on girls, #cars# --

B.124:  #Yeah.#

A.125:  -- you know, [laughter] typical things #[laughter].#

B.126:  #Yeah.  I had to waste a lot of money on my car.# That was the biggest
mistake I ever bought [snorting].

A.127:  [Throat_clearing] You buy a car, it depreciates.  You buy a home and #it
inpreciates. It, it, it# ...

B.128:  #I know [laughter].  It was the stupidest thing.#  Why didn't someone tell
me that #[laughter].#

A.129:  #[Laughter].# 

B.130:  [Squeak].

A.131:  You, you buy a car, uh, and have it a week and you've lost half of it
already.

B.132:  I know.  I bought a, a brand new, I bought a Jeep with everything on it --

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  -- and it was just, I don't know.  Big mistake.  I don't even use it.  I
rode my bike to class so there [snorting].

A.135:  [Throat_clearing] I live, uh, I live in a, a ranch.

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  Uh, five rooms upstairs, one, uh, room downstairs.  A basement, full
#cellar.#

B.138:  #Uh-huh [talking] [laughter] {background}.#

A.139:  Uh, I, I've been painting it white only because, uh, that's the way it was
when I bought it.  It's a white with black shutters on it.

B.140:  Huh.

A.141:  Uh, I've got a garage under the house.  

B.142:  So where, where are you near?

A.143:  Uh, #Boston.#

B.144:  #Outside# of Boston?

A.145:  Yeah.  I'm about thirty-five miles south of Boston.

B.146:  Oh, are you, are you near, uh, I have re-, in-laws that live there.

A.147:  Uh-huh.  #Where about?#

B.148:  #What is it?#  Duxbury.

A.149:  Uh, that's still a good hour ride I guess.

B.150:  [Bell].  North or south of you?

A.151:  I'm, they're north of me.

B.152:  Okay.  So you're like at the bottom of Cape Cod?

A.153:  No, I'm not in Cape Cod.  I'm, uh, oh, about a, you know, five minute ride
from Rhode Island.

B.154:  [Noise] Oh, okay.  Way down there.  I see.  #I see.#

A.155:  #And# ...

B.156:  ((Yeah,)) I was, I was up there Christmas.  My sister got [lipsmack]
married in Duxbury.  #(( )).#

A.157:  #The# housing market up here is, uh, is really slumped.  So you can buy a
houses relatively inexpensive right now.

B.158:  Huh.  Raleigh w-, w-, have you ever, do you read, uh, U S NEWS?

A.159:  No, I don't.

B.160:  Raleigh was in the top twenty-five housing market.  I mean, it was a good
place to buy a house but the problem is that the average house costs is really
high.

A.161:  What about the tax structure?

B.162:  I mean it's, it's good to buy a house if you have the money.

A.163:  Uh-huh.

B.164:  It's just that the houses are like [swallowing] two hundred to three
hundred thousand dollar houses.

A.165:  Wow.  What is the tax structure like up there?  How much a thousand?

B.166:  I'm, I'm not really sure to tell you the truth.  

A.167:  #As my, uh, you [laughter]# --

B.168:  #Being a renter.  Not even caring about that [laughter].#  

A.169:  -- don't care about that huh?

B.170:  No.  

A.171:  My, uh, my taxes exceed my mortgage payment.

B.172:  Wow [dishes].

A.173:  [Laughter] It wasn't like that when #I first# ...

B.174:  #That's like# my car where the insurance is almost, [laughter] you go to
the [laughter] ...

A.175:  Yeah.  I can imagine.  It wasn't like that when I first bought my house.
Uh, this gentleman that I was talking to when I did buy my house told me
that's what happened to him.

B.176:  Huh.

A.177:  And, uh, this was, you know, thirty years ago.  And it's happening to me.
My tax is  exceeding my mortgage payment.

B.178:  Yeah.

A.179:  I'm paying a hundred and twenty-one dollars a month.  Uh, I've got another,
uh,

B.180:  [Door] [clinking].

A.181:  year to pay on my house.

B.182:  Huh.

A.183:  And my, my, uh, taxes are a hundred and thirty-five.  #((So)).#

B.184:  #Wow.  Th-, that just# doesn't seem to make any sense.  Why if you have to
tax something for something you already earn [laughter].

A.185:  [Laughter] Yeah.  But they're going to tax you just like they tax you, your
automobile.

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  They're going to tax your home.  

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  And then you've got maintenance expenses.  But the overall cost is, is a, a
lot cheaper now.  And where you're single, now's the time to do it.  #When# --

B.190:  #Yeah.#

A.191:  -- you're married, you know, got to have time, you're not going to have
money.  #You're not going to have# ...

B.192:  #Well, I# did see a house for sale in the area I wanted to move into but.
#I don't# --

A.193:  #What is, what th-,# ...

B.194:  -- where I could come up with the down payment [thumping].  Uh ... 

A.195:  What is the down payments look like now?  Twenty-five percent?

B.196:  I don't know #[laughter].  I don't know.#

A.197:  #You didn't even,# didn't even look huh?

B.198:  I didn't even look.  Uh, see I'm living with two other people so when I,
when we break five hundred dollars in, in three ways.

A.199:  Oh, it isn't bad.

B.200:  Yeah.  It's not bad at all.  

A.201:  You're living with three other people?

B.202:  No, two other people.

A.203:  Two, that's still tough [laughter].

B.204:  Yeah.

A.205:  I can't even live with one #[laughter] [scratching].#

B.206:  #[Laughter].#  Well, I don't know.  I still like being a student I guess.

A.207:  Yeah.  Well, it's, it's nice to get somebody to help you with the rent and
everything.  But, uh --

B.208:  Uh-huh.

A.209:  -- at the end of ten years, what are you going to have.

B.210:  Nothing #[laughter].#     

@@A.211:  #[Laughter].#  What are you majoring in school?

B.212:  I'm in computer science.  Actually, I'm, uh, today I had, uh, I'm in a
Masters program.

A.213:  Oh, yeah.

B.214:  And today was my thesis defense and I passed.

A.215:  Wow.  #((Oh, I see)).#

B.216:  #So# we're getting ready for a big party #[laughter].#

A.217:  #[Laughter]# [cough].

B.218:  As you can imagine.

A.219:  So you're graduating this year.

B.220:  Yeah.  I'm going to graduate this semester.  So actually I'm going into
the, uh, job market.

A.221:  #[Music] Uh-huh. (( )).#

B.222:  #What I# really want to do is pay off my car #and then# ...

A.223:  #Lots of, lots# of luck on the job market.

B.224:  Yeah.

A.225:  Although the computer, uh, science areas are booming right now.

B.226:  Yeah.

A.227:  But the, uh, the thing that's holding everything back right now is the
economy.

B.228:  Yeah.  I, I really didn't have any problem.  I mean, I had companies
knocking on my door.  I didn't even like interview.  They came looking for me
[laughter].

A.229:  No kidding.  Now that's good.

B.230:  Yeah.

A.231:  Th-, they're always looking for a lot of, uh, good computer people because
#there's# --

B.232:  #Yeah.#

A.233:  -- a lot of equipment out there and no one knows how to run it
#[laughter].# 

B.234:  #Yeah.#  #Yeah.#

A.235:  #I,# I run a little, uh, computer business at, at my home at night.

B.236:  Oh, really.

A.237:  Yeah.  I'm working with, uh, Texas Instruments home computer.

B.238:  Okay.

A.239:  And I do repair work, sell software and hardware.

B.240:  #Huh.#

A.241:  #Uh,# we're supposed to be talking about houses though, right?  [Laughter]
Well I run the business in my #home.#

B.242:  #Out of y-,# out of your house.

A.243:  [Laughter].

B.244:  Yeah.  Well, that's great.

A.245:  [Cough] So what kind of a house do you expect to buy when you do buy?

B.246:  [Thumping] Uh, [sigh] something on a lake.  

A.247:  #((All right)) [laughter].  Uh-huh.#

B.248:  #Or on a body of water.#  This is the ideal house right?

A.249:  Yeah, right.

B.250:  Big garage.  A big basement.  

A.251:  #[Laughter].#

B.252:  #Just like# my parents house #except# --

A.253:  #Huh.#

B.254:  -- for on the water [laughter].  

A.255:  Well, maybe some day you'll own your parents' homes.

B.256:  That's true.  Because I think they're going to move to Arizona when they
get old #[laughter].#

A.257:  #[Laughter].#

B.258:  My dad is into hot air ballooning and that's like balloon heaven is Arizona
[noise].

A.259:  Wow.  So it doesn't sound like he's ready to retire yet #[laughter].#

B.260:  #No.  Well# he retired from one job and then took another one, #you know.
Took that early retirement# --

A.261:  #[Laughter] (( )).#

B.262:  -- deal.  Now has two salaries [laughter] [talking] [clicking].  

A.263:  Wow.  Do you do ballooning too?

B.264:  Uh, I've crewed for him some.  

A.265:  Oh. 

B.266:  But, uh, #he's the pilot.#

A.267:  #I've never,# never gone up in a balloon [/T V].  

B.268:  Excuse me?
