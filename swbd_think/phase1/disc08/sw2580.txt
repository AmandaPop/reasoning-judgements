REMARKS:        Tremendous background echo made understanding both speakers 
more difficult than average.  In some cases, it wasn't clear whether words 
were said twice or if it was an echo.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  Yeah, how many times have you called or, or participated?

A.3:  Uh, this, I'm, about my fifteenth call. 

B.4:  Okay, I, I'm a little less than that.  I was going to call this week.  I
forgot about it just until, I was going to do it tonight. 

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Uh, I have, I was, I called I think every day last week and I forgot about
this week.  I got so tied up with some other things.  I got about ten I think. 

A.7:  Yeah.  Well, let's see, our, our topic is, uh,

B.8:  #Voting.#

A.9:  #elections.# Uh, uh, the reason I think the elections are, are so low,
and I'm not sure what they mean by eligible voters.  Are they talking about
people that have registered --

@B.10:  #Oh, yeah, I'm sure.# 

A.11: -- #or people that are,# are old enough to vote but haven't registered?

B.12:  I would think they would talk about people who are already registered and,
and, uh, you know, the ones that are on the rolls already, you know. 

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  I'm amazed myself sometimes.  I've got some ideas and they've tried a few
things but, yeah, you've heard,

A.15:  Yeah, uh, well I think one of the reasons, uh, only fifty percent or so
vote in the national is, uh, well, for one thing, just, just, uh, having to
get to the polls.

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  Because a lot of people work and not every place,

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  #will# give you time off to go to the polls. 

B.20:  Yeah.  I, I'm kind of with you.  In fact, I even think that the, there's a
consp-, I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, but, you know, if you really wanted,
you know, hundred and hundred million people to vote, why would you have voting
from seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night for a national
election?

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  To me you need to have two, what's wrong with having two days, uh,
Thursday, Friday or three, two and a days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday or
something, you know, where people can vote, uh.  I don't think there's a le-,
I don't think there's a lot of politicians want a heavy vote out because, uh,
I can agree in local, elect-, elections which usually are on Saturdays.  And
I'm not too sure that's the best idea.  I think maybe you should have it, you
know, Friday noon until Saturday, so that people who, I like to do things
during the week --

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  -- and I might do it.  And I, I really think that they don't try, you know.
I, I really think it's obvious.  The answers to me is just to have longer, you
know, have at least two days for a national election, my goodness.

A.25:  And either that, or all either have also, uh, uh, second shifts. 

B.26:  Right, right. 

A.27:  Because a lot of people work, uh, you know, hours that, oh, they may have
two or three hours there that they could either go before or after work. 

B.28:  Right. 

A.29:  But, uh, uh, that pushes some people. 

B.30:  Well, yeah, the seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night is,
is usually the average time that most workers go to work, you know,

A.31:  Right. 

B.32:  And I'm amazed by that, that, uh.  The only good thing they've done lately
is have these, uh, uh, elections, uh, what do they call it when you can vote
ahead of time, uh, uh, #absentee?,#

A.33:  #Absentee.# 

B.34:  And I've done that and,

A.35:  #[Cough].#

B.36:  #actually# we've got some high turn outs here in Arlington on some of the
absentee because you can,

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  #vote# like two Saturdays before or something like that.  But I think it's
amazing that they, they keep complaining about people not voting and, and
national elections should be more than one day.  I mean,

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  #I# don't see how, you can have tens of, or hundreds of thousands of
people that, you know, just can't quite make it on that particular day for one
reason or another, you know. 

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  Two days to me doesn't seem to be too unrealistic for a national election. 

A.43:  Yeah.  And as far as local, local elections are concerned [cough],  pardon
me, [cough],  I can understand, you know, why a lot of people don't vote on
those because in the first place, not many people are, are really that knowl-,
knowledgeable about what the, uh, what the, uh, candidates are for or against. 

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  And, uh, uh, a lot of the, uh, uh, what do you call them? Not bonds but, uh,

B.46:  Yeah.  The bonds we had some here in Arlington, recently.  But,

A.47:  Yeah, a lot of the bonds and, uh, other things that you're voting on, people
just don't know really what the whole thing's about. 

B.48:  Yeah.  I, I don't really know why you have, uh, uh, you know, in a small
city or whatever, medium size city, you have a couple hundred thousand people
eligible, you know --

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  -- and you get ten thousand to vote.  I don't have an answer for that.  I
think that, uh, it is apathy without question. 

A.51:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.52:  Uh, we are, we are not taking it as serious as the people who have lost
their rights and everything overseas and everything. 

A.53:  Yeah {faintly}.

B.54:  And I think, uh, I don't know how to change that. 

A.55:  Yeah.  Plus,

B.56:  I always try to vote for those, and, but I, and there are some that if,
when they have them on Saturday, I'll say, All right, I'm going to work, I'm
going to go vote this afternoon.  And then I'll get busy, and if no one
reminds me, then I will forget.  So,

A.57:  #Yeah.#

B.58:  #I'm# not too sure, course I guess that's part of being apathy too.  But I
do try to vote in every one.  But, uh,

A.59:  #Plus,#

B.60:  #I# don't, I don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have
ten percent of the people voting.  That's really so low, I'm amazed. 

A.61:  Yeah.  Plus I think a lot of people are just flat [laughter] disgusted. 

B.62:  Oh, that too,

A.63:  Uh,

B.64:  #that too, yeah.#

A.65:  #n-, n-, not# realizing the way you change it is to vote. 

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  But, uh,

B.68:  But I think in national elections, uh, again it should be, the time is
definitely against the people.  I think you ought to have two days. 

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  You're voting for president.  Uh, why is it so sacred to have it on
Tuesday?  And, uh, why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday? I don't know what
the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend.  Or maybe just Tuesday
and Wednesday.  I'll bet you'd get a lot more people.  I think the news media
has really, they jump in there and they, uh, tell you the, the, that, who won
before seven thirty and before the le-, before the polls are closed.

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  And I think they jump in way, way too early.  I think that ought to be
restricted somehow. 

A.73:  Yeah. 

B.74:  Uh, they will not restrict it, but they just ought to not release.  I don't
know, I don't know what districts are releasing the numbers to these newsmen
that they can predict.  Uh, I, I thought the polls had to be closed before you
were allowed, why would you release it to the newsmen first? I, I don't even
know how the news media get these numbers,

A.75:  #Yeah.#

B.76:  #from# the polls.  I would think that ought to be sacred, and, and until
it's all over. 

A.77:  Plus also, I, I'm sure that there's a legitimate reason for it, but I don't
understand, uh, personally why you have to register as a Democrat or Republican
or whatever and then being, being able only to vote in that, that race. 

B.78:  That primary. 

A.79:  That primary. 

B.80:  Uh, yeah, I don't,

A.81:  Uh, I can see in one way that the right people would try to cancel out
votes. 

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  Uh, but, uh,

B.84:  Well, I think you can say you are an Independent too, but I don't know, uh.
Yeah, I haven't thought about that much.  I, I've, uh, wondered about it, but
I haven't really got concerned about it one way or another, you know.

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  Uh, what that holds back or anything. 

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  But you're right, it, it, tha-, that is a funny rule.  At least, uh, men
and women can vote.  It's amazing that we can still look overseas and see, you
know, this thing in Saudi Arabia, and all, and they still don't allow women to
vote.  It is still amazing.

A.89:  Yeah. 

B.90:  Of course, we, we don't have such a wonderful history that, you know, we
didn't allow Blacks to vote, uh, and we didn't allow women to vote until, I
don't even know what the year was for women. 

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  Nineteen nine, or something like that? When was that?

A.93:  Yeah. 

B.94:  So, well, we're changing, at least, at least we're trying.  And, and maybe
this absentee thing will, will take ahold and, uh, get more people to vote. 

A.95:  Yeah, and I'm not, I'm not real sure what the, well I guess I do, what the
pur-, was, I started to say, what the purpose of the registration is.  Uh, it
seems like to me they could use, uh, either your driver's license or your
social security number or something like that.

B.96:  Um-hum. 

A.97:  Because a lot of people don't vote because they didn't register. 

B.98:  Yeah, I don't know why.  Well, I think it ultimately I could see why you
wouldn't register necessarily when you're eighteen or nineteen, because you
don't get around to it.  But I, I think that people should register, you know,
after a year or so.  I don't,

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  It's not really that hard.  Uh, I haven't thought that people don't vote
because they're not registered.  I really think, uh, course that's apathy too. 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  You don't bother to register.  Uh, I am amazed, I don't have an answer for
why the numbers are so low. 

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  Yeah, I think you've got to have a good fight, you know.  You have to have
a lot of controversy [laughter].

A.105:  Well, I guess it's kind of like watching a ballgame, uh, or, or sports.  If
you're not, if you're not interested in the game, you wouldn't, you don't care
whether you see it or not. 

B.106:  Right.  Or if it's close. 

A.107:  Oh, yeah. 

B.108:  You know, you like to see them close, you don't like to see someone just
totally run away with it, and in foot-, in a football game or anything.  Even
if you're for one team or the other, you always like to see, let's have a good
game, which means you want to see a close game, you know.

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  So if there's no controversy, if you're not worried about who's going to
win, if you think it's going to be a shoo-in, then, uh, you know, you don't
vote. 

A.111:  Yeah. 

B.112:  So, uh.  But at least I guess we're so far ahead of some of the other
countries, uh, that we've still got a better system.  And, and, we are, we have
been doing this for two hundred years so, uh, I guess it's still better that a
lot of others. 

A.113:  Yeah.  I, I think usually, as a general use, rule, the best man wins, most
of the time. 

B.114:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is surprising how, uh, uh, even with low numbers, uh,

A.115:  Although I was a Goldwater man [laughter]  --

B.116:  Yeah. 

A.117:  -- and he didn't win. 

B.118:  Well, I, here in Arlington, we had this baseball thing and it was a big
controversy and everyone was talking about it, yet the voting was so low it was
unbelievable and they were spending a lot of money. 

A.119:  Yeah. 

B.120:  You would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the
city voting for this.  That was going to raise your taxes, and it was like
twenty five thousand or something like that, you know. 

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  So that part of it is still, uh, there's something that people, for some
reason they don't really want to vote, uh,

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  And maybe, maybe absent, maybe you ought to be able to do it on your
telephone, you know, I mean, I don't know. 

A.125:  Yeah, yeah.  I think, uh, if they made it a little more convenient, they
might get more votes. 

B.126:  Yeah.  And it may come to that, you know, with the electronic age.  Yeah,
you put in your cou-, {The recording ended with no further conversation},
