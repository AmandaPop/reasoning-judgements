============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what's your thoughts on it?  

B.2:  Okay, I, I think what happened with savings and loans is, uh, is what
everyone says, is they, they made a lot of, uh, of not well secured loans on
real estate, and when, uh, the bottom fell out of the real estate market, the
bottom fell out of their loans.

A.3:  That's it.  That's, that's the primary, that and the loosening of the
restrictions, letting them ease up on their cash reserves,

B.4:  Right.

**A.5:  and, uh, like you say, all these bad real estate loans and energy loans,

B.6:  Yeah.

**A.7:  um, you know, I, I, it's hard to say what caused it.  I mean, you know,
if, if the regulations hadn't been, uh, hadn't been relaxed, maybe it wouldn't
have happened but I somehow think it still would have.  You go in, you start
making massive investments in those two areas and you're, you're just playing
the market.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  You know, they were just gambling with their, their savers' money.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  And, of course,

**B.12:  Yeah, I think,

**A.13:  then of course there was the fraud, but you're going to have that
anywhere so,

B.14:  Right.  Yeah, that seemed to play a pretty big role, I think, because, I
don't know, I get the feeling that the regulations probably needed to be a
little, a little more stringent.

A.15:  Yeah.  Well, so are they, are they handling it right?  Gee, who knows
[laughter].

B.16:  Uh,

A.17:  I don't, don't even know if they know.

B.18:  Yeah, it certainly has, has, uh, the magnitude of the crisis.  It seems,
((I don't know)), it seems much greater than I would have thought.

A.19:  Yeah.

**B.20:  It really just seems out of proportion talking, they're talking four or
five hundred billion dollars.

A.21:  Yeah, I, that, that's the part of it I couldn't understand.  I mean --

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  -- I, I wonder if there's not a little bit of overzealousness there.  Uh,
you know, they say, well, this one went under because of bad energy loans, bad
real estate loans, and then they go around classifying everybody as bad.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25: When, in fact, there are some very good loans out there.  I mean not all
real estate loans are bad.  You know, the greatest majority of them are people
who own their homes.  So, you know, those aren't exactly what you'd call bad.

B.26: Right.  I think that a, a typically bad loan is, is that the ones that
just took place massively in Houston when they put up these huge office
buildings,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

**B.28:  and spent,

A.29:  Yeah, that, exactly.

**B.30:  very large amounts of money and then could simp-, simply could not rent
them out.

A.31:  Yeah.

**B.32:  They couldn't even rent them out for expenses.

A.33:  Yeah.

**B.34:  It was cheaper to keep them empty --

A.35:  Yeah, that,

B.36:  -- than to rent them at twenty percent occupancy.

**A.37:  yeah, and, and that's nothing more than speculation.  I mean they, they
--

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- it, it seems that there should have been something in the regulations
saying they couldn't do that.  I know banks can't do it.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Uh, back when I used to play the commodities market, I, I tried to go to
the bank to get a loan to buy gold and silver futures and they wouldn't let
me.

B.42:  Well, I mean just for me to mortgage my, to, to get a mortgage on my house,
I mean they invest-, investigated me personally to the point where I was
insulted --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- and I was putting forty thousand dollars down on a hundred and sixty
thousand dollar house.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  I mean I would have thought, go-, we're happy to do it, just sign here, you
know, but --

A.47:  Really.

B.48:  -- I mean they had forty thousand dollars in equity,

A.49:  And the,

**B.50:  and I mean they just,

A.51:  And, and then,

**B.52:  wanted to see three years of income tax,

A.53:  Yeah.

**B.54:  returns and all that bullshit, which really sort of disturbed me.

A.55:  Yeah, and then, and then some, some rich yo-yo walks in there, who's
buddies with the bank president, saying, look, I want to borrow seven hundred
thousand dollars so I can invest in this oil well.  They say, oh, sure, no
problem,

B.56:  Right.

**A.57:  you're a good customer.

B.58:  Yeah, yeah.

A.59:  Yeah, I, I, uh, I run, I run a little business on the side out of my home
and I tried to, uh, get set up with my bank to accept MasterCard and Visa.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  You would think I was asking for an appointment with the president.

B.62:  Uh [Laughter].

A.63:  And basically what it came down to is they weren't going to let me have it.

B.64:  Uh.

A.65:  Um, they frown on home business.  They, uh, they, they insist that you have
a storefront,

B.66:  Uh.

**A.67:  and that's just ludicrous.

B.68:  Yeah.

**A.69:  I mean, I mean the way things are going, people are more and more working
out of their homes.  I know a lot of people who do.  Lawyers, doctors --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- uh, architects, consultants, they, they work in their home.  There's no
reason for them to have an office.

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  They, they have very little customer contact, and when they do, they go to
the customer.

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  So I mean, wh-, you know, what's the story on them?  You know, are you
going to let them have it?  Well, of course they're going to get it.  You
know, all you've got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and they'll
give it to you.

B.76:  Yeah.  I, uh, I also run a little business out of my home on the side.
What's the nature of yours?

A.77:  Uh, mail order primarily.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  Me and my, uh, me and my roomie, who's also my partner, um, well, we lump
everything under this business.  I mean we do just about everything.  He's
into the computer end of things.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

**A.81:  He does consulting and graphics design and, oh, systems design.  I mean
you name it, he does that.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  And then I handle the mail order and whatever else.  We do, we do cat
breeding [laughter].  I mean, you know, it's all lumped under the business.

B.84:  Yeah.  Cat breeding, huh? 

A.85:  Um, yeah [Laughter] --

B.86:  Uh.

A.87:  -- make a few bucks here and there on that.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  But, um, we're, we're, there's several ways of getting set up to take
MasterCard and Visa.  Uh, there's several banks out there, the smaller banks
who are trying to break into the market and they will take the risk on a home
business.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  Uh, there's, I m-, I made a few contacts through CompuServe, um, talking
about, you know, hey, we're brokers for these banks.  You know, it, you don't
pay us anything.  The bank pays us.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  And, of course, what you're dealing with is some-, somewhat higher costs.

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  Like a two hundred and fifty dollar nonrefundable application fee.

B.96:  Uh, wow.

A.97:  So if the bank turns you down, well, that's it.  You're out two hundred and
fifty bucks [laughter].

B.98:  [Laughter] That's not too great.

A.99:  No, I, I'm, I'm, I'm leery of it.  I know that's the way it works.  Um,
but, and as long as you can meet their requirements, there, there's very
little chance they'll turn you down.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  And they do have some requirements, like you have to be registered with the
State, and you have to have a business address, and you have to have a
business phone line, and then you have to have a separate line for their
equipment, that kind of stuff.

B.102:  Yeah, yeah.

A.103:  Uh, but if meet all those, chances are they'll approve you.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  So we're looking at that.  It's just, it's just hard to give somebody two
hundred and fifty bucks on a chance, you know [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah, I would, I would find that, uh, a little bit disarming.

A.107:  Yeah.  What, what business do you do? 

B.108:  It's a computer business.

A.109:  Yeah.  Yeah, my, uh, my roomie is down in Charlotte right now.  He's got an
internship down at I B M.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  So business has sort of come to a standstill.

@@B.112:  I see.  Where does, does he go to school here? 

A.113:  Yeah, he's at, uh, he's at N C State.

B.114:  I see, okay.  What's, what's his name, I might know him?

A.115:  Uh, Floro Chrisostimo.

B.116:  Uh-huh, okay, I guess I don't.

A.117:  Do you by, are you by any chance out at the campus?

B.118:  Uh, no, huh-uh.

A.119:  Oh, okay, because the last guy I talked to was out on the campus.

B.120:  I see, uh.

A.121:  It was, how did, how did you get involved in this?

B.122:  Um, I've got a, a friend who's in the business who just gave me this
application.

A.123:  [Laughter] Yeah, he, he picked this thing up from school and brought it
home, and I said, yeah, sure, I'll do it, why not.

B.124:  Uh.

A.125:  And he signed up for it, and then, of course, he moved off to Charlotte so
now I'm stuck making his calls, too [laughter].

B.126:  I see.

A.127:  Stuff, gosh.  I don't know what I got roped into.

B.128:  Uh.  So, uh, oh, well, ((what of it)).

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  It's five bucks a shot, what the heck.

A.131:  Yeah, what the heck.  I'm surely not going to count this as business
income.

B.132:  Yeah.  Um, right.  Well, speaking of that, I think we've probably given
them their money's worth.

A.133:  Oh, yeah, no doubt about it.  I, I usually go until the, the recording
comes on.

B.134:  Oh, I see.  I've never gone that long.  That's,

A.135:  Have you, yeah.  That, it, it'll cut you in about ten minutes.

B.136:  Oh, I see.

A.137:  Uh, they used to, it used to say, you have exceeded the ten minute
recording limit, but now they just say, uh, we're sorry, our recording
capacity is limited today.

B.138:  Yeah, yeah.

A.139:  You know, a nicer way of saying you talked too long.

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  But anyway, if you need to get going, we'll, we'll terminate.

B.142:  Yeah, I really do,

A.143:  Okay.

B.144:  and, uh, so, uh, it's nice talking to you,

A.145:  Well, good talking to you.

**B.146:  Dave, and, uh,

A.147:  Maybe we'll, maybe we'll chat again.

B.148:  All right.

A.149:  All right, later on, man.

B.150:  Bye-bye.

A.151:  Bye-bye.
