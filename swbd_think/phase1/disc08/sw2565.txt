REMARKS:        The individual section started one phrase earlier 
than the joint conversation.  I have marked Speaker A and Speaker
B here as was done with the individual sections, which is opposite 
to what was in the conversation and and on the sheet of paper.

===========================================================================

B.1:  There we go. 

A.2:  Right. 

B.3:  Well, actually I'm a, I'm a Dodgers fan from way back. 

A.4:  Oh --

B.5:  Um,

A.6:  -- how way back, I mean [laughter] 

B.7:  Like, um, late fifties, early sixties. 

A.8:  Okay so Wally Moon moon shots and all that. 

B.9:  What's that?

A.10:  Yeah, coliseum, Wally Moon and all that. 

B.11:  Yeah. 

A.12:  Okay, yeah, it's a, um, I, I'm living in, just west of Baltimore, and
Frederick, um, which is also just west of Baltimore, has a minor league team.
And, uh, and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.

B.13:  Is that right?

A.14:  Yeah, so he's still kicking around. 

B.15:  That's interesting.  Yeah, I, I also lived eight years in Ohio before going
to, uh, going away to college, and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens. 

A.16:  Oh, I saw them, um, um, I was out there last Summer, and I saw a game at
Ned Skelton.  Is that the stadium?

B.17:  Uh, I couldn't tell you for sure.  It's been a long time. 

A.18:  Oh, okay.  So, um, there used to be a, uh, race track. 

B.19:  Uh-huh. 

A.20:  Yeah, it was, that was impression I got when I was there so,

B.21:  Yeah, I think that's right. 

A.22:  Okay, yeah, so had a lot of fun actually, I mean, I like minor league
baseball, a lot.  It's cheaper for one thing [laughter].

B.23:  Well, that's true.  I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the
last eleven years since I've been here.  Uh, they've led the American league
in batting, fielding and pitching, but they've never been able to do more than
one of those in any, any given year.  So.

A.24:  Yes [laughter].  I think they're in for a odd year this year, actually, um,
they, um, I don't understand why Encovilla got released.

B.25:  I don't either.  I mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe
thirty, eighty some R B I-s. 

A.26:  I mean, he, you know, he can't field and, you know, he strikes out a lot,
but, I mean, he's done that for five years.  Why get rid of him now?

B.27:  Really, I mean, he really has become a, a very decent fielder. 

A.28:  Oh, yes.  Okay. 

B.29:  He's not a, the liability that he was, that he used to be. 

A.30:  Oh, okay. 

B.31:  Um. 

A.32:  Oh, he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, I mean with Detroit, bunch
of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.

B.33:  Yeah, of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, you know, if he strikes out
a lot, so what.

A.34:  Yeah, well, I mean, with Detroit, I mean, they can get away with one guy
like that.  I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team
around Fielder. 

B.35:  Oh, yeah. 

A.36:  But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit
home runs and strike out --

B.37:  Right. 

A.38:  -- you know, which they did. 

B.39:  Yep. 

A.40:  So. 

B.41:  Well, I think the key for, for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can
come back. 

A.42:  I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter. 

B.43:  It may be. 

A.44:  I, I like them a lot.  I think they're going to go all the way.  Um, and,
and, I mean, by saying I like them, I like their chances.  I, I actually don't
like the Dodgers, I'm a Giants fan --

B.45:  Right, right. 

A.46:  -- from way back. 

B.47:  Well, picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt. 

A.48:  No, but Butler didn't hurt either.  Uh, and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt and,

B.49:  Uh, who's the last one. 

A.50:  Bobby Ojeda.  They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks. 

B.51:  Oh, okay. 

A.52:  Um, he's a, a pretty decent pitcher.  He's,

B.53:  Yes he is. 

A.54:  Okay, you know, he (( )).

B.55:  Yes. 

A.56:  And, uh, that guy (( )), the short stop, is going to be good. 

B.57:  Yeah. 

A.58:  Um. 

B.59:  Well it should be an interesting year. 

A.60:  Yeah, I'm looking, I've already been to one game, and I should have been to
two but, 

B.61:  Are you an Orioles fan?

A.62:  Um, the, the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox, mostly die,
but, um, I go to the Orioles since they're here, and I, you know, I do enjoy
them. 

B.63:  Yeah. 

A.64:  Um, I've had an opening day on Monday. 

B.65:  Yeah, you know, I kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they
do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams
here once in a while.

A.66:  (( )) How far is Houston?

B.67:  Uh, three hundred miles. 

A.68:  Oh, okay, keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes. 

B.69:  Yeah, it is, it's incredible. 

A.70:  Yeah, I, um, you know, we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a
National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia. 

B.71:  There you go. 

A.72:  And, um, saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams
the year before.

B.73:  Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you. 

A.74:  Okay, uh, yeah [laughter]. 

B.75:  Interesting. 

A.76:  Um, I try to see whatever I can.  I mean, I've been to like thirty or forty
games each of the last few years. 

B.77:  Wow. 

A.78:  Yeah, hope I'm going to do it this year because, um, uh, having a kid this
fall, so it's like --

B.79:  All right. 

A.80:  -- so much for going to lots of baseball games. 

B.81:  So, so do it while you can. 

A.82:  Yeah, seriously. 

B.83:  Sure.  Well, it's been good talking with you. 

A.84:  Yeah, good talking with you.  And, and you'll be happy I think in October
when the Dodgers win. 

B.85:  I wouldn't mind it. 

A.86:  Yeah, I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be
right [laughter]. 

B.87:  Yeah, well, God bless and good talking with you. 

A.88:  And good talking with you.  Take care. 

B.89:  Bye-bye. 

A.90:  Bye.
