REMARKS:        Speaker B had the television on in the background, which 
was loud enough that I could almost transcribe the voices on it.  The 
television was on throughout the conversation, and was very noticeable 
during pauses in the conversation.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  What, uh, go ahead and tell me about your home [laughter].

B.2:  [Breathing] Well, my home at the moment is an apartment.

A.3:  Oh, is that right?  [Laughter].

B.4:  Yeah [laughter].  I work here in Germantown, but I live in Pensacola,
Florida.

A.5:  Oh, that's interesting.

B.6:  So, I own a home in Pensacola, and, uh, let's see, we are to compare homes.
Correct?

A.7:  Okay.  Yeah.

B.8:  Uh, [breathing] my home is, [breathing] well, is typical for the area.  I
live in a development, [breathing] uh, it's a relatively, I would say, well,
God, it sounds like, [laughter] sounds like I'm bragging #[laughter].#

A.9:  #[Laughter]#  No, that's okay [laughter].

B.10:  But it's upper middle class,

A.11:  Okay.

B.12:  uh, kind of an environment.  It's a [breathing] two story colonial, which
my wife and I designed.

A.13:  Oh, that's neat.

B.14:  Uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet.

A.15:  Wow, that's large [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] Uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on, [breathing] and it
is, I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical
for the area.  It might be, [breathing] I would say it's probably midsized for
the area.  There are some smaller, and there are, s-, you know, several
larger.

A.17:  Uh-huh.   

B.18:  And, uh, 

A.19:  [Lipsmack] [noise]. 

B.20:  but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in, in Pensacola, in that
area of Florida [lipsmack] it, uh, [breathing] it's what now, it is, uh,
[breathing] probably [breathing] ten years old.

A.21:  Oh, well, that's not too bad,

B.22:  Yeah.   

A.23:  that's still fairly new.   

B.24:  And so it's, [breathing] in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth,
it, uh, [breathing] the hou-, you know, housing there is extremely affordable,
and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know, let's say compared
to Maryland [breathing],

A.25:  Well,  

B.26:  that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million
dollars [laughter] but,

A.27:  Oh, you're kidding [laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter].   

A.29:  [Breathing] Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there, I mean,
what it's,

B.30:  I really haven't, I really haven't, uh, [breathing] when we built it ten
years ago, it was, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.

A.31:  Okay.  

B.32:  [Breathing]  So, I, I would have really, I haven't really priced, you
know, in the market,

A.33:  [Laughter].   

B.34:  so I,  

A.35:  It, it sounds like, I mean, from the way you described it a home like that
here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand [laughter].

B.36:  Uh-huh.   

A.37:  I mean, Dallas is a very marked up [breathing] area, although right now
it's a lot lower [laughter],

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  um, because of all the layoffs and everything [laughter] the economy
around here is real poor [laughter].

B.40:  I thought that was on the upswing again now.

A.41:  Well, no, not really [laughter].   

B.42:  Uh-huh.   

A.43:  [Breathing] Um, the area itself, uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, um, has
become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big
companies, including Texas Instruments [laughter].

B.44:  Yes.   

A.45:  Um, there's been tremendous amounts of, of, uh, layoffs [breathing] so,
really housing is real bad.  The economy itself around here is not too
terribly bad, but housing is still real bad [breathing].

B.46:  Uh-huh [breathing]. 

A.47:  #Yeah.# 

B.48:  #Well,# Pensacola has [breathing] it's really is a buyer's market there now
[breathing].

A.49:  Yeah.  This is, 

B.50:  And it isn't because of the, well, there has been a lot of speculative
building.

A.51:  Oh.  

B.52:  Uh, I don't know, perhaps not in Dallas, but, uh, I'm sure people in, uh,
you know, in, uh, Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it, uh,
Pensacola is a Navy town.

A.53:  Uh-huh.   

B.54:  And home porting was a possibility a few years ago.   

A.55:  Oh.  

B.56:  They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand
people or more from the Navy,

A.57:  [Breathing] Wow.  

B.58:  (( )) a new carrier was coming in and, uh, the, uh, attendant, uh,
support vessels.  Well, that's no longer,

A.59:  So, do you think,

B.60:  [Breathing] the case.   

A.61:  it was overdeveloped then?   

B.62:  Oh, it's, it is.  I mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is
phenomenal compared to the population.

A.63:  Wow.   

B.64:  And so i-, overbuilding is, i-, has been a real problem there.

A.65:  Um.  

B.66:  So you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable
price.  And I mean [breathing] good, I would, let's say typical, [lipsmack]
say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, [breathing] on a half acre or so
of land [breathing], uh, {pause} reasonable construction would probably run
you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred
and forty thousand dollars.

A.67:  Um [lipsmack],  

B.68:  And probably, perhaps,  

A.69:  yeah.   

B.70:  cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.   

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  What about your home?

A.73:  [Breathing] Well, [breathing] right now we're just renting, but [laughter]
it is a home.  Um,

B.74:  Uh-huh.   

A.75:  [Lipsmack] it's a four bedroom home [breathing].  It has about, I guess,
eighteen hundred square feet [breathing].  It's on one floor [breathing].

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Uh, we have no basement [laughter].  I don't know,

B.78:  Nor do we, but,  

A.79:  Okay [laughter].   

B.80:  [Laughter].   

A.81:  I wasn't sure.  Most of the ones,  

B.82:  [Throat_clearing].

A.83:  you know, up north and everything do, [laughter] but, um, anyway,
[lipsmack] it's, uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area.  Most of
this area was developed, this house was built in seventy-four.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  [Breathing] So most of the, it's almost twenty years old, and most of the
houses around here were built pretty much the same style [breathing].  Uh,
we have a friend that lives two blocks over, [breathing] and his house is
almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four --

B.86:  Uh-huh.   

A.87:  -- but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same.  So I, I think most of
them are [breathing] there was, it, like most areas that are built,
[breathing] um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose
from [laughter].

B.88:  Right.   

A.89:  And, and, uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, [laughter] for
probably a square mile, I'd say, at least, [breathing] maybe even a little bit
more than that.

B.90:  [Breathing]  Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious.  And
in, in the entire D C area.  I'm, [breathing] I'm only about, uh, twelve
miles or so from the, uh, border of Washington D C, [breathing] and Montgomery
County, Maryland is probably one of the most expensive,

A.91:  [Breathing] Where are you in relation to Sevren?

B.92:  places to, 

A.93:  are you close to Sevren?   

B.94:  [Breathing]  No, we are west.

A.95:  Okay.

B.96:  Sevren is east, near the eastern shore,  

A.97:  Well, I just, 

B.98:  if I had, 

A.99:  I have a sister that used to live in Sevren.   

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  And they bought their home [breathing] in [breathing] I, I want to say like
around nineteen seventy-five or something like that, and they paid like, they,
they had it built from, you know, they, they designed it and everything,
[breathing] and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it, and
when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
[laughter].

B.102:  Oh, that's not unusual, yeah.

A.103:  Yeah, so I just wondered, you know, if the whole area was like that
#[laughter] or,#

B.104:  #[Cough].#  Well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in
the, the immediate, you know, Washington area.

A.105:  Uh-huh.   

B.106:  And so, we, uh, I was just looking, for example there is a, uh, condominium
complex next to the apartment complex where I live, and I was over there
recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium.  And
[breathing] ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom, which is
essentially a two bedroom apartment.

A.107:  Um.   

B.108:  Now, it was very nicely done.   

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  ((I would have thought)), 

A.111:  Sounds like a lot of money though [laughter],   

B.112:  Yes.  I,  

A.113:  sure. 

B.114:  I can't, I can't envision spending that much money, and [breathing] on,
on something along those lines.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  So, you know, it's, y-, I guess you pay the piper but, 

A.117:  Right.   

B.118:  Plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally,   

A.119:  Oh, yeah.   

B.120:  high.  Uh, for the, and so, you, on that [breathing], it's not unusual, for
example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know,
what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house
[breathing] say, for example, in Pensacola, Florida, on that house [breathing]
with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four
hundred dollars a year taxes.

A.121:  Wow.   

B.122:  May-,    

A.123:  Yeah.   

B.124:  maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now, [breathing] but
that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year,

A.125:  [Breathing].

B.126:  taxes on it.   

A.127:  Wow [laughter].

B.128:  [Laughter].   

A.129:  Wow, that's,  

B.130:  So, it's, uh,  

A.131:  [Laughter].   

B.132:  so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say,
drive [breathing] twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for
approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, but the taxes would
be, you know, [breathing] perhaps, maybe one-third --

A.133:  Really?

B.134:  -- uh, of,  

A.135:  That much of a difference?   

B.136:  Oh, absolutely.   

A.137:  Wow.   

B.138:  Yeah, so,  

A.139:  [Laughter].   

B.140:  it's, it's really sad [laughter].   

A.141:  Yeah [laughter].

B.142:  This is one, this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.

A.143:  Wow.  Why is that?  Do you know?  I mean [lipsmack],  

B.144:  [Breathing] Well, they [breathing], it, {pause} the, their, they do have an
extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example.  It
has one of the best school systems in the country.

A.145:  Uh-huh [noise].   

B.146:  Uh, and because the cost of living around here is so high,  

A.147:  Oh.   

B.148:  public employees make great salaries around here [laughter].

A.149:  Oh [laughter].

B.150:  I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the,

A.151:  [Breathing] [noise]. 

B.152:  Montgomery County Public Schools makes, a-, an-, and I'm not, this is,
uh, the figure, he makes eighty thousand dollars a year.

A.153:  [Breathing] My goodness [laughter].

B.154:  That's,

A.155:  Wow [laughter].

B.156:  and I, by administrator I, I think I mean, I, they didn't, they did not
define it, but [breathing] for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal
or [breathing] someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
