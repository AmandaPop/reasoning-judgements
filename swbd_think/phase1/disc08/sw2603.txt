REMARKS:        Speaker B volume was much lower than Speaker A, and in
some places it was difficult to hear her.  Bird could be heard chirping
in background on Speaker B side throughout the recording.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Um, I guess what, I guess my [laughter] task.  [Laughter] I usually
ride my bike.  I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.  And
when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much
nicer.  [Laughter] The stationary bike is, is so, uh,

B.2:  #Boring.#

A.3: #boring.#	 [Laughter] But I have head phones, and I, plus I have
it, uh, in the living room so I either watch T V,

B.4:  [Bird_squawk].

A.5:  or we have a fish tank, so I watch the fish, you know. [Laughter] Whatever
I can do to keep myself occupied. [Laughter] If, I like to have the T V on,
because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.  It kind of takes the time
away and I don't realize, really, [noise] that's really the only time I ever
watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.  But, and then usually after I'm done
riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,
and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not
quite as tired I guess.  [Laughter] But it's definitely a task.

B.6:  You think so?

A.7:  I can't say that I really enjoy it.  [Laughter] I wish that I did enjoy it
more, but I do it because I have to not because I want to [laughter].

B.8:  I bought a stationary bike, but I find that if I sit [bird_squawk] on that
seat too long, it hurts.

A.9:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.10:  And I haven't figured how to get that soft, and I tried even tying a pillow
to it.  But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's
almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And I love it.

A.13:  Really? 

B.14:  I just love it.

A.15:  So is it just women that go there?

B.16:  Yeah.  It's totally women.

A.17:  See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a,
a health club.  Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people
watch me exercise.  [Laughter] You know, so I have tried to just do stuff
at home and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.  I mean, I'm not big, you
know, or anything, but I still don't like other people watching [laughter] me.

B.18:  I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Uh, 

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have
to be conscious --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- of it being a little bit too low.  And I, my bathing suit's just one
piece, so there's no big deal all the way around, but --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.  And
it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.
Because, hey, you can do what you want.  You're a female, and no one is
staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.

A.27:  That's what,

B.28:  And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.

A.29:  Really?  That's,

B.30:  Oh, yeah.

A.31:  that's great.  #How,# 

B.32:  #And I# love the water aerobics. I love the water aerobics.

A.33:  Do they have a pool or what is, 

B.34:  Oh, yeah.  They've got a nice one.

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  They have two types of water aerobics.  They call it aqua exercise, I guess
is what they call it.

A.37:  I've heard that that's really good for you to do.

B.38:  It pushes you because you're pushing against the water --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- in itself.  So it is like double strenuous.  But you're not being double
strenuous on your own body.  Because you're pushing it yourself.

A.41:  Uh-huh.   

B.42:  So you're doing it yourself.

A.43:  So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?

B.44:  Huh-uh.

A.45:  When you're in the water?

B.46:  Huh-uh.  [Laughter] The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop
and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.  I
end up having to quit for a while.  But I get blisters on my toes on the
bottom #because,#

A.47:  #Oh, wow.# [Laughter].  

B.48:  I really jump a lot.

A.49:  Well, that's funny, I never would have thought of that.

B.50:  Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles
on the bottom.  Especially around the pool.  So they just --

A.51:  #Like wat-,# 

B.52:  -- #wear them# right into the pool.

A.53:  Are they water shoes?  Is that,

B.54:  Yeah.  They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers
with --

A.55:  Oh, okay, okay.

B.56:  -- rubber, you know, soles, 

A.57:  Okay, okay.

B.58:  so that, you know, no big deal one way or the other.

A.59:  Huh, that's really #funny [laughter].#

B.60:  #But,# I never think about it until after you go there for about a week,
your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.  So no big deal.

A.61:  Huh, [laughter] that's, 

B.62:  But it's fun.

A.63:  So, how often do find yourself going?  Um, on a, if you're doing it on a
regular basis, how often do you go?

B.64:  I try to make it at least three times a week.

A.65:  Yeah.  That's really,

B.66:  For a while I was doing it every day.  Just,

A.67:  Really?

B.68:  going, uh, five days a week. 

A.69:  I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.  But I do force myself
to do it at least three times a week.  Which I don't feel like is enough, but
i-, it's, it's at least something.  [Laughter] You know, it, it, I just force,
I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't
enjoy it.  But I know that I have to do it.  I mean it's just, it's, it's not
a question of whether I want [laughter] to, you know.

B.70:  Well,

A.71:  But,  

B.72:  When I was working up at, uh, The Summit,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  here in Plano, I'd leave there, and I'd be at the swimming pool by four
o'clock.

A.75:  Oh, that's,

B.76:  Oh, actually about four thirty because they start at five to six, so I was
there by four thirty, every night.  And the only thing that ever bothered me
was my hair getting wet.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to
your, oh, chest, I'd say.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go, but,

A.83:  #Did you ever,#  

B.84:  #I enjoyed it# higher.

A.85:  Well, I'm sorry [laughter].

B.86:  That's okay.

A.87:  Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?  Did
you --

B.88:  #I have a,# 

A.89:  -- #ever try that?#

B.90:  I have a bad back, {pause} so I'm very limited what I #do.#

A.91:  #Oh,# okay.

B.92:  It's like I can walk, but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's
going to bother #me.#

A.93:  #Um.#

B.94:  Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard, #it will bother
me.#

A.95:  #Then that would,# yeah. 

B.96:  it will bother me.  

A.97:  I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you,
wouldn't it?

B.98:  Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that
when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.  I went in there
strictly to strengthen my back muscles.

A.99:  Oh.

B.100:  And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.  She says you get just as
much if you did the aerobics on the floor.  She says in fact you get more.

A.101:  Wow.

B.102:  I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.  

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  I like water.  I'm not scared of it.  But I couldn't, I guess I could swim
across the pool, but I'm no swimmer per se.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  But I found that this worked really well.  And I came out of there and I
saw my stomach going down well.

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds.  

A.109:  Wow.

B.110:  Just by watching what I ate.  And they fix you up with a diet, which worked
real good.

A.111:  What if you're already on one?  I mean,

B.112:  What?  A diet?

A.113:  Yeah.  I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs.
Would they?

B.114:  Oh, no, they have nothing to do with that.

A.115:  Okay.

B.116:  See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.
And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, [lipsmack] gives you a diet, a computerized
diet.  And they go over all your health and all your history, and they show
you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.  So it
became part of the package, so I went through it.  #It worked out well.#

A.117:  #But they have packages# where they just offer the exercise program.  Is
that what you're saying?

B.118:  Oh, yeah.  You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.

A.119:  I see, #okay.#

B.120:  #I just# went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening
benefit, so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,

A.121:  Um.  

B.122:  after all this time.  So it's like when I got laid off, I went back in
there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.

A.123:  Um.

B.124:  So I get all the same treatment again.  So it's kind of nice.

A.125:  Wow.  #That's,#   

B.126:  #Like I# said, I like it.  I like the heat. I like the, I jump out of the
swimming pool, and I go into the hot tub.

A.127:  Oh [laughter].

B.128:  And I love it.

A.129:  Yeah.  That would be really nice [laughter].

B.130:  Because I have n-, I have never, let me reword that, I think I have gone
home maybe once or twice slightly sore.  But that's because of my physical
condition and nothing to do what they did.

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  That's, I knew I was pushing too far.  

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I
come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.  It's no big deal.

A.135:  So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,

B.136:  It's fun.  It's fun.  Uh, I've gotten on the bike.  And they've got, uh,
the stepping bike, where you step.

A.137:  #Uh-huh.#

B.138:  #And I've# enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.

A.139:  That's, you #know, I wanted,#  

B.140:  #But most of# the others to me are very dull.  

A.141:  I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike, but I got
talked into the bike instead.  And I don't know, [laughter] I really wanted a
stepper.  I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.  But I'm not
sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.  I mean, I don't know if it
would really do any good having both of them.  Which one do you feel is
better, since you use them both?

B.142:  [Lipsmack] {Pause} Um, I get bored very easily.  Uh, the one nice thing
about the bicycle is you just sit.  Like you said, you can sit and do it, and
watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're
basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.

A.145:  Huh.

B.146:  So you have a little, you know, little, you can program the one at
Cosmopolitan Lady so,

A.147:  Uh-huh.  

B.148:  to what your gear is.  Uh, I, it would depend upon which one you want.  I
think now that I've had the bicycle, I would go to the stepper.  But if I were
you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it
for a while.  Because you can buy a month's membership.

A.149:  Oh, really? 

B.150:  And see what you feel is best for you.

A.151:  Um.

B.152:  Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to
do.  Because I jump on the bike here at home.  Mine has its, see, the handle
bars go up and down,

A.153:  Uh-hum.  

B.154:  so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said, and
it has no effect on me.  So I mean, it's boring [/bird_squawk].

A.155:  Uh-huh.
