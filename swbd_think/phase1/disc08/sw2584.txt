==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Do you go camping very much?

@B.2:  No, I've haven't gone camping in years.  But it's is something that I've
done in the past.  How about you?

A.3:  Uh, we try to go once, maybe twice a summer.  Uh,

B.4:  #That's, that's pretty average to me [laughter].#

A.5:  #[Laughter] we, uh, just, you know, for# like a short weekend or something.
We don't go for the long, you know, week long thing.

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  But we usually go to, uh, a lake area, you know, where the campsites,

B.8:  #Right.#

A.9:  #are# and do that.  Uh,

B.10:  Do you tent camp or do you have a camper?

A.11:  Oh no, no, no a tent. 

B.12:  That's what I ha-, you know, that's how I camp too.  That's how I define
camping [laughter]. 

A.13:  Me too [laughter].  You're really roughing it. 

B.14:  [Laughter]  The rest, the rest of that is re-, really not the same. 

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  As a matter of fact, my, my, you know, the majority of the amount of
camping I've done has been really roughing it.  Um, as a little girl I'd go
with my dad and my uncle and my brother, and we went to the Boundary Waters
area in Minnesota.  So,

A.17:  #Oh.#

B.18:  #that's,# that's really wild. 

A.19:  Yeah.  Are you here in local Texas, I mean?

B.20:  Yes, I'm in Austin, where are you?

A.21:  I'm in Garland. 

B.22:  Oh. 

A.23:  Right outside of Dallas. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  So we, um, we have a five year old, and we started taking her, she was
pretty young when we started, uh, camping with her. 

B.26:  Oh, the kids love it. 

A.27:  I know. 

B.28:  I mean, they just love it.  It's wonderful for them to be outside. 

A.29:  I know, and then they, and they, you know, [sigh]  there's no T V, and they
don't have all these modern toys, and they have to use sticks and rocks and
stuff like,

B.30:  # Exactly.  #

A.31:  # that # to play with. 

B.32:  Yes. 

A.33:  And I like that.  It's pretty fun. 

B.34:  Well, ((how it,)) it's really is a, is a good, good family thing,

A.35:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.36:  # to # do. 

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  Yeah.  And,

A.39:  We, we try to, uh, go with another couple that have children also. 

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  And, uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable.  Plus, you know, we don't have
to go out and buy all the [sigh]  equipment and stuff, you know, we kind of
split it up.  Uh,

B.42:  Good planning [laughter]. 

A.43:  Yeah [laughter].  Because it gets, it really does get expensive if you, if
you don't want to rough it all the way. 

B.44:  Exactly. 

A.45:  You know, even the sleeping bags, those are running, you know, a good
thirty dollars a pop, and,

B.46:  # You're right.  #

A.47:  # and so # we've built that up.  But,

B.48:  Do you have a boat?

A.49:  No. 

B.50:  No?

A.51:  Want one bad.  Do you?

B.52:  Oh, well, actually, I would, you know what I would love? I would absolutely
love a sail boat. 

A.53:  Oh. 

B.54:  That doesn't go along with camping, but,

A.55:  # Yes [laughter].  #

B.56:  # now that, # that, that's what I would like,

A.57:  # Yeah, #

B.58:  # to # have. 

A.59:  I would too. 

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  Would too.  We usually, uh, let's see, we try to go to a lake.  My husband
and this, uh, other couple that we go with, her husband, um, kind of likes, um,
is it scuba dive? And, so we'll go to a lake and, uh, [throat_clearing]  where
they can go do that. 

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # We're # close enough so they can do that, and the girls can play on the
beach area [whispering].  {Okay.  Whispers this, maybe to someone in
background}.

B.64:  And I would play on the beach area too. 

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  That's what I would do. 

A.67:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.68:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.69:  That's fun. 

B.70:  I'm just sitting here list-, listening to your accent and thinking what a
good time the computer is going to have with that. 

A.71:  [Laughter]  Really? Am I pretty Texan?

B.72:  You're pretty Texan. 

A.73:  # [Laughter].  #

B.74:  # Yes.  # But you know, you know what's really funny? Um, I've had people
tell me that I have a Texas accent, and, and I mean, there is just no way I've
not picked one up. 

A.75:  No, you don't, you don't sound like it to me. 

B.76:  I've only lived here about six years. 

A.77:  Oh, have you?

B.78:  So, i-, i-, if I have one, it must be very, very slight. 

A.79:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

B.80:  [Laughter]  The Yankees can hear it. 

A.81:  Yes.  Oh, that's true, that's true.  I, see I don't think I do, but, uh,
but a lot of people do say I sound like, I guess, I have, I guess more of a
twang,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # to # my voice {faintly, almost a whisper}.

B.84:  Are you a, a native Texan?

A.85:  I sure am. 

B.86:  Oh. 

A.87:  I've lived here all my life. 

B.88:  Well, good for you. 

A.89:  But, any way, uh, {almost whispering},

B.90:  Have you ever been to Austin?

A.91:  Yes, yes we went last summer, actually. 

B.92:  This, how was, I'm wondering, I'm really not that not familiar.  I know
there are some good places to go camping along the, uh, the lakes. 

A.93:  Or is there? Okay, well, we didn't go camping, we just, uh, we did like,
uh, we drove down to Houston to visit friends, and,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # we # went to Galveston and, uh, to San Antonio and then up to Austin.
And, and kind of, uh, you know, doing the sight seeing type stuff.  So we
didn't go camping.  That would be fun though to go.  That's one thing my
husband wanted to do, was, on this summer's vacation was to go and camp
wherever we went.  And I said, Well, I'd love that but,

B.96:  It takes a lot more planning. 

A.97:  It does, and, and ever once, you know, on my summer vacation, you know, my
week-long vacation, I,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # want # to be a little bit pampered, you know, by a,

B.100:  # Right.  #

A.101:  # hotel # and a waiter [laughter]. 

B.102:  Exactly, exactly, yeah. 

A.103:  So, we're hoping to do like a three day weekend.  There's, um, a thing
called Pfeiffer Rim.  I don't know if you have ever heard of it?

B.104:  No, I haven't. 

A.105:  It's, uh, there's a town called Glenrose.  I think it's around two hours
from here.  And, uh, it's, it has like dinosaur tracks,

B.106:  # Oh, that sounds, #

A.107:  # and stuff like # that and it's got one of those wildlife parks. 

B.108:  That sounds great. 

A.109:  Yeah.  I think that'll be fun.  So we're going to try to do that like on a
three day weekend, go there and,

B.110:  Have you ever camped out of state?

A.111:  No, I haven't. 

B.112:  You know, where you should try,

A.113:  # Where at? #

B.114:  # sometime is # Colorado.  It is beautiful. 

A.115:  Is it?

B.116:  Absolutely beautiful. 

A.117:  I've just been up there skiing, and, well, we've driven through, and,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # you # know,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # but, # but not, you know, camping or anything.  But I would love to camp,

B.122:  # Yes.  #

A.123:  # in # the mountains. 

B.124:  Estes State Park is fantastic. 

A.125:  That's what my girlfriend says.  Yes, she loves that place. 

B.126:  See, you need to go there. 

A.127:  She loves that.  She says that where we need to go sometime. 

B.128:  It is.  It's, you know, it's, it's high canyon and, uh, and there's this
little mountain lakes and it's very peaceful. 

A.129:  Oh. 

B.130:  And, um, in, in the early fall time,

A.131:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.132:  # um, # I can't remember what type of trees they are, but they, all the
leaves turn yellow,

A.133:  # Oh.  #

B.134:  # and # it's just brilliant.  And,

A.135:  I love that. 

B.136:  Yes, you would.  You'd like it very much. 

A.137:  That's neat.  That's neat. 

B.138:  I know you would. 

A.139:  I used to go camping all the time as a, a Girl Scout. 

B.140:  I was too [laughter]. 

A.141:  [Laughter]  All the time.  I got real used to it then. 

B.142:  Yeah. 

A.143:  I felt like we roughed it then [laughter]. 

B.144:  Uh, well we did, you know, we really did.  I mean, I just don't understand
these people that think taking an R V,

A.145:  # Right.  #

B.146:  # and # parking it and sitting inside and watching T V,

A.147:  # Yes.  #

B.148:  # and # having your microwave [laughter], 

A.149:  # [Laughter]  Exactly.  #

B.150:  # It's not # camping. 

A.151:  I mean, we had to make the fires and dig latrines [laughter]  and
everything. 

B.152:  Right, right.  I mean that is it [laughter]. 

A.153:  [Laughter]  You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff,

B.154:  # Right.  #

A.155:  # to # really be camping [laughter]. 

B.156:  [Laughter]  Oh. 

A.157:  Yeah.  Well do you, you, you say you haven't been in years?

B.158:  No, I haven't.  I'm, um, I'm a struggling single mom. 

A.159:  # Oh, gosh, bless your heart.  #

B.160:  # and, uh, [laughter]  thank you.  #

A.161:  [Laughter]. 

B.162:  Um, it's, you know, time is precious, money's precious. 

A.163:  Yes. 

B.164:  Um, and i-, i-, it, it, I think I haven't been able to do it, and, you 
know, what, that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my
children,

A.165:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.166:  # you know, # again.  And th-, I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just
women. 

A.167:  I don't blame you. 

B.168:  You know?

A.169:  I don't blame you at all. 

B.170:  I hope,

A.171:  Years ago it would have been fine but,

B.172:  Yes, I, I really now, n-, n-, I, I have gone on one little vacation, just
the girls and I.  We drove down to Port Aransas,

A.173:  # Oh.  #

B.174:  # and # rented a little efficiency, you know,

A.175:  # Yeah.  #

B.176:  # and, # and had a marvelous like two nights,

A.177:  # Yeah.  #

B.178:  # and # that was great.  And even at that, it, it was like the first time
that I ventured,

A.179:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.180:  # you # know, out of the city by myself.  And, and, you know, I, I stayed 
in a nice place.  But it's still, it's real different not to have another adult
with you. 

A.181:  Yes.  I kn-,

B.182:  # You know.  #

A.183:  # I can # imagine. 

B.184:  I'm just a chicken. 

A.185:  [Laughter]. 

B.186:  I know lots of women would do it all the [laughter]  time. 

A.187:  No [laughter].  I don't blame you, not nowadays. 

B.188:  I haven't quite adjusted, you know?

@@A.189:  Yeah.  Now are you with T I down there?

B.190:  Well, I, I was with T I until January.  I, uh, I left T I in January hoping
to strike out and find a job where I could make some money. 

A.191:  Good. 

B.192:  So, well it's,

A.193:  Have you? [laughter]. 

B.194:  It was a good plan but I haven't yet [laughter]. 

A.195:  Okay. 

B.196:  I got into sales, and,

A.197:  # Oh.  #

B.198:  # I'm # selling, uh, telephone systems. 

A.199:  Oh, that's neat. 

B.200:  And it's, it's fun and it's interesting, but it's also, um, pretty
challenging, and I haven't, I haven't started making money yet. 

A.201:  Um.  It's hard isn't it?

B.202:  So, yeah, it's, it's hard [child]. 

A.203:  Now, how old are your girls?

B.204:  Eleven and fourteen. 

A.205:  Oh, goodness. 

B.206:  Yeah.  So I'm old [laughter]. 

A.207:  No, you're not old [laughter]. 

B.208:  [Laughter]. 

A.209:  [Child_talking]  {saying, Who is it?} You're not old at all. 

B.210:  Well, excuse me just second. 

A.211:  Sure. 

B.212:  {B speaks to someone} Honey, I'll be wi-, yeah, go ahead.  {Background
voice, Okay.}  There's someone at the door. 

A.213:  Oh, okay.  Do you need to go?

B.214:  Well, um, I'm going to listen.  We always check and see if we should answer
the door,

A.215:  # Yeah.  #

B.216:  # at # night. 

A.217:  That's very smart. 

B.218:  Yeah so, well, I've enjoyed this. 

A.219:  Yeah, me too. 

B.220:  And, uh,

A.221:  And good luck.  How many have you made so far, calls?

B.222:  I, I haven't made any.  I've been just a recipient [laughter]. 

A.223:  Oh, have you? They're all, this is only about my second one I've ever made.
I've been a recipient on the others.  How many have you had so far, do you
know?

B.224:  I think I've had about four. 

A.225:  Four, that's good. 

B.226:  Ye-, yeah. 

A.227:  Very good. 

B.228:  That's four each.  Well, you know, when I had to sup-, this is my, my
Gemini nature, you know, it's like what are you interested in,

A.229:  # Yes.  #

B.230:  # and # it's like virtually anything.  I'll talk about anything to anybody
[laughter]. 

A.231:  Yeah.  I don't, yeah, you bet, you bet. 

B.232:  And it's, it's been real interesting, the different personalities
[laughter].

A.233:  I know. 

B.234:  That I run across. 

A.235:  Yes, I always try to find out where they're from,

B.236:  # Exactly.  #

A.237:  # you # know, cause, because it is neat. 

B.238:  Uh-huh. 

A.239:  It really is. 

B.240:  Uh-huh. 

A.241:  Well then, I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door and,

B.242:  Well, thank you.  And, um, I enjoyed talking with you. 

A.243:  You, me too. 

B.244:  You have a good time camping, when you go next time,

A.245:  # Thanks.  #

B.246:  # think # of me [child]. 

A.247:  Okay.  Thank you. 

B.248:  All right. 

A.249:  Bye-bye. 

B.250:  Bye-bye.
