=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what's your views on it?

B.2:  I, personally, feel like as long as the Soviet Union exists, it's going to
be a threat to the United States. 

A.3:  Sure. 

B.4:  And,

A.5:  An anybody that's got that much military might is going to be a threat. 

B.6:  That's right, and I think that we've made a lot of strides in the last
several years with them but I don't feel like that we can ever turn our back
on them and,

A.7:  #Um, not yet.#

B.8:  #no, I, I# just think that,

A.9:  Course, we're in a good position, they're, they're quite dependent on us
right now,

B.10:  #Yeah.#

A.11:  #but# that doesn't necessarily mean anything but, I don't know, I,

B.12:  And I, I have to wonder sometimes how much of their dependence is, um, you
know, it's, it's sort of a false dependence just to, while they're building
their own, uh, way of doing things, that they're making us think that they
depend that much on us so that we don't watch them more closely, you know. 

A.13:  Well, I don't know, I,

B.14:  I'm very suspicious of them. 

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  I mean, first and forem-, I mean, everybody loves Gorby but,

B.18:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.19:  You know tha-, the one thing they have to keep in mind, he's a communist. 

B.20:  #That's right.#

A.21:  #and communists# have their own little ideology about the way things are
going to be.  I think, I think they're in pretty bad shape right now an-, and I
think their, I think their reliance on us is, is probably real.  Course, that's
not to say that once we get them on their feet again things won't go back the
way they were. 

B.22:  That's right. 

A.23:  So, I don't know. 

B.24:  And I, you know, they, they want to know what it would take to convince us
that they aren't a threat and I don't know that there's anything that can be
done to convince us of that because, you know, we just see how if you let your
guard down in any situation how, you know, how quickly that Persian Gulf
situation arose. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  Um, I don't, I don't think that, that we can ever be convinced, as a
country, that, that they're going to change or, you know, not be a threat. 

A.27:  Well only unless they change their form of government. 

B.28:  Yeah, and even, even the strides that were made toward that,

A.29:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.30:  #though,# you know, Gorbachev seems to have, {pause} he seems to have lost
his steam in, in that direction and, you know, he seems to be repressing his
own people again and I don't think that, I think that a lot of the, the
forward progress that was made came to a halt, you know, in the middle of that
Persian gro-, Gulf crisis.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well it's going to be interesting in the next few years
to see what happens cause there's quite a strong democratic, um, um, group
over there.

B.32:  Yeah, see so many of them have gotten a taste of, of democracy and they're
kind of in between right now, they're, they're not, uh, they're not getting
the benefits of being a democratic place,

A.33:  #Uh-huh.#

B.34:  #but# they, they know what they are and, uh, the country tells them that,
you know, this is what it's like to be a democracy and they're still hurting. 

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  So, you know, they're getting, I guess, the worst of all worlds right now. 

A.37:  Yeah.  Well there was a interesting cartoon in the editorial the other day.
It was a, there was a picture of a shop keeper with this really mean look on
his face and empty shelves in back of him and a little rat and a couple of
spider webs,

B.38:  #[Laughter] Ugh.#

A.39:  #and a# couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well, we have
the worst of both worlds, communism and capitalism. 

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  That's true. 

A.43:  But, you know, I, I, I think that, I think, or at least I hope, tha-, they
understood that's what was going to happen.  Now, you can't go from a, a
communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight. 

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  It's just like Poland. 

B.46:  And East Germany. 

A.47:  And East Germany. 

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  I mean, the only saving grace for East Germany is that West Germany had
lots of money,

B.50:  #That's right.#

A.51:  #and, uh,# they're bailing them out on everything but even, even now the
West Germans are grumbling,

B.52:  #Uh-huh.#

A.53:  #you# know, which I, I would hope they had thought about that while they
were busily engaged in tearing down the wall,

B.54:  #Right.#

A.55:  #I# mean, they talk about unification, unification, and now they're
unified, and now all they can do is gripe [laughter]. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  But, oh well, I don't know. 

B.58:  It's one of those things that all looks good on paper but putting it into
reality,

A.59:  #Yeah.#

B.60:  #is# a whole different ball game. 

A.61:  Yeah, I know we, we've shoveled so much aid to Poland and, I don't know, of
course, you don't hear, hear the bad things out of there like you used to,

B.62:  #That's true.#

A.63:  #but it# doesn't mean they're not going on,

B.64:  #That's right.#

A.65:  #it just# means the press decided to cover something else [music]  {in
background}.

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  Of course, you know, you always wonder about the information you're getting
anyway. 

B.68:  That's right.  I, you know, that's another thing, the news media in the, in
the Soviet Union, I wouldn't trust them either, you know. 

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  I wouldn't trust them to se-, to send, send a story about the United States
to their people correctly. 

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  And, uh,

A.73:  There has been a lot more openness. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  Um, we can only hope that, that continues and it's a precursor of things to
come. 

B.76:  I think our next biggest threat is the Ja-, Japanese. 

A.77:  Yeah, [laughter]  yeah, first economic battle we've ever been involved in. 

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  Yea-, it's like our car industry and it would have, it would, it would have
gone under a long time ago if it hadn't have been for the Japanese helping us
out,

B.80:  #Yeah.#

A.81:  #and# I guess they, they feel a bit ashamed they've done so well
[laughter].

B.82:  Yeah,

A.83:  Well here's the poor United States, they helped us get on our feet so let's
help them [laughter]. 

B.84:  [Laughter]. 

A.85:  It's amazing.  We got a lot of problems here too, I d-, mean. 

B.86:  Yeah.  And, and I have a real problem with the government, you know, giving
away things to the, the other countries that have as, as much ability to to do
harm to us as anyone. 

A.87:  Uh-huh. 

B.88:  And, you know, like giving them pla-, plans for the, some of the, uh, top
secret aircraft that we have and,

A.89:  #Yeah.#

B.90:  #things# like that, I mean that's ridiculous.  That is only asking for
trouble. 

A.91:  Well, it's like, it's like Saddam, you know, we're going to build them up
and then have to go in there and take care of them. 

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  So. 

B.94:  That's exactly right. 

@@A.95:  Well, gosh, I can't think of anything else. 

B.96:  Nope, me either. 

A.97:  Well, I guess that will about do it. 

B.98:  Okay. 

A.99:  Good talking to you. 

B.100:  Same here.  Have a good weekend. 

A.101:  You too.  Bye-bye. 

B.102:  Bye-bye.
