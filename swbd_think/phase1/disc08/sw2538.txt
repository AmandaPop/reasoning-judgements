===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Some of the political trends that have started up, I guess in, uh, the
other side of the ocean as it were, some of the, uh, revolutions and desires
for change that's going on over there.  When that first started going on there
was a politician in the U S, I don't even remember his name but, uh, he made
a, a not so widely publicized comment that said, just wait awhile and see how
much U S aid ends up going that way,

B.3:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.4:  and, and, he thought or predicted that Poland would be one of the first
ones to start seeing, uh, both in forms of debt forgiven and, uh, actual
dollar values given over to them.  And they took a little while but sure
enough some of that stuff is coming about.  Uh, so, I don't know if that's
going to be an ongoing trend that we're going to start helping this country
and that country and breaking our own backs as it were.  What do you think?

B.5:  Well, I think that's, uh, a, you know, valid observation that, uh, anytime
that a company, that a country appears to be, uh, moving in the same direction
that the United States, uh, thinks is the right direction that they tend to
get more, you know, more, uh, more aid from, from our government then they
would have before or the other governments do.  Um, I suppose that's a, as
valid a way of determining who gets aid is as anything although I'm not sure
that, uh, us giving aid is the right, uh, right thing for our government to be
doing.

A.6:  Uh-huh. 

B.7:  Um, I think it's kind of ironic that from my, you know, from my observation
anyway that, that we're, uh, rewarding other governments for becoming more
democratic in following more capitalistic approaches whereas in our own
economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs.

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  And, you know, away from the capitalistic approach so it's kind of like,
you know, we're moving in the, in a kind of direction toward each other.

A.10:  Yeah, that's interesting. 

B.11:  Uh, you know, I mean, that's my own observation anyway.

A.12:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think over the, well, goodness I guess you
could go back as far as Roosevelt,

B.13:  Right.  

A.14:  and say that the social programs have certainly gone up,

B.15:  Right {very faint}.  Yeah.  

A.16:  and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems
to be that the governments, or the norm, has become that they would desire
that the governments say yeah, that we deserve this so you will provide this,

B.17:  Right.

A.18:  this is part of the old happiness aspect. 

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  That's a, that's an interesting thought that they're ready to be a
socialist and they're headed to be democratic and maybe we're capitalist and
maybe the two will meet in the middle and, and agree I, I don't know.

B.21:  And I'm not sure that, uh, that I would even think at this point that
somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because, uh, I mean, if
there's, if the something, what we wind up with is more socialistic than what
we have now then I'm not sure that it's the right thing.  It's, there, I think
we have too much, too many social programs.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  Uh, it's a social programs without the corresponding responsibility {very
faint}.  Yes.

A.24:  Right, that does seem to be a problem that even the Poles faced when, uh, I
think they're one of the earliest experimenters in, in trying to get a
capitalist, uh, economy going and some of the things that showed up is, um, I
hate the term worth it, work ethic, but that seems to be the one that's tied
to it,

B.25:  Right.

A.26:  that some of the Poles just didn't know it.  I meant to get up in the
morning and, you know, be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it
or, you know, a little bit of work here and work there,

B.27:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.28:  give it a taste, instead of just stamp the clock, stamp the clock, and
forget about it give me my paycheck.

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  Um, though there are jobs, of course, that exist that way here, uh, they
don't,

B.31:  [Cough].

A.32:  they don't, they're not labeled C E O,

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  you know, they're, they're, uh, assembly line type jobs and they didn't
have that worth it, ec-, ethic and here we're headed towards socializing to
the extent that there's a whole welfare population that doesn't have it.

B.35:  Right.  Uh, I,

A.36:  So, but that's an interesting, uh, merging as it were, of the two ideas.
We're going one way and they're going the other.

B.37:  I noticed in, uh, an article in the paper, where, I didn't read the whole
article but the headlines anyway indicated that there's a, a seems to be a
consensus among small and medium size business owners that the, uh, the output
of the American worker is on the decline, you know, pretty severely but, uh,

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  the outputs really suffering and I think that's, you know, that's another
indication that, that we're headed in the wrong direction.

A.40:  Right.

B.41:  Uh, and I think, uh, I think rewards for a job well done are, are, are
necessary and I, I think that we, I guess we have a tendency to as, you know,
as managers of companies or owners of companies they have a tendency to try to
get as much out of the employee as they can and not give as much as they can.

A.42:  Right.

B.43:  You know, in return I, uh, I, I think that, that there, there needs to be
some give-and-take in both, you know, on both sides of the, of the picture
there.

A.44:  I don't know if it would be a political trend or not to, to, uh,
[breathing] consider the problem of the, well, I guess it, it is a matter of,
at least the government's causing it there's, there's so much more paperwork
in most every job, I mean, the poor teacher can't get their jobs done,

B.45:  Right.

A.46:  for the reports and the things that the government requires,

B.47:  Right. 

A.48:  and, and, uh, the whole defense industry issue of having so many layers
of management just to handle the paperwork and,

B.49:  Well, uh, you know, even the police, uh, have a lot of paperwork to do.
Uh, I observed a, I didn't actually see the accident but, uh, the ro-, the
aftermath of a three car accident yesterday here in Richardson, and I was
going into the public library, and apparently the accident had just, you know,
recently happened then but there was a policeman there, policewoman there,

A.50:  Uh-huh. 

B.51:  uh, taking down the information, and I was in the library a good thirty
minutes and came back out, and she was still sitting in the police car,
((there)), you know, the accident,

A.52:  Right.

B.53:  participants were gone but she was sitting there filling out paperwork,
you know, so,

A.54:  Huh.

B.55:  you know, it took her thirty minutes plus to, to handle one traffic
accident and, uh,

A.56:  Yep, the more cars the merrier the paperwork [laughter].

B.57:  Right.  And, you know, I think that's, uh, just a, a kind of an indication,
the paperwork, the, the amount of information that the government wants even
about a traffic accident, you know, is,

A.58:  Yeah. 

B.59:  so much that, uh, you know, we get bogged down and things like that.

A.60:  I wonder if they waive that when, uh, some of these horrendously large
pileups occur in California like you hear these twenty and thirty ((car)),

B.61:  Yeah. 

A.62:  boy, couldn't you imagine doing the paperwork on that, take an Army of
officers just to do the paperwork [laughter].

B.63:  Okay, well, that just sounds like I got another phone call trying to come
in so.

A.64:  All righty, I'll let you go then.

B.65:  Anyway it's been interesting.  Thank you.

A.66:  Um bye.

B.67:  Bye.
