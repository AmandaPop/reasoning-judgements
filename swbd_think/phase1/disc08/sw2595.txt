=============================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, have you got any repairs done by auto shops on your car or do you
do maintenance work, or what?

B.2:  I, uh, try to do what I can and, uh, we have two vehicles, uh, and, uh, on
the Honda, which is the [children] older vehicle, I try to do as much as I can
on that.  On our newer one, uh, uh, mini vans, it's all electronic and
computers and everything in it.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Still, still under warrantee, right?

B.4:  Yeah.  Uh, well, some things are, some things aren't, you know. 

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Not everything's covered by [laughter] warrantee.  I don't try to mess with
that at all.  I mean, I, I can change the oil and,

A.7:  Do you do any, uh, body work on the Honda?

B.8:  Uh, no, no.  I do have a place that's rusting.  I need to get something on
it. 

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  Put some paint on it or something to stop the rust, like scrape it and
paint it.

A.11:  Yeah, scrape it and paint it.  Put primer on it then paint it. 

B.12:  Right, right. 

A.13:  Don't put paint over else it'll just continue rusting under. 

B.14:  Right, I know.  If you don't get the rust off that's there already that
it's just going to continue on.  But, yeah I'm just sitting here looking at my
Honda manual when I got your call.

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  I got the,

A.17:  So you, you're ready to talk about it? 

B.18:  Yeah, yeah, right [breathing].  The, uh,

A.19:  Do you, so you change, like you change your own oil and oil filters,

B.20:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do my own brake, brake work on the Honda.  I just {pause}
finished, finished working on the brakes. 

A.21:  I, I mean I, yeah.  I, I know where you're coming from because I do the, I
do the minor things to my car, that but I don't,

B.22:  Right, right.  Not the, things I know how to do.  I, I'm not an expert.  I
don't,

A.23:  # Right, exactly I was about to say.# 

B.24:  # claim to be.  #

A.25:  Yeah, I just do what I can.  I don't really, you know, I don't, it's like
the simple things, changing the oil, checking the fluids, you know,

B.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.27:  # rotating # tires,

B.28:  # Right.  #

A.29:  # things # like that, that you don't need heavy equipment for. 

B.30:  Right.  Seems anymore you need special tools to do a lot of jobs, you know,
and, and, I'm afraid I'll get something take it, taken apart and not remember
how to [laughter]  get it back together, and then I'd be in big trouble. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  I do know a couple good shade tree mechanics and I call them once in a
while for advice and once in a while they'll come over and say, Oh, this is
how you do it, you know, and I try to learn [breathing].

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  But I think a lot of people learn how to do maintenance from whether their
father did it.  You know, my dad didn't do much at all, and he doesn't know
much about cars and as a result I really didn't have that much interest to
learn how to maintain, fix and maintain cars.  So I didn't learn much growing
up and I just after I, we bought the cars, you know, and things got so
expensive to take them someplace all the time that I decided that I better
start learning, you know.

A.35:  Yeah, because things go wrong and you don't know what the hell's going on
and you don't --

B.36:  Right. 

A.37:  -- you don't know where to start. 

B.38:  That's right. 

A.39:  And that's where it costs money. 

B.40:  Well, yeah.  That's, that's when I call some friends or something or
sometimes I just take it to a place, you know, and they'll tell me what's
wrong and I'll say, and I'll say, Oh, it'll be this much money and I'll say,
Oh, well I'm going to think about that.  That sounds like too much [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  Right now and so, you know, I got to think about that so they'll put it
back together [children], I'll take it home, and then I'll fix it myself.
Sometimes they charge you, you know, if it's a diagnosis problem.

A.43:  Right. 

B.44:  Some places do, some don't. 

A.45:  Those are electronical, # diagnostics.  #

B.46:  # Right # [talking].  Just depends, you know, how long, how long it takes
them to figure it out if they can just tell right away by just listening to
it.  And then they're usually going to charge you, you know.

A.47:  Yeah, I have a, a fuel injected engine, so I don't do anything to the
engine, you know, it's like,

B.48:  Right.  They're pretty tricky. 

A.49:  I don't, I don't want to mess with it because since I don't know exactly
all the ratios, you know, and everything that all the proportions, the fuel
and air, and compression and all that stuff --

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  -- that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer.  I figure I
won't mess with that [laughter].

B.52:  Right.  That's how I figure on those things.  It's just not worth the,
[breathing] worth it [children]. 

A.53:  But, I mean, I play with everything else that, you know, that's not too
serious, you know, you can bend it one way and you bend it right back, or, you
know, turn it [laughter].

B.54:  Right, right. 

A.55:  Just as long as, as, like you were saying it's not too hard to take apart
and put back together, [laughter]  I'll try it. 

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Right.  Now that we have two cars I'm not as scared to play with,
play around, because we always have the other car.  Seems like I, before I
would get the car all apart and realize I needed a part, you know.  And so I'm
calling all the neighbors and stuff trying to get them to give me a ride down
to get my part, you know, because I don't have another car [laughter].  So now
that we have two cars, I, I'm not, I'm less leery about just going for it.

A.57:  Have you had any body work done on your car?

B.58:  Um, no, no, I haven't had any problem,

A.59:  That stuff is expensive. 

B.60:  Yeah, I know.  I had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted
like three hundred bucks. 

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  I said for-, [laughter].  I can live with it, you know if the car's --

A.63:  That,

B.64:  -- ten years old. 

A.65:  Yeah.  I went, I went, uh, I got in a wreck recently, and, uh, well I
didn't do much damage to my car but I did some pretty heavy duty damage to the
other car.  I have a plastic bumper, and I happened to hit the rim of the tire
so it made like a little semicircular incision on my plastic bumper,

B.66:  On your plastic bumper?

A.67:  Right.  And, and, and, kind of put little fissures on the, on the paint of
the bumper because it's plastic so when it bent, you know, when the plastic
bent, it kind of cracked. 

B.68:  Right. 

A.69:  To, to change that bumper covering [children]  of the plastic cover was
going to run me five hundred bucks. 

B.70:  Whoa.  That's on the other car or your car?

A.71:  On my car. 

B.72:  Is that right?

A.73:  That, just to change the cover, you know, because, do, just had to get the,
that whole cover, my, my car's a Beretta. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  They had a big, big bumper they got on there, big white bumper that covers
like the whole bottom front of the car.  That, that whole thing, you know, to
be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars.  And I got this guy
to, uh, to this, this, uh, company, I don't know if you ever heard of Maaco
Auto Body Shop,

B.76:  Yeah, I've heard of them.  The chain. 

A.77:  I got the, I talked to the owner and he said that the best thing to do if I
wanted to save money was, uh, to just go ahead and since there was no major
damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the, where
the, uh, rim hit, with some like bondo or something and then paint over it and
it would look just like new for only two hundred bucks.  So I did that
instead.  But, and, it, you can't tell.  You can't tell the difference, you
know,

B.78:  # Is that right? #

A.79:  # It just looks # like a brand new bumper. 

B.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.81:  And it, hey, I saved three hundred bucks [laughter]. 

B.82:  Yeah.  Well, you're a student, right?

A.83:  Right. 

B.84:  So that's important [laughter]. 

A.85:  Very important. 

B.86:  Yeah, yeah.  It seems anymore, the cars are, they want so much to work on a
car.  They, we've had our car in the dealer, or our van, and they want, they
charge, like, forty-five dollars an hour labor.  I think golly that's,

A.87:  Yeah.  I think that's ridiculous, isn't it?

B.88:  Yeah, I, I,

A.89:  Forty-five dollars.  I mean, [breathing]  people, people get out of college
and work for less than that, uh, [breathing]. 

B.90:  Right.  Well, the mechanic doesn't see that, you know.  It's the owner or
the dealer,

A.91:  # Yeah.  #

B.92:  # who # sees, who sees the big bucks.  Mechanic probably gets about
[static] twenty dollars an hour, so.  Yeah.  The thing about automobiles,
they're so unpredictable, too, you know.  They're hard to, hard to plan ahead
for, for things.

A.93:  Yeah, like that commercial that you plan for, uh, the car, new car,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # second # garage, but you didn't plan on breaking down [breathing]. 

B.96:  Right. 

A.97:  Ever see that commercial?

B.98:  No, I haven't seen that one. 

A.99:  It's, it's pretty good.  It's, I think it's, um, a bank commercial or
something like that. 

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  And, uh, it just kind of flashes out these, uh, partial sentences, like,
you planned on, and it says, a new garage, second car, and then all a sudden
the music in the background changes and it says, but you didn't plan on it
breaking down [breathing].

B.102:  [Laughter]  That's true, that's true.  I mean it's hard to, you know, it's
hard to say, Oh, I should set aside this much money for repairs on cars because
you never know, it could cost you nothing or it could cost you three times as
much. 

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  It's hard to plan for those things [noise].  And when you need to have it
fixed, you know, a lot of times you can't just take it all over town if it, uh,
you know. 

A.105:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.106:  Sometime you can, but on some things it's, you're just stuck and you got to
have it towed somewhere or something.  You just got to [noise] got to make a
quick decision [laughter].  I don't know.  I don't trust a lot of people who
work on your cars, too.  I know this one guy that works for dealerships as a,
you know, they, at dealerships, they replace things, they don't fix things.

A.107:  That's, that's, uh, that's one thing about dealerships is you don't, I
don't think you get the real quality work at [noise] dealerships because they
have to work with so many cars it just kind of,

B.108:  Right.  So they'd just rather replace something and charge you for the new
part rather than just, you know, fixing the part. 

A.109:  Right. 

B.110:  And the part could be probably fixed, you know, for a third of the price
of, of a new one.  But they, that's, dealers don't do that [laughter].

A.111:  Yeah.  They want as much money as they can. 

B.112:  Oh, sure, sure they do.  And then they take your old part and sell it to
some reconditioning house and make money off of that, too. 

A.113:  Yeah. 

B.114:  You know.  So, anyways.  Well, we got to, got to have cars in this society.
Not like, uh, Europe and Japan and some other countries where they have good
enough public transportation where you can just get anywhere you need, need,

A.115:  # Yeah.  But I think, #

B.116:  # need to go, anytime # you need to get there. 

A.117:  Yeah, I think, uh, I think public transportation will move up though in the
future. 

B.118:  Well, I hope so. 

A.119:  I mean, I think we pretty much phased out the bus. 

B.120:  Right. 

A.121:  But, I think maybe, uh, you know, um, like subways --

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  -- you know, public transportation such as subways and monorails will
probably come in. 

B.124:  Right, right, but it, it's going to be a while, I think but,

A.125:  Well, yeah, I mean, not, nothing like in the next ten years --

B.126:  Right. 

A.127:  -- but more like in the next fifty to a hundred [children]. 

B.128:  Yeah.  If I had a car, uh, uh, a bus,
