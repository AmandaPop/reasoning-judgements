============================================================================

A.1:  Um, what is your experience been with, but do you have elderly relatives
that live with you or have lived with your parents or something like that?

B.2:  No.  Um, my husband has a grandmother in a nursing home. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And that has been a real mess to say the least.  But, uh, they kee-, seem
to keep moving her in and out of different ones that they had just got done
moving her, uh, into another one because the one she was in they gave her some
medication she was definitely allergic to and almost killed her.

A.5:  Oh, gosh. 

B.6:  And, and, and it was posted, you know, above her bed not to give her
penicillin and, but,

A.7:  # And they gave it to her anyway.  #

B.8:  # but, but they gave it to her # anyway and jus-, she just about died. 

A.9:  We had, my grandfather had Alz-, Alzheimer's disease,

B.10:  # Um.  #

A.11:  # and, # my grandmother kept him at home as long as she could. 

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  Actually, my parents and my uncle and aunt who tried to convince them to go
into like an old age community,

B.14:  # Yeah.  #

A.15:  # where # he could have gotten care and she could of had help with somebody
cleaning and things like that --

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  -- and she refused. 

B.18:  (( )).

A.19:  She, she just didn't want to do it, she felt, uh,

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # I # don't know.  Maybe too much guilt or something. 

B.22:  Yeah.  I, I don-, I don't feel who, uh, my husband's grandmother is that
bad off and they, they offered, you know, to get, to hire, you know, an, a
roommate or, uh,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # or # a part time nurse and she just wouldn't have it at all. 

A.25:  And so, eventually, they were forced,

B.26:  # They, they were, #

A.27:  # to put her # in ((one)).

B.28:  forced to put her in a nursing,

A.29:  # Yeah.  #

B.30:  # home.  #

A.31:  Well, my grand father, you know, eventually, completely, lost --

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  -- control type of things.  I, I mean, I don't know if he ever really got
violent but they put him in a nursing home and actually the problem
[breathing] that they had with him was more with the hospital, the, the
nursing home, you know, some day he had a fever or something so they sent him
to a hospital which is,

B.34:  # Yeah.  #

A.35:  # what # they seem to routinely do which I think is ridiculous too. 

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  You know, because they might not be really be sick.  And at the hospital
they, um, did an electrocardiogram. 

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  And decided that he had a heart problem and, uh, you know --

B.40:  Oh, my. 

A.41:  -- you know, he was very old, he had Alzheimer's, he had been like a
vegetable for a year,

B.42:  # Yeah.  #

A.43:  # and # the hospital said, oh, we have to put in a pacemaker and,

B.44:  # Oh.  #

A.45:  # you # know, wanted to prov-, approval,

B.46:  # Oh, boy.  #

A.47:  # for the # it and all this sort stuff.  And eventually, you know, the
whole family is in an uproar discussing it and some of these,

B.48:  # Oh.  #

A.49:  # said, # well, yeah, they should do it and others said it's ridiculous
this man's, you know, his body finally wants to die, just let him die.

B.50:  Yes. 

A.51:  And, um, eventually, the, at the, they said, no, to the doctor. 

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  And they found out it wasn't even his electrocardiogram, it,

B.54:  # Oh, #

A.55:  # it # was some,

B.56:  my gosh. 

A.57:  other patient.  You know, by the time he had been sent back to the nursing
home and under care there. 

B.58:  It,

A.59:  # But.  #

B.60:  # it # tears a part families.  It,

A.61:  # Oh.  #

B.62:  # really, # it, it, it just, the biggest fights,

A.63:  It's horrible. 

B.64:  jus-, It, it, it is because of that.  I mean, that, that will divide yo-,
divide brother and centers quicker than anything,

A.65:  # But, #

B.66:  # is, #

A.67:  sometimes you just can't keep the person at home.  They're just --

B.68:  Oh, that's true,

A.69:  -- you know. 

B.70:  But, but the nursing home situation is such a, is such a pitiful situation.
I mean if you just, if you go, every time we go visit her it's just, it's just
gut wrenching,

A.71:  # Oh.  #

B.72:  # to # me. 

A.73:  I ((felt,)) went to visit my grandfather one time in the nursing home and I
said never again.  I said I just can't go. 

B.74:  I, I can-, I, I, I can't hardly handle it myself. 

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  And, uh, it's, it's,

A.77:  But I had a cousin of mine that was in a different nursing home which was
sort of nicer,

B.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.79:  # you # know, and until, really, close to the end she was able to go out
and take walks and things and they took her outside.  And in some ways I think
it might of even been better, or I say cousins like my grandmother's cousin,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # but # I had been really close to her. 

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  And it's only, the thing for her it might of even been better because she
used to live in an area that when she moved down there was mostly elderly
people. 

B.84:  Oh, really. 

A.85:  Well, not, you know, it was like a community of apartments that were mostly
elderly.  When she moved there she might have been like sixty.  It wasn't, you
know, like ancient but --

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  -- you know, older and then that community for some reason started getting
the apartments were fairly low income I guess. 

B.88:  Yeah. 

A.89:  And started being bought out by families and things.  And she, instead of
having fewer and fewer friends. 

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  And people, just, she, she, she used to say to me, at, when she was
ninety-two or something at the time,

B.92:  # Oh, my [laughter].  #

A.93:  # say, um, you # know, I just, I, all my friends have died off.  I have
nothing to do.  I'm bored. 

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  You know, I walk over to the store, I walk back, someone comes and picks me
up and brings me to the ((community)). And so when she went to a nursing home,
in the beginning, I think she kind of liked it.  She did art work there, she
did --

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  -- it was almost a progressive type nursing home. 

B.98:  Well, if you're not in real bad shape it's, it's, you know, a ret-, a
retirement home is, is, is a good idea for somebody like that. 

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  But, uh, if you've got a lot of health problems --

A.101:  Yeah, then you just can't get,

B.102:  -- # it, it,#

A.103:  # better.  #

B.104:  it's just, it's a, it's just a big huge mess because, because my husband's
grandmother has a lot of health problems. 

A.105:  Uh-huh. 

B.106:  And, uh, and his, like his other grandparents on his other side those were
in a nursing home and his grand, his other, his dad's mother finally went into
a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before, before
she passed away.  And that, that was awful.

A.107:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm sure. 

B.108:  And, and, um,

A.109:  Does the medical care in nursing is typically less than,

B.110:  Pitiful.  It, it, it's, it's,

A.111:  In, but are they supposed to give as much help as,

B.112:  # Well, well, #

A.113:  # you know # a,

B.114:  well, what, what they do is, is they're supposed to monitor them but they
don't monitor them very well at all.  I mean, that, that's the problem.  Uh,
his grandmother that's in it now, she had a stroke and they didn't catch it
for three days.

A.115:  Jeez. 

B.116:  If you can imagine such a thing.  So that, so then that, she, that was when
she got moved from the first one to the second one [laughter]. 

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  Where she was given penicillin. 

A.119:  At the second one?

B.120:  At the second one.  And now,

A.121:  # Oh, my.  #

B.122:  # she's at # the third one [laughter]. 

A.123:  That's,

B.124:  # So it's,#

A.125:  # horrible.  #

B.126:  It, it, it, it's been a really bad situation.  But I have, but that's all I
hear about nursing homes is bad situations. 

A.127:  Had they checked into these nursing homes much before they put her in it or
they just sort of, I mean, I, it's sometimes hard to even get places in there. 
You're lucky if you get a spot. 

B.128:  Well, that, yes.  That, that's true.  But, um, they're in a smaller, small
area and, our, in, in fact they're over, up in Missouri,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # an-, # an-, an-, and what I would, you would really consider a rural area
an-, where there is like one nursing home per town. 

A.131:  Oh, so you probably don't have too much choice. 

B.132:  Yes.  Oh, no, no, there's, there is not a whole lot of choice.  So they've,
they've moved through three different towns now. 

A.133:  Uh-huh. 

B.134:  So, um,

A.135:  But really it's pitiful. 

B.136:  It is.  And it, the regu-, I don't think the gov-, the government
regulations are the place, I, I don't think are, are adequate either.  Because
they just don't, the ones I've been in just don't, aren't real real clean, uh,
you know, they do, they do a halfway decent job but I, it seems like they're,
they're they tend to be kind of slack. 

A.137:  Often times I've gone into nursing homes where, you know, they have like a
central area where they take the people to and all,

B.138:  # Leave them.  #

A.139:  # you do # is just sort of sit there like --

B.140:  Yes. 

A.141:  -- you know, almost like they're mentally,

B.142:  # Vegetables.  #

A.143:  # retarded # patients or something.  And some of them, you know, they're
just sort of sitting in the wheelchair and sleeping,

B.144:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.145:  # or # whatever and it's, it's heart breaking. 

B.146:  I know. 

A.147:  You know, and I, I feel like, you know, what have I moved into and, and
they're --

B.148:  ((I know, it's)).

A.149:  -- you, some of them I think just needs stimulation. 

B.150:  Yeah.  I mean, it's almost like a mental hospital atmosphere,

A.151:  # Yeah.  #

B.152:  # instead # of a nursing home. 

A.153:  Well, I've never been to a mental hospital. 

B.154:  Well, me neither but, but,

A.155:  # (( )). #

B.156:  # it just # seems like that's what it would be like. 

A.157:  Right.  Like you expect from the movies of mental hospitals.  Like, uh,

B.158:  Like, uh, [laughter].  One time Rick went and, uh, I wen-, I didn't go with
him and his grandmother was sitting there and she said that man across the hall
is naked, and he was, he was sitting in his wheelchair stark naked. 

A.159:  Oh, gosh. 

B.160:  He had, he'd got himself undressed and, and he just, he just like to sit in
his wheelchair naked [laughter].  That's not funny but it was funny at the
time. 

A.161:  Yeah, (( )) because the, I mean the poor man too,

B.162:  # Yeah.  #

A.163:  # ((  )).# He could get really cold, he could,

B.164:  Yeah.  It was in the, it was in the summer at, at, at, at the time but you
think they would pay more attention to what was going on, that they'd see this
guy had taken off his clothes. 

A.165:  That's crazy.  But I think,

B.166:  # Oh.  #

A.167:  # they're # almost, I mean, I can't imagine working in a nursing home like
that.  I'd be there,

B.168:  # Oh, #

A.169:  # because # it must be so,

B.170:  no. 

A.171:  depressing. 

B.172:  Oh, I couldn't do it.  I just absolutely couldn't do it. 

A.173:  but, you know, when I see them I don't know that I could, you know, when I
think of my parents who fortunately shouldn't be close,

B.174:  # Oh, I know.  #

A.175:  # to getting there # yet but I don't, you know, I think of having to make
the decision as to put them into a place like that or not. 

B.176:  Me too.  That, that is what,

A.177:  # It's horrible.  #

B.178:  # scares me # to death.  Having to be in a re-, in the position like that. 
But you think, you think there could be something better than that. 

A.179:  I guess I would try and have somebody at the house as long as they were,

B.180:  # Yeah.  #

A.181:  # healthy # enough but sometimes they're --

B.182:  Yeah. 

A.183:  -- not.  I don't know.  Are you, you know, where have the old days gone
where people just sort of died of something,

B.184:  # Yeah.  #

A.185:  # in # their family houses and they're,

B.186:  # Yeah.  #

A.187:  # you # know, people,

B.188:  # Well.  #

A.189:  # are # stabbed and it's not just torture. 

B.190:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been, I've been real fortunate my families never had
anything, any-, anybody like in, in, in a nursing home. 

A.191:  Uh-huh. 

B.192:  But Rick's famil-, my husband's family really has, has, has,

A.193:  Uh, that's interesting because it's my mother's parents, well, actually my
father's parents both of them sort of, you know, they just died of something,
um,

B.194:  # Yeah, #

A.195:  # but # my grandmother, you know,

B.196:  So, yeah. 

A.197:  in my grandmother's case which is very sad, she fell.  She came into New
York to visit and she fell at the airport, going,

B.198:  # Oh, how awful.  #

A.199:  # down some steps # and spent, you know, six months in the hospital. 

B.200:  Oh. 

A.201:  But it is was still, it, it wa-, it wasn't, you know, the same as a nursing
home type of thing. 

B.202:  Right.  But still that's six,

A.203:  # Yeah.  No, #

B.204:  # months in # a hospital. 

A.205:  that was, that was horrible, it was, and she never even got to see her
family that she came into visit. 

B.206:  Oh, how --

A.207:  They,

B.208:  -- they, they never come to see, they never came to see her?

A.209:  The-, no, they came to the hospital but I mean,

B.210:  # Yeah.  But then, #

A.211:  # she came in, #

B.212:  she didn't get to go there.  Oh, I see [laughter]. 

A.213:  No, no, she came in for a pleasurable visit and --

B.214:  Oh, how awful. 

A.215:  -- fell and cracked her skull open and that was sort of,

B.216:  # Oh.  #

A.217:  # ((  )).# It was terrible. 

B.218:  Oh, how awful. 

A.219:  But, um, my, ((it was)) really just my grand father I guess and this one
elderly cousin of mine that went into nursing homes. 

B.220:  Yeah. 

A.221: But it's just a scary thought.  Every time, I certainly don't want
to be like that some day.

B.222:  Yeah, scien-, medical science has prolonged life but they have-, they
haven't really prolonged the quality of,

A.223:  # Yes.  #

B.224:  # it.  #

A.225:  (( )).

B.226:  That, that's, I think that's really the problem.  They can bring you ba-,
bring you, bring you out of death but they can't,
