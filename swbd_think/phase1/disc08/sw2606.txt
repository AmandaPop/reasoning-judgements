========================================================================

A.1:  All right, let's see, did I press one?

B.2:  Yes. 

A.3:  Did I? Okay, I didn't know whether you could hear because I, I have to take
the phone away from my ear to do it. 

B.4:  I guess that was one. 

A.5:  Did you hear it?

B.6:  I heard the beep. 

@A.7:  All right, we're on.  Uh, hey, Rick, who's your favorite team?

B.8:  Uh, I guess the Durham Bulls [laughter]. 

A.9:  Oh, okay.  And, uh, uh, [laughter]  we're not to have much mutual interest
there.  But, I'm curious, uh, uh, what class? Are they class A?

B.10:  Yeah.  They're, I think, a farm league of the Braves. 

A.11:  Oh, okay. 

B.12:  But, uh, they're, they're the closest by team,

A.13:  Yeah.  Do you go, 

B.14:  to Raleigh, North Carolina.  

A.15:  do you go see them very often?

B.16:  Yeah.  Actually, uh, we went a couple of times last year.  I haven't gone,
they started, I guess about a #week ago.#

A.17:  #Well, I  imagine# they're just starting. 

B.18:  Yeah. 

A.19:  Uh-huh.  Do you, you know, what's exciting about wa-, I never watched minor
league teams until I came to #Texas,#

B.20:   #Uh-huh.#  

A.21:   because  I was raised, one, near Boston, following the Red Sox, #and then,#

B.22:   #Uh-huh.#  

A.23:   I  went to graduate school in Pittsburgh, so I became a Pirate fan. 

B.24:   Okay. 

A.25:   And I was never in a minor league city until I came Dal-, we were a minor
league city when I came here in fifty-nine. 

B.26:   Uh-huh. 

A.27: And I immediately bought season tickets, uh, to the class triple A,
uh, uh, Dallas Rangers.

B.28:  Okay. 

A.29:  And then the class, uh, double A, Dallas Fort Worth Spurs.  We later, uh,

B.30:  Um.  

A.31:  they  went to the Texas league.  And, uh, I just really enjoy it.  I
guess I enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out, playing
here, and then seeing them a year or two,

B.32:  #Yeah.#  

A.33:  #later#  as, as stars in the majors. 

B.34:  Yeah. 

A.35:  Uh, and, I, I think that's probably the fun of watching minor league
baseball.  And the other thing is watching guys on the other end.  Uh, guys that
I had seen play for both the Red Sox and #Pittsburgh,#

B.36:  #Um.# 

A.37:  uh, they get to the other end of their career, and now they come up and talk
to you between innings of games [laughter]. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  I, I think that was exciting too.  Uh, have you seen any minor leaguers come
through, uh, any guys come through Raleigh, that are now in the big time?

B.40:  Uh, not, not yet, I mean I,

A.41:  Not yet.  Okay.  Well, of course you're, at the class A level, you're a few
years away from that [noise]  {on phone line}.

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  Uh, hang on a #second Rick,#

B.44:  #Okay.#  

A.45:  I  got to see who that is.  {Sounds like listener is put on hold.} You still there, Rick?

B.46:  Yes. 

A.47:  Yeah.  Uh, uh, do you follow any major league teams at all?

B.48:  Sure. 

A.49:  Which ones?

B.50:  Uh, I like the Phillies and the Dodgers. 

A.51:  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, how do you think they're going to do this year?

B.52:  Um.  Fair [laughter]. 

A.53:  #Fair, huh?#

B.54:  #I don't know, the Phillies# are so, uh, unpredictable. 

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  #But I,#

A.57:  #Yeah.#  

B.58:  think  the Dodgers will do well. 

A.59:  Well, I think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent
#market,#

B.60:  #Yeah.#  

A.61:  didn't  they?

B.62:  Yeah. 

A.63:  And, and the Dodgers, I guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was
letting, uh, Valenzuela go. 

B.64:  Yeah.  Anyway, he was getting old.  I think they got their mon-, their
money's worth out of him, though. 

A.65:  Yeah.  I think they probably did.  He prob-, I was reading the other day,
that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young. 

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  They say that if a guy's pitching, that, that his arm is
still developing until he's twenty-five, and if pitches a whole lot of
innings, before that, it may take its toll later in #life.#

B.68:  #Um.# 

A.69:  Course I've been watching #Nolan Ryan,#

B.70:  #Yeah.#  

A.71:  this  afternoon and, uh, [laughter]  it doesn't seem to bother him. 

B.72:  Um. 

A.73:  Uh, he, he has to be an outstanding physical specimen,

B.74:  #Yeah.  Well, have you heard,# 

A.75:  #to do what he's done.#  

B.76:  anything about Jim Palmer?

A.77:  Uh, well, Palmer tried a comeback, and, uh, got sore arm early.  And they,
uh, the Rangers are playing Baltimore, this game that I'm watching, and just the
last inning, they put the camera over on he and Brooks Robinson.  They are the
broadcast team for the,

B.78:  #Right.#  

A.79:  #Orioles.#  

B.80:  #Right.# 

A.81:  #And# ap-, apparently his, uh, his come back just didn't #make it
[laughter].#

B.82:  #Yeah.# 

A.83:  And that he got, he got hurt early in the, uh, in the, uh,
uh, in the spring training.  Uh, oh the, the Dodgers, the Dodgers have
got an interesting thing.  They've got this, uh, rookie pitcher,
what's it, Martinez his name?  That uh, that pitched a bunch of
innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year o-, year old.  And they
were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should
#be careful,#

B.84:  #Right.#  

A.85:  and not over work him this early.  Of course I was really, uh, uh,
a Dodger fan a couple of years ago when they won the Wor-, World
Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series.  #That
was, that was really a,#

B.86:  #The, the year they beat the A -s?#

A.87:  #Huh? Yeah, the,#

B.88:  #Yeah.  That was,# 

A.89:  #year they beat  the A -s.# 

B.90:  #really dramatic.  They were,#

A.91:  I was really, and boy, I can still remember that #Kirk Gibson,#

B.92:  #[Laughter].#  

A.93:  home #run.# 

B.94:  #They# were such under dogs. 

A.95:  Yeah.  They were, because everybody thought the A -s were the greatest
things -- 

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  -- in the world, and, uh, we've got, we're the only ones around
here that got cable, and that particular game was some reason or
another was on a #cable,#

B.98:  #Um.#  

A.99:  channel.   And, uh, my son's in high school, and all his friends were
#here.# 

B.100:  #Um.# 

A.101:  We're all sitting around, we must have had ten people in our living room
watching it.  Gos-, gosh, everybody just erupted when that #happened.#

B.102:  #Yeah.# 

A.103:  And, uh, that was, uh, uh, strictly an outstanding,

B.104:  #Yeah, it's,#

A.105:  #game.#  Uh, the uh, uh, the Dodgers, the Phillies, I'm not, uh, you know, the
National League, we have an American League team here, so I don't get that #much,#


B.106:  #Yeah.# 

A.107:  into  the National League stuff here.  I see them on the game of the
week, occasionally.  And I haven't seen the, the Phillies that much.  I know
that Mike Smith retiring a couple of years ago, left a big,

B.108:  #Yeah.#  

A.109:  #hole,#  offensively.  Who do the Phillies look to, to drive in a lot of
runs?

B.110:  I don't even know anymore.  I, I follow the Dodgers more than the #Phillies.# 

A.111:  #Yeah.# 

B.112:  But, uh, I, I grew up in Philadelphia,

A.113:  #Who do they,# 

B.114:  #I guess that's  why.# 

A.115:  Of course, you know, Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that, uh, uh,
they won,

B.116:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.117:  #the  World# Series, and Kirk Gibson.  Who, who are, are the Dodgers big R
B I #guys now?#

B.118:  #I think,# I don-, I don't know [laughter]. 

A.119:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.120:  #I thou-, I don't# know. 

A.121:  Yeah.  Well, I'm a, #I'm a#

B.122:  #Yeah.#

A.123:  Texas Ranger fan, and, you know, they are oh and four, but I think
they're going to be one and four at the end of today.  They're sitting
here with two out in the ninth, with a, uh, #fifteen to three lead.#

B.124:  #Yeah.  I think that's pre-,# #pretty,  good guess [laughter].#

A.125:  #That lead is# fairly comfortable.  Yeah.  And it was why, and
Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today.  And he gave up
three runs in first inning.  And I said, Oh, my God,

B.126:  #Huh-uh.#  

A.127:  #here  we# go again.  You know, you know, with two outs, walk, walk, home
run, bang, we're down three to nothing.  But they got four in their half of the
first and then Nolan,

B.128:  #Huh.#  

A.129:  #was#  invincible.  He went out after the seventh and had, he had only give
up those, uh, that one hit in the first inning and another hit.  So he went out
after the #seventh,#

B.130:  #Huh.#  

A.131:  inning,  with a, uh, it, at the time he had a, uh, I think, uh, a nine to
three, ten  to three #lead.# 

B.132:  #Wow.# 

A.133:  And, uh, uh, he had only given up two hits and, uh, two walks and nine,

B.134:  Huh.  

A.135:  strike  outs.  So he's, he's back in the groove.  And a, a guy his age,
this, this afternoon here, it's about seventy-,

B.136:   #Uh-huh.#  

A.137:  #nine#  degrees, a little bit humid, clear blue sky and the sunshine.  And
the Rangers don't play many afternoon games,

B.138:   Right.  

A.139:  because of the heat we have here, in the summer.  But, uh,
they try to play Sunday afternoons in April, May, and in September.
And, uh, uh, with the bright sky like this, where you've

B.140:   #Right.#  

A.141:   #got#  a real bright day, when he's out there throwing ninety-four,
ninety-five miles an hour,

B.142:   #Huh#.  

A.143:   #he's  almost# invincible.  And, uh, that's just a, exciting, uh, is really
exciting sitting,

B.144:  Um.  

A.145:  here  watching him on T V, this afternoon.  #And,#

B.146:  #How oft-,# how often do you go out to the baseball park?

A.147:  Uh, well, it, different times, different years, be-, because, {pause} [T V] 
{ballgame can be heard in background} because my, uh, uh, my #job,#

B.148:   #Um. # 

A.149:   takes  me out of the country a lot, and it always seems,

B.150:   Yeah.  

A.151:   to  be during the summer.  Uh, last year, we got to go out maybe about a
dozen times, which is #the most,#

B.152:   #Yeah.#  

A.153:   we've  ever gone out.  And we had about, uh, the Rangers won, uh,
eighty-three games last year, which was just four,

B.154:   #Um.#  

A.155:   #more#  than they lost.  But we had an exciting time.  And that at one time
in about the June, July and August period, we went to,

B.156:   #Wow!# 

A.157:   #about eight# straight wins.  And we happen to go out there #on win night
[laughter].# 

B.158:  #[Laughter].# 

A.159:  And, uh, uh, they, and they got #hot then.# 

B.160:   #Um.#  

A.161:   And  I'm not sure.  They put the prices up a dollar a ticket #this year# --

B.162:  #Um.# 

A.163:  -- We may have to go less.  But, what we like to do, the, uh, the stands
have got three tiers to,

B.164:   #Right.#  

A.165:   #them.#   And we like to be in the third tier behind home plate #about the
second row.# 

B.166:  #Um.# 

A.167:  And, uh, the, the park holds about forty thousand people.  And, uh, I never
go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand.  There's just
too big crowds.  I, I pick the games where they don't,

B.168:   Yeah.  

A.169:   expect  to have a high attendance.  And, uh, what, what about your, #your
ball park in, in Raleigh,#

B.170:   #It's, uh, it's actually,# 

A.171:   #uh, the minor league  ball park?#

B.172:  #in Durham.  They're, they're# thinking about moving it to Raleigh. 

A.173:  In Durham. 

B.174:  But it's, it holds,

A.175:   #Yeah.#  

B.176:   #maybe,#  four thousand. 

A.177:  #Oh, four thousand.# 

B.178:  #And it's like# three dollars to get in, so, 

A.179:  Oh, that is great.  When I got, here  in the class triple A #Rangers,#

B.180:   #Yeah.#  

A.181:  we used to pay two, and if you bought a season ticket, it
was only one #dollar a game.#

B.182:  #Yeah.# 

A.183:  And, uh, uh, that is fine.  And not only that but you #probably,#

B.184:   #Oh, yeah.#  #We're in the, #

A.185:   #get some pretty# good #seats  too.# 

B.186:  #Pretty much# wherever you want to sit. 

A.187:  Yeah, yeah.  What do they, do they have times of the year where they have
promotions and you get gigantic crowds, like maybe,

B.188:   #Yeah, they,# 

A.189:   #four thousand?# #Where they actually sell the place out?#

B.190:  #they give out stuff, and it's,# have you ever seen the movie,
BULL DURHAM?

A.191:  #Yes!#

B.192:  #I mean it's just like that, exactly.#  Well, a little more #modern day,#

A.193:   #Yeah.#  

B.194:   but not much. 

A.195:  Oh, yeah. 

B.196:  Yeah. 

A.197:  Yeah, I love that movie.  I absolutely love that.  And I
guess the players, uh, you know, the class A salaries are, are really,
uh, #not,#

B.198:   #Yeah.#

A.199:   anything  a guy can live on too much.  So  I guess they've got to go out and find rooming houses and,

B.200:   #Yes.#  

A.201:   #things#  like the guy in BULL DURHAM did. 

B.202:  #Yeah.# 

A.203:  #With fairly,#

B.204:   #Yeah.#  

A.205:   #economical#  accommodations.  Yeah, and, uh, uh, the other thing is that, that's really hard, but of
course, you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major
league team.  And the problem we always had in triple A is, you want to see the
guys,

B.206:   #Yeah.#  

A.207:   #go#  good, but then when they go good, you know you're,

B.208:   #Yeah.#  

A.209:   #going  to,#

B.210:   #Yeah.#  

A.211:   #lose  them.#  You know, during the season.  And I guess, at,  at your level, #uh,#

B.212:   #Yeah.#  

A.213:   you  lose them to the next level.  If, if they decide to recall the, the parent team, the Braves decide to
call, to recall a guy from triple A, then a double A guy goes up to replace him,
and a #single A,#

B.214:   #Yeah.#  

A.215:   guy  goes up to replace him.  And, and, and you've immediately, uh, now you got, you, you go out to the
#ball park,#

B.216:   #Yeah.#  

A.217:   and  your favorite player is not there anymore, and  you say, you've got, you've got to #learn,# 

B.218:  #Yeah.# 

A.219:  his replacement, but, do you get any local, uh, do they #broadcast games,#

B.220:   #No.#  

A.221:   locally  or televise them locally?

B.222:   There's, actually, #there may be an A M station that does it, I'm not,#

A.223:   #No, so you've, you've got to, uh.#  Huh? 

B.224:  There may be an A M station that does it, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. 

A.225:  Yeah, okay.  #So, so you, you've pretty much got to go to the ball park.# 

B.226:  #Yeah.  But it's,#

A.227:  #Uh, uh, to figure out but,#

B.228:  #I mean, you could, the game could be# at seven thirty, at seven fifteen and
you could say, Hey, let's go to the game [laughter].  And you'll get a seat. 

A.229:  Yeah, but, yeah, yeah.  Uh, uh, there's probably, that's pretty neat because
I don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have #big traffic jams going one way or
the other.# 

B.230:  #No, I mean, it's, it's, actually there's an interstate# ...
