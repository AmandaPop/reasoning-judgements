============================================================================

@B.1:  Do you want to start? G-,

A.2:  Yeah, I'm trying to think what I've seen lately.  I me-, we-, well we just
finished watching, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, you know
[laughter].

B.3:  Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES, did you [static]  see the movie?

A.4:  Yeah, we, we've seen that, yeah. 

B.5:  Did you like it?

A.6:  Yeah, it was great, have you seen it?

B.7:  I thought it was very well done. 

A.8:  Yeah, I, um,

B.9:  How about GHOST?

A.10:  We, we saw, an, we liked it but, you know, I didn't think it was as good as
all the, uh, hype was about it. 

B.11:  Right, I feel the same way about that too.  It was okay. 

A.12:  Yeah, I don-, I, I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, uh, best
picture. 

B.13:  No, no.  And, uh, wh-, let's see, uh, the most recent ones that I've seen
are those two, GHOST and, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, but I rent, uh, uh, videos,
do you?

A.14:  Yeah, yeah, and so we just,

B.15:  You, you watch many?

A.16:  Uh, it depends, um, you know, it depends on wh-,

B.17:  Do you like the classics like, uh, GONE WITH THE WIND and, uh, you know the
older movies. 

A.18:  I'd like to see those, I keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three
movies that I, I keep telling myself that I should see one of these, you know,
some day that I haven't seen, you know, that, that are classics, you know. 
Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE,

B.19:  # Yeah, that was good.  #

A.20:  # and never seen, I've # never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE
WIND. 

B.21:  I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, in, you know a
long time ago,

A.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.23:  # and, # uh, like the MALTESE FALCON and all those, uh, uh,

A.24:  Oh, I, I def-, we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on, on T V a couple of
years ago,

B.25:  # Yeah, that was good, yeah.  #

A.26:  # and I've, I've alwa-, I've # been wanting to see all of it but we just,
you know, we walk into the video store and we're like well why don't we go see
this now [laughter],  so. 

B.27:  Yeah, yeah, it's true. 

A.28:  But, um, I think-, one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, uh, MISERY. 

B.29:  Oh, I didn't see that one. 

A.30:  That was good, um,

B.31:  # Really.  #

A.32:  # oh, # it was great. 

B.33:  [Laughter]. 

A.34:  And it, you think, you know, for a Stephen, you know, it because it was by
Stephen King it would be really gory but there's only one, well there's a
couple scenes, at, at the end there's, there is, you know some blood and
everything and there's one really bad scene where it's, I mean, there's not
blood but it's pretty graphic [laughter].

B.35:  Yeah. 

A.36:  But it's, um, it's a really good movie, um. 

B.37:  Really, is that the one where, uh, the guy gets captured by that women?

A.38:  # Yeah, yeah, #

B.39:  # Okay, yeah.  #

A.40:  he's a writer and, um, she's his biggest fan and she's also [laughter], 

B.41:  # Yeah, right.  #

A.42:  # a little, # a little on the nutso side. 

B.43:  Uh-huh.  Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS?

A.44:  No, we haven't, um,

B.45:  I saw that one, that one wasn't that great either. 

A.46:  Oh, it wasn't?

B.47:  Well I didn't think so, no. 

A.48:  Oka-, I, I got, I heard like mixed reviews, um, of that, we s-,

B.49:  How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?

A.50:  That's, that's on our list of things to see [laughter]. 

B.51:  I know, I, I wanted to see, I, I was curious if you had seen it and that,
uh,

A.52:  N-, our big thing is, um, you know, mo-, movie prices up here I think it's
like six bucks now in the theaters,

B.53:  # Yeah.  #

A.54:  # (( ))# you know.  So it's like, you know, a lot of things we try to catch
like at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just
wait until it comes out on tape.

B.55:  That's us too, yeah, yeah true.  I know, it's too bad that they've gotten
so expensive.

A.56:  Ye-, well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really
enjoyed was, uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. 

B.57:  Oh, really. 

A.58:  Yeah, have you seen that?

B.59:  No. 

A.60:  Oh, it was great [laughter]. 

B.61:  Really. 

A.62:  Yeah it was,

B.63:  I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad-,

A.64:  No, no, it's, um, it's an odd film and it's really interesting that, I like
the director a lot, um, a guy named Tim Burton. 

B.65:  Uh-huh. 

A.66:  Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE?

B.67:  Uh, part of it, I,

A.68:  # Oh, ok-, #

B.69:  # I never # really watched the whole thing. 

A.70:  Oh, se-, yeah, well if you, if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. 

B.71:  Oh, really. 

A.72:  Yeah, it's, um, Burton's kind of, uh, e-, he's, a very odd, odd man but
he's, I think he's very interesting and, uh, I liked those two movies of his a
lot.

B.73:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.74:  # He # did BATMAN also, which, you know [breathing]  [laughter]. 

B.75:  Yeah, that was pretty good, though, really. 

A.76:  It was good, but I mean, he was, um,

B.77:  When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, you
know. 

A.78:  Yeah. 

B.79:  You see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour and it really,
there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars,

A.80:  # Oh, yeah, oh.  #

B.81:  # and all the # different stuff like that, you know. 

A.82:  Yeah. 

B.83:  Whose your favorite actress or actor?

A.84:  Um, don't really know, I like Costner a lot but, uh,

B.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.86:  # I'm # a big, I'm a big baseball fan so, you know, after BULL DURHAM and
FIELD OF DREAMS, you know,

B.87:  Yeah. 

A.88:  #Um, although, you know,#

B.89:  #That was good,# I saw that movie too.  That was very good. 

A.90:  Which one?

B.91:  FIELD OF DREAMS. 

A.92:  Yeah, FIELD OF DREAMS was good, um, and, I, I think, I liked the other
movies he's done.  NO WAY OUT was really good and,

B.93:  # Oh, yeah, yeah.  #

A.94:  # did you ever # see SILVERADO?

B.95:  SILVERADO, uh, who, who was that with?

A.96:  Um, let's see.  Danny Glover, Scott Glen, Kevin Kline, um, Brian
((Dennehy)), Jeff Goldblum's in.  Uh, John ((Kreas)) is in it if you don't
blink.

B.97:  That, the nam-, the, the title sounds familiar, I'm trying to thi-,

A.98:  It was, it was a big western, I mean, I think Roseanne ((Arquett)) was in
it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.  Uh, it was, and I think
it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours, and, and it was one of
those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.

B.99:  # Oh, really.  #

A.100:  # Um, but # it was, it was really good [laughter].  Um,

B.101:  I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although
I wo-, I would remember, I think in, with him in it. 

A.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.103:  # How # about REVENGE, did you see that with him?

A.104:  No, I didn't, is that any good? 

B.105:  With, uh, Anthony Quinn.  I thought it was, I like everything he's done so
far. 

A.106:  Oh, okay. 

B.107:  You know, it's, uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie but it
was okay. 

A.108:  Yeah, we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to
somebody.  You know the, the people who run the video store was recommending it
to somebody else. 

B.109:  Yeah it was, it was not a bad movie. 

A.110:  Huh, well, I'll have to catch it one of these days.  You sa-, you, you said
you seen NO WAY OUT?

B.111:  Yeah, that was excellent. 

A.112:  Yeah, that was very good.  Um, he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too. 

B.113:  Now that's another one I wanted to see.  Tha-, in fact, that was advertised
not too long ago. 

A.114:  Yeah, it was on, um,

B.115:  # Cable? #

A.116:  # no, # it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend. 

B.117:  Okay, I know I saw, # yeah, something about it.#

A.118:  # Uh, or two weeks # ago.  Yeah, I, um, I wish, I, I mean I'd seen it when,
when, you know, it was originally in the theaters and, um, I saw it, you know,
I saw part of it again.

B.119:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.120:  # I # mean I like, you know, I like Costner, I like Sean Connery, and, uh,
there's this one, there's this one actor, it's really silly that I enjoy him a
lot but I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named
Charles Martin Smith. 

B.121:  I don't know him. 

A.122:  Um, you've probably seen him and just, an, you know, oh, that's who the guy
is. 

B.123:  [Laughter]. 

A.124:  Do you remember, did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI?

B.125:  No, I, I don't think so. 

A.126:  Oh.  Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN. 

B.127:  Yes. 

A.128:  Okay, in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, um, Jeff Bridges and Karen
Allen, or Nancy Allen. 

B.129:  Okay, okay. 

A.130:  You know, w-, short nerdy guy with glasses. 

B.131:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.132:  He's, he's just, I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every
movie he's in.  He was in the UNTOUCHABLES.  He was the accountant [laughter]. 

B.133:  Oh, oh I know who you mean. 

A.134:  # Yeah.  #

B.135:  # He # was in, uh, uh, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he?

A.136:  No, no, you're thinking of Rick Moranis.  He looks like Rick Moranis but
he's not [laughter]. 

B.137:  Oh, okay, [laughter]  se-, all right, yeah, that's the one I was thinking
of.  But I have, I've seen quite a few movies, I, I enjoy them.  I think that,
uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment. 

A.138:  Yeah. 

B.139:  An, uh, an escape type of thing. 

A.140:  Yeah. 

B.141:  How about some of the ads, do you go by the ads when you look at them, or
the reviews? Do they influence you a lot. 

A.142:  Uh, a little of, e-, e-, a review usually won't make me go see a movie I
hadn't already wanted to see. 

B.143:  Yeah.  Did you see GOODFELLAS?

A.144:  No, it's o-, uh, I want to see it. 

B.145:  That wa-, that was pretty good.  Um, and,

A.146:  Um, we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also but my, my girlfriend's seen
part one and part two although she saw them years ago,

B.147:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.148:  # but # I've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the
GODFATHER movies so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and
then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.

B.149:  I was just going to say, th-, you should see those, fi-, uh, first if you
can. 

A.150:  Yeah. 

B.151:  If y-, if you read the book it's, uh, even better.  The book was excellent.

A.152:  Oh, okay, I haven't,

B.153:  # Yeah.  #

A.154:  # never # read it. 

B.155:  and, uh, I was a little disappointed in the third on-, it's GODFATHER
THREE.  It was not bad but, I expected more, I think. 

A.156:  Uh-huh.  We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE
FRESHMAN, with, um, it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, um, uh, Marlon
Brando.  And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE
GODFATHER. 

B.157:  Oh, really. 

A.158:  Um, yeah, it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know THE GODFATHER's been
on our minds lately.  Um, but, uh,

B.159:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

A.160:  # there's # a bunch of scenes from, uh, uh, from THE GODFATHER that's used
because Matthew Broderick's going to film school.  And, uh, in his classes
they're using, there's a bun-, they're running a bunch of scenes from THE
GODFATHER and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know,
this Maf-, you know this, uh, organized crime head. 

B.161:  Uh-huh. 

A.162:  So, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie. 

B.163:  How about Tom Cruise, do you like his stuff?

A.164:  Uh. 

B.165:  COCKTAILS, or, uh,

A.166:  I liked RAINMAN, I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing
som-,

B.167:  Oh, yeah, that was good, I liked RAINMAN, too. 

A.168:  Yeah, well I'm, being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson
fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies. 

B.169:  Uh-huh. 

A.170:  Um, n-, Barry Levinson did, um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all
set in Baltimore. 

B.171:  Yeah, they sound familiar.  I probably saw parts of those.  You know, a lot
of times I'll wa-, I'll start watching a movie and I'm tired and it,

A.172:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.173:  # next # thing you know, it's, it's especially if there's commercial in it
[laughter]. 

A.174:  # Ye-, we-, #

B.175:  # and then # the titles might sound familiar but I really don't know what
they're all about. 

A.176:  Ye-, of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.  I mean, they're,
they're all pretty good, but DINER is really worth seeing. 

B.177:  Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties. 

A.178:  Uh, late fifties, yeah. 

B.179:  Late fifties, yeah, I think I saw that one. 

A.180:  Okay and, uh,

B.181:  How about Meryl Streep,
