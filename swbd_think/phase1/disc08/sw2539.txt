A.1:  #Okay.# 

@B.2:  #Okay,# now when you baby-sit, what age group children do you sit with?

A.3:  Well, gosh all kinds, um, mostly between the ages of two and ten.

B.4:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.5:  Um, last, like a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the
entire summer and, I mean, they became like my children [laughter].

B.6:  I'd think so. 

A.7:  And, um, and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we
played on the playground a lot and then we would go to a movie on Thursdays
and, um, there was always an activity, you know, they had their favorite T V
shows and things like that that we watched and then we took naps and, um, I
don't know it, it just seems like there was always something to do.  Children
are so full of energy.

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  And, oh, they were, they just, the-, they just keep you going [laughter].

B.10:  Now was this a one parent or two parent family? 

A.11:  Uh, one parent. 

B.12:  One parent. 

A.13:  Yeah.  She's just, 

B.14:  How much time did she spend with them? 

A.15:  Not much at all [laughter].  I mean, I would get there at eight o'clock in
the morning, the children usually weren't awake by then.  And she would get
home at like five thirty in the afternoon.

B.16:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.17:  And they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed.

B.18:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.19:  Um, now at this particular time the children were two and six.  But then I
also, I've been baby-sitting this child, uh, for about eight years, he's nine
now and, um, you know, I've watched him grow up and he's like a little brother
to me.

B.20:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.21:  And it's changed over the, over the years, um, we get along a lot better
now that he's older.

B.22:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.23:  And, uh, we do different things now, we used to play ball a lot but now
it's, he likes to watch T V and he's into wrestling.  And, um, I kept him on
Friday night, we went sh-, we went to go see a movie and, um, things like that
but I feel like, I don't know, when I have children I want to be able to spend
a lot of time with them.

B.24:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] (( )) you say your, you go to school?

A.25:  Uh-huh, I go to L S U. 

B.26:  And what are you studying?

A.27:  Uh, communications.        

B.28:  Well, sounds like your [laughter] getting a lot of experience in
communicating with children [laughter].

A.29:  Oh, yeah, I mean, I love children. 

B.30:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.31:  Um, I don't know, seem, when I was growing up my Mom stayed at home with me
and my brother until we were in junior high.  And I don't, it would, I think
it was very beneficial to us.

B.32:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.33:  I mean, like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading
books and we went skating a lot and, you know, she was just always there for
us, but nowadays if there are two parents to a family, the mother works just
as hard as the father does, and the children either stay at home and get into
trouble or they're stuck in a day care.  And I just, I just don't want my
children to have to be raised like that.  All my friends, they, their parents
worked all the time, they got to stay at home by themselves and when I was
younger I thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things,

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  like I couldn't ride my bike across the street, but they could because
they're Mom would never know it.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  But now I realize that it was better because, um, they have got into a lot
of trouble,

B.38:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.39:  because of lack of supervision. 

B.40:  Well, that, that certainly can happen now if you, you say you're in
communications,

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  uh, what base of communications would you be most interested in getting
in to?

A.43:  Well, I'm majoring in, uh, public relations.

B.44:  Public relations, so,

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  so, you would have a job with a company? 

A.47:  Yes, ma'am. 

B.48:  Rather than, uh, radio or television or newspapers or,

A.49:  #Right.#  

B.50:  #what have you.# 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Yeah, and, uh, then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and
with, or stay with the children?

A.53:  Well, I would like to, uh, stay at home with my children for at least the
first five years.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  But what, what I plan to do in the future is, um, go ahead and get my upper
education as far as my masters,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  and work on my doctorate and teach, um, college,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  and in that case then I'll be, I'll be at home when my children are at
home, but I'd like to stay at home with them until they get in, at least into
kindergarten,

B.60:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.61:  where they're at school from what, eight to three or something and then I
would be at my school,

B.62:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.63:  teaching. 

B.64:  {Very faint} Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.65:  And, um,

B.66:  Well, that, that's, uh, is an advantage of being in the education field.  I
spent thirty-four years in education.

A.67:  Oh, really? 

B.68:  Yes, and,

A.69:  What grade?  

B.70:  so, oh, I started out with college and then went to high school and then
I preferred the high school age level much better than I did the college,

A.71:  #Oh, did you?#

B.72:  #because you have# a closer relationship with the, uh, students,

A.73:  What did you teach?

B.74:  that, I taught physical education. 

A.75:  Oh, oh, I started out as a P E major,

B.76:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

A.77:  in education.  I wanted to be a P E teacher.

B.78:  #Well,# 

A.79:  #I sure# did.

B.80:  I, uh, I found that, uh, it was a perfect combination from the standpoint
of having vacations off at the same time.

A.81:  Oh, yeah.

B.82:  And, uh, and it worked out fine from that standpoint, uh, plus the fact
that, uh, when I left, uh, usually, uh, my husband was seldom home for maybe
forty-five minutes or so and then our son, he had to get on the bus,

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  and he did get on the bus, it was his responsibility and he never ever
thought of, uh, not going to school he said, in view of the fact that he was
certain I had a hot line to his school.

A.85:  [Laughter].

B.86:  #Because, uh, I, uh,# 

A.87:  #Absolutely.# 

B.88:  well, I, I was in physical education then and I just kept getting pushed
into administration, wound up in administration, #and so,#

A.89:  #Oh.#

B.90:  he thought surely that I, or I would have bought a hot line,

A.91:  [Laughter].

B.92:  to know if he ever skipped school, which, of course, was not the case and
I wouldn't have checked on him.  However, uh, there are, there are, points
both directions in that, uh, from the standpoint of parents working and not
working.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  Uh, I listened to more than one parent say I don't know what this child
wants.  I'm working two jobs, they each have their own television, they each
have their own telephone, they each have their own rooms, they each have this,
they each have that.  ((I'd say)), but what they don't have is you.

A.95:  That's right.  They need some attention. 

B.96:  Absolutely.  And, uh, I ((think out)) because that is the way of getting
attention.

A.97:  Well, see whenever my Mom stayed home with us, we did without a lot, I
mean, we were, it's hard to make it on one #income,#

B.98:  #That's right.#  

A.99:  but we did and, and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years.

B.100:  Huh.

A.101:  And, um, you know, we, we only had one car, we only had one telephone, you
know,

B.102:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

A.103:  we didn't get to eat out all the time but I, I feel like that it helped
me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar,

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  and, um, I also had the supervision that I needed while I was growing up,
and I hope that I can provide that for my child too.

B.106:  And we certainly, uh, we need more of that, we need more parents willing to
supervise, though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure,

A.107:  #Oh, we have.#

B.108:  #from the standpoint of,# of, uh, church and school and everything along
the way.  And that I think has contributed much to, uh, the delinquency that
((works grant)) and the poor school results that we're having.  Uh, that the
students, uh, parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from
the very very beginning and I think my feeling was that the very best teachers
should be in grades one, two, and three.  To get the students off to a good
start let them have positive, um, uh, experiences,

A.109:  #Uh-huh.#

B.110:  #from# the lower levels so they want to continue learning and, uh, keep
going and not wait until they're, they're in the ninth and tenth grades, it's
too late then, you cannot,

A.111:  It is.

B.112:  reverse that trend at that point. 

A.113:  It's way too late,

B.114:  #Right.#  

A.115:  #I agree.# 

B.116:  And, uh, while parents very often will be involved with the school
activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the
high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point.  And, that is just
as valuable,

A.117:  It is.  

B.118:  at that time, as to #the ((rush in the elementary)).#

A.119:  #Because all the peer pressure,#

B.120:  Yes, right.  

A.121:  it starts in high school and the parent really needs to be there for the
child.

B.122:  Right.  And, uh, the child needs to take pride in the fact that their
parent is doing something.  Uh, we were fortunate in view of the fact that my
son did play football and I did keep statistics for his team, and,

A.123:  #Oh, great.#  

B.124: #his Dad# did take movies of the football team and movies of the
basketball team, and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing
him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time.

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  So, wh-, I feel that I learned a great deal from my students, uh, with
regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents.  And a thing such
as, uh, one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of
time with seniors,

A.127:  [Laughter].  

B.128:  uh, was, um, carrying their (( )) when I was your age I didn't have this
or that,

A.129:  Uh-huh.

B.130:  and I know I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing
that was really irritating to young people.

A.131:  Well, I guess that was good that you were, you were hearing it from other
students.

B.132:  Yes, and I had to deal with their problems and I could talk about the kinds
of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and
our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself
along those same types of, of, uh, lines.  So that,

A.133:  Well, um,

B.134:  I think he benefited from my experiences.

A.135:  Does your son work for T I? 

B.136:  No. 

A.137:  Oh.

B.138:  No, he, uh, works, uh, for a different company.  Yeah, in the Dallas area
but when he went away to coll-, and he was ((on the lawns)) from the time he
was in the seventh grade and, uh, a small (( )) and all the way through
college and he held three jobs.  ((Wally)) was in college and we didn't even
know it.

A.139:  Oh, goodness. 

B.140:  He didn't even tell us. 

A.141:  [Laughter].  

B.142:  Uh, that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand
dollar bank account and, uh, we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to
college he could go, if he got married he was on his own, if he flunked out he
was on his own ...
