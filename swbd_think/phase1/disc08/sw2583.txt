============================================================================

A.1:  The, uh, public school sys-, system seems to be getting a lot of, uh,
criticism lately.  I guess over the years, it's always seemed worse, uh, to
the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there.  So, uh,
I don't know how much of it is, well a lot of it is deserved, but then, a lot
of it's not.  I mean th-, the kids are coming out learning, uh, things a lot
faster, uh,

B.2:  Um-hum.

A.3:  whether or not they actually have it learned, th-, that, that yet, uh,
remains to be seen.  At least in our kids case, it's, they're still in it.
But, uh, I know they're learning things that, uh, we never learned.  Plus they
have the burden of, uh, well this, is the burden they have the task of
learning computers, uh, even in, uh, kindergarten, they had, uh, a
requirements that they had to meet for learning the, uh, terms like keyboard
and monitor and,

B.4:  Oh, really?

A.5:  and know what a computer was and what a disk was and,

B.6:  That's great.

A.7:  you know, all the, uh, yeah it is, but it's interesting that there's that
much more knowledge to be learned,

B.8:  So much more complex.

A.9:  at this, at this, uh, age, you know.  Not just the colors and begin on
the alphabet --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- It's learn your colors, learn your alphabet, learn all your, your little
terms here and, and learn how to, uh, begin learning some of the reading.
[sigh] And by the second or third grade, uh, the little school system that
we're in, they have, uh, really, a lot of computers.  Uh, it's a very wealthy
district as, as all that,

B.12:  Great.

A.13:  fighting's going on over who gets the money and the like.  But, they
have,

B.14:  Yeah, I've been hearing about that.

A.15:  they have, uh, twenty-seven computers for each of the little labs, and
each lab serves, uh, two grades.  So the first and second graders have their
own batch of computers that they've cycled the kids through and,

B.16:  Goodness.  

A.17:  and so there's, uh, well I guess three or four different labs, and
they're all very nice.  Uh, computers all tied together on the LAN, and one
server that handles all the software so that the teachers don't have to go
around to each machine and do their work.  They can control it from the ma-,
the server.  It's, it's a beautiful system, but, uh, the only bad thing it
seems to do is, uh, not the computer necessarily, but the co-, the school
system seems to put a little bit more pressure on the kids than, uh, than we
had, of course.  Of course, I guess with that learning comes that pressure.

B.18:  Um-hum.

A.19:  We also managed to land in a school that, uh, they decided to build one big
rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classrooms.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  And so it gets a little noisy, it's a little hard to keep the kids that
quiet from one class to the next, and they can't really be rowdy at any one
given time.  So they, they put them outside a lot.  They try, you know, to get
a lot of good breaks here and there, and, but, uh, they just took bookcases
and things to move around and sort of what, you know, sort of build a, an idea
of a wall.  And the kids seem to handle it okay, but it's, it's got some
drawbacks to it.  And, uh, as if that wasn't bad enough, they, they also
experimented with a particular size school.  Most of the elementary schools
were, uh, seven hundred, uh, kids in, in, It only goes from kindergarten up to
fifth grade for our elementaries.  And our particular schools run, uh, a
thousand fifty right now.

B.22:  Oh, goodness.

A.23:  So, they, they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really
needed to have.  They still have a twenty-three to twenty-five or so to one
teacher ratio, but it's still,

B.24:  That can be a disadvantage to the kids.      

A.25:  Yeah, still a lot of people, and you just can't get them in and out of
the school in a reasonable length of time.  You know, traffic is a bit of a
problem.  [laughter] I mean, of all the decisions they could have made on this
particular school, they, uh, they located it in a, up against a creek.  And
there's no street access to it except for one turn around driveway,

B.26:  Oh, no.

A.27:  and that feeds onto a street that is right across the street from another
school.  [laughter] And they all get out at the same time.  And it's just, uh,
so we, we spend a little time getting, I get, [whistling] go,

B.28:  Get it.

A.29:  over there to pick up, uh, my son about two-thirty.  And he gets out at
two-forty-five, and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked, and then
I wait for, be-, between kids.  Rather than drive all the way home, I wait a
little while, and, and at two-thirty, I mean at three-thirty, my daughter gets
out.  And we usually let them play if the weather's nice.  Play outside until
the traffic dies down, and then we go home.  So I'm

B.30:  That's a good idea.

A.31:  there from two-thirty until four o'clock.  I'm just waiting for, to pick
up the kids.  That's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day.  But,
uh, it is better just to let them, you know, play outside than it is to fight
the traffic.  So, and there's, it's real nice park lands on both sides of the
school.  They have, you know, climbers and stuff like that, but --

B.32:  Well, great.

A.33:  -- the, the school system in and of itself as far as what they're teaching,
um, they cannot keep up with the private as far as, because of the ratio.
There's just no way.

B.34:  Um-hum.

A.35:  Plus the private tends to have the more disciplined kids, you know.
They're not dealing with the whole gammit of personalities here.  They're,
they're, private schools do not put up with a child that is, uh, that much of
a problem like most schools,

B.36:  That's right.

A.37:  have to.  So you have that kind of a situation, but, uh, by the same
token, you have kids coming out of private schools that they've spent very
much time with them.  Not able to s-, cope socially with the other types of
people in the world [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah, um, I remember, I mean, during my, I went to a private school during
the ju-, junior high years which was, uh, you know, really during the de-,
development time of my life.  And it was a small school, we had like maybe
twenty people in Junior High.  I mean in my class, like in seventh grade, we
had twenty in them and whenever we moved up to the ei-, eighth grade we had
like twenty or twenty-five in the whole eighth grade.  And we had two
different classes so the ratio was real good.  Um, as far as the, we had real
good teachers, and I learned a lot.  I feel like that if I had of gone to a
private school during Junior High, I probably wouldn't have developed such
good study skills.  Because, um, I thought the private school was difficult.
I mean, it gave a lot of homework and everything and it really helped me
develop my skills, my uh, my memorization.  I can memorize things real well
now and things like that.  But, and then whenever I got to High School, it was
kind of a disadvantage to me ta-, to the fact that I was going from a class of
twenty to a class of five hundred.  And, uh, and I do feel like that I was
socially withdrawn to a certain extent because I didn't know anyone.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And I was a freshman in High School, you know, and I was the peon.  But,
uh, it probably took, I don't know, maybe the first semester to get, to get to
where I was really comfortable with school.  Because, um, I hadn't been in the
public school system for so long, and it is just, it's really different.  It,
uh, the children there are a lot, a lot wilder than what I was used to.  I was
gr-, I grew up in a very protective home, and then whenever I got to High
School, things were just so much different, especially nowadays.  I mean, even
the High School that I went to just recently, they put up these little metal
detectors at each door when you walk in to make sure you don't have a gun,

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  and things like that.  And,

A.43:  [Cough].

B.44:  I mean, it's, it's gotten worse.  I graduated about two years ago, and
even in the past two years it's gotten, I mean, it's just increased the, the
crime and the, the drugs and the violence and everything have just cr-,
increased enormously.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  So, um,

A.47:  Well, another thing that we've noticed that's, uh, changed over the years,
and, uh, we're not really sure exactly what we're going, what we want to do
with it publicly.  But, uh, the teachings, uh, the ideas that are taught, uh,
don't always agree with what we would teach them either from a standpoint of
morals or from a standpoint of how to handle a given situation.

B.48:  Um-hum.

A.49:  And there seems to be a, a large degree of violence, not necessarily
taught, but, but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from T V or from,
uh.  Quite a few kids, like in the second to third grade, take, uh, karate
lessons and take various, uh, self-defense things.

B.50:  Golly.

A.51:  It's, it's given to them or it's proposed.  It seems to be socially
acceptable as a self-esteem, you know, building, building the person's
confidence up.

B.52:  Um-hum.

A.53:  And you have, uh, third and fourth graders that are, uh, you know, when
they get into a fight, they, they tend to use some of the, the maneuvers that
they have, and they feel a little more confident about their fighting ability.
They tend to get into a few more fights, and several of them have ended with,
uh, police calls and,

B.54:  Oh, goodness.

A.55:  and having, uh, broken bones down at that level of, of kids.  I know more
than one kid that has, has got a, uh, record already just because of fighting
of that, that nature.

B.56:  Oh, no!

A.57:  And [sigh] it's, it's not something that necessarily happens at school, but
just in their, their, uh, relationships as they, after school times,

B.58:  Um-hum.

A.59:  and the like, And then you get into the whole area of, of, uh, well what,
what I would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra
classes, but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in
the mornings.  And all the kids will sit around in a little circle, and
they're, they're asked to empty their minds and to, to think about, uh, they
have a name of a particular dinosaur that they, they're to, uh, think about
that dinosaur and they're encouraged {Recording ended with no further
conversation} ...
