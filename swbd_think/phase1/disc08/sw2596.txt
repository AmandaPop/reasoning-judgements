=============================================================================

A.1:  Do you have a favorite television program?

B.2:  Um, [breathing]  probably, um, on Friday nights, FULL HOUSE. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  It's a family comedy. 

A.5:  Okay. 

B.6:  How about you?

A.7:  I'm not real familiar with that show [laughter]. 

B.8:  Really [breathing]? 

A.9:  Do you watch that movie for your kids, or, uh,

B.10:  Uh, actually I don't have any kids [laughter]. 

A.11:  Oh, no kids. 

B.12:  No. 

A.13:  It's a surprise that you, uh, the, uh, prime time, uh, family show like
that. 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  Uh, how about you, do you have a favorite one?

A.15:  I, uh, I really watch CHEERS.  I watch that one on a regular basis. 

B.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  See, I really don't watch that.  I, I liked it originally
when it first came on. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  But, I guess when, uh, Diane left the show,

A.19:  # Okay.  #

B.20:  # I, # I, I, I left it, too [laughter]. 

A.21:  [Breathing]  Yeah, it, it, it took me a while to get used to, uh, Rebecca,
but I actually,

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # like # the newer shows better than the old ones now. 

B.24:  Uh-huh.  So do you like comedies mostly or,

A.25:  [Breathing] Yeah.  I like, uh, comedies, a lot, uh, movies, and, uh, sports
programs in particular.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  What kind of sports?

A.27:  Well, right now basketball and, uh, baseball's in season so [laughter], 

B.28:  Uh-huh, just whatever's in season at the time. 

A.29:  Right.  In Fall I watch a lot of football. 

B.30:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh [breathing].  Um.  Yeah, it's mostly like, you know,
comedies and movies, um, you know, movies on cable that aren't interrupted, I
guess, uh. 

A.31:  Yeah, I've got H B O right now. 

B.32:  Yeah.  I have CINEMAX and the MOVIE CHANNEL, I guess. 

A.33:  I like CINEMAX better.  They usually have more movies. 

B.34:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing], excuse me. 

A.35:  But, I'll take whatever they offer for a dollar for, for the next month. 

B.36:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.37:  And then cancel it after awhile. 

B.38:  Uh-huh, Uh-huh.  Um, yeah, I mean how much T V do you normally watch?

A.39:  Oh, couple hours a day, I guess. 

B.40:  Yeah, that, that's about what I do.  You know, like, around nine or so, in
the evening I go. 

A.41:  Yeah, a little bit more on weekends because of the sports programs. 

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.43:  Depends a lot on what's on cable for the movies. 

B.44:  Right, exactly. 

A.45:  I do get tired of, uh, watching, uh, movies on network T V with all the,
uh, commercial interruptions.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  But then the thing on cable is that, like, you'll s-, if you,
like, watch, you'll, you'll see that movies are repeated so often.

A.47:  Yeah, they sure are. 

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  I get tired of that, too, see the same ones over and over again. 

B.50:  Uh-huh.  {pause} Um.  So you're not familiar with FAM-, or with, uh, FULL
HOUSE, right?

A.51:  Uh, no, uh, what's that show about?

B.52:  Well, it's, it's about like a, a, a widowed father who has three girls and
he has two other guys that live with him and they're all raising, like, the
three daughters, and, it, it,

A.53:  Sounds complicated. 

B.54:  Yeah, but it's really interesting and it's really funny.  I, I enjoy it. 

A.55:  I'll have to tune in sometime. 

B.56:  Eight o'clock Friday nights [laughter]. 

A.57:  [Laughter]  Okay.  Make sure I catch that one of these, uh, weeks. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  Yeah, I'm just, I've got WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS on right now. 

B.60:  Uh-huh.  Well, and I have S-, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY on cable on. 

A.61:  Oh, I've seen that, that's a good movie. 

B.62:  Yeah.  It's a really good movie.  {pause} I guess the other thing I like
is, like, THE COSBY SHOW.  I like that on Thursday nights.

A.63:  Uh, I've never really watched that show. 

B.64:  Really?

A.65:  I'm not too taken up with BILL COSBY. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  I've been told, uh, uh, by other people that it's, it's, really, a, a, a
white folks show. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  Uh, upper middle class.  And, uh, I, I don't know.  I never really got
interested in it much. 

B.70:  Uh-huh.  Um.  Um.  Yeah, that's, that's really about it I guess, uh,

A.71:  I mean, Bill Cosby's okay, but, [laughter] I've got a couple of his record
albums from, uh, from way back when.

B.72:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.  Yeah, I can remember, what was that, I SPY, or whatever
that he was in?

A.73:  Oh, with Robert Culp? Uh-huh. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  Yeah, I used to watch that all the time. 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  That was --

B.78:  I liked that. 

A.79:  -- that was before he became famous [laughter]. 

B.80:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.81:  He did the FAT ALBERT, uh,  

B.82:  Right.  I know, I always liked #that cart-,#

A.83:   # uh, comedies.  #

B.84:  yeah, that cartoon.  I always liked that. 

A.85:  Those cartoons, right. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  You watch cartoons besides that?

B.88:  Uh, not really that much lately [laughter].  I used,

A.89:  I, I catch them on Saturday mornings every now and then,

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # watch # TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. 

B.92:  Oh, no, no, no, no, [laughter]. 

A.93:  [Laughter]. 

B.94:  You like that one, huh?

A.95:  Oh, it's interesting. 

B.96:  Uh-huh.  I never even saw the movie. 

A.97:  I,

B.98:  # Or the second one, I guess.  #

A.99:  # I haven't seen, uh, either one # of them yet.  Uh,

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  The second one is showing right now, I guess,

B.102:  # Yeah.  #

A.103:  # in # the theaters, and, uh, the first one's going to be on cable next
month, I believe. 

B.104:  Oh, really? I, I like more of the cartoons that were on when I was younger
like BUGS BUNNY, and, you know, PORKY,

A.105:  # How about JOHNNY QUEST? #

B.106:  # oh, I never really # liked him, no. 

A.107:  The ROAD RUNNER AND COYOTE. 

B.108:  ROAD RUNNER, yeah, ROAD RUNNER.  DAFFY DUCK, you know, all those kind of
guys.  I like those [laughter]. 

A.109:  Yeah.  Another show that I watch is the WONDER YEARS.  Do you ever see
that?

B.110:  Oh, I like that, uh-huh. 

A.111:  I can relate to Kevin because, uh, I was always twelve years old in
nineteen sixty-eight.

B.112:  Oh, really?

A.113:  But, I watch that show to see what I missed out on as a kid [laughter]. 

B.114:  Uh-huh. 

A.115:  He gets into a lot of stuff. 

B.116:  Yeah, yeah, and it's interesting from the perspective of his perspective, I
guess. 

A.117:  Right, well, it brings back a lot of memories, too, because of the music
that they play in the show. 

B.118:  Uh-huh.  I'm a little bit younger.  I was born quite, I was born in
sixty-three. 

A.119:  Uh-huh. 

B.120:  So I was, I'm, I little bit younger. 

A.121:  Okay.  Well, you're probably more interested in THE SIMPSONS, then. 

B.122:  No.  I don't really get into THE SIMPSONS, either [laughter]. 

A.123:  Don't care for that type of humor?

B.124:  No.  No, not really. 

A.125:  It's pretty bizarre. 

B.126:  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  Do you watch any, uh, news-type shows, like SIXTY MINUTES?

B.128:  Uh, on occasion.  I'm usually not home on, you know, Sunday evenings, but,
uh, on occasion I do.  And TWENTY TWENTY. 

A.129:  Yeah, yeah.  I watch those.  EXPOSE also is good. 

B.130:  Really? I've never seen that one. 

A.131:  How about, uh, talk shows?

B.132:  Uh, well, I'm not normally home during when talk shows are on. 

A.133:  Well, I catch SALLY JESSE RAPHAEL at, uh, at night. 

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  Nine o'clock on channel twenty-seven. 

B.136:  Oh, really?

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  Well, see, where I live, she's on during the day. 

A.139:  Oh, is that right?

B.140:  I live in Virginia. 

A.141:  Oh, I'm in Texas. 

B.142:  [Laughter]. 

A.143:  [Laughter]. 

B.144:  Yeah, a lot of people that I've talked to have been like that. 

A.145:  Right. 

B.146:  That, you know, that they can't realize that I, they're, they, you know,
thought that was a little strange that I was from Virginia. 

A.147:  Yeah. 

B.148:  But, so, all the talk shows here are on during the day. 

A.149:  Is that right? Okay. 

B.150:  So the only time I ever catch anything is if I come home a little bit home
early from work and see OPRAH. 

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  Because she's on at four. 

A.153:  Well, they have really bizarre topics on there. 

B.154:  Uh-huh. 

A.155:  Uh, just the other,

B.156:  But, you know, that's, they tend to arrange, though, the topics seem to go,
like, in a cycle.  And it seems like on everyone's show they have the same
topic like within a certain range of time.

A.157:  Uh-huh. 

B.158:  At least that I see, notice.  Not that I see them that often.  But, from
what I hear people telling me. 

A.159:  Well, they, they, have, uh, topics that I've not, never seen on any other
type talk shows. 

B.160:  Uh-huh. 

A.161:  The other night they had, uh, people who were victims of bad dates. 

B.162:  Uh-huh. 

A.163:  And, the, the women thought that they should be able to sue the guys for
being a lousy date. 

B.164:  Oh, gosh. 

A.165:  [Laughter]. 

B.166:  That's a little, yeah. 

A.167:  They had various reasons for it, but, uh, the topics, uh, it's, it's
entertaining for, uh, for the audience there. 

B.168:  Uh-huh. 

A.169:  And you get to see a lot of different, uh, perspectives on, uh, what
people,

B.170:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.171:  # what's # on their minds. 

B.172:  Uh-huh, um. 

A.173:  But they're always coming up with something strange.  And they claim it's
not sensationalism type, uh, type reporting, or journalism,

B.174:  # Uh-huh [breathing].  #

A.175:  # but I # think it is.  It's anything to get, uh, uh, the viewers
interested. 

B.176:  Exactly {pause}. Um. 

A.177:  I can't say it's not entertaining, though. 

B.178:  [Laughter]  Well, you know, I even like, uh, ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. 

A.179:  Uh-huh. 

B.180:  With, you know, I like that.  You, you lear-, learn a little bit about the
stars' lives, you know. 

A.181:  With, uh, Mary Hart and Leeza Gibbons. 

B.182:  Yeah.  Uh-huh. 

A.183:  I don't watch that much. 

B.184:  {Pause} Um, [lipsmack]  and I guess that's about it. 

A.185:  Okay.  Um,

B.186:  We seem to have gone over the whole realm of all the different kinds of T V
[breathing]. 

A.187:  [Laughter]  yeah, except for the church service shows on Sunday morning
[laughter]. 

B.188:  No, I definitely don't watch those [laughter]. 

A.189:  No, I'm not too interested in that myself. 

B.190:  [Laughter]. 

A.191:  I, I usually catch the, the afternoon sports shows. 

B.192:  Uh-huh. 

A.193:  So, the N B A basketball playoffs will be coming up real soon. 

B.194:  Uh-huh. 

A.195:  Within the next, uh, two weeks. 

B.196:  Uh-huh.  Well, that will give you [breathing]  a lot of entertainment. 

A.197:  And I just, just, got, uh, done with the N C double A tournament. 

B.198:  Uh-huh. 

A.199:  I was glued to the T V for two, two weeks. 

B.200:  [Laughter]. 

A.201:  But, uh, sports is always fun. 

B.202:  Oh, that, I don't, I don't really get into watching sports on T V.  I'd
rather be there in person, I guess. 

A.203:  Yeah well,

B.204:  But if you can't be there in person, I guess seeing it on T V -s the next
best thing. 

A.205:  Right, well, I like T V because of, uh, instant replay,

B.206:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.207:  # and # you, you really do get, uh, what I, I think you get a better
perspective because of, uh, the coverage, number of cameras that they have
setup at the events.

B.208:  Yeah, I guess, I guess you would, uh-huh. 

A.209:  And, there aren't the distractions that you find in the, with the crowds
actually being at a game. 

B.210:  [Noise]  Uh-huh. 

A.211:  And you can get up and get something to eat whenever you feel like, come
back to the T V,

B.212:  # [Laughter].  #

A.213:  # or, # uh, tape it and watch it later. 

B.214:  Uh-huh.  That's a benefit. 

A.215:  My V C R doesn't get an awful lot of use right now, but, uh, should be
taping more movies right now. 

B.216:  Uh-huh. 

A.217:  I think next month, uh, cable's going to have a couple more [breathing], 
uh, good movies on.  I think THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is on next month on H B
O. 

B.218:  Oh, really?

A.219:  I haven't seen that one yet, and that's supposed to be very good. 

B.220:  No I haven't either, I haven't either.  And I do want to see that. 

A.221:  Okay.  Well, I appreciate talking to you about T V shows,

B.222:  # Oh, sure.  It was nice talking to you.  #

A.223:  # It's been very entertaining.  I'll have to catch # FULL HOUSE one of
these times [laughter].

B.224:  [Laughter]  Okay. 

A.225:  [Laughter]  Okay. 

B.226:  Okay.  Bye-bye. 

A.227:  Sure.  Bye.
