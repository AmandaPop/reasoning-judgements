REMARKS:        At the very beginning the tape skipped a couple of times when
Speaker A started talking.  On Speaker A's section, the skips could not be 
heard.  The only hard problem with this tape was their frequent talkovers, 
which made it more difficult and slower to transcribe.

=============================================================================

A.1:  So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?

@B.2:  Well, I, the biggest, [noise] uh, way it's going right now, [/noise] uh,
lot, most of the grocery stores --

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  -- have got, uh, things set up s-, where you can bring in your, uh,
plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.  And then they've just got different
barrels [noise] setting out (( )), I shouldn't say barrels, like big ((John
Doors)) or,

A.5:  # Uh-huh. #

B.6:  # whatever # they're,

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  called.  Gondolas [breathing]. 

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  Um, they've got them set outside [lipsmack] and,

A.11:  # Is it,#

B.12:  # uh, #

A.13:  is it all voluntary?

B.14:  Yes.  It's all voluntary.  Now, they do have some places where you can take
things and get cash but,

A.15:  # Right.  #

B.16:  # I # think the lot of people don't really want the cash. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  You know, they just want to, uh, help recycle.  Which is,

A.19:  # Yeah.  #

B.20:  # what # we do.  You know,

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  we, [breathing]  probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the
cans in and we let the kids get the money for that. 

A.23:  Right.  Yeah. 

B.24:  But, uh,

A.25:  # There's, #

B.26:  # f-, #

A.27:  a lot of projects where the, the Boy Scouts and things, and that will,

B.28:  Right. 

A.29:  collect your cans and,

B.30:  Right. 

A.31:  it's a good fund raiser for the kids. 

B.32:  Yeah.  That's true, but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around
here is the grocery stores participating. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  You know but,

A.35:  I guess, I, you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  I know, I, we're in Maryland, but, my, I from Pennsylvania and my parents
how, are forced recycling,

B.38:  # Oh, #

A.39:  # uh, #

B.40:  really?

A.41:  Yeah.  All plastic, they ha-, all plastic has to go into a recycling bin,
all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled. 

B.42:  Oh, wow. 

A.43:  Because they're, um, [lipsmack] they're just running out of space and
landfills.  Uh, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the, uh, they're
using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  So, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them.  Now, up here in
Maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.
So, uh, so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles, and we save our
newspapers, and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.  And just
like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up and we
dump them off [noise] there.

B.46:  So, it's vol-,

A.47:  # Yeah.  It's still voluntary, #

B.48:  # you say it is # all voluntary.  Do they,

A.49:  though I think, I think we're supposed to have something impame-,
implemented by nineteen ninety-three, though --

B.50:  Will it be mandatory?

A.51:  -- where some aspects will be mandatory.  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Is it all, um, is there any place at all where you do get cash for this
stuff or is it all,

A.53:  Mostly just the cans. 

B.54:  Okay. 

A.55:  And I,

B.56:  # Yeah.  And that's, #

A.57:  # and most of # the time, like I said, that's, that's a sort of like fund
raiser things that,

B.58:  Right. 

A.59:  the schools do, or that the Boy Scouts do, or whatever. 

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  #Yeah.# 

B.62:  #Yeah.#  That's true.  That's,

A.63:  Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for. 

B.64:  Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your
newspapers,

A.65:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.66:  # and # stuff like that.  But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I
said, are more concerned,

A.67:  Right.  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth
[breathing]. 

A.69:  Yeah,

B.70:  # Um.  #

A.71:  # I # think that's mostly, well, you know, we, even before, as soon as the
community said, you know, We're going to put up bins for recycling, you know,
we automatically started,

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  doing it.  It was,

B.74:  Right. 

A.75:  it's one of those things, you know, and just going and taking the time to
go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should
be,

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  separated, you know.  That's,

B.78:  Well, I tell you, it's kind of funny now at, e-, even at T I, I don't, do
you work for T I?

A.79:  No.  Huh-uh. 

B.80:  Okay.  Um, at T I they're doing recycling.  I mean, for a long time they
didn't do this, but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper.  We have
separate bins --

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  -- uh, separate wastebaskets [noise]  in our offices --

A.83:  Uh-huh. 

B.84:  -- for paper. 

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  You know, and they, I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved
and even saving all these trees and, you know --

A.87:  Right. 

B.88:  -- it's really, [laughter]  I can't believe that --

A.89:  Yeah. 

B.90:  -- you know.  Because they've got it all posted all over the place how
much,

A.91:  # How much, how well they're doing.  #

B.92:  # they're saving and how w-, yeah.  #

A.93:  We do, I, um, [lipsmack]  I, I work in a, uh, speech interface lab,

B.94:  # Oh, okay.  #

A.95:  # at a, # at a, at a college.  And we do basically the same thing.  The
state of Maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some
of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their
office paper.

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  And,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # the # same thing, you know, every, almost every college in Maryland is
recycling office paper.  But, you know, in the giant bins around, and it's
surprising how much --

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  -- you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your
garbage,

B.102:  # Right.  #

A.103:  # can # every night. 

B.104:  Yep.  So,

A.105:  # You don't notice until, #

B.106:  # you don't think about # it. 

A.107:  you start leaving, you know, they don't pick up your recycling until
[noise]  it's full and,

B.108:  Right. 

A.109:  you just can't believe how much paper that you, uh,

B.110:  I know [breathing]. 

A.111:  Reams of paper come,

B.112:  # Yep [laughter].  #

A.113:  # out of # an office every day [laughter].  ((That)),

B.114:  Yeah.  Well, you think about,

A.115:  ((took us)) to recycle. 

B.116:  the waste, even. 

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  I mean, you know, cost wise and --

A.119:  Right. 

B.120:  -- and, you know, like you s-, saving trees and stuff like [noise] that.  I
mean, it's just amazing, [noise] you know,

A.121:  # Yeah.  So, I think, #

B.122:  # the difference.  #

A.123:  [Noise]  Hopefully, if, you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations,
[/noise]  probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they
are?

B.124:  N-,

A.125:  (( )).

B.126:  I haven't seen,

A.127:  Yeah. 

B.128:  anything.  Uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't.  I don't watch much
T V,

A.129:  Yeah. 

B.130:  but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly. 

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  And then, like I said, they do a lot of #internal,#

A.133:  # Internal.  #

B.134:  advertising on that kind of stuff. 

A.135:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.136:  # But, # I haven't seen anything. 

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.  I think
they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located. 

A.139:  Right.  Yeah.  That would probably,

B.140:  # You know.  So,#

A.141:  # be true.  #

B.142:  So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I. 

A.143:  Yeah.  Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise
on television, you know, they'll jus-, come up and say, you know, they'll show
you tho-, to encourage [sniffing],  to encourage recycling.  They'll,

B.144:  # Right.  #

A.145:  # say, # And here, those of us that ((Dumavra)) Power, which is our power
company,

B.146:  Uh-huh. 

A.147:  that, we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,

B.148:  Right [laughter]. 

A.149:  and they, and that, we do this for the community, they put those on.  So
I, so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and
just with voluntary,

B.150:  Right. 

A.151:  I think. 

B.152:  Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools,

A.153:  Uh-huh. 

B.154:  I mean they do things to try and recycle.  And, I know my kids, um, like
if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, Oh, look at that. 
Somebody is not saving the earth, [laughter]  you know. 

A.155:  Right.  Yeah. 

B.156:  So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you
know, and it's good to start the kids real young on,

A.157:  # I think so, too.# 

B.158:  # stuff like that.  #

A.159:  Yeah. 

B.160:  Because, I mean, when I was a kid, they never did stuff like that.  I mean,
it's like nobody was concerned about it. 

A.161:  Right.  Yeah.  We weren't,

B.162:  # You know, and it's like,#

A.163:  # concerned.  Yeah.  That's true.  #

B.164:  You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying,
Hey, you know,

A.165:  # Huh.  #

B.166:  # we're # ruining the earth, you know.  And now everybody is doing
something about, which is good.

A.167:  Uh-huh. 

B.168:  [Noise] But how come we weren't [/noise] doing this, say, twenty years ago
[breathing],

A.169:  # Yeah.  #

B.170:  # you # know?

A.171:  I, I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here in
the, up in the, uh, [lipsmack]  uh, the, the New Englands area and also in, in
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of
landfill. 

B.172:  Uh-huh. 

A.173:  And, and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in
two years unless we cut back.  And,

B.174:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.175:  # even # then, you know, we're really running out of space.  So, I think
that, that became, that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer
landfill space,

B.176:  Well,

A.177:  in some of the more crowded states. 

B.178:  Yeah.  This is,

A.179:  So, what, you know, and n-, no other state, I'm sure Texas probably still
has some landfill space.  They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your
garbage here. 

B.180:  Right [laughter]. 

A.181:  So, you know,

B.182:  # Yeah.  That's true.  #

A.183:  # realistically, you know, # we had, we really had to start, we have to
start recycling in some, some, uh, geographic areas.  It's really,

B.184:  I think,

A.185:  tough. 

B.186:  that it, it really surprises me because of the cost savings.  I mean, this
is such a tremendous,

A.187:  Uh-huh. 

B.188:  amount of cost savings.  I mean, why, [breathing]  I can't understand why
nobody saw that before.  I mean, even, even not --

A.189:  Uh-huh. 

B.190:  -- even the aspects of not saving the earth [breathing],  I,

A.191:  # Right.  #

B.192:  # mean, # it's,

A.193:  Yeah.  But, well,

B.194:  so cost, you know,

A.195:  Well, in some ways, I guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until
you have an industry around it, you know.  Because,

B.196:  # ((Bro-,)). #

A.197:  # I # know that, like in,

B.198:  yeah. 

A.199:  Pennsylvania, [noise] they require them to, um, [lipsmack] put their
newspaper for recycling.  But, [noise] the de-inking process that they have
to, they use,

B.200:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.201:  # to # take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused --

B.202:  Uh-huh. 

A.203:  -- um, is very expensive,

B.204:  # Oh.  #

A.205:  # and # also, it w-, it produces a, a waste, a, um, a,

B.206:  Oh. 

A.207:  liquid waste that they don't know what to do with [noise]  yet. 

B.208:  I see,

A.209:  # So, #

B.210:  # okay.  #

A.211:  even some aspects of recycling --

B.212:  Is not --

A.213:  -- they still have cost,

B.214:  -- real cost efficient.  #Oh, okay, okay.  Oh,#

A.215:  # yeah, cost efficient, yet.  Yeah.  #

B.216:  I,

A.217:  So,

B.218:  understand that though. 

A.219:  but others, you know, like tin cans and plastics,

B.220:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.221:  # are, # are really, uh, efficient, you know.  They,

B.222:  Right. 

A.223:  they melt on quickly and can be, you know, just because of the,

B.224:  and glass.  Right. 

A.225:  heating and things, ((getting)) glass.  Yeah. 

B.226:  Uh-huh. 

A.227:  So, i-, it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before. 

B.228:  Yeah.  That's true. 

A.229:  # Uh-huh.  Yeah.  #

B.230:  # And even, # I, I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to
recycle your oil. 

A.231:  Uh-huh. 

B.232:  And, I mean, that kind of surprises me [laughter].  I mean, you know,
because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they
could, you know, clean that up,

A.233:  # Yeah.  #

B.234:  # enough # to use it again, but they can. 

A.235:  Uh-huh. 

B.236:  Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,

A.237:  Yeah.  I d-, I don't know either.  That's, I know that though, I, e-, all
those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, [lipsmack] the
water table. 

B.238:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.239:  #You know,# they really pollute quickly and, you know, one, (( )), I was
reading some place the brake fluid, you put, brake fluid normally comes in just
small little pint containers. 

B.240:  Uh-huh. 

A.241:  That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water,

B.242:  # Wow.  #

A.243:  # you # know, like hundreds of gallons of water.  So, it's one of those
things that they really, um, [lipsmack]  and you wonder, you know, with all
these oil spills. 

B.244:  Yeah [breathing]. 

A.245:  How, how terrible that is [laughter]. 

B.246:  Yeah.  I know [breathing]. 

A.247:  Yeah, how terrible that is.  So, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes
on all that, I guess. 

B.248:  Really. 

A.249:  Uh-huh. 

B.250:  I know I really, I don't know, I, I think that, I mean, I think that they
really are doing a good thing now and I hope it keeps, well, I'm sure we'll
keep up.

A.251:  Yeah.  I,

B.252:  # You know,#

A.253:  # agree.  #

B.254:  I think it's really catching on. 

A.255:  Uh-huh. 

B.256:  You know, I, I think that, I'm not [noise]  sure if it, I don't know, I
think it's a good idea to make it mandatory [noise]. 

A.257:  I do, too. 

B.258:  Um, [noise] it, because like we were asking some people that live in, um,
North Dakota, Well, are you saving [/noise] your, you know, are you recycling.
And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet, so no.

A.259:  Uh-huh. 

B.260:  You know, so, I mean I don't know, I think that if people are forced, if
the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,

A.261:  # Yeah.  It ((d-,)), #

B.262:  # know.  I mean, # I don't know, I think a lot of people still will, but
[laughter], 

A.263:  Well, you know, if they're forced to do it [noise] it becomes sort of a
habit. 

B.264:  Right. 

A.265:  You know, I know that it's really funny.  My parents are forced to do it
and they,
