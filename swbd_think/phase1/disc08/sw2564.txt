==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Jay, I was thinking about, um, this topic, and I was remembering that
guy that does an advertisement on the radio about drug testing and marijuana,
whether or not marijuana causes any trouble or not --

B.2:  Right. 

A.3:  -- and he was saying how the train had wrecked because the guy had been
under the influence --

B.4:  Right. 

A.5:  -- and he said, whether you think, you know, you might think that it
doesn't effect anybody, but it does.

B.6:  Exactly. 

A.7:  So I think it's a good idea, is what I'm trying to say. 

B.8:  Well, I, I do too.  And, uh, uh, I work for Texas Instruments, and, and
they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in.  And, uh, I enjoy that
environment.  I, I want to be in, in a, you know, drug free environment.  And
I think that's a great way of promoting it --

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  -- is to have the drug testing. 

A.11:  I can see, now when you've been there a while, they were talking about
random testing.  

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  It seems like if there's no reason to suspect you, that I might be offended
if they asked me to come in and be tested.  You know what I mean.

B.14:  See T I just started that policy.  They have a random drug testing policy. 
And, uh, uh, {pause} it's random in the fact that you don't know when you're
going to be called, but everybody will be called. 

A.15:  And how often are they doing it?

B.16:  Uh, you mean like, uh, how, how often would you be called up?

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  Uh, you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up
once.  But, uh,

A.19:  You mean in a year's time or what?

B.20:  Uh, over the whole process.  I, this'll be an ongoing, uh, process, uh,
from now on.  But in, uh, a year's time you might be called up, I don't know,
twice or three times, and nobody called up any.  But the way they have it set
up, or the way I understand is that they want everyone, they've got it set up
where all current employees will be called on a random basis.

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  But, uh, you know, it's very likely that some may be called more, uh, more
than others. 

A.23:  Because they'd be suspect or what?

B.24:  No, just because of the random process of it.  And, uh, I don't know, they
talked about the, the statistics of it and how they've tried to figure out, you
know, to eliminate those problems, but anytime it's a purely random sample, uh,
you will have people called more, more than others. 

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Well, how do you feel about that?

B.26:  I'm, I'm all for it, because, uh, you know, uh, I want a, a drug free
environment, I don't want a, uh, even though I do work in the office, I'm a
financial analyst, I'm probably in no danger as far as any chemicals or
anything, uh, or machinery, but I still want people in my office, uh, to have a
professional demeanor about them and, uh, and not be under the influence when
they come in to work.  And, you know, I guess if they have the urge and they
have that habit, they can do that on their own time, but I feel like when we're
at work, uh, you know, it's a team atmosphere, and I think that would distract
from the team. 

A.27:  What if they did it on their own time, and it still, you know, it stays in
your body for such a long time. 

B.28:  Well, that's, that's true, and, and to me they're still under the influence
if it's in their body.  And, uh, I, have a strong feeling that I'm against
drugs.  And so, if anyone is using drugs, uh, uh, and it's in their system
when they're tested, then, you know, And T I has a pretty liberal, they, if
you're tested positive, then they automatically, uh, test you again.  And if
that one comes back positive [throat_clearing] then they send you to a, uh, a
drug rehab which T I pays for.

A.29:  Oh, that real good. 

B.30:  Huh. 

A.31:  That's real good. 

B.32:  What's that? 

A.33:  Drug rehab, and they'll send you to it, so if they did have a problem, they
can get over it. 

B.34:  Right. 

A.35:  I agree with that. 

B.36:  And, uh, so they send you to that, and then they monitor you, I believe, on
a weekly basis, you have to go in and take a test for, and this goes on for
several months. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  And, uh, if they, if you can prove to them that you've, I don't know,
cleaned your act up or whatever, then, then, uh, they won't terminate you, but
any time during that time if they do, uh, if you do test positive, then, uh,
it's automatic termination. 

A.39:  Hm. 

B.40:  So, uh. 

A.41:  Did you see that special about all these people that work on the road
crews, are putting these bridges up, and so many of them had tested positive
for drugs, and they haven't been putting these bridges together correctly.
And like,

B.42:  Are you serious?

A.43:  Yeah, and then, uh, on the lines for putting your automobiles together,
same thing --

B.44:  Right. 

A.45:  -- they're under the influence, and they're not doing the job right.  Now
that's,

B.46:  #Oh, man.#

A.47:  #scary, isn't# it. 

B.48:  That's right.  Well, and, you know, the same could be true at T I.  If
somebody's putting a missile together and they, you know, mess it up, and, then
that puts maybe a pilot or somebody at jeopardy. 

A.49:  Uh-huh. 
 
B.50:  And, uh, I don't know, I think any more that drugs are so prevalent, you
know, in our society that, that, uh, it may be up to the work place to help
try to control it.  Because it doesn't seem like any where else, uh, you know,
we're getting that assistance.  Because in schools, you know, I, I would hate
to have a young child, because I think it's going to be a tough, tough period
for young kids with, uh, you know, the drugs as rampant as they are.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Well I've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old
daughter. 

B.52:  I see. 

A.53:  And my son says, I don't understand this drug stuff.  Why don't people
understand all you have to do is say no? You know --

B.54:  Right. 

A.55:  -- and he doesn't realize the pressure that he's going to be under later
when his friends start doing this. 

B.56:  Exactly.  Or, uh, uh, an older peer will come up to him and try to get him
hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something, you know. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  And, uh, I know, uh, just growing up, I really looked up to the older guys,
especially if they played football or basketball or whatever, and, uh, I know
that, you know, it'd be real easy to be influenced by, by someone like that.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  Well, I teach, and last year a student that I'd had the year
before, so he would have been in third grade --

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  -- came to school with ice {pause}.

B.62:  Golly.  Now is this,

A.63:  #And I me-,#

B.64:  #cocaine type.#

A.65:  I don't, I don't know what it is [laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  It's supposed to be real inexpensive, I know that. 

B.68:  Oh, it is, huh. 

A.69:  And anyway, he's, he's like a special ed child --

B.70:  Right. 

A.71:  -- you know, and I could see he was probably selling it for these other
people, and we were doing these posters for drug, anti-drug campaign.  And all
these little first graders were always drawing these pictures of ice cream
truck.  And the teacher started talking to them, and they said that they were
selling drugs out of ice cream trucks now. 

B.72:  Golly.  That is terrible {pause}. But, I mean, that makes sense, because,
uh, that's where all the, the kids are, you know, you have the easy access to
them --

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  -- and, uh, you know, uh, they make, you know, that would be a logical, I
tell you what, these drug dealers are about the best business people there
are, because they know who the market is and they know exactly how to get to
the market.  If other businesses could do half as good as they do, then, uh,
there'd be some very profitable businesses {pause}. But unfortunately they prey
on, prey on the young kids.

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  So.  #But I don't,#

A.77:  #Do you think# we should do this in every profession?

B.78:  Uh, the drug testing?

A.79:  Uh-huh. 

B.80:  I do.  Uh, I know where my father works, he, he works for a government
contractor also, and, uh, uh, I believe any time you have a D O, a Department
of Defense contract, you have to have the drug testing.  And, you know, like,
uh, uh, athletes, are starting to test them for drugs.

A.81:  Uh-huh. 

B.82:  So I, I believe that it should be, you know, widespread, and that everyone
should be tested.  What do you think?

A.83:  [Breathing] I don't know.  Some jobs it seems like it would just maybe be a
waste of money, because who cares, you know --

B.84:  Right. 

A.85:  -- I mean, like, I don't know, what one would be an example --

B.86:  Like, like what about your,

A.87:  -- like should I say postal service or not, are they going to screw up on
mail. 

B.88:  Right.  What, what about teaching, uh, your profession. 

A.89:  Do I think they should?

B.90:  Do you think they should in that profession?

A.91:  Well, see, I don't really see the need of it, you know.  How many
elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs?

B.92:  Right.  Uh,

A.93:  [Laughter]. 

B.94:  I guess the only, the only concern I'd have,

A.95:  [Laughter]  You might feel like you need it. 

B.96:  Right, exactly, I guess the,

A.97:  I don't know, it would cost so much money, and I think we could use that
money in the [laughter]  schools, you know, to buy paper and (( )).

B.98:  Right.  You know, the only fear I would have would be that, uh, if I had a
child, that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs, my
child would be in their class. 

A.99:  Well, now, that's true, and in teaching you don't get rid of a teacher very
easy, you know. 

B.100:  That's right. 

A.101:  (( )).

B.102:  And teachers are very influential, too.
