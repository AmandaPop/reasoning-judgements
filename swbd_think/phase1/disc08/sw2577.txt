===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, [throat_clearing] several years ago, my very best friend moved to, back
to Grand Island, Nebraska.  And we had ridden bicycles and it was bothering my
knees that spring.  And we have lots of wind in Indiana, and I thought, oh,
shoot, I'll just walk to town.  And I guess that probably started me on a
career because I walk a lot.  In fact, it's a part of my life.  Every day I
walk at least two miles.  Uh, as a side effect, I noticed that I was firming
up.  So I thought, well, gosh, maybe if I diet, you know, this might be, work
out real well.  So I ended up losing about thirty-five pounds,

B.2:  Well, that's great.

A.3:  that spring and summer. And I had not thought of myself as a fat person.
And people would say to me, Gosh, I didn't, you know, you're really skinny.
Where'd this weight go?  Well, evidently I had some weight that I could afford
to lose because I'm certainly not skinny now.

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  But I guess everything just shook into place.  So walking, uh, is very much
a part of my life.  And since my husband's retirement, he has also started
walking with me.  And I guess I'd have to say it's a part of both of our
lives.  And we just recommend it to anyone who'll listen to us.

B.6:  Oh, I don't blame you.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Walking is, uh, you know, it's interesting because I think we went
through a, a phase there where it was jogging.  Everybody should jog.

A.9:  Well.

B.10:  You should get out, you should jog.  And then,

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  I started hearing about, Well, I'm not able to jog because I'm, I have
asthma.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And, um, uh, but I did like to walk.  And my neighbor and I get out, we'd
walk and walk.  And, uh, unfortunately, we haven't done it.  Well, I've been
in class until it's like seven thirty at night, and she,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  ha-, is having a flare up of arthritis.  And we haven't done it for in
about a month,

A.17:  Um.  

B.18:  now.  And, oh, gosh, do I notice a difference [laughter].

A.19:  Uh-huh.  Well, I was at the point where if I hadn't gotten my walk in, I
was a real grouch that day.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  And, uh, a friend gave me this Prevention walking magazine a year ago at
Christmas time.  And they recommend,

B.22:  Oh, neat.  

A.23:  that you only walk five times a week.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  That you do not walk every day.  But for me, the days that I don't, I'm
not much fun to be around.

B.26:  [Laughter] Well, you know, now, walking relieves a lot of tension and it's
a good way to work off, vent frustration, and things like this.

A.27:  Sure.

B.28:  I, I can't, I think, uh, uh, it depends on how far you walk, how many
days a week.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30: You know, if you, if you're walking ten miles, you know, seven days a week,
maybe that, uh, has some effect.  But, uh, I think if you're not walking, how
many, just out of curiosity, how many miles do you usually walk?

A.31:  At least two.

B.32:  Uh-huh. Well, you see, now that's what I do.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And, um, but th-, that's just about enough.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And, uh, uh, I mean, not that I wouldn't like to walk more, but, uh, um,
I've, I am a widow, so, uh, and I have a handicapped son, so I have to really
set my priorities,

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  of what, you know.  But this is one thing that I do enjoy very much
doing.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And, uh, so, but, you know, I have tried aerobics, and,

A.41:  Ah.

B.42:  I have trouble with that.  Uh,

A.43:  I jig when they jog.

B.44:  Yeah.  I know.  

A.45:  I just can't keep,

B.46:  I, I can't.  You,

A.47:  And, uh, the jogging was never for me because,

B.48:  No.

A.49:  my knees are not,

B.50:  Right.  Well, I, I have trouble. 

A.51:  I just don't think they could stand that so,  

B.52:  Right.  Well, I have trouble with one too.

A.53:  Um-hum.

B.54:  In fact, sometimes if I even just twist wrong, my kneecap will pop off.
So, you know,

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  um, walking seems to be the one, and it, it really seems to be the most
beneficial all the way around.

A.57:  Um-hum.

B.58:  It gets your circulation going good, it uh, uh, uh, it seems to have so
many other benefits, you know,

A.59:  Um.  Uh, 

B.60:  besides just the exercise.

A.61:  We're golfers also.  Uh, have you done that?

B.62:  Well, uh, no.  My, when my husband was living, he tried to ge-, he loved to
golf.

A.63:  Um-hum.   

B.64:  He was the avid golfer.  I used to go with him, but only to, uh, uh, be
caddy because, um, I have a very severe perceptual problem.

A.65:  Um.  

B.66:  And uh, I tried it a few time, but, uh, I can't get, y-, you have to
make it down to the hole [laughter],

A.67:  Yes.

B.68:  in, in six or seven times, you know.  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  And when it get more than that and, uh, so I just, it, went out for
the walk with him and enjoyed, you know, uh, pushing the cart, or pulling it,
or whatever, you know [laughter].

A.71:  Um-hum.  

B.72:  But that is, that's great.  My stepfather is seventy-four, and he goes
golfing every day.

A.73:  I think that's the beauty of the game.  That we, it's,

B.74:  Um-hum.

A.75:  it's a sport that we can participate in as we sink into the sunset, so to
speak.  And, of course, here in Indiana, the weather limits us quite a bit.
Our golf season will start and then stop due to weather and then start,

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  We had a,

B.78:  Sure.

A.79:  Last weekend it was just absolutely beautiful, and this weekend it's cold
and rainy.  So,

B.80:  Um-hum.

A.81:  so we're 

B.82:  Right.  

A.83:  pretty limited.  And I guess maybe that might be the one reason that we
would be forced into going, uh, south for part of the winter.

B.84:  Um-hum.

A.85:  Uh, our children live here and our home will always be here, but,

B.86:  Right.  I know what you mean.

A.87:  for better weather, we might consider that next winter.  I'm not,

B.88:  Well, you know it's interesting, what they've been, what they have, what
has really caught on here, is mall walking.

A.89:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  

B.90:  Now that has been something I think is really neat.

A.91:  Yes, yes. 

B.92:  The mall actually opens,

A.93:  Um-hum.

B.94:  an hour and a half earlier,

A.95:  Um.

B.96:  than the stores.  

A.97:  Um-hum.

B.98:  And it, so that people can come in in the winter time and walk.

A.99:  And it's so interesting because,

B.100:  Yes.  

A.101:  We made an extended drive as far west as San Diego, which I guess is as
far west as you can go, and down into Texas and then through Colorado on the
way home.  And we went to the malls to walk a lot, and that's a brotherhood
out there.  Those people are, you know, gosh, if Sophie wasn't here today,
let's go find her.  And they're really, they know who's supposed to be there
and what time they're supposed to come.  And when they're through walking,
they stop for coffee.  And it's, it's really neat.

B.102:  That is neat.  

A.103:  It's,

B.104:  You know, I like that.

A.105:  Yeah.  It's really neat.  I, and I, even as an outsider passing through
town, you know, after three laps around the exterior of this mall, they pretty
well know you, so [laughter],

B.106:  Um-hum.  That's right.

A.107:  It's, it's a fun thing to do.

B.108:  Yes, yes.  I think so.  

A.109:  Well, I, I must get back to work.  Nice chatting with you.

B.110:  Okay.  It was nice chatting with you.  

A.111:  Bye, bye.  

B.112:  Bye, bye.
