B.1:  Are you still there?

A.2:  Yes. 

B.3:  Okay, it worked out fine. 

@A.4:  Okay. 

B.5:  Well, we just ate out, um, had a big lunch actually because we both have
been working late and we had Italian, um, have you ever been to the Olive
Garden?

A.6:  No, I haven't, is that good?

B.7:  Yeah.  Well, do you really like Italian food?

A.8:  It-, it's not my favorite but,

B.9:  # Then don't, #

A.10:  # I like # it's okay. 

B.11:  Then this will probably, I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food,

A.12:  Uh-huh. 

B.13:  That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
but it's, um, [laughter]  you're not going to believe this but I have to tell
you this if I don't because you're in Plano,

A.14:  # That's okay.  #

B.15:  # but my, # um, softball unit here [laughter] is acting like he's dying of
((tramane)) poison [laughter]. 

A.16:  [Laughter]. 

B.17:  It wasn't that bad, actually it's very good it's all of these (( )) run
adult males,

A.18:  Uh-huh. 

B.19:  which I'm not Italian, no, it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the,

A.20:  # Oh.  #

B.21:  # salads # you can eat with an entree. 

A.22:  Oh, that sounds really good. 

B.23:  So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't but I was more in the mood for french
toast any way so,

A.24:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

B.25:  # so [laughter]  # I really like Italian food though, but do you have any
favorite?

A.26:  Well are there just the two of you?

B.27:  Uh, yes, uh-huh. 

A.28:  Okay, well, when my husband and I go out we have four children. 

B.29:  Oh, you're kidding. 

A.30:  So that makes a difference.  For us when we go out with the kids obviously
we want to go somewhere that we can, the fast food ones are probably the ones
they like the best. 

B.31:  Oh, sure. 

A.32:  But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive, so we like
to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price an-, and feed
the whole family,

B.33:  # Yeah.  #

A.34:  # and # like that. 

B.35:  You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for,

A.36:  # Right.  #

B.37:  # like # at Gatti's or something like that. 

A.38:  Right, but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a
little atmosphere and we usually head on down, um, oh what's the freeway down
here?

B.39:  Uh, six thirty-five?

A.40:  Yeah. 

B.41:  Uh-huh. 

A.42:  And there are, um, all along that, that freeway there are restaurant but
one of our favorites is Pappasito's.

B.43:  Oh, yeah, Pappasito's. 

A.44:  # No, we love to go there.  #

B.45:  # We went there on my birthday # in March it's great. 

A.46:  You know it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much
it's too,

B.47:  too much like a bar naturally,

A.48:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

B.49:  # and Mexico, # yeah, I know, I've seen it. 

A.50:  But I love the food I love the food,

B.51:  # The food is probably, #

A.52:  # the food is great.  #

B.53:  I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means but it's probably the best
tasting, I don't know would you classify that as Tex-Mex?

A.54:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.55:  Um, the shredded beef the type of,

A.56:  # Yeah.  #

B.57:  # spices # or sauces they use. 

A.58:  Uh-huh, I like to get that, uh, a shrimp it's a shrimp dish,

B.59:  # Really.  #

A.60:  # and # I don't remember the name of it,

B.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.62:  # but # it's rolled up into, into something, and oh, it's really good. 

B.63:  I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious. 

A.64:  Yeah, they are really good. 

B.65:  Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only
thing I don't like about it too it's a little bit with th-, the meat market
atmosphere, you know.

A.66:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.67:  Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, um, be
around not be around that. 

A.68:  Yeah. 

B.69:  Um, I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat.  The one thing I
notice is it's just, um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with
four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, I mean we find prohibited,

A.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.71:  # ((just to))# cost any more?

A.72:  Yeah. 

B.73:  I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars. 

A.74:  Yeah, it's very expensive. 

B.75:  Yeah, I don't know how you feel about that but I think that some of it's
over priced. 

A.76:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.77:  I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are
[laughter],

A.78:  [Laughter]  Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a,

B.79:  Yeah, it is I don't know, um,

A.80:  No, sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark,

B.81:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.82:  # um, # go to the August Moon which is down there it's a Chinese,

B.83:  # Oh, yeah, my husband likes that.  #

A.84:  # uh, restaurant with the lions in # the front,

B.85:  yeah, off of Arapaho down there?

A.86:  yeah, and,

B.87:  Yeah, August Moon, uh-huh. 

A.88:  Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese, but Chinese isn't my favorite so,

B.89:  I don't like it at all usually so [laughter]. 

A.90:  But he likes it kind of so he ((heats us up a good fight)) now, me I'm like
I said seafood I'm, I like that. 

B.91:  Yeah, I love seafood,

A.92:  # So.  #

B.93:  # and # I, I like a lot of different ethnic foods.  I like Japanese food. 
There's a place on Greenville called ((Sagar's)).

A.94:  Um. 

B.95:  Well, we haven't been in years down near ((Presby)), and I had a meeting
down there today and I saw that and I said, gee I remember that they offer you,
um, authentic Japanese feeding,

A.96:  # Oh.  #

B.97:  # or # American or piano bar, and I remember when we went [laughter], 

A.98:  # [Laughter].  #

never had saki. 

A.100:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  [Laughter]. 

B.103:  but if you're looking for a very, uh, it's very pretty inside,

A.108:  Yeah.

called Grishman's in Greenville,

A.110:  # I don't know that place.  #

B.111:  # which was really over priced.  #

A.112:  Was it?

B.113:  Uh-huh.  They had a great desert bar. 

A.114:  Um. 

B.115:  [Laughter].

looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is
something called a McDonald's.

A.146:  Oh, I'm telling you. 

B.147:  It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then. 

A.148:  Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different
things,

B.149:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.150:  # and # so there's a H Avenue down here,

B.151:  # Uh-huh, I know where that, #

A.152:  # and along are these fast # food restaurants [laughter]. 

B.153:  Right that's all,

A.154:  So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our
own thing,

B.155:  # [Laughter].  #

A.156:  # and # then we go to park over there so we can all have our own. 

B.157:  # Well, that's all right as long as, #

A.158:  # that's on the nights we can't decide.  #

B.159:  I was going to say because with six people how do you, um, cause with two
we have a problem, I mean I can't even imagine, you know, trying to, um, you
sound like you're doing pretty well with four children. 

A.160:  Well, five of them, they're good,

B.161:  That's the way the,

A.162:  kids. 

B.163:  Yeah, well, we're getting ready to I shouldn't say this on this
conversation, but it's just on my mind, we're getting ready to go overseas to
adopt. 

A.164:  Oh, how nice. 

B.165:  Yeah, we're excited,

A.166:  It will be neat. 

B.167:  I think it will be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of, this is
food so I can say this, but they, you have to bring a formula, and I said
what's that [laughter].

A.168:  [Laughter]. 

B.169:  [Laughter]  They laughed and I said well, you know, I'm. 

A.170:  # Food's, food.  #

B.171:  # thirty something, #

A.172:  # Yeah.  #

B.173:  # and # ((I think that)) that would make them drool any way. 

A.174:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.175:  You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot
of restaurants don't take, in terms of talking about restaurants, I mean are a
lot of restaurants, how are they when you have children let alone three or four
children?

A.176:  You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that,

B.177:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.178:  # that # really is more adults you know,

B.179:  # Sure.  #

A.180:  # with # the atmosphere and everything, they, if you're, like we could
probably take our oldest son and,

B.181:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.182:  # and # our oldest daughter. 

B.183:  Uh-huh. 

A.184:  And they know how to act,

B.185:  # Yeah.  #

A.186:  # I # don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're
just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for
that atmosphere kind of thing. 

B.187:  That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah. 

A.188:  Yeah. 

B.189:  Yeah. 

A.190:  So. 

B.191:  I just, I just, I've been in some places where they say they take children,
and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude, you
know. 

A.192:  Yeah. 

B.193:  And that always just bothered me and then, um, on the other hand sometimes
the children or the adults are themselves [laughter]. 

A.194:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.195:  I don't know what other kind of restaurants really Pappasito's we love, um,
we went to one Italian, back on the Italian, we went to some place across from
Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food. 

A.196:  Oh. 

B.197:  I can't remember the name of it it's on, uh,

A.198:  Is it Tia's, not Tia's, um,

B.199:  No, that's Mexican, um, right across from on the Dillard's side there,

A.200:  Yeah, I know which one it is, and I can't think of it. 

B.201:  I can't, yeah it's in the strip, yeah, and it had white tablecloth, I think
it was like paper where you could write on them, or something with crayons it
was just terrible. 

A.202:  Oh [laughter]  dear. 

B.203:  I mean I was shocked, I mean the dish was dirty, um,

A.204:  It was one of these you have bad experience and,

B.205:  # Yeah, where you felt like, #

A.206:  # say I don't think I'll # come back here. 

B.207:  like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something. 

A.208:  Oh [laughter]  dear. 

B.209:  Um. 

A.210:  Oh. 

B.211:  Boy, but other then that I don't know we, we do our share of pizza eating
too, but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too,

A.212:  # Oh.  #

B.213:  # cheap # to pay the delivery [laughter]. 

A.214:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

B.215:  I don't like strange people coming to my door, um,

A.216:  Well, I, I've got selv-, one of my favorites were and I can't really think
of any other, um, places. 

B.217:  No, except that this makes me fat.  No, I'm just kidding. 

A.218:  [Laughter]  Yeah, you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true. 

B.219:  Yeah, that's true, but you can always blame it on having children, no
[laughter]. 

A.220:  [Laughter]  Yeah, there you go. 

B.221:  Well, I enjoyed talking to you, and I guess, you know,

A.222:  Well, good luck. 

B.223:  Maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere. 

A.224:  Yeah, maybe.
