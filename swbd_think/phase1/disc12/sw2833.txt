============================================================================

@A.1:  Yeah, so, uh, what do you feel about the universal health insurance issue?

B.2:  Well, I'm not really very much in favor of it at all.  Uh, I feel like, uh,
the government gets involved in, in a little bit too much of our life anyway
and health insurance is, is one thing that I'm not sure that they have the
expertise to, to run it anyway, and I just, I kind of feel like, like I say,
we've got too much government already.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  I guess my, my initial reaction would be that, that I would be for
it mainly from the standpoint that, that I find, uh, my health insurance not
very effective,

B.4:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.5:  # and # very expensive. 

B.6:  Yeah. 

A.7:  And so I, you know, am [laughter]  probably being very naive, I'm hoping
that, that by, by centralizing it, it might get better and be cheaper. 

B.8:  Well, I guess, I, I, I guess my, my own opinion of, of, uh, government
programs in general, especially those that are centralized type, you know,
centralizing type of programs I have not seen one yet that, that, that I, I
felt like really worked the way it should.  I think that, uh, the private
sector has, uh, a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make
a program work whereas a bureaucracy, uh, people that work in a bureaucracy
are just there to keep the bureaucracy going.

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  So, uh,

A.11:  What about things like, in Sweden, isn't, isn't that sort of a centralized,
or in lots of places in Europe. 

B.12:  Yeah, well, I guess, like I said, I, I, I don't really know that much about
it.  I, I've mine may be more prejudice than opinion, you know.  I, I guess
I've got, uh, uh, prejudice against the government,

A.13:  # Uh-huh {faint}. #

B.14:  # you know, # I --

A.15:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.16:  -- I feel like, I feel like too much government is too much government
[laughter]. 

A.17:  Right.  I, you know, I guess I can certainly agree with that, but, uh, you
know, like I said I feel like being,

B.18:  # Yeah.  #

A.19:  # being # stung every time [laughter]. 

B.20:  Yeah.  I, I know that, uh, the British, like I say, I know I understand
that the British system which is, you know, centralized medical program does
not work very well, or at least the people are not real happy with it.

A.21:  Oh, I see. 

B.22:  And, uh, I, I, that's my understanding anyway. 

A.23:  Uh-huh, uh-huh {faint}.

B.24:  And, uh, so,

A.25:  Yeah, I knew they had one, but I just, I guess I assumed it worked,

B.26:  # Yeah {faint}. #

A.27:  # which is, # is,

B.28:  # Yeah {faint}. #

A.29:  # uh, not # good. 

B.30:  You know, when you, when you read, uh, see the, some of the articles or, or
watch, in particular, watch some of the British made television shows, you get
the impression that it's, it's more or less a joke, you know, a lot of people
use it because they don't have an alternative --

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  -- uh, an, a-, affordable alternative.  But they're, you know, they still,
it doesn't work very well.  I know here in Texas, in the Dallas area, we have
a, uh, a county run hospital --

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  -- you know, the county furnishes the hospital, and people that don't have,
uh, access to, to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital.  But if
you go there, if you're, you know, if you've got an emergency, you have to be
almost dead before you can get in, you know, in a timely manner, because there
are so many people sitting there waiting all the time,

A.35:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.36:  # for # medical services that, you know, it, you may be there five or six
hours, you know, for just normal treatment. 

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.38:  And I guess I'm not, uh, I'm not too keen on having to go to, to a, some
kind of a location like that --

A.39:  Right. 

B.40:  -- on a routine basis. 

A.41:  Uh-huh.  Maybe, I don't know much about H M O -s, but my impression is
maybe, maybe some, H M O -s are sort of a low form of centralization. 

B.42:  Well, I guess, uh, to some extent.  A, an H M O, I have been involved, have
been a member of an H M O before for a short period of time --

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  -- and that did work very well, but it was, you know, the c-, it was a
company sponsored plan,

A.45:  # Um.  #

B.46:  # and # it, it is, you know, individual doctors that do own or have a, you
know, have a shareholders in an H M O. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  And, uh, so it's not, I guess, uh, it's not a, it's not a government run
operation,

A.49:  # Right.  #

B.50:  # and # that's, that's, you know, that's my main objection.  I, you know, I
don't care how they finance it --

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  -- you know, th-, they could, they could put a tax on me and say this is
for medical insurance and then hire a, you know, some kind of private company
that's not run by a government to, you know, to run the program --

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  -- and that might work, but if it's, if it's going to be run, you know, and
supervised at a government level by a bureaucratic type, you know, operation --

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  -- uh, I don't think it's going to work, myself. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  I d-, I do think that we're headed that way.  I think that there's a strong
possibility that, in my lifetime I will see, you know, see one in operation so,

A.59:  Uh-huh.  Is that because of, of the cost, or, or government wants it, you
think?

B.60:  Well, I think, I think that, uh, I there are that want it --

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  -- uh, and I think the government will respond, you know, to, when I say a
lot of people, I'm not saying a majority of people, but I think the government
will respond to that group that does want it. 

A.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.64:  So, you know,

A.65:  # Well, that's {faint}, #

B.66:  # I guess I, # I, I'm a, I'm a pessimist in that, in that respect
[laughter]. 

A.67:  [Laughter]  Well, but that's interesting because, you know, it's, it's, I
don't know that much about it, but my initial response would be more favorable
and, and perhaps I need to, to learn more about it,

B.68:  # Well, just, #

A.69:  # so that # I'm not so naive on it. 

B.70:  A-, a-, and, and perhaps mine, too, you know,

A.71:  [Breathing]. 

B.72:  perhaps I, I need to know, have stronger arguments for why I are, or, or
find out the other arguments in favor of, you know, so,

A.73:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  But, uh, but that's, I guess that's I had not thought about before so,

A.75:  Right.  Well, it was nice talking to you. 

B.76:  Yeah, it was nice talking to you, too. 

A.77:  #Okay.# 

B.78:  #Okay.#  Thanks. 

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye. 

B.80:  Bye.
