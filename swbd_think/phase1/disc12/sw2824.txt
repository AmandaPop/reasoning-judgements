==========================================================================

A.1:  The invasion of privacy is a topic that gets some people kind of mad.  I
don't mind it too much.  Uh, it's more of a bother sometimes than it is, uh, a
real invasion to me, in that, uh, some of the purchases that you make, if you
make them with a credit card in a given location for a given amount.  All that
stuff goes into a big computer data base and tends to go to the marketing
schemes and then they will hound you forever for a particular purchase like
that.  Uh, one of the, the, uh, cards, little, little card I answered in the
mail that had a bunch of topics, would you be interested in this, be interested
in that, an it was kind of a little survey type deal and I checked off a few
things and just out of curiosity once I decided to see what would happen if I,
if I checked off, uh, about some stock, uh, portfolio information as it were,
f-, the different investors and within about a month, I would say I had ten,
fifteen calls from different brokers, uh, asking me questions, all sorts of
things about what I would be wi-, interested in investing in and how much I had
to invest and, and I was kind of curious and I guess I got my answer.  But, it
was, uh, a bit much, and to this day it has continued considerably.  It's, I
guess it's going to be hard to get off of that little list now. 

B.2:  Yeah. 

A.3:  Uh, other little forms of, of, uh, not really an invasion, it's public
record, it's, it's not, uh, not even, they never told you it would be
considered private, but whenever you buy a house, uh, the purchase price is
there for everybody to see.  Where it's located is there and, and, uh,
companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the, at
the records office and take down all this, this information and put it into
their format so that they can put it on to their computer and,

B.4:  # Right.  #

A.5:  # and, # know that a given neighborhood is at a given age group.  They,
they know a lot about you for the, on that one transaction and they know
roughly what your income is if you're affording a house of that size,

B.6:  # Right.  #

A.7:  # so # they want to send you literature for vacations to, whatever, because
you're in that bracket.  And marketing, is, uh, seems to be the driving factor
for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them, so. 

B.8:  Right, yeah I guess the telephone solicitation is the one that comes to my
mind. 

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  To me that's, uh, it's inexcusable.  If you want to come and want my money,
come and convince me, don't call me on the phone. 

A.11:  Yeah that's true.  I, I guess that's, uh, where the old answering machine
comes into play,

B.12:  # Yeah.  #

A.13:  # Just # screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't have that,
that problem [throat_clearing]. 

B.14:  I just keep my phone number listed under a separate name, and when someone
calls for that name, I know that they're soliciting,

A.15:  # Yeah.  #

B.16:  # and # I just tell them no, they got the wrong number. 

A.17:  That's the way to do it, yeah. 

B.18:  Works pretty good. 

A.19:  Well the other, some of the other problems, of course, are, are, uh,
invasions that are more along the lines of theft, where people have allowed
their carbon copies of their, uh, cards to get a way from them.  The credit
cards purchases and people will, uh, take those and maybe steal some,
something off that number or just use that, that information as, uh, you, you
purchased this then, you know at that time, because that information is not
always open to the public, yea-, you can't always get out and find every
transaction that a person makes on their MasterCard of Visa, but, uh, a lot
of, of, um, credit references, uh, when you, dial that in to find out, well
what's their latest rating, uh, that kind of information you don't always want
everybody to know, but, uh, it's going across, uh, computer lines and people
can pick up what they want, so.

B.20:  Right. 

A.21:  And then there's the whole issue of, of, uh, cellular telephones and, and
house portable phones.  Uh, people consider that an invasion of privacy to
have, uh, someone listening in on their, their phones, and ironically the laws
have, has classified one of them as illegal to listen to and the other one
not.

B.22:  # Right.  #

A.23:  # So # it's kind of a strange deal.  Do you have a phone that, uh,

B.24:  # No, I don't have a cordless.  #

A.25:  # people, cordless that people can listen # in on.  I don't either, but,
uh, I, I, happen to have a radio that will pick up that range.  It, it's very
seldom that you can get, uh, you just happen to be within a couple of houses
of that person and you have to listen at the exact right time,

B.26:  # Right.  #

A.27:  # and # it's fairly staticky and on occasion you'll get two to three of
them at once because the radios usually don't have the control that's needed
to screen them out,

B.28:  # Right, #

A.29:  # and # it's not the worlds most interesting thing to listen to, but, uh,
it, it can be done relatively cheaply and I guess some people for lack of
anything else to do, do that kind of thing. 

B.30:  I guess a lot of the data that's being taken with, you know, the advent of
the computer, [breathing]  a lot of the data that's being taken on, everybody,
you know, your social security number,

A.31:  # Right.  #

B.32:  # is # tied to just everything about you and I think that constitutes an
invasion of privacy.  Not so much the fact that the data is there but the way
that it's being compiled,

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.34:  # and # I think the government uses is quite a bit.  You know, if they,
they want to do a che-, background check on you, they've got y-, everything on
you from the time you got that social security card --

A.35:  Right. 

B.36:  -- and to me, that's an invasion of my privacy. 

A.37:  Yeah, it's kind of sad when they,

B.38:  They know to where you've worked, where you've been, what you've done, you
know, any,

A.39:  # Right.  #

B.40: # any # kind of [breathing], uh, you know, you name anything that's ever
happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or
your driver's license.

A.41:  It's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you with
[clicking]  because there's very few, you know, some people use it just because
it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to, yeah, you can now
identify that person, it's not quite so private anymore, and, uh, I don't know,
i-, very little of the information I give out really bothers me, but as far as
whether I care if anybody else had it, but, uh, I guess the idea that if you
ever let it become a, an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never
be able to get that privilege back. 

B.42:  # Right.  #

@@A.43:  # [Laughter]  # Once gone, it's going to be gone forever, so.  Well, I
think we've just about covered the topic.  I'm going to go ahead and let you
go.  I got to get back to work here. 

B.44:  Okay. 

A.45:  Talk to you later, maybe. 

B.46:  All right, bye. 

A.47:  Bye.
