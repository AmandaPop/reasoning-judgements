=============================================================================

A.1:  Well do you think we're paying too much in taxes right now?

B.2:  Well frankly I think we're paying too little.  I think we have paid too
little since Reagan and them decided to cut it.  Uh, I used to get these, uh,
surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if I thought it was
a good idea for them to cut taxes and I kept saying no, I felt like what we
ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were.  Well granted
maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be, uh, that is curtail the
spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut, but,
uh, I always felt like the Congress, uh, just ought to shoulder
responsibilities of biting the bullet, uh, that they, uh, uh, are supposed to
be able to, uh, you know, handle, shoulder.

A.3:  # Yeah.  #

B.4:  # And, # uh, cut their spending and if they had, uh, done that without
cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in the economic quagmire we're in
now.

A.5:  Yeah, well I think too many people are not paying enough taxes.  Some are
paying too much, uh, the, the middle class,

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # but # the, uh, upper class, the wealthy people are not paying enough.  I
think the le-, that there ought to be legislation that make, makes it more
equitable for, uh,

B.8:  # Well you, #

A.9:  # depending on # how much you earn. 

B.10:  so you like the progressive income tax. 

A.11:  Yeah, I sure do, uh-huh, I w-, think everybody ought to be paying their
fair share.

B.12:  # Well.  #

A.13:  # There # still too many loopholes available to, to get by with. 

B.14:  Well, I, I thought they had closed most of the, uh, loopholes when they
came out with this, uh, pretty well constant fixed tax type, uh, about the
only, well, I know there are a few, you're right about that.  But primarily
the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your,
your first and second home mortgages.  The interest that is.

A.15:  Yeah, right. 

B.16:  And that was about it.  Now I think there are still some real estate
oriented type tax hedges. 

A.17:  They cut it back on rental property income. 

B.18:  # Yeah.  #

A.19:  # That, # uh, you can't, uh, get, uh, tax deductions on, uh, say a second,
third, fourth house that you own, on paying, uh, taxes on, on that. 

B.20:  Yeah, well that's where the rich, see, uh,

A.21:  # Right.  #

B.22:  # certainly # have a second, third, and fourth, fifth house. 

A.23:  And they also cut back on things like limited partnerships. 

B.24:  Right, uh, in what way, what loopholes then are, are left that you're
talking about?

A.25: Well the maximum tax bracket is twenty-eight percent, so nobody can
pay any, # than, th-, right.  #

B.26:  # Right, well thirty-three # if you're in that hump, but, yeah, but, uh,
uh, uh, I, I felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax.

A.27:  I think that's right too, I agree with that. 

B.28:  Because i-, i-, fo-, for once, finally with taxes having been cut it makes
the little investor like myself capable, if you're able to set aside a little
money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks, without getting it
all taken away from you. 

A.29:  Sure. 

B.30:  And you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some
money to be able to invest in stocks and bonds and various things like that,
then to get it stuck to you again,

A.31:  # Right.  #

B.32:  # seems # just a little bit unfair. 

A.33:  Right, I'm saying the way our taxes are structured right now, it does not
encourage saving. 

B.34:  No, it really doesn't, but on the other hand, how, how, um, how would we
change it to encourage saving. 

A.35:  Um, well, tha-, [laughter]  that's a good question. 

B.36:  And go back to things like tax free I R A -s and the like that they wound
up coming back.

A.37:  Yeah, I agree with that, that, that's, uh, I, uh,

B.38:  Okay, yeah, I thought that was a good move too. 

A.39:  Yeah, I think I wish we would do that. 

B.40:  That certainly in,

A.41:  I'm in a bracket right now where I cannot take advantage of an I R A,
getting a tax deduction on it. 

B.42:  I hear you. 

A.43:  I used to be able to do that but I can't now. 

B.44:  # Yeah.  And now the, tha-, #

A.45:  # There's also the problem now # where I've got some contributions that
were tax deductible and some that aren't and I have to keep those separate.

B.46:  Right, yeah, and that's absolutely unfair.  I agree.  And it seems like
every time Congress and, and, and, uh the presidency gets a set up like the,
had.  Now see that's the kind of tax cuts I'm for.  Not necessarily just a, a
broad range tax cut on salaries so much, but tax cuts where they don't tax
savings of various kinds, you know, savings where you're willing to tie your
money up at least some minimum period of time, s-, some, um, minimum number of
years and the like, like I R A -s were, uh, i-, i-, that, that, those are
reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on,

A.47:  # Yeah.  #

B.48:  # and # not just the rich alone.  But, uh, uh, seems like every time that,
uh, people begin to make a little money at that, and a lot of people jumped on
I R A -s, I mean, you di-, you apa-, you apparently did and a lot of people I
know did too.

A.49:  I still do contribute to an I R A,

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # even # though I can't take advantage of any tax breaks. 

B.52:  Yeah, well I'm in one too, but it seems like as soon as they, uh, got to
going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to
form out there, they wanted to come in and tax it again. 

A.53:  Sure. 

B.54:  And, and, uh, tha-, that's only, again, because they would not, uh, uh,
police themselves and their spending. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  And I, I don't know, I, I don't know what else to do about it.  I mean
seems like we are, are, are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and
Democratic Congresses, or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and
they can't ever seem to get together.

A.57:  Yeah, well, I think one of the things that may-, maybe does en-, encourage,
uh, saving in a small way is that you can't write off taxes on personal
spending. 

B.58:  Right. 

A.59:  Uh, that may keep, a-, again that may cause a recession as well though,
because it keeps people from goin-, going out and charging their credit cards,
uh, to the max.  And it cuts down on, uh, how much, uh, spending their going
to, uh, do for the year.

B.60:  Do you think this latest interest cu-, rate cut that the Fed just went
through is going to, uh, get people back on the spending. 

A.61:  I'm not so sure about that, uh, we're still, uh, in a recession, as such,
and, uh,

B.62:  # Yeah.  #

A.63:  # it, # that ta-, that cut in the, in the prime,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # has # not encouraged activity in the market yet.  I think people are
going to follow the stock market.  If, if it takes off, um, that's a good
indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start
spending again.  Right now,

B.66:  # Well.  #

A.67:  # a # lot of people are fearful about their jobs.  There are a lot of
layoffs, # yo-, kno-, unemployment's way up, and, uh, #

B.68:  # Oh yeah, I know exactly how you # feel.  # Right.  #

A.69:  # they're # just saving money, uh, until things get better. 

B.70:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I, uh, was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to
think it was going to make a difference, but I said hey, if a lot of people
are all ready borrowed up to the hilt, I don't care how cu-, low you cut
taxes, they can't afford to borrow anymore, or they won't just because they
want to try to get a handle on what they have.  Th-, you, you've got to cut
them drastically, such that the, uh, idea of refinancing at a lower interest
rate becomes the thing to do.

A.71:  Right, well you can do that with say a mortgage payment, but they charge so
many points in order to refinance,

B.72:  # Yeah, and # -- 

A.73:  # a lot of # people can't afford that. 

B.74:  -- that's right.  Or, or, less the break is considerable between the, the
interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage to no more than
nine percent mortgage, that's not enough.  You've got to get down to eight,
maybe even seven and a half. 

A.75:  Yeah, well that's basically what we're doing right now, is, uh, people, a
lot of people have eleven percent mortgages,

B.76:  # Yeah.  #

A.77:  # and # they can get nine percent now, but it costs them three points to do
that. 

B.78:  # And that's not enough,#

A.79:  # Three percent of, #

B.80:  you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that. 

A.81:  yeah, three percent of their mo-, mortgage right now, or, or of the, uh,
principal that's left on their loan is, uh, a significant chunk of change. 

B.82:  That's right. 

A.83:  And, uh, a lot of people aren't, aren't in a position to take advantage of
that. 

B.84:  So, I, I, I'm not so sure myself that, uh, that cutting interest rates is
going to do it, or cutting taxes either.  I just think we've gotten ourselves
so, uh, gone through such a, a, a period of time where we've been so credit
hungry and, um, we have gotten, uh, uh, so out on a limb, in debt, not only,
uh, federal debt, but consumer debt too, that, uh, I'm really concerned
whether any kind of taxation, one way or the other is going to make a
difference.

A.85:  Yeah, well another thing that, uh, kind of irks me right now is I just got
my tax appraisal on my house,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # and # it went up ten thousand dollars from last year. 

B.88:  Well you know, that's what's happened to me. 

A.89:  # There's, #

B.90:  # I # got my appraisal, well we get them up here, they give them to you
three years out. 

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  I mean yo-, you get one every year but it, it, it puts in at a, what they
expect it to be for the next three years, you know,

A.93:  # Right.  #

B.94:  # based # on what it is right now.  Subject to change of course, and, uh,
real estate values up here, in, in the, uh, uh, uh, eastern corridor have
dropped about two and a half to five percent. 

A.95:  Real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past,
uh, two years.

B.96:  Okay, well see, the pressure's more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as
bad,

A.97:  # Right.  #

B.98:  # because # the population being what it is, but nevertheless it's dropped.
But, uh, this hasn't been reflected in my appraisals.  And I was just telling
my wife the other night, you know, I says, I, I wonder who it is you talk to
here in the state ab-, about protesting this because if, and only, uh,
interest rates, I'm sorry, uh, property values don't come back up, which means
I can see that I can, uh, get again, at least what I could have gotten for my
house a year ago, then I'm not being fairly appraised.

A.99:  Right.  There's no justification here for an increase in, uh, the value of
a home.  The property values are still going down, and I'm not sure they've
hit the bottom yet.  So, uh, when, when they --

B.100:  Um, in the Texas area?

A.101:  -- yes,

B.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.103:  # when # they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not,
uh, real estate prices have not been going up.  Uh, there's too many, too many
homes on the market right now. 

B.104:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.105:  # Too many # people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them,
their abandoning, abandoning their homes. 

B.106:  Is a lot of that going on?

A.107:  Oh yes, there's two homes on my street right now that,

B.108:  Um, that's going to put the banks in dire straights. 

A.109:  Sure. 

B.110:  Because the banks don't want the property.  They want the money. 

A.111:  That's right, there are a lot of banks that are in trouble.  We've had banks
that have been closing for the past two years in Texas.  We've got a record
number of banks,

B.112:  # Yeah.  #

A.113:  # that # have been, go-, all ready gone under. 

B.114:  Well, do you see where the tax situation could really help that any?

A.115:  Uh, no, I don't, I think that's mostly with the economy and the job market.

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  But I think it's unfair that, uh, the tax appraisal has gone up this year,
when in fact the, uh,

B.118:  # Oh, I do too.  #

A.119:  # the value of the # homes has not. 

B.120:  Yeah, yeah, I think it's absolutely unfair.  But they've gotten into this
mentality and, uh, I don't think they know how to appraise a house down.

A.121:  Yeah, I don't know, h-, what they use to justify that, uh, because say I've
got the same model home as some of my neighbors and they're all appraised at
the same level,

B.122:  # Yeah.  #

A.123:  # even # though I've made more improvements on my house,

B.124:  # Yeah.  #

A.125:  # than # somebody else has.  And nobody comes out to take a look and see
what you've done to get a proper appraisal. 

B.126:  Now out here they do.  They take pictures of house and everything and what
they do is they look at what your particular model, at least three of them have
sold for within the last twelve months or later if, if they have the data. 

A.127:  # Okay.  #

B.128:  # They # don't always have that much data because they may not have sold
that many of your model. 

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # But # here they co-, for instance I, I've had to, they do it randomly
more or less, but they try to get three at a time over a twelve month period
because, uh, one of the houses I sold, I'm in my third house now, I, uh, my
second house, I actually had an appraiser come out and take pictures of it,
uh, that he had to go,
