======================================================================

A.1:  [Beep]  Okay obviously, the team that I support would be the Cowboys. 

B.2:  Uh-huh. 

A.3:  Uh, I say that I support them, there's been just so much that's happened to
that team since they got rid of Tom Landry, that was just like, you know,
blasphemy around here [laughter].  So,

B.4:  Well, and, uh, we felt the same way. 

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  He was an institution, and how,

A.7:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.8:  # How could # they do that? 

A.9:  I know, I know.  I don't think I'll ever forget when one of my friends
called me and said, you're not going to believe this, because I had not heard
it, you know, and they said they have fired Tom Landry, it's like [breathing],
you know, what slander, how could they do such a thing [breathing].  So, uh,
ever, you know, since that I used to be such a, an avid fan, you know, it was
ridiculous, but now, quite honestly I, I think that I support the Oilers as
much as anybody,

B.10:  # Um.  #

A.11:  # you # know, just because it is a Texas team, but I cannot stand Jimmy
Johnson or Jerry Jones [laughter]. 

B.12:  Can't stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry,

A.13:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.14:  Well, uh, you know, I was just trying, I was just trying to think of, uh,
who, who our coaches of Houston Oilers,

A.15:  # Yeah.  #

B.16:  # you # probably know. 

A.17:  Yeah, I really, I don't e-,

B.18:  # Uh.  #

A.19:  # I # don't know now. 

B.20:  It'll probably come to me, but, I was thinking of,

A.21:  Yeah, I just, I think of Bum Bright, you know, but that's been many, many,
many years ago. 

B.22:  Yeah, well, Bum, Bum Phillips?

A.23:  Yeah, Bum Phillips, I'm sorry, yeah. 

B.24:  Yeah, well, he's the one that we couldn't believe that they, they let go. 

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  And then we had Jerry Glanville,

A.27:  # Yeah.  #

B.28:  # who # is guess is now in Atlanta,

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # and # now we get the guy who was the University of Houston --

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  -- head coach for many years.  It'll come to me in a minute. 

A.33:  Yeah, I can't, I can't think. 

B.34:  So we did pretty well.  Uh,

A.35:  Yeah, how did you feel about having, about Jerry Glanville?

B.36:  Oh,

A.37:  You know, people either hate him or they, they like him quite a bit. 

B.38:  Well, I didn't really hate him or anything,

A.39:  # Yeah.  #

B.40:  # but, # I think the image of the team as a whole just had a real dark
image and,

A.41:  # Yeah.  #

B.42:  # he, # he wanted to make these, you know the, uh, kind of like the Oakland
Raiders used to be,

A.43:  # Right.  #

B.44:  # the # real bad team,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # and # they were,

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # they # were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really, you
just really get ticked off.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.50:  When your team keeps getting these stupid penalties,

A.51:  # [Laughter].  #

B.52:  # and # they don't seem to, you know,

A.53:  # Yeah.  #

B.54:  # I # mean, that's just terrible and,

A.55:  Yeah, it's, it's, you know, it aggravates me no end when you're talking
about a really close game and then they do something stupid like start a fight
or you know, they have, they have something like that called, and then that is
aggravating, yeah. 

B.56:  Uh-huh, or do something where, where, you know, it puts the other team in a
better advantage and, you know,

A.57:  # Right.  #

B.58:  # just # for some stupid things that we probably could have done better,

A.59:  # Yeah.  #

B.60:  # so, # I feel like the image of the, on the Oilers has really been cleaned
up and,

A.61:  # Yeah.  #

B.62:  # like # last year Warren Moon, and,

A.63:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.64:  # and # so many of the,

A.65:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.66:  # guys # are doing some good things off the field. 

A.67:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.68:  So, it, seems like, though, uh, it seems like all my teams always, you
know, that I, that are local to me wherever I live --

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  -- from when my husband was in college, you know, you just never, on a
given day they could do anything --

A.71:  Right. 

B.72:  -- and then on another day, but, they, the consistency,

A.73:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.74:  # just # when it really gets down to the championship,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # or, # or the really mean, meaningful, uh, game --

A.77:  Uh-huh. 

B.78:  -- they don't come through. 

A.79:  Yeah.  It seems like they blow it. 

B.80:  Course now Dallas did great for many years. 

A.81:  Oh, yeah, you know, it was just like you were so spoiled.  It was such a
novelty if they lost a game, you know, and they could lose one game out of, you
know, the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms --

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  -- and I really, you know, as far as future of the Cowboys I really hate to
say it, but I think they're going to end up being a contender within the next
couple of years, I really feel like that will. 

B.84:  Think so, well, they've been down for a while --

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  -- so it kind of runs in cycles, I think. 

A.87:  Yeah, yeah, and,

B.88:  So you have the teams that stay up on top for several,

A.89:  # Yeah.  #

B.90:  # years # and then they start,

A.91:  Right, I think, and it's a sad thing to say, but I think it really depends
on how much money i-, you know, m-, it always comes back to money.  Everything
does [breathing].  But, if, uh, Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what,
you know, they say they're paying them, I don't know, you know, I think it
depends on, you end up, you know, the best players will come there if they're
going to be paid the most, so, uh, you know, I don't know, it's interesting.
We'll just have to see, but it's just very, very difficult for me to, to
support them.  It's, you know, a lot of the guys I really like, you know, and,
and, uh, I loved Herschel Walker.  That just blew me away when they traded
him.  You talk-, you were talking about somebody that was really involved in
the community and did a lot of things for, for kids and stuff like that.  He
was extremely involved in that, in that aspect.

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  And I think that's why I, I liked him so well.  But, uh, I don't know, you
know, when I, I watch it and then I start sort of seeing myself enjoying it,
I'm like, you're just, you're just doing this for the players, you know, don't
think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson, either one, but, you know, it'd just
be so aggravating when they did win and then, uh, Jerry Jones would come out
of the, uh, you know, the press box.  I mean, I would just go, uh, you know,
wild.  It's like it ruined the whole game for me because I had to look at him,
you know.

B.94:  Is he the owner?

A.95:  Yeah, he's the owner.  Uh-huh, and he and, uh, Jimmy Johnson went to, uh,
college together. 

B.96:  Um {faint}.

A.97:  They played football together in college.  And so they're like, this is
just like the buddy system, you know,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # and # they're, of course they're not from Texas, so that riled everybody
up, you know [laughter],  this is like, Arkansas people. 

B.100:  [Laughter]. 

A.101:  So, uh, that didn't go over well, so, we'll see, as I said, I really think
that they'll eventually, they'll eventually be a contender so,

B.102:  Well, this should be, uh, we did pretty well last year, so I'm thinking
this ought to, this ought to be a good year for us.

A.103:  Yeah, yeah.  It's,

B.104:  Well, h-, have you been involved at all in this new World Football League?
I haven't watched the first thing,

A.105:  No, I haven't.  Uh, you know, I find myself, it's just, it seems like it's
so hard to, uh, I don't know why it is, but it's just so hard for me to get
involved in it,

B.106:  # Well it, #

A.107:  # you know, # I love football --

B.108:  Well, yeah,

A.109:  -- but, you know, I feel like I'm not watching the N F L for some reason,
it's like oh, it really doesn't count, you know. 

B.110:  Doesn't count.  But,

A.111:  And that's terrible, but that's just sort of the way I feel about it. 

B.112:  Well, I tend to, tend to, uh, well, when my son was still at home, uh --

A.113:  Uh-huh. 

B.114:  -- course, he watched everything sports,

A.115:  # Right.  #

B.116:  # and # I was involved, but I tend not to watch things so much now, unless,
uh, if it's my home team --

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  -- or, you know, basically that's it,

A.119:  # Yeah.  #

B.120:  # or # it's, or it's some championship type games,

A.121:  # Yeah.  #

B.122:  # or # something. 

A.123:  Yeah, I mean, you, you see, you can definitely get involved in it more when
it's somebody that you've supported all along, and it's someone local because
you've got all the press, you know.  You read more about them, of course, and,
and hear more about them on, on television and, and such, but, uh, I, you
know, as much as I love it, I would think that I would sit down and watch it,
but it just, as I said, for some reason, it's like oh, they, you know, they're
just out there playing around.  They don't, uh, they don't really, they don't
really count.

B.124:  Who is the quarterback? I don't even know who that, your quarterback is. 

A.125:  Uh, for Dallas?

B.126:  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  Uh, my mind went blank.  I can picture his face.  Oh, my word. 

B.128:  Has he been there couple, three years?

A.129:  Yeah, he's, uh, he's been here for several years.  Oh, pooh.  Oh, well,
it'll come to me as soon as we hang up. 

B.130:  Uh-huh. 

A.131:  I can't, I cannot think of his name.  He's been injured.  They've done,
he's had several surgeries.  He's a young, like a young kid.  I mean, you
know, he's, I don't know if he's even twenty-five yet, I don't think.  But,
uh, he, uh, he's had, as I said, several surgeries on his hand and, and, uh,
he's making a fortune, of course.  He didn't play that much, uh, last season.
He was out for maybe, you know, four or five games so,

B.132:  Well, Warren Moon broke his, I think his, was it his little finger, or his
thumb,

A.133:  # Yeah.  #

B.134:  # I # forget,

A.135:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.136:  # toward # the last couple of games of the season, so he was out --

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  -- for the, you know, the last part,

A.139:  # Yeah.  #

B.140:  # so.  # Course he's not real young, either.  He's --

A.141:  That's true.  He is. 

B.142:  -- in his,

A.143:  He's considered an old timer, I suppose. 

B.144:  He's probably in his early thirties I would think,

A.145:  # Yeah.  #

B.146:  # at # least, uh,

A.147:  Yeah. 

B.148:  You know, if we don't do something with him at the helm, you know --

A.149:  Yeah. 

B.150:  -- then it may be downhill then,

A.151:  # Yeah.  #

B.152:  # for # us for a while. 

A.153:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it takes a, it takes a strong leader in that
position. 

B.154:  Because we had the guy the, I forget the guy's name, the one who came in
for him --

A.155:  Uh-huh. 

B.156:  -- and played in one game, you know, we made some playoffs or something
toward the end,

A.157:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.158:  # it # seems like, and this guy came in and we won, I mean the guy played
beautifully and then,

A.159:  # Yeah.  #

B.160:  # then # the next week, which was a really important game --

A.161:  Uh-huh. 

B.162:  -- it didn't, he, it just fell apart. 

A.163:  Yeah. 

B.164:  Didn't work. 

A.165:  Yeah. 

B.166:  But it, but you talk about exciting --

A.167:  Oh, yeah. 

B.168:  -- when something, you know, we were just,

A.169:  Just so thrilled, it's true. 

B.170:  Right, right when the, seem like right before the Christmas holidays or
somewhere, seem like,

A.171:  Yeah. 

B.172:  My mom, was there from, uh, they're from Alabama,

A.173:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.174:  # and # my mom has never watched football hardly in her life,

A.175:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.176:  # and # she sat there with me,

A.177:  # [Laughter].  #

B.178:  # and # I was explaining some of it to her --

A.179:  Uh-huh. 

B.180:  -- and she was getting really excited,

A.181:  # Really getting into it, uh-huh.  #

B.182:  # and that was so neat, # yeah. 

A.183:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, it's addictive.  I mean I come from a, my, I have
several coaches in my family and --

B.184:  Oh. 

A.185:  -- you know, my mom is just a freak about it.  You know, she, she's just as
bad as anybody,

B.186:  # [Breathing]  ((Right)). #

A.187:  # and my # fiancee, if it's involved with ball, he will watch it, you know.

B.188:  Oh. 

A.189:  So I w-, I was raised with all that stuff.  So, you know, it's just like
all of our holidays center on what time is the game start, [laughter] you
know.

B.190:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.191:  We have to hurry up and get all this food out of the way because,

B.192:  That's kind of, kind of the way, way we've been, too. 

A.193:  Yeah. 

B.194:  But it's, it is fun. 

A.195:  Oh, yeah. 

B.196:  I really enjoy it. 

A.197:  Yeah, you know, I would like to, I, I say I h-, I didn't want the Cowboys
to win, but sure I'd like to seem them, you know, end up, end up doing better.
It's just, you know, you, you really miss it when you aren't so intense, you
know, as, as we were when they were such a great team, you know.

B.198:  Yeah, you kind of, I don't know, you know, when they're not doing well or
they consistently do poorly --

A.199:  Yeah. 

B.200:  -- just kind of, kind of lose interest if you don't --

A.201:  Yeah, you know, it's like, wh-,

B.202:  -- which is a shame, but that's, uh,

A.203:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.204:  # way # people are. 

A.205:  Uh-huh.  It's like, why am I even watching this.  You know, I, it was seems
like it was the height of the, of the, uh, Cowboys empire, so to speak, when,
uh, uh, Earl Campbell was playing for the Oilers --

B.206:  Uh-huh. 

A.207:  -- and I'm a U T freak, too. 

B.208:  Uh-huh. 

A.209:  I mean I'm a University of Texas fan so, I followed Earl Campbell over to
the Oilers and, and, uh, you know, I kept up with that as well and, and I was,
I was just crazy about him, so, I,
