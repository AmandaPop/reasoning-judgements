===========================================================================

A.1:  Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the --

B.2:  Sure, uh,

A.3:  -- okay. 

B.4:  I'll offer anything that I can on the subject.  Uh, my husband and I just
bought a, just moved here recently and, uh, we bought, uh, this house about,
uh, I don't know, year and a half ago.  What we have here now is just a basic
three bedroom, two bath, brick house which is, uh, completely different from
what I had had before.  When I was working and before I married, uh, I lived
in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and, uh,
historic old houses and things like that so I, uh, tried to, I was in the
process of renovating a house and, uh, that was about seventy-five years old.

A.5:  Oh, my. 

B.6:  So, uh, it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it
leveled, jacked up, uh, new plumbing, new wiring, wallpaper, paint, everything
you can think of,

A.7:  # You, #

B.8:  # that # house had to have [laughter]. 

A.9:  You are experienced I would say. 

B.10:  Well, I, I really did enjoy it, uh, you know, it was amazing what I found
out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it. 

A.11:  Well, I agree. 

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  I have done something, uh, like that, too, only not nearly as extensive. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch,

B.16:  # It is.  #

A.17:  # style home.  #

B.18:  It is. 

A.19:  Uh,

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # after # having a one that was historical looking. 

B.22:  That's, that's true.  When, uh, I met my husband, he was living in an
apartment at the time and, and, uh, the town that I was living in only about
eighty miles from here.  So, uh, you know, I, we, really it was just the market
was so good, we hadn't really planned on buying and, as you probably heard from
the, in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal.  I
mean you can get things for such a song. 

A.23:  Yes. 

B.24:  So, that's, that's really why we ended up in a house like this.  This is
not what we, you know, what we want to stay in forever, because I have to have
my, I've found that after doing this other house, I have to have my hands into
stuff and,

A.25:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.26:  # you # know, I'm always just wanting to paint and, and wallpaper and redo
and redo, so, uh, you know, I, I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can
have a little more input into [laughter]  so,

A.27:  Well, maybe you can, uh, make that one charming and, and make a little bit
money, uh,

B.28:  Yeah.  That's, that's the key, you know, the thing is, uh, when we moved in
they had just, uh, painted, wallpa-, we're, you know, wallpapered, new carpet
and everything so I feel sort of, uh, you know, like it's sort of defeating my
purpose to go rip everything out now [laughter] and do it over just because
I'm in the mood to do it.  So, uh, we'll see,

A.29:  # Yes.  #

B.30:  # we'll # see how much longer we're here. 

A.31:  Well, we just moved to Charlotte,

B.32:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.33:  # from # Enid, Oklahoma. 

B.34:  Oh, Oklahoma of all places. 

A.35:  So I know,

B.36:  # Yeah.  #

A.37:  # of # what you're talking about,

B.38:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.39:  # as # far as the market was concerned --

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  -- and I'll tell you, uh, we, we had kind of a charming house.  It was a
cedar shake house,

B.42:  # Oh, yes.  #

A.43:  # and very # weathered.  And, uh,

B.44:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.45:  # it # was about fifty years old,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # but # not tra-, not really, uh, traditional looking,

B.48:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

A.49:  # particularly.  #

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  And, uh, so I tried to make it, after I sold my business I, in, in, I spent
almost three years redoing. 

B.52:  Oh, yeah. 

A.53:  And I considered it a full time job --

B.54:  Oh, it is, yeah. 

A.55:  -- and when we did, uh, we kind of had planned this, uh, trek to the east,

B.56:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # because we're # both originally from this part of the country. 

B.58:  I see, uh-huh. 

A.59:  And so, I think some of the things that I did paid off.  For instance,

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # one # thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you --

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  -- uh, was something I did on the outside.  I love old estate, estate
sales. 

B.64:  Yes, yes. 

A.65:  I happened to go to just a little estate sale that,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # just # a little white frame house,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # where # the couple, uh, was very old,

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # and # had gone into nursing homes and --

B.72:  Oh, yeah. 

A.73:  -- uh, all the men started going down to the barn. 

B.74:  Uh, oh [laughter]. 

A.75:  And so I, th-, well shoot I'm going,

B.76:  That's where I need to go [laughter]. 

A.77:  Yes, I'm going to the barn, too. 

B.78:  Exactly. 

A.79:  They, uh, auctioned some tools and,

B.80:  # Yeah.  #

A.81:  # things # like that,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # but # then they went over and started, uh, auctioning this big stack of
bricks. 

B.84:  [Breathing]  Oh. 

A.85:  And, so, well, I thought, gee, I've been wanting to,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # do # some brick, uh, walkways --

B.88:  Work, right, right. 

A.89:  -- for a time. 

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  Anyway, it ended up after some pretty, uh, heavy bidding,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # that # I got all those bricks for forty dollars. 

B.94:  Oh, my word. 

A.95:  And, so my husband and I loaded bricks in his,

B.96:  # [Laughter]  Oh, no.  #

A.97:  # pickup truck for # days. 

B.98:  Oh, my word. 

A.99:  But, what we ended up with was about four thousand. 

B.100:  [Breathing]  For forty dollars?

A.101:  For forty dollars. 

B.102:  Oh, my. 

A.103:  And so what we did, we had built a deck on the back of that house,

B.104:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.105:  # but # it needed and,

B.106:  # Something.  #

A.107:  # it # was quite large out to,

B.108:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.109:  # into # the yard but,

B.110:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.111:  # on # either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all
tied together.  So we,

B.112:  # Right.  #

A.113:  # made # brick patios, # and walkways.  #

B.114:  # Oh, how # fun.  Oh, how nice.

A.115:  And so for, and he, he did the digging,

B.116:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.117:  # which # was about six inches, but I figured the sand and all,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # had # that delivered and,

B.120:  # Right.  #

A.121:  # leveled # it and, and,

B.122:  # Right.  #

A.123:  # placed # most all the bricks. 

B.124:  Uh-huh. 

A.125:  And it turned out beautifully. 

B.126:  Oh, I bet.  And what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an
inexpensive way [laughter].

A.127:  Yes.  Well, it nearly killed me [laughter]. 

B.128:  Yeah, but, but you did stag-, stagger back and say, oh, doesn't this look
nice. 

A.129:  I hated to leave it. 

B.130:  Well, let me ask you, when you laid those bricks, I know my parents bought
a house about ten years ago, they're fixing to sell it again, but, and move
again.  They're kind of, my mom's like I am.  She's a renovator, a lover of
old things --

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  -- and, you know, they have to be doing something constantly.  And the
patio that came with that house, uh, was not laid on a, like, I don't know if
you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un-, on, on top of
the sand and then lay the bricks.

A.133:  No we,

B.134:  But they have, they have a problem with these little tin-, like sand bugs
or something --

A.135:  Well, I,

B.136:  -- that drill in between all these bricks.  And, of course you know you
have the, uh, the weeds that come up in between the bricks or, and things like
that.

A.137:  Well, no, I, I didn't have that trouble because, uh, we laid the, I did get
some material [throat_clearing]  --

B.138:  Uh-huh. 

A.139:  -- and studied every bit of material that I could study, but --

B.140:  Yeah. 

A.141:  -- we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them,

B.142:  # I see.  #

A.143:  # because when # you start and we put them on a base of four inches of s-,
sand --

B.144:  Okay, yeah. 

A.145:  -- and then we, uh, we swept sand in between, but --

B.146:  Uh-huh. 

A.147:  -- but it was an error to, to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever. 
You just put them together as close as you can. 

B.148:  As tight as you can.  That's probably, because they had, you know every
spring my mom says we're going to have a par-, a barbecue and tell everybody,
guess what, we're going to, we're going to redo the patio, you know, we're
going to pull up all the bricks,

A.149:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.150:  # but, # uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it. 

A.151:  Yeah, well,

B.152:  # So, #

A.153:  # and # I also used a rubber hammer, a lot,

B.154:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.155:  # to, # uh,

B.156:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.157:  # you # know, if it wasn't quite level or something, I'd just get that,

B.158:  # Right.  #

A.159:  # rubber # hammer and, uh, and, and prob-, you know, I think that they
could, if they have problems with, uh, sand bugs of some kind --

B.160:  Uh-huh. 

A.161:  -- I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in
there --

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  -- on a, oh, a fairly regular basis,

B.164:  # Right.  #

A.165:  # for # a while anyway. 

B.166:  Right, well the thing that's funny is they've done, uh, they've done things
like that, you know, I'll catch her out there spraying around, and then it's
like, in two days time they'll come home from work and those little things are
back.  It's just, they're the most resilient little characters and so, I don't
know what they're finally going to do.  She may just, hopefully they'll sell
the house,

A.167:  # [Laughter].  #

B.168:  # and # go somewhere else [laughter]. 

A.169:  Well, I think,

B.170:  And then she won't have to worry about it. 

A.171:  I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they
are and,

B.172:  # [Laughter]  What are these things? #

A.173:  # yeah, is it ((diazinon)) or # what is it that will, uh,

B.174:  Right. 

A.175:  ((Dursban)) or something like that. 

B.176:  Yeah, what it, what it is that'll, that'll,

A.177:  # ((Dursban)), #

B.178:  # take # care of them. 

A.179:  I think in this area or most all areas they use, you know,

B.180:  # Yeah.  #

A.181:  # for # ticks and fleas.  And you know, they're,

B.182:  # Right.  #

A.183:  # awful # hard to do anything with. 

B.184:  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  But my, my dad farms and, you know, she's
always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring home with
you that kills everything that you spray, you know, out in the, out in the
field, that you can get rid of,

A.185:  # Yeah.  #

B.186:  # these # bugs, but, uh,

A.187:  I bet ((Dursban)) would do it. 

B.188:  It might, it might do it, yeah.  She's got so many flow-, she's got just a
gorgeous yard, so many, uh, flowers and her, her four cats, you know, so she's
sort of, uh, real funny about what she sprays. 

A.189:  Yeah.  I think, uh, you probably just need to make sure that it dries,

B.190:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.191:  # very, # very careful-, uh, well,

B.192:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.193:  # before # she lets her cats out, or something,

B.194:  # Yeah.  #

A.195:  # like # that. 

B.196:  Yeah. 

A.197:  Well, gosh, Deb, we could talk all day couldn't we [laughter]. 

B.198:  I know, I, I was just, you know, it just seems like I, as I said when I
heard the, what the subject was, I thought oh, gosh I haven't thought about,
uh, what I went through at that other house in so long.  I've been so busy.
But, uh, I don't know of everything that I did, I guess I enjoyed probably
wallpapering the most and I thought that would be the hardest thing to do.

A.199:  Yes. 

B.200:  But, uh, gosh, you know, I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that
house, uh, up the stairway,

A.201:  # Wow.  #

B.202:  # even.  # You know, I just had a ball with it,

A.203:  # Oh.  #

B.204:  # it # was so much fun. 

A.205:  Oh, good. 

B.206:  Yeah.  And I've sworn up and down, my mom's, uh, my mom's great
grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris, Texas, and the one thing
that she ended up with is, was the old door,

A.207:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.208:  # that # was, that was on the front door of that house --

A.209:  Yes. 

B.210:  -- and she has that up in her attic and I have sworn that it, I'm going to
find a house to put that door on before she does [laughter]. 

A.211:  [Laughter]. 

B.212:  So, as far as looking toward the future, you know, that's my plan.  I'm
going to have to move fast,

A.213:  # [Laughter].  #

B.214:  # I # think, though, because, uh, you know, as a,
