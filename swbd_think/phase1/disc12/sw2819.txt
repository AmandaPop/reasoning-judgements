=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so, um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten
to twenty years?

B.2:  Uh, I'm at a little bit of a loss, you know, I don't know, ten years ago,
see I'm what, I'm about, uh, twenty-eight now so --

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  -- when I was eighteen, things haven't changed a whole lot. 

A.5:  Really. 

B.6:  People are being a little more, oh, I don't know, a little le-, a little
less bigoted in some ways, I don't know --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- seems to me. 

A.9:  Well,

B.10:  I guess I'm like my parents.  The younger generation gets away with hell,
but, uh,

A.11:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

B.12:  Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may
just be because I've changed.  You know, I used to live up north.  Down here,
Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant --

A.13:  Really. 

B.14:  -- but, uh,

A.15:  Where'd you live up, where'd you live at,

B.16:  I lived in Akron, Ohio. 

A.17:  Oh, did you? I'm from (( )), Illinois, so. 

B.18:  Oh. 

A.19:  How long, how long you been in Dallas?

B.20:  Oh, about eight years. 

A.21:  Oh, really?

B.22:  In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and
more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. 

A.23:  Yeah, uh --

B.24:  I think,

A.25:  -- you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's
definitely a tough job to do. 

B.26:  Yeah, I think it's, crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last --

A.27:  Oh, yeah, I agree. 

B.28:  -- last ten, fifteen years, and maybe that has a lot to do with it. 

A.29:  Yeah, I, I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse, and you know, I, I
think there's, to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family
values. 

B.30:  Yeah, that's true. 

A.31:  So,

B.32:  That's true,

A.33:  But, uh,

B.34:  I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved --

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  -- but that's more a matter of, you know --

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  -- I'm no longer a teenager in high school. 

A.39:  Yeah, I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work, and
things like that than there used to be and,

B.40:  Hello.  Somebody's at the door. 

A.41:  So. 

B.42:  Hang on just a second. 

A.43:  Okay. 

B.44:  [Noise]  {talking off phone}. Okay. 

A.45:  But, uh, I don't know, that's just, that's one thing I see, I see a lot
more, you know, double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising
the kids and things like that, I guess. 

B.46:  Yeah, that's true, it's getting more and more expensive to live. 

A.47:  Yeah, that's for sure. 

B.48:  You can't, you can't make it,

A.49:  Yeah, without it hardly, that's right. 

B.50:  I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a,
get a home and buy house, (( )) and these days you see a lot of people living
in apartments --

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  -- forever --

A.53:  Yeah --

B.54:  -- you know, you just don't buy a house,

A.55:  -- just because they can't get into one, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, the
ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until
you can get into a house --

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  -- in a lot of ways, so.  Yeah, that's, that's a good point so, I'm trying
to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. 

B.58:  Yeah, for me it's kind of hard, I don't know.  I think, I don't know, I
think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding --

A.59:  Oh, yeah, I agree. 

B.60:  -- and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around.

A.61:  Well, I hope so, you know, at some point but I don't know at what point,

B.62:  But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, uh --

A.63:  Yeah,

B.64:  -- so, usually is --

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  -- I think. 

A.67:  It's, uh,

B.68:  It's hard for me to say.  I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those
that gets caught.  But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs
to be, be changed. 

@@A.69:  Yeah, that's right.  Do you work at T I?

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  Do you?

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  What, uh, department do you work in?

B.74:  I'm in semiconductor. 

A.75:  Are you? I'm in semiconductor division too. 

B.76:  Yeah. 

A.77:  So.  How long you been with them, since you moved down here?

B.78:  About eight years, yeah. 

A.79:  Um, I'm over at the Center One building. 

B.80:  Yeah, so am I. 

A.81:  Are you really.  What floor?

B.82:  Two. 

A.83:  I'm on the seventh floor. 

B.84:  Well,

A.85:  How about that.  Well, it's a small world.  So, so let's see, second floor,
you work with, uh, linear. 

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  Do you.  Do you, uh, do you know Alec Morton?

B.88:  Yeah, I've probably seen him around. 

A.89:  Oh, you do, huh.  Well, he comes up and pushes us around so, uh, so I'm
pretty familiar with,

B.90:  Are you D A D or something up there?

A.91:  Huh?

B.92:  Are you D A D or something?

A.93:  Yeah [laughter].  Yep, you must know him.  His reputation precedes him. 

B.94:  Yeah, well, seventh floor. 

A.95:  Yeah,

B.96:  T A D,

A.97:  Well, uh, he, uh, boy, he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. 
They, they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief, so I
can believe it but,

B.98:  Well. 

A.99:  Yeah, let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about
how long, I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess.  Um, been with T I
like twelve, but I started out in Lubbock. 

B.100:  (( )).

A.101:  Lubbock is, I don't know, I guess if this is the only place you've lived,
Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. 

B.102:  Yeah, flat, dry --

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  -- and dirty,

A.105:  Yeah, but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too, I mean, here
in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush. 

B.106:  Yeah, I lived in the country for several years, and living in the city is a
whole different --

A.107:  Oh yeah. 

B.108:  -- uh, social structure but, uh,

A.109:  Well, I got some friends that, uh, seems like he went to school at like
DeVry.  Is there a DeVry in Akron?

B.110:  I don't even know --

A.111:  Oh,

B.112:  -- I haven't been up there in years. 

A.113:  Oh, I see, well, he went to school somewhere in Ohio, and he's from that
area, and, uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think but,
uh, I haven't talked to him in a while, but, um, yeah, he, he misses it.  He
used to go back twice or three times a year, you know, because he missed it. 
Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. 

B.114:  No, I haven't been back in fi-, ten, fifteen years. 

A.115:  You still have relatives back there or,

B.116:  Yeah, I do, I just haven't had a chance to get back [laughter]. 

A.117:  Oh. 

B.118:  Catch them next year probably. 

A.119:  Really.  Well, let's see, how, how long are we supposed to talk here? 

B.120:  I don't know, I think we ran out of social,

A.121:  [Laughter]. 

B.122:  social changes to talk about, so. 

A.123:  Yeah, well my kids are probably needing me to go so --

B.124:  Okay,

A.125:  -- all right, well, it's nice talking to you. 

B.126:  Yeah,

A.127:  Talk to you later. 

B.128:  All righty, bye. 

A.129:  Bye.
