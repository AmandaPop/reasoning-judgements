REMARKS:        There was a lot of stuttering and change of thoughts in 
the middle of a sentence.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, there's one, [laughter]  uh, I meant living in Texas, where you at?

B.2:  I'm in Rome, New York. 

A.3:  In where ((Rome)), New York?

B.4:  Rome, New York, yeah. 

A.5:  Rome, New York, okay, well, Texas, [squeak]  let me look at my husband and
ask him, {speaks to some one else in room} Yes, they do [laughter].  He's
reminding me of where I live, # yeah.  #

B.6:  # Yeah, # I, I, New York does not --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- but, uh, they're, they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's
opposed to it being that, uh, the Democrat that he is,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # and # Mario Cuomo --

A.11:  Yes. 

B.12:  -- but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it. 

A.13:  Yeah, I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea but, or I should say morally I
don't like the idea, but, uh, social eth-, eth-, and ethics, socially and
ethically I think it's a good idea, #in certain crimes.  #

B.14: # I'd, I would # agree, with that almo-, even more, I don't know if
this is cold and too pragmatically but I'm really offended,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.16:  # by # the thought that I have to support,

A.17:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.18:  # uh, # just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist, whatev-, wh-,

A.19:  # Right, any (( )),#

B.20:  # you know, #

A.21:  on the street, no, I know. 

B.22:  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested
children, and kill,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # them # whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, ((upwards)), uh, thirty
thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them. 

A.25:  Yeah, and Texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the,
the (( )) cri-, I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders
is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board
is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from calli-, from
killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, mo-, molestations
to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things and they're get,
these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even
suppose to be considered,

B.26:  # Right.  #

A.27:  # and # now, they can't find them and they're finding bodies in di-, you
know, I mean, you thi-, think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's
over crowded, and you think how is, is everybody that stupid or is the world
really that rotten [laughter]. 

B.28:  I, I don't know,

A.29:  # I know.  #

B.30:  # it's a # hard question, you look at the United States, we have the
largest murder rate of any developed, uh,

A.31:  # And then, #

B.32:  # or, uh, #

A.33:  I don't know how ((Americans are about)) handguns but, uh, yesterday a
lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in
Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to
accept the bill to access, to access handguns and they passed it, which
basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over
twenty-one can get a gun [laughter]. 

B.34:  Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh --

A.35:  Is it, that's good. 

B.36:  -- it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, #
in this state.  #

A.37: # Say, that good, # I think that's, like the state of Virginia,
yeah, that's great.

B.38:  Now, the, the, and that's with, uh, you have to have, uh, oh, a police
investigation, you have to,

A.39:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.40:  # have # references, and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one
and listed me as a reference --

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  -- uh, and I know it, there is, it's very easy to get, uh, uh, you know,
there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things
like that,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # which # aren't the, I, I don't consider to be the kind of cri-, crime,
uh,

A.45:  # Right, they're no, #

B.46:  # weapon, you know, #

A.47:  the ((cattiness)) behind, right, yeah,

B.48:  uh, so,

A.49:  I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about, uh, this topic
like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was
in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members
probably would have killed him but in Florida, in the state of Washington when
they had the Ted Bundy case --

B.50:  Right. 

A.51:  -- and how they just exe-, well, it hasn't been just but it was in the, I
think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety --

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  -- and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad, you
di-, you know, this is nothing, and I said just maybe because he got a lot of
media hype and all that but I actually, I mean [clinking] {ice in glass} there
should be more cases like that where they flip a sw-, I might be too cold too,
but they flip a switch,

B.54:  # Yeah, yeah, #

A.55:  # I don't # know,

B.56:  well,

A.57:  I mean,

B.58:  a-, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped and then --

A.59:  So many times. 

B.60:  -- yeah --

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  -- and did it again and, uh,

A.63:  Yeah, I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, th-, they
said celebrated that, uh, he's not the only one,

B.64:  # No.  #

A.65:  # you # know, you, you see somebody's mini series and you hear about
somebody's crime, there was something on, and this gets back to capital
punishment, but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some
wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the
facts that they said it was true --

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  -- and they buried her alive --

B.68:  Oh, God. 

A.69:  -- and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man, and, and at the
end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this
set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh, [laughter]
that's nice.

B.70:  Great. 

A.71:  I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a
deterrence but it does serve as a pun-, uh, definite,

B.72:  # Surely, #

A.73:  # pun-, # you know,

B.74:  there's and end to,

A.75:  lasting punish-,

B.76:  the situation. 

A.77:  Right, in that particular instance, uh, but I, but I don't, but I know it's
on a and all and be all,

B.78:  # Right.  #

A.79:  # that's # the problem I have with it, in Texas they think it's and all and
be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas
somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and
we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # ridden, # and we just moved here, uh, we've been here before, lived in
Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate, and then
we were transferred back here, and when you're gone from some place like it for
about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic
just living is,

B.82:  # Right.  #

A.83:  # even # suburban, no matter where you are, and how, you're in,

B.84:  # Rome, New York, #

A.85:  # Rome, New York, #

B.86:  it's up state it --

A.87:  is that and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,

B.88:  -- it's, uh, near Syracuse it's about, uh, well, I, I actually live in a
Village of Sylvan Beach, I work in Rome, uh,

A.89:  What, what type of area is that,

B.90:  # It's more rural, #

A.91:  # is that in # term,

B.92:  uh, it use to be --

A.93:  Uh-huh. 

B.94:  -- use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,

A.95:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.96:  # but # it's kind of, uh, all the industry has gone south,

A.97:  # Sure.  #

B.98:  # and, # uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area
and, uh, uh,

A.99:  # How would, #

B.100:  # so it's, #

A.101:  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,

B.102:  # Not too bad, #

A.103:  # and things that # would,

B.104:  it, you know,

A.105:  not too bad. 

B.106:  you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,

A.107:  # Yeah.  #

B.108:  # uh, # small city type problems,

A.109:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # but # I don't know that there's a real, uh,

A.111:  # Not the harsh criminality, #

B.112:  # no there isn't the # harsh crime and all. 

A.113:  that you find in, yeah, now, Dallas is a [laughter] I'm being very
sarcastic, it's just a great,

B.114:  # [Laughter].  #

A.115:  # uh, # on some days, uh, [laughter]  it's, uh, I don't know the good ole
boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said they believe that, if they
kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,

B.116:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.117:  # deed # for deed that,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # that # does something, uh, but yet they want spend the money to build the
new jails that, I mean, they really are over,

B.120:  # Right.  #

A.121:  # crowded, # I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh, and I just, you
know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New
York these days, I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital
punishment there.

B.122:  I think, I think Penn-, Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because I'm
from, uh,

A.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.124:  # from # Pennsylvania also, just, uh, just outside,

A.125:  # (( )), #

B.126:  # of Philadelphia, #

A.127:  Yeah, and I'm from Pittsburgh so,

B.128:  # Yeah.  #

A.129:  # oh, # well, we'll forgive each other [laughter]. 

B.130:  [Laughter]. 

A.131:  Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up I
and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,

B.132:  # Right.  #

A.133:  # years # but, uh,

B.134:  The west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got
all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so. 

A.135:  There you go [laughter].  I don't know that's a different top-, subject,

B.136:  # Right.  #

A.137:  # altogether # but, uh, I don't know I think everybody would feel it is
same way if they were touched by crime.  I think everyone would, ((you and I
think are)) honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,

B.138:  # Right.  #

A.139:  # vehicle, # uh, but I think everybody if they were touched by it would
say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,

B.140:  # Sure.  #

A.141:  # I # think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah, do it if somebody
in my family or if it happened it me, you know,

B.142:  # Yeah, #

A.143:  # uh, #

B.144:  if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them I think everyone
would, I, they'd,

A.145:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.146:  # probably # pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and
with a smile on their face,

A.147:  # Yeah, I just, #

B.148:  # as they did # it. 

A.149:  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate, I mean I just don't, uh, oh, I
did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, and I
just, the subject, I remember we drew things out of a hat and it was
something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the
punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check,
check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape,
rapist getting their hand,

B.150:  # Yeah.  #

A.151:  # just # slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the
time of day that the court is in session,

B.152:  # Right.  #

A.153:  # you # know, all these, uh, i-, i-, intangible things and you're thinking,
[laughter] oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim you
wouldn't want to be a criminal [laughter] either --

B.154:  Right. 

A.155:  -- because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh --

B.156:  Right. 

A.157:  -- but, I don't know, methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on
that either I just [laughter], 

B.158:  Well, uh, I, uh, yeah, I don't know I think the old gas chamber seems to be
about the most painless because I guess it's a pretty,

A.159:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.160:  # pretty # rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted. 

A.161:  Is it, uh, how about the injection,

B.162:  # Oh, yeah, an injection, #

A.163:  # is that suppose to # be. 

B.164:  yeah, that would be even, yeah, I didn't even,

A.165:  Yeah. 

B.166:  think about that. 

A.167:  I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, do you know which
way it is the ratio, it's more than, aren't, uh, tha-, it's more that don't
have it,

B.168:  # I think, #

A.169:  # isn't that # correct. 

B.170:  yeah, there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like, uh,
Massachusetts went back,

A.171:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.172:  # and # reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,

A.173:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.174:  # I # don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it
but, uh, it's on the books. 

A.175:  Yeah, ((I don't know if they've, they did something about)) I'm not sure if
Texas, Minnesota, I, they didn't, they didn't, they were again-, well, did
they have it, they were against it, uh, Texas, as I said, has it but I haven't
been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,

B.176:  # Right.  #

A.177:  # if # they've done it in the last,
