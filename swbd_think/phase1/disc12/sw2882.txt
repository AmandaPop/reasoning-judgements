=========================================================================

A.1:  Here we go. 

B.2:  Okay, where are you from?

A.3:  I'm from, uh, Attleboro, Massachusetts. 

B.4:  Oh, is that where you're talking from?

A.5:  Yes. 

B.6:  Oh, w-, I can tell from your accent. 

A.7:  Ho-, how about you?

B.8:  I'm from Louisville, Kentucky, but I'm here in Texas. 

A.9:  Oh, you're down there in Texas?

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  Oh, okay, um, so we're supposed to be talking about why only half the
people vote in national elections.

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  Um. 

B.14:  Do you vote regular?

A.15:  I vote regularly, yes I do. 

B.16:  Okay. 

A.17:  In the national elections, um, some of the local, um, I don't tend to. 
Unless there's a referendums.  Something that's going to affect the town. 

B.18:  Uh-huh, well I,

A.19:  Uh, then I, uh, [throat_clearing]  then I put my two cents in. 

B.20:  Uh, I need to get into voting, I've never voted. 

A.21:  You never ever voted?

B.22:  No, I've never voted, I've never felt comfortable enough with it.  I don't
know enough about politics to know what the right choice is anyway. 

A.23:  As far as, uh, tha-,

B.24:  Even local candidates, it just, [child]  I talked about this the other day
on the telephone, with, it's, uh, so many politicians, you know, they put up a
front, to me, you know, they're not showing you the real person anyway, they're
just sho-, showing what the public wants to see. 

A.25:  Uh, that's true, unless yo-, unless you come from, I co-, I come from a
fairly small town. 

B.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.27:  # So, # I, I live in Rhode Island but I work in Massachusetts, um, and it's
fairly small and you, and most of the people you tend to know at least the
family, or, you know, uh. 

B.28:  Well that would be nice, yeah [clink]. 

A.29:  It's, uh, it's getting away from that now, I mean the town's growing bigger
as, as all towns are.  And, you're right, they're, uh, uh, I think, uh, m-,
most politicians when they first get into politics, they want to do a good
job.  And then after they're, they're in there a while, you have to play the
good old boy network.

B.30:  Right. 

A.31:  And, it's, uh, uh, um, they have their own special interests and, watch out
for the people that are going to do the most for them too, to get them
reelected, I think. 

B.32:  Right, well that's what I mean, it's jus-, you don't know, {pause} what's
real, I guess. 

A.33:  Yeah.  How about, uh, bond issues, or referendum that they, they put on. 
You don't [squeak]  {could be a door in background},

B.34:  I don't know much about that at all.  What do you mean, like when you vote
for a certain thing not a person [talking]? 

A.35:  Right, yeah, whether they, they want to build a new school, whether they
want to put in a new reservoir, or, or,

B.36:  I don't think, no, I've never voted on anything like that either
[throat_clearing].

A.37:  Um, but yet they're taking your tax money, or they would if, if some of
these bond issues passed. 

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  Um, you still didn't have any feelings one way or the other about whether
they, they should do it, or shouldn't. 

B.40:  Well see, I've never, uh, how do you do the, do you do that like you're
voting, just like if you're taking, a, a presidential election.  Do you just
go somewhere and place your ballot or,

A.41:  Yes, yes. 

B.42:  Huh, well, see I've never heard of th-, well I know that sounds stupid but
I really haven't.  I've never heard of that.

A.43:  Um, how, how long have you lived in, in, where are you now, t-, in Dallas?

B.44:  I'm no, I'm in Denison, Texas, up north,

A.45:  # Oh.  #

B.46:  # in, # on, in the north part of Texas. 

A.47:  Okay, but you haven't lived yo-, your whole life if you came from Kentucky,
did you say. 

B.48:  Right, I moved from Kentucky when I was twenty-one. 

A.49:  Oh, okay, but you grew up in that town, or,

B.50:  Right, I grew up in Louisville. 

A.51:  Well, Louisville, okay, that's, um, but that's, uh, and Louisville's a, a
large city, so. 

B.52:  Yeah, it's a fairly big city. 

A.53:  Yeah, you didn't have local, real local politics, like, you know, like a
small town would.  How about where you are now, is that a fa-, fairly large?

B.54:  Denison, it's, uh, I wouldn't say it's large but it is one of the bigger
cities in this part of Texas. 

A.55:  Yeah, so you're in the same boat there. 

B.56:  Right, it's about the same. 

A.57:  And you don't really know who's, who are what's going on or,

B.58:  No. 

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  I remember once when I was a working in Louisville, one of the mayor
candidates come up to the, uh, uh, place where I was working and he had asked
me, I don't know, I guess it had been about two years since I'd been eligible
to vote, and I haven't, hadn't been voting.  Well he had, uh, this is one of
the things that, you know, formed my opinion on poli-, politicians, he sat
there and promised, you know, the next day we're going to take you up and get
you registered to vote and you're going to vote for me and blah, blah, blah,
but then he never showed up.

A.61:  Huh. 

B.62:  You know. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  It was one of his aides or whatever, but still I thought, you know, they
say what they want to for the time being, what sounds good.

A.65:  Just, just so they can get in, that's all. 

B.66:  # Yeah.  #

A.67:  # And # it's, uh, they probably should limit the, the terms of office to no
more than two years, I mean two terms.  That way they don't get in there,
because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years, and they,
they kind of run things the way they want to run them, whether, whether it's,
uh, for the good of the, the town, or the people in the town, or not. 

B.68:  Uh-huh.  Well that's, I think they need to have a, a better, oh, I need to
know a lot more about politics and they need to have something in the
community, well like in high school they should teach politics or the
government.  I mean, I think so.

A.69:  Yeah, um, some of them do now.  Um, s-, social sciences and, I'm not sure
how far they get into politics and that, uh. 

B.70:  Uh-huh.  Well I want to know about politics in particular.  You know, just,
you know, what the workings of it is. 

A.71:  Oh, the, uh, like, uh, uh, parliamentary procedure, and, and that sort of
thing. 

B.72:  Everything, right.  In order for me to be able to form a, a good opinion on
who to vote for, or whatever.  I, I need to know about it. 

A.73:  Yeah. 

B.74:  You know,

A.75:  # Uh.  #

B.76:  # and # if I could keep a follow-up on the candidates running.  Like right
now, you know, I know whose president, vice president and I know a couple of
the mayors, like Koch, in New York, I don't even know who's mayor down here in
Texas --

A.77:  Yeah. 

B.78:  -- # off hand.  #

A.79:  # Yeah, um, I # don't, i-, it's they've got, they've got rules and
regulations they have to follow for, for government procedures, but,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # there's # too many special interest groups now, that are in there that,
that can sway an election, one way or another.  Um, I don't even think running,
to, the running of the government now is done by the, the president they say,
you know, he's, I think he's only really a figurehead.  He only can do certain
amount of things,

B.82:  # So much.  #

A.83:  # because he's # got so many people after him, you know, an he's, he's got
to look (( )).

B.84:  Well what do you think abo-, I think jus-, you know, anybody should be
allowed to run for president, just even an ordinary guy off the street, if he
knows the politics. 

A.85:  Well you can, except it costs so much money now that the average person
can't do that. 

B.86:  Right, it's, it's that's what I mean, it's all money and,

A.87:  Um, plus, they're all, yo-, you have to play the people that have been in
power now, [talking]  uh, most of them are, I think are, are crooks. 

B.88:  # Yeah.  #

A.89:  # And # you have to play their ball game. 

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # They've # been in there so long, and if you don't then they'll, you know,
they'll find ways to get rid of you.  No one's held accountable anymore for
things that happen or,

B.92:  What did you think of that whole mess with Ollie North and all that?

A.93:  Oh, I think that, they should have crucified him.  That's what I think. 

B.94:  Uh, Reagan and Bush and,

A.95:  Reagan too, Reagan, he knew about it. 

B.96:  Oh, of course he did. 

A.97:  And if he didn't know the whole scope of it, whoever,

B.98:  # He should have looked into it. # 

A.99:  # whoever was directly under him.  #

B.100:  Right, or it should have been looked into more. 

A.101:  Yeah, an now it's coming out where there was, there was holding the
hostages now, they're saying that the hostages were being made political pawns
when Carter and Reagan were running.  I mean, you know.

B.102:  Yeah.  Well that's the way I felt when, uh, Carter and Reagan was running. 
I liked Carter as a president. 

A.103:  He was a, a, a nice man.  I'm not sure, uh, he was too, probably too moral.

B.104:  Uh, yeah, but he was a, I don't know, he was a good Christian and
everything, though.  Well, from what I've seen, I was only sixteen then.  But,
uh, when Reagan came in I fig-, I thought, it ran through my head, that Carter
lost because the hostages, you know, that whole mess.

A.105:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.106:  # Wasn't it # the day after Reagan was elected that they were brought home.

A.107:  # Well shortly there after, yeah. # 

B.108:  # or, yeah, shortly after.  #

A.109:  Yeah, so there was some collusion in there, yes. 

B.110:  I think a lot of people were disappointed because they had been held
hostage for so long.

A.111:  And I think that's part of the problem why people don't vote anymore,
because of, of, it's just out of people's hands and they say one vote means a
lot, but,

B.112:  # But is a lot, enough people.  #

A.113:  # it used to.  I don't think # it, one vote means, means diddley, anymore. 

B.114:  No, but if enough people think like that, then it does, you know. 

A.115:  Yeah, b-, but people get disillusioned too. 

B.116:  (( )) Well if I knew more about it, like I said, if they would get some
kind of educational program out there where just, anybody can learn.

A.117:  Um, probably one of the local, uh, do they have adult ed classes at some of
the local schools. 

B.118:  Oh, I'm sure they do. 

A.119:  Where they teach, uh, you know, like political science or something. 

B.120:  I don't know, I could check into that. 

A.121:  Yeah, because yo-, because it might give you, uh, an insight, you know, uh,
you have to vote.  I've always, I've always voted, I even though sometimes it's
hard to choose between whose running, um. 

B.122:  Right, well wasn't it, I know, I can't remember, i-, thi-, I guess it was
when Frear-, Ferraro, is that her name, when her and, uh, I can't remember who
was running for president with her, I just remember she was going to be vice. 

A.123:  Oh, uh, Ferraro, yeah, Geraldine. 

B.124:  Yeah.  Who was running with her, who was her running mate?

A.125:  Uh, I don't remember.
