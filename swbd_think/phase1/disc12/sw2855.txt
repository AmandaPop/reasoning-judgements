==========================================================================

A.1:  [Beep]  Okay.  So do you enjoy camping?

B.2:  I used to love camping but [laughter] since we've got two little kids our
camping styles have changed dramatically.

A.3:  Yeah, well,

B.4:  We've tried to go camping with them [laughter]  and the last time it wound
up with [laughter]  my husband the only one that couldn't stand them, left in
the tent [breathing]  because the kids wouldn't calm down, they wouldn't go to
sleep, they were crawling all over us.  They thought it was just party time all
night long, you know. 

A.5:  Yeah, we really haven't tried camping with, with our daughter yet.  We,
we'd like to now she's getting a little bit older.  She'd enjoy it.

B.6:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.7:  But, uh, I used to, I was in Boy Scouts all through college and everything
else,

B.8:  Oh, boy, so you're an old hand at it. 

A.9:  so I was involved in a lot of camping, you know, when I was younger, but
[breathing]  --

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  -- even my desires for camping have changed. 

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  Uh, used to be from roughing it and sleeping outside to now to, t-, tents
and motor homes and things like that. 

B.14:  Yeah, I like cabins.  They're real nice [laughter]. 

A.15:  [Laughter]  So,

B.16:  Also I've found that when we've gone camping we've had some bad experiences
sometimes when you even have, seem to have, uh, you know, tent sites that are
a little bit off the beaten path, but there's a cluster of them and we wound
up with people like, you know, four feet away from us that are just bombed out
of their minds or something all night long partying [breathing] and that's not
my idea of going out, you know, and being with nature so,

A.17:  Yeah, plus nowadays you just have to worry about being where you don't,
can't get behind locked doors even,

B.18:  # Oh, yeah, it's frightening.  #

A.19:  # because, you know, somebody # come up and knock you in the head in the
middle of the night.  Or you, heck, you never know. 

B.20:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.21:  But, uh, you know, if I, if I can get way, way up, you know, way up in the
mountains or, you know, way out someplace, I probably be a little bit, uh,
[breathing]  you know, less concerned. 

B.22:  Yeah,

A.23:  # But, uh, #

B.24:  # we went # to Yosemite and, uh, we went, we got a little cabin there and
that was really nice, but, uh, someplace like that where you, like you say, you
can get way out in the middle of nowhere,

A.25:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.26:  # you # know, where you can really be away from civilization.  I, I would
feel safer there than I would some of these little, uh, [breathing]  tent site
areas, you know. 

A.27:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.  I know my brothers, he's a big camp-, uh,
backpacker and everything,

B.28:  # Um.  #

A.29:  # and # I, I'd like to try that sometime with him where they, they actually
just take the sleeping bags and whatever food they, they hike in someplace, you
know,

B.30:  # Oh, wow.  #

A.31:  # up to, # you know, ten, fifteen miles and then they,

B.32:  Oh, # my goodness, #

A.33:  # they, #

B.34:  my body can't handle,

A.35:  # [Laughter].  #

B.36:  # that # anymore [laughter]. 

A.37:  They,

B.38:  I want a queen size air bed, you know, to go in the tent or something. 

A.39:  Yeah.  Yeah really and truly that's, that's, that's more desirable.  Course
with my wife and daughter, you know, any kind of outing is, is would be good
just to get away and do it. 

B.40:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.41:  Uh,

B.42:  I found a problem here, too, since we moved to Texas three years ago I was
feeling like there's places w-, without fire ants [door]  or that aren't, like
all summer long it's so hot.  I, you know, I don't want to be out there when
it's a hundred and ten degrees out trying to sleep. 

A.43:  Well, that's the thing.  There's really only a few months that you can
really get out and really do anything and, uh --

B.44:  Yeah, and it's so wet --

A.45:  -- and, you know,

B.46:  -- in the early part of it. 

A.47:  unless, you know, like I say, unless you have a trailer or motor home and
that,

B.48:  # Yeah.  #

A.49:  # and # that's really what I would like to do someday.  I'd like to be able
to afford a, a trailer, uh [door], 

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # you # know, not a real big one but just something that, that would have,
you know, air-conditioning,

B.52:  # Contained.  #

A.53:  # and # a, and an icebox and stuff like that,

B.54:  # Yeah.  #

A.55:  # so # you can, you can feel, you can feel like you're outside, but, yet,
you know, have a few conveniences. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  Uh,

B.58:  Yeah, I can relate to that [laughter]. 

A.59:  But, uh, [breathing],  you know,

B.60:  [Breathing] We had some friends invite us to go to a place on a couple
weeks that's, uh, four miles of dirt road and they have a trailer that they
keep permanently there, a little travel trailer and they said we could just
camp out.  But with a two year old and a three year old, three days without
running water [laughter] without the toilets,

A.61:  # That's a little tough.  #

B.62:  # I mean, I can't # imagine, you know, the diapers after three days, forget
it [laughter]. 

A.63:  Yeah, that's, that's a little extreme. 

B.64:  Yeah, so, you know,

A.65:  # I, #

B.66:  # I # think we'll pass on that one but, 

A.67:  But, now, you know, uh, I know we'd like to maybe, you know, Disneyworld
has those little campsites out there where you can, you can rent a trailer,
or, you know,

B.68:  # Oh, really? #

A.69:  # pull one # or whatever and that might be kind, # of fun.  #

B.70:  # That would # be nice.  Yeah. 

A.71:  You know, to spend, you know, spend a week doing all that stuff. 

B.72:  Yeah, yeah, that would be fun. 

A.73:  But, I don't think, uh, my wife or my daughter are quite [door]  ready for,
you know, hiking into a campsite and,

B.74:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

A.75:  # sleeping under # the stars and all that kind of stuff, cooking over a
campfire, you know,

B.76:  # [Laughter].  #

A.77:  # I'm # not sure I'm up to it either, really. 

B.78:  Fishing,

A.79:  # Yeah.  #

B.80:  # and # then going, and, you know, eating what you caught, and all that
good stuff, huh.

A.81:  When I was younger, I used to love doing that king of stuff. 

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  It was a challenge, you know, because you were with a bunch of other guys
and, you know, you, it was almost a competition.  But [breathing]  nowadays I
don't care [laughter]. 

B.84:  Yeah.  Give me the Ramada Inn [laughter]. 

A.85:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.86:  Yeah, well, I can understand that.  Well we don't, we'll have to get more
supplies, too.  I mean, that's why it would be hard for me to imagine
backpacking in because it seems like our car's just totally loaded down with
everything we have to go camping [laughter],  it's like,

A.87:  Well, of course, you know, you've got, uh, you got a whole different set of
problems. 

B.88:  Yeah. 

A.89:  You still, you know, you need a stroller and,

B.90:  My, well my husband said next time we go camping with the kids we're just
going to strap them in their car seats at ten o'clock at night and then we'll
go back to the tent [laughter].

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  They'll fall asleep and we'll with able to [laughter]  enjoy nature. 

A.93:  That's about right [laughter]. 

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  Oh, I remember just like when we traveled you, you end up carrying
everything, uh, everything that you own just about,

B.96:  # Yeah, it seems like it.  #

A.97:  # to, you know, take care # of the baby, uh,

B.98:  We need a van or something,

A.99:  # Yeah.  #

B.100:  # to # get, I mean even w-, if we take the dog, forget it, there's no room
for anything else [breathing].  So, yeah,

A.101:  # But, #

B.102:  # it's # hard to do without the creature comforts sometimes. 

A.103:  Yeah, I'm pretty rusty at it anyway.  I don't, I don't know how I'd fare
nowadays.

B.104:  Well, last time we tried, we bought a Coleman camp stove that was
practically new at a garage sale for next to nothing and then we brought it
home and tried one night to get it going and we could never get an even heat
off of it, [breathing] so we need somebody, you know, with experience to go
with us sometime or come over and show us how to [breathing] get it, you know,
going so,

A.105:  Well, nowadays everything's so expensive.  I know, like, you know, a good
sleeping bag nowadays, because like, I, you know, all I've outgrown all that
stuff and, and it's been, it's (( )) worn out anyway. 

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  But to go out and buy a decent sleeping bag, you know, you're talking, you
know, hundred dollars, and --

B.108:  Oh, good grief. 

A.109:  -- and then, then a, you know, a decent tent you're looking at a hundred
fifty, two hundred dollars and, backpack, all that kind of stuff.  I mean you
could,

B.110:  Yeah, you could stay really nicely at a spa somewhere for a,

A.111:  # Yeah.  #

B.112:  # week # for what it would cost you to buy all that [laughter]. 

A.113:  Exactly.  I mean, by the time you get through outfitting yourself and then
having to go sweat doing it, uh, you could, you could go on a Club Med, uh,
[breathing]  everything inclusive,

B.114:  # [Laughter].  #

A.115:  # vacation # [laughter]. 

B.116:  Really [laughter].  Oh, g-,

A.117:  Which I'd enjoy better anyway. 

B.118:  Yeah, [laughter]  well, it,

A.119:  But, uh, but I used to be a real good camper when I was younger.  I, I mean
I used to just, we just, you know, carry canoes and, and, uh,

B.120:  # Oh, that would be fun.  #

A.121:  # we used to hike all # summer long.  We used to go up to New Mexico and,
[breathing]  and we would, uh, we would do nothing but hike and camp for three
months. 

B.122:  Oh, gosh. 

A.123:  And, uh, you know wash your clothes wherever you are,

B.124:  # Yeah.  #

A.125:  # and, # you, you really get used to the outdoors. 

B.126:  Yeah. 

A.127:  Nowadays to, for me to think, even think about doing something like that I
mean it's just kind of like, no, no, not me. 

B.128:  [Laughter]. 

A.129:  Let me tell you, when you get older, you get smarter. 

B.130:  [Laughter]  I guess. 

A.131:  [Laughter]  People actually call that fun. 

B.132:  I'd like to think that anyway [laughter]. 

A.133:  Yeah.  I can't see that being really fun but,

B.134:  Yeah. 

A.135:  I guess, I guess, you know, like I say, if, you know, if you're going on a
big hunting trip and you're going with two or three other guys that were good
at it and that kind of stuff, you know,

B.136:  # Yeah.  #

A.137:  # it # might be okay for a few days. 

B.138:  Well, they have these vacation packages.  I had a friend that went on,
where she went, uh, now what do they call it when you go down the rapids, like
in these rubber boats and stuff, rafting or whatever.

A.139:  Oh, the white waters?

B.140:  Yeah, and she went, oh, gosh to Colorado or someplace, and I mean, they
had, like a, a, a gourmet chef that put, you know, the meal on for them
wherever they tied up at night and I mean it was a whole different ball game.

A.141:  Yeah,

B.142:  # Wasn't like eating beef jerky, #

A.143:  # some of those things are # pretty good, yeah. 

B.144:  or something. 

A.145:  Yeah, some of those things would be okay. 

B.146:  Yeah. 

A.147:  That would be a little, probably,

B.148:  # Expensive.  #

A.149:  # a # little drastic with kids, but for, you know, two adults,

B.150:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

A.151:  # it, it's # rough enough. 

B.152:  Unless you just go and wear them out so badly that they'd collapse by the
time they got off the raft they'd be [breathing], 

A.153:  # [Laughter].  #

B.154:  # wouldn't # be any problem at all for the rest of the evening. 

A.155:  Um. 

B.156:  Oh, boy. 

A.157:  Boy.  I'd even, I'd enjoy doing that myself. 

B.158:  Yeah, yeah, that would be fun. 

A.159:  But, everybody I, everybody I've talked to that has done that, they say
after about three or four days of that --

B.160:  Uh-huh. 

A.161:  -- it takes them, uh, I mean they're sore for a week. 

B.162:  Oh, really?

A.163:  Because, you know,

B.164:  # From all the bouncing.  #

A.165:  # you're, all the tensing # and the bouncing and everything else, you use
muscles you haven't used in years and,

B.166:  Yeah.  That's true. 

A.167:  And, uh, it, you know, that, they end up staying home, you know, another
three or four days when they get home just to recuperate from it. 

B.168:  [Laughter]  Oh, gosh.  That's funny. 

A.169:  So, I don't know. 

B.170:  [Laughter]. 

A.171:  But I, you know, like I said, I used to enjoy camping, but, anymore, you
know, just the whole atmosphere's changed. 

B.172:  Yeah. 

A.173:  You, you don't, you don't hear of many people that's taking their families
and just going out go camping. 

B.174:  Yeah.  That's true. 

A.175:  You know, now it's boating or, or, you know, uh, uh, going on these, uh,
uh, white rapids or whatever the white water,

B.176:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.177:  # you know, # raft rides and stuff like that. 

B.178:  Well, I h-, you know, hear like most of these people say things like going,

A.179:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.180:  # to # s-, you know Walt Disneyworld and stuff like that with their
families.  It's more of a luxury kind of vacation than it is, the, [breathing] 
the roughing it,

A.181:  # Yeah.  #

B.182:  # or # whatever but,

A.183:  Well, they have that, I had it's like a water country or something where
they have this in the wilderness park.  It's close to it where [breathing] you
can take the kid and, and kind of just let them go wild in that water country
--

B.184:  Um. 

A.185:  -- and, uh, you know, and you, and you kind of camp out and, they got l-,
little kitchens in the trailers and stuff but,

B.186:  Oh, that sounds neat. 

A.187:  Sounds like it, sounds like it would be okay for a few days. 

B.188:  Yeah, yeah.  Well maybe when ours get a little older and we really want to
get elaborate, we could do something like that, but right now they think it's a
thrill to p-, put a pool in the backyard, you know that little five foot,

A.189:  # Yeah.  #

B.190:  # K-Mart # specials [laughter].  Give them a glass of juice and, boy,
they're ready for the afternoon, you know. 

A.191:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah they are fun. 

B.192:  Yeah. 

A.193:  [Throat_clearing]  Little toots. 

B.194:  Yep. 

A.195:  Sometimes, you know, I, I think it would be kind of neat maybe if she just
wanted to get a little tent or something and, you know, once we get a fence in
the backyard and, uh, and just let her camp out. 

B.196:  Yeah,

A.197:  # Maybe, #

B.198:  # yeah, # roast marshmallows and,

A.199:  Until, till twelve or one o'clock in the morning, till she gets scared and
wants to come in, you know [breathing]. 

B.200:  [Laughter]  How old is she?

A.201:  She's six. 

B.202:  Oh, yeah [laughter]. 

A.203:  But she, she, she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually,
but they, both my wife and daughter take after each other.  They, they get hot
real easy and just being outside during the summertime.

B.204:  They'll just pass out, huh? 

A.205:  Yeah, and, you know, I, I can go out and mow the grass and everything else
and n-, and stand it just fine and, uh, but my wife, she's real hot natured.
She, she would, uh, she just gets, gets outside for five, ten minutes,

B.206:  # Oh, gosh yeah.  #

A.207:  # and she's ready # to come back in.  So I don't, I don't think camping
this time of year would,

B.208:  # No.  #

A.209:  # I # don't even think she'd think about it. 

B.210:  No, that doesn't sound, too. 

A.211:  It would have to be November, early December. 

B.212:  Yeah, when we were living in California, people all the time went in the
winter, you know, up in the mountains and stuff.  I don't know, I can't see
that either [laughter].

A.213:  Where in California?

B.214:  Uh, south of San Francisco. 

A.215:  Oh, yeah, so that,

B.216:  # In Sunnyvale.  #

A.217:  # that wa-, # that's nice there. 

B.218:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.219:  Because you do have some cool weather and some mountains. 

B.220:  Oh, yeah, the weather's really nice.  And then you go, you know, you can go
up in the mountains and it'll drop thirty degrees just on your drive up there
[breathing],  so that's kind of,

A.221:  I used to go to, uh, Fairfield --

B.222:  Uh-huh. 

A.223:  -- and, uh, that's real pretty country up there. 

B.224:  Yeah, there's a lot of nice,
