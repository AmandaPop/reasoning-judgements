=========================================================================

A.1:  (( )).

B.2:  Where you on the li-, phone a long time?

A.3:  Yeah, I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
[laughter]. 

B.4:  Yeah. 

A.5:  You were, he was waiting for what again?

B.6:  To, he called in to get somebody on the line, it took him about half an
hour to find somebody.

A.7:  That's what this was yeah, well, let me go a head and push one okay? 

B.8:  Okay. 

@A.9:  Okay.  Well, basically I like comedy shows [laughter]. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  Uh, MURPHY BROWN, uh, DESIGNING WOMEN (( )).

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  Yeah what do you like?

B.14:  Well [laughter], 

A.15:  # [Laughter].  #

B.16:  # we # don't have a T V, I mean we have two T V -s but neither one of them
work,

A.17:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.18:  # so for # the last year, I mean we just got married and we decided well,
for the first year we, we won't get a T V so I mean I'm totally out of it as
far,

A.19:  # [Laughter].  #

B.20:  # as # T V goes. 

A.21:  That's okay we'll been married eleven years and, um, we went through that
after about five years of marriage, my old T V that I had from college when we
got married finally went out and we went, we made it almost about eighteen
months without a television. 

B.22:  Really? 

A.23:  Yeah, but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, um, gee
[laughter]. 

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  I needed that, you know, and then you get to remote control the stereo
phonic,

B.26:  # [Laughter].  #

A.27:  # whatever # all of those things,

B.28:  # V C R, and everything else.  #

A.29:  # oh, yeah, and then you never # use the V C R, and now we have two of them
and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk
player cause we wouldn't use it [laughter]. 

B.30:  Really. 

A.31:  Yeah, I mean it's cause your never home, you know, you're working, you're
at school.

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  Well, I don't know T V shows, what can I tell you, um, basically junk
that's on television [laughter].

B.34:  # Yeah.  #

A.35:  # That's # my opinion yeah, um, I like things like I just mentioned, have
you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that?

B.36:  I don't think so [laughter]. 

A.37:  You don't think so, oh, that's the one with Candice Bergen in it, um,

B.38:  Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a
half, so. 

A.39:  Yeah, that would do it. 

B.40:  I would never see any shows any way and then before that I was in college
for four years and I never watched T V then because I didn't have time.

A.41:  Right, nobody does yeah, then, uh-huh. 

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  I know. 

B.44:  I mean I did watch T V it was soaps and M T V cause the girls I lived with
never changed the channels (( )).

A.45:  And the, uh, well I don't, you're probably at least ten years younger then
I am but I could tell you in school that, uh, the only thing that ever saw in
the dorm was, uh, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN.

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  And until then I never paid attention to soap operas. 

B.48:  Me too. 

A.49:  And to this day twenty years later I'm like, I'm in my thirties, I'm not
that old, but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television
[laughter]. 

B.50:  I know, I mean I al-, I almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took
about it at dinner and everything else it, you know, it was like. 

A.51:  Yeah, they, you know, about the only other kinds of things I like, um, I
like to watch a lot of news, um, don't you miss that with not having a
television so far?

B.52:  Um. 

A.53:  How long has it been since you've had one?

B.54:  Well, about, almost a year. 

A.55:  Oh my God [laughter]. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  Yeah, you've got about another six months and then you'll get one
[laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter]  Well,

A.59:  # By then, #

B.60:  # I mean # I never really watched it much growing up but I thought, you
know, my husband would really like miss it because he, he was an only child and
he wa-, he's seen a lot of T V. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  And I figured oh, no it will never last but. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  I mean I don't miss it that much. 

A.65:  Yeah, my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that's kind of why
we got back after eighteen months,

B.66:  # [Laughter]  That's funny.  #

A.67:  # [Laughter]  and I'm # trying to think about the only other show I watch. 

B.68:  I've seen CHEERS probably five times and I've seen CROS-, COSBY SHOW
probably ten times. 

A.69:  Yeah,

B.70:  # [Laughter].  #

A.71:  # I # like COSBY, L A LAW is probably, I've seen CHEERS more then that I
hate to admit but, uh,

B.72:  It's pretty cool I like that whenever I watch it. 

A.73:  CHEERS? Yeah, I thought it was good, I've actually been to that bar in
Boston it's a nice, you know, it's a pretty funny show.

B.74:  Oh, you have?

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  Yeah, I've heard it's pretty cool. 

A.77:  It's just a, you know, over priced [laughter]  downtown,

B.78:  # Yeah.  #

A.79:  # Boston # yuppie, you know,

B.80:  # Yeah.  #

A.81:  # tourist # attraction.  I'm trying to think what else is on television, I
know it's like. 

B.82:  [Breathing]  I watched a lot of T V when the war was on. 

A.83:  Yeah, who didn't?  Isn't that sad? 

B.84:  And then, uh, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and,

A.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.86:  # and # pro football, I mean that sounds kind of stupid but,

A.87:  # Oh not, no, #

B.88:  # I do like # it. 

A.89:  I like the pro, actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to, (( )) I
watch pro football but I like the N B A play-offs,

B.90:  # Yeah.  #

A.91:  # back # when like the Pistons were in them and now, where are you calling
from?

B.92:  Uh, Sherman, Texas. 

A.93:  Sherman, Texas, oh,

B.94:  # Where are you from? #

A.95:  # I'm in Dallas I # was just saying where am I calling you from, you know,
well then I don't know if you like the, the Mavericks or not, they haven't been
that good this year.  Um, we're supposed to talk about television let's see

B.96:  So, are you really from Texas though?

A.97:  Yeah, I'm talking to you from Dallas, uh-huh. 

B.98:  Well, sounds like you're from up north. 

A.99:  My voice you mean?

B.102:  # Oh.  #

A.103:  # I'm # originally from Pennsylvania, so. 

B.104:  I was going to say. 

A.105:  [Laughter]. 

B.106:  Cause I wondered if you really, you know, if had any teams you like
watching from up north or something.

A.107:  Uh, actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan.

B.114:  Yeah, so I like the Bears. 

A.115:  Yeah, there you go, and then [laughter], 

B.116:  # [Laughter].  #

A.117:  # and, # um, I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television
sports wise.  I like,

B.118:  # I watch, uh, huh.  #

A.119:  # I like tennis so # I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years but, um, I

B.122:  Yeah. 

A.123:  It gets boring after a while but I don't, go ahead. 

B.124:  I wa-, used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons,

A.125:  # OPRAH [laughter].  #

B.126:  # before I # went to work and stuff and I see her every once in awhile like
if I go workout at T I,

A.127:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.128:  # you # know, they have those T V -s right,

A.129:  # Yeah, on the, #

B.130:  # in front of # the treadmills,

A.131:  on the tracks yeah, is sh-,

B.132:  I don't know she's not as good as she use to be but,

A.133:  Maybe cause she got chubby again or something,

B.134:  [Laughter]  her disposition's gone downhill. 

A.135:  Was she, was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been
out that long?

B.136:  Was what?

A.137:  Was her show big when you where in college, since you,

B.138:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.139:  # haven't been # that long?

B.140:  It's pretty cool,

A.141:  # Was it? #

B.142:  # I mean # back then and the show, did you see the show where she lost all
of that fat?

A.143:  Yeah I saw reruns of it,

B.144:  # She pu-, she wheeled it out on a ((cart)). #

A.145:  # I saw tapes of her [laughter],  yeah.  #

B.146:  That was so cool, and then man she's really porked out again I guess but,

A.147:  Gee, I know isn't that terrible. 

B.148:  Yeah. 

A.149:  I know I guess with that money who cares [laughter]. 

B.150:  [Laughter]. 

A.151:  I don't know. 

B.152:  I'd eat too. 

A.153:  Let's see what else is on television.  Oh, if you don't have a V C R we
just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it.

B.154:  Really. 

A.155:  Yeah, cause, you know, if you like movies like we do you do it once in
awhile and then, you know, you see it when it first comes out if you really
want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years.

B.156:  Yeah, we got,

A.157:  # You know.  #

B.158:  # we've got # the dollar Cinema in Sherman so we usually see like
first-rate movies,

suppose to talk [laughter]  about so I mean,

B.162:  Yeah I'm sorry. 

A.163:  That's okay,

B.164:  # [Laughter].  #

A.165:  # don't, # (( )) I mean, I, I always (( )).

B.166:  Well, it's hard to talk about something, it's like me talking about taxes
or something,

A.167:  # Yeah.  #

B.168:  # I # feel bad cause I mean,

A.169:  # Oh, that's okay.  #

B.170:  # I should know # something about T V shows. 

A.171:  I had one lady one time they called in I just signed up my husband had been
on this project, um, and I, I, she called in and it was all about, we don't
have children and it was all about, um, sending your kids to college,

B.172:  # [Laughter].  #

A.173:  # and # why you would advise them.  And she was from Boston, and she, I
shouldn't talk about this but she was, [laughter] pretend she was a television
show, and sh-, she was very snooty and, uh, her kids were going to places like
Amherst and B U and I said I didn't know what that was I she went, oh, and I
thought, um, so I know,

B.174:  # [Laughter].  #

A.175:  # I # mean it's like don't worry about it television at least, you know,
everybody's,

A.187:  # I # can't remember [laughter]  his name. 

B.188:  Yeah, but what about this Wolf guy?

A.189:  Yeah, ((but just th-)), they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW
and all of that,

B.190:  Oh.

B.192:  You know, what my absolutely favorite show is?

A.193:  Uh-huh.

B.206:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.207:  # so # to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse and Pat
says no I carry a fanny pack [laughter].
