=============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, I think we're supposed to discuss the changes in the roles of women
in the last generation or two an --

B.2:  Uh-huh, right.

A.3:  -- and my opinion is that, uh, the biggest changes, uh, probably, are
about two, and one, of course is obvious and that's the working woman.

B.4:  Right.

A.5:  And, uh, the second one, which I don't know if you'd go along with or not
is that maybe a lot of women are not as, uh, likely to want to be dominated,
as ((past times)).

B.6:  Well that's, I would say that's probably true.  Uh, I know in, in my
wife's case, she is a very independent sort, uh, you know, she, she has a lot
of say about, uh, you know, just about everything that, uh, happens in our
family life. 

A.7:  And you're proud of that.

B.8:  And yes, I am.  I, I, you know, I, I feel very confident that if, you
know, something were to happen to me, or to us, either one, that, uh, you
know, she would be capable of taking care of her own, you know, whatever her
own needs were.

A.9:  Of course.

B.10:  Right and, and I think that's very important [cough].

A.11:  Well, uh, another, uh, thing that I want to talk about is, which of the,
the changes that you can think of are the most significant?

B.12:  Well, I, I really think that that, that independence of, of women is, uh,
probably more important an, and I guess that, uh, really came about because of
the change, a lot of it anyway, because of the change in the work force.  Uh,
with more women working and having, uh, more, uh, important, or, or, what's
the right term, anyway, their jobs being, you know, more people depending on
them and more management decisions made.  I think that, uh, lends to being,
you know, more independent and, stepping out an, and saying what you want to
say and what needs to be said.

A.13:  Well and don't you think that you do see more women who are, um, becoming
part of middle management?

B.14:  Yes, I, I, I, that's, even, even, uh, upper management is, is, uh, I think
is going to be a, a coming thing for, for women too, uh.  And in the
professions also.  Not just, uh, not just within company management, but, you
know, professional people that, uh, are going out on their own.

A.15:  Attorneys.

B.16:  Attorneys and lawyers, I'm an accountant, a C P A and, uh, I know quite a
few women C P A -s, you know, that are out working on their own, running
their own accounting practice,

A.17:  Uh-huh, 

B.18:  #and doing quite well.#

A.19:  #let me ask you a question,# uh, while we're talking about the C P A women,
uh, in, uh, a firm say, do you think, uh, a woman C P A gets paid equally to a
man.

B.20:  Uh, I would, I'm not sure, but I would think so.  Within, uh, within a
public accounting firm, uh, if they're on the same level of responsibility.
Now, I would say that there's, you know, some, uh, or, I would even say a
probability that women still have it a little more difficult to achieve the
same level that a man does.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Uh, there's, you know, there's still some stereotypes, uh, within, even
within the, the accounting practice.

A.23:  We-, and even within women. 

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  Tha-, they perhaps, some women do not expect, uh,

B.26:  [Cough] Um, but, um, e-, within, within public accounting, within the
what is now the big six accounting firms in particular, the, uh, the people
that's starting off in accounting, uh, have an awful lot of, uh, hours to work
and, and there's a lot of stress put on them, uh, a lot of requirements for,
uh, you know, traveling and being available all hours and, and, that kind of
thing.

A.27:  Going away on those audits.

B.28:  Right, an, and I think that, uh, that some women may, you know, they may
tend, still tend to, to not want to do that, s-, to the point that they would
restrict their own possibility for,

A.29:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.30:  uh, for promotion, to achieve that.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:   But, you know, the ones that, the ones that really want to, uh,
certainly can go ahead and achieve that.

A.33:  Well what, what future do you see for us, in the next twenty years, say.

B.34:  Um, I, I would say that, uh, there will be, you know, in the business
world there will be more, uh, opportunities and more expansion of the women's
role in business and I see, uh, women's roles expanding in the political area,

A.35:  Yes.

B.36:  uh, quite a bit.  Uh, of course, you know, we, in Texas we've got, uh,
uh, a woman governor now.

A.37:  Oh yes.

B.38:  Uh, and we've had all, let's see what have we got, uh, four, say five
major cities in Texas that have all had women mayors I think, uh, recently,
uh, three, at least three of them have women mayors now.

A.39:  Charlotte also has a woman mayor.

B.40:  And, uh, you know, I, I see, uh, you know, the movement of women into,
into the political arena as being very important, uh.

A.41:  Well I'll tell you what worries me a little bit about, uh, the role of
women these days and I'm hoping that that's going to be a change.  And I don't
know if you see it or not, my husband doesn't always, uh, see it, or
understand it, uh, and that is the, uh, the trial of trying to be the
superwoman, the supermom.

B.42:  Yeah, the supermom, yes.

A.43:  Yes, and, uh, I have gone through that, uh, myself, and it is hell,
it really is, is tough,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  and to be able to excuse myself from doing that was a wonderful
liberation.

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  And I gu-, I ha-, I think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves.
But I believe that in the future,

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  that they're going to stop trying to be all things.  

B.50:  Right, I, I think they'll be, uh, i-, you know, in, in the political area,
I suppose, uh, f-, for the most part politicians have gone through their, a
good bit of their business life before they get into politics and, and I think
that, that if that's the, the situation for women, they will have had their
family life and their business life, 

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  you know, maybe earlier and then move into politics and I think that's,
uh, you know, that's the way that, uh, you can ha-, you know women can have
all things, yo-, you just can't have them all at once.

A.53:  Yes and,

B.54:  #[Laughter] [breathing] and, uh, I think that's, you know, that's the
case for men, you know, for the most part, too.#

A.55:  #A very, I will s-, say this very quickly.# I had an attorney friend who
said, and he'd been practicing probably twenty-five years, and he said, I wish
there were more women in politics, they are not quite as crooked.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  Well I, I think that's, uh, that's the truth, a-, and I, I think that
there's, I think and this is, uh, may be a bad thing for me to say, but I
think that women have a higher moral, uh, character, for the most part than
men do, and it, you know, the, along the sexual type, you know, the,

A.59:  The acceptable morals that we,

B.60:  the little things that men, that get involved in.  

A.61:  uh-huh, yes.

B.62:  Right, that, uh, women just don't tend to do that.  Uh, of, of course, it
takes, you know, it takes a man and a women both, but I think that women have,
or, or a little more, uh, discreet, or at, at least a little more careful
about what they do.

A.63:  Are reticent about it anyway.

B.64:  And, uh, and, you know, a woman congressman's not going to have her
picture taken on a boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with, you know, with
some young guy,

A.65:  Uh-huh, however,

B.66:  for the most part.

A.67:  I, being, uh, uh, former employer, myself, I did change from being
someone who I, who felt that women could, uh, share, out share one job and
things like that and I became more understanding of how men often are, ha-, or
for, for many years have thought about, uh, women in the working world, 

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  and my husband couldn't believe, and he started teasing me and calling me
a male chauvinist, or a female chauvinist.

B.70:  [Laughter]  Right.

A.71:  But I do, I think there certainly some pluses, uh, on both sides, we
just need to get them all put together. 

B.72:  Right, and, uh,  

A.73:  Well it's been so nice talking to you, an,

B.74:  Yeah, it's been nice talking to you, too.

A.75:  Good luck to you and have a nice day.

B.76:  Okay, thank you, you too.

A.77:  Bye.
