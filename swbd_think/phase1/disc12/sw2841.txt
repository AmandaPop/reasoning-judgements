=====================================================================

A.1:  Yeah, I have.  What about yourself?

B.2:  Well, uh, a few, I guess, uh, I was trying to think [laughter] as I was
asking you just exactly what movies I had seen recently.  I, I took my wife to
see one, uh, oh, my goodness, I can't, you tell me first because I can't think
right now.

A.3:  Yeah, I should because I've been waiting for a few minutes to talk.  Uh,
understand, interestingly enough, I had the same topic yesterday when I
called, so I've got my spiel down.

B.4:  You mean you had the same topic twice?

A.5:  Uh-huh --

B.6:  Um.

A.7:  -- twice in a row, second time it's happened to me but, uh,

@B.8:  Um.

A.9:  Let's see, last week my wife and I went to see, uh, KINDERGARTEN COP,

B.10:  Oh, now that was great, we saw that too.

A.11:  Yeah, that was, it was, it was pretty cool.

B.12:  It's the first time I've seen him do a, uh, a comedy almost type show --

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  -- which is kind of a, a change for Arnold Schwarzenegger --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- yeah, now that was a good show.  My wife and I enjoyed that a lot.  I
think the kids did too.  We didn't go together, though.

A.17:  Oh, they went another time though?  

B.18:  Yeah, they, well, I got one runs around, I got two boys, and one boy runs
around with one, his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his
group of friends.  I think both of them separately saw it at two different
times, even with their group of friends [laughter].

A.19:  Wow.

B.20:  And then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half
movie house.

A.21:  Yeah, well, fortunately we have a dollar movie here, so,

B.22:  They used to be a dollar here, but it finally went up.

A.23:  Oh, I hope doesn't.  I think they're hedging to, but, uh --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- I don't want them, anyway it was worth, uh, two bucks for my wife and I
to go, so,

B.26:  Oh, yeah, it was, good show, we enjoyed.  Uh, we went to see, uh, THE 
KING --

A.27:  Okay.

B.28:  -- I think it's THE KING, Mary Jo and I did.  That's the one that, uh, oh,
I forget the guy's name that stars with Roseanne on T V.  Oh,

A.29:  Goodman?

B.30:  Yeah, Goodman, and, uh, that was funny, now, that was really a good show --

A.31:  Okay.

B.32:  -- I mean, it wasn't a great show.  It's just a B movie --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- but it was fun.  I think, uh, I think, uh, you and your wife would enjoy
that.  It's pretty light hearted humor and, and, and it was, uh, it was kind
of neat, kind of cute.

A.35:  Couple of dollars worth of laughs?

B.36:  Oh, it was definitely worth that.  It, it was worth couple of bucks just to
get out and watch that, and it was upbeat movie and everything else, and, uh,
you know, uh, eat the popcorn and all that.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  That's where they make the money, is on the popcorn, anyway --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- they charge ridiculous prices.  They charge more for the popcorn than
they do for the movie [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah [laughter].  THE KING, huh, okay.

B.42:  I think it's called THE KING, or something like that.  It's, it's, uh, John
Goodman, I think --

A.43:  Okay.

B.44:  -- it's, you know, and he's the main star in the whole movie, and it's got
a p-, couple pretty good, uh, supporting actors --

A.45:  All right.

B.46:  -- and, uh, it's funny, it, it really is.  Uh, you know, we, uh, rather
enjoyed.  Trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that, we
went to see one movie, I can't remember the name of it now though, but it was,
uh, oh, what was it, I can't remember, that's just terrible.

A.47:  [Laughter].  

B.48:  Anyway, I, I long time back, uh, uh, for the benefit at least of the
subject we're discussing, I went to see DIE HARD TWO --

A.49:  Yeah,

B.50:  -- I guess it was D-, DIE HARDER --

A.51:  Yeah,

B.52:  -- and that was a scream --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- and, you know, I thought that was pretty good, and um, uh, I don't know,
I can't think of another one other than that at the moment.  How about you?

A.55:  Well, my wife has a problem with, uh, she can't suspend her disbelief of a
movie.  Like she'll sit there and say, That won't happen, that can't happen,

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  there's no way, you know, so it's kind of hard for me to pick like a,
uh, like if we would go see a Von Dame {phonetically spelled} movie --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth,
you know --

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.61:  -- he, she'd be like, no, he, he couldn't do that, you can't beat up ten
guys at once with guns and --

B.62:  [Laughter] So she can't really enjoy it.

A.63:  -- yeah, so she can't even enjoy it.  But I think we're working on her a
little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- so --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- we've been working, uh, a couple of friends and myself, uh, we've been,
you know, we'll go to like, uh, Segal, or we haven't went to Segal yet, we're
going to --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and Van Damme and like, uh, Stallone --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- like the FIRST BLOOD,

B.72:  Stallone just did a comedy, incidentally, that, uh, I think's out now.

A.73:  Yeah, that's what the guy told me last night.  He's like a gangster or
something --

B.74:  Yeah, yeah.

A.75:  -- so, I'd like to see that.

B.76:  Yeah, I'm kind of looking forward that, my wife says there's one she wants
me to take her to see this weekend [sniffing] and, uh, I'm trying, it's about
a, it's, it's one that was done a long time ago.  I think Tony Curtis, uh, uh,
uh, was, uh, the star in, where the guy dies, falls overboard or something,
and comes back as a woman --

A.77:  Huh.

B.78:  -- and, uh, there's, uh, uh, a movie coming out, uh, gosh what's the name
of that, it's already out, matter of fact, it's been advertised on T V, um,
about a guy that falls ov-, he gets killed somehow or another, and he comes
back as a woman, and you talk about funny, at least the little snapshot
previews that they've shown on T V advertising it are hilarious, I mean it is
really funny, and, uh, so, we're going to go see that.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  Now we saw a movie called SISTERS, what's, uh, that may have been almost a
year ago, now I think about it, that was quite good.  I don't know if you've,

A.81:  Did that have that girl from CHEERS in it?

B.82:  Uh, let's see, I don't remember whether CHEERS, no, I don't think so.

A.83:  Okay.

B.84:  (( )) Christie,

A.85:  Yeah,

B.86:  No, I don't think she was in this one.  I was trying to remember exactly
who the characters were, but, uh, it was a real touching show, about three
sisters,

A.87:  Oh, okay, this was a comedy, so it probably wouldn't be [laughter] the same
one.

B.88:  No, no, this, this was a real, uh, uh, sort of serious piece, it had some
light moments, but basically it was a serious piece.  I thought it was just
called SISTERS or something like that, or the THE SISTERS or THE THREE
SISTERS, or something.  Um, I, I can't really quite remember, and then we saw
one, uh, some time back.  It's a shame I can't remember the titles of these
for the benefit of this conversation, although it may not be that the, uh,
necessarily the, uh, intent, but nevertheless we saw one here a while back
that Dolly Parton and several ladies starred in.  Three or four or five, uh,
three or four women together.

A.89:  With old Shirley MacLaine,

B.90:  Yeah, yeah, 

A.91:  Oh, yeah, I don't know the name of it either.

B.92:  Yeah, that was pretty good.  It was okay, uh, you know, most of this stuff
is B movies anyway.

A.93:  Have you seen AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams?

B.94:  No, I haven't.

A.95:  I would suggest that, it's

B.96:  Have you seen that?

A.97:  Yes, I have.

B.98:  Was it really good, I've heard all kinds of mixed things about it.

A.99:  Well, I'm, uh, leaning toward medical professions --

B.100:  Are you?

A.101:  -- so it had some, you know, he was a doctor, and it was in a clinical --

B.102:  Psychologist, something like that.

A.103:  -- yeah, psychiatric, uh, clinical setting, so it was interesting to, to
say the least from that standpoint, because it is a true story, and,

B.104:  Oh, yeah, that's right, I think it was a take off from true story, you're
right.

A.105:  Yeah, so,

B.106:  Now who was the guy he rehabilitated?  He starred in TAXI, or not TAXI, uh,
oh,

A.107:  Was it DeNiro? 

B.108:  Yeah, it was Robert DeNiro, right.

A.109:  Yeah, that, he just did an incredible job of acting.

B.110:  Did he?  Well did you ever see, speaking of, uh, of, uh, medical oriented
movie, or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated, did you ever see
the one that Dustin Hoffman starred in.

A.111:  RAIN MAN.

B.112:  Yeah.  Now wasn't that a good show?

A.113:  Yeah, now that --

B.114:  I really enjoyed it.

A.115:  -- see, if you liked that, you would --

B.116:  Oh, man, I enjoyed that show,

A.117:  -- okay, if you liked that, um, you'd probably --

B.118:  My wife and I both enjoyed that.

A.119:  -- yeah, you would enjoy AWAKENINGS.  AWAKENINGS is as touching --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- but it doesn't have the, the language and other things that might
detract from the movie --

B.122:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.123:  -- it's, it's really, it's a movie I wouldn't mind taking my kids to --

B.124:  Oh, I see, that's good,

A.125:  -- and I mean, it's really clean --

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  -- and, but it's, it doesn't lose any quality, I mean, I think sometimes
movies try to spice it up a little bit, with things unnecessary language or
nudity or whatever --

B.128:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

A.129:  -- but this one here is, AWAKENINGS is very clean.  

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  That was the only thing I didn't like about --

B.132:  RAIN MAN,

A.133:  -- sure it makes it true to life and everything, but, uh, you know, about
RAIN MAN, the language is harsh every now and then.

B.134:  Yeah, yeah,

A.135:  But, yeah, it was cool after I'd seen it three or four times.

B.136:  Right, yeah, that, that was one that we really enjoyed.  I was trying to
think of a, oh, what was that one though.  It slips me now, unfortunately.  I
should have spent a month thinking about this.

A.137:  Well, it's, you called on the spur of the moment, you don't really know,

B.138:  Yeah, yeah, um, oh, uh, how about any older shows, like John Wayne movies
and things like.  You got any favorites along those lines?

A.139:  Oh, yeah, uh, I like most of the old John Wayne westerns --

B.140:  Yeah, me too.

A.141:  -- like EL DORADO, is that one --

B.142:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

A.143:  -- and, uh.

B.144:  I like almost everything he.  Yeah, I really love TRUE GRIT --

A.145:  Yeah, TRUE GRIT,

B.146:  -- and, uh,

A.147:  ROOSTER COGBURN,

B.148:  Yeah, oh, man I thought they were really, really fun, very interesting --

A.149:  Oh,

B.150:  -- and the one he did with his boys, uh, JAKE, BIG JAKE --

A.151:  Yeah.

B.152:  -- I've seen that on T V several times, and that was a lot of fun movie.
You know, I have kind of favorite because I like the, uh, the musical scores
to it.  Matter of fact I had to hunt for years to finally find a copy of the
record, because they made so few of them.  It wasn't, really wasn't all that
popular, and that was, uh, not, was it, HOGAN'S HEROES,

A.153:  Yeah, T V show,

B.154:  KELLY'S HEROES, KELLY'S HEROES name of the show --

A.155:  KELLY'S HEROES, yeah,

B.156:  -- the one that Clint Eastwood stars in, and, uh --

A.157:  Yeah.

B.158:  -- and Carroll O'Connor --

A.159:  Uh-huh.

B.160:  -- now that's one of my favorite shows.  I really enjoy, I've been trying
to tape that one for years, and haven't succeeded in doing so yet.

A.161:  Really.

B.162:  But I finally did find an album.  I had to look around several different
dealers here in the, uh, uh, Maryland area and put the word out to find the
album that had the, uh, movie score on it, that, you know, they open the show
with, uh, uh, a movie sc-, with a score to that, and then they wind up at the
end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites.  I've loved it for years,
and I'm sitting here as I tell you this trying to think of the name of it.
But, uh, [throat_clearing] it's sung by the Herb Alpert congregation, uh, the,
uh, the, uh, the opening and the closing score of KELLY'S HEROES.

A.163:  Huh, do you remember much about that movie?

B.164:  KELLY'S HEROES, the movie?

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  Yeah, I, I remember that, uh, uh, they on their way into Germany, they make
up their own little Army, you might say.  They start out small, but they get
[laughter] bigger and bigger all the time.  They bribe this guy, well, little
bribe, he's willing to go in on it, they've got three tanks that have these
huge --

A.167:  Uh-huh.

B.168:  -- pipes he puts on the turrets to make,
