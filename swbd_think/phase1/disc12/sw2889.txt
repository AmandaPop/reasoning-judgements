===========================================================================

@B.1:  [Noise]  {TV or radio} Okay, what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?

A.2:  Oh, not very many of those at, uh, sometimes I, I play the trumpet, and
sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces. 

B.3:  Uh-huh. 

A.4:  And then I have a five year old daughter and we cut out things, kind of,
you know, and color and, uh, and, uh, use markers and things like that.

B.5:  Uh-huh. 

A.6:  Um, how about you?

B.7:  In, well I used to be more into crafts, when I was younger, like high
school stuff.  I was in four H and I did a lot of latch hook --

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  -- made rugs and stuff.  Um, and, uh, I've learned how to crochet, but I
don't really know, I mean, I don't do it that much.  Not really an indoor
hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.

A.10:  #Um.# 

B.11:  #I'd# rather be outside. 

A.12:  Yeah, exactly. 

B.13:  Um, I used to play trombone [laughter]. 

A.14:  Uh-huh. 

B.15:  I don't know if that was a, not really, I don't play it that much any more,
but I, um, what else do I do.  Mainly do reading.  I don't have a lot of crafty
type things I do. 

A.16:  Uh-huh. 

B.17:  But, uh, {pause} what are some other things you enjoy?

A.18:  I don't know.  My, my father is in the, in the antique business. 

B.19:  Uh-huh [Sniffing]. 

A.20:  And he, uh, he goes around to garage sales and he buys all kinds of, um,
china and figurines and statues and #stuff.# 

B.21:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.22:  And, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair.  It's
called J B Weld --

B.23:  Uh-huh. 

A.24:  -- and I repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once.  But he,

B.25:  [Sniffing]. 

A.26:  mixes colors in it.  It's an epoxy resin that you mix together. 

B.27:  Oh, cool. 

A.28:  And he makes like, the other day he was working on a hand that was
shattered on a, a statue that's real small, it's like about maybe the hand's
about the size of a cricket.

B.29:  Oh, wow. 

A.30:  And, uh, has, uh, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking
out, and he was repairing that, and, uh, it came out pretty good.  It's kind
of a, kind of a ivory color all over and --

B.31:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.32:  -- #and, uh,# has some age spots in it, and it looked, you know, just like
it, it had been there all the time. 

B.33:  Huh [sniffing]. 

A.34:  And he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them,
and, uh, molds that in.  He had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he
fixed that way. 

B.35:  [Sniffing]  Uh-huh. 

A.36:  It worked out real well, too.  #And then,#

B.37:  #Do you#  ever,

A.38:  And --

B.39:  Huh?

A.40:  -- and then he, uh,

B.41:  [Noise]. 

A.42:  he thatches, uh, you know, those, uh, thatched chairs. 

B.43:  Yeah. 

A.44:  Course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about. 

B.45:  Yeah. 

A.46:  That takes a lot of time. 

B.47:  That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff. 

A.48:  Yeah.  And he used to paint, um, a long time ago, but I think he's stopped
pretty much now. 

B.49:  Oh [sniffing]. 

A.50:  But outside of, outside of art class in, in school, I, I stopped doing most
of that, unless I, I mean, like he has a computer, and I use, um, the graphics
--

B.51:  Yeah. 

A.52:  -- um, software on that,
[Noise]  [Sigh]  {pause} to, uh, to do figures and to look at things, you
know, see how they work. 

B.53:  Right.  That sounds interesting. 

A.54:  Uh-huh. 

B.55:  Um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?

A.56:  Oh, yeah, sometimes, but it's not one of my favorite things, especially
from the vapors, and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year.
Uh, we [talking] bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place --

B.57:  Uh-huh [sniffing]. 

A.58:  -- and sanded it down and, uh, stained it and then lacquered over it
[/Talking]. 

B.59:  Pretty time consuming, isn't it?

A.60:  Oh, yeah. 

B.61:  But, it's g-, it's nice to have it when you're done, #I mean, looks
pretty.# 

A.62:  #Uh-huh, sure is.# 

B.63:  So, I've done that once but it didn't come out that well. 

A.64:  Did you use a, did you use a Zar stain?

B.65:  Uh, I don't remember.  It was, I had my parents buy everything, and I ended
up, it was their table, their kitchen table.  It came out really dark. 

A.66:  Um, {pause} they had a, um, well I saw the commercial on T V, and they,
and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it, that's called,
it's Z,

B.67:  [Sniffing]. 

A.68:  A R {spells out}.

B.69:  Uh-huh. 

A.70:  And, uh, it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast, so it's, if
you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.

B.71:  Yeah. 

A.72:  And uh, we,

B.73:  [Sniffing]. 

A.74:  put, we put tung oil on it.  Kind of made it sticky for a while.  But after
it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard, and it was all right. 

B.75:  I remember it took me a long time, it took me like several months, or
several weeks to do it during the summer, and then after I got it done it was
pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.  Since I've moved away
[laughter]  they've had it redone.  So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up
real quick. 

A.76:  Yeah. 

B.77:  But, [sigh] I don't know.  [Sigh] Like I said, I like doing a lot of
outdoor stuff, so [sniffing] but during Four H, I mean they really encouraged
to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in-, interesting, I like that
[Sniffing].

A.78:  Uh-huh [noise].  Were you in a, were you the Girl Scouts, too or,

B.79:  No, well, yeah when I was real young I was for a couple,

A.80:  [Noise]. 

B.81:  of years [sneezing].  Excuse me.  So, uh,  [lipsmack]  anyway, it was
nice talking to you Dudley. 

A.82:  Well, it was nice talking to you.  

B.83:  Have a good day now. 

A.84:  Okay, you too. 

B.85:  Bye [Noise]  {TV or radio}.

A.86:  Bye-bye.
