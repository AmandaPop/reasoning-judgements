=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, okay.  Now, ((as you were)) saying. 

B.2:  I said one thing we've been doing around here is trying to find ways of
having, uh, my husband likes gourmet food [laughter]. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And I'm trying to figure out how, how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff
[laughter]  and the kids will eat it too and it's not going to be fattening,
high in fat, or high in cholesterol, get's to be a, a real chore [door]  with
little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese. 

A.5:  Right, that's true. 

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  Um, I have the same problem I've, uh, (( )) both of us like cheese, uh, my
children are grown now, um, and I also like ice cream so,

B.8:  I ((just have)) (( )) with that, I have never really had an ice cream
((fetish)), but I'm married to somebody who just feels that, you know, if you
offer it to him he'd eat a hot fudge sundae every night of the week. 

A.9:  Oh. 

B.10:  And hate him for it. 

A.11:  Yeah, well, everyone has their own little things right.  His is ice cream
or,

B.12:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.13:  # hot fudge # sundaes.  But, I tell you what we use to do even when the
children were growing up, every Friday night would be our night that, um, uh,
put to kids to bed when they were younger and my wife and I would, would, uh,
she'd set the dining room table with candles and no one disturbed us, no one
called on Friday night and we would just have this quiet dinner for the two of
us, and that, uh, that's held up until our youngest is graduating college in
the couple of weeks and we still do that.

B.14:  Wow. 

A.15:  Um, well, we also like to do is we like to cook out a lot even in the
winter time we got, we got a grill and I've got like a wood shop ((off the))
garage and I've got a, a like an over hang and we keep the grill out there so
I just out and we, you know, grill steaks or salmon or whatever.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  Um, so, um, so I can give you something that we like to do. 

B.18:  Give me something that's really easy to do. 

A.19:  Well, clams ((casino)) if you like clams ((casino)).

B.20:  I love clams, but I'm not sure what clams casino are and I don't know if I
could find clams that I would eat down here in Texas. 

A.21:  Oh, yeah, well, (( )) you lived in Boston so you know (( )),

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # a # little about, you know, and in a restaurant they, they just kind of
serve them on a half shell with a little bit of, uh, stuffing.  What we like
the to do is, uh, is to cut them out and then cut them into little quarters or
eighths, you know, not so much just one big bite.

B.24:  Uh-huh

A.25:  And then cut up fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery and bread
crumbs and mix it all together, and precook bacon so it's kind of soft. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  And put a strip of bacon over the top of that and then, and then pop them
in the oven.

B.28:  God, that sounds good. 

A.29:  And we usually have that and then we'll have a salad, and I'll throw a
steak on the grill with, uh, what I call a potato bake, I buy a, uh, couple of
yams and some either red potato or either white potato, and I put them in a
microwave and cook them so they're fairly soft.

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  And I slice them, I peel the yam, slice that.  I slice the white potato
with the skin on.  I slice up a mild onion preferably a (( )) onion.

B.32:  Now, in Texas it would have to be ((ten fifteen)).

A.33:  Oh.  And then I put it in tin foil and (( ))) I put a slice of white potato
and slice sweet potato and slice of onion, and then I do that until I got the
size of a baked potato, put butter and salt on it garlic,

B.34:  # Uh.  #

A.35:  # ((cover)) # the tin foil and I throw it on the grill, cause I like it a
little crispy on the bottom, so I throw it on the grill maybe about ten
minutes before I put the steak on.  And then once, once the steak is done
that's usually done.  And then we have, uh,

B.36:  God that sound wonderful. 

A.37:  And then ((either)) spinach I like spinach, or, uh, asparagus.  Cause we
grow own asparagus, we have asparagus patch so, in fact right now it's, it's in
season so we just go out there and ((pull)) a few, and then whatever you want
for desert. 

B.38:  Well, I'll give you one tha-, tha-, that I, I put together modified out of
a HEART SMART COOKBOOK.  Now, my husband really thinks that this is one of
those Fren-, fancy french sauces.

A.39:  Oh [laughter]. 

B.40:  So, when he [laughter], when he request this I always tell him he has to
take the kids for an hour.  And it really only takes about fifteen or twenty
minutes to do [laughter]  but it gives me forty-five minutes to sit by myself
where it's quiet. 

A.41:  That's nice. 

B.42:  But what you do is you go take, you can use pork tender loin it's more
expensive but I, and I like the leaner cut of pork. 

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  The, um, like the center cut pork chops,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # and # you, you need to have them thick at least a three-quarters of an
inch think,

A.47:  # Okay.  #

B.48:  # and # all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper
marinade. 

A.49:  Okay. 

B.50:  On both sides. 

A.51:  Um, when you say lemon pepper marinade, you put lemon juice and pepper
together. 

B.52:  No, just the, uh,

A.53:  # The spice that you buy.  #

B.54:  # the, you know, you can # do that, just that you buy. 

A.55:  Okay. 

B.56:  Just lemon pepper. 

A.57:  All right. 

B.58:  And then you take about two tablespoons of butter, which, you know most
people kind of go (( )), you know, this is a low fat recipe,

A.59:  # Oh yeah [laughter].  #

B.60:  # but it is, # and you just melt that in a skillet. 

A.61:  Okay. 

B.62:  You broken the, uh, the pork chops,

A.63:  # Okay.  #

B.64:  # or # the pork fillets,

A.65:  Uh-huh. 

B.66:  You just brown them on both sides and I like to get them at a good golden
brown,

A.67:  # Yes.  #

B.68:  # and # then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm,
and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon, about anywhere from a
quarter to a half a cup.  To that you add two tablespoons of worcestershire
sauce,

A.69:  # Two.  #

B.70:  # [Laughter] # and one teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you
like it. 

A.71:  Two tablespoons,

B.72:  # Uh.  #

A.73:  # wai-, # wait a minute, that was two tablespoons of worcestershire?

B.74:  Yeah, worcestershire. 

A.75:  Okay. 

B.76:  And then anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  And
what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a, a really pretty almost
dark black drown ((vodkas)) sauce. 

A.77:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.78:  # it's # pretty spicy, now, I like to throw in just a, you know, a shot of
white wine.  And then you just take the pork chops put them on a serving
platter, pour this sauce over it and I garnish it with fresh cut chives.  It
really is a really pretty entree to look at. 

A.79:  Um. 

B.80:  Uh-huh, and the sauce, I mean it has kind of this nice complex flavor where
you feel that somebody's, you know, played around with this all afternoon. 

A.81:  Yeah, tha-,

B.82:  And I have served it to company.  And,

A.83:  So, so you cooked the, the pork is cooked at that point then. 

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  Okay. 

B.86:  But, you know, the trick with pork, most people think you have to cook it
at a hundred and eighty-five degrees, well done.

A.87:  Oh, no. 

B.88:  You don't have to do that. 

A.89:  No. 

B.90:  It can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of
difference. 

A.91:  Oh (( )), um,

B.92:  The other thing that, that I've really got into down here in Texas is
fresh, uh, herbs.

A.93:  That's what we do, we, we grow our own. 

B.94:  Oh, yeah. 

A.95:  And dry them and, um,

B.96:  Well, see I don't have to try them cause they'll, they'll pretty much grow
all winter long.  And if,

A.97:  Yeah, you guys are kind of lucky down there. 

B.98:  Oh, I don't know we also have, you know, foot long roaches all,

A.99:  # [Laughter].  #

B.100:  # year # long too. 

A.101:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.102:  [Laughter]  Hey, don't laugh,

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  Don't laugh, but what makes a really elegant, um, just a side dish, and
most people don't have any idea what it is, why they don't, I don't know, and
you can make it a day ahead of time, cause I just take about a cup of fresh
cut basil, I mean I really like basil.

A.105:  Yes. 

B.106:  And then cook spaghetti, and I th-, th-, this is smaller thread spaghetti
it's like the cappelletti --

A.107:  Okay, yep. 

B.108:  -- is the better.  Add, and I add almost I equal parts parmesan cheese a, a
healthy balance of garlic, I mean I really like garlic. 

A.109:  Oh, that's what we do, we, yeah. 

B.110:  Yeah, so you're basically makes a kind of a, a ((pastel)),

A.111:  Like a ((pastel)) yeah. 

B.112:  Yes, but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful,

A.113:  So is it a cup of basil leave, fresh basil leaves?

B.114:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And pine nuts and if you can't get pine nuts cause to me
they're always kind of mushy, I just grind up walnuts and use that in it. 

A.115:  Uh. 

B.116:  It really is nice. 

A.117:  Yeah.  That's, uh,

B.118:  And even my kids will eat it.  And they've gotten to be kind of food snobs.
One of them went over to,

A.119:  We're going, we're going to have that Friday.  We're going to do the pork
and we don't have the, we don't have any fresh basil, but we've got dried, well
we'll have to go down to the market. 

B.120:  Dry basil doesn't have,

A.121:  # It doesn't, you can't ((pastel)) frozen,#

B.122:  # quite the taste.  #

A.123:  yeah it makes it, we've get rows. 

B.124:  Yeah, I keep, I do that and I find that it tastes just about as good and I
freeze it in like little half cup quantity so I can even pull,

A.125:  # [Cough].  #

B.126:  # it # out whenever I want to. 

A.127:  But I like that, I like those, uh-huh, I like that sauce with the pork. 

B.128:  You, you'll be surprised, you'll be really surprised at just how simple it
is and, and it's not a, a clear cut, you know, this, this, this, and this, it's
kind of to taste. 

A.129:  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, cause we each take turns doing it, you
know.  I usually do the grill work and, you know, it depends if she makes, uh,
uh, anything with shrimp on it or not, you know, she'll do that, but I'll do
the grill stuff but, this is nice, this is, I can cook the pork on the grill.

B.130:  Uh-huh. 

A.131:  And just make the sauce. 

B.132:  You know what also is really good, just really, really good and really,
really simple if you like to do grilling.  If you can get a hold of fresh
sage.

A.133:  Yep. 

B.134:  Have you ever worked with that?

A.135:  Yep. 

B.136:  Just take the fresh sage and, and, you know, like crumble it so that you,
you release the oils. 

A.137:  Yep. 

B.138:  Pour, you know, put that stuff over fresh pork chops and if you've got
((balsamic)) vinegar there?

A.139:  We do. 

B.140:  Oh I love,

A.141:  # We make all of our vinegars,#

B.142:  # that stuff.  #

A.143:  in fact we do canning too, we,

B.144:  # Oh.  #

A.145:  # do # all of our own canning and [laughter]. 

B.146:  I do my own vinegars too, but just put a, a touch of ((balsamic)) vinegar
on that until.
