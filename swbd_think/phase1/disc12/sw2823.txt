@A.1:  Okay.  Uh, do you have a budget?

B.2:  We sure do, as a matter of fact, I do the finances in the family and what I
do is take, uh, entire take home pay and then I like divvy it up into sections,
into the house, into the car, into the utiliti-, anything that's to do with the
house like utilities, or electric or anything like that, goes into the house
budget.  And then I have one for the food, and one for, um, an, and each of
these is allotted a certain amount of money and hopefully, we stay within that
budget.  And then, uh, we have some for, uh, debt, and some for just plain
family, you know, like if the kids need clothes, or if, uh, oh, I don't know,
you know, if som-, something in the h-, well the house one gets the money for
the budget if we need something new in the house,

A.3:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.4:  # or # something like that.  So that's pretty much how we do it. 

A.5:  D-, is it, I mean does it work pretty good, I mean yo-, are you able to
stay on track,

B.6:  # Yeah.  #

A.7:  # pretty # much. 

B.8:  Uh-huh, it does.  Uh, now the way that we can really get off track is if I
start to pull money from something and put it into another, into another
budget. 

A.9:  # Um.  #

B.10:  # Like # if I have money put into the house budget and all the bills that
go with that and I start sof-, siphoning money out of that like into the food
bill, budget,

A.11:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.12:  # um, # to buy more food, and I don't do that usually but when it does
happen then I get into problems with, you know, then I have to take money from
somewhere else to pay the bills on the house.  And I don't like to do that. 
Then you can get really into trouble.  And that doesn't happen very often
because I'm pretty strict, I don't usually take money from anywhere,

A.13:  # Yeah, we don't, #

B.14:  # unless I absolutely # have to. 

A.15:  we don't really have a budget per se, we pretty much know what our bills
are,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # and, # you know, ours, ours is pretty simple, but, uh, but w-, I do have,
I do have, we do have a plan where we do put X number of dollars away,

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # every # month.  Both through the employment, uh, sectors and also
privately,

B.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.21:  # in, # in an investment portfolio. 

B.22:  Well that's great. 

A.23:  So that goes, uh, we take that out right off the top. 

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # Of # course the employment comes out before you ever see it, but then the
other stuff, the private stuff, we take out and then we disburse it into
those, uh, accounts before we even start the rest.  Uh, but on the budget we,
of course, we haven't really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet.
I can see, definitely see that there is a need for one though.  And probably,
as my daughter gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in, in
other major purchases and things like that, we'll have to do that.

B.26:  Yeah, uh, it's, it's kind of a good thing with my husband's company, we can
allot a certain amount of money and all of our, we have four children,

A.27:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.28:  # each # of our children have a savings account.  And then there's a basic
savings account like a family one. 

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # And # what the, his, um, company does for us is, we allot a certain
amount and like you said, uh, they ta-, they just take that straight out of
the paycheck and put it right in the savings account.  We don't even see that,
uh, money.  But we can take it, I mean, it's w-, available to us if we want to
take it out but, uh, we just try not to touch that.

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  But, you know, and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget. 
We just try to put that right away in savings.  It's very difficult sometimes
to, to not think and say, well God, we have a little bit in savings, let's
[laughter], you know. 

A.33:  # Yeah.  #

B.34:  # But # you have to be quite, um, adamant, and say you're not going to
touch that, so.

A.35:  Yeah we, we have a, we have one savings account that we have jointly,

B.36:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # that # we can take out of if we, if we decide we want something. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  But that's the only one we touch.  Everything else, we have, we have
promised each other we will not touch anything else. 

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # In # fact like C D -s and money markets and all that kind of stuff, we've
got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it --

B.42:  I think that's great. 

A.43:  -- so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that, you
know,

B.44:  # Yeah.  #

A.45:  # say, # well, you know, we won't miss this, or we won't miss that, you
know.  Uh, so, our, our investment portion of it we don-, we don't even touch
it.  If we get low on money, or we, we go other avenues,

B.46:  # Right.  #

A.47:  # we # don't, we don't ever touch that, so. 

B.48:  Yeah, we don't touch the kids, we do have this joint one,

A.49:  # [Throat_clearing]  [Talking]  {voices in background}. #

B.50:  # like you said, and we # do fluctuate money in that one, if we want to and
then there's one other thing that we have and, and we don't touch the money in
that one, so. 

A.51:  Yeah, we do the same for our daughter, we have, uh, of course when she was
born we just took, you know, a lump sum of money and put it in a C D,

B.52:  # Uh-huh, that's really good.  #

A.53:  # as one, one means, # and then we took, I take a hundred dollar savings
bond out of every paycheck. 

B.54:  # That's good.  #

A.55:  # That's, goes # directly for, for her.  And then we also have a savings
account which we do put X number of dollars in per month which is able to at
least build her education fund [/talking].

B.56:  You know, and that's so important because today things can be so expensive,
they really can. 

A.57:  Well if you, if you really look at it, the kids that are, are born today,
by the time it's college time, which will be, it will be cost prohibitive if,
if parents don't do it.

B.58:  That's right, exactly. 

A.59:  Kids cannot make money that much money in, in that time frame, uh, working
odd jobs to pay for that kind of bill. 

B.60:  It's just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when, when we went to
school. 

A.61:  Yeah, an, and there, I don't think there's a lot of opportunity, uh, in the
future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because I don't, I just
don't think it's going to be there.

B.62:  Yeah, it's too hard. 

A.63:  So I think, if the parents don't provide, it's, it's not going to be there.

B.64:  That's right, that's right. 

A.65:  And, uh, who knows how much that's going to take, I mean what we're taking
out now may be enough, it may not be. 

B.66:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

A.67:  And, uh, just don't know, or there may be far more there than is ever
needed, but if it's, if it's extra, then she can go to dental school or any,

B.68:  # Wouldn't that be great? #

A.69:  # anything else that she # wants to do from, from there, so. 

B.70:  Yeah, I think th-, all of those things are really important and, and, uh,
the only reason I even went to a budget was I found that we, um, we would, oh,
I can't think of the word, like, {pause} s-, or money would go through the
cracks, you know, and at the end of the thing we'd go, what happened to all
that money, the extra we had.  The overflow, you know.

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  And it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air [laughter].  And so,

A.73:  We-, you know, I, I you brought up a real good point, because I, because I
notice we do that occasionally, we'll get it, we'll get down and think where
does all this go. 

B.74:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.75:  # We just # went out on a f-, on a f-, you know, like a frivolous spending
binge all of a sudden, you know, now where did it go. 

B.76:  It's hard to keep track isn't it. 

A.77:  It is, uh, uh, because I know we, we have gotten ourselves into that
predicament a few times. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  But we've always managed, you know, to, you know, to get out of it fairly
quickly. 

B.80:  Right, right,

A.81:  We don't have a lot charged up on credit cards, we don't have,

B.82:  # I think that's great.  #

A.83:  # you know, a lot # of money going out, uh, than what we can pay for, but I
think if you do have a budget at least then, maybe you'll have extra money,
sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a
little bit more important. 

B.84:  Yeah.  I didn't used to have, uh, a money allotted out for debt service
until, um, I just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems
and [laughter] and,

A.85:  # [Phone_ringing].  #

B.86:  # the, # the specialists and the hospitals that she had to have, you know,
uh, she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in
those, I found I had to make that into the budget to start paying those off. 
And th-, I mean the insurance,

A.87:  Oh isn't that something. 

B.88:  Pardon. 

A.89:  I say isn't that something about medical bills, golly. 

B.90:  Yeah. 

A.91:  I know just one little, one little hiccup --

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  -- will just about devastate you on,

B.94:  Our insurance was wonderful but it didn't cover everything, you know, and
so, ye-, find you have to, um, [dishes] do some of those things and, and when
money is involved it can really get expensive. 

A.95:  Um. 

B.96:  So, anyway, that's about how we handle our finances an, and, uh, that seems
to work pretty well for us. 

A.97:  Yeah, I keep pretty extensive records on, on, you know, what I do and I
average out, you know, utilities and things like that.  I, I project ahead.  I
usually at the end of the month when I, when I pay the bills, I'll usually
project what I'm going to need for next month, but I don't really put it aside,
I just, you know,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # I # just try to estimate what I think it's going to come to and then,

B.100:  Well see even that I think is a sort of, uh, a budget, uh, when you do
that. 

A.101:  In some basic sense. 

B.102:  Right, right. 

A.103:  But I think a planned budget, I think is, is a real good idea.  So you just
break it down in little subgroups and then you have X number of dollars, what
you think is adequate to pay those bills. 

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  Now do you save all your receipts?

B.106:  I do, we used to.  It got to be a great big hassle, great big mess and I, I
just don't do that so what I have is, uh, a paper and, uh, and I put two
columns, my husband on one side and me on the other side, uh, we pay for check
or else we take out of A T M services, you know, a certain amount of money and
I write every check down for the amount of money, or whoever takes money out
of the A T M, I write down that amount of money.  And as it comes through, uh,
o-, on the statement, then I'll br-, block it off in, in a bright color so we
know it's gone and I can see what's left out and what's left over to come
through the statement.  An to make sure,

A.107:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.108:  # that # we don't overdraw ourselves or anything.  But, uh, that's the way
I do it, uh, receipts were a big mess for me, I can't do that.  That was just,
uh, too much.

A.109:  Boy I know with that you receipts for everything. 

B.110:  Yeah, I couldn't do that, so. 

A.111:  Are y-, are you like a coupon saver, too, for stores and things?

B.112:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah. 

A.113:  You know, I've, I've noticed that's a big deal.  I, I have, I save m-,
every coupon I get my hands on.

B.114:  I just, uh, they are such a boon to, of housewives, I know I (( )).

A.115:  Hey, I mean, I know it's, it's easy to get hooked on that stuff, because,
I, I,
