==============================================================================

A.1:  Do you consider your company's benefits to be reasonably good?

B.2:  Uh, reasonable, uh, the company I work for is T I. 

A.3:  Okay, yeah, I work at Texas Instruments also. 

B.4:  Uh, so, uh, I think T I, uh, likes to live in the middle of the road. 

A.5:  [Laughter] I've found that to be true. 

B.6:  Yeah, uh. 

A.7:  They're getting better, but, uh, there's room for improvement. 

B.8:  Yeah, well, I, I, [talking]  I'm serious, I think they really do, uh, if
they can stay about mid way between the, the companies who have excellent
whatever, and, uh, and the ones who have very poor whatever, that's where they
want to be.  Right about the middle of the road [TV]. 

A.9:  Yeah, well I'll have to agree with that, uh, if, if you, uh, if your
benefits isn't as good, you're going to drive people away, but, uh, it seems
they're making an effort to, to, uh, be better, uh, each year. 

B.10:  Yeah.  And there's no reason to, I don't think they consider it to be any,
uh, particular reason to go out and have the very best in the industry. 

A.11:  No that's true. 

B.12:  All they want to do is make it acceptable which, uh, probably from a
business standpoint is, is what you want to do, I guess. 

A.13:  Yeah, well it's necessary to be competitive.  When I started work th-, they
didn't have, uh, a dental plan. 

B.14:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

A.15:  And so, you're on our own,

B.16:  # Yeah.  #

A.17:  # but, # uh, that's improved, uh, immensely.  It still may not be
competitive with other companies of our size, but, uh, it's better than nothing
right now. 

B.18:  # Yeah that's true, #

A.19:  # It's got limitations.  #

B.20:  I'm, I have, I have used the dental plan several times for myself and also
my family, so, you know, I'm glad to have it. 

A.21:  Right. 

B.22:  But, uh, uh, I was there also before the dental plan was in place and, and
we, we stayed on our, our personnel people at the plant, uh, continuously for,
for years literally, I mean trying to, to get a dental plan in place because
it, it had, it had started becoming a thing that a lot of major companies were
doing, getting dental plans and it took us a l-, a long time, well I mean, we
didn't have anything directly to do with it, I'm sure, but, you know, we had
talked about it and we were aware of it for a long time before T I finally,
[laughter] got on the bandwagon, I guess.

A.23:  Right.  I think, uh, other improvements could be made, say in the medical
plan as well. 

B.24:  # Yeah, the medical [laughter].  #

A.25:  # We really don't, we # really don't do a great deal for, uh, preventive
care. 

B.26:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.27:  # They don't # offer, uh, say, uh, physicals every few years. 

B.28:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

A.29:  Something like that, uh, if they could cover that it would be, uh, most
beneficial, I think. 

B.30:  I, I think they're, they're finally heading that direction.  Uh, you know,
because they now have some, some cancer screening tests,

A.31:  # Right.  #

B.32:  # that # they will pay for, so,

A.33:  # Well you see something.  #

B.34:  # they've also got the, # you know, prene-, preventative, uh, the well baby
stuff. 

A.35:  Right. 

B.36:  Which is good. 

A.37:  Well you'll see plans every now and then through Texins organization where
they've got, uh,

B.38:  # Uh-huh, yeah.  #

A.39:  # the type # of screening you're talking about, other, uh, uh, types of
preventive care. 

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  But, uh, as far as, uh, it being a regular part of the, the benefits plan,
uh, I haven't seen that yet. 

B.42:  Yeah, uh, no, it's, well, like I say it, it's slowly coming.  Uh, it's, I
guess it's just, you know, with insurance rates and medical costs being what
they are, I guess it's, you know, I re-, I guess they're really trying to, to
hold the costs down. 

A.43:  Right now in particular. 

B.44:  Yeah, but it's, it sure is hard becau-, I mean it's hard on the employee
because, you know, the, the cost are going up and the benefits are coming
down, you know, they, true they may be coming down at a slower rate because of
the cost managements things that they're doing, but, you know, the benefits
are coming down.

A.45:  Getting away from, uh, medical benefits, one of the best things I see is
the CODA plan,

B.46:  # Oh yeah, now I, #

A.47:  # where there's a matched # savings contribution. 

B.48:  yeah, and I love the CODA plan, I, [laughter]  I haven't yet figured what
the, uh, exactly what the, uh, catch is but I,

A.49:  Well there's, there's no catch, the, the, you, you contribute, uh, uh, a
fixed percent, or as much as, I guess up to fifteen percent of your salary,

B.50:  # Oh yeah.  #

A.51:  # and T # I will match that up to two percent. 

B.52:  Yeah, yeah, well I participate, uh, you know, I've I have participated
since they installed the plan.

A.53:  # Right.  #

B.54:  # But, # [laughter]  for a long time I was leery about, you know, I just
couldn't figure out, well what's the deal, you know, why is the company doing
that. 

A.55:  The only catch is, [laughter]  you can't get a hold of the money. 

B.56:  # Yeah, that's right, yeah [child_talking].  #

A.57:  # Unless you, uh, quit, or # terminate, or retire. 

B.58:  Uh-huh, yeah and I guess, I guess in a way that is the catch, you know, for
the employee, but it's also the benefit for the company because they have, uh,
an amount of money there, that, that I suppose that they invest.  I don't know
exactly what they do with that money. 

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  But I'm sure they invest it some way, and I'm sure they're making money off
of it. 

A.61:  Oh, sure, well it's meant to be a long term savings plan, like an I R A. 

B.62:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, it's, it's great, I, like I say, I use it and I'm, I'm
glad they came up with it. 

A.63:  You get the benefit that the money comes out of pretax dollars, they aren't
taxing it right away and,

B.64:  # Uh-huh, yeah.  #

A.65:  # and, uh, # it's all tax deferred, uh, as well. 

B.66:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the, T I does have some good benefits but like I say, I, I
really do believe that they strive just to kind of stay in the middle of the
road (( )).

A.67:  Sure, I'd like to see something like a cafeteria plan, where you only have
to pay for the benefits that you use yourself.  Instead of having to pay for
benefits that other people use, uh, it gets subsidized by everybody's, uh,
contribution. 

B.68:  Well, [throat_clearing]  yeah, I guess, I guess in a way they're, they're,
are, they really are starting that now, with the, uh, the smoker premiums that
they're going to be starting. 

A.69:  I didn't think about that, you're right, that's true. 

B.70:  So that's, you know, in a way, and, uh, I'm just wondering, you know, how
far it will go over the years. 

A.71:  # Sure.  #

B.72:  # You # know, will, will they single out people who are susceptible to
heart disease, or overweight or, or any other, you know, recognizable high
risk, I guess.

A.73:  Yeah, you have to wonder, [laughter]  but,

B.74:  You know, that's, I guess that's, I guess that's the way it should be.  I,
I'm not sure.  It, it's different from the way it has been [child_talking]. 

A.75:  I just wonder how they would enforce something like that with the smoker
policy. 

B.76:  I don't know, I'm, I've wondered that myself.  I'm not a smoker so it's,
it's not going to affect me or my family but, I, you know, we, we've talked
about it at work and wonder about that. 

A.77:  # Yeah.  #

B.78:  # I # guess you're just, strictly on your honor, I guess. 

A.79:  Well I sure made sure that I got that, uh, form filled out as soon as
possible and turned in. 

B.80:  Oh, yeah, I did too. 

A.81:  Because if you don't they'll, uh, raise your rates by ten dollars a month,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # up # to a maximum of thirty dollars. 

B.84:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.85:  People who neglect to do that are going to pay for it. 

B.86:  Well in a way I feel like, uh, you know, the smokers should have to do
that. 

A.87:  # Sure.  #

B.88:  # You # know, because they are bringing it on themselves, even, even though
it is a habit that a lot of them, you know, may have a problem quitting, you
know, T I has seemingly bent over backwards to help them quit,

A.89:  # Sure.  #

B.90:  # with # the stop smoking programs. 

A.91:  I've heard that, the, the smoking cessation plans are very good here. 

B.92:  Yeah, well like I say, since I'm not a smoker, I really don't know, uh,
there, there are quite a few guys in, in my, I work in a lab environment and
there are quite a few guys in there who at one time did smoke, and, uh, as a
matter of fact, all of them have quit, but they've all done it on their own.
None of them enrolled in any kind of program, they just, I guess, just looked
at the cold hard facts and just quit cold turkey.

A.93:  That's, that's very good.  I understand that when they first developed the
nonsmoking policy, uh, the clean air policy as they call it, that over two
thousand people signed up for the smoking cessation classes the first year. 

B.94:  I, I wouldn't be surprised.  Uh, I never had heard a number of how many
actually signed up, but I, I do know that they were trying to get people to do
it, uh, you know, which is good, because it is, uh, I guess more of a hardship
on people who, you know, who are, have been used to smoking in their work area,
just, you know, light one up whenever they want to.  Now they've got to get up
and go to a designated area. 

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  But that's, uh, times are changing, you know, as, it has, it's different
now than what it was fifteen, twenty years ago, in, in, in the benefits and
insurance and the whole works.

A.97:  Are there any benefits that you're still dissatisfied with, that, uh, could
use more improvement?

B.98:  Oh, retirement, I mean I'm,

A.99:  [Laughter]  Yeah, I'm not looking towards quite yet, but, uh, you're,
right. 

B.100:  Yeah, well I'm, I'm still a long way off, but, uh, you know, the retirement
and profit sharing.  The profit sharing is really a sore spot with me.
Because about the time that I hired in was, ab-, about two years after I hired
on was about the time that the, uh, the profit sharing plan changed over.  We
went from the old plan to the new plan.

A.101:  About nineteen seventy-two. 

B.102:  Yeah and,

A.103:  I started in seventy-eight. 

B.104:  Oh yeah, so you're, you never were familiar with the old plan --

A.105:  No. 

B.106:  -- I don't guess.  Well I, you know, I never participated in, you know, in
the old plan because I, uh, didn't have enough vesting, but, uh, I worked with
a lot of old guys who really, really got, [laughter] were disappointed a-,
after the new plan had been in place for a few years.

A.107:  Sure. 

B.108:  They said it just was nothing like the old plan, so [talking], 

A.109:  Yeah, well if you look at the lump sum that you would get from, uh, say
quitting right now, terminating.  It's hardly worth having a pension plan. 

B.110:  It really is, it, it's, it,

A.111:  You can't live on it [laughter]. 

B.112:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy. 

A.113:  And profit sharing is something we don't have a lot of control over. 

B.114:  # Well.  #

A.115:  # But # it seems that the company is going out of their way to not give us
profit sharing. 

B.116:  [Laughter]  Yeah, that's [throat_clearing]  that's kind of a --

A.117:  We, we keep spending more money on, uh, on property and facilities. 

B.118:  -- [Throat_clearing]  Uh-huh, uh, that's, that's kind of a standing joke,
that, uh, anytime you see any big projects coming up, you say, well, it must be
getting close to time to figure profit sharing. 

A.119:  That's right, I think in my thirteen years I've had four years of profit
sharing. 

B.120:  Uh-huh, yeah, it's, it's, well like I say, your account, even if you don't
draw anything out of it, is, is just not even hardly worth the effort
[talking]. 

A.121:  That's why I participate so heavily in the CODA plan, um. 

B.122:  Yeah, I'm, I'm likewise, uh, you know, I, I think basically T I has without
saying it, is trying to tell you that hey, we're not going to, or not going to
be able to take care of you at retirement so, we're going to help you do what
you can for yourself. 

A.123:  Right. 

B.124:  And you better take advantage of it if you want something, to, to look at. 

A.125:  Well I think that's the right attitude for a company like this to have in
order to survive.  But a lot of people aren't getting the message and they
don't have any type of savings plan established.

B.126:  Yeah I, I would hope, uh, well you know, it is kind of rough on the people
who, uh,
