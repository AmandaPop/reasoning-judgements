=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Perhaps, uh, maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at
something broader, you know, nationwide, worldwide, or something, maybe we
should look city wide,

A.3:  Okay.

B.4:  you know, or school board wide, or you know what I'm saying, 

A.5:  Oh.

B.6:  narrow the topic a little and see if, if we don't uh, recognize some
trends there.

A.7:  Okay, okay.

B.8:  Um, one thing that I definitely have noticed in our area as far as the
school system, at least, uh, token wise [laughter],

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  I'm not sure that, uh, really truly, uh, uh, we're effectively counting,
but, at, at least for a show, we're involving more parents in input and,

A.11:  More parent input.

B.12:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Um, like I say, this all may be in name only, kind of
thing at this point,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  But at least it's a step in the right direction I think.

A.15:  Well do you have school age children?

B.16:  I have five school age children.

A.17:  Oh, so you're, you're definitely more involved, at least in the schools,
school system.  My children are grown, so.

B.18:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.19:  So.

B.20:  Well, we, uh, we try to keep abreast of it, uh, of some of the things that
are, that are going on, and we've, uh, we've just gone through ci-, city
elections here in, in Plano, for our city council.  

A.21:  For city council, do you all have a mayor or,  

B.22:  Yes.

A.23:  You do?

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  We-, yeah, we, we do in Houston, too.

B.26:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, Whitmire, is, is she still the,

A.27:  Yeah, yeah, she's still, she's still there but it looks like, uh, she may
have some, the opposition, or they're, they're trying to beat them.  She's
been in for so long, so we may hear some interesting things about her before
election time comes up,

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  this time, but she's, uh, uh, okay, I don't know, is wo-, would a trend,
does it seem to be we're having more minority type people, women in
government,

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  as far as in the local, like our ci-, our, our, our, our chief of police
is a woman, our, our mayor is a woman, our s-, superintendent of, of schools
was a woman, she's just now, you know, been pushed out.

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.33:  But I don't know if you would consider that a trend or not.

B.34:  Oh, I definitely think it's a trend, uh, you know, this morning on the way
to school, we just, uh, it just so happened that we saw a lot of buses and I
usually don't have all my children in the b-, in the car at once, but I'd
taken them all to the chiropractor this morning,

A.35:  You di-,

B.36:  One big fell swoop and then we were going on to school, but just a tad
late, long enough for the buses to be going back and, the kids said, gosh,
look how many of these bus drivers are women.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And I said, you know, that really is a good indication of some of the jobs
that have been, you know, that trend that has swung,

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  you know, one profession that, 

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  you know, there are a lot of women now, and I think it's good because
those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and might, you
know, be aware of those things coming or going from school where maybe the men
don't always, you know, they're just there to drive the bus, you know,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  and the women are more,

A.45:  Well I saw, uh, the, the superintendent that we've had was being considered
for the superintendent in the Boston area.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And they just, she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area, like
assistants, somebody who's an, one of the assistants, in your, 

B.48:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.49:  I'm not sure what the name, maybe it was another woman, so.

B.50:  Must have been from, uh, D I S D.  

A.51:  Maybe so, yeah, maybe so.

B.52:  But I definitely think, think that administratively in the schools women
are, are a show of force now that we did not see even, five years ago.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Certainly not, you know, ten years ago.  Up to that point they were
allowed to be teachers, secretaries, nurses, so forth.  Even, your, uh, heads
of, uh, you know like your food services.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  That kind of thing.  Your, your deans, you know, they weren't women, um,
you know that's,

A.57:  Lots of school principals seem to be women.  

B.58:  Yes.

A.59:  In the, at least in the Houston area.  I've noticed, o-, over the years
that my kids were in school.

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, more and more.

A.61:  In fact, in fact I don't even remember any, uh, school that they went to
that there, there wasn't a women principal, from elementary school on up.

B.62:  On.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Oh that's excellent, excellent, 

A.65:  So.

B.66:  you know, that they're getting a chance.

A.67:  Yeah, but, but then again, you know, it would be nice to have more, you
know, the majority of teachers seem to be women, it would be nice to have, but
the problem is, the pay scale.  Probably it's because, you know, women go into
teaching probably, not so much for the money, but, uh, for the satisfaction
and that's just what they want to, 

B.68:  The type of, uh,

A.69:  want to do, whereas, uh, I think if you're a college professor, probably
the pay is much better.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And you tend to see more, I think you see more, well I don't know, it
seems like there, there are a lot of, a lot more men at least in the, the
college level, so.

B.72:  Well and that comes once again, you know, is that you can teach in
elementary school, you can even substitute, in elementary school in the state
of Texas without a, uh, without a certificate. 

A.73:  You can teach?

B.74:  Yes, you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree.

A.75:  Substitute, right.  

B.76:  And then, you know, work on that, and if you want to work on up, but you
still can make good money, you know, part-time, part-time money.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  As a substitute, whereas, you know, to teach on college level you have to
have a P H D almost always, sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program
or something where you might be teaching, but.

A.79:  And do you have any idea how much, uh, uh, a substitute teacher would make
per day?  I'm sure they pay them by the day.

B.80:  Uh-huh, here in Plano they pay about fifty dollars a day.

A.81:  Well, I mean that's good part-time money,

B.82:  That's good part-time money for,

A.83:  yeah but it's not,

B.84:  but it's not career money.

A.85:  No.

B.86:  You know, but it, uh, for a part-time situation.  

A.87:  Course it, you know, ju-, uh-huh, someb-, 

B.88:  And once you've gotten your foot in the door for several years
substituting and then take on a degree, 

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  you know, you're pretty well assured of a, of a job in the system
eventually.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  That, you know, that you've been subbing in.  A lot of times, you know, I
think that's uh.  I think, uh, one thing, that, uh, that we're seeing, you
know, a trend in, uh, politics is that our cities are taking a lot more
responsibility for, uh, citizens becoming involved in the environment, uh.

A.93:  This is true.

B.94:  Recycling, uh, clean up programs, re, uh, furbishing, you know, historical
and, and, uh, park land.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  Um, {pause} your, uh, city, you know, where they, they adopt a highway
kinds of things.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  Those are becoming more and more government, uh, originated and not just
private enterprise --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- you know, generated.

A.101:  Which I think is something that has to happen in order to, to,

B.102:  To make people do it, probably.

A.103:  to make it happen right.

B.104:  Which, you know, I thought Texas would be the last place to ever, um, get
people to do those things voluntarily and I think their don't mess with Texas
campaign has been very effective, because Texans don't like to be told what to
do, they're very proud of their state, so they've, psychologically they've
done a number on us there.

A.105:  Well a couple weeks ago, I was at the Houston International Festival,
which is you know, in the downtown area,

B.106:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.107:  and, uh, the friend, a friend of mine that was with me, uh, commented on,
on how clean, you know, when you have an event like that, of course everybo-,
you know, there's just food and everything else, and of course they have the,
the, you know, the places to throw the stuff but you really, they were really
use, they really use it.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  And the, because in the past, you know, it seemed like, I can remember
people just, just throw it down, they don't care.  But you're, you're finally
getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place
to, to throw it.

B.110:  Uh-huh, uh-huh [chiming].

A.111:  Uh, ou-, can you remember driving down the highway, I could as a kid, you
know, you just get rid of it, you roll the window down, and you throw it out.
[laughter] But you would,

B.112:  Well my mother was always real picky about that kind of thing, I think I'd
probably have my fingers cut off if I'd ever thrown out a candy wrapper, or
anything, but.  

A.113:  Well you're probably younger than I am, 'cause I, you know, um, but I can
remember, uh, [noise] {made with mouth} proba-, probably, uh, in the early
seventies, uh, going out on, you know, taking our boat out and stuff like
that,

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at
that time, you know.

B.116:  Uh-huh, at that.

A.117:  So, it's, uh, yeah, it really hasn't been that long, I mean it's probably
twenty years or so, that, you know, it really began.  

B.118:  Yes, yes, I agree.

A.119:  So, yeah.

B.120:  For it to, and to be adopted and funded, you know, by cities.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  And you think the incredible amount of, you know, money that we vote for
our cities to spend on these kinds of things, so, 

A.123:  Uh-huh {very softly}.

B.124:  you know, it's definitely, uh, you know, you have to consider that a
political trend,

A.125:  Uh.

B.126:  because we're the ones voting for those people,
you know, to, that are in favor of those kinds of programs,

A.127:  That's true, that's true.

B.128:  and make them, you know, campaign issues, so.

A.129:  Uh-huh.  How about the representation that you have on the city council, is
it, uh, you know, we're, we're I think we're to vote going to have increased
the number so that we will be able to represent, uh, like the Mexican
Americans don't feel like they've had enough representation,

B.130:  Uh-huh.  Well of course, Dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the
fourteen one and ten four one, you know, programs and it's, you know, going
back and forth between courts to, you know.

A.131:  What is that, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to be, plead ignorant here.

B.132:  Um the, um,
