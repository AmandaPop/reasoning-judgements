A.1:  [Beep] Okay, uh, have you, did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?

B.2:  Uh, no I've only been here for the last ten years, uh,

A.3:  Oh, where are you from?

B.4:  I grew up most of my childhood in Germany. 

A.5:  In Germany. 

B.6:  Uh, and,

A.7:  # Well, #

B.8:  # we, # we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything
was within driving distance. 

A.9:  Now there's a place I'd like to visit [laughter]. 

B.10:  So we, we travelled all over Europe. 

A.11:  Oh, that's neat. 

B.12:  When I was, when I was very young.  Unfortunately, a, a little bit too
young to really appreciate.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  Uh, I was grade school age.  Uh,

A.15:  My hus-, my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe, or took a bicycle tour
about five months right after the second world war and so we've seen lots of
pictures of the, of the beautiful,

B.16:  # Um.  #

A.17:  # spots # and,

B.18:  # That, #

A.19:  # areas, # y-,

B.20:  that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation --

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  -- because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, uh,
I, I sure would work on it [laughter], 

A.23:  # [Laughter].  #

B.24:  # if # I had an opportunity like that. 

A.25:  Yeah, that's neat, neat [breathing].  What kind of vacations do you like?

B.26:  Uh, well my husband and I are scuba divers. 

A.27:  Oh.  H-,

B.28:  So, we both like to go to dive resorts.  Uh, we went to Hawaii on our
honeymoon,

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # and # we dove there.  Uh, but, we, we did about six dives while we were
there.  And, uh, we were originally planning on going to Cayman,

A.31:  # Oh, uh-huh.  #

B.32:  # uh, last # year --

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  -- uh, but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.  We
had to have, like, eleven people for,

A.35:  # Oh, uh-huh.  #

B.36:  # this package, # uh, deal. 

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go, so it ended up
falling a-, falling through. 

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  We were going to get a really good price. 

A.41:  When, when our children were younger, we enjoyed, we lived up in, uh, New
York,

B.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.43:  # or # New Jersey and, and used to like, uh, traveling into upstate New
York and camping --

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  -- and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and, that
sort of thing, but we've never really, uh, did any diving or anything.  Little
bit of s-, of, uh, uh, [lipsmack], oh,

B.46:  # Snorkeling? #

A.47:  # s-, # water skiing. 

B.48:  Oh, really. 

A.49:  But, not much of, uh,

B.50:  # Um.  #

A.51:  # of # anything else.  Uh,

B.52:  Well, my husband and I both like water,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # so # any, any vacation that we go on is usually,

A.55:  # It's got to be the water.# 

B.56:  # involves, close to the ocean, #

A.57:  # Right.  #

B.58:  # or, # or something like that. 

A.59:  When, when we were in Jersey, we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot,
and really enjoyed that a lot.  It's really, they had,

B.60:  # Yeah, we, #

A.61:  # a really # nice beach areas there. 

B.62:  After we moved away from Germany, we moved to New Hampshire. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  And I lived there for seven years. 

A.65:  Oh, I see. 

B.66:  Uh,

A.67:  # That's a really pretty area, too.  #

B.68:  # and I really enjoyed that because, # you know, the mountains were real
close,

A.69:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.70:  # we # like the, we like the white mountains and,

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  Uh, unfortunately, I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there.
I went skiing once.

A.73:  Yeah, we loved the, we loved the, the New Jersey area, too, because the
[breathing]  the lakes were really pretty close, you know, you could,

B.74:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.75:  # you # could drive within twenty minutes to an hour [breathing]  and just
be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really, and
then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail, we did quite a bit of
hiking, which is kind of fun.  Are you a, you a hiker, or not?

B.76:  Uh,

A.77:  Not so much, huh?

B.78:  Not, not really so much.  If, if, if there was some place that, that we
went to where there was hiking involved, I, I would be you know, happy to go
hiking,

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.80:  # but # [breathing] we, we never have really planned a vacation around, uh,
places to go hiking.

A.81:  So your, your next, your plans are try to find someplace to s-, scuba dive.

B.82:  Yeah.  Our next vacation will, will be scuba diving, I'm sure. 

A.83:  You have any children?

B.84:  No, not yet. 

A.85:  Okay, then that's probably one of the reasons our, we had little children
all the time,

B.86:  # Yeah.  #

A.87:  # so # some of the things are not as, quite as, uh, # adaptable.  #

B.88:  # Yeah, # it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation,

A.89:  # Yeah, it is.  #

B.90:  # when you have, # have children. 

A.91:  You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they
will enjoy, too, and,

B.92:  # Yeah.  #

A.93:  # so, # I think, wha-,

B.94:  Yeah, and diving is something that, especially for small children, uh, I
think the, the minimum age for diving is,

A.95:  # Yeah.  #

B.96:  # is # probably, legal anyway, # would be probably about sixteen.  #

A.97:  # Eleven or twelve, I would # think, probably but, maybe fifteen even. 

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  I know that, uh, uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips
now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family.
You know, we go wherever somebody is,

B.100:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.101:  # that # we haven't seen for a while [laughter].  So that, that's kind of,
uh, we just came back from, uh, uh, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons
graduate,

B.102:  # Um.  #

A.103:  # from, # uh, with his Master's Degree in social work and so that was fun,
and, and the summer we have a, we have a, a reunion in, in Salt Lake area up by
Park Cities. 

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather
large reunion group that, uh, as we can get together so,

B.106:  That, that sounds like a lot of fun. 

A.107:  Ye-,

B.108:  Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too,

A.109:  # Yeah.  #

B.110:  # that # there were several hundred, uh, people and they all kind of met at
a central place.  I, I didn't go,

A.111:  # Um.  #

B.112:  # uh, # but it would have been nice.  It would have been a nice vacation. 

A.113:  We, we've tra-, we've moved around enough so that we now have people in
different parts of the country.  I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to
somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep
maybe, you know, like a,

B.114:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.115:  # a # small camper.  We've, we've travelled in a big one.  I hate them
[laughter]  because they're hard to jockey around, you know, but maybe a pickup
with the back on,

B.116:  Some-, or something like, uh, what's the, like the Volkswagen Vanagon. 

A.117:  Yeah. 

B.118:  I've heard is really nice. 

A.119:  So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes, but you wouldn't want to do it
all the time. 

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  Uh, we have enough friends here and there, I would just love to just drive
through the United States and stop and see people I know,

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  and visit for a day and then go on and, you know. 

B.124:  My dad has been talking for years about, uh, getting a fifth wheel --

A.125:  Uh-huh. 

B.126:  -- and just picking up, he's retired --

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  -- uh, he's in his sixties, and he, uh, would like to just get a fifth
wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of
weeks there,

A.129:  # Yeah.  #

B.130:  # and # just, you know, not,

A.131:  # Yeah.  #

B.132:  # be # settled anywhere,

A.133:  # Yeah, I think, #

B.134:  # just see, see # the rest of the country. 

A.135:  I think that would real, and I would like to maybe not take great long
trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is --

B.136:  Uh-huh. 

A.137:  -- and then just travel out for, like, maybe, oh, a month, maybe go,

B.138:  He, he does that quite a bit. 

A.139:  And,

B.140:  He, he hasn't lately, though, uh, because he's been ill,

A.141:  # Yeah.  #

B.142:  # uh, # but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and,
you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary.  I'm going here, here and here and
I'll be back in about two months [laughter].

A.143:  Yeah.  There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America, that's for
sure.  We've, I haven't been much to the south, I haven't been in, in Georgia
or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama.  I guess that's, those are the only
states I have not visited.  But, uh, up the coast, uh, at, uh, uh, in Maryland
and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some
Johnstown and, uh, in s-, in that area is just really neat, interesting things
to so, you know.

B.144:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.145:  # so, #

B.146:  Have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites?

A.147:  Yeah, we took a trip, uh, around to the, uh, Civil War battle grounds and
things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something,

B.148:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.149:  # I # believe it was.  Uh, had about three kids then I think, but that was
a really fun, interesting trip.  I [breathing] we, we read Bruce (( )) book
before we went, you know, and, so we were ready to look up the places we read
about.

B.150:  Yeah, I --

A.151:  It was really interesting. 

B.152:  -- I think right, right now while my husband and I don't have any kids
we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving
and,

A.153:  # Yeah.  #

B.154:  # and # adventurous types of things,

A.155:  # Yeah.  #

B.156:  # and # then when we-, eventually, when we have kids,

A.157:  Yeah. 

B.158:  Now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.  You know they
went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that. 

A.159:  Well, now, camping is fun with kids.  If you're,

B.160:  # Yeah.  #

A.161:  # you # know, once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones, but,
even, even some little ones do pretty good but,

B.162:  # Yeah.  #

A.163:  # but # when they get a little bigger so they can help, that, that's a fun
way to [breathing],  to, uh, cut costs and it's enjoyable, too.  Very restful. 
I mean I find,

B.164:  Yeah, I, I do enjoy camping. 

A.165:  Yeah, I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of [breathing] 
a change. 

B.166:  As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine [laughter]. 

A.167:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.168:  And electricity. 

A.169:  Well, I'm with you.  I need my creature comforts, too. 

B.170:  Yeah. 

A.171:  Well, it was great to talk to you. 

B.172:  It was nice talking to you, too, Beth. 

A.173:  Okay, see you later.  Bye-bye. 

B.174:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
