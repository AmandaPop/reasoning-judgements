===========================================================================

A.1: All right, uh, how long have they been recycling there in Virginia?
[Noise] [TV].

B.2:  Um, actually quite a, a, a while.  Um, I've lived here for six years and,
[clicking]  can you hold on just a second? [Laughter]. 

A.3:  Yeah, uh-huh [clicking]  {telephone} {long pause}.

B.4:  Hello. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  Oh, I'm sorry I must have got the other line cut off.  Uh, [clicking]  so,
they've been doing that it for a while now --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- and, uh, it, I live in an apartment --

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  -- and my ap-, [clicking] {phone} ((facilities)), there it is, hold on {Put
on hold}.

A.11:  Uh-huh {pause}. Hello. 

B.12:  [Clicking]  {phone}. Okay, sorry about that [laughter]. 

A.13:  Yeah, okay, you're okay,

B.14:  # Yeah.  #

A.15:  # okay # [laughter]. 

B.16:  Uh, anyhow, they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling
paper only.  Uh, I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and, at
ano-, ano-, another public facility --

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  -- where they have, you know, recycling of glass, uh, aluminum and paper. 
Now,

A.19:  Have you, have you cycled, recycled plastic also?

B.20:  No, and that's what I, I don't understand exactly why they don't have that
option. 

A.21:  We, we have out here --

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  -- uh, up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any
really good way, they had some bends,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # around # that we could find and put them in but not all that many, it
wasn't very well advertised --

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  -- but recently, uh, the refuse department has, has, uh, is working on
getting a system going where we will actually have, uh, a bend that we put
things in for recycling these other things --

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  -- so it, it should be good, uh,

B.30:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # I # think it's a marvelous idea when you think of, uh, when I just think
of the papers that I dump out --

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  -- I mean there just, it's such a I waste, I just hate to think about it. 

B.34:  Yeah, now an additional thing is, uh, where I work --

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  -- they also have recycling there of, uh, all white paper and of, you know,
cans also --

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  -- so, I mean, a lot of people, you know, right at the vending machines,

A.39:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.40:  # they # have receptacles that, you know,

A.41:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.42:  # you # can just pop your cans in and near the,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # Xerox # machines they have places, you know, for your,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # paper, # you know, I keep a little box at my desk, you know,

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # and # I just throw, as I'm using the white paper, you know, I just throw
it right in there,

A.49:  # Uh.  #

B.50:  # and # then, you know, they have someone that comes around and pick it up,
you know, every afternoon --

A.51:  Yeah, that's neat. 

B.52:  -- which, you know, is an excellent idea,

A.53:  # Yeah.  #

B.54:  # at # work because I know the amount paper they go through [laughter] 
there because,

A.55:  Yeah, that's right.  I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to
happen is we need to be better informed about,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # about # it, there's needs to be more public, uh,

B.58:  # Yeah, I would agree with that.  #

A.59:  # service of, programs or something that # would let us know had a happens
to it --

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  -- and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening --

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  -- # and there's,#

B.64:  # Right.  #

A.65:  I've seen a few things but not very much,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # really # and I, I think that's a shame they need to, uh, do a little
more, I'd like to know, for instance, when I, when they say, uh, plastic, all
plastic, what kind of plastic,

B.68:  # Exactly.  #

A.69:  # can # you put all together or,

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # is # there some reason not to, uh, now maybe they just sort it after they
get it and throw out what they can't use, I don't know --

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  -- but I, I'd be glad to organize it,

B.74:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.75:  # [Laughter]  # if that they'd tell me what it is I'm doing --

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  -- because that would, that would be really helpful. 

B.78:  Uh-huh, yeah, I agree with you there, another thing that I like here which
is, I do with, I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because
one of them is that, uh, their aluminum cans is for, uh, Children's Hospital,
for a burn fund --

A.79:  Uh-huh. 

B.80:  -- so all the monies are donated, you know,

A.81:  # Yeah.  #

B.82:  # for # the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent
idea,

A.83:  # Uh-huh, that's great.  #

B.84:  # there, you know, # because the other,

A.85:  Now #that gives,#

B.86:  # public, #

A.87:  you a little bit of incentive there. 

B.88:  Right, right,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # and # before even at work, before they started the recycling plan, which
at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had
everyone in my department recycling and, you know, I would have them drop,

A.91:  # Saving them for you, uh.  #

B.92:  # right, drop their cans off # in my office and then I would haul them, you
know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund --

A.93:  Uh-huh. 

B.94:  -- which got people really going into it,

A.95:  I think #that's,#

B.96:  # but, #

A.97:  right.  I think, I think helping us be more enthu-, enthusiastic about it,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # helping # us maybe, maybe using the money for something special that
would be like paying off the national debt [laughter].

B.100:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.101:  [Laughter]. 

B.102:  That, there you go. 

A.103:  Making sure (( )) [laughter]. 

B.104:  [Laughter]  That's for sure. 

A.105:  But I, I think that's right I think they, there needs to be a little bit
more in the area of, of, uh, ad-, advertisement,

B.106:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.107:  # and # letting, public letting you understand,

B.108:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.109:  # more # of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how you're it's
done and,

B.110:  # Right, right.  #

A.111:  # what, what # happens to it because I think that's, that would help a lot.

B.112:  Uh-huh, and I'm sure, you know, in the near future I would think they would
be coming out with more,

A.113:  # Yeah.  #

B.114:  # you # know, I've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling,

A.115:  # Yeah, I, #

B.116:  # everywhere, you # know, even at McDonald's,

A.117:  # Yeah.  #

B.118:  # you # know, with their, their use of no,

A.119:  # Yes, I, I'm glad,#

B.120:  # foam containers anymore.  #

A.121:  to see some of these things, I think. 

B.122:  Right.  I think, I think it is getting more, you know, advertisement. 

A.123:  People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do,

B.124:  # Right.  #

A.125:  # and # that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have
everything individually wrapped,

B.126:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.127:  # and # all these things that,

B.128:  # Right.  #

A.129:  # I # think that's true.  Well, I think, I'm that's about my, uh
[laughter],

B.130:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

A.131:  # ((some)) on # recycling but I, I enjoyed talking to you. 

B.132:  Okay, well, I did too. 

A.133:  Uh-huh, all right, bye now. 

B.134:  Okay.  Bye-bye [clicking]  {phone clicks hanging up}.
