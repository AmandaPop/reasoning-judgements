=========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any interest in gun control?  Would you like to start first, 
uh,

@B.2:  Well, I thought,

A.3:  ((Go ahead)).

B.4:  it was interesting that they gave us a scale, uh,

A.5:  Oh, yeah, that's right.

B.6:  I have to kind of think about that as to exactly where I stand.  I'm more
[breathing], uh, more against gun control than pro,

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  I think, probably.  

A.9:  I guess I would pick a five.  I'm not quite sure.  I, I share an interest
of, of guns and I have some guns and I have two brothers in laws who,

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  when we get together we go plinking and, and one of them hunts, so we've
talked about it.  I don't quite understand the N R A -s, uh, C I A type stand.
It seems to me they'd be, guns can become an, a hobby, and they, they take the
approach of, uh, too, too hard nosed on it.  I don't quite understand.  I
don't, I, I, I mean I, my brother in law hunts and, and he doesn't need a
automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt.

B.12:  Agreed, agreed {second one faint}.

A.13:  And I don't quite understand the Uzis and all that.  I think those should
be banned.  I don't think that, uh,

B.14:  The military type, 

A.15:  Oh, yeah.  

B.16:  things.  

A.17:  Hunters, uh, should get whatever they think they need, but, heck, we've had
hunting rifles for a hundred years and so, uh, they're certainly not Uzis,

B.18:  No.  

A.19:  and things like that.  

B.20:  No.  I come from a family of hunters and, and lots of brothers.  I have
five brothers and, and they've all hunted and, and my, uh, in fact, I didn't
ever e-, hardly ever even eat beef until I was about five or six years old.
((As)) my daddy's theory was, if you hunt it, you better eat it until it's
gone and,

A.21:  Oh. 

B.22:  then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always
ate venison and it's still just about my favorite meat.

A.23:  Oh, yeah, that, I think that's great, that's a great attitude.

B.24:  And my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as hunt with a gun,
but pretty much now our theory is, you know, we'll shoot with a camera unless
we need to [breathing].  Wee, you know, we both know how to hunt and take care
of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family.  And we own guns.
We really have not, uh,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].  

B.26:  [Lipsmack] [breathing] this isn't just really great hunting country
[laughter], I mean, you know, there's not a lot of [breathing],

A.27:  No.

B.28:  access.  You almost have to go, like, to an indoor range or something to,
to be able for your children to learn gun safety --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- in a safe situation.  Because you s-, have to assume, in my mind, that
anyplace that's out far enough where you could shoot, somebody else can be out
there plinking at you [laughter] --

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  -- [Breathing] and your kids.  You know, I've never allowed my boys to have
B B guns, which, by the time my brothers were my sons' ages, you know, they,

A.33:  They had twenty-twos.

B.34:  they had plenty of B B guns and used them and everything on, you know,
and it was kind of that, you know, same kind of theory then, you know, that,
uh, [breathing] if you shot it, you better figure out a way to bring it home
and eat it or better not ever let mother know that,

A.35:  Yeah, well I agree.

B.36:  you know, that you were out, [breathing] you know, indiscriminately
taking out birds or squirrels,

A.37:  Right, you're abs-,

B.38:  or whatever.  

A.39:  There you go.  I think that's a, that's a, 

B.40:  But, on the other hand, we've eaten a lot of [breathing] raccoon and possum
and turtle [laughter] all kinds of,

A.41:  You've eaten raccoon and possum?  

B.42:  All my, I have a little grandmother in Oklahoma, 

A.43:  Oh, my goodness.

B.44:  and, you know, [lipsmack] that's, she'll cook anything if you bring it in
and,

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  you know, that's, and so my brothers would always hunt those things and,
[breathing] you know we're a little more, but on the other hand I, I don't
have a whole lot of patience with people who, who don't want to talk about
that kind of the end of animals, and yet they're more than willing to go up to
Skaggs, or, you know,

A.47:  Oh, yeah.

B.48:  Kroger, or, whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home
and cook it.  And, you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and,
you know, ooh {changes voice},

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  you know, I, I, I don't go for that, you know, I, [breathing] that to me
is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the stand.

A.51:  Oh, yeah, and I, I,

B.52:  You know, I, I have a respect for life and, [breathing] for meat.  I eat it
sparingly, but when I eat it, I know that, you know, some-, something had to
die for it [laughter], so,

A.53:  I, uh, I do-, I do-,

B.54:  Even if it was in a butcher lot.  

A.55:  I don't know why the, uh, I always did, uh, I'm probably a five although I
haven't really, that's not a very well thought out, uh, since they gave a
number system.  Uh, my brother in law, one of them hunts and the other one is
a real collector --

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- and we get together we go shooting and I've been a lot of plinking and,
uh, as a kid, you know, as a teenager, we'd go to the rifle range and
everything and shoot twenty-twos and everything.

B.58:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.59:  Problems we have in society is, like today some teenager locally here in
the Metroplex used a, a twenty-two whatever and, it's on the news if you
listen to the news tonight, and went after his teacher, and fired three or
four shots, uh, at the school.  Now to me, gun control is not going to control
it, but the parents --

B.60:  That's right.  

A.61:  -- you know a teenager, you know, below eighteen or whatever the age should
be,

B.62:  How do they get access to that,  

A.63:  Right.  

B.64:  kind of thing, you know.  Where,

A.65:  Guns should be, an adult should be responsible.  Now I think that if you
have a gun, an adult, then you have a responsibility for whether you call it
locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to
it.

B.66:  Or, a little child.  I mean think of the times,

A.67:  That's, oh, well, 

B.68:  we've seen, 

A.69:  that includes little kids, too, yeah.  

B.70:  You know, a criminal element is kind of out of my realm.  I mean
personally.

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  You know, I, I don't, I don't have anybody in my family's ever gone to
jail.  I, I've never [breathing] known anybody personally who used a gun
against themselves or, you know, or, or someone else, ex-, well I guess I have
in a couple of cases of suicide, but, still that's not exactly the criminal
element that I think of as, you know what I'm saying.

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  Go down to the local Seven-Eleven and,

A.75:  I'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill.  I think I, I, I think guns
need controls, intelligent controls, but I don't think it has maybe a one
percent relationship directly to crime.  Uh, buying Uzis and all that may, you
know, I think that the cops should have the best weapons and whatever they
need.  But I don't think the average, uh, plinker or hunter needs to go out
and buy, be able to buy that.  I don't think he should, uh, be allowed to buy
an Uzi or something.

B.76:  And, and I understand that these magazines, you know, and whatnot, that
cater to that crowd are very, uh, you know, the mercenary kinds,

A.77:  Oh, yeah.   

B.78:  of things, I can't think of some of the names right off, but I've heard
them, that they're just replete with advertisements for these really, uh,
[breathing] militarily sophisticated types of weapons.  Mercenary type things,

A.79:  I know it's --

B.80:  is what I think of.  

A.81:  -- it's shooting against people, they go out, you know, I, I've seen them
on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice
shooting each other, you know, I mean,

B.82:  And targets, yeah.  

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  And I, I think, uh, it should be in the hunting realm.  I don't know why
the N R A doesn't have nice range.  You talk about a range.  You're right,
ranges are hard to, we have them here in Arlington, uh, one here in Fort Worth
I go to, but, uh, it would think the N R A would take the positive side and
open up some nice, practice ranges and teach it, you know, and rather than
just, uh, try to b-, lobby for it, you know, they ought to come out in the
open, uh, and open up some, maybe they do have a lot of good ranges, but the
ones I go to are just ranges, you know, I don't,

B.86:  Well, there used to be, uh, I grew up in Irving, we live in Plano now.
There used to quite a few along the Trinity River bottom and whatnot that you
could go to and out in Euless and, [breathing] uh, area, uh, out off of one
fifty-seven, and you know those are just, es-, extinct now.

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  Not even available, you know, 

A.89:  Well, my,

B.90:  they've been built up so much around, it's no longer,

A.91:  My brother in law's in San Antonio and he, uh, they're, they're closing,
the, the ranges, they're slowly, but surely closing.

B.92:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.93:  So when I can go here in Fort Worth, it's south part of Fort Worth is run
very well.  Of course it has guns, uh, to buy.  But they have a state trooper,
I guess he's in his spare time, he's always there with a forty-five automatic
on his side so that, that's the only range I've been to that has a cop there.

B.94:  And yet, you know, I would think that a practice shooting range,
[breathing], the kind of people that it would generate, is the last place you
probably really have a problem with guns.

A.95:  Right.  No, I think that's the, I've seen him, there are some real amateurs
that,

B.96:  But it's a nice thought, you know [laughter].  

A.97:  yeah, there's some real amateurs that come.  I saw one, one time when
somebody came, with, with a nonhunting one of these and he was just, you
know, moving it arou-, waving it arou-,

B.98:  So is he there for instruction, then?

A.99:  Pardon me.  

B.100:  Is he there for instruction?   The trooper?  

A.101:  No, he's just there to, uh, 

B.102:  Ward off trouble.  

A.103:  Tell everybody, hey this is where you aim and watch it,

B.104:  Yeah {faint}.

A.105:  you're endangering the rest of the people.  

B.106:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.107:  And, of course when you go and take your targets down, he's there to make
sure that people.  That's what it was, people did not t-, totally unload their
guns when you, you, when you take the targets down you walk in front of your
own guns, and he would look over everyone's shoulder and say hey, your, your
gun's not unloaded, you know.  You have to unload,

B.108:  [Groan].  

A.109:  you walkout there in this particular range out here in Fort Worth, now
the other ranges it's always somebody else, but the, the inspector would which
by and say, or the rifle range, uh, owner would come by and look at everyone's
gun before he would step in front of you.  And so you need some sort of common
sense as well as expertise with a gun,

B.110:  That's true.  

A.111:  before you put a bunch of dummies out there with guns now.  

B.112:  Well, I've been very happy with, uh, you know, the, the education that my
boys have gotten uh, through scouting,

A.113:  Oh, yeah, that's great, yeah.  

B.114:  [Lipsmack] uh, they're, and my husband, they're all scouters and, you
know, a lot of times those things are encouraged, you know, at, uh,

A.115:  That's a good question, yeah, I, I have girls so they haven't been in
scouts.  Does, does, scouting have a gun section where they, they teach them
twenty-twos,

B.116:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.117:  Oh, that's great.  

B.118:  See there's, 

A.119:  I think that's the way it should be.

B.120:  scout camps and whatnot, but, once again, you know, they don't run a
range, you know, that, uh,

A.121:  They just plink.

B.122:  But that still is, you know, all of that, I guess, is secondary to
[breathing] to that criminal mischief element.

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  They're always going to create and find something to do. 

A.125:  Yeah, and again, that's why I don't think it should be part of a criminal
or a crime bill, because they,

B.126:  A legislative type thing.  I, [breathing] the ones that want them are
always going to get them, and [breathing] the ones that, {pause}, [breathing],
the ones that might need them sometime, I mean, it's probably just going to
make it more difficult, you know, for,

A.127:  Yeah.  But we have to look ahead, because we, we've had two hundred years
worth of, uh, or longer rather, we came over with guns, four hundred years I
guess you might say, and I think we have to look at it as it's not going to
solve it next week.  We just got to look, uh, for the next ten or twenty
years, you know, what kind of gun, uh, not controls, gun, uh, legislature
should we have and then slowly change.  It's going to take twenty-five years
or so, maybe to get the, the, the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the
true hunter, you know, has a registered gun and people that allow other
children to get access to a gun should be fined.
