======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, you do have children, right?  

B.2:  Yes, we have,  

A.3:  Okay, tell me about the time you spend with your children, I guess.

B.4:  Okay, that time is, uh, hadn't been a whole lot here in the last several
months.

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  I've been working so many hours.  When we do have time, it tends to be in,
uh, discussion kinds of activities,

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  although more, I'm trying to get into doing some sports stuff with my
son.

A.9:  Yeah, how old is your son?

B.10:  He's nine.  

A.11:  Oh, good, yeah, uh, I saw, I saw in the paper where, uh, the new thing for,
like, the baby boomers is that they're, uh, taking, uh, jobs that require less
at work and trying to spend more time with their family.  I, I know I heard on
the news that, that's just the, the growing trends from some big survey.  Uh,
it, was that, would that be a consideration if you were to take another job?

B.12:  Oh, yes, very much.  Uh, my wife and I have tried to come up with a
collective amount of time that we think is appropriate and then we're just
going to have to figure out what, uh, what time, who has what time to spend in
what activities, I guess --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- is a way of putting it.  

A.15:  I don't, I don't have children, but, uh, do you find that it's, uh, better,
I don't want to say better, it's kind of obvious, but, do you think time with
one parent, like if you were off doing something and your wife was doing
something with the kids that that's, I mean that's adequate or do you think
both parents need to be there?

B.16:  I think it needs to be combination of those.  That there are some things
that, uh, I can represent better and there are other things that she can
represent better and then that we have to show that interaction.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  Certainly, and that both of us are, are caring and loving.  

A.19:  Sounds good.  What about current trends around the country, like, for, you
know, the, uh, about the, you know, like the, the two, the couple that, you
know, their, their children go off to day care all day and then they come
back?  I mean when I, when I was raised, course that was a while ago, my mom
was working, then when I was born she took off and, and she didn't go back to
work till I was in high school, or junior high.  Or she did work, she worked
at the elementary school, so she was right there with me.  Uh, do you think
that that's, uh, a problem in that it's different than the way it was when we
were growing up or, especially you, probably.

B.20:  I think it's certainly different, uh, I grew up probably earlier than you
did --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- and my mom was always home, uh, forever, you know, she was a housewife
when that was the classic meaning of the word.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  And, uh, [breathing] she was always there, uh, and I think that because she
was always there and I knew that I always had access to her, I tended to spend
my time, let's say more efficiently --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- because now I've noticed that whenever I'm home my son likes to hang
around where I am because I'm here so seldom --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- instead of, like now, he's burning daylight, you know, because he's
hanging around me [breathing], instead of being out there playing with the
other kids.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  And I could always count on my father being home at a set period of time.
Somehow, you know, back in those days it seemed like people didn't work the
hours that we do now.

A.31:  Right.  What long-term effects do you think that'll have on, maybe not your
children, but, you know, the, this generation as a whole?

B.32:  I think that, uh, we're going to find out that the, uh, massive amounts of
time that we've spent away from our family were not worth it.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  But, there's just, unfortunately, I don't see any alternatives.

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  In order to compete in today's work environment, I need to meet and exceed
what my peers do.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  And if they are going to work those kinds of hours, then I have to do that.

A.39:  Uh-huh {pause}.  Huh {pause}.  Because I, I was thinking, I'm, considering,
you know, a career in, in medicine, and, you know, physicians at-,
stereotypically, you know, they work fairly long hours, but talking with some,
you know, on a one on one basis, they say a lot of that is, you know, the
physician's own personal choosing.  If they're [breathing] really hungry, for
a lot of money, you know, they'll work long hours in their private practice.
I mean, sure, every physician will have times when they'll have to
[breathing], you know, get out of bed at two in the morning because one of
their patients has had an emergency, but [breathing] you know, if, it's
possible to be pretty much a, a nine to five physician, or eight to six or,
you know, whatever, you know,

B.40:  Oh, I,  

A.41:  you can hold fairly regular hours [breathing] and,

B.42:  I think that's very realistic.  

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  Uh, I have a couple of good friends who are physicians and they tell me
that unless they are in dire need of more money for a brief period of time,
that they work eight to six, and they don't even work five days a week.

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  You know, they work eight to six, four and a half days a week.

A.47:  Uh-huh {pause}.  That sounds, yeah, and, course they're in private
practice, right?

B.48:  Yes.  You know,

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  and they're astounded at the hours that I work.  

A.51:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, like you said, I mean, they're, they're not really in
competition with anyone else, you know what I mean?  Like you are.

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  Like your peers, you said you have to, if they're going to work it, you're
going to have to work it, too.  But, like a physician, it seems like, you
know, they can pretty much work whatever they need as their financial
requirements fluctuate.

B.54:  Well, that tends to be true of, of, uh, anyone who's in business
[breathing] pretty much for themselves --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- uh, you know, a lawyer has that same [breathing] type of, of freedom.
Uh, I would think an accountant does.  It's just {pause} when you have to, to
compete, then you have to, y-, your, uh, {pause} guidelines are set by other
people.

A.57:  Yeah.  If you,

B.58:  But I think we got away from, from children a little bit there.

A.59:  Oh, yeah well sort of yeah [laughter], just a little bit.  I was going to
ask you if, if you knew now the, the time spent with your children would be
affected by the career that you have chosen, would you have taken a more, uh,
work for yourself job like maybe, I don't know, lawyer or whatever, the, the
standard nine to five job?

B.60:  I think so.  

A.61:  Okay.  

B.62:  But I'd of had to know it twenty years ago.  

A.63:  Right, right {pause}.  See that's, yeah, that's, that's what I'm looking at
now is, you know, because I'm where you were probably twenty years ago, or, or
maybe fifteen, just trying to [breathing] find a career and, and find out how
much family time I need and then select a career that would meet that need, I
guess.

B.64:  Well, I'm on my second career currently and I'm, I'm just too old to start
a third.

A.65:  Uh-huh {pause}.  Okay {faint}, well,

B.66:  Or too tired.  

A.67:  Or too tired [laughter].  

B.68:  Uh, I don't know that I'm too old [laughter], but I'm too tired to start a
third career.

A.69:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  No, I, actually I don't, but I can imagine.
Okay {faint}.

B.70:  But you have all this fun to look forward to in the future. 

A.71:  Yeah [laughter], yeah.  We, we, uh, it's kind of interesting.  We just got
a puppy yesterday and it's sort of like a foreshadowing of what is going to
happen when an infant arrives, you know --

B.72:  Oh yes.  Just very,   

A.73:  -- I mean not to the extent, [breathing], I mean we could always sell the
dog and the get out, but, uh, spending time and vet bills and, [breathing] and
stuff like that, that okay yeah, we'll get a dog, you know, [breathing] food,
you know, twenty bucks a month or whatever, no problem [breathing].  But, uh,
you forget all the little hidden costs that go in with it.  So I think it's
kind of a good experience.

B.74:  Oh yes, very much.  

A.75:  [Laughter].  

B.76:  Uh, what kind of puppy did you get?  

A.77:  Oh, we got a Rottweiler.  

B.78:  [Laughter] Yeah, s-, serious dog there.  

A.79:  Yeah, it's a serious dog [laughter].  Right now it's a serious tired puppy,
but, uh, hopefully in the future it'll be a serious dog.  But, there again we
steered away from the topic a little bit.  But, uh [breathing],

B.80:  Well, I don't know puppies and children really do go together,

A.81:  Oh.  

B.82:  believe me. 

A.83:  Okay.  

B.84:  I've always been a dog person and, in fact, I am watching my, what I,
everybody says is my dog even though it's the family dog --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- licking my son's face now.  

A.87:  [Laughter] Yeah, we, we saw a little parallel, we're, like, is this what
it's going to be with, because I stayed up all night because the dog was
uncomfortable in a new home and was awake and walking around and [breathing] I
was, you know, I was like, is this what it's going to be like when we have a
child.  I mean I got two hours sleep last night, you know.  So,

B.88:  Well, that will be some of it but, you know, those, my daughter is eleven
and I look back on those times when we first brought her home from the
hospital,

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  and she was a night person from day one and still is today.  Uh, but she
would wake up during the night for her middle of the night feeding and I'd,
I'd get up and go get her and clean her up and, you know, change her britches
and --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- take her in and let her mother breast feed her and then I'd take her
back, and sh-,
