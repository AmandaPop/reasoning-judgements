=========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have some kids getting ready for college?

B.2:  Well I have, uh, uh, basically have grown children.  I've got one that's,
that is, a part-time college student and one that's college age but not
attending so, uh, he did, uh. 

A.3:  You've sort of faced up to the problem then. 

B.4:  Yeah, he, he did, uh, attend a little bit, you know, th-, took some classes
and then decided it, college was not what he wanted to do, so. 

A.5:  # Yeah.  #

B.6:  # He # went along, th-, the older one, the daughter who is older, is going
part-time and working full time. 

A.7:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.8:  # Uh, # she's attending a community college right now and she would like to
go on to a, you know, to a four year school, go ahead and get a degree. 

A.9:  Yes. 

B.10:  And, uh, that's, you know, one of her, immediate long range objectives. 

A.11:  Well, I've got a bunch of little ones that are still growing up and,

B.12:  # Yeah, #

A.13:  # so # I'm sort of facing putting them through college about the time I'm
also looking to retire. 

B.14:  Oh, yeah, so you, uh,

A.15:  And, uh, I think my, initial thoughts are, going to have to sort of grade
my advice according to, uh, you know, how much motivation and drive and, uh,
and ability they have when they start facing the college years.

B.16:  Right, uh, I, I guess, uh, one thing, from, from my own personal
experience, uh, the drive is the important, or is, I, I consider to be the
important part of going to college.  Um, I, I was not an exceptional student
by any means in high school.  I was not a bad student, but was not an
exceptional student and, you know, didn't really have, uh, any strong
ambitions that required college, but, I did want to go to school, did want to
get the, you know, go ahead and get the college.

A.17:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.18:  # And # so I worked my way through college and, uh, you know, I think that
it was because I really wanted the degree, that I, you know, followed through
and went ahead and, and went on, even finished up going to college after I got
married. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  And, uh, uh, like you said, I think that, uh, the ambition and the drive
is, uh, is pretty much k-, a key there.

A.21:  # Yeah.  #

B.22:  # Uh, # like I said, we've got the one that's not going to college, an he
just does not have the desire to go at this time.  Are, I hope that some day,
for my benefit, I hope that some day he decides he wants to go because it will,
you know, make me feel better but, uh, whatever makes him feel best is what's
important, I suppose. 

A.23:  Yeah.  Well, I think my reaction from my experience is that, uh, I picked a
school that was too good,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # and, # uh, so I had a fairly tough time getting through and they
presented me with a lot of material which I just wasn't able to absorb and
handle.

B.26:  # Yeah, and I, I, think that that's, #

A.27:  # And, uh, so I think my first # advice would be to go to a community
college and to a, a smaller school for your undergraduate studies,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # maybe # a state supported school.  And then if you have the necessary
drive and still need the, the intellectual mileage to pick a top of the line
school for graduate study. 

B.30:  Uh-huh, I think that's a good idea.  Uh, and, and, too, I guess, uh,
looking at, at what the, the individuals interests are, instead of just what,
uh, what the popular degree plans are.

A.31:  Right. 

B.32:  Uh, I, I started out in, in high school expecting to go into engineering
and when I got into the mathematics and science classes, I was not a bad
student in tho-, in those areas, but didn't really have the interest in it so
I changed my, my career design over into the accounting and business field.

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.34:  # And, # uh, I am a C P A.  And I, you know, I'm pretty good at that, but
I, it's not, it was not something that I really thought long and hard and had
a real, h-, you know, a real strong drive toward.  Um, I'm not sure what, uh,
what I would have done differently, or what I would do differently now, but,
uh, I might, you know, I might go in a different direction if I were to start
fresh.  Uh, you know, think more about what my real interest were instead of
what my, you know, instead of what was available, or what sounded like a good
money-maker.  Uh, it's not always the important thing.

A.35:  Yeah, I think one it's very important to chose a career that, uh, to do
something you enjoy doing. 

B.36:  Right. 

A.37:  Because I figure that's part of my compensation, is, is being able to do
something I can take an interest in. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  Uh, I think one of the reactions I had, uh, was that I underestimated the
amount of math that was needed for an engineering degree. 

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  Uh, you know, my interest, uh, in high school was, you know grabbing up a
bunch of vacuum tubes and, and building something that worked. 

B.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.43:  # And, # uh, you know, it was a matter of using cookbook designs and so
forth and building up amplifiers or oscillators, or making transmitters or
receivers and, uh, you know, I didn't face up to the fact that there's a, and
enormous mathematical basis for all of this [laughter], 

B.44:  # Right.  #

A.45:  # until # I actually got to college. 

B.46:  # Ri-, #

A.47:  # And # so it was a bit of a slap in the face.  And an uphill struggle. 
Although I didn't have that much trouble with math, uh, in high school. 

B.48:  [Noise] {sounds like blowing a nose}. Yeah, um, an I guess another, another
area that, uh, in retrospect, I would give parents a real strong advice on, is
the, the study habits and preparation that students need.

A.49:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.50:  # And, # and they need to start as early as they can, you know, not wait
until they're a freshman in high school even, to start developing good study
habits and get the, you know, get the good basics.  Uh, you know, the math and
the, the english and a little science and stuff like, that, that, uh, so they
really have a good background for whatever,

A.51:  # Yeah.  #

B.52:  # course # load they're going to take.  Because, uh, I know in, in my son's
case, his math background i-, is not very strong and we tried, a lot, you know,
to, to help him,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # but # I think that the, uh, I think the educational system, uh, the way
things are, are run in this area, anyway, it, it's a little weak and, you know,
as a result he doesn't, he doesn't have the math background that he would need
in college. 

A.55:  # Right.  #

B.56:  # And, # uh, I think that's one reason that he's not interested, he doesn't
think he would do well. 

A.57:  Well, I was fairly lucky in, uh, going to a small town school.  Uh, I got a
lot of individual attention from the faculty that was there.  They probably
weren't the most brilliant people in the world, but they, uh, were very
personable and took, uh, a interest in people who were willing to study. 

B.58:  Yeah.  Uh, I agree I think that makes a difference, uh,

A.59:  # And so I, #

B.60:  # I went to # a small town school also. 

A.61:  # We ha-, #

B.62:  # My son # went to a school that had like twenty-five hundred students in
it or something, you know.

A.63:  Yeah, yeah, you get lost there. 

B.64:  And, uh, it's, it's re-, well, it really makes a difference as to,

A.65:  There were thirty-six students in my graduating class [laughter]. 

B.66:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.67:  Uh, but the, you know, we had a math instructor there and when I asked him
questions about calculus and so forth, he was incapable of handling it.  You
know, algebra was fine, but, you know, if you asked him about differential
equations or (( )) or something like that, he didn't know what you were talking
about. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  Uh, and when I went to take solid geometry, I had to, uh, commute to a, a
larger town, to Allentown Pennsylvania to take, uh, solid geometry and the
instructor there was, was sharp enough to know, or to realize that I was good
at mathematical concepts but I had one lingering flaw left over from grade
school and that was that I hadn't learned to add, subtract, multiply and
divide correctly [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter]  Yeah and that, that does make a difference, that's wha-, like I
was saying, you know, you get those basics behind you to start with, uh, you
know, get a good foundation in, uh, those core type courses,

A.71:  # Right.  #

B.72:  # and # it, it will carry you a long way, if, you know, the, the concepts
and the, the logic and just understanding what the, what's expected of you,

A.73:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.74:  # really # makes a lot of difference in, them, you know, what you're
capable of doing, so.

A.75:  Yes.  All right, well, it's been nice talking to you. 

@@B.76:  Yeah, it's been nice, I hope they got what they wanted on this. 

A.77:  Well they should have some, some words they can parse there. 

B.78:  Right, okay. 

A.79:  Take care. 

B.80:  I'll talk to you later, maybe. 

A.81:  Bye. 

B.82:  Thanks.
