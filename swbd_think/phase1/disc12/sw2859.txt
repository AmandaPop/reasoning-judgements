=============================================================================

A.1:  My name is Diane.

B.2:  I'm Cliff Penn.

A.3:  Hi.  Well what's your favorite team?  I like the Chicago Bears [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter]  Well I, uh, don't have, uh, much, much of a favorite team
since the Cowboys haven't done much so I guess I'll just have to say the
Cowboys.

A.5:  The Cowboys?  Well, they haven't done much for, they never did much
[laughter],

B.6:  Um.

A.7:  even when Landry and Staubach were playing.  I'm being real sarcastic.
[laughter] Did you like them back then?

B.8:  Oh yeah.  In fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or
not.  Um.

A.9:  [Laughter] Touch3e.  Yes.  Well, when I moved here in the, uh,
mid-seventies, um, are you in Dallas?

B.10:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.11:  Yes, so am I.  Uh, I just use to laugh because back then I was a Steelers
fan.  I'm from, originally from Pittsburg,

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they, their preseason
games at the stadium, you know,

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  where the Cowboys, versus, what do you think they're going to do this
year?

B.16:  Oh, they may be a little better, but, uh, they got a long way to go --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  In,

B.18:  -- after Landry got the shaft.

A.19:  He sure did. That I agree with you on.  Yeah.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  What do you think of, uh, the guy who's coaching them now, from Miami?  I
can't remember his name off the top of my head.  I can picture his gray hair,
but [laughter],

B.22:  [Laughter] Yeah, well they all start with J [laughter] so.

A.23:  Yeah [laughter].

B.24:  And, he's Johnson.  

A.25:  Yeah, that's right.

B.26:  Right.  Well, he's learned a little bit but the first year he was here he
was playing college football,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  and it was pretty simple stuff.

A.29:  Are you a football fan, uh, by nature, or is this something you grew into?

B.30:  Yeah, I, I, in Texas, uh, football's the game instead of baseball.

A.31:  That's true.  I agree with you there, 

B.32:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.33:  though at least it has a little more action than baseball.

B.34:  Yep.

A.35:  Well, I don't know why I like the Bears, but I do.  I just think they have
some good players but,

B.36:  Well, they've had some very good players,

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  and fact, uh, the best tight end in football is now their coach
[laughter].

A.39:  Eight-nine.  Yeah, Mr. Ditka.  Well, you can't say too much bad about him,
I mean, he did learn his, hone his trade under Landry.

B.40:  Well, actually, he was, uh, a-, as a coach he learned his trade under
Landry, but as, uh --

A.41:  That's what I meant.

B.42:  -- as a player, I remember seeing him as a young man, fighting everybody
off while he caught a pass on a tight end.

A.43:  Yeah, the University of Pittsburgh.  Well, I was probably a little bit too
young for that, but, um, I know, we just laugh now in terms of not specific
teams, but, um, we have company and one of the men got bored earlier this
afternoon and he turned on the television, and one of the ladies said, what's,
you know, what's the football game [laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter]  Right.

A.45:  And I wasn't even aware, I mean, I knew it, but I just, I guess I kind of
shut it out like most females [laughter].

B.46:  Yeah, the, the World Football League is playing, uh,

A.47:  Yeah, something,

B.48:  Frank-, uh, playing in Germany, I think, I've forgotten where they are.

A.49:  Oh, funny.

B.50:  Germany and somebody that --

A.51:  San Antonio?  And San Antonio has a team or something?

B.52:  -- yeah, Landry is down there over San Antonio now.

A.53:  Oh, you're kidding?

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Oh goodness.  Are you that avid a fan that you would watch it ra-, uh, year
round?

B.56:  No, no, I, uh, actually I haven't, uh, watched it as much since, uh, the
Cowboys' demise as I used to.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  I used to watch it every weekend, 

A.59:  Yeah, it, it --

B.60:  irregardless of who was playing, whether it was Cowboys or not, but, uh,

A.61:  -- it seemed like it's, up to about ten to twelve years ago, I mean
all the sports, 

B.62:  [Throat_clearing].

A.63:  including football, it used to seem, uh, before the higher ticket prices
in terms of,

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  just not for fans, but I mean, what, what the salaries some of the
players were getting.

B.66:  Yeah, now that it's uh, well, I think a lot went out of it when they had
the strike too [throat_clearing].

A.67:  Yeah, I mean, I, um, I mean, like I was just reading something in today's
paper about Herschel Walker, and I had to chuckle, you know, I mean, you
wonder what he really is d-, I mean, I really don't care, but, what happens to
a player when they're sitting in their cars and they fall asleep because, um,
they're so tired, and the carbon, they're overcome by ama-, carbon monoxide
fumes [laughter].

B.68:  Yeah, yeah, that's hard to believe, alright [throat_clearing].

A.69:  You know, um, but I think it's still healthy, I mean, I have a nephew that
plays football and, if that's what he wanted to do, I certainly wouldn't tell
his parents to encourage it, but, I think it's still an honorable sport.

B.70:  Yeah.  Who do you think, uh, Chicago will have quarterbacking now?

A.71:  [Laughter] I have no idea.  

B.72:  Yeah, it --

A.73:  Who is he, who, um, the guy, the young guy from, uh, Ohio State, I think
he's already over the hill, isn't he?

B.74:  -- seems like it.

A.75:  Oh, I can't reme-, I can't even remember his, my mind went blank today,
it must be the heat.  Um, I don't know, I just, uh, I actually, l-, you know,
I was probably was like you were when the, when Payton was big, you know this
is probably about five years after when everything was the America team, but,
um, I actually once Payton left, I kind of just lost, you know,

B.76:  Yeah, he was a superstar, alright.

A.77:  Yeah, I kind of just lost, um, and I don't think Ditka's going to stay
around much longer.  I don't know if he renewed a two year or not.  I think
he's either in the middle of that or just did that.

B.78:  Yeah, it s-, seems like the spice has gone out of it for him.

A.79:  Yeah, it's kind of, you know, I mean, uh, it's kind of like when the
Cowboys, the Bears, and the Steelers went, you know, like I said, about ten,
twelve years ago, it seemed like football was really interesting then,

B.80:  Yeah, they --

A.81:  and it didn't matter who was playing, it just, it was worth watching.

B.82:  -- yeah, there were several really good teams in that time frame.

A.83:  Yeah, and it was competitive, and it seemed a little cleaner, I don't know,
um,

B.84:  Yeah, I think it probably was, the, uh, now then there's a lot of dirty
stuff going on on the line that the f-, that the referees don't call.  Things
get out of hand.

A.85:  Yeah, and there's some technical stuff, 

B.86:  [Throat_clearing].

A.87:  you know this minicam stuff, these instant replay things, that, uh,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  I'm not sure that I would agree with some of it.  But I still think it's
a good sport.

B.90:  Well, actually, I think if they'd a had that technical rep-, uh, technical,
uh, bit where they replayed,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  it, at, Dallas would've won two Super Bowls that they didn't win because
of bad calls [laughter].

A.93:  Some of those calls, well, I have to agree with you, because I can
remember, um, when they played the Dolphins and I saw Ditka take the
touchdown, and I remember there were one or two calls in that game,

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  I think it was in seventy-, was that seventy-three, or seventy-two, I
can't,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  I can't even go back that far anymore [laughter].

B.98:  Yeah, yeah.  There was one that, uh, supposedly, uh, a fumble after a
touchdown,

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  and, uh, the Cowboys theoretically lost it, but, uh,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  they didn't really [laughter].

A.103:  No, I know.

B.104:  In fact, the guy, uh, who had reco-, who was supposed to have recovered it
later admitted that he had, uh, after it had already crossed the goal line in
the other guy's hand he jerked it out of his hand, so it was,

A.105:  [Laughter].

B.106:  he admitted that he had done that after the fact.  But you could see it
on camera when it happened, but the officials couldn't see it.

A.107:  Yeah, usual-, usually when that happens, and I mean, it always seems to go
the way of the ref's call though, it never seems to go the way of, you know,
either the coach, or somebody protesting.  Um,

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  But that's really I guess, what I know about football [laughter].

B.110:  [Laughter] The, uh, where do you work?

A.111:  Pardon me?

B.112:  Where do you work?

A.113:  Right now I'm not, I'm a homemaker.

B.114:  You're a homemaker.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  Well, that's work enough.

A.117:  Yeah, it sure is [laughter].

B.118:  [Laughter]  My, my wife says that is plenty work enough.

A.119:  Domestic engineering.

B.120:  Pardon?

A.121:  Domestic engineering.

B.122:  Domestic engineering, #right, right.#

A.123:  #There you go, yeah.# It's, um, I don't know, I just really had to laugh
today, I mean, the, what the subject was when I placed this call, when the
subject was football, because, uh, we had just had that on, that that was, uh,
you know, w-, year round, and I said, oh, they've got to be kidding.  I just
don't think financially they'll make a go of it.

B.124:  [Laughter].

A.125:  And then my husband said to me, well, it was somebody from the Vikings, uh,
Mike Lynn or somebody who,

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  um, was one of the promoters of that, 

B.128:  Right.

A.129:  and I said, uh, you know, wouldn't they be defre-, feating their purpose
to go away from the N F L?

B.130: Yeah, I think they would.  Uh, 

A.131:  But nobody seemed to, uh, you know, nobody just thought that, it, s-, the
motive was just another way to make a profit.

B.132:  Yeah, the Vikings to me will always be Fran Tarkenton, though [laughter].

A.133:  Yeah, actually, you know, I mean, that's just, um, that's the era I'm
talking about.

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  I mean, I remember when, uh, Gale Sayers played, 

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  I, I mean, I can reme-, that's kind of when it seems like it was [sigh],

B.138:  Any team could beat any other team in that time frame, and that's what made
it so good.

A.139:  Right.  Any probability could happen.  

B.140:  Yeah, yeah.

A.141:  I mean, now, it's just, it's, and usually it's one team that's great over
the entire season, and then,

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  it's kind of flat watching some of it.  I mean, it's, um, 

B.144:  And it's whoever has got the most money that gets the players, and so
forth.

A.145:  Right, exactly, I mean, I can remember when drafts and Heisman, I mean, I
could remem-, I mean, I just, I mean, I used to think Dorsett was good.  Now I
look at him and I think, well, why did I ever think that [laughter]?

B.146:  Well, he was good in his younger days.  He r-, --

A.147:  In his younger, yeah.

B.148:  -- yeah, he really was.

A.149:  And Walker now, I mean, I don't know if he's dried up or not, the way
they're talking that, uh,

B.150:  Well, he's, he's getting old enough to be, uh, his legs wearing out.  But
the last time I saw him play when he was healthy, he looked mighty good.

A.151:  Did he?  And who's going to quarterback the Cowboys this year?  I don't
even, is it still the blond headed guy?

B.152:  It'll be, it'll be Aikman, yeah.

A.153:  Aikman?  It, what do you think of him?

B.154:  Oh Aikman himself, if he had some talent around, I think they'd be a super
team.

A.155:  Uh-huh.

B.156:  But he can't do it by himself, he's got to have a line in front
of him that knows how to block.  Yeah.

A.157:  So you think it's the defensive element that's really lacking in the
Cowboys?

B.158:  Well, no, I think it's mainly the offense, 

A.159:  Uh-huh.

B.160:  the defense is better than the offense, really.  The, the --

A.161:  In terms of running, yeah.

B.162:  -- the, uh, offensive line, is, just hasn't been able to keep down the pass
rush at all so that Aikman's had time to get rid of the ball.  And he's been,
and the main reason he's been hurt on occasion, it's like most of them, the
offensive line didn't do it's job, he got blindsided or something.

A.163:  Protecting him.  Yeah, didn't he just go through, through some rough elbow
surgery or something about five months ago?

B.164:  Yeah, yeah, they found a whole bunch of chips in there, 

A.165:  Ooh.

B.166:  that, they though they had one chip, and they, uh, 

A.167:  Uh-huh.

B.168:  they, uh, got, I've forgotten, my son keeps up with this more than I.

A.169:  Sure.

@@B.170:  In fact, he should be on this network, he's the one that knows all about
sports [laughter].

A.171:  [Laughter] Probably my husband should be to, I just, you know you just go
through,

B.172:  Yeah.

A.173:  and you check those subjects, and you go, well [laughter].

B.174:  Right.

A.175:  There's not too much.

B.176:  Right.

A.177:  Well, listen, I won't keep you on a nice Sunday afternoon.

B.178:  Well, I appreciate the call.

A.179:  Okay, no problem, and you have a good day. 

B.180:  Same to you.

A.181:  Okay, bye-bye.

B.182:  Bye-bye.
