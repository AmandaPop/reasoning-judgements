=========================================================================

A.1:  Did I interrupt your reading schedule? [laughter]. 

B.2:  No [laughter]. 

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  Been playing on my computer. 

A.5:  Oh.  Oh.  Well, what have you read good, lately?

B.6:  Um, lately. 

A.7:  Well, not even lately.  Tell me. 

B.8:  Uh, see last book I read was a science fiction book called WEAPON. 

A.9:  Who's it by do you remember?

B.10:  Um, uh, it was his first book, I think, not very popular. 

A.11:  Yeah.  My husband is a big science fiction, uh, reader, but I don't, uh,
care for it as much.  I don't have, uh, he's a computer man, too [laughter]. 

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  I think that sometimes goes hand in hand. 

B.14:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  What books are you into?

A.15:  Well, uh, I'm at a stand still right now, but we haven't lived in Charlotte
very long,

B.16:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.17:  # And # so, uh, and our furniture is stored somewhere else, so I've had a
lot of time.  I've read a lot of books.  But, and this is one group of books
if you've read that I, I guess I started reading them two or three or ago,

B.18:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.19:  # by # Jean Auel, the first one was CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. 

B.20:  No.  I sure haven't read that. 

A.21:  Oh, gosh.  That is wonderful. 

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  And then the second book of hers was VALLEY OF THE HORSES.  And the third
one was the MAMMOTH HUNTERS,

B.24:  Huh-uh. 

A.25:  Are they sounding familiar?

B.26:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.27:  And her last one which, which I think everybody waited about a year or two
for, to come out,

B.28:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.29:  # uh, # PLAINS OF PASSAGE. 

B.30:  Huh-uh. 

A.31:  But, uh, I think CLAN, and you have to read them in order.  You have to
read the CLAN, first,

B.32:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.33:  # but # that has, that is the most different book that I've read in many
many years, probably since BRAVE NEW WORLD made such an impact,

B.34:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.35:  # on me # many years ago. 

B.36:  That's a good book. 

A.37:  And my husband says so too. 

B.38:  Huh-uh. 

A.39:  The CLAN, so it's, if you can pick those up, uh, and sometimes they're
packaged together, those first three in paper back.

B.40:  Huh-uh.  Well the last good book I read would be, uh, let me think.  Uh,
the last series that I read was POWER THAT PRESERVES.  Have you ever read
those by Donaldson?

A.41:  Yes.  I have. 

B.42:  Yeah.  With the leper?

A.43:  Yes. 

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  Good. 

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  But, how, uh, do you read more realistic books, perhaps. 

B.48:  What do you mean?

A.49:  Self improvement or,

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # How-to # books. 

B.52:  Lot of computer books, I guess. 

A.53:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

B.54:  I'm into ((neural networks)) and,

A.55:  (( )).

B.56:  artificial intelligence. 

A.57:  Um, I'm, I'm sorry. 

B.58:  ((Neural networks)),

A.59:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.60:  # And # artificial intelligence. 

A.61:  Huh-uh. 

B.62:  Kind of what I've been studying in school and stuff. 

A.63:  Are you working or are you a student?

B.64:  Right now I'm just looking for a job [laughter]. 

A.65:  Are you?

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  Well, my husband is working, uh, temporary,

B.68:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.69:  # well, # under contract,

B.70:  Huh-uh. 

A.71:  We had moved here, after twenty years in Oklahoma.  And, in fact he started
with, I guess, um, first generation computers,

B.72:  Huh-uh. 

A.73:  Is that called mainframe?

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  And, um, he's under contract with, uh, an insurance company that has bought
many agencies, so, uh, and they really needed, he's an accountant, also. 

B.76:  Huh-uh. 

A.77:  And so they need someone to, uh, get things under control, so he's been
reading a lot about different kinds, you know, several agencies are on, um, uh,
one system,

B.78:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.79:  # uh, # some other on some other systems right now, what, not red house,
what's, what's that,

B.80:  Red house. 

A.81:  Oh, I can't, not red house.  The system, I guess, is what I'm trying to
talk.  He's converting to it and then they will convert from it to another one,

B.82:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.83:  # later # on. 

B.84:  Huh-uh. 

A.85:  But, he's, he's, you know, he, he's good at and he's probably, uh, as good
at troubleshooting as anybody,

B.86:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.87:  # that # you can find.  But anyway.  Let me, are you married?

B.88:  Oh, no [laughter]. 

A.89:  Do you have a girlfriend?

B.90:  Yes. 

A.91:  Yeah.  Well, there is a book that I want you to recommend to her. 

B.92:  # All right.# 

A.93:  # Okay? #

B.94:  Huh-uh. 

A.95:  And it's called, and I can't tell you exactly the author, I get a lot of
authors.  If I remember the title, remember the title, I sometimes forget the
author,

B.96:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.97:  # and # it's called WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE. 

B.98:  Huh-uh. 

A.99:  And I believe one, also one of the best books that I've ever read.  And
there is a series of them. 

B.100:  Huh-uh. 

A.101:  Uh, and it's either by Belva Plain, I think it was probably by Belva Plain.
But if you can just tell her to get that from the library.

B.102:  What's that about?

A.103:  It's excellent. 

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  Have you read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, yet?

B.106:  No.  I saw the movie [laughter].  Yeah. 

A.107:  Did you?

B.108:  It's a good movie. 

A.109:  Yeah.  I had, that's not my type of book, so,

B.110:  # [Laughter].  #

A.111:  # but # it is my husband's. 

B.112:  Huh-uh [laughter].  I liked the movie. 

A.113:  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, one other thing I wanted to mention too, someone a
few years ago, a dentist and his wife were getting rid of all their paper
backs that they had read within the last few years.

B.114:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.115:  # And # they were going to take them down to the Y or somewhere like that,

B.116:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.117:  # and, # and I said, well, let me have them first and go through them and
see which ones I want to read.  And they said, well, sure, take them. 

B.118:  # [Laughter].  #

A.119:  # Uh, # just take them to the Y when your finished. 

B.120:  Huh-uh. 

A.121:  And as I divided them into the books that, I, I would like and my husband,

B.122:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.123:  # picked # out the ones that he would like,

B.124:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.125:  # those # that he liked, all had similar covers. 

B.126:  Huh-uh. 

A.127:  The ones I liked had similar covers,

B.128:  Huh-uh. 

A.129:  And, and what's, what's, the more, uh, those that he liked better were
black and silver and gold and red,

B.130:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.131:  # and # I'm talking about paper backs, you know. 

B.132:  (( )).

A.133:  And I thought that was really,

B.134:  # weird.  #

A.135:  # you # know, we had two huge piles.  And all his were shiny, like
Christmas lights.

B.136:  [Laughter]. 

A.137:  And mine were just blue and,

B.138:  # [Laughter].  #

A.139:  # [Laughter]  # and all that [laughter].  Well, it's been nice talking to
you. 

B.140:  Yeah.  Thanks for calling. 

A.141:  And if I, if I didn't do anything else, I recommended a good book to
another woman.

B.142:  All right.  I'll remember that.  All right. 

A.143:  Okay. 

B.144:  Bye. 

A.145:  Good-bye.
