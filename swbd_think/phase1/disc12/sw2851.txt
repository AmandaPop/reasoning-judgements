REMARKS:        There was a lot of background noise on Speaker B's section 
and people talking.  I have indicated the places where it was clear.  
Sometimes I couldn't tell if it was noise or if they were talking.  Also, 
at the very end of the first section of the tape, it sounds like Speaker A 
says "Bye-bye" twice.  However, when listening to Speaker A's portion, only 
one "Bye-bye" could be heard.  The tape was not too difficult, but it was 
time consuming since most of the background noise could not be heard until 
listening to Speaker B's portion of the tape.  At which time I had to go 
back in and insert the appropriate markings. 

============================================================================

A.1:  All right.  Well, [noise]  uh, quite a few and they're varied.  They don't,
uh, uh, encompass, uh, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing. 

B.2:  Uh-huh. 

A.3:  But, I do, uh, quite a bit of wreath making and my dogs are my hobbies.  I
do a lot of gardening.  I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time. 

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  Now, what do you mostly do [/noise]? 

B.6:  Well, mostly right now I'm a, [noise]  I do a lot of sports and stuff like
that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible. 
We're, uh, we're about to take the kids to [noise]  go roller skating and a
birthday party and stuff,

A.7:  Oh,

B.8:  # so.  #

A.9:  # boy # [/noise]  [laughter]. 

B.10:  #Yeah.#

B.12:  Yeah.  Fun for them. 

A.13:  Yeah.  How old are they?

B.14:  Uh, I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three. 

A.15:  Well, I think that's better than having that party at home [noise]. 

B.16:  Yeah.  Well, uh, this is a friend's party and they, they rented, or, you
know, they, the party, they, uh, just rent skates and stuff for the kids. 

A.17:  #Yeah.# 

B.18:  #So,# uh [noise]  --

A.19:  And,

B.20:  -- # they're, #

A.21:  # the # --

A.23:  -- the, the skating rink does the rest practically,

B.24:  # Yeah, #

A.25:  # I # guess. 

B.26:  yeah.  Uh-huh [breathing]. 

A.27:  Boy, what a help that is. 

B.28:  Yeah [breathing].  So, uh,

A.29:  # What kind of, #

B.30:  # how long have # you lived in North Carolina?

A.31:  Well, not that long. 

B.32:  Really?

A.33:  Uh, just since October.  We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma. 

B.34:  Oh.  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  So, uh, [noise] we are, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the
country. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  But, we did spend twenty years in Norman [noise] and Enid --

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  -- and loved it. 

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  But, we needed to get back, uh --

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  -- to our older parents. 

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  But, I am loving it [noise].  The weather is divine. 

B.46:  Really?

A.47:  Yes. 

B.48:  W-, uh, [/noise] did you like Oklahoma,

A.49:  # Oh, yes.  #

B.50:  # while you # were there?

A.51:  Very much.  Yeah. 

B.52:  Um, what did you all do?

A.53:  Well, my husband was with, uh, {tape begins to be much clearer, a lot less
back ground noise and fuzz} University of Oklahoma and,

B.54:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # Phillips # University in Enid. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  And then he went with, uh, [noise]  {a squealing} a family corporation that
had, uh, has oil and ranching and varied enterprises. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  And, uh, he just quit a perfectly good job and came, we [talking] came East
[laughter].

B.60:  Really?

A.61:  Yes. 

B.62:  So, is, uh, is he working there then or [talking], 

A.63:  Yes.  Uh-huh.  He's doing, uh, quite a bit of consulting work and,

B.64:  # Oh, uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # has been # offered a permanent position and he's contemplating
[/talking]. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  He, he's liking this free time actually [noise]. 

B.68:  Oh, yeah. 

A.69:  It's just wonderful after all,

B.70:  # Yeah.  #

A.71:  # these # years of working. 

B.72:  Yeah.  Well, how did, how did you get, uh, hooked up with the T I
switchboard thing?

A.73:  Um, [talking] [noise] [lipsmack] a gal who works, uh, with T I on this
project [/noise]. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  [Bird_squawk] I think she's a temporary worker [/bird_squawk].  Uh,
[noise]  mother is my best friend [/noise], 

B.76:  # Oh, I see.  #

A.77:  # in Virginia [breathing].  # So [laughter], 

B.78:  I see. 

A.79:  we have spread the word a little bit [noise] in this part of the country.

B.80:  Uh-huh [noise].  W-, my wife has talked more than I have, uh, she's talked
to [noise]  four, five different people.  It seems like she hasn't talked to
anybody from Dallas.  In fact, she's talked to a couple of people from North
Carolina, I #think.# 

A.81:  #Really?#

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  Uh, [noise]  what is her name?

B.84:  Her name's Tina [noise]. 

A.85:  Yeah.  Well, [noise]  I haven't talked to her.  I haven't,

B.86:  # Yeah.  #

A.87:  # I # haven't [talking] talked to a Tina yet [/talking]. 

B.88:  Uh-huh.  W-, uh, the, the call was probably for her.  They wouldn't accept
my, uh, T I N number, so we put hers in.  But, uh, uh, like I said, we're
getting, [talking] getting the kids ready to go to the birthday [noise] party,

A.89:  # Yeah.  #

B.90:  # so.  #

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  But, uh, some ((of)) [/noise], yeah, I, [child_talking] I've only talked to
one or two [/child_talking] and they've, they've all been in Dallas.  But, she
hasn't talked to anybody,

A.93:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.94:  in Dallas, yet.  So, that's interesting. 

A.95:  Well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in. 

B.96:  Well, the sport I like best probably is basketball.  But, uh, I guess I'm
probably better at softball.  And so I'd, like during the summer months it's,
occupies quite a bit of my,

A.97:  # Yes.  #

B.98:  # time.  # But, I play in a couple of leagues and, and occasionally in a
tournament or something on a weekend.  But, my family usually goes with me.  We
try to do everything we can together. 

A.99:  Well, I think that's, uh, easy entertainment for a,

B.100:  # Yeah.  #

A.101:  # family, # too. 

B.102:  Yeah.  Well, they, uh, a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams,
we, uh, that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff, and
they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age.  So they play together,

A.103:  # Under the stands.  #

B.104:  # pretty well and, #

A.105:  Under the,

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  bleachers. 

B.108:  Yeah,

A.109:  # [Laughter].  #

B.110:  # pretty # much.  And, uh, Tina enjoys, uh, [noise] the other lady,

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  real well.  So they, you know, that's kind of nice.  It's like getting
together with,

A.113:  # Yes.  #

B.114:  # them.  #

A.115:  Well, it's getting,

B.116:  # So to speak.  #

A.117:  # a little hot, # isn't it? It,

B.118:  Yeah.  Well, it's been raining a lot here so far.  So we haven't really had
any kind of real heat.  I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon, we
were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in, in the house.  So, it looks
like an air conditioner,

A.119:  # Yeah.  #

B.120:  # day.  # But,

A.121:  It sure does.  Or maybe this evening anyway. 

B.122:  Yeah.  It, yeah, but, you know, I'm sure you're familiar with that living,

A.123:  # Very, #

B.124:  # here.  #

A.125:  much so. 

B.126:  We go, we go through Enid, you know, quite a bit.  We go to Tulsa from time
to time.  And my, my parents live in southern Illinois.  So, we drive,

A.127:  # Yeah.  #

B.128:  # up # there.  And, well, l-, lot of times we take seventy-five and, uh, it
seems like, seems like that goes through Enid,

A.129:  No. 

B.130:  I know,

A.131:  No it doesn't. 

B.132:  I've either seen the signs or,

A.133:  Enid is, uh, it's in the northwest.  It's, uh, directly across the
straight, uh, state from Tulsa.  #Uh,#

B.134:  #Um.#  I know I've seen,

A.135:  Sure you have.

B.136:  the sign somewhere. 

A.137:  Yes.  Well, Enid is,

B.138:  Yeah. 

A.139:  not, uh, an unknown little city.  It, uh --

B.140:  Right. 

A.141:  -- an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there.  And it,

B.142:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.143:  # was, # uh, a very, uh, self-sufficient, uh, wealthy [noise], uh, town,

B.144:  Uh. 

A.145:  for a long time, anyway [laughter].  You know [noise], 

B.146:  Uh-huh. 

A.147:  until, uh, everything happened, the bottom fell out.  But,

B.148:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.149:  it's beginning to do well.  But, there's a lot of, uh, [talking]  old time
wealth there that,

B.150:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.151:  has helped to stabilize things. 

B.152:  Uh-huh.  So, uh, [noise]  how l-, you said you've just lived in North
Carolina just like,

A.153:  # Si-, #

B.154:  # six # months then is,

A.155:  Yes.  Something like that. 

B.156:  And you really like,

A.157:  # Oh.  #

B.158:  # it # there, huh? I've heard so many people talk about that area.  I've
never been there --

A.159:  Well --

B.160:  -- but they sure,

A.161:  -- # it's, it's [talking]  {female and children in the background}, #

B.162:  # say it's pretty.  #

A.163:  pretty.  The weather is wonderful.  Uh, this winter [noise] we, it was
just, we had so many wonderful days.  And,

B.164:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.165:  # uh, # I, if it got to be forty degrees, I decided it was too cold to, to
walk the dogs [laughter].  Isn't it,

B.166:  Uh-huh. 

A.167:  funny how [laughter],  how,

B.168:  Yeah. 

A.169:  your standards change [laughter]? 

B.170:  Yeah.  It really does.  My wife and I spent a couple years, uh, [noise] 
doing church work up in the state of Washington right,

A.171:  # Yes.  #

B.172:  # on # the coast.  And it rains,

A.173:  Sure. 

B.174:  you know, a lot there.  But, you get used to it.  I mean, it's like a fine
mist all the time and it doesn't really, it gets to where it doesn't bother,

A.175:  Well,

B.176:  you. 

A.177:  Carolina, this part, is very much like that, too.  Very,

B.178:  Really?

A.179:  foggy and,

B.180:  It,

A.181:  misty.  The moss grows,

B.182:  Uh-huh. 

A.183:  on the trees [/talking] in the woods up (( )),

B.184:  Right. 

A.185:  eight, ten,

B.186:  Right. 

A.187:  feet. 

B.188:  Yeah.  That's the way it is, was, # there, too.  #

A.189:  # Yeah.  I # think, however, that's like February.  Uh, I know it did it
all February.  And some people said to me, "Well, that's our wintertime."

B.190:  Oh, uh-huh. 

@@A.191:  Well, I know you,

B.192:  # But, #

A.193:  # need # to go.  And I've enjoyed talking to you.
