A.1:  Okay, Carla, can you tell me, uh, uh, what type of movies do you like?

B.2:  Uh, well, I like, uh, I guess I like all kinds of movies, but the ones I
don't like are kind of like Monty Python, that type of thing, but, I like all
kinds of movies, I like to see movies when they come out and, uh, I generally
prefer watching movie that is have the stars that I like, like Arnold
Schwarzenegger and that type thing. 

A.3:  Oh, like the TERMINATOR or,

B.4:  Yeah.  I mean, those are kind of rough for me sometimes, but I still like
him as an actor.  So, I like watching those movies. 

A.5:  I liked, uh, when he played in TWINS --

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  -- did, did you see that?

B.8:  Yeah, I saw it,

A.9:  Which was out of character for him. 

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  You know, playing such a, a softie. 

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  Uh, I tend to, uh, I like the lighter movies myself, [talking] rather than
the, uh, the, uh, tear jerkers, I think, uh,

B.14:  Yeah. 

A.15:  At least for me, uh, life is full of that stuff, you know --

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  -- and it needs light moments. 

B.18:  I don't really like the tear jerker type either s-, surprisingly, even
though, you know, [laughter] just seems like, I don't know, they try to make
things sad sometimes that really aren't.  I don't know why.  Did you see the
movie DAD?

A.19:  Um. 

B.20:  That was a movie that really, really was good and,

A.21:  # No.  #

B.22:  # really # got me. 

A.23:  Oh.  Who was in that?

B.24:  H-, it was the guy from CHEERS, Ted Danson, I think, was in it. 

A.25:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, okay. 

B.26:  That was so good. 

A.27:  I like him. 

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  In fact, he was up, he's, he's big into, uh, uh, ecology --

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  -- and he was up to save the bay, you know, for, uh, Narragansett Bay. 

B.32:  Um. 

A.33:  So he came, I, actually, I live in Rhode Island and I work in Massachusetts
--

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  -- because it's not far away, but, [breathing]  I live in Rhode Island, so,
but, no I didn't see that one.  I didn't, uh, we're kind of, uh, uh, we look at
the movies and we say yeah, we're going to go see them, go and,

B.36:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # we # probably we don't usually end up until, until they come out on, in
tape. 

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  And then we'll go down to the video store and rent them, and, look at them.
Uh, I like, uh [lipsmack], {pause} uh, some science fiction movies.  I liked,
uh, ALIEN.  I thought that was good.

B.40:  Oh, really?

A.41:  And, uh, [lipsmack],  uh, TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  I don't know if you, did you,

B.44:  See, I haven't seen many of those, but I do like them, I mean,

A.45:  You didn't see TWO THOUSAND AND ONE?

B.46:  No. 

A.47:  Oh, that was, that was excellent.  That was,

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  If you, if you get a chance you can, you can rent it. 

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  Uh, I like a lot of Gene Wilder.  I like him, too. 

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  I like, uh, all the stuff that he's done and Mel Brooks. 

B.54:  Yeah.  What was the latest movie you've seen?

A.55:  Uh, {pause} the latest movie was, uh, BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART TWO or
THREE, whatever.

B.56:  Yeah, I've seen all those.  Those are pretty good. 

A.57:  Yeah, I like him.  I like,

B.58:  I liked the first one best, I think. 

A.59:  They're usually, yes.  The, the first movie out is usually the best one and
then they try and do another sequels, some of the sequels,

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  Some work, but most of them don't.  I think they're trying too hard on the
pushing, but, that seemed to, that seemed to be pretty good.  I, I, I liked
that.  Uh, [lipsmack]  I haven't seen any of the real, uh, new releases.  I'm
trying to think of, uh, uh, what's out there now {pause}. Actually, not, there
isn't much of anything really.  Uh,

B.62:  Uh-huh.  I've seen, like, all the movies that come to the dollar theatre. 
There's a dollar theatre in town.  We don't really pay, uh, five bucks to go to
see a movie because they have pretty good movies, you know, not too long after
they've been out at the dollar theatre so we go there.  we used to go there
quite a bit.  We haven't been there lately very much, but, I think the last
movie I saw was AWAKENINGS [breathing].  Have you heard about that?

A.63:  Um. 

B.64:  It was more like a, it was a true, it was based on a true story.  S-, about
a, s-, about a disease that, that caused people to go into, like, total, what
do you call it, [breathing] I mean,

A.65:  Like a, like a coma,

B.66:  # Kin-, #

A.67:  # or # amnesia or,

B.68:  Kind of like a coma, yeah.  And then they came out of it.  I won't tell you
the rest [breathing]. 

A.69:  Oh! Is that, uh, [lipsmack]  uh, it was like a life after death experience,
something similar to that.  Was,

B.70:  No, that was GHOST wasn't it? [Throat_clearing].  Wasn't that GHOST? I
didn't see GHOST, but I've hear-,

A.71:  No, I didn't see GHOST either.  Uh, but I know what you mean, I, I saw, uh,

B.72:  It was based on a true story. 

A.73:  I saw the, what, this was based on a true story?

B.74:  Yeah, yeah.  Are, are you thinking of, uh, FLATLINERS?

A.75:  Yes that's,

B.76:  # That was, uh, life,#

A.77:  # the one, right.  #

B.78:  Yeah, that was good. 

A.79:  O-, okay. 

B.80:  That was real good. 

A.81:  Yeah, and they didn't want to come back. 

B.82:  Right. 

A.83:  Or, or they came back, but they weren't really back. 

B.84:  Well, they, uh, they almost didn't make it back in a couple cases
[laughter].

A.85:  [Laughter]. 

B.86:  But, uh, they came back and their lives were different after that and all
this.  It was, it was pretty, it was pretty neat. 

A.87:  Yes. 

B.88:  Have to go see it. 

A.89:  You're in, you like, you like all the Steven King?

B.90:  Yeah.  Uh, I don't like real scary movies, though, at all. 

A.91:  Yeah.  No,

B.92:  # [Laughter].  #

A.93:  # I'm # not, uh, well, ALIEN was. 

B.94:  Was it?

A.95:  ALIEN was, ALIEN was, yeah. 

B.96:  See, I'm not, I'm not really into scary.  I mean, I,

A.97:  It was, it kept you on the end of your seat. 

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  Uh, I don't like any of the CHAINSAW MASSACRES and all that kind of stuff,

B.100:  # Um.  #

A.101:  # you # know, the, the gory ones. 

B.102:  Yeah. 

A.103:  I don't care for them at all.  Uh, I just avoid all that.  Uh, and the,
like FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH and them.

B.104:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.105:  [Laughter]. 

B.106:  I've never even seen any of those, part one, or zero, or ten. 

A.107:  Yeah.  I don't like that.  But that, getting back to that theatre.  You
got, you guys got a theatre down there that it only costs you a dollar and you
can get in to see?

B.108:  Yeah. 

A.109:  Is that right?

B.110:  And they have seven movies playing at once, so it's pretty good selection.
And they're always, you know, top, top rated movies.  I mean, I've seen, you
know, quite a bit, I just saw KINDERGARTEN COP there.  I guess that was the
last movie I seen.  It was good.  I liked that.

A.111:  The, what was it?

B.112:  KINDERGARTEN COP. 

A.113:  Oh, y-, that was with, uh, that was with Schwarzenegger, too,

B.114:  # Arnold, yeah.  #

A.115:  # yeah, yeah.  #

B.116:  That was a softie movie. 

A.117:  Yeah. 

B.118:  For him. 

A.119:  That's, y-, that's right.  That's right [static].  Uh, there was just one,
there was just one out.  Well, it wasn't out, it was, uh, {pause} THE
EXTERMINATOR.  Was it THE EXTERMINATOR, or,

B.120:  TERMINATOR?

A.121:  Or THE TERMINATOR.  Right, he came back from the future. 

B.122:  Oh, uh, what was that, FLASHBACK, or something like that. 

A.123:  N-,

B.124:  TOTAL RECALL. 

A.125:  Nope, nope.  Uh, {pause} yes, yes, maybe it was TOTAL RECALL. 

B.126:  Yeah, that was tough. 

A.127:  Yeah. 

B.128:  Good movie. 

A.129:  Yeah.
