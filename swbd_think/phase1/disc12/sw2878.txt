========================================================================

A.1:  And how long have you lived there?

B.2:  I've lived in this area for about twenty-six years. 

A.3:  Okay, well you're familiar then, very well with what's going on there. 

B.4:  Yes, I am. 

A.5:  We just moved to North Carolina from Oklahoma,

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # and # I'm not yet familiar, we're out in the country a little bit,

B.8:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.9:  # so # it's a contract garbage pickup and it's all thrown together. 

B.10:  # Oh.  #

A.11:  # In # this area, they don't have that. 

B.12:  Well let me tell you what we have. 

A.13:  Good. 

B.14:  I live in a very progressive county and, uh, it has, we have for the last,
uh, year, I suppose, had, um, newspaper pickup.  But there's always been, you
know, scout troops, and that sort of thing interested in doing that,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.16:  # because # it, they ge-, earn a little money and also, you know, they were
helping the environment.  But the, um, the county government then got involved
and decided to, uh, mandate newspaper collection. 

A.17:  # Good.  #

B.18:  # And # although they're still, we still give ours to the girl scout troop
at our church, uh, they do have curbside pickup in, over the entire county for
newspapers. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  Uh, and then in addition to that they,

A.21:  Excuse me, do you have to bundle it or,

B.22:  Uh, we, we can put it in paper bags. 

A.23:  Okay. 

B.24:  That's, that makes it okay. 

A.25:  # Yeah.  #

B.26:  # Um, # they used to only re-, let you do it, uh, tied with string. 

A.27:  Right. 

B.28:  But now they do it in paper bags.  And they do say that it is paying for
itself.  Now in the actual municipality of Rockville, we moved just outside of
it five years ago, uh, they've been doing newspaper recycling even longer and
they were, they had their regular, um, garbage, or, you know, the, the (( ))
people pick it up on a separate day. 

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  And they said that was paying for itself.  It was paying the extra salaries
for those people, as well as paying, you know, the city for doing it. 

A.31:  Well good. 

B.32:  But the whole county now, and it's a large county, this is Montgomery
County, right outside Washington, D C,

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.34:  # um, # is, has begun a program to, over a period of the next year, to, um,
have all, well not all waste, but, um, plastics, um, aluminum, and other tin
cans and, uh, glass of all colors. 

A.35:  # Um.  #

B.36:  # And # it's, they, they will, you will, they will also be picked up at the
curb and it can be put together.  At one point, and we've been doing it in my
family for a while by, at fi-, at first we were doing it, um, separating it
because most of the facilities that would take it were, uh,

A.37:  # Yes, required it, yes.  #

B.38:  # required it's being separated.  # But they've got this wonderful new
facility now that separates it and they had a drawing of it, a diagram of it
in, in one of the local papers and it works, um, it's like conveyor belts, and
some of it works by gravity, and of course, you can imagine the aluminum,
because it's very light weight, um, you know, falls in one place and the glass
goes another place and other, and tin that would be picked up by metal is just
picked up, you know, some other way.  Um, and then the plastic, um, you know,
go, because it just kind of doesn't fall [laughter],

A.39:  # Right, uh-huh.  #

B.40:  # I mean # I guess it keeps going on the conveyor belt or something, I
can't remember the, the design right now.  But it's wonderful because you
don't have to separate.

A.41:  That is nice and, I've read articles here, uh, about the confusion involved
in what is to be put out and what isn't and the problems that, uh, some of the
recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the
newspaper, which they say ruins the whole batch, and, uh,

B.42:  # Yeah.  #

A.43:  # the # unacceptable plastics in with the plastics which ruins the whole
batch and I just wondered, uh,

B.44:  Well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction. 

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  They do try to say, you, you know, you should have it certain way, but, um,
on the, the slick newspaper print that comes in with, like the Sunday papers
and so on, they haven't really protested.  Magazines shouldn't be, as a rule
should not be put in, but there are always a few of those pages and they must
have a better way to do it now, because they, they haven't gotten too upset
about that in general, as long as it's the newspaper because there's not, you
know, volume wise, maybe it does have to be, you know, significant volume, um,
percentage before it's a serious problem.  In the plastics, um, the, the
county recycling where we take ours now, because we don't yet have the
curbside pickup, um, i-, th-, the, trans-, the, you know, just solid waste
transfer station, they, uh, have indicated they only want the two liter
plastic soda bottles and, or I guess any soda bottles that are plastic, uh,
caps removed, and, uh, milk cartons.

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # Um, # but in fact, there is another facility that will take other items. 
The, the, you know, there are little codes on the bottoms of these things, uh,
for plastic and they look, it's a triangle,

A.49:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.50:  # with # arrows, uh, and that indicates it can be recycled, but there are
different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about. 

A.51:  # Right.  #

B.52:  # Sometimes, # some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # some # can.  Now even our grocery stores here, we have two different
large chains,

A.55:  # Recollecting the, the plastic bags, yeah, we've, #

B.56:  # that, of the plastic bags.  But you # see, I'm, I have a problem with
that, I'll take them occasionally, but I've decided that I will only ta-, use
paper,

A.57:  # Right, uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # which we # are, we do get a choice because I know that's biodegradable. 
Plastic isn't, they can reuse it, but it's really not biodegradable. 

A.59:  Right, # right. # 

B.60:  # So, #

A.61:  Well we've had, we've been collecting papers here and w-, uh, as new
residents we don't have affiliation with, uh, scout troops and, and all that. 

B.62:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.63:  We had a difficult time finding in Charlotte, uh, a place to finally put
them, which surprised me.  And I thought they would be --

B.64:  Huh, yes, I am surprised, yeah. 

A.65:  -- uh, located throughout the city and we've called and finally found one
but it's about, uh, fifteen miles away. 

B.66:  Oh, not very convenient then. 

A.67:  # No [laughter].  #

B.68:  # Well what # part, do you actually live in Charlotte proper. 

A.69:  No, right outside, north of, uh, of Charlotte, near the university. 

B.70:  Because my sister lives in Matthews, which I think is a little south of
Charlotte. 

A.71:  Is south and, and east, yes, right. 

B.72:  Yeah, well actually it's called Charlotte, now, they used to be called
Matthews where she lives [laughter]. 

A.73:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.74:  # They # incorporated it, but, um, I, I was thinking, that, you know, #I, I
don't know what she does with hers either.# 

A.75:  #Well how active, how active are the schools there?# I'm, I'm an old person
Linda, grew up, uh, during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil, and
string,

B.76:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.77:  # and # everything else and, uh, did it through the school systems and I've
wondered if they're really active. 

B.78:  Well it's, it's not taken on there as well, although the young people, I
work in the school system, so, I teach in, in the high school,

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.80:  # um, # the, uh, we have an environmental club which has just begun at our
high school this year and I think maybe the young people are becoming more
conscious of the need, um, of course it's going to get down to, if it's not
made easy as I just described the way they're going to do it in this county,
uh, they're making it so easy that you almost can't miss,

A.81:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.82:  # uh, # doing it, but because you don't have to separate and all that, but
that seems to be the only way that it'll ever really take off, is if it's not
too complicated, 'cause people in general are just lazy and in the schools
they are trying to make students more conscious and, uh, but I think the
adults are the ones that have to lead the way.  And, they have required the,
the students in the cafeterias to recycle.  But of course, you know, tha-, it
doesn't go all the way, they, they make the effort, they try, but I think as
the younger children come on, maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it
and eventually,

A.83:  That, that was sort of my point too, in addition to being a, a good focal
or central collection point, it does raise the awareness, if you do it through
the school system and,

B.84:  Yes, yes, it does.  Uh, w-, because they, they recycle the Styrofoam
because that's what most of the, uh, you know, the little trays that they have
their dinn-, you know, we used to use those heavy, uh, plastic, or whatever
they were, metal even, trays in, in the cafeterias in our schools but,

A.85:  # Right.  #

B.86:  # but # now they have these, plastic, these Styrofoam ones like they get at
McDonald's kind of, and, um, and those are being,

A.87:  Uh-huh.  Probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves
[laughter]. 

B.88:  Isn't it awful now but, do you know that um, um,

A.89:  # McDonald's is doing, uh-huh, right.  #

B.90:  # McDonald's is phasing them out, # and, uh, they're supposedly going to
try to recycle those that are still left.  We're talking about,

A.91:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.92:  # two jillion, # I'm sure.  So, event-, it will take a time, but, um, I, I
just worry about what's going to happen to the next generation, um. 

A.93:  Uh, no-, uh, how do you feel about the high schools that you, you teach.
Do you feel that they have the right, I,

B.94:  # Well, many of them do.  #

A.95:  # I get mixed emotions when # I see a bunch of, uh, youngsters throwing
things out of the car versus,

B.96:  # I know, oh! #

A.97:  # the-, they're talking # about environment [laughter]. 

B.98:  But, yeah, exactly [laughter].  That does seem a little bizarre. 

A.99:  # Right.  #

B.100:  # Um, # I, I find that there is a percentage of, of, uh, the student body,
uh, that is a, a, aware, active and interested.  There is, uh, a much larger
percentage, still that it hasn't quite, you know, taken yet.  Um, but, I think
they're becoming more aware.  I think what will make the change is um, enough
of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it, those
are going to have to [laughter] ridicule,

A.101:  Right, peer pressure is a big one, yeah, uh-huh. 

B.102:  peer pressure, or something, yeah, to, to kind of make the effort, um. 

A.103:  Well I,

B.104:  # But I, I'm hopeful.  #

A.105:  # yes, I am too, # I am too.  Well, Linda I enjoyed talking to you. 

B.106:  Well I enjoyed talking to you and I w-, I wish you luck there in Charlotte.

A.107:  Thank you.  Uh, bye. 

B.108:  Bye-bye.
