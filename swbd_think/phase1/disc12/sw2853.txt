========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  Wasn't the Mayor of New York arrested for cocaine abuse or was
that somebody else?

B.2:  No.  That was D C. 

A.3:  D C. 

B.4:  Yeah.  It was Mayor of D C. 

A.5:  I couldn't figure out if, well, Koch is New York, isn't he?

B.6:  Yes.  He is. 

A.7:  Okay. 

B.8:  But, it was, uh, Mayor Berry. 

A.9:  Yeah.  Berry.  Yeah. 

B.10:  But, I guess, my feeling on drug testing in the work place, I am
one-hundred percent for it.

A.11:  Oh, I am, too. 

B.12:  You are. 

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  Um,

A.15:  So we have nothing to disagree about. 

B.16:  Yeah.  I know and, um, it, I, a lot of people have a, you know, problem
with the random testing.  Like why should I be tested and that person not
tested.  But the point is, is that nobody,

A.17:  They should test everybody. 

B.18:  Right.  And that, you know, it's illegal.  Maybe if drugs were legal then
this would be all different.  But drugs are illegal. 

A.19:  Right. 

B.20:  And there for it shouldn't be, it should be the law that we're able to, to
test for something that is illegal. 

A.21:  Right and most of your work places can be dangerous if somebody is using
drugs. 

B.22:  That's for sure. 

A.23:  Especially school.  I don't think there should be any kind of limits set on
any school officials being tested. 

B.24:  Huh-uh.  I agree. 

A.25:  But, you know, that commercial with the, you know, they show a woman doing
cocaine or something and then you think it doesn't affect you and then you see
her, she's driving the school bus. 

B.26:  Yes.  Oh, I love that commercial.  I know, that one is really powerful. 

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  But, you know, um, not even the interaction with people like one on one,
but, I guess, this relates to the school bus, but people in warehouses that are
driving forklifts,

A.29:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.30:  # you # know, that, um, they're could be some serious accidents. 

A.31:  I know it. 

B.32:  That's really.  That is a shame. 

A.33:  Well, and like at T I, do you work at T I?

B.34:  No.  I don't. 

A.35:  Okay.  Well, at T I, you're messing with all those chemicals and stuff,

B.36:  # Yeah.  #

A.37:  # and # if you mix the wrong chemical, whatever, it can put out toxic
fumes,

B.38:  What is the policy at T I, do you have to be drug tested or,

A.39:  Um, well, I worked there for a while, Manpower employee, and I was tested,

B.40:  Oh, that's where I work.  I work at Manpower. 

A.41:  You do? 

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  Where are you working at then?

B.44:  Well, I work for Manpower.  I mean, I supervise the office. 

A.45:  Oh, okay. 

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  Huh-uh. 

B.48:  So you were a temporary working at T I?

A.49:  Huh-uh. 

B.50:  Oh, neat. 

A.51:  Well, I quit when I found out I was pregnant. 

B.52:  # Oh.  #

A.53:  # I # was just really scared of messing with the chemicals. 

B.54:  Yeah.  I don't blame you. 

A.55:  And, uh, T I is strict on their chemicals, but they don't really, I don't
know, I just didn't feel safe. 

B.56:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.57:  # messing # around it. 

B.58:  But you had to be drug tested before,

A.59:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.60:  # you could, #

A.61:  Yeah.  Manpower did it. 

B.62:  Huh-uh. 

A.63:  So. 

B.64:  That's interesting.  Um, here, you know, Kodak is a big name in Rochester. 

A.65:  What is that?

B.66:  Kodak. 

A.67:  What is that?

B.68:  What is Kodak. 

A.69:  Oh, the film. 

B.70:  Yeah, the film, right. 

A.71:  I'm sorry. 

B.72:  No, it's okay. 

A.73:  [Laughter]. 

B.74:  But, um, in Rochester everything is Kodak, but, you know, but, half the
population works for Kodak.  And usually they set the trends and originally,
um, it was only the people that were working in the industrial type of
facility that needed to be drug tested.

A.75:  Huh-uh. 

B.76:  Because they felt that if they were using drugs, they would be the most
dangerous, versus office type workers, who probably, I don't know, what, they,
they never saw what sort of problem they could have if they were using drugs, I
guess, I don't know.  But, um, just in nineteen, nineteen eighty-nine they
started testing everybody.  So now, anybody, whether you want to go in and work
in the cafeteria or,

A.77:  Can they spot test you?

B.78:  Yes, they can. 

A.79:  Okay. 

B.80:  But they can't do it more than once a year.  I think. 

A.81:  Huh-uh. 

B.82:  You can't be tested more than once a year.  Would they spot test at T I?

A.83:  Yeah, they'll do it anytime.  I'm not sure what limits they set on it.
But, I know that you had like eight hours to go,

B.84:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.85:  # in # and do it. 

B.86:  Oh, well. 

A.87:  Between the time you were told,

B.88:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.89:  # and # the time you had to be tested. 

B.90:  That's good.  Well, um, the thing you brought up about Mayor Berry,

A.91:  Huh-uh. 

B.92:  You probably seen the clip on the news.  The one where he's, um, going into
that room and making the deal with somebody. 

A.93:  Right. 

B.94:  Did you see that? Well, the, you know, he got, he got acquitted or whatever
the term is,

A.95:  # Acquitted.  #

B.96:  # Yeah, # he was, um, the charges were removed.  That to me is so,

A.97:  That's political. 

B.98:  Oh, I know, and it's so absurd, because now kids are going to see that, and
say, oh, look, he got off the hook, I'll get off the hook, too. 

A.99:  Well,

B.100:  You know,

A.101:  In that, uh, book that Kitty whatever wrote,

B.102:  # Yes.  #

A.103:  # saying # President Reagan, can you see the President being tested. 

B.104:  Oh, I know [laughter]. 

A.105:  No, he wouldn't be tested [laughter]. 

B.106:  Yeah.  That's true. 

A.107:  Which, I don't know how true that is, but I thought that was kind of,

B.108:  Really. 

A.109:  Yeah.  Well, but,

B.110:  I think everybody should.  I think it should become just a standard law. 

A.111:  Well, even office workers, I mean, you could play with computers and lose,
what, all kinds of,

B.112:  # Sure.  #

A.113:  # information, #

B.114:  # Yeah.  #

A.115:  # if # you're just not careful. 

B.116:  That's true. 

A.117:  I'm not, I'm not even, uh, all that great with computers, but I know, just
one mistake you can lose the whole record. 

B.118:  Huh-uh. 

A.119:  I can't even remember the word.  Program. 

B.120:  Program.  Yeah.  But, um, I think that your point about schools is, um,
probably the first place to start, because there is one that are in influencing
the new generation. 

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  You know, they are going to become the people working in those companies. 

A.123:  When I first started looking for work there wasn't any drug testing. 

B.124:  Huh-uh. 

A.125:  And I'm twenty six, now. 

B.126:  Huh-uh. 

A.127:  And it seems like they've always, every, every job you go for you have to
be tested.

B.128:  Yeah. 

A.129:  So I think that's good.  See, I've never used drugs personally so,

B.130:  Huh-uh.  No, me either. 

A.131:  And I don't really want to be under the influence of somebody that is. 

B.132:  Right. 

A.133:  Especially, I could see a supervisor going nuts because, well, they do go
freak out over anything,

B.134:  # Oh, I know. #

A.135:  # you know.  #

B.136:  It's crazy.  And it makes me so upset to hear about all these movie stars
and T V stars that have gone through some sort of rehabilitation,

A.137:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.138:  # and # because, um, I guess, those people are so glorified,

A.139:  Right. 

B.140:  You know, they're, the, the sitcoms on T V that's like perfection and then
to find out that, um, Michael J.  Fox, you know, went through three years of
using cocaine,

A.141:  He did.  I didn't know that. 

B.142:  Yeah.  He did.  I just read an article about that.  Um, it just shatters my
whole feeling about him.  And, and then I just think about the kids that
glorify him or the, you know,

A.143:  # Right.  #

B.144:  # just # idealize him, or whoever,

A.145:  Well, most of the kids growing up in entertainment business do have
troubles because they're in on the fast lane or whatever.

B.146:  Yeah.  And they have the money. 

A.147:  Yeah. 

B.148:  You know, they don't have to worry where they're going to,

A.149:  # (( )). #

B.150:  # get the # money to pay for it. 

A.151:  Yeah.  But even if you don't have the money, people that really want drugs
will finds the money some how. 

B.152:  Unfortunately, yeah. 

A.153:  While I was in college I did a paper on that, just how many people, mostly
criminals have got drug problems. 

B.154:  Huh-uh. 

A.155:  It's one of the major reasons they're out to break into peoples,

B.156:  # Right, exactly.  #

A.157:  # houses or # whatever. 

B.158:  Exactly.  It takes over.  I even, um, I forget if it was SIXTY MINUTES or
something, where people in jail are even getting drugs. 

A.159:  Oh, yeah.  But that's always been going on. 

B.160:  I, I know and isn't that insane.  I mean, how does that happen.  It just
doesn't make since to me. 

A.161:  Well, from watching T V, the women, the women will put it in their bras or
in their mouth and kiss the men or whatever if they get a touch visit or
whatever it's called.

B.162:  God. 

A.163:  It's wild. 

B.164:  It really is crazy. 

A.165:  I wonder if they get drug tested in prison. 

B.166:  I don't know. 

A.167:  Now, I know in the army, my husband was in the army for awhile. 

B.168:  Huh-uh. 

A.169:  Well, he's in it for seven years.  They had urine tests all the time. 

B.170:  Oh, really. 

A.171:  Yes.  But they get people to do it for them. 

B.172:  What did you mean they get people?

A.173:  All right.  Say just, per se, my husband's friend knew that a pee test was
coming up.  He would ask my husband to do it for him. 

B.174:  Oh, my God. 

A.175:  Not that my husband did it. 

B.176:  Yeah.  Are you serious?

A.177:  Oh, yeah. 

B.178:  And, and it would actually work. 

A.179:  Well. 

B.180:  They could get away with it?

A.181:  Yeah.  Because well, because most of the time it was one of your
contemporaries heading it up. 

B.182:  Huh-uh. 

A.183:  Because my husband was like (( )) with his acting sergeant. 

B.184:  Huh-uh. 

A.185:  And he would, uh, I'm not saying my husband did it,

B.186:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.187:  # but # he's told me it's went on.  But his buddy would be coming through
the line, hey, Ken, I can't do this, can you do it for me.  You know, and like
I said, it's all his contemporaries and his friends there, so he just, he was
in command or whatever,

B.188:  Right. 

A.189:  So, you know, that happens.  I mean, sure that happens a lot. 

B.190:  Oh, gosh.  That is really scary. 

A.191:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

B.192:  It's really scary to think that, uh, some of these guys,

A.193:  It's not a lot of them because not all of them have the nerve to do it. 

B.194:  Right.  That's true.  But it could just take one that is in charge of a, a
cannon or a gun or something. 

A.195:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Most of, of the time if they fire, well, no they do
fire on practice ranges, but there's usually lots of room for it, too.

B.196:  Right. 

A.197:  But if you get caught you get busted out of the army and they can send you
to Leavenworth, so. 

B.198:  They cannot. 

A.199:  Leavenworth, that the,

B.200:  Is that is prison?

A.201:  Huh-uh. 

B.202:  Oh, yeah. 

A.203:  It, I think it's a government prison for like treason or,

B.204:  Huh-uh.  I see. 

A.205:  The base my sister was on had a prison of their own which they, they,
they're pretty strict in the Army. 

B.206:  Yeah. 

A.207:  If you get caught doing much of anything you get busted.  So a lot of
people won't do it.

B.208:  Well, they need to be pretty,
