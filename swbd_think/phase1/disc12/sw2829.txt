A.4:  Hi, Tonya.   

@B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  Tonya listen, uh, there's only one show as far as I'm concerned.

B.7:  Okay.   

A.8:  STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION.   

B.9:  [Laughter] You sound like one of my best friends, 

A.10:  [Laughter].  

B.11:  her, hers,  

A.12:  No, I like your pessimism.  

B.13:  heartthrob is STAR TREK and all of those space movies.   

A.14:  Yeah, hey,  

B.15:  Uh-huh.   

A.16:  have, have you watch th-, th-, th-, the NEXT GENERATION?   

B.17:  No I haven't.  I've was never really into STAR SEARCH.   

A.18:  We-, we-, STAR SEARCH, it wasn't.  

B.19:  I mean STAR SEARCH, STAR TREK [laughter].   

A.20:  Really STAR TREK.   

B.21:  Uh-huh.   

A.22:  We-, well, this is, this, this cannot be compared to old the old STAR TREK.

B.23:  Okay.  Is,

A.24:  Can't be compared at all.   

B.25:  Is it better in your opinion?   

A.26:  Oh, much better. 

B.27:  Uh-huh.  What's better about it?   

A.28:  Uh, well, it's, it's, it's, it's better put together bet-, better dialogues
th-, the, uh, th-, the stories are a little deeper, and,

B.29:  Uh-huh.   

A.30:  and, and the, the technology of course, that they use is much more
believable from a, from a scientific aspect also they're, they're much more
sound about what they say and do.

B.31:  Is it much more believable.   

A.32:  Oh, yeah.   

B.33:  Sounds like I would, I would probably like that better then the, old STAR
TREK.

A.34:  Oh, it's got, got a lot more credibility than, 

B.35:  Okay.

A.36:  than the others, also they, they, they touch, you know, a, a lot of
issues that are, are quite relevant,

B.37:  Uh.   

A.38:  you know, and, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it.   

B.39:  Maybe I ought to try it out sometimes.   

A.40:  Hey, try it out.   

B.41:  [Laughter] Uh, 

A.42:  Then, then the following night you can watch MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.

B.43:  Right, you like that show?   

A.44:  Well, yeah.   

B.45:  Yeah, yeah, I like that.   

A.46:  [Laughter].   

B.47:  Um, I don't watch a whole lot of television but when I do I like just a lot
of sitcoms cause I look at television myself as kind of a get away,

A.48:  Yeah, well that.   

B.49:  I don't, I don't like to watch a lot of serious movies,  

A.50:  Uh-huh.   

B.51:  not on television anyway.   

A.52:  Yeah.   

B.53:  Uh, when I watch T V, I like to kind of getaway kind of laugh and that's,

A.54:  Well, sure.   

B.55:  I like even to watch the sitcoms.   

A.56:  It's a, it's a good escape.   

B.57:  Uh-huh.  Right now I'm watching, uh, the WONDER YEARS.   

A.58:  THE WONDER YEARS.   

B.59:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.60:  That's a good show.   

B.61:  Yeah, and I like that because the, you kind of get to think along with the
characters.  Yeah, you know so,

A.62:  Yeah, well, uh, you don't sound old enough.   

B.63:  No, huh-uh.   

A.64:  To, to [laughter], to go back that far [laughter]. 

B.65:  Uh-huh [laughter].   

A.66:  Uh, I am unfortunately.   

B.67:  Okay.   

A.68:  Uh, so [laughter], I was there during the sixties and I, that's, that's
what I love about the show,

B.69:  Oh.   

A.70:  it brings back a lot of memories.   

B.71:  Uh-huh.   

A.72:  And it's, it's, it-, it's amazingly accurate.   

B.73:  Uh, I was going to ask if it's, if it's accurate for you, uh-huh.

A.74:  Oh, yeah, yeah it, it, it really is.   

B.75:  Cause I really can't, I guess I can't tell [laughter] but I, I enjoy
watching it and I think we learned a lot from it.

A.76:  Well.   

B.77:  We learned how it was back, back then and, you know.   

A.78:  Yes, yes, well,  

B.79:  ((Because it's)), 

A.80:  well it, it is, 

B.81:  It-, 

A.82:  it is accurate there's, there is, um, the, the latter part of the sixties
was totally dominated by Vietnam.

B.83:  Uh-huh.   

A.84:  And, uh, those issues,  

B.85:  Right.   

A.86:  and I mean, you know, it was everywhere and, and that is the one thing
that I notice I sort of shy away from a little bit.

B.87:  Um. 

A.88:  I mean [noise] they hit it a little it but,  

B.89:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.90:  don't you know, it was in everything, at the time I was in, 

B.91:  Uh-huh.   

A.92:  college and, and it totally dominated college but, uh,  

B.93:  Right.   

A.94:  a-, at one point, uh, before nineteen, what was it I guess it was
seventy, you know, uh, when they enacted the, the, what they called the
lottery,

B.95:  Right.   

A.96:  of the draft in which, um, you know, uh, everyone's birthday was chosen
it was chosen at random and only the first third of those were taken.

B.97:  Uh-huh.   

A.98:  And, and, would be inducted into the, you know, Army, 

B.99:  Right.   

A.100:  the Army was the only one that accepted towards the end.   

B.101:  Right.   

A.102:  And so, um, you know, it, it, it really was terrible because, uh, un-,
until that it, every one was going crazy at least,

B.103:  Uh-huh.   

A.104:  when they, they did the lottery only one-third of the people were going
crazy,

B.105:  Right, right.   

A.106:  because they were going to have to go and it a war that was really quite
unpopular but,

B.107:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.108:  It was kind of crazy.   

B.109:  Unlike this war that we just got out of here.   

A.110:  Yeah, any way so, but, but the-, they should, uh, uh, you know, maybe,
maybe hit that a little heavier on that show.

B.111:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.112:  What other shows do you watch?   

B.113:  Um, I like the Thursday night lineup on N B C, the COSBY SHOW, A DIFFERENT
WORLD, CHEERS, I really like CHEERS.

A.114:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, CHEERS. 

B.115:  And, uh,  

A.116:  I used to like the COSBY SHOW.  I've kind of gotten burned out on that.

B.117:  Yeah, I'm kind of getting burned out,  

A.118:  Yeah.   

B.119:  but I still watch it I guess just for the heck of it because I've been
watching it.

A.120:  Yeah.   

B.121:  Um, I like EVENING SHADE.  A lot of the new,  

A.122:  Yeah, I've got a friend that keeps threatening to kill me if I don't watch
EVENING SHADE.

B.123:  Yeah, that's a really good show, 

A.124:  She's, 

B.125:  that a really good show. 

A.126:  says that it's, it's a really good show,  

B.127:  And, uh, DESIGNING,  

A.128:  so I'm going to have to check it out.   

B.129:  DESIGNING WOMEN I like that a lot.   

A.130:  Yeah.   

B.131:  Uh-huh.   

A.132:  So do I.   

B.133:  Yeah, I like a lot, a lot of the newer shows I like, um,  

A.134:  Yeah, I, 

B.135:  there's,  

A.136:  I, I, I was really glad that the year that they were finally taking that
DINOSAUR off.  What DALLAS did it's last show?

B.137:  Oh, yes, that was Friday.   

A.138:  Yes.   

B.139:  In fact I went to a last episode of DALLAS party at a friend's house.

A.140:  [Laughter] Oh.   

B.141:  [Laughter] We all got together and watched the,  

A.142:   [Laughter].   

B.143:  last episode although we didn't, although we hadn't watched it in years,
you know.

A.144:  Yeah, I hear it was the dog of a show.   

B.145:  Yeah, it really, 

A.146:  [Laughter].  

B.147:  was.  I was pretty disappointed in the ending.   

A.148:  [Laughter].   

B.149:  So.   

A.150:  Oh well, go out with a whimper.   

B.151:  Yeah [laughter].  Exactly, uh.   

A.152:  I guess that's the way to go.   

B.153:  What else do you watch besides STAR TREK?   

A.154:  Oh do, is there anything else on?   

B.155:  [Laughter].  

A.156:  No, no. I, I, uh, I watch a lot of, I've got cable here so,

B.157:  Yeah.   

A.158:  I don't watch a lot of network stuff.  

B.159:  Uh-huh.   

A.160:  I, I mean, you know, the typical three networks.   

B.161:  Right.   

A.162:  I, um, I do watch a lot of C N N stuff and,  

B.163:  Yeah.   

A.164:  and, uh, uh, I'm home most of the time so. 

B.165:  Yeah.  I find myself watching a lot of C N N.  I like, they have a fashion
show on [laughter] C N N that I like to watch.

A.166:  Oh, yeah, I, I got really, I mean I, I watched it a lot before the, the
Saudi crisis,

B.167:  Uh-huh.

A.168:  but after that, uh, it just seemed like it became apart of my every day
viewing.

B.169:  Right, you feel like you really don't know what's going on unless you tune
in at least for, you know, fifteen minutes,

A.170:  Yeah.   

B.171:  or so.   

A.172:  And, that's what I like,  

B.173:  Uh-huh.   

A.174:  about it I can tune in, in any time.   

B.175:  Right, and get the, all the days events,

A.176:  And get all the, yeah,  

B.177:  Uh-huh.   

A.178:  I don't have to, you know, uh, view it at certain time of a day I can
check it out any time generally,

B.179:  Right, right.   

A.180:  and, uh, find out what's going on, and I like that,  

B.181:  Yeah.  

A.182:  I, [laughter] I remember when Turner started that thing they said that it
would never fly and for the first year or two,

B.183:  Uh-huh.   

A.184:  it really, it really sort of wallowed, but, uh, 

B.185:  Yeah, and if, and if you know notice I mean it's gone so far in the,

A.186:  Well,  the thing is,  

B.187:  just with, just with this,

A.188:  is that the world finds out,  

B.189:  Uh-huh.  

A.190:  most, I mean like, you know, it was interesting like during the Saudi
crisis,

B.191:  Uh-huh.   

A.192:  the people here were finding out about more what was happening by
watching C N N,

B.193:  Uh-huh.   

A.194:  then were getting, I mean the military folks even.   

B.195:  Right.   

A.196:  So.   

B.197:  And the, the networks themselves were depending on C N N.  

A.198:  Oh exactly.   

B.199:  For a lot of things, you know,   

A.200:  Exactly.   

B.201:  they would ma-, they would even mention C N N.  

A.202:  Yeah.   

B.203:  and have their footage on and everything.   

A.204:  Yeah, so it-, it,  

B.205:  So their going to bec-, 

A.206:  it really is becoming sort of like the world's eye.   

B.207:  Right, exactly.   

A.208:  And I, I, you know, it, it was an idea whose time had come and Turner's 
quite a character.

B.209:  Uh-huh.   

A.210:  Ed Turner.   

B.211:  Yeah.   

A.212:  Any way I really enjoy, I enjoy having access to that,  

B.213:  Yeah.   

A.214:  all of the time.   

B.215:  Yeah, I'll turn to it just every now and then and, you know. 

A.216:  Yeah, so you guys are, you, you evidently have access to the cable too?

B.217:  Yes, uh-huh.   

A.218:  Yeah.
