==========================================================================

B.1:  Uh, basically I'm at home and I have two cats --

A.2:  Uh-huh. 

B.3:  -- and my husband, I mean my husband's great. 

A.4:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.5:  It's wonderful,

A.6:  # Yeah.  #

B.7:  # you # know, and, and, uh, so I'm about forty and whatever,

A.8:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Around there, huh. 

B.9:  So, yeah. 

A.10:  Well, you're, you're just a youngster then [laughter]. 

B.11:  Yeah, I'm just a --

A.12:  I passed [laughter] the fifty. 

B.13:  -- spring chicken, I guess [laughter]. 

A.14:  [Laughter]  So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's
roles, so --

B.15:  Well,

A.16:  -- it should be real interesting. 

B.17:  Righto [laughter]. 

A.18:  So, you think we're ready?

B.19:  I think I'm ready [laughter]. 

@A.20:  Okay [beep]  okay.  Uh, you want to start off?

B.21:  Well, let's see, the changes I've seen in women's roles, uh, since I am in
the forty age, I'm a fifties baby --

A.22:  Uh-huh. 

B.23:  -- uh, and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very,
very wide, uh, it's been a big change. 

A.24:  Very much, yeah, yeah. 

B.25:  Very much, and I think you'll have to agree and --

A.26:  Yes. 

B.27:  -- and since we were in, uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of
the sixties,

A.28:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.29:  # and, and # we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be --

A.30:  Uh-huh. 

B.31:  -- uh, and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical, it has a
radical fringe to it that, uh, I've sort of backed away from.

A.32:  I think all things get started sometimes in that manner. 

B.33:  Yeah. 

A.34:  You know, they come in that way. 

B.35:  And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash. 

A.36:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.37:  But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off
the track --

A.38:  Uh-huh. 

B.39:  -- in several areas, but I really do think that women have made a
contribution --

A.40:  Uh-huh. 

B.41:  -- uh, to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have
feelings and emotions and it's okay and I think, uh, you know on the other
hand, I don't know that men have changed that much.  So in, in contrast to the
women's changes, uh, you know, the men stay steady,

A.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.43:  # and # then the women change around them. 

A.44:  I hadn't thought much about that, but that is true.  That,

B.45:  Uh, I think men are trying. 

A.46:  Uh-huh.  Some of them. 

B.47:  But they don't have a national organization of men,

A.48:  # No.  #

B.49:  # to, # uh, help them out and --

A.50:  No. 

B.51:  -- uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation,

A.52:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.53:  # where # both --

A.54:  Very much. 

B.55:  -- team, it has to be a team partnership now,

A.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.57:  # and # they both have to work --

A.58:  Uh-huh. 

B.59:  -- and they both have to raise the children,

A.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.61:  # if # we're going to have any kind of future at all,

A.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.63:  # and, # and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years. 

A.64:  Uh-huh. 

B.65:  You know, the me, oh, I don't know, the, the yuppiedom,

A.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.67:  # the # whatever it was, the, you know, women didn't know how to go about
doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men, they wanted to be like
men,

A.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.69:  # and # that's wrong. 

A.70:  Yeah. 

B.71:  I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men
[laughter],

A.72:  Not, no, they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way. 

B.73:  Absolutely, and so that's, you know, they sort of threw the thing back
another, you know, ten years,

A.74:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.75:  # that # they've had to, you know, restructure, but I saw the greatest
T-shirt the other day,

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  I got to get some for all my men friends,

A.78:  # [Laughter].  #

B.79:  # it # says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do
[laughter]. 

A.80:  There you go [laughter].  There's a lot of truth in that. 

B.81:  Right. 

A.82:  Yeah. 

B.83:  But, uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer
--

A.84:  Uh-huh. 

B.85:  -- and, you know, we shouldn't, we were made differently,

A.86:  # That's right.  #

B.87:  # however you # come to that conclusion, we were biologically,
physiologically, made differently and there is great wonderment,

A.88:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.89:  # in # that, and, uh, you know, we should respect that in each other so,

A.90:  Yes, it shouldn't be destroyed. 

B.91:  Right. 

A.92:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.93:  And, and, you know, just sort of all s-, swooshed into one channel --

A.94:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.95:  -- sort of thing, it's, it's viva la difference [laughter], 

A.96:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.97:  # someone said # that --

A.98:  Yeah. 

B.99:  -- and I think that you can truly respect the other person, I mean, you
know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, you know [laughter], 
you know.  Depends,

A.100:  [Laughter]  Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. 

B.101:  Yeah. 

A.102:  You know. 

B.103:  Well that depends on what day of the month it is. 

A.104:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.105:  But, uh, I don't know, I guess we've gotten more of a, in, in terms of
that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other --

A.106:  Uh-huh. 

B.107:  -- and our roles, and, but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and
trying to figure out those roles and,

A.108:  I think now when both are working they have a more ch-, more of a chance of
working together because they're starting out that way. 

B.109:  Yeah, well, that's, that's a very different way to do,

A.110:  # Yeah.  #

B.111:  # you # know, the woman doesn't start off at home,

A.112:  # Right.  #

B.113:  # raising # the kids and goes back into her career, you know,

A.114:  # Right.  #

B.115:  # twenty # years later. 

A.116:  Yeah. 

B.117:  Uh,

A.118:  Because you get set in your ways and it's,

B.119:  # You do.  #

A.120:  # really hard # because to, to really to get help. 

B.121:  Yeah. 

A.122:  Uh, d-, you know to get the work load shared. 

B.123:  Are, are you married?

A.124:  Yes, uh-huh.  Our,

B.125:  Do you have children?

A.126:  I, we have five children, they're [laughter], 

B.127:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.128:  They're all grown and on their own so,

B.129:  Oh, my. 

A.130:  They're, uh,

B.131:  How did you do?

A.132:  Uh, how do you mean that? [Laughter]. 

B.133:  Well, I mean, okay, well did you have boys, girls, how did, how,

A.134:  Uh, we have, uh, two girls and three boys and our,

B.135:  # Oh, my.  #

A.136:  # our baby # girl just had a baby girl [laughter]. 

B.137:  Oh, my. 

A.138:  Last week was her first baby. 

B.139:  Oh, how exiting. 

A.140:  So it's been real exciting. 

B.141:  I, I tell you what.  I don't know what I would do without my friends having
all their kids. 

A.142:  Uh-huh. 

B.143:  I just love the babies --

A.144:  Uh-huh. 

B.145:  -- and, and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that,
it's,

A.146:  Yeah.  Have you been that way long?

B.147:  Just eight years, just --

A.148:  Just eight years. 

B.149:  -- the most important years of my life you know [laughter]. 

A.150:  That's, that's a long eight years, though. 

B.151:  Yeah, it has been. 

A.152:  Uh-huh. 

B.153:  And, uh, so there have been major, major adjustments,

A.154:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.155:  # but # that's another story. 

A.156:  Uh-huh. 

B.157:  But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps, I mean I,

A.158:  That makes a big difference. 

B.159:  I couldn't ask for a better life. 

A.160:  Uh-huh. 

B.161:  I mean if this is the way it had to be,

A.162:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.163:  # this # is the best way,

A.164:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.165:  # I # could possibly do it and, and that has a lot to do with his strength
and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, you know, all, all ego
aside, do a lot of things --

A.166:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.167:  -- that really, so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at
my own backyard sort,

A.168:  # Yes.  #

B.169:  # of # thing [laughter]  and,

A.170:  Well, probably your role and, and the way you are also has changed, though.

B.171:  Oh, yeah. 

A.172:  You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago. 

B.173:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, boy, I mean I, I would have had so, I had so
much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place, you know,

A.174:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.175:  # where # I couldn't do a lot of things --

A.176:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.177:  -- and, uh, just adjusting to that,

A.178:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.179:  # that, uh, # yeah, that was a major change,

A.180:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.181:  # but # so, I guess [breathing],  uh, in the end, you know, you each take
your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can, but --

A.182:  The best you can, yeah. 

B.183:  -- but, but women I think are a whole, you know sort of riding the course,
they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there, I think the
future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care
situation. 

A.184:  I, yeah, that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and
security.  That, I think that's being damaged, uh,

B.185:  # I think, #

A.186:  # a lot.  #

B.187:  we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to
be a little bit, uh, [lipsmack]  oh, not very nurturing. 

A.188:  Uh-huh. 

B.189:  I think,

A.190:  I do, too.  I, I think, uh, now some, some women can, can do both.  They're
very capable of working and, and,

B.191:  Yeah, but I wish they weren't so many, I, I wish they weren't role models
for everybody,

A.192:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.193:  # because # it's so dangerous. 

A.194:  It, it really is, yeah. 

B.195:  It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that and then
when she can't, you know, the failure of that is,

A.196:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.197:  # you # know, her life sort of falls apart and she doesn't know who she is
and she's,

A.198:  So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,

B.199:  # Absolutely.  #

A.200:  # or # they say they do anyways, and, but I think ones that don't have to,
the, it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there. 

B.201:  Well, you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what
part of the country you're in. 

A.202:  Well, that could be. 

B.203:  Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the
south --

A.204:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.205:  -- you know, a woman's role is,

A.206:  # Uh.  #

B.207:  # a # woman's role,

A.208:  # Yeah.  #

B.209:  # sort # of thing,

A.210:  # Yeah.  #

B.211:  # and # you know,

A.212:  You ((mean)) it's stronger there?

B.213:  Uh, oh, yeah, yeah. 

A.214:  Much stronger. 

B.215:  And, and I think that, uh, [lipsmack]  you know, career women still have a
lot of problems here,

A.216:  # Yeah.  #

B.217:  # with # the good old boys,

A.218:  # Right.  #

B.219:  # here # in Texas sort of thing,

A.220:  # Right.  #

B.221:  # making # career moves but,

A.222:  Right. 

B.223:  Uh, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for
their talents, uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years.

A.224:  Uh-huh. 

B.225:  I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here. 

A.226:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah. 

B.227:  That's the woman's role,

A.228:  # Yes.  #

B.229:  # and # it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, ((watch)) her peers be
appreciated, I think sometimes, but then I'm not there, so I don't know that. 

A.230:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.231:  And I have women that do both and I see a little jealousy on the part of,
you know, the woman what has two little boys and, and she has an au pair, which
is a live-in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the
back --

A.232:  Uh. 

B.233:  -- and then my other girlfriend that has, you know, just runs the whole
household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy,

A.234:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.235:  # all the time.  # And so I see I little bit of that and I always wish
there was a balance, you know,

A.236:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.237:  # with # the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids and
the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge,

A.238:  # Right.  #

B.239:  # for # a while [laughter]. 

A.240:  But they're both,

B.241:  Get some peace and quiet. 

A.242:  Yeah, they're both different people, too.  That's,

B.243:  Yeah, definitely, so.  You're right about that. 

A.244:  That's where the trouble lies. 

B.245:  Yeah. 

A.246:  Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well,

B.247:  # And that's, #

A.248:  # and others # can't. 

B.249:  That's true.  That's so true.  How, how did your daughter do it?

A.250:  Uh, well, uh, I have one daughter that works full-time.  She has two little
boys. 

B.251:  Uh-huh. 

A.252:  And, they seem to do fine.  She has been talk-, has talked about quitting,
you know, and staying home for a few years.  But then, it's real hard because
she's got an excellent job. 

B.253:  Right. 

A.254:  Uh.
