===========================================================================

A.1:  Current events are, uh, sometimes hard to keep up with.  There have been
several days when I've been busy doing one thing or the other and don't catch
the news on the T V,

B.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.3:  # or # don't get around to a paper,

B.4:  # Uh.  #

A.5:  # and, # uh, it's, it takes a little bit of time to stay up on things. 

B.6:  # Uh, uh.  #

A.7:  # I kind # of prefer, uh, if I want to know something about a given topic,
uh, about some, some major event that's going on, I kind of prefer to go to the
public television route, uh, watch some of the, the longer expos3es on the
topic. 

B.8:  Yes, like the (( )) news hour or something, yeah. 

A.9:  # Right, right.  #

B.10:  # I think # that's, that's helpful, I think that's right.  I, I, I listen
to the evening news, you know, to get the, kind of thumbnail things, but I try
to read the paper each day, uh, covering the, the headlines and then the, in
each of the sections and then I think I enjoy the editorials about as much as
anything.

A.11:  Huh, yeah.  That's, uh, editorials give you, a, an insight into people's
perspective of, of issues,

B.12:  # Yeah.  #

A.13:  # better # than, you know, it's really funny to look at somebody an say,
well I never really thought of it that way, how could they think that way
[laughter]. 

B.14:  # Yeah, that's right, that's  right. #

A.15:  # You know, an [throat_clearing],  #

B.16:  Or, or to help you understand really how you think.  I think sometimes,
um, we're very divided about, about our feelings, about things and, uh,
sometimes the editor will help me focus, uh, you know, somebody who has thought
about it at great length in order to write something about it. 

A.17:  # Right.  #

B.18:  # usually # has a kind of, an, uh, an approach that maybe I hadn't quite
considered,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # And # I find them very interesting and helpful, I think to, uh, settling
my mind about things. 

A.21:  Right. 

B.22:  Pl-,

A.23:  The, uh, radio has become, uh, a new tool that I started using lately.  I'd
had it on the local, K R L D for a long time, but now, uh, with, uh, C N N, a
station broadcasting C N N -s, headline news,

B.24:  # Um.  #

A.25:  # just # the audio portion of it, it's a good little clip in the morning,

B.26:  # Yeah, I think, #

A.27:  # I can catch # ten, fifteen minutes of that to cover, it covers the
morning really well.

B.28:  Yeah, I used to listen a lots, when I drove, but I don't, I have eye
problems, and I don't drive now and I, I don't listen to the radio very much
just because I don't, I'm not where it is.

A.29:  Yeah, I, I keep one in most every room and I end up, uh, the mornings in
the bathroom,

B.30:  # Uh, #

A.31:  # during # the shower and the like,

B.32:  that's a good idea. 

A.33:  I can pretty well cover that twenty minute segment that C N N does in the
morning. 

B.34:  Yeah, that's a good idea. 

A.35:  And they, an if you leave out the sports, you can really get everything in
about ten minutes. 

B.36:  Yeah, [laughter]  yeah, that's true. 

A.37:  And they cover, uh, most of the nations events, especially during the war
time, as it was going on,

B.38:  # Uh.  #

A.39:  # they # keep me up to date on how my brother-in-law was doing over there
an,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # and # it was nice to hear the, the, what plane had and hadn't crashed
because he was flying them and,

B.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.43:  # Uh, # the bias, though, that I find, uh, kind of another topic the, the
bias that I find in some of the coverages, it's kind of hard on, oh, let's say
it's a major issues, to get, uh, an unbiased opinion. 

B.44:  # I think so too.  #

A.45:  # Uh, you just happen # to have a type of person that gravitates toward
that, that profession,

B.46:  # Yeah.  #

A.47:  # and # then you end up with a hierarchy in that profession that won't
promote someone with a, a, uh,

B.48:  # Different point of view, yeah.  #

A.49:  # different point of view, so.  #

B.50:  I think you have to be very careful in, i-, with the media, in tha-, for
that reason, because they, they are not, because they are very biased. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Most of them have very biased feelings. 

A.53:  # Right.  #

B.54:  # It's # hard to, hard to get one.  I'll tell you the, the, we take the
Insight magazine and I find it to be as, u-, about as unbiased as any I've
found. 

A.55:  Yeah, that's nice to have anything that will show both sides to something. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  And, uh, try their best to dedicate, you know, equal space here and there
for an issue. 

B.58:  # Yeah.  #

A.59:  # Uh, # but you know, the funny thing, the history of newspapers, uh, I was
kind of amazed, I, not being a real historian buff, I, I listened to a program
one time on, uh, I believe it was LARRY KING LIVE, was, had an old newspaper
guy on there and he was saying that, uh, the history of newspapers were to be
a hundred percent biased.  That's all they were, were that guys opinion.  He
owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in
office and he did everything he wanted to and people knew it.  People knew
that, you know, this person put out this kind of print,

B.60:  # Yeah.  #

A.61:  # and # that's what they said, that's what they felt.  Uh, and then they
slowly, you know, out of public ((cry)) changed a little bit toward being a
little more unbiased. 

B.62:  # Huh, that's interesting.  #

A.63:  # But that their # origin was, uh,

B.64:  # To be biased.  #

A.65:  # a hundred percent, # you know, I want to present this to you, and that's
what the newspaper did.  Along with a few other tidbits of obituaries and pure
factual things,

B.66:  # Yeah.  #

A.67:  # but # the majority of comment was, sheerly editorial and, and had bold
faced lies in print. 

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  Just to get the point across, you know. 

B.70:  # Isn't that interesting?  #

A.71:  # And, uh, he # was, he was giving the history of several politicians that
were ma-, made and broken by that, uh, process there, and I, I,

B.72:  Kind of a sad commentary though, when you think about it. 

A.73:  Yeah, yeah,

B.74:  # It is.  #

A.75:  # that, uh, # that that kind of power, you know, was, was at one time
flourishing,

B.76:  # Right, right.  #

A.77:  # in this # country. 

B.78:  And i-, it's such a valuable tool, and, and their should be some moral,
uh, you know, there's so many people to be duped [laughter]. 

A.79:  Yes, yes.  There is still a lot of people that believe that if it's in
print, it's gospel. 

B.80:  Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. 

A.81:  But, uh. 

B.82:  That's too bad. 

A.83:  Yeah, it is, it's kind of, uh, T, they mentioned T V, radio, and newspaper
as just, uh, uh, and then friends and the like.  I still get a little bit of my
information from magazines, uh, especially if it's a technical nature, and
professional nature, as it were. 

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  Uh, if you're going to catch up on what the latest developments are,
mechanical design wise, or car wise, or anything like that,

B.86:  Yeah that, that's true, that's good source of really good information
usually. 

A.87:  And I guess the housekeeping realm still gets its main articles from the
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING style magazines. 

B.88:  Yeah, yeah, I think that's right, I think that's true. 

A.89:  So, especially as fast as they can print these things these days. 

B.90:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

A.91:  # Some of # my stuff comes every two weeks,

B.92:  # Yeah.  #

A.93:  # and # then, it's a lot of material. 

B.94:  Well that's true, be awful if you couldn't read isn't it. 

A.95:  # Yes, that's true.  #

B.96:  # I, I've learned # to appreciate that.  I've had some eye problems in the
last four or five years, and there are times when I couldn't read for one
reason or another and it's a re-, it's a, it's awful the, so the printed, the
printed or whatever, word is really a valuable thing to us, even though
sometimes it may be slanted.  I think you need to learn to think and
understand that you have to interpret, and stand up for yourself.  Decide what
you think and make decisions.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm calling here from work and I've got another call coming
in,

B.98:  #All right, good to talk to you.# 

A.99:  #so I'd better let you go.#  #Okay, bye.# 

B.100:  #Uh-huh, bye now.#
