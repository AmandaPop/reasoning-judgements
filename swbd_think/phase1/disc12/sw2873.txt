==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, Clarice, uh, what's your favorite basketball team?

B.2:  Well, probably the one that plays here. 

A.3:  The Mavericks?

B.4:  The Mavericks.  Uh,

A.5:  # Yeah.  #

B.6:  # they're # not doing the greatest that I've seen them play before but, uh,
well, they're doing okay. 

A.7:  Yeah.  They didn't quite make the playoffs, though. 

B.8:  No, no.  I, I think without, uh, Roy Tarpley, they're, he, he added
something to the team.  But, uh, I think they need to let him go, maybe. 

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  He doesn't seem to, course I have a lot of players that I think are really
super.  I think Isaiah Thomas is just great --

A.11:  Yeah. 

B.12:  -- and, uh, I think, uh, he, he does really well.  I like to watch him
play.  He just has a really good ((moves)).

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  And, uh, [lipsmack]  I don't know, I, I guess, uh, uh, I guess I like to
watch the mailman play for the,

A.15:  # Yeah.  #

B.16:  # the # Utah team. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  Uh, when he delivers, he does okay [laughter].  And, uh, uh, I can't think
of the name of the team that has Larry Bird on it. 

A.19:  Oh, the Celtics. 

B.20:  Oh, the Celtics.  I like to watch them play, the whole team.  I like their
whole team. 

A.21:  The, they are a team is what's really good about them. 

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  They just, uh, work the ball and, uh, [breathing]  pass around, and make
each other look good. 

B.24:  Uh-huh.  I, you know, like I said, I like Isaiah Thomas, but I think
sometimes that, uh, that, uh, he, he sometimes ends up being a one man team. 

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  Uh, whereas the Celtics, like you said, they play more as a team. 

A.27:  Makes it,

B.28:  # Uh, #

A.29:  # little # more fun to watch at times. 

B.30:  Yeah.  I like Michael Jordan a lot, too [door]  [squeak]. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  He's really good.  Uh, Danny Ainge. 

A.33:  You like Danny Ainge?

B.34:  I like Danny Ainge okay. 

A.35:  Why do you like Danny Ainge?

B.36:  Well,

A.37:  That's, that's, I mean you've named like four of the top names in the game
and then you come up with Danny Ainge. 

B.38:  Well, I guess because he played at, at my alma mater [laughter],  so I, I
kind of watch him every now and again. 

A.39:  Did he play B Y U?

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  Oh, you went to B Y U, huh?

B.42:  Yeah,

A.43:  # Okay.  #

B.44:  # and # he played really well when he was there so,

A.45:  Yeah. 

B.46:  Uh, it's, it's hard to, name him with some of the very top players, I think
sometimes, but I'm glad he's playing in the, in the pros. 

A.47:  Yeah, he's, uh, well I have nothing against him, I just, uh,

B.48:  You just wondered why I named him [laughter]. 

A.49:  I wondered, yeah, I wondered, everybody has their, their favorite, you
know, maybe not the [breathing], the big name player, but, uh, yeah, he's
playing a vital role.  He, he's playing for Portland.

B.50:  Portland, uh-huh, right now. 

A.51:  He's playing for Portland, he's, I mean he's coming in and doing a good
job.  He's, it was a great trade how they got him. 

B.52:  Yeah.  They, yeah, I, I liked when he, uh, he was playing with Celtics and
then he traded to Portland. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  And, uh, it was a good trade so,

A.55:  Seems like, uh, I don't know if it's mainly because of him, but it seems
that he plays for top teams and, uh, you know, contenders, he might have, did
he go straight from Boston to Portland, or did he --

B.56:  Uh,

A.57:  -- hit another team on the way?

B.58:  I don't remember.  I really don't. 

A.59:  But, uh,

B.60:  It seems like he went straight there, you know. 

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  Because I don't remember him playing for another team other than straight
through. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  But, uh, yeah, he's, I, I like to watch him play because he's a, yeah he's
pretty tough, you know. 

B.66:  So what's,

A.67:  # He's a scrappy guy.# 

B.68:  # your favorite team? #

A.69:  He's a competitor. 

B.70:  Do you have a favorite team?

A.71:  Oh, do I have a favorite team?

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  Uh, well I'm from Indiana so I like the Pacers. 

B.74:  Uh. 

A.75:  And, uh, I like Larry Bird because he's from the home state also. 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  I just like him play anyway. 

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  Uh, let's see.  I like the Bulls because they're from the Chicago area. 

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  And, uh, they've, uh, suffered through many a hard season before they got
Jordan. 

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  And, uh --

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  -- even then once they got him, they didn't make the playoffs for a couple
years.  They had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just
win with one player in the N B A.  You have to have a [breathing]  a, you know,
a good solid team. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  Even though one player can carry a bulk of the, of the, scoring load, you
know you have to have the other players there to complement him.  And finally
with, uh, Pippin and some of the, Horace Grant, some of the other guys are
coming right along. 

B.88:  I watched, uh, {pause} well I didn't watch them, but I, I saw in the
newspaper and on the news the playoff teams and, and without Larry Bird and,
and Michael Jordan when they got injured, you know, it was interesting I think
then how their teams did --

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  -- uh, how, it brought the scoring down a little bit, but their teams
stayed relatively together --

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  -- you know, and, so.  You know, I think sometimes it's interesting, we, we
really watch the big name players and, but, they have to have a solid team
underneath or else they really don't, don't go anywhere. 

A.93:  Uh-huh. 

B.94:  So, I, I think that's kind of the Mavericks problem.  They have okay
players, but sometimes the strongness of the team isn't together. 

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  You know, every once in a while they click during a, a game and then it
works for them [breathing],  but then it's just not always there. 

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  So I, I guess that's [laughter], 

A.99:  Well, they made a couple trades this year that, [breathing] uh, well, Fat
Lever was hurt most of the year.

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  And that, so they didn't get to reap any benefits from that.  And, uh, I
don't know how well Alex English did, but, uh,

B.102:  English did okay. 

A.103:  Okay. 

B.104:  He did okay.  But, uh,

A.105:  See, we don't have a T V so I didn't get to watch any of the Mavericks. 

B.106:  Oh. 

A.107:  I think I got to watch probably one game all year [breathing]. 

B.108:  I think Adubato as the coach of their team, uh, has done a lot for them. 

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  I think he, he's, uh, brought some strength to that team.  Uh, uh, he, he's
really trying hard.  He's a nice guy.  I like him as the coach of the
Mavericks, so.  I don't, I don't know a lot of coaches in the, in the N B A,
though.

A.111:  Well, they move around so much. 

B.112:  Yeah, that's true. 

A.113:  Can't hardly keep a one coach where he's at for very long enough to get
know who he is.

B.114:  Yeah, that's true [laughter]. 

A.115:  Yeah, I think, uh, like you said, I mean Tarpley, if he was, had his life
straightened up, he could really help a ball club, but, you know, the way he's
operating now, he's [breathing]  more of a detriment,

B.116:  # Yeah.  #

A.117:  # than, # you know, anything else. 

B.118:  I think they're, I think they'll let him go. 

A.119:  They should. 

B.120:  Anyway, I, I, uh, I like basketball. 

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  [Breathing]  It's a fun sport.  I, I like to watch it.  I like to, uh, I
guess I like it because of, of the quickness of it.  Uh, and, and I like it
because it takes, the players have to be, {pause} you know, it's not a game
where you can just not practice. 

A.123:  Uh-huh. 

B.124:  I mean they have to be on the top of their game to be in the N B A, I
think. 

A.125:  Right. 

B.126:  Yeah, or else. 

A.127:  Top physical condition, too. 

B.128:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.129:  So, do you like college basketball, high school ball, ((any other stuff))
{faint}?

B.130:  I don't watch much of that, I watch our town, Plano --

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  -- uh, Plano East is where my children will go.  I have an eleven year old
son and he plays basketball and my so-, my husband coaches his team --

A.133:  Uh-huh. 

B.134:  -- and, uh, they, uh, I think they were one off, one loss to the playoff. 

A.135:  Oh. 

B.136:  And, uh, I like to watch our Plano East Senior High boys play.  They are,
they did really well. 

A.137:  Good. 

B.138:  So, yeah.  I like, yeah, I do like the, the games.  Not only basketball,
but the other ones, too, that the high schools play.

A.139:  Yeah. 

B.140:  I keep up with that.  So,

A.141:  Yeah, I, it's fun watching basketball at all different levels.  I mean
there are benefits and, and bad points of watching it each, each different
one.  I mean you may not see a spectacular Michael Jordanish move,

B.142:  # Yeah.  #

A.143:  # from # a high school player, but, you know, it's more of an
accomplishment if, if they hit, you know, some three pointers or something.
And the game is, you know, it's just a different game,

B.144:  # Yeah.  #

A.145:  # pretty # much,

B.146:  # Yeah {faint}. #

A.147:  # but that's # sort of what makes it fun. 

B.148:  Well, you know, what I think is, you know, like Spud Webb --

A.149:  Uh-huh. 

B.150:  -- I mean, you can really, even if you're short like that, you know, in
basketball today they get these huge, tall players that,

A.151:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.152:  # that # just, a-, you know, if you want to do it bad enough, I think it's
a possibility in anybody's life.

A.153:  Yeah. 

B.154:  I-, he's s-, he really goes for it.  And he's a good little player.  So, I,

A.155:  Oh yeah, he's,

B.156:  So, I think if, if any of these boys want to do it, they really can --

A.157:  Yeah. 

B.158:  -- if that's really their dream. 

A.159:  Yeah. 

B.160:  So, takes work, though, that's the big,

A.161:  Takes a lot of working. 

B.162:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.163:  Well, Spud was just gifted with a exceptional vertical leap and that's what
[breathing]  helps him out more than anything else. 

B.164:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.165:  Plus, you know, he's, like you said, he's worked hard at it, I'm sure. 

B.166:  Well, I just think that basketball's a fun game,

A.167:  # Yeah.  #

B.168:  # and # I guess I still have to [children]  stick with the Mavericks, I
guess, as far as [laughter],
