REMARKS:        Talked over each other a lot.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, cars, you, you maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind
of car,

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  we want here [laughter]. 

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac [laughter]. 

B.6:  Hey, that sounds like a great deal to me [laughter].  You have great
aspirations [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  Well, let's see I, we just bought, uh, a seventy-three Mercedes that we
have restored --

A.9:  Oh, that's great.  I'm, 

B.10:  -- and it, 

A.11:  I'm a hobbyist too, I like to work on cars too.  

B.12:  Yeah, it has really been a lot of fun.  Uh, we found some guys that
actually, you know, worked for a Mercedes dealership and, uh, they also repair
them for other the people on their off time --

A.13:  Oh, that's good.  

B.14:  -- so have, we, we have redone that thing from stem to stern, I mean
inside, outside, you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it,
so, you know, I really haven't thought much past that [laughter] it seems
like, you know, I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again,

A.15:  Was you, why they, they didn't, 

B.16:  you know.  

A.17:  say buy it they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said,

B.18:  Maybe not.

A.19:  what would you buy, you know.  

B.20:  Yeah, that's true.  I, I don't know it just seems like, uh, you know, for
what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's
value a little bit more,

A.21:  Oh, sure,  

B.22:  than, you know,  

A.23:  a restored, 

B.24:  yeah, yeah, yeah,  

A.25:  vehicle is, is great, 

B.26:  yeah, 

A.27:  I think, 

B.28:  yeah, 

A.29:  certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good. 

B.30:  right, we, the one thing that, uh, we did decide as, it's, it's, we
wanted it to be as authentic as possible but we did break down and put a C D
player in it,

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  Well, that's great.  

B.34:  that's not quite authentic, but at any rate that, that was one thing
that I, one of the features that I did want, I'd passed up on one and put a
sunroof in it,

A.35:  Oh, yeah, you all, 

B.36:  I had to stop there.  

A.37:  done a lot more, when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.

B.38:  Yeah, well, of course, we do it ourselves but,

A.39:  Oh, okay.

B.40:  like I said, we were just lucky to find these guys that do it, you know,
they're, they just weren't really expensive,

A.41:  Oh, that is good,

B.42:  and, uh, yeah, you know, 

A.43:  acknowledgeable people.  

B.44:  right, and they work on it, so, the things that can be done here they
just come here to our home and, and work on it or work on it, so,

A.45:  That's amazing.

B.46:  yeah, it's, you know, it's really, it's really been nice.  We, uh,

A.47:  I, I do all my own work, uh, so, I, I have Chevies,

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  mostly, well, 

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  that's all I've got right now -- 

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  -- I've got three Chevy V Eights.  I'm, uh, I'm, uh, a Chevy, I'm an
American car person,

B.54:  You're an American car person.  

A.55:  but I do like Mercedes.  

B.56:  Yeah, yeah, I, I have always had an American, American car and, uh, I had a
real, real bad experience with the Cougar that I had, it was an eighty-two
Cougar,

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  and, uh, I don't know, I think it just soured me on it for some reason
because I had trouble with it starting, the engine blew up [laughter] in it, I
had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so,

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  you know, I, I thought what the heck, you know, we'll try something
different so.

A.61:  Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  and, uh, I do like the V Eight engines and I think the, I went to the
auto show with my daughter recently,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  down in Dallas and, 

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  I, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling,
engines,

B.68:  Really.

A.69:  right now, I mean, 

B.70:  Yeah, right, 

A.71:  I'm not saying that they were, 

B.72:  yeah.  

A.73:  a couple of years ago.  

B.74:  Yeah.  I would that that there's, I see a ((marked)) improvement,

A.75:  Oh, yeah.  

B.76:  you know, as far as, uh, what I've heard about performance and such, you
know, so, uh, uh, hopefully it'll stay that way, I mean, you know, I'd, I'd, I
would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already 
has --

A.77:  Oh, yeah.  

B.78:  -- you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car, but,
uh, I think,

A.79:  I, uh, you know, they said, they said what do we want to buy, I, I'm, uh,
seri-, not seriously thinking but I, I would like to,

B.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.81:  put it in that category, uh, by a Cadillac but I wouldn't, 

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  buy a new one and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy
to by a new one,

B.84:  Yeah, yeah.

A.85:  but, uh, I do look for a one year old vehicle, 

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, 

B.88:  Yeah, twenty thousand, yeah, 

A.89:  whatever.  

B.90:  yeah.  Well, that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks.  They had,
uh, and I think my, my mother drives the SeVille now that's, uh, I guess it's
a couple of years old, and, uh, she had a SeVille before that that had the odd
backs that was,

A.91:  Oh, yeah, I remember those.

B.92:  that was so, uh, yeah, yeah, and she, it final just wore out they had,
they had purchased it, I don't, can't remember how many years they had that
car, but she loved the styling of it.

A.93:  That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore.

B.94:  No, she sold it and she,

A.95:  That, since they don't make them anymore, 

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  she, that could be turned into a classic, 

B.98:  I know.  

A.99:  in, in ten, fifteen years, uh.  

B.100:  Yeah, she kept telling herself that and it's sort of a ((bone of
contention)) between she and my dad because my dad said well, just let me take
it down there and find out what's wrong with it, I mean he came back with a
new car [laughter].

A.101:  No, he wanted ((new one)), yeah, right, yeah.  

B.102:  Yeah, I think he had an ulterior motive he could just see, you know, dollar
signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went but, uh, they, they really
are nice cars, there, there,

A.103:  I'm still a full size person,

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  and I like a full size Cadillac, I, I want one of those, I think they
are, I don't know, a classic but they're,

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  certainly not, they haven't changed in about, uh, twenty years, and,

B.108:  Yeah, yeah.

A.109:  and they'll eventually phase them out and I sure would like one ever
those, uh, uh, within the next five years,

B.110:  Yeah,

A.111:  or so.  

B.112:  it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten
bigger again, you know,

A.113:  Right.

B.114:  they had, they've scaled everything down so much and, uh, I have, I
don't, I've never owned a really large car, I don't know, I think that Cougar
was the biggest thing I ever had and,

A.115:  Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too but, uh,

B.116:  Yeah, 

A.117:  I've never had a Jap-,  

B.118:  now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, 

A.119:  I've never had, 

B.120:  you know.   

A.121:  a Japanese car, I, I've had friends who had them, 

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  and I think they're a lot over ra-, and they're is just no styling to
them, you can't tell one Japanese car from the other,

B.124:  That's true,

A.125:  because they all a like, 

B.126:  that's true.  

A.127:  you know, I don't mean that as a joke, I mean, 

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  they really all look a like, 

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  and the (( )) I don't have any idea what, which car it is, 

B.132:  What is what, yeah.  

A.133:  until I look at it to see what it is, 

B.134:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.135:  and I think they have not, uh, lead the field in styling, they do have
sports cars --

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  -- but the price is way more, you can get a Cadillac for, 

B.138:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.139:  the same price as you can get a small Japanese, 

B.140:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.141:  car, it's ridiculous now.  

B.142:  Yeah.  I know that, uh, I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it
seems like all Buicks to me look alike [laughter],

A.143:  Uh-huh.  

B.144:  you know, I guess it just, uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape.
I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal and she, she's had, she's got
way offer a hundred thousand miles on it and that's what she's going to buy
again and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one
[laughter] that you've got and,

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, 

A.147:  Oh, yeah.  

B.148:  I suppose.  

A.149:  Yeah, well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show.
I, I look at the Cadillacs and boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't
even realize they made but they were,

B.150:  Really.  

A.151:  just styled so differently, 

B.152:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.153:  they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful. 

B.154:  Are they still, are what they're, what they have out for like the next
year, is everything still pretty square, it seems like the Cadillacs is one of
the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that
they make are the than maybe the ((Alliance)).

A.155:  Oh, no, they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac,

B.156:  Yeah.  

A.157:  field and they have that new, uh, it's not the big, uh, Fleetwood, the
one I want,

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  which is been the same in the last twenty years, 

B.160:  Yeah.  

A.161:  there's another one that has came out in the last two year, not the
Seville, the Seville is totally different,

B.162:  Uh-huh.

A.163:  now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.  

B.164:  Now when, when was this, was this recently?  

A.165:  Oh, yeah, it was a month or so ago.  

B.166:  Oh, okay, because I have, 

A.167:  Well, they have it every year.  

B.168:  Yeah, usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the
auto building at the State Fair and that's usually when I see anything,

A.169:  Right, 

B.170:  you know.  

A.171:  now this was, uh, in it was downtown in the, uh, Convention Center and,

B.172:  Oh, I see.

A.173:  they had all the cars they had Japanese and German cars, 

B.174:  Yeah.  

A.175:  they had the full ((range)), and they had some, they had some new cars
that weren't even out they had, uh, a new Chevy Suburban,

B.176:  Oh, really.

A.177:  truck, you know, that big, big one that was, uh, they didn't have a price
on it,

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  nor did they know had a it would cost, it had a microwave in it and
everything,

B.180:  Oh, my word.

A.181:  it was, they had several futuristic cars.  

B.182:  That's wild,

A.183:  Yeah.  

B.184:  you know, you hear about things like that and you think that can't
possibly be done, I mean, it just,

A.185:  I know.

B.186:  that's just too weird.  

A.187:  And I like engines they had a lot of broken down engin-, 

B.188:  Uh-huh.  

A.189:  not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, uh, 

B.190:  Right,  

A.191:  displayed engines, you know. 

B.192:  uh-huh, so you could tell, see the inside of them or whatever. 

A.193:  Yeah,

B.194:  Yeah.

A.195:  but, uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, you know, I mean,
certainly interested in buying a new car but again the, yeah, the American
cars were for superior in styling and,

B.196:  Yeah, yeah,

A.197:  new engines,

B.198:  well, maybe,

A.199:  and, uh, 

B.200:  somebody's finally woken up, you know.  

A.201:  I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six
cylinder engines for a while and,

B.202:  Yeah.  

A.203:  I think that, I, I would definitely buy, again there's the question are
we in the market, uh,

B.204:  Yeah.

A.205:  and I could buy anything, you know.  

B.206:  Oh, yeah, you know, if I could fine, I, I was really crazy about Jags for a
while and the convertible, had a is it X J S or something like that, and I,

A.207:  Yeah, Yeah.  

B.208:  you know, thought that's a dream car, and, and you really would have to
be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you
know.

A.209:  Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, you know, my cars
don't go to the shop, you know,

B.210:  Yeah, 

A.211:  so, uh, 

B.212:  yeah.  

A.213:  I am the kind of engineer and I've always done it myself and, uh --

B.214:  Well, that's good that you can.

A.215:  -- I've got three of them and, uh, I can't remember one, I think I had one
someone welded a muffler on for me,

B.216:  Oh, really, that, 

A.217:  in a years time, 

B.218:  oh, gosh, that's great. 

A.219:  I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just
the welding on like I said I don't do that you know.

B.220:  I think it takes a talent to do that, you know, my, my husband is, uh,
engineer but he cannot, I mean, or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with
it [laughter] that's might be part of it, but, uh, you know, we just, I just
say forget it we'll just take it in,

A.221:  Yeah.  

B.222:  and get it taken care it.  He drives, 

A.223:  I, I, 

B.224:  drives a Honda.  

A.225:  noticed that when I was a kid, uh, I was wasn't a mechanical engineer but
I worked my way through college as a mechanic so,

B.226:  Uh-huh,

A.227:  I learned early from, 

B.228:  Right.  

A.229:  fifteen on, 

B.230:  Yeah.  

A.231:  and dropped it for a long time when, 

B.232:  Uh-huh.  

A.233:  when after I got out of college and, 

B.234:  Yeah.  

A.235:  then picked it up again later on and now again, I've got three vehicles
and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you
know.

B.236:  Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider, see when I
go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well,
is this engine that I can work on [laughter] or that, you know,

A.237:  Uh-huh.  

B.238:  my husband can work on or whatever, you know so, you're, you're pretty
lucky in that respect that,

A.239:  Yeah, I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines,

B.240:  Yeah.  

A.241:  because that's what I know, 

B.242:  That's when you know, yeah.  

A.243:  and, in fact, I stock the same part, I'm like a little stock, if you,

B.244:  Uh-huh.

A.245:  brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts,

B.246:  [Laughter]. 

A.247:  for it right now, you knows [laughter]. 

B.248:  That's pretty good, it's really been funny because we have like been you
are own contractors kind of with this car and when I say we have redone
everything I mean we have done everything,

A.249:  Oh, that's great,

B.250:  and it's, 

A.251:  I've always wanted to that too.  

B.252:  it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, uh, my
husband Carl has called all over the country, you know, he's gotten these
catalogs try-, it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you
might think this is for a seventy-three,

A.253:  Oh, I can imagination,
