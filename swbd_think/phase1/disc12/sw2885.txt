==========================================================================

@A.1:  Uh, do you want to start? Do you have any ideas?

B.2:  Well, the, the changes, of course, in the past generation, are the women in
the work force. 

A.3:  That's for sure. 

B.4:  Um, and the, while their salaries still aren't there yet, the opportunities
for women who are at least driven,

A.5:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.6:  # uh, # do tend to be a little bit more compatible with, uh, changes in
life style.

A.7:  Huh-uh. 

B.8:  So, I suspect that, that may have had more to do with, uh, changes in
society than anything else,

A.9:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.10:  # the # number of the women in the work force. 

A.11:  Yes.  And, you know, you said, um, along with salaries.  I also think that,
I think there's a little bit, um, that can be, I don't know, a little more
development in the area of respect as well.  I don't know if women in higher
positions are necessarily given the same respect as men.

B.12:  Um, I think it depends on which positions and perhaps the personality of
the women.

A.13:  Yeah.  That's true. 

B.14:  Um, let's face it.  There are men executives who have gotten there by, uh,
rather unsavory means,

A.15:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.16:  # you # know, trapping everybody up along the way. 

A.17:  Huh-uh. 

B.18:  Um, when, uh, they might not necessarily be liked, but if, when a woman
does that, she is ridiculed,

A.19:  # Right.  #

B.20:  # up # to the inth degree, where it's almost expected of men.  So some of
that is stereotyped, I think. 

A.21:  Right.  It's true.  Like the, uh, the movie WORKING GIRL. 

B.22:  Huh-uh. 

A.23:  Did you ever see that?

B.24:  I think I have. 

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  Although at the moment, I mean, I know a little bit about it. 

A.27:  Huh-uh.  Well, I think that sort of, it sort of gave two very different
types of women,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # that # both had very strong potentials.  And one was extremely aggressive
and step on whoever you can,

B.30:  # Right.  #

A.31:  # way # of getting to the top and the other one just worked hard and did,
you know, her job,

B.32:  # Huh-uh.  Huh-uh.  #

A.33:  # and did # it well and all that.  But, uh,

B.34:  I think the educational opportunities have made some difference. 

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  Uh, because at one point, I know my mother-in-law talked about when she
went to college.  She really sort of had to do her own way because, although
she was one of three daughters, um, and while her parents were, um, very
supportive in many ways, they didn't really seem to have the, um, the uh, the
understanding that, that daughters should go on for a college degree.

A.37:  Sure.  Oh, yeah. 

B.38:  Had they been sons, you know, that would have been expected, but for
daughters, it wasn't as necessary. 

A.39:  Exactly. 

B.40:  Um, and see, I don't think that's so true anymore. 

A.41:  Oh, not at all. 

B.42:  I think people expect both daughters and sons to have whatever
opportunities are available.

A.43:  Huh-uh.  Right. 

B.44:  Uh,

A.45:  And,

B.46:  I know, we have three sons and one daughter, but the differences, are
negligent in that area. 

A.47:  Huh-uh. 

B.48:  And, in fact, they were in my own families as well. 

A.49:  Huh-uh. 

B.50:  Um, it was never considered that my sister and I wouldn't go to college. 

A.51:  Huh-uh. 

B.52:  You know, certainly my brothers would,

A.53:  # Right.  #

B.54:  # but, # but we were included in that.  So I think those things do,

A.55:  Well, my mother, my parents are older because my siblings are all older. 
I'm the youngest of older siblings,

B.56:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.57:  # and # my mother, um, was, had, she had three sisters and one brother.
Um, so she had two sisters and one brother, in any case.  Um, her, she and her
two sisters actually had to work and not go to school,

B.58:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.59:  # to # put him through school. 

B.60:  Oh, yeah. 

A.61:  And then, I mean, she, she obviously at the time people didn't think twice
about it.  You know,

B.62:  # Right.  #

A.63:  # that # was just the way you did it.  But, um, and, and, what was most
important to them if they wanted to get a job, was if they could type. 

B.64:  Right. 

A.65:  You know, um, take shorthand and,

B.66:  ((That's)) changed so much,

A.67:  Huh-uh.  Well, that's true. 

B.68:  I know.  It's always appalled me because I did not suffer that same
problem, fortunately,

A.69:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.70:  # Uh, # because I went into biological research when I first got,

A.71:  # Oh.  #

B.72:  # out # of college, um, and so, you know, I was not in a situation where I
would [laughter], 

A.73:  Right. 

B.74:  but, I know that even now many young women getting out of college tend to
find themselves in that position of, of having to be sort of the secretarial
pool.  It might not be,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # called # that, but ((that's what it is)).

A.77:  No.  It is.  It is. 

B.78:  Until they work their way up and I don't think very many young men are ask
to do that, although, they are asked to do some what less, uh, technical jobs,

A.79:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.80:  # or, # you know, too, perhaps. 

A.81:  Huh-uh. 

B.82:  You know, start working their way up, but I don't think it's quite as, as
low on the totem pole. 

A.83:  No.  I know.  And, you know, just another whole thing, I work at Manpower
Temporary Services. 

B.84:  Huh-uh. 

A.85:  So I see, I see the work force out there.  And I see a lot of um, like just
what's going on and I'm finding that, and maybe this is just the way it always
was, people in the secretarial pool that really stand out, are the people
that, that end up being the supervisors of the department or the managers or
whatever,

B.86:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.87:  # and # so even though it might be belittled when they first go for the
job,

B.88:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.89:  # it # really is a stepping stone to something a lot greater. 

B.90:  Yeah.  I do know that there are plenty executive secretaries whose
responsibilities are greater than the C E O -s, uh,

A.91:  # Sure [laughter].  #

B.92:  # and they # may not make the money. 

A.93:  I know. 

B.94:  They have a lot of prestige. 

A.95:  Well,

B.96:  Many do make the money, actually. 

A.97:  But they keep the C E O running,

B.98:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.99:  # you # know. 

B.100:  And sometimes those are men, too. 

A.101:  Oh, yeah. 

B.102:  Sometimes secretaries are men, too. 

A.103:  That's true. 

B.104:  I'm glad to see that change. 

A.105:  Huh-uh. 

B.106:  Uh,

A.107:  But, it's, it's, I've always heard, I don't know if you know this joke,
it's, uh, it talks about, um, this, this child and his parents were in a car
and there was a car accident.

B.108:  Oh, yeah. 

A.109:  You know that one?

B.110:  And they go to the hospital. 

A.111:  Right. 

B.112:  And one parent, I guess the, the, uh, father was killed?

A.113:  Yeah.  Right. 

B.114:  And they get to the hospital.  And the doctor comes in to work on the
injured child,

A.115:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.116:  # and # says, "oh, I can't do that,

A.117:  # Operate.  #

B.118:  # that's # my child".

A.119:  Right.  How does that happen?

B.120:  Yeah, I mean, but, see, it's so obvious.  I guess the first time I heard
it, I immediately thought of a doctor, because that was what I originally
wanted to do.

A.121:  Oh. 

B.122:  [Laughter]  So, it's,

A.123:  # You know, I, #

B.124:  # it's amazing how # many do, you know, for a minute, stop and think. 

A.125:  well, I think I even did. 

B.126:  Yeah. 

A.127:  Seriously.  And I,

B.128:  Yeah.  I'm sure.  We're all victims of this, sure. 

A.129:  Huh-uh. 

B.130:  We've, we've been brought up in the society that perpetrated that problem. 

A.131:  Right.  Um, oh, what was, oh, you know, one other place, is women in the
Army. 

B.132:  Yeah. 

A.133:  That, I think, that's really changed a lot. 

B.134:  Yeah. 

A.135:  Um, I don't know if I necessarily agree with that, but I don't think I
agree with the Army.  But that's a whole different topic.

B.136:  Right.  I suppose my feeling is, it doesn't matter, male or female.  Uh, at
least, if they're given the same opportunity, then that's good.  Although, they
can't always.  There are certainly differences between men and women.  I guess
the other thing that was asked in this for us to discuss was, um, what kind of
changes this has brought about.  What do we see in the future.  And, uh, just
because this past Sunday was Mother's Day, of course,

A.137:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.138:  # there # was some articles in the newspaper about the, uh, mothers in the
work force.  And that, that has certainly made a tremendous difference,

A.139:  # Oh.  #

B.140:  # in # society,

A.141:  Oh, yeah. 

B.142:  But, what is interesting is, at least in the WASHINGTON POST, there was,
um, a report of a study that suggested that there were more women now who
regretted the necessity for having to work and leave their young children.

A.143:  Huh-uh. 

B.144:  And that more, if given the opportunity, if financial, if it were not
financially necessary, would stay home, you know, would have the choice, would
make the choice of staying home,

A.145:  # Yeah.  #

B.146:  # while # their children were young. 

A.147:  Yeah. 

B.148:  And it's interesting because I don't know if that's a switch, if somehow
maybe that is being revalued or reevaluated,

A.149:  # Yeah.  #

B.150:  # or # not.  I was fortunate enough that, um, well, it was a decision, when
we had children, to make that decision and we determined that we would live on
my husband's salary,

A.151:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.152:  # when # we first got married so that when we had children,

A.153:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.154:  # we # would not, you know, fall in that necessity of, my,

A.155:  # Right.  #

B.156:  # having # to work.  And so we made that choice.  We didn't live as well. 

A.157:  Huh-uh. 

B.158:  But, we lived well enough. 

A.159:  But you made sacrifices and you gained things. 

B.160:  Sure.  But, you see, for me that was the more important. 

A.161:  Right. 

B.162:  I know of plenty of friends who did not, were not able to make that choice.

A.163:  Right. 

B.164:  And that's difficult, because I think in the long run, uh, part of the
problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad, the negative
attitude of women working comes about because children remember the traumas of
their mothers trying to work,

A.165:  # Yeah.  #

B.166:  # and # run the household,

A.167:  # Yeah.  #

B.168:  # and # some of the things.  That has not changed. 

A.169:  Right. 

B.170:  And I think,

A.171:  # Um, and, #

B.172:  # that's a # serious issue. 

A.173:  and, you know, and then the marriage suffers. 

B.174:  Exactly. 

A.175:  Because how much time,

B.176:  # Yeah.  #

A.177:  # can # you physically spend with your husband if your being torn in all
directions. 

B.178:  Oh, yeah.  It's very difficult.  So that needs to be done and,

A.179:  # Yeah.  #

B.180:  # perhaps # education will eventually do it,

A.181:  # Yeah.  #

B.182:  # but, # uh, the idea that all those, uh, things that were traditionally
thought to be the housewife when she was home,

A.183:  # Right.  #

B.184:  # as # a housewife, are still hers even if she's out working. 

A.185:  Yeah.  Right. 

B.186:  I mean, that's a serious problem. 

A.187:  Right. 

B.188:  Uh,

A.189:  One thing that I, I think Rochester is being a little proactive, um,
several companies are actually now providing some on site, very reasonably,
reasonable cost day-care.

B.190:  Wow.  That's nice. 

A.191:  That is great because, then,

B.192:  # Yeah.  #

A.193:  # at # least the child is going with the parent right to the company,

B.194:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.195:  # You # know (( )),

B.196:  And can take care of the child if the child is ill or something. 

A.197:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And then the mother or the father, whoever can see them
during their lunch or,

B.198:  Huh-uh. 

A.199:  You know, the, um, they're just a lot more available.  Even though they're
still at work,

B.200:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.201:  # they're # not over at some strangers house. 

B.202:  Right. 

A.203:  You know. 

B.204:  Actually, I have a few friends who, who, uh, have a nontraditional family,
in that the husband is, is home with the children,

A.205:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.206:  # and the # wife is out with the more, uh, uh, kind of job,

A.207:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.208:  # and # then the husband, in one case, is a musician so he does,

A.209:  # Oh.  #

B.210:  # guitar # lessons and does a lot of, uh, profession playing, you know,

A.211:  # Huh-uh.  #

B.212:  # for # weekends and so on.  But essentially, it's his wife,

A.213:  # Oh.  #

B.214:  # who # is the primary money provider there.  It's an interesting
situation. 

A.215:  It is. 

B.216:  They have three children. 

A.217:  Oh, wow. 

B.218:  Uh, so it seems to have worked very well. 

A.219:  That's great. 

B.220:  But, um, but those things are rare, I must say.  They're still not,

A.221:  Huh-uh.  Society still isn't up to just being okay with that. 

B.222:  No. 

A.223:  They're really not.  Because even the way you say it.  You talk about it as
the exception. 

B.224:  It is the exception. 

A.225:  Right.  And, um,
