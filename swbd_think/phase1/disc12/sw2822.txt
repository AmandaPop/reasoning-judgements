===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  You know, it's, uh, I'm a C P A, so I use computer quite a bit, uh, I'm not
sure why they call them, sometimes call them personal computers, uh,

A.3:  I guess they mean just one that's in your home. 

B.4:  Righ-, well, actual I think they mean one that's, that is, uh, designed or
designated, dedicated for one person to use primarily as opposed to, uh, large
mainframe computer.

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  Which, you know, several people maybe use, uh, terminals tied to it I guess
that's,

A.7:  Okay, I guess, 

B.8:  that's my definition an way. 

A.9:  That's like the ones in T I.  

B.10:  Right, um, I have an I B M it's, uh, one they call the X T, which is one of
the earlier models.  Prior to that I had, uh, one that was a Heath Kit
computer which is one that I basically built myself.

A.11:  Oh, in your home?  

B.12:  Yeah.  And, uh, 

A.13:  Oh.  

B.14:  so I've had, uh, I've had a computer for, uh, oh about ten years,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  little over ten years I guess now.  

A.17:  How do you know about building you own computer?  

B.18:  Well, you, uh, Heath Kit, which is, uh, you know, one of these, uh,
electronic stores, it's a hobby store place,

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  and you can go there and buy a kit , or at least you use to be able to.
I'm not sure that you can still buy those from them now.  But you could buy a
kit and build a computer it like have a, would have a manual step-by-step
manual, to go through and put all the parts together.

A.21:  Was that a little less expensive?

B.22:  Uh, yeah it, uh, it then it was, 

A.23:  [Cough].  

B.24:  and of course the computer are so cheap now I'm not even sure how it
would, how it would compare.

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  Um, back then the computer that I built was, uh, one, you know, was a old
pretty low level technology wise and, uh, it cost me, oh, fifteen hundred
dollars I guess to build it,

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  and it would eighteen hundred or so to buy, I think so it was, you know,
it was not a great saving, but it was a learning experience any way.

A.29:  Oh, seems like it would be more fun any way,

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  my husband gets a kick out of building stuff for his self.  

B.32:  Yeah,  

A.33:  Rather than buying ((one)).

B.34:  if, uh, if he's, if he's aware of building, you know, building electronic
stuff he's, he knows about Heath Kit probably.

A.35:  No, he's not into electronics, I'm just saying,

B.36:  Not into electron-, 

A.37:  per se he just likes to build stuff.  

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  But, uh,

B.40:  But, uh, you know, I had to, had to learn a little bit about, uh, using a
solder iron an-, and that kind of stuff.  Well, I, I say, uh, I said basically
I built it myself, when I got to a certain point I took it to a T I engineer.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  That, uh, was a friend of my wife's and he, uh, you know, he worked with,
help me finished putting it together, you know, and make it work right it, uh,
so, you know, if you don't know much electronics you can, you know, you, have
to have,

A.43:  Somebody to help.  

B.44:  somebody with a little electronic background to make it work, but, uh,
you know, the basic stuff I, I did all the basics any way.

A.45:  Do you use your computer for home, uh,

B.46:  No, well I use mine at work, 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  I don't, I don't even have one at the house any more, it's, uh, I've got
it in my office and, uh, matter fact I'm market for another one.

A.49:  ((Is that)) for your house, or for your,

B.50:  No, for my home, you know.

A.51:  office.  Oh, okay.  

B.52:  I mean for my for my office.  So, I'm, I'm not sure eventually, I'll have
to, I'll probably have one at home too but, uh,

A.53:  Well, couldn't you like, um, I'm pretty sure you can do this, have it, one
in your home that has the same stuff in it that your office does.

B.54:  Oh, yeah.  

A.55:  Perhaps, 

B.56:  Oh. 

A.57:  kind of connect it?  

B.58:  Well, you can have them connected by a, by a ((modem)) if you want to,
which is a telephone line.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  But, but you can, can have the same software, you know, the same programs
so that you,

A.61:  ((Just contains)),

B.62:  take your data files from one to the other,

A.63:  Okay. 

B.64:  so that you can use same computer, you know, for the for the,

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  ((a)) different computers for the same, 

A.67:  Right.  

B.68:  project.  

A.69:  Okay.

B.70:  So, you know, it's, and that's, that's one thing that I would like to have,
uh, occasionally I need to work at home, you know, and now I don't have a
computer there.

A.71:  You could just bring your disk home and do it.  

B.72:  ((You know that's)), I could if I, 

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  you know, if I, if I had a computer there.  

A.75:  That was my problem in school I could not write programs.  

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  I loved messing with the computer though.  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  But I just could not, to a certain point I'd just get messed up and I would
be totally lost.

B.80:  Yeah, so, but, uh, you know it's, uh, you know, the computer it's, uh, the,
you know, growing thing in, uh, you know, both home and business.  I,

A.81:  Yeah, I want, 

B.82:  I think eventually.  

A.83:  I'm wanting to go back to school and this time I'll try a lot harder.

B.84:  Yeah, that's, but eventually I think, uh, most homes will have a computer,

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  you know, for some reason, uh, either,

A.87:  Well, a lot them more or less ((close)) the computers the microwaves all
have these new little buttons and,

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  Just about every thing is getting computerized.  

B.90:  New cars have computer in them and,

A.91:  Yeah, have you seen that, uh, thing that shows the maps?  

B.92:  Uh, no, I haven't seen that but I have heard about it, but I haven't seen
it.

A.93:  I think that's neat.  

B.94:  Yeah.  But uh, I don't know I guess the, uh, the personal computer is, it's
really going to be a necessity that, you know, children should learn to use
it.  I was just commenting, I teach a couple accounting classes, and, uh, I
was just commenting the other night that it's, uh, going to reach the point
where, um, accounting classing in college have to have computer for the
students to use, you know, in every class, right now I teach over at
Brookhaven College, and there's only one class that I happen to teach that,
that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer.  If
they want to use, want to learn the computer they have to take classes,

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  outside the accounting area.  

A.97:  Okay, now a friend of mine is trying, is going for C P A,

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  and she is having to take or she may-, maybe it's just a preference that
she's taking it on herself, but she is taking a computer class.

B.100:  Yeah, and, uh, but yeah that's, that's something that's going to be, uh, a
necessity for accountants because you, you know, it's, you can do so much for
more work with a computer then you can do, you know, doing it manually.

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  And, uh, and a lot more accurately also.  I use the computer to do, you
know, all of my accounting work and, of course, I write letters on the
computer and I do income tax on the computer [laughter] so, it's I use it a
lot.

A.103:  I do our income taxes too and you're right it probably [laughter] would be
a lot easier if I the,

B.104:  Yeah, you know, 

A.105:  use a computer.  

B.106: it's just, it would be, if you have a computer you can buy, you
know, some oh one three fifty-one cheap software that, uh, that, uh,
you can buy like at Software House,

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  here in Richard-, in, uh, Dallas at, uh, over in Addison.  You can go
over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer.
And do your income tax and it's one of those where you can change things, you
know, to see what happens, you know, you say well let's see I've got some
many, uh, so much of my charitable contributions on my itemized deductions,
and then you discover that you had more then you thought you did, you can go
in and change it,

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  and it changes everything on the return and you don't have to go back
and, you know, change every line with,

A.111:  And redo everything.

B.112:  you know, the eraser or the, the, uh, liquid paper or whatever.

A.113:  Right, uh.

B.114:  So it's, it's really convenient to have that plus, you know, you've got it
on the computer and it does all the calculations and the math, you know,
makes for a lot of your errors on the return.

A.115:  Yeah.  

B.116:  You know, so,  

A.117:  Well, I've, so far I've had been able to use the easy form. 

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  Just me and my husband.

B.120:  Right, but, uh,

A.121:  So, now, I'm for, my little boy's birthday is coming up and I was thinking
about getting him just one of those little, I know I they've got toy computers
more or less.

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  Just for kids just starting, and he'll be four.  

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  But I've seen it on, uh, like twenty twenty and stuff whatever, where they
do have little third graders and stuff working on,

B.126:  Yeah, they, uh, start, are starting real early on the computers.  When he
gets to school he will probably be using a computer.

A.127:  Uh-huh.  

B.128:  You know, yeah, second or third grade probably.  

A.129:  Uh-huh.  

B.130:  And, uh, he'll, he'll know more about computer then you will and you'll be
having to go back to school just too keep up with him.

A.131:  [Laughter]. 

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  Probably, but I think that's the way it goes with most parents.

B.134:  Yeah, and, uh, have to learn, have to learn a little bit as they go along,

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  you, you suddenly discover that your educated when the students are
[laughter].

A.137:  [Laughter] Well, uh,

B.138:  Well, 

A.139:  Go ahead.

B.140:  well it's been it's been interesting taking about computers it's, uh,
that's one of my favorite subjects and, uh, I really, I get into talking about
so,

A.141:  Well, I don't know much about them,

B.142:  Yeah.  

A.143:  the main thing I didn't, I don't even remember them having computers on,
uh, that little sheet.

B.144:  Uh, yeah.

A.145:  But, uh,  

@@B.146:  Yeah, I don't remember, I've checked off a bunch of stuff, you know, on
there, I don't remember what all was on there, but I've talked about two or
three things that I wasn't, you know wasn't expecting to talk about so,

A.147:  Uh-huh, well, it's been pretty interesting,

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  so far.  

B.150:  Yeah, so it's been, been nice talking to you.  

A.151:  Yeah.  

B.152:  And, uh, I guess maybe they'll ring us up again sometime [laughter].

A.153:  All righty.  

B.154:  Okay, thanks.

A.155:  #All right.  Bye-bye.# 

B.156:  #Bye-bye.#
