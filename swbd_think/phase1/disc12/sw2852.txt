REMARKS:        The initial section was not difficult.  However, a lot of 
the static and a lot of the bird noises could not be heard during the first
section which required a lot of inserting while listening to Speaker A's 
and Speaker B's section.  Time consuming.   

==========================================================================

@A.1:  [Static]  We're supposed to talk about dining.  What kind of [static] 
dining do you like to do?

B.2:  [Lipsmack]  Well, we're [/static]  in the Dallas area. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Are you,

A.5:  # Y-, #

B.6:  # [Static]  # also?

A.7:  Grapevine. 

B.8:  Pardon?

A.9:  [Static]  Y-, Yeah.  I'm in Grapevine [/static]  --

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  -- uh, Fort Worth Dallas area. 

B.12:  Well [breathing],  we, uh, we don't do a lot of family,

A.13:  # ((Uh)). #

B.14:  # dining # out, uh, but, but my husband and I do. 

A.15:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.16:  #[Beep]  {noise for Call Waiting}. We do#  all kinds of different things. 
So, was that you?

A.17:  [Bird_squawk]  Yes.  Can you,

B.18:  # Oh.  #

A.19:  # believe # that?

B.20:  Okay.  Well I just didn't know if I needed to go and whoop up on my kids
quick,

A.21:  # [Laughter].  #

B.22:  # or # [noise]  whatever. 

A.23:  No.  I just let it go. 

B.24:  Oh, okay [laughter]. 

A.25:  It'll, they'll call back. 

B.26:  [Laughter]  [breathing]  Well, the, uh, [noise]  my husband and I used to
try to go out like one evening of a weekend or something. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  And [breathing] sometimes we'll even go during the daytime for lunch. 

A.29:  Oh, that's nice. 

B.30:  So, if we have the opportunity just [whispering]  because it's quieter
[/whispering]. 

A.31:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

B.32:  We don't like the bar --

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  -- atmosphere. 

A.35:  They usually stick you in there for an hour, you know, or,

B.36:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.37:  # even # when there are plenty of tab-, that always makes me mad, that,
just to get you to buy drinks I guess.  And,

B.38:  ((Yeah)).

A.39:  I don't mind waiting thirty minutes.  But, boy, if it gets over thirty
minutes, it really,

B.40:  Yeah.  And we aren't,

A.41:  irritates me. 

B.42:  drinkers.  So, you know, for us that's just kind of wasted t-, [breathing]
--

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  -- time.  We just, but now we do go to this one little place out here on
the expressway, uh, CHEDDARS.

A.45:  [Noise]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I,

B.46:  [Lipsmack]  And they have a, uh,

A.47:  I ate there Friday, as a matter of fact, at lunch. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  # Yeah.  #

B.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.51:  In Dal-,

B.52:  Well, they have a big,

A.53:  the one at Fort Worth. 

B.54:  screen T V --

A.55:  Oh, okay. 

B.56:  -- in their bar area, lounge area.  And we don't mind that because we both
love basketball and like to watch basketball [bird_squawk]. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  But I, uh, oh, I don't like the fights and stuff and sometimes you see
those [breathing].

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  [Laughter]  But, and [static]  if, if it's a wild and crazy music, that
turns us off, too. 

A.61:  Me, too.  Me,

B.62:  # But # [/static], 

A.63:  # too.  #

B.64:  [Lipsmack]  we, uh,

A.65:  Yeah.  I like, uh, [breathing]  [noise],  there's not [static]  too many
restaurants [bird_squawk]  I don't like to go to.  I [laughter], 

B.66:  # [Laughter].  #

A.67:  # ju-, # I just like to eat out.  But, I, uh,

B.68:  We do, too.  We, [/static]  we do, too.  I, I wish we could do more often. 
I imagine when all our kids get gone and,

A.69:  # Yeah.  #

B.70:  # [Bird_squawk]  # grown that we'll [static], 

A.71:  You will.  Mine are, mine are grown [static]  and gone.  In fact, I'm going
over tonight to my son's house.  He's taking me out tonight for Mother's Day
[noise]  and then my, I'm going to [bird_squawk]  brunch in the morning with my
daughter for [noise],  for Mother's Day. 

B.72:  How fun.  How [static], 

A.73:  # So, #

B.74:  # fun.  #

A.75:  I'll have [breathing],  of course I'm on a diet, [bird_squawk]  but I guess
I'll go off of it for,

B.76:  # Well, #

A.77:  # this # weekend. 

B.78:  don't you think, though, there are a lot more options available
[bird_squawk] for people who are watching?

A.79:  Yeah.  And,

B.80:  # You, #

A.81:  # you # know, you,

B.82:  know, you're seeing a lot more grilled chicken and,

A.83:  Right. 

B.84:  fish without breading on it and,

A.85:  [Static]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And that's [static], 

B.86:  You know, I never hesitate [bird_squawk]  ever anymore to ask for my
dressing on the side or to eliminate [noise]  sour,

A.87:  # Yeah.  #

B.88:  # cream # or anything like that, and they're always [noise] willing to help
and --

A.89:  [Bird_squawk]  Yeah.  They are and,

B.90:   -- # accommodate.  #

A.91:  # I really, # even all the fast foods they're coming out with the grilled
chicken.  And I eat a lot of those, you,

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  know. 

B.94:  [Bird_squawk]  Yeah. 

A.95:  And even if I, [static]  ((un-,)) I don't eat steak too much [/static].  I
love steak and I have to have it every k-, every now and then.  But normally
[bird_squawk]  I'm, I, I try and stay away from the, the red meats.  So if I go
to a steak house, I will eat one [static]  but,

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  I don't, you know, [/static]  gorge myself. 

B.98:  [Static]  Yeah.  I love steak, too.  And, you know, a lot of times we'll,
our favorite place to eat for steak is STEAK AND ALE. 

A.99:  It, yeah.  Now I've never gotten a bad meal there.  Have you? I,

B.100:  # Huh-uh.  #

A.101:  # just, #

B.102:  No. 

A.103:  you know, they're,

B.104:  No. 

A.105:  consistently good. 

B.106:  And just always, you know, always [bird_squawk]  quite and,

A.107:  # Yeah.  #

B.108:  # [/Noise]  # pleasant and,

A.109:  They're, uh, I found that if you call and make reservations, Oh, I, uh,
you, they used to irritate me making us wait so long.  But, uh, now I found if
I call and [/static] make reservations, they usually get you in pretty fast.

B.110:  Uh-huh. 

A.111:  #So,#

B.112:  #Uh-huh.#  Well, the, uh, [noise]  [lipsmack]  uh, one out here is just
always very accommodating.  You know, we like a lot of ethnic foods, too
[noise].  We --

A.113:  Uh-huh.  I do, too. 

B.114:  -- we like to go different places and,

A.115:  Well, I love Chi-, I love oriental food, and I love seafood, and, uh, but I
also li-, I, I don't mind paying for atmosphere [static]. 

B.116:  Yeah. 

A.117:  I,

B.118:  # Yeah.  #

A.119:  # ((I)), #

B.120:  I don't either [/static]. 

A.121:  It doesn't bother me at all.  And I, if I, [static] and I don-, and I'm not
opposed to tipping very well if I, if the service is good.  But, boy, I, it
really irritates me to [noise], well, like in CHEDDARS yesterday, I know that
the girl just forgot our order.  And we were on a lunch hour [/static], you
know, and my gosh, she just,

B.122:  You kept waiting and waiting and waiting. 

A.123:  And, I know, I thought, gosh, my whole lunch hour I'm just sitting here
waiting here for a [breathing],  a lousy sandwich.  So, I went ahead and tipped
her, but I didn't want to [laughter], 

B.124:  # [Laughter].  #

A.125:  # ((I # was)) so mad. 

B.126:  Yeah.  And you know that that's part of their [breathing]  wage and that,

A.127:  # Yes.  I know it.  #

B.128:  # they get busy and # stuff.  You, but, but you wouldn't tip as much as you
would have --

A.129:  Right. 

B.130:  -- had. 

A.131:  Yeah.  Right. 

B.132:  You,

A.133:  # But, #

B.134:  # know, # the, uh,

A.135:  that, that, and I do, I tip accordingly.  Oh, believe me.  I --

B.136:  [Lipsmack]  I,

A.137:  -- # ((give that)), #

B.138:  # do, too.  I # think that that's service related and,

A.139:  I do, too [bird_squawk].  But,

B.140:  # Yeah.  #

A.141:  # I # hate cheap people that, that get good service and [bird_squawk] don't
tip.  That irritates me just as bad,

B.142:  Yeah. 

A.143:  and,

B.144:  Yeah. 

A.145:  [Bird_squawk] I've been out with guys that have embarrassed me that don't
tip, you know, well.  I c-, [breathing] [bird_squawk] it [bird_squawk] really
ir-,

B.146:  Makes you want to just kind of slip a little,

A.147:  Yeah. 

B.148:  more under there. 

A.149:  It really, and I have.  I have slipped money, you know, if, if the guy
didn't tip enough, I'll take money out of my purse and put a,

B.150:  Yeah. 

A.151:  And,

B.152:  # Yeah.  #

A.153:  # then # I hope it makes them feel bad, but I don't think it does
[laughter]. 

B.154:  No.  Probably not.  They f-, I guess they figure that's your choice. 

A.155:  #[Lipsmack]  [breathing].# 

B.156:  #Well,# uh, I know, uh, [noise]  my, I have teenagers [breathing]  and just
recently I was out with a group of teenagers for semester exams. 

A.157:  Uh-huh. 

B.158:  Uh, if I said I would provide [noise]  transportation at lunchtime for them
to go and, out to eat and [noise]  --

A.159:  Uh-huh. 

B.160:  -- so all these little kids here, they all want their own tickets, you
know. 

A.161:  Yeah. 

B.162:  And, I said right up front, "Now, kids," actually, I kind of said it to my
daughter.  And if I was going to do it again I would say it to the whole group
[noise]  because I was too, uh, I was, I was too shy.  I didn't,

A.163:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.164:  # not too # shy, I just didn't want to embarrass her. 

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  But what happened was, I ended up having to loan money,

A.167:  # Oh, did you really? #

B.168:  # to those kids because # they did not figure in the tip --

A.169:  Uh-huh. 

B.170:  -- and the tax. 

A.171:  Uh-huh. 

B.172:  They looked at that and said three ninety-five,

A.173:  # And they thought that was, #

B.174:  # they say I got four # dollars, I can do this. 

A.175:  Yeah. 

B.176:  You,

A.177:  # Yeah.  #

B.178:  # know, # so they buy the, get the three ninety-five item and, you know,
then they didn't have enough for the,

A.179:  And I,

B.180:  extra.  So,

A.181:  found the, also that, uh, I don't think that waitresses, I, yeah, I was in
a survey when I lived in Orlando, uh, had a, was in a survey o-, restaurants
[bird_squawk]  and, uh, [lipsmack]  the, I, a lot of the waiters and waitresses
think, you know, when women come in that, that women are lousy tippers and
that's why they don't give them as good a service as they do a couple
[bird_squawk]  or [noise]  something like that.  But, I don't think that's
true.  I think women, to,

B.182:  # It's, #

A.183:  # me, #

B.184:  just that, you know, a single woman, an individual of any kind is not
going to have as large an order --

A.185:  Right. 

B.186:  -- as two or three at a table. 

A.187:  Well, I find that women are more willing to give [bird_squawk] a good,

B.188:  # Sure.  #

A.189:  # tip, # a bunch of women as, uh, couples or, [noise]  or, you know, (( ))
guys together [bird_squawk], 

B.190:  Yeah. 

A.191:  probably.  I don't think they're that, but, tha-, they were, on this survey
they were saying that the, that's the notion that women have, I mean that
waitress and waitresses had [noise].  But, uh [bird_squawk],

B.192:  Well, I, I, yeah, I definitely disagree with that,

A.193:  # I like, #

B.194:  # ((a lot)). #

A.195:  one of my favorites in Dallas is, uh, BABY DOE'S.  Have you ever eaten
there?

B.196:  Uh-huh.  Been,

A.197:  # Oh.  #

B.198:  # a # long time.  Been a long time. 

A.199:  Yeah.  I love it.  Oh, gosh it's, I like the at-, I remember when they
first opened up, I, we went several times.  And, uh, it was, it was so much
fun.  But, I, like I said, I like to go to restaurants like that.  I, and I
like these, um, have you ever been to, what, when I lived in Orlando, they had
call-, a place called SHAKESPEARE'S.

B.200:  Uh-huh. 

A.201:  And they probably have one similar [noise]  to it here,

B.202:  # Uh-huh.  The, #

A.203:  # where, medieval.  #

B.204:  medieval. 

A.205:  Yeah.  Those are kind of,

B.206:  # Kind of f-, uh, #

A.207:  # fun.  I wouldn't want # a,

B.208:  a,

A.209:  steady diet of it.  But,

B.210:  tavern, pub,

A.211:  yeah,

B.212:  kind of thing. 

A.213:  and have the wenches wait on you [laughter]. 

B.214:  Uh-huh. 

A.215:  It was a lot of fun.  I,

B.216:  # We, uh # -- 

A.217:  # I enjoyed that.  #

B.218:  -- we were at the butcher shop in the West End here [bird_squawk] recently,

A.219:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.220:  # and # that was sure neat. 

A.221:  Yeah.  Where you cook your own,

B.222:  # It, cook your own steak. #

A.223:  # steak.  Yeah.  #

B.224:  and those,

A.225:  Yeah. 

B.226:  steaks were [bird_squawk]  wonderful. 

A.227:  Yeah.  Weren't they? I, I've eaten there.  That was, that's,

B.228:  # It was, uh, #

A.229:  # good.  But # -- 

B.230:  I really enjoyed that. 

A.231:  -- I remember [bird_squawk]  back when that was just old warehouses down
there.  I couldn't believe,

B.232:  # Yeah.  #

A.233:  # when # I moved back to Dallas how that had,

B.234:  Exactly. 

A.235:  changed. 

B.236:  Exactly.  Same here.  I [bird_squawk]  grew up in the area. 

A.237:  Yeah.  I remember,

B.238:  # Some of my favorite ones have, #

A.239:  # I think SPAGHETTI WAREHOUSE was about # the only thing down there
[talking]  for years and years [/talking]  [noise].  I guess it kind of grew
around it.  I moved,

B.240:  Well,

A.241:  from, in eighty-five.  When I came back all that was, uh, built back up. 

B.242:  Had all been worked over. 

A.243:  Yeah.  And I thought, you know, Deep Ellum, I still don't think I'd go to
Deep Ellum.  I don't care how,

B.244:  # Well, there's some wonderful, #

A.245:  # chic it's suppose to # be.  But [breathing], 

B.246:  little shops and art [talking]  [clicking],  art,

A.247:  Is it really?

B.248:  galleries and,

A.249:  I just could, I, just from [static]  back in the fifties, I remember how
bad it was [laughter]  and I just, it just stuck in my mind and I just wouldn't
go down there I don't th-, especially at night.  I might during the day but I
don't think I'd go at night down there [noise]  at all, [whistling]  because it
used to really be rough and tough.  In fact, the only time I ever saw anybody
stabbed out, we were driving down [bird_squawk], in the street and saw a guy
come out of a theater with a knife sticking out of his back.  And that just s-,

B.250:  [Breathing]  Ooh. 

A.251:  stuck in my mind [bird_squawk] [laughter].  And he was walking, too.  Uh,
[noise] they were walking him to an ambulance [noise].  And I just [lipsmack],
I've never gone back since then.

B.252:  [Laughter]  That was,

A.253:  # [Laughter]  No.  #

B.254:  # enough to # ((take it)) [laughter]. 

A.255:  [Laughter]  That's right.  I don't want to go down there anymore. 

B.256:  [Breathing]  [lipsmack]  Well, [lipsmack]  I think that's, those kind of
things definitely tend to --

A.257:  Yeah. 

B.258:  -- mark your, uh [breathing], 

A.259:  But Dallas has really got a lot of good restaurants. 

B.260:  They really do.  I think Dallas is a very, uh, up and coming area.  I think
it's, uh --

A.261:  Yeah.  They,

B.262:  -- # it, #

A.263:  # (( )). #

B.264:  it caters to a lot of business groups and a,

A.265:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.266:  # lot # of out of towners and --

A.267:  Yeah. 

B.268:  -- and regulars, also.  And [bird_squawk]  --

A.269:  Are you,

B.270:  -- # you know.  #

A.271:  # a native Dallas-, #

B.272:  Uh, I came here when I was in elementary school.  So,

A.273:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.274:  # I consider # myself native. 

A.275:  Well, I married a Dallasite and that's how I got here.  But I would, you
know, I wouldn't trade for it.  I, I'm from California [bird_squawk], but I, I
just consider myself a Texan.  When I moved to Florida I couldn't hardly wait
to get back [breathing].  I [laughter],

B.276:  # Well, [noise]  and # -- 

A.277:  # I stayed down there # four years. 

B.278:  -- I think, uh, you know, that, uh, I think Dallas is becoming [noise] 
diverse enough now to accommodate almost [bird_squawk] any need --

A.279:  Yeah.  I, # think so.  #

B.280:  -- # or # any, desires in any kind of cooking.  You know,

A.281:  Yeah. 

B.282:  Indian, Greek, [noise]  you name it,

A.283:  Uh-huh. 

B.284:  you know, there's,

A.285:  Uh-huh. 

B.286:  there's something for everybody and,

A.287:  I'm enjoying living over [bird_squawk]  here in Grapevine and Fort Worth
area, too, f-, for a change because I'm really discovering [bird_squawk]  Fort
Worth.  They've got a lot of nice restaurants over here that a lot of [static] 
people don't know about, you know. 

B.288:  Our favorite one in Fort Worth [noise]  is [bird_squawk]  downtown Fort
Worth, kind of across from the, uh, [bird_squawk]  THE KEG. 

A.289:  THE KEG? Is,

B.290:  # THE KEG.  #

A.291:  # it down # there by SUNDANCE SQUARE?

B.292:  Well, it's down, you know, [bird_squawk]  by the Convention Center. 

A.293:  Yeah.  I ki-, I --

B.294:  I don't know what the street is. 

A.295:  -- I'm not real familiar with down there, I've been down there to the
SUNDANCE SQUARE when I first, uh, moved back here.  I met my sis-,
sister-in-law down there and, uh,
