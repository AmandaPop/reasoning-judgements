============================================================================

B.1:  So you like to fish, huh?

A.2:  Yeah, I like to, I don't have a boat, but I like to fish and there's a lot
of lakes around here.  Uh, are there many lakes up there?

B.3:  Yeah, actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.  We actu-, uh, we
have the, those little, the, the, the Great Lakes, you know, Grea-, uh,
[breathing]  Lake Ontario is right near here. 

A.4:  Uh-huh. 

B.5:  Plus, we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York where
there're lots of small lakes everywhere and these are, uh, real good, uh, for,
like, you know, bass fishing and so forth.

A.6:  They have mostly small mouth in them or,

B.7:  No, we have a, qui-, actually quite a lot of variety.  There's, uh,
there's, we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like
that.

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  You know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.  Uh, we have a pretty large
bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year.

A.10:  Oh, yeah, that's right, uh-huh. 

B.11:  So it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun. 

A.12:  Uh-huh. 

B.13:  How about you? Do you like, what do you like to go for?

A.14:  Oh, it's, it's, uh, I fish for bass, but I hardly ever catch one, but, uh,
uh, they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon --

B.15:  Yeah. 

A.16:  -- and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out
water, they wash down the fish and, uh, you catch that white bass and crappie
out of there. 

B.17:  Um. 

A.18:  Every once in a while there'll be striped bass. 

B.19:  We have, uh, some friends who live on the lake --

A.20:  Uh-huh. 

B.21:  -- and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to
the point where, you know, normally you go, y-, y-, go fishing for bass, you
get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff.
But in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once and we just,
every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum
bass and usually you pull up, you know, [breathing] thirteen to fourteen inch
bass.

A.22:  Wow. 

B.23:  Yeah, it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there
because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass and,

A.24:  Uh-huh. 

B.25:  During perch season as well, you pull up a lot of, uh, probably during,
during perch season the perch will run in very large schools, so what they'll
do is j-, you'll, you'll be sort of boating around, these people own a little
row boat, and they'll be boating around and they'll hit a, they'll hit a
school of perches in the middle --

A.26:  Uh-huh. 

B.27:  -- and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in
one at, they, they just drop it in.  They can't pull it in fast enough. 

A.28:  What do you, what do you catch perch on?

B.29:  Uh, I, they actually, they, according to them, you can catch, when the
perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.

A.30:  Huh. 

B.31:  They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes, but, you
know, I've, she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you
know. 

A.32:  Uh-huh. 

B.33:  They'll, corn or salami or bread or anything, they'll, they'll, they'll hit
because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools.

A.34:  Yeah, it's, sometimes I use corn, but, uh, uh, some fish steal it off the
hook sometimes. 

B.35:  Yeah, it's a big problem. 

A.36:  Yeah, uh, the other day I was fishing with bread, uh, there's a college
across the street --

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  -- and they, it's, it's full of carp and, uh, I caught a carp on a, about,
what size is that, uh, I think it was a number two treble hook,

B.39:  # Um.  #

A.40:  # and # it's huge, its, its mouth was full of hooks. 

B.41:  Wow. 

A.42:  So he was in a bad way.  But, uh, it's, he was fast.  He,

B.43:  A big one?

A.44:  Yeah.  Well, it's, uh, it was sixteen inches long. 

B.45:  Wow, that's, that's, that's a nice size carp. 

A.46:  Yeah, I think it was about a pound and a half, you know, but all they're
good for is the fight.  Boy they d-, they really don't want to come out of the
water they,

B.47:  [Laughter]. 

A.48:  they zip through the water, you know, you're, how your line goes, you know
--

B.49:  Uh-huh. 

A.50:  -- and I thought, you know, that, uh, I wasn't going to be able to get it
in, because, uh, the one I hooked just about ten minutes before, when I tried
to raise it out of the water, it fell off, so it wasn't hooked very well.
But, you know, I got it that far, I figured that, uh,

B.51:  # That, that, that counts.  #

A.52:  # Yeah, that's what I # said.  That's what I told the guy.  The guy was
standing there and he laughed when it fell off and I said, that's a quick
release, right there. 

B.53:  [Laughter]  Do you, do you, do you actually like the taste of f-, do you,
like, eat the fish that you catch or are you more of a sport fisherman?

A.54:  Uh, catfish, yeah.  But, uh, I haven't eaten anything else, you know.  Uh,
there's some, uh, my dad has a farm and there's, he has two ponds up there and
my uncle has a, a pond upstream and there's a lot of crappie in there now.
But, uh, I think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a
big enough crappie to eat.  But the catfish, there's, you know, there's
hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, # that, yeah.  #

B.55:  # Right, so # you can just, oh, because I don't actually like fish.  It's
sort of, so when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else.

A.56:  Yeah, and if, you know, when you, when you have to look in their eyes and,
you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish
--

B.57:  Right. 

A.58:  -- you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord. 

B.59:  And, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung. 

A.60:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.61:  Yeah, I know it.  Have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?

A.62:  Uh, not yet.  My brother went off the coast of Maine, uh, when the, I don't
know, what they, mackerel --

B.63:  Yeah. 

A.64:  -- that school up there? It's he, he said that it was just like that.  They
were throwing like, uh, uh, hell benders or, uh, uh, some other kind of treble
hook lure and, and, uh, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,
sometimes they've had two on, you know, one on every hook. 

B.65:  Yeah, we, I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago and we would go
and just, uh, drop two, you know, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked
rig as well down off a boat.  We just dropped it down there and, the captain
had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat --

A.66:  Uh-huh. 

B.67:  -- so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish and you just drop it in and
[breathing]  and it just, you, you get one or two at a shot, you know and,

A.68:  Yeah. 

B.69:  It's a good deal, too.  It was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours
of fishing on some big charter boat. 

A.70:  Wow. 

B.71:  You know, and, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if
you want. 

A.72:  Yeah, down here it's like two hundred dollars a day. 

B.73:  Well, this is, yeah, this, this, this was for a, you know, large, there
were --

A.74:  A group party. 

B.75:  -- maybe thirty of us on the boat.  We, we weren't all related, just, you
know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there. 

A.76:  Yeah. 

B.77:  If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day. 

A.78:  Yeah. 

B.79:  But this is great, because it was, I think it was nineteen dollars for five
hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something. 

A.80:  Uh-huh. 

B.81:  You know, so you'd get to go out there for, five-, for, for six hours and
get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, [breathing] and fish all
day.  It's really nice {pause}. It's real enjoyable.

A.82:  Yeah.  Well, I, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not. 

B.83:  I think we're probably close, though. 

A.84:  Yeah.  It's nice talking to you. 

B.85:  Nice talking to you, too.  Good luck with fishing this season. 

A.86:  Good luck. 

B.87:  Bye-bye. 

A.88:  Bye-bye.
