============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [laughter].  

B.2:  [Talking] [laughter].  

A.3:  Where to start.  

B.4:  Well, I think, uh, I haven't had that much, of course I just heard, but I
haven't had that much time to think about it, either. [breathing] I guess
the, uh, biggest thing I f-, find is the financial --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- aspects, uh, particularly, the ability of people to access, you know,
your financial records or, for example your credit, uh, rating --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- almost at will.  

A.9:  That's true.  I didn't think about that.  

B.10:  And, uh, [breathing] of course ((flying)), uh, using your Social
Security number, of course, permits people to do that --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- and almost anything you do now, a Social Security number is required.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  And, uh, of course there's another aspect of this, too, uh, in terms of
invasion of privacy I just thought about it, being a professional and, of
course, you probably belong to [breathing] one or more professional
organizations, and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing
lists --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- which I think is a, is an invasion of privacy.  

A.17:  I agree [laughter].  

B.18:  [Laughter].  

A.19:  Yes, I get some of these things in the mail that I wonder, where in the
world did they get my address or where did they get my name [laughter].

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And in fact, some of these things I get, some of these questionnaires, it's
funny because I'm, I was in the process of filling one out when I decided I
would make this phone call, but [breathing], uh, I haven't got to the end
of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything, but, when
you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it, your salary
information, I, I just have a real hard time doing that, uh, and they ask you
what type of household items do you own, like stereos and T V -s and V C R -s
and, and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what
types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make and you wonder,
well, who's going to get ahold of this and think, um, that's a nice place to
go rob [laughter].

B.22:  And not only that, it, it opens you to {pause} [ringing] phone
solicitations --

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  -- and I, I've noticed more and more I would say over the last six months
--

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- I am getting more at home phone solicitations -- 

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- for a variety of things from,

A.29:  I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down to eat dinner, carpet
cleaning [laughter].

B.30:  I've had them for carpet cleaning, I've had them for, of course, for, you
know, real estate investments --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- you know, you get, uh, please send in your, uh, you know, this
particular card and you get, uh, a free trip or something along those lines.

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  And so, that, uh, that bothers me because I, of course, I enjoy being at
home and I do not enjoy getting called by strangers --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- uh, particularly solicit-, you know, soliciting.  So, g-, having your,
and I know that a lot of these, of course, are random phone calls --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- they just, you know, start going through the phone book or going through
a series of numbers, but some of them are sold, and I know you talking about
mailing lists, the [breathing], I, there is one particular group to which I
belong and for some, the reason they have three different [talking] names --

A.39:  Um.  

B.40:  -- for me.  Now the address is the same -- 

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- you know, my, my office address [breathing].  But they have one
under, you know, my first name, James.  They have one under my first name and
initial --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- middle initial, then they have a, a third one under my, just my two
initials.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And [laughter], and I get mail -- 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- here at home under each of those names.  

A.49:  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.50:  So I know that they have sold their mailing list.  

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  And, uh, [breathing] I think those two things bother me more than
anything else --

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  -- as far as an invasion of privacy.  And, uh, I can't really think of
anything else offhand, that, uh, 

A.55:  I think I dislike the phone number part the worst.  I mean, it's, it's one
thing to get junk mail because you can, you can just put it right in the
trash, but it's the phone calls, and, you know, usually when they call you,
it's going to be when you s-, right when you sit down to dinner because they
know, they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you
right when, when you've just gotten home from work.  The last thing you want
is a phone call [laughter] unless it's, you know, something halfway enjoyable,
but if it's a salesperson, it's just something you don't want to have to mess
with.  And, and I've gotten a lot of them lately, or I'll, sometimes I come
home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and I'm
just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and,
[breathing] I wasn't home, and they'll probably call me up and, you know, call
me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on, but --

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- I find that very annoying [breathing].  The, uh, mail stuff, yeah,
you know, it's kind of irritating, but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the
phone calls.

B.58:  I think, I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner,

A.59:  [Laughter].  

B.60:  I know when I sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity,
you know, to talk --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- and see what's going on and all those things, even if friends call
[laughter] --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- it irritates me.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  So I try to, I actually during that period of time from, you know, usually
from six o'clock or six thirty, whenever I get home, until eight or so, I will
shut off the phone --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- and, uh, my daughter gets irate [laughter], 

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  when I, when I do that because, you know, she's a teenager --

A.71:  Uh, oh. 

B.72:  -- so she'll, you know, why are you cutting off the phone,

A.73:  [Laughter].  

B.74:  I might get an important phone call, but,

A.75:  Right.  

B.76:  So tho-, I guess those three things are the, uh, uh, most irritating to me.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  I agree with the phone, too, in that, I'm single, but when I come
home from work, there's times I need to pay bills, I need to balance my
checking account, I need to do all kinds of different things like that, and
even though it's friends calling, sometimes you just feel like, this is my
quiet time, I need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me, but
that's, that's where answering machines are nice, because if it's really
important they'll leave a message and I can call them back [laughter].

B.78:  That's right.  

A.79:  But, uh, at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in,
sometimes it is just, I just want to get away from the phone ringing because
it, it really does annoy me.  And, uh, if I've had a lot of phone calls during
the day when occasionally when we have, uh, like this past week, we have to do
a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system,
and, uh, phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want
to do is have to answer the phone.  And if it's some salesman, that just makes
it even that much worse.  And, uh, it just, I get to where I, I turn the
answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone, but now with this
thing I'm participating in, I kind of have to answer it, [laughter] because
you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's, uh, you know, somebody
calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone.

B.80:  Well I have, now we have a, you know, voice mail system at, uh, at the
office.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  Now what I have done is, I have forwarded my home phone -- 

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  -- to the answering service at the office --  

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- so that I do not have to have a, uh -- 

A.87:  A ring at all.  

B.88:  -- a ring at all.  

A.89:  Oh, huh.  That's an idea [laughter].  

B.90:  If I, if I want to do that.  

A.91:  Right.  

B.92:  And, uh, or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know
that it will forward to, uh, to the office.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  And so it's, you know, it makes it convenient.  But at the office when I,
you know, we can, uh, on our system, and I imagine on most systems [breathing]
you can just route it directly to the answering service.

A.95:  Yeah.  Ours is that way, too.  

B.96:  And when I, when I want to be, you know, not bothered during the day,
that's exactly what I do.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  And so, uh,

A.99:  Well, yours is probably the same as ours.  It's, uh, ((Tigon)), isn't
((Tigon)), uh, part of G T E or vice versa or something like that.

B.100:  Uh.  

A.101:  Seems I read,

B.102:  Yeah, well ((Tigon)) is part of G T E.  

A.103:  Okay.  

B.104:  [Laughter].  

A.105:  Okay that's it, that G T E had purchased ((Tigon)) and, 

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  Yeah, that's what we have.  

B.108:  Except we call it Aspen.  

A.109:  Aspen?  

B.110:  Yes.  

A.111:  Huh [laughter].  

B.112:  [Laughter] And, uh, we,

A.113:  I couldn't remember in ((Tigon)) had purchased G T E -s phone mail services
or if G T E had purchased ((Tigon)).  I knew there was some type of a tie in
there.  I remember reading in the paper a few months back but,

B.114:  Yeah, G T E purchased ((Tigon)).  

A.115:  Okay.  

B.116:  And so, we had, had been using a, the Aspen service before they purchased
((Tigon)) --

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  -- so I imagine we will be, uh, shifting over to that service --

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  -- uh, for a while, or if, in a while [breathing].  

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  As soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought
Contel [laughter].

A.123:  Oh, no.

@@B.124:  [Breathing] Yeah.  Oh, Dana, I think we have probably conversed long
enough.

A.125:  I think we did, 

B.126:  Well,

A.127:  that's good [laughter].  

B.128:  All right.  

A.129:  I didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing, but, uh,

B.130:  [Laughter].  

A.131:  I guess it's close enough [laughter].  

B.132:  All right, well thank you for calling.  I ha-, I,

A.133:  Sure, good talking to you, Jim.  

B.134:  I enjoyed talking to you.  

A.135:  All right.  Bye-bye.  

B.136:  Take care.
