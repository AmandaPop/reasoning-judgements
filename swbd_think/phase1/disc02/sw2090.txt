============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess its recording.  Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?  Do you
sing or knit or anything?

@B.2:  Well, I, um, I do cross-stitch and I enjoy reading and playing softball.

A.3:  Okay.  I, uh, I started knitting awhile ago, I knitted I didn't know, even
know what the stitch is called.  I just had this, uh, uh, piece of yarn and I
wanted to start something so I remembered something I learned I think when I
was five years old [laughter].  So I kept doing that, and now I have a
little blanket but that's all I've done.

B.4:  Oh, really.

A.5:  Uh.

B.6:  Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, um, made a few
things but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
[laughter].

A.7:  Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?

B.8:  Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings, you
could make the, like the granny squares or whatever,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some
slippers or something like that.

A.11:  Oh.  I see.

B.12:  Nothing as big as a blanket.

A.13:  Huh.

B.14:  I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff but,

A.17:  I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  I don't know why.  It's just too time consuming.

B.20:  Yeah, do you have any other hobbies?

A.21:  Um, I like to sing.  I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things
like that.

B.22:  Oh, well that's good.

A.23:  Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter.  But, uh, if I could do
anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally.  But um,

B.24:  So are you on the T V then?

A.25:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.26:  Oh.

A.27:  I'm in, uh, I work for channel six in Waco.

B.28:  Oh, okay.

A.29:  And so I do little news reports and things.  It's not as exciting as it
[laughter],

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  as it sounds.  But, um,

B.32:  So you don't have too much time for hobbies?

A.33:  No, not much, um, my day is usually pretty full.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  My schedule is like from nine to five thirty, but I could be at work from
anytime, you know, from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever, so it's
hard to make plans much less, you know, have a hobby.  And even if I had a
hobby like knitting or something and I wanted to take it to work, I'd probably
never get to it.

B.36:  Yeah [laughter].

A.37:  You know, so.  What do you do?

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  Normally.

B.40:  I'm a housewife.

A.41:  Oh, okay.

B.42:  So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either
[laughter].

A.43:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].

B.44:  But I've made a, um, few things, cross-stitch things.  I really enjoy doing
that.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And um, I made, uh, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas
tree shirt and that,

A.47:  Oh.

B.48:  type of thing, and it just takes a long time to get it done but, you
know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to,

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  to see it.

A.51:  I show-, I showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like, you didn't make
that.

B.52:  Really?  [laughter].

A.53:  Oh, yeah, it looks, uh, halfway decent actually, [laughter] first thing I
did but,

B.54:  I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long.  [Background
noise].

A.55:  Yeah.  How many children do you have?

B.56:  Two.

A.57:  Oh, okay.  I hear them in the background ((there)).

B.58:  Yeah [laughter].

A.59:  All right, that's a hobby in itself.

B.60:  Not ((quite)) [laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter]  A job in itself.

B.62:  It's a fulltime job, yeah.

A.63:  [Laughter]  Right now I was just sitting here watching T V, I was getting
ready to fall asleep.

B.64:  So, um, have you sang at any weddings yet?

A.65:  Yeah, I sang at one last summer.  Um, it was my first wedding.  I've done,
um, little commercials and background singing and, um, I sang all through
college and things like that but I really haven't done anything really,
professional per se.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  But I did one wedding last year and, uh, I just now got some cards
together, kind of, uh, business cards that say,

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  singer, and what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or
something, and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops, I mean
when someone comes in,

B.70:  Oh, that's a good place, yeah.

A.71:  you know, for a wedding, for a wedding dress,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  and they, they might ask about it.  This one woman even wanted me to
bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, you know, if any one wants to
listen.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  And, uh, she wanted me to bring it in, she's going to play it on Saturday
so [laughter] that would be great,

B.76:  Yeah [laughter].

A.77:  if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice, but,
[breathing].

B.78:  Well, that's good.

A.79:  I haven't got any calls, yet but I only just put them out this week so,

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  hopefully I'll get some calls in.  Especially now since this, it's spring
and it's the wedding season, I guess.

B.82:  Oh, that's true.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, huh?

A.85:  Yeah, that would be great.  Then I could be getting paid for something I
love to do.

B.86:  Yeah [laughter].

A.87:  Not that I don't like reporting, but, I'd love it.

B.88:  Did you have training in singing when you were,

A.89:  [Throat_clearing].

B.90:  younger then or,

A.91:  No, I've never, I've never had, uh, formal training.  I've just been
singing every chance I get.  I try, you know,

B.92:  Choirs and that kind of stuff?

A.93:  in school and, yeah, choirs and, um, when I was at U T, I was in a group
called Ensemble One oh Nine, just twelve singers and we did, uh, little
conventions and, um, uh, like dinner parties and things like that.

B.94:  Huh.

A.95:  Sing pop music.

B.96:  Well, that's nice.

A.97:  So, that's what got me really, really interested in it.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time.

B.100:  Yeah, not just give up your job and jump right into it [laughter].

A.101:  Yeah, exactly.  My parents would have a fit probably.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  But, uh, I think, I either have a call or, yeah, I do have a call, hold on
one second.

B.104:  Uh-huh. [Children talking, background noises].  {Long pause in
conversation}.

A.105:  Hello.

B.106:  Yes.

@@A.107:  Yes, okay that's my mother on the other line, I need to go,

B.108:  Oh.

A.109:  but, um, I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to
hear a beep or anything?

B.110:  I don't know, I've only done this one other time and I thought that the man
told me five minutes.

A.111:  Oh, okay, my mother said ten minutes so, I don't know.

B.112:  #Oh, okay.#

A.113:  #But, uh,# okay well, it was nice talking to you and,

B.114:  It was nice talking to you, too, #good luck with your singing.#

A.115:  #and good luck with your hobbies [laughter].#

B.116:  Okay, #bye.#

A.117:  #Thanks,# bye.
