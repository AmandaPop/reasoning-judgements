==============================================================================

A.1:  All right, uh, I, I would like to talk about, just briefly
[throat_clearing] What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political
context.  I think it's, uh, refreshing to see the, uh, the support that the
President got from the American people.

B.2:  Yeah, it, we, I, I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed,
uh, that, uh, seemed that every other time a President tried to get support
for an action like, uh, uh, President Carter and his thing with the, the
hostage crisis,

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  and he always did it through rhetoric.

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  And this time President Bush did it through action and he,

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support,

A.9:  Yes.

B.10:  or, uh, I mean, he left almost no alternative.

A.11:  That's right [throat_clearing].

B.12:  And, and it was very interesting how he did it and, uh, I mean, I'm, I'm
an Air Force Officer, so it, uh,

A.13:  Really.

B.14:  it was interesting for me, uh, you know, I'd certainly, uh, I, I mean I
think it's great that all the support.  I have, uh, friends of mine from the
Air, I'm, I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory,

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  but other engi-, guys here on base, this is a B fifty-two base where I
work, so,

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and
they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it.

A.19:  That's great, um, if, if you remember, the vote in the Congress to
authorize war, if necessary, was actually pretty close.

B.20:  Yes it was.

A.21:  And if, if my memory serves me right, I believe a majority of Democrats may
even have opposed it, it, it was,

B.22:  Yeah, I'm, I don't know the exact figure but I, I would imagine that
because of the, how close the, the vote was I'm, uh, I mean almost certainly
would have to be.  Just based on the sheer numbers of, uh, the disparity of,
[cough] excuse me, Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it
would have to have been, um.

A.23:  That's right.

B.24:  And, uh, I, I gosh this, uh, this whole thing now with all the, uh, all the
political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're, uh, uh,

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  they're in, in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential
election, anyway.

A.27:  Especially the ones that came out and said, oh come on guys, let's talk
about this little while longer.

B.28:  Yeah, yeah.

A.29:  I mean how many years are we going to wait and, and what, what do you do
with the people that are over there in the mean time.

B.30:  Right, right, I think that was, all those factors played a part in, you
know, uh, the,

A.31:  No doubt.

B.32:  everyone was discussing whether we should, uh, wait longer, but, I, I, I
know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer but I think we were
genuinely concerned about how, their military capability and we, uh, I think
we over estimated it, but still,

A.33:  I think so too.

B.34:  we were really, highly concerned about it and, that we were worried that
they were getting dug in and, uh.

A.35:  Well they were, 

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  and in fact they were so well dug in that, uh, when we sent our tanks
around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time.

B.38:  Right, they couldn't, yeah they couldn't, yeah, it's true they, Saddam
thought he had the whole thing, uh, figured out to, to which way we were
coming and which, what, what our doctrine was that, uh, 

A.39:  Well, had, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more
to his favor.

B.40:  That's right, that's true.  That's interesting, I think, uh, this political
situation over there now is, uh, uh, it'll be interesting to see what comes
out of it whether the, this opposition will, uh, uh, today the Turks, uh,
agreed to support the Kurds, which is something they've never done before and,
uh.

A.41:  Um, interesting.

B.42:  And, uh, this, and the Israelis, uh, and not the Israelis but the Arabs
all of a sudden are, uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive for, to reconcile
relations with the Israelis, so it's like [laughter],

A.43:  Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel.  

B.44:  Yeah I, 

A.45:  And did you know John Sununu is, uh, half Arab?

B.46:  No, uh, I, I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago,

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  because I used to live in, uh, Massachusetts, but, uh, 

A.49:  Right, in, in fact, when he was Governor of New Hampshire, I believe.

B.50:  Yeah, New Hampshire.

A.51:  Okay.  I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against
some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back.

B.52:  Oh my gosh.

A.53:  And, uh, now he is a conservative, but he is not a conservative that favors
Israel,

B.54:  Uh.

A.55:  and that, that concerns me greatly.

B.56:  Well, I don't, yeah, I'd certainly, uh, support Israel in, in their, their
policy that in defending themselves and in, uh, in their handling of their
foreign policy, I think, I think the stand they have, or, or the way the
command respect, I, I support that.  I think that is a, a positive thing for
them after, um, uh, thousands of years, they have to, uh, they ha-, I think
they in, when they be-, became a country they more than, or, more or less
decided they weren't going to take it anymore, and, uh.

A.57:  Well, they didn't have much choice, they could either fight or die.

B.58:  Yeah, exactly, exactly and, uh, um, so, gee, I lost my train of thought
here.  But, uh, um, so, okay so I can't say whether that, that I'm pro Israel
or anti Israel.  I mean, I'd like to see them resolve something in that
situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh, that the joining
of forces for this, uh, uh, Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up
being a positive thing.

A.59:  It is a positive thing, um, however, uh, every time an organization such as
the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, uh, they get
embarrassed some, every few months by documents that reveal that their
ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  And so you, you basically have, uh, mutually exclusive interests, either
Israel is going to occupy the area, or the Arabs are going to occupy the area
and I'm just not sure that, that there's going to be any easy permanent
solution.

B.62:  Yeah, somebody's going to, and I think that's the problem the P L O has is
that when they, whenever one group of them decides that they're going to
negotiate, or they're going to do something, they're going to try to make some
peace, but, uh, the end result is that they, there so many factions of them
and, uh, some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different
than the others, or they split, they end up being, becoming divisive
themselves.

A.63:  Exactly.

B.64:  Uh, I, it's interesting, 

A.65:  It is.

B.66:  I, I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next
couple of months, but, uh, that's,

A.67:  Yeah, I, I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud
attacks.

B.68:  Yeah, I know, that, that is almost, I mean that's absolutely unprecedented
that was,

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  an, an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and
the State Department.

A.71:  Exactly, exactly.

B.72:  And that, I mean that's never happened before,

A.73:  No.

B.74:  and I don't know if it will ever happen again but,

A.75:  May not.  Well it's been fun, I enjo-, enjoyed talking with you.

B.76:  Yeah, okay, uh, I guess, uh, well maybe the computer will pair us up
together another time.

A.77:  You never know.

B.78:  All right.

A.79:  #Bye, bye.#

B.80:  #Bye, bye.#
