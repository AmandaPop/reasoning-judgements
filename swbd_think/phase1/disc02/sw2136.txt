============================================================================

A.1:  Did they say anything?  

B.2:  No.  

A.3:  I guess we got ten minutes or something like that, I don't know.

B.4:  Oh, okay.  

A.5:  So what do you think?  

B.6:  Uh, I think they should do it.  

A.7:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.8:  I, I do.  Because, uh, with all, all the sports, you know, and everything
they're doing there, and also because whenever you're dealing with drugs like
if, if you are on drugs, then that affects the way you work and everything.

A.9:  Uh-huh {pause}.  I agree, but I think they're slow [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  In testing, you know, I don't know about yours but my state's so slow, they
tested some people twice, three times and some people haven't been tested at
all.

B.12:  Oh, really?  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Well, see, uh, and I worked for a steel mill the past two summers --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- and I had to go through, you know, a physical and everything and before
they even told you you were hired, like, they just called me in for an
interview and I went in for my interview and then right there he said, okay go
down to the company hospital and you'll go through a physical.  So, you know,
I mean it was really good that way because they, they tested everyone right
away --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and you didn't, you didn't have any notice, you know, so, like, if you
were doing drugs, then, like, you didn't have a way, you know, to stop, I mean
it was still in your body.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  I like that.  I know when I, I was in, that like (( )) in the service and
we didn't have, we used to have to go every other month or whenever --

B.22:  Uh-huh.   

A.23:  -- to, uh, just do, d-, we called it the golden flow, but [laughter] and
they did random drug testing just because, you know, Uncle Sam.  But I've
always thought that they were slow as far as outside of the government, you
know --

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  -- because I've al-, I'm, I'm use to it.  

B.26:  Oh, really?  

A.27:  It's no big deal.  

B.28:  Yeah.  Well, see, you know, I, well,

A.29:  I guess if you're not doing anything it's no big deal.  People call it
invasion of privacy.  Not, to me it's not, because first of all if you're not
doing anything, they're not invading anything.

B.30:  Right.  

A.31:  You know, and if you're taking medication from a doctor, that's no big deal
either.

B.32:  Yeah, because, like wha-,

A.33:  Because then they'll, or you have a prescription.  

B.34:  Yeah, you know what, too, whenever they did that for me, like, you know, we
had to take, they did it blood and urine, and, uh, they, they gave you a paper
right there and they said if you were out drinking or if you went out for a
good time last night go ahead and write down that you did have beer or you did
have alcohol or if you are on medicine, go ahead and write down what medicine
you are on.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  Okay, but, I, you know, so they allotted for, you know, things like that,
like, you know, people didn't know they were being tested.  Well, you might
have had a drink last night, you know, and that would show up, too.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  Well, see, they don't do a blood test to us.  They just do a urine test,
which I think they should do a, a blood test because then that tells them,
that, you know, they testing for drugs, but I think it's like I tell, and
then, you know, they have all this smoking stuff, why don't they just test for
alcohol because that's, between drugs and alcohol that's it.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  That's the biggest killer there is.  I think they should do both of them.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  You know, because then that, that way they'll, they'll get rid of
[breathing], they can help the alkies and then they can help the people that's
on drugs.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  You know.  

B.46:  And then, uh, it got, you know, it got backfired on a lot of kids, too.
To a lot of kids, uh, like, you know, like, somehow they missed the physical
or something --

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  -- you know, and they wrote down that they, uh, weren't, but then they went
back and they checked them, like maybe a week after they were working and if
they had drugs in their body, I mean they were fired on the spot.

A.49:  Huh.  

B.50:  There was no ifs, ands or buts about it.  

A.51:  Oh, yeah.  

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  That's all right.  

B.54:  Yeah, yeah.  I think this way, too because in that steel mill, I mean
someone,

A.55:  And see, some people always talk about the kind of job you do,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  but it would, that wouldn't be fair.  If they tested just people with
strenuous jobs.

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  Because, you know, you, you, got your, your, your pilots and your, your air
traffic controllers, your nurses, your doctors.

B.60:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.61:  Yes, I would want all those people checked, but then you got your bus
drivers, your truck drivers are checked because my husband drives a truck.
They, he has to pass a physical.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  You know.  But I think why don't they, and, and to me it's wrong to check
just the people that you think are affecting the public --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- you know.  

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  Why not just check everybody, so.  

B.68:  Yeah, see they checked everyone in the mill, too, and then that was hard
because, you know, someone would come in and they had a problem, well then if
I, like some of the jobs I was doing was very dangerous, you know.  We were
working with that steel that's thousands of degrees hot, and I would have to
cover for him, you know, like I would have to do two jobs for someone just
because they, they think they're being smart or something.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  You know, and, I mean, they even had, uh, the, the higher up management
people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks, you know --

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  -- so it was really good, you know, they were checking, you know, visually
and, uh, with the blood and the urine tests.

A.73:  Well, that's all right.  

B.74:  Yeah, I thought it was really good.  

A.75:  Because, they check our bosses and everything and I think that's the way it
should be.  If they going to check, you know, that way you can't stay, well
they didn't check my boss, you know, yeah, they checked him, too [laughter].

B.76:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.  

A.77:  So, everybody's getting checked.  It's not like it's just little peons,
it's everybody.

B.78:  Right.  

A.79:  And th-, that's the way I think they should do it.  That way it is random,
you know it's random because some people is already gone two, three times and
some people ain't went at all.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  And they just, when your number comes up, your number comes up [laughter].

B.82:  Yeah, right.  And then, uh, they checked us, like once during the middle of
the summer also.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  You know, like, it's not like they just, like, well, then the second time
when I got hired I knew what was coming, you know, so then they checked us
again in the middle of the summer.

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  So, I thought that was really good, too.  I don't, I,

A.87:  Well, I think if you're doing something really bad it's going to show up.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  You know.  

B.90:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.91:  I don't think you can hide certain drugs [laughter].  

B.92:  [Laughter] No I think it, what is it, like, I know, even, even, like,
ster-, well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body?

A.93:  That's thirty days.  

B.94:  See, so there still,

A.95:  They said it was thirty days, but, (( )) on one of ((my our)) our thingies
they said that you'd have to, the way the test is, you'd have to really be
smoking for it to show up, and I don't think that's right.

B.96:  Oh, really?  

A.97:  That's what he told,

B.98:  I thought it would show up with, no matter what amount (( )),

A.99:  That's what they tell you, but I think it is.  I think it'd show up no
matter what.  If you doing it, then it's going to show up.

B.100:  Yeah.  And, and steroids, I mean, that kind of drug, that's a lot longer.

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  That takes a lot longer to get out of your body.  

A.103:  I think they should check everybody everywhere that's working, because, see
((they got this)), and that's just like even all the football players, yeah I
think they ought to check [static] them because you get kids looking up to
them and here they are strung out on drugs.  What good is that?

B.104:  That's right, yeah.  

A.105:  You know, that's not good.  

B.106:  And, e-, and even, uh, I don't know, sometimes I think they should even
check the, the music, you know, the entertainment.

A.107:  Oh, yeah.  Because the, the,

B.108:  With, with, uh, the movie stars, 

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  and, and the singers and everything.  

A.111:  Because they get strung out, too.  

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  They're no different.  

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  But, I guess, you know, that's they contract.  They don't,

B.116:  And they're out winning awards, 

A.117:  But yet,

B.118:  you know, and then, and then the younger kids think they're
great and everything.  

A.119:  And then they're strung out on drugs secretly.  

B.120:  Exactly.  

A.121:  You know, they go off, because they have a drug problem.  

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  Huh-uh [laughter].  

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  That's not right.  

B.126:  You know what I think's I bunch of bull, too, is whenever, uh, they, uh,
really, you know, like nationwide or, you know, popular people, they do have a
problem and they come out and they say they're having the problem, so then
they get more publicity because they admitted they have a problem and they're
trying to fix it.

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  Well, what about the Joe Shmoe who's an alcoholic and he's trying to fix
it, you know, but he's not getting any,

A.129:  He, they're not testing him, 

B.130:  Y-,

A.131:  because they only testing for drugs.  

B.132:  Yeah, right.  

A.133:  And I think they should test for alcohol.  

B.134:  Uh-huh.  

A.135:  Because we have some alkies, too, boy.  You can smell it on they breath.

B.136:  [Laughter].  

A.137:  You know it's bad when you can smell alcohol on somebody, but there's
nothing you can do because they not drunk.

B.138:  [Laughter].  

A.139:  But you know they drink constantly, 

B.140:  Uh-huh.   

A.141:  to get that breath smell.  

B.142:  Yeah.  

A.143:  You know.  But I said no, they, they getting on the smokers and stuff, but
I think, I, because like I told one guy, I says smokers don't kill people in a
wreck from being smoking.

B.144:  That's right.  

A.145:  You know, drunk people, 

B.146:  That's true.  

A.147:  kill people from being drunk.  

B.148:  I never thought of it that way, but that's true.  

A.149:  So why are, you know, why don't they just, to me they ought to just do the
blood test for alcohol --

B.150:  Uh-huh.  

A.151:  -- and I said they'll have more people then.  

B.152:  Yeah, oh, definitely.  

A.153:  I mean, you know, I can understand, like on a Monday,

B.154:  Yeah, but then you can look at it there, too, well, alcohol's legal.

A.155:  Yeah, but so is cigarettes.  

B.156:  Yeah.  

A.157:  You know, so why charge me more.  

B.158:  Uh-huh.  

A.159:  So, you know, drugs is not, is, is not legal, some of them are.

B.160:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.161:  And some people are addicted to prescription drugs.  

B.162:  Exactly, yeah.  

A.163:  And so what's the difference, 

B.164:  Uh-huh.  

A.165:  you know.  They still got a drug habit, but they're legal [laughter].

B.166:  That's true [laughter].  

A.167:  They got a drug problem, but it's legal, you know, 

B.168:  Uh-huh.  

A.169:  it's like, huh-uh, huh-uh, no.  They need, they need some help, too
[laughter].

B.170:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.171:  Because they check those and I know one girl, she was on some kind of
medication, but see, they didn't bother her because she had a prescription.

B.172:  Yeah.  

A.173:  But, I mean, what if she was hooked on them, you know.  

B.174:  That's true.  

A.175:  How they going to know, just because she has a prescription? 

B.176:  How are you going to tell if she's hooked on them?  You'd have to take her
off them, you know, some people, I mean, that's, th-, they, they go off them
and they, they're going to die.

A.177:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So you need to, to me, if they going do a, they need to
keep checking, like if somebody's got some drugs in they system --

B.178:  Uh-huh.  

A.179:  -- and it's all prescription it's fine, but, what kind of drug is it.

B.180:  Yeah.  

A.181:  You know, and then how long are they supposed to take it.  

B.182:  Uh-huh.  

A.183:  If, th-, people have prescriptions for Valium, but they're not supposed to
take Valium twenty-four hours a days, you know, all the time, that's for if
they have a problem.

B.184:  Yeah.  

A.185:  And, and then, see, that way you'll find out if they have a problem because
if they keep taking it, they have a problem --

B.186:  Yeah.  

A.187:  -- or they wouldn't keep taking them [laughter].  

B.188:  Uh-huh.  And then also after, you know, they can find out whenever their
prescription ends and then find out, you know, how long it will take for that
to be out of their system,

A.189:  And test them ag-, and see, 

B.190:  and then test them again.  

A.191:  if they have it again.  

B.192:  Uh-huh.  

A.193:  Uh-huh.  Because you know, they don't give you a whole bunch of them pills.

B.194:  Yeah.  

A.195:  Because they gave my husband some when his mother passed, but that was for,
like, to calm him down.

B.196:  Right.  

A.197:  You know, but see, now they're gone.  

B.198:  Uh-huh.  

A.199:  I think they gave him like four pills [laughter].  

B.200:  Yeah.  

A.201:  And then that was it.  

B.202:  Yeah.  

A.203:  [Laughter].  

B.204:  Uh-huh.  

A.205:  But, see now they, they would out of his system, but if he was to be
tested,
