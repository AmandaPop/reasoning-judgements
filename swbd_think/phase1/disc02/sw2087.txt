===========================================================================

B.1:  So, uh, [throat_clearing] public service, uh, I guess, Peace Corps the one
you think of the most.

A.2:  That's right.  Uh, I think so, I had a sister who is in the Peace Corps, as
a matter of fact.

B.3:  Oh, really.

A.4:  Uh, back when it was, uh, a Kennedy thing, uh, sixty, uh, seven and eight.

B.5:  Yeah.  I've never had any, uh, experience with anyone that I've known
personally in the Peace Corps.  My brother was, uh, he did a little, uh, guess
you would call it kind of like missionary work to Liberia one time,

A.6:  Huh-uh. 

B.7:  when he was younger. 

A.8:  Well, I feel like if it were, we are, if everyone had an equivalent
requirement, such that it were inescapable, and I think that, that, that would
be important for me that, that there wasn't that it was optional, that if, if
every person and I could pick a time, I guess, rather than worrying about
whether it was one years or two years.  Suppose it were to be eighteen months.
Uh, if every citizen were required to participate in public service and could
choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any
given time and could not get out of that, no matter what, short of
dysfunctional handicap, you know, that the person were just unable to
participate, I guess, I would not be against that as a requirement.  I, I'm
not sure the country needs it, but I don't know that I would be against it and
it seems to be it would be important that nobody could, could, could opt out.

B.9:  I think, uh, I think I kind of agree I think that, uh, you know, public
service is, uh, basically if you tie it in with, uh, a, you know, a military
option if you have, a if have that requirement, I think that, uh, this ought
to be an option at least, you know, to be, uh, some sort of either domestic
public service or a foreign type of Peace Corps type of thing.

A.10:  It seems that you could have a menu where, depending on the needs for jobs
you could reward them differently and then let people compete for them if you,
you know, I could envision somebody saying by the time you were twenty-five or
pick some clock age that, that would say you would have to give a certain
number of years and you could say well, well I could go in the army, I could
go in the navy, I could go into civil service, I could be a forest ranger, a
hospital attendant or whatever.  And, I guess some jobs that might be higher
risk you might want to compensate with, some reward that was higher, 

B.11:  Yeah or maybe uh 

A.12:  which would

B.13:  Yeah you maybe might adjust the time uh you know 

A.14:  Oh, yeah that's interesting.  Uh, like you can go, go in the army for
eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something.

B.15:  [Laughter] Something like that.  I think they do that, we have a German
exchange student living with us and he said they do that, something like that
in Germany.

A.16:  Huh-uh. 

B.17:  They have, uh, some kind of service that they have to go into.

A.18:  How do you feel about whether it's necessary or not, uh, uh, it seems like
we tend to be, seem to be focused in on it, as long as it were equal and
equitable it would be okay, but, uh, how do you feel about whether it's
something that the country needs or what the benefits would be?

B.19:  I think, uh, I think there's a number of reasons that it would be good to
have it as a requirement, uh, one being for the, uh, benefit of the youth or
the individual them self.  I think that, uh, there's a lot to be gained and a
certain amount of discipline and, uh, you know, self, self control and self
gain by, uh, certain public service, plus, you know, feeling of satisfaction
and what have you.

A.20:  Um-hum. So you're saying,

B.21:  So I think, uh, you know, also, there's probably a lot to be said for, uh,
you know, the good that would be, uh, become of the public service works.  It
might be, uh, an aspect that might be helpful. Uh-huh.

A.22:  Uh-huh. {voices begin to echo}. Yeah, it seems to me like there's a lot of
infrastructure problems that we're accumulating in the United States that, 
uh, we could address with, with
manpower, everything from like, well like national parks began to be in a
state of decline because we can't fund their repair and some of them were
built in a period during the depression when there were deliberate programs
put in place to get them to get people occupied and so we put millions and
millions of person hours into developing some of the parks systems and we
can't afford to keep up and we probably, in order to return them to a state of
a usefulness, we'd have to invest those same person hours, but we couldn't pay
regular wages and, uh, I guess it wouldn't bother me if the wages were barely
scale or subscale if it were a sacrifice that everyone made.

B.23:  Yeah, I, uh, I think I agree, uh, like I guess I had that in the back of my
mind like the ((W P A)) and some of those,

A.24:  Huh-uh. 

B.25:  certain type of projects.

A.26:  So I wouldn't, I guess, I wouldn't feel like there would be a required
compensation as any sort of, uh, the army approach, room, board and forty
bucks a month to, uh, spend at the P X  [laughter].

B.27:  Oh you're dating yourself there [laughter]. 
That uh that was about the pay when I think I was in [laughter].

A.28:  [Laughter]  Yeah. Well, that would be back in the, and he didn't have much more
than that, uh, back in the sixties or so.  I mean, it's a little more money
than that, but it wasn't very much.  It was, you, you didn't do much other
than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife.

B.29:  Yeah, exactly. But, uh, you know, I think the experience itself is positive. 

A.30:  Okay.  I think it's good that people feel that they commit themselves to a
country or to, that they've, if you offer of yourself you feel differently
afterwards, I think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as
opposed to, expect everything to be given to you.

B.31:  Yeah.  I agree with that.

A.32:  Interesting.  It appears that we've come to an agreement {echo}.

B.33:  Have we [laughter]?  We can't argue the point very much.

@@A.34:  Okay.  Thanks for calling. 

B.35:  Yeah, uh, so long from Houston. 

A.36:  Okay and from Raleigh.  Bye. 

B.37:  Bye, bye.
