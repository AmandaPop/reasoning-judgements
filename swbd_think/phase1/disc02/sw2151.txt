=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  

A.2:  Okay.  

B.3:  Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public
service work for a year?  Do you think it's a [breathing],

@A.4:  Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.  I think they should either do
that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.

B.5:  Yes, yes, def-, 

A.6:  I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the
country that could use some help and I think that before we expend all our
young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps
give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and --

B.7:  That's true.  

A.8:  -- I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea and, or the military for a year
or two,

B.9:  Yeah. 

A.10:  wouldn't be bad for, I think it teaches kids how to grow.  How about
yourself?

B.11:  Uh, I agree with you.  Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back [breathing],
well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of, i-, i-,
you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts
[children] or Girl Scouts and they did, do, do do a lot of public service
activities, but these days they're not, uh, par-, parents aren't encouraging
their kids to do things like that.  Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we
did a lot of public service things, because that's just part o-, of, of the
scouting, and, you know.

A.12:  Yeah, I've, I've, that's really great.  I, I really think that both the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.

B.13:  They are but parents, 

A.14:  You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall
out of that,

B.15:  Yeah, they do.  

A.16:  and they don't follow it at all, you know.  There are very few Scouts go
on,

B.17:  Oh, no.  

A.18:  and become Eagle Scouts.  And, and I don't know what the high rank is for
the gals but,

B.19:  I, I, uh, senior.  

A.20:  Oh.  Senior, okay.  So, there's not, uh,

B.21:  Oh, they're just not, once they get into junior high it just,

A.22:  Yeah, they, they lose interest.  

B.23:  not done anymore [children].  

A.24:  and then when they young, young adults, 

B.25:  Uh-huh.  

A.26:  there's even less interest there.  They're more for, I g-,

B.27:  Me [laughter].  

A.28:  Not, not, yeah.  

B.29:  Grab, grab, grab, walk out [laughter].  

A.30:  Yeah, you're absolutely right [laughter].  

B.31:  Yeah [sniffing].

A.32:  I think it's a really a good thing.  I, I like to see, of course, there's,
you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help [laughter].

B.33:  Yeah, but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country,

A.34:  But I think, 

B.35:  too.  

A.36:  we ought to start right here at home.  I'm, you know,

B.37:  Yeah, uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas
would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young k-, people.

A.38:  No, it, it,

B.39:  But, since there is much that needs to be done here.  

A.40:  I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done
here and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much
broader outlook.

B.41:  Uh-huh.  

@@A.42:  Well, it's been really good.  We talked about this for a few minutes,
and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,
but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.

B.43:  No, I, I agree with you [laughter].  

A.44:  It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing,

B.45:  Yeah.

A.46:  that they should do sometime.  

B.47:  Okay.  

A.48:  Well you take care, and, and, 

B.49:  You, too.  

A.50:  enjoy the day.  

B.51:  You, too.  

A.52:  Thank you, ma'am.  Bye-bye.  

B.53:  Bye-bye.
