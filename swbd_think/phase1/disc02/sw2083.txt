============================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  So, how do you feel about camping do you do it often? 

A.3:  I haven't in a while, but I do enjoy it when I get to go. 

B.4:  #Uh-huh.#

A.5:  #The last# time I went camping was, um, in San Antonio,

B.6:  #Okay.#

A.7:  #Texas.# 

B.8:  #Where,#

A.9:  #And, uh,#

B.10:  where did you go there? 

A.11:  Um, in a park.  Guadalupe State Park, or Guadalupe River State Park.

B.12:  Okay.

A.13:  And then, I guess before that the last time I went camping, was up on,
backpacking up on the Continental Divide,

B.14:  #Oh, that must have been great.#

A.15:  #in Colorado.#  Yeah for two weeks, it was pretty fun 
#[laughter].#


B.16:  #Yeah,# I use to live in Colorado and did, did some camping up there.

A.17:  Oh, really?

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  #Where# would you go camping?

B.20:  Um, well the best place we went was, uh, the great Sand Dunes National
Monument.

A.21:  Uh-huh, I've been there.

B.22:  Yeah, I just love that place.  I've gone there twice.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And, uh, it's really neat there's all kinds of jeep trails and the, the
Dunes themself, and it's a lot of fun.

A.25:  #Huh.#

B.26:  #I like# the place.

A.27:  Um, I guess in Colorado, I'm trying to think of the place we went was in
Pagosa Springs, and we went up kind of in the Southwest corner of Colorado.

B.28:  Okay, near Mesa Verdes?

A.29:  Yeah, yeah, because we went, isn't Mesa Verdes where they have the, the
cliff dwellings?

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  Okay.  Yeah, we went by there and then we went to, on to Pagosa Springs
[static].

B.32:  Okay.

A.33:  And wh-, that's, that's when we got the packs and, and you had to put
everything #for a week,#

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  #on your back [laughter],#

B.36:  #Yeah, I've# #done some of that.#

A.37:  #and there was# no showers no nothing for a week [laughter],

B.38:  #Yeah.#

A.39:  #it was# pretty interesting [laughter].  It was [/static] quite an
experience and this was in the middle of the summer and we woke up one morning
and it snowed for about fifteen minutes.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  But it didn't last,

B.42:  That's great.

A.43:  any amount of time.

B.44:  Yeah I've taken about four trips across country,

A.45:  #Uh-huh.#

B.46:  #I'm originally# from the East Coast, but I, uh, took four, let's see twice
to California and once to, and twice to Wyoming.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And, uh, most recently I've just been camping with, in North Carolina.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And one of the best trips we took in last year we, uh, a whole bunch of us,
um, packed up all the our gear in sailboats we sailed out to this island on
the North Carolina Coast.

A.51:  Wow.

B.52:  And it, it's a totally deserted island there's no buildings there at all.
It's, it's not really that big it's maybe four or five miles long and a mile
across.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  It's like protected water on the one side and the ocean on the other side,

A.55:  #Well, that sounds like fun.#

B.56:  #and we sailed out there and camped# and it was, it was really neat because
no one was there.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  A little bit cold [laughter].

A.59:  [laughter] #Yeah.#

B.60:  #It's pretty,# it's kind of cold to, to camp on the coast.

A.61:  Yeah, I guess the wind and #everything, uh# ...

B.62:  #Yeah,#

A.63:  #Yeah, uh.#

B.64:  #the wind get's really bad.#

A.65:  I've never camped on the coast before, #I've always thought it would be
fun.#

B.66:  #It's neat to wake up# and go for a walk on the beach.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  I mean, most of time when you go to the beach you're at this real tourist
trap and all these hotels and stuff and this was,

A.69:  #Right.  [laughter].#

B.70:  #just# like paradise.

A.71:  Did you get a lot of sand in your sleeping bag and #everything though
[laughter]?#

B.72:  #Yeah, we had sand pretty much everywhere [laughter].#

A.73:  I can imagine [laughter].

B.74:  Yeah,

A.75:  Sounds like that would be a mess [laughter].

B.76:  a lot of sand and having to haul all, all your stuff there in boats was,
was, wasn't, um, it's more work than a backpacking because you had to worry
about stuff getting wet.

A.77:  Yeah.  I guess that's true too.

B.78:  Yeah, it rained on us on the way home [laughter].

A.79:  Oh, God.

B.80:  I remember coming back into the, uh, port where we left and I had a cooler
on my head as my hat [laughter].

A.81:  #Oh, no.#

B.82:  #And we,# we wrapped ourselves in garbage bags [laughter].

A.83:  God [laughter].

B.84:  We were so cold.

A.85:  #Um.#

B.86:  #But, uh,# No one couldn't, the last time I went ca-, camping was over, uh,
Thanksgiving,

A.87:  #Uh-huh.#

B.88:  #we went camping# up in the Appalachians.

A.89:  Oh, hold on just a moment.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  [beep] Okay. I'm on a cordless phone and every now and then I get
interference and I have to switch the channel [laughter],

B.92:  #Okay.#

A.93:  #I hear# something weird in the background, sorry about that.

B.94:  And we went and, um, this place outside of, uh, Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, and it was really cold [laughter],

A.95:  #Um.#

B.96:  #camping# in, in November.

A.97:  I guess so. I guess it gets pretty cold in that part of country in November.
I mean here it's pretty unpredictable it could be cold or it could be really
warm,

B.98:  #Yeah.#

A.99:  #in that# time of the year, so ...

B.100:  Well, North Carolina's fairly warm all year-round it, it doesn't get much
lower than the thirties, but we're up in the, when you get up in the mountains
it's a little bit different.

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  And, uh ...

A.103:  Well, it's been, I guess the last time I went camping was, well, probably
about two years ago,

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  um, I've been wanting to since then, I just haven't had much of a chance
to.  A bunch of my friends went and camped at the, at a lake in Oklahoma,

B.106:  #Uh-huh.#

A.107:  #once this# last summer and I can't remember why I couldn't go, ye- oh, I
was going to South Padre that #weekend [laughter].#

B.108:  #Yeah.#

A.109:  That was why, but, um, I really, I like to camp,

B.110:  #Yeah.#

A.111:  #I just haven't# had much opportunity to do it lately.

B.112:  ((Part of)) the problem is you need a lot of equipment to do it. 

A.113:  #Uh-huh.#

B.114:  #There's a few# things that you just kind of have to have or you can't go
camping.

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  Depending on what kind of camping your doing, like a stove or sleeping bag,
and a tent and all that.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  And like for the last couple years I've been borrowing it,

A.119:  #Yeah.#

B.120:  #whenever# I wanted to go. 

A.121:  Yeah, I guess really the most times I've been camping (( )) I would have to
say it would be Colorado and New Mexico, #in that area,#

B.122:  #Yeah, well that's,# #that's# ...

A.123:  #just on# a big group trip thing and I didn't have to come up with much,

B.124:  #Yeah.#

A.125:  #equipment# because, a, for the group we got all the stuff that we needed.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  But um, and that was, boy that was a while back when I did that actually,
it's probably been,

B.128:  #Well  ... #

A.129:  #ten# years ago [laughter].  But it was quite, I just can remember sleeping
in this sleeping bag and waking up in the middle of the night, just #freezing
cold.#

B.130:  #Yeah.#

A.131:  I mean, I just, you couldn't stay warm at night no matter what.  And I was
sleeping on my down jacket with my pillow and sleeping in long johns and
#freezing.#

B.132:  #Yeah.#

A.133:  But, during the day it would get nice enough and then after that week of
being up there I can remember coming back down to our base camp area at, at
the lake --

B.134:  #Uh-huh.#

A.135:  -- #at Pagosa Springs,# and we all made a beeline for this pump because
there weren't any, there were just outhouses,

B.136:  #Yeah.#

A.137:  #and a pump,# and we all went to the pump and we were all washing our #hair,#

B.138:  #[laughter].#

A.139:  under the pump and it was so cold it must have been like thirty-three
degree #water#, 

B.140:  #Yeah,# yeah.

A.141:  that just was,

B.142:  #Yeah.#

A.143:  #all# but frozen and it gave us the worse headaches we've ever had in our
lives it was so nice just to at least get #clean,#

B.144:  #Uh-huh.#

A.145:  hair and we all jumped in the lake and everything just to,
just to rinse #off [laughter].#

B.146:  #Yeah.#

A.147:  It was quite an experience.  I've never gone for a whole week in the
wilderness with, with no, you know, no running water, nothing, so,

B.148:  #It makes, makes you appreciate,#

A.149:  #it was pretty, pretty, uh, interesting experience.#

B.150:  I guess #the conveniences of modern living.#

A.151:  #Yes, definitely,# [laughter], definitely, I mean when you 
appreciate an outhouse you know you've been ((roughing)) it [laughter],

B.152:  [laughter] Yeah.

A.153:  But anyway.  Well, five minute, well actually we've gone, 

B.154:  #Okay.#

A.155:  #more than# five minutes so, anyway,

B.156:  #Good talking to you.#

A.157:  #It was good talking to you Rick.#

B.158:  #Bye-bye.# 

A.159:  #All right.  Bye-bye.#
