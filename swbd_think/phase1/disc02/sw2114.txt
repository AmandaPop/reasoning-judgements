============================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, she said, uh, one was a total ban on gun control and ten was,
uh, no control at all.

B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  Where do you fit in there.

B.4:  Well, I think you would probably have to put me at the, at the ten area,
ten or nine.

A.5:  Oh yeah, well we're probably not too far apart.  I'd probably fall in there
at a seven or eight.

B.6:  Yeah, I, uh, I just, you know, it's, it's, you know, weap-, weapons
obviously do not kill, it's the people that operate them.

A.7:  Well I pretty much agree with that, that's uh,

B.8:  With, with two hundred years of uncontrolled gun control in this country, I
mean it was founded on that.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  It's one of the things that founded this country.  I can't imagine trying
to, to do that and if you passed laws, you're going to make a lot of
criminals, criminals because people wouldn't register them.  I, I, I live in
California, an, and, we just had a, a registration, a law registration for
automatic guns,

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  and, uh, they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this
state and less than, of, I think fifteen hundred people registered them.

A.13:  Is that right. 

B.14:  # Yeah, #

A.15:  # In # the whole state?

B.16:  Yeah, in the whole state.

A.17:  Golly, well the,

B.18:  So what is happened now is that those people that did not register them
are, uh --

A.19:  They're now criminals themselves.

B.20:  -- they're now criminals.

A.21:  Yeah, that's, that's the crazy thing about it, you're, you're putting, uh,
they're, they're putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on
the honest citizen, the one who doesn't give them a problem anyway.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  You know, and it's, it's crazy.  They're just putting more, giving more
paper work problems to the honest citizen, an, an, you know, because, uh, a
person whose going to use a gun for a crime, he's, he's not too concerned with
the crime of not registering his gun that's, 

B.24:  No, no, absolutely.  You know, it's like, uh, I, I, I don't really quite
understand the idea that people think that, I mean, I, I'm all for
registration in the sense that, uh, a, a, a lawful person can go down and get
a gun and, and maybe you shouldn't be given one the day that you go down.
They should be able to do a check, I think possibly an ...

A.25:  Yeah, I, I would agree with that.  That, yo-, well, you know, that's,
that's why I say I kind of fall into a seven or eight range.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  You know, I, I don't have a problem with registration but, uh, you know,
when it comes to restrictions and, and,

B.28:  Yeah an, and just plain can't have guns.

A.29:  Yeah, yeah it is crazy because, like you say, this country was founded, uh,
and obviously had a, uh, had a big interest in, in letting them, their
citizens arm themselves and, which, uh, you know, which maybe does cause some
problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws don't have, but
it's one of the prices that you have to pay for, for freedom, I think.

B.30:  Oh, absolutely.  Not only that but I think there's also a hidden, a hidden
wealth in, in, in the citizen having firearms.  And that hidden wealth is, is
that I would really, I would really feel sorry for anybody, for a country
that, that tried to physically invade this country.

A.31:  Yeah, yeah.

B.32:  I mean, because, you know, it's, it's a country where everybody has a gun.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And they're going to have some trouble.  I mean, you know in the mom and
pop little towns, and stuff they're going to run into people with guns.

A.35:  Oh yeah, yeah, (( )).

B.36:  An, and, that, that is sort of a hidden security factor, I think, for this
nation, you know, I mean.

A.37:  Oh yeah, everybody who lives out in the country or, 

B.38:  Sure.

A.39:  or around, around my area, everybody who lives out in the country has a
gun.

B.40:  Gu-, at least one.

A.41:  Yeah, you know it's not for, uh, not for protection or hunting or, or
anything, just, you know, for all those reasons, just, you know, nobody thinks
anything about having a gun.  It's no big deal.

B.42:  It's, it's the way they just brought up.  We-, uh, where are you from, by
the way.

A.43:  I'm in, uh, Trenton, Texas.

B.44:  Texas.

A.45:  Yeah, did you say you were in California.

B.46:  Yeah, I'm in California right now, I'm, I'm originally from North Carolina,
though, I.

@@A.47:  Well I, well I didn't know this program reached out this far.

B.48:  Hey, it's reaching all over.

A.49:  All right, well that's, that's a neat deal.

B.50:  Well, listen do you think they've earned their money, we've earned our
money tonight.

A.51:  Oh, I be we have, we gave them a few minutes worth.

B.52:  All right, well listen, you take care of yourself.

A.53:  All right, you too.  Good night, there.

B.54:  All right, good night.

A.55:  Bye, bye.

B.56:  ((All right.))
