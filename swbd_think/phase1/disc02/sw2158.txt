A.16:  Um, I took a voice I O course.

B.17:  Oh, okay.  I just saw there was an advertisement within T I to sign up for

B.29:  Oh my goodness.  How do you like North Carolina?

A.30:  Well, I used to live up in New York and Maryland --

B.31:  Uh-huh. 

A.32:  -- and I, uh, I like, I like bigger cities.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  I like, I like more populated areas, because I used to live in Buenos
Aires, but they have ten million people.

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  But, uh, this area is nice.  It looks like it's got a lot of, uh, job
opportunities --

B.37:  Yeah.

A.38:  -- especially at Research Triangle Park.

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  And so, it looks, it looks, well, it's the third largest
growing area in the country for businesses.

B.41:  Yeah.  I like the pine trees.

A.42:  Yeah, yeah.

B.43:  Yeah, I've, I've been over there from time to time.  Uh, you're, you're at
the University of North Carolina?

A.44:  No, 

B.45:  Oh.

A.46:  North Carolina State.

B.47:  Oh, North-, okay, N C State.  

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  The wildcats.

A.50:  No, 

B.51:  No.

A.52:  the wolf pack.

B.53:  Wolf pack, okay.

A.54:  Yeah, no we're, we're not, we're not the Tar Heels. 

B.55:  Yeah, I knew you weren't the Tar Heels.  

A.56:  [Laughter].

B.57:  Uh, no, somebody gave me a pair of running shorts and with the logo on it,
and I thought it was a wildcat, but it was a wolf.  Yeah, for the N C State,
uh, wolf pack.

A.58:  Why, do you run?

B.59:  Yeah, I'm a runner.

A.60:  Oh, okay, my dad is too.

B.61:  In fact I went up there visiting.  I had a friend at Davidson one time.
And I went up there visiting him and, and he took me out running through the
trails in the piney woods up there, and I just loved it.

A.62:  Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

B.63:  [Cough] Well, what are we supposed to, I, I was kind of fumbling.  This was
the first, I haven't been home other nights when they've called.

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  So this is the first time I've participated.  And, uh, uh, and I, I was
fumbling for my, uh, pin number, uh, when she was talking about what to talk
about.  And what are we supposed to discuss?

A.66:  It's, it's clothing.

B.67:  Yeah, uh, how you dress, to go to work or something like that.

A.68:  Right, how you, how you dress to go to work, and how it changes from season
to season.

B.69:  Oh [cough].

A.70:  And from day to day.

B.71:  Okay.

A.72:  Okay.

B.73:  Well, I'm ready any time you are, Sir.

A.74:  Okay ready, I'm going to press the one.

B.75:  Hey, uh, how does this work, Fernando?  Do we talk for five minutes and
does somebody cut us off, or,

A.76:  No, then, then we say bye, and, uh, (( )),

B.77:  How do we know, how do we know when the time's up?

A.78:  Well I, I've got a stopwatch here.

B.79:  Oh, okay.

A.80:  So I'll probably say, you know, it's like, well, we've been talking for
five, six minutes so.

B.81:  Okay.

A.82:  Okay.

B.83:  You want to go first, or me.

A.84:  Well, uh, we'll just open it, okay?

B.85:  Okay.

A.86:  I'll press the one, ready?

B.87:  Ready, one.  

A.88:  Okay.  [Beep] Okay, so well, you see, since I don't work --

@B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  -- I just go, you know, to class, it all depends, because I like to wear
like sweat pants, because it's more comfortable for me.  But, you know, it's
like, when you're in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans.

B.91:  Yeah, uh, you know, I, I, I can remember back to my college days, and, uh,
it was, uh, T-shirts and jeans in the warm weather, and jackets and jeans in
the short weather.

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  Uh, the thing is, here, I'm, I'm supposed to be an executive.  You, you
can, uh, uh, take that or, or not, depends on where you're looking from.  And
however, and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties.
Well, many do, but I am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie.

A.94:  Yeah.

B.95:  I carry one in my briefcase, and I wear it, I wear it when the occasion
demands.  If somebody important is coming to visit, well I take it out and put
it on.  Uh, I wear a sport jacket sometimes, and I wear, uh, well reasonably
not, not real dressy, dressy pants, but, but reasonably decent, reasonably
decent pants.

A.96:  Yeah.

B.97:  And, uh, c-, comfortable that way, and a good loose fitting pair of shoes
that I take off under tables when I'm in a conference room,

A.98:  [Laughter].

B.99:  because I can't stand having anything on my feet.  And, uh, say I like
my shirt, and short, I wear short sleeved shirts all year round.  I just,

A.100:  Okay, are they like T-shirts or are they, 

B.101:  Ye-, 

A.102:  like, do they have (( )),

B.103:  No, short sleeved sort of semidress shirt.  

A.104:  Oh, okay.

B.105:  But I, I, I absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows, and, when
I'm working,

A.106:  Well,

B.107:  and, and, I mean, that's even in the winter time.

A.108:  Well, because how, how hot, I mean, like, like in the coldest that it gets
in winter down there, how much is it?

B.109:  Well, we'll have a day or two that it'll be down near zero, as it has been
the last two years just before Christmas.  But at, uh, uh, normally, it'll be
in the thirties and forties on the coldest days.  And we've experienced some
seventies here, uh, to eighties recently.

A.110:  Yeah, yeah that's (( )).

B.111:  But I, I don't ever feel the need to dress that warmly.  I, I don't have to
travel that far to work.  Uh, what, what, what, what about, uh, your clothes
in the winter time up there?

A.112:  Well, it's basically, you know, it's like, I got, like a leather jacket, or
a, you know, so I just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket, and I usually
stay in class that way.  And if not, I would wear a sweatshirt underneath it,
and, then, you know, you'd, but what happens is, uh, what I've seen here on
campus it's very strange, because a lot of black people,

B.113:  Uh-huh.

A.114:  here.  They wear like dress pants and dress shirts, to go everywhere.

B.115:  My goodness -- 

A.116:  Okay.

B.117:  -- I, I've not see that at all.

A.118:  And they wear either that or they wear dress pants and black turtlenecks or
white turtlenecks.

B.119:  Yeah.

A.120:  And so the thing is, you know, is like I asked a guy, you know, why, why do
you wear that.  He goes, well, it costs me the same amount, which is true
because some dress pants, you know, cost me twenty-five dollars, which is the
same as jeans.

B.121:  Yeah.

A.122:  But, um, but, basically all over here, everywhere, everybody [tapping]
wears jeans, and if not, what the, what the thing is, that they're wearing
now, is sometimes you wear, like shorts with biker pants underneath it, which
is,

B.123:  Okay, w-, that, that sounds pretty good.  Uh, it sounds like it's a very
relaxed atmosphere on campus.  You know, I've, uh, I've, uh, always, T I is a
very informal company.  Uh, I, I think the thing that I've noticed in more
recent years there's more ties and jackets and shirts as the young-, the
younger crowd seems to want to dress.  Those of us, I've been here thirty-two
years, those of us been here for a long time don't care to dress up.  But,
when we came to work, I was told that the president of the company set the
standard of dress, and he's, he dressed like the janitor,

A.124:  [Laughter].

B.125:  so we all, we all did.  And the feeling has always been that without the
shirts and ties and suit coats, that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere,

A.126:  Yeah.

B.127:  and you could have a freer exchange of information, and I've seen this,
[cough] actually I spent seven years overseas with T I.

A.128:  Where at?

B.129:  And while I was gone,

A.130:  Where at?

B.131:  Uh, Malaysia.  Four years in Malaysia and three years in the Philippines.

A.132:  Oh, okay.

B.133:  And, and while I was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets
came about.  Because when I came back I saw ties and jackets in T I for the
first time.

A.134:  Yeah.

B.135:  What was interesting, Malaysia is a tropical country, just, uh, two degrees
above the equator.

A.136:  Yeah.

B.137:  And when I went over there I packed a lot of clothes, and I packed two
sport jackets and two ties.  And the ties got lost and never got there, and I
was there three years, or four years, rather, and never missed them.

A.138:  [Laughter].

B.139:  (( )) I absolutely never wore anything out in the tropics like a necktie.

A.140:  But the thing is, when you started with T I, was it as big a company as it
is now?

B.141:  Oh, no, no, uh, I think it was somethi-, I started in nineteen fifty-nine.
We're talking about at the most, eight to nine thousand people world wide.
And at that time, the whole world was right here in Dallas --

A.142:  Yeah.

B.143:  -- as far as T I was concerned.

A.144:  Yeah, which is, which is bas-, I mean when,

B.145:  [Clicking].

A.146:  Hello. 

B.147:  Is that, uh, I'm sorry that's,

A.148:  You probably got wait calling.

B.149:  Yeah, I got a wait call.  Hang on a second.  [Click].

A.150:  Okay.  Well I guess I'm supposed to talk alone while he's on the wait call,
about clothing, right.  So, I don't know what to say.  I don't wear any
[laughter] clothing, we're at nudist camp, we don't wear any clothes here.

B.151:  You still there Fernando?

A.152:  Yeah.

B.153:  Sorry.

A.154:  Oh, that's okay.

B.155:  Uh, and anyway, uh, where, uh, oh, we're talking about the size of the
company, yeah.  It was, uh, about eight or nine thousand people when I got
here.  It has, in the past, gotten up to eighty-six thousand.  We're not,
we're that high right now.

A.156:  Yeah.

B.157:  But, uh, in, in many, many, many, many countries (( )).

A.158:  Was that in the seventies?

B.159:  No, I started in nineteen fifty-nine.

A.160:  No, no, but, uh, when i-, it had gone up.

B.161:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it peaked out in the seventies.

A.162:  Yeah, yeah, I re-,

B.163:  Yes, yes, I've, I've, I've got thirty-two years in.

A.164:  I, I, qu-, I sort of remember that.  I'm only twenty-two --

B.165:  Okay.

A.166:  -- but in the seventies I heard, you know, T I was even making, uh, those,
little watches --

B.167:  Right.

A.168:  -- you know, those, those, uh -- 

B.169:  Right.

A.170:  -- L E D watches --

B.171:  Right, we made those.  

A.172:  -- that you couldn't see in the sun.

B.173:  Yeah, yeah.  I used to referee soccer games, and, uh, uh, I would use those
watches to time the games and I'd be out on the field, middle of the field at
high noon --

A.174:  Yeah.

B.175:  -- and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see
what time it was.

A.176:  [Laughter]  So.

B.177:  And, uh, yeah, we were about the first ones to make those, and went out of
that business in nineteen eighty-one.

A.178:  Yeah.

B.179:  Uh, back to, uh, uh, back to clothes.  I don't really, I don't really have
what you'd, you'd think was an expensive wardrobe.  I mean, some people are
very, very, very clothes conscious, uh,

A.180:  Well, they said that women, like the, the, you know, executive women or
women that work, whatever,

B.181:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.182:  they spend, uh, five hundred dollars on clothes a year.  So, but, but,
for me,

B.183:  Yeah, I wouldn't, I would think they'd spend at least that, as th-, at the
cost of clothes, yeah.

A.184:  Yeah, I mean, women go all, I mean, what I've seen, like, you know, they
like to wear something different every day.  And for me, it's like, people
know how I dress, and w-, we have, you know, like the gym here.

B.185:  Right.

A.186:  They give you shirts, right which --

B.187:  Yeah.

A.188:  -- which you use, and then you take back they give you a clean one.

B.189:  [Laughter].

A.190:  And so sometimes you wear, you know, the shirts from, from the gym every
day of the week.

B.191:  Yeah.

A.192:  The only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year
that they were bought in --

B.193:  Uh-huh.

A.194:  -- so, I mean, you don't feel as bad, because, it's like, they, they give
you different year sometimes, you know, so you're wearing, you know, sometimes
you're wearing eighty-nine, the other times, sometimes you're wearing
ninety-one, the other times you're wearing, you know, eighty-six.  So, it's
okay, you know.

B.195:  Is that for like gym classes for P E classes and things like that?

A.196:  Right, see when we take P E you have to dress in,

B.197:  Yeah.

A.198:  the, in P E clothes,

B.199:  Yeah.

A.200:  but it is, it's issued to any one that wants one that's in the
university.

@@B.201:  Right, right, right.  How many hours are you taking.

A.202:  Well, right now since I'm graduating, I'm o-, ...
