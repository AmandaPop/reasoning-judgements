A.1:  Okay.

@B.2:  Yeah, how many children do you have?

A.3:  I have four.

B.4:  And I have three.  What do you have, boys, girls?

A.5:  I have, uh, three boys and one girl,

B.6:  I have,

A.7:  the girl's adopted.   

B.8:  Uh-huh, I have two girls and one boy.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Do you have grandchildren yet?

A.11:  Uh, yeah, I got two grandchildren.

B.12:  Oh, I got ahead of you there.  I got three and one on the way [laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  No, but, uh, I know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of
time together,

A.15:  Yeah, uh,

B.16:  uh, school activities and my, my boy was in hockey. 

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  And, of course, the girls and, and, uh, myself we rooted, you know, we
didn't participate but we did a lot of family things together.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  We had animals for the children.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  You know, our horses and that kind of thing and, uh, school activities type
stuff.

A.23:  Yeah, my kids were involved in sports.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Football and baseball and,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  whatever.  But, uh,

B.28:  Did you find the time to attend.

A.29:  Oh, yeah.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, we did too.

A.31:  When they were growing up we di-, we were out in the middle of a desert,
#out in Ridgecrest, California.#

B.32:  #I think that's kind of the key,# don't you?

A.33:  Huh?

B.34:  I think that's kind of the key,

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  is to not be in the big city.   

A.37:  Yeah, there wasn't a lot of other things for them to do.

B.38:  Right.  And,

A.39:  And, uh, so, when, when they participated in sports or whatever, well, uh,
all, nearly all the parents went.

B.40:  Yep.  We did that too and the children where, um, when, in fact, when my
youngest was about two, we decided to get out of the city and go to the
country.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  I mean it's not as vast a country as like, you know, where you people are
from,
 
A.43:  {Very faint}, yeah.

B.44:  because I lived in Abilene for a little while,  

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  and, uh, I know what nothing is when I moved out there. 

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  You know, it, the city itself is great but, I mean, you go in the, in the,
uh, car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles.

A.49:  We came back when they were teenagers,

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  and, of course, uh, then they came to the big city as teenagers and
((that)) the time with them wasn't as much as it was when they were out there
in the small,

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  town, out in the middle,  

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  of the desert.   

B.56:  But they, at least they had the background.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  And the, the home, uh, the family type unit, you know, and I think when
kids have that they don't get into as much trouble or seek to,

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  you know, do other things that are really not good for them, you know.

A.61:  Yeah.  Gosh our, our kids were fortunate, they had good, good other kids to
play with.

B.62:  Yep.  Same here.

A.63:  Uh, maybe it's not like it is nowadays really,

B.64:  No.

A.65:  when there's so much, uh, #((some)) drugs and everything else.#

B.66:  #No.  I know, I'm so happy that I had mine,# had mine when I did, and that
I'm not having them now.

A.67:  Yeah, #I would not want to,#

B.68:  #I think about it,#

A.69:  raise a, a child today,

B.70:  No.

A.71:  from scra-,  

B.72:  No.

A.73:  you know, from start.   

B.74:  And plus I think that the, uh, mo-, the husbands and wives both having to
work,

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  it's not a matter of choice anymore, I think most people,

A.77:  No, it's a necessity.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  It's a,

B.80:  And, uh, it, that takes so much time away from your kids.

A.81:  Yeah, yeah, I wh-,

B.82:  Of course at the,

A.83:  uh,

B.84:  at the time, I worked third shift to be with my kids during the day,

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  you know, and then, uh, my, uh, husband was with them at night,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  so, they were always with a family member, you know.   

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  And baby-sitters and, uh, day care and all that stuff, kids don't really
bond anymore.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  The mother's aren't there.

A.93:  Well, I, I, I told my wife that, uh, I don't know what young kids just
starting out nowadays, especially if they have, uh, have some children if, if
they're trying to buy a house both of them have to work,

B.94:  Oh, yeah.   

A.95:  in order to pay for a house. 

B.96:  Yep.   

A.97:  Uh, and the kids really spend more time at school or with a baby-sitter
then they do with their parents.

B.98:  Exactly. 

A.99:  {Very faint} And, uh,

B.100:  But you know, uh, I wonder, by the time they get through paying out for all
the day care center and everything else, is it really worth all that.

A.101:  Yep.   

B.102:  Rather than to wait until the children are like in school, 

A.103:  Yeah.   

B.104:  and then go for that type of goal.  I think that too many people want
everything now.

A.105:  Yeah.   Yeah, I told,

B.106:  Like, we had to save and plan and,  

A.107:  Uh-huh.   

B.108:  do without and that kind of stuff, where it's now the credit cards and,

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  I mean, they just go and buy it, you know [laughter].  

A.111:  Yeah, well, kids nowadays they want to start out with a,  

B.112:  Exact-, 

A.113:  three bedroom brick house,

B.114:  Yep.   

A.115:  and when we started out, well, we started out in, first of all in ((a
little)) apartment,

B.116:  Exactly.   

A.117:  and then rented a, a duplex. 

B.118:  Sure.

A.119:  And then went from a duplex, to a little old two bedroom frame house.

B.120:  That's my point,  

A.121:  But, uh,

B.122:  and, and, I think that they should like learn how to crawl before they
walk.

A.123:  Uh-huh.    

B.124:  It's, it's too much, it, and it's too accessible,  

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  and they get into it and they're over their heads.  I think that's why
there's so many divorces too.

A.127:  Yeah.    

B.128:  Because the money becomes, uh, an issue, the children become an issue, the
jobs become an issue and it's like, you know, what's left.

A.129:  Yeah.   

B.130:  Just to argue and that type of thing, you know.  

A.131:  Uh-huh, I'm, I'm, I really feel for young parents now (( )).

B.132:  I do, I do.   

A.133:  I, I just don't, uh, see how,

B.134:  ((They're like)) between a rock and a hard spot.   

A.135:  Yeah.   

B.136:  It really is awful.  I think maybe the company should do more with day care
centers and that type of thing, it might bring families closer.

A.137:  Yeah.   

B.138:  Or mothers to children, you know, because they're able to spend some time.

A.139:  Yeah, they,  

B.140:  At,

A.141:  brought that up at T I, I don't know how many times to, to, uh, have a
day care,

B.142:  Yeah.   

A.143:  for working mothers, but, uh, T I never has seen fit to do it.
  
B.144:  No, huh-,  

A.145:  But there are a few companies here in Dallas that do.   

B.146:  Yeah.  I think that's great, 

A.147:  {Very faint} yeah. 

B.148:  because, I mean, you know, you, you, it's less guilt you feel knowing
that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or
fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or,

A.149:  Yeah.   

B.150:  just know they're close by.   

A.151:  Yeah.   

B.152:  You know, it's, it's very hard.  Well, it was nice chatting with you.

A.153:  Well, do you work at a Attleboro or does your, 

B.154:  Yes, I do.  I do. 

A.155:  or your husband?   

B.156:  No, I do.   

A.157:  Oh, you do?   

B.158:  Yeah.   

A.159:  Okay.   

B.160:  I work in, uh, building twelve in Attleboro.   

A.161:  Oh, well, of course, I always see, see, uh, Attleboro mission on teen news
and everything else but,

B.162:  Uh,

A.163:  never been up there.   

B.164:  Oh, you should come, it's, it's a, it's a nice place.  In the,

A.165:  Yeah.   

B.166:  summertime though, don't come in the winter [laughter].   

A.167:  Yeah, I started to say, what, what's the temperature up there now?

B.168:  Right now we're in the thirties.   

A.169:  In the thirties?   

B.170:  And we're expecting a snowstorm tomorrow into Friday,  

A.171:  Oh, bo-,  

B.172:  possibly Saturday.   

A.173:  oh, me.   

B.174:  So, it's supposed to be real bad driving tomorrow afternoon.

A.175:  ((Oh)).  Well, we're supposed to get rain but no, [laughter], snow.

B.176:  [Laughter].   

A.177:  But we're, we're in the sixties and seventies, 

B.178:  Oh, that's terrible.   

A.179:  in the daytime.  

B.180:  [Laughter] I'm jealous.   

A.181:  [Laughter] We-, 

B.182:  No, I, it, it's, well, this is the month where it's very unsettled because
March is like between winter and spring out here, it's like one minute you've
got winter weather, the next minute you have spring like weather, everybody's
got a cold,

A.183:  Yeah.  

B.184:  you don't know how to dress, you know.  

A.185:  Yeah.   

B.186:  So, it's kind of tough,  

A.187:  {Very faint} Yeah.   

B.188:  and they say that the driving tomorrow is supposed to be really bad in
the afternoon.

A.189:  {Very faint} Yeah.  Well, the colds and the flu have been going around
down here.

B.190:  Have they?

A.191:  Oh, man, I'm telling you, everybody's, and I think it's really the weather
it will, it will get warm one day and then not real cold but,

B.192:  Yeah.   

A.193:  pretty cool the next day and then warm the next day. 

B.194:  Yeah.   

A.195:  And it's just, uh, plus there's been an awfully lot of, uh, uh, mountain
cedar and everything else in the air.

B.196:  Oh, wow.   

A.197:  And it's really driving people with sinuses crazy, and, 

B.198:  Sure, {very faint}, sure.   

A.199:  and sore throats and colds and whatever.   

B.200:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I, I can tell by your accent that you're a Texan, and, you
know, I miss hearing that, [laughter].

A.201:  [Laughter].   

B.202:  They used to make fun of me because of being, you know, my accent.

A.203:  Yeah.   

B.204:  They, they try to get me to say things because they, they thought I talked
so funny.

A.205:  [Laughter].   

B.206:  But you sound just like, um, the, the children that I worked with up there,

A.207:  Yeah.   

B.208:  the same type of voice.   

A.209:  Yeah.  I mem-, I remember when I was out at Ridgecrest, somebody had a
flat, and, uh, I asked them, I said, do you have a tire tool in the, in the
trunk?

B.210:  [Laughter].   

A.211:  And he said, a what?  And I said, a tire tool.   

B.212:  [Laughter].   

A.213:  [Laughter] He said, you mean a t a r {spells out word} tool and I said,
no, a t i r e {spells out word} tool [laughter].

@@B.214:  Yeah, right.  [laughter].  Like oil, [laughter] or oil [laughter].

A.215:  Yeah [laughter].   

B.216:  That's true [laughter]. 

A.217:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

B.218:  Well, listen it was nice speaking with you.   

A.219:  Nice talking to you, Irene, and you stay warm up there. 

B.220:  Okay, Jim.
