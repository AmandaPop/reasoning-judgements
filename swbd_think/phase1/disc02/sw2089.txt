============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so are you a fisherman?

B.2:  A little bit, I have not, have not done a lot of fishing in the last uh,
couple of years anyway but, uh, I like to fish so I, I've, I take fishing
magazines and read, and watch fishing television shows [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah, well, I'm just about in the same situation,

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  here a few years ago I got, really got into it hot and heavy, and um,
about like you say, I guess, the last couple of years I've, you know, kind of
gotten out of the it.  I've got kids now that are old enough to play summer
baseball and uh, ball league, basketball and that kind of stuff and uh, man, I
just don't have the time to go like I want to.

B.6:  Yeah, well, mine are, kids, are both grown so that's, uh,

A.7:  Oh, really.

B.8:  that's, that's past the point now where I can use them as an excuse, but,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  working and doing things around the house, you know, keeps you pretty busy
anyway,

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  so, 

A.13:  I tell you it really is hard to, to get time to go fishing,

B.14:  Yeah. 

A.15:  unless you just really, really work at it almost,

B.16:  Yeah, what, uh,

A.17:  like a second job.

B.18:  Yeah, when you do fish.  Do you fish for bass or just,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  I'm, I like to go after them big old black bass.

B.22:  Go after the big ones, yeah.  Where have you fished recently? 

A.23:  Oh, I got a few little old ponds up around here.  You know, there's several
around here.  I do a lot of, oh, just small farm fishing, I mean small farm
tank fishing and,

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  rock pit fishing, but I've been to, uh, oh, the last, I guess the last
big lake I went to was Lake Fork.

B.26:  Yeah.  I have not made it to Lake Fork yet, although I've talked about it
and, um, I've got, uh, I'm a C P A, and I've got clients
that, uh, or a client that lives on Lake Tawakoni,

A.27:  Um, um.

B.28:  that has told me, you know, anytime, you know, just come on over.

A.29:  Yeah. 

B.30:  Got a client that lives at Lake, at Cedar Creek Lake and I'm from East
Texas,

A.31:  Oh, are you? 

B.32:  so I've got, uh, uh, I think my brother-in-law may have a place at Lake
Palestine, so,

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  You know, I can go fishing just about anywhere I want to go but,

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  it's a matter of finding the time, you know.

A.37:  Yeah, that is a problem. 

B.38:  But, uh, most of my fishing has been, uh, just, you know, whatever will
bite I'll fish for, and my brother-in-law likes to fish for crappie,

A.39:   Yeah. 

B.40:  and so I fish a bit with him, you know, fishing for those.  And then, uh,
you know, I fish for bass. Fish, but basically like I said, fish for what,
whatever I can catch.

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  I don't know enough about fishing to, you know, to say, uh, I'm going to go
after a particular kind.

A.43:  Yeah.  Well, I don't either really.  I, I like messing with the lures and,

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  and that seems to be what the bass like and what you can catch with the
lures, so that's generally,

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  what I fish for.  You know, because I don't particularly like to eat
fish.  I just like to catch them and throw them back.

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  But, it's, uh, you know, I, I got into that mode where I was buying lures
and, and rods and reels, and just all kinds of stuff.  I had one of those
little two man, little two man boats that,

B.50:  Um, um. 

A.51:  used to go around a lot, use that a lot, but like I say, I kind of got
out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so, I,

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  sold that and, but it's, uh, 

B.54:  So are you,

A.55:  so I'm kind of limited now to going back to, uh, the old farm pond.

B.56:  so are you anticipating buying another boat or just,

A.57:  Well, as a matter of fact, uh, last, last fall, uh, in October I guess, I
bought, uh, I bought a boat, but I bought a ski boat.

B.58:  [Laughter] Well, you can fish, you can bass fish from a ski boat.

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.  You can.  It's, it's not the same as a bass boat, but, yeah,
you can get out on the water, that's the main thing.

B.60:  Yeah.  That's,

A.61:  But, I, I used to go with a friend at work quite a bit.  He had, uh, he had
a, uh, bass boat and he's the one I went to, uh, oh, like I say, we went to
Lake Fork and Cypress Springs and we've been to Lavon and Texoma, just,

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  been around quite a bit.  In the, kind of local area, but,

B.64:  Right. 

A.65:  he sold his boat, too, so [laughter] we just kind of, kind of grounded
ourselves in that respect.

B.66:  Yeah.  Well, the last time I had anticipated fishing, I thought I might
fish at Lake Texoma.  I was going up there with a group --

A.67:  Huh-uh.

B.68:  -- and, uh, when I got there, discovered you have to have a special license
to fish on the lake,

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  right? 

A.71:  That's, well, you don't have to, but it, it makes it easier.  You got to
have, uh, well, if you have a Texoma license you can fish anywhere on the
lake,

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  if you have only a Texas license, you have to stay on the Texas side of
the lake which, uh, uh, as it turns out, most of the lake is in Oklahoma.

B.74:  Yeah, well, that's what I understood anyway.  I, I discovered it was much
better to have, uh, uh, Texoma license.

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  And I didn't have that, so I said, well, I wasn't going to, that plus,
there wasn't anybody else fishing, you know, in the group, so I said, well, I
just won't worry about it.

A.77:  Yeah. 

B.78:  And, that was probably the last time I even tried to fish or even thought
about it but,

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  I've got my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car, so if the urge ever
[laughter],

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  ever bites, you know, I'm ((kind of)) available but [laughter],

A.83:  Go across the bridge, across the water, if it looks good, you can just
pullover and start it then.

B.84:  Yeah, right. 

A.85:  Yeah.  Now I've got most of mine hung up in the garage now.  Like I say,
it's been a while since I've, since I've even gotten to go, you know.  Pretty
days, you know, like today, like this weekend, of course, it's too windy now,
but,

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  you know, it usually dies down around sundown.  I've got a little old
pond, just, oh, just a few hundred yards from my back door, that I go over
there occasionally but,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  you know, it's pretty small and got pretty small fish in it.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  But, it's nice to get out and just start splashing on the water or
something.

B.92:  Yeah. But, uh, Do you uh, read anything about fishing?  
Do you have any, any books, magazines or anything that you take, that you,

A.93:  No, I don't take any magazines, but I like to watch old Berry Stokes.

B.94:  Yeah, well, I enjoy him too.  Yeah.

A.95:  Yeah, he's about my favorite. 

B.96:  Yeah.  I watch, I, I take, uh, have just started taking the, that bass,
joined the Bass Anglers Club.

A.97:  Yes (( )). 

B.98:  You know, and get their magazine. 

A.99:  Huh-uh. 

B.100:  And, uh, then I take the Texas Fisherman. 

A.101:  Oh, really. 

B.102:  Yeah, and, uh, you know, I find those to be pretty good.  They, uh, the
Texas Fisherman, they uh, they cover a pretty broad range of fishing, but they
cover a lot, spend a lot of time on salt water, you know,

A.103:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.104:  along the coast.

A.105:  I have taken some fishing magazines in the past.  And, that's, that's
generally what I found,

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  seemed like they spend a lot of time discussing the type fishing that I
wasn't really interested in.

B.108:  And, then, of course, I guess, the Bass, you know, the Bass Anglers book
covers the, pretty well covers the country.

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  So you don't get a lot of Texas, you know, in particular,

A.111:  Yeah. 

B.112:  coverage in that.  But,

A.113:  Yeah, it's really more, kind of all over the south,

B.114:  still, you get some pretty good tips.

A.115:  isn't it? 

B.116:  I believe so.  It's, their headquarters are in Alabama so,

A.117: Yeah.  What, uh, what do you get when you join the, uh, B A S S,
what kind of benefits to you get?

B.118:  Well, uh, there's a number of things that you can get, but basically, you
get the, the magazine and you get that patch, you know,

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  you know, you get a patch and you get the bumper sticker.

A.121:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.122:  But, then they, they're always, I just joined, just signed up for the
magazine here a month or so ago, but they, you know, they send you offers and
things, uh, lure packages,

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  and things like that, 

A.125:  Tackle and stuff. 

B.126:  that you can, if you, matter of fact, if you, uh, get other people to
sign up, you know, to, to sign up for the thing, you know,

A.127:  Huh-uh.

B.128:  then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but --

A.129:  Yeah.    

B.130:  -- but they've got, uh, I think they might even have a Visa card or
something that they promote, you know, through the club and,

A.131:  Yeah.

B.132:  they've got, uh, discounts on travel, rental cars and things like that,
that,

A.133:  Yeah.  I know the, uh, Bass Pro Shops, uh, I get their catalogs,

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  but, that's almost like a Christmas in the summertime when that comes
but,

B.136:  right. 

A.137:  yeah, I've noticed they, they're now pushing a MasterCard that, you know,
they're supposed to spend so much of the money on conservation measures and
stuff,

B.138:  Yeah. 

A.139:  which is a good idea. 

B.140:  Yeah, it's a good idea.  I think, I think we need, we need to do a lot more
on the conservation than,

A.141:  Yeah, especially as popular as fishing is getting, you know, in the last
few years, last five or ten years, I guess, it's, it's really picked up in
popularity again,

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  so it's a lot more, you know, a lot more people using the lakes and, uh,
facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of
the lakes.

B.144:  Yeah.  So you haven't fished, uh, Joe Pool Lake, down here yet, I guess,

A.145:  No, I haven't.

B.146:  or, uh, what's the other one?   Ray Roberts.  Is that, 

A.147:  Yeah, now Ray Roberts, I haven't been over there but, I,

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  I understand there's quite a few people who have been.

B.150:  Yeah. 

A.151:  I think that's really going to be a good bass lake. 

B.152:  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, Joe Pool, is so close, uh, you know, close into
Dallas.  It's a little bit of a drive from Richardson to get down there, but
I've got a, uh, couple of clients that are down in that area --

A.153:  Huh-uh.  

B.154:  -- I just, I just thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to
just, like I said, just pull over and fish a while,

A.155:  Yeah. 

B.156:  if I can find a place to get to the water somehow.

A.157:  Yeah, I understand it's kind of, kind of restricted or, or doesn't have
easy access really.

B.158:  Yeah.  So, I guess the, the main thing is, you know, when you're, like you
say, when you're carrying your tackle around in the trunk of your car and you
don't have a boat laying in the trunk of your car, you're kind of restricted
to bank fishing so,

A.159:  Yeah.

B.160:  so, you have to find a spot.

A.161:  Yeah, which is all right, you know, but that, that's,

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  all you can do,

B.164:  Yeah. 

A.165:  that's all you can do.  But, it's good to get out there and, like I say,
throw the lure out and just, just piddle with it a little while.

B.166:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I enjoy watching, just watching the lure work in the water,
sometimes.

A.167:  Yeah. 

B.168:  Just see what it does [laughter]. 

A.169:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Some of them, it takes a little while,

B.170:  Yeah. 

A.171:  to get them to do, what you think they ought to be doing.

B.172:  One thing, uh, in fishing that I have not ever, have not done and I'm not
really sure what they mean, I guess, is when they're talking about using a jig
and pig,

A.173:  Huh-uh. 

B.174:  I think is the term,

A.175:  It is. 

B.176:  Does that mean that they, like they use, uh, just, uh, it's like a hook
with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of uh, of rubber pork type
stuff on the hook itself?

A.177:  Yeah, yeah.  It's just, just that, that pork skin.  Uh, which, you know,
you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork,

B.178:  Huh-uh. 

A.179:  but, yeah, that's what it is.  

B.180:  Huh-uh.  But, it's just hung on the hook? 

A.181:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.182:  I guess, I couldn't imagine that it, anything like that until I started
reading about it and, you know, and I thought [laughter],

A.183:  [Laughter]. 

B.184:  you know, that sounds like okay, but I never would have thought of doing
it.

A.185:  That's, that's what is amazing, you know, all these different rigs that
people come up with, you know, the Carolina worm rig, and the, like I said,
the jig and pig, but I, I like top water fishing myself, you know,

B.186:  Huh-uh. 

A.187:  everybody said ...
