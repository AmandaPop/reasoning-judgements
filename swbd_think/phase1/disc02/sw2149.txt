===========================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] {TV or radio} So what do you think?  Should they, uh, should young
Americans be forced to do a year of service?

B.2:  I don't, I don't think they should be forced, but I think they should be, I
guess, encouraged to, to do some kind of public work, I guess to, just to get
them, I guess involved with community maybe, you know, just community
activity.  If nothing else, see how the city works, stuff like that.

A.3:  Yeah, I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh.

B.4:  Yeah,

A.5:  [Laughter] No kids,

B.6:  I [laughter] kind of, I think so, too.  I think that's a bit dramatic,
but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved
in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and,
uh, [breathing] [lipsmack], that kind of, thing,

A.7:  Vol-,

B.8:  helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.

A.9:  Yeah.  I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a
year or two.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  I, I, I'd force them.  I think that, uh, I think it would be, I think mo-,
I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.

B.12:  Your right, I do, too, I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl
Scouts and Boy Scouts [Noise] {like a video game} --

A.13:  Right, exactly.

B.14:  -- doing s-, 

A.15:  I was a, I was a Boy Scout.  As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do,
you know, projects all throughout and then to become --

B.16:  Ex-, 

A.17:  -- an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project. 

B.18:  Right, that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you
involved real good and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track and
then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Something,

A.21:  I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.  

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  That there's no problem with getting them to,

B.24:  [Throat_clearing].

A.25:  do stuff.  

B.26:  I do, too.  I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer
than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in
hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that.  [Sniffing] And even
if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're
getting out and doing it and [throat_clearing] you know, helping, helping out.
I think that's good and,

A.27:  Well, we have a funny commercial around here.  It says something like, if
people were to give five,

B.28:  [Sniffing]. 

A.29:  hours a week or five percent of their salary,

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something.

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  So,

B.34:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.35:  #I guess# if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary
we could, uh,

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force
kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.

B.38:  Yeah [laughter].  There you go.

A.39:  Substitute.  My, my,

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  yeah, my kid will do four or five hours this week for me.  #No
problem.#  

B.42:  #Yeah, it# sounds pretty good [laughter].  That sounds good.  I've noticed
a lot of, uh, [throat_clearing], different organizations in our community, uh,
pick up, like on the highway and stuff, and I think that's pretty neat.  They,
uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and they clean it up.

A.45:  I've seen that.  #Yeah.#

B.46:  #And keep it# clean.  I think that's I pretty good idea.  And I think, you
know, again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them
prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older.  I know I did, you
know, in Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school I would
volunteer at a nursing home and stuff [sniffing] like that [throat_clearing].

A.47:  They, they,

B.48:  So,

A.49:  just started trying to get them, something together l-, l-, like, like
that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice
storm --

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  -- uh, very, very recently.  You don't sound like you're in the north.  You
sound like you're in the south somewhere.

B.52:  Yeah, I'm in Texas.  Where are you at?

A.53:  Yeah, uh, I'm in, uh, New York.

B.54:  New York.

A.55:  Upstate New York, yeah.

B.56:  Oh, gosh.

A.57:  And, uh,

B.58:  [Sniffing].

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  [Sniffing] Yeah.

A.61:  Long way, uh,

B.62:  Yeah [Laughter].

A.63:  And we just had a really big ice storm.  And, basically, half the trees in,
in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- right upstate.  Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore.

B.66:  #Oh, no.#

A.67:  #[Lipsmack] That's how bad it was.#  Everything is just down everywhere.

B.68:  Oh.

A.69:  You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power.

B.70:  #Golly.#

A.71:  #You know, it was,# and, you know, and, and they, and we didn't have power
for a week and there are still people who don't have #power.#

B.72:  #Are# you serious? [Breath].

A.73:  Oh, yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been ten days already and there are
still something like ten thousand people without power.

B.74:  Oh my God, #how do they live?#

A.75:  #and were officially,# yeah, and we're officially in a state of
emergency.  Funny thing is the news, the national news how they covered it.
Uh, [lipsmack]

B.76:  Yeah.  I haven't heard a thing.

A.77:  Yeah.  I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news
stations or something and,

B.78:  [Breathing].

A.79:  and we've been in a state of emergency for over, you know, for ten or
eleven days.

B.80:  Lord.

A.81:  You know.  We just got our phone back today, uh,

B.82:  Go-, [laughter].

A.83:  and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come
volunteer,

B.84:  [Throat_clearing].

A.85:  or to have their organizations come,

B.86:  [Throat_clearing].

A.87:  volunteer to help clean up the streets.

B.88:  Well, that's good.  #That's great.#

A.89:  #Because we have,# you know, every-, everywhere that a tree is down people
need help and,

B.90:  #Right.#

A.91:  #we're all,# all, a lot of older folks need help getting, 

B.92:  #Yeah.#

A.93:  #their yards# cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone and
they,

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  and, and they certainly can't carry it themselves and, 

B.96:  Right [Sniffing].

A.97:  So,

B.98:  That's one thing we do at our church is, uh, [throat_clearing] we have a
group called Hearts and Hammers, and we go along and, I'm really not sure how
we find the individuals, but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up
their homes that n-, desperately need it, and, uh, we go along with all the
material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix
whatever we can.

A.99:  Oh, that's great.

B.100:  Yeah, and spend a day doing, that's really neat.  I mean, it's not a lot
because you're just doing a house at a time, but you know, every little bit
helps.

A.101:  And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or,

B.102:  Uh, yeah.  They, uh, [throat_clearing] luckily we have a, a man who owns a
building company.

A.103:  Oh, so he,

B.104:  So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material.  Then what
he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.

A.105:  That's real nice.

B.106:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.

A.107:  [Noise].

B.108:  And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community
because we don't want recognition for it, you know --

A.109:  [Laughter] Right.

B.110:  -- so much as, we just want to help people out.  So it's real neat.

A.111:  #That,#

B.112:  #It's,# 

A.113:  that's real good.  And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling --

B.114:  #Yeah, it's# --

A.115:  -- #to be doing that.#

B.116:  -- like I say, it's not a lot, but it helps people.  Like this last couple
we helped, you know, they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and, I
just, you know, just tears your heart out to --

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  -- to see this kind of thing and you know, if you can do any a little bit,
it helps, so [sniffing], 

A.119:  That's, that's, uh, that's real good.

B.120:  #Yeah.#

A.121:  #We had,# uh, we had organizations like that in college, you know.  We had
a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups
and some did like that, some did elderly visits,

B.122:  #Yeah.#

A.123: #some did, uh,# some did, you know, Big Brother, Big Sister, stuff like
that.  And I'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our
school participated in some sort of a, some sort of group.  You know,

B.124:  Gosh.

A.125:  ac-, activity like that.  

B.126:  That's great.  That's a lot.

A.127:  You know. Twenty-five, I don't know.  Twenty-five percent?  {speaker A asks
someone else in the room}.  Yeah, my wife was big in that [Laughter].

B.128:  That's, #that's a lot of kids, though.#

A.129:  #And she thinks, yeah, twenty-five# percent.  It, it was a small school
[laughter].

B.130:  Oh, [laughter] well,

A.131:  But, uh, 

B.132:  still that's a, you know, that's a good #chunk of kids.#  

A.133:  #Yeah, but, I mean,# a, a, a lot of people would get involved and, you
know, because there were all different,

B.134:  [Sniffing].

A.135:  organizations to do.  There was Big Brother, Big Sister,

B.136:  #Yeah.#  

A.137:  #they had a# yearly auction, they had a dance marathon for charity or,
to, to support that,

B.138:  [Noise].

A.139:  group.  

B.140:  Yeah.  #That's neat.#

A.141:  #Such that, you know,# lots of people got involved that way.

B.142:  That's great.

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  That's great.  But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think
they should have to do a year [laughter].

A.145:  Yeah, no, neither do I.

B.146:  [Sniffing].

A.147:  I think it should be completely optional and --

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  -- you know.

B.150:  I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to
volunteer if you know what I mean.  They're not worth it [laughter].

A.151:  Yeah, they're not worth a year.  Or some people unfort-, just, just can't
even afford it,

B.152:  [Noise] {paper unraveling}.

A.153:  you know, whatever.  I mean,

B.154:  Right.

A.155:  the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well.  You know?  

B.156:  Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.

A.157:  People get shipped off and then, you know, and then, and then their
parents, I have a, uh, a, a friend whose, whose son is in the Peace Corps in
Guatemala, or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now.

B.158:  Oh.

A.159:  And, you know, he and his wife just went off to visit her and, you know, I
know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.

B.160:  [Laughter] I couldn't either.

A.161:  You know, so [laughter],

B.162:  I couldn't either.

A.163:  so I think, you know, and, and, and the kid's certainly not making much
money.

B.164:  Right, #right.#

A.165:  #So I can# see where that, that,

B.166:  [Sniffing].

A.167:  may be a problem.  

B.168:  Yeah.  I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and,
[throat_clearing] I mean, she's a teacher and, and just wanted to do it.
She'd been a teacher for a while.  Just decided she wanted to do it, so.  I
mean, I'm grateful for people like that, but,

A.169:  [Laughter].

B.170:  I don't see how they can just,

A.171:  Just take off a year.

B.172:  Yeah, just,

A.173:  [Noise].

B.174:  pick up and [lipsmack] head on out.

A.175:  Yeah, I don't,

B.176:  I wish I could do something like that, but [breathing] #I can't, so
[laughter],# 

A.177:  #Yeah,# yeah, well neither can I, so, I, I, I, I, I, I,

B.178:  [Sniffing].

A.179:  did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout,
but never --

B.180:  #Right, that's the way I am.#

A.181:  -- #never for a year again.#

B.182:  [Laughter] I know the feeling.

A.183:  So, so I guess our vote is no [laughter].

B.184:  That's right [laughter].  We're against it [laughter].  That's right.

A.185:  Well, it's been nice talking to you again.

B.186:  You, too, and I hope everything works out up there.

A.187:  Well, yeah, we're, we're slowly getting everything back together again.
You know, it, it's taking time, but --

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  -- everything, you know, we got lucky.  We had no damage to our house or
anything so,

B.190:  Good, good, that's great.

A.191:  The rest will just have to come with time.

B.192:  Yeah.  Well, good luck.

A.193:  Well, good luck to you, too.

B.194:  Thanks.

A.195:  Bye-bye [/Noise] {TV or radio}.

B.196:  Bye [/Noise] {like video game}.
