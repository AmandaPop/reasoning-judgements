REMARKS:        At the end of the conversation it was harder to transcribe
due to a lot of laughter and overlapping. 

============================================================================

@A.1:  So what's your opinion about the, uh, the increasing roles of women in
society today?

B.2:  Well, I think the biggest change, in like the last fifty years, has been
the increased number of women who work.  Now I think overall there's been a
change, I don't think, um, that's, uh, been surpassed by anything else than,
uh, that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and
changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we
have to have people to baby-sit and such.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  See, uh, the way, the way I look at it, is that, I don't think
that, the, that there's more women in, you know, working today.  I think that
the role of women in society is changing in a way that instead of working in
the house, they're working, you know, for paying jobs.  So it seems that women
are becoming more prominent in society, you know, it seems that they're doing
more work, I think the work is the same it's just that they're getting
different jobs, different, you know, they're, they're, how do you say they're,
uh,

B.4:  Employed outside the home now.

A.5:  Yeah, they're, they're, uh, up into more open space where more people can
see what work they're doing.  You know, you don't get credit for working in
the house but,

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  you do get credit for being the president of a corporation.

B.8:  More visible things.

A.9:  Exactly, visible.

B.10:  And things that use different kinds of mental skills.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  Maybe that's a, a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending
on, uh, you know, how big the house is and whether you had, you know, a lot of
children may not take as much mental skills and such as what working outside
the home does.

A.13:  Exactly.

B.14:  Uh, I think a lot of the modern conveniences today, you know, have
eliminated, matter of fact, you know, I think women even back maybe two
hundred years ago, when we were first starting the country may have been
looked at a little differently because it was really important to have the
woman there, and she probably, you know, gave half of the, uh, work output in
like a farm.  You know, her skills were as needed as the man's, to, you know,
to like establish a farm from the beginning,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  and then it got to be that, you know, with the industrial age, I think,
the women, uh, were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big
operation as a farm and their, the work was more confined to the household
chores which didn't really, uh, have as much to do with the whole livelihood
of the family, if you were in a farm situation.  It's kind of, kind of, kind
of gone all the way around that way in the beginning, you know, their work
input for a farm, and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such
was as important as the man's,

A.17:  Exactly, just as important.

B.18:  you know, needed both.  And then she got to be kind of in the house when
that wasn't needed as much, and now she's kind of like back out of the house,
but not working for the family business working, you know, somewhere else.

A.19:  Yeah, I think that's the, that's also, has a lot to do with, uh, today's
society, you know, in, in the past the woman was suppose to be at home cooking
for the men who were working.  Now days it's like, everything is so, is, is
so, integrated, a man can be a mother now days, you know, it's like just like,
uh, what was that movie, uh, Mr. Mom,

B.20:  Yeah [laughter].

A.21:  ((several)) years ago, and you know, it's, it's true, you don't, you
know, a woman and a man are, are pretty much equal now days in, in work.  It's
like, you don't have to be a woman to be a baby-sitter, you can be a guy, you
don't have to be a man to be, you know, the president of a corporation.  It's,
it's not, it's not, what you are, it's what your abilities are. That's the,
that's the important thing so it doesn't, you know, it's, it's integration of,
it doesn't matter if your a man or a woman that makes it all, you know,
everything makes everybody look equal for a job so it doesn't matter.  Now
days that, you know, there's, there's really no difference, is, is, you know,
the, the law.  The law says there's no difference so more women are, are
taking that opportunity to be in those spots.

B.22:  Well, some are kind of forced to, but I did see something in the paper
today, I didn't read it through thoroughly, but there was, uh, article about
a, a project, a study that Elizabeth Dole had started when she was still at
the Department of Labor.  Something called glass ceiling, it was trying to
look at how, uh, much opportunity there is for women executives to move up.
They're still saying that there are too many women in higher, uh, echelons as
management, you know, C E O's and that kind of thing.

A.23:  Too many?

B.24:  No, there's not many.

A.25:  Oh, okay.  Okay.

B.26:  They're saying that there's kind of like a glass ceiling that, uh, you just
don't find too many women in those positions.  I think it will just kind of
take time, um, you know, for women to be more acce-, you know, accepted into
those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and experience-wise, I
mean, starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty
years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills to be a C E O.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  And I'm a little frustrated too, because a lot of women who have their own
businesses, still don't seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of
consider a more woman kind of business.  I call it like the three C -s,
[laughter] like they're into cookies, like Mrs. Fields,

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  and [laughter] they're into cosmetics like Mary Kay and they're into,
uh, clothing,

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  you know, but they haven't really branched out into some other things
like you don't find too many women, uh, really involved with technology.

A.33:  One thing that's kind of due to the, the market, you know, uh, uh, a
woman's cookie store is much preferred to a man's, you know, a woman's
clothing store is much preferred,

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  to a, a man's clothing store for women, you know.  Like you, uh, a guy
wouldn't want to buy a car designed by a women,

B.36:  Why?

A.37:  you know, it's just like that.

B.38:  Why?

A.39:  It's, no, it's just these, these things, you know, these, these, uh,
values that, that you're brought up with.

B.40:  [Laughter]  How about a computer designed by a woman?

A.41:  Oh, see that's different.

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  A computer is unisex.

B.44:  Oh.  Oh, okay [laughter].

A.45:  Unless you design it in some sort of way,

B.46:  But historically --

A.47:  which can really satisfy you and not a man around or, I don't, I don't
know [laughter].

B.48:  -- [Laughter] historically you think of cars being done by Ford and such,
so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman, huh?
[laughter].

A.49:  Exactly,

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  you know, it's like, just one of those, those things that you're brought
up with.

B.52:  [Laughter]  Well, there's possibility that there's some woman on those
design teams [laughter].

A.53:  Well, I'm sure there is but, you know, you don't want, you don't want a car
that's designed, a man doesn't want a car that's purely designed by a woman.
Same reason that you may not want a dress or you may not want, you know, you,
your,

B.54:  Hey, there's some men designers out there that do very well.

A.55:  of course, but they're homosexual.

B.56:  Bob ((Macky)) and such [laughter].

A.57:  [Laughter]  Yeah, those, those men are homosexual like, what's that,
Pierre Cardin and,

B.58:  Oh, oh, oh [laughter].

A.59:  and, uh, Halston, course he died of AIDS so there, that's proof.

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  Well, I have to go eat dinner now.

B.62:  Okay.     

A.63:  Thank you very much for talking, bye.

B.64:  All right, bye [laughter].
