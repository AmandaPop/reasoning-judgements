=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  I'm a meat and potato man.

B.2:  You are, huh.

A.3:  Yeah.  I love to cook outdoors.

B.4:  You barbecue steaks?

A.5:  Barbecue steaks, and fry fish, but, uh, no exotic foods, although I did
order a, uh, a, uh, wok that I saw advertised on T V, and I'm looking forward
to getting that and cooking some Chinese food.

B.6:  Oh, okay.

A.7:  [Cough]  Pardon me.  [throat_clearing]  But, uh.

B.8:  I think my standard thing when I have company, and I'm not too brave trying
new recipes, so a lot of times I will get the grill out, and sometimes we do
like surf and turf, like we'll get some little filets --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- wrap them up with bacon, and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at
the same time.  So that's my husband's deal.  He's out there, you know
[laughter] --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- with the grill trying to get those things, he likes to put sometimes
even hickory chips on the barbecue, you know, get a little different flavor,
and then you do your mashed potato and your salad.  You can't go wrong with
that.  That'll push, please pretty much any guest.

A.13:  I like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce.

B.14:  Oh, you do?

A.15:  Yeah, I'll take some of the, uh, thick and rich barbecue sauce --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and put a little red wine in it --

B.18:  Ooh.

A.19:  -- a little, uh, uh, liquid smoke --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- a little soy sauce, and, uh, some, uh, seasoned salt.  Mix all that up
together and put it on the steak.

B.22:  Um, okay.

A.23:  Tastes pretty good.  Gives it a, kind of a hickory flavor.  But, uh, grill
I have, I, I don't normally put hickory chips in it, but it's got the, uh, uh,
rocks --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- in the bottom of it, and a lot of times the, the juice from prior steaks
will give it a good flavor.

B.26:  Oh, okay.  My only other standard menu, I guess, is, uh, Thanksgiving
[laughter].

A.27:  Oh, yeah.

B.28:  I know how to put the bird in, cook the bird and make all the trimmings.

A.29:  Yeah, I can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make.

B.30:  Yeah, well, what kind of things do you normally have with it?  People have
different ideas of what goes with it.

A.31:  Yeah, uh, you mean Thanksgiving?

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  Uh, I, I can make a meal just out of the, the, uh, uh, corn bread dressing
and giblet gravy --

B.34:  Oh, okay.

A.35:  -- and, uh, cranberry sauce.  I, I could eat just that and be satisfied.

B.36:  Yeah, my, uh, mother-in-law is into the corn bread stuffing.  Now I never
really had that much before I came to Texas, but she has always, she makes her
corn bread, and then of course, you know, she uses that to, to make the
stuffing.  We didn't do that so much.  I'm from kind of like Ohio area, and,
uh, we're, you know, not into the corn bread as much.  So our stuffing, was,
um, lot of times was, uh, like sausage or what not.  We would make it with,
you know, varied, uh, meats like that --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- inside the turkey.  And then, of course we always had to have mashed
potatoes.

A.39:  Oh yeah.

B.40:  And your standard vegetables, like you always had to have some peas and
corn [laughter].

A.41:  Peas and corn and green beans.  But, uh.

B.42:  And you got to have your cranberry sauce.  

A.43:  Got to have the cranberry sauce.

B.44:  Now I like jellied kind.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  And you got to have your pumpkin pie.

A.47:  So being from the north, I guess corn bread and black-eye peas are, are
strange to you [laughter].

B.48:  Well, yeah.

A.49:  (( )) from north, when we mention having black-eye peas and corn bread and
green onions.

B.50:  [Laughter] Yeah and it's funny because people call things differently in
different areas.  Um, my parents grew up a lot in the Philadelphia area.  I
was very young when we lived there.  But you call things differently.  Like,
um, uh, we called them all hoagies.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  Down here they call them submarine sandwiches.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  And we didn't ever call it, uh, cokes and such, you know, we call it soda.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  So it's just different terminology --

A.57:  Different terminology.

B.58:  -- for the same thing.

A.59:  I don't care much for those subs.  There's too much bread for me.  I don't
like that much bread.

B.60:  Yeah, that's, it's a different kind of bread, and it's somewhat of a harder
crust.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  It's not the soft, you know, kind of, uh, rolls that they have here.  It
was a harder crust.  And some of the hoagies were cooked.  Like the
Philadelphia, uh, steak --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- the, the hoagie steak that they, they sell.

A.65:  [Phone_ringing] But Thanksgiving, I don't really care that much for turkey.
It's too dry for me.

B.66:  Um.

A.67:  I'll eat the dark meat, but you can have the white meat.

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  That's like eating sandpaper.

B.70:  [Laughter] Well, what is it for, um, New Year's, lot of people make ham and
sauerkraut.

A.71:  Yeah, well, also New Year's down here you've got to have black eyed peas.

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  They're supposed to bring you good luck or good, or good finances.

B.74:  Uh, I think they cook cabbage up north.  I think that's one of the things
they want.  I'm not sure.  I'm not,

A.75:  I'll eat it as long as I'm not around while it's being cooked.

B.76:  [Laughter] Now, we always had a ham like on, uh, uh, Easter.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  You always have to have a ham or something on Easter.

A.79:  Yeah, I much prefer ham than I do turkey on Thanksgiving.

B.80:  I think last, let me try to think, I think the last time we had a big meal
like that we did have both.  I think we did have both on Thanksgiving, just in
case, people, you know, have a variety.

A.81:  Well, plus ham, if you're going to give a party or something, ham's always
good.  For one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands.  You don't
have to have a plate.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  But, you can just snack on it.

B.84:  Oh, that's true.  Well, um, you work here at the Expressway site?

A.85:  I work at the Lewisville site.

B.86:  Oh, Lewisville [laughter].

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  Any decent food in your cafeteria up there?

A.89:  [Laughter] I, I've heard people that, uh, have come and visited that plant,
that, from other plants, that our cafeteria is head and shoulders above the
others.

B.90:  Really?

A.91:  Yeah, that's what I've heard.

B.92:  Oh.

A.93:  But of course, you know, you eat day in and day out at one particular place
--

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- and I guess you get tired of it or whatever, and it doesn't seem like
it's as good as, as people say it is.

B.96:  Um.  Well, I normally work in the North Building, and, um, you would think
that since, you know, the executives are there that we would have a pretty
good one.  But I don't know, I think it's just kind of standard [laughter].

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Like we've got anything (( )).  They do cater to the executive dining room,
but I think they give them different food [laughter].

A.99:  I think so too.

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  And at Lewisville, I'm not fond of their vegetable selection.

B.102:  Oh.

A.103:  Uh, they have, as far as I'm concerned, because I'm not a big vegetable
eater, they have too many, uh, yellow vegetables on the same day, and it seems
like it's, it's a variety of the same type of vegetable.

B.104:  Um.

A.105:  Like they'll have, uh, they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and
cauliflower, all on the same day.

B.106:  Um.

A.107:  And that doesn't, I like more of a variety than that.  In fact one day,
they, they had, they had three kinds of potatoes.

B.108:  [Laughter].

A.109:  They had mashed potatoes, they had French fries, and they had au gratin.

B.110:  [Laughter] That is a little overdoing it.

A.111:  That's overdoing it.

B.112:  [Laughter] Well, my husband, he used to complain at the cafeteria because
it seemed like so many of their different items, they always added garlic to
it.

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  Like he would get tuna salad.  This is, what is that, and the first
ingredient, no matter what you're making, garlic [laughter].

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  And he said tuna salad shouldn't taste garlicky [laughter]. But everything
always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it.

A.117:  Yeah, and every once in a while they'll have dressing.  But, uh, whoever
makes it, uh, goes crazy with the sage.

B.118:  Um.

A.119:  Got too strong of a sage taste to it.

B.120:  Um.

A.121:  But, uh, I usually, I can usually find something to eat there, even if it's
a hamburger.

B.122:  Well, I'm, I spend a lot of time over in Park Central.

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  But we have just a little deli downstairs.  But, in the mornings they make
these really good muffins.

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  They don't make a lot of them, and I don't think they make them at other
places.  This little deli is like R C Cooper.  It's a little place, you know,
it's a little chain here in town.  It's real small.  But, uh, they make the
best muffins.  We're talking, it's a real good size one, you know.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  And they make them different flavors, like, oh, they have a chocolate chip
one.  Poppy seed is my favorite.  And, uh, they'll have like a banana nut, and
a apple one and a zucchini and a blueberry.  Really good.  They usually pretty
much go fast.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  They don't make a lot of them.  You have to get here early in the morning.

A.131:  Yeah, they have muffins there at the T I cafeteria, too, in the mornings.

B.132:  Pretty good?

A.133:  Yeah, they got, uh, blueberry, and I guess it's apple, or some kind of a,
maybe cinnamon apple.

B.134:  Uh-huh.  

A.135:  It's got the cinnamon on top of it.

B.136:  Um.

A.137:  And they're pretty good sized, too.  But I usually wind up getting a donut
[laughter].

B.138:  [Laughter].

A.139:  A chocolate donut.

B.140:  Well, you ought to try a muffin if you haven't.

A.141:  Like I really need the cholesterol.

B.142:  [Laughter]  Oh, well.  We all indulge, right.

A.143:  Yep, but I love to cook.  I wish I was a better cook than I was.  But I
don't, I love to cook.

B.144:  Well.

A.145:  I don't like them cleaning up the dishes [laughter].

B.146:  [Laughter] Yeah, I know.  My husband, he'll cook every once in a while, but
like the kitchen is a disaster area,

A.147:  [Laughter].

B.148:  afterwards.

A.149:  Yeah.

B.150:  Because he has to get everything out, and he loves to season.  I mean, he's
like, he gets every seasoning out of the ...
