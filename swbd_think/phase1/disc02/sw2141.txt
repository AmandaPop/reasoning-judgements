============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so have you seen any good movies lately?  

B.2:  Uh, well, let's see.  I think the best one I saw was probably, SLEEPING
WITH THE ENEMY.

A.3:  Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.  

B.4:  Have you seen SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?  

A.5:  Uh, no, I haven't seen that one yet, either.  

B.6:  Oh, what,

A.7:  How about, uh, AWAKENINGS?  

B.8:  No, but I've heard it's really good.  

A.9:  Okay.  Well, have you seen L A STORY?  

B.10:  No, I haven't seen that.  Did you?  

A.11:  Uh, yeah, I have.  

B.12:  What did you think of it?  

A.13:  Uh, well, it was, it was entertaining.  It was funny.  

B.14:  Huh.

A.15:  Steve Martin did a pretty good job.  

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  Uh, it's, uh, they portray the L A life-style --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and it's, uh, quite a lot, uh, crazier in the movie than it is in
actuality.  I've been to Los Angeles before --

B.20:  Oh, really?  

A.21:  -- and nothing's as crazy as what they, how they, uh, uh, describe it in
the movie [laughter].

B.22:  Yeah.  Well, I saw a few of the, uh, little coming attractions, you know.
It looked really cute but,

A.23:  It's kind of fun.  If you've been there before, y-, you'll be able to
relate to, uh, to the humor that they have in the movie.

B.24:  Yeah.  Well, I've never been to California.  

A.25:  Okay.  

B.26:  I've lived in Washington, but not California so,  

A.27:  I thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with, uh, Victoria
Tennant as his, uh, love interest in the movie because she is his wife in
reality.

B.28:  Oh, I didn't even realize that.  That's interesting.  Um.  

A.29:  So that added something to the movie.  

B.30:  Yeah, I guess so.  Did you see HOME ALONE?  

A.31:  No, I haven't seen that one yet either.  

B.32:  Oh, well, I was kind of disappointed in that one.  

A.33:  Okay.  

B.34:  I've heard so much about it that, you know, it's such a great movie and you
ought to go see it over and over again, and, uh, I thought it was just kind of
like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble [laughter].

A.35:  Yeah.  I, I heard that it was a little pretentious that the family was,
very wealthy --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- and it just didn't appeal to, uh, to as many people as it, as it could
have.

B.38:  Yeah, yeah.  I was kind of disappointed.  But, uh, are you intending to see
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?  Have you,

A.39:  Yeah, I've heard that's really, really good.  

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  Uh, friend of mine at work, 

B.42:  It's pretty intriguing.

A.43:  saw that.  

B.44:  Yeah.  It's, it's a very unusual movie.  Kind of keeps you, well, the first
part of it wasn't as [lipsmack] scary and intense as I thought it was going
to be, but toward the end it got, got more that way.

A.45:  Well, I understand it has a real complicated plot.  

B.46:  Yeah, yeah it really does [laughter].  The only way they can get any
information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre, it's hard to tell
what he's going to do next.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  So, yeah, s-, it was a good movie.  [Lipsmack] And then I thought
SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY was even scarier, but that's because it was about a
man chasing a woman and that's my big fear so,

A.49:  Okay.  

B.50:  [Throat_clearing].  

A.51:  Yeah, uh, 

B.52:  I was trying to think if I've seen any others lately, but that probably
pretty much sums up, I don't get to go to the movie too much [laughter].

A.53:  You seen, uh, GHOST?  

B.54:  No, I haven't.  As a matter of fact, it's on at the dollar movie around
here, I was wanting to go.

A.55:  Yeah, it's been out for quite a while already.

B.56:  Yeah, 

A.57:  That is, is,

B.58:  I heard that was really good.  

A.59:  it is a very good movie.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  Uh, Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore -- 

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63: -- did a really good job.  Very, uh, emotional, put it that way.

B.64:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, that's the way I under-, as a matter of fact my sister
believes in, uh, ghosts and she said that she thinks that's a real, uh, true
portrayal of what it would be like.

A.65:  Well, that's interesting.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  The special effects were great.  I have to admit that.  

B.68:  Yeah.  I, I want to see that.  As a matter of fact I intended to go one
night and didn't get to, so [noise] {sounds like knocking},

A.69:  Okay.  

B.70:  Hopefully we'll go soon.  

A.71:  You seen, uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS?  

B.72:  No, I haven't.  

A.73:  Oh it's,

B.74:  As a matter of fact, I don't know anything about that movie, what it, it,
is that --

A.75:  It's,

B.76:  -- i-, it funny or,  

A.77:  Uh, yeah, it's somewhat of a, a bittersweet [noise] {sound of liquid
pouring} comedy.

B.78:  Huh.  

A.79:  It stars, uh, Johnny Depp -- 

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  -- he's, uh, from TWENTY-ONE JUMP STREET.  

B.82:  Right.  

A.83:  And, uh, he portrays, uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS this, uh, creation of, uh,
Vincent Price.  A, uh, kind of a scientist,

B.84:  Huh.

A.85:  who, uh, creates a person, uh, out of, uh, oh, just, uh, spare parts and
I guess, uh, cookie cutters, or whatever [laughter].

B.86:  Oh, really, huh.  

A.87:  It, it's kind of interesting.  

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  He, he doesn't complete the job, though and his hands are, are, are not
finished, so he has,

B.90:  Oh.

A.91:  scissors on the ends of his arms.  

B.92:  Oh, huh.  

A.93:  And is, is found in this, uh, castle by, uh, oh, it's the local Avon lady
or something like that.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  And she takes him into her house and, uh, he learns [breathing] what
life is like, uh, in a, uh, moderately normal suburb.

B.96:  Oh, well that is interesting [clinking].  

A.97:  It's, uh, it, it is entertaining.  It's kind of like a fairy tale.

B.98:  Yeah, huh.  

A.99:  With a sad ending, but, uh, 

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  it's, uh, 

B.102:  Oh.  

A.103:  It was different.  

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  S-, uh, a fun movie.  

B.106:  Well that sounds pretty, yeah.  [sniffing] Is it something that, uh,
that you could take a child to?

A.107:  Oh, yes certainly, uh-huh.  

B.108:  Oh, I have a six and a half year old that probably enjoy that.

A.109:  Oh, I think it'd be great for a, for a, a child.  

B.110:  Yeah, huh [sniffing].  

A.111:  It does have a, a, a fairy tale-like, uh, quality -- 

B.112:  Oh, well, 

A.113:  -- that,

B.114:  I'll have to, have to take her to see that.  

A.115:  Scenery is, is very entertaining.  Uh, and what he does with the, with the
scissors and, uh --

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  -- uh, doing, uh, certain types of landscaping, uh, working with
shrubberies.

B.118:  Huh.  

A.119:  Uh, he, uh, carves out different figures in the, in the plants,

B.120:  Oh, really.

A.121:  shrubs.

B.122:  Huh.  Wow, that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make.

A.123:  Uh, yeah, I, they, they evidently spent a lot of time on, uh, on the
scenery for that, the special effects.

B.124:  Yeah, I can imagine.  

A.125:  Have you seen THE FIELD over at the Inwood?  

B.126:  No, I haven't.  

A.127:  That's, I thought that was an outstanding film.  Which,

B.128:  Huh.  I don't know anything about that, either.    

A.129:  With Richard Harris.  

B.130:  Uh-huh.  

A.131:  Uh, he plays a, uh, kind of a patriarch in, uh, Ireland,

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  nineteen twenties Ireland -- 

B.134:  Uh-huh.  

A.135:  -- and, uh, it's about a, uh, piece of land that he rents.  Uh, he works,
uh, a piece of land and rents it from, uh, an old English, uh, widow.

B.136:  Um.  

A.137:  But, uh, he, he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to
own it and won't allow anyone else to, uh, to, uh, control that land.  And
when the widow puts it up for, uh, for sale, uh, he claims that it's his even
though he cannot afford, uh, the, the price.

B.138:  Um.  Uh-huh.  

A.139:  It, uh, goes to an American, uh, who has, uh, ancestors from, from the
area.

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  He's trying to, uh, apparently trying to, uh, [breathing] uh, [lipsmack]
gain some background on his, his heritage from, uh, Ireland,

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  so he's buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the
area --

B.144:  Um.  

A.145:   -- and, uh, there are just a lot of, uh, interesting, uh,

B.146:  [Static].

A.147:  [Static] subplots, and, uh, it's a very intense movie.  

B.148:  Well, it does sound interesting.  

A.149:  [/Static]. 

B.150:   I have never been to the Inwood theatre.

A.151:   [breathing] Well they well they have more of the artsy type of uh

B.152:   Uh-huh.

A.153:   films

B.154:   Yeah.

A.155:   a lot of foreign films there

B.156:   Do you go there often?

A.157:   [breathing] No not too

B.158:   Um.

A.159:   often uh but uh this was a uh just a good opportunity to go see that movie It

B.160:   Yeah.

A.161:   was uh [breathing]

B.162:   Hum.

A.163:   I really enjoyed it

B.164:   Yeah well it sounds interesting. [breathing] Well does this um [exhaling]. however this is
set up tell you when you talked for five minutes or do you just,

A.165:  Well, they cut you off after ten [laughter].  

B.166:  Oh, really?  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh, okay, well I didn't know, this
the first call that I've made so I wasn't real sure if you [sniffing] --

A.167:  Oh, okay.  

B.168:  -- if it tells you when you've talked long enough or [laughter].
[Sniffing] Let me think if I have seen anything else that's interesting
lately.

A.169:  Well, getting back to, uh, to that other, uh, film, uh, with, uh, which one
was that, with Jodie Foster?

B.170:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.171:  Uh,

B.172:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  

A.173:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  

B.174:  Uh-huh.  

A.175:  Yeah, I didn't really care for her, her earlier films.  Uh, TAXI DRIVER --

B.176:  Uh-huh.  

A.177:  -- or THE ACCUSED. 

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  And I was kind of wondering if this was, uh, a little different style
departure,

B.180:  I'm sure.

A.181:  from what she's done before.  

B.182:  I haven't seen either one of the other films she was in, but, uh, my
husband said that he thought she was playing a real different role,

A.183:  Okay.

B.184:  i-, in this show, yeah.  

A.185:  I never did care for her too much in the other films, 

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  ((and)) friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different,
that, uh,

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  she's really good.  

B.190:  I, I, one of the things that I was really impressed with, uh, she has to
[lipsmack] have an accent that she does a real good job with.  I, it sounds
so real that she sounds like she's from that area of the country.

A.191:  All right, that's interesting because ((I)),

B.192:  Yeah, uh, I think it's like in the, I don't know, Alabama, Georgia, South
Carolina area or something.  It's, and she does a real good job sounding like
she's from that area.

A.193:  Okay.  

B.194:  [Sniffing] But, uh, I thought she did a really good job.

A.195:  Well, that's good.  I'll have to go see that.  

B.196:  Yeah, uh,

A.197:  It's been highly recommended.  

B.198:  The man that plays this bizarre character is really, I don't know if I've
ever seen him in a film before, I don't e-,

A.199:  Anthony Hopkins? 

B.200:  Oh, (( )) Anthony Perkins, yeah.  I didn't remember him from anything else.
I, I'm sure I've seen him in other movies, but he looked so, his, his face,
the entire movie just haunts you.

A.201:  Uh-huh.

B.202:  And, uh, he did a real good job.

A.203:  Sounds like I'll have to go see that one soon.

B.204:  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a big crowd there.  I think it's, uh, definitely
getting some good ratings.

A.205:  Okay.  Yeah, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts,

B.206:  Uh-huh.

A.207:  I haven't seen PRETTY WOMAN yet, uh, have you seen that one? 

B.208:  No, I haven't.  

A.209:  Because she was just on, uh, the PEOPLE'S CHOICE awards the other night --

B.210:  Oh, really?   

A.211:  -- and won, uh, a PEOPLE'S CHOICE award for, uh, best, uh, female
entertainer --

B.212:  Um.  

A.213:  -- as well as, uh, an award for this movie.

B.214:  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Well, I thought it was, I really enjoyed that
movie.  I mean it scared me more than the other one, but it was real intense
to me.  I enjoyed it.

A.215:  Okay.  Well, I'll have to go see that one, too.

B.216:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, it has a real eerie beginning and the man that she's
married to is obviously crazy, but at the first you don't really know about
that, and it's real interesting the way it starts out.  So, uh, I thought it
was really int-,

A.217:  Sounds like another obsession type movie, uh,

B.218:  Yeah.

A.219:  like FATAL ATTRACTION.  

B.220:  Yeah, it is.  It's a lot like that.  I thought FATAL ATTRACTION was a good
movie.  Did you like it?

A.221:  Uh, I thought that, uh, the movie, 

B.222:  I didn't like the ending, though.

A.223:  the movie that it was based on was better.  

B.224:  Oh, really?  

A.225:  That was, uh, which one was that.  With, uh, Clint Eastwood and Donna
Mills.

B.226:  Um.  

A.227:  It came out in nineteen seventy, trying,  

B.228:  I didn't know it was based on another film.  

A.229:  Oh, it was called PLAY MISTY FOR ME.  

B.230:  Um.  

A.231:  And I thought that was a very good film.  

B.232:  Uh-huh.  

A.233:  And FATAL ATTRACTION was on the same theme,

B.234:  Oh, I see.

A.235:  almost identical.  

B.236:  Huh.  

A.237:  But, uh, I didn't care for FATAL ATTRACTION as much.

B.238:  Huh.  Well, I liked it until, toward the end I, I didn't care for it too
much but, 

A.239:  No, it gets quite violent [laughter].  

B.240:  Yeah, yeah and it's kind of unbelievable, too.  

A.241:  Yeah.  

B.242:  The, this woman can live through everything she lived through.

A.243:  Right.  

B.244:  Yeah.  

A.245:  Well [laughter],

B.246:  Well, I can't think of much else to talk about [laughter].  

A.247:  Okay.  Well, I think we're reaching our limit anyway so, 

B.248:  Yeah, I think so.  Well, thanks for calling.  

A.249:  All right, I appreciate it.  

B.250:  Uh-huh.  

A.251:  Thanks a lot.  

B.252:  Good-bye.  

A.253:  Bye.
