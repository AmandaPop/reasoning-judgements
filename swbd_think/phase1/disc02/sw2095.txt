===========================================================================

A.1:  All right, have you lived in this area long?

B.2:  No, I've only been here a couple of years.

A.3:  Okay.

B.4:  Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a
lot warmer than it has in the past.

A.5:  Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually
about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.  I
mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.

B.6:  Yeah, yeah, well I remember last year, or the year before, 

A.7:  But it,

B.8:  uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh, terrible ice storm, uh, around this time
of the year.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny it, it's really quite,
uh, quite amazing.

A.11:  Yeah, unseasonable.  I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San
Antonio, couple years ago,

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring, it was so much ice
that came down, later on that afte-, that afternoon and evening,

B.14:  Um.

A.15:  it was just, it was horrible.

B.16:  Yes, I was just talking to my son today, he's up in Boston,

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  and it was twenty-nine there and it was, you know, in the seventies out
here and,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  it was really, uh, he really wished he could be here, rather than there.

A.21:  Yeah, well, um, I don't know I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to
colder weather.

B.22:  Oh really.

A.23:  Um, I, I like it warmer, I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm but
it doesn't really matter.  I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at
this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain
possibly but, uh,

B.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I have, you know, I, I, don-, I think it's really been
delightful.  I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas
and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all.

A.25:  Well I spent three years in Germany, so I'm not too thrilled with the whole
thing anyway [laughter].

B.26:  [Laughter].  

A.27:  But I got used to it, it was really strange, I mean, when I, when, when,
when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just
swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was
just, it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry, it's just not very
comfortable, it just,

B.28:  Her-, do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.

A.29:  Yeah, a little bit.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  You must, well, uh, it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?

A.33:  Yeah, [laughter] my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my
visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister, we were, we were down
there and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride
with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car [laughter],

B.34:  Oh, wow.

A.35:  and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,

B.36:  Oh yes.

A.37:  and this, it was just, the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent
plus and it was just killing us.

B.38:  Oh yeah, it's terrible.  Orlando is the only place I've ever been where
I've seen the car sweat.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  I mean, that's really bad.

A.41:  Yeah, well, [throat_clearing] I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some
places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like
Monterey, California or,

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.43:  you know, just, you know, so mild, and then you've been to such extremes
like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,
you know you're sweating,

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  you look down at your arm, but you see the water leaving your arm, it's
so hot,

B.46:  Oh wow, uh.

A.47:  you just feel it pulling away, bizarre.

B.48:  I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the
weather when it's very temperate.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Uh it doesn't, some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing
of the seasons but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you
know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  So, it's kind of a luxury.

A.53:  I tend to agree but, I don't know, I, I think, in, in some, in some
respects it probably (( )) more tolerable.

@@B.54:  Yeah, well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as
some of the others we might have gotten.

A.55:  No, the other topics.  I got one topic, they said talk about the Middle
East situ-, [talking] well,

B.56:  [Laughter] I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think
about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.  We messed up the
conversation, anyway.

A.57:  Well [laughter] I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty
controversial topics so it's just like well that was my fault.  But then the
weather's like, man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane, I mean you can only talk
about, about the situation just so long.

B.58:  Yeah, I know, weather's just not all that inspiring.  Okay, well it's nice
talking to you.

A.59:  Okay.

B.60:  Bye-bye.

A.61:  Bye.
