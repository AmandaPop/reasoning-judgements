============================================================================

A.1:  So, what kind of eating out do you prefer?  Do you like,

B.2:  Uh, I don't know, uh, medium priced restaurants usually.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Not anything too nice because we have a four year old.

A.5:  Oh really.

B.6:  So, I usually like things that cater to children.

A.7:  Things that don't cost too much, but you get your money's worth.

B.8:  Yeah, and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too, it doesn't bother the
other people.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  But don't, don't you,

B.10:  Lots of fast food too.  I hate to admit it, but.

A.11:  Yeah, but don't, don't you like to get away from it all,

B.12:  Oh yeah.

A.13:  every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime.

B.14:  Yeah, then we go to some place nicer, quieter.

A.15:  Something with, uh, a cuisine that's a little bit, you know, more
sophisticated like an Italian or French restaurant or something like that.

B.16:  Uh-huh, yeah, there's, uh, ((BIRRAPORETTIS)) is one of our favorites.  It's
real nice, it's Italian.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  It's nice and dark and quiet.  So it just kind of depends on the occasion.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  What do you like to do?

A.21:  Well, I personally don't like to go to Italian restaurants because, I'm
Italian and,

B.22:  [Laughter] So that's just like every day food for you, huh.

A.23:  Well not really because, you know, I li-, I live here in a dorm, I, I still
go to college,

B.24:  Oh.

A.25:  but I, I kind of don't eat Italian foods unless I go home because my mom
cooks Italian food and it's just like, you know, there, you know, she,

B.26:  Um.

A.27:  I, I think that she cooks the best so there's no reason for me to go out
and pay an enormous sum for something that's just not as good.

B.28:  Yeah, hers probably would be the best.

A.29:  Yeah.  But, you know, I also like the, the fast food places like Taco Bell
because you can get a lot of food for cheap prices.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, thirty-nine cents, or whatever, for those little tacos.

A.31:  Yeah, fifty-nine cents, yeah.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  So, you know, 

B.34:  My son likes those, yeah.

A.35:  Yeah, it's, it's something that, you know, we go there every Sunday.  Me
and my roommate go there every Sunday,

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  you know, with our hangover from Saturday and we go to, uh, Taco Bell and
get the tacos, you know, it's, it's cheap, you don't have to spend a lot of
money.

B.38:  Yeah and it tastes pretty much, 

A.39:  Yeah, yeah.

B.40:  I mean I like the way it taste good and it's fast.  I like that too.
Well I have to cut this short, but I think I'd better get back to work.

A.41:  Oh, okay. 

B.42:  So, thanks for calling.

A.43:  Yeah, bye.

B.44:  Bye.
