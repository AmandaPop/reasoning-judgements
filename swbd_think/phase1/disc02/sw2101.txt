===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?

B.2:  Oh, this is kind of tough.  I don't too often watch, you know, shows that
are on, on a regular bases.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  I don't have a lot of time and I don't really like some of them to tell you
the truth.

A.5:  [Throat_clearing].

B.6:  I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.

A.7:  No. 

B.8:  But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES,

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  every week.  Uh, ugh, it's kind of tough to think of some of the others.
Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.  Uh,

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I
will watch, uh, KNOTS LANDING [laughter].

A.13:  Oh, you will? 

B.14:  Yeah, just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type
of thing,

A.15:  Relax.

B.16:  but, uh.  How about you? 

A.17:  Well, I watch, um, I like news programs, like you mentioned, and sometimes
I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.

B.18:  Yeah, I don't get that so I don't have,  

A.19:  [Throat_clearing].

B.20:  that choice.

A.21:  Yeah, I, I like that.  I, I watch that a couple of times a week, um, it
comes on like at nine o'clock,

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  at night and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch
regularly.  I, I have seen that, um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Monday nights before and it's kind of cute,

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  and, but I don't,

B.28:  But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,

A.29:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh.

B.30:  uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh,
fellow.

A.31:  Oh, but,

B.32:  I mean he's playing a military part.  He's the husband of,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN.

A.35:  Right.  I know who you're talking about.  I haven't, I have seen it, I
think, maybe once.

B.36:  Yeah, you know, it wa-, it was on one time when I saw it and, you know, it,
it's pretty cute.

A.37:  [Laughter] ((I like that)) Well, I, um, I, we really don't watch too many
programs regularly.  My children like some of the morning children's shows,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  when they're home.  They, um, I just have one son who's in kindergarten
so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's
called.  It's just like a SESAME STREET,

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  show, but [throat_clearing], and they watch a couple of shows like that,
but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.

B.42:  Yeah, no I don't,

A.43:  And, uh,

B.44:  I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch
pretty regularly.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh, and a lot of times I
record it and watch it some other time.  But, uh,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  they have programs on, uh, house repairs and,

A.49:  Um.

B.50:  how to build things and, um, they have a calligraphy show, and I do
calligraphy, so, I watch that.

A.51:  Oh, that's nice.

B.52:  And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows,

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort
of pick up little tidbits from those.  I don't sit and watch them but, but I
enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or
something,

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.

A.57:  [Laughter] That sounds like a good idea.  I notice that, um, since we moved
here that we, we did get the cable T V, and when the newspaper comes out on
Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  and I record some.  And then, uh, we have just totally cut down, and we
never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of
things that we can record and then,

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  and watch and then record over it, something else.  And so that's been
really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and
have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.

B.62:  Yeah, we do some of that,

A.63:  [Throat_clearing].

B.64:  In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the
movies that are on T V,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  than, you know, other kinds of things. 

A.67:  Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news
programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like
nostalgic older movies,

B.68:  Yes.

A.69:  that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time [laughter].

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  Like the MARX BROTHERS [static] and things like that.

B.72:  Yeah, those are pretty good I, I like those old ones,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  much better than some of the new stuff.

A.75:  [/Static] Right.  And so we, we have really enjoyed that and it's really
nice not to be running out.  Some of the video rentals can be expensive and,

B.76:  Yeah. And, boy, the movie can be unbelievable.

A.77:  Uh-huh, right.  Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at
the theater or something.  So we, I have, and it's so convenient at home and
you can do it anytime y-, you take the notion.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  And so, I have really enjoyed that but, but there are, I do have friends
that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are
either home watching it or definitely recording it.  They have some programs
that they won't miss.

B.80:  Uh-huh, I'm not that hung up to most things.

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  I mean if I miss something big deal [laughter].

A.83:  Yes.  Well, and things are repeated,

B.84:  Yeah.  That's true.

A.85:  so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are
it'll be that exact same show [laughter].

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  if I ever decide to tune it in again,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.  Pretty funny.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  But, uh, T V is something that we try an-, to not, um, deliberately try not
to get hung up on it,

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  like you say.

B.94:  We do too.  Too many other things to do and too much going on.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's
what you do with your,

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  spare time.

B.98:  Right.  I agree. 

A.99:  So it's a little bit, something that we try doing and there's, there's a
lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several
hours every day.

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's
educational but still you want them to go out and do other things.  Even if
they're,

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  Anyway.  Well,

B.106:  Okay.  Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?

A.107:  Yeah, That was pretty good I, I like that and, um, I guess it's time to go.

B.108:  Okay.  I enjoyed talking to you.

A.109:  Yes.  Nice to have spoken with you, too.

B.110:  Okay.

A.111:  Bye-bye.

B.112:  Good-bye.
