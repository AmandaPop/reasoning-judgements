==========================================================================

B.1:  First one I've had from California.

A.2:  And where are you?

B.3:  Uh, North Carolina.

A.4:  Uh-huh.  Well I guess the only people I've talked to before were from
Texas.  [laughter] So, I, I was,

B.5:  Yeah, mine, me too.  And I ha-,

A.6:  I was beginning to think that was the only people on the network.

B.7:  Yeah, they all work for T I, too.

A.8:  [Laughter].

B.9:  [Laughter].

A.10:  Well, what do you, uh, what are your favorite television shows?

@B.11:  {Light static} Well, first and foremost it's got to be L A LAW.

A.12:  L A LAW.

B.13:  Yeah.

A.14:  Yeah, that's a very popular one around my office, but I've never seen it.

B.15:  Never?

A.16:  Never have seen it.

B.17:  My goodness.  

A.18:  I,

B.19:  It's hard to beli-, I didn't think there was anybody in the country who
hadn't seen that one.

A.20:  Well, I can go even better than that, I've never seen DALLAS either
[laughter].

B.21:  Never?

A.22:  Never once [laughter].

B.23:  Goll [laughter].  I admit that I used to be hooked on DALLAS, but back, way
long time ago when Jock died I gave up watching it.  It just got too funny
[throat_clearing].

A.24:  Well, I think I just sort of, uh, didn't start watching it, and then felt
like I would have been way too late getting in on the action to figure out
what was going on.  So I never did get involved in it.

B.25:  Well, I think the writers had the same problem [laughter].

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  I mean, th-, they went for an entire season with this, and I'm sure you
heard about it, all these things --

A.28:  Who killed J R  [laughter].

B.29:  -- all these things going on, no this was, I think, it was before or after
that.

A.30:  Oh.

B.31:  But they went for this whole season, and they had all these situations, and
then to end the season, come to find out, Pam, it was all a dream.

A.32:  Oh, yes, yes.  

B.33:  Y-, remember that?

A.34:  I remember reading about that thinking, uh, I would have just strangled
them.

B.35:  I mean an, and then, oh, I, I tell you, that just did it for me right
there.

A.36:  [Laughter].

B.37:  I said, you've put me through an entire season of Pam dreaming?

A.38:  Yes.

B.39:  You writers are coming, you know, you're having a hard time here.

A.40:  I think that's right.  I think they just lost their, uh, inspiration for a
while.

B.41:  Really.  I understand that this is the last season for it.

A.42:  Yeah, somebody said --

B.43:  Uh, I, I read something in the paper.

A.44:  -- that, uh, J R is going to die and that will be end of the season
forever.

B.45:  Yeah that's, 

A.46:  I mean, the end of the show forever.

B.47:  Yeah, they, uh, I read something in the paper today talking ab-, or it was
PARADE magazine yesterday, and they said, you know, when's the last upset and
what's going to happen.  And they say, insiders say J R is going to get
knocked off.

A.48:  [Laughter].

B.49:  Good.

A.50:  [Laughter]  Well, it's about time.

B.51:  It's about time.

A.52:  Too bad they didn't kill him the first time.

B.53:  Yeah, too bad they didn't get away with it.

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  Shoot.  Well, anyway, what's your favorites?

A.56:  Oh, well, I mostly watch Public Television, so, yeah, I'm one of those.  I,
uh,

B.57:  No, I, I, that's what I spend most of my time watching that, 

A.58:  Well, I love MASTERPIECE THEATRE.

B.59:  Oh, yeah.

A.60:  And I love the mystery series.

B.61:  Yeah, mystery, especially, uh, Miss Marple.

A.62:  Oh, yes.  ((All of)),

B.63:  I, I've, I've got all the videos that I can get my hands on of, of Miss
Marple.

A.64:  Oh.

B.65:  Yeah, I love those.  I used to --

A.66:  Oh really.

B.67:  -- I lived in England for about four years, so it really brings back --

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  -- some memories.

A.70:  We have, uh, uh, a local station, uh, on our cable network here that, uh,
is showing all the Miss Marples over again.  So we got to repeat them.

B.71:  It must be either, uh, A and E or, um, uh, DIS-, DISCOVERY.

A.72:  I, I think it is A and E.

B.73:  Yeah.  A and E runs quite a lot of them.  Uh, I like Discovery channel,
too.

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  I like, they have lots of wildlife shows and, 

A.76:  Oh, they do have some absolutely gorgeous things. So,

B.77:  Yeah {Music in background}.

A.78:  Uh, but they, uh, the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the
weekend, was the GARDENS OF THE WORLD.  Did you see that one this week?

B.79:  Huh-uh, no, I missed it.

A.80:  Uh, well.

B.81:  Nice I bet.

A.82:  We are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public T V
channels.

B.83:  Um, boy, that is, that is good [throat_clearing].

A.84:  [Laughter] So, we, we get things over and over, so if we miss them, we can
catch them later.  And that GARDENS OF THE WORLD was absolutely glorious.

B.85:  I bet it was.

A.86:  It was, uh, Audrey Hepburn was narrating it.

B.87:  Um, I like her.

A.88:  And they took you all over, 

B.89:  Oh, I like t-,

A.90:  uh, started in Italy, went to England, France, some in America, uh, also
Japan.

B.91:  Um.

A.92:  Anyway, it was a really a --

B.93:  Really nice, I bet.

A.94:  -- a visual treat.

B.95:  I bet.  Yeah.  The interesting thing about public T V is it's not public
around here.  You have to have cable to get it.

A.96:  Is that right?

B.97:  Uh-huh.

A.98:  Uh.  Well.

B.99:  Silly.

A.100:  When I was in Houston, there was one station, of just, uh, it was, uh, the
University of Houston station.

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  And, uh, so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the
country were getting, because each station gets its own mix.

B.103:  Uh-huh.

A.104:  But when I moved to California and all of a sudden I had this, uh, this
surfeit [laughter] --

B.105:  Uh-huh.

A.106:  -- of public television.

B.107:  Yeah.

A.108:  We can get all sorts of things.  Everything from, I guess on Saturday,
there, you can watch something like eight different cooking shows.

B.109:  Uh-huh.

A.110:  So, I don't, but I could if I felt like it.

B.111:  Yeah.  I, I spend a lot of time down in Charlotte, uh, and on their, just
the, the regular T V, not cable, you can pick up four P B, or three P B S
channels.

A.112:  Uh-huh.

B.113:  But, uh, the closest one to Raleigh is in, uh, Chapel Hill, which is about
twenty-five miles away, and believe it or not, you can't pick it up.

A.114:  Really.  

B.115:  Yeah.

A.116:  I would have thought that was close enough.

B.117:  It was, it should be close enough, but I guess they have the antennas
pointing it the other way or something.  But.

A.118:  Or you got a hill between you or something like that.

B.119:  Yeah, it's, uh, just, you can barely see the picture and you can't hear
anything.  So.

A.120:  Well, the onl-, about the only things I watch on commercial television are
THIRTY SOMETHING and TWIN PEAKS, uh, and I just discovered that they, uh, have
canceled [laughter] both of those.  So.

B.121:  Oh really, yeah.

A.122:  [Laughter].

B.123:  I've, I've never seen either one of them.

A.124:  Well, let me tell you that, TWIN PEAKS was much better when it just
started.  So maybe it's time for it to quit.  I, they've gone downhill, too.

B.125:  Well, I guess there were, I guess it was pretty popular, because there was
quite a lot of TWIN PEAK conversation.

A.126:  Well, the thing I liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you
couldn't predict what was coming next.

B.127:  Well, at least, that, that's what I like about a show.  If you can predict
it, it's not worth watching, y-,

A.128:  That's right.  And this one had all sorts of weird little things and would
go off in, uh, strange directions, and it had lots of, uh, little subtle
touches, that if you weren't watching, you would miss, uh, that they'd have
references to literature and things like that --

B.129:  Um.

A.130:  -- and they'd also just have odd things.  Like they walk into a bank vault,
and there's a deer head,

B.131:  [Laughter].

A.132:  lying on the [laughter] table in the bank vault.

B.133:  [Laughter].

A.134:  And there's no explanation for it.  They treat it as perfectly normal, and
somebody says, what's the deer head doing here.  And they said oh, it fell off
the wall.  [laughter] So why was it doing on the wall?

B.135:  [Laughter].

A.136:  And in one case the fellow was making coffee, and they said there's a fish
in the coffee pot [laughter].

B.137:  [Laughter].

A.138:  Well, I suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's FISH IN THE BUCKET OF
MILK, but I don't know for sure, and I'm not sure what the relevance would be
if it were.

B.139:  [Laughter] Sounds like,

A.140:  Anyway.

B.141:  like a pretty good show.  I'm sorry I missed --

A.142:  It had a lot of things like that thing,

B.143:  -- sorry I missed that one.

A.144:  to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it.

B.145:  You know, I, I don't watch very much T V.  I, I watch, um, L A LAW --

A.146:  Uh-huh.

B.147:  -- and I watch SIXTY MINUTES --

A.148:  Uh-huh.

B.149:  -- and AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS --

A.150:  Um.

B.151:  -- and that's about it.

A.152:  Well (( )),

B.153:  And I watch the, I sometimes watch the, the news.

A.154:  Yeah, I'd say probably what I watch the most faithfully is the news, which
I really don't watch as much as I just listen to it.

B.155:  Yeah, back, well, when I had cable, I used to just keep it on C N N, not to
watch it but just to have it in the background, because I'd always listen to
it.

A.156:  Well, when I'm fixing dinner or something like that, I, uh, at least know
if there's anything I want to read thoroughly in the newspaper.

B.157:  Uh-huh.

A.158:  I get the headlines off the television.

B.159:  Right.  Yeah, the, uh, cable prices are just too high nowadays, and I'm not
going to, I, I just won't pay that, that kind of money for, for what I'm
getting.

A.160:  Yeah.

B.161:  I mean, I miss A and E and I miss DISCOVERY and I miss C N N, but that's 
it --

A.162:  Uh-huh.

B.163:  -- uh, and it just, it just wasn't worth it just to get those three.

A.164:  Uh, we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular
locality was so poor --

B.165:  Uh-huh.

A.166:  -- that we could only get about three stations and, uh, only one was a
public station --

B.167:  Yeah.

A.168:  -- and we had a San Francisco station and a San Jose station, but neither
one of them was very clear.

B.169:  Uh-huh.

A.170:  They were both barely adequate.

B.171:  Yeah.  Well.

A.172:  So we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so
we could see what we were watching --

B.173:  Right.

A.174:  -- if we watched anything at all.

B.175:  Yeah, I'd, I'd probably, I'd probably get cable, but I've got, we got the,
the three networks and two local stations and that fulfills my needs, because
I don't watch T V that much anyway anymore anyway.

A.176:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think I would be inclined to do the same thing if we could
see anything,

B.177:  Yeah.

A.178:  [Laughter] without the cable.

B.179:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Course, like I say, the only thing I do miss
is P B S, because I, there several things on there I like, MASTERPIECE
THEATRE, MYSTERY --

A.180:  Uh-huh.

B.181:  -- especially those.

A.182:  Yeah.

B.183:  MASTERPIECE THEATRE is really good.

A.184:  They have had some absolutely wonderful shows,

B.185:  Yeah, and, and you,

A.186:  and they do, they have incredibly good, what are called, production jobs.

B.187:  Yeah.

A.188:  They have really well researched, uh, locations and sets and costumes --

B.189:  Uh-huh.

A.190:  -- and so forth, and as far as I can tell on places where I have some
knowledge, their historical research is excellent.

B.191:  Yeah.
