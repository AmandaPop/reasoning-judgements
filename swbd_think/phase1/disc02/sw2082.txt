============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what do you feel [laughter] is contributing most to air pollution?

B.2:  Cars [breathing] [laughter].

A.3:  Cars you think so?

B.4:  Yeah, I really do, I, because I'm from California originally,

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  and so I saw the beginning, I feel I saw the beginning of air pollution
in the fifties, and I think then it was basically from, from automobiles, I
really do.  And it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and
now it's just terrible.  Factories don't help.

A.7:  Yeah, I, I would have figured that some of the factories may be
contributing as much as, as, uh, automobiles.

B.8:  But, we have so much traffic now, so many cars.  You know they're trying to
fix it, uh, with all this emission control and everything.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  But, then I still cars going down the road with all this smoke pouring out
of the back end of them.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And that infuriates me.  I always want to tell them, you know, don't you
know what you're doing to our air?  And I don't understand how they can get
their, uh, how they can get their car inspected and get away with that.

A.13:  Well, if you only have to get your car in, inspected once a year you can
just have it fixed real quick right before the inspection.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  And, and a lot of, when you, a lot of places when you go get the inspection
they just pull it out of the garage and then pull it back in, and they don't
really check anything, they just make sure the lights work basically.

B.16:  They've really cracked down up here.

A.17:  Have they?

B.18:  Yes.  Uh, really [laughter].  My neighbor has a, uh, he has a, a fairly
new car but, it's an, in the eighties, it's a, Taurus --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and he went to get his inspection and there was something about the
emissions, something that wasn't quite right and they wouldn't pass it, and, I
mean there's no smoke or anything comes out of his car, it's a nice car and,
uh, he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet, you know,
the emissions and he went to several places.

A.21:  Oh gosh.

B.22:  So, so, they're starting to crack down.

A.23:  Yeah, that will help.

B.24:  Yeah.  I really [cracking and heavy breathing],

A.25:  Less people drive and more pe-, you know, more people riding in one car
rather than everybody riding to work by themselves would help a little bit and
if, if everyone car pooled that would cut it down in half.

B.26:  Yeah.  Um, T I is trying to promote car pooling up here with buses and, and
trying to get people to ride share and stuff like that, but um, I use my car
for wor-, during the day,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  for the job, so it's really hard for me to do that.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  But,

A.31:  Well, uh, in, uh, San Antonio {beep noise} the parking downtown, I work
downtown and the parking is so dad-gum expensive you basically have to car
pool to be able to afford to park.  It costs seventy-five dollars a month,

B.32:  [Breathing].

A.33:  just to park my car.

B.34:  Oh, my gosh.

A.35:  So, I ride with two other, uh, girls so that way it will only costs me
twenty-five dollars a month to park,

B.36:  Uh-huh,

A.37:  but it's just crazy and it's, from what I understand I know a girl in
Washington D C, and it costs her a couple of hundred dollars a month to park
her car.

B.38:  Oh, that's terrible.  That, that make me take the bus.

A.39:  Yeah, and from what I understand, New York City is worse. That it just
costs a fortune to own a car in New York City.

B.40:  You don't really need one in the city.

A.41:  Huh-uh.

B.42:  And they have such good um, uh, what, transit systems.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You know they've got trains and everything, wh-, and we really need that,

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  Uh, Texas is really lacking in transit and I think when they, if they would
do that, and put in trains and stuff,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  that that would really help a lot because people, I would much rather
take a bus or a train than use my car.

A.49:  Yeah.  Uh, once you're in downtown San Antonio it's real easy to get around
they have a, they have these, uh, buses that, that look like little street
cars.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And they go all around, that it's just real easy to get around once you're
downtown, the problem is getting downtown and they have some, uh, Park and
Ride, uh, expresses, where you go to the, the bus stop and you get on the bus
and it takes you directly downtown, but they don't have enough of them and
they're not convenient enough --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and there just happens to not be one convenient to where I live, so,

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  if, if there were I would ride the bus.

B.56:  Can you really see pollution down there now?

A.57:  Uh, no, not really,

B.58:  (( )), but see,

A.59:  Um,

B.60:  You can see it here.  I mean you can just see it hanging in the air
[laughter].

A.61:  I noticed once flying into D F W there was just a, a brownish-orange haze,

B.62:  Yeah that's it,

A.63:  over the city.  It was the ugliest thing I had ever seen.

B.64:  it's terrible.  It's really terrible, and in the summer time it seems to
be worse because it, there's no air to blow it out,

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  you know it's, it's horrible.

A.67:  This is a nice time of the year though when it's so windy it just seems
everything is so fresh.

B.68:  And all the trees are starting to bloom out,

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  and everything, yeah.  So I just hope it's not too late.  I hope we've
caught all this pollution and stuff.  Hope they're, we're just not going to
wait until it's too late to do anything, we're going to have to live in
bubbles.

A.71:  Um.

B.72:  Worries me.  It worries me.  They should have been doing things that their
doing now twenty years ago, you know, to stop it.

A.73:  Yeah.

@@B.74:  But they really haven't.  So, well, what do we do?  Should we hang up
[laughter]?

A.75:  Yeah, I guess so.

B.76:  Okay, have we reached ten minutes?

A.77:  I think it's five,

B.78:  Ok-,

A.79:  and I think we have,

B.80:  Okay.  Okay.

A.81:  It was nice talking to you.

B.82:  Okay.

A.83:  Bye-bye.

B.84:  Bye-bye.
