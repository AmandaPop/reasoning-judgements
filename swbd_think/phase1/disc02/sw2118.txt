=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay, well, let's see.

A.2:  Probably, uh, in the last few weeks, the biggest, uh, way I've had of
keeping up with what was going on in the Gulf was C N N and I think maybe
that's probably true for everyone.

B.3:  Right, uh, we don't get that in, uh, straight fashion but, you know the
other major channels have been carrying a lot of it, so, I've seen a good bit
of their coverage.

A.4:  Oh, well, we, we get the, first, you know it comes directly to us from C N
N,

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  and it's a continuous coverage, and, of course, they repeat themselves a
lot and, it was really easy when, as we said, well nothing's happening in the
war because now they're interviewing the, what seems to be dozens of Mideast
experts all at once.

B.7:  Right, well they've really done, uh, good job of keeping everybody informed
of what's going on.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  Sometimes I've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know.

A.10:  A little much, yes [laughter].  We have, uh, we're a town of five thousand
and so our local newspaper is not too swift.

B.11:  Uh-huh.  Well our, uh, newspaper does a pretty good job on most things,
but, you know, its, uh, not totally in depth and quite frankly, I didn't read
all of the war stuff.

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  You know, it was just, there were too many long articles and I try to
quickly read through the paper before work in the morning, so I don't, don't
get to spend a lot of time on everything.

A.14:  So you are off to work this morning.

B.15:  Uh, I'm at work, yes.  

A.16:  Oh, you're at work.  

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  Oh, I wa-, assumed that these were home telephone numbers.  Uh, we also get
a Chicago, uh, paper and of course, that's where our main coverage as far as
world events are concerned.  Our local paper is just current events.

B.19:  What about your, uh, radio stations, do they, uh, provide much in the way
of current event stuff?

A.20:  In our town of five thousand we have one that is, uh, local F M, A M
station and their news is fed from C N N too.  Uh, it's more of, uh, oh, call
in for a trading post type thing and, uh, the, fif-, music from the fifties
and, uh, it's I guess what you'd expect from a farming community.

B.21:  Uh-huh.  Well I've lived in a small town before and was quite aware of the
local radio station at that time and I know how they are.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  Well ours, uh, that we tend to listen to most, um, I like the way they
handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll
have, you know, five minutes worth of news every half hour, but in the middle
of the day, they don't just drown you with the same old stuff, and they won't
interrupt unless it's, you know, really important.

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  And, and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff.  But
they didn't just over do it.

A.26:  I only watch one soap opera a day and it seems to me, and that's probably
about once every two months since my husband retired, it seems to me so often
times that they cut into that soap opera with what I don't really consider as
earth shaking.

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  I guess maybe I think sometimes the, uh, the coverage is almost too
intent.

B.29:  I think so, I, I don't really think we need to know, or even sometimes care
so much about all the little nitty gritty things they keep asking over and
over.  I think, think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  You mean when the reporter sticks the, the microphone in the
person says, the person's face and says how do you feel that you house has
burned to the ground [laughter].

B.31:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.32:  It's a bit much isn't it.

B.33:  Things like that are just kind of absurd.  Or once in a while they'll,
they'll keep just, uh, hounding someone that they're interviewing.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  And, there seems to be no purpose, uh, you know, the person has stated
some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they
just keep on and on and on.

A.36:  I guess maybe they have so much time to fill.  I've thought often times
that maybe our world was a little bit better place when I was in high school
and the wor-, and the news like your radio station was on fifteen minutes in
the evening and then they went on to, I don't know I think the Andy Williams
show or something that filled up the other fifteen minutes of that half hour
and we just weren't so heavy with it.

B.37:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.38:  Well it's sure been nice visiting with you.

B.39:  Well you too.

@@A.40:  We're having sleet and rain in Indiana this morning so.

B.41:  Oh, well we're having sunshine, and I think it's going to be up in the
seventies today, so.

A.42:  Oh, well have a good day then.

B.43:  You too.

A.44:  Bye, bye.

B.45:  Good-bye.
