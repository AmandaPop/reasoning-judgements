A.1:  Are you a T I -er, Carla?

B.2:  Yeah, I am. 

A.3:  Oh, and you work in the Sherman plant?

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  Uh, whereabouts?

B.6:  In the front end, the wafer fab. 

A.7:  Oh, okay, good deal. 

B.8:  Where do you work?

A.9:  Oh, I'm in Dallas.  I'm in, uh, in S C group Q R A. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  I'm kind of a world-wide quality manager based here in Dallas. 

B.12:  Oh, great. 

A.13:  Uh, mostly the offshore assembly sites. 

B.14:  Oh, wow. 

A.15:  Except I'm fixing not to be a T I -er after a week from today. 

B.16:  You going to Motorola?

A.17:  No, I'm going to Onum. 

B.18:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.19:  Um, it's a subcontractor house.  They, uh, they builds, in fact they build
product for T I.  But it's been thirty-two years, so I mean, I've, I've served,
I've done my time. 

B.20:  Oh, yeah. 

A.21:  Okay, you ready to talk about taxes. 

B.22:  Oh, yeah. 

A.23:  Okay. 

B.24:  Were you happy with your return this year?

A.25:  Huh?

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  What'd you say?

B.28:  Were you happy with your tax return this year?

A.29:  No [laughter],  no [beep]  {on phone line}.

B.30:  Was it negative?

A.31:  Okay, I guess we're on the air now. 

@B.32:  Okay. 

A.33:  Well, what do you, uh, what do you think, uh, uh, what's your biggest gripe
do you think, is it the proposed state income tax or the, or the gigantic
federal income tax we seem to be paying every year, or what?

B.34:  I think my biggest gripe is the gigantic Federal income tax.  I came from a
state that paid, uh, state taxes three years ago, and that seemed to be
relatively small compared to like the, uh, the tax you pay on sales, sale
items.  And, um, I don't know, I think, uh, my biggest gripe is with Federal. 

A.35:  What, what state are you from, Carla?

B.36:  Indiana. 

A.37:  Indiana.  You had a state income tax there?

B.38:  Right. 

A.39:  Are you able to credit that against your Federal income tax?

B.40:  Yeah, it's a percentage, you divide that, well, you, uh, how much you paid,
or something by your Federal. 

A.41:  Oh, okay.  So you do get some credit, but not the whole thing. 

B.42:  Right. 

A.43:  Okay because,

B.44:  There's a lot of tax breaks for like, you know, a lot of things if you're
involved in the state, like giving to colleges and things like that --

A.45:  Oh, I see. 

B.46:  -- then they'll break you for. 

A.47:  Okay.  What, uh, what generally what percent of your income is it?

B.48:  Um, not even sure, because I was a student, so I didn't pay that much. 

A.49:  Oh, okay, okay. 

B.50:  But, uh. 

A.51:  Because as you know, we're, there's, there's, uh, ugly rumors on the
horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas.

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  And what percent would that be?

A.55:  Uh, I have no idea.  I, I, I, uh, I'm, I'm originally from Massachusetts,
but they didn't have a state income tax when I worked, when I lived there.  So
I have, uh, no, and I know they have one now.  And I have no idea, I have no
idea what it is.  But you know, getting back, getting back to the Federal
income tax.  I remember during the Reagan administration, I think it was the
Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty-six or something like that --

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  -- when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler, and all that kind
of stuff --

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  -- uh, I don't believe it, it's worse. 

B.60:  I know, well you can't deduct for credit card interest --

A.61:  Oh, sure. 

B.62:  -- that type of thing. 

A.63:  And I seem to have more of that every year. 

B.64:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.65:  And, yeah, the only thing that's left deductible is, uh, is mortgage, uh,
interest, basically. 

B.66:  Right. 

A.67:  And, would, then, and, and that's significant.  And every once in a while
they make noises like they're going to take that out, and that would just kill
the housing industry if they did. 

B.68:  Oh, yeah. 

A.69:  And, and, uh, one other things that I only found out this year, and, uh,
uh, I thought, at one time I worked in Malaysia for T I and had more money
than I knew what to do with, so I started making accelerated house payments.

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  And I said, gee, you know, this would be great because I'll, I'll have a
lot of equity in my house.  Then when my children are old enough to go to
college, I'll get a equity loan, which will increase my mortgage, so I'll be
able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest
deduction part.

B.72:  Oh, wow. 

A.73:  Guess what. 

B.74:  What happened?

A.75:  That's not legal in Texas.  It's the only state in the country that it's
not legal.  Everybody else can do it, but in Texas.

B.76:  Oh my gosh. 

A.77:  And, and so I got this three thousand foot, five bedroom house that I've
got almost paid off, and all kinds of equity in it, and don't have, huh, and,
you know, struggling to keep, I've got two children in college and I'm going
to have three by September.

B.78:  Oh, man. 

A.79:  But, but, uh, it was just my fault in not checking it out, because I've
heard of people doing it, so I thought it was pretty good deal. 

B.80:  Uh-huh. 

A.81:  So, but the, uh, uh, I, I, it just seems to me that the, that the income
tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year.

B.82:  Oh, yeah. 

A.83:  And I'm not exactly sure we, what we get in return.  I was listening to a
talk show.  I don't know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there. 

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  But I listened to David Gold {phonetic spelling} this afternoon on K L I F.
And he was saying that in nineteen fifty-four Americans paid about one cent on
the dollar in taxes.

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  And now we're paying something like a little over fifty, fifty cents. 

B.88:  Fifty cents. 

A.89:  When you consider Federal income tax, F I C A tax, sales tax, and all the
other things we get hit with. 

B.90:  It's incredible. 

A.91:  It is absolutely incredible.  And, and, and the mentality that you cure
ills by throwing money at it, and you throw, and you raise the money to throw
at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible.

B.92:  Uh. 

A.93:  Uh, is, you know, do you have children in school?

B.94:  No, I don't, I just got married, I don't have any children. 

A.95:  Oh, you know, you just got married. 

B.96:  [Laughter]. 

A.97:  Okay, well, one of the worst things in Tex-, how long you been in Texas?

B.98:  Three years. 

A.99:  Oh, okay, well you'll find out one of these days, because you probably came
from a state that's got a very decent public school system. 

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  And you'll find out that in Texas we've got, uh, I think we rank fiftieth
out of fifty states. 

B.102:  Yeah. 

A.103:  And, and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise the taxes and
spend more money [laughter]. 

B.104:  I think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these
schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different
schools.

A.105:  Yeah, well that, plus that fact that you look into the, we've got some very
good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children
private schools. 

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  And what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion
of people on the payroll that are teaching than they do in the public schools. 
And, and my son goes to a, uh, high school here in the Richardson school
district which is one of the better ones in Texas. 

B.108:  Yeah, I heard that. 

A.109:  Uh, and, and, and, uh, however, my goodness, they got an assistant
principal for everything.

B.110:  Really. 

A.111:  And, and, and they've got, uh, I don't know what the ratio is, but they've
got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are
actually out there teaching.  And it's sort like we do at T I. 

B.112:  [Laughter]  Sounds like T I, I was getting ready to say. 

A.113:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah, we get, we get fat in those areas. 

B.114:  Yeah, and then all your money goes to overhead. 

A.115:  Yeah, and, and, and, and we got, they, they got a lot of overhead in those
schools.  And rather than throw more money at it, they got to figure out how to
get, get the most out of the people that they got. 

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  And, and, get them in the classroom.  Plus, uh, I don't know, it seems to
me that more so than when I went to school, there are a lot of courses that
aren't going to allow, first of all they're not college prep courses.  And I
don't think they're going to help a person make a living.

B.118:  Right. 

A.119:  They're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty-one credits so
they can graduate.

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  And [laughter] and all that, and, and so I'm not, I'm not overly pleased
with that either.  But the, uh, uh, the tax thing, and I think, our sales tax
is, uh, uh, somewhere around eight percent now, isn't it. 

B.122:  Right, in Dallas.  It might be a little less here in Sherman. 

A.123:  Yeah, I think right here in Dallas we're paying about eight percent, and,
you know, uh, I say I was initially from Massachusetts, I've been here
thirty-two years.  But they used to call it Taxachusetts. 

B.124:  Oh really. 

A.125:  And I was there on business this last weekend, and I made a few purchases,
and I realized that as bad as their reputation is, their sales tax only about
five percent. 

B.126:  Oh, wow. 

A.127:  And I know there were several things that I bought that were something in
the order of a dollar, and I noticed it was about five cents added onto it. 
Plus, it doesn't cut it as early.  You know, you buy a ten cent candy in seven
eleven here and you pay eleven cents. 

B.128:  Oh really. 

A.129:  [Laughter]  And I notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents, I
think.  So --

B.130:  Well --

A.131:  -- the little items you pay what the price tag says. 

B.132:  -- now if they propose, if the, if this, you know, state income tax goes
through, are they going to lower the sales tax?

A.133:  I don't know, I, I don't, I bet they're not.  I, I'll absolutely bet
they're not.  It, it's interesting.  I wish I knew this question was coming
up, because I've only heard of it in bits and pieces, but apparently there was
a bill before the Federal legislature today to, uh, lower social security tax,
but the other end of it, they were going to raise income taxes.

B.134:  Oh, man. 

A.135:  [Laughter] They were going to give with one hand and take away with the
other, and I, I just heard bits and pieces on the radio today, and I, I
hadn't, uh, uh, I haven't heard that, I haven't heard that much about it.  Uh,
what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana?

B.136:  Think it was like five and a half --

A.137:  Uh-huh --

B.138:  -- percent. 

A.139:  -- okay.  Did you go to school there, in Indiana?

@@B.140:  Yeah, Purdue. 

A.141:  Indiana University?

B.142:  No, Purdue. 

A.143:  Oh, Purdue. 

B.144:  Uh-huh. 

A.145:  Okay, you were a Boilermaker, huh. 

B.146:  Oh, yeah. 

A.147:  Yeah, yeah, you follow the girls, uh, basketball team. 

B.148:  Yeah. 

A.149:  Boy, we were, we're tremendous girls basketball fans here. 

B.150:  Oh great. 

A.151:  And we saw them, we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin
last year. 

B.152:  Oh. 

A.153:  We were Lady Longhorn fans, naturally, but we did see Per-, so we're aware,
uh, that they've, that they've got a very good program there. 

B.154:  Yeah, they, well, it's just been the last three or four years --

A.155:  Yeah. 

B.156:  -- actually.  They had poor seasons before that but. 

A.157:  Yeah, and I think they went further this year. 

B.158:  Yeah. 

A.159:  Uh, I, I think they got into the second or third round of the, of the
play-off this year. 

B.160:  Yeah, they've been exciting to watch. 

A.161:  Yeah, and, that's an int-, what did you get your degree in?

B.162:  Supervision. 

A.163:  Okay, super-, that's an interesting degree. 

B.164:  Yeah. 

A.165:  What sort of things does it entail?

B.166:  Lot of theory, um, it's pretty, it's pretty broad, took some engineering
courses, some math, a lot of, uh, a lot of theory, lot of practical, like
personal, um, problems and personnel problems and that type of thing. 

A.167:  Are you actively in supervision now?

B.168:  Yeah. 

A.169:  Have you taken some of the T I supervisory skill courses?

B.170:  Yeah.  The Boss Course. 

A.171:  Yeah, the Boss Course. 

B.172:  Yeah, that was a really good course, and, and I was going to ask you think
of it relative to some your,
