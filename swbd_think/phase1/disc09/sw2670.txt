===========================================================================

A.1:  So tell me about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Is it great?

B.2:  I liked it, I really did.  Actually I saw it twice.  My room-, ex-roommate
and I were real into psychological things.  We, we think people with mind
problems are really interesting [laughter]. 

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  I mean, you know, real psychotic people. 

A.5:  Right. 

B.6:  So we were dying to see it.  So we went and saw it.  And I had to see it
the second time to get it all because I kept my eyes closed through so much of
the first part.

A.7:  Is it really that scary?

B.8:  Well, it's, it's not that it's that scary, it's that it's so graphic,
because, uh, well, are you going to see it? I don't want to tell you how it
ends [laughter].

A.9:  I, I, I, uh, I plan on probably renting it at some point in my life. 

B.10:  Okay, [laughter] so some time later, much later, huh. 

A.11:  Yeah, I've got small children.  I don't get out to many movies. 

B.12:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's, uh, what is so weird about it is that it, it's a
real, it's based on real people. 

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  And, I read the story in PEOPLE MAGAZINE about where they got the
characters in the movie, and they're a combination of a lot of different
serial killers in real life.  And so, a lot of things that happen in the
movie, the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you.
It really does happen in real life.  You know, nor-, normally in movies you
can look at it and say, well, it's a movie.

A.15:  And that doesn't really happen. 

B.16:  Right. 

A.17:  It's only pretend. 

B.18:  Right.  But in this, you're going, I, I would have done that, I can see
where that would happen. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  And it gets really scary.  But, it's, it's a real interesting movie, very
thought provoking.  There are so many things to discuss when the movie's over,
if you're one of those people that likes to discuss things --

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  -- and think about why it happened.  I, I still talk about it with Whe-.
We'll call each other now and then and go, Remember when in the movie this
happened, well I was just reading today, and things just keep relating back to
it.  I thought it was fascinating. 

A.23:  Maybe I should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner
afterwards so we could sit and talk about it. 

B.24:  I don't know if you want to go to dinner [laughter]. 

A.25:  [Laughter]. 

B.26:  Maybe just go out for a soda or something [laughter]. 

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  I don't think you want to eat [laughter].  It is real good though.  It's,
it's I liked it.  I liked DANCES WITH WOLVES too, though. 

A.29:  Oh. 

B.30:  That was a real good movie. 

A.31:  Yeah.  That was one of the best films I've seen --

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  -- in a long time. 

B.34:  I didn't think I'd like it.  I don't normally like the old West type
movies, things like that.  They don't normally interest me.  But that one, I
really, really liked because it, it, I didn't know so much about the Indians
and all that that happened in that part of the war.

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  I had never heard anything really about that before.  And this was a whole
new idea to me anyway. 

A.37:  What,

B.38:  I thought it was real good. 

A.39:  What's your heritage?

B.40:  Um, I'm about a quarter Italian, and my grandmother on my mother's side is
a little bit of everything.  Typical American.  Little bit of Indian, little
bit of this, little bit of that, and that's about it.

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  What's,

A.43:  I've got quite a bit of Indian blood in me. 

B.44:  Do you. 

A.45:  So, some of it was, um, things that I had heard.  Well, both of, I had two
great grandparents that were full blood. 

B.46:  Oh, really. 

A.47:  And, but they were on opposite sides. 

B.48:  Which one, were they Sioux Indians, or what were they. 

A.49:  No, one was, uh, Blackfoot, and one was Cherokee. 

B.50:  Oh, neat. 

A.51:  And, um, so I knew a lot about just, um, oh, the kind of respect they had
for the earth --

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  -- that it was real, it wasn't something I just read in books.  It was
something I was taught. 

B.54:  Right. 

A.55:  And, um, and, so, you know, like the scene with the buffalo. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  Oh --

B.58:  That was awful. 

A.59:  -- I cried. 

B.60:  Oh, I did, too,

A.61:  That was horrible. 

B.62:  I did, too. 

A.63:  I just, I mean, you know, it that, because I know it happened over and over
and over again. 

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  And, I mean, it's just like we're raping our land now, but. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  Uh, you know, it was, I, I just thought was one of the best movies I've
seen in so long, because it made me laugh, I mean, I was, you know, parts of
it I was just almost in the aisles laughing over it.

B.68:  It makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are, people who
have no ethnic background, no heritage, anything other than just typical
Americans, a little bit of everything and they don't really know.  They don't
know anything about the Indian people.  They don't know anything about the
Europeans that came over. 

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  You know.  It really made it seem like we are so in the dark --

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  -- on so many things. 

A.73:  Yeah, I think that it tried to make people realize that, um, we can't close
our mind to another culture simply because it's not ours. 

B.74:  Right, exactly. 

A.75:  And, uh, it was so, there was so the Indians did teach us and there was so
much more they could have taught us had we only listened. 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  And I still really, other than just basic ignorance of prejudice,
I don't understand why we didn't.  Why them? Why did we not listen to them?

A.77:  They had something we wanted. 

B.78:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah. 

A.79:  [Laughter]  We wanted,

B.80:  Isn't it sad to think that that much, that greed can do that much to you,
or to a person.  I mean, they, we wanted the land, and we didn't want them to
have it, so, just screw everything they're going to think and teach us and
tell us and we could just like wipe out an entire people like that.  That's
sad.

A.81:  Well, I think of the, uh, you know, the gang wars and the racial wars --

B.82:  Right. 

A.83:  -- that we have now in so many of our cities and in our high schools that
are basically the same thing acted out by a younger generation over, uh, you
know, they're fighting over things that to them are important enough to
possibly die for.

B.84:  Right. 

A.85:  And yet they just don't matter. 

B.86:  Right. 

A.87:  And, you know, I mean, it comes down to, that the land, or the territory or
the, you know, the bathroom or whatever, is there for everyone. 

B.88:  Right. 

A.89:  And it can be enjoyed by all if shared. 

B.90:  Right. 

A.91:  I mean, but, but that's what we did to the Indians.  We said, you know,
we're afraid of you, you don't, you don't look like we do, you don't talk like
we do, so we're going to move you out. 

B.92:  Right. 

A.93:  And we offered reservations as, you know, consolation prize, and they were
a joke.

B.94:  Right [laughter].  That is, that's a good way to look at it.  A consolation
prize.  Well, that's about all it was. 

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  That's really sad that things like that can still happen today, after all
this time. 

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  You'd think we'd a learned something by now. 

A.99:  Yeah, but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win. 

B.100:  Yeah, that's true.  He with the most toys [laughter].  I guess. 

A.101:  [Laughter]  All that counts in Monopoly is who has Boardwalk and Park
Place. 

B.102:  That's right, who's got more hotels.  [laughter]  I really did like SILENCE
OF THE LAMBS, though.  That was really an interesting movie.  I liked DANCES
WITH WOLVES, but it was an emotional, like you get real involved and you cried
and you feel sorry for the people and all this, but in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS it
was kind of like FATAL ATTRACTION.  Did you see that?

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  It was kind of that feeling through the whole thing.  On the edge of your
seat, wanting to tell the people what to do next. 

A.105:  [Laughter]. 

B.106:  It, you're like, no, don't go in there, don't give him your name, you, you
start acting it out for them. 

A.107:  I definitely ought to get in on a rental then, because people would look at
me in the theatre going, what is this woman doing. 

B.108:  No, believe it or not the whole theatre got involved. 

A.109:  Really?

B.110:  Yes.  In fact, I'm try-, I can't remember which scene it was, but at one
point, everyone in the theatre clapped, they were so happy.  It was, and I
thought I was just there, and I heard other people crying when I was crying.
There were certain parts in there that were real sad.  And you hear people
when, you know, the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap
some bad thing, and everyone in the theatre will go, uh [breathing] {sharp
intake of breath}, and everybody does it.  It's like the whole theatre, you
get this big, uh [breathing] {sharp intake of breath} sound.  It was, I think
everybody felt that way through it.  It was real involved.  And all the girls
were crying when they walked out --

A.111:  Goodness. 

B.112:  -- and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that
didn't bother me.  And you know it did [laughter]. 

A.113:  [Laughter]  This is going to roll right off my side. 

B.114:  Right.  I remember the first time I saw it was with my boyfriend, and he
was joking with me about how I wasn't going to watch half of it, I was going
to close my eyes.  And there were quite a few scenes where I did.  But this
one scene I knew something bad was coming, I could tell, so I ducked my head,
and about that time I heard the audience go, uh [breathing] {sharp intake of
breath}, and my boyfriend jumped.

A.115:  [Laughter]. 

B.116:  He literally jumped.  And he swears he didn't do it.  And I felt him jump. 

A.117:  [Laughter]  Oh, that's great. 

B.118:  [Laughter]  It really was, to this day I tell him he was scared, and he
says, no, no.  You just didn't watch it, you should have watched it, it wasn't
that bad.  I'm like, yeah, right, that's why you jumped [laughter]. 

A.119:  [Laughter]  I'm going to have a hard time waiting for it to come out on
video now. 

B.120:  Yeah, really.  It is a great movie.  You got to see it.  It is so
fascinating to think that there are people that are so, so smart.  They're such
geniuses that they cross that line --

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  -- and they're, they're psychotic --

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  -- and it's amazing. 

A.125:  It's very scary. 

B.126:  It really is.  I mean to think that it could be anybody we know.  I mean,
you could be walking right next to one of them, and not even know it, because
they look perfectly normal. 

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  I mean, this man was a doctor --

A.129:  Uh-huh. 

B.130:  -- and he had patients, in fact they were the people he killed, you know,
and you think, right now, your doctor could be wacko.  He could be some
psychotic killer, and no one would ever know. 

A.131:  Yeah. 

B.132:  It's just strange. 

A.133:  [Laughter]. 

B.134:  That was what was, that was what made the movie because it's so real.  I
like movies that are based on things that are real. 

A.135:  Yeah, yeah I do, too.  I, uh, oh, what was it? Um, the ones about, um, Von
Bulows,

B.136:  Oh.  What was that?

A.137:  Um, oh the, something about Portuguese,
