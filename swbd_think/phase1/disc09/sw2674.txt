REMARKS:        Tremendous echo on side A when both are played together.
Side B was difficult to transcribe because it was so faint that even when
played separately, it couldn't be heard over side A.

============================================================================

A.1:  I know, uh, that Texas laws are more, uh, what's the word I want, more, r-,
I think realistic, because they do believe in capital punishment and they do
every once in awhile exercise that. 

B.2:  That's true. 

A.3:  Uh, we're, as I said, Indiana's very conservative and I cannot remember the
last time anyone was electrocuted or whatever method they use nowadays to
carry out a death sentence.

B.4:  Do they have a law on the books up there?

A.5:  They have, uh, uh, uh, you know, I'm just not even aware of what the law
is, it's, uh, been so long since anyone was executed that it might be legal,
but it's not done.

B.6:  Right. 

A.7:  My husband would know whether it's legal or not but I'm not very,

B.8:  So what's your, uh, opinion on capital punishment?

A.9:  I believe in capital punishment for certain crimes, do you?

B.10:  Yes, uh,

A.11:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.12:  # there's, # you know, there are some things just that, just are
inexcusable. 

A.13:  Right. 

B.14:  Brutal crimes, and ser-, ser-, serial crimes, things like that. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  Um, you know, to me, the punishment doesn't even fit the crime, but you
can't get any worse. 

A.17:  Uh-huh.  They, uh, [throat_clearing] I, th-, to me I think they have to
come to that with, uh, as you say, brutal crimes, because of the prison system
being so crowded.  That seems like, just because you don't have a place to put
someone doesn't seem like a very logical reason to kill someone else, which of
course, is what it is, but I think it would be a detriment to c-, or, would be
a deterrent to crime because I know someone who's mad isn't going to think,
well gosh, I can't do this or they'll put me away but somehow I think if the
punishment doesn't fit the crime, the crime's more likely to happen.

B.18:  Right.  I think, in a way, it's unfortunate they've come up with, with nice
ways to, um, execute people.  I guess to me, if, if I was a, uh, potential
serial killer or something, it wouldn't stop me to be, uh, to die of lethal
injection, I mean it's as painless as you can go. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  I mean I think if I was in a bad accident and they gave me the option, I
might say, yeah, you know. 

A.21:  # Go with it, huh [laughter]?  #

B.22:  # Give me an injection.  But, # uh,

A.23:  You think they should go back to crucifixion then [laughter]? 

B.24:  [Laughter] I don't know about that.  Um, but, uh, you know, the electric
chair on the other hand, is probably a pretty painful way to go.  I don't
know.

A.25:  Um. 

B.26:  I don't know personally.  I'll never be in that position. 

A.27:  Well, we certainly hope not. 

B.28:  [Laughter]  So, but I don't, I think it should be something that's, that is
a deterrent, that's something that, that, {pause} that's scary, and (( ))
something that's going to make you, make you be afraid to, uh, afraid of the
consequences. 

A.29:  Do you think, uh, you know, uh, lately they've had, oh in the last few
years, they've had some cases where women have killed abusive husbands.  Do you
think that they should be faced with the death penalty?

B.30:  Depends on the nature of the abuse, and I really don't, uh, you know that,
that's, it's something that's got to be evaluated on an individual case,

A.31:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.32:  # you # know, because, there's, there's really no excuse for abuse, but
then, there are other options, there are ways to get out. 

A.33:  It does happen, though, doesn't it?

B.34:  Yeah.  I mean, there, {pause} you would hope, but I guess it's really a,
it's easy to say, but, uh, you'd hope that someone in that situation would you
know, get out.  There are enough support groups, enough, you know, over the s-,
over the last decade or so, anyway, there's been --

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  -- you know, you don't have to kill your, uh, kill your husband because
he's beating you up all the time.  You can, can leave and have support, it's
not like you'd be stuck on the streets.

A.37:  Yeah, even in our small town of five thousand, we now have a crisis center
and it's been in existence for five years, so even in this area, where you
would think there might not be the help, uh, there is help for women who are
abused or children who are abused, or whatever, uh, I can't imagine, uh, a
mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children,
but I have a friend who's is a school teacher, and she has a nine year old
girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is
not protecting the child, which just makes your skin crawl to even think about
it but,

B.38:  This is almost as much of a crime, and I guess, I don't know, it's, to me
it's almost as much of a crime to just let it go. 

A.39:  Yes, yes,

B.40:  # And, uh, #

A.41:  # she's as # guilty as he is. 

B.42:  and I think, I guess it gets back to if, if, if a woman kills her husband
because he's been brutalizing her or her children, there's maybe more of a
reason, and it's not an irrational, you know, just a brutal crime for the sake
of, just, I don't know, without a conscience or something like, like some of
these. 

A.43:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.44:  That's kind of what I think what capital punishment should be for, is you
know, somebody that's just, you know, missing something upstairs or just goes
out and, you know, rapes and brutalizes a woman and turns around and does it
again. 

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  And it's like, there's just no excuse, you, there's no reason I should pay
for this person to spend the rest of his life in, in prison. 

A.47:  So you think our, our, uh, values have to come down to dollars and cents
[laughter]? 

B.48:  No, but I don't think, uh, I don't think it's right for somebody to, uh,
for me to, to, uh, pay for something.  I mean, the w-, the way it is right
now, the prisons are overcrowded,

A.49:  Yes. 

B.50:  and we're giving people that aren't going to change, we're just, we're just
housing them until they die. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  And if they've, you know, caused as much pain and suffering as they have,
for, for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance,

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  it j-, just doesn't seem, uh,

A.55:  I guess the most frightening thing to me, uh, you're probably young enough
that you've not aware of the Richard Speck case, uh, it happened in, uh, the
Chicago area, but it was certainly broadcast nationwide.  He broke into this,
uh, complex, uh, apartment complex and killed these seven nurses and every
once in awhile, you know, one of them did survive.  She crawled under a bed
and he missed her somehow.  And she did survive and she did identify him, and
there is no doubt that this is the man who did that.  And every once in awhile
he comes up for parole.

B.56:  Right. 

A.57:  And it's scary to think that some board is sitting there trying to decide
whether he is rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society
when these young twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three year old nurses are all
dead.  It just doesn't seem, he should, I think, have made that, his life
should have been sacrificed for what he took.  As you say, the punishment has
to fit the crime, doesn't it?

B.58:  Uh, it's just like, uh, back in California, the Charles Manson thing. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And of course, he'll never, I don't think he'll ever get out on parole,
just because it was so well publicized,

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  but, uh, you know, he comes up every so often. 

A.63:  Uh-huh.  Or Sirhan Sirhan and,

B.64:  Right. 

A.65:  Yeah.  Of course also believe in deportation but that's another subject,
isn't it [laughter]?

B.66:  Maybe they ought to have an island out in the middle of the ocean we can
drop them all off. 

A.67:  Take them back to Australia, the way the English used to do [laughter]. 

B.68:  Australia might not care for that these days. 

A.69:  I see.  They've gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that
[laughter]. 

B.70:  On an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off
[laughter].

A.71:  Yeah.  Nice talking to you. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  Bye-bye. 

B.74:  Alrighty, bye.
