=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, now, uh, the town I live in, uh, they started a recycling program
[breathing],  uh, in the certain small part of town, a little couple, neighb-,
neighborhoods, and they said that they were disappointed in the response that
people, they tried to promote it and everything, but I don't think the city
necessarily supported what the other than doing, uh,

B.2:  Just like roadside collection?

A.3:  Yeah.  I don't think they really, uh, encouraged it.  I don't think they
really, uh, made it well-known how to do it, uh, that's my perception.  But,

B.4:  Well, now down here we've got, you know, collection bins in the parks and
things, but there's no [breathing], you know, there's absolutely no
[breathing],

A.5:  Yeah, there used to be, uh, a big, uh, trash bin, several trash bins in
front of the Wal-Mart in town here that, uh, you could put plastic jugs on one
side and newspapers on another, and glass on the third, but, uh, that has been
taken away.  It's not there anymore, I mean that thing was always full because
people really brought stuff to it all the time.  And, uh, then they took it
away for no real reason that I can understand or I ever heard about.  And it's
not there anymore, and the only place to take things to recycle them is, like,
clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that? Very,

B.6:  # That's right.  #

A.7:  # Few people.  #

B.8:  Well, I've seen, you know, I've seen examples of, uh, communities where
they, they take the other, other approach, you know, you have to do it or
you're fined.

A.9:  Is that right?

B.10:  And, you know, I'm actually all for that.  I don't, I'm probably not the,
[breathing] best person for recycling, but I'll be damned if, you know, if
they, they didn't, uh, charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection
every month, I'd be sure and recycle.

A.11:  Yeah, how, how, how do,

B.12:  # I mean, it's not that much trouble.# 

A.13:  # they monitor that, though, I wonder.  #

B.14:  It's just different, different communities that pass the laws that say you
have to, have to recycle.  You have to, you have to, you know, on Mondays they
pick up glass, and on Tuesdays it's [breathing], you know, plastics or
whatever.  And if, if you don't, uh, if your garbage is just out there in a
bag and it's not sorted, you know, they mark you down and fine you for it.
Sh-, it's kind of like, it's the same principal when there's a drought, they
fine you for using water.  You know, they just --

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  -- you don't do what they say and, not that I promote over-, government or
anything, but, you know, the, the world's in bad enough state that, you know,
I, {pause} people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive.

A.17:  Yeah, it would definitely help, you known, even if they were to, uh, pay,
like for recycling aluminum or, uh, newspapers or whatever.  I mean, they used
to be that if you, well, like, grocery stores you buy, uh,

B.18:  # Yeah.  #

A.19:  # Pop, # and you had a deposit on the bottle.  You bring the bottle back,

B.20:  # Right.  #

A.21:  # you # get a nickel per bottle back, or whatever.  You know, that
encourages you not to throw it away.  You'd take it back and, and get your
money back.  Or at least exchange it for another bottle, if it's full, you
know.

B.22:  That's true. 

A.23:  Um, I haven't seen that done for a long time either. 

B.24:  Yeah, no deposit, no return. 

A.25:  Yeah.  Everything's no deposit, no return or else it's all plastic jugs
that you just pitch, you know, uh,

B.26:  I always listen to, uh, Karen DeNard the other night on the way home from
school, you know, she's got that talk show and, uh --

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  -- K R A.  And they were talking about, you know, a lot of the plastic
bottles you can't just throw all plastics together. 

A.29:  Is that right?

B.30:  And they were talking about, you know, you need legislation to, uh,
identify what kind of plastic it, this is.  So you know, you know, you know
what can be recycled as what.

A.31:  Um. 

B.32:  Because, you know, say shampoo bottles I think was the example they gave
there's no, they don't even give you any ind-, occasion of what kind of plastic
that is [breathing].  And you just can't throw that in with your,

A.33:  # Um.  #

B.34:  # two # liter Coke bottles or whatever. 

A.35:  I wasn't aware of that.  I thought they were more or less all the same. 

B.36:  Yeah.  So did I.  That's, that's, it was news to me too.  I thought it was
kind of interesting, though. 

A.37:  [Laughter] There needs to be legislation that they should all be the same
plastic [laughter]. 

B.38:  Yeah.  They, yeah, that or, you know, things need might be identified and
there needs to be a means, a convenient means for people to, to recycle.  I
know for me, now I've got to drive [breathing] a few miles down the road to do
it if I want to do it and,

A.39:  # Yeah.  #

B.40:  # a # lot of times, it's the difference between doing it or not doing it,
you know, is whether you can, like, take it out the back, like, stick it out in
the back [throat_clearing],  back alley for the guys to pick up when they do
or having to throw it in the back of your car. 

A.41:  Or, at least have, you know, a bunch of collection bins around the city.
You know, if they had one for every five thousand people, or, or two thousand
people, uh, you know, just scattered throughout the city, you know, who, who
wouldn't mind just, you know, why, going down that way anyway, just throw
things in the back of your car and,

B.42:  # Right, right.  #

A.43:  # and take # them down and throw it in there.  I mean, I think that would
be great.  I, I'd support that entirely, because [breathing], you know, as a
country we produce way too much garbage [laughter].  It's, it's,

B.44:  # Yeah, way too much. #

A.45:  # it's phenomenal.  #

B.46:  Well, I know, just as an individual, you know, I know how many times I haul
out a bag of trash and it's, like, incredible.  You multiply that times
everybody. 

A.47:  Oh, yeah. 

B.48:  You know, on my block and this city.  It's crazy. 

A.49:  Where I work, there, they have, uh, uh, recycled paper thing so you just,
you have two trash cans in your office.  One, one is,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # for # the regular, non recyclable trash,

B.52:  # Right.  You're T I, right? #

A.53:  # and paper, yeah.  #

B.54:  Yeah, yeah so am I. 

A.55:  Yeah, I think it's great.  I use it all the time.  You know, and I read
that the companies now save, like, what, fifteen thousand trees or whatever
because of that and I thought, that's great.

B.56:  Yeah, it is. 

A.57:  You know [breathing]. 

B.58:  I guess there's the other side of the issue that, uh, there need to be
facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods. 

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  And that was something they brought up on the show I listened to was, uh,
[breathing] you know, there's all kinds of, you know, recycled paper, but, you
know, nobody's wanting to use it. 

A.61:  Is that right?

B.62:  You know.  How many people are using, how many people do you know that use
recycled paper in the office. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  You know.  You can, you can buy your, your Moore's computer forms for your
computer paper or whatever.  You can buy it with regular paper or recycled, and
I'll guarantee you in my building I haven't seen recycled paper yet. 

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  So at the same time we're, we're doing all this effort to throw it a way
and recycle it, we ought to be working on the other end and paying the extra
dime on, on a dollar for that recycled stuff.

A.67:  I've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled plastics
[breathing]  and made it into, like, uh, plastic boards to build a house with
instead of making it out of wood lumber [breathing],  make it out of, out of
plastic boards. 

B.68:  Well, I think they actually do some of that but,

A.69:  # [Cough].  #

B.70:  # again, # it's the cost --

A.71:  Is that right?

B.72:  -- the cost of processing that it just, {pause} it intimidates people, you
know, it's easier to buy something that's, [breathing]  you know, the, the cost
of building is already,

A.73:  Once again, the bottom line counts [laughter]. 

B.74:  Yeah [breathing] for, it, it's easy to say, but for a lot of people to
do, you know, if you were building a house and you were going to spend, you
know, fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on materials because,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # you're, # you're going to, you're going to pay for, uh, (( )) technology
that's not mature yet,

A.77:  # Yeah, that's, that's a problem.  #

B.78:  # what are you going to # do? You know, you're going to spend twenty
thousand and,

A.79:  # And then write it off [laughter].  #

B.80:  # yeah, you, you're going to do # what you can. 

A.81:  That's right.  Well,

B.82:  # But, uh, #

A.83:  # that's about all # I have to say tonight [breathing]. 

B.84:  I was surprised, I thought this thing was shut down but I, 

A.85:  What's that?

B.86:  I thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down,

A.87:  # Yeah, so did I.  #

B.88:  # I was surprised to # get the call. 

A.89:  But I thought I'd try one more time and sure enough, it's okay. 

B.90:  Great. 

A.91:  Well, thanks for talking and, uh --

B.92:  All right. 

A.93:  -- see you later. 

B.94:  All right, bye.
