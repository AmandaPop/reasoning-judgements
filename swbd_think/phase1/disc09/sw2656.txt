===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, what type of music do you like?  

B.2:  Well, pretty much, uh, the thing I'm into mostly is new age. 

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, like Yani, um, oh, uh, Peter Barden, uh, gosh, there's just so many of
them I can't even, can't even name them all, Enya.  I just got a catalog just
now as a matter of fact, uh, actually my husband got it, uh, Lady Slipper
Catalog, and it's, it has music from a lot of women and it's got, uh, Enya in
it and Carol Nessin.  Have you ever heard of her?

A.5:  No, I have not.  What, what is the, the message, what is the underlying
theme of new, if heard of new age music but I don't, I wouldn't know how to
identify it?

B.6:  Well, actually most of the music that I listen to there's no theme, it's
instrumental.

A.7:  Oh, really.  

B.8:  Um, and I tend to like instrumental better, because there isn't that
underlying theme, there's no message to be get, gotten there, um, it's just
enjoying the melody.

A.9:  What,

B.10:  That's what I like about music.  

A.11:  Okay.  What separates that from something such as jazz music or, you know,

B.12:  Well, um, I guess you could tend to categorize some of the stuff like, I
like in, into jazz, uh, Jean Luc Ponty is, he's kinds of a, he's, he's jazz,
but he's kind of more of a contemporary type jazz.  He's got the, um, the
electric violin.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Um, my husband just said [laughter], before I switched to this other phone,
he said so you like the Dixie Dregs and that's is another one of my favorite
groups, but it's they're kind of in a group by themselves really.

A.15:  So,

B.16:  They're more, they're more like progressive.  

A.17:  Okay.  They're progressive in that it's just the s-, up beat tempo type or
instruments they use?

B.18:  Um, no.  Progressive music is more like they have real complex, um, uh,
rhythms and key, uh, key changes.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Um, it's, it's a more complex, it's, it's not your, your typical top forty
type that has, um, it'll, it'll be in a particular key or whatever, and i-, it
doesn't change.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  Um, progressive has a lot of different, um, I don't know.  It's, it's a lot
more complex.

A.23:  Okay.  What does this type of music have to do, like when I go to the
book store, and I see new age books, does this have anything to do with that?

B.24:  No, no.  That's really a lot of groups don't like to be called new age
because it's kind of a, a label --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- that, it, it kind of, kind of connotates the out of body experience like
the, um, Shirley MacLaine type thing --

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- and that's not it at all.  

A.29:  Okay.  

B.30:  It's, it's just a different type of music and I guess, um, I guess you
would really call it contemporary jazz.

A.31:  Okay, that's, that's good.  And is this becoming more widely available?

B.32:  I think so.  Um, do you ever listen to one oh six?  

A.33:  No.  

B.34:  Um, they play some of the stuff that I like, although, they've gotten t-,
they've gotten to a lot more into the saxophone stuff, and I don't really care
a whole lot for saxophone like, um, Kenny G.

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  He's okay, but, um, I like more of a variety and it seems like they are
playing all of this saxophone type music that, enough is enough [laughter],

A.37:  Yeah, so,  

B.38:  you can only handle so much of it.  

A.39:  so, you could label Kenny G as a new age?  

B.40:  Well, yeah he's kind of a new age.  

A.41:  Okay, I  was wondering,

B.42:  Kind of a jazz new age.  

A.43:  All right. 

B.44:  It kind of, kind of depends on how you look at it.  

A.45:  Okay, I, I've listened to one of his disks probably about a month ago.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  And,

B.48:  What did you think of it?  

A.49:  I thought it was talented.  I thought, you know, he's a you know, has
definitely a lot of talent, and I, I wouldn't buy it for myself,

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  but I was glad to listen to it.  

B.52:  Yeah,  

A.53:  You know I'd,

B.54:  I saw him in concert several years ago, and he is, puts on a really good
show,

A.55:  Seems like he does.  

B.56:  he really is incredibly talented.  

A.57:  Yeah, well, that's cool.  

B.58:  What, what, what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly?

A.59:  Um, I'm very, um, open.  I listen, 

B.60:  [Cough].

A.61:  to a little bit of anything.  I've got, I listen to rock and roll a lot,

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  when I was growing up.  So, a lot of the groups that have been well
established for a long time such as you know like Tom Petty or --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- you know, the Eagles.  I know most of their stuff and I continue to
purchase their latest releases as long as, you know, they don't sell out and
still stick within their, you know,

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  their certain style.  

B.68:  I, I like top, Tom Petty until he got to be kind of top fortyish.

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  Like his first two albums were really good.  

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  They're real, real, you know, nitty gritty down to the, I mean, real roots
of rock and roll, and I really liked that.  When he got to doing his, um, um,
didn't he do a, he did an album with, who was it, Stevie Nicks, I think.

A.73:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.74:  [Cough].

A.75:  They sang a couple of tracks on one of her albums.  

B.76:  And that was okay, but I liked his early stuff a lot better. 

A.77:  Yeah, I was really, I'm really impressed with his latest, THE, what was the
name of the latest album, I have it, it's, um, I like it, you know, it's,
you've got some top forty hits, and I'm sure, you know, he's geared to that
but there are some songs that are pretty cool on that, and, you know, with the
videos and stuff now coming out.

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  He may be softening up little bit but, you know, I still like his voice,
and, you know, he's not, you know, it's not that bad.  Um, I also like
Christian music a lot.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  I like um, I like orchestra, I like symphonies, classical music.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  Because,

B.84:  I like some classical except that I have a really hard time going to buy
it, because some of it is just really awful,

A.85:  [Laughter].

B.86:  and some of it is really good, and I don't know the good from the bad.

A.87:  Right.  You don't know until you listen to it.  

B.88:  [Cough].

A.89:  So, 

B.90:  Excuse me.  

A.91:  Yeah, unless you have someone that can loan it to you, 

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  or you go to the library and listen to it.  It's kind of hard just to,

B.94:  Yeah.  The one, one classical piece that I really do like is Vivaldi's Four
Seasons.

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  I really like that, and I like, I like some Beethoven.  

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Um, and that's really all that I've really sampled that I, why, I should
say, I, I have listened to some others that I like that I can't remember their
names offhand.  My husband makes all these tapes of all different artists and
I never know what I'm listening to [laughter],

A.99:  So,

B.100:  I just know that I like it.

A.101:  So, if you walk into your home,

B.102:  [Cough].

A.103:  then you stick something in, you're, you're not sure, what, what would
you stick in if you come home and just could you turn on a station or stick in
an album or disc?

B.104:  I'd, I'd probably put a C D on, and I would, I would probably, probably
most likely go to something new age.  I would probably [noise] Carol Nessin
or, um, or, Yani or somebody like that, um, once in a while I'll put on some
classical, um, [noise] sometimes, my husband has a whole variety of music, so
I really have a pretty much anything to choose from.

A.105:  Uh-huh.  Well,

B.106:  Um, I do like a lot of the older stuff too but we don't really have a lot
of the older stuff on C D, um, and that's pretty much all I listen to.

A.107:  Did you,  

B.108:  I, I hardly ever listen to the radio anymore.  

A.109:  did you say one oh six, 

B.110:  Yeah.  

A.111:  has the new age st-, 

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  Now, are, where do you live?  

B.114:  I live in Carrolton.  

A.115:  Okay.  We live, I live in Sherman, so I'm not sure, if, I'll,

B.116:  Oh, okay.  

A.117:  I can receive that station or not, but I will try, and I'll, you know,
listen for a while --

B.118:  Okay.  

A.119:  -- and see what it sounds like.  Stephanie, was it?  

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  Well, uh, thank you very much for talking, and, uh, maybe we'll get hooked
up again sometime.

B.122:  Okay, great.  

A.123:  All right. 

B.124:  Thank you. 

A.125:  Talk to you later.  

B.126:  Okay.  

A.127:  Bye. 

B.128:  Bye-bye.
