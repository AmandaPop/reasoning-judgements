REMARKS:        There was some static and a lot of talk-overs, but generally, 
the voices were clear.

============================================================================

A.1:  [Throat_clearing] Okay, Geri, uh, [lipsmack] could you tell me what, what
type of a house you have.

B.2:  [Breathing] Well, at the moment, I have a little vacation house back in the
woods.  And it's brick, and it has, it's pine paneled.

A.3:  Uh, [breathing] and it's a vacation home?

B.4:  Well, kind of, because it's temporary. 

A.5:  Oh, I see. 

B.6:  Okay.  And, it, but, if, you know, if you want to talk about other kinds of
homes, my hus-, uh, uh, son is a builder [breathing] in Oklahoma City, and he
was visiting a couple of weeks ago, so we went around to see all [breathing], 
uh, the homes that, how they build homes in Charlotte. 

A.7:  Okay, so --

B.8:  What kind of materials they use. 

A.9:  -- are you new to,

B.10:  # Yeah.  #

A.11:  # you're # new to Charlotte?

B.12:  [Breathing]  Kind of.  Originally from this area, uh, from, Virginia, uh,
area but,

A.13:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.14:  # yeah, but # moved here from Oklahoma City. 

A.15:  Uh, originally from Oklahoma City?

B.16:  Well no, but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma.  We're a mobile society
[laughter]. 

A.17:  [Laughter]  Wow, twenty years is a long time. 

B.18:  Yes, it is, to love it. 

A.19:  Uh, so yours is, your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the
area?

B.20:  [Breathing] In the immediate area, because we're in the county with the,
uh, [breathing] uh, farmers, kind of farmers.  They're about, you know, around
ninety already, eighty-nine or ninety, but their children have grown up and
they have built, then, more contemporary [breathing], or more, uh, kind of,
some ostentatious homes.

A.21:  Huh.  Okay. 

B.22:  But, all traditional.  They're, they're, uh, they're, some are contem-,
temporary, but mostly traditional. 

A.23:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh. 

B.24:  Well, how about your home. 

A.25:  [Breathing]  Uh --

B.26:  Are you interested in, uh,

A.27:  -- it's, uh, it's a salt box. 

B.28:  Oh, gosh. 

A.29:  It's a, it's a New England type, uh, I was born and brought up in the area
that, that I lived in, and it was very rural and there was nothing there but,
uh, [throat_clearing]  uh, farms. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  Uh, or orchards, one or the other --

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  -- you know, there was a lot of apple orchards, so, when we decided to
build, we built [breathing], uh, about thirteen years ago.  Uh, we looked for
a home and the things that we were seeing were [breathing], uh, not up to my
standards.  They were still building homes back then like they have for a
hundred and fifty years, you know, the very little insulation in the walls,

B.34:  # Yes, uh-huh.  #

A.35:  # and very # little insulation in the ceiling so,

B.36:  That doesn't work these days [breathing]. 

A.37:  Yeah, and it was, uh, {pause} it wasn't what we wanted --

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  -- so, we did some research, and I knew the land.  There's a lot of ledge
up here, so you have to be careful.  Uh, there's septic systems when there's
no, uh, uh, public sewer system.  There is water, however, so we picked out a
piece of land that we liked and bought it and then we decided to build, so,
we, we did a lot of research, like I said, and we [breathing], and we built a
typical New England salt box in the area and when we built, we were the first
home there.  There was, like, about [breathing] ten acres of oak forest around
us --

B.40:  Oh, my. 

A.41:  -- and it was absolutely gorgeous [breathing].  Uh, since then, however,
they've torn it all down, and we're surrounded by homes,

B.42:  # Yes.  #

A.43:  # you, # know, that's, that's another long story,

B.44:  # Yes.  #

A.45:  # but # [breathing].  We're the only typical New England home in the area. 
There's a lot of, there's an English Tudor right next to us, and there's, uh,
there's a Colonial, [breathing]  our street's on just a short street.  There's
only like six homes on it. 

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  [Breathing]  And there's, a, uh, an English colonial down on the corner. 
And the rest are raised ranches, and, you know --

B.48:  Yes. 

A.49:  -- the typical, uh, home [breathing].  But we built ours, uh, [lipsmack] we
made, uh, we did it ourselves, uh, I subbed the, uh, some rough plans out to
an architect to have him draw it up, and then I subbed out the things that I
couldn't do.  Like, I had a crew come in and frame it and I did the rest.

B.50:  Uh-huh, sure. 

A.51:  I did the inside, the wiring, the plumbing,

B.52:  # My goodness.  #

A.53:  # and, uh, # you know [breathing].  So we,

B.54:  # You are multi-talented.  #

A.55:  # built the walls, huh? #

B.56:  You are multi talented. 

A.57:  Uh, my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so,

B.58:  # Oh.  #

A.59:  # kind # of got used to it. 

B.60:  Uh-huh, sure. 

A.61:  And we did a lot of research. 

B.62:  Sure, well, if you were to do it, uh, again today, what would you have done
differently? Name things, say,

A.63:  Uh [lipsmack].  We made the kitchen a working kitchen.  I think I would
have made the kitchen, a, a lot bigger because both of us like to cook --

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  -- and right now a working kitchen is very efficient, but two people,

B.66:  # Is that like a galley kitchen? #

A.67:  # kind of get in each other's # way.  Yeah it's similar,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # to # a galley kitchen, yeah.  And we have, uh, uh, like a little dining
area off that.  We have a formal dining room. 

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  Uh, I've since added onto the house.  We've got, like, uh, uh, looks like
an old rustic, uh, log cabin on the inside [breathing].  Uh, it's all natural
wood.  The ceiling's pine, the walls are pine, you know.

B.72:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.73:  # It's, # uh, one of those type,

B.74:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.75:  # kick # around rooms [breathing].  And we put a greenhouse on it.  It was
designed to be heated by the sun. 

B.76:  Yes.  How does that work, in the winter?

A.77:  Uh, it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it. 

B.78:  Exac-, it burns it up.  I'm a plant, uh,

A.79:  # Yes.  #

B.80:  # former # plant person.  And, uh,

A.81:  # Oh, are you? #

B.82:  # business, uh-huh.  So, #

A.83:  Oh. 

B.84:  Uh, you know. 

A.85:  We raise orchids. 

B.86:  Oh, my. 

A.87:  Which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north, but it's a solar
greenhouse we put up. 

B.88:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.89:  You know, like the walls are six inches thick. 

B.90:  Well, do you not have shade (( )) so far?

A.91:  No, no, we used, uh, fiberglass. 

B.92:  Uh-huh, well,

A.93:  We're fac-, the, the greenhouse faces solar south. 

B.94:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.95:  And it's, it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between
it. 

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  So it's kind of opaque.  We don't use shading on it.  Uh, [lipsmack] but we
do have to, uh, have air, a lot of air movement, even in the wintertime.  It
can get, uh, brutally hot in there.  So the way it was designed was to, uh,
uh, I put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty-two ton of rock
with, with, uh, hot air piped through it [breathing],

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # and # all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it
back into the house. 

B.100:  Well, great. 

A.101:  So, it's, it's not bad, it's, it's, uh, [lipsmack] I'd like a little bit
warm land.  I'd like to go up further north. 

B.102:  Yeah. 

A.103:  And I'd like to, instead of having a salt box, I'd like to have it all on,
on, one floor. 

B.104:  Well, come south, and, uh, you will al-, you will be watching the azaleas
bloom, and go-, they are just about gone this time of the year [breathing]. 

A.105:  That's right.  You guys must, yeah because,

B.106:  # We're all, #

A.107:  # actually, the # winter hasn't been really bad. 

B.108:  No, uh-uh.  Everything's green.  All the leaves are out and all that.  So
it's pretty. 

A.109:  So you got your garden planted?

B.110:  My spinach [laughter]. 

A.111:  Yeah [laughter].  It's, it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm,
now. 

B.112:  Really. 

A.113:  We have trouble up here with, uh, uh,

B.114:  Well, for not summer crops, summer crops.  It's, uh, it's really not time
to plant okra.  Not quite.  The ground isn't warm enough but, uh [talking],

A.115:  # Yeah, no, I, uh,#

B.116:  # some of those, #

A.117:  I put down black plastic [lipsmack] to help heat it up,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # you # know,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # put # it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on
us. 

B.122:  Yeah, right.  Get that out early. 

A.123:  So we put it Swiss chard instead.  Yeah, so, anyhow that's what we've done
for our house.  We've left it all natural so there's no upkeep.  You know, it's
white cedar shingle,

B.124:  # Sure, yeah.  #

A.125:  # [Lipsmack] and # the trim is stained, so I don't have to go out and
scrape and paint because I figured when I got old and retire, I don't want to
be working, I don't be a slave to the home.

B.126:  No, no, you don't want to be on ladders, do you? [talking]  You don't want
to be on a ladder. 

A.127:  Right, right because that peek is twenty-eight feet high, and you come off
twenty-eight feet, and it hurts. 

B.128:  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  So,

B.130:  Well, it certainly has been enjoyable talking to you this morning. 

A.131:  Yes, you, too. 

B.132:  And, uh, hope to hear from you again sometime if they do that. 

A.133:  Okay, yeah. 

B.134:  Good-bye. 

A.135:  All right. 

B.136:  Thank you. 

A.137:  You take care, okay, bye-bye.
