==============================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead. 

B.2:  Well, I personally have had something I had to return recently.  A couple
of things, so.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And I didn't have a receipt, so, I was a little apprehensive heading into
it.  I really was.  Um, I had a pair of shoes that my daughter had, you know,
tried on in the store and she got home and wore them around and, she said these
just aren't comfortable, they hurt.  I said why didn't they hurt in the store
{said laughingly}.

A.5:  They never do. 

B.6:  And thank goodness she hadn't worn them out anywhere. 

A.7:  # Yeah.  #

B.8:  # She # hadn't taken them to school, or outside and so I took them back and
they were, they were very pleasant about it.  They, co-, you know, it was a
chain store,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.10:  # I # don't know if it's appropriate to say a name, but, you know, it
wasn't, uh, department store, it was just, uh, you know, lower class end of the
thing and, and they were, they were real decent about it. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  But I got the real impression that, uh, if I'd gotten another employee, I
could see her looking over, you know, if I'd gotten that gal, huh-uh, she would
not have, not have been nearly as polite about me not having a receipt. 

A.13:  Um. 

B.14:  But that was a low ticket item --

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  -- I, I don't think I've ever had to return a higher ticket item, {pause}
for a, for a long time. 

A.17:  I guess the biggest thing that I returned recently was, uh, uh, uh, car
se-, a baby seat, car seat,

B.18:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # that we # got, um, at a store and it was missing a piece.  There's a, a
clip that goes with them that, uh, I guess,

B.20:  Very important to the safety of the whole thing, I'm sure. 

A.21:  Yeah, for some seat belts or something you can't connect it without the
clip [throat_clearing] and it didn't have it.  So I, I bought it at one place
and I took it back to a different store an, and they took it without any
problem, gave me another one and I opened it up there, to make sure it was in
there before I,

B.22:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # before I # took it away. 

B.24:  Now when you say you returned it to a different store, did you take it just
to a different location of the same store, or just another,

A.25:  S-, same type, yeah, same type of store, it was just, uh, different
location. 

B.26:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, but it didn't, they didn't say well gee, this was only good
at,

A.27:  # No.  #

B.28:  # Did # you have your receipt?

A.29:  Yeah, in fact, the way he acted, it happened all the time, and, uh, my wife
was reading in CONSUMERS REPORTS, I think the week later,

B.30:  # [Child_talking].  #

A.31:  # about # the car seats and apparently that's a pretty st-, standard
practice that they only put those clips in, in about a third of the boxes
because not everybody needs them with the seat belts that they've got, so they
just don't bother to put them in in all of them. 

B.32:  Huh, that's interesting. 

A.33:  So they probably get a lot of that, you know. 

B.34:  Well and I suppose they, you know, they save pennies, I guess, but, you
know.  Now the question is, would you again go buy that same brand, would you
recommend that brand to somebody, [child_talking] or because of the
experience, would you just say, uh, don't fool with that brand it,

A.35:  Yeah, pr-, yeah, I think you're right, it's probably hurting, hurting that
brand not to do that, uh. 

B.36:  And it probably, you know, isn't.  Well I think one thing that's kind of a
change that I've noticed in the last few years, I think [child_talking] the,
uh, manufacturer reps are a lot more on site, than they used to be.

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  I think we went through a fe-, you know, that was the way it used to be in
the old days, and then we went through the days when, you know, maybe only,
uh, one buyer for a whole chain saw, um, a manufacturer's rep.  And if
something was broken or returned to the store or damaged merchandise the store
had to eat it more.

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  And then, w-, now we've come, you know, now it seems like they just send it
back.  You know, they have a lot more resources, you know, your, your larger
stores,

A.41:  # Yeah.  #

B.42:  # to # re-, regain their money if it comes back. 

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # You # know, because sometimes I'll say well, you know, uh, this is
damaged, you know, and but it was fixable, you know what I'm saying, it's
something you could bring home and repair. 

A.45:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # And you'd # be willing to do that repair if you got price off, if you got
mark down {pause} i-, item so that you could afford to go buy the glue or the
special thread it was going to take, or the patch or whatever, you know. 

A.47:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.48:  # And, # and say well mark it down and I'll, I'll buy it as it is, even if
it is damaged, because it's repairable,

A.49:  # Yeah.  #

B.50:  # And # they won't do it.  No, I can turn this back in and get full credit,
you know, from the, you know, the rep.  I, you know, I hear that, you know,
where you didn't use to hear that. 

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  But, well do you think that overall the, uh, goods are improving, or, or
decreasing in quality. 

A.53:  [Sigh] I guess it depends on what you're talking about [breathing].  I, I
think it de-, and it depends on the company too, how seriously they take their,

B.54:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # their # quality control and, and just customer relations.  I think
companies that think it's important to, to have a good product and take care of
the customer do a good job on both ends, you know, if there's a complaint they
take care of it right away because they don't want any bad P R and they do want
return business. 

B.56:  I think that American manufacturers are getting a lot more, uh, pressure to
compete in quality,

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.58:  # than # maybe we saw, you know, ten or twelve, fifteen years ago, that
they're, they're feeling the heat, you know, you see a lot of, you know, now,
uh, you know the ads that come out that'll say, you know, ninety percent of
our products, you know, made in the U S A, you know, that kind of thing.  We
buy, we buy [child] American so you can too, you know,

A.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.60:  # kind # of slogans. 

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  But, uh, so it must be a heightened, you know, awareness that way.  The,
uh, um, one thing, I, uh, well I jus-, I don't know how to say that
cohesively.  So [laughter] I'll pass on that thought until it comes back in my
head clearer.

A.63:  Okay {pause}. Yeah, I think that probably they're having to change some of
their strategies due to survival,

B.64:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # in a # lot of situations.  Uh, I think the car industry is a good example
of that. 

B.66:  [/Child]  Oh, certainly! You know, they, uh, Lee Iacocca, you know, made a
major, uh, plea, you know, I mean his, just his advertising strategy with
Chrysler,

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.68:  # you # know, has I think really made a lot of people rethink, are we being
patriotic if we don't buy.  We, uh, uh, I have a Girl Scout troop, not now but
we did in the couple of years ago, we, uh, we did an international kind of
merit badge activity and, one of the things we did, is we had everybody bring
from home at least five things from, that had been purchased or, you know, not
purchased but made in other countries.

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  I was surprised, I thought these girls, you know, won't be able to come up
with that many different things.  We had so many countries represented, it
just, it was really an eye opener for me.  Far more, probably than it was for
them.  But, it really, uh, really surprised me just to see the, the
difference.

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  You know and just a wide variety, wide, wide variety. 

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  And I thought we might be seeing things that, oh, you know, had come down
from their family or, grandfather and grandma went on a safari, or,
[breathing] you know, went to Europe, or something like that, but it wasn't.
It was just everyday kinds of things that you go to Skaggs or Target and buy,
you know,

A.75:  # Huh.  #

B.76:  # that, # came from, you know, Poland or China, or, you know, Finland or,
you know, just really, you know, Kenya, lots of different everyday kinds of,
you know,

A.77:  # Yeah.  #

B.78:  # items, # useful items.  Lots of different foods showed up that we
commonly purchase and don't even think about, you know, that they aren't
stateside grown.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, I worked in, uh, produce counter at Safeway, so I know
that,

B.80:  # Yeah, I be-, yeah, I bet you, #

A.81:  # there's a lot of things that are # brought in that are imported. 

B.82:  uh-huh, yeah, exactly. 

A.83:  So, yeah, we do that all the time. 

B.84:  I think, uh, one thing that's kind of, uh, thinking about quality that we
see differences now like are in the new homes.  You know, homes that are being
built.  They have so many more amenities offered,

A.85:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.86:  # that our # [child_talking] forefathers wouldn't have even crossed
their brains to have expected, you know, a dishwasher or a disposal, or, uh,
uh, track lighting, or garage door opener, you know, those ki-, the fancy
bathrooms and stuff and yet the sturdiness of them doesn't all,

A.87:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.88:  # doesn't # always measure up. 

A.89:  True, yeah, I think they're, they're trying to lower costs by cheapening in
a lot of areas. 

B.90:  And yet they have to put those things in because they're expected. 

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  You know, even young couples buying a home, they've lived in apartments
that provide those things so they just assume they'll be in a home.

A.93:  # Yeah, that's true.  #

B.94:  # [/Child_talking] [pounding] All # they expect, to you know, to be able
to, but it just wouldn't dawn on them to not have a microwave built in, in a
new home [laughter], that kind of thing.  And yet we probably, you know, we
pay for it in other ways by not,

A.95:  # Yeah.  #

B.96:  # [Child_talking] # you know, basic structure.  And yet technology is still
keeping up with the times too.  Well I think, I think we're probably going to
see a lot of changes in the next {pause} five years or so.  I think there's
technology out there right now, that's just on the e-, on the very, very edge,
