REMARKS:        I had a lot of difficulty with the name of specific
television shows and people on the shows that I didn't already know.  
Speaker B, female, spoke very quickly and ran words together.  Sort of 
an overall muffled quality that made it difficult to transcribe, but 
this may have been to the unknown subject matter.

==========================================================================

@A.1:  Well, I guess, uh, topic, uh, being favorite T V shows, I, uh, I guess I
could start by saying I'm looking forward to watching the astronomers on P B
S.

B.2:  Oh, yes. 

A.3:  And, uh, unfortunately they're have the annual (( )) like that they're
having the, a, uh, not telethon, but a, uh, auction --

B.4:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.5:  -- on P B S here. 

B.6:  I'd noticed that in the T V GUIDE, and I'd totally forgotten all about
that. 

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  Looks like it would be a good series. 

A.9:  Well, the first, uh, episode started out pretty slow [laughter],  but after
that it's obviously been preempted by the auction the last week or so.  So, it,
uh, I guess I'll never know. 

B.10:  [Laughter]. 

A.11:  But, uh, and you?

B.12:  Oh, I kind have a very wide range of, uh, different shows that I like.  I
mean, even the, what is it, AMERICA'S FUNNIEST VIDEOS --

A.13:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.14:  -- there's something about that, I don't know if it's the simplicity of it,
or just the total stupidity of it [laughter], 

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  that is good. 

A.17:  Well, it is enjoyable, I'll give you that, it's funny. 

B.18:  And, uh, I don't get to watch T V that often, or sit back and enjoy it.  I
have a nine month old.  So that occupies a lot of the time [laughter]. 

A.19:  I would imagine.  About the only time I usually preempt for, I think, like
Monday night, we usually watch a lot of T V because that's when MURPHY BROWN,
and, uh, and DESIGNING WOMEN, a lot of those shows are on.  We tend to wat-,
always catch those. 

B.20:  Yeah, those are good.  I like, uh, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT. 

A.21:  IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT. 

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  That's with Carroll O'Connor, yeah. 

B.24:  Right, uh, that, that's had some good episodes to it. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  And then plus, in the new course, you have to have at least one soap opera.

A.27:  Oh, okay. 

B.28:  Right, there, I mean, at least KNOT'S LANDING or something on that order. 

A.29:  Well I guess now that they've got rid of DALLAS, which we, uh, we tend to
watch religiously here, at least we're getting ready for the big final
episode.

B.30:  Right, I've been, uh, I tend to, I try to catch that every now and then. 

A.31:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.32:  I mean, you still catch up with it, you know, in a couple of weeks. 

A.33:  It's, it's funny how they're, now that the show's over, they're kind of
trying to complete all of these stories, in a very short period of time.  So
it's like you turn on and about eighty-seven things happen in an episode now. 

B.34:  Right, yeah, been trying to catch the last few weeks so I can see how it
ends. 

A.35:  Uh-huh.  I guess the only rumor I've heard that they had in the paper so
far is that, uh, the last episode is supposed to be like it's a wonderful life
for J R.

B.36:  Oh, no. 

A.37:  What life would have been like if you had not been born. 

B.38:  [Laughter]. 

A.39:  Something like that.  So, uh. 

B.40:  Should be interesting. 

A.41:  It's going to be funny, I think [laughter], 

B.42:  Right, lots of tongue in cheek. 

A.43:  Something tells me Larry Hagman going to milk this role at all it's worth. 

B.44:  Right.  He's, uh, with him producing that, it, it, he hasn't done a bad
job. 

A.45:  No, no, not at all, not at all.  That's true. 

B.46:  We, uh, sort of get a kick out of the SIMPSONS. 

A.47:  Oh.  Do, I, I very rarely, unfortunately it comes on a little early here,
and I someti-, usually I'm at work.  But they moved it to Thursdays, and I
guess that's what.  But, uh, yeah.  The few times that I've been able to see
it, it's, uh.  At first I didn't think so.

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  And when I first saw it, I haven't been able to see it very often, but when
I first saw it, I said, well, this looks like it's, it's going to, you know,
go over like a lead balloon.  It doesn't look like it's going to be good at
all.

B.50:  Right. 

A.51:  But the few times I've seen it, I guess it's something that grows on you. 

B.52:  It, it definitely grows on you.  And, you think that it's so far fetched,
you know, with the normal family life, that stuff.  But, every now and then
they'll surprise you and have a moral to it, and they do the right thing.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  The big thing I always hear about it, I guess at the beginning,
they always open it a little differently, where they all run to the sofa.

B.54:  Right, and, uh, the things that, uh, Bart will write on the, uh, chalk
board at school.

A.55:  Yeah, that's it, and then sometimes, you know, like one of the story, I
guess, the sofa wasn't even there, and they all just stood there and looked at
each other --

B.56:  Right. 

A.57:  -- and stuff like that.  So, I hear a lot about that.  And, uh, it's almost
up there with (( )), I guess is the big now with that is the guy with, uh, you
know, like Steve {slurring word over several pitches}, Steve Meister, and it's
like, wherever I go any more, I've got a chance not only to visit a few
companies and all that around here, and, uh, it's you walk into a lobby of
those places, it's like Ralph Ralph Meister {special pronunciation}.

B.58:  That's right, we do that a lot at work. 

A.59:  Yeah, so it's like that's something that's really, really taken off. 

B.60:  Right, you know, a lot of things come off of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE that --

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  -- get caught up into the normal everyday routine. 

A.63:  Right, right.  Because isn't that special, I guess, is the last one with
the church lady.

B.64:  Right, and, oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did?

A.65:  Oh, uh, (( )) something, but, uh,

B.66:  Oh, and, and I'm # real good at it too. #

A.67:  # Oh, what was that? #

B.68:  Well, no it's not in that special, well, anyway, but you know what I'm
saying. 

A.69:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.70:  Things will get picked up from it and, uh. 

A.71:  Uh-huh, you (( )) the regular conversation any more. 

B.72:  Right,

A.73:  And, uh. 

B.74:  Oh, yeah, T V is on constantly here, whenever we're at home. 

A.75:  Well, especially if you have a nine month, a nine month old.  How about,
have you watched the, the, what's that new show, BABY TALK, or the one with the
take off of WHO'S TALKING. 

B.76:  I've seen one of, one part of an episode. 

A.77:  I haven't seen of that, was it any good?

B.78:  It didn't do anything for me. 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  [Laughter]  We like LOOK WHO'S TALKING. 

A.81:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.82:  This just wasn't anything to me like it.  You know, wasn't it Bruce Willis
that did the voice. 

A.83:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.84:  But, there's just something with that. 

A.85:  I guess we're also looking forward to the, boy, it's terrible, I guess, we
watch so much television, but, uh, I guess the one other thing we're watching
for is L A LAW --

B.86:  Yes. 

A.87:  -- has the last couple, couple episodes coming up here. 

B.88:  Right, I've been catching that. 

A.89:  And, uh. 

B.90:  And that's real interesting. 

A.91:  I was never so wild when they got rid of the one, the one, uh, actress. 

B.92:  Yeah.  The one that fell down the,

A.93:  An elevator shaft.  That was, that was pretty funny [laughter].  It's like
we, we were all. 

B.94:  I was like, wait, I missed that, rewind there. 

A.95:  Yeah, it was like we were all sitting here going, What just happened?
[laughter] I'd say, if, if, if you weren't watching it was like boom, you
missed it, and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the
shaft going, you know, What happened.

B.96:  Right, right. 

A.97:  And now with all the lawyers, you know, rising in arms and going off to
join Michael, I guess, whoever.

B.98:  Uh-huh, It's quite, it's quite a, the last few episodes are going to be
good. 

A.99:  Yeah, matter of fact, uh, that going to be the same, DALLAS, and L A LAW
and a lot of these are really, I guess are really going for cliff hangers this
year.

B.100:  Right.  L A LAW'S getting rid of several of their characters. 

A.101:  That's what I heard.  I guess like Susan Dey, and a few of them are up for
contract renewal and they didn't do it, or something like that.

B.102:  Uh, I heard that they just wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the
same ones there forever.

A.103:  Yeah, because like,

B.104:  And so they would be bringing in new ones, or whatever. 

A.105:  It's pretty obvious, though, like Corbin Berenson is probably not going to
be there long because he's been starring in these, uh, mini series and his
part's gotten smaller and smaller, and they're bringing on the, uh, like the
British lawyer, who --

B.106:  Yes. 

A.107:  -- uh, I guess her and the blond district attorney, or --

B.108:  Yes. 

A.109:  -- went to teach that seminar to the Russian lawyers --

B.110:  At the swimming pool. 

A.111:  -- at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs.  You can see they're really
starting to build up their characters that they've down played, like Corbin
Berenson and a few of those, the top ones, Harry Hamlin, a lot of them. 

B.112:  Yeah, I know that those three were supposed to leave. 

A.113:  Okay. 

B.114:  And I don't remember about (( )),

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  I don't know if he's supposed to leave either or not. 

A.117:  Oh really.  Huh. 

B.118:  Are you out on the west coast?

A.119:  Oh, no I'm in the (( )) Texas. 

B.120:  Oh, you're in Texas, okay.  You mentioned the time, the time frame, and I
got confused there. 

A.121:  Oh, when the SIMPSONS are on?

B.122:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.123:  Yeah, because it guess it's on at seven o'clock on, on Thursdays. 

B.124:  Right, on Thursdays, yeah. 

A.125:  And sometimes I don't, uh, don't usually make it that, um, that late in the
week.  Usually by then I'm working a little later and later, it seems and
never get home to watch it.  But it was better when it was on Saturday.  I
didn't, uh, didn't have an excuse then.  But, uh, oh well.

B.126:  Yeah. 

A.127:  Well, I guess, uh, guess we've run out of T V shows, [laughter]  haven't
we. 

B.128:  We've covered a lot of them. 

A.129:  [Whistling] I guess, uh, we should, shows, we,

B.130:  Well, I enjoyed talking to you. 

A.131:  You too, Michelle.  You have a good evening. 

B.132:  You too. 

A.133:  Bye-bye. 

B.134:  Bye-bye.
