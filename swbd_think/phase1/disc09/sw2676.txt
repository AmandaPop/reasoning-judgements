==========================================================================

B.1:  Do you live in Plano or work in Plano, or both?

A.2:  Both. 

B.3:  Both, are you a T I -er?

A.4:  Yes. 

B.5:  Are you at work right now?

A.6:  Uh-huh. 

B.7:  So am I.  In building, which building?

A.8:  [Laughter]. 

B.9:  [Laughter]. 

A.10:  Well, are you Summit or are you, uh,

B.11:  # I'm, I'm, #

A.12:  # Spring Creek? #

B.13:  I'm Spring Creek. 

A.14:  Oh this is fun.  What building are you in?

B.15:  I'm building, uh, one. 

A.16:  Oh, I'm building two.  At least we found something different [laughter]. 
That's, I've never had a call,

B.17:  Not like that.  Neither have I. 

A.18:  No, isn't that funny? I usually get some place, I got a woman in New Jersey
the last time I called, I think. 

B.19:  Right.  That's funny. 

A.20:  That is funny.  So,

B.21:  So how's the build-, how's the weather in building two?

A.22:  The weather in building two is cold [laughter]  it's been cold.  It's been
cold in the building.  Outside the building it's not bad.  Typical T I, or T I,
listen I got me doing it.  Typical Texas Spring.  Are you a native to Texas?

B.23:  No, no, I'm, I'm a transplant. 

A.24:  From?

B.25:  From California. 

@A.26:  So what do you think of the Texas weather?

B.27:  Not as nice as California [laughter]. 

A.28:  How long have you been here?

B.29:  Oh, five years now. 

A.30:  Oh, okay. 

B.31:  I've been here long en-, pretty long.  So. 

A.32:  You, you, you know about August then. 

B.33:  Yes, oh, I've been through five of those [laughter]. 

A.34:  Okay, there's no surprises left. 

B.35:  Right, right.  A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks
in August, for, you know, if they're going to go out of state for vacation --

A.36:  Uh-huh. 

B.37:  -- that's the time to go. 

A.38:  Good idea. 

B.39:  [Laughter]. 

A.40:  Real good idea. 

B.41:  Yeah, we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.  And it
was like you know, eighty degrees up there.  It was beautiful.  Nice to get out
of Texas for a while. 

A.42:  We went to Alaska. 

B.43:  Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away. 

A.44:  That is really nice.  It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know. 

B.45:  Even in the Summer time, huh. 

A.46:  Yeah, or keep one handy. 

B.47:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.48:  Because it's, it rains a lot in Alaska. 

B.49:  Is that right?

A.50:  Uh, it, they call it their liquid gold. 

B.51:  Um. 

A.52:  But it, you know, you get sunshine, and it's lovely, and then it rains just
enough to keep everything nice --

B.53:  Green. 

A.54:  -- and moist and very green. 

B.55:  Um. 

A.56:  And blooming.  Oh my goodness, it's pretty. 

B.57:  Right. 

A.58:  Well, Texas isn't bad. 

B.59:  No, no. 

A.60:  Not in the Spring. 

B.61:  Right.  I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's
it supposed to like this time of year.

A.62:  Spring is nice. 

B.63:  Yeah.  Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, you know. 
It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, you know, on the local news. 

A.64:  Right. 

B.65:  March we typically get a lot of rain, and we've had this many inches, and,
you know, we're right on target, you know, and just seem like we were getting a
lot of rain in March, but I --

A.66:  Oh, we always --

B.67:  -- it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like. 

A.68:  -- we always do though. 

B.69:  Yeah --

A.70:  uh, it,

B.71:  -- I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once [laughter]. 

A.72:  That's right, and --

B.73:  And, and. 

A.74:  -- then we get all that heat.  Right. 

B.75:  Right.  Well, it's just that, you know, when it rains, it rains.  In
California you get these nice, lovely rains, you know, nothing really down-,
you know, like downpours like you have here.

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas. 

A.78:  Oh, really. 

B.79:  Yeah, I live in Garland. 

A.80:  Oh, you got into that bad stuff. 

B.81:  Yeah.  We got hail the size of marbles.  I mean, just so noisy hitting the
house and the glass on the windows.  It didn't break anything, but we went out
there afterwards and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn. 

A.82:  Isn't that strange. 

B.83:  I know, I, you pick them up, you know, and they're perfectly round.  And I
go, gee, how did they form, you know, so perfect like that. 

A.84:  I think that's one of the strange, strange things, and you very seldom see
it though. 

B.85:  Right, right.  I've seen hail, you know, but usually the size, you know,
of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.  You know, really small, you know.  But this was,
uh, really large.

A.86:  So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain
clouds apparently.  Is that correct?

B.87:  Uh, I don't know how hail is formed --

A.88:  I think, I think --

B.89:  -- to tell you the truth. 

A.90:  -- that's,

B.91:  You don't think it's cold enough, you know to,

A.92:  It's not on the ground, but --

B.93:  Right, must be. 

A.94:  -- in the clouds it is. 

B.95:  I guess, and then, I think, you know, all that falling would warm it up and
melt it, but maybe that's what rounds it, I don't know.  But, tumbling. 

A.96:  I was dumb.  I was in, um, Florida for a week on business. 

B.97:  Uh-huh. 

A.98:  And I had called back to the house.  I stayed the weekend, and I called
back to the house.  My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, [noise]
{high pitched trill} said something to the effect of, now we've made the
national news, don't get upset, and don't worry, it's in Garland where all the
bad weather is.  I said, Okay, you know --

B.99:  Uh-huh. 

A.100:  -- and I watched the news, and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not
Plano, I don't have anything to worry about.  I was on the plane heading back
to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland
[laughter].

B.101:  [Laughter]. 

A.102:  Felt so dumb. 

B.103:  Um. 

A.104:  Finally I got home and found out my property was okay. 

B.105:  Yeah. 

A.106:  There was no problem with it.  But I guess you just tend to think of, of
where your house is --

B.107:  Right. 

A.108:  -- you know, and nothing else. 

B.109:  Right, and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part
of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's,
there's the hard rain.

A.110:  Oh, oh, I see. 

B.111:  The creek overflows and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek
seem to, to get flooded --

A.112:  Oh, okay. 

B.113:  -- the streets and stuff around that area,

A.114:  # The house, that house, #

B.115:  # get a lot of # flooding. 

A.116:  that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course. 

B.117:  Okay. 

A.118:  Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going
through.

B.119:  Right.  That's where I live, close to that. 

A.120:  Oh really. 

B.121:  Yeah, uh, uh, not quite, I don't live in that Firewheel division.  But I
live close by there --

A.122:  Is that a nice area?

B.123:  -- in north, far north Garland.  Yeah they're supposed to, it's getting
built up, you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things.  You know,
it's a fairly new area.  Yeah and, uh, {pause} and they're supposed to be
building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or
ninety-four or something, a brand new mall --

A.124:  Well,

B.125:  -- not too far away from that area, so. 

A.126:  The house that --

B.127:  It'd be nice. 

A.128:  -- the house that I bought was really, really nice. 

B.129:  Uh-huh, in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever. 

A.130:  Yes, yes. 

B.131:  Uh-huh. 

A.132:  Really, really nice home, very pretty.  Uh. 

B.133:  Uh-huh.  But you're not living there right now. 

A.134:  No, I'm going to lease it. 

B.135:  Oh, I see. 

A.136:  It's, it's investment property. 

B.137:  I see. 

A.138:  But it is really, it's a very nice place.  Uh, I, I would cheerfully live
there.  Of course it's not my home, and I've lived in my home in, well, almost
ten years, and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it. 

B.139:  Right. 

A.140:  But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards. 
It's a nice house. 

B.141:  Uh-huh, yeah, that's a nice area.  Is it on the golf course?

A.142:  No, it's not, it's off the golf course, and I'll be honest with you, I'm
going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course
versus where my house is.

B.143:  Is that right. 

A.144:  But it's in the estates that adjoin it. 

B.145:  Yeah, right, right.  Well that's a nice area. 

A.146:  Yes, it is. 

B.147:  That really is a nice area.  When they get that highway finished, you can
hop on that and get anywhere you need to go --

A.148:  Yeah, that one nine --

B.149:  -- fairly quick. 

A.150:  -- that one ninety is just going to be the mo-, the outer-, outermost loop
around. 

B.151:  Right, another belt line, just, uh, farther out. 

A.152:  Right, just continue to do that. 

B.153:  Right, right, right. 

A.154:  Where are you from in California?

B.155:  Southern California. 

A.156:  San Diego?

B.157:  I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a ki-, younger, and L A
area, and my parents live in Anaheim right now.  Lived up north of Los Angeles
in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to
anyway. 

A.158:  I've been through all of that. 

B.159:  Yeah. 

A.160:  Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is
really an eerie, strange looking area --

B.161:  (( )).

A.162:  -- with boulders, I won-, they're not really hills, they're more like just
huge boulders with very little vegetation. 

B.163:  Huh.  I'm not familiar with what, is it along the coast or --

A.164:  Uh. 

B.165:  -- or inland. 

A.166:  Well, you know, it may be a little bit more inland.  That is one of the
strangest areas I have ever seen. 

B.167:  Um. 

A.168:  Uh, I had to go up to T I on business --

B.169:  Out there, uh-huh. 

A.170:  -- a couple years ago --

B.171:  Uh-huh. 

A.172:  -- and we went up that coastline, and I was just amazed how unusual that
looks. 

B.173:  Huh. 

A.174:  Here, hang on just a second, I've got a Los Angeles map.  Let me just quick
{pause}.

B.175:  Yeah, they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles. 

A.176:  (( )) valley. 

B.177:  (( )) valley. 

A.178:  Yes --

B.179:  Okay, I know where that is. 

A.180:  -- beyond Thousand Oaks. 

B.181:  I know where (( )) Valley is, I've been out there before, sure. 

A.182:  You don't think that's strange looking. 

B.183:  I didn't notice anything strange, I guess --

A.184:  Oh, okay --

B.185:  -- about it. 

A.186:  -- maybe, maybe I'm used to Texas. 

B.187:  Maybe Texas the way,

A.188:  The elevation is extremely high. 

B.189:  Uh-huh. 

A.190:  It's got curving roads on it, but, but the, it's just a strange landscape,
there's very little vegetation. 

B.191:  Huh.  I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it.  I know (( ))
Valley, yeah, it's just a suburb of L A. 

A.192:  Right.  It's a,

B.193:  And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately. 
People can get in and out of L A easier. 

A.194:  Maybe it's a place I went to, it was far extreme, thought we'd never find
the place. 

B.195:  Huh. 

A.196:  It was interesting. 

B.197:  Yeah, sounds interesting. 

A.198:  Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up --

B.199:  Right. 

A.200:  -- through that way. 

B.201:  Right, right.  I, I know exactly (( )) that area.  It's a nice area out
there.  I love Thousand Oaks.  Uh, Texas, I don't know, thing, things, you just
have less a variety, I guess.  I think, I don't think it's quite as green, you
know.  It's green with all the trees and things out here but it's just,

A.202:  Oh, it's green sometime. 

B.203:  Yeah, but it's just, you know, I don't know. 

A.204:  Well, it doesn't stay green, you know --

B.205:  Right. 

A.206:  -- the really, and in all honesty, I know this sounds like a Texas story,
all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here
five years.  We haven't had a --

B.207:  Yeah --

A.208:  -- really bad one,

B.209:  -- I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one --

A.210:  Oh. 

B.211:  -- that had the heat wave. 

A.212:  It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one and we
built a pool in eighty-two,
