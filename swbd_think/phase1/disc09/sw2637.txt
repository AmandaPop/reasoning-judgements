=============================================================================

A.1:  Do you have a recipe that you would like to share?

B.2:  Why don't you start first, and I'll think about it. 

A.3:  Okay, uh [laughter], we, I find that the nicest party for dinner, uh, uh,
group for a dinner party is eight people.  Uh, they set at my dining room table
easily, and it just seems like you can decorate a table, and, and you can serve
easily with eight people, uh, particularly if you're wanting to do the soup to
nuts thing, which, uh, with my dishes I have a really pretty soup tureen so I
like to start out with, you know, some kind of soup that nobody's had lately,
like sauerkraut soup or minestrone, depending upon what the menu theme is. 

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  But, one thing that I like to do, uh, of course, I always want to make it
easy on the cook, and, uh, the lady who is the manager of the country club gave
me a really good recipe for ham loaf that, it's something you can make up ahead
and then stick in the oven, you know. 

B.6:  # Yeah, uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # Aft-, after # your guests are here and you've started cocktails, really. 
Uh, us-, course you have to have some kind of entertainment too, and, and we do
play bridge.  My husband plays when I make him [laughter]. 

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  And, uh, w-, usually our friends, the women are the bridge players and the
men are there because it's an excuse to get together. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  But, I do find that i-, in order to have your party last beyond the dinner
table, there h-, there does have to be something to go on to, or you just kind
of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored, you know.  There's
got to be a, a silly game or a, something fun to do afterwards.

B.12:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I would say our dinners are probably more casual than that,
with, um, having kids and that kind of stuff.  It may be inviting, you know,
neighbors over for dinner, or something like that,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # but # not really, we haven't really tried a dinner party I guess. 

A.15:  You have more summer than we do, though. 

B.16:  Yeah, or a barbecue or something like that, yeah. 

A.17:  Yeah.  We can do that, well, starting the end of this, well, starting now
we can do that through October, but that's about it for us, and then we're
basically inside, you know,

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # even # if it's really warm during the day, at night it's going to cool
off and by the time you would get ready to eat you're going to want to be in.

B.20:  Right, yeah. 

A.21:  So, our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours
are, although it's certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun. 

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  Keeps the kids busy too [laughter]. 

A.25:  Right [laughter].  I,

B.26:  Gives the grown-ups a chance to, well like you said, play a game, or just
talk or something like that. 

A.27:  Yeah.  And I think outside you can just kind of kick back and, and visit
after dinner. 

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  But is seems like when you're inside, the first thing you know, someone has
turned on a T V, and that kind of is the end of your party, I think. 

B.30:  That's true, yeah. 

A.31:  What do you do, uh, for a barbecue when you cook out? What's your favorite
thing?

B.32:  Well I guess we i-, we lived in Kansas City for awhile, and it was kind of
fun to do Mexican food up there,

A.33:  # Yeah.  #

B.34:  # because # a lot of people didn't really, hadn't had it before, and I
know, um, we were going to make, um, fajitas one time, and (( )) [clicking]
the grocery stores, I mean, the people knew when I asked for the beef skirt
that you use to make it, they said, are you from Texas [laughter].

A.35:  Oh, I see [laughter].  Y-, --

B.36:  So, ((it's fun)) [clicking]. 

A.37:  -- you're even labeled by your food. 

B.38:  # Yeah.  #

A.39:  # How # do you do fajitas?

B.40:  Well, it, you can either use, we've always used, um, beef skirt steak, but
you can also use flank steak, and you marinate it.  The recipe I've used is you
marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of italian dressing.  And then you
either gr-,

A.41:  Eight ounce?

B.42:  Uh-huh.  And then you can either grill it or you can, um, broil it.  We
usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small, real thin pieces
and serve it on flour tortillas with,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # like # grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing.

A.45:  I've, I've, I love Mexican and I'm always doing the hot things, and I make
my own salsa and all that,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # and # it's really spicy, but I just haven't had the nerve to try fajitas.
How large a steak would you need to serve eight people?

B.48:  I think I was rea-, looking at this recipe, we're going to have some guests
in in a couple of weeks and they s-, recommend a pound for four people, I
think, three to four people.

A.49:  So I'd need two pounds, wouldn't I?

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # One # pound, four people.  And then, is that a fairly thick steak or,

B.52:  It, it's kind of a thin steak. 

A.53:  Oh. 

B.54:  And so it doesn't take very long to, to grill. 

A.55:  Uh-huh.  So when you, when you get it, you don't have your meat man cut it
to a certain width, you just take whatever you find. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  Okay, flank or skirt.  Okay [clicking].  Okay.  I'm g-, I've been wanting
to try that and I just haven't got the nerve up.  I do tacos and enchiladas,

B.58:  Yes, uh-huh. 

A.59:  and all that stuff, but, okay.  I ca-, a sixteen ounce can of beer, and
then you mix eight ounces of italian dressing with it.  Do you let the beer
get flat or,

B.60:  Well, you just, um, well I usually just put it like in a Pyrex pan, you
know.  I have an eight by, or a nine by thirteen pan I put it in there and I
pour it over the top and then you just, you know, turn it, leave it in there
for overnight or something, and turn it every once in awhile.

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  Maybe, I usually cover it with Saran wrap or something. 

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  And then [clicking], or start it in the morning and it's ready in the
evening to cook. 

A.65:  You know something I do when I marinate steak that you might think is
interesting, I have a Tupperware, uh, sealed or in a plastic sealed,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # and # then I just turn it over every once in awhile. 

B.68:  Oh.  Yeah. 

A.69:  And it saves, you know, it's just easy just to turn the whole dish over. 

B.70:  The whole, yeah. 

A.71:  The whole container over. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  Okay,

B.74:  That would make it nice and easy. 

A.75:  Yeah.  So you do grated cheese, and guacamole, okay. 

B.76:  And some people like sour cream.  And then you, like warm your, um, flour
tortillas up in the oven. 

A.77:  Uh-huh, okay.  Where did I write the part about the tortillas? Warm the
tortillas.

B.78:  I usually just wrap them up in foil or something like that,

A.79:  Yeah.  Okay. 

B.80:  and stick them in the oven for awhile.  In fact, as a wedding gift, we got
a tortilla warmer, but I don't think very many people have those [laughter].

A.81:  I see [laughter]. 

B.82:  And it doesn't hold very many tortillas, so we don't use that often. 

A.83:  Uh-huh.  I'm sure you'd probably, I mean the men would eat two and the
women would eat one, isn't that usually how that goes?

B.84:  Probably, yeah.  Because once you get the meat in there, it gets pretty
filling. 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  What about salsa? [clicking]  You can, or you c-, or you
just don't usually put salsa on it?

B.86:  Oh, you can, yeah.  I, I'm not into the hot, hot food.  My --

A.87:  I see [laughter]. 

B.88:  -- my husband is, but [laughter] I'm not so,

A.89:  Well, we have our children, all three live here, and our two married
daughters have three children between them who range from eight to three, and
every time they, and they always come here for every holiday it seems, and
birthdays and,

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # and # every time, we always have to start up with something really hot
and spicy as an hors d'oeuvres, and it gets to be, both our son-, sons-in-law
are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see
who can come up with the,

B.92:  The hottest [laughter]? 

A.93:  Right [laughter], the hottest, almost not eatable hors d'oeuvres,

B.94:  # Yeah [laughter].  #

A.95:  # to start # us out.  So, well, it's fun take, talking to you.  I'm going
to try fajitas.

B.96:  Oh well, good.  Well, it's nice talking to you.  Where do you live in
Indiana? I have some relatives that live up, um, near Terre Haute. 

A.97:  Well, we're way up the other end of the state. 

B.98:  # Oh, okay.  #

A.99:  # We're, uh, # half way between Chicago and Indianapolis on I sixty-five,
so, and Terre Haute is, you know, it's like three hours south. 

B.100:  Yeah.  Well, I know when we flew up there we flew into Indianapolis, and
then,

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  had to drive down there so,

A.103:  Yeah, this is a little town of five thousand.  Just a perfect little town
for us retired people and for raising children and,

B.104:  # Yeah.  #

A.105:  # you # know, you can go away for a week and you come home and say what
happened, and they say, oh nothing [laughter]. 

B.106:  [Laughter]. 

A.107:  So it's a pretty good spot.  Well, have a nice day. 

B.108:  Well, thank you, you too. 

A.109:  Bye bye. 

B.110:  Bye.
