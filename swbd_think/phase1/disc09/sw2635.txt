============================================================================

A.1:  Here we go.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  Okay, Janet, could you tell me what your thoughts are.

B.4:  Well I think the idea of public, uh, health services is a good one, I think
that we all, um, perhaps have a civic duty, but I don't know as though it
should be, uh, and I don't know if this, uh, was my interpretation was that
perhaps it should be, uh, like a forced thing.  Um, I think it should all be
voluntary as it is now.  But, um, I do agree that I think it is a good thing,
because I don't know how else a lot of these, um, things could happen if they
didn't have the volunteers to do it.

A.5:  Yeah, they, uh, um, the example they gave was like the Peace Corps.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Uh, I'm not so sure if I, I agree with that.  See, uh, {pause}  back in
Roosevelt's administration they had the C C C camps,

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  and I don't know about down in your area, but like up here they built
bridges and they built, uh, uh, waterways leading from reservoirs to
reservoirs to get to the city.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  In fact, in my area, it's, it's kind of a rural area and it's, and the
waterways are still in place, you know, they're, uh, they're beautiful.
They're all stone walled and it, it just leads from the reservoirs way up in
the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs.  Some of the bridges
are still standing too, I mean, some of them need repair now.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  But, because of the recession back then, or the depression, whatever you
want to call it, uh, there was a lot of people out of work so the government
brought them in, I mean, they, they performed a, a public service.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But yet they were paid for it too.

B.16:  Well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't
have any other resource. 

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  And, and, uh, I guess it, it served it's purpose, right.  Is that what it
was meant to do?  But as you say they were paid.  And, I'm not all that
familiar with the Peace Corps, although I have friends who have family members
that are in it and, um, they generally go abroad,

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  and, and, uh, serve but they don't get a salary.  And they give up, uh,
X number of years of their lives to do this.

A.21:  Yeah, but they must get some compensation somewhere. 

B.22:  Um, I know some people that just came back from South America and, uh,
they, they are degreed and once they got their degrees, they're a married
couple and they went off.  They got, uh, s-, they got some compensation but it
wasn't a whole lot.  

A.23:  Uh, wa-, was it like a sabbatical?

B.24:  Yeah, more like a sabbatical, I would imagine and, uh, I guess a lot of it
was a learning experience for them.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  I, I imagine it takes just different kinds of people.  And now they're, uh,
back in school.  So maybe they're people in the beginning that just want to
{pause} be in a constant learning environment, I, I don't know.

A.27:  Uh, yeah, like, yeah.

B.28:  But, uh,  

A.29:  Yeah I think, I think we need it in this country, um.

B.30:  Yes I, I agree, I, so mu-, so many of our things are going outside the
country to benefit other nations and okay, that's fine, but what about here,
you know.

A.31:  Right we're, uh, you know, we're supposedly on the leading edge of
technology which, uh, that can be disputed, I guess by a number of other
countries.  Um, I do now that our rapid transit system, uh, is in terrible
shape, I mean most areas of the country we don't have anything.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Where overseas, uh, they do.  Their rail lines, their, their, uh, els,
their subways are in much better condition than ours.  If we put, if we put a
force to work in this country building a network of rapid transit systems, you
know just from say, outlying districts of downtown, 

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  especially California where the, I saw a program on, uh, P B S last
night they're saying the average, the average speed on the California freeways
now, in southern California is thirty-six miles an hour and it's roughly, uh,
a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  And they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven
miles an hour.   

B.38:  I'll be-,

A.39:  That's, that's atrocious.

B.40:  You know, maybe we've, um, got a turn around here.  Maybe in the beginning
we thought it wasn't such  a good idea, but perhaps if we
instrumented it here in the U S, rather than taking all that manpower out of
the U S and providing a service for people to join here and do some good, we
could come up with some of those things.

A.41:  That's right.  We have, we have a lot of people that are in college and we
have a lot of people that, [throat_clearing] for one reason or another that,
that can't get into college.  Either they can't afford it or, or perhaps they
don't have the abilities --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- that's all more manpower and, and one of the ways where we're, we were
coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting
[throat_clearing] a semblance of an education.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  Now, the military's laying off.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Uh, I think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school
should at least get into some kind of a career program.  I mean, they can help
build the United States back up.

B.48:  That's, uh, that's a good thought.  Now see I hadn't thought about it that
way.  My first, uh, thought was when they mentioned that was to, people who go
abroad and do service abroad.  And perhaps,

A.49:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

B.50:  there might be, as you say, more of an effort here needed.

A.51:  And we've done, we've sent people abroad, and the people that do go abroad
are, are usually, um, college educated.

B.52:  Yes, that's true.

A.53:  They're taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them
which is, which is fine because in the long run if we educate those people and
we build up their economy, they're going to want to buy products that we make.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  S-, but I don't know if that, if that is really taken place like the
Philippines with, the, the massive corruption in there, I mean, a few people
got it and the rest of didn't.

B.56:  Yes.

A.57:  The Middle East, same thing, a few people got it and, and the rest of
them don't so, in theory if you build up their economies and help these
people, yes, it can work.  But the corruption at the top, I think, limits
that.

B.58:  I agree, it doesn't always work that way, the way it was intended.  And
then the people change in this country too, and not, and are not able to see
it through.

A.59:  [Throat_clearing]  Yeah.

B.60:  Our administration changes also so,

A.61:  Yeah, I'm, kind of, uh, a dreamer, I guess, I st-, I still believe in, we
could put this country back to work, we could bring the steel mills back in,
we could, we could build our own rails, we could, we could create all kinds of
jobs.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  If we just had the incentive, like, um, I'm not sure who started the
national highway system, 

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  you know, the, the freeways, I don't know if it was, if it was, if it was
Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them, the way they decided that yes
we're going to have, uh, ov-, I guess we've got some of the best roads in the
world.  We could do that too, I mean we could, we could get a national
program.  Kennedy had a national program to land, uh, uh, man on the moon.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  And we did it.  S-, I, I think if we, if we put our minds to it we can do
just about anything we want, yeah,

B.68:  I think I'm inclined,

A.69:  sounds like I'm on a soapbox [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter] But it's been interesting, it's been an interesting soapbox, so.

A.71:  Yeah, there's I jus-, I just remember how it used to be and it seems like
that,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  everything's just deteriorating.  You know, yo-, you can't go anywhere
without waiting in line, you can't, um,

B.74:  Now I thought that was just a sign of the times, we're all stressed out,
that's what they're trying to tell us, that, that we now get upset because we
have to wait in line, or wait in traffic, but in, in reality there's so much
more traffic and so many more lines and, really like you say something needs
to be done about that too.

A.75:  Yeah, it just seems to be a waste of time.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  I mean it takes, it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to
work.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  We're adding to the pollution in the, in the world, whether that's creating
the greenhouse effect or not, whether it is or not, uh, it's still being
debated.

B.80:  Apparently, uh, if we could get, like we were discussing, some people
involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries
maybe we could do some, some real good here, you know, and not take so long to
do it.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  I think it could happen.

A.83:  It could, the, the main thing is, um, like you said earlier in the
conversation, if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it, then we're
going to create all kinds of problems. 

B.84:  That's very true.

A.85:  But I don't see why we can't say that.  I don't see why we can't, you
know, you contribute, well, you don't go to school, well spend two years doing
something.  

B.86:  Or put these people that are in prison, yo-, kn-.

A.87:  We have a welfare system that [throat_clearing] is defeating itself because
they get more money from welfare than they can working at ordinary jobs.  

B.88:  That's very true.

A.89:  So what's the incentive for them to go to work.

B.90:  Yes, exactly.

A.91:  The prison population right that's, there's I don't know how many
millions of people now are incarcerated.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  Which is, uh, which is a huge drain on society.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  What do you do with those people?

B.96:  And supposedly we're, uh, reeducating them and putting them back out in
the public so give them some public service.

A.97:  Yeah, but are we really doing that, educating, I, I suppose some.

B.98:  I don't know, I, I suppose to somebody's way of thinking we are but, um,
I know that when they do get out the majority of them aren't able to find
jobs, are they, or get back into society.

A.99:  No,

B.100:  Because they have that stigmatism.

A.101:  [Throat_clearing] that's right and as much as you say yes, you know, I've
paid my debt to society, and all that, it's still there.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  And they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one
or the other, you know, you wou-, you just wouldn't look at those people.

B.104:  That's very true.  If you had, uh, uh, a public health organization in the
U S that took, and say a lot,
