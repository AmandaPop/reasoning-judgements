============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, I have two children and they're older now, but, um, I found it
very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for
stay while I thought school,

B.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.3:  # and, # um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say
till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take
care of them in a home and that's what I looked for and I was lucky enough to
find one right across from my school, and that worked. 

B.4:  Well, that's good. 

A.5:  Yeah, that worked out real well but when they got older I wanted them to be
in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they
started where they could learn to interact with kids and,

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # and # be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that
would prepare them for school also, ((it's real important)),

B.8:  # Yes, yeah.  #

A.9:  # that they # do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,

B.10:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.11:  # so # but I had, I have switched schools several times because I, di-, I
really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.  I wanted them to
learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age. 

B.12:  Yeah, I, um, that, that's, oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the
kids. 

A.13:  Yeah, for the sch-, for the kids. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  Yes. 

B.16:  We-, well, I'm just recently married. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  So I don't have any children. 

A.19:  Okay. 

B.20:  Though we plan on having them soon but I think, um, that I, that that's
probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh, I think, um, I'm lucky though
that, um, my wife [smack]  will probably not have to work while our children,

A.21:  # Oh.  #

B.22:  # are # under four,

A.23:  # Wonderful.  #

B.24:  # or # five.  Yeah, (( )) I'm a college professor,

A.25:  # Oh, #

B.26:  # so, #

A.27:  great. 

B.28:  and that's also, and it's nice for me because, um, [smack]  most of the
time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or
three days a week,

A.29:  # Um.  #

B.30:  # and # then one or two evenings,

A.31:  # Great.  #

B.32:  # so # that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um,
[smack]  there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days
that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night. 

A.33:  Oh that's, wonderful. 

B.34:  Yeah, so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,

A.35:  # Yeah.  #

B.36:  # I # think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible
schedules,

A.37:  # That's wonderful.  #

B.38:  # I can # even teach on Saturdays and,

A.39:  # Oh, #

B.40:  # and # things,

A.41:  great,

B.42:  like that.  Yeah, um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a
terrible time finding, uh, child care,

A.43:  # Right.  #

B.44:  # and # one of the things they made in, um,, uh, real they're number one
priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home
[smack]. 

A.45:  Oh, that's,

B.46:  # So, #

A.47:  # wonderful # too,

B.48:  they, um, um, my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,

A.49:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.50:  # so, # she is als-, I guess her most recent position after she returned
back to work, she applied for a director's position an-, and got it.  So, I
guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess and even though she took
off two years for, um, I guess four years all together,

A.51:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.52:  # it # would be three years, how old's ((Kayla)) three, yeah, I guess she
took off three years all together, um, [smack]  for cause I guess they have a
four year old, and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  so I guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go
back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to
come into their home. 

A.55:  Oh, that's wonderful. 

B.56:  Yeah, I think they were really lucky there, but I think they've lost this
woman she wi-, she will not continue. 

A.57:  Oh, dear. 

B.58:  And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from
school. 

A.59:  Sure, yeah. 

B.60:  [Smack]  So I don't know what they are going to do. 

A.61:  Oh, you know that's an ideal situation,

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # but # not many people can afford,

B.64:  # Yeah, I think,#

A.65:  # something like, #

B.66:  I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're,
um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is,

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.68:  # so # she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,

A.69:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.70:  # so # she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established
herself in a,

A.71:  # Sure.  #

B.72:  # profes-, # in a practice almost. 

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years and, and he got
himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about,
twenty sev-, twenty-six so by that time she was so well established, you know,

A.75:  # Right.  #

B.76:  # I # guess it made it a lot easier. 

A.77:  # Sure.  #

B.78:  # but, # uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,

A.79:  # Oh, I do to.  #

B.80:  # if you have that, # that professional occupation where you can change. 

A.81:  Oh, yeah,

B.82:  # Yeah.  #

A.83:  # but # they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that,
uh,

B.84:  # Yeah.  #

A.85:  # lucky, # uh,

B.86:  # That's right, that's true, yeah.  #

A.87:  # uh, because I'm a single # parent,

B.88:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.89:  # and # I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce,
um, when the children were small and so I, uh, was a teacher I, uh, still am
teacher,

B.90:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.91:  # and # it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that
was what I wanted,

B.92:  # Yep.  #

A.93:  # where # I could,

B.94:  # Yeah, definitely.  #

A.95:  # have piece # of mind and when I taught school and I knew my kids were
being taken,

B.96:  # Were safe.  #

A.97:  # care of.  #

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  Yeah, and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,

B.100:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.101:  # I # just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate
cookies and,

B.102:  # Yeah that, #

A.103:  # ((that's it)). #

B.104:  yeah, that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so
funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and
when, I guess when they're five,

A.105:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.106:  # and # sometimes they flunk kindergarten now. 

A.107:  Right. 

B.108:  They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know
their A B C -s and I think that's so funny because, um, [smack],  I don't, I
don't know if I want school's very important I'm an educator myself and my wife
teaches,

A.109:  # Sure.  #

B.110:  # and # I, it's a very important part of your life and I hope to read with
my kids, but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school.  At four,

A.111:  # Well.  #

B.112:  # or # three,

A.113:  # I agree with that.  #

B.114:  # you know, I can # see tha-, that when you make that point. 

A.115:  Well, the thing is,

B.116:  # Yeah.  #

A.117:  # I # teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't
never learn socially how to get along with other,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # children # and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting
along with the other kids but academically,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # because # they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in
their way,

B.122:  # Yep, uh-huh.  #

A.123:  # and so # I want my I wanted my children and they did learn to get, to get
along with other people. 

B.124:  Uh-huh, that's a really important point. 

A.125:  Yeah, and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults and I bet if we trace
back to their,

B.126:  # [Laughter].  #

A.127:  # early # childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to
play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with,

B.128:  # Yep.  #

A.129:  # people.  #

B.130:  I think that's really, that's important I, I've seen the same thing I, I
think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone ou-, or before I was
married I went out with a girl, [laughter], and you know, [laughter], um, boy,
after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some
deep set emotional problems.

A.131:  Uh-huh. 

B.132:  And I bet, and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know,
being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years
old,

A.133:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.134:  # and # never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful.  I bet you could
trace all the way back [laughter]. 

A.135:  I bet you could too,

B.136:  # Yeah.  #

A.137:  # because # it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other
people,

B.138:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.139:  # and # if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good
adults or,

B.140:  # That's true, yeah.  #

A.141:  # successful adults I # should say,

B.142:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.143:  # you # know, really but, uh, it is a big problem and you kno-, I have lot
of friends right now that, uh, have young children and they daily have problems
with, with whoever is taking care of the child,

B.144:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.145:  # or # they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either. 

B.146:  Yep, that's true.  Yeah, that's really true. 

A.147:  So you need, cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,
and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,

B.148:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.149:  # your # wife gets to stay home,

B.150:  # Yeah.  #

A.151:  # I # would have, have given anything if I would have been able,

B.152:  # Yeah, #

A.153:  # to # stay home with my children. 

B.154:  I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky. 

A.155:  Yeah, you. 

B.156:  Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a
flexible schedule. 

A.157:  Right. 

B.158:  Especial-, I teach a computer classes so,

A.159:  # Oh, great.  #

B.160:  # it's, it's # one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a
History or an English professor and I'm also, um, you know, they have
vocational type courses on weekends,

A.161:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.162:  # almost # everywhere,

A.163:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.164:  # and, # you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a
Saturday,

A.165:  # Oh, that's, #

B.166:  # which means, #

A.167:  wonderful. 

B.168:  that, you know, whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be
available three days during the week,

A.169:  # Oh, great.  #

B.170:  # you know, # so you be will home with your kids I you know it's really
funny is that I, [laughter],  I picked this career when I was in college
because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,

A.171:  # Um.  #

B.172:  # wanting # to spend more time with my children,

A.173:  # You're very wise.  #

B.174:  # because my dad # had very, um, nine to five type job,

A.175:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.176:  # with, # uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five
commute home, so, by the time he got home he was so tired and he was all rung
out from the day,

A.177:  # Sure.  #

B.178:  # and # I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing. 

A.179:  Sure. 

B.180:  You know, my mother I, I came from a family, tha-, that my mother stayed
home until we started school. 

A.181:  Uh-huh. 

B.182:  Um, and I, I don't, uh, it's funny I don't think she had to work until we
started school I think teenagers become much more expensive [laughter]. 

A.183:  Oh, don't they though that's what I have right now [laughter], 

B.184:  # [Laughter].  #

A.185:  # thirteen # and a sixteen year old. 

B.186:  It's probably costing you a fortune. 

A.187:  Oh it is,

B.188:  # [Laughter].  #

A.189:  # they # really are expensive, yeah. 

B.190:  My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the
insurance bill.

A.191:  Exactly. 

B.192:  Th-, um,

A.193:  Well, and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have
cars. 

B.194:  Oh. 

A.195:  So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,

B.196:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.197:  # so # that you know an older, older, older, [laughter], truck so I can
afford it,

B.198:  # Yeah.  #

A.199:  # but, # you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because ((
)) I for years just car,

B.200:  # Carpools, uh, #

A.201:  # drove in # carpools all over the place and,

B.202:  Yeah, my parents did a lot of that. 

A.203:  And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the
store, will you take his sister somewhere,

B.204:  # That's right.  #

A.205:  # something like # that. 

B.206:  Yep.  And just to save you trips to and from,

A.207:  # Right, exactly.  #

B.208:  # you know, # uh, ball games and athletic events,

A.209:  # Right.  #

B.210:  # and # activities at the school. 

A.211:  That's right. 

B.212:  Yeah, isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care and it
lasts along time. 

A.213:  It, [laughter] does for ever. 

B.214:  It, [laughter] it lasts a long time. 

A.215:  And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren, so
[laughter]. 

B.216:  [Laughter]. 

@@A.217:  It's not ending is it [laughter]?  You think we've talked a long, a long
enough time?

B.218:  Well, normally they come in, uh,

A.219:  Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this. 

B.220:  Oh, oh, cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us. 

A.221:  Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long. 

B.222:  Well, you don't have to but they,

A.223:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.224:  # they, # um, you go the length and sometimes if it's a very busy time
period you'll go about seven minutes. 

A.225:  Oh. 

B.226:  Depends on how old the tapes are at that time. 

A.227:  I see. 

B.228:  Uh-huh. 

A.229:  I see. 

B.230:  Yeah. 

A.231:  Are you from the, where are you from?

B.232:  This is Baltimore, Maryland. 

A.233:  Oh, my gosh, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas which is, which is outside of
Dallas. 

B.234:  Yeah, well, most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas. 

A.235:  Yeah because that's where T I is [laughter]. 

B.236:  Uh-huh, yeah, and I've discussed,

A.237:  # That makes sense.  #

B.238:  # I've discussed, um.  #
