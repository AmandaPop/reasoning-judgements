REMARKS:        The second time through speaker A started cutting out at the
end.  The third time through speaker B had some faint background noise in 
there but I was still able to hear okay.

============================================================================

A.1:  How did you all get tied up with this, uh, T I system?

B.2:  Oh, did you already dial one?

A.3:  Yeah, I just dial one. 

B.4:  ((So then your)) recording already?

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Okay, uh, we're supposed to be discussing our homes. 

A.7:  Yeah.  But wh-, what, uh, what did you, uh, are you with T I or how did you
get tied up with this?

@B.8:  Oh, it's a, uh, long story but, uh, let's discuss about our homes.  Um,
[throat_clearing],  what kind of home do you live in?

A.9:  Uh, I guess a typical home here is without a, uh, uh, basement, I guess
that's the classical, uh,

B.10:  Raised style?

A.11:  Yeah, uh,

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.13:  # we # have something here,

B.14:  # My parents live, huh? #

A.15:  # we have something here # you may not have up there which is a, well, we,
we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof.  I don't know if you had it,
when I first got here,

B.16:  Where did you got, get there from?

A.17:  From New Jersey. 

B.18:  ((I see)).

A.19:  Uh,

B.20:  I new you didn't have a Texas accent. 

A.21:  Right, no, I, I'm, my accent's gone, I've practiced a long time to get rid
of it, uh,

B.22:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.23:  # the, the wood shingle roofs are # phasing out here, they're very, they're
good for air-conditioning, you know,

B.24:  # I hear you.  #

A.25:  # they, they, it's, # you, it's very shocking when you look inside the
attic and, on a dry day and see a hundred little or thousands of little light
wholes, you know.

B.26:  [Laughter] I would imagine so. 

A.27:  It, it's very strange and then when, of course, when it rains then it, then
it, then it stretches,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # and # does a pretty good job,

B.30:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # but, uh, the, the # fire hazard has, is, phasing,

B.32:  # Uh-huh, I would imagine.  #

A.33:  # that kind of construction # out it, it's so,

B.34:  So, what kind of home do you live in?

A.35:  Oh, it's a rent, it's a multistory, uh, last year, uh, luckily,

B.36:  Oh, a colonial style? Two story,

A.37:  No, colonial is not the word had they use here, uh, that's,

B.38:  Multistory is what they call them?

A.39:  A multilevel, it's called multilevel. 

B.40:  Okay. 

A.41:  ((It is not)), it's not really that typical it's a custom home. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  Uh, I live in Arlington actually this, I'm working tonight actually in
Dallas, uh,

B.44:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.45:  # at T # I here. 

B.46:  Oh, you work at T I?

A.47:  Oh, yeah. 

B.48:  So, that's how you got hooked up to this. 

A.49:  Oh, yeah. 

B.50:  You know, you know, you can converse with the person for a while and get to
know them before you punch the one, you don't have to get started on the
conversation right away. 

A.51:  Oh, yeah, your right, your right. 

B.52:  Well, anyway, um, well, uh,

A.53:  How many calls have you made, uh, have you,

B.54:  Oh, I don't know several, eleven, twelve, thirteen I guess. 

A.55:  Oh, really, everyone, everyone's higher than I am. 

B.56:  Well, I haven't made the calls mostly I've just, uh, I answered them.  I
live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland. 

A.57:  Yeah, that, that, I ((ought)) to know those words from the east when I was
there but that, they don't use that word here.

B.58:  Yeah, well, most the homes here are two story because, uh, they stack them
up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where I
am.

A.59:  Do you have a basement?

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  Oh, yeah, that's typical up there to, you know. 

B.62:  Yeah, well, like I say, the land here and, depending on where you are and
how crowded it is, the land ((bays)) go up and here a little old measly quarter
of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some
odd thousand depending on where it is. 

A.63:  Oh, yeah, no, the land is much cheaper here. 

B.64:  And if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which, I guess, maybe I'm in a
fairly middle-class subdivision, then, the general trend is to put as much
house as you can on a quarter acre, it took me a long time to get used to it
coming from down south up here, big, big houses on little bitty postage stamp
lots.

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  But, uh, that's the general way they, uh, they build them here so you get
about a twenty-two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on
whether you include the basement or not. 

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  Uh, [throat_clearing]  on about a quarter of an acre or less, about ten
thousand square feet. 

A.69:  Yeah, the lots aren't very big here either in the Dallas, uh, Fort Worth
area,

B.70:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # uh, but # the basement, there just aren't any basements, I don't know of
anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here. 

B.72:  Uh-huh.  Well, they use slab foundations or do they use rock foundations or
the little, # crawl space? #

A.73:  # Uh, it # used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and, and
the first, you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's
phased out in the last twenty-five years where it's all slab.

B.74:  Okay, slabs are easier and quicker to pour and,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # lay, # I guess. 

A.77:  And, uh, th-, they say that the, the reason they don't put pier, I think
it's cheaper like you say, but, uh, the soil does move a lot here and they say
that you just couldn't, uh,

B.78:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.79:  # put a basement # in the soil but I'd think they just, to me I don't know
really know why it wouldn't work, I think you can put a basement in anywhere,
it's just not, not popular. 

B.80:  I see, (( )) to dig out for it. 

A.81:  Yeah, really. 

B.82:  Do you have high-water tables?

A.83:  No, no, it's not very high.  Some of the water here,

B.84:  So, it's just a matter, they just don't do it. 

A.85:  Yeah, this is Dallas,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # there # the water's down two thousand feet. 

B.88:  Well, of course, down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a
premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out. 

A.89:  Yeah, I guess, it's the style.  I really don't have an answer here because
of the tornado I always thought tornados, uh, I thought people would build a
lot of storm cellars, you know, or shelters, you know.

B.90:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.91:  But even that is not, uh, popular at all.  I don't know, I don't know of
anyone doing that, uh,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # uh, # I don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that
they have storm cellars or anything.  They just,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # don't # have them, period. 

B.96:  I understand, well, uh, you say you live in a ranch style house yourself?

A.97:  Yeah, it's, it's multilevel, yeah.  Like my garage,

B.98:  # Well, now, #

A.99:  # I have, # uh, uh, a bedroom over,

B.100:  is it like a split level?

A.101:  Split level, yeah. 

B.102:  In other words, you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area,

A.103:  # Right.  #

B.104:  # and # then the main room bathroom ((area)) is halfway between both,

A.105:  # Right, exactly.  #

B.106:  # you go # down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there,

A.107:  # Right.  #

B.108:  # and # you go up the steps to your bedroom. 

A.109:  Right, right. 

B.110:  Okay, that's what they call a split level up here.  And a split four is
where all the steps are at the entrance way.  If you know,

A.111:  # Yeah.  #

B.112:  # what # I mean. 

A.113:  Yeah. 

B.114:  That's a split foyer type and then, uh, a colonial is where they stack it
on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the
first floor like, uh, a family room or, uh, you ((know)) something like that
and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a, a kitchen with a
possible little eat in area or something like that [throat_clearing].

A.115:  What's your typical heating up there in Maryland, gas or,

B.116:  Well, uh, y-, ha, I've been through two or three different things of them,
first house I came up here had gas heat with electric stove,

A.117:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.118:  # then # the second house I owned had gas heat and gas stove and, uh, um,
even gas water heater whereas my previous home, it had electric water heater,

A.119:  # Yeah.  #

B.120:  # anyway # and then the house I'm in now is all, uh, electric, it even has
a heat pump.

A.121:  Oh, really?

B.122:  Yeah, and, uh,

A.123:  Well, heat pumps nice, up there it would probably work pretty well. 

B.124:  Well, heat pumps do work pretty well up here, it's taking them a few years
to get the bugs out of them but, uh,

A.125:  # Yeah, that's true.  #

B.126:  # they, they finally # seem to work quite well, and I would imagine down
where you all live heat pumps will work quite well, or maybe down there all you
need is just air-conditioning, # that's all.  #

A.127:  # Well, they # should, yeah, because, it's warmer in the winter or you have
less of a winter down here, of course,

B.128:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.129:  # it's a # short winter, but it does get down to five degrees, uh,
occasionally. 

B.130:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.131:  But, uh, I don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet I guess,
uh, I don't, I haven't been that close to it in the newer homes.

B.132:  Well, I would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning. 

A.133:  Yeah, we, we have heat, uh, some have air-conditioning ((units)) I, I,
((I'm having)) an all electric house but, uh,

B.134:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.135:  # it's # fifty, fifty.  There's a lot of gas houses here, uh, because it's
so popular. 

B.136:  Oh, that's right you're, you're in the oil state so I would imagine there's
plenty of gas around so,

A.137:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.138:  # that's the # way to go for heat. 

A.139:  People I think,

B.140:  # Yeah [throat_clearing].  #

A.141:  # probably prefer # natural gas for, for heating, uh,

B.142:  Uh-huh.  I would too because me, I like gas heat.  I love it. 

A.143:  I don't, I'm an engineer and I don't like the danger of it.  I've seen too
many houses here blowup and I think,

B.144:  # Oh, really? #

A.145:  # yeah, and # I just think, when I ha-, I had, uh, a gas, uh, uh,
fireplace, you know, I had, and I saw the way it was construct-,

B.146:  Uh-huh, gas logs?

A.147:  yeah, 

B.148:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.149:  # it # went over my daughter's bedrooms, you know, over the garage I
thought, and there's, there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and
so I just disconnect-, I never did hook that sucker up.

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  So I just took it out completely, although people love gas here but I, I'm
ultraconservative,

B.152:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.153:  # on safety and # I just don't,

B.154:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.155:  # don't # want it. 

B.156:  Well, I don't mind electric heating and them, like it's okay, I mean, I, I
like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking I, I
just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy. 

A.157:  Yeah, well, I've heard peop-,

B.158:  # You just can't beat cooking on gas.  #

A.159:  # yeah, I've heard people say that.  I, # I,

B.160:  That flame, man, is hard to beat,

A.161:  # Yeah.  #

B.162:  # because # you can regulate it and, I mean, you, you want to turn the
flame down on the stove, you turn it down right now, you don't have to wait,

A.163:  # Yeah.  #

B.164:  # for # a cool down time which you have to rely on with, uh, conventional
stove or, or a warm-up time, I mean, it's instantly there. 

A.165:  Right. 

B.166:  And that kind of response is quite, uh, quite effective I think for
cooking. 

A.167:  Oh, yeah, no, I, I've I've known people love it for years and, uh, but, uh,
we've done without it for twenty years here and, and, uh,

B.168:  Yeah.  Well, I've done without it too but I sure prefer it, my wife does
too.  Yeah [throat_clearing]. 

A.169:  Yeah, yeah.  No, I, I haven't, I haven't really noticed, uh, I don't miss
it, you know, with our, of course, I'm against, I'm just,

B.170:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.171:  # I'm one of # the, a million people that, uh, is against, uh, gas. 

B.172:  Well, do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much
like, just a front,

A.173:  # No.  #

B.174:  # door # and that's it. 

A.175:  No, there's not much in front, there's no sitting out front, you know,

B.176:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.177:  # there's # no, like, like in the east when I was young,

B.178:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.179:  # of course, # it goes way back, we used to sit out front, I ((have)) a
porch up front but no there's not a porch.

B.180:  Yeah, aren't they nice?

A.181:  Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. 

B.182:  They're sort of coming back up here in the east. 

A.183:  I, I, I wish I had that, you know. 

B.184:  Front porches are, they're not very big but they're kind of coming back. 

A.185:  Right.  I, I think the old ways in a lot of, uh, ways should come back, uh,

B.186:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.187:  # but no # the,

B.188:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  But I really love a screened in porch outback, man, I just
eat that up. 

A.189:  Yeah, no, that, there, it's not popular here either. 

B.190:  Huh. 

A.191:  Screens in, screen in is not, that, that's so, that's, uh,

B.192:  Well, don't you all have mosquitoes down there?

A.193:  Not like, not like you have up there, no. 

B.194:  Really?

A.195:  It's too dry, it's so dry that it's, uh,

B.196:  That's surprising. 

A.197:  Dallas is super dry. 

B.198:  How far are you guys from the coast down there where, uh, uh, what is it,
uh,

A.199:  Uh, three hundred miles. 

B.200:  Oh, are you?

A.201:  Yeah. 

B.202:  That's a pretty good piece then. 

A.203:  Yeah. 

B.204:  I didn't know you were that far inland, I knew it was a ways but,

A.205:  Our, our weather is like, we have a, we have a the wa-, raining season is,
now, is April,

B.206:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.207:  # and a little bit # of May an then it goes into super dry all summer then
you summer with a hurricane season.  But,

B.208:  [Throat_clearing]  Well, tell me, uh, do your homes down there pretty much
have garage disposals and things like that?

A.209:  Yeah, yeah, they have everything. 

B.210:  They do? Are you all septic or you all have public sewage?

A.211:  No, public, there's essentially,

B.212:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.213:  # no # septic, not in Dallas Fort Worth though you have it in the out lying
areas but, uh,

B.214:  Oh, they use one and two car garages or just one,

A.215:  # Two.  #

B.216:  # car # garages or carports?

A.217:  Two.  No, not carports, uh, it's essentially garages. 

B.218:  Okay, so, they do go garage, because I lived down south for a long time
carports were real popular in certain areas where I used to live. 

A.219:  Yeah.  No, Dallas, uh, Fort Worth is, you know, the two car garage and
certainly all air-conditioned, and,

B.220:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh. #

A.221:  # uh, #

B.222:  # About how much floor space? #

A.223:  # uh, uh, two thousand square # feet is probably, I don't know if that's
average or not,

B.224:  Yeah, that sounds about average I think all over the country. 

A.225:  Yeah, uh, I, I think so too. 

B.226:  Yeah. 

A.227:  There's a lot of swimming pools here, I don't have one. 

B.228:  Oh, really?

A.229:  Uh,

B.230:  I don't either.  I hate to clean the rascals, I had a,

A.231:  [Laughter]. 

B.232:  I had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those,
