REMARKS:        Caller A dominated the mid to latter part of the conversation, 
and also talked very fast at times.

=============================================================================

A.1:  There we go.

@B.2:  Okay, music.

A.3:  Yeah.  Um, [clicking] I like, um, a lot of different things so,

B.4:  Yeah, so do I.

A.5:  Um, I'm into, got a big record collection, and, uh, mos-, mostly rock, but
I got some folk and some jazz.

B.6:  I have everything from Frank Sinatra to the Sex Pistols.

A.7:  Yeah, okay, that's, uh, 

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Tha-, that covers a pretty wide range right there.

B.10:  It's a pretty weird thing.  

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  I was pretty bummed when they had C D -s come out, though.

A.13:  Um? [clicking] Well, yeah, I mean, you can get C D's of the Sex Pistols,
which, um, I think kind of defeats,

B.14:  [Laughter].  

A.15:  I mean, somebody's missing the point [laughter].

B.16:  Right [laughter].  Well, I've got four hundred and fifty records, and it's
like, oh [laughter].

A.17:  Well, I have, um, {pause}, I kn-, I don't know what the exact count is, but
I know it is like eight hundred to nine hundred --

B.18:  [Gasp] Wow!

A.19:  -- albums, and um, yeah, I, I got a C D player about four or five years
ago, and I've been buying C D's, but, um, you know, I'm not trying to, I'm not
trying to go L P to C D, because, well, for a couple of reasons, one is I
can't afford it.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  And, um, the other is, some of the stuff that, um, I've got a, and I'll
never find on C D, it'll never be reissued.

B.22:  Yeah, no.

A.23:  A-, and, and there's a bunch of stuff that I really, really don't care if I
have it on C D.

B.24:  Right, right.  I've got a pretty good David Bowie collection.

A.25:  Oh.  You're, you're a big Bowie fan or,

B.26:  Uh, yeah, used to be.  I mean, I, I still like him a lot, but he's, he's
gotten so kind of weird [laughter].  In that he was truly weird before, and
now he's just kind of middle of the road [laughter].

A.27:  Yeah, I was just kind of, well, [laughter] styles change, and you get, it's
like, oh Dave Bowie's not weird anymore, I'll get, uh,

B.28:  Yeah, he's marrying that model, and [clicking] I don't know.

A.29:  He married a model?  I didn't know that.

B.30:  Tha-, Iman?  That Black model, she's about twenty-two years old.  I think
they're supposed to get married, I know he's been everywhere with her.

A.31:  Um, I haven't been, I been, uh, I got to pay attent-,

B.32:  Staying up with PEOPLE magazine?

A.33:  Um?

B.34:  [Laughter] You haven't been staying up with PEOPLE magazine?

A.35:  No, man, you know, just got the new issue of ROLLING STONE, and they didn't
mention it so,

B.36:  Uh, every so often he's on the s-, society page, as it were, with a picture
of her.

A.37:  It seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in PEOPLE magazine.
It's jus-, like, wait a minute [laughter].

B.38:  It, yeah.

A.39:  I mean,

B.40:  It's wrong [laughter].

A.41:  You know, it's like, uh, okay, New Kids On the Block, alright, these are,
you know, these aren't serious people, anyway.

B.42:  Right, right.

A.43:  But, Bowie?

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  I mean, I'm not, I'm not a huge Bowie fan, but I like his music.  Actually,
the, the coolest Bowie thing that, o-, o-, o-, one of the coolest things I
have happens to be a Bowie item.  It's a, um, um, it's a picture disk, with,
uh, of him and Bing Crosby doing PEACE ON EARTH, uh, LITTLE DRUMMER BOY.

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  And, you know, you can get this as a forty-five, but this is like a twelve
inch with, um, the, um, the label is instead of being a real label is a
picture of him and Bing from the, uh, from the Christmas special that it was
from.

B.48:  How funny.

A.49:  It's, it's a trip, um.

B.50:  Oh, that's great.

A.51:  Yeah.  You can get, uh, you know, if you can ge-, actually buy the
forty-five, it's usually out around Christmas time, because it's, it's, it's a
really neat song, actually, and they d-, they do a good duet, um, but it's,
it's always the thing that's like, oh, you know, you know, when I got people
over and we're trying to, you know, you know, a-, you know, #weirding,#

B.52:  #One up,# yeah.

A.53:  people out on music that one usually gets them [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter] Um, I got, I've got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff,

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  which I kind of treasure, and, his old records and stuff, and I remember
when I was in high school, you know, combing record stores anytime I could get
the chance, uh, for something of his.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And now it all seems for naught, you know?  You can get his old stuff on C
D [laughter].

A.59:  Yeah. Huh.

B.60:  It's like, what were all those hours, those little treasures I have, but I
have originals, you know [laughter].

A.61:  Uh-huh.  Well I know the feeling, when I've gone, um, and just knocked
myself out, um, I'm a big Who fan,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  and I've gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty-fives
with like these B sides that never got put on an album.

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  You know I was knocking mys-, you know I found these, a bunch of them,
you know, didn't spend a whole lot of money on them,

B.66:  Right,

A.67:  Um,

B.68:  but, uh, finding them was [laughter] #the effort.#

A.69:  # Yeah, yeah, it was a # big ((thing)), well, I got, I have a friend who's
like, the forty five king of the world.  He has, something along the lines of
fifteen thousand forty-fives.

B.70:  [Gasp].

A.71:  He has every top forty single since he was born, nineteen, you know, like
nineteen sixty-four, and I think every top twenty single going back to around
fifty-five.

B.72:  Wow!

A.73:  I think he's cut it out lately, because m-, most of the stuff, you know,
he can only get as cassette single, and he, you know, we both despise cassette
singles.

B.74:  [Laughter].

A.75:  Um, but he's found some of the Who stuff for me.  You know, we went, you
know, all, all this trouble to find this, and then they released a couple Who
rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it, it's like, great.

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  You know, and then the one other, I think the one other Who thing he
located for me was, um, [clicking] uh, I don't know if you're familiar with
the Who, they, they have a song called SUBSTITUTE?  [clicking] Doesn't ring a
bell.

B.78:  It sounds familiar.

A.79:  Oh, okay.

B.80:  But I can't, no, I like the Who, I've got some Who.

A.81:  Okay, anyway, um, there was a, um, a single of SUBSTITUTE,

B.82:  Yeah, SUBSTITUTE, #yeah, I know that song, yeah, okay, yeah.#

A.83:  #Okay, now you know what I'm talking about.# Yeah, um, anyway, it came out
in the mid-sixties in, in this country on a weird rec-, on a record label that
they aren't normally on, so it was cool, they find it for that, but the B side
was something called "Waltz for a Pig" which wasn't on any record and it
wasn't on the rarity records, so this was a big deal.  And then, um, you know,
once, once Steve found it for me and everything, I, I happened to go a-, and
look at some like, Who biographies I have and, uh, I discovered that the B
side isn't actually by the Who, it's by what's called the Who Orchestra,
because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldn't record, and
so it was actually by the, by a band called the ((Grand Bond)) Organization.

B.84:  How funny.

A.85:  So it's like, gee, all this trouble, and it's not even the Who.  Oh well,
it's a fun thing to have anyway.

B.86:  How funny.  Yeah it's,

A.87:  ((But)), it turns out that, um, uh, you know, listening to the, the version
of Substitute on the single, it's actually different than, than, um, the one
that was normally in the U S, because, um, uh, there was some lyrics they
found objectionable, I think the one, uh, I look all white, but my dad was
black, um, the American record companies said, nah, [laughter] you know, you
can't release this, so they, it has a different lyric on it, so that's kind of
neat.

B.88:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.89:  But, yeah.

B.90:  Yeah, it's worth it, I guess, for the, for the people that really like it.

A.91:  Well, um, you know, I have, um, you know like you were saying, you know,
I've got, I have a lot, a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and, uh, by
Pete Townsend.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  And, uh, some of the really fun stuff with Townsend, is um, o-, one of the
demos I have is called OBSCURE AND OBLIQUE, and it's, it's a bunch of demos,
and I f-, you know, I'm really curious, actually, how they got their hands on
this stuff, but, um, it's really cool listening to the stuff, because, um, you
hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the
song, or, or he recorded the song solo.

B.94:  Cool, yeah.

A.95:  And, it's just kind of interesting to see his, um, [clicking] you know,

B.96:  How he works up to the final product.

A.97:  [Clicking] Yeah.  There's, um, he's also put out a couple albums called
SCOOP, SCOOP AND ANOTHER SCOOP, which, um, are collections of demos, so I have
like three collections of demos of his, and there's a couple songs in the
collections that are the sa-, almost the same as songs the Who did on their
last album, but aren't [laughter], so that's, that's really cool.

B.98:  Oh, yeah.

A.99:  I mean, there's this one song called POPULAR that became the song
IT'S HARD with, um, a different verse, so [clicking],

B.100:  How fun.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, you d-, fifteen thousand singles?

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  Oh, I ca-, I have like, uh, twenty-five, and I think I'm doing real
[laughter],

A.103:  Well,

B.104:  but, a lot of those are real precious to me, you know, like V-, Cherry
Vanilla, you know, the, which was a, I, I have all of these, like, uh, the
Bowie genealogy, you know.

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  If, if, if I read somewhere, in you know, CIRCUS magazine in nineteen
seventy-two that David Bowie knew so and so, well,

A.107:  [Snorting].

B.108:  [Laughter] I had this ge-, you know, I bought a Mot the Hoople album, I
didn't even know who Mot the Hoople was,

A.109:  #Oh, but you got a good one, though [laughter].#

B.110:  #But, I knew that David Bowie# produced it, right.  So, [laughter] if David
Bowie wrote a song, and somebody did it, I r-, b-, I bought the album, you
know?

A.111:  Yeah, I'm like that a lot with the Who, I've got, I, I counted it up
sometime and I have like twelve versions of PINBALL WIZARD by, you know,

B.112:  Wow.

A.113:  either by the Who, or it's a demo, or it's a live version by the Who, and
then there's like the Elton John version, and then, um,

B.114:  Right.

A.115:  I guess the, the, the weirdest ones I have are ones by the New Seekers?
You know, the guys that did I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD TO SING? [clicking].

B.116:  Yeah? You know --

A.117:  And, uh, the other one is, uh, Rod Stewart, of all people.

B.118:  -- you know, I was listening to that song the other day. Now, y-, y-, you
would know this, you of all people would know this, I was like, I have
listened to that song a million times, okay?

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  And we had just gone to church, and then we were like listening to it, and
I went, you know this is a really Christian song, Harry, to my husband, and he
was like, no, I think it's, you're just weird.  But have you ever, I mean, I,
I know that's kind of a strange thing to say, but, uh, do you see like, tho-,
those overtones?  I mean, couldn't that be like a gospel song? [laughter]
You're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird.  But I mean
it's like,

A.121:  [Laughter] I don't know, it's, it's hard for me to l-, listen to it in true
light anymore since I've heard it so many times, um, I mean I ca-, I mean, I
want to throw up usually when I hear it anymore.

B.122:  [Laughter].

A.123:  I, um, 

B.124:  But I was listening to it, and it was like, you know, the guy was like,
blind, I don't, I can't even, uh, think of what now, and I kept saying, no,
no, you know, listen, it, it works [laughter].

A.125:  Well, the, the problem with, b-, the problem with PINBALL WIZARD is that
it's, you, you hear it on the radio and it's completely out of context with,
because it, it, it's part of a larger work.

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  And, um, so, I don't know.  

B.128:  I, I don't know how,

A.129:  I mean, I don-, I don't want to disagree with you, I, I,
