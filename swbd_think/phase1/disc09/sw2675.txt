=========================================================================

B.1:  There you go. 

A.2:  Uh-huh. 

@B.3:  Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials and should the jury recommend, uh,
sentencing. 

A.4:  Uh-huh. 

B.5:  Now my personal opinion, I don't know.  Uh, uh, here lately it seems, well
up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and
permitting too many, oh, they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just
about ev-, everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital
crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose
on parole.

A.6:  Uh-huh. 

B.7:  It's just not right. 

A.8:  I think I agree with that very much. 

B.9:  And therefore --

A.10:  I, do you,

B.11:  -- I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing. 

A.12:  Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put
themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like
that, and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that
have been done?

B.13:  Yes, very possibly.  So many of us have led sheltered lives --

A.14:  Uh-huh. 

B.15:  -- that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury, I've never done it
myself --

A.16:  I never have either. 

B.17:  -- unfortunately, I wish I could have. 

A.18:  Is there a reason why you have never,

B.19:  I've just never been called up. 

A.20:  Uh-huh.  My husband works as a police man, so I always assumed that that
was why I was never called.

B.21:  Well now, that's possible. 

A.22:  Uh-huh. 

B.23:  But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once, but I --

A.24:  Uh-huh. 

B.25:  -- never made it to the jury. 

A.26:  Uh-huh.  Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?

B.27:  Not that I know of. 

A.28:  Somebody told me the other day that there is, (( )) what they call a six
man jury, and I had never heard of such thing, and I wondered if it was true.

B.29:  Uh-huh {pause}. Uh, I've never heard of it. 

A.30:  I never had either, but I just wondered.  Uh, another question was, should
a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision, and that I
wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.

B.31:  [Throat_clearing]  [cough]  Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should
be. 

A.32:  That would mean they all would have to decide --

B.33:  Exactly. 

A.34:  -- one way or the other. 

B.35:  Is it guilt or innocence.  But then again, so many times you get one or two
holdouts, and, and --

A.36:  Uh-huh. 

B.37:  -- it permits the criminal to get a retrial. 

A.38:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.39:  And there, that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone
in their that's a victim of circumstances --

A.40:  Uh-huh. 

B.41:  -- I mean, that's happened --

A.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.43:  -- and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh,
prove their innocence. 

A.44:  Bring some of these things out. 

B.45:  Yes. 

A.46:  Uh-huh. 

B.47:  We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get
involved in jury trials. 

A.48:  Un, apparently there are.  I, I, I, since my husband worked as a policeman,
I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are
not guilty of something --

B.49:  Uh-huh. 

A.50:  -- some part of whatever they're accused of. 

B.51:  Uh-huh. 

A.52:  I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.  Uh, but, I would
suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time,
or know the wrong person at the right time.

B.53:  Oh, that's it, and you just might resemble somebody. 

A.54:  Uh-huh. 

B.55:  Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.  It was
finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of. 

A.56:  Uh-huh. 

B.57:  We had, a Black man was accused simply because he resembled --

A.58:  Oh. 

B.59:  -- uh, someone who stuc-, who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was. 

A.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.61:  And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work, and he
had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,

A.62:  They still found him guilty?

B.63:  They found him guilty. 

A.64:  When people said he was at work?

B.65:  Well, they said it w-, this, this happened during lunch time. 

A.66:  Uh-huh. 

B.67:  And he could have disap-, gotten away at lunch time --

A.68:  Uh-huh. 

B.69:  -- and committed the robbery. 

A.70:  Yeah. 

B.71:  But after nine years, well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about
it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove
that he was innocent. 

A.72:  Oh, for heaven's sake.  So there's nine years of that man's life gone. 

B.73:  Exactly. 

A.74:  Uh-huh. 

B.75:  Now that just was not fair. 

A.76:  No, huh-uh. 

B.77:  So. 

A.78:  Yeah, I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies, we're, we bend over
backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial. 

B.79:  Yes. 

A.80:  And,

B.81:  Unfortunately, that's what happens. 

A.82:  And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I
bet, they still say our system is the best in the world. 

B.83:  Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system, but it's the best
one in the world.

A.84:  Yeah, it's the best one that exists, I guess. 

B.85:  Uh-huh.  And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,
and they try to solve them and everything, but, uh, I don't know, the Supreme
Court, well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit
burning of the flag.

A.86:  Oh, I think a lot of people are.  I think they've lost sight of some things
that are very important to our country.

B.87:  Well, it, the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech
--

A.88:  Uh-huh. 

B.89:  -- not freedom of action. 

A.90:  Yeah. 

B.91:  And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me no, I swear, if I ever saw somebody
to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would. 

A.92:  [Laughter]  That bad, huh.  I wouldn't like it, but I don't know if I'd go
that far. 

B.93:  Well, I happen to be a flag freak.  I served, I was in the service --

A.94:  Uh-huh. 

B.95:  -- I was in Korea --

A.96:  Uh-huh. 

B.97:  -- and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents. 

A.98:  Yeah, well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.
It's important in so many facets of our lives.

B.99:  Uh-huh. 

A.100:  And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag
stands for, they're welcome to go some place else. 

B.101:  Yeah, see what they,

A.102:  There's nobody holding them here. 

B.103:  See how they'd like it under another flag. 

A.104:  Right.  They'd soon be back, I'm sure. 

B.105:  Uh-huh. 

A.106:  Yeah. 

B.107:  Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here. 

A.108:  Uh-huh. 

B.109:  I hope they get something out of this. 

A.110:  Yeah, I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's, do you
think that's good --

B.111:  Oh --

A.112:  -- you know, like if a jury,

B.113:  -- passing sentence?

A.114:  Uh-huh. 

B.115:  Well, uh, uh, yes, but I think the jury should be able to recommend,

A.116:  Make a recommendation?

B.117:  Yes. 

A.118:  Do they sometimes make a recommendation?

B.119:  Oh, yes, yes. 

A.120:  That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do. 

B.121:  I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.  But I know I'm always
hearing that, uh, well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict and they
recommended,

A.122:  # And they recommend.  #

B.123:  # twenty years or # something. 

A.124:  Yeah.  And then the judge has the final decision --

B.125:  Yes. 

A.126:  -- on what does really happen.  Yeah. 

B.127:  Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the
ramifications of a sentence. 

A.128:  Uh-huh. 

B.129:  They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.

A.130:  Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put
away for a long time, but actually, their chance, course, when, a lot of times
when they come up for parole, they're denied.  It depends on --

B.131:  Uh-huh. 

A.132:  -- you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of
different things, I guess. 

B.133:  Yeah, but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole and,

A.134:  Uh-huh.  A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.  And
there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again. 

B.135:  Yes.  They just go out and repeat their crimes. 

A.136:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.137:  Well there, well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in
prison, but I think they ought to make it two offenses. 

A.138:  Uh-huh.  I always thought there was, there was wrong, it seems sometimes
that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more
jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody. 

B.139:  Uh-huh. 

A.140:  It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good, the balance isn't
right.  It doesn't make sense. 

B.141:  Yeah, very true.  Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear
its ugly head so frequently. 

A.142:  Uh-huh. 

B.143:  Race or nationality even. 

A.144:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.145:  {Pause} But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system, but it's
the best one we've got.

A.146:  Yeah, right.  So, let's put up with it, I guess. 

B.147:  Uh-huh. 

A.148:  Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance. 

B.149:  Sure enough. 

A.150:  So. 

B.151:  Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you. 

A.152:  Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack, and I hope you have a real good
day and week. 

B.153:  Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were
discussing. 

A.154:  [Laughter]  I hope not. 

B.155:  Take care now. 

A.156:  You, too. 

B.157:  Bye. 

A.158:  Bye-bye.
