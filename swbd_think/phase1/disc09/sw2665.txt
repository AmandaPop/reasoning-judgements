REMARKS:        Speaker A speaks very fast, running all her words together
and is difficult to separate all she says.  Names of wines spelled 
phonetically.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, the recording starts. 

B.2:  Okay,

@A.3:  What kind of hobbies do you have?

B.4:  I have two main hobbies.  One of them is painting and the other one is
collecting wine, but from your, from the description it sounds like they're
more interested in painting.

A.5:  Oh [laughter].  Well, I'm interested in wine, I like the wine. 

B.6:  Oh, that's good, that's fine. 

A.7:  Yeah, what kind of wines do you like?

B.8:  Well, I'm a very big fav-, much in favor of red wines.  And I have about a
thousand bottles down in my cellar. 

A.9:  Oh, really. 

B.10:  And I've been collecting it now for, oh, fifteen years or so. 

A.11:  My goodness.  Red wines, huh.  I'm a white wine drinker, myself.  I'm on
the white zinfandels now.  I've come up the ladder the chablis and the rhines,
now, I've got, uh, on zinfandels.

B.12:  Oh, okay.  White zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine. 

A.13:  Really [laughter]. 

B.14:  The whites I like are these very okie chardonais --

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  -- like Kessler and things like that. 

A.17:  You don't have any vineyards up there, do you, Merrill?

B.18:  Uh, there are some, but --

A.19:  Are there. 

B.20:  -- and in fact their white wines are better than their red wines because
they don't get enough sun to make good red wine. 

A.21:  Oh, okay.  Now, see, I'm from Grapevine.  That's, uh, used to be, we have a
winery here, but, uh, it used to be, uh, I think they had a couple of wineries
at one time.  But they do grow grapes here.  That's where they get the name,
Grapevine. 

B.22:  I'm originally from El Paso, Texas. 

A.23:  Oh, are you? 

B.24:  And I have friend who has a vineyard.  Actually it's in New Mexico near La
Yunon, New Mexico, which is just north of El Paso up the valley.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  I understand the University of Texas has a huge winery down in
south Texas some place, a really big one.  I, I don't know they're, I guess
they're bottling it.  I don't, what the sell it un-, what name they sell it
under.  Have you ever visited the wineries in California. 

B.26:  Yes, some of them. 

A.27:  Uh, I've gone to a cou-, my parents live in Northern California, so I visit
there.  Back to hobbies, I guess.  And, what kind of painting do you do?

B.28:  Oh, mostly, mostly figures.  I'd few, done landscapes.  My grandmother was
an artist, so when I was a little kid, I was baby sat in her studio, so I
learned to mix paint by watching people mix paint --

A.29:  Oh, okay.  That's a good idea. 

B.30:  -- things like that.  So. 

A.31:  I used to paint, uh, you know, I just dabble, and I really think I have a
talent for it, but I've never really explored it like I should.  What little I
have done, I think is pretty good, but as I said I never have gone on with it. 
Maybe I should have.  If I'd, uh, you know, taken lessons or something, but I,
through the years, I'm not any good any more.  When I was younger I used to be
pretty good. 

B.32:  For years I used to go to groups that hire a model and draw once a week
when I lived in New Jersey --

A.33:  Oh, did you?

B.34:  -- and used to work at Bell Labs. 

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  And I'd go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten
years, you get to where you can actually [laughter] draw pretty well.

A.37:  [Laughter] Yes I would imagine, I would hope so anyway.  Well, I, when I
was in high school, I think I drew a mural behind the concession stand at the
local theatre, you know, stuff like that.  I won first prize painting the
front of a bar Halloween ni-. Instead of kids soaping windows, they wanted us
to paint, you know, windows in town, and I painted something, won first prize
on that.  But, like I said, I never did go on with it and, uh.

B.38:  Oh, I still paint occasionally, not as much as I used to, but I still
paint.  I have some stuff set up.  The only two things in my basement are my
painting stuff and the wine cellars. 

A.39:  [Laughter]  Wine cellars, that's nice. 

B.40:  Well, I built it.  I,

A.41:  Oh, did you?

B.42:  Yeah, had to have some way of storing them, so. 

A.43:  Oh, uh-huh, well, you know, we don't have, not many people have basements
here, for some reason.  I don't know why.  The ground's not wet like it is in
Florida, so I don't why we don't have basements, you don't see too many of
them. 

B.44:  Yeah, I think you probably don't get very good, very good number of square
feet for your dollar building a basement there.  That's probably why. 

A.45:  Yeah, I guess so, guess so.  Well [throat_clearing] the only hobbies I have
is I jog, and, uh, every night, and that's just, that [laughter] and my yard
work.  I love to, I work in the yard.  I, I have my yard work done, but I do
my flowers, you know, and stuff.  I like to do stuff like that, and I have
quite a variety of flowers.  I work on that every, all the time.

B.46:  So you must have a lot, well, you ought to be seeing lots of flowers this
time of year. 

A.47:  Oh, yeah.  They really are beautiful, gorgeous time of the year, because
they are really out, especially roses.  Roses do grow good down here.  I guess
that's probably my best hobby.  And then I do volunteer work at a hospital.
That's kind of a hobby, I guess.  I work in intensive care of a local
hospital, just [throat_clearing] one night a week.  And that's kind of fun and
different, and kind of like a hobby, I guess.

@@B.48:  You find out what it's like in that kind of business. 

A.49:  Yeah, I'm amazed the people, uh, the different types of people I've met,
that, the rude people, the people that are so inconsiderate of other people,
and it just boggles my mind how many I find like that that think they're the
only ones that are grieving or having a hard time, they don't have any respect
for the people, you know, sitting across the room, you know, and they'll be
laughing and carrying on, and here are these people that are sad, and I just,
I just can't get over peop-, how people are.  I'm really getting a rude
awakening, to how the human nature is, I guess.  You know, and last night,
there's big signs telling them not to go in without checking with the
volunteer, and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two
people at a time.  And so, this man walks, you know, just walks up, without
even checking with me, with his seven year old daughter and his wife, so
that's three of them just.  You know, there's three rules right there he
busted [laughter] and he walked right on in.  And I thought, golly, you know,
he didn't even follow any of the rules, and I, didn't even seem to bother.
Course they kicked him right out [laughter].

B.50:  [Laughter]  And he probably didn't like that. 

A.51:  [Laughter]  Oh, yeah, very highly insulted, you know.  How dare they
[laughter].  But I just can't, I just can't believe people.  This, that's some
place you need to work to really see how people really are [noise].  When it
comes right down to it. 

B.52:  Well, working in a research place, I work at National Institute of
Standards and Technology, which used to be National Bureau of Standards --

A.53:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.54:  -- that's kind of an ivory tower place.  So. 

A.55:  Yeah.  I used to know a guy that, uh, from T I that was, uh, real big in
standards.  Uh, James Tu that worked at, uh, T I.  And he was over the
standards labs and everything, I believe there, and I was always impressed by
all the clocks, and, you know, the, when we take things to be calibrated and
what have you in the standards labs.  It was kind of interesting.  That what
you all do, calibrate and,

B.56:  There was lots of stuff.  The only people I guess I know at T I are either
the people who work in the speech program, who run this, this computer program
or the people in the semiconductor area.  I used to know Paul Chattergy
and those kind of people.

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  Don't know if you'd know him or not. 

A.59:  No, I had worked for T I for seventeen years but I, uh, quit about five
years, six years ago, I guess, and went with Mark Marietta and then came up
here with another company, and about two and a half years ago from Florida.
They're just back in the same area, but I enjoy it here.  I'm a Texas person.
I'm not a native Texan, but I love Texas.  So, I wasn't happy till I got back
[laughter].

B.60:  [Laughter]  Well, I grew up in Texas and I moved away and never came back. 
So,

A.61:  Never came back, huh.  Oh well.  All my family's in California.  I just, I
don't know, I just couldn't stand being away from Texas.  I kept coming back,

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  and it feels good.  I'm real happy here.  I like the weather and the
people, and.  I like the people in Florida, too, they were nice.  Uh, I
enjoyed Florida, but I like Texas better.  Anyway, I guess our five minutes is
up.

B.64:  I guess they are [laughter].  It's been nice talking to you. 

A.65:  Been nice talking to you.  Bye. 

B.66:  Bye.
