=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, this is really ironic that this would, I would get this subject today
because just yesterday our dog ran away [laughter].

B.2:  Oh, no.  

A.3:  And it's just been tearing me up all day [laughter].  

B.4:  Oh, I bet.  

A.5:  Because we have just been looking all over for him.  We've been to the
pound, we've been to the humane society, we've been to the adoption center,
we've just been all over the neighborhood, we've been calling neighbors
[laughter].  So this is just really strange [laughter].

B.6:  Oh, I guess so.  Have you lost him before?  

A.7:  No, this is the first time.  Um, he's gotten out before, but he's always
stayed right here --

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  -- you know, he's never gone away.  And so this is just really strange, you
know because,

B.10:  What kind of a dog is he?  

A.11:  Um, he's part golden Lab and part, uh, [lipsmack], let's see, Alaskan, no,
not Alaskan.  I always forget [laughter].

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Uh, Australian shepherd.  

B.14:  Oh, 

A.15:  And,

B.16:  boy, he's a big one.  

A.17:  Yeah, he's pretty big.  That's why it really surprises me, you know, that
he hasn't come back, because, [breathing] like I said, he's never gone away
like this before, and, [breathing] I would think, you know, he might, I mean,
he might could get hurt by a car or something.  I don't know that he could
really get killed that easily because he is so big.

B.18:  Yeah. 

A.19:  You know, but, [breathing] I don't know [laughter].  

B.20:  Oh, well, I hope he comes back, that's too bad.  

A.21:  Thanks, I do, too [laughter].  

B.22:  How long have you had him?  

A.23:  Oh, about two years.  So, he's [breathing],

B.24:  Oh, that's tough.  

A.25:  Yeah, [breathing] it's really, gosh, [laughter] anyway,

B.26:  Yeah, you get very attached to animals, don't you?

A.27:  That, isn't that funny how we do?  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  I mean, we just really,

B.30:  Well, you know, they're always there for you and they don't talk back to
you [laughter].

A.31:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.32:  And, uh, [breathing] it's kind of pleasant.

A.33:  Well, they're companions,

B.34:  Yeah, sure, sure.

A.35:  Well, do you have any?  

B.36:  Yes, we have a dog, a little white Lhasa.  And her name is Angel.  And we
have a cat, who, a white cat.  He's, he's just a Tabby, just a, and his name
is Dominique.  We call him Neek.

A.37:  Um, [laughter].  

B.38:  But,

A.39:  How do they get along together?  

B.40:  Pretty good.  Uh, we've, we had the, the dog first, and, uh, she's kind of
a wimp and,

A.41:  [Laughter].  

B.42:  and the cat kind of rules, but, uh, she likes him all right.  He, we had
another cat about two years ago.  It got leukemia, [noise] feline leukemia --

A.43:  Um.  

B.44:  -- so we had to have it put to sleep, and, uh, then we got this new cat,
so, uh.  I have two children and they really enjoy the animals.  And then my
mother who's very elderly lives with us, and she's really good friends with
the dog.  They're very,

A.45:  Oh, yeah.  

B.46:  good buddies.  

A.47:  [Breathing] That's what are so neat about animals, I mean, they are, you
know, like I said, they're, they're really companions, you know, and they're
friends,

B.48:  That's right.

A.49:  [Noise] you know.  I mean, they, you can love them all you want and they
love you right back and they don't [laughter],

B.50:  That's right.  They don't care what you look like, 

A.51:  No.  

B.52:  or what you act like,

A.53:  [Laughter].  

B.54:  They just love you, unconditionally.

A.55:  I know.  

B.56:  It's wonderful.  

A.57:  It's just so neat.  You know, it's, that's, I don't know [laughter], this is just so hard.

B.58:  Oh, I know it has to be.  

A.59:  It's just, it's like I said, we've had him for two years and he's never, I
mean, he's, he's gotten out, but he's always been right there.  He's never
been gone for, at all --

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.61:  -- you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out.

B.62:  Oh. 

A.63:  You know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this [laughter].

B.64:  Oh, that's really too bad, that's awful, well,  

A.65:  Uh, [breathing] I, [lipsmack] I just knew today, uh, you know, that we
looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place, and I knew we
were going to find him, you know, and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,
[laughter].  So [lipsmack] I don't know.

B.66:  Well, I, I'll, I hope you'll find him.  You most likely will.

A.67:  Yeah, we keep, you know, they told us like at the Humane Society and the
adoption center, you know, don't give up hope, you know, [breathing] and then,

B.68:  Well, have you put any posters up or anything like that?  

A.69:  Well, not yet.  We were talking about that tonight since, you know, he, we
just, he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we, we
were trying to find some pictures of him recently.  We've got so many when he
was a puppy [breathing] [laughter],

B.70:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.71:  you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.  We have him on film, you
know, on the video camera [laughter].

B.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  

A.73:  You know, but you can't put that on the [laughter], 

B.74:  No, you sure can't.  

A.75:  you know, so [laughter],

B.76:  Oh, dear.  

A.77:  So, I don't know, I, we will probably will put some things up.  Some
posters and stuff up [lipsmack].

B.78:  Well, that's good.  

A.79:  And hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.
But, [breathing] we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood, so
that helps, too, you know, if they can keep,

B.80:  They can keep their eyes open, yeah.  

A.81:  yeah, so, [lipsmack].  

B.82:  That will help.  Well,

A.83:  I think that if somebody else picks him up, I think that, uh, if he gets
out he'll come back.

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  You know.  I really do, because he knows exactly where he lives, so
[breathing],

B.86:  Yeah, yeah he will.  I bet he does.  

A.87:  [Lipsmack].

B.88:  I know, that it's hard on you.  I know that I'd be worried, too.

A.89:  [Breathing] I know.  It's just like, it's, it's just so ironic that this
would happen [laughter] and I would get this, this kind of a call [laughter].

B.90:  Yeah, isn't it, though?  

A.91:  I know, 

B.92:  That's,

A.93:  it's very strange but,

B.94:  You know, I know sometimes our cat will, will stay out all night, [noise]
and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that
something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know,
somebody's hit him and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then I
really get scared.  But he's always come back eventually so, 

A.95:  Well, that's good.  That's one thing about cats though, they're so small
[breathing] --

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  -- and, you know, they can get hurt a lot easier.  

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  You know, they can get hurt a lot easier, 

B.100:  Yeah, 

A.101:  you know,

B.102:  they can.  

A.103:  so that would make you really,

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  tend to worry about them [laughter], you know, if they're not right there
[breathing].

B.106:  Yeah.  Well, but he's a real feisty guy.  He fights with other cats in the
neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.

A.107:  Is that right?  

B.108:  He's, cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.  They
just really do not want other animals on their property.  They're very, very
[breathing], he, he just any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he
won't jump at them or anything, but he'll sit and he'll watch, and, I think
maybe he would if it came real close, but he's very protective of our
property.

A.109:  Huh.  That's really, I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because
my mother never liked them,

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  so I never had them growing up, 

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  so, you know, I never really had them around me, [breathing] you know, so
I've never owned one [laughter], you know, since I,

B.114:  Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're
very independent, and they're very, he's very affectionate when he wants to
be, but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be, he'll just, he'll,
you know either scratch you or run away.

A.115:  Huh.  

B.116:  But when he wants to be, uh, he's really affectionate.  He likes to lay
next to you and have you scratch his head and, and, and snuggle up to you,
and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.

A.117:  Huh [laughter].  

B.118:  But, dogs seem to be always in the mood.  They're always, you know, right
there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.

A.119:  Yeah, that's true [laughter].  I, I like the way they come up and they'll,
they'll put their head underneath your hand, you know.

B.120:  Yeah, yeah, oh.  

A.121:  [Laughter] that, and, uh, most dogs do that.  I mean, 

B.122:  Yeah, they do.  

A.123:  I don't know any that really don't.  I mean, you know, they know exactly
how to get that attention, you know,

B.124:  They sure do.

A.125:  they just, you know, come up, and they put your, you know --

B.126:  Yeah.  

A.127:  -- or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know [laughter].

B.128:  Now, do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-,

A.129:  Well, no.  Well, well, he's outside during the day and then we get home at
night we do bring him in.

B.130:  You have a fenced yard or,  

A.131:  Uh-huh,

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  yeah.  The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.
That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out [laughter],

B.134:  Yeah.  

A.135:  you know, because he's had all this room to run in, and, [breathing] but,

B.136:  Well, how did he get out?  

A.137:  He dug a hole under the fence.  

B.138:  Oh, boy.  

A.139:  Well, see, he did, he did it a couple weeks ago, dug a hole, and, you know,
we, we filled it back up --

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  -- put him back in there.  He did it again [laughter]  -- 

B.142:  Uh-huh.  

A.143:  -- so we chained him up --

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  -- you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you
know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.

B.146:  Right, right.  

A.147:  So, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire
around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire [breathing].   

B.150:  Oh. 

A.151:  So I can't, I, I, I just have not, I don't understand, you know, because
it's, like, he's got a good home, you know, he's got, I mean, we have two
kids, you know, that just love him a lot,

B.152:  Yeah, yeah.

A.153:  You know, it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out, you
know, we just couldn't,

B.154:  Well, you know, that, animals are like that.  They like to roam and
investigate.

A.155:  Yeah [breathing].  I guess that's,

B.156:  And see what's going on.  

A.157:  Yeah, I guess that's probably true.  I don't think it's anything we did
[laughter].

B.158:  No.  

A.159:  Least I hope not [laughter].  

B.160:  No.  I'm sure that, yeah,

A.161:  No, I, I know, I mean he's always, you know, [lipsmack] he really does have
a good home.  I think that's what really bothers me the most about it
[laughter].

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  You know, it's like,

B.164:  How are your kids handling it?  

A.165:  Well, [breathing] [lipsmack] I don't know if it's quite hit him, hit them.

B.166:  Uh-huh.  

A.167:  [Laughter] I have two girls, 

B.168:  Uh-huh.  

A.169:  and they, they just been real, uh, [breathing] I don't know, at first, you
know, they seemed to be upset, but now it's like, uh, well if he doesn't come
home, can we get another dog [laughter].

B.170:  [Laughter] yeah, that sounds like kids.  

A.171:  [Laughter].  It's like, [laughter], wait a minute [laughter], you know,
[laughter].

B.172:  [Laughter] Oh. 

A.173:  [Laughter] poor Buddy, you know.  [laughter] I said, he's only been gone a
day and you already want to replace him [breathing].

B.174:  What's his name, did you call?  

A.175:  Buddy.  

B.176:  Buddy?  

A.177:  Uh-huh.  

B.178:  We, that's was our cat's name that, that, that died.  

A.179:  Is that right [laughter]?  

B.180:  Oh, yeah.  We named him, uh, we named him Buddy after, uh, Buddy Bell, uh,
the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.

A.181:  Oh. [laughter].  

B.182:  And we used to, we were really into that when we got him going to the
Ranger games, and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason.

A.183:  [Laughter].  

B.184:  But, Buddy after Buddy Bell, so,  

A.185:  That's funny. 

B.186:  But, he was, he was a good cat, too.  We miss him a lot, 

A.187:  Yeah.

B.188:  and I, I feel real guilty because [breathing] we had him, like, for six
years and one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster and he got it.

A.189:  [Lipsmack] Oh. 

B.190:  And I just felt so bad, I, it's real contagious and it's, and the vet
[noise] said it runs rampant in this area [breathing],

A.191:  I didn't know that.  

B.192:  and if they don't have their booster, [breathing] any kind of saliva or
anything from another cat, if they get in a fight it automatically, like, they
get it if the other cat has it so,

A.193:  I had, I had no idea.  

B.194:  Oh. 

A.195:  I did not know that.  

B.196:  Oh.  It was, I just felt terrible.  I knew something was wrong with him
because his appetite was, he was just getting real skinny. {voices fade out}.
