B.1:  Just outside of Dallas?

A.2:  Okay.  Uh-huh.  My mother used to work at the Plano location.  I think she
moved back down into, closer into Dallas. 

B.3:  Yeah. 

A.4:  So,

B.5:  Okey-doke,

A.6:  # Okay, #

B.7:  # well, # punch one, we'll,

A.8:  Let me,

B.9:  get started. 

A.10:  let me, let me hit one.  Hold on just a second here.  {Touch tone phone
pressed}. Okay. 

@B.11:  Okay.  I guess my, my favorite eating out food is Mexican food --

A.12:  Uh-huh. 

B.13:  -- Tex-Mex, not real Mexican food,

A.14:  # [Laughter].  #

B.15:  # that # real Mexican food is too hot. 

A.16:  Okay.  Uh, my favorite, I have a lot of favorites.  I like to try a lot of
different things, uh, there's very few foods that I don't like.  I don't like
asparagus and beets and anything else I can pretty much eat.  Uh, recently I
went to a French restaurant and I had something called, uh, Spinach Fettucini
and crawfish --

B.17:  Uh. 

A.18:  -- and it was so delicious, I've been talking about it, it's my birthday --

B.19:  Uh-huh. 

A.20:  -- and I've been talking about it ever [laughter] ever since,

B.21:  # [Laughter].  #

A.22:  # it's # been about a week now, I've been talking about this plate of food
and, uh, the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service --

B.23:  Uh-huh. 

A.24:  -- uh, in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going
back again and again, uh, there were three waiters that waited on the entire
restaurant, they just all kept an eye on all the tables --

B.25:  Yeah. 

A.26:  -- and something that really impressed me was that I asked one waiter for
butter and then the next second [talking]  anoth-, a different waiter brought
the butter out and,

B.27:  # Yeah.  #

A.28:  # and # they hadn't even talked or anything, and it was, it was really
amazing [laughter] and so that really impresses me, the service in a
restaurant.

B.29:  Well, yeah, I, I like a rest-, I like a restaurant that, uh, not
necessarily for atmosphere --

A.30:  Uh-huh. 

B.31:  -- you know, uh, the atmosphere isn't worth a dime if the food is good and
the service is lousy --

A.32:  Exactly. 

B.33:  -- and this little ole Mexican restaurant we have right up here from the
house, I, I don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people --

A.34:  Uh-huh. 

B.35:  -- and it's just a little small restaurant, [throat_clearing]  pardon me,
and it's, uh, just kind of like a hole in the wall, but the food excellent --

A.36:  Uh-huh. 

B.37:  -- and, and the service is just excellent and the price is very reasonable.

A.38:  And that's probably not a chain, # restaurant.  #

B.39:  # It's # not a, chain, it's a little family owned restaurant. 

A.40:  I find that most, most family owned restaurant or, or single restaurant,
you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody,

B.41:  # Yeah.  #

A.42:  # it, # it, it has the family name on it,

B.43:  # Right.  #

A.44:  # and # so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to
going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring, you know, people out
of, that really don't, probably don't care too much about the establishment, so
they're not going to worry about taking care,

B.45:  # Yeah.  #

A.46:  # of # you, whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that, you
know, has been working there for twenty years or so,

B.47:  # Yeah.  #

A.48:  # they # want, they want you to be happy, so you get the service and, you
know, of course, with that will come the good food. 

B.49:  Yeah.  Plus you, you can go in after you, you've, uh, uh, gone to the place
quite a few times --

A.50:  Uh-huh. 

B.51:  -- uh, they get to know you --

A.52:  Exactly. 

B.53:  -- and, uh, uh,

A.54:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

B.55:  # you # know, appreciate you, and say hello to you, and how,

A.56:  # Exactly.  #

B.57:  # are # you doing, and all you got to do is sit down and say we'll have our
usual --

A.58:  Uh-huh. 

B.59:  -- and, uh, you know, it's just, it's real nice, # and, #

A.60:  # The # guy, that took me out to this French restaurant, he works
in a hotel nearby, and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he
sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant
--

B.61:  Yeah. 

A.62:  -- and, and at the end of our meal, you know, we're ready to go and we're
full, and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert,

B.63:  # Uh.  #

A.64:  # that # the restaurant has, so it was like ten desserts on one plate and
he just gave [laughter] it to us to eat, of course, we couldn't eat it,

B.65:  # Yeah.  #

A.66:  # but, # you know, he just did this and so the next time when we come in
he'll probably remember us,

B.67:  # Yeah.  #

A.68:  # just # because we looked so weird at the [laughter]  (( )),

B.69:  # Yeah.  #

A.70:  # you # know, but that, that was,

B.71:  Plus you go, you go to a big fancy restaurant and, uh, uh, some of the
price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the
atmosphere,

A.72:  # Exactly.  #

B.73:  # and # you can't eat that [laughter]. 

A.74:  [Laughter]  Exactly.  Exactly. 

B.75:  And, uh,

A.76:  One of my favorite restaurants is Steak and Ale, now,

B.77:  # Yeah.  #

A.78:  # that's # a chain, sort of a chain restaurant,

B.79:  # Yeah.  #

A.80:  # but # they seem to, I like, I like atmosphere myself and,

B.81:  # Yeah.  #

A.82:  # and # their food is good and I really like the salad bar and that, that
gets me in a restaurant, if there is really good salad bar because I love
salads and soups and things like that.

B.83:  And I guess it depends, you know, if it's just you and your husband going
out to eat, uh, unless it's, uh, anniversary or something like that, atmosphere
doesn't mean that much, but if you're taking another couple or taking relatives
or friends or something you want the place, you know, to be nice. 

A.84:  Right.  Right.  Uh,

B.85:  But, uh, and also we, we, uh, I, I wasn't too much on Chinese food until I
tried it and I really like it --

A.86:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.87:  -- and I even bought me wok and,

A.88:  # [Laughter].  #

B.89:  # my # own, doing my own Chinese cooking now but,

A.90:  Did you just recently try it?

B.91:  Uh-huh. 

A.92:  Uh-huh. 

B.93:  Yeah, we've tried it a couple of time,

A.94:  # Yeah.  #

B.95:  # and # even had, uh, uh, relatives over --

A.96:  Uh-huh. 

B.97:  -- and I cooked some out of that,

A.98:  # All right.  #

B.99:  # and boy # they just lapped it up,

A.100:  # Wow, maybe, #

B.101:  # but, uh, #

A.102:  I need to get me wok and have some people over [laughter]. 

B.103:  We saw this one advertised on T V. 

A.104:  Uh-huh. 

B.105:  It's, uh, uh, real [cough]  real good wok, it's hand, hand, uh, pounded not
hand carved,

A.106:  # Right.  Right.  #

B.107:  # hound, hand # made of iron. 

A.108:  Uh. 

B.109:  It's not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy. 

A.110:  Probably that it heats up real good and,

B.111:  Heats up real good and,

A.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.113:  # and # the meat and stuff doesn't stick to it,

A.114:  # Uh.  #

B.115:  # like # it will, uh, uh, aluminum or, uh, stainless steel. 

A.116:  And that was on a television advertisement,

B.117:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.118:  # one # of them nineteen ninety-five --

B.119:  Yeah. 

A.120:  -- deals. 

B.121:  Yeah. 

A.122:  Yeah, okay, that,

B.123:  # ((And it takes)), #

A.124:  # sounds good.  Yeah, # I don't like, I've tried probably just about
everything just because I don't like to,

B.125:  # Yeah.  #

A.126:  # you # know, I don't, I hate, one thing I hate to do in a restaurant is to
be with someone that want try things --

B.127:  # Yeah.  #

A.128:  -- #because # I'm also wanting to, anything that they have I will try and,
uh, you know, sometimes I may not like it, but I feel like I miss out, you
know, if I had gone a long time without trying Chinese food I would have had
to try it one day,

B.129:  # Yeah.  #

A.130:  # just # because I hate to miss out [laughter]. 

B.131:  Well, I love those fried vegetables --

A.132:  Uh-huh. 

B.133:  -- and especially the, uh, watercress and the crunchy, the,

A.134:  # Yeah.  #

B.135:  # crunchy # ones. 

A.136:  Yeah, the little crunchy things.  I,

B.137:  # Yeah.  #

A.138:  # never # know what they are, I just call them the crunchers. 

B.139:  Yeah. 

A.140:  So,

B.141:  We like, uh, we like seafood too,

A.142:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.143:  # and # we found a little ole, another little ole hole in the wall that
makes excellent fried catfish. 

A.144:  Um. 

B.145:  # Boy it's good.  #

A.146:  # that sounds good.  # I love catfish. 

B.147:  Yeah, I do too. 

A.148:  Uh-huh.  And I love shrimp and,

B.149:  We haven't tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here
last week and we went, took them there. 

A.150:  Uh-huh. 

B.151:  She had never had cat-, she was from Connecticut --

A.152:  Uh-huh. 

B.153:  -- and, uh, she had never had channel catfish --

A.154:  Uh. 

B.155:  -- and she tried the scallops.  I asked her if they were any good because I
new the scallops were probably, oh, you know, not local,

A.156:  # Right.  #

B.157:  # like, #

A.158:  # Right.  #

B.159:  # catfish # is --

A.160:  Right. 

B.161:  -- but she said it was very good,

A.162:  # Uh.  Yeah, #

B.163:  # and she, #

A.164:  I don't like scallops too much they have,

B.165:  # Yeah.  #

A.166:  # they # have kind a funny taste.  I can eat them but they're,

B.167:  Well, being from Connecticut they're,

A.168:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.169:  # they're # use to fresh seafood like,

A.170:  # Yeah.  #

B.171:  # shrimp # and,

A.172:  # Yeah.  #

B.173:  # lobster # and stuff like that. 

A.174:  Yeah.  I'm originally from New York,

B.175:  # Yeah.  #

A.176:  # I # grew up there, so I got to eat a lot of, uh, I mean just fresh,
fresh, I mean one, one day we were out just driving and they are always, uh,
oriental people with their little stands,

B.177:  # Yeah.  #

A.178:  # and # they're selling things and we decided we were going to buy this
thing, we didn't know what it was, we got in the car and opened it up and
started eating it and it was really, really good and we figured out that it was
octopus --

B.179:  Uh. 

A.180:  -- you know, and so we,

B.181:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.182:  # all # find of freaked out but you find all kinds of seafood things,

B.183:  # Yeah.  #

A.184:  # in, # up there where all the, uh, harbors are and things. 

B.185:  I never have tried octopus. 

A.186:  Yeah. 

B.187:  It looks like it would be,

A.188:  # [Laughter].  #

B.189:  # good # because it's all meat,

A.190:  # Yeah.  Yeah.  #

B.191:  # there's no # bones to it. 

A.192:  There's not a whole lot of taste it's,

B.193:  # It's not? #

A.194:  # just basically # meat and,

B.195:  # Yeah.  #

A.196:  # there's # not a lot of taste, not a lot to eat not to like --

B.197:  Yeah. 

A.198:  -- you know, so, unless you think it's bland,

B.199:  # Yeah.  #

A.200:  # or # something. 

B.201:  One of these days I would like to try a rattlesnake too. 

A.202:  Um. 

B.203:  I've heard that it's delicious. 

A.204:  Now, that's something I may not try [laughter]. 

B.205:  [Laughter]. 

A.206:  Yeah, I've heard that's good.  I've heard frog legs are good. 

B.207:  Oh, I love those. 

A.208:  I haven't had any [laughter]  of those yet, so I'll have to,

B.209:  # Yeah, #

A.210:  # try # those one day. 

B.211:  frog, frog legs are good.  Of course, you know, you ask somebody what meat
taste like, just about any meat, you ask them had a it taste like, they say like
chicken --

A.212:  Uh-huh.  Exactly. 

B.213:  -- but, uh, it does, it's similar to chicken,

A.214:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.215:  # but # the meat, the meat is sweeter --

A.216:  Uh-huh. 

B.217:  -- and you've ever, I use to go frog gigging as a kid --

A.218:  Uh-huh. 

B.219:  -- and gigging the frogs and then, uh, and get their legs --

A.220:  Right. 

B.221:  -- and the meat is, it's crystal clear meat, it's beautiful meat. 

A.222:  Uh. 

B.223:  Now, it is a little bits stringy --

A.224:  Uh-huh. 

B.225:  -- uh, because of, uh, because simply they're frog legs because they, you
know, they have the muscles,

A.226:  # Right.  Right.  #

B.227:  # and so # forth but it's, it's, it's sweet meat. 

A.228:  Um.  I think my favorite meat is lamb. 

B.229:  Now, I don't, I don't care a whole lot about lamb. 

A.230:  No.  I think, I think it's, it's got, I like the texture of it is why I
like it,

B.231:  # Yeah.  #

A.232:  # not # so much the taste but the tex-, it's not real chewy or, I mean it's
just real good to me, I can't really,

B.233:  # Yeah.  #

A.234:  # describe # why but,

B.235:  Well, lamb or veal, I'm not real,

A.236:  # Yeah.  #

B.237:  # crazy # over it. 

A.238:  I like veal too. 

B.239:  But, uh, while I was, I, I've worked for Texas Instruments out in
Ridgecrest, California --

A.240:  Uh-huh. 

B.241:  -- for eight years --

A.242:  Uh-huh. 

B.243:  -- and one time we went down to, uh, Bakersfield and there was a Basque
Restaurant --

A.244:  Uh. 

B.245:  -- B a s q u e --

A.246:  Uh-huh. 

B.247:  -- and, uh, we stopped there and ate and I wish I could find another one
here. 

A.248:  Um. 

B.249:  Oh, it was good. 

A.250:  I bet. 

B.251:  They serve it family style, everything,
