=============================================================================

B.1:  [Laughter]. 

A.2:  [Throat_clearing]  Okay, so do you do a lot of cooking in your family? 

B.3:  Um, I do some every now and then, I, I work and my wife's home during the
day so she usually ends up doing most of it. 

A.4:  Oh, yeah. 

B.5:  When I was single we used to always cook, around the house. 

A.6:  Yeah, do, do you like to cook. 

B.7:  Huh, yeah, I really like it,

A.8:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.9:  #um, there's# a few dishes, like, I, I grew up with the, um, you know,
having Polish and Ukrainian food. 

A.10:  Oh, really. 

B.11:  And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,

A.12:  #Oh.#

B.13:  #so# we, we definitely have different tastes, so. 

A.14:  Yeah, yeah, but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff
[throat_clearing]. 

B.15:  #Uh-huh.#

A.16:  #Yeah,# I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook [laughter].  I'm pretty bad.  My
husband is really good, he put himself through college working in restaurants. 

B.17:  Oh, wow. 

A.18:  And, uh, he's much better cook than I am, so, when I was home I still
cooked a lot and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.  And now, I went back
to work about a year and a half ago so, one of the things that he took over
was the cooking and the kids are thrilled, they're really happy, that I don't
cook anymore.

B.19:  Uh, [beep] they're like, uh, preferring it now, right [baby_crying]. 

A.20:  Yeah, they say oh dad, let dad cook mom, let him do it [laughter] 
[talking].  But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids? You obviously have
one. 

B.21:  Yeah, two, uh-huh. 

A.22:  Okay, you have two. 

B.23:  Yeah, one is, uh, nine months and the other is two and a half. 

A.24:  Two and half, oh. 

B.25:  Yeah, that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,
becau-,

A.26:  I was just going to say, {pause} makes a difference in what you eat doesn't
it [child_yelling].  Or are you not at that stage yet?

B.27:  Yeah, it does [laughter]. 

A.28:  Yeah. 

B.29:  We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, w-, eat, you know. 

A.30:  Right. 

B.31:  And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,

A.32:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.33:  #she can# make, uh, she makes six different meals, but. 

A.34:  #Oh my gosh.#

B.35:  #Like to have# one thing, you know, one likes chicken nuggets, the other
one like hot dogs,

A.36:  #Oh my gosh, I couldn't [child_laughing].#

B.37:  #and then she makes noodles with,# uh, with,

A.38:  #Yeah.#

B.39:  #s-,# soy sauce or whatever, so, all things. 

A.40:  [Throat_clearing]  Boy, I couldn't do that, I [noise], 

B.41:  But, um, yeah, our favorite, let me think, I was thinking of the one recipe
that, uh, that we made.  I guess the thing that always turned out the best for
us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy, and that
was, um,

A.42:  #What's that.#

B.43:  #uh, scallops,# uh, scallop, um,

A.44:  #Oh really.#

B.45:  #it has# a French name, it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese,
cream sauce with it and you pour it over rice,

A.46:  Oh yeah, what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something. 

B.47:  #Yeah, uh.#

A.48:  #Scallops Saint# something, or, yeah, (( )).

B.49:  Yeah, I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,

A.50:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.51:  #but, uh,# i-, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh,
standard cream sauce base and then, uh --

A.52:  Really, with scallops. 

B.53:  -- the scallops.  An, and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really
good. 

A.54:  No, no, I'm from New England, so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we
moved down here. 

B.55:  [Laughter]. 

A.56:  And, uh, that sounds delicious to me. 

B.57:  Yeah. 

A.58:  That sounds great. 

B.59:  Yeah, but, uh,

A.60:  I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.  We went to
this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game, they had, uh, a
murder mystery,

B.61:  #Uh-huh.#

A.62:  #and# you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the
mystery during the dinner,

B.63:  #Uh-huh.#

A.64:  #and# it was really fun and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you
know, we were going to try doing it ourselves, but we're trying to decide what
can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around
trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game,
so,

B.65:  #Right, yeah.#

A.66:  #so I# was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried
before that's pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just
leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready. 

B.67:  Uh-huh. 

A.68:  So that's, uh,

B.69:  Yeah that's another thing I have a problem with my wife,

A.70:  #Yeah.#

B.71:  #she,# uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.  She likes
the chicken and fish,

A.72:  #Uh, yeah.#

B.73:  #and, like# I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,

A.74:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.75:  #you know,# a lot, so [music]. 

A.76:  I know, my husband did too [throat_clearing].  His parents are Austrian and
they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table [laughter]. 

B.77:  Oh yeah, red meat, plenty of good red meat. 

A.78:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

B.79:  My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all. 

A.80:  Oh, my gosh. 

B.81:  And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know. 

A.82:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.83:  #My dad# wouldn't know what to do. 

A.84:  Oh, gosh, so do you,

B.85:  Course, she grew up Catholic so you know, they,

A.86:  #Oh, they did the,#

B.87:  #they sort of come# with the, there's a certain amount of meatless meals
you have to have [TV] [laughter]. 

A.88:  That you do, right, right, that's just part of it. 

B.89:  Uh-huh. 

A.90:  Yeah, we didn't, my family didn't, but when I got into the vegetarian
cooking we got kind of used to that, but my husband always did it kind of
grudgingly, he never,

B.91:  #Uh-huh.#

A.92:  #There# was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating. 

B.93:  Uh-huh. 

A.94:  Ther-, there were several things that he liked but it never was really,
something that he would have chosen.  It's just that I cooked so he had to put
up with it [laughter]. 

B.95:  Right. 

A.96:  So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans.
I tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it, so I never, I had,
I was limited.  I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans, but.

B.97:  Yeah, it's hard to get a protein content up then [laughter]. 

A.98:  Yeah, yeah.  That's true [throat_clearing]  [children]. 

B.99:  Yeah, I like, I like them every now and then for a change, ye-, it's nice. 

A.100:  Yeah, some of the stuff is good, but it just, it was a tremendous amount of
cooking [throat_clearing].  Because you do have to make sure you have the right
combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,

B.101:  #Uh-huh.#

A.102:  #and# we had little kids at the time, you know, when I was home with them,
and it, it was just so much cooking, I couldn't, I don't like to cook. 

B.103:  #[Laughter].#

A.104:  #And# I'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much
of a, too much, [throat_clearing]  too much cooking.  So, {pause} well, I guess
I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there. 

B.105:  No, uh, he's all done. 

A.106:  He's set, oh okay. 

B.107:  Yeah, yeah, I set him down. 

A.108:  Okay.  Do you like to bake at all, or do you, do you get into that's, that,

B.109:  Yeah, we used to do that, um, my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until
my dad like blew up, you know [laughter]. 

A.110:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.111:  Af-, after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy,
she stopped doing it. 

A.112:  [Laughter]. 

B.113:  But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread
rolls, you know, every week. 

A.114:  #Really, no kidding.#

B.115:  #And, um, the# sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four
days and that would be it. 

A.116:  Yeah, then be gone.  I know, that's the thing about baking.  I used to, I,
I don't mind baking at all and I, I can do a pretty good pie, we have this pie
crust recipe in our family [children] that my grandmother gave my mother and
my mother taught me how to make it.

B.117:  #Uh-huh.#

A.118:  #And,# um, so I can make a pretty mean pie, but, um, I don't do it anymore
because it's just too fattening.  We had the same kind of problem.  If you make
homemade bread,

B.119:  #Uh-huh [baby_crying].#

A.120:  #I mean,# forge-, it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three
times the amount of bread that you usually eat [laughter].  It tastes so good. 

B.121:  Uh-huh, we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um, you ever seen the,
the starter bread, I can't remember what it's called, they call it the, um,
Amish bread here but,

A.122:  #Oh, uh, yeah.#

B.123:  #uh, it's made# with, you just le-, leave it out,

A.124:  #Yeah.#

B.125:  #you# know, and you let it spoil sort of. 

A.126:  Yeah, uh-huh, I've heard of that, I've heard of it, but I've never done it.

B.127:  You know, yeah. 

A.128:  That sounds pretty good. 

B.129:  Yeah, it tasted pretty good, really. 

A.130:  Yeah, oh yeah. 

B.131:  But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and
then you add all these other ingredients to it, but. 

A.132:  Yeah, and then you sa-, you make the bread but you pinch off a portion, or
save a portion of it for the next time, or something. 

B.133:  Yeah right, ye-, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone
else and that's how they continue the thing.

A.134:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know, it sounds, it always sounded, I don't know how
safe that was [laughter]. 

B.135:  Yeah, I know it sounded strange to me too, I figure, well you're baking it
so, you know, yeah. 

A.136:  Yeah that's true, that's, that's got to kill anything I guess, but. 

B.137:  #Okay, well, I'll talk to you later.# 

A.138:  #All right, well, yeah thanks.#  

@@B.139:  Where are you calling from by the way, Texas. 

A.140:  Plano. 

B.141:  Where?

A.142:  Yeah, Plano, in Texas. 

B.143:  Plano, okay. 

A.144:  Are you in Texas?

B.145:  No, Falls Church, Virginia. 

A.146:  No kidding, gosh it sounds so close. 

B.147:  Yeah, I know we've got a good connection, must be a, uh, T I connection,
yeah. 

A.148:  Yeah, I thought for sure, I thought for sure you were in Dallas or
something. 

B.149:  Yeah, I, I talked to so many people from Texas that's where practically
everybody I talked to is from. 

A.150:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.151:  I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the
state, you know. 

A.152:  Yes they're doi-, they're trying to get all different amount of people. 
Well gee, my husband is from Richmond and I went to U V A, that's where we
went. 

B.153:  Oh, oh really. 

A.154:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.155:  Yeah I went to school at, uh, well I went to school at West Virginia
University,

A.156:  #Oh you did, yeah.#

B.157:  #but I grew up# right here in Falls Church, right outside D C. 

A.158:  Yeah, boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast, I'll tell you. 

B.159:  [Laughter]. 

A.160:  It's nice over there. 

B.161:  Yeah, it's sort of funny, I have people that want to go to Dallas. 

A.162:  Oh, really. 

B.163:  Yeah, one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's
thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas, saying how,

A.164:  Oh, yeah, no kidding.  Well, things are doing pretty good down here, we, we
were, we tried to move over to Raleigh last year and there just was, there was
so little, such little going on in Raleigh, you know, you couldn't get a job to
save yourself over there so we decided we'll try in a couple of years, but, but
business is,

B.165:  Yeah, yeah.  We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down
there cash, you know. 

A.166:  Yeah, you probably could, you probably could,

B.167:  Well Northern Virginia.  Okay. 

A.168:  Okay, well it's good talking to you. 

B.169:  Nice talking to you too. 

A.170:  Take care. 

B.171:  Bye, bye,

A.172:  Bye.
