REMARKS:        The first time through Speaker A kept cutting out, but I
managed to pick it back up the second time.  Then at the end of the 
conversation, Speaker B was being run over by Speaker A which made it hard 
to understand what he said in several places.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I don't, I mean, I don't know what you think about the, subject, I'd,
the, I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the,
the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him
to do that.  I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit
while I was waiting for them to phone somebody, and I don't know that that's
not a good idea.

B.2:  That's not a bad idea I, um, uh, that, you know, they probably, need to
change it somehow, uh, the whole system needs changing, we've just got too
many people ((in there)),

A.3:  # I agree.  #

B.4:  # and, uh, # (( )), are putting too many, uh, people in jail that probably
don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  But on that one thing, I, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,

A.7:  # Oh, yeah, I agree.  Yeah.  #

B.8:  # uh, I think we're getting # to the point now where they're going to
eventually let it be, um, majority vote.  And that's not going to be good. 

A.9:  I don't like that, no,

B.10:  # No.  #

A.11:  # I # don't like that at all.  I know my husband served on a, on a jury a
few months ago up here in Denton, but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug
conviction and I don't remember he had some cocaine and th-, ((it)) was
accused of selling it, and I don't remember exactly how much he had but, uh,
actually not selling ((it)), there's a difference, cr-, cro-, ((couriering))
it is what, ther-, is supposedly a difference from selling then being a
courier and,

B.12:  # Right.  #

A.13:  # he # was a courier.  And, uh, they, he's, he sat on that jury and they
found him guilty, and they went through the sentencing phase and everything
and, uh, you know, they were told that, you know, during the trial that this
is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record, and, and they
ended up, the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time to crackdown here, you
know, and it was time to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's
really, and they sentenced him to fifteen years,

B.14:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.15:  # you # know, which they thought first offense, okay, this is, they thought
that that was, that was a good thing.  And they sentencing him to fifteen years
and, um, after it was all over, uh, the jud-, they sit down with the judge and
with the other two lawyers, {talks to someone in the background}, let me come
over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two
lawyers and they were told that, uh, he would probably serve three,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # of # the fifteen,

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # and # that he had three previous convictions.  However, they could not
tell the jud-, the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in
appeal. 

B.20:  Oh, yeah. 

A.21:  So, the jury didn't know about it, so here they based their sentencing
thinking that this was this guy's first offense,

B.22:  # ((Sure)). #

A.23:  # and # so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson
but it's not just, you know, horrible,

B.24:  # ((Yeah)). #

A.25:  # since # it was first offense and he'd been convicted three times before,
you know,

B.26:  # ((Oh)). #

A.27:  # and, # and the jury was very upset and my husband came home, a home, very
upset, I mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked, you know,

B.28:  # Right.  #

A.29:  # and # so something, I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if
some of that would change, you know. 

B.30:  Yeah, the judge might know or at least it, it wouldn't hurt to switch over
there and see if it worked any better, if it didn't we can come back for
something else or,

A.31:  # That's true.  That's very true.  #

B.32:  # or, or what we've got, # so. 

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  Well, we definitely need a change in the system and, uh,

A.35:  Yeah, obviously what we are doing is not working, you know. 

B.36:  It's not working, ((too)).

A.37:  No. 

B.38:  It's just piling up on us. 

A.39:  Yeah, and there's, you know, there's people in ((our)) prisons that are not
being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,

B.40:  # Right.  #

A.41:  # and # either they're in there,

B.42:  # Right.  #

A.43:  # forever # or when they get out they're, you know, it's a matter of a few
months and they're going to be right back for the same thing so the system,

B.44:  We're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or
the money to do what it takes, so.

A.45:  That's very true. 

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  Yeah, I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and I
said, you know, I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on
the United States, to and,

B.48:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.49:  # and # the, and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # I # mean, we, and, and the-, I know people say, oh, it would be cruel to,
you know, pull our aid from these other countries and, and maybe so, so tell
them, you've got five years. 

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  To work out a plan, to make it on your own. 

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  And, we will continue funding you for the next two years, after two years
we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv-, you know, seventy-five percent. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent, and in five years, it
sh-, by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on
your own without our help. 

B.58:  Sure. 

A.59:  And then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do
that to,

B.60:  # Yeah.  #

A.61:  # to # work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
and we're trying to,

B.62:  # Very serious, yeah.  #

A.63:  # heal the world, # you know, it's just not,

B.64:  # ((Oh, yeah)), #

A.65:  # it's just # not working. 

B.66:  ((your right)), (( )).

A.67:  I look at the, I look at what, you know, thi-, what, the ((aid)) presented
to the Kurds and I, I feel sorry for them and I know they're suffering and I
know they're dying everyday, but we've got, you know, kids here in the United
States that are dying everyday, too. 

B.68:  Sure. 

A.69:  You know, and being,

B.70:  # ((Oh)). #

A.71:  # abused # and neglected and, you know, I don't know.  I just have this
problem with,

B.72:  # ((You bet)). #

A.73:  # uh, trying # to heal the world when you're so sick yourself, you know,
so. 

B.74:  Right.  Well, we seem to agree on the jury thing and, uh, but, ((uh)),
we'll need an unanimous verdict and,

A.75:  # Yep.  #

B.76:  # maybe # let the judge have a opportunity to make, #((a decision)). #

A.77:  # I think # we should try it, like you say,

B.78:  # Yeah.  #

A.79:  # if # it doesn't work, we can always come back, but I think it would be a
good idea to try it. 

B.80:  I do too. 

A.81:  So, anyway, #well, we all agree.# 

B.82:  #Well, good.# 

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  Good to hear from you. 

A.85:  You too, bye-bye. 

B.86:  Bye-bye.
