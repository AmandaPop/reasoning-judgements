=============================================================================

@A.1:  Well, um, so, um, ha-, do you have a son or daughter that's looking for a
college?

B.2:  Uh, I've been through it. 

A.3:  Oh, I'm still in it. 

B.4:  Okay [laughter].  No, we've, uh, we've had two children graduate so, and I
have worked at universities. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  So, it was a topic that, uh, seemed appropriate as far as discussion like
this. 

A.7:  Right. 

B.8:  You had, you're in the process of planning for or,

A.9:  # No.  I'm, #

B.10:  # your children # are there?

A.11:  I'm, I'm, I'm still in college. 

B.12:  Oh, okay, okay. 

A.13:  [Laughter] I'm still a student. 

B.14:  All right. 

A.15:  I'm graduating this May. 

B.16:  This May?

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  Well, good.  Where are you?

A.19:  Uh, North Carolina State University. 

B.20:  Very good. 

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  Uh, uh, the, uh, planning for college tuition and all the associated costs
is a tough, tough decision.  At,

A.23:  Yeah, I think it's, it's, when you're looking for a college that you want
to go to, I think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you
can pick the best quality.

B.24:  How did you choose North Carolina State?

A.25:  I choose it basically that way.  Uh, North Carolina State has a reputation
for being, uh, good agricultural school. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  In the area. 

B.28:  So, it's a land grant university, right?

A.29:  Exactly. 

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  And, um, they have a good extension service for agriculture and I wanted to
go into agriculture so I came here.  And since, since I was in, you know, in
state a pay re-,

B.32:  # ((Do you)), #

A.33:  # a pay # resident tuition so it was also, a, it was also good for me
because, you know, being a good school, plus in state tuition saved me a lot of
money. 

B.34:  Oh, yes, it certainly does.  And familiarity with the area, there's
sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but, uh,
there's as many,

A.35:  # Right.  Well, for example, yeah, #

B.36:  # to stay in the same # area. 

A.37:  yeah, I, I think that's very true because, for example, uh, I'm going to
graduate school after I finish here and, uh, I'm going to go to California. 

B.38:  Yeah, uh, two reasons for that I think if they even recommend in advanced
degrees to, uh, try a different set of teachers, get a different perspective as
far as the, the advanced degrees.  They'd like for you to change rather than
stay at the same institution. 

A.39:  That's true. 

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  Yeah, I mean, they would like for you to stay so that, you know, they, they
could keep getting your money but,

B.42:  # Right.  #

A.43:  # one, # you know, an employer likes to see different schools, I think. 

B.44:  Uh-huh.  You know, yeah, I think a very good adviser would, uh, tell you
that it's best for you anyway to get a different, uh, different set of
instructors on it and a little different outlook, and plus there are regional
differences I think too.  California may have a different type of emphasis now
agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of
the country would be wheat land,

A.45:  # Right.  #

B.46:  # here # it's tobacco and, uh, California it may be, uh, more of the grapes
and, and, uh, other types of,

A.47:  Right, they have it in California, they have a lot of heavy metal problems
also,

B.48:  # Oh, yes.  #

A.49:  # and a # lot of salts because of the valleys,

B.50:  # Right.  #

A.51:  # ((they're)) # very salty.  That's what I, I was interested in the one
over there I, uh, talked to some people in the university and I think also,
you know, um, dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions
because I think that's what really turned me towards that, you know,

B.52:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.53:  # the # school that I'm going to is, I went and talked to the people in the
school, and they gave me information which I could not have gotten otherwise,
and the, that really finalized my decision. 

B.54:  Yeah, what is your specialty?

A.55:  Well, I'm graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina
but I hopefully will go to California to receive a P H D in, uh, soil science
with a specialization in environmental pu-, environmental quality. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  Which would deal with, uh, ((ego)) toxicology, heavy metals and soils and
things like that, so, away from the production agriculture end of it, and more
into the soils and, you know, contaminants. 

B.58:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.59:  So, I'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which I think
is going to be a hot topic in the future with, you know, all these lands and,
and things that are being spoiled,

B.60:  # No question.  #

A.61:  # and how # to, how to remediate them and all. 

B.62:  No question, you, I'm sure you, you and your classmates have been following
the, uh, waste situation in North Carolina and the, the absence or facility to
handle,

A.63:  Right.  Especially in the ((sounds)).

B.64:  Right.  And it's, it's a universal problem, ((you know)), if you look at,
uh, some countries you expect them to have problems.  Latin America now with
cholera and,

A.65:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.66:  # and # a bunch of other problems associated with waste management.  The
United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep
problem of how to take care of our waste.  We create a bunch, now, now what do
we do with it. 

A.67:  Yeah, now, that, know that it's getting harder to get permits for
landfills, uh, i-, the, the problem's pressing down harder than ever.

B.68:  Yeah, and then, I think there's a, a big mistrust, public mistrust as there
is with nuclear energy.  Uh, they were talking about Chernobyl again this,
this week because it's an anniversary but I think there's a big mistrust of,
uh, some the ways to management companies in terms of how well they do take
care of their product, and that's got to be solved.  I think there has to be
public trust in it before you can,

A.69:  # Yes, uh, I agree with you.  #

B.70:  # find a good sight.  Well, I # wish you luck in California. 

A.71:  Yeah, uh, thanks a lot. 

B.72:  Okay. 

A.73:  It was nice talking to you. 

B.74:  Same here. 

A.75:  All right. 

B.76:  #Bye, (( )).#

A.77:  #Bye.#
