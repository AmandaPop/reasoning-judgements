=============================================================================

A.1:  Some of the T V shows that, uh, I like are usually something that shows me
something about a profession that I don't necessarily know how it operates.
And one of the earliest shows that, uh, taught me something was the old
BEWITCHED shows.  When I was growing up [breathing] I remember thinking, so
that's how the advertising game is played.  That's how they developed these
things.  That's where commercials some from.

B.2:  Right. 

A.3:  And I really didn't, um, before that, I think, that was the very first show
that I ever realized that on, and then, oh, a little bit later, I don't
particularly like L A LAW as a series, but I do like some of the insights not
so much into the legal profession but into the, the fact that some of the,
well, for instance, some of the deals that are made by the D A you know,

B.4:  # Right.  #

A.5:  # you # here about some of these things and it sounds really bad.  Well,
you don't know what's gone on before, um, they had one case where the D A had
been injured.  She has been hurt, and, you know, was a little bit fearful of,
of making frie-, any enemies at the moment.

B.6:  Right. 

A.7:  So, uh, just little things like that makes you realize there is a human
behind this whole story, you know, that, that was written up in the paper
that, that ((D A cuts a)) bad deal.

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  As well as, some of the, the arguments on, you know, a guy gets arrested
for D W I.  Well, depending upon what the guy says he's going to say in court,
regardless of the truth, what the guy says he's going to say is, you know,
fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test, and all these kinds of
things, and you could probably get away, you know, get off on it.  So, they
just plea bargained it out,

B.10:  # Sure.  #

A.11:  # and # be done with it.  Oh, like those little things, I guess, I have to
be reminded that there're, there're so many details that just don't get out,
that you can't, uh, can't take the reported word for some of these things,

B.12:  # Yeah, right.  #

A.13:  # I guess # I like shows that, that show me something some insights into
other parts of, of living that I don't always get exposed to.  How about
yourself?

B.14:  I don't know.  I've, I tend to like a lot of the old, uh, older T V shows
like, uh, for instance there's, there's, I love watching old TWILIGHT ZONES
and, um, and they've been, there's a st-, station here that runs mostly
syndicated things, and that's one thing I like to catch on late at night is
the old TWILIGHT ZONES but, um, for T V that's out right now, I, I, the shows I
like to see for one reason or another that I've been catching, um, MATLOCK and
Tuesday nights for some re-, I guess, are my T V night, and I like to see, uh,
MATLOCK and then IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.

A.15:  Huh. 

B.16:  Uh, are two shows that, that I like to see, after seeing the, the
television show IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT I wanted, I haven't never seen the
movie, but, uh, I think I'd like to check out that movie sometime.

A.17:  Right. 

B.18:  It's, um, I don't know it's just kind of interesting.  They have great
characters in that, uh, T V show and it's interesting from, I just saw the
pilot to it, oh, a week or two ago, and it was a special two hour thing, but
it was the first thing, like I said the pilot,

A.19:  # Right.  #

B.20:  # and, # um, the characters in it were the white police officers, when the,
the black guy from Philadelphia went down there, were much more bigoted and
more the villains in that episode, and now, over the time of the television
show, they're all very much, um, um, not big-, or very more in the twentieth
century ((now)),

A.21:  # Right.  #

B.22:  # or # let's say they are very undenom-, unbigoted. 

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  And they even have added, uh, this, uh, other black police officer to the
cast.  So, it's interesting how they kind of got away from the org-, I guess,
the premise of the movie.  As well as the problems that, that, uh, he had with
the police officers, and now, it's more concentrated on the problems they have
in the small town in the south. 

A.25:  Huh. 

B.26:  And it's, it's kind of interesting because it's supposed to be this little
tiny town down in, down south, but, um, I live in this little teeny town up
here in upstate New York, and it's not too much different so,

A.27:  # [Laughter]  Well, that's interesting.  #

B.28:  # People got a lot # to learn, I th-, everywhere. 

A.29:  Yeah, yeah.  I've, I've seen INTO THE NIGHT through, off and on, through
out it's television career as it were,

B.30:  # Right.  #

A.31:  # and # I wonder if, if they did that intentionally or if they just had,
whether they decided to do away with the, the racial problem as the main thrust
of it, or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down
somewhat. 

B.32:  Right.  I, I don't know,

A.33:  # Huh.  #

B.34:  # either.  # ((I don't know)), yeah. 

A.35:  Quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems
that it is today, as opposed,

B.36:  # Right.  #

A.37:  # to # the, the hitting over the head type problems that it was then. 

B.38:  Right. 

A.39:  And, uh, they, they have, um, pretty good bunch of actors and well acted
parts, and you can take a good actor and put him in a bad part, and it doesn't
do any good but, huh,

B.40:  # Sure.  #

A.41:  # but # they found a good combination of roles and, and actors and
actresses on that show, and it's a pretty good one.

B.42:  It's a lot different seeing Carroll O'Conner in that role than, um, Archie
Bunker in [laughter], 

A.43:  Yeah.  That's true, that's true.  #Didn't get the,#

B.44:  #And maybe a little more versatile# than anybody ever gave him credit for.

A.45:  Right. 

B.46:  But, uh,

A.47:  Yeah, there're, there're just starting to rerun those ALL IN THE FAMILY
down here on a particular, on a major station, and it's, uh, I never did like
it particularly, and I've watched a couple of them off an on, um, just to get
a feel for what, what was being said then, but it, the, I, I don't know it's a
pretty simplistic deal, and they, they pound whatever message they're going to
say over and over, and that's about the end of it.  So,

B.48:  Right. 

A.49:  I don't know if I would have liked it when it was current and, and being
discussed.  Maybe it would have been a little better, but, uh,

B.50:  This, this is THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, isn't it?

A.51:  No, the, the ALL IN THE FAMILY reruns, #that are being shown now.# 

B.52:  #Oh, oh.  ALL IN THE FAMILY.  Right, right, right.# 

A.53:  They, they really take, whatever point they're wanting to make, they, they
reiterate it over and over, you know, it's as if the intelligence level of the
people that watch this,

B.54:  # Right.  #

A.55:  # or # something other.  They handle a, a wide, you know, range of, of
topics. 

B.56:  Sure. 

A.57:  But the, I don't know.  Maybe it would have been better the first time
through, then it was more when the public was talking about it.  You know, sit
around the table and,

B.58:  # When it was relevant.  #

A.59:  # Talk about the this # that and the other, but some of the issues seem a
little out dated, but, of course, that's what reruns are for. 

B.60:  Yeah,

A.61:  # And, #

B.62:  # Well, # you've got old Meathead there and the rest of the gang at the,
where Meathead and, and Sally Struthers there with the, um, the liberals s-,
supposedly correct view,

A.63:  # Right.  #

B.64:  # at # the time and then, uh, Archie Bunker with his, uh, antiquated, uh,
red-necked, uh, ideas I don't know, it, the old meets new head on, and
[laughter] whatever, but now it's all old, so you could have another one, you
could have a new T V show with, um, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers in with
their kids moving in,

A.65:  # Right.  #

B.66:  # and, # um,

A.67:  Yeah, kind of another generation's problems. 

B.68:  Yeah, and have them be, oh, I don't even know, yuppies are passe now.  I'm
not even sure what, uh,

A.69:  What to latch on to. 

B.70:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.71:  I don't know.  Well, I here one of my kiddos coming in the door.  So, I'll
wind this one up and go see what they need. 

B.72:  Okay.  Well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.73:  Well, maybe we'll cross paths again later. 

B.74:  All right. 

A.75:  Um, bye. 

B.76:  Bye-bye.
