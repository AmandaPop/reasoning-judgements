REMARKS:        I called the library regarding Papa Doc's.  They said his
nickname was Baby Doc, but the speaker did say Papa Doc.  

==========================================================================

A.1:  The subject is how we feel about immigration. 

B.2:  Yes. 

@A.3:  Would you like to get started or would you like me to?

B.4:  (( )), well, I am very much in favor of closing our door to some extent. 
I'm afraid I've gotten a little bit America first when I get a cab,

A.5:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.6:  # in # almost any large city in the United States, and the driver barely
speaks English. 

A.7:  Yes. 

B.8:  Um. 

A.9:  That's happened to me, too. 

B.10:  Yes [breathing].  Of course, it also happened to us in Sidney, Australia
this Summer, uh, or last Summer.  We got a cab and, again, it was an oriental
person.  And we asked him to take us to the opera house and he did not know
what we were talking about.

A.11:  Oh, my. 

B.12:  So, maybe my isolation isn't for our country, [laughter]  might be a little
bit for the world, I don't know.  But, uh, I just feel like we are, we have
accepted people, other people from other countries so well to the point that we
have not taken care of our own.  How do you feel about (( )) [breathing]? 

A.13:  Well, I have, I'm really torn on the subject.  I'm not a good candidate for
this one.  I see what you see and I agree with you. 

B.14:  However?

A.15:  Well, the other side I see, because we have Mexico,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # as # a neighbor --

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  -- and I can tell you right now --

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  -- that if I,

B.22:  # Um.  #

A.23:  # were # living in Mexico and trying to raise several children, and I could
see across the border --

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  -- where the good life would be for my children --

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  -- would I swim that river?

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # Every # night, twice,

B.30:  You betcha. 

A.31:  if that's what it ((took)).

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  You know, I don't care, whatever it would take. 

B.34:  Um. 

A.35:  I have real sympathy for those people, I really do.  And,

B.36:  # However, #

A.37:  # you # ca-,

B.38:  if you were living in Mexico in those conditions, would you have several
children?

A.39:  Probably.  They don't have birth control. 

B.40:  Well,

A.41:  They have no #concept of it. #

B.42:  # but you, #

A.43:  It's against their church. 

B.44:  yourself, you yourself would not do that.  You would not have several
children if you couldn't,

A.45:  Well,

B.46:  # [Breathing].  #

A.47:  # but, # they don't have, if, you know, if I had to put myself in their
shoes, I have to do it one hundred percent. 

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  Their,

B.50:  # But, you don't ha-, #

A.51:  # church doesn't teach birth # control, they preach against it. 

B.52:  That's not my fault. 

A.53:  I understand what you're saying [noise].  But, I'm saying --

B.54:  I know [laughter]. 

A.55:  -- I feel real sympathy for them.  So, I really, and, and, and by the way,
I feel the same way when I, I just got back from Florida.

B.56:  Um. 

A.57:  And boy, I tell ya, ha-, happily, I can, I can understand just a little bit
of Cuban English. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  Just a little bit. 

B.60:  Um [laughter]. 

A.61:  Which was about all I wanted to understand. 

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  Uh, but, I, it's amazing, because they're, they're bilingual. 

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  Everything is, is Spanish English --

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  -- in Florida.  And I didn't particularly enjoy it,

B.68:  # ((Um)). #

A.69:  # quite # frankly. 

B.70:  At one point, and I cannot say that it's true now, but at one point the
city of Chicago was required by federal law to hire teachers who spoke Spanish
so that they could teach to the, the children there who only spoke Spanish.

A.71:  Yes. 

B.72:  But, this is America and our language is English. 

A.73:  That's right.  And I'm sorry.  That business of making it mandatory, I
don't like mandatory anything.

B.74:  No [laughter]. 

A.75:  Because it just doesn't work all the time.  It doesn't fit,

B.76:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.77:  # there # are circumstances that are different. 

B.78:  Um. 

A.79:  But, I do think if you come to America and you're going to live here and
you're going to go to our schools and do all of this, speak our language. 

B.80:  I think so, too. 

A.81:  I really do.  And it's only fair to the children.  I think making, giving
the children an out that they don't have to speak English, is just encouraging
them to drop out later on, because they'll never make it through high school. 

B.82:  Huh-uh.  Well it's en-,

A.83:  And if they do, it won't make any difference because # there's not a job
for them. #

B.84:  # it's encouraging them to not speak English.  #

A.85:  That's exactly right and that is the wrong message. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  I just, I don't know, I feel so sorry for them, but at the same time,

B.88:  But, that's the same thing you're saying about the little Mexican children
that you feel sorry for them and you would swim the river twice but,

A.89:  # Well, #

B.90:  # I, #

A.91:  I would if it were, if they were my kids,

B.92:  sure,

A.93:  I would. 

B.94:  but,

A.95:  So, I have to sympathize with the people that come over here and work and
send money back. 

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  You know, it's, it's right on the survival,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # level, # and we do what we do to survive. 

B.100:  Absolutely.  And, and I know what you're saying, we do what we have to do
for our children regardl-, regardless of what that is.  But, I'm a little bit
unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five
thousand who have not limited their family.  We have three children and that
happens to be what we could afford.  But, I don't really feel like I ought to
help, even if they're people from Indiana, support ten children.  That's not
fair.  I didn't get a say whether they had them or not, so I don't think I
ought to have to help raise them.  Maybe I'm, uh, too critical.  I, I'm
concerned about world birth control.  And,

A.101:  Oh, I'm, I'm, that's, that's one on me,

B.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.103:  # too.  # I mean there are too many children that are just conceived and
produced and dropped on society --

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  -- without a thought.  These crack babies --

B.106:  Oh, isn't that awful.  I was just reading,

A.107:  # -- are so sad.  #

B.108:  # this thing in the # CHICAGO TRIBUNE yesterday about this little girl who
was a crack baby and she was put in a foster home for five years and was
having a wonderful life.  And then her mother claimed to have her se-, her act
together and she was given back to her birth mother who she had never seen.  I
mean, it was just one of those awful things where the Child Protection Service
completely broke down.  And, now, two years later, the court ordered that she
be given back to the foster people.  I, it's just awful.

A.109:  Doesn't make any, # sense.  #

B.110: # It's # just, awful, the whole thing.  It's just awful.  I, I, as
I say, I'm isolationist.  I think we need to, to close our doors to
some of the immigration.  And now they're talking about how we're
bound to have an influx of immigrants from the latest war, from Iraq,
Iran, Saudi Arabia, so on and so forth.  And, uh, I'm, I'm really
sorry that I feel the way I do, but I just think that we need to not
take people as we have over the man-, last many, many years.

A.111:  Well, we had, ther-, there's a little background here, but, it, it builds
up to what we're talking about.  Our church had a long, long discussion group
and basically the question started out, that as, at the time when there were
starving people in India, I believe.

B.112:  Uh-huh. 

A.113:  And the question was, should we save these people?

B.114:  Yeah. 

A.115:  And, our bottom line answer was no. 

B.116:  Becau-,

A.117:  Because we cannot save the world. 

B.118:  Well, and,

A.119:  We cannot,

B.120:  # [Breathing].  #

A.121:  # feed # the world and we should not please the world. 

B.122:  And I think, probably, they have said that if you save these people by
feeding them, then they reproduce and then you have a later, more,

A.123:  # This, #

B.124:  # serious # famine. 

A.125:  And the other thing is we can feed them today, but they'll be hungry
tomorrow,

B.126:  # Yeah.  #

A.127:  # what'll # we do with them tomorrow?

B.128:  Yeah. 

A.129:  Do we feed them again tomorrow? Well, how long, how long can we continue to
feed the,

B.130:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.131:  # world? # We can't do,

B.132:  Um. 

A.133:  it.  Are they starving to death? Yes.  And that's very,

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  sad.  But, we cannot save them.  W-, you know, okay.  We can save one. 

B.136:  Uh-huh. 

A.137:  And that's good, but what's, you know, I just, back to what you're saying,
if you want to save somebody, there's plenty in the United States that need
it, too.

B.138:  When our children were all three at home.  Our oldest daughter, uh, is
still a very giving, caring, wonderful person.  She's making a career of, uh,
well, she's a director at a care center close to here.  In fact, my mother's a
resident there.  Anyhow, w-, uh, she got us involved in the Christian
Children's Fund, and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
in a home then.  And that went on for, oh, four or five years, and finally we
had a letter from the Christian Children's Fund that they were no longer going
to, uh, sponsor children within the continental United States.  That all of
the money would be going to children overseas because, for however much money
we were sending a month, they could buy so much more milk, and bread, and
rice, and so on and so forth, for children overseas.  Well at,

A.139:  So, they're taking the world viewpoint?

B.140:  Yeah.  Well, at that point we said, no, we're not doing this any more.  We
wanted to help somebody here within the continental United States.  It wasn't
our choice to, to send, and then, too, I think that money gets watered down in
# administrative costs, #

A.141:  # Uh-huh [breathing].  #

B.142:  when it all goes overseas.  And I always wonder if people who need it
actually get it. 

A.143:  But by profession, I negotiate for Texas Instruments a lot.  And I'm
somewhat cynical --

B.144:  Um [laughter]. 

A.145:  -- about humans,

B.146:  # Um.  #

A.147:  # and # their behavior. 

B.148:  Uh-huh. 

A.149:  Because I have had many interesting examples of human behavior. 

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  When you're talking about money you'd be surprised how human we all get,

B.152:  It all # turns different, #

A.153:  # very quickly.  #

B.154:  doesn't it?

A.155:  Uh-huh. 

B.156:  We were,

A.157:  # Um.  #

B.158:  # on # a cruise ship one time and some people from the Methodist Church
were talking about how their church diocese had poured thousands of dollars
into Haiti and it had been used for Papa Doc's daughter's wedding --

A.159:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.160:  -- which,

A.161:  # There you go.  #

B.162:  # [Laughter]  I'm sure # that's not what they had in mind when they were
pouring that money in the,

A.163:  But, see, that's what happens.  And the other sad thing, I heard about the
Kurds {fade out}.
