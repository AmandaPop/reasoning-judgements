@A.1:  Okay, I guess I'll start, um, one, uh, big thing that, the advise that I
would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their, let their
child experience college in a kind of general sense.  I like large colleges
because I went to University of Texas at Austin, they have fifty thousand
students there.  And I feel like that now if I went, if I had gone to a small
college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have, have gotten as
much exposure to different people and different, uh, I don't know, different
languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those
fifty thousand students. 

B.2:  That's interesting, I went to a smaller school,

A.3:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.4:  # [Throat_clearing]  # of probably three thousand, thirty-five hundred. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  And I, I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one
since we seemed to know everyone on campus,

A.7:  # Huh.  #

B.8:  # and # we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds,

A.9:  # {Very faint} Huh.  #

B.10:  # and so forth, # so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not
so much a number,

A.11:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.12:  # um, # one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand,

A.13:  # Right.  #

B.14:  # and, # and, you know,

A.15:  # {Very faint}  Uh-huh.# 

B.16:  # different perspectives, #

A.17:  # {Very faint} Yeah.  #

B.18:  # I, uh, but # it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort
of, sort of thing. 

A.19:  Yeah, I, I could see, I could see that point, I could see how it would be. 
I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, um, because like we would have biology
classes that did, main courses that everyone has to take, I mean, hundreds of
students in this class, so,

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # actually, # yes, you were a number.  But, um, I, I just, I don't know, I'm
thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.  It just seems like in a
larger college you, I don't know, your exposed to so many more people from all
over the world, and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges
also but just that they're more of, of the different cultures there,

B.22:  # Uh-huh, yeah.  #

A.23:  # not that # it's, not that it's better but I'm just saying that I think
that big,

B.24:  That's one thing to definitely consider. 

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I think, uh, a lot of, a lot of students now would probably
be afraid of a smaller college, a lot of the students that I talked to even here
in Waco they go to Baylor, um, they, or they're considering going to Baylor,
they're also considering going to U T Austin but one of the big no-nos is
because of the fifty thousand students, and I have to tell them that just like,
just like I live in Waco it's a large city, [barking],  I can still function,
[barking],  in my own kind of area, in my own group.  I have a job, I have my
friends,

B.26:  # Uh-huh [barking].  #

A.27:  # and I'm # really not as, as concerned about the entire city, so when you
go to a big, a big university, you're not as concerned [barking],  about the
entire university,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # but # your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and
things like that. 

B.30:  I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school,

A.31:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.32:  # but # what, what is the particular needs of the students and whereas some
would immediately feel very comfortable in this, um, larger university setting,

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.34:  # some # of the students, um, when I was, when I was teaching school would
not have been comfortable with that. 

A.35:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

B.36:  They needed, uh, at least at first,

A.37:  # Uh-huh, right.  #

B.38:  # they needed # a smaller setting that, that was more like family where they
could get one-on-one,

A.39:  # Right.  #

B.40:  # from, # from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or
two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, where, when they had a little
more self-confidence built up, oh, yes, I can do this, oh, I've done this
before, it's just in a bigger setting,

A.41:  # Right.  #

B.42:  # and # so maybe to me the key would be wh-, what is a chi-, the, the
students needs,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # and # what, what school or schools can best meet those, those needs
besides education yo-, yo-, you can expect all of them with, uh, a-, a-,
accreditat-, accreditation to give the education but it's these other things
that you and I are, are keying off on,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # that, # that are really more of an education that, but they're the things
that don't show up in,

A.47:  On paper. 

B.48:  That's right, that's right. 

A.49:  Uh-huh, exactly.  That's, that's one important thing that I think about
school.  I'm, I'm not a kind a person that, I didn't, I, I was kind of a B
student, I guess you'd say, and I didn't really, I was tur-, I strived to be an
A student but it wasn't like a real priority. 

B.50:  Right. 

A.51:  To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be
[laughter],  getting into as many organizations as I possibly could, and, and
one other point I was going to make, was that I can un-, I ((can)) see that
probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends,

B.52:  # Huh.  #

A.53:  # because # you, like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows
everybody,

B.54:  # Yeah.  #

A.55:  # and # so, you probably come out of it knowing, and by friends, I mean,
like contacts for when you get out of school, um, you know, you just, you may
walk into a company and see someone you went to school with,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # more # so at a small college then a large college. 

B.58:  Yeah. 

A.59:  You may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't, you wouldn't know
them.  Uh, I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you
look into college, um,

B.60:  I guess, I guess now I've been out for, I, I'm older than you.  I've been
out for twenty-one years. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  And I was looking at an annual last night, something had sp-, it sparked a
question, and I went to a small private school,

A.63:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.64:  # um, # and it was church related. 

A.65:  Uh-huh. 

B.66:  And I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine,

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.68:  # and # I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from
here and I've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty
years, where I go to church now, there are five other people that went to school
at the same time in the same class as I,

A.69:  # Wow.  #

B.70:  # and # it's, it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back
that some of the same memories if not the same education in,

A.71:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.72:  # you # know, we weren't all out to be teachers or, or whatever so we didn't
have the same classes, but we had a common thread,

A.73:  # Right.  #

B.74:  # something # that still ties us together,

A.75:  # Wow.  #

B.76:  # twenty # odd years later. 

A.77:  That's great. 

B.78:  And it's, it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things,
those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt
at T I,

A.79:  # Right, right.  #

B.80:  # I have # something more important to me than that. 

A.81:  That's great, that's great.  Yeah, that's what I, that's basically what I,
and, when I first, I've been out of college ((only)) two years now, [laughter], 
so it's still pretty fresh on my memory,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # um, # but now that I'm out, when I went into school, my parents told,
well, my, okay, let me, let me go back to my, my sister now is in college,

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.85:  # and # my father was really interested in getting her in a school that
would look good on her, on her, uh, diploma, etcetera,

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.87:  # and # so forth, and, and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a
larger school, and it was just a big conflict between us because my father
wanted the academics and I wanted her to get the life experience,

B.88:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.89:  # out # of it, and so it was, you know, she went the academic way because
she's a straight A student, which is,

B.90:  # I was going to ask who won [laughter].  #

A.91:  # yes, yeah, so, she, you know, that's probably, # you know, what she, what
she wants anyway but that was the big deal and,

B.92:  In, in that case, uh, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it
sounds like she was going for what she needed,

A.93:  # Right.  #

B.94:  # and # finding a school that, that met her specific requirements,

A.95:  # Right.  #

B.96:  # and, # and made the best fit for her. 

A.97:  And that, that's another point is that, the, a parent should tell their
child to be or, or to give their child the leeway to choose their school,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # not # so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them
along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to
do. 

B.100:  I think it helps, a, now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to, uh,
what's now U T Arlington,

A.101:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.102:  # because # it was there in my hometown, I could live at home. 

A.103:  Right. 

B.104:  But I chose to go to another school and even though he was pleased that it
was a church related school, he was not willing to pay any at all even the same
amount of money,

A.105:  # Huh.  #

B.106:  # and # I think I value my, my education more because I had to work for it. 

A.107:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.108:  And because I knew all along that's what I wanted,

A.109:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # eve-, even though # I had to buck the family in order to, to do what I
needed to do.  So,

A.111:  {Very faint} Right.  Well, that was pretty courageous [laughter]. 

B.112:  Um, I guess, I guess it was, it was my mother's support that got me through
it,

A.113:  # Yeah.  #

B.114:  # that # and ten years of, of, uh, loans [laughter], 

A.115:  # Oh, yeah, yeah.  #

B.116:  # after I got # out [laughter]. 

A.117:  I'm, I'm dealing with the loans right now, so, so. 

B.118:  Sounds familiar, huh? Your, it's very fresh in your memory. 

A.119:  Oh, yes, very, every, every month [laughter]. 

B.120:  I,

A.121:  That memory just seeps back in my mailbox. 

B.122:  Yeah, well, sorry about that ((Tanya)) [laughter]. 

A.123:  Oh, well, I guess I'll get over it. 

B.124:  I'm sure it was worth it though. 

A.125:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay. 

B.126:  If, if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,

A.127:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.128:  # if # nothing else just those experiences beyond and, and including your
educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # whatever # you set your mind on,

A.131:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.132:  # and the, you, # you made the right choice in going to a school that met
all of your needs to make, to give you the, the potential to do whatever you
wanted. 

A.133:  Right, because when you, when you do want, when you do finally graduate
that, that's what you need the most.  I'm finding out now that what I'm needing
the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage,
uh, (( )),

B.134:  # Young lady, #

A.135:  # words, it, #

B.136:  you have gotten your education then, that, that's right. 

A.137:  Yes, I'm needing, you know, my, I'm needing to rely on myself,

B.138:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

A.139:  And I think I learned a lot of that in school too.
