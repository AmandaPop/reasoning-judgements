==========================================================================

A.1:  Hi.

B.2:  Th-, this is going to be very bo-, boring, because I don't.

A.3:  You don't, at all?

B.4:  No. And, uh, unfortunately it shows.  I, uh, I'm supposed to.  I'm way
overweight but, uh, I've had a problem with, uh, high blood pressure which of
course, is directly connected to it,

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  and my doctor's trying to get my blood pressure under control before I
start in any exercising.

A.7:  Or too much of it, yeah, yeah, you need,

B.8:  So anyway I did join the, uh, uh, the Texins up at, uh, uh, Springcreek.

A.9:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.10:  And I've been up there a few times, but didn't accomplish too much because
I just run down too quick.

A.11:  Yeah, I haven't been up there, um, but, I understand they've got a nice
pool and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming.

B.12:  Uh, that would have to be mine.  I hate exercising, it's so boring.

A.13:  [Laughter] Really.

B.14:  Uh, I would much prefer to like walk through the woods.

A.15:  Oh, yeah, most of my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old
and a two year old.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And, uh, running after them or going biking with them, or just exploring,
you know, on a little explor-, exploration hike, you know, through the
neighborhood.  It's amazing, you know, how many earthworms you can find and,

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  and to a five year old, they're, they never get old.  You know, an
earthworm every single time she finds one it's, uh, it's a brand new exciting
activity for her.

B.20:  Isn't it amazing.

A.21:  Uh-huh, it really is.

B.22:  Well, we, um, back when m-, my, I have four sons, they're all grown now
and, and two of them are married with children of their own, but, [breathing]
when they were just, uh, preteen-agers,

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  we, uh, we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go
camping.

A.25:  Oh, yeah, isn't it great.

B.26:  And we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I mean we went whole hog.  We had the
tents and everything else and, and pretty much roughed it,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  sleeping on the ground and all.  And, uh, I like to think that my
children, my sons learned a lot about, uh, the outdoors, uh, uh, being
self-sustaining.

A.29:  [Noise] Uh-huh. 

B.30:  Uh, uh, I would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be
[static] dropped in the middle of no where and they'd they'd ex-, exist
somehow.

A.31:  Well that's neat.  My, uh, my husband was, uh, was a boy scout and he, uh,
actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in The Order of The Arrow.
And he, absolutely, uh, you know the earth is, is part of him and he is part
of it and I think that's a real important thing and we, we enjoy going
camping.  We haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground, primarily because to
them, uh, or to the five year old, the two year old would freak out about it,
but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved, but the five year old still has a
fear of spiders.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And I'm afraid that if she woke up one with her, we would have to pack up
and come home [laughter].

B.34:  Oh wow, we-, okay that is understandable.

A.35:  So we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls, up in
Oklahoma.

B.36:  Oh yes, I'm very familiar with it.  Very beautiful place.

A.37:  Isn't that a beautiful place.

B.38:  I've been up there several times.

A.39:  Well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders, 

B.40:  Oh, what a shame.

A.41:  because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time.  We, we, you know
we had never seen one, or she had never seen one, we, my husband and I had,
but sh-, we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for
the longest time.  It was, you know, removed from us by probably five or six
feet, so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we
explained, you know, how it did.  Well that night she had a nightmare and she
has been terrified of spiders since.  But we still go up there, and we still
have a great time.

B.42:  Uh-huh, well good, I'm glad to hear that.  About the only thing, uh, I
might suggest is, uh, do the same thing again.  Introduce her to a, to a
spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  and, uh, and th-, the, the nightmare I'm sure was just a, a freak, I'll
bet it wouldn't happen again.

A.45:  I think not.  Ye-, I think it was, you know being in a new place, being
kind of out of, out of sorts, and everything all combined, but, we, uh,
that's, you know, that's our favorite form of exercise is, is life.  And we do
our own yard [laughter], you know.  We, uh, we, we enjoy the activities that
provide exercise.  Both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but
our life doesn't, um, really have that much time in it, so we just enjoy what
we can along with our family, you know.

B.46:  Well tha-, you couldn't pick a better way of doing it, 

A.47:  Well.

B.48:  with your family.  

A.49:  Yeah we have, uh, 

B.50:  And, an, y-, you're certainly all getting an education, while you're doing
this exercise.  

A.51:  That's kind of how we feel about it, we can't, you know, there's, th-,
there's things that, uh, the only thing that is forever is the earth, well,
[laughter] we hope it's forever.

B.52:  As far as we're concerned.

A.53:  Yeah, and, uh, and, you know, therefore, i-, you know, the girls can learn
things in school about everything that is temporary, but as far as really
knowing the earth, there's no other way to really learn it but to experience
it.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And we really have a great time with it.  I'm sure that's the way that you
felt with your boys. 

B.56:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  It was a learning experience, uh, now we, I
guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida.

A.57:  Oh, and Florida's absolutely wonderful for that, I understand, I've, I've
never lived there.

B.58:  Oh yes, yes.  Well they used to be but now they're trying to really put it
to the, the, the, uh, visitors.  I think they're doing a very stupid thing. 

A.59:  Oh with Walt Disney World and,

B.60:  Well, they charge extra now, they, there was a time here a few years ago
when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the, uh, motels and
hotels.

A.61:  Um.

B.62:  So they are, are, uh, you know, really putting it to the visitors and
people got a little fed up with it and they su-, and suddenly the, the,
foundling fathers of, uh, of Florida found out that they were losing
beaucoup bucks.

A.63:  By not, 

B.64:  People were going elsewhere for, uh, their vacations.

A.65:  They were trying to turn it too much into a business.

B.66:  Exactly, so they got rid of that tax in a hurry. 

A.67:  Oh, that's good.  We've uh, not been brave enough yet to brave that trip
with these, with the two small children [laughter].  I mean, you know, in the
car.

B.68:  Uh, ye-, I can appreciate that.

A.69:  It's, it's, uh, it's you know, getting up to Turner Falls, or, uh, up to
Lake Murray is about as far as we've really tried to go in a car.  We have
gone down and, uh, uh, gone down to the (( )) New Braunfels, uh, San-, well we
were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio,

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  and, uh, we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way,
but, um, you know that's, that's pretty much as far as we've tried with
little ones.

B.72:  Well the, the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and
run.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  Now, uh, I'm alone now myself and, and I, I have graduated from sleeping
on the ground to, uh, going in a motor home.

A.75:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.76:  Well the fact, I live in it.  And there's just my dog and I.  Now my dog
is a wonderful traveler, but I do have to stop for her quite frequently.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  And it works out fine, I mean, I stop.  I'm never in a hurry to get
anywhere.

A.79:  And no reason to be.

B.80:  Like it takes me two days to get to Memphis.

A.81:  And that's, that's not terribly far.

B.82:  No, it's, uh, it's about an eight or nine hour drive really.

A.83:  Yeah, yeah.

B.84:  But, uh, I make it in two days because I, I don't push it.

A.85:  Well there's so many neat places along the way, I mean, you've got
Arkansas, you know [laughter].

B.86:  Oh definitely, oh absolutely.

A.87:  and, 

B.88:  Incidentally, oh, I can't remember the name of that place, there's a
beautiful park up there and they do have a, uh, uh, oh, sort of a hotel, a
lodge, a lodge, that's what it is.  

A.89:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.90:  And it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it, because they
have playgrounds for the children and all.  And they have, uh, several nature
trails.

A.91:  It's just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs?

B.92:  It's just below Hot Springs.

A.93:  Okay.

B.94:  Oh -- 

A.95:  Well that wouldn't even be a very far drive.

B.96:  -- it's lake something.

A.97:  I'm not, I, I ought to look into it, uh, because we were kind of, e-,
entertaining the thought of taking a, uh, you know like just a five or six day
trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:   And I, 

B.100:  Well the next time you go across the state line, or when you come back in,
be sure and stop at one of the Texas Welcome Bureaus and ask them for their
literature on, th-, the, uh, state national parks in the state of Texas.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  And you'll, you'll get a collection from them, th-, you wouldn't believe
there were so many parks in the state.

A.103:  I probably wouldn't and I've lived here all of my life. 

B.104:  Well, it, it, there, there are so many, for instan-, have you ever been
out to Tyler State Park?

A.105:  Oh yes, I have, I have been to Tyler.  That was one place we went when I
was a child.

B.106:  Ok-, all right, yo-,

A.107:  We've not taken our children, though.

B.108:  There's a place to take them, and, uh, oh good heavens up there, just this
side of Tex-, Texoma, not Texoma, uh, 

A.109:  Uh-huh, Texarkana?

B.110:  Texarkana.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:   There are three or four state parks up there.  

A.113:  We ought to head out.  We, uh, 

B.114:  A-, and they're all great.  And, and again, there's the nature trails,

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  {Pause} for your exercising.

A.117:  Right.

B.118:  We almost forgot our subject of the day there.

A.119:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.120:  But be sure and stop at one of those Texas bur-, Tourist Bureaus and get
their literature.

A.121:  Yeah, well I certainly will.

B.122:  [Cough].

A.123:  Jack it's been real, it's been real, uh, informative for me to talk with
you and I, I certainly enjoyed it.

B.124:  Well, it's been my pleasure, uh, Gina.  Gina, is that with a G.

A.125:  Uh-huh, it sure is.

B.126:  Th-, that's, uh, uh, Italian heritage, isn't it.

A.127:  I don't have any Italian heritage, my mother actually chose it because of
Gina ...
