==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, I, I think our experience of camping is, I, I am the, the
passive member, I get things ready and then I enjoy.

B.2:  Uh-huh. 

A.3:  Uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper and so they, he manages the
troops and they do the work and I have fun [laughter]. 

B.4:  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was gro-, uh, all grown
up now, how about when they were younger, did you go cam-, take them camping?

A.5:  That's when we camped the most. 

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  When, I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,

B.8:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

A.9:  # I, # it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just, uh,
was really overworked, you know, and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,

B.10:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.11:  # and # having the family do a good share of the work, you know, and the
part that I did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the
running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you
know. 

B.12:  Yeah bu-, e-, even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't
it. 

A.13:  It is, isn't it.  It isn't.  Ha-, what kinds of things have you tried? Have
you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?

B.14:  Oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking
back when we first started and we found that the, you know, what was one, one
great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper. 

A.15:  Oh, yeah. 

B.16:  Because all you needed was a big frying pan,

A.17:  # Big frying p-, #

B.18:  # you dumped everything # in together and it was enough for all five of us,
six of us. 

A.19:  Oh, that's interesting.  You know, interesting enough, uh, the food part
was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping.  Uh, when my oldest son, uh,
always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.  But the, the
neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit
badge in, and, and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff and,
uh,

B.20:  # Oh.  #

A.21:  # I # mean, you know, he did it up really good [laughter].  And so, uh,
after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting
ready for it. 

B.22:  Well that's great. 

A.23:  It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to
do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do.  And we did a lot of
interesting kinds of things like I would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan
inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  And it works real good.  It's like an oven. 

B.26:  # Well, #

A.27:  # Just # put, uh, put a thing on it. 

B.28:  cooking was our secondary interest, I mean. 

A.29:  What did you like to do most? 

B.30:  Well really just commune with nature. 

A.31:  That's neat isn't it?

B.32:  We started out, uh, well we were living in Florida at the time and we,
early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be
very, very expensive.

A.33:  Right.  I agree. 

B.34:  So my ex decided, we're going to try camping and she went out one day on
the spur of the moment and bought a tent.

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  And that's how we got started. 

A.37:  # Huh.  #

B.38:  # We # did it for years and years, uh. 

A.39:  Well now in Florida, is ther-, is there ti-, are there times of the year
when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot. 

B.40:  Well, ye-, uh, yes and no.  I mean, um, ye-, in the winter time yes, it's,
it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly. 

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  But, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go. 

A.43:  # Oh, is that true?# 

B.44:  # Uh, becau-, #

A.45:  Now, now we're, we're in Texas now and you're in Texas, right. 

B.46:  Yes, I'm in Dallas. 

A.47:  Okay, uh, we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of
the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable
camping. 

B.48:  Well, it just depends on where you go, for instance,

A.49:  # I gue-, #

B.50:  # if you # went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze
blowing in from the water. 

A.51:  Yeah, yeah, we have done that [breathing].  But, but we camped mostly, when
the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and w-,

B.52:  Oh, where abouts?

A.53:  Uh, in, uh, Allendale and, uh, and, uh, Waldwick, it's just about twelve
miles south of, the New York border. 

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so, you know, pick
your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast
[laughter].

B.56:  Oh yes, yes, ye-,

A.57:  Uh, also,

B.58:  # I co-, #

A.59:  # go ahead.  #

B.60:  I come from up in that area, I'm a New Yorker myself. 

A.61:  Oh, are you? Where did you live? 

B.62:  A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains. 

A.63:  Oh, oh yeah, I know that.  I had a cousin who lived in White Plains, that's
a, that's a neat area.  But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for
camping because,

B.64:  Well that I wouldn't know I left there when I was quite young. 

A.65:  Yeah, it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,
you don't have to go very far.

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh,
hiking sort of things and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper,
little clipper sail boat. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  And so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way. 

B.70:  Well, uh, me, I outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents,

A.71:  # [Breathing].  #

B.72:  # and # I now have a motor home. 

A.73:  Oh, do you.  We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun,
too, I think. 

B.74:  Well I live in mine. 

A.75:  Do you?

B.76:  Yes. 

A.77:  That's neat, so you kind of, uh, uh, an everyday camper [laughter]. 

B.78:  Uh, well, yes I consider myself what they call a full-timer. 

A.79:  A full time camper. 

B.80:  Yeah th-,

A.81:  Well now, are you living alone now, or,

B.82:  Ye-, well just me and my dog. 

A.83:  You and your dog, huh, [laughter]. 

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  Hey, that sounds great.  Well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we
used to, but, uh, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your
family,

B.86:  # Oh yes, definitely.  #

A.87:  # and enjoy nature # and, uh, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life.
I'd always,

B.88:  # Nothing like the fresh outdoors.  #

A.89:  # right, I'd always come home # just relaxed and, uh, comfortable and ready
to go at it again, so it was a neat activity.  Good to talk to you.  Tell me
your name again. 

B.90:  Jack. 

A.91:  Jack,

B.92:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.93:  # all # right.

A.95:  Ye-, yes, we've been here, we're, we're in Plano,

B.96:  # Oh! #

A.97:  # but # we've been here about, uh, eighteen years. 

B.98:  Well that's where we, that's where I am, Plano. 

A.99:  Are you, are you, how about that.  Well we're all, lots of people from T I
