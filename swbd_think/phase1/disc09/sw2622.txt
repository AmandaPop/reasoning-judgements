========================================================================

B.1:  So, uh, what do you think? [Laughter]. 

A.2:  I think we're overtaxed to the hilt. 

B.3:  Yeah. 

A.4:  Yeah, I mean, we're, we're taxed on taxes and, um, uh, most all government
entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have
it that is.  I mean we don't have one yet, but eventually they may try to push
it through. 

B.5:  Oh really.  So they have n-, I didn't realize they had no state tax in
Texas. 

A.6:  No, no state income tax. 

B.7:  Oh, that's great, because they don't have it in Florida.  In New York they
have it. 

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York and we have a state tax as
well.  So that just cuts even more. 

A.10:  Yeah, I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending
habits. 

B.11:  Right, I, I think that I, I mean, I wouldn't be so upset about the amount
of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't, they don't go to any
place.  You know, y-, you don't see it going to any place where it belongs.

A.12:  Right. 

B.13:  I think if it were to be, uh, if it were to be, um, if it were to be,
[whispering]  hold, hold on a second please, someone just walked in the ro-,

A.14:  Yeah. 

B.15:  [Rattling]  If, if it were to be spent in the right way I think I wouldn't
be so upset about it, but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think
it's a major problem. 

A.16:  Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local,

B.17:  #Uh-huh {softly}.#

A.18:  #that it# takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole
lot you can always do with your paycheck. 

B.19:  Well that's certainly true.  Well what is it they were just talking about,
um, sort of middle income, you know, how, how, middle income people, what
winds up happening is, for instance having kids, you know, they wind up having
kids as a deduction and after, but the deduction is so little for kids that
they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the
year or something.

A.20:  Uh-huh. 

B.21:  I think tha-, so they want to, you know try an-, I think they're trying, I
think tha-, I think that most of the politicians understand this.  They just
don't, they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing. 

A.22:  Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the
special interest groups as well. 

B.23:  Right. 

A.24:  And, uh, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a, a better
tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms. 

B.25:  Uh-huh. 

A.26:  And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody. 

B.27:  I agree, I agree. 

A.28:  And, uh, I don't know how we're going to do that right away though, but,
what, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking,
uh, a bite out of our savings. 

B.29:  Right, exactly, and then, and then, uh, I'm, I'm just not sure if I see,
you know, if I see it going, like I say to the right places.  I mean, it'd be,
it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you
were getting it all back when you got older.

A.30:  Yeah. 

B.31:  You know, but I'm not convinced, that's, a-, tha-, that Social Security is
doing as well as it should and, you know, and, and, and, uh, and, and that,
you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need
it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need
it.  But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be
getting it but instead I think it's going to the wrong places.

A.32:  And I believe the Social Security tax is a great (( )) scheme. 

B.33:  You think so?

A.34:  Yeah, it's, uh, you know, right now, they're robbing from it to pad the
federal deficit. 

B.35:  I know and that scares the hell out of me. 

A.36:  Yeah, tha-, that's illegal, see.  If, uh, most company, uh, C E O -s were
to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.

B.37:  Yeah [door]. 

A.38:  [Laughter] So how are we letting them get away with it. 

B.39:  Yeah, I don't, I don't, well becau-, because they're the ones who make the
laws. 

A.40:  Right. 

B.41:  So who's going to yell at them, you know, it'd be nice if we sort of, as
one, band together and, and, uh, and, an performed a citizens arrest, I guess. 

A.42:  #Yeah.#

B.43:  #To# see if we could sort of clean them up and you know, but I don't know
if we can do that or not. 

A.44:  A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just
the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose
a lot of the situations going on,

B.45:  #Uh-huh.#

A.46:  #in# the taxing system. 

B.47:  I agree, I agree.  But, um, yeah, like, like you said, I wonder, you know,
if, if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and I wonder if
it'll ever be a change process. 

A.48:  Yeah. 

B.49:  I sort of, I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that
I think are wrong [breathing] [laughter].  You know, all those things that
really could be changed that aren't, you know, that, that aren't.  And tax is
one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list. 

A.50:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.51:  So, I don't kno-, I, I, I have no idea what to do about it. 

A.52:  Well there's no quick solution, or no sure fire easy answer.  It's just
going to take, uh, uh, really, uh, uh, uh, a combination effort, I think, of
the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer,

B.53:  #[Door].#

A.54:  #or# vote to limit the way it's spent. 

B.55:  #Yeah.#

A.56:  #See,# we, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the
first place. 

B.57:  Right.  We don't, I mean, the only say so we have is supposedly by electing
people who we think are going to vote one way of another. 

A.58:  Right and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do. 

B.59:  Right, I've never quite understood that.  I've never, uh, you know, even
though, um, I, I've never been, uh, sort of politically minded, but it's never
been clear to me as to sort of, um, you know, how Congressmen an, can, can just
sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly
their constituency doe-, doesn't back them up on anything, you know.  And often
times that will happen. 

A.60:  Well they feel invu-, invulnerable to, uh, any wrath or,

B.61:  #Right [clicking].#

A.62:  #uh, it's,# it's occurred so many times that they figure people will
usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises. 

B.63:  Right. 

A.64:  And generally it does work out that way. 

B.65:  They do forget, it's true, coul-, because everybody, think of what happens
is whenever the politici-, whenever th-, the one who made that supposed mistake
turns around and, uh, his, his or her opponent can say well look, they did
this.  And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this. 

A.66:  Uh-huh. 

B.67:  So it becomes, uh, a general battle of the w-, sort of the election of the
lesser of two evils, I think, so. 

A.68:  Yeah. 

B.69:  I don't know, I just, uh, I'm unhappy with it but.  And well, I'm, I'm sort
of semifortunate right now, I'm a graduate student, so I don't make that much,

A.70:  #Uh-huh.#

B.71:  #and# what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school. 

A.72:  Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know. 

B.73:  But it's, my, my, my wife has a real job and, you know, when I get her job,
um, you know, we, we look at her paycheck, I'm just floored when I see how
little of it we're actually allowed to keep. 

A.74:  Yeah. 

B.75:  [Door]  Especially around bonus time. 

A.76:  Bonus time, you have a bonus?

B.77:  Bonus, she, no, my, my wife does. 

A.78:  Oh. 

B.79:  My wi-, I don-, no graduate students don't get bonuses. 

A.80:  Uh-huh. 

B.81:  We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure. 

A.82:  So you're taxed on the bonuses too, right. 

B.83:  My, my wife is taxed on her bonus as well, and that's a, that's usually a
big chunk of her bonus check actually. 

A.84:  Uh-huh. 

B.85:  I mean her bonus isn't that much, but they tax it as, I, I guess they tax
it as if that were her weekly check or something.

A.86:  Uh-huh. 

B.87:  So she gets destroyed on her bonus check. 

A.88:  Uh-huh. 

B.89:  So, she works with in, in, in sales.  So a good portion of her, you know,
her salary is, is quarterly bonuses. 

A.90:  Uh, sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're
doing a lucrative job. 

B.91:  Yes, well, yeah, she's not entirely sales, so it isn't, it isn't as
lucrative as one would hope, but, it, it keeps us supported temporarily,

A.92:  #Uh-huh.#

B.93:  #until# I can get a real salary and then get taxed more.  So, I don't
know, I d-, I guess, I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to
have to live with it, [breathing] and hope that it gets better [door]. 

A.94:  Yeah.  Well, I have, I guess about said what a-, all I can think of to say.

B.95:  Same here, tough topic so. 

A.96:  Yeah, it's re-, a rather touchy topic at that, but [laughter]. 

B.97:  I beli-, I, I, I do agree with you, most, most wholeheartedly. 

A.98:  Well that's great. 

B.99:  It's been a pleasure talking with you. 

A.100:  You too, and, uh,

B.101:  #Thanks for call.#

A.102:  #have a good# day. 

B.103:  You too.  Bye-bye.
