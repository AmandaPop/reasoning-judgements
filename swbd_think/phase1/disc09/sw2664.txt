===========================================================================

@B.1:  It's about this rap crap.

A.2:  [Laughter] Uh, yeah.

B.3:  Uh, it, uh, uh, do you get it?

A.4:  Um, not really, not really.  I've, uh,

B.5:  [Laughter].

A.6:  I, uh, I'm forty years old now, so I've,

B.7:  So am I, so we're talking the same language.

A.8:  Yeah, we, uh, we grew up with the same music,

B.9:  [Laughter].

A.10:  and I just, uh, I heard what they call, around here they have a thing they
call, uh, oh, what are they, uh, it's a spoof on the song, and the song was,
um, you, you've heard of the song DANCE TO THE MUSIC, you remember that.

B.11:  Oh, yeah.

A.12:  Okay, well they did a, uh, a, uh, twisted tune, they call it, and the
twisted tune was RAP ISN'T MUSIC.

B.13:  Yeah, indeed.

A.14:  And they, they sang here, [singing] RAP ISN'T MUSIC [laughter],

B.15:  [Laughter].

A.16:  to the tune of, you know, DANCE TO THE MUSIC.

B.17:  And to the music.

A.18:  It was pretty funny.

B.19:  Wow, that's terrific.  Well, I just don't get, you know, like I remember
when we were growing up, how, you know, the Beatles, and, and, and, Pres-, you
know, how they were all condemned and rock and roll was the devil's music and
it wouldn't last and all that.

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  You know, I keep thinking that, you know, i-, i-, uh, uh, ar-, are we doing
the same thing with this rap stuff.  I mean, a-, at least with rock and roll
it took talent [laughter].

A.22:  [Laughter] That's true, that's true.  Now if you can just, uh, make a rhyme
and sometimes not even a good one, you know, you,

B.23:  Yeah, you know, all you got to do is, is, you know, I, it just amazes me.

A.24:  And you don't even need a band because you can just use that, uh, crazy
little radio to keep time for you.

B.25:  Yes, a scratchy record, you know.

A.26:  Oh, God, yes.  I, I mean, I, I can tolerate a lot of different things, and,
I can, you know, I can tolerate a certain amount of rap, but if I have to
listen to two songs in a row, I'm ready to shoot somebody.

B.27:  Yeah, really.  It, it, I, I just don't get it, course I guess that dates
us.  It means you are forty.

A.28:  Yeah, that, that must be it.

B.29:  [Laughter].

A.30:  Um, my, I get a real kick out of the, uh, these remakes of the old songs
that we grew up with.

B.31:  Oh, yeah, now that, that I do enjoy, yeah, you know, and I've been hearing
a lot more of it lately, too.

A.32:  Yeah, it makes you think that all the, uh, singer song writers are running
out of, you know, things to write about.

B.33:  Well, you know, uh, uh, I know that somewhere, you know, I mean, we were
really fortunate, because, you know, we, we had, you know, the times of the
Beatles and, and, and things like that.  I mean, you know, that music, I
really think the Beatles' music will probably last, you know.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  Yeah.  It, it, they're immortal.  But, uh, I just really don't know if, uh,
what is it, R B Q, or whatever that, [laughter] I don't even know, run, run,
something, [talking] {voice in background says run, D and C} uh,

A.36:  Run, D,

B.37:  Run, D and C.  Yes.  Run, I mean, uh, uh.

A.38:  It'll never be elevator music, let's put it that way [laughter].

B.39:  No exactly.  You know, is it going to be picked up by a symphony, you
know, [laughter] and,

A.40:   Yeah, I know, and you, you'll, you'll never hear it in the,
uh, the restaurants --

B.41:   No.

A.42:   -- and the,

B.43:  Well, I don't know, maybe you will, but, uh, you know, it, it, [chiming] it
just doesn't translate, there is no melody --

A.44:  Yeah.

B.45:  -- you know, it, it, it's {makes vocal sounds supposed to be like rap}.

A.46:  [Laughter].

B.47:  You know, just [laughter] give me shelter.

A.48:  I've, I've found that as I've gotten older that, that some of even the hard
rock has started to, to bother me, and it,

B.49:  Well, uh, the hard rock from your time.  

A.50:  Uh, no, no.

B.51:  From our time?

A.52:  No, from this new (( )).

B.53:  Yeah, yeah, okay, well, okay.  I, I agree with you.  I don't have any
trouble with, you know, uh, uh, with, with Zeppelin stuff.

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  I don't have any trouble with, uh, uh, y-, y-, you know, stuff that, that
Santana or, or, or, or Hendrix.  I don't have any trouble with that.

A.56:  Yeah, me either.

B.57:  But I have trouble with, with this new crap.  Uh, well, uh, like I say,
well, we-, we've done nothing but, but prove our age today.

A.58:  [Laughter].

B.59:  [Laughter].

A.60:  Yeah, but it's fun to prove your age.  Um, I, I get the biggest kick out of
my, I have two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old living at home, and,
uh, they hear one of these old remakes of a song, and oh that's just a
beautiful song, and I'm like, that's a remake.  They, that song's twenty years
old.

B.61:  Yeah, really.

A.62:  {Imitates another person talking} Oh no.  It just came out.  That's called
music.

B.63:  [Laughter] Well, then what you do, is you go, you know, and you find the
original, and you play it for them.  And luckily, it, it, of course I, I, I,
have been been divorced, but, uh, my, my, my first wife has that first
collection of songs that you could probably prove them with.

A.64:  Well, we've got, uh, four cases of albums downstairs, and then we've got
another case,

B.65:  Oh, I'm sure you probably have a lot of those, then.

A.66:  Oh, yes, we do.  We've got some songs that will totally blow my children
away.

B.67:  Oh yeah.

A.68:  Uh, we've, the problem we've been having is that we have, a, uh, an old
Fisher system and can't find a needle for it, you know, because they're not
pressing,

B.69:  Oh, yeah, oh, wow, I bet that really is a problem, finding a stylus,
because turntables are going the way of the, of the, of the,

A.70:  Yeah, horse and buggy.

B.71:  Yeah.  Something.

A.72:  Yeah, so I'm hoping that we can locate one soon and once I do locate a
source, I'm going to buy about twelve of them.

B.73:  Yeah, uh, yeah, I suggest you latch onto them.  You know, uh, I was just
trying to think, uh, I can suggest something to you.  You might look at, are
you familiar with Crutchfield?

A.74:  Um, I've heard of it.

B.75:  Uh, Crutchfield Electronics.  They also have a catalog, and I've found,
I've got Beta machines, and finding hi-fi beta tape has become almost
impossible.

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  Well, I found that I can get it through them.  They have a lot of, you
know, stuff that, that, that, uh, that you may be able to order through them.
So if you have access to a computer, or anything like that, you might get one
of them like Comp U Serve.  I think Comp U Serve has Crutchfield.  So you can
get on with them and, and, uh, and you know, and get one of their catalogs.

A.78:  Great, I'll try that out.  I really, uh, I really do want to dig out the
old L P -s.

B.79:  Yeah, if, if you, if you have access to a computer and one of the
information services, I would suggest that that's the way you go.

A.80:  Yeah, because I've got everything from God, back when, I've got all of Bill
Cosby's original comedy albums.

B.81:  You've got the real, wow, far out.  

A.82:  And, I've even got old silver throat.  That's the one album that he sang
on.

B.83:  Oh really.  I didn't know that he sang on any of them.

A.84:  Yeah, he's horrible singer.  I listened to it one time, that was it.

B.85:  Uh, all right.

A.86:  And, I've, I've got stuff,

B.87:  Listen, it's been a pleasure.  I'm getting ready for STAR TREK, THE NEXT
GENERATION [laughter].

A.88:  Uh.

B.89:  It's coming on in two minutes.  So.

A.90:  All right.

B.91:  I've enjoyed talking with you, but I got to have my priorities.

A.92:  Yeah, I know, well, it's been nice talking to you, too.

B.93:  All right. Take care.

A.94:  All right, you too.  Bye-bye.

B.95:  Bye-bye.
