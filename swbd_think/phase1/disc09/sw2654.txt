============================================================================


A.1:  [Tone] Unfortunately, it's, apparently the crime wave is not limited to
cities, you know.  It's spreading to, you know, our communities also #and
smaller.#

@B.2:  #Right (( )).#  Right, my, I'm from, originally from Palestine --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- over in east Texas.

A.5:  I'm originally from a little, little rural town in southern Oklahoma.

B.6:  Yeah.  And, uh, the crime in, in, you know, in east Texas is, uh, I, I
think it's just about as bad.  The #burglaries# --

A.7:  #Yes.#

B.8:  -- and the drugs #and# --

A.9:  #Yes.#

B.10:  -- stuff seem to #have# --

A.11:  #That is# --

B.12:  -- moved out into that area.

A.13:  -- that's really scary.  #It has# --

B.14:  #Uh# ...

A.15:  -- it's done the same thing even in my little town and gosh, it's only like
a thousand people.

B.16:  Yeah.  #But, uh# ...

A.17:  #There's one# deputy sheriff that tries [laughter] to, #you know# --

B.18:  #[Laughter] Uh-huh.# 

A.19:  -- patrol the whole thing.  And he's, you know --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- he's just overwhelmed.  

B.22:  Right.  Uh, I guess, uh, it is really scary but the recognizing or I think
recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared
toward the, the major cities anyway.

A.23:  #That's right.#

B.24:  #Because# I think that, you know, the people that are involved in the drug
scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the li-, you
know, the center cities.

A.25:  Sure.  It's probably a safer environment for #them.#

B.26:  #Right.#  But, uh, I guess the question is, what do you do.

A.27:  Boy, I, who knows [laughter].  #I don't know.#

B.28:  #Uh, you# know, I, I think that, uh, from my own observation, that, that a
lot of it probably stems around the school system.  I, I don't want to blame
the school system on everything because --

A.29:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.30:  -- it's, it's not what they're doing, it's not that they're doing so much
wrong as that they can't not, [static] cannot do --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- a lot of the things [noise] that need to be done.  

A.33:  Are you talking about education wise?

B.34:  #Right.#  

A.35:  #Yeah.#

B.36:  Well, even, e-, not just education but, uh, even discipline and, and things
like that.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  That the schools are not allowed to do #anymore.#

A.39:  #That's true.#  #Absolutely.#

B.40:  #That,# uh, the students, you know, are just, they have so much control
over the schools themselves --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.42:  -- #that,# that everything seems to turn around at.

A.43:  Yeah.  You know, as you know, you watch the nightly news, you know, like I
did and boy, you know --

B.44:  Huh.

A.45:  -- it's not a day or night that goes by in this, 

B.46:  [Squeak]. 

A.47:  in this area at least, as (( )) somebody,

B.48:  [Throat_clearing].

A.49:  at least somebody doesn't get killed or raped --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- or robbed during this --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- the jillion others we don't even hear about #probably.#

B.54:  #Right.# I do, uh, I travel a little bit in my, in my job with, I've got
some clients in California.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And I was in California when the police out there beat, you know, beat up
on that --

A.57:  Yes.  #That's# --

B.58:  -- #traffic# --

A.59:  -- a hot topic, #you know.#

B.60:  -- #deal, yeah.# It's a real, yeah, really was.  And, of, and, of course,
everybody's reaction to that was, you know, anger and disgust --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and shock and all of that.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  But then when you turn around and look at, at what's going on from the
criminal element --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- th-, th-, probably that does not even compare --

A.67:  Yeah, that's ((right)).

B.68:  -- you know to what goes on crime wise.

A.69:  That's right.  You never hear about.

B.70:  And, uh ...

A.71:  And, you know, the, some of the crimes are so crazy, you know.  Just, you
know, killing somebody for a five dollar bill or some stupid thing like, you
know, you just, you just never know.  You know, it's.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  I sometimes get concerned about, you know, driving down the, down the
street, you know.  If you look crosswise at somebody, they're liable to blow
your head off.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  It's really #scary.#

B.76:  #But, uh,# you know, I, I, I really don-, I don't know what the answer is
#but I think that if# --

A.77:  #I don't either.#

B.78:  -- we don't find an answer soon, that it's, we're really going to be in a
lot worse trouble than we #are now.#

A.79:  #Yeah.#  It's also not getting any better.

B.80:  [Swallowing] I think, uh, perhaps the Supreme Court has taken a couple of
steps in the right #direction# --

A.81:  #Uh-huh.#

B.82:  -- recently. 

A.83:  Yes.  

B.84:  Uh, understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the, the
restrictions #on# --

A.85:  #Uh-huh.#

B.86:  -- you know, crime investigation #and stuff.  And# ...

A.87:  #Right.  Uh-huh.#  And even down to the death penalty I think, #as far# --

B.88:  #Yeah.#

A.89:  -- as, you know, appeal after appeal after appeal.  I think they've finally
began to say, you know, enough's enough.

B.90:  Right.  And say if you don't, don't appeal to start with #then# --

A.91:  #Yeah.#

B.92:  -- you don't have the right to appeal.

A.93:  That's right.

B.94:  And, uh, #even though I think that# ...

A.95:  #Yeah.  There are a lot of# people favor, you know, mandatory jail time
with no, no ti-, you know, no good time off.  You know, I don't know, I don't
know if that's an answer or not.  I'm not too sure [sigh] people are really
scared of jail time anymore because they're in and out so quickly.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  I'm not sure that's a #real# --

B.98:  #(( )).#

A.99:  -- scary item for them.

B.100:  That's, uh, #that's a fact# --

A.101:  #You know, it's# ...

B.102:  -- yo-, you can look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for, you
know, for what would seem to be a major crime #in# --

A.103:  #Uh-huh.#

B.104:  -- with, uh, appeals and all that and getting time --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- credit for spending time in jail.  

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  And I think they even give credit sometimes for the, the time they're out
of jail between --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- between, uh, the time they're indicted and the time they're tried --

A.111:  Yes.

B.112:  -- and stuff like that --

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  -- that still counts toward their sentence.

A.115:  Right.  You know, this building jails, you know, more jails the answer.
I'm not sure it is.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  I wish I did.

B.116:  #Yeah.#

A.117:  #I'd# be glad to share it with everybody if I knew.  

B.118:  Yeah.  That, uh, I guess, uh, the, uh, the number of, of beds available in
a jails, you know, (( )) we've got to have it to increase #because# --

A.119:  #Uh-huh# {very faint}.

B.120:  -- the number of criminals are increasing #but# --

A.121:  #Yes.#

B.122:  -- we've, we really need to work on the other side [noise] --

A.123:  Yes.

B.124:  -- you know, to, to ...

A.125:  Before they get to jail.

B.126:  Right.  

A.127:  Yeah.  I agree.

B.128:  But, uh, #I don't know what# ...

A.129:  #I don't know.# Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe it needs to start at home,
you know, with the parents as much as they can do.  Co-, you know, parents can
only do so much up to a point.

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  And they've lost it.

B.132:  Well, I think, uh, uh, you know, back to, uh, uh, back to, uh, the, the
school situation.  The parents are the ones that, that demand all the rights
for these students --

A.133:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.134:  -- for the children.

A.135:  Right.

B.136:  They, they want to put so much restrictions on and, and, you know, then
they don't take on the responsibility themselves.

A.137:  That's right.

B.138:  And, uh, so it's, it kind of perpetuates #itself.#

A.139:  #Yeah.# I tell you the truth ((though)).  Both, I have two children both of
ar-, are, you know, young adults grown and gone away from home.  I'm honestly
glad I'm not raising children at this #point and time.#

B.140:  #Well, I've,# I've got two that are, they're still at home but they, they
think they're adults.  #They're# --

A.141:  #Yes.#

B.142:  -- both out of, you know, out of high school.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  And one of them going to college and, and, uh, I, we really were nervous
about our son.  That's the second one.

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  Uh, going to school.  

A.147:  Uh-huh {very, very faint}.

B.148:  And, you know, Richardson schools are some of the best around.

A.149:  Absolutely.

B.150:  And even at that, it's, you know, it was a real touchy #situation as to
what# --

A.151:  #Yeah.  Yeah, it's no guarantee.#

B.152:  -- you know, as to who the associates were.  There are students in every
school system --

A.153:  That's right.

B.154:  -- that, uh, you don't want your kids associating #with# --

A.155:  #Uh-huh.#

B.156:  -- if you can help it.

A.157:  That's right.  If you can help it.  That's the key, #you know.#

B.158:  #And, uh,# you don't, you know, you don't have any control over it
#yourself.#

A.159:  #That's right.# Yep, up to a point.  You, after that, [door] you've lost
it.

B.160:  Right.

A.161:  Sure have.  

B.162:  So.

A.163:  I'm just glad I'm not raising young children anymore.  

B.164:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [rattling].  It's, uh, [swallowing] we said, you know, that
we'd have been a lot better off, our children would have been a l-, a lot
better off being raised in a smaller, smaller area.

A.165:  Uh-huh.

B.166:  Smaller town.

A.167:  Yeah.

B.168:  Smaller school.

A.169:  Uh-huh.

B.170:  Or at least we thought perhaps at the time but, you know.

A.171:  I'm not so sure.

B.172:  Not so sure anymore.

A.173:  [Noise] Yeah.

B.174:  We did have some friends that moved, uh, out into, well out in rural Collin
County.

A.175:  Uh-huh.

B.176:  Thinking that would have been a, you know, a better place for their kids --

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  -- and before their kids got out of school, the drug scene had moved in
#out there.#

A.179:  #Yeah, that's right.#

B.180:  And, you know, so they, you know, it's not, not a whole lot different there
than it is --

A.181:  Nope.  #Maybe just a smaller# --

B.182:  -- #in, you know, in town.#

A.183:  -- just a smaller scale maybe, but th-, th-, you know, the idea is still
the same.  #It's there.#

B.184:  #Yep.#  So.

A.185:  It really is [noise].  

B.186:  But [sigh].

A.187:  I don't know [sigh].  

B.188:  #Well, it# ...

A.189:  #Uh, like# I say, I'm just glad I'm not trying to have to raise small
children again.

B.190:  Yeah.  I'm glad that they're not expecting us to come up with all the
answers on #these phone (( )) conversations [laughter].#

A.191:  #Yeah.  Me too [laughter].#  In the time allotted.  #No, I don't# --

B.192:  #Right, yeah.#

A.193:  -- don't think so.  But #I don't# --

B.194:  #Yeah, they (( )), you'd think that what# ...

A.195:  -- I don't know anyone that isn't concerned about it.

B.196:  Well, everybody's concerned but, you know, (( )) we give, uh, Congress and
we give the state legislators the, you know, all these powers and authorities
and everything --

A.197:  Uh-huh.

B.198:  -- and th-, they spend a lot of time on it and they can't come up with the
answers, so.

A.199:  That's right.  Not to mention monies spent.

B.200:  Right.  So.  #But, uh, it's# ...

A.201:  #So, I don't know.#  Wish I did.

B.202:  Yeah.  Maybe we, maybe it's, uh, it's time for there to be more people
involved, I guess, in, in trying to find the answer.

A.203:  Yeah.  I guess so.

B.204:  #And since, you know# ...

A.205:  #The police# I'm sure are just, you know, maxed out.  There is only so much
they can do.

B.206:  Yeah.  Well, they can, all they can do is en-, enforce the laws.  

A.207:  Uh-huh.

B.208:  They can't, uh, pass the laws and they can't run the, the court systems 
and --

A.209:  Yeah.

B.210:  -- you know, they do their, do their job.  I don't, I don't have a lot of
complaints about the police #myself.#

A.211:  #No, I don't either,# as a matter of fact.  I think they're doing, you
know, #probably for the# --

B.212:  #But, they're doing# ...

A.213:  -- most part, the best job they can do --

B.214:  Yeah.

A.215:  -- with the resources they have.  

B.216:  (( )).

A.217:  It's really --

B.218:  (( )).

A.219:  -- must be discouraging though to know that, you know, you bust somebody
for something, they may be out on the street before you finish your report,
#you know.#

B.220:  #Uh-huh.#  #Well.#

A.221:  #That's# got to be discouraging.  Especially if you've risked your life to
do the cor-, you know, if you're a cop, you expect to risk your life.

B.222:  Yeah.  That's, uh, my wife said the other day, said she just couldn't do
that.  Couldn't be a police officer because you're, you know, you never 
know --

A.223:  That's right.

B.224:  -- what, uh, you know, you stop (( )) somebody for traffic --

A.225:  Uh-huh.

B.226:  -- accident and you walk up and they, they've got a gun pulled on you.

A.227:  Yeah.

B.228:  Or, you know, something of that kind.  And ...

A.229:  As I understand it, talking to a couple of my police friends, what they
fear most is a call to go try to settle a domestic quarrel, you know.

B.230:  Right.  #Yeah, because# ...

A.231:  #Apparently it's# very dangerous.  #You just never know.#

B.232:  #Yeah, you, you've got a,# they get a, a domestic, uh, violence --

A.233:  Uh-huh.

B.234:  -- or do-, domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn
on #them.#

A.235:  #That's right.#  Apparently, it's very, very dangerous situation.  

B.236:  Uh-huh.

A.237:  No, I don't, I don't think I could be a cop.  I really don't.  

B.238:  Yeah.  So.  Well, {pause} you think there's anything else to talk about on
this #subject [laughter]?#

A.239:  #I guess that's [sigh] pretty well it.#

B.240:  Okay.  #Well, it's been nice talking to you.#

A.241:  #Nice to talk to you.#

B.242:  Okay.  #Bye.#

A.243:  #Bye.#  [Click].
