=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, you,

@B.2:  Do you have any pets? 

A.3:  Um, we got two cats. 

B.4:  Two cats. 

A.5:  Yeah, and, uh, um, yeah, we had cat, you know, my family had cats when we
were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,

B.6:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

A.7:  so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around, I like them.

B.8:  Yeah, I like having ca-, cats around or pets around in general I, I favor
dogs over cats actually but, 

A.9:  Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all [laughter].

B.10:  Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person.  I had, I guess it depends on what you had when
he were a kid, right?  [laughter].

A.11:  Yeah, probably, I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid,

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  in fact, I may still be, um, we,

B.14:  But not cats. 

A.15:  ((That)), um, I wonder sometimes [laughter]. 

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple
weeks ago and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything, we were, you know, we were
sitting the dog and everything and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend
and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday, it was like, hey, maybe you're
still allergic to the dog.  It was like, oh, that could be it.

B.18:  The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just
reek,

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  of the dogs, ((and constantly)).

A.21:  Well, dogs are real high maintenances, you got to take them for walks and
you've got to pay a lot, you know, you need to pay attention to cats and
everything but it's not quite the same thing.

B.22:  Yeah, that's true. 

A.23:  Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats,
yeah, you don't have to let them outside, ((you know, all)) cats are indoor
cats,

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  so, you know, they're not, yo-, w-, you're not worried about them running
all-around the neighborhood and, you know, they, you know, they, they make
their mess in the cat pan which is,

B.26:  Limited.  

A.27:  yeah, it's, you know, it's a pain to clean but, you know, we used to, I
mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' ((pans)).  They didn't,

B.28:  Oh, really? 

A.29:  Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan
all the time, and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and,
you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and
put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible.  But now they have
like this, you get these liners,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  that is garbage bags, you know, and you, and you, you know the,

B.32:  Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,

A.33:  Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it
away, and that's it, [laughter].

B.34:  Yeah, I housesat ((from)) cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing
up her thesis,

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then
put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can
and dump the whole thing.

A.37:  Same idea [laughter]. 

B.38:  Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that
pan very, very rarely,

A.39:  Everyday?

B.40:  and so it wasn't so bad.

A.41:  Oh, okay, I see.

B.42:  (( )) two cats and ((just as easy)) it just never started smelling, I would
put just a little bit of cat litter in there,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been, [laughter], all
of her animals that she ever had were adopted.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  I that true, yeah.  Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two
cats and her dog there is, is basically a reject, somebody had bought him,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  and wanted him.  It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not
mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was and now,

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  she's stuck with it.  And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes
all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely
nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter].  

B.52:  because that's all there is to it.  So, you know,

A.53:  So, you don't have anything right now? 

B.54:  No, we don't have anything right now. 

A.55:  Oh, except the kid, ((huh, that's)),

B.56:  Oh, right, [laughter], now we have a kid but he was, no, completely against
having a dog or cat, he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid, and
they're harder to get rid of for the weekend, [laughter].  And,

A.57:  Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, yeah, we can
leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really, I mean they're, they're happier
when we're around but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves,
um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.

B.60:  That's, uh, yeah, really true.  But like the friends, other friends of mine
have cats, they have four of them, and if they go away, they have, they hire a
pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their
cats, you know, their so used to the attention, that if they don't get it,
they get really upset,

A.61:  ((Well)), that's,

B.62:  and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things
like that.

A.63:  That's, um, pampering the, the petals [laughter]. 

B.64:  I, I tried to have, um, [laughter], figured something having, (( )) so I
tried to have a goldfish,

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.

A.67:  ((But)) they're not that much fun, you know, you can't take them for a
walk, you can't, you know, they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,

B.68:  Right.  

A.69:  they ca-, they can't do anything, so I've never, I think we had fish sh-,
when I was a kid but I don't,

B.70:  My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that, and one of his fish
jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank.  And fried
itself, [laughter], on the radiator behind the dresser.  I'll never forget
that because I remember my brother,

A.71:  Oh. 

B.72:  he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and
they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and
then they found it fried on, [laughter], the radiator behind.

A.73:  Oh. 

B.74:  (( )) it was not gross, I didn't see it but, um,

A.75:  Oh.

B.76:  (( )) got them.  Trying to remember we had a dog for a while. and I don't
know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it, my
brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he
had fish.

A.79:  Uh-huh. 

B.80:  And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.

A.81:  No, it's like, I just, I don't know, I, I just never understood why, what
the attraction, I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything but
I've just never s-, seen the attraction of having fish.  It's not as much fun.

B.82:  Well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,

A.83:  [Breathing], an eel?  

B.84:  and then he had a, um, I forget what type of fish it was, it was one of
these fish that i-, it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like
that.  ((There would be sort of)) ((moby)) fish in a tank.

A.85:  Oh, now we really get sick [laughter].

B.86:  Yeah, and it, I, I couldn't see having fish like that. 

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  I could see ((some)) having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are
really, really pretty but, 

A.89:  Like, ((I remember)) a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat
in college that they had a tank of piranha,

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in (( )) this is not, these aren't
cats, [laughter], you know,

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  this is gross.  

B.94:  Yeah, no, that would be, what did they do, everyone come around and watch
them.

A.95:  Yep.

B.96:  I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house,

A.97:  Yeah, well,

B.98:  and ((your things)) destroyed the mice.  But,

A.99:  Yeah, well, a cat will do the same trick [laughter].

B.100:  ((Let's see)),  I had a pet rat, [laughter], for a while,

A.101:  [Breathing].  

B.102:  and it was a live rat, and, um, this woman just offered ((it to me))
while I was in, in graduate school and,

A.103:  ((I had a friend)) in col-, 

B.104:  she was actually a very fun pet. 

A.105:  I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a
while. 

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  Um, I forget how she got it, but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal
I think she got it, I think she was a psych major and she got it from the
psych department.

B.108:  ((Yeah)), mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been
bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you
know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick, and she said, I
don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant, [laughter].

A.109:  [Laughter] Whoops [laughter]. 

B.110:  And they had ((misclassed)) the sex of (( )) ((back there)) and so, um, she
asked me if I want to, ((one of those)) babies, and I took the baby and I got
her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like,

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  half the price of a mouse, and then she grew to be, you know, I had
pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty
big,

A.113:  Uh-huh.  

B.114:  you know, like a pound or something I don't know how much, and I had her
for over two years and she was very affectionate.  She would, you know, crawl
on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working,

A.115:  Uh-huh.  

B.116:  and things like that.  Yeah, much more than you would think.

A.117: Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before
they go, kind of ((nuts, so)).

B.118:  Yeah and,

A.119:  Yeah, rats are not my favorite animals in the world, but I could see
getting one from birth and everything.

B.120:  Yeah, I, sort of weird for me to have had one too but there, it was a
convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's cage and, you know, it
was easy.

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  Easy to take care of and but, 

A.123:  Yeah, I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they, they tell me
the same thing.

B.124:  Uh-huh. 

A.125:  I just, again it gets into ((vivant)) much fun, [laughter], you know what,
I guess they can be.  I,

B.126:  Actually it was more fun than you would think.  Yeah, starting from the
beginning but, um, yeah, we live, also live in the city now, actually in
Manhattan.

A.127:  Okay. 

B.128:  And so it's almost impossible to, it's not fair to a pet to have a pet
here,

A.129:  Right. 

B.130:  or certainly, certainly not a dog, I mean, people do,

A.131:  Oh people,

B.132:  but it's not, 

A.133:  I don't, oh, plus, I mean, the pooper scooper ((one)) New York, ((so, you
know)).

B.134:  Oh, yeah, you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well
dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of
paper for them, it's really kind of funny.

A.135:  Yeah, ((uh)), I was living in northern Jersey when that ((law)) came
through, remember hearing all about it,

B.136:  Uh-huh.  

A.137:  we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in
Central Park.

B.138:  Right, no, they don't.  ((I should make you)), 

A.139:  Of course, not.

B.140:  they have, um, the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed
to,

A.141:  ((Hit)) the bags. 

B.142:  (( )) keep them, yeah, keep them clean but, oh, gosh, I can't even walk
by Central Park ((yeah)) when summertime, just the smell is so bad [laughter],

A.143:  Oh, God, I can't,

B.144:  of the horses.  

A.145:  Haven't been up there, last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't
that bad [laughter].

B.146:  Oh, well, it's not that long ago.  ((It was)),

A.147:  Not this past fall but I mean fall,

B.148:  Oh, twelve times, of the year. 

A.149:  a few years, I mean, it w-, it was in the, yeah, it was almost like
October of eighty-five,

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  I think was the last time I was up, up there and at Center Park.

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia and I used to go up and visit her.

B.154:  Uh-huh.

A.155:  Um, so,

B.156:  Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had
two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything
or are they just,

A.157:  No, they're just mutts,

B.158:  Uh-huh.  

A.159:  yeah, my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and
everything, you know, you know, as kittens,

B.160:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

A.161:  and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met. Um, she's had
them for a couple years.  And um, you know, they're really cute, they're,
they're sisters,

B.162:  Uh-huh.  

A.163:  one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and, [laughter], she
pushes the other one away from the food.  Apparently w-, I don't know all the
details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named
Tinsel and the other one is named Holly.

B.164:  Uh-huh. 

A.165:  You know, the scr-,

B.166:  They're both females?

A.167:  both, yeah, both females,

B.168:  Uh-huh.  

A.169:  they're both spayed,

B.170:  Uh-huh.  

A.171:  um, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, [throat_clearing], um, and
they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.

B.172:  Uh-huh.
