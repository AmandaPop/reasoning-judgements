=============================================================================

A.1:  Do you have, uh, personal experience involving child care services?

B.2:  Well, about the only thing I know is, um, one of my, um, friends at work,
um, has, um, one little boy and she's about to have a second baby and I hear
some of her, um, tales about trying to get, uh, child care.  Now she doesn't
like to use some of the places like, um, Kinder Care or La Petite Academy.  She
likes to just find individuals --

A.3:  Right. 

B.4:  -- you know, who take children into their home. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  And, uh, you know, sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth.
Other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find.
There are some, um, like, um, oh, Chamber of Commerce you can kind of call.
There are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least.
But she just kind of goes and meets people that she sees advertise and, and
interviews with them and ask them their --

A.7:  I have a friend at work,

B.8:  # -- ways.  #

A.9:  # yeah, who, # whose wife does that.  She takes in kids. 

B.10:  Oh. 

A.11:  I think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at
one time.

B.12:  Oh. 

A.13:  So I'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but, um, I think there's a
maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time. 

B.14:  Yeah.  There's been a few people that have kind of used the same person,
kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and then, um,
you know, other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows. 
Like some people only want little infants, you know, and when they get to two
years old they don't want [breathing] you know, a whole lot of two years old
because they're a little more active so they, you know, a lot people in the
department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their, their
children, uh, grow,

A.15:  # Yeah.  #

B.16:  # but # I really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something
like through Texins to have, you know, some kind of facilities there at work
because it really is, uh, a lot of extra pressure on our working parents.

A.17:  Do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company?

B.18:  No.  I think it should be done through Texans.  I mean, I understand that,
# that, #

A.19: # Something # you can, sign up for and pay,

B.20:  that T I wouldn't want to have liability for that,

A.21:  # Sure.  #

B.22:  # and # I can understand that.  I work in the legal department.  I don't
want anymore lawsuits than what we got [laughter]. 

A.23:  Right.  No, I don't think that the company should be subsidizing,

B.24:  # But, #

A.25:  # services # like that. 

B.26:  but, you know, I think they could work out something with Texins, something
that would be close to work because I think that would help ease things too if
you've got your child somewhere close because I see these people, you know,
dashing out the door, um, have to be up by a certain time because they have to
go pick up their child.  If they don't pick up the child by a certain time
then they run extra money,

A.27:  # Sure.  #

B.28:  # you # know, to, uh, have late charges.  And, uh, you know, Texins is, is
not, uh, well, I don't think it's really directly supported by T I, I think it
has it's own kind of funding but something like that that, you know, you would
have to be a T I or a Texins kind of, um, does it. 

A.29:  Yeah, I think that would take care of any questions about competency for
people running the show, uh, if, say if you were in, in, a situation having to
locate a, uh, child care center, how old you go about determining whether
somebody was competent or not and take care of your kids? I think that's a big
question. 

B.30:  Well, how would I do that?

A.31:  Yeah.  You, um, pretty much by word of mouth, uh, somebody recommends
somebody else but if you didn't know anybody, uh, how, how lengthy an interview
would you conduct with the person taking care of your kids to determine whether
they're fit to, uh, handle it [laughter]? 

B.32:  Well, uh, again, I know from the person who, um, you know, is a friend ever
mine at work.  She, and I, I've talked to her after she's interviewed, some
people just really sound, I mean, bizarre.  I mean, you can't imagine that
these people are putting in for, um, you know, minding other children.  Um,
like if you could go to the house and it seems to be in a disarray and the
woman really isn't even dressed and it's afternoon and, and you ask her about,
you know, previous children and she won't talk about it [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.34:  Kind of go, okay.  Um, others if they have some way of handling, like I
kind of wonder about these women who take in children.  There are times that
you're going to have to do, you know, for the women, they're going to have to
do some personal things themselves.  I mean, every single day they may have,
you know, every once in a while they may have some kind of, um, personal
doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that.  How do
they do that? So you ask them, do you have a fall back, you know, for those
times.  Are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can
take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need
to, you know, have personal time off and do those items.

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  And ask them, you know, who else, uh, have they, you know, baby sat for in
the past and can you talk to them, look at the facilities and ask them what
kind of things they do to, you know, during the day with the child.  That kind
of thing I guess.

A.37:  There, there are some services that, um, that are very expensive, um, for,
um, typically subsidized by, uh, large companies --

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  -- for some of their, uh, uh, important employees.  Where if they can't
get there regular, uh, sitter or a child care service to take there kids, if
they reserve slots with these other, um, companies, um, very expensive rates
but they can drop their kid off, um, at, um, one of these places for so, I
don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the companies,

B.40:  # Um.  #

A.41:  # um, # have to, um, reserve X number of slots per year.  They can't,

B.42:  # Um.  #

A.43:  # send # anymore.  It's, it's pretty much for, for their, for their, uh,
uh, som-, some of their employees.  Lawyers do that a lot, um, I've heard
about this type of service in, uh, places like New York City --

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  -- where people are, unreal busy.  But if, uh, if they can't find the
regular sitter the-, they, if the company has, uh, slots available in this
service, uh, these employees can drop their kids off there. 

B.46:  Um.  Oh, do you know one time I, um, we just got married a couple of years
ago and there was people that were coming, you know, into town with, uh,
children and, and I wanted, you know, baby-sitters for, uh, the service and,
and available to them if they didn't want to bring their children or, you
know, get away and stuff and I just called in the, from the Yellow Pages, you
know, a baby-sitter outfits that are, um, again, must have some kind of
licensing or whatnot and, uh, just had them, I mean, what I did was I had a
baby-sitter during the service, you know, and, and, um, anybody who had
children could just, you know, take the child to the nursery and I had
somebody there.  Everybody I knew was going to be at the wedding so
[laughter],

A.47:  # Yeah.  #

B.48:  # ((I knew)) # I had to find somebody I didn't know to do that.  Um, and it
worked out okay.  I didn't know that there were services that you just called
the Yellow Pages and,

A.49:  # [Laughter].  #

B.50:  # uh, # there's baby-sitters are us or something [laughter], 

A.51:  # Great.  #

B.52:  # and # ((you say)), please, I need one, you know, oh, yeah.  No problem. 
We'll send you out one. 

A.53:  Do you have any idea what, uh, what the regular, uh, uh, services cost like
La Petite or Kinder Care?

B.54:  Uh, I thought I checked into it one time just pre planning and it can run
like a hundred dollars a week.  I think my friend who now has a, uh, uh, a two
and a half year old, she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him. 
So, I think it's anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place
you take. 

A.55:  I guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else
take care of your kids.  If, uh, the working wife can, uh, make, uh, more than
enough to handle that expense I guess it's worthwhile [laughter].

B.56:  Yeah.  Yeah, it gets to be kind of expensive and I think, you know, some of
the woman do, uh, weigh that.  Um, we've had some that have had their children
and not come back.  So it just depends, I think, uh, well, we have one now
who, um, is, is part time.  She works half days.  Well, actually we have two,
one paralegal and one secretary and one attorney.  Each have very young
children and now they are part timing.  It is kind of like a test to see how
this will work to have these people work part time.

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  Uh, depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how
that will workout because they all want to, you know, still have a little
income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children
so they're part timers.

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  And, uh, for the one that's working with me it's working very well.  I
don't have any problem with that.  I have one that's, um, helping me out at,
um, for the litigation we're doing and she's there, uh, three days a week and
this, that seems to be fine.  I can handle that very well with her being there
only half time.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  I know some woman who are very career minded as soon as they have
their kids they're back at work the next week [laughter]. 

B.62:  [Laughter] Next week?

A.63:  Yeah.  Pretty much so,

B.64:  # [Laughter].  #

A.65:  # but # othe-, other than that I know some also who's claim is that after
they have their kids or started having kids they're going to quit their job
and, uh, dedicate their time to raising the kids right,

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  accordin-, in, in putting it in their words --

B.68:  Oh. 

A.69:  -- and staying at home.  So, I don't know.  I guess each way has it's
advantages. 

B.70:  Yeah, well, it's, whatever they feel comfortable with, you know, basically
whatever they feel best.  And there's probably some women who may not do their
child any good being there all the time because, you know, they, they, they
can't, uh, quite see themselves, you know, dedicated that much.  Maybe they
want to work a little bit --

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  -- whatever it is.  Maybe they should think about do you really want a
child or not [laughter]?

A.73:  Yeah, good question [laughter]. 

B.74:  [Laughter] And maybe again, you know, their, their, you know, their ideas
change once the baby is there.  They go, oh, well, you know, now I like this a
lot more than I thought I would. 

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  But, uh, Cathlene, the part timer, she says, you know, she just doesn't,
she, she's always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really
can't sit still enough to just be home with the baby.  She has to have, you
know, something else.  She's always been one who's put in, you know, like the
fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in
to check her office and to check her in box, you know, like ten days later she
was back in and we were like, Cathlene, you got two months off, you know, you
don't have to be back in there.  She's just always back in there,

A.77:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.78:  # and she's # a, she, she just finds it very hard to, um, you know, tone
that down.  Even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on
Saturday,
