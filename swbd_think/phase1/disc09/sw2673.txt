=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so, uh, seeing we're both from different parts of the country, um, I
imagine that, uh, social changes have,

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  happened in both areas but, you know, is rapid I'm not sure.  Could you
tell me some of the things that's happened in your area?

B.4:  Well, I thought the second part of the question, you know, how do you
perceive life in the United States differently, you know, as, uh, opposed to
ten to fifteen years ago, uh,

A.5:  Yeah (( )).

B.6:  Yeah, that one, [laughter] my oldest children are, are fifteen so, that's,
huh, you know that, that was immediately what clicked in my head.  What do I
see now different than I do, you know, when they were born.

A.7:  When they were born? Yeah. 

B.8:  You know.  Um, I have, my oldest are two girls, they are fifteen and
fourteen. 

A.9:  Oh boy. 

B.10:  So, not quite fourteen.  The, uh, I think we are seeing lots and lots of,
[laughter]  of changes as regarding families, you know.  At that point I felt
like I was one of the few people that truly wanted t-, children and now I think
you are seeing that a little bit more, it's coming back again. 

A.11:  Oh, is that right? [throat_clearing]. 

B.12:  And, but people are certainly having their children, their families later,
you know, it's not --

A.13:  Uh, yeah in some cases, uh,

B.14:  -- and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot
earlier [laughter] like eleven [laughter] or ten [laughter]. 

A.15:  [Laughter] That's, yeah, that's early.  Uh, I was kind of young.  I, I got
married as soon as I got out of school,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # and # started raising a family so, uh, my oldest is uh, thirty-four and
my youngest is going to be twenty-six.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  Uh [throat_clearing]. 

B.20:  So that, uh, definitely makes a difference.  My husband was quite a bit
older when we married and we decided to, you know, we wanted to, to get our
family pretty quick, you know,

A.21:  Yeah, right, yeah. 

B.22:  And, uh, that was, you know, really a definitely, uh, identifying factor,
you know, we began {fades away}.

A.23:  Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure about that [throat_clearing]  excuse me. 

B.24:  Well I know that, uh, here in Dallas we have the unfortunate, uh,
reputation as being, I think, it's the fifth largest of, uh, I'm trying to
think how that was, fifth on the list of teenage mothers in the United States.

A.25:  Is that right?

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  We have, I think, in nineteen, it seems like the statistic was
for nineteen eighty-eight [sigh]  --

A.27:  Yeah, probably. 

B.28:  -- in Dallas County there were, I want to say three hundred and fifteen,
gosh that seems like an awful lot --

A.29:  Well. 

B.30:  -- of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen. 

A.31:  Oh yeah, but [throat_clearing]  under thirteen probably.  What do you
contribute that to then as compared to say, uh, uh, twenty years ago?

B.32:  [Sigh]. 

A.33:  You know, with, with children,

B.34:  It can't be education because, you know, there's more and more family
related issues being raised at school, uh, you know,

A.35:  # Yeah.  #

B.36:  # they're # like more progressive, more pointed sex education --

A.37:  Right. 

B.38:  -- programs all over the country. 

A.39:  Right.  Right.  I grew up in kind of, uh, there was a rural area and there
was nothing but farms and mostly, mostly dairy and orchards, apple orchards
and, you know, peach orchards, uh,

B.40:  [Clicking] One thing that I really see a difference and I guess, you know,
overall, uh, you know, that it's a negative is that, you know, these kids, now
we live in su-, a suburban area of Dallas,

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  These kids do not have the aunts and uncles, the cousins, you know that
built-in kind of security, you know,

A.43:  Why? Because we're a more mobile society?

B.44:  Yeah, I think so. 

A.45:  Are people just moving out, getting jobs and our families (( )),

B.46:  Of course you have lots and lots of moms working. 

A.47:  That's, that's a big problem because at least I, I see that up here.  When,
when I was growing up and going to school people never locked their doors and,
uh, you know. 

B.48:  That's right. 

A.49:  You had family that was generally in the area.  Most people kind of stayed
put, you know, very few moved away. 

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  Uh,

B.52:  So there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there. 

A.53:  [Throat_clearing]  Right. 

B.54:  That you could rely on, you know, if you were ready to just, you know --

A.55:  Yeah.  I think the whole country back then was naive. 

B.56:  -- strangle your parents you kind of had, course there's just a different,
uh, just different feeling as to who, who's in control.  I don't think we ever
talked about children's rights, you know we didn't talk about women's rights
[laughter]. 

A.57:  Yeah, right.  I think,

B.58:  You know, we sure didn't talk about kids' rights [laughter]. 

A.59:  Children have, children have responsibility, but I think the, the biggest
thing now is that, uh, information is, is passed on a lot quicker with --

B.60:  Oh, yeah. 

A.61:  -- with T V and radio and, uh, uh, children are under a lot more pressure
because of from their peers then, then it used to be. 

B.62:  Well, you know I can remember as a teenager, you know we would get things
fashion wise.  You know we always have considered Dallas the third coast, you
know. 

A.63:  That's right. 

B.64:  I mean feel very, uh, uh, always felt like we were on the edge of, of new
trends. 

A.65:  Right. 

B.66:  And you know I had a lot of, of friends (static) and in Wyoming and Utah
and Colorado because that's where my parents were from,

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.68:  # and # we would go there.  They were always seeing movies that had been
here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying li-, using new
lingo that,

A.69:  # Yeah.  #

B.70:  # we # heard way before and so we always felt, you know, a little, you
know, kind of thumb your nose and --

A.71:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

B.72:  -- but now that's not so, you know, if there, those parts of the country
aren't behind, you know, they're getting the movies if not, you know --

A.73:  That's right. 

B.74:  -- right at the same time they're getting them, you know,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # six # weeks later.  It's not, you know, not so,

A.77:  Uh. 

B.78:  And yet I think, I think we're really evolving right now.  I, you know, the
seventies and eighties were so, uh, get all you can cause you may not be here
tomorrow and money hungry [laughter]. 

A.79:  Yeah, #I think,#

B.80:  #I think#  we're seeing some comeback to family, uh. 

A.81:  Yeah, that's a, a family unit, yes, uh, but you can't trust anybody
anymore. 

B.82:  It's a different family unit though. 

A.83:  Yes it is. 

B.84:  You know it's not the same that [laughter]  we traditionally thought of. 

A.85:  No it, it goes back, I guess way, way back [throat_clearing]  people had a
lot of children and they, and they, they were kind of, uh, they, most of them
were on farms I guess, or they worked in factories.  At least in the east you
know my father, my grandfather, his father before him always worked at this
place so than I would work at this place. 

B.86:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.87:  Uh, out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was going to be
farmers so you had a lot of children they kind of, money didn't seem to be
important back then.

B.88:  When we, uh, moved to this particular town, this is a suburb of Dallas, ten
years ago, there was still a lot, lot of agri-, of, of land that was used for
agricultural purposes. 

A.89:  So [throat_clearing], 

B.90:  And that is just, you know, every year just a little bit more, a little bit
more slips away. 

A.91:  Yeah, but with a [throat_clearing]  excuse me, were they run by families or
were the younger children going out into the world and then they were bringing
in --

B.92:  I don't know.  Uh,

A.93:  -- you know, labor is to, to take care of the crops. 

B.94:  I think probably the m-, a lot of it was, you know, contract labor, uh,

A.95:  Because the kids wanted something more, I guess. 

B.96:  Yeah, the kids want something more.  There's a great deal of respect in
this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this
particular community and we still have a couple of very viable families who
are, you know, make large contributions time, money, you know, emotionally to
the community and preservation of its heritage.

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  But, we don't, uh, you know, but, but even their concerns are becoming more
diversified. 

A.99:  Yeah.  I, your,

B.100:  But you know, one thing that, and this is just totally off the wall but
it's another, uh, another element as we see the encroachment of, of progress
on just the e-, ecosystem.

A.101:  Right. 

B.102:  When we moved here and the, the fields were mowed every summer we would
have massive influx of crickets from the fields into our homes, you know, just
--

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  -- [Laughter] I mean crickets so thick you couldn't walk without stepping
on them and of course that then bought different birds that didn't normally
come to our area and I don't know what all other effects on the ecosystem
because that's not my bailiwick but see we don't have that anymore.

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  So you wonder what other little,

A.107:  Man's changed it. 

B.108:  Uh-huh.  I was reading in, uh, I think it was the READER'S DIGEST just
earlier in the week about,
