===========================================================================

A.1:  What I was doing at, at home, is like I work nights here, so that's another
long story that we will talk about.  It's funny that I got you though.

B.2:  Yeah. 

A.3:  Uh, I asked my wife to hand me the other phone because I was just, I was
busy, and I, uh, had just gotten a call and I couldn't answer, and I said,
Well, I will punch it on this one.

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  And, uh, it's a walk around phone,

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  but it's not a, it's not the other kind, you know. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  So it didn't work.

B.10:  Now, I've got a portable. 

A.11:  Okay. 

B.12:  Cordless, is that what you are using?  

A.13:  No, I'm using a regular phone now.  

B.14:  Okay, I got it, I'm using a cordless.  

A.15:  Uh, if it's a, what kind of phone do they, it's not a dial, but if it's a
touchtone, it's okay.

B.16:  Yeah right. 

A.17:  I realized that once I used, I should have, I was going to go in the
kitchen and, and punch one on the touchtone.

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  And I realized that I had screwed up, so it was my fault.

B.20:  Okay. 

A.21:  It's funny that we had gotten it.  

B.22:  Yeah, it is. 

A.23:  Uh, I guess they want us to talk about dogs. 

B.24:  Dogs and cats. 

A.25:  Dogs or cats. 

@B.26:  About your cat, you're Rex.

A.27:  I'll switch over to birds, you know, we, we don't really have birds as
pets, but we should because we have cats,

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  we always wind up with, I haven't yet, uh, a bird or two in the Summer
because the cat will catch one and usually,

B.30:  Oh, no. 

A.31:  we will catch the cat because the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right
away.

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  We wound up with a lot of birds over the years. 

B.34:  Oh. 

A.35:  And there are, organizations.  We drop ours off at Fort Worth, if they are
still alive and you keep it alive, which is hard to do for a couple of weeks.

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  If you take it to an agency, they'll send it back in the wild somehow,

B.38:  Oh. 

A.39:  and so we, we wound up because of our cats, with, with many birds over the
years.  Again, they are not pets exactly but, uh.

B.40:  This guy that I work with raises birds.  He has a ma-, macaw, macaw?

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  And parakeets and something else.  He, one of those parrots.

A.43:  The lady next door, across the street from us just lost, is it a cockatoo?
What's that one that's white?

B.44:  Yeah, I think it's a cockatoo.

A.45:  It got loose, I've forgotten what,

B.46:  Did it really? 

A.47:  how she did it.  She had it in a cage of some sort. And what they were
doing, I don't know.  But it flew away.

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  You know, and they called it and everything, and they drove around the
neighborhood looking for it.

B.50:  Those are expensive. 

A.51:  But, uh, yeah [laughter], three. 

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  I'm surprised that a bird, uh, I guess they can find their way back, but I
wonder exactly where a tame bird would go.

B.54:  Did she ever get it back? 

A.55:  No, no.  She never got it back. 

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  I've heard stories like this before, 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  with parrots and all this, uh, because people let them out in their house,
you know, and fly around.

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  And. 

B.62:  My daughter had one.  I wouldn't have one flying around my house.

A.63:  No, I know.  Uh, but, uh, I've forgotten, she had it outside somehow, and
somehow they, they mixed signals or something, and it got loose and of course,
again the animals are so much faster than we are,

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  in one way or the other. 

B.66:  Boy, that's a shame. 

A.67:  Uh, you know I was telling you the story about fencing.  I do like dogs.
I, I would, I've always had dogs my whole life.

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  As a kid. 

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  Uh.

B.72:  Don't you miss them now?   I mean. 

A.73:  Well, yeah, I do.  I,

B.74:  They have such personalities.

A.75:  Yeah, I do.  I think that all the animals have personalities.  I'm not the
cat person, I, my sister had cats when we were little.

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  We always seem to have a cat and a dog together which, again when you bring
them up, I do notice that,

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  they get along.

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  And my wife was the cat lover.  When we started out as a young married
couple, we just had an apartment,

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  so it's kind of easier to have a cat. 

B.84:  Right, right. 

A.85:  And then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas and
she's from Texas again, and she had this thing with the fence and I, I guess,
I have so many interests, I don't really quite have the time,

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  with two daughters and everything.  

B.88:  Yeah, right. 

A.89:  And all the activities, to personally train a dog, but I would, I would, I
guess I'll have to wait until both of my kids are out of college before I can
have another dog [laughter].

B.90:  Yeah, right [laughter]. 

A.91:  I, I certainly saw your point with the greyhound. 

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  That there, there is a limit to a pet, uh.  

B.94:  Yeah, you know, you think your, you think that's what you want.  And I
really gave it a good try,

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  and I had her spoiled, I mean, she was spoiled rotten, but she was so
[laughter], and I have a new house, and my, and to walk in my house, I'd,
have, especially on a rainy day.  I'd have to take a bucket of water out there
and wash all four of her feet.  Now this is a fifty pound dog, I'm going to
pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something while I got the
other three, you know, and then I'd let her in the house.  Well, still even
putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them real good, she still
would come in so fast and so heavy that she would dig her paws deep into my
carpet, you know, and just take out running,

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  and she would, oh, she was ruining my carpet and I said, gosh, I, I love my
new house more than I love her, I just, you, know, I have a big investment.  I
don't, I just, it was just more work than it was really, I wasn't enjoying
her.  That's what it was.

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  Maybe if I had had a run, a dog run, but I think that's cruel to put a dog
in a run.

A.101:  Yeah.  No I think so too.  Uh, my wife, she keeps convincing me because my
parents, my parents are dead now, but my parents and my brothers and sisters
always had dogs.

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  And when we would visit them, she said, you can smell dog all over the
house.  I said, well, you're really right.

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  And so I never, she always had a good argument, why not to get a dog,

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  And we haven't since we've been married. 

B.108:  But now see, I have always felt that I could always smell cats.  Cats to me
always, I used, I used to have some friends' house, that I couldn't stand to
go in their house, I could smell their, their litter box.  I thought, oh, my
God,

A.109:  Oh, yeah. 

B.110:  I couldn't stand it.  I don't know how they stood it.  I guess they didn't
smell it.

A.111:  Uh, no, I know you're right.  Uh, people are surprising, are allergic to
cats too.  We do have some friends.

B.112:  Oh, do you? 

A.113:  on and off, that will, I guess it's the ha-, the cat, the short fur on the
cat.

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  Is, uh, one of the allergic reaction things like, uh, cedar trees, and all
of that other stuff.  I guess,

B.116:  Yeah.  

A.117:  the cat has a real fine, not the, real short hair, dandruff or whatever
they have,

B.118:  Uh-huh. 

A.119:  people do get allergic to cats,

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  in their eyes.  You know, they just walk in the house, even though we lock
up the cats,

B.122:  Yeah. 

A.123:  and they're crying. 

B.124:  That's right. 

A.125:  And so some people, unfortunately, of course I wouldn't have an animal if I
was allergic to it either.

B.126:  Well, I wouldn't either. 

A.127:  Uh, my wife at one time, said she was allergic to them. 

B.128:  Uh-huh.  Well I know,

A.129:  I was going to tell you a story,

B.130:  Is it chihuahuas that are supposed to be good for asthma?  They say
chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma, I always heard?

A.131:  Well, I think the animals is good for you just because, uh, it gets you out
and everything. I, uh.

B.132:  Oh, yeah.  And don't, I think they are using, you know, they are using
animals in old folks home now, and using,

A.133:  Oh, yeah. 

B.134:  in hospitals, because it's supposed to make people, brings your blood
pressure down, you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home.

A.135:  Oh, yeah.  

B.136:  You know they always are just wagging, I don't care how grumpy you are or
what, dogs are glad to see you.  Cats are kind of independent like, Aw, get
in.  They, they let you live with them, you know.

A.137:  Right. 

B.138:  So independent. 

A.139:  I have some friends, uh, uh, that have horses you know. 

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  And when my daughters were a little younger, you know, I thought, well,
maybe that's a good, maybe I'll get them, you know, this is Texas and I'll get
them a horse.

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  Well, we went over and we rode their horses, and everything, but, and, and
just listened to the stories and the money.  The horse was sick all the time.

B.144:  Oh. 

A.145:  I don't know, if you, if you have any friends with horses, but they get all
kinds of eating disorders,

B.146:  Oh. 

A.147:  if they don't, if they don't eat the right kind of grain, or if you,

B.148:  See, I was thinking about buying a horse.  Maybe I don't want to.

A.149:  if you give him an orange or something, you nearly kill it.  I mean it, it,
the stories he would tell,

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month. 

B.152:  Just to,

A.153:  Of course, he had several horses.  We were shocked at different things.  I
thought, my God, and I just saw something interesting in CONSUMER REPORT.
They talked about animals and they compared,

B.154:  Uh-huh. 

A.155:  you know, whether you should have a bird, and the pricing, and it had a
comment on a horse something to the effect of, you don't even want to know
what,

B.156:  [Laughter].

A.157:  it cost to keep a horse, you know [laughter].  And I,

B.158:  I think, I'll just go rent a horse if I want to ride one.  

A.159:  Well, I think the best thing in the world is to rent them, I think that,
uh,

B.160:  Yeah, I do too. 

A.161:  that, and boats probably the same way. 

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  I'd love to have a boat but I think, I'm not too sure I, I would get that
much use out of it, you know.

B.164:  No.  No I do enjoy my dog.  She's such a, aw, she's my best friend.  And
when, when I lived in Orlando, she uh, got paralyzed from her waist down, and,
uh.

A.165:  My goodness, what?

B.166:  And I thought it was, uh, we almost had to put her to sleep and I just
cried for two days, but I think what ironically, what happened was she had
fleas, and I think it was the stuff that I had putting on her that, that
paralyzed her.

A.167:  My goodness. 

B.168:  But, the fleas, I think what brought her back, is she had to scratch so bad
that she started using her paralyzed, but the doctor was just amazed at a,

A.169:  Yeah. 

B.170:  that she came back.  Because he really was going, was going to do surgery
for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep.  And I was going to have to
opt to put her to sleep, as much as I loved her I wasn't going to spend
fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment.

A.171:  Yeah, plus I'm not too sure, yeah, I think they are experiments too, and
they don't know that much.

B.172:  No. 

A.173:  My sister spent a lot of.  Go ahead.

B.174:  But it was that spot that they put on the back of a dog, they used to use
it on cattle, and, uh, so I using it on her and I'd take her to the vet once a
month, and get that spot put on her and she wouldn't have any fleas.  Never
had any fleas.

A.175:  Huh.

B.176:  Then all of a sudden, I took her, I was living in Orlando and I, I put her
in the vet while I came home to Dallas for a while and when I took, I picked
her up she had fleas again and so my daughter came down and visited from
Dallas, and while she was there the dog got paralyzed.

A.177:  Huh.

B.178:  So I took her back up to the doctor and anyway he, he said it wasn't that,
but another doctor told me that there had been, the pet owners had been
getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on
them.

A.179:  My goodness. 

B.180:  So, I thought well, so I can't find a vet that will do that for me anymore,
put the spot on her anymore and I don't want it anymore anyway.

A.181:  Yeah. 

B.182:  But I do fight fleas.  Oh, gosh.  

A.183:  Oh yeah, they're, they're a problem, the different rainy seasons here.  I
don't, how long you been here, in, in the area?

B.184:  Oh, I moved back in eighty-eight.  December of eighty-eight. 

A.185:  Oh, so, you were here before?

B.186:  Yeah, I lived here before, I worked for T I for seventeen years and then I
moved to Orlando,

A.187:  Okay. 

B.188:  With Mark and Marietta. And let me talk about fleas, we have nothing
compared to fleas that they have down there.

A.189:  Oh, really? 

B.190:  they have them year round.  At least they die out here kind of in the
wintertime here in the yard,

A.191:  Yeah. 

B.192:  down there they don't, they're are just, and they are big suckers, I mean
big.

A.193:  Oh, really? 

B.194:  And they are just almost impossible to get rid of.  

A.195:  Oh. 

B.196:  If you have a pet, you're going to have fleas down there. 

A.197:  Oh, yeah. 

B.198:  And I just had my house treated and treated and treated, and I did all the
things you're supposed to and I couldn't get rid of them.
