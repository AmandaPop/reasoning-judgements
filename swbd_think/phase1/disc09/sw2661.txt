=========================================================================

@B.1:  So eating out.  What are you interested in in restaurants? 

A.2:  Right, uh.  We eat out quite a bit, it's just my husband and I at home now.
So.

B.3:  Uh, once a week, twice a week?

A.4:  Oh, at least once a week.  We're, we're retired now.  When we working out
we ate out more than that [laughter].

B.5:  Yeah, I understand. 

A.6:  Uh. 

B.7:  Uh, but we both work and we have a daughter, and we normally manage to eat
out once a week anyway. 

A.8:  Uh-huh.  Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?

B.9:  Uh, really, I'm kind of open on food.  I'm what you might call a culinary
adventurer.  I'll,

A.10:  [Laughter]. 

B.11:  uh, try anything once. 

A.12:  Right. 

B.13:  Been on a real barbecue kick lately. 

A.14:  Oh have you? 

B.15:  Yeah. 

A.16:  We like Chinese.  We eat,

B.17:  [Cough]. 

A.18:  a lot of Chinese food. 

B.19:  Excuse me.  Uh, yeah, we usually have Chinese once a month. 

A.20:  What do you look for in a restaurant?

B.21:  I hate franchised restaurants. 

A.22:  You what? You,

B.23:  I despise --

A.24:  Oh I,

B.25:  -- franchised restaurants.  I, I, I always prefer to go to something that
seems more family run. 

A.26:  Right. 

B.27:  Uh, some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into
their home for dinner almost. 

A.28:  I know what you mean.  I like some ambiance, and I like good food.  I don't
like fast food hamburgers [laughter] and all of that. 

B.29:  I don't, but I don't like something fake or put on either. 

A.30:  Uh-huh. 

B.31:  You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large
restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.

A.32:  Uh-huh. 

B.33:  And [breathing] I don't know why that is.  I think it's probably due to
pricing, often. 

A.34:  Right, uh-huh.  I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it
[laughter]. 

B.35:  Well, yeah, yeah,

A.36:  I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really --

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  -- with high prices and seven courses isn't what I usually look for
[laughter]. 

B.39:  It is what you look for?

A.40:  It isn't, no that isn't what I look for. 

B.41:  Oh, isn't, isn't.  Uh, I try to get my money's worth. 

A.42:  Right [laughter]. 

B.43:  And not just that, I try to, well, that's a big part of it.  I try to get
my money's worth.

A.44:  Uh-huh. 

B.45:  You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and, and flavor
and texture and care. 

A.46:  Presentation and,

B.47:  Well, presentation's not always all of it either. 

A.48:  Well, like --

B.49:  It's, it's important. 

A.50:  -- we, we've been eating some in a restaurant that [throat_clearing] that
just changed hands recently, and we're trying to give them a little patronage.
But Sunday we went there, and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops
and a baked apple and potatoes.

B.51:  Uh-huh. 

A.52:  So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something
like that [laughter]. 

B.53:  Yeah, yeah, something a little extra --

A.54:  Yeah, that's what I mean by,

B.55:  -- and just for color if nothing else. 

A.56:  Right, uh-huh.  It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate. 

B.57:  Yeah, yeah.  What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss
home cooked Mexican.

A.58:  Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex. 

B.59:  Yeah, home cooked Tex-Mex. 

A.60:  [Laughter]. 

B.61:  Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation. 

A.62:  Right, I know.  Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico, and
we've really gotten to like, we like the real Mexican food --

B.63:  Yeah. 

A.64:  -- better than Tex-Mex. 

B.65:  Well, there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican, you know,
by third or fourth generation Americans --

A.66:  Right. 

B.67:  -- of Hispanic heritage. 

A.68:  It's all pretty good, isn't it?

B.69:  Oh, yes, and, and there's big differences, of course, and, of course, when
you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American
food or Chinese food, [noise]  {dishes in background} because {pause} its
regional, too. 

A.70:  Right, uh-huh, that's true. 

B.71:  So. 

A.72:  I'm originally from Maine, so we like seafood, too.  And that's something
we don't get here, and we're in the mountains in Virginia.

B.73:  Oh. 

A.74:  And most of the seafood's frozen. 

B.75:  Uh, yeah that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.  No fresh, or almost
no fresh seafood --

A.76:  Right. 

B.77:  -- and in Texas we got it from the Gulf. 

A.78:  Uh-huh, that's true.  Lots of shrimp. 

B.79:  And, yeah, here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on
vacation.  {pause} And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for
almost a week. 

A.80:  I know it [laughter]. 

B.81:  And it was, {pause} I was like a man starving at every meal. 

A.82:  [Laughter]  I know the feeling.  We do the same thing.  My son-in-law is a
Texan, and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a
day, all the time he's up there [laughter]. 

B.83:  It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it? Lobster?

A.84:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like --

B.85:  It's like shrimp on the Gulf. 

A.86:  -- two ninety-eight a pound for a pound lobster. 

B.87:  Two ninety-eight a pound. 

A.88:  Yeah. 

B.89:  That's as cheap as steaks some places --

A.90:  Oh yeah, cheaper, right. 

B.91:  -- I mean in a grocery store. 

A.92:  Right, yeah.  A lot of the restaurants you can get two pou-, two one pound
lobsters for like ten ninety-nine. 

B.93:  Oh, my gosh.  I've got to go to Maine then [noise]  {dishes rattling in
background}.

A.94:  [Laughter]. 

B.95:  You may have sold a trip for some time. 

A.96:  Yeah, it's a good place to go. 

B.97:  Uh, it sounds wonderful.  Uh, so,

A.98:  Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there. 

B.99:  That sound good.  Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little
{pause} uh, seafood shacks, we've called them. 

A.100:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.101:  And, uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been
frozen. 

A.102:  Uh-huh. 

B.103:  You know {pause} --

A.104:  We went to Gal-,

B.105:  -- shrimp straight out of the bay. 

A.106:  We were in Galveston last year aft-, right aft-, well, the first of this
year, actually. 

B.107:  Hm. 

A.108:  And, ate in a restaurant, and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the
Gulf coast. 

B.109:  Was it true?

A.110:  No.  It wasn't.  On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a
billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.  And they had, it was
a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way, and they were set up with two
buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and
everything. 

B.111:  Hm. 

A.112:  And then one complete seafood buffet. 

B.113:  Huh. 

A.114:  [Laughter]  That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.  They had
shrimp fixed probably six different ways. 

B.115:  Uh, yes, the cajuns. 

A.116:  Uh-huh, right.  It was wonderful. 

B.117:  They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can. 

A.118:  Uh-huh. 

B.119:  So, have you eaten crawfish yet?

A.120:  Uh, I tried it, but I didn't care for it.  Not there, but at my brothers I
tried it. 

B.121:  Oh, as with anything, it's preparation. 

A.122:  That's probably true.  It, I wasn't hungry, it wasn't a meal.  We just, he
went down and bought some at a --

B.123:  Uh. 

A.124:  -- local place that steams them, just so we'd try them. 

B.125:  Uh-huh.  It, there's all kinds,

A.126:  Probably needed some cold beer with it and [laughter], 

B.127:  [Laughter]  So you do eat out a lot. 

A.128:  Quite a bit. 

B.129:  One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning
brunches. 

A.130:  Oh. 

B.131:  You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches. 

A.132:  Right.  We used to do that, once in a while, but we don't anymore. 

B.133:  Uh, we still find it fun. 

A.134:  Uh-huh.  It's fun, but it's just so much food [laughter].  Hate to come
away feeling uncomfortable [laughter].

B.135:  Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor. 

A.136:  Do you, well that makes a difference. 

B.137:  And so,

A.138:  Where do you go to brunches? Like at hotels, or restaurants there?

B.139:  Yeah, uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain.  Shoney's. 

A.140:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.  We eat at Shoney's. 

B.141:  Yeah, [noise] {dishes rattling} in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly
about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well, but
then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably
like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about
eight thousand foot elevation. 

A.142:  Oh. 

B.143:  And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the
mountains and have breakfast. 

A.144:  Uh-huh, that sounds nice. 

B.145:  It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning. 

A.146:  Right, I imagine it is. 

B.147:  I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast
brunch.  You know, and it's not that far.  It's thirty miles. 

A.148:  Whe-, out of, which direction?

B.149:  Colorado Springs. 

A.150:  Out of, which direction from there?

B.151:  West --

A.152:  Uh-huh. 

B.153:  -- west out of Colorado Springs.
