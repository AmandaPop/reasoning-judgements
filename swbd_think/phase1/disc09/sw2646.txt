===========================================================================

A.1:  Dining out seems to be a, uh, something we do off and on in our lives I
guess as economics and as kids come and go,

B.2:  # Right.  #

A.3:  # and # the situations change, uh,

B.4:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

A.5:  # we used to # do quite a bit of dining out before the children and then
the, they came along and, uh, additional expenses, sitting came into every
dinner out, uh, that, that, halted a lot of it as well as just the, the, uh,
oh, I guess the lifestyle changes a little bit,

B.6:  # Right.  #

A.7:  # slows # down a little bit and now even the atmosphere that, that, we
would seek, uh, when we go out is often more quiet,

B.8:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.9:  # and, # uh, a little bit more, uh, subdued, uh, not smoke filled or bar,
uh,

B.10:  [Laughter]  Yeah, funny how that happens after kids, right?

A.11:  dance floor type, yeah, so, that, uh, those type of qualities have, uh,
moved into the picture and then there's, there's some economic concern but
usually it's, if, if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a decent
meal and, and, uh, fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the
immediate area that's totally really expensive.  You have to go a ways to get
to a really,

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.13:  # high # dollar, uh, hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal,

B.14:  # Yeah.  #

A.15:  # which # they're forty to fifty miles away and they're, they're all-around
but they're just a ways so,

B.16:  # Yes.  #

A.17:  # we # can do a good, um, twenty, twenty-five dollar night out and have a
decent steak and it comes out okay. 

B.18:  Right. 

A.19:  Uh, we look for, I guess, uh, service, uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not in
eating at McDonalds long enough, the fastest, the speed of it doesn't bother
me.  You know,

B.20:  # [Laughter].  #

A.21:  # I'm # not looking for fast food at that night, so, the fact that it took
them twenty and thirty minutes to get it there, that's, that's okay, I'm, uh,
that's twenty minutes away from the kids or however long, you know, you're out
for the evening or,

B.22:  # Right, that's right.  #

A.23:  # it doesn't really # matter that they not get it there right away,

B.24:  # Right.  #

A.25:  # but, # um, have a little chime, little hard time finding a place that
will cook the steak just right.  I have to remember how to ask for it for this
given restaurant to get it just the way I like it without too much pink in
there and, uh, get it cooked good.

B.26:  I imagine, uh, in, in Texas there would be a lot of steak restaurants, is
that right?

A.27:  Yeah, there seem to be,

B.28:  # Yeah.  #

A.29:  # quite # a few, quite a few. 

B.30:  Uh-huh and now on this area, of course, here in Maryland you're close to
the Chesapeake there seems to, there is some, there are some steak restaurants
but they lean more towards seafood here.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Steak and lobster (( )).

B.32:  Uh, you probably have seafood a lot also. 

A.33:  Yeah, they do oddly enough even being near the gulf, uh, they tend to
advertise the, the main, the whole east coast, uh, seafood for some reason.  It
tends to be a draw,

B.34:  # Oh, is that right? [laughter].  #

A.35:  # I don't know particularly why, # I mean, to me it tastes pretty much the
same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it, you know,

B.36:  Right.  Well, do you have crabs and lobster in that area that's,

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  Yeah, that's, that's,

A.39:  Yeah, crab and lobster and, and, uh,

B.40:  Huh.  That's funny that they would [laughter]. 

A.41:  Yeah, they withdraw from that I guess, you know, you can ship stuff
anywhere pretty much and, uh,

B.42:  Right, right, right.  And you probably have craw-, would you have crawfish?

A.43:  Uh, probably, I'm not a big fan of that so I wouldn't,

B.44:  # Yeah.  #

A.45:  # wouldn't # be paying much attention to it, um,

B.46:  Yeah, well, a lot of what you said, uh, sounds similar to us.  I remember
that, uh, bef-, before we had children, we have two boys that are like nine
and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to learn to be,
[laughter], (( )) in a restaurant so before we had kids we would definitely
dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to
be necessarily anything fancy but it was more, uh, a matter of before children
say, we were both working, we didn't feel like cooking, we just went out.  And
now, you know, as you said once you've children that's not always an option,
uh, I worked off and on, um, you know, because they were little and, and also,
you know, once you're home and you have them, um, [breathing], places that you
went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual, um, sometimes
it's not [laughter], worth it to go through the trouble,

A.47:  # Right.  #

B.48:  # of # digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what I have
found now that, um, when we do go out, uh, as you said you out on it, now when
we go out it's, it's, you want it to be more special [laughter], 

A.49:  # {Very faint} Uh-huh.  #

B.50:  # you don't want # to just, uh, necessarily run out for, you know, a, one
hour and come back.  I noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do
try to make it something nice, maybe a dinner, theater, or nice restaurant with
friends.  Um, sometimes lunches when we can do that, that's okay, too but, um,
it definitely, you know, it definitely changes, is changed we maybe eaten
somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do, [laughter] go,

A.51:  # Right.  #

B.52:  # there's # so, there's a, li-, a special quality to that because it is a
few hours, [laughter]  away from the kids,

A.53:  # Right.  #

B.54:  # and, # um, but not as often we don't do it as often.  Um, and what I'm
finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into
going again with them and, of course, when you take them though you're going to
go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style
restaurant,

A.55:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.56:  # uh, # but in this area there, there are quite a few decent restaurants
that are not too expensive and, uh, and, I, I tend to agree with you too we
look for more, um, uh, quiet ty-, more of a subdued atmosphere now and I think
part of that is after you have kids you're, you're not as interested in going
to, uh, Georgetown type places where, you know, you go in every place and
there's a lot of, uh, noise [laughter],

A.57:  # Right.  #

B.58:  # yelling # and, uh, you know, you look for different things and that crowd
seems to change and, you know, your not as much part of it, um, and you don't,
there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs, you know, and that
type of thing, uh, you don't necessarily have to go downtown D C to, to find
decent restaurants and, uh, there's a lot that are moderately priced also
whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's, there's quite a
selection in this area. 

A.59:  There's a, uh, one place that, really not sure if the marketing concept is,
is carried throughout it's chain, but in this particular town, um, I live about
two suburbs north of Dallas actually,

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.61:  # and # in this particular town we're about two miles from this, uh, this
steak house that has a, oh, I don't know, a motif to the entire, uh, shopping
center it's, it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center I guess. 

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  And they'll, the entire place is, um, has covered walkways all-around to
all the little shops that are, they're not, they're not even individual shops
in some cases.  Some cases are just kind of you, they, they put it all out in
a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # um, # then there are, there's one, two hole rows actually of, of just
what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and
they're all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this
little spot, ((though)) the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers
market type,

B.66:  # Oh, I see.  #

A.67:  # so, we went # to this steak house once, uh, well, several times but the
most particular time that we were away from the kids and, and had a, a good
length of time and it was on a Friday night and we get a place that would be
really busy but we, we got there about six or six thirty and put our names on
the list of, of the waiting list, and then we walked around the, uh, the place
that has, there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of
hand, uh, craft type stuff,

B.68:  # Yeah, that's nice.  #

A.69:  # being sold, uh, # there was a blacksmith and he's showing off his little
traits and things that he could sell as well as, uh, uh, the hallways between
the places that where of, of business the hallways were decorated with, uh, old
pictures and history,

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # of, # of the town as it were and we killed about an hour or so doing that
because it was about an hour and a half wait to get,

B.72:  # Wow [laughter].  #

A.73:  # into the # restaurant.  And then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or
so thirty or forty-five minutes there and then, uh, came back out, and walked
around a little bit more and went home so.  It, it's quite an interesting, uh,
deal they don't even take reservations because they're so booked like that,

B.74:  Wow, jeez, well, if I'm here also, there's been such a growth in, in
housing, uh, not in the last year but before that it was just, I don't know if
you've been in this area in the last few years, but it's just been incredible
and has, it's gone crazy, I mean, where we are was basically a farm ten years
ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that, um, some
the commercial, um, uh, places have not caught up with the population here and
so we do have a problem of the, the half decent restaurants when you go on a
Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait. 

A.75:  Huh. 

B.76:  And, um, not all of them do take reservations either, so, [laughter], so
you sometimes have to allot yourself, uh, enough time, um, you know, to go
out, uh, you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours, you know,
um, the other thing that's changing here is because of the, um, the age set
here, uh, a lot, mostly people in they're I'd say late twenty's to early
forty's in these neighborhoods that, uh, we haven't done it because I don't
think it will work well with us having two boys but, um, some of the more
expensive restaurants now I understand are catering, um, to children and
making half price menus for them,

A.77:  # Huh.  #

B.78:  # whereas # before, um, they would be totally discouraged from bringing
children in.  And they're doing this basically because they're so many working
parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all
these younger people were having children they weren't going on the
restaurants. 

A.79:  Right.
