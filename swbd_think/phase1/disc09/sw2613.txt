==========================================================================

A.1:  So, what do you think about it.

B.2:  Well, uh, I've noticed some changes over the past, uh, thirty years, that,
that,

A.3:  Um, for the worst I would assume.

B.4:  it's gotten worse.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  I can remember, uh, back in the early sixties when I first started flying
a light plane, it was quite common for me to take off from, uh, local airport
here and see the, uh, Appalachian mountains and the Chesapeake Bay at the same
time.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And in the, you know, fifteen years later, it was a rare occasion that I
could see both,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  at the same time.

A.11:  You're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by now [laughter].

B.12:  Yeah, I know, uh, lot of times when I was coming back home, I would, uh,
file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area.

A.13:  Um.

B.14:  But I counted on North Carolina having some good weather for me.

A.15:  Well, I'll tell you, I don't know, I, I don't know whether, I, I, I count
the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here.

B.16:  Well down there you get, uh, uh, some more aromatic aromas like the, uh,
the smell of the pine forest, and, uh,

A.17:  It depends on where you are, now if you're over,

B.18:  then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while.

A.19:  Yeah, if yo-, if you're over by Asheville, you're pretty good because
you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that.
Over here in Raleigh it's kind of flat and stagnant and, just yucky.

B.20:  Um.

A.21:  It's fine over on the coast because you've got the, you've got the breezes
off the, off the water there but, 

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  uh, seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here.

B.24:  Well, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to, uh, solve much of the
problem.

A.25:  No, I don't know, they're, they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to
be doing any good. I was, I was really amazed because I never would have
expected, you know, this problem somewhere like in Atlanta,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:   and I drove through Atlanta, uh, couple of weeks ago, and it was
unseasonably warm and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  And when I drove through, I, it, it was terrible.  I, I had to keep the
windows up, 

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  it was just so thick and, uh, heavy.  Uh, I couldn't believe it, I
because I me-, I used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly
clean, I mean, yo-, you always, you didn't have a problem with stagnant air
like, like L A does.  

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  But, boy it was really bad that day.

B.34:  Well one of the reactions I have is that, uh, they put so much emphasis on
the private automobile --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- uh, as being a major source of pollution and they've, uh, ignored the
trucks entirely.

A.37:  Yeah, right.

B.38:  So, I, I get to going down the expressway in the morning and, uh, I don't
see very many cars smoking, but,

A.39:  But you see all these, all these trucks belching out this black smoke.

B.40:  then I, I get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and they're just
laying out a pall of black smoke.

A.41:  Yeah, I know, it's, I, I, I don't understand where the priority is.  

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  It's, uh, like in Atlanta they have, um, they have mandatory catalytic
converter inspections. There's only three places in Georgia that requires that
and, uh, even with that it hasn't done any good.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  I mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse.  But, you know, just like you
say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just
coughing out all  kinds of stuff.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  You know, I don't know.

B.50:  Yeah, I know along Route Sixty-six, the, uh, people who have residences
there, uh, they can't paint their houses without cleaning them first.

A.51:  Uh-huh, yeah because of the stuff settles on it.

B.52:  Uh, if they're within a block of a major expressway, the houses get coated
with oil.

A.53:  Yeah, yeah,  I don't know.  Things like, you know, well, like acid rain and
all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there, I, I'm more worried about
that than I am just about anything else.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Because, uh, it's, it's all, I mean, it's just li-, it's just like a big
avalanche, you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and
you end up with acid rain, acid rain kills the trees, trees don't scrub the
air, and there you are.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  And then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain
forest as quick as they can.

B.58:  Yeah, I'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that
already. 

A.59:  I wonder too, you know, they keep talking about ozone depletion and all
this.  It, it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're
losing the most, most of the forests.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Because I, I, I think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being
taken out of the air, uh, you know, by the plants and the trees and all that
good stuff and here we are losing it and now the, now it doesn't have any
where to go.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  But ozo-,

B.64:  Well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the East
Coast or at least it seems that way, that, uh, the winters have been milder
for the last five years and, uh,

A.65:  Uh-huh, yeah well it's like our winter here, I mean, it was the winter that
wasn't.

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  You know, we were having, having hot days in December and January and got
in,

B.68:  Yeah, the first, the first winter I moved out here I had a big snow plow,

A.69:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.70:  on the tractor and I had to use it.  We had three, uh, fourteen inch, uh,
snows.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And I haven't used it since.

A.73:  Yeah, you mi-, you might as well sell it for scrap or something because
you probably never will use it.  It's a shame too, because I miss all the cold
weather, I, I enjoy winter.

B.74:  And at the same time I, I see some colder winters in the Midwest.  I think
they've gotten more snow,

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  in the past five years than we're having here on the East Coast.

A.77:  Yeah, we-, it was an interesting day, the other day.  Uh, I think it was,
um, yeah it was last, not, not this past Friday but Friday a week ago.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  We ha-, I don't know, I think you had some bad weather up there too.  We
had tornadoes and everything down here. 

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Um, that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe
weather in the country, on that one day.

B.82:  Oh, I didn't know that.

A.83:  I mean, you know, of course you always have severe weather somewhere, but
there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before.  Over four
hundred reports of tornadoes, hail and heavy winds.

B.84:  Huh.

A.85:  Amazing.  It's a little bit scary.

B.86:  Well it may have been, uh, the fact we had this early season warm spell,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  that did that, because I know that the, the pre-, the preceding day
Thursday, I got my first sunburn for the season out on, uh, Ocean City Beach.

A.89:  Um.  I read an article a couple weeks ago, they were talking about, uh,
talking again about the ozone layer.  They said that uh, the ozone deteriorate
is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major
metropolitan areas.  That's a little bit scary to think about.

B.90:  Yes.

A.91:  Because that's certainly not going to improve things around there.  

B.92:  I didn't notice that, uh, know that they'd discovered any thinness, or,
over me-, metro areas.  I'd only heard about the, uh, North and South Pole.

A.93:  Yeah, well that's, that's, yeah, that had, that had been the thing that had
always, I mean, I, I, I have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of
like a layer and it would move around.  I didn't know that the hole just
stayed there.  You know, I guess, I, I don-, I'm not that much of a
meteorologist, but, uh, yeah, I was a little surprised at that too because up
to that point all I'd heard about was the one over the pole.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And I said well I'm not too awfully concerned about that, if it's going to
start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet, but
opening, opening up over major metropolitan areas, now that's uh, that's,

B.96:  Yeah that, that doesn't, uh, fit my picture of, uh, of, uh, meteorology.  I
can understand the Poles because they're uh, a permanent high pressure area.

A.97:  Yeah, yeah.

B.98:  And, uh, you know, there isn't that much, uh, circulation, but, uh, the
temperate zone is, uh, a constant moving, uh, wind system and it's,  

A.99:  Yeah, course the ozone is up there, so.

B.100:  I'm surprised that the ozone doesn't have it's own wind pattern.

A.101:  Yeah, I, I mean, di-, I don't even know, I don't even know if the ozone
layer does move.  I mean apparently it doesn't, but of course it, it might be
just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper.  Sort of
like cold fusion [laughter].

B.102:  Yeah, cold fusion, right.  The same thought flashed in my mind.

A.103:  Yeah, I'll tell you, I, I was real excited when I first heard that.  I
said hot dog, they finally did it, you know.

B.104:  Yeah, I, uh, I may have put out an exclamation here at home when I heard
that news,

A.105:  Um, I te-, I mean, I'm,

B.106:  and, uh, everybody wanted to know why I was so excited and I tried to
explain to them.

A.107:  Yeah, I mean, I'm an old science fiction buff from way back when I was a
little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of.

B.108:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.109:  And it's the days that I keep looking for that aren't going to happen in
my lifetime. 

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  But, [laughter], you know, we're supposed to have moon colonies by now.
But, uh, yeah, cold fusion would have been great, could have gone, might have
started making a little inroads on air pollution with that.

B.112:  I think so.

A.113:  But, who knows.

B.114:  Except we might have, uh, bad case of ((paladium)) poisoning now.

A.115:  Yeah, yeah, there's, there's always a drawback to everything, I mean, I
don't know.  Well, 

B.116:  I know there was, uh, a pipeline going in up in, uh, southern Pennsylvania
and there was a group in (( )) County that was fighting it and, uh, one of the
women that was leading the group said well, they say they're going to pump,
uh, oil through there, but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity
through it.

A.117:  [Laughter] Okay.
