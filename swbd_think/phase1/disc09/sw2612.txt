===========================================================================

A.1:  Well I've been sort of out of it for a little while so I don't know really
what's going on. 

B.2:  Well, there, there's been some interesting stuff going on locally, but I
suppose nationally the big thing is probably, uh, the reaction to the war in
the Gulf.

A.3:  Yeah, all the Democrats trying, to show that,

B.4:  Trying to cover themselves. 

A.5:  Yeah, oh, oh, gosh, we really did support it, I mean,

B.6:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.7:  #just because# we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything. 

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  Yeah there's been, uh, same thing locally here, a couple of, we got a
Senator who, uh, went on national T V and said, that, you know, if Bush tried
to do anything over there without Congressional approval, they should impeach
him, an.

B.10:  Yeah that's true, there, there's a lot of talk over there, tha-, I don't
think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as, as successful and painless
as it had been. 

A.11:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.12:  #So they# figured a little bit of opposition was safe,

A.13:  #Sure.#

B.14:  #but# it didn't turn out that way. 

A.15:  No.  Uh, I don't know, I, I, usually don't talk politics with people,
especially strangers because it's a good way to get into an argument but,

B.16:  Well that's why, that's why being strangers is safe, we can,

A.17:  it's probably safer, at least n-, can't get hit this way. 

B.18:  That's true, that's true. 

A.19:  But, uh, I, I don't know, I'm, I've been Republican for as long as I can
remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized, and they have been. 

B.20:  That's true.  I, I've been Democrat for, since I've been voting which isn't
that long, but I'll agree with you there,

A.21:  #Yeah, they, uh,#

B.22:  #that there's not# much organization going on. 

A.23:  Yeah, I, I don't know it, right around the turn of, oh gosh, I should say
the eighties now, it's already the nineties, I forgo-,

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  #I# forget that too.  They, they just haven't seemed to been able to hit
anything, uh, on the head.  Ever-, every time they go one way the wind is
always blowing the other, which is,

B.26:  Well that's true, but I suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties
because, uh, Reagan was just so overwhelming to them. 

A.27:  #Yeah.#

B.28:  #I# think we're seeing some of that unraveling these days but,

A.29:  Yeah, no, I don't, I don't know how they're going, uh, I, you know, I'm
look, I'm looking at the upcoming elections and I'm trying to think, who are
they going to put up. 

B.30:  Well they've already got, uh, oh, gee, there's, there's already one
candidate that I know of on the Democratic end and I keep thinking there's a
second one, uh, Paul (( )).

A.31:  Oh, (( )).

B.32:  Yeah, uh, out of Massachusetts, I think. 

A.33:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind him too much, he's a pretty good guy.  He's been
around and he's, he keeps a low profile and doesn't go after the headlines and
stuff, uh. 

B.34:  Uh-huh.  I've, I've, I've heard the name but that, that's the extent of my,
my information about him. 

A.35:  Yeah, I, I would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  #I, I,#

B.38:  #Try to# get the conservative candidate for once. 

A.39:  Yeah, I mean, if, ou-, out of all the Democrats that I could think to run,
I, he is one that I would, I would definitely like to see. 

B.40:  That, that would be interesting, I, I must admit I haven't been really
enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants in the last couple of run throughs. 

A.41:  Well, I'll tell you, if they, if they do it like they did, uh, the last
time around, it's not going to be very exciting.

B.42:  #[Breathing].#

A.43:  #You# know, uh, I mean, let's face if Dukakis and, and Bentsen.  Good
grief.  Surely they could have done better than that.  Course they, they had
a, they had themselves between a rock and a hard place.  They had, on the one
hand, they had Jesse Jackson with all that support and on the other, they knew
ver-,

B.44:  But completely unelectable and,

A.45:  Oh sure, and, and, they could not give him the nomination. 

B.46:  True [dishes]. 

A.47:  (( )).

B.48:  It's, it's probably, their, their troubles probably stem from the fact that
they're such a diverse party. 

A.49:  #Yeah.#

B.50:  #And# the nominating rules these days are so, um, pseudodemocratic, I
guess. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  You can't have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we
really get elected. 

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  Instead there's so much,

A.55:  I mean, I mean they were really stuck, because here they were everybody was
expecting Je-, Jesse to get at least the V P nomination. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  Uh, certainly not presidential, but, but, quite possibly V P.  And here
they are, they, they know very well they can't do it because if they do it's
going to split the party.

B.58:  #[Noise].#

A.59:  #And# if they do it, they're going to alienate a whole bunch of others, so
I mean, they were stuck one way or the other.  Yeah, it was an interesting
thing, I was laughing through the whole thing, uh. 

B.60:  True, I suppose being on the other side of the aisle, it probably made good
comic theater. 

A.61:  Yeah, I, it, it was, it was, it was comical.  I, I sat there and watched
the, watched C N N and just giggle all night, you know, uh, this is great. 

B.62:  #[Breathing].#

A.63:  #George# Bush is in. 

B.64:  Yeah, that's true, that's true. 

A.65:  And I think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people
gave him credit for. 

B.66:  I, I must admit, I'm, I'm, I, I still find him a little uninspiring.  He,
he seems like a reasonably competent,

A.67:  #Yeah, he is, he,# 

B.68:  #person to sort of,#

A.69:  yeah, he, he is. 

B.70:  do, do some caretaking ty-, um. 

A.71:  Yeah, and, and I, wonder, you know, if, if that's, I mean, that real, that
really should be all we need in a president.  Someone who is capable of
managing. 

B.72:  True. 

A.73:  And that's all a president is anyway, just a manager. 

B.74:  Sort of set the agenda and, and,

A.75:  #Uh, set the agenda and,#

B.76:  #let, let people do the# work.  It's, it's unfortunate how, how little
domestic agenda he, he worries about. 

A.77:  Yeah, well, you know the re-, Republicans have always been weak on, on the
domestic side.  They're, they're very big on international stuff but
domestically they, they just say, well, it'll take care of itself, but it's,

B.78:  True, but, uh, so many of his comp-, campaign promises were on the,

A.79:  #Yeah.#

B.80:  #the# domestic promises. 

A.81:  Well, you know, same old, you know, take it with a grain of salt stuff, you
know.  He, he,

B.82:  True.  That, that's, that's what just amazes me though is that, that so
many people do, uh, take the campaign promises seriously.

A.83:  Yeah, yeah, and they still do, e-,

B.84:  Well the, the one thing that just amazed me, in, in Texas here, there were
a series of, um, ads saying don't vote for Dukakis, he's going to take away
your right to own a gun, he's going to close down defense plants, he's going
to do this, he's going to do that.

A.85:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.86:  Half of which is coming true. 

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  And I ju-, here's my chance to giggle, boy it's a good thing we didn't
elect that Dukakis guy, because I me-,

A.89:  Yeah, well you know the interesting thing about, I don't know if you've
been watching Massachusetts lately, uh,

B.90:  I, I know that the, the Massachusetts miracle has, has gone by. 

A.91:  Oh it's a disaster, it's a disaster, and the thing was it was all quick
fixes, finger in the dike sort of thing,

B.92:  #Uh-huh.#

A.93:  #to# make him look good for the upcoming race. 

B.94:  Oh, I, I guess I didn't hear that.  I didn't go over it really. 

A.95:  Well, I mean, that, that's what you can infer from it, because it,

B.96:  #True, true, I suppose.#

A.97:  #it's amazing that it# started about two years before the, the, the run,
and then, you know, it took a few years to crap out, but I mean it was dying
last year.  I lived up in Boston,

B.98:  #Uh-huh [dishes].#

A.99:  #and, I# mean, it was terrible.  It was absolutely terrible.  Prices are
just unbelievable up there.  And the services are getting terrible. 
Everything's going down the tubes.  {Pause}. Said he was going to clean up
Boston Harbor and it's dirtier than it ever was. 

B.100:  Yeah, that really disappointing, it's, it's sort of,

A.101:  Yeah, and then on the other hand too, while he was out busy running for the
presidential thing, the legislature was having their own way. 

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  And, uh, you know, it was ju-, it was a pure disaster because the way it
was set up, he's the one that, that put it together and he's the only one who
knew how it worked, or supposedly worked and he wasn't there to run it.

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  And so here's a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda, uh,
legislators with their own agenda and of course the thing just fell a, fell to
pieces.  And he couldn't do anything with it.  It was amazing, they had a poll
last year about, I guess it was around July, uh,

B.106:  #[Tapping].#

A.107:  #they# showed the picture of Dukakis to people in Massachusetts, only
twenty-three percent could recognize him as governor [laughter]. 

B.108:  [Laughter]  That's incredible. 

A.109:  #It was.#

B.110:  #Oh, oh,# there's, there's one thing I've got to ask you about, the the
dump Quayle movement.  I find that interesting. 

A.111:  I wish they would. 

B.112:  I, I find him such an embarrassment. 

A.113:  #Yeah, I,#

B.114:  #and, I# mean, the, the idea of Collin Powell, well he's so powerfu-, uh,
he's so popular now. 

A.115:  Yeah. 

B.116:  I, I don't know if he's the, the right one to replace him, he'd probably be
a perfectly competent replacement but,

A.117:  Boy I'll tell yo-, he, I'll tell you what, you know, when I was in the Air
Force, I met, I met Collin Powell. 

B.118:  Really?

A.119:  Yeah, I was, I had a pretty neat job, I got to meet all the big wigs, used
to fly with the president and all that stuff.  Um, Collin Powell is one capable
guy.  He,

B.120:  I, ge-, I, I, I would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable
than Quayle. 

A.121:  Oh yes, absolutely.  I, I mean the [throat_clearing], 

B.122:  It's, it's interesting to hear that Bush has in, instead of just making
bland pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really
emphatically come out and said no way. 

A.123:  I know, I, and I, I'll tell you, you know, it I, I my degree was in
political science, because I enjoyed it. 

B.124:  Uh-huh. 

A.125:  And I had a good time during that, during that election but it floored me
when he came up with Quayle, because there are so many other capable
Republicans, I mean,

B.126:  Well, from, from some of the things I've heard about Bush he, he didn't
want a vice president that was any competition for him.

A.127:  Yeah, uh, I mean, certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on. 

B.128:  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  And not that Bob Dole would even take the position, I mean, he'd be giving
up more than he'd gain, but there are several people who are, who are just
super capable.  But to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that he's
carrying.

B.130:  #Uh-huh [dishes].#

A.131:  #I, uh,# it just astounded me, I mean he must have been so sure of winning
that it didn't make any difference. 

B.132:  Well, it, uh, uh, I'm, I guess I'm the, I'm cloudy on the timing but there,
there was quite a while when his certain victory wasn't certain at all. 

A.133:  #Yeah, I well,#

B.134:  #I'm, I'm not# sure how that timing related to the Quayle announcement but
he was trailing at, at times, or, or just neck and neck, I guess. 

A.135:  Yeah, I, yeah, about that time I think it was neck and neck.  And I, the
only, the only reason at the time that I could think of was that he was young
and, and sort of charismatic in, uh, in, uh, handsome sort of way. 

B.136:  Uh-huh. 

A.137:  And hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or
something.  But the guy is so uncharismatic. 

B.138:  #[Laughter].#

A.139:  #I# mean, [breathing]  I mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli,
well that's how, how I think of Dan Quayle as broccoli, you know. 

B.140:  [Laughter]  Oh, that brings up another subject, it's the, the, the, uh, I
don't know, the,
