============================================================================

A.1:  Well what's, uh, what's the best experience you can come up with, uh, as
far as camping.

B.2:  Oh, gee, the first one that comes to my mind is, uh, camping outside the
river at the, uh, at New Braunfels there.

A.3:  Oh, man that sounds like a blast.

B.4:  Yeah, we've gone down there many a year.

A.5:  Is that right.

B.6:  Riding the river rapids.

A.7:  Yeah, tha-, that's where you just float down the river, right, on tubes
an,

B.8:  Yeah, well they have some, you know, half way decent rapids there.

A.9:  I see.

B.10:  It's not DELIVERANCE, but it's pretty good.

A.11:  [Laughter]  Well that sounds pretty neat.  I guess, I guess for me, uh, uh,
probably the last time I went camping was, uh, back in high school with Boy
Scouts.  We  always took an annual trip up to, uh, Colorado and went fly
fishing.

B.12:  Oh really.

A.13:  And, uh, we had, we had a blast up there.

B.14:  Yeah, I never tried that [talking].

A.15:  It, it was nice going up there and see that scenery.

B.16:  Well, I, uh, we've done quite a bit of camping, we, uh, used to, uh, throw
everything in, we had some old Volkswagen buses in our ye-, early days when
we had kids and they, uh, [clicking] we'd, uh, you know, go, uh, drive
up into the hill country around, uh, oh, New Braunfels,

A.17:  I see.

B.18:  and San Marcus around in through there,

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  Austin, up around Austin area, just camp out.

A.21:  I see.  Did they have some pretty good campsites up there?

B.22:  Yeah, uh, usually we'd go, uh, like the state parks, a lot of the state
parks up in through there.

A.23:  I see.

B.24:  There's quite a few of them up there, uh.  We started off pretty ro-, you
know pretty much roughing it and we had like I say, the Volkswagen bus, we'd
pull up and just, I had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the
doors.  I'd hooked on a little extension and made a tarp for, [laughter] the
side and, and, uh,

A.25:  [Laughter].

B.26:  and we were set up in about five minutes, ten minutes.  (( )).

A.27:  [Laughter] That was a regular party machine, huh.

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  And then, we, uh, later on we started using a tent when we'd go to, uh,
you know, tent camping.

A.31:  I see, that sounds pretty neat.

B.32:  We enjoyed it, uh, we had three kids and, uh, they've done a lot of
camping with us,

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  and they seemed to like it.

A.35:  Yeah, I remember, uh, going with my parents, uh, we weren't very good
campers.  It seemed like we were never prepared and, uh, we, I grew up right
around Amarillo, up in the very northern part of Texas,

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  and, uh, we had a couple of lakes out there that we'd go and, and go
fishing and then camp out and, uh, seemed like it always rain or something,
you know, something had to go wrong.  

B.38:  [Laughter] Ha.

A.39:  And, uh, we were never prepared for it.  So, uh, it wasn't, it wasn't
until Boy Scouts that I really started enjoying, uh, going out and camping.

B.40:  Pretty, uh, pretty rough up around Amarillo, isn't it [laughter].

A.41:  It sure is.  Uh, in fact, we went up there for Easter and, and we, we had,
uh, a beautiful day, we had a day where it snowed and then, uh, it rained the
next day, and, you know, you just never can tell what the weather's going to
do.

B.42:  That's my, uh, one of my wife's favorite stories to tell about Easter
camping trips, it, the coldest Easter ever.

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  We left here, uh, we left here it was shorts weather, in, uh, on Easter,

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  an we went up and were going to spend on the ((Blanco)) River, [laughter]
and we got there and a front come through and it was, [laughter] it was
freezing.

A.47:  Oh Lord [laughter].

B.48:  We didn't, of course, weren't prepared for it, so.

A.49:  Ye-, right.  Oh and there's nothing worse when you're out camping if you
get wet, you know it,

B.50:   We sat there, my brother-in-law cooked chicken, bless, and he was,
don't know how in heck he managed to do it but he did, he stood out there
and cooked that and we had something hot to eat but,

A.51:  [Laughter] That's hilarious.

B.52:  We got up the next morning and she said, I don't know about you, but,
she said I'm going into town and we're going to buy some long johns.

A.53:  [Laughter].  

B.54:  So, I was ready,

A.55:  I'm surprised you didn't just pack up and go home, I tel-,

B.56:  I was ready to go back to Houston [laughter].

A.57:  That's right, that's right.  Oh, Lord, I guess everybody's got those
experiences when, uh, when things just didn't, didn't go right for them.

B.58:  Yeah, that's, uh, sometimes turns into fun, I think, another similar one
was when we'd go, uh, up to Bastrop Stra-, State Park there in, uh, kind of
got caught by the cold weather and, we, uh, gathered what firewood we could
and built us a campfire you know and,

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  sat around there, into the wee hours, and, uh, ran out of firewood, so,
we, uh, each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles
and throwing them on the fire.

A.61:  Oh, Lord [laughter].

B.62:  And they didn't last very long, but they burned hot.

A.63:  Oh, Lord [rattling].

B.64:  I remember that, that was a lot of fun.

A.65:  [Laughter] That is funny, bu-,

B.66:  We, uh, most recently, we still go camping every, well not as much
anymore, we, our kids are pretty near grown,

A.67:  Really.

B.68:  and, uh, I, uh, we had, uh, we've used a tent, you know pop up trailer.

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  We've done some camping in that.  We still go down to the river, at least
try to get down there once a year.

A.71:  I see.

B.72:  New Braunfels.

A.73:  Do they have, uh, actual camp sites there where you can go an,

B.74:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.75:  I see.

B.76:  They're some, they're some what, you'd call primitive.  I mean there are
no, uh, real [throat_clearing],

A.77:  Facilities, or, yeah.

B.78:  facilities and then others that have, uh, there's a few that have hot and
cold, uh, you know electricity and, and hot water and so forth.  There's a few
of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance.

A.79:  Oh, you do have to make reservations there.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Yeah, because it's, you know, it is so nice and there limited space, so, 

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  we usually, if we're going we usually try and make them by March or so,
anyway.

A.85:  Oh, I see, huh,  I didn't realize that.

B.86:  It's uh, yeah, it's uh, pretty nice.

A.87:  Since it's so popular it's best, uh, to have the reservations, huh.

B.88:  Well if you want to get a good camp site, yeah.

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  You can go down and get a camp site pretty near any weekend.  They get
pretty crowded on the, uh, you know, the main July, Fourth of July and,

A.91:  Right, Memorial Day and whatever.

B.92:  yeah and Labor Day. 

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  That water can get pretty cold, though,

A.95:  #Is that right?#

B.96:  #if you go too early.#

A.97:  When's the best time to go down there for the water. 

B.98:  We try not to go before, uh, July because, uh, it takes, uh --

A.99:  It takes that long to get it heat up.

B.100:  -- gets warmed up.  Yeah, it comes out of the, Canyon Lake up there, and
it's uh, [throat_clearing] comes out of that deep lake and it's pretty cold
water, you know.

A.101:  I see, huh, because my wife and I had thought about going down there, uh,
you know just for a weekend.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  Because we have some friends from, uh, that went to school in San Marcus,

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  at South Texas and, uh, they're always talking about how they rode the,
uh, those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun, that'd be a
fun weekend.

B.106:  Well in addition to, to the river, what we call, it's the Guadalupe River,
it's, uh, has campsites all along the river, uh, but then there's also Camp
((Warnicke)) where you can get cabins, you know, it's right on the (( ))
River.

A.107:  Huh.

B.108:  downtown New Braunfels.

A.109:  I see.

B.110:  And then they have the, uh, what they call the shoot, which is, uh, it's a
bypass around the dam where they have, uh, the canal comes right through the
downtown part of New Braunfels.

A.111:  Huh.

B.112:  That's a lot of fun.

A.113:  Yeah, so you can actually rent cabins there?

B.114:  Yeah, uh-huh, at, uh, Camp ((Warnicke)).

A.115:  And that's in, that's in New Braunfels proper.

B.116:  Right in, yeah, right in, uh, almost right in downtown.

A.117:  Huh.

B.118:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] that's a lot of fun, then they have a, uh,
there's a commercial water park there called the Schlitterbahn which is a
barrel of fun,

A.119:  I see.

B.120:  especially if you've got kids.

A.121:  Yeah, yeah.

B.122:  They have tube ride, tube shoots and just, and so many rides you ca-,
almost can't do them all in a day, you know.

A.123:  God, that sounds like a blast.

B.124:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's a, uh, all day event.

A.125:  Well that sounds like that might be a fu-, fun place to visit then.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  We'll have to give that a shot.  Well, I tell you what, I guess, uh, I
need to head out, but I, I appreciate, the, the conversation.

B.128:  Yeah, well.

A.129:  You have a goo-, you have a good week.

B.130:  Hit one of my topics, huh [laughter],
