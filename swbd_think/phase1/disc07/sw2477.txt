A.1:  Okay, so which, uh, what basketball teams are you interested in?

B.2:  Well, I guess I'm a big Laker, L A  Laker fan,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  when it comes to pros.  Uh, the college ranks, um, I guess I really, of
course I try to follow my alma mater, that's, uh, B Y U,

A.5:  Uh-huh

B.6:  in Utah.  But they don't have much of a team usually.

A.7:  No, they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.

B.8:  Yeah, yeah.  You see them in football on T V once in awhile.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  You never see them on a, on nationally basketball.

A.11:  You know, that's true.  I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on
basketball.

B.12:  They, uh, last year they had a really good team, (( )) the year that Danny
Aines was there.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  That was about five, six years ago by now.

A.15:  Huh.

B.16:  So, they made it to the [noise] sweet sixteen,

A.17:  Um.

B.18:  once or twice,

A.19:  That's not too bad.

B.20:  in their history, and that's, and they usually lose in the first round.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  (( )) [laughter].

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  How about you?

A.25:  Well, I'm, uh, originally from the Saint Louis area, so the only basketball
team, pro anyway, in that part of the country is Chicago.  So, I, I do pull
for Chicago.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a, a Chicago B-, fan, I
guess, because they're doing pretty good.

B.28:  Is it the Bulls you're talking about? 

A.29:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.30:  Yeah, the pro,

A.31:  Um, as far as college teams, uh, I know it's really easy to say, but I've
been pulling for, uh, Duke for about four years now so, uh,

B.32:  Is that right?

A.33:  so, I finally am feeling better about [laughter] myself as far as
college teams.  Although, I've, I've really, you know, again being from Saint
Louis, I pull for Missouri.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Uh, but they're on, uh, probation this year so you can't do much about
that.

B.36:  #No, no.#

A.37:  #But, uh,#

B.38:  So, did you watch the, uh, final four this year?

A.39:  Oh, yeah.  I watched every, uh, 

B.40:  Every game?

A.41:  I watched all three games of that.  And, uh, I was very pleased with all
three games, because Kansas, uh, you know, I was pulling for Kansas on the
other side, so it was real nice to have the, the teams that were there.

B.42:  Right, #right.#

A.43:  #Of course,# I wasn't really, I mean, I, I, U N L V kind of gave me the
impression of being a, uh, uh, oh, I don't know, a macho team, you know, they
just didn't seem, they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
and, and maybe they were, but, um, I was real happy to see them get knocked
off.  So,

B.44:  Yeah. I, I watched that game.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  and, uh, it was a good game.

A.47:  Oh, yeah.

B.48:  It was a very close game, and hard fought game.  And it just, I don't know,
it looked like U N L V may have had more, uh, talent,

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  but, as far as playing together as a team that day, it didn't, Duke seemed
to have them off balance.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And that, uh, they didn't, couldn't, aren't they more of a running gun team
(( ))?

A.53:  U N L V, yeah, they, they play the pro style, is,

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  what I've always called it.  And, uh, 

B.56:  Yeah, fast breaks #and things and,#

A.57:  #yeah,# the fast breaks and, and,

B.58:  They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed and,

A.59:  Right.  And, uh, U N L V wasn't used to that.  Of course, I've, I knew
whenever U N L V went in at half time, (( )) see I don't know if they were
necessarily behind, but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  Uh, and, you know, that meant that they had to play a second half and they,
they've not had to do that all #year and, uh,#

B.62:  #[Noise] Right, right.# They didn't have, they didn't have to go through
some tough games during the year and that, and that, so that's a terrible time
to have to deal with that, right in, when it, when it counts so much.

A.63:  That's right.  I mean Duke's schedule was, was so much harder than
U N L V's that it, uh, it just made them a much tougher team #overall,#

B.64:  #Right.#

A.65:  and, uh, that had to help them a lot.

B.66:  I think, I think that, that probably was the difference in that game.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  Because it really could have gone an-, either way.  Down to the end, you
know.

A.69:  So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, uh,

B.70:  #Well,#

A.71:  #will# win or,

B.72:  [Noise] {pause} I don't know.  #Probably not.#

A.73:  #I mean, Portland's pretty# good.  Um,

B.74:  Since Kareem's retired,

A.75:  #Yeah.#

B.76:  #they# haven't had a center.  And, uh, they've got Perkins,

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  but I don't think he's really been a super star for them.

A.79:  No. Well, he's, uh, I don't, I, he, he to me is not a center, he's more of
a,

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  a real tall forward [laughter].

B.82:  Right, right.  

A.83:  Uh,

B.84:  So,  

A.85:  #I think Magic does a,#

B.86:  #They'll make it,# you know, i-, i-, it, it's going to be a war between,
uh, between Chicago and, uh, and, uh, uh, Boston Celtics.

A.87:  Oh, yeah.

B.88:  That's going to be a war.

A.89:  That sure is.  #It,#

B.90:  #It's# going to be a great series.

A.91:  I think that's going to be one of those that's, uh, that's won by the home
team, you know,

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think.

B.94:  One of those two will probably be, um, in there, um, let me see, where does
Detroit fit in?

A.95:  Detroit's in that same, uh, that, that same, uh, division.

B.96:  Uh-huh.  So, I don't know, those three, uh, Detroit hasn't been having that
great a year this year.

A.97:  No, but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  So, uh, that might help them.

B.100:  Yeah.  They have the, they have the play-off experience, but,

A.101:  Oh, yeah.

B.102:  so does Detroit, I mean, so does Chicago.  So do-, all three of them do,

A.103:  Oh, yeah.

B.104:  with Larry Bird back, uh, you can never count the Celtics out #when Larry
Bird's,#

A.105:  #That's true.#

B.106:  starting to click on all cylinders.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  They say he's starting to do, starting to #play,#

A.109:  #He's, yeah# but he's been, yeah, but he's been kind of up and down all
year.

B.110:  Right.

A.111:  uh, one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
and then the next time he'll,

B.112:  Right.

A.113:  you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn.  So, I don't know,

B.114:  Right.

A.115:  I'm, I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year.

B.116:  Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  Well #that's when,#

B.118:  #He's,#

A.119:  #you do it.#

B.120:  #starting to be# more consistent, you know, right at the right time of the
year.

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  Oh, any dark horses I, uh, you know,

A.123:  Well, #the dark horses,#

B.124:  #San Antonio,#

A.125:  Yeah that's, 

B.126:  San Antonio is the dark horse that could, could really flip in there, #I
think.#

A.127:  #Yeah.#  Well, anybody who has David Robinson,

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  has got to have a chance anyway.

B.130:  He's got to be pretty much, you know, I use to say ((Akimo Lija)) was the
dominant player, you know, when he,

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  against any team he would dominate, but Robinson's getting up there
((where)),

A.133:  That's right.

B.134:  every game, he's just, I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk and
they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, you know,

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's, when he's
driving hard to the hoop.

A.137:  Huh.

B.138:  He's, uh, he's, too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him.

A.139:  [Laughter] That's true.

B.140:  With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble.

A.141:  Yeah.  Well then, he's gone now so,

B.142:  #Yeah, for awhile anyway.#

A.143:  #they don't have to worry about that.#  Well, I thought he was gone period.
I, I didn't read the story, but I, I, read that, uh,

B.144:  I heard he was suspended.

A.145:  Well, that might have been what it was,

B.146:  #Because of his,#

A.147:  #but I, I guess the# headlines said something about him, you know, that the
Mavericks released him or something, I, maybe I misunderstood what they meant.

B.148:  Um.  If they did, they'd still have to pay his contract [laughter].

A.149:  Well, yeah --

B.150:  They may have done it.

A.151:  -- you never know.

B.152:  It was a lot of money.  He was making like, 

A.153:  Yeah but,

B.154:  I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month.
That's what he was being paid, you know, he wasn't even playing.

A.155:  Yeah.

B.156:  Oh, boy, what a good job he had [laughter].

A.157:  [Laughter]  #That's what I think.#

B.158:  #He ruined# his sweet position [laughter].

A.159:  Yeah [laughter].

B.160:  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to the, the pro play-off, uh,

A.161:  Yeah.  It's coming up, isn't it.

B.162:  L A, yeah, San Antonio, who's the other one that's doing so well this year,
Port-, is that #Portland?#

A.163:  #Portland.  Yeah, Portland.#

B.164:  Portland.  I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all, but all I can
do is hear about, boy they have the seeing eye.  

A.165:  Uh-huh.

B.166:  What do they have Walter Davis and,

A.167:  They've got two, the two Johnson brothers or they're not brothers, but I
mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or
doing good or something, I forget how that works.  But,

B.168:  Um.

A.169:  um, like I said they're doing extremely good right now.  Phoenix isn't
doing too bad.  So,

B.170:  Right.  Right.

A.171:  It, it ought to be a real interesting play-off.

B.172:  Yeah. Yeah.

A.173:  Yeah.

B.174:  I don't think there's any clear pick, you know.

A.175:  Uh-huh.

B.176:  I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of
Bird, and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson.

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  They are two guys that seem to find a way when they,

A.179:  When it's on the line.

B.180:  When it's on the line, they seem to find a way.

A.181:  Uh-huh.

B.182:  You know, uh, so, those are what makes a champion I guess.

A.183:  Yeah, that's true.

B.184:  Yeah.

A.185:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.

B.186:  Nice talking to you.

A.187:  All right.  #Take care.#

B.188:  #Take care.  Bye.#
