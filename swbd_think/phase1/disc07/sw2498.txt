REMARKS:        This tape skipped a lot and made it very difficult to  
understand at times.    

=============================================================================

A.1:  You can go ahead and start if you want, uh,

B.2:  Well, um, the budget's an interesting issue, uh, particularly since I'm
pretty much a libertarian and an ((anachro)) libertarian at that.  Uh, so, I
would basically say the way to fix the budget is to, uh, cut and eliminate
taxes.  Charge user fees for things that, uh, are absolutely necessary and to
be allocated fairly that way.  And, um, I'd say ninety percent of the budget
has no business being there.

A.3:  [Lipsmack] I can agree with that and, uh, I know one thing we, we need to
do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's
really hurting everybody's goat.

B.4:  Uh-huh,    

A.5:  Uh,

B.6:  Yeah I think a lot of people fail to realize but, you know, the
government doesn't generate money.  You know, they may print it, but that's
not really the way money is made, it's made from people working and doing
things that are productive and government's the net cost.

A.7:  and government doesn't produce anything.   

B.8:  That's right.  So, uh, a dollar tax isn't, isn't a dollar that can be, you
know, that, that makes more bread or anything else it's, uh, it's lost.

A.9:  Correct.  That, uh, I guess the, uh, the big thing about that is the fact
that they're spending someone else's money,

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  it's not like it's they're, out of their own savings account.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  And that's another quagmire that really hurts us.

B.14:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I mean it's, it's real easy,   

A.15:  ((Yeah)).  

B.16:  when you go home and, and you think, gee, you know, I'd like to have a
mansion and a yacht.  Isn't it nice I can make my neighbors pay for it
[laughter].

A.17:  Uh-huh [laughter].   

B.18:  But, but, uh, you know, I mean the real world doesn't work like that.  Or
at least it shouldn't but it seems to in government.

A.19:  I think the basic needs of ((the)) government in the first place is to
protect and, what is the other one, basic service is to protect.  And I don't
know about providing all the other services but they do, I mean, even, I, I
guess the, uh, the latest fire they came under was whenever they were
providing a, uh, a tribute to, um, Lawrence Welk.

B.20:  Hum.  Oh,

A.21:  Contributing,   

B.22:  that's right,  

A.23:  five hundred thousand,   

B.24:  that's right.  

A.25:  to restoration to his home.  I think that was called back because of all
the flack they received.  But, but, still another one of the big examples of
why we're in such dilemma.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  Well even just the general funding for the arts, uh, in humanities
and then, you know, they get into these censorship issues and everything else,
I mean,

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  The art's in humanity should be privately funded.   

A.29:  I agree.   

B.30:  Um, a lot of these social welfare programs, I mean, that's why they're
things like United Way is when you and I think that those are important but we
give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility,

A.31:  Uh-huh.   

B.32:  but the government, I think is supposed to be doing is, is defending our
rights.

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  No more and no less.

A.35:  [Lipsmack] And the power given to the I R S Is just astronomical.  And,

B.36:  Oh, yeah that's awful.  

A.37:  when you sign your ten hundred forty form you're signing a away you're
rights, I mean your, your rights to, uh, uh, protect yourself.

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  And that shouldn't be that way either.  Uh, the power given to those people
is just well beyond it should be.

B.40:  Uh-huh.   

A.41:  And, uh, ((the)) really what given it was given to them by Congress.

B.42:  Yeah.  But, Congress [cough] never really had the right to give it to them,
is the, is the real argument.

A.43:  Right.   

B.44:  Um, yeah, it's, it's, so, I don't know, I mean so, it, [cough] I mean
getting back to the budget, it's, I guess the fundamental thing is to, give
people a concrete, get people to agree [cough] on a concrete idea of just
exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them.  No more, no less,
and cut government back down to that size.

A.45:  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's an enormous bureaucracy though, it's going to take
probably years to really get that in to order too.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  [Cough] Because everybody will want that pet project.   

B.48:  Oh, sure.  And, and there's going to be a lot of, you know, cover your ass,
and [cough] you know, well you can cut his program but not mine and, and
entrenched bureaucrats that don't want to loose their jobs.

A.49:  Correct.  And all the, uh, unnecessary military installations,

B.50:  Yep, yep.   

A.51:  will have to be probably scrapped.   

B.52:  Uh-huh.    

A.53:  But that's going to be difficult.   

B.54:  Uh-huh.   

A.55:  But, really the biggest (( )).   

B.56:  We may, we may need a constitutional convention.     

A.57:  Yeah.  Uh, probably well, it's, the only way it's going to change is for us
to have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get
involved and right now I don't see that happening.

B.58:  Yeap.  

A.59:  Not at the moment.  

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  Or not at this short time period [laughter].  

B.62:  Right.  I agree.  

A.63:  So, my, you have some pretty good ideas there.  Um,

B.64:  Well, it's been nice talking to somebody with, who, uh, [laughter]
basically agrees with me.

A.65:  Yeah.  Well, I'm, um, I voted libertarian this last election,   

B.66:  Did you?  

A.67:  ((I mean)) in most, uh, some of the boxes, you know?

B.68:  Uh-huh.    

A.69:  And ((I'm)) really am interested in getting most of the incumbents out.

B.70:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I think the republic rats have, uh, driven this country
downhill for too long.

A.71:  Yeah.  Well, all parties too, are responsible, it's not just one particular
one.

B.72:  Right, that's why I said republic rat [laughter].  

A.73:  Oh, I see, I see [laughter].    

B.74:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.75:  Well, now that we have aired our views in such an open way.  

B.76:  Yeah.   

A.77:  [Laughter].  

B.78:  Well, it was good talking to you.  

A.79:  You two have fun up there.  

B.80:  You too.  

A.81:  Hope to talk to you again, maybe.  

B.82:  Okeydoke.  Bye-bye.
