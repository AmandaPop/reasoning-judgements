============================================================

B.1:  Well.

A.2:  Yes. {music in background and voices through to the end}  

B.3:  Let me see, uh, interesting subject, I was, I was a law student for a year
and a half so I've got, uh, slight bit of expertise in that area.  Not much.
I ... 

A.4:  Well explain this to me.  

B.5:  Okay.

A.6:  Why do we have sometimes, a petit jury, isn't it,

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  and a grand jury? [breathing]

B.9:  Uh, okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the
state.  Um, you don't have to have a jury of twelve and that's true in just
about all states.  Um, it just depends on which ever state statue governs on
the, uh, selection of juries.  Now the, the term petit usually a-, applies to
grand juries.  You have a, uh, a grand jury and a petit grand jury.  Um,
sometimes in some states they also call a, uh, less than twelve member jury a
petit jury.  Uh, did that sufficiently confuse you?

A.10:  All right, now when do we have them.  Just in cri-, big criminal cases?

B.11:  Um, uh, we-, when do you have what a jury?

A.12:  When you have both, like, I was called for a murder trial a few weeks ago,

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  and they had, had already had one trial and determined that there was
enough evidence to go on and have the second one.

B.15:  Okay.

A.16:  So is it just murder or what?  {pause} Where you have both.

B.17:  Uh, okay, I st-, I still don't get it.  Both what?

A.18:  Both juries.  

B.19:  Uh, b-, at the same time?

A.20:  No, they didn't ha-, they had had one,

B.21:  Oh okay, yeah.

A.22:  and decided that there was enough evidence and then ...  

B.23:  Okay, all ri-, well, well what they do is on a criminal inditement first
they go to the grand jury.  Okay, the grand jury will either indite or not.
Once a person is indited then they generally have an evidentiary hearing, um,
and it's, st-, strange that there would have been a jury there because
evidentiary hearings are u-, are just before the judge.  Now it's possible
they had another trial in which, now, I, I, I don't know enough about it to,
to really, to really say,

A.24:  ((Say))

B.25:  uh, uh, how long did the other trial go, do you know?

A.26:  Huh-uh, I don't know.   And like you said maybe it was just with
the judge, I don't know.  [breathing]

B.27:  Y-, yeah, uh, the thing is in alm-, almost every case when there's a
question about, uh, the evidence against the, the person there's, there's
what's called an evidentiary hearing and, the, both sides get up there and the
judge decides whether or not the evidence is good.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  And if the evidence is good, then they go ahead and go to trial.  So you
were proba-, probably being tapped for the jury for the trial.

A.30:  Yeah, well I'll tell you something I think ought to be changed.

B.31:  What's that.

A.32:  Well they sent out eight hundred summons,

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  and about four hundred people showed up, right.

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  All the others had gotten out of it.

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  Then the judge went on for several hours explaining to us how the law
goes,

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  and some of the particulars of the case and then, all these people got
to stand up if they wanted to get out of it.  Well that was about half of us
right,

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  stood up and tried to get out.  Well, I mean that took like an hour and
a half at least,

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  for him to listen to everybody.  

B.45:  [laughter]

A.46:  And then he, he didn't let hardly let anybody off, you know.  [laughter] 

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  It was just like we wasted ((a prayer )), I didn't go up there because I
knew I didn't have a leg to stand on, (( )) [cough].

B.49:  Yeah, well it's, it's hard to get out of jury duty, I mean, it's, uh, it's
an obligation on, on each citizen and short of, uh, any of the special
circumstances then they generally won't let you out.

A.50:  Yeah, I've been getting out of it the last few years because I was going
to school,

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  you know, you can plead that, and I had small children.  But then I found
out that you're not supposed to plead that unless you're the care taker, 

B.53:  Right.

A.54:  you know, and I'm not, because I have to go to work and then they were
going to daycare, so I shouldn't have been doing that. [cough]

B.55:  Uh, yeah.

A.56:  But anyway.

B.57:  Well as long as they didn't question you too closely.  I mean the thing
is, uh, the easiest way to get out of one of these things is, uh, uh, they'll
ask you questions like do you know the defendant, have you heard anything
about the  case, do you have any, uh, specially if it's a murder case
they may be asking for, uh, for a capital, uh,

A.58:  Punishment.

B.59:  a capital's, capital punishment.

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  Uh, you can always say you can object to that and they'll let you off
there.

A.62:  Well, I cert-, I believed in it in some, you know, cases, but I
would feel that it would be very hard for me to impose it on somebody.

B.63:  Yeah, uh, tha-. 

A.64:  I think ... 

B.65:  yeah, that's, that won't get you off.

A.66:  Well.

B.67:  [laughter]

A.68:  Okay.

B.69:  Th-, you, you have to be, you have to be dead set against it, 

A.70:  Oh.  [breathing]

B.71:  the fact that your willing, the fact that you believe in it doesn't, uh,
doesn't matter.  Of course they're going to ask you, ca-, do you think you
could impose it in this case.

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  And, you know, I that, that, to me that's always been a stupid question, I,
I mean, I don't know, I haven't heard the evidence yet. [laughter]

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  I mean if, if, if he did something really, really gross, then yeah.

A.76:   Well this guy that was sitting in, in front of me said that he was a
private investigator and he had been tailing the woman that was murdered and
as far as he was concerned that this guy was guiltier than hell.  Now listen
to what he supposedly did.  He supposedly stuffed paper toweling up this
women's nostrils and down her throat and strangled her.  

B.77:  Ugh.

A.78:  Now how this happened was, this rich little socialite in Plano, down here
in Texas, decided that she was going to bump off her husband's girlfriend,
because he didn't want to divorce her.  

B.79:  Oh, God {softly}.

A.80:  And she wanted to get a stab at more money, right, by knocking him off.

B.81:  Yeah, right.

A.82:  So, she hired four guys to do it and this guy actually did it.

B.83:  Oh, God.

A.84:  Now, she, uh, in the mean time took off with one of her lawyers who was
also under inditement [laughter] for attempting drugs,

B.85:  #They ought to make this into a T V show#

A.86:  #among them#, yeah, among them cocaine, right, so they split.  Anyway
they got the lawyer and he's now going to side with the cate, with the state,
so that he'll get a lesser sentence.

B.87:  Yeah, he's going to turn states evidence.  

A.88:  Yeah.

B.89:  God.

A.90:  Pretty interesting, huh. 

B.91:  Yeah, that, that would have been fun to sit in on.

A.92:  [laughter]  Well now they're going to call people up, after they, gone
through this five page thing that we had to fill out,

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  [throat_clearing] and decide to call in people two to three at a time.

B.95:  Uh-huh.

A.96:  They're going to do this, let's see, all through April and May and the
trials not supposed to start until June.  Well that's the beginning of my
vacation.  [laughter]

B.97:  Um, tha-,.

A.98:  I don't want to be picked.

B.99:  Nothing like taking your vacat-, what you ought to do is reschedule your
vacation real quick.  

A.100:  I can't, I'm a teacher.  [laughter]

B.101:  Oh.

A.102:  It's then or never.

B.103:  Yeah, um, gosh.

A.104:  Anyway,

B.105:  What a way to spend your, your vacation.

A.106:  I'm not going to be summoned, I mean out of four hundred, I'm not going
to be one of the twelve.  Especially see, I put that down that that guy had
told me that.

B.107:  Yeah, that, that's ... 

A.108:  But then I've heard that won't make a difference either.  

B.109:  Well it may because it, it's something that could have influenced your,
your, your, uh, uh, your, uh, your bias.

A.110:  Yeah.

B.111:  So, the-, there's a good chance if they, if they ask you about it, you
know, I wo-, I wouldn't just come out and say, I think the guys guilty but I,
I would say that I've heard enough about this that I, I, really have a
preconceived notion of, of what the guy did.

A.112:  Uh-huh.

B.113:  And I think that, you know, in, in other words if you, if you can just
show that you're not going to be, that you can't be, uh, unbiased that's going
to be enough.

A.114:  Well, what do you think, can we change the system?

B.115:  Well, there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly, I don't
think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work as
well.  I mean, I, I realize it's cumbersome and, uh, uh, it's time consuming
and at times even ridiculous, but it, th-, nobody's come up with any better
solution.  {pause}

A.116:  But something ought to be done because, if you have money, you get a good
lawyer and you get off. 

B.117:  Well, that, that is, that's a, that's one of those things I think's
sor-, sort of a preconceived notion on the part of the public.  They, you can
have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers, but, y-, you
know if you've got, if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the
evidence, I mean, you see, that's what it all comes down to, it's the jury.

A.118:  [breathing]

B.119:  Uh, if they are, I mean, there's no doubt that y-, you can pick a jury.
Oka-, in some, in some respects you can get the kind of jury you want.  But,
short of that, I mean, if people are reasonable and they'll look at the
evidence, and decide on that basis then, then, you know, supposedly money
doesn't count.  But on the other hand, what can you do about it?  I me-, what,
what solution is there?

A.120:  But if you've got a good lawyer, he's going to be able to get more,
persuasive evidence than a poor lawyer would to present.

B.121:  Uh.

A.122:  And a lawyer that's, you know, chosen by the state, that really doesn't
even want to do it.

B.123:  Oh, you mean a court appointed lawyer?

A.124:  Uh-huh.

B.125:  Yeah, there's, there's little doubt that, I mean, obviously a court
appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do as much, but on
the other hand, I mean, again what, what can be done about it, you know.
It's, it's one of those, I, I think unsolvable sort of things, I mean we make
the motions of
