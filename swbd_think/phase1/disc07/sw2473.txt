A.1:   So, uh, Deanna, where do you like to fish? 

B.2:   [TV] Well, we usually go fishing at Toledo Bend, 

A.3:   Uh-huh. 

B.4:   and, um, my parents, they are the fishermen, 

A.5:   Um. 

B.6:   and my brother. Uh, I, I usually don't do too much fishing, I usually take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan. 

A.7:   Oh, great! Great. 

B.8:   But they love to crappie fish, 

A.9:   Uh-huh. 

B.10:   my brother likes to bass fish, so, um, 

A.11:   What do you, what do you use for bait for crappie and bass? 

B.12:   For crappie they use shiners, 

A.13:   Uh-huh. 

B.14:   and, uh, bass, my brother usually puts a jig or something like that on there for it or a top water bait, you know, usually artificial bait for bass. 

A.15:   Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.16:   and then, uh, we sometimes get crickets and they, they fish for brim #and,# 

A.17:   #I've# never used crickets before. Do you use them live? 

B.18:   Yeah. #You haven't?# 

A.19:   #Where you pu-,# put the hooks through their little back and they jump around under the water? 

B.20:   Uh-huh. 

A.21:   And, and, and, and, what are crickets good for? 

B.22:   Brim. 

A.23:   Brim? Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.24:   Uh-huh. And, um, also they have these, uh, wasps, the, the, uh, larvae, 

A.25:   Uh-huh. 

B.26:   is that what it's called, wasp, wasp larvae? 

A.27:   Yeah, oh, yeah. 

B.28:   And, uh, [sniffing] oh, anytime we can find those my parents just scoop upon those because they are so good for fishing, 

A.29:   Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.30:   and, um, they use those a lot, but usually its either shiners or, 

A.31:   [Clicking] {Call waiting}. Oh, just a minute, I've got to see who that is. 

B.32:   Okay. 

A.33:   {Pause} [Clicking] So, anyway, uh, uh, do you ever tip fish for catfish? 

B.34:   No, we usually don't do, I mean, they catch catfish, I keep saying they, because I've never fished. But, um, they catch catfish, you, on accident sometimes, 

A.35:   Oh, okay. 

B.36:   and, then whenever we do trout lines and stuff they usually get catfish. 

A.37:   Are they, are they big ones? 

B.38:   Um, usually not too big. Probably maybe two or three pounds, you know. 

A.39:   Uh-huh. 

B.40:   I've seen some huge catfish. 

A.41:   Yeah, yeah. I think you have to go deep for those, don't you though? Don't they kind of, just kind of, 

B.42:   [Sniffing]. 

A.43:   scavenge along the bottom #of,# 

B.44:   #The# #bottom, yeah.# 

A.45:   #of wherever# they are? 

B.46:   Uh-huh. 

A.47:   Yeah. What, what kind of a boat do you all have? 

B.48:   Well, we used to just have a little aluminum boat, 

A.49:   Uh-huh. 

B.50:   but, uh, my Dad has sold it so he's hunting a boat now. I think he's looking into ((bass tracker)). 

A.51:   Uh-huh. 

B.52:   He found him one last weekend that he really liked, but we haven't gotten it yet so, 

A.53:   Oh, yeah. Yeah. 

B.54:   [Clicking] Well, 

A.55:   we don't have a boat, we usually fish off the shore or off the dock, and my, I've got a son that's a senior in high school and he just loves, he loves fishing. I, I don't have the patience that he does. 

B.56:   #Oh, I agree.# 

A.57:   #Uh, you know,# it's, it's sitting there on the dock and you go an hour, 

B.58:   [Laughter]. 

A.59:   [Laughter] and nothings happening. 

B.60:   That's right [laughter]. 

A.61:   He says, no Dad, I know they're down there, let's not go, I know they're down there, 

B.62:   [Laughter] And they're, they're going to bite anytime, and, uh, 

A.63:   We're talking about fishing Daddy {talking to someone in the background}. 

B.64:   Uh, he got into a place where, uh, we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling, 

A.65:   [Noise] Oh!! 

B.66:   and, my goodness, he was throwing. This was one day last summer and he, every, as often as he could throw that hook out there, he'd get one. But we don't deplete the fish population because we pull them up and look at them, admire them and take them off and throw them back. 

A.67:   [/Noise]. 

B.68:   Although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish and got them. And I think it's the first time that he's ever, that he's actually prepared and ate what they caught. 

A.69:   #Oh!# 

B.70:   #He# and some friends of his. The first time they've ever done anything but throw them back. 

A.71:   [Noise]. 

B.72:   But, uh, we, you know, we started with just rudimentary things like worms [laughter], and night crawlers, and, uh, and, uh, uh, gone to, uh, minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows. Uh, and we ta-, we fish at Lake Texoma, 

A.73:   #Oh!# 

B.74:   #a-, and# then, and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the, uh, 

A.75:   [Sniffing]. 

B.76:   and, and get the, and get minnows. And, uh, it's, it's pretty lot of fun except I say you've got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesn't seem like anything is down there at all. 

A.77:   Yeah. 

B.78:   And then oth-, other days, uh, uh, you, you can pull them in with some degree of regularity. It seems as the summer comes, when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind, they seem to be a, far more prevalent. 

A.79:   [Noise] Well, I just do not have the patience for it. 

B.80:   #No.# 

A.81:   #But,# I mean, we usually, um, keep our fish that are the right size, 

B.82:   Yeah. 

A.83:   you know, that are right size, you know, that are a good eating size, because my parents love to eat fish. 

B.84:   Oh, sure. 

A.85:   But, uh, the little ones we throw back, 

B.86:   Yeah. 

A.87:   or my Dad will bring them home and put them in my fish tank [laughter]. 

B.88:   Throw, throw them back and let them get bigger so you can come get them next year. 

A.89:   Yeah, and catch them next time. Yeah. 

B.90:   But, you know, at, at Texoma, it's such a big lake, and we don't have a boat, but we're on the dock and people come in, there's a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of Texoma, 

A.91:   Uh-huh. 

B.92:   and they go out and fish around there, and people come in with these ice chests, 

A.93:   [Sniffing] Full, 

B.94:   just full of, of, you know, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen inch long fish. 

A.95:   Oh, #great.# 

B.96:   #It's the# darndest thing I've ever seen and I don't know, we, we're probably going to have to get us a boat one of these days soon and go out and see, go out and see what's really out there. 

A.97:   They are so expensive. 

B.98:   Oh, yeah, I know they are. I used to have one, 

A.99:   [Sniffing]. 

B.100:   that we used to ski, ski behind, 

A.101:   Oh, #I love to ski.# 

B.102:   #and, and, before# our, our children came along -- 

A.103:   Yeah. 

B.104:   -- my wife and I used to ski all the time. Then when the, and we kept it on, it was an eighteen footer, it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake, 

A.105:   [Noise] Uh-huh. 

B.106:   tied up. [Noise] {He may be eating}. And then when your children are very little, you can't go out and do things like that, 

A.107:   Yeah. 

B.108:   and, it got so the insurance and the, and the, uh, and the tie up fee, uh, was gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it. So I went and sold it and never bought again, and it's too bad now that the kids are teenagers they want, they'd love to get out there and learn to ski, 

A.109:   Oh, yeah. 

B.110:   and do the boating and fishing again, so we'll probably do something like that. Do you, do you camp at the lake a lot? 

A.111:   Yeah. We, uh, we usually do, pro-, usually in the springtime or in the fall (( )). 

B.112:   Yeah, not in the summer? 

A.113:   No, the summer time is a little too hot. 

B.114:   Oh, okay. 

A.115:   Um, we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or, um, for the week. Matter of fact I think we're going to go again in, in May, 

B.116:   Uh-huh. 

A.117:   the middle of May we're, uh, planning a trip down to Toledo Bend. 

B.118:   Oh, uh-huh. 

A.119:   And, sometimes we rent a trailer, 

B.120:   Uh-huh, where, 

A.121:   and then, 

B.122:   Where is Toledo Bend? 

A.123:   Um, it's between the Texas and Louisiana border. 

B.124:   Oh, okay, it's, it's on that side, it's on the, the east side. What's, what's the nearest big city? 

A.125:   Um, {talking to someone in the room} Daddy, what's the nearest big city to Toledo Bend? [Laughter] {Resumes speaking to A} This lake is huge. I mean, 

B.126:   It's huge. Yeah, and I was, I, is it like near Tyler or Texarkana #or Parish?# 

A.127:   #He says its# exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas. 

B.128:   Oh, okay. Exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas. Um. 

A.129:   It's, 

B.130:   How, how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport? 

A.131:   Um, it usually takes us about an hour or an hour and a half for us to get there Daddy? {Talking to someone in room}. {Resumes speaking to A} Yeah, and then my brother will meet us half way since he works, 

B.132:   Oh, yeah, yeah. 

A.133:   he lives in Dallas, he usually meets us half way. 

B.134:   Do you work in Shreveport or go to school or what? 

A.135:   I go to school. I go to L S U . 

B.136:   Oh, what are you majoring in? 

A.137:   Communications. 

B.138:   Oh, my goodness. I have been on the L S U Campus once. I took a recruiting trip for T I there about, uh, uh, eight or nine years ago, 

A.139:   #Oh!# 

B.140:   #And I# was, oh, I was ever so impressed with the campus. In fact it was a two day trip and between appointments I got a chance to walk around and see it. 

A.141:   Uh-huh. 

B.142:   And, uh, what a, what a fabulous darn school it was. I was just really, really impressed with it. 

A.143:   Well, gosh. #Thanks.# [laughter] [breathing] 

B.144:   #and# and I know it's getting off the subject a little bit but I I do you follow a lot of the sports at L S U? 

A.145:   yeah I sure do I try to 

B.146:   #okay.# 

A.147:   I mean um 

B.148:   well we're we're we're very strong uh women's basketball team fans. 

A.149:   #Oh!# 

B.150:   #So# we we follow your basketball team, 

A.151:   Well, great. 

B.152:   your your women's basketball team a lot. #and# 

A.153:   Yeah, I, I also try to follow Tech. Louisiana Tech. #(( ))# 

B.154:   #Yeah,# oh, of course, they are one of the best. 

A.155:   Yeah, they are. 

B.156:   Uh, they didn't do as well this year, but we saw them, we went down to Austin last year and saw them beat the Longhorns in the regionals. 

A.157:   Oh! 

B.158:   And, and, uh, man, they were (( )). I guess they went to the final four last year, 

A.159:   Uh-huh. 

B.160:   and, and didn't make it through. But we were just uh, uh, just really impressed with them. What, what year are you in at L S U? 

A.161:   I am almost a junior [laughter]. 

B.162:   Uh-huh. 

A.163:   After this semester in May I'll be a junior. 

B.164:   And what do you plan on doing when you get out? 

A.165:   Uh, I want to be a cruise director. 

B.166:   Oh gee what a deal on like on Love boat huh 

A.167:   [laughter] Yeah, kind of, I guess. 

B.168:   Hey that's a neat thing. 

A.169:   Um, I'd like to do that for a few years and then whenever I get settled down, I would like to go back and teach college. 

B.170:   Uh-huh. 

A.171:   I'd like to be a #professor#. 

B.172:   Are you you then plan on maybe getting an advanced degree somewhere? 

A.173:   Yeah, I'm going to, uh, go ahead and go straight in and get my Masters Degree. 

B.174:   Oh, at L S U? 

A.175:   No, I'm going to go to, uh, I'm going to check into the University of Colorado. 

B.176:   Oh. 

A.177:   Because they have a, a special program, a one year's Masters Program, where I can get my Masters in one year. 

B.178:   Uh-huh. 

A.179:   So, um, 

B.180:   What would it take about thirty hours or something like that, thirty-two or thirty-six? 

A.181:   I think it's thirty-six, yeah. 

B.182:   Oh, okay, 

A.183:   so 

B.184:   that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe, huh? 

A.185:   Uh-huh. 

B.186:   Yeah. Okay. 

A.187:   It, I mean, it's going to take a lot of hard work but, uh, 

B.188:   Oh sure. Sure. 

A.189:   you need, 

B.190:   Well, I think, I think, uh, the best thing to do is, I've got two Masters Degrees, but they both came years after my Bachelors Degrees, 

A.191:   Uh-huh. 

B.192:   and, if I had it to do all over again, I would do what you're planning to do, like continue. 

A.193:   Uh-huh. 

B.194:   You need to get it while you're still hot [laughter]. 

A.195:   That's what everybody has said. Because once you get out and make that money, it's so hard #to go back to it.# 

B.196:   #It is, it is# very hard to go back and, and, actually the academic part isn't bad when your, when you resume, because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and, I thought the academic part would be harder, but it really isn't. Uh, uh, it because, uh, uh, I don't know, I think the maturity factor, uh, uh, over comes the fact that you've had a gap. 

A.197:   Yeah. 

B.198:   But, nevertheless, it's, it's so much, it's so hard to get back to it. And, it's, it's so much easier while you've got your academic juices flowing. 

A.199:   Well what, what are your degrees in? 

B.200:   I have, uh, my first one's in, my Bachelor's in Chemistry and my Master's in Physics and in, uh, in Management, 

A.201:   #Oh, goodness.# [/T V] 

B.202:   #uh, uh,# quality management. I've been in, I've been in quality management with T I and engineering management and, and, uh,
