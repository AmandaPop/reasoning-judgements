REMARKS:        The tape was basically a good tape to transcribe except for
a few places where it sounded like the tape stalled or delayed. 
The words could usually be made out, but in a couple of places I
was not sure.  There were two overlap sections that were difficult
to decipher. 

============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what's your favorite dish?

B.2:  Oh, for your question, probably {pause} it's, uh, tough to decide between
like some sort of a Chinese dish or something like pizza [breathing].

A.3:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand that.  I like oriental cooking and, uh,
[clicking] pasta [beep] and I have the same problem, uh.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Italian heritage, so I definitely like pasta but I like Italian and the two
don't mix though [breathing].

B.6:  No.

A.7:  I've tried that.  It doesn't,

B.8:  No.  Although you can make a sort of a Chinese pizza.

A.9:  [Laughter]

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  Yeah.  That doesn't work very well either [breathing].  Uh, I don't know,
sort of dumb, what kind of food would you have in a dinner party?  Well, it
depends on what kind of people you got coming over.

B.12:  Sure.

A.13:  So we'll leave it at that.  Uh, let me see [breathing].  What do you, w-,
you like to cook, uh, just everything or do you have specialties?

B.14:  I'm, I pretty much specialize, I guess, in Italian and Chinese.

A.15:  Yeah [beep].

B.16:  Um, I'm a vegetarian, as, uh, Chinese gives me a lot of --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- room to play with.  I've been, I've been doing some stuff with, um,
Middle Eastern lately, you know, cooking ((of)),

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  dals and stuff.

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  Which has been fun. 

A.23:  [Smack] Yeah.  I, uh, [breathing] I, I've been collecting recipes and
modifying recipes for a long, long time.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And, uh, [smack] I run a little direct mail business on the side.  And I
finally put together a cookbook.

B.26:  Wow.

A.27:  And, uh, I've got to, [smack] I got to reformat it.  I, I did it on my word
processor and now I've got to redo the whole thing again and I'm trying to
figure out a cheap way to, a quick way to do it without having to retype it.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  Because, uh, it's, it's all size, about, it's not, it's not very big.  I
mean it's like a hundred and five pages, something like that.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  But it's got lots of good recipes, so I was thinking about trying to sell
that on the side [clicking] --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- just [beep] for fun.

B.34:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I usually, um, you know, I'd get using that, so I usually
just, uh, look at the recipe groups in there, uh, for interesting things.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Well, see, what else can we talk about food?

B.36:  What sort of cookbooks do you, um, do you usually use?

A.37:  Well, usual-, hardly any at all any more.

B.38:  Yep.

A.39:  Um, I've, I've gotten together sort of like basic recipes.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And once you have those you can add to them or take away from them,

B.42:  #That's true.#  

A.43:  #and come up# with all kinds of different dishes.  I, I have several
cookbooks, uh, BETTY CROCKER and NEW YORK TIMES and,

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  a couple of Japanese cookbooks, a couple of Chinese cookbooks.  I even
got a Filipino cookbook.

B.46:  Huh.

A.47:  Um, they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish.  I forgot the name
of it but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at
Filipino stores.

B.48:  Well, that's interesting.

A.49:  Yeah.  And it's a, it's a strange sort of, it's sort of like a pepperoni.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  But it's, it has a much sharper flavor and it's, uh, it's almost like it
has red die in it or something.  When you cook it, it bleeds and it colors the
food.

B.52:  Huh.

A.53:  It's pretty interesting.  But it's a real good chicken dish.  It's sort of
like a chicken potpie in a way.  You have,

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  a crust on top and all that.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  [Breathing] Delicious though.  I love it.

B.58:  Do you, {pause} yeah.  I pretty much, I, I guess I stick pretty much, I've
got a couple of Moosewood books.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Um, the greens I find to be very handy.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Um, {pause}.  Other than that, I mean, I, you know, I've got five or six
others that I can, I can look up for inspiration or,

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  something I don't know.  

A.65:  An idea, 

B.66:  But, uh, 

A.67:  yeah.  

B.68:  yeah.

A.69:  That's the,

B.70:  But,

A.71:  way I am.  I generally get there and --

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  -- I have, have an idea of what I want to do but I don't really know how to
get started, so I, I look,

B.74:  Right.  

A.75:  ((up)) something, get, get me, oh, yeah, well, I'll add this to it and do
this and --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- turns out pretty good sometimes.

B.78:  Yeah.  I find it's usually pretty useful to,

A.79:  [Throat_clearing].  

B.80:  cook, you know, some number of recipes out of a book to get a flavor of
the style.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  And then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you, once you
understand the spicing,

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  patterns and,

A.85:  Well, I mean, I mean that's, 

B.86:  stuff like that.  

A.87:  yeah.  That's the fun of cooking, improvising.  

B.88:  Right.  Absolutely.

A.89:  If you're going to sit there and just follow a recipe, that's no fun.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  ((You know, w-,)),

B.92:  Oh, I agree.

A.93:  You know, a monkey can do that.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  I bet even my cats could do that.

B.96:  [Breathing].

A.97:  No, not this one.  She's dead to the world right now.  Oh, well
[breathing].  Well, let's see.  I guess that's about it on food.

@@B.98:  Yeah.  Okay.

A.99:  All right.  Good talking to you Brad.

B.100:  Nice talking to you.

A.101:  Take care.

B.102:  #Bye.#

A.103:  #Bye.#
