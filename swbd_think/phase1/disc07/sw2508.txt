REMARKS:        In the first half of the conversation, there is a lot of 
periodic background noise, involving conversation and a barking dog.  The
second half was relatively quiet.  Also, about half way through there 
is a big jump in volume, and it stays constant at that level for the 
rest of the tape.  

============================================================================

A.1:  How do you, uh, manage your budget?

B.2:  Well, let's see, we, or, I sit down at the, uh, in a, on a monthly, or a
biweekly, I get paid every two weeks, so I make out a budget for every two
weeks, and I sit down and see how much money I have to have for my bills going
out, and then I compare that to, uh, how much money we need to make, and then
just set it up that way, and allot this much money for everything, and if we
have any left over, we'll, uh, you know, buy clothes, or have fun, go out to
eat, or something.  [talking] {background voice saying And we should start
saving.} And we're going to try to start saving as soon as we can [talking].
We generally don't have a lot left over.  But as far as the long term, our
long-term goal is to, to get out of debt,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  and, uh, most of our debts are from before we were married, and we're
trying to get rid of, you know, student loans, those kinds of things.

A.5:  Yeah. Well, I, in my younger years, I'd always heard the adage you should,
uh, buy as much of a house as you can afford,

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  uh, because of the, uh, improvement in real estate prices, and on the last
move we bought ourselves a fairly large house, and I've got some pretty stiff
mortgage payments now,

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  and, uh, the, uh, improvement in, uh, income, and, uh, investments and so
forth has not, uh, come at the rate I've expected, so we're still kind of
hurting by the, uh, high mortgage payments, and we haven't gotten out from
under them yet.

B.10:  Yeah [talking]. 

A.11:  But, uh, so far we've managed to hold our own by, uh, uh, trying to set up
a, a monthly budget.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Uh, I try to take out just so much cash for me, and my, uh, give so much
cash to my wife,

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car, and then the
rest of it's, uh, pretty much fixed expenses, uh, mortgage, electricity, uh,
water, and, uh, and garbage collection, and telephone bills and cable
television bills, and those are pretty much fixed.

B.16:  Yeah, yeah that's basically the kinds of bills we have are, on our budget
are, you know the needs, the have to haves, and, you know, those kinds of
things, uh, we don't have a lot of, uh, you know, like J C Penny's in our
[laughter],

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  in our budget [/talking] and, uh, maybe twice a year, we're to where I
can let my wife go clothes shopping like that, and, let's see, my
mother-in-law lives, uh, not too far from here, so she helps with our son's
clothes when she can,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  and, that's real good, and, uh, w-, at T I, I have a real good benefits
package for, uh, uh, you know, like for going to the doctor and that kind of
thing, so, that's not something I really have to put in the budget that
seriously so,

A.21:  Yeah.  No, my wife's pretty good about, uh, grocery shopping and, 

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  she pitches in and, uh, makes clothes for the kids.

B.24:  Really?  Well, that's neat.

A.25:  Uh, which is a big help.  Uh, one of our big problems, though, is handling
unexpected, uh, uh, budget items,

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  like this month, the, uh, heat pump went out, 

B.28:  [Throat_clearing] Um.  Yeah.

A.29:  and, uh, they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace
that.

B.30:  Wow.  So what do you do? [barking].

A.31:  Well, uh, we have to cut into the savings, uh, at this point, to, uh, to
buffer that.

B.32:  Oh, wow.

A.33:  And, 

B.34:  Well, that's good that you have the savings to get into.

A.35:  Then maybe we'll go for a week or two, and, or a month or two, and then the
car breaks down [laughter].

B.36:  [Laughter] Wow.

A.37:  So it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the
budget.

B.38:  Yeah, that's, that's the way we are, we've had a lot of unexpected things,
just in the last, uh, couple months [barking],

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  that, uh, really hit us hard.  But, I've been able to work enough overtime
to, you know, really help with the, with covering the expenses.  So, but,
we've never been, we've been married for, uh, nearly four years, and we've
never been able to save any money, and I think it's just hit both of us, uh,
just in the past few months, that we need to start saving some money, no
matter what we do.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  We need to put that in our budget, and just start doing it.  Even if it's
you know, ten dollars a week.  And, so we're going to start doing that, or
actually we started two paychecks ago, and that was, uh, I think that was a
really wise decision.

A.43:  Well, do you have some, uh, savings plans at work?

B.44:  No, actually, I'm, I'm not involved in anything like that at work, or, uh,
anywhere.  Uh, I don't have anything to fall back on at all.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  And, I, I know that's not wise, but, that's just, uh, where we're at right
now.  My wife just went back to work part-time, uh, she can substitute teach
at schools, and, uh, there's, uh, so many school districts and schools here in
the metroplex that, uh, by turning her name in, if she wanted to, she could
work,

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  you know, everyday, but, we're, we're just going to let her work one, maybe
two days a week, and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes
to, uh, uh, our debts,

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  and try to get as much out of debt as fast we can.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And, there's, and, we're, we're Christians, and that's, uh, we've only been
Christians for about five years, but that's a, a real, a biblical truth, in
the Bible is to, to, not be in debt,

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  and we're really starting to see the, the, the reasoning behind that, and,
uh, because we're, you know, we're always, well, I can't be sick this week but
one day,

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  or, you know, this month, but one day, because, you know, our bills will
catch up with us, if I am, or you know, I c-, we can't go on a two week
vacation because, uh, I wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks, so, that
would really hurt us financially, and, you know, just, things like that all
time.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And, you know, we, we really see how we're, you know, indebted, or, nearly
underneath, uh, the debt that we have,

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  you know, and that's, that's really hard.  But, so far we've never really,
uh, been behind on any bills.  Uh, I had to put our student loans on hold once
for about, I think, three months,

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  and we had a, a cutback at work, and, uh, this it, this was a couple of
years back, but, anyway, but we're doing really good, we're not saving, but
we're staying right even.

A.63:  Yeah.  Well, we've been looking around at, uh, uh, trying to develop some
side activities that, that might help out, such as, uh, creating some craft
objects that we can market in the, uh, local stores,

B.64:  Oh, #yeah.#

A.65:  #or, uh,# uh, making, uh, some dresses for children, or things like that,
or #even writing children's books.#

B.66:  #Yeah, that's neat.#  Oh, that's neat, yeah, wow.

A.67:  And, uh, I tried, uh, this past year, writing, uh, journal articles, but,
uh, I found out it cost me more than the, the honorariums I got for writing
them.

B.68:  Oh, wow.  Because of the time?

A.69:  Uh, well, especially the first one, because I wound up buying a lot of
reprints for handouts,

B.70:  Wow.

A.71:  and I ate up all my profits, with, uh, 

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  buying reprints.

B.74:  Right.  Wow.  Yeah, my, my wife made, uh, a whole lot of crafts last year
for Christmas presents.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  And we didn't, uh, you know, have to allot any, well hardly ver-, very much
money, anyway, for Christmas.  Just for our, uh, personal family, just me and
her and our son, and I think her Mom,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  and that was really, you know, about it.  We, we made everything else
that, uh, we gave for Christmas last year.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  And she did really good with that.

A.81:  Well, we thought we were going to be pretty tight with Christmas this past
year,

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  but, uh, we have a family dog that, uh, ate all of the children's toys,

B.84:  Oh, wow, wow. 

A.85:  so, coming up to Christmas time, [laughter] the girls didn't have any
toys, so we had to go out and,

B.86:  Oh no.

A.87:  and get them a whole new set of playthings.

B.88:  Wow.

A.89:  Now, I don't know how the dog has fared, eating all that plastic,

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  and, uh, and stuffed animal stuffing, but [laughter] he's still here.

B.92:  Wow, wow, that's pretty, pretty bizarre [laughter].  The dog ate the
Christmas presents, that's funny.  Well, anyway, what, uh, is the economy
doing pretty good there where you're at?

A.93:  So far it's, uh, doing fairly well.  I, we're in the metropolitan
Washington area, and, uh, I guess most of the area is still living off the
federal government with, uh, beltway bandit type contracts.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  Uh, our company is, uh, done fairly well, and, uh,

B.96:  Yeah.  What company is it?

A.97:  I'm with the Melpar division of E-Systems.

B.98:  Oh, of E-Systems,

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  Okay.  I see.  What do you all make?

A.101:  Uh, we're primarily in the, uh, uh, systems integrations business,

B.102:  Oh.

A.103:  with selling to the government.
