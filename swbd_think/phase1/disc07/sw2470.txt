============================================================================

A.1:  Personal computers are, are nice I guess if you can afford them.  The, the
problem if you happen to use one at work, is you tend to get spoiled with the,
uh, maybe a higher grade one, maybe the, the economics and the payback of
having one at a business is a little bit better than having one at home, and
I've read a few articles that, uh, where people have nice, uh, three
eighty-six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then
when they come home, they, they just can't stand to come down to the X T level
and, and don't like the, the slowness or the, in some cases, not even having a
hard drive, and that's pretty much where I fall into.  I use a, a relatively
nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes, and I have a variety
of, of, uh, speeds and complexity of machines, depending upon the instrument
that it's controlling, and, then I have one that I do just general purpose
work on, and then for the house, I don't have anything, uh, not that I
wouldn't want one, but I would probably not be satisfied with anything less
than a really nice one, and that's, that's a, quite an expense.  And then all
the software tends to be, uh, commercial grade.  It's all where, I guess, you
know, to get something like WordPerfect you're looking at, uh, five hundred
dollars worth or so.  And some of the accounting packages or the, the nicer
spreadsheets are somewhat expensive, and, I don't know, it's, it's quite a, a
{pause} expense or a luxury for the house, I guess, and there's not a whole
lot I would do, other than some word processing.  I, I got a, a number of
things that I could, could be doing on a P C instead of, here, instead of
doing them at the h-, at work.  They're for the house, but I do them on
occasion at work, and it's nice to, uh, it would be nice to have one, I guess.
What do you think?

B.2:  I share your, your, uh, sense when you change job to work, or job to home,
uh, the way your, your image of the machine changes.  I tend to do slightly
different things at home than I do at work, um, I use One Two Three a lot, the
Lotus product,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  as a spreadsheet, and I have, I use a, uh, what you see is what you get
editor for almost all of my word processing, so I have not, although I have
access at home to things like Works and WordPerfect, uh, but I, I do no-,
obviously notice it.  I, I think the thing that surprises me most when I
change work to home environment is the cursor speed, and after I, if,
initially get over the, uh, the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly
across the screen, uh, as opposed to tabbing.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, I'm a touch typer and I haven't ever really noticed, uh, differences,
uh, the machine tends to react as fast as I can.  I use an eight-, as a matter
of fact use an eighty eighty-eight at, at home, uh, which is really old iron,
uh, probably ten years or so, and, and at the office, uh, I am indeed using a
three eighty-six.  Um, I use a P C for a great deal of things in, in private
life, uh.  I'm a church treasurer,

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  and I use the machine a lot on a, uh, uh, data base and financial package
that, that operates at the church office.  I do some, uh, volunteer work at
home using uh, a, buttons P C file program that, uh, is a very simplistic
relational data base for labels and things.  So I guess I would have to say on
a home setting, I'm probably on the personal computer as much as an hour a day
on average at home.

A.9:  Um.

B.10:  Um,

A.11:  That's good.

B.12:  Ec-, I don't have {pause} a concern too much about the speed, however,
because most of the applications I find are as fast as I am, if not more so,
and I tend to notice it more when it comes down to an issue of peripherals.
Uh, at work I'm used to various batch printing capabilities and uh, pretty
high-speed output, either laser printer, uh,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  or, uh, machines like, uh, I B M thirty-eight twenty high speed uh,
A P A printers.  And so I get frustrated, uh,

A.15:  [Laughter] [throat_clearing].

B.16:  watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer [laughter].

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  More so than I do over, over access speed.  Um, I {pause} guess that I have
gotten to the point where if, if I didn't have the personal computer, I would
be impacted a great deal on the things that I do in my life.  I'm, I'm sure I
would probably find ways to return to what I was doing in nineteen eighty-one
when I,

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  got my first home computer, but i-, it would be, I think, a d-, a
dramatic sense of loss on, on some items.

A.21:  On your editor, do you do, uh, does it do spell correcting or any kind of
thesaurus work?

B.22:  Uh, no.  I have access to, uh, spell correction, uh, material.  I s-, I
seldom use it, although, when I'm at the office and I'm producing work
correspondence, uh, I, I run about ninety per cent of my office work on a
mainframe.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Uh, I, I execute on a three eighty-six machine that is attached to
the mainframe as a s-, as a intelligent work station,

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  but I use it frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe,

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  and, and there I tend, on almost all of my editing and stuff, to,
to be using some fairly powerful editors and word processors and, and
Wordproof, but, surprisingly at home, and, I seldom ever bother, uh,
or worry about it too much, uh, [clicking] I guess ultimately,

A.29:  [Throat_clearing].

B.30:  I'm not a, a horribly bad speller, although I have a tendency to
lisp when I type, so to speak.

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  Uh, nothing that, that's particularly horrible, and I think most of the
work, word processing I do, since it's somewhat of a personal nature, I've,
probably don't have a sense of vulnerability in this, i-, in the even that I
were to s-, to, to send a, a misspelled word out the way one might have at the
office place.

A.33:  Right.  Well, I tend to, that's one thing I notice the speed difference in.
When I have a darc-, document that's maybe twenty or thirty pages long, and I,

B.34:  Uh.

A.35:  I want to search through it for the spelling, it takes forever on an old,
uh, X T at, at four point seven seven megahertz, you know the, the old, old
ones, and we're looking at, uh, several minutes worth of time for it to go
through and check everything as opposed to a three eighty-six where I can
just, you know, it flashes through there.  And then even just file copying.
I, I do some of that every once in awhile, and you know, if you had thirty or
forty files to copy from one place to another and you're maybe reorganizing
some places on the hard drive [cough] I have an X T at work, oh excuse me,
[cough] I have an X T at work that takes forever to copy and then I have a
three eighty-six that just, you know, they're, they're gone, they're just over
there, right away.

B.36:  Okay.

A.37:  And little things like that, I, I've noticed the speed difference in, and I
do some graphics, uh, I haven't done any, well, I've done a little bit for
the, for the house at work, but, uh, if I were to bring it home, uh, or have a
machine at home, I would like to be able to put together small, uh,
brochure-type things with the, the front page being a little, little bit of
graphics and the inside being printed in a, uh, what I would call a booklet
form.  There are some editors that will produce, uh, the, you know, print it
sideways, and, and collate it in such a way,

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these eight and a
half by elevens and make a little booklet.  And my, I've done that on occasion
at, at work and my wife does some, uh, teaching, you know, little bitty
weekend type teaching for some women in the area, and, and she likes to work
up little outlines and things in this format, and so I do all the work for her
at work, and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this
what you want, you know, instead of going back and forth every day.  It takes
us a little while to get it right.  But, uh, [sigh]

B.40:  Tha-, 

A.41:  I don't know, 

B.42:  That's a,

A.43:  maybe someday we'll, uh, get around to getting something decent, uh, to
bring home.

B.44:  That's an interesting point.  I think, [clicking] a, the more I, as I've
thought about our conversation, I realize that one of the things that perhaps
causes me not to get a jarring difference between the two locations is that,
at the office I'm doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what
I do at home, uh, and as a result, I don't get the comparative feel.  Uh, I
suspect if I were coming home and trying to do some of the projects I do at
the office,

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  I would go crazy on my, on my machine.  Uh, I haven't tended to play the
games and, and, uh, do the applications at work that I do at home, so I
probably have never been in, noticed how wonderful it might be.

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  Uh, I suspect Lotus One Two Three and spreadsheet application, 

A.49:  [Baby] {In background}.

B.50:  might be the one common thread.  Um, and there I think that even though
I'm on an eighty eighty-eight at home, the, the speed is really quite
adequate.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Uh, and, and I, consequently don't even really notice, uh, the, the
difference between the, the fast machine and, and the eighty eighty-eight.

A.53:  Yeah, unless they're tremendously large, they're not going to make that
much difference.

B.54:  Right.  Right, I, I do have some, uh, retirement modeling that I've done at
home that, uh, tends to crawl, uh, which, on which I've just turned the
calculation off in between.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And, a couple of models that I've built, uh, f-, for school purposes that I
start in the evening and then go to bed,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  and get them the next morning.  But they would have run an hour and a
half even on a thirty three eighty-six machine I imagine, so,

A.59:  Um.

B.60:  I suspect that what happens is that, uh, you get to the point where it's
so long that, uh, from a human being perspective, there's not much difference
between six hours and an hour and a half.

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  Um,

A.63:  That's interesting.  I hadn't, I hadn't run anything quite that long.
Fortunately there ...
