@A.1:  I like everything but jazz. 

B.2:  You like everything but jazz, what don't you like about jazz?

A.3:  I just don't, the, the beat, the tempo, the whatever it is that makes it
jazz just grates on my nerves, I just,

B.4:  So, you like, do you like rhythm and blues? 

A.5:  Yes, I like rhythm and blues, and I like,

B.6:  Okay.

A.7:  country western and I like,

B.8:  I like country western,

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  it's my favorite. 

A.11:  Waylon [laughter]. 

B.12:  Yeah, Willie, Waylon and the boys. 

A.13:  In fact, we bought, uh, THE EAGLE, uh, on a cassette tape,

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  I think THE EAGLES, even the name of the tape,

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  before it became the, the song of the war. 

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  So,# yes.#

B.20: # Do# you like, um, any rock and roll at all? 

A.21:  I like some, uh, art, of course, we have a twenty-five year old son who
loves hard rock,

B.22:  Right, 

A.23:  and I'm not, 

B.24:  I can't stand that.  

A.25:  no, I'm not that much on hard rock but he does have a lot of cass-, of,
uh, C D -s that I like, they,

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  I guess you'd have to call it soft rock.  I like Rod Stewart, and, and
some of the things he does.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  In fact, uh, when our car was stolen of, a little over a year ago in
Baltimore, I had a Rod Stewart tape in there that I was thinking the other day
that I ought to replace,

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  because I really kind of miss that music but,

B.32:  Yeah, some of my favorite groups are like, y-, Chicago, and, uh, oh, some
of the I guess what, what, you could call softer rock groups.  They were the
bigger groups in the seventies,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  and until all the heavy metal and all that came in and,

A.35:  That's too much isn't it?

B.36:  Yeah, I don't care for that at all. 

A.37:  It's, it's so loud and the, so many of the lyrics are so offensive and,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  gosh, we don't need that. 

B.40:  No, I got away from all that rock and roll stuff probably ten years ago and
just started listening to the country.

A.41:  When you matured [laughter]. 

B.42:  Yeah [laughter], I guess so. 

A.43:  I like some classical too, and,

B.44:  I like some classical, some of that stuff grates on my nerves too like you
were saying earlier about the other,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  I just ((stir up)) but there are some pieces that are really pretty.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  I think we hear more crap, classical music than we think we do
because of how much of it's used in commercials.

B.48:  Right, commercials and cartoons,

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  and things like that. 

A.51:  They slipped that in on us,

B.52:  #Uh-huh [laughter].#  

A.53: # when we're# not looking [laughter]. 

B.54:  Try and give it to us subliminal way [laughter]. 

A.55:  [Laughter] that's cheating, isn't it? 

B.56:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.57:  Well, I think we like the same kind of music. 

B.58:  I think so. 

A.59:  Nice chatting with you. 

@@B.60:  Same here.
