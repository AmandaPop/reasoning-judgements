===========================================================================

B.1:  Here we go.

A.2:  So, how do you rate gun control? 

B.3:  Well, I think, uh, I think on a scale of one to ten I would be, I would be
more toward a, uh, a, uh, uh, an, a stand that would not totally ban guns but
would certainly very much control them.  Uh,

@A.4:  I agree.  

B.5:  yeah, I think that, uh, uh, and, you know, I say this because I'm coming
from, uh, I'm coming from my, my, uh, uh, my, my parents and relatives in
Massachusetts are all avid gun owners, my Dad's got a big collection,

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  uh, my brother's got a collection, there, they both, uh, do police work,
uh, they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when, uh, uh,
guns were against the law only criminals owned them, [laughter], that sort of
thing.

A.8:  I agree. 

B.9:  But I, uh, uh, I, I think it's far too easy for people to get guns.  Uh,
let me, let me tell you a little, a little more of, of my background where I
really come to this position.  I, I, as I've told you before, uh, we lived in
Malaysia for four years,

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  and it, uh, I tell you how against the law guns or any kind of firearms
are, uh, it's a hanging offense,

A.12:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.13:  to have a gun.  There's two offenses that are hanging, one is to have a
gun, and the other is to, is to deal in narcotics.  And, and there's no
appeal.  Once you're found guilty, the sentence is automatic.

A.14:  So, I guess they don't have a drug problem over there, huh?

B.15:  Uh, well, it's everything they do, uh, well, they do and they don't, not
like we do here,

A.16:  Yeah. 

B.17:  you can't buy it off the street corners, but there's so much money to be
made in drugs that there's (( )) not ((for)) showing in Malaysia but people go
to Thailand and they have to bring them through the airport there.  The last
two people ((that got)) hung weren't even trying to sell them there.  They
were just, uh, caught with them,

A.18:  Oh, no.  

B.19:  and, and, and the, uh, the law says that if you've got a certain quantity
on you, you're presumed to be a dealer.

A.20:  Uh-huh. 

B.21:  If you're a user, the penalty isn't much, much less, you go to
rehabilitation, if you're a dealer, then you get hung.  But anyway, uh, they,
they have some very strong anti-gun laws there, and, and, uh, like it's a
hanging offense,

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  now, uh, yeah, people get broken into and they get slashed up with
knives, but at least the person has to be next to you, with a kni-, I mean,
you can outrun a knife but you can't outrun a gun.

A.24:  That's right. 

B.25:  So, uh, the violent, uh, there is not as many people getting killed in
robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here.  Uh, that's
probably why I've come to that, to that way of thinking, of course, the, uh,
the very emotional, uh, thinking over what happened to President Reagan, you
know, the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so, easily.

A.26:  Uh-huh. 

B.27:  Uh, but I'm sure that, they get a lot of publicity, there's probably a lot
of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally deranged people,
[laughter].

A.28:  Well, um, just recently I think it was Sunday on SIXTY MINUTES,

B.29:  Uh-huh.  

A.30:  they had an article or, uh, a news story about, uh, gun control, and in
Florida they have started something where, you know, you always have to be
eighteen or twenty-one to buy a gun but,

B.31:  Uh-huh.  

A.32:  um, they have started where they do a background ((trick)),

B.33:  Yeah. 

A.34:  and, so, aft-, you can go apply for this gun but it takes like seven
days,

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  until you can get it, and I think that's a good idea, you kn-, I'm not
for total gun control because I feel like people need to protect themselves.

B.37:  Right. 

A.38:  But, um, I think that, you know, the background check is a great idea.

B.39:  Yeah, I think it's a, I, I think it's great, and I'm trying to think, the,
uh, secret service agent that got, uh, injured so badly when he was trying to
protect President Reagan,

A.40:  Was it Brady?  

B.41:  Brady, 

A.42:  Yeah.

B.43:  and this is the law that's before the, the legislature right now is, is
referred to as the Brady bill, right?

A.44:  I didn't know about that. 

B.45:  Yeah, and, and that requires some, that would be at the federal level,

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  and require some waiting period presumably, uh, during that waiting
period there would be a background, uh, uh, check that would take place.

A.48:  I think that's great, but they also said on this, um, news story that, that
people can sell it to one another,

B.49:  Yeah. 

A.50:  and they wouldn't have to do the background check and, I mean, they went
on to tell about all the, the illegal guns and everything and that, I think
that SIXTY MINUTES bought some guns,

B.51:  Uh-huh.   

A.52:  and, um, like an uzi even, and,

B.53:  Yeah. 

A.54:  and, so, you know, there's a lot of controversy and people walk around at
gun shows with their big guns on their back saying for sale,

B.55:  Yeah. 

A.56:  and you don't have to do any of that kind of checking, I mean, any, they
would sell it to anybody.

B.57:  We, you know, I wonder, I had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently, I've
never been in one in my life before, and, uh, I was just looking around and,
and the majority of what they've got in there are guns.

A.58:  Uh-huh. 

B.59:  And I'll bet they don't, I'll bet you don't, I, I would imagine legitimate
gun dealers you'd have background checks, but I'll bet if somebody goes in and
offers a pawnshop guy some money,

A.60:  Enough money, that's right.  

B.61:  for a gun, he, he just picks it up over the counter.  And, and I was, I
was really surprised that, there, you can get guns of any kind that you want.
You know, the other thing is, you had talked about the, uh, needing a gun to
protect yourself,

A.62:  Uh-huh.  

B.63:  and, you know, maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber
here and then I'll change my mind, but there's so many accidents with children
accidentally getting ahold of guns,

A.64:  Yeah, there is. 

B.65:  uh, with the husband being out at night and the wife hearing rustling at
the door, [laughter], he forgot his key, wham, he's gone.  Uh, I, I actually
don't want one in my house for that reason,

A.66:  Oh, really?  

B.67:  uh, there's just too many things that can happen that are bad.

A.68:  Well, um, my Dad and my brother both have a collection of guns,

B.69:  Yeah. 

A.70:  and, um, I don't know, I guess, we've been taught responsibility when it
comes to guns but accidents always happen, but,

B.71:  Oh, sure.  

A.72:  my Dad has always kee-, kept his hid from us, I mean,

B.73:  Yeah. 

A.74:  even to this day I don't really,

B.75:  You don't really, you don't know where it is.  

A.76:  I, right, 

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  I know where his big gun is, like his shotgun, and stuff but, um, his
pistols and stuff like that and he keeps those hidden and it is just for our
protection, you know,

B.79:  Yeah. 

A.80:  if we did have a prowler he, he keeps it like, um, he has the little
rotary dial thing,

B.81:  Yeah. 

A.82:  and, like, I think it's the second shot or the third shot, the bullet's
in there but, I mean, he'll give them two chances.

B.83:  Oh, okay, that's, that's an interesting thing, 

A.84:  And, um,

B.85:  so, uh, yeah, that, the only way that would be a disadvantage if the
other guy's got a gun and fires when he sees his,

A.86:  Right [laughter].  

B.87:  and it's on, it's on the first shot.  Uh, I think the, the, uh, yeah, I,
I, I think that, you know, people have legitimate reasons for having them, the
only problem is so, many people have them that don't have legitimate reasons,

A.88:  Yeah. 

B.89:  for having them.  And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes
of passion, uh, you know, a guy may have one at home for his protection, but
suddenly, uh,

A.90:  His wife.  

B.91:  uh, yeah, wife or he gets in an argument with a neighbor and he goes
home, particularly when we get into the hot summers, and,

A.92:  That's happening more and more often, too. 

B.93:  oh, sure, he goes home and gets his gun out and comes back and shoot him,
there was a, uh, uh, just recently here in Dallas, I'm, I'm trying to
reconstruct it, somebody jumped in front of somebody in line, in front of a
seven eleven.  And they got mad and they had a little argument over it,

A.94:  Huh-uh.  

B.95:  so this one guy goes home, and he stood and talking to his, his, uh, uh,
brother about it, and he sees the guy that jumped the line in front of him
coming down the street, so, they get out and have more words, and the second
party went down to his house so, (( )) go and come back and shot the other guy
and killed him.

A.96:  Oh, my gosh. 

B.97:  And, and when they're available like that, people who normally wouldn't do
things like that, but momentarily fly off the trigger,

A.98:  That's right.  

B.99:  tend to, uh, uh, uh, uh, tend to do that and then, it happens in the, in
the cities a lot, it happens in, uh, uh, I, I guess at certain times of the
year tempers grow short.

A.100:  Uh-huh. 

B.101:  And, and, it happens then and I, I, uh, uh, you, you know, my, uh, uh,
oldest daughter's fiancee is a, uh, is a party, part, he's a college
professor, but he also is a reserve police officer.  And, and he, uh, he has
all kinds of guns, and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot.

A.102:  Uh-huh. 

B.103:  And, uh, uh, you know, I think that's good because she's not afraid of
them, and it, it teaches her to be responsible relative to guns, but, uh, when
he's out on police work, you know, he leaves her home alone and shows them
where they are in case she needs them, [laughter], and I worry about that.  I
would almost worry about that more than if she didn't have one.

A.104:  Yeah, because she might be,

B.105:  See what I mean, yeah,

A.106:  um, apt to,  

B.107:  uh, yeah, yeah,

A.108:  go get it a little quicker than,

B.109:  yeah, years ago I lived in an apartment and one night I heard, wham, and
boy it shock the apartment,

A.110:  Uh-huh.

B.111:  and, uh, I came out and some girls came flying out of their apartment,
uh, next to me and they asked me to come in and look and there was chips of
wood all over the place, and a big hole in the ceiling and a bullet coming to
rest on the pillow beside one them's head,

A.112:  Oh, no.  

B.113:  evidently it had ricocheted around the room.  Well, a young boy, ten or
eleven years old, uh, was living with his Dad in the apartment up above, and
his Dad's girlfriend was visiting and the Dad took the girlfriend home, and
apparently the boy had, uh, he had a gun in there for protection, so, the boy
was bored, it was a three fifty-seven magnum,

A.114:  [Breathing].  

B.115:  and he was sitting there spinning the chamber, and it went off and
actually shot his toe off, and went through the ceili-, uh, through the, his
floor, which was the ceiling of the apartment below that,

A.116:  Yeah. 

B.117:  and I say, ricocheted around the room a little bit, it was kind of scary,
huh.

A.118:  Yeah, really if it landed on her pillow beside her,

B.119:  Yeah, and it, 

A.120:  if she had, uh, just rolled over,

B.121:  it had about spent all it's energy, but you could see there was
splintered wood from all the places that it hit going around the room.

A.122:  Oh, my gosh. 

B.123:  And, and, uh, so I, I, uh, I, I think we're almost coming from the same
place on this subject really,

A.124:  Yeah, I do, too.  

B.125:  I, I, I, I think that, that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning
them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of
protection.

A.126:  Um, I think I would rate probably a seven. 

B.127:  Yeah, I think I would, too.  I think I would, too.

A.128:  Just because, um, you're right, I think that if we did ban them, the bad
guys would still have them.

B.129:  Yeah, [laughter], be,

A.130:  I mean,

B.131:  uh, well, it's, too, late.  Hey, if I were starting my own country from
the beginning, from the beginning I would.

A.132:  Probably like the country Malaysia, is that where you said?

B.133:  Yeah, Malaysia, 

A.134:  I mean, they started it.

B.135:  but of course, uh, it's also true in Great Britain. 

A.136:  Oh, really? 

B.137:  Yeah, they're not allowed in Great Britain either,

A.138:  No, I didn't know that.

B.139:  even the policemen don't carry them, the policemen carry clubs but don't
...
