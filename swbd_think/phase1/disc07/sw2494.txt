REMARKS:        There were many skips in the tape.  Just a few of them were 
in the middle of words.  It just sounded like someone was keying a microphone 
off and on frequently. 

=============================================================================

A.1:  Today, as I understand it, is [breathing] [throat_clearing] [breathing]
less than half of all eligible voters participate in national elections.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  And less than that in local elections.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  And do you think that's a problem?  And do you have any, or do we, can we
can come, come up with any solutions for that?  So, if you're ready, we'll
start.

B.6:  Okay.

@A.7:  I participate [breathing] in all of the national, you know, elections and
the state elections that, you know, that affect me.  I'm sometimes not too
good in local elections.  I do, I do, you know, vote in bond matters and, uh,
[breathing] things like that, but I don't, I no longer have children in
school, so school board elections, you know, doesn't really --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- you know, I don't really get terribly interested in that, [smack] but --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- but I do try to, [breathing] I don't just vote to be voting, you know, I
try to have, you know, educate myself a little bit --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- you know, on the, on the issues, rather than just voting blindly, you
know.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  That's, that's what I do.  I always, I vote in the national
elections, and I vote pretty much, I've been pretty good about voting in, uh,
most of, uh, for like the, for, for mayor --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and governor, and --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- and things like that, 

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  and try to, try to, you know, go through and figure out, because most of
the people you don't, a lot of them you don't have any knowledge of,

A.21:  That's true.

B.22:  and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- Republican or all Democrat.  I try to, I try to find out a little bit
about them.

A.25:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do too.

B.26:  But, I understand why, I, I know one problem is, uh,

A.27:  [Smack].

B.28:  why people don't, don't register to vote.  I, I know some personally,
because in the past, and I think that's been changed, that, [breathing] that's
how they get the jury, uh, rolls.

A.29:  Yeah, right, uh-huh.

B.30:  From, from voter registration, but I think that's going to be changed.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  So I don't know, if, with that changing if, uh, you know, if the voting
will pick up, [breathing] but I think it's just like you say, when you're, if
you're, if you don't have an interest in something, and you don't really care,
--

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- you may not go and vote.

A.35:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.

B.36:  But, uh, wha-, what is it, what was the percentage for national elections?

A.37:  Uh, less than half.

B.38:  Less than half. 

A.39:  Less than half.  I was kind of surprised to hear that.

B.40:  That, that surprises me too.  

A.41:  Yeah, I thought it would have been higher than that.

B.42:  Hm.

A.43:  [Breathing] Do you ever or have you ever or do you ever actively work for a
candidate?

B.44:  Um, no, I haven't.

A.45:  Uh-huh [breathing].  Well, I've only done it one time way back when, uh,
John Connally was running for Governor in the State of Texas, many years ago.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.47:  My wife and I were [throat_clearing] pretty heavily involved in [breathing]
in working in his campaign.  It's really interesting to do.  It's hard work,
but it, it's interesting to do, [noise] but I haven't done any of it, done any
of it lately [noise].

B.48:  So, uh, the campaign that you worked when he was running for governor?

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And that, and he was elected, 

A.51:  Right.  Uh-huh.

B.52:  that time?

A.53:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.54:  Yeah it's, I, I would imagine it would be pretty, I, I have, uh, a friend
of mine whose, her son-in-law is a judge.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And and I've gone, to a, a few things, with her.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And, uh, it's, it's just like a different, different world, 

A.59:  It really is.

B.60:  getting involved with those kinds, with those,

A.61:  Yeah, yeah, it,

B.62:  with those, people in politics.

A.63:  it's interesting to do.

B.64:  So it is in-, very interesting.

A.65:  Yeah, we did mailings, put up signs, you know, and things like that.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  Went to a few dinners, things like, it was interesting.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  It really was.  Of course, it was all volunteer, we weren't paid members.
It was,

B.70:  So,

A.71:  interesting to do.

B.72:  so what, so do you think there's any, what, what could be done to improve
the,

A.73:  [Breathing].

B.74:  percent of voters?

A.75:  I don't know.  

B.76:  Because,

A.77:  Maybe it's, [breathing] you know, better education.  I don't know.  I do
believe that, you know, if you don't educate yourself [breathing] and vote in
this, these elections whether it's, you know, local or national, you pretty
well, you know, deserve, whatever you get,

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  you know, if you don't, [laughter] if you don't participate in it.  I
really, don't know what the solution would be.  Everybody [noise] or a lot of
people thought when they ended the poll tax, you know, many years ago that
that would bring out, you know, a lot of voters.

B.80:  Uh-uh.

A.81:  I don't know.  Maybe it, maybe it should be stressed through, you know,
public education in schools,

B.82:  [Breathing].

A.83:  you know, or something.  I don't know.

B.84:  I don't know.  Well, I know, f-, for, you know, my son who is of voting age
--

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- and, uh, he didn't want to, he did-, he said he couldn't afford to be
off from work,

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  because, because they did not pay, pay them for being off from work.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  And that's why he didn't register, but I, I wonder if that was r-, really,
you know, the r-, {pause} real reason.  And then {pause} I know my daughter,
uh, well, she's twenty now, but I got her a Voter Registration and gave it to
her.

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  [Breathing] and I really don't think she ever, turned it in --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- but, you know, I just don't think it's important to, to some people, and
maybe, thing, you know, circumstances may change and,

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  But to get them interested in doing it, I don't know.

A.97:  Yeah, I don't know, really know what a solution would be.  I really don't.
You know, like you say, if you, [laughter] if you do everything but fill out
the card for them that's really about all you can do.  Uh-huh.

B.98:  Maybe, maybe a real campaign and, you know, just go vo-, vote --

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  -- [Laughter] and stuff -- 

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- uh, it, uh, that maybe it --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- you know, just, just to really, really encourage people to, to do it.

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  so maybe that's, ma-, that would help.

A.107:  Yeah, 

B.108:  I'm sure.

A.109:  some sort of educational process.  I'm not quite sure, 

B.110:  Unless a lot of the people,

A.111:  what.

B.112:  who, who, who are eligible to vote have no transportation, 

A.113:  That's true.  Yeah.

B.114:  and, and are, you know, not able to get there --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- or, or for whatever reason.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  So, uh, I don't know.

A.119:  Yeah.  I don't know either.  It's kind of a tough question.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  Don't really know what a real solution would be for it --

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  -- except like you say, some sort of an educational process.

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  Something to generate interest, I don't know quite what.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  I really don't know [breathing].  Well, maybe some other genius can figure
this out [laughter].

B.128:  [Laughter]. 

A.129:  I don't know.

B.130:  Well, maybe, maybe we'll get this question again, and can,

A.131:  [Laughter] Maybe so.

B.132:  get some thoughts in the meantime.  If I had, some, you know, think about
it ahead of time.

A.133:  Yeah, right.  

B.134:  #So,#

A.135:  #Yeah.#  Well, it's nice talking to you.

B.136:  Nice talking to you, Charles.

A.137:  Take care.

B.138:  Bye.

A.139:  Bye-bye.
