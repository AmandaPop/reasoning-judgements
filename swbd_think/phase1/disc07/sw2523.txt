A.1:  [T V] How are you tonight?

B.2:  [T V] [Breathing] I'm fine.

A.3:  Are you a native American?

B.4:  Yes.

A.5:  So you are real [laughter].  So all the rest of us are, uh, immigrants.

B.6:  I guess #[laughter].  ((Why))?#

A.7:  #It's kind of interesting# that they would do, how do you feel about the
idea of letting all these foreigners in [rustling]?

B.8:  It doesn't, well to a point, it's okay.  You know.  I don't mind.  I've
never had a problem with them letting people in.  I just don't think that
they, they are right in some of the things they do.

A.9:  Well, do you think there should be restrictions on, uh, who you should
let in #(( ))?#

B.10:  #No.#  Because then you get to the problem of then, then you're not a free
country anymore.  #Okay?#

A.11:  #Well,# what about if somebody was, uh, is sick.  Say they have AIDS or
something?  

B.12:  Uh, it doesn't matter.  Everybody over here has got it anyway.  You know,
AIDS is AIDS as long as, if they tell you before they come here, that's fine,
you know, that they got AIDS.  But then all you have to do is make sure
they're not passing it around.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  But then they don't know how it really, you know, to me they don't know
nothing about AIDS anyway, so.

A.15:  Yeah, that, it, it's really #sad that, uh# --

B.16:  #That's just a different, you know.#

A.17:  -- but apparently they're, they're, I think there are some rules that
won't let people in who have ...

B.18:  My, my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here
on welfare or trying to make it and, you know, the,

A.19:  [Noise].

B.20:  United States gives people that come into the country more money to start
their life than the people that's already here that's trying.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  That's the only fallback I see because I've seen, like when the Vietnamese
come over, they get, they have stores.  And, you know, Uncle Sam done bought,
uh, uh, you know, Uncle Sam had to pay for it.  They gave them that loan.  But
people over here can't even get a small business loan like that.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  It's harder for somebody from America to get a loan from their own country
when a foreigner can get more.  And I don't think that's right.

A.25:  Yeah.  That, that can really be a problem.  I know in, in, in New York,
there's a problem with the Koreans.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  That, uh, that, that the, uh, black community is complaining that the
Koreans are taking over.

B.28:  What is, the yeah.  That and then you have, well then you have the, well no
Mexicans they, they don't take over too much.  They just, they just make more
money.

A.29:  Well I have a friend that's married to a, in fact he w-, went to Korea and
married a Korean.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And brought her home and, uh --

B.32:  That's a lot [laughter].

A.33:  -- the problem was that, that she is a real hard worker and has started a,
a couple of businesses.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  And now she's started a Korean health food store and she's really a
go-getter.  That, uh, and she started off, uh, cleaning, uh, houses.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  And, uh, then she found out that these automobile dealerships needed and so
she got some people to help her.  And she had one and then she was doing a
good job and she wound up having eight or ten automobile dealerships.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  that she was cleaning and, and apparently, uh, her, her husband is sort of
watching the money for her but apparently she's a, really a hard worker and
willing to do the hard work.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  And has been able and now she's made enough money to start this health food
store.  I don't know how she's doing but it, I g-, you have to admire the
people who have come in and work and don't, you know, don't take money from
the government [noise].

B.42:  Yeah.  Now that's all right.  I don't mind people that work for what they
do.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  I give them a, and if, and if they work so hard and then ge-, give them a
small, that's fine.  I just don't think that the handouts are equal.

A.45:  No.  It, it, #it's also kind of# ...

B.46:  #Okay.  That's what I'm saying.#  There, there's so much problem with the
handouts.  And then, now by the economy being like it is, this is the worst
time they could have for everybody coming into the United #States.#

A.47:  #Well,# and the problem is that the jobs.  It's, it's like the minimum
wage, everybody saying well I made the minimum wage but my s-, I have a
seventeen year old son and he's saying well he'll go out and work at minimum
wage.  Well, the problem is minimum wage is not enough to live on.

B.48:  No it's not.  And if it's, uh, it's just like my husband, well we was
talking about it before.  He sold his truck, he was a truck driver.  Now for
him to actually make money, he would have to make almost nine dollars a hour.
That's just to live.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Okay.  But you can't find no jobs like that.

A.51:  No.  You d-, and --

B.52:  Okay?

A.53:  -- and, and that's what I think is so sad about the whole proposition and
if you've got all these people who come and work for, for #nothing and, 
uh# ...

B.54:  #Nothing.  That's where# you problem comes in.  Is because some people will
work for nothing when other people won't.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  And then that's why you have yo-, I think that's where the, the, the line
is.  Even in Ja-, in Japan though, it's the same way.  They have their, their
economy is booming because of the United States {mispronounced}.  #If you
don't# --

A.57:  #Yeah.#

B.58:  -- understand that and I, I, I sit and I think about it.  But the, the car,
the car market over th-, the automobile industry, you know, it's been the
United States for so long and the last fifteen, twenty years, Japanese have
just taken over.

A.59:  Yeah.  Why do you, do you, do you think that has any, anything to do though
with uh ...

B.60:  I think it has a lot to do with the price of a car.  And how much, see to
me they, people don't look at it, but if you take a Japanese car and bring it
over here, they sell it for the same amount of American car.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Okay.  If you take a American car and take it to Japan, you can't even
har-, you couldn't afford it.  

A.63:  [Inhaling] What, what #about cars that are, that# ...

B.64:  #So our, our import# tax on them is no big deal.  But their, their tax on
us and you can't, you can't do that.  Plus they can make it cheaper because
they don't pay that much.

A.65:  Well, what about the, what about the fact that it is right across the
border in Mexico?

B.66:  The, what is?

A.67:  Well, you know, I don't know if #you kn-,# ...

B.68:  #I don't,# I don't like the idea of th-, illegal aliens.  #I don't# ... 

A.69:  #Well, but no,# I'm talking about the idea of the, that the company set up,
uh, factories right across the border.  Right across the Texas #border in
Mexico.#

B.70:  #Oh, that's just,# that's just so that the, uh, now see they made more
money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico.

A.71:  Well, you, you, you think, you think that's worse than, than having the
Mexicans come across the border and work in the factory of the United States
and take jobs away from Americans?

B.72:  Yeah.  I, no, I think it would be better if they would stay down there and
get right papers to come across the border.

A.73:  Well, but, but what you think of the, of, of the big, uh, the big companies
that, uh, that, that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of
the United States down to Mexico.

B.74:  Well, there's a lot of companies, T I do that.  T I got companies in
Mexico.  I don't if it's in Mexico, Mexico but they got them in, in foreign
countries.

A.75:  Yeah.  It's in (( )).

B.76:  You know. #So, but# ...

A.77:  #Anyway, but, but do you think,# but the thing is, d-, if they put a
factory down there that means that there's more jobs for those people so
they're not crossing the border (( )).

B.78:  As much.  But some of them are still crossing.  Not because of, I know a
lot of times I don't think it's just because of the money.  I think it's
because they don't, they, the, the, the country themselves.  You know, like
the government, should I say.

A.79:  [Noise].  

B.80:  Because everybody's not free to do what they want to do in every country.

A.81:  We-, but do you think, do you think that's why there's so many people that
want to come to the United States, cause of freedom or?

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  [Whistling] Do you think that's the main reason?  Or do you think the ...

B.84:  I think it's freedom and the, and, and to, and the right to do what you
want to do.  

A.85:  As opposed to, #well# ...

B.86:  #Doing# what the government wants you to do or been, doing the government
thinks you're able to do.  So it's the same thing.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  And the government forcing you or taking more of your money than you want
to give them.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  Because I can make a million dollars and I know exactly, Uncle Sam can't
take half my money.  They can take [noise] {sounds like a frog} whatever the
percentage is for that amount, you know.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  That's it.

A.93:  Yeah.  But do yo-, but th-, what about the, do you think that's fair for,
for people that come in here from say, like the, I know, I know a lot of
Koreans.  That's why, uh --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- and, and you think it's #fair?#

B.96:  #The# only thing about a Korean or, or the Vietnamese that, like I said, I
don't like is the idea, like I said, is I don't mind them, cause they can do
anything they want to do and as long as they don't take jobs but see a lot of
the jobs they're taking, people don't realize, nobody else wants.

A.97:  [Inhaling] Well, yeah.  We were ...

B.98:  You see what I'm saying?

A.99:  Yeah.  Well, we had, uh, we knew some Laotians and, and, uh, the job they
took, uh, you know, basically are cleaning jobs.

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  And, uh, course there's a lot of money in cleaning, you know.  If you get
a good business going.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  You know, there's, there's a lot of money to be made for cleaning.  But
they, uh ...

B.104:  But see, just like her Korean food store.  

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  Okay.  That's mostly for Koreans.  

A.107:  Yes.

B.108:  And that's just like over here on on, on Walnut and, uh, Plano Road or is
it Jupiter.  One of them streets.  Anyway, #that# --

A.109:  #Uh# ...

B.110:  -- whole section is nothing but #like# --

A.111:  #Yes.#

B.112:  -- Chinese or, or foreign.  I don't #what# --

A.113:  #Yeah.#

B.114:  -- it is #[laughter].  Okay.#

A.115:  #Yeah, it is.#  And I found that, uh ...

B.116:  And that's because they cater to their own people.  

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  Which people don't realize it but there is a lot of them here.  And that
way they can make money.  Because they make money and then they put it right
back into, to somebody elses business.

A.119:  And tha-, that's interesting though.  I #(( ))#

B.120:  #And, and there, that# is wrong with America.  People don't put they money
back into the same thing.  That's why American buy for-, if Americans would
buy American cars --

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  -- we wouldn't have to worry about #none of this.#

A.123:  #Yeah.  What# they were saying is that these, uh, people come in and they
are, uh, they were, uh, live on say twenty percent of what they make and, and
they'll put four or five families in, in one apartment.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  And, uh, and ...

B.126:  But see some people you can't do that to.  Some apartments won't let you do
that.

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  And then a lot of people you can't, like I don't think I could live with
my sister.

A.129:  [Laughter]  Well, that's another thing #[laughter].#

B.130:  #Okay?#  Families, American families don't get along that good.  They'll
stick together.

A.131:  No.  But the idea though is i-, i-, if you could put two or three families
in a, in a, together, they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save
their money #and# --

B.132:  #That's right.#

A.133:  -- and, uh, and buy a #bunch of things.#

B.134:  #That's why,# now that works.  If you can find somebody to do it with but
it's very rare #that you can [laughter] find somebody to do it with.#

A.135:  #[Laughter] Well most of us like our# freedom you know.  We like to be left
alone and we like, uh --

B.136:  Uh-huh [/T V] [/breathing].

A.137:  -- you know, we like to have our own room and [/T V],
