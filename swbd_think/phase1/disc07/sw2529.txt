REMARKS:        Just a few spots in the conversation were hard to understand.

=============================================================================

@A.1:  Um, she asked if I, I guess they went ahead and told you we're supposed to
be talking about, uh, drug testing and what do we think about the policy of
most companies and government agencies and, of course, that's something we're
familiar with [laughter].

B.2:  Right.  Um, #okay, go ahead.#

A.3:  #You want to go ahead# or,

B.4:  No, no, go ahead. 

A.5:  Um, personally it was something that, uh, I mean, I know it presents an
emotional issue, morale issue, people feel like maybe my rights are being
violated, but I work in human resources so I work with a lot of folks that,
um, are in accidents or where safety considerations are concerned and,

B.6:  Okay, yeah. 

A.7:  I really feel like that T I -s decision to go with drug testing was good,
you know, because I, I feel like that, you know, all, all it takes is one
person coming to work under the influence of some narcotic, um, ((truly into))
a lot more of our workers.

B.8:  Yeah, and that's, that's funny you're in human resources and I'm in, uh,
health and safety.

A.9:  Are you? 

B.10:  Yes. 

A.11:  [Laughter]. 

B.12:  Um, I think it's a good idea I, I, I don't think that they've gone far
enough though, I think they should, they should, uh, also test for alcohol.

A.13:  Well, now the thing, you know, course, they've always said separately that,
um, you know, we have, we have a policy on alcohol, course, if anybody's under
the, uh, influence, or if you have reasonable suspicion then that would result
in ((corrective action)) for them also and that, of course, has been in place
for years.

B.14:  Right.  #But,#

A.15:  #But# it's not specifically tested for that. 

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  No, and, and from everything that I can gather, you know, reading different
articles and, and just a newspaper in general, uh, uh, news on the, ((um)),
television.  It seems that alcohol is the, is the most prevalent, um, a,
addictive drug.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Even though the, all the college campuses now, the, they're saying that
the majority of, of, uh, students, uh, drink,

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  and most of them are partying, but yet we don't test for that and I
wonder if we don't do that because it is so prevalent and would put probably
lose a quarter of all our population have.

A.23:  How long does alcohol stay in the system?  I mean, like if somebody went
out and had some drinks the night before, is that going to be there the next
day?

B.24:  Well, they say your system, a normal, a normal person should be able to
metabolize an ounce of alcohol per hour.

A.25:  Okay.

B.26:  And then again it, it ((de-,)) depends on the bigger you are and, you know,
the more bulk that you have, you, you can, your system can tolerate more
alcohol so, a large person can probably, um, metabolize maybe a little bit
more,

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  than a smaller person.  But even that, yeah, if you go out, you know,
because some people go out maybe, oh, ((you know)) they drink up a gallon.

A.29:  Yeah, they do.

B.30:  Um, which, ((what's)) the, uh, consensus down there when, when, uh, T I
announced that, uh, the drug testing program,

A.31:  #We had,#

B.32:  #did you get# a lot of, uh, animosity against that? 

A.33:  I didn't get a lot, no, not like I expected.  Um, we had, you know, one or
two that were extremely outspoken, you know, felt like it really violated
their rights and, and, um, and it was not the people that I would have
expected.  Um, it's, one of them stands out in my mind as an extremely, uh,
just a super person in management, you know, and he's, he's very family
oriented, his family's very close, he, he also opposes in the schools like
for his kids because he says, you know, we are a good Christian family, we do
not do,

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  this type of thing.  It definitely violates our rights and he was very
outspoken, but for the most part people were like, well, I don't like it, uh,
it's not something I prefer to do, but I understand the reasoning.  And I
think part of the attitude is that I think T I went to really great lengths in
communicating and tried to prepare them and, and tell them why and, you know,
they didn't just announce it without really #any forethought.#

B.36:  #Yes, no,# that's, you're right.  Yeah.

A.37:  And, uh, I, I think they don't go far enough, uh, kind of on a different
vein and that is that I think every time we have any type of industrial
accident at T I, I think somebody ought to be tested immediately.  And, you
know, maybe that's just me personally but I, I feel like,

B.38:  Sure that's an idea too, I just, uh,

A.39:  you know, I feel like if something happens, uh, that causes an accident,
you ought to test the parties involved immediately just, just if nothing else
to rule it out.

B.40:  Yeah, that's a,

A.41:  Um,

B.42:  that's a thought.  Um, I don't know if you can go, depends on the
severity of the accident, I think, you know, if you get, like up here because
we've got, heavy industry we've got, you know, uh, uh, smelting plant and
we've got,

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  we've got a lot of, uh, metals rolling and ((sliding)) and stuff like
that so, we've got a lot of, we are, we end up with a lot of, uh, hand
injuries, you know, cuts,

A.45:  #Yes.#

B.46:  #and# things like that.  But perhaps, um, if you could weed out those, the
people that have chronic accidents, and test those, you know, that's a start,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  and that's a good id-, that's a good point. 

A.49:  I guess what makes me ((think)) of that, you know, you hear them doing that
like it's a, or like Amtrak, you know, if, if they have a derailment or, or
transportation industry,

B.50:  Yes.  

A.51:  it seems like if there's accidents, train accidents, things like that,
they test and I think, well, why not because we do have some large industrial
accidents sometimes.  Uh, you know, if you have a large acid spill, you know,
well, gee, maybe you better check this person who's handling all these acids.
You know, I work with a ((wafer fab)) so, we do a lot with chemicals and acids
and,

B.52:  Oh, okay, yeah.

A.53:  Uh, things like that but I, I do feel like companies are justified and I do
feel like, I mean, I, I guess I hate as an individual that anything like this
has ever become necessary in our, you know, in our nation but, but I feel like
that it's a good thing to do.

B.54:  Well, I can see transportation because now your dealing with, or if they
have the responsibility over a great number of people,

A.55:  That's true.

B.56:  rather than themselves, um, but, but thinking on that, yeah, because
we've got, we've got truck drivers here that go between plants, you know,
locally,

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  and carry material, and they carry acids and things too.

A.59:  Sure.

B.60:  Um, I don't know what the, what the, uh, company plant is, they went
through, I guess key personnel first,

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  and then it funneled down to, uh, the general population,

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  but I wonder if,

A.65:  Now, that started in January of last year. 

B.66:  Yeah, and I, I still haven't been called yet, in fact,

A.67:  Is that right? 

B.68:  Yeah, in fact, out of our office staff is, let's see there's, uh, four,
six, there's seven of us and there's only one been called.

A.69:  Well, I've been lucky, I've been called twice [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

A.71:  Well, I,

B.72:  I, I probably shouldn't be talking to you then, right? 

A.73:  No, I had to test once, um, when they did the key personnel, they test all
human resource folks.

B.74:  Okay.

A.75:  And so I, I, I was once there and then in the general random sampling last
year I was, I contacted,

B.76:  And then you just got lucky again, right? 

A.77:  Yeah, and that, you know, I have that same uneasy feeling that other folks
have, you know, I know, I, I mean, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do
nothing [laughter],

B.78:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.79:  you know,

B.80:  I used to smoke years ago but I don't now.

A.81:  but you still walk in there and go, gee, what if something I ate, what if
something I've done, what if something I've eaten shows up.

B.82:  Well, it's not only that, but I've read different articles and they said
even the, even the best of labs, they come back with erroneous samples,

A.83:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.84:  and even if they get a, a reading, I guess, they test the same sample
again.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  And they're going to get the same reading, suppose they, uh, you know, it's
a, do they crucify you right then and there or do they, do they go back and
retest?

A.87:  Well, now if the lab is making on error on the sample then when they
retest, the error should not be there.  Uh,

B.88:  But they retest the same sample.

A.89:  Yeah, but the error is on the part of the lab not on the sample, in other
words if somebody makes a mistake,

B.90:  Oh, I see.

A.91:  in what they're reading,

B.92:  Oh, okay. 

A.93:  then they're not going to get the same reading the second time.

B.94:  But if they do then your, your pretty well,

A.95:  If they do,

B.96:  condemned, right?  

A.97:  then you have, you always have the recourse, um, you know, before we do
anything, we sit down and talk with the person,

B.98:  To be retested?

A.99:  about, is there any reason why this should have shown up.  And a lot of
times, you know, uh, they'll go, oh, yeah, I was on a prescription for this,
and they can go get it and bring it in.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  You know, in which case they're fine, obviously those are recorded as
negatives if you're under, you know, legal qualified medical care.  Um,

B.102:  Yeah, but I often won-, wondered about that too.

A.103:  if, if we're talking marijuana [laughter], 

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  if it's in the system, uh, then yeah, you know, that would be grounds
for, uh, if it's their second positive it would be grounds for termination, if
it's their first positive then they're setup with E A P counseling.

B.106:  Do you know of any incidences, of, of, of erroneous,

A.107:  We had a couple,

B.108:  you know, something, they make a mistake, the lab made a mistake and it
really wasn't,

A.109:  No.

B.110:  nothing. 

A.111:  No, in fact, see T I actually sends, uh, test samples from time to time,
uh,

B.112:  Oh, just to see,

A.113:  just to check the validity of the lab, yeah, and, uh,

B.114:  just to check on a lab?

A.115:  so, that's kind of an ongoing test process for the, we do for ((Compucam)),

B.116:  We must be,

A.117:  and you know, they don't know which ones are test samples. 

B.118:  Yeah, we must be doing the same up here too.

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  We, we probably send to a different lab then you guys down there.

A.121:  I don't think so, I think the whole company uses ((Compucam)) which is over
there on the east coast somewhere.

B.122:  Oh.

A.123:  And ours actually are mailed there.  Uh, [throat_clearing], they're the, I
think the largest and they do a lot of the government contractors they have an
excellent, excellent rate, um,

B.124:  Oh, yeah. 

A.125:  And just uh the-,
