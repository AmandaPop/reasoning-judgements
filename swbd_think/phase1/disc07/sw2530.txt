@B.1:  What, I mean, hobbies do you enjoy? 

A.2:  Uh, well, let's see, I suppose I could say I enj-, joy crocheting.  Um,
gardening, knitting, oh, hiking.

B.3:  Do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of
have to make time for?,

A.4:  Well, it seems like I don't have time for them, but I'm, I don't work
full-time or anything.

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  I sell Avon and Stanley products. 

B.7:  Uh-huh. 

A.8:  But it's, that's not, you know, the same as an eight hour job [laughter].

B.9:  Well, it can't from what I've hea-, understood it ca-, can be,

A.10:  #Yeah,# 

B.11:  #sometimes.#     

A.12:  it's, it's up to the person [laughter]. 

B.13:  Yeah.  Well I, I enjoy needlepoint although boy, I guess, I got myself
burned out, I did too much, too fast,

A.14:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.15:  and for some reason my eyes aren't quite what they used to be either.

A.16:  Oh.

B.17:  And, um,

A.18:  You sound young. 

B.19:  Yeah, yeah, I am but I, I don't know it's just maybe it's the light but,

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  and, um, I enjoy photography as a hobby. 

A.22:  Oh, good.

B.23:  And boating,

A.24:  Uh-huh. 

B.25:  and horseback riding although I'm recovering from back surgery so it's
going to be awhile before I can,

A.26:  Huh.

B.27:  do either one of those [laughter]. 

A.28:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.29:  And bowling and right now my biggest hobby, I guess, since, um, you know,
recovering, is watching television [laughter] and playing Nintendo with my
son [laughter].

A.30:  Yeah, that could be a little boring sometimes I guess too but,

B.31:  And I do enjoy reading,

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  um, I do read a lot, read quite a lot,

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  uh, I enjoy reading different types of things. 

A.36:  Uh-huh. 

B.37:  I enjoy reading novels and then, uh, you know, more serious stuff
[laughter].

A.38:  How, how old is your little boy?

B.39:  Today's his birthday.

A.40:  Oh, is it really?

B.41:  Yeah [laughter].

A.42:  Oh, how old?

B.43:  Six.

A.44:  Oh, that's nice.  My baby's expecting her first baby,

B.45:  Oh, really?  

A.46:  this month ((say, yes)) [laughter],

B.47:  Oh, how exciting [laughter], that could, it's always,

A.48:  so, our, our children are all grown up. 

B.49:  Do they live close by? 

A.50:  Just one of them. 

B.51:  The one that's going to have the baby? 

A.52:  Uh-huh. 

B.53:  Well, that's good, you, that will be your new hobby then. 

A.54:  Yeah [laughter].

B.55:  Taking care of grandbaby [laughter].  Um, my sister's going to have a baby
this summer.

A.56:  Uh-huh.  

B.57:  So, but, I guess that's a little off the subject. 

A.58:  Yeah [laughter] [throat_clearing].

B.59:  I don't know, I've tried various things, I've tried to get interested in
things like refinishing furniture,

A.60:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

B.61:  woodworking, or, um, ceramics, but it just seems like it's so expensive
to break into something new,

A.62:  Huh, uh-huh.

B.63:  that, um, you know, with my, I've got qui-, enough of an investment in my
photography equipment,

A.64:  Yeah,

B.65:  that,

A.66:  we, we had for a while them, uh, well, we still do a lot of picture
taking in that,

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  and, uh, we're in the process of putting our eight millimeter, uh, films
and now the kids and that, were going to put them on video.

B.69:  Oh, yeah.

A.70:  And we're, we're in the process of doing that right now and, 

B.71:  Are you doing that yourself? 

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  How do you do it? 

A.74:  Uh, we bought the equipment, uh, that you do it with. 

B.75:  You don't have to, I mean, is the something that you don't have to see it
as yo-, it's not like your,

A.76:  Well, the, you buy this little, little piece of equipment,

B.77:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.78:  and you use your video camera, of course,

B.79:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

A.80:  and, uh, your projector. 

B.81:  Oh, okay, {very faint} that's what I wondered.

A.82:  And the combination, you, the way you co-, you know, connect them up.

B.83:  Do they make good quality copies, do you think?

A.84:  Uh, I think it's going to.  We were a little worried there was a lot of
background noise on it but, uh, we can hook it into our, uh, stereo system
after we get the pictures all done,

B.85:  Uh-huh.  

A.86:  we can hook it into our, uh, a vide-, or, uh, stereo system and, uh, put
music to the,

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  film,

B.89:  Oh.

A.90:  and that will cut out all the background, the noise of the, uh, recorder
running and that.

B.91:  Well, that's nice.

A.92:  Because the projector made a lot, makes a lot of noise. 

B.93:  Yeah, I remember those.  We never had one,

A.94:  Yeah. 

B.95:  my parents never had one but, um,

A.96:  And, uh, so, that's been kind, and our darkroom is ve-, we have a darkroom,

B.97:  Oh. 

A.98:  but it's very dusty [laughter]. 

B.99:  That's my dream, I guess, is to have my own darkroom. 

A.100:  We, we're real active in it for a long time but, you know, you get busy
and,

B.101:  Yeah, um, 

A.102:  the kids grow up and,

B.103:  They're expensive to maintain {very faint} just the chemicals are
expensive.

A.104:  Yeah, we mainly just did ((little)) black and white, it's,

B.105:  Yeah, I would ((still like)) black and white,

A.106:  Uh-huh.  

B.107:  to me black and white is photography, color is more snapshot [laughter].

A.108:  Oh, you can really get some good, really good pictures in black and white
{very faint} but,

B.109:  Yeah, you really can.  People don't realize that.

A.110:  Uh-huh. 

B.111:  Not realize that black and white it, nowadays, it's actually more expensive
than, uh,

A.112:  Uh-huh.  

B.113:  color. 

A.114:  It's hard to even find film or anything. 

B.115:  Yeah.

A.116:  But, uh,

B.117:  And I, well, I used to, I learned how to knit when I was little, my
grandmother knitted a lot,

A.118:  Uh-huh.  

B.119:  and she knitted all the time. 

A.120:  Did she?  Oh, that's great.  

B.121:  And, uh, before she passed away and made some beautiful things,

A.122:  Yeah. 

B.123:  but I've never really learned how to do more than the basic.

A.124:  Yeah, I don't do a whole, it, time seems to be hard to find for anything,

B.125:  Uh-huh.  

A.126:  you want to do, I don't know why. 

B.127:  Yeah, I know. 

A.128:  You'd think I'd have a lot of time, but [laughter],

B.129:  Yeah, you'd think I would too, but, you know.

A.130:  But I, I, I'm knitting an afghan for the baby and I haven't,

B.131:  Oh.

A.132:  worked on this for several weeks [laughter].  I just haven't got back to
it.

B.133:  When's the baby due?  [Laughter].

A.134:  The twenty-ninth [laughter]. 

B.135:  Time to get busy, do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl?

A.136:  I don't know. 

B.137:  Oh.

A.138:  They don't really care what they have.

B.139:  Is it her first one? 

A.140:  {Very faint} Yeah.  They didn't want to know [laughter], so, uh,

B.141:  Well,

A.142:  But, but I do enjoy it.  I, I, I enjoy painting some too, but I, I re-,
really have trouble finding time.  I did, did some ((toll)) painting for a
while and I,

B.143:  Yeah. 

A.144:  started doing a still life and it's, it never got finished. 

B.145:  That's something I've, it's interesting to me, people who watch people who
are go-, know how to paint, I just felt like that's something I've never been
very good at or,

A.146:  Well, 

B.147:  very good at drawing or anything.  

A.148:  had, have you watched any of these things on T V, these,

B.149:  I've watched, uh,

A.150:  large brush, 

B.151:  I've, yeah, here and there but they make it lo-, uh, I, I know that,

A.152:  [Laughter].

B.153:  you know, they just make it look so, easy,

A.154:  Uh-huh.  

B.155:  but I know it, I'm smart enough to know that it's not quite that easy.

A.156:  Well, once you start it apparently it's not bad.  Some of the girls have
gone into the ((call age)) group,

B.157:  Uh-huh.  

A.158:  (( )) university is just not too far from here, and they've gone in and,
uh, done a class on the large brush and,

B.159:  Yeah.

A.160:  actually do the painting, and, you know, they've never done anything and
they come out pretty nice [laughter].

B.161:  Yeah, I've, yeah, and I know a girl that used to do it and hers did too,
but I just don't think, see myself ((whipping)) out masterpieces in thirty
minutes [laughter],

A.162:  [Laughter].

B.163:  like they do on the show [laughter].  Do you enjoy cooking?

A.164:  Yeah, I like to cook. 

B.165:  I like to cook but I've really gotten away from it, it's,

A.166:  Yeah, I don't, 

B.167:  with just two, 

A.168:  do a lot of fancy cooking.

B.169:  my son and myself it's just not, to me it's just he, you know, I hate,
you know, hate to admit this but we live on frozen food [laughter].

A.170:  Well, it depends on what it is, uh, you know,

B.171:  Yeah, they have,

A.172:  well, now, we, I, we, gar-, have a small garden and I can, I do canning
and, uh,

B.173:  Huh.  Now, I like gardening, that's, of course, that's something I can't do
with my back.

A.174:  Uh, yeah.

B.175:  And, uh, my back,

A.176:  That's too bad.  Was it lower back or,

B.177:  Yeah.  My Dad's grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and,

A.178:  Uh-huh. 

B.179:  we always had fresh vegetables which I just really like. 

A.180:  Yeah, that's one thing that our gardening, we're getting it, my husband,
he's retired, but he's having trouble now and he's not, not allowed to mow the
grass,

B.181:  Huh.  

A.182:  we have a lot of grass, takes me about four hours,

B.183:  Oh, you have to do it,

A.184:  to do our lawn.

B.185:  oh, gosh.  

A.186:  And, uh, and, you know, he's, really shouldn't run the ((roots or)),

B.187:  Um.

A.188:  and things like that, so it makes it a little bit difficult, but I, I do
love to garden.  My kids loved it because I never allowed anybody in my garden
that didn't like to do it. I didn't want anybody in my garden, I was a grump
[laughter].

B.189:  Do you garden vegetables or flowers or both or,

A.190:  Yeah, mostly vegetables,

B.191:  {Very faint} mostly vegetables?

A.192:  I had, grew some flowers, mostly vegetables. 

B.193:  Yeah, there's nothing like fresh vegetables picked out of the garden.
Well, it's been nice talking to you.

A.194:  Yes, well, I hope you have a nice,

B.195:  Well, you too.

A.196:  birthday today,

B.197:  Uh-huh. 

A.198:  for your son. 

B.199:  Well, he's ((actually not simply)) having his party until Friday but,

A.200:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  Uh-huh.

B.201:  he knows to-, today after the little (( )) today,

A.202:  Uh-huh.

B.203:  because he knows it's his birthday to make it special but,

A.204:  Uh-huh.  Yeah {very faint}, yeah.

B.205:  Well, you have a nice day.

A.206:  Okay, you too, 

B.207:  Okay.

A.208:  and thanks a lot. 

B.209:  Bye-bye.
