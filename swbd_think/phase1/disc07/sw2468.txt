REMARKS:        Speaker A talks quite loudly and at times seems to be too
close to the microphone makes it difficult to understand him.  When
Speaker B alone, Speaker A is as loud, so have difficulty understanding
all that Speaker B said.  Speaker B sounds sometimes like breathing into 
the phone.

========================================================================

A.1:  That was twenty minutes [laughter].

B.2:  Twenty minutes.

A.3:  I thought they gave up after a little while, but I'm sure glad you were
home.  I think we're going to discuss why we think so few people vote in
national elections and even fewer in local elections.

B.4:  That's it.

A.5:  And that's what we're going to talk about.  Okay, and, uh.  Uh, where do
you work, Karen?

B.6:  I don't work [laughter].

A.7:  Oh, okay. 

B.8:  Nope, I'm just one of those housewives.

A.9:  How'd you get in the program.  

B.10:  My husband and my father both work at T I in Sherman.  So,

A.11:  Oh, that's neat, they both work in Sherman.  Yeah, I work in T I in Dallas
here.  How many calls have you been in on this year?

B.12:  Oh, goodness [breathing].  Oh, I, I can't really say,

A.13:  I don't know, I, I, 

B.14:  I haven't listed them or anything.

A.15:  I hope the computer keeping track of them, because I'm not.

B.16:  Yeah, I've enjoyed them,

A.17:  Oh, I do too --

B.18:  so it really (( ))

A.19:  -- I, I just really, I, I, I try to get in one a night.  Somebody doesn't
call me, I call somebody.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Okay, you, you about ready.

B.22:  Okay.

A.23:  Okay.

B.24:  By the way, you don't sound like you're from Dallas, that's why I didn't
think,

A.25:  Huh.

B.26:  You don't sound, you sound like you're from the north, that's why I didn't
think you (( )).

A.27:  It's funny you should say something like that because I'm from Dallas for
thirty-two years.

B.28:  Oh, really.

A.29:  I was from New England originally.

B.30:  Well that's why I picked it up.

A.31:  But I don't have a New England accent.

B.32:  Yes, you have, you have a northern accent.

A.33:  Oh, my parents have a New England accent, but I don't.

B.34:  Well not, I didn't say New England, but I could definitely tell your from
the north.

A.35:  Well, I've, I've been everywhere.  I've lived overseas for T I for ten
years.  Four years in Malaysia, rather seven years, and three years in the
Philippines.  And I lived in Pittsburg before I came here.  I was raised in
New England.  So it's.  But I've been here thirty-two years so I sort of
consider myself a Texas.

B.36:  Yeah, well, you never, I don't think you ever lose that, that which you
begin with.

A.37:  I've got a Texan wife and three Texan children.  

B.38:  [Laughter] You're still (( )).  I myself am a native Texas. 

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  You can never, as a native Texan, you can never become a Texan unless you
were born here.

A.41:  Where, where a native, Karen?

B.42:  Where was I,

A.43:  Yeah, where, what part of Texas?

B.44:  I was born in Dallas,

A.45:  Oh, okay.

B.46:  So I've been, I've been in this area for most all my life.

A.47:  I, I, I ask that because my wife is from the Palestine area in East Texas,
and you can tell she's native, too.

B.48:  Oh, yeah, they have much more of a twang --

A.49:  Right,

B.50:  -- down in that area.

A.51:  Right.  Well I'm going to push one and let them start recording.  Okay?

B.52:  Okay.

@A.53:  [Beep] Okay, Karen, uh, you know it always has amazed me, and in fact I
think I wrote a paper on this in college, uh, that the national elections just
have so few people voting in them, you know, maybe fifty percent or less of
the electorate.  You ever thought much about it?

B.54:  Well, yes, I have.  Um, I was in the military for a while, and it really
bothered me to think that people that are affected so, you know, so closely by
(( )), you know, that it comes so close to home as far as the government, you
know, because they are so directly connected with it, and yet so few of them
were registered to vote.

A.55:  Di-,

B.56:  And, and it really, really used to bother me, and then, and then I'd hear
complaints about this and that that was happening to those of us in the
military, the cuts and things like that, and I would be like, well, are you
registered to vote?  Have you, you know, made any, uh, changes, you know, as
far as your voting habits on, you know, who you're voting for and what you're
looking for?  And, uh, no, they'd say no.  And I'd be, well then shut up, you
know, [laughter] you don't really have much, you don't have much that you can
say.

A.57:  How do you vote, how do you vote in the military?  Do you vote absentee,

B.58:  #Yeah you vote,#

A.59:  #in your own registered state?#

B.60:  absentee, yeah, you vote, you're still connected to your state, legally
you still are responsible for paying those taxes, they withdraw taxes --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- for that state, if, like in Texas we don't --

A.63:  We don't have a state income tax.  Right.

B.64:  -- yeah, but if you are, they withdraw that from your pay, and, uh, you
can be, you can be, uh, have suits brought against you as if you were from
that state --

A.65:  From that state, uh-huh.

B.66:  -- yeah, so you are attached --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- to that state from which you came from.

A.69:  I'm going to inject a little side anecdote for you back to the main topic
here --

B.70:  To voting, uh-huh.

A.71:  -- because it, it, you might be interested in this.  You know, I've, I've,
uh, as I mentioned I've had seven years of expatriate service with T I, and
you vote in the embassy.  Uh, Uh, from whatever country you're in, you go to
the United States embassy and vote there.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  And I was in the Phi-, uh, in Portugal, not stationed there, but I was
there on business and visiting a family that I knew very well.  In fact the
guy had been my boss when we were in Malaysia.  And it was, was with T I.  And
I went to his house for dinner.  And they had a young son who was probably
about in the seventh grade and was attending a British school in, uh, in
Portugal.  And this was in, uh, this was just nineteen eighty-four, just, uh,
prior, maybe in the summer prior to the eighty-four election.  And I went
home for dinner, to dinner with this fellow, and they were Texans, and they
lived there in Portugal.  And his wife said, gee, the darndest thing happened
today.  She said, I'm so embarrassed.  She said, I was over at Reed's school
and Margaret Thatcher came and spoke to the, to the, uh, the parents.  It was
a British school.  So she was there visiting in Portugal, and she visited this
British school and spoke to parents.  And after it was over she said, I went
up to her and I said, Mrs. Thatcher, I'm a great admirer of yours.  And she
said, what I wanted, I've always wanted to meet you, and I've enjoyed this
opportunity to meet you.  And Margaret Thatcher said, Oh, you're an American.
Yes.  She said, Well, something I want to ask you about.  She said, When
you're American and away from home, in an election year like this, how do you
vote?  And my friend said, Oh, if nothing changes I'll vote for Reagan.  And
she said,

B.74:  [Laughter].

A.75:  [Laughter] Oh my goodness, no, I didn't mean that, and poor Janet
realized immediately she didn't mean that, she meant what was the process of
voting.  And Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think she was
going to ask her [laughter] how she was going to vote.

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  And her husband kept looking at her and said, I can't believe you could be
so dumb [laughter].

B.78:  [Laughter].

A.79:  But, uh, I, it's interesting, though, people that do, we've been in
Malaysia during one election year and the Philippines in another, that there
seems to be a higher percent of the expatriate population, I mean well over
fifty percent, that do bother to register with the embassy and go vote.  You'd
almost think, that you think you're more important when you're out of the
country --

B.80:  I think --

A.81:  -- and you're exposed to some things.

B.82:  -- I think sometimes that you, um, you pick, you become more aware of what
you have --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and how important it is to you.  You become more loyal, so to speak --

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  -- to the things that you don't have at that time, and you realize, hey,
my, you know, we really have a good thing there.  So I think you hold more
dear the things like democracy and your rights, you know --

A.87:  Sure.

B.88:  -- as an American citizen.  But I think, uh, the people that I've talked
to, as far as voting, because I've worked, you know, in trying to get people
to vote when I was in the military.  I was a, uh, represented, uh, people as
far as voting.  From what I spoke, speaking with people, it was mainly that,
um, they felt frustrated that their one vote wasn't going to do any good, you
know, that, uh, and, and, it was really hard to get across to them that it
didn't matter, you know, it's a matter of that's your right.  You should go
and do it, you know, and that your one vote can count when you get a whole lot
of peop-, if everybody says, oh, well, my vote doesn't count, you know, then,
then what do you have.

A.89:  That's exactly right.  And they don't realize that it's, it's all onesies,
and the onesies all add up.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  You know, the thing that, that I, surprised me even more, you know, if we
get a good contest going, we do manage to get fifty percent out in national
elections, and, but what's even worse is the off year congressional elections.
Uh, when there's not a presidential election.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  And the local election.  And it bothers me, and I think that's even more
important to vote in those because, uh,

B.94:  Well, you can make a big difference in those.

A.95:  Oh, sure and,

B.96:  And it's more to home a lot of the time.

A.97:  Right, and it's, it's like a school board election.  You know, those of us
with children in school are very concerned --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- about what goes on in the school system.  Yet, school board members are
elected with sometimes ten to fifteen percent of the electorate turning out.

B.100:  Isn't that ridiculous.

A.101:  Yeah.  And, and you know, the one of the things that I can still remember a
college professor standing up pointing his pipe at a class one day while he
was lecturing, and he said, the problem of the vote is that the American
public is sometimes asked to go to the polls too often and to make too many
and too difficult decisions.  And I think of that every time I go find one of
these ballots.  And you not only get it in the presidential year, where you go
down through eight or nine judgeships, [laughter] and, uh, uh,

B.102:  Yeah, but don't you think anyway that's kind of a cop out.  

A.103:  What?

B.104:  I mean, it still is your responsibility,

A.105:  Oh, yeah, it, it still is your responsibility.

B.106:  and, and nowadays they do have more information that you can become aware
of, and there are things like the League of Women Voters or some of the other
groups that, you know, put, give out, uh, nonbiased information --

A.107:  Right.

B.108:  -- just general information on how the candidates stand on certain issues,
that, you know, you can make a decision on how you feel about certain issues
and who you want to represent you, and so I really don't, I don't agree that
you have too many choices, that, you know, it's, it's too hard, and I think
that people are just lazy.

A.109:  I, I, 

B.110:  I think they don't want to get out.

A.111:  I, I think you're right there, and I'm glad you mentioned the League of
Women Voters.  I, I don't know how long they've been around, maybe a long
time, but it's only in my more mature years that I have become aware of them.

B.112:  Oh, really.

A.113:  And, and I make a real effort to go out and read al-, and particularly
read their things about the candidates for lesser offices that you don't, you
--

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- can't read their view in the paper.  

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  And I, I think that is tremendously important ...
