============================================================

A.1:  Uh, so, you have children I take it?

B.2:  [noise] {Sounds like she is cooking, i. e. banging pots, water, etc} No, I
don't.

A.3:  You don't?

B.4:  No, huh-uh.  [laughter]

A.5:  So, it's not a very valid topic.

B.6:  No, it's not.  Do you have children?

A.7:  Uh, yes.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  One.  

B.10:  One.  

A.11:  Stepdaughter.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Ten.

B.14:  Ten.

A.15:  And, uh, [laughter] you know how they are at that age, I guess.

B.16:  [laughter].

A.17:  you having been ten once,

B.18:  [laughter].

A.19:  yourself.

B.20:  Yeah.  Once upon a time I was.  Well, I have two dogs, those are my kids.

A.21:  Oh, we have one.

B.22:  [laughter]  What kind is it?

A.23:  A Keeshonden.

B.24:  Oh, really.

A.25:  Yeah, 

B.26:  #Uh-huh#.

A.27:  #fuzzy# little thing.

B.28:  A what?

A.29:  A fuzzy little dog.

B.30:  Yeah, yeah, they're cute.

A.31:  Rather, rather odd personality, he, he's fun.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Anyway, uh, time we spend with our children.

@B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  {pause} It seems almost as though children hate it.

B.36:  Do they?

A.37:  [laughter]  Yes.

B.38:  [laughter]

A.39:  Time spent with Mom and Dad is, [noise] uh, next, is probably one of the
worst punishments spent on earth to them.

B.40:  Yeah, especially when they get like into the teenage stage.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  I guess.  {pause} [laughter] Yeah, I remember when I was that age.

A.43:  They, you know, parents are a curse that they just have to live with.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  [sniffing]

A.45:  [noise] So, it, it's interesting.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  But we do spend time driving in the mountains, and ...

B.48:  Uh-huh.  Oh, how nice, I would love to live up there.

A.49:  Well.  Do you work for T I?  [noise]

B.50:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.51:  You're working then?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  With every passing day we wonder if we will be.

B.54:  [laughter] That's what I heard.  [noise] {Sounds like running water} I've
always thought about maybe transferring up there, and I thought if I do that,
I might not have a job so [laughter].  [/noise]

A.55:  It's, it's better to be employed.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  I know it.

A.59:  And that creates family tensions.

B.60:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  [sniffing] So, you only have the, you only
have the stepdaughter at home?

A.61:  Yes.

B.62:  You all don't have any other children around there?

A.63:  No, no.

B.64:  [laughter].

A.65:  I don't have any, an-, children.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  So, how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you
all.

A.67:  [laughter] Uh, well it varies what it is, of course, but usually,

B.68:  [sniffing]

A.69:  Mom and Dad are a curse.

B.70:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.71:  You know, they, they'd much rather be with friends, 

B.72:  Oh, #yeah#.

A.73:  #friends# are cool, parents aren't.

B.74:  [laughter]  No, huh-uh.

A.75:  Well, I remember, well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you
know,

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  I, I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad
was, oh, just wonderful, you know, go,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  go hunting, or go to the races, 

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  or, or, oh, any number of things.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  And we'd have, um, great times,

B.84:  Oh, yeah.

A.85:  and it seems that well now the bank's not available.  

B.86:  Yeah.  Um.

A.87:  {pause} And, entirely too much time is spent, my wife and I were wondering
what if,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  {pause} and, and what if's always rough.

B.90:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

A.91:  But, you know, we do have our trips and we do have our fun and,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  [sigh] I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the
same things little boys are or were.

B.94:  [laughter] Like fishing and ...

A.95:  Hunting and, and,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  Looking for arrowheads, and ...

B.98:  [laughter] My husband will say that he'd like to have a little boy to take
hunting and fishing and I said, well, you can take a little girl hunting and
fishing just as easily.

A.99:  Uh, but they don't like it.

B.100:  [laughter]  That's probably right.  [door]

A.101:  There, there, there is a difference there.

B.102:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.103:  And, and ...

B.104:  No, if my Dad had done that when I was a kid I probably wouldn't have liked
it.  I go now, with my husband.  And, I enjoy it, but ...

A.105:  Well, girls at that age,

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  Video games, boys and malls.

B.108:  [laughter] Yeah, yeah.

A.109:  Not necessarily in that order, 

B.110:  [laughter] 

A.111:  and friends of course.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  And, that's a little tough for fathers.  

B.114:  Uh-huh.  I imagine.

A.115:  Fathers don't even like malls, they despise shopping.

B.116:  [laughter] Uh.

A.117:  So, is that quality time?

B.118:  Huh, no, I think not.

A.119:  Yeah, if, but there is camping and we both enjoy that.

B.120:  Uh-huh, she likes to do that?

A.121:  Somewhat, yeah, #yeah#.

B.122:  #Yeah#, yeah.  Well, that's good.

A.123:  Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all and,

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  that's somewhat fun.

B.126:  Uh-huh.  #She# ...

A.127:  #It's#,

B.128:  Huh?

A.129:  so what do you think about child rearing?  Is, how, how would you spend
time with kids?

B.130:  Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and keeping, trying to keep them away from
the T V, I guess [laughter].  And, McDonald's [laughter].

A.131:  Oh, yeah.

B.132:  I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is.
[sniffing]

A.133:  #Yeah, but#

B.134:  #But#, they learn from their friends, don't they?

A.135:  Well, yeah, and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or
something,

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast.

B.140:  Yeah.

A.141:  Breakfast and run.

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,

B.144:  Yeah.  It is.

A.145:  and, uh, kids eat funny.

B.146:  [laughter] This lady in our bass club, we had a tournament yesterday and
she was talking about her daughter, said, one week her daughter will, uh, be
on a no meat kick, and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars, you
know, she just eats weird.

A.147:  And little girls are worse about it than little boys.

B.148:  Yeah, yeah.

A.149:  They ...

B.150:  They're always wanting to go on a diet or something.

A.151:  Or, or something, yeah.

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  Go on a diet or they, they have a, well, [noise] to some extent the
public schools, or the schools in general,

B.154:  Uh-huh.

A.155:  influence them,

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  the eating meat kick.

B.158:  Yeah.

A.159:  You know, like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something,

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  I, I'm not sure.

B.162:  [laughter]

A.163:  Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas.

B.164:  Yeah.  Oh, is that where you're from?

A.165:  Oh, yeah.

B.166:  Uh-huh.

A.167:  Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock.

B.168:  Oh.  Um.

A.169:  So, I understand about bass.

B.170:  Yeah [laughter].  Huh.

A.171:  But it, but it is interesting,

B.172:  Uh-huh.

A.173:  I, I will tell you, yeah.  Every person out there should have kids, at
least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time,

B.174:  [laughter] That's the kind I like.  [laughter]

A.175:  because everyone needs some torture in their lives.

B.176:  [laughter] My Mother used to put that curse on my sister.  I hope you have
kids just like yourself.  [laughter] And, my Grandmother must have put that on
my Dad because he got my sister, she's just like him.

A.177:  Uh.  But, Jenny is a sweet kid.

B.178:  Yeah, I'm sure she is.

A.179:  And, yeah, we do do things,

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  and, it, it's funny, it's almost like a lot of things that were available
to us as children,

B.182:  Uh-huh.

A.183:  to go do,

B.184:  [barking] Uh-huh.

A.185:  The money's not available.

B.186:  [/barking] Uh-huh, I know, I don't know how people can afford kids.
[throat_clearing] #I mean# ...

A.187:  #You know#, we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land.

B.188:  Uh-huh.

A.189:  Golly!  A couple, three hundred dollars.

B.190:  Oh, yeah.

A.191:  You know, for just, for just a day, not in-, you know, a day or two, not
including lodging and food and all that.

B.192:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.193:  It's, I don't see how anyone can afford it.

B.194:  Uh.

A.195:  And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now.

B.196:  It's, uh, I heard it's twenty bucks a whack.  For adults.

A.197:  Oh, yeah.

B.198:  Yeah.  That is awful high.  Oh, well ...

A.199:  Twenty bucks a whack now.

B.200:  Yeah, or twenty-one.

A.201:  But, at least once you pay your way in there,

B.202:  #Yeah, yeah#.

A.203:  #at Six Flags# ...

B.204:  yeah, everything's free except for the food.

A.205:  Yeah, yeah, food and junk to carry out.

B.206:  [laughter]

A.207:  [laughter] So that's, that's not as bad.

B.208:  Yeah. Yeah.

A.209:  But, golly!

B.210:  [laughter]

A.211:  You know, Disney World or Disney Land.

B.212:  Uh-huh.

A.213:  Well, our problem is that, you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World
or, uh, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.

B.214:  [laughter]  Really.

A.215:  Or you'd have to pay air fare,

B.216:  Uh-huh.

A.217:  and, ooh, for a family, you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive
pretty quick.

B.218:  OH, yeah.

A.219:  Rent a car when you get there and all that.  Yeah.

B.220:  That's why I lucked out, my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we
got, you know, our air fare free and we got ... [/noise]
