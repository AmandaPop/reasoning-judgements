the phone was acting up.  

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what kind of car are you thinking about buying next? 

B.2:  Well, what a wh-, what do we currently have, I have a Subaru, uh, G O X T.

A.3:  What year? 

B.4:  Eighty-eight. 

A.5:  Oh, okay.  Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic, and I'm ready to get rid of
it [laughter].  Actually,

B.6:  ((Oh, it's not)) pretty old.

A.7:  No, uh, well, I ha-, I had an eighty-eight that I really liked and it got
wrecked, and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my
eighty-eight and I've had a lot of problems with this one, [laughter] so, 

B.8:  So, you think their quality control's going down over there, ((kind of))?

A.9:  Well, you, it's, it's kind of funny, um, I know a lot,

B.10:  Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality
that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit,

A.11:  Oh. 

B.12:  while American carmakers are trying to get their,

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  put together, so. 

A.15:  It's, it's true, it's definitely true because,  

B.16:  But, but that's one reason I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,
that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh,
for, you know, low maintenance, so.

A.17:  Yeah, well, Honda does too [laughter], that's why I was really,

B.18:  Well, really, there's, there's no question but you have a nineteen, I mean,
((I've got to see if)), I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, uh,
like, uh, eighty-one or eighty, uh, Celicas,

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  and those things just keep ticking. 

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,

A.23:  That's true.  

B.24:  and they're still beating on them,

A.25:  That's true.  

B.26:  and it's just amazing and then they got, and you know they're not making
them like that now, d-, d-, you know,

A.27:  No, 

B.28:  so,  

A.29:  not at all.  

B.30:  but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than
the American carmaker ((system)).

A.31:  Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, [laughter], because I had, uh,
uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda, and it was the worst car I've ever
owned [laughter],

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda it was just a
wonderful car and then it got wrecked and, you know, I wouldn't even look at
another car [laughter],

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look
around or anything I just said that this is what I want, [laughter], and I
really have had a lot of problems with it, [laughter] but I don't know.

B.36:  Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el-, [laughter].

A.37:  [Laughter] Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under
warranty but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an
average of about once a month, [laughter], it was in the shop about twelve
times the first twelve months [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah, that's a lot. 

A.39:  Yeah, it was, I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped
up on Honda, so.

B.40:  Oh, well.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Anyway, so, what's your next purchase supposed to be? 

A.43:  Well, I know this,

B.44:  ((Oh, really)), if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?

A.45:  Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange, [laughter], but I really
like to have a Mazda M P V van, [laughter], I really like those and I have
kids, [laughter] so.

B.46:  I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that. 

A.47:  They're a lot, I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van,

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  and the, the new Chevy Lumina van, 

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I
don't know what you, normal, [laughter], I don't know how to explain, more of
an old fashioned type.  I, I'm not sure how to explain it,

B.52:  Yeah. 

A.53:  I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  ((no, what)) Astro, Astro, I guess,

B.56:  ((Oh, okay, yeah)). 

A.57:  is what it, something like that, but I used to really like the looks of
the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think,

B.58:  Do you have, uh, do you have a family? 

A.59:  Yeah, I have a couple kids [laughter]. 

B.60:  Okay, well, that's probably influenced maybe ((a little bit)).

A.61:  Oh, yeah, [laughter], definitely.  But, I know that it's got to have a
radio, it's got to have air conditioning, [laughter], I'm sure you can, uh,
relate to air conditioning [laughter].

B.62:  Oh, yeah.

A.63:  Um, living in Arizona, but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's
about it, [laughter].  I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I
don't care.

B.64:  Yeah, well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college and, uh, you
know, ((I always been)) looking for something sporty and I ended up getting,
you know, basically something that I could, you know, afford.

A.65:  Uh-huh. 

B.66:  The only gripe I have is performance.  I probably, uh, a few girls that
I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X seven's and stuff and
they're, they're pretty fun to drive, so,

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time
around,

A.69:  Oh, really?  

B.70:  I keep, I keep hold-, holding off and then I could, I could upgrade now
if I wanted to but I just, I, it's just such a huge expense and, and, uh, I,
I'm just going to keep holding off but ((I'm)) definitely going to look for
something, uh, in the, you know, nice, perpor-,

A.71:  Sports car [laughter].  

B.72:  you know,

A.73:  I'd like to have a sports car too, but it's not practical for me,
[laughter] but,

B.74:  Yeah [noise].  I'm in, are you still there? 

A.75:  Yeah.  Whoops.  There's some kind of problems.  Hello,

B.76:  [Noise]  Hello. 

A.77:  are you still there?

B.78:  Okay.

A.79:  This is, something's wrong. 

B.80:  Wonder what happened.

A.81:  I don't know, it sounds funny though, doesn't it? 

B.82:  Huh, anyway,

A.83:  Huh. 

B.84:  um, but I'll probably, um, it just depends, I know that's what I want,
but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money, you're
looking at, you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something, you're
looking at twenty-five K or something,

A.85:  Oh, at least, yeah,

B.86:  {Very faint} that like and so,  

A.87:  I know, 

B.88:  anyway but,  

A.89:  well, new cars aren't cheap anyway, [laughter] but, 

B.90:  Anyway my ultimate car though, the, the one that I really want is, uh, five
sixty or so, Mercedes, so,

A.91:  Huh.  

B.92:  maybe someday [laughter]. 

A.93:  [Laughter] Yeah, we have, we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we?

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  [Laughter] What I'd really like to have [laughter],

B.96:  That's the only one that I, you know, I se-, you know, I see, uh, you know,
early on that, that, that says, [noise], it says, you there?

A.97:  Yeah.  This is strange.   

B.98:  [Noise] Hello. 

A.99:  Hello, I think,

B.100:  Okay. 

A.101:  something's wrong with this.  I hope it's recording [laughter].

B.102:  I hope it's not my (( )), [noise], you there?

A.103:  Yeah [laughter].

B.104:  It may be my phone, um, anyway it's the only car that says, you know,
sporty and class, uh, so,

A.105:  Yeah, you're right [laughter].  Yeah.

B.106:  uh, kind of what I'm, but it's, at the other one my brother's got a Miata
and those are fun.

A.107:  Oh, those are nice,

B.108:  And, uh, i-, 

A.109:  yeah, they're, they're cute cars [laughter]. 

B.110:  Yeah, well, he did, he had a, a red [beep] Miata,

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  and, uh, he actually, they came out with a European racing, green, uh,
Miata that's a limited edition,

A.113:  Oh. 

B.114:  they're only going to make like three or four thousand.  So, he went out
and he traded the other one in and got this one,

A.115:  Wow, I haven't seen those.  

B.116:  ((and I'm like, um)), but, uh, I haven't seen one ((yet)) either but
supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this
and the steering wheel,

A.117:  Wow.  

B.118:  so, it's, it's very authentic and there only is supposed to be limited
edition so it may be, may be a good investment.  If it,

A.119:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a
limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.

B.122:  Uh-huh.  But, uh, I think [noise] hello,

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  okay, yeah, I got off my pace or my cordless phone,

A.125:  Oh. 

B.126:  anyway, uh, hope it's not going bad, {very faint}, it's going to ((bump))
me out.  Um, but he, I think he, he only spent, you know, the low twenty's so,

A.127:  Really?  

B.128:  I don't know. 

A.129:  Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be
a lot more than that [laughter] for something that's limited edition.

B.130:  Well, I don't know, I think the demands gone all, down a little bit.  I
think you can, the prices aren't as high, you know, and the, the mu-, Miata
was first introduced, uh,

A.131:  And, ((well)), they weren't really that bad though when they were
introduced were they?

B.132:  Wh-, yeah, the demand is so, high that, uh, you know, they were going to
retail them around like thir-, you know, thirteen standard, you know, and you
get your options,

A.133:  Yeah. 

B.134:  your looking at fifteen or si-,

A.135:  That's true.  

B.136:  fifteen but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen
and twenty,

A.137:  Uh-huh.  

B.138:  and, um, 

A.139:  Huh.

B.140:  they, they may have gone down a little bit but I, they're still pretty
much in demand.  I think there's another car coming in, it's supposed to come
out and compete with that Miata,

A.141:  Huh.

B.142:  and I can't remember what I read about that but so, that's (( )), I mean,
I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very
popular, so.

A.143:  Yeah, it really is.  

B.144:  But,

A.145:  Have you seen the new, uh, Dodge Stealth? 

B.146:  Oh, yeah.

A.147:  The, the,

B.148:  yeah, #and the Mitsubishi,# 

A.149:  #real nice one# [laughter].  

B.150:  three thousand ((G T)),

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  is the same, same. 

A.153:  Yeah, the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too,

B.154:  Yeah, well, that's, that's, 

A.155:  now those are nice [laughter].  

B.156:  that's the same manufacturer and st-,

A.157:  Right.  

B.158:  ((so)), they just market them. 

A.159:  Right.

B.160:  But, uh, yeah, those are and those are supposed to be very performance
power, I mean, they're,

A.161:  The expensive ones, 

B.162:  there is, yeah, big time. 

A.163:  they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen
thousand, but those are pretty stripped, and there's nothing, there's really,
that one's just more for looks, you know, it doesn't have any, really the
performance that the expensive one does.

B.164:  Yeah.

A.165:  You know, but I've seen one of those, and it's not that great, I mean,
because they really,

B.166:  I think the-, they're only around, uh, twenty-nine K.

A.167:  Yeah, the-, like, I mean they have, um, ((better)), it's not quite as nice
for a little bit less.

B.168:  Yeah.

A.169:  Yeah, they're not really that bad but I don't know, [laughter] like I said
it's, it's still not practical for me [laughter].  I have a hard time looking
at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that
[laughter].

B.170:  Yeah, I'm being single and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess,
you know, it's, I can,

A.171:  Right.  

B.172:  I can, I've been pretty happy, I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade
myself right now, that's, uh, you know, I could, I could have, you know, get
something nice and upgrade but I just, uh, I'm consulting right now, so,

A.173:  Oh, really?  

B.174:  I just made my first job ((hop)) about eight months ago, so.

@@A.175:  uh ...
