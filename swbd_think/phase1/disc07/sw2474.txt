============================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] {Sounds like T V or stereo} Well, what's the weather like where you
are? [laughter].

B.2:  Uh, well, let's see, it's been cloudy today. 

A.3:  And rainy, #have you had# --

B.4:  #And,#

A.5:  -- any rain?

B.6:  No, not very much.  We've had a little bit of sprinkles, but for the most
part it's, uh, pretty dry out there.  We didn't have a whole lot, we just get
a little bit, a lot of dew this morning.

A.7:  Well, we've had some rain.  We've had some, I live in Oak Cliff, so --

B.8:  #Oh, okay.#

A.9:  -- #we've have a little# bit of rain, but, uh, [lipsmack] I don't know, it
seems to be warmer this year.

B.10:  Yeah, yeah, it definitely is warmer.  And then there's a lot of difference
between the Plano weather and the, uh, Dallas weather.

A.11:  Is there really?

B.12:  Uh-huh, yeah, there's a, there's like a five degree difference between like
if you leave T I, the Central Expressway site,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  and you go north at about the Richardson, Plano border there's a distinct
change in the, it's usually about five degrees cooler.

A.15:  It's cooler in Plano?

B.16:  Uh-huh, about five degrees usually most of the time you can definitely tell
a pronounced difference.

A.17:  I'll be darn.  You wouldn't think that close --

B.18:  #No.#

A.19:  -- #that# it would be different.

B.20:  The only thing I figure is that maybe it's because, 

A.21:  [Noise].

B.22:  there is more concrete that absorbs heat and things like that.

A.23:  Yeah, down here.

B.24:  And, down there, there's a lot more, uh, natural stuff like, you know,
trees and parks and things like that up here, and everything but --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- there is a difference.  Uh, when I used to drive a convertible all the
time I'd have the top down and maybe it was sixty in Dallas and then I'd drive
up in Plano and it would be like, uh, gosh, I'm cold, you know [laughter].

A.27:  I'll be darn.

B.28:  Turn the heat on or something [laughter].

A.29:  I never realized that.

B.30:  #Yeah.#

A.31:  #I know# that when I lived in Little M, up even further north, towards
Denton, that, uh, we got more, we got more severe storms it seemed like than
Dallas did.

B.32:  #Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.#

A.33:  #More severe weather.# So I figure it's because I was closer to Oklahoma
and I think when it snowed we got more snow up there too.

B.34:  Right, right --

A.35:  You know,

B.36:  -- probably more rain and everything --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- because I think you get, you would get hit more by, it was more like
West, right, of Dallas?

A.39:  It's north of Dallas.

B.40:  Just straight north.

A.41:  (( )) Where I am now?

B.42:  No, Little M.

A.43:  That's north, north. #Yeah.#

B.44:  #Okay, north,# north, okay.  Yeah, there, I know most of the stuff seems to
kind of peter out before it really gets into Dallas and a lot of it just kind
of phases away, #you know.#

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  A lot of times you'll hear it's real bad over in, uh, Fort Worth too.

A.47:  Yeah.  I've noticed that.  We need the rain so bad.

B.48:  Yeah, me too.  I've planted a bunch of roses outside --

A.49:  Oh!

B.50:  -- and so, I'd like to, I'd like to get the rain because I'm getting tired
of watering [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter] I love roses.  I only have one rose bush.  I lost one last year.

B.52:  #Oh really?#

A.53:  #I had two# and now I'm down to one.  And, I've cut it back this year and
it's, oh, it's blooming so pretty now.

B.54:  Is it really?  What kind is it?

A.55:  Oh, brother.  It's a, (( )) it's, gosh it's eleven years old, it's pink.  I
can tell you that, great big roses, but, but I can't think of the name of it.

B.56:  Um.

A.57:  I think the name might still be on it, down at the bottom somewhere, but I
can't think of what it is.

B.58:  Oh, the little metal tag, and everything?

A.59:  Yeah.  But, uh, [noise] oh, I just love it, and, I pick them and bring them
in.  I just love roses.

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we planted something like thirty of them --

A.61:  Oh!

B.62:  -- this year [laughter].

A.63:  You're kidding.

B.64:  No, no, um --

A.65:  #Oh, how wonderful.#

B.66:  -- #they're all growing# and, I've got buds on quite a few of them so I'm
hoping that in about another week or two I'll have lots of blooms.

A.67:  Oh, are you going to put them in the house.  Do you like to,

B.68:  I'm going to, I'm going to put some in the house, but I'm going to bring a
lot of them into work, because, hey, you spend a lot of time at work and so
#that's# --

A.69:  #Yeah.#

B.70:  -- the place where you kind of like them but. oh, yeah, I love them and
then just, I'm on a test, a rose test panel this year for a national company.
And, uh, they send you roses that #only have numbers# --

A.71:  #Oh!#

B.72:  -- no names.  They're brand new hybrids and they send them to you and you,
you know, it's like, well, what do you think of the rose?  Do you like the
leaves, #do you like this# --

A.73:  #Oh!#

B.74:  -- and,

A.75:  How did you get on that?

B.76:  Well, I go through a, I get a lot, a lot of advertising and stuff from
Jackson and Perkins Roses, that's who does this.  And, um, I go ahead and they
send me some. Well, this year they sent me the test panel thing,

A.77:  [Lipsmack].

B.78:  because I always get a lot of roses from them.

A.79:  Oh, my gosh [noise].

B.80:  And, so, they sent it to me and, and I said, oh, yeah, that will be cool.
One of them, there's four that they send, and I've got one that's going to be
pink, one that's going to be white, no, I take it back, one that's going to be
yellow. Uh, one that's going to be red and white, [lipsmack] --

A.81:  Oh!

B.82:  -- and, one that's going to be pink and white.  So,

A.83:  Oh, my gosh.

B.84:  I'm anxious to see what they look like, because that's all they tell you,
they just say well, they're supposed to be these colors.  They don't tell you
which ones are supposed to be which.  So, I've got these planted out there
that have numbers and I've got the little form I'm supposed to fill out and
write all my opinions and stuff on it.  And, so, it's just, this is before
they even are named, like, you know, you,

A.85:  [Noise].

B.86:  can suggest names for them because of what you think and things like that.
And then they, um, you know, then they let, you know you write in and they let
you know later on what the general results are throughout the United States.

A.87:  Well, that is really neat.  I'd enjoy doing something like that.  You must
have a big yard though to be able to put,

B.88:  Oh, no, we have a tiny yard [laughter].

A.89:  [Laughter] Gosh, oh, but it's going to be gorgeous.

B.90:  Oh it's going to be re-, it's going to be really neat.

A.91:  [Noise] {Sounds like running water}.

B.92:  It really is, and so, I'm really excited about it because it's, we have the
bed for them, we dug up the soil, I mean we the took the soil up and, like two
feet by two feet down.  And, you know, the bed's pretty big --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- especially the long one that has, that has all the regular roses in it.
It's real big.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  It stands about forty feet, on one side of, of our fence.  But, we have the
perfect yard for it because the sun comes up in the morning and strikes the
back yard all morning until, you know, about --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- about two o'clock in the afternoon.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  #So, we get,#

A.101:  #Do you get# the afternoon sun in the front?

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  You're facing the same way I am.

B.104:  Oh, really?

A.105:  Yeah.  I get the morning sun on the backside, in the back yard, and on the
kitchen, and all, and then it comes right over and hits my front in the
afternoon --

B.106:  Right,

A.107:  -- #and then I get the,# 

B.108:  #it bakes the front# yard [laughter].

A.109:  Yeah.  I get, uh, front.

B.110:  So, is your, is, uh, so is your front like facing kind of north too, like
northwest?

A.111:  It's just facing due west.

B.112:  Just due west.  Because see, we get the afternoon sun, the, the front of
our house also gets hit, blasted by the north wind, so the front, so the front
of our house is kind of, angled kind of strange, I mean we're facing kind 
of --

A.113:  #Northwest.#

B.114:  -- #like north,# northwest and so the back is, is like southeast and so, we
get, we get, really horrendous weather in the front of our house --

A.115:  I'll be darned.

B.116:  -- you know, because we get, you've got to have something out there that
can protect itself from the north, because the cold hits us, and then it bakes
us in the summer.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  And, the backyard is great, because we get all the southerly winds back
there and so they're not blowing as hard and, uh, then we get the eastern sun.
So, the backyard's great for growing stuff.

A.119:  Yeah.  I do pretty good in the front.  They can take, well I have a big
tree, I planted a big tree about ten years ago in my front yard.  It was a
fruitless mulberry, and it can, it takes that sun, and then it shades my front
window, because I have a big picture window --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- and boy, before we had that big tree in the front yard, that sun would
just, in the #summer time# --

B.122:  #Oh yeah.#

A.123:  -- it was just horrible, but now it's not too bad at all.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  So I, but I have to get plants that can take the sun in the front, but my
rose bush is in the front, it does great.

B.126:  Well, they can take, they can take a lot of heat and a lot of sun.  The red
ones don't tend to do as well, the blooms out, like in extreme heat because
they tend to turn black.

A.127:  Oh, okay, I'll have to remember that.

B.128:  So, if, if you're looking, you know, plant [noise] some of your, uh, your
pinks and your yellows tend to do really good in extreme fertilizer --

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  -- whereas, your whites and your reds tend to do better like, say with an
eastern exposure, so they don't bake as much.

A.131:  Oh.

B.132:  So, that's a little something, I've been doing a lot of research and a lot
of reading, because I, I like to grow, I like to grow the roses outside and
then I grow African Violets inside.

A.133:  Oh!  Oh, yeah.  I have a couple of African Violets too.

B.134:  Oh, really.

A.135:  It's, just stuff them in the kitchen window and forgot about them.  I've
had them like, I bet you, I've had them like eight years now and they bloom
and bloom and bloom and bloom and bloom.  And, I even forget sometimes to
water those silly things.  And, I just throw water, I don't do anything else
to them.  I don't take care of them [laughter] --

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  -- and, they just bloom like crazy.

B.138:  That's all, all I do is I water mine once a week and they are kind of like
succulents, so if you kind of forget to water them a little bit sometimes
they'll be okay.  But, the problem, I think, most people have with African
Violets is that they water them too much and, uh, they are susceptible to
rotting and so, when there is too much water, they die.

A.139:  #Oh.#

B.140:  #That's,# that's what really kills them, if there's too much water.

A.141:  Oh!  Well, I guess I'm doing the right thing then [laughter].

B.142:  Yes.  Well when the leaves get sort of, when they're not real stiff 
anymore --

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  -- then they really need water.

A.145:  [Laughter].

B.146:  I mean, you know, I've used up all my water give me some, that type of
thing,

A.147:  Yeah.

B.148:  But, uh, yeah, that's something, you know, I have lots of, lots of babies,
lot of little baby African Violets and stuff, because I break off a leaf and I
start them off a leaf and stuff.

A.149:  I didn't know you could do that.

B.150:  Oh, yeah, yeah, and they're, they're, just stick them in some soil and you
kind of cover it up with a plastic bag or something with little holes in it,
because it creates a kind of a little greenhouse when you do that.

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  And, it keeps the humidity high, and after about three or four weeks it's
already established a root system, and you can take the little bag off and
then just keep watering it and then after about, about eight weeks after you
take off the plastic bag, you'll see leaves coming out and, uh --

A.153:  Uh!

B.154:  -- it'll, it'll grow leaves and you've got, sometimes you've got more than
one plant, you'll have several plants that will form off of that one leaf.

A.155:  I'll be darn, I'm going to try that.

B.156:  Yeah, it works great, you know, I've got, and my problem is I've got more
than I know what to do with [laughter]. 

A.157:  [Laughter].

B.158:  I've got so many different varieties and stuff, but I mean I've got, I've
got them all in my eastern and I have one western window that I use.  And, I
use that for my babies, and they do okay there, but if I take a plant that is
already established and I stick it in that western window, it, it causes a lot
of problems with it, but the babies do fine.

A.159:  I wonder [/noise] {Sounds like T V or Stereo} {Voices fade} ...
