REMARKS:        Speaker B tended to slur his words making it difficult to
understand exactly what he had said.  

==========================================================================

@B.1:  Okay, we're talking about, uh, car repair.  The last car repair I had done
on mine was last February, it was, uh, uh, (( )) my car was inspected and then
they said that the brakes weren't adjusted properly and I had to go have it,
uh, adjusted, and it turned out that they needed repair and it cost like three
hundred dollars. To have that,

A.2:  The brakes? 

B.3:  yeah, for the brakes. 

A.4:  What, uh, what did you have to have done to the, with the brakes?

B.5:  Oh, I don't know, they ha-, they had a whole list of things, you know, you
need to have this turned and that, you know, refinished I don't know, I don't
understand the whole process, my, personally which is one reason why I don't
trust the auto repairmen, I guess.  Uh, these car (( )) places but, uh, I hate
to take it anytime because I know they're going, you know, say, oh, you need
this, you need that and everything else in the book.  Uh, so, I don't know ((
)) I haven't had a terribly good experience ((a lot of times)) with car repair
places.  Uh, years ago when I was living in California I went to, my, my, my
clutch cable had popped on my car, the clutch had broken or something I don't
know what was wrong.  So, I took it to, uh, uh, transmission shop, uh,
nationally recognized name, and, uh, they had said, uh, well, they, he called
me back that afternoon and they said, oh, yeah, you need this, you need that,
your transmission's faulty and all this and it was like, you know, six hundred
dollars.

A.6:  Jeez. 

B.7:  And I said wait the car's not worth that much, it's, it's, uh, an eight
year old car and it's not worth that much, uh, old ((just have to do later)) I
said, I don't, don't do anything with it because I'm, I'm not worth that much
money on it and I went there after work, my wife and I went there after work
and, uh, they had the whole thing down and taken apart.

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  So, I told the guy I said, you know, I didn't authorize this, I said you
put it back together, I'm taking it home.  And the guy said, well, it will
have to be another day before we get it put back together [laughter].  I
started to go get a lawyer,

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  you know, because I didn't authorize anything and, so, he went and got his
manager and the manager came out and says, I'll give you the parts at cost,
I'll give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so, for two hundred fifty
dollars we'll do it all for you.

A.12:  Oh, really? 

B.13:  Yeah, so, I thought, well, he'll meet me halfway, I'll meet him halfway,
so, it, all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars, but still,
you know, the element of trust was gone at that point.

A.14:  Yeah, that's their way of capturing your pocketbook, I guess, for those who
are least suspecting, a lot of regards, I mean, uh, actually you probably had
a better deal that way.

B.15:  Yeah, it was I'm sure it was.  So, I got my, uh, transmission fixed (( ))
all my clutch, um, just the other day my clutch cable had, had popped again
and, uh, last year I, I took it, my car to a friend of mine to have the oil
changed, he worked at a, at a car lube place.  And, uh, I asked him if he
could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it
and said sure, he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and
pulled the clip out that was (( )) attached to it and put it back further on,
on the cable, well, it was fine.  So, I watched real carefully and, and then
my clutch cable broke, uh, I went and, uh, I got a new, uh, clip that I had
with me, I bought an extra one, and I just went there and replaced it and was
back moving again within three minutes and,

A.16:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.17:  there I was stuck on the road, right in the middle of traffic, but I
managed to get it going again relatively quickly because I knew I watched what
he did and (( )) really fast.  And, you know, I just, figured that if I'd
taken it someplace they would have said, oh, you need a new clutch cable and
this and that and, you know, two hundred fifty dollars later there it is, you
know.

A.18:  Gee.

B.19:  I don't know, I don't have much trust in those people but how about your
experiences?

A.20:  Well, I generally try to find my own personal car mechanics.

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  Uh, rather than taking it to a shop, I'm kind of like you it's, uh, I kind
of equate them with some bad dentists.

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  Who try to find problems in your teeth which I have had that experience.

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  And, um, that's a different subject, so, I better stay on cars [laughter].

B.27:  [Laughter]. 

A.28:  But the last problem I had with my vehicle was a, uh, fuel pump that needed
replacing, and that's all the major problems I've had for a vehicle that's got
eighty-nine thousand miles.

B.29:  What kind of car you got? 

A.30:  It's a Nissan. 

B.31:  Okay, th-, that explains it, yeah, I've got an American made car
[laughter].

A.32:  Yeah. yeah, that's been very good to me I've, I'm going to, uh, I would,
eventually like to get into an American car, but, right now this one's doing
fine for me.

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  But then the other problem too, is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and
I've had to replace a set of tires a couple times but that was due to quirks.
Uh, if you ever have a flat tire,

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  don't ever have it plugged, have a patch put on it. 

B.37:  Okay.  

A.38:  Because those plugs wear, eventually will wear out all four of your tires.

B.39:  Oh, is that right? 

A.40:  Yeah, because it causes an unevenness in the rubber and, uh, that happened
to me twice before I caught on well enough to wh-, what happened,

B.41:  Huh.  

A.42:  I had one tire, uh, plugged after a flat and somehow the unevenness of the
plug just caused al-, all the other three tires to wear out.

B.43:  Huh, that's odd.  That's good to know though. 

A.44:  So, always have a patch put on.  It's, it's happened to me twice and that's
enough.

B.45:  Yeah, it is, [laughter] that's more than enough.  Well,

A.46:  Other than that, that's the major problems I've had, I used to change my
own oil and filter but I got tired of that, so, I let somebody else do it
[laughter].

B.47:  Yeah, I do that myself.  I mean, I, I take it for (( )) for, for eighteen
dollars they'll mess with the oil and they'll mess with getting the things off
and all that, you know, and it's just, it probably costs me at least six,
seven, eight dollars to do it myself ((I figure)) for an extra ten dollars let
them take care of it.

A.48:  Yeah. you're, you're saving about, uh, ten bucks by doing it yourself, but
what the heck, if you can afford it.

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  Um, I'd rather change it myself but I don't have the facilities well enough
all the time.

B.51:  Yeah, that's right. 

A.52:  So, that's the only major problems you've had then? 

B.53:  Who me? 

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  Oh, my clutch has gotten out a couple times and, uh,

A.56:  What kind of vehicle? 

B.57:  A Chevette. 

A.58:  Chevette?  Yeah.

B.59:  Yeah. let's see what else have I had done, uh, one day I was driving with
my Dad and the, uh, he was driving in fact, and the, uh, uh, stick shift came
out in his hand, (( )) driving down the road [laughter].

A.60:  Gee, whiz. 

B.61:  It just totally disengaged itself and, you know, of course, then we had no
way of, of doing anything at that point.  We had to tow it home, and, uh, and
all that and it was like good grief, and the car was new at that point it was
only like a year or so old,

A.62:  Uh-huh.  

B.63:  uh, and, uh, other things were going out on it, you know, and these repair
people say, oh, you need, need, your, your, your, your this and your that's
gone out and it's like good grief, I don't even know what they do,

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  so, how am I suppose to trust them, I don't know.

A.66:  Yeah, the only thing you can do is somehow through your own network and the
friends, find, uh, mechanic through them.

B.67:  Yeah, that's all I can do.

A.68:  That they trust, and, and then I'm sure that, that mechanic's not going to,
uh, do you in, through their recommendation.

B.69:  Yeah. I was, uh, I had my car taken in, uh, to have the oil changed at the,
the place across from the T I plant in Lewisville and, uh, they told me, ((he
says)), oh, your, your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone, uh,
it be like fifty dollars, so, I thought, is that right, I don't remember that
having seen that, they're that bad, so, I took it to a friend of mine's house
and he looked at them, he took the belts off and looked at them and he says,
no, they're not cracked or anything, they're, they're, they're in pretty good
condition, all I had to do is tighten them a little bit, they need little bit
of tightening.

A.70:  Now what was it? 

B.71:  It was some belts. 

A.72:  The belts? 

B.73:  That needed to be tightened. 

A.74:  Uh-huh. 

B.75:  They, you know, they were kind of loose and so, but these people were
telling me that they needed to be replaced.

A.76:  Uh-huh. 

B.77:  So,  

A.78:  Yeah. I, I know this guy that's a car mechanic and he told me, I told him
my belts are slipping a little bit and he said they'll last forever, all you
got to do is just tighten them.

B.79:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, (( )) taking his car in to be worked on and they did
something with the belts and they, when they took the old belt off, they cut
it,

A.80:  Uh-huh.  

B.81:  and ((looks)) like it's a standard deal, easiest way to get it off and, uh,
they just let it hang,

A.82:  Uh-huh, {very faint}.

B.83:  where it was, basically, instead of just taking it off and throwing it
away.  And when he got home he noticed some strange sounds, (( )) opened it up
and looked in there and there was the old belt wrapped around one of the, uh,
axle things in there.

A.84:  Uh-huh.  

B.85:  (( )) took him a half-hour to cut it off, (( )) it totally engaged itself
around the thing.  And boy was he, he, boy was he irate.

A.86:  Huh. 

B.87:  ((Which)) I don't blame him, you know, he'll, I think he went back and
showed it to them and really chewed them out for it ((because)) there's no
excuse for that, you know.

A.88:  Uh-huh. 

B.89:  If your going to cut it off, just grab it, take it, throw it away, it's
simple.

A.90:  Uh-huh. 

B.91:  Oh, well, that's all I got to say.

A.92:  Yeah, uh, I don't have that much problems, so, with my vehicle, knock on
wood.

B.93:  Yeah. 

A.94:  [Throat_clearing] Excuse me.  I just remember a seventy-nine Chevy Nova
that I once had, never again.

B.95:  Yeah.

A.96:  That was a definite lemon. 

B.97:  Yeah, that's what year mine is so ((that's a promise)) (( )).

A.98:  Oh, I got rid of that one after it cost me megabucks. 

B.99:  Mi-, mine's still running it's twelve years old and it's got, uh,
seventy-two thousand miles on it now so,

A.100:  It's not bad. 

B.101:  No.  Not that much.
