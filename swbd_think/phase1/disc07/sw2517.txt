============================================================================

A.1:  So, you have three cats? 

B.2:  Three cats.  

A.3:  What type? 

B.4:  Uh, I have a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian. 

A.5:  Okay, I'm trying to, I don't know the first two. 

B.6:  A Bombay looks, uh, I guess the closest thing to describe it to, is you
have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats?

A.7:  Yeah.  Of course. 

B.8:  That's, that's what a Bombay looks like. 

A.9:  That's the ones that always look like they are sort of scary.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Okay. 

B.12:  Yeah, that's what a Bombay looks like, especially when they get skinny.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  Because they. 

A.15:  Is yours skinny or is it a tubby one? 

B.16:  Yeah, she's really skinny, she's as a matter of fact, she's down at the vet
today.  She'd her little operation.

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  So, uh, 

A.19:  And so she's young? 

B.20:  Yeah, she's fairly young we, we've bred her once. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  And, and that's all we're going to breed her.   So, uh. 

A.23:  And how did the kittens come out? 

B.24:  Oh, they're beautiful.

A.25:  Are you keeping them? Sold them all.

B.26:  Sold, sold them all [laughter]. Yeah, she was going into heat again and,
uh, she, she hasn't been eating, and just, you, you can't put up with that
moaning very long.

A.27:  Uh. 

B.28:  It's awful.

A.29:  Oh, I guess, I've never been around a cat when it was in heat.

B.30:  [Groan] Well, you don't know what you're missing.  

A.31:  [Laughter] I'll probably be happy about it. 

B.32:  Yeah.  Uh, my little prize is the little Himalayan Persian. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  It's, uh, you know what a Himmy, a Himmy is? 

A.35:  Well, a friend of mine, I, I don't remember what types they have but they
are really really fuzzy?

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  Yeah, I think she has a Himalayan, but I'm not sure. 

B.38:  Yeah, usually they are called Himalayan, this one goes more appropriately
by Himalayan Persian, because it doesn't have the coloration that a, what
people think of Himmys.  They are usually more white with a little black. They
look like, they look like off color Persians.

A.39:  Okay. 

B.40:  But, this one is almost all black.  She's black and chocolate and silver.

A.41:  Hm, she sounds really pretty. 

B.42:  She is, she, she's gorgeous. 

A.43:  How old is she? 

B.44:  She is four months old. 

A.45:  Well, she's just a tiny little thing.  They are adorable at that age too.

B.46:  Five and a half pounds. 

A.47:  Wow. 

B.48:  She's laying right in front of my keyboard here on the desk right now.

A.49:  Does she like to sit on top of whatever you are reading and things like
that?

B.50:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I was in there trying to do some studying this afternoon,
and laying down on the sofa and she gets up on my chest where I can't see the
book [laughter].  And then if I am in here on the computer she has to get up
on the desk.

A.51:  Not on the keyboard?  My friend's cat,

B.52:  Oh, yes, she likes,

A.53:  gets on the keyboard, you know.  

B.54:  she likes to type too. 

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  It's even fun when I am on Comp U Serve, and I keep getting all these odd
key strokes up there.

A.57:  That come from her? 

B.58:  Yes, but she's a sweetheart.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up, go
back to sleep.

A.59:  [Laughter] More peaceful. 

B.60:  Put more, yeah, put more cat hair in my disc drive. 

A.61:  [Laughter] My, uh, one set of friends has four cats and let's see, these
four cats, two of them are sort of strays, I guess.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  Then the other two, one of which I thought was a Himalayan and the other
one I'm not sure, but they are both so cute and they are like big fuzz balls.

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  And they're almost more like dogs, one's name is Malcolm, and he sort of
follows you from room to room.

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  Wherever you go and things like that.  So it's, really, really cute.

B.68:  Oh, I love cats.  I don't know.  Most people, a lot of people don't like
cats but,

A.69:  I didn't until I watched my friend's cats.  I watched a different friends
two cats. One of them is really old, the other one also had been like a stray,
but he's huge and we think part Angora, he, he's black.

B.70:  Angora? 

A.71:  Could that be?  I don't.  

B.72:  Yeah, long hair? 

A.73:  Longhaired, yeah.  

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  And. 

B.76:  Probably Angora, there, they're large cat.

A.77:  Yeah, he was a real wild one. 

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  And, uh, but he was fun, one time I was cooking chicken and I, make, taken
all the chicken breasts off the bones and I had this whole stack of nice
chicken breasts left, and he jumped from the floor probably about four
and-a-half feet high and grabbed one of them off and devoured it, before I
could get near him.

B.80:  Yeah, that sounds like Kitty Cat, our, our Bombay.  She's, very athletic,
uh, being tall and skinny, she can do all kinds of things, she's very
versatile with her paws.  She's almost like a monkey.  She even eats with her
paws.

A.81:  Really, wow. 

B.82:  Yeah, she'll, she'll even dip her food or her paw down into the food and
scoop up some and eat it from her paw.

A.83:  Have you ever taken videos of her or something? That would be fun.

B.84:  No, we're going to, we're going to catch her doing some, some of the
funnier things and she's also a retriever.  The only thing she likes to play
with is crumpled cigarette packs.  So I crumble up a cigarette pack and I
throw it and she'll go get it and bring it back to me, it's just like having a
dog.

A.85:  Huh.

B.86:  She loves to play fetch and it doesn't matter where I throw it, she can get
it.  I've, I've thrown it under, under the refrigerator and she'll get down
there and stick that long skinny paw in there.

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  She's very versatile. 

A.89:  Maybe she likes the smell of it. 

B.90:  I don't know, I think she just likes the noise.  Because if I want, if I
want to find her anywhere in the house all I have to do is crumble a package
and she will come running.

A.91:  That's amazing, that's really cute. 

B.92:  Yeah, yeah, she's, she's sort of a weird one.  Why don't you go back to
sleep?  She's playing now.

A.93:  Now, maybe she will type something that you need for you, and then you will
be in good shape, like the paper.

B.94:  No, now, now she's just rearranging all my papers for me. 

A.95:  Oh.

B.96:  She's playing with the pins, uh-huh.  Why don't you play with the keyboard?

A.97:  When I had, uh, cats at my place as soon as I took out the newspaper to
read it, they would plop right down on top of it.

B.98:  Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. 

A.99:  And just not move and just stay there forever. 

B.100:  Well, Sheba, Sheba, the Himmy loves to play with the paper.  She, uh, she
gets, she likes to crawl inside of it, she thinks she's hiding and nobody can
see her and she will jump all over it and tear it to shreds.  She's something,
she, she's a stubby little thing, she's big for her age.  She got little short
legs and great big paws.

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  And she's not, she's not athletic like Kitty Cat I mean the two of them,
these two are the favorite playmates.  The Turkish Van sort of sits off by
itself.

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  But, they love to play and, uh, Sheba has the weight advantage, because
she's heavier.  When I first got her, I mean, Sheba was just a little tiny
thing, got her at ten weeks and, and Kitty Cat took it upon herself to train
her.  And she, and Kitty Cat would jump all over her and beat her up and all
you account hear is Sheba you, know, [meow] all the time.  Well, now she's
bigger than Kitty Cat, and she's giving Kitty Cat some pay back.

A.105:  She pays Kitty Cat back for all the hassle. 

B.106:  That's right.  Kitty Cat, they will be playing and Kitty Cat will jump on
her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor.

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  Get on top of her and you can't do that this week, she'll have stitches.
Leave her alone.

A.109:  Have you always had cats?  Did you have them when you were a kid?

B.110:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, ever since I was a kid.  

A.111:  My brother was asthmatic, and so we never had pets in the house, we had a
dog for a little bit of the time and then, but that's why I never really liked
cats, you know I always thought cats were loose and,

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  sort of the typical thing you say about cats.  You know, they don't, they
don't, they're not people animals and things like that.

B.114:  Uh-huh. 

A.115:  And I favor dogs a lot, but dogs are just too impractical to have at all.

B.116:  Yeah, well, especially where you are. 

A.117:  Oh, yeah.  It's impossible, people have them and they're out walking them
on the street, but I don't think it's fair to the animals.

B.118:  No, not, not for dogs, especially some of the breeds they have got and some
of those, you know, need to be outside.

A.119:  Yeah. 

B.120:  Have places where they can run and all that.  That's why I like cats so
much better.

A.121:  You let your cats outside? 

B.122:  Oh, no.  Not these, these are, these are all purebred. Oh, yeah.

A.123:  Are you afraid they will get stolen or run away or.  

B.124:  Oh yeah, stolen, run away, no I doubt it, but I don't want them breeding,

A.125:  Well, that's for sure. 

B.126:  with any, any weird, strange cat around here. 

A.127:  Uh-huh.  

B.128:  We're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon.

A.129:  How old is she again? 

B.130:  She's, uh, four months right now. 

A.131:  You breed them that young?  I mean like a year? 

B.132:  Well, no, well no, but you have to line up a stud several months in
advance.

A.133:  I see.  

B.134:  She'll be going into heat probably around, uh, July or August.

A.135:  But, you breed them the first time they go into heat? 

B.136:  Yeah. 

A.137:  Oh.

B.138:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] yeah, your best litter is usually your first one.

A.139:  Really, wow that's amazing, I would have thought that it would be better to
wait a little bit.

B.140:  No, it's sort of an old wife, or common folk tales, about, you know, if
you're going to have a cat spayed, let it go through heat first.  Not true,
because when they go into heat their, uh, genetic parts swell up and expand
and everything, and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more
difficult.

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  It's easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat, but when
they first go into heat, that's the time you want to breed them.  Especially
the purebreds, we'll find you a nice handsome stud.

A.143:  Are you going to try and breed her several times or you will see how the
first breeding goes or.

B.144:  Uh, probably just twice. 

A.145:  Uh-huh. 

B.146:  Just twice for her, and we're probably going to end up keeping one out of
each litter.

A.147:  How expensive are the thoroughbred cats to get? 

B.148:  Not too awfully, Sheba, Sheba cost us, uh, two hundred dollars.

A.149:  That's not bad but you certainly want to protect them after that.

B.150:  Oh, yeah the stud fee is worse I mean we're going to be paying probably
three to four hundred dollars for a stud.

A.151:  Wow, how much can you sell the litter for, you know the same type of price
if they are good or,

B.152:  Uh-huh. 

A.153:  You know the same type of place if they are good. 

B.154:  We're going to breed her with a champion, so we'll be able to get probably
around two fifty for the kittens.

A.155:  And how much did you get for the kittens? 

B.156:  Her first one will probably be about four.
