REMARKS:        The conversation was dominated by speaker A.

==============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay.  What are your feelings on crime and what can be done about it.  I'd
be interested in hearing, since you are a prison guard.

B.2:  The problem goes all the way back to the entire criminal justice system
needs to be reworked.

A.3:  Boy that's for sure.  I agree there. 

B.4:  No longer do we have a point where the crime fits the punishment.  We've
got guys now with, in Texas anyway is what I'm talking about.

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  With the situation we've got with prison overcrowding and everything, a man
gets a fifteen year sentence, they're averaging serving one month for every
year assessed.

A.7:  Right. 

B.8:  That's not, the punishment is not fitting the crime now. 

A.9:  No, that's for sure. I mean, it's, it's kind of sad when you have to give
them more than one life sentence in order to insure that they're going to stay
in for a while.  I mean, you know, even that's wh-,

B.10:  I even gone, have gone to the point where I don't believe in giving them a
life sentence, if you have to do that, you might as well shoot them.

A.11:  Yeah [laughter].

B.12:  It costs twenty-five thousand dollars per inmate per year just to keep them
locked up.  That doesn't count any medical or dental health they get.

A.13:  Wow, um. 

B.14:  A bullet costs twenty-five cents you tell me which one's more cost
effective.

A.15:  Yeah, and who's paying for it, certainly not the people that are in there,
the, the victims, in, in a, in the sense are paying for it.

B.16:  The victims and,

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  and the citizens of Texas. 

A.19:  Right.  No, yeah, they do need to, to drastically do something, uh, about
the whole works because, uh, it's obvious, especially with the introduction of
drugs now that crime is, is, there's, it's in such the up rise, I mean,
there's so much more of it now than there was even fifteen years ago.

B.20:  As long as you've got, the problem, a big part of the problem anyway, take
a look at most of your politicians that are in now.

A.21:  Yes.

B.22:  Ninety percent of them are practicing lawyers.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  As long as you got practicing lawyers in politics, they're going to rig the
laws to where they know they're never going to run out of business.

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  As far as hard line laws dealing with criminals, we don't have them in this
country anymore, we have situation ethics.

A.27:  Oh, I believe that.  I do.

B.28:  John Q. Citizen goes up, robs the liquor store, shoots the guy behind the
counter, his, his, uh, lawyer is going to argue that, well, my client was
under the influence of whatever drug he was on at the time, and he wasn't
really in his normal frame, frame of mind.

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  Well apparently he had enough snapping to where he got it, whatever weapon
he used,

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  and he was coherent enough to tell the guy give me the money or I'm going
to kill you.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  If he, if he had enough snap to do that, he knew what he was doing, the
penalty assessed is death, period.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Well, I,

B.36:  That's to simple. 

A.37:  I, yeah, I know, uh, that is too simple, well, people keep saying, well,
what if they, you know, or, uh, they're, look at how long people sit on Death
Row,

B.38:  That's,

A.39:  before they even, do, I mean, they've been assigned the death penalty and
they don't even do it, you know.

B.40:  Well, that's, that's one of my biggest screams about the entire,

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  death penalty goes for.  In this country they just appeal it and appeal
it, and appeal it.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  If a person has done a crime so bad that the jury gives them the death
penalty, of, the Supreme Court says we've got to give them one appeal, okay, I
agree,

A.45:  Okay, one. 

B.46:  give them one appeal. 

A.47:  Right.  But that's all. 

B.48:  When that appeal fails within thirty days, execution of sentence.

A.49:  Yes.  Look, I mean, that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is
the years that these guys sit on Death Row.  I mean,

B.50:  I think that, ((you know of the, the, uh)), run across a man's file that
was like on Death Row for nine years before they finally got around to
executing him.

A.51:  [Laughter] oh, no.  I mean, look at them.

B.52:  I think you, keeping him on Death Row for nine years was cruel and
unusually torture.

A.53:  Oh, yeah, there, you know, they ((say)) that they can't, uh, inflict cr-,
cruel and unusual punishment, but boy what is that.  Knowing that any day the
shoe could drop,

B.54:  That's it.  

A.55:  I mean, yeah, uh-huh, I mean, nine years, that's incredible.  Oh, I don't
know what the average is, uh, uh,

B.56:  Eight.

A.57:  Eight is the average? 

B.58:  Is the average. 

A.59:  Wow. 

B.60:  Because they'll appeal it for that many times. 

A.61:  It should be never, it should, that should have a cutoff time just like,
uh, uh, statutes of limits and eve-, all that other stuff, you know, they,
they should have like within one year so that they'd have enough time for an
appeal and, uh, you know, get that stuff out-of-the-way and if it's turned
down the, the, you know, after that, if, if two people have said it, then two
is enough.  They shouldn't even allow the lawyers to go any further.  I think
they're kind of bending the law ((they)) just want more money is what it is,
I'm sorry.

B.62:  They want the money so, they're going to,

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  they will twist it and bend it. 

A.65:  Well, uh, this is kind of obvious, I mean, they're even carrying it to, to
where now, uh, that they advertise on T V, you know.  If your, if you, uh, you
know, have done this or if you need this, uh, uh, we'll sue for you, and you
don't have to pay us unless you, but then what they don't tell you is that if
you, ((if)) they win, you give them at least a third of the, of the thing that
they win, so.  I don't know it is, uh, it's getting to be more business now
rather than, uh, actually, uh, dealing with the crime than with, uh, um, the,
uh, punishment the, the lawyers are just in it for the money [laughter], I'm,
I'm convinced.  I know, I, I agree with you, I think you're real, you're very
right that the politicians should, I think they should have an equal amount
of, you know, maybe they can have a few but I think most of them should be
not, uh, lawyers.  In the fact, and that's, wa-, way they've gotten into
politics [laughter] because of the, the law things, you know, the loops and
everything.  But, uh, but, no, I know, we, it, um, we're in Maryland and, uh,
we have the same thing, overcrowding and, and, uh, they are letting then out
which the regular jail sentence thing, they let them out because of, they
don't have any place ((they can, to put)), so, somebody that could, you know,
uh, unless, uh, been a major offense but, uh, uh, even the piddly little stuff
I mean, the, the guys that loses today in America is the victim.  And whoever
that may be, whether it's a robbery or drugs or whatever else, um, they are
the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer.
And the other person, you know, if, if they, if they, uh, arrest them, uh,
and, uh, then, you know, time the law takes over, uh, half the time, uh, they
either let them go or they get off with a, a sentence because they've had a
lawyer that, you know, feels that, that they weren't all together when they
did it [laughter].

B.66:  Things are going to come to a point it's going to probably get to such an
extent where the average American citizen, if they see a crime go down or a
crime is happening against them, they're not going to worry about trying to
get a policeman, they're not going to worry about it because they're going to
be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business
themselves.

A.67:  Right.  Although, you know, uh, [laughter] that, uh, it's kind of a catch
twenty-two because if you defend yourself, or as there was a case where this
fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into, uh, through a vent in
the see-, in the ceiling, uh, the roof, so, he put an electric grate there.
Well, somebody tried to break in, got stuck and was electrocuted.  And he was
being sued because this guy was breaking into his store, he got electrocuted
and was killed coming into his store.

B.68:  That's we're if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever, they'd
have thrown that out before it even got,

A.69:  That's right.  That's right.  You know, now, here's the innocent guy that's
just trying to keep in business, you know, he had tried dogs, he tried
security people, he tried, you know, several other things, the dogs, like,
they would just kill the dogs, you know, so, uh, it's, it's, it's wrong, your
right [laughter].  Um, I, it, it, seems unfortunate and a little frustrating
because it seems like we have citizens, the, there isn't much we can do, um,
you try to hope that, uh, you know, your senators and your representatives
and, uh, are going to represent what the people want but, uh, uh, they
certainly, I'm not sure which way to take to shake-up the system bad enough to
start making some reforms.  Surely nice to see it happening soon.  Because
it's obvious that, uh, pretty soon they're not going to be able to handle, you
know, all of the crime that there is.  So, I don't know.  Uh, it must be
especially frustrating to you having, do you work there now or is, was this,
uh, uh, was this before?

B.70:  I work there now. 

A.71:  Oh, okay, so, it's just another job.  Uh, it must be especially frustrating
because even your rights in there [laughter] are,

B.72:  When I walk through, this is what's bad, when I walk through the front
gate, the inmates have more rights than I do.

A.73:  Yeah, and boy does that stink.  Uh, that's the same way here, uh, and they
have more freedom, I mean, I understand that, I mean, I'm not, I mean, you
can't be everywhere all the time and I'm sure that they have searches and
everything but, I mean, the weapons that they make or that they get and the, I
mean, to me it would be like walking around in a time bomb all the time, even
just being there, you're just working there.  Um, because you never know if
you're going to get knifed or something, uh, you know, as a guard that, it
must be scary [laughter].  Uh, and yet,

B.74:  Some days it is.

A.75:  Yeah, well, and yet, did they, can they do anything to them when they're in
prison, I mean, surely they can put them in solitary or something.  I mean, or
is that just ((mythical))?

B.76:  Uh, you can put, uh, there's, um, any number of things you can do.  Aside
from locking up in solitaire, you can reduce their class in good time, have
them sent to a harder prison than what they're already locked up in, they've
got the different security class, you've got your,

A.77:  Oh, okay, I didn't know that.

B.78:  minimum in, minimum out.  You've got your medium and the ...
