REMARKS:        Speaker B talked very low and there was so much background
noise on A's side that it was hard to hear.

===========================================================================

A.1:  [Static] [TV] Okay.

B.2:  Okay.  Well, uh, do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually
vote?

A.3:  I think it's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people
believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference.
And they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore.

B.4:  Huh.

A.5:  Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked, you
know?

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  #And so# they figure why go out and vote, you know.  They're going to do
what they want to do.  They're corrupt anyway [clanging].  #And# --

B.8:  #Well,# 

A.9:  -- I think one of the good ways of solving that is to like, everybody likes
to come to a party so have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in
communities [talking] and have the issues there and then everybody go vote
together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something.  #I mean
that's the only,#

B.10:  #[Laughter].#

A.11:  thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many people say well I'm
not going on voting on that one, you know, I, I'm going to go fishing today.
Or it won't make any difference if, if I don't vote [thumping] and I think it
does.  #We vote every time.#

B.12:  #Well, it, uh,# there's no question it does make a difference.  Uh, so far,

A.13:  [Tones].

B.14:  as having a party and then all voting, uh, when you have different
precincts, (( )) you would have to have a party in every precinct.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  Because people have to vote in different areas and, uh, not everyone votes
at the same place.

A.17:  [/Tones].

B.18:  Uh, I, personally, think that we need to do more along the education lines
in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of
the, the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make
a difference.  #But,# 

A.19:  #Right.#  And ma-, maybe let them have some mock, I #mean# --

B.20:  #Absolutely.#

A.21:  -- uh, you know [clanging] elections #and stuff# --

B.22:  #Absolutely.#

A.23:  -- and vote for different people in their classes and start really young.
#That's a real good idea.#

B.24:  #And, and they are are doing# that in a number of schools.

A.25:  [Thumping].

B.26:  However, probably not enough of them, uh, country wide.  But it's going to
take at least a whole generation of people, uh, to get across the idea of
voting.  Uh, just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally,
uh, realize the harmfulness of drugs #and# --

A.27:  #Right.#

B.28:  -- uh, hopefully to, uh, now with the many programs throughout the country
on,

A.29:  [Clink].

B.30:  how to resist taking drugs.  How to say no to it and what have you.  That,
uh, perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it.  But, uh, I know I,

A.31:  [Thumping].

B.32:  I spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area and in
nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside
the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana, giving away
their heroin {mispronounced} and what have you, to get them started.

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  And, you know, that was in fifty-one.  That's forty years ago --

A.35:  God.

B.36:  -- that it was already a problem.  So it's now, uh, to the forefront and
people are finally taking some action against it.  And the thing, we've, we've
neglected the value of voting.  #And# --

A.37:  #Right.#

B.38:  -- uh, and what it really means [clicking] to vote and [barking] we also
don't make the, uh, the issues perhaps in language that people fully
understand them.

A.39:  Yeah.  Well I don't know how it is up there but down here, Louisiana has a
bad reputation for their politicians and all.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  I mean, I'm sure you heard #about# --

B.42:  #Sure.#

A.43:  -- some of ours.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  And, uh, people are just, I mean it's like they're turned off on voting.
And that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Okay, we're going to have a block party.  Everybody's going to get
together.  We're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then
we're going to go and vote, you know.  We're going to go vote like, maybe they
could give something like, uh, the top neighborhood, if you had a hundred
percent in your neighborhood or something like that, you know.  I mean it
doesn't have to be, it could be like a, a sign that they would put down at the
end of your block.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  You know, or anything like that but it, it's really bad here.  I mean to me
it is.  It seems like people just don't care anymore.  They say, huh, well it
don't make any difference, you know.  One crook is as good as the other one.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  And they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say.  

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  And, uh, I know my husband [thumping] now we go vote every time.  I don't
care how #small the ballot is, I# --

B.54:  #Uh-huh.  Right.#

A.55:  -- mean, if there's one thing, if there's one issue, because the way I feel
is if I don't vote, then I don't have any reason,

B.56:  [Barking]. 

A.57:  to gripe.

B.58:  To complain about it, right?

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change, I wish that
and, you know, but they didn't go vote.

B.62:  That's right.

A.63:  And, uh, maybe if they, like you said, if they would start when little kids
and start letting them vote and learn how to vote --

B.64:  That's right.

A.65:  -- and all.  Then, uh, and the importance of it because, okay, if you
don't vote for your friend over here, well your friend's not going to have a
chance.  

B.66:  ((Tha-,))

A.67:  He needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses, you know.  Maybe if
they were brought up that a way, like you said, it would.  Because I know
here, uh, until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines
and you voted for like #cheerleaders# --

B.68:  #Yes.  Uh-huh.#

A.69:  -- and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier.

B.70:  Yeah.  I, it's the same way with everything in education though.  It should
begin and right down in the first grade.  Uh, and your very best teachers in
my estimation should be first, second or third grade.  So that the children
develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on
learning and continue learning, #uh# --

A.71:  #Right.#

B.72:  -- and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try
to change them around at that point.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  But, uh, everything should be started on the lower levels and, uh,
certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that, you know, they, they
understood that the principles of the country were established so that
everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote
meant #and# --

A.75:  #Right.#

B.76:  -- uh, but it, but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a
negative attitude towards politicians.

A.77:  [Tones].

B.78:  And perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to
run, uh, that only the most wealthy can do so.

A.79:  Right. 

B.80:  And they're not always the best person for the job.  

A.81:  ((Right)).

B.82:  But they have the money to be able to do it.  #So, uh# --

A.83:  #Definitely.#

B.84:  -- so that there are a lot of problems along that line also.  And perhaps
#the Government,#

A.85:  #You know# a good i-, idea for the young kids like that too, is to have
like a [lipsmack] a mock one.  And, okay, this, this candidate #tells# --

B.86:  #Sure.#

A.87:  -- you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells 
#you# --

B.88:  #Right.#

A.89:  -- some things.  Okay, then this percentage of the voters, I mean the kids
in that class, they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to
do whatever [thumping] these people, whichever one the other #people# --

B.90:  #Uh-huh.#

A.91:  -- elect do.  If they did something like that and started kids out real
young and showed them, okay now you're not going to get to vote but 
#you're# --

B.92:  #Yes.#

A.93:  -- going to have to do what that person says, they would understand
probably by the time [laughter] they #were# --

B.94:  #Right.#

A.95:  -- in high school, #they'd be ready to vote.#

B.96:  #That's right.# And I think, you know, that's an excellent idea.  They
would put them to realize that, that their going to have to do what someone
else says even though they didn't vote for it.

A.97:  #Yeah.#

B.98:  #And# that maybe they need to think twice about voting.  #Now some# --

A.99:  #Right.#

B.100:  -- people object during primaries, having to declare a party, whether
Republican or Democrat and --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- you do that in the primary.  Uh, and I don't know that, uh, a lot of
people vote in primaries for that very reason.  Uh, they can declare anything
they want and they can actually ((rig it)).  If they really wanted to vote
Republican, they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and
then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat.
But, uh, it's, uh, it's just a sad situation and, uh, I do think more needs to
be done along that line to help to, uh, teach the people, uh, uh, everyone,
uh, more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  So that, uh, we can make, they're making some more intelligent decisions.
And it's going to #take these young# --

A.105:  #I think that sounds great.#

B.106:  -- you know, it's going to take the, uh, a whole generation of my feeling,
uh, before that's going to be accomplished [clicking].

A.107:  Well, you know, they'd have to start when #they're real young.#

B.108:  #That's right.#

A.109:  I mean, you know, it would have to be a child that is just coming into
school.  Because, well I'll tell you another thing too now.  Whenever, the
first time I voted, I never voted in high school because there was never
anyone that showed us how to #use the# --

B.110:  #Uh-huh.#

A.111:  -- voting machines, now this sounds dumb, [inhaling] but I did not know how
to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so I
didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question, all
the other #kids# --

B.112:  #Yeah.#

A.113:  -- laughed at them.  They thought that was funny.  #Ah, she don't even know
how, ((wah, wah)).#

B.114:  #Right.  Uh-huh.#

A.115:  So there wasn't any way I was going to go in there and vote.  And it took
me, I mean it took such courage #you wouldn't [laughter] believe# --

B.116:  #Sure.#

A.117:  -- to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh
at me because #I# --

B.118:  #Right.#

A.119:  -- didn't know how to work the machines.

B.120:  Well #sure it is.#

A.121:  #Now that's bad.# And I mean I was out of school.  I was a #married
person.#

B.122:  #Uh-huh.#

A.123:  And, uh, I didn't know how to work the machine, you know.  And it really
scared me, really bad.  Because I thought all these people are going to laugh
at me because I don't know how to work this machine.  Where if they'd, if
they'd had a class or something or #just to a short time, you know, to,
((said)) okay, this is the way,# 

B.124:  #Well, just the, just the opportunity to try the# voting machines, yeah.

A.125:  Right.  It's, this is the way it's going to be.  And my son was exactly the
same way that I was and I didn't realize it until, uh, his senior year.  I s-,
asked him something about well did you, who did you vote for, for, uh,
cheerleader [tones]?  And he said, oh I didn't go vote.  He said, uh, there's
no way I'm getting in that machine.  Well then I realized it so when we went
and voted the next time, I asked the, uh, lady, I said I want my son to come
in with me and she said well, uh, why, you know.  He'll have to come back out.
I said because I want him to know how to #use [/tones]# --

B.126:  #Right.#

A.127:  -- one of these and I said, I won't turn any of the buttons down but I want
to show him how to use it so that #he'll be# --

B.128:  #Yes.  Uh-huh.#

A.129:  -- able to vote [lipsmack].  And, uh, so he went in and now #he's a# --

B.130:  #Good.#

A.131:  -- registered voter.  But he would not #vote# --

B.132:  #Yeah.#

A.133:  -- before then.  And, I mean, #I think that's bad.#

B.134:  #Sure it is.#  #Absolutely.#

A.135:  #You know, here# I was.  And, and even, of course there's a lot of years
between the two of us, but even with that many years between [/static] [/TV],
