B.1:  Talk about the activities that we don't do [laughter].

A.2:  Yeah.  [laughter] I, I don't have any children, so, but I, I have a lot of
friends with children and I know they spend a lot of time with them.
[breathing] [laughter] Which is good, you know.

B.3:  That's good to hear.  Yeah, an, I haven't, uh, well I've been around a lot
of people lately at wo-, at my job that don't have a lot of values [laughter].

A.4:  [Laughter].

B.5:  So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other, [laughter]
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things
together.

A.6:  Yeah, ye-, ha-, have a lot of values, I love that.  

B.7:  [Laughter].

A.8:  Do they have children?

B.9:  Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't, [laughter] but she's married,
and I, I'm not quite sure why.  [laughter] I, I think he said that he'd give
her a big ring and she got married to him.

A.10:  Oh, that's wonderful [breathing] [laughter].

B.11:  But, it, it's kind of weighed on me and then the other day my husband and I
met a couple who, who, they're just going to have their first child and they
really like each other.  [laughter] And they're real happy with one another
and she says things like, I'm really glad when he comes home and there's not
enough time to spend with him in the evening and,

A.12:  Oh, that's neat.

B.13:  I'm like, really.

A.14:  [Laughter] That's good, you know, I like to see that.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  You know, I have, uh, some friends that, uh, first of all, uh, the girls
joined, they have two girls, one joined the Girl Scouts and the other was in
the Brownies and then the mother got involved as a leader and then all of a
sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and
working with the Girl Scout camp he-, here in Dallas and then going out to,
uh, Betty Perot camp and working with the horses and stuff and they're gone a
lot and they take their girls and they go away for weekends and in the winter
time even, you know, to do work with the Girl Scouts and I think it's neat.

B.17:  Oh, yeah.

A.18:  You know, they've really become very much involved in, in just that one
organization, which the organization can use the help too.

B.19:  Right.

A.20:  So, I, I wish I could see more of that, you know.

B.21:  On Sunday we just met, uh, a family, we were thinking about getting (( ))
cat and we went over to, uh, lady that breeds them here in town and, uh, her
daughter actually was, he-, she said that her husband said to her daughter,
you need a hobby, so, she chose the cats.

A.22:  [Laughter] Oh.

B.23:  And you can tell, it's a family hobby.  [laughter] The-, they're all a
part of it.  And it was really neat because they all were interested in each
other and, and the cats and they raise champion cats.  So, they've done really
well.

A.24:  Ugh, those are neat cats, too.

B.25:  Yeah, I've just learned about that breed.

A.26:  They're really nice looking cats.  I have seven cats but they're all
mongrels [laughter].

B.27:  Well that's what we're going to end up getting [laughter].

A.28:  Well they're the ones that need the homes.

B.29:  Oh, yeah.

A.30:  You know, mine were just all, uh, strays in the neighborhood.   Little
baby kittens dropped and stuff and it just kind of built.  [laughter]  One at a
time, just kin-, I couldn't, you know.  One time two of them came at once and
I can't turn a hungry cat down.

B.31:  Oh, I know.  

A.32:  So, you know, and the last one that I pic-, was here, uh, the kids brought
him over and said he was injured and it was winter time and I said, I just can
not have another cat, I just can not have another cat and I looked out there
and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all,

B.33:  Oh!

A.34:  and I said, I can't stand it, I brought him in so. [breathing] [laughter]
Those are my children.

B.35:  [Laughter].

A.36:  We don't have very many activities [laughter] but,  

B.37:  No, I know what you mean, our cat hates other cats, and, th-, we've tried
to get her to like other cats and she just, uh, she wants to be around human
beings and she does not want to be around other cats.  So our next, uh, we're
going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out.

A.38:  Ha, ha, lots of luck.  Is she spayed.

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  Oh, yeah, real maternal [laughter].

B.41:  We're hoping, it's our last hope [laughter].

A.42:  She'll eventually, I mean, mine, you know, I have five males and two
females.  Everybody's spayed, everybody's neutered and we still have a scrap
every now and then.  Nothing real bad, you know, a slap here and there, but,
uh, they put up with each other and they will eventually.  He-, her nose will
be out of joint for a while and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and
then, but they'll, she'll finally accept it.  You know, they really don't have
any choice [laughter].

B.43:  They mi-, [laughter],

A.44:  In my household, we have a little bit, of, uh, a fight for whose boss.  I
mean a male cats are, are re-, you know, real territorial and so that's the
big battle here, you know, of whose, whose top dog, we-, top cat, I guess.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  You know, but, uh, we-, I don-, I don't know, I don't have a problem with
it.  I think they just learn to accept.  And I have two dogs too, and they've
slapped the dogs around too [laughter].

B.47:  Yeah, yeah.

A.48:  Every now and then, so.

B.49:  That's true, they've got to keep them in line.

A.50:  Yeah but she'll accept another cat eventually.  As long as you make her
feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything, so.

B.51:  Yeah, well those (( )) cats were great.  They were fourteen pounds and,

A.52:  [Breathing] [laughter]  And they'r-, 

B.53:  oh, they're just gorgeous, but, yeah, it, three hundred and fifty
dollars for a kitten.

A.54:  Oh my gosh [gasp].

B.55:  And I think of those, I think of the kittens at the pound.

A.56:  Yeah.  Three hundred and fifty dollars {whispers}.

B.57:  Yeah, yeah, and they are lovely but,

A.58:  {Still whispering}  Ugh, house payment [laughter].

B.59:  [Laughter] Right.

A.60:  That is a lot of money.

B.61:  Yeah, and then she's saying, you know,  you can't let them outside and you
can't do all this stuff and I'm like, ugh, you know.

A.62:  I don't let mine out anyway, but.  I let two of them out just in the
back yard every now and then, but my cats are insi-, I'm afraid, you know, the
neighbors will, people throw rocks at them,

B.63:  [Gasp].

A.64:  and people run over them and, I, I just, you know, I just don't.  I know
so-, and, and now they've lost the desire.  Most of them don't even try to
ge-, you know, to go out.  I just have two that drive me crazy,

B.65:  [Laughter].

A.66:  that I let out in the back, you know, but I won't let them get, if they
start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.

B.67:  Oh.

A.68:  You know, I just worry, I guess I'm too protective, but, you know.  I see
these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood and too they can catch
diseases really easy,

B.69:  Yeah, yeah.

A.70:  just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac-, leukemia,
feline leukemia, so.

B.71:  Yeah.

A.72:  We know we try, try real hard to keep them healthy.

B.73:  Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll
have some room to walk around,

A.74:  Oh, how neat.

B.75:  and not off of a busy street.  We're, we're choosing our house for our
cat.  Isn't that bad [laughter].

A.76:  People do it for their children [laughter], I mean, why not.

B.77:  Oh, them too [laughter].

A.78:  Well you know, why not, why not.

B.79:  We-, because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves th-, outside, 

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  and, and she doesn't go far but she just wants to be able to have that
freedom.

A.82:  Yeah, well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road, and.
You're off of the main road, you said?

B.83:  Yeah, yeah.

A.84:  Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably
okay.  I'm just real, I don't know, I guess, I'm in a neighborhood and it's,
it's just real tough on animals here, you know.

B.85:  Yeah, it gets hard, especially with the cars.

A.86:  Whe-, I, every time I see one run over I just, you know, it makes me
sick, so, you know, 

B.87:  Oh, I know.

A.88:  but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children, 

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  except that I consider them my children [laughter].

B.91:  [Laughter] Yeah, our cats are our kids or,  

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  I, we, we got married a few months ago and I'm like, well why can't Ashley
be at the wedding [laughter].

A.94:  Oh, no.  [laughter]  In, in her little bridesmaid dress [laughter].  

B.95:  Yeah, you know, if I could have, I would have.

A.96:  [Laughter] Well I'm sure it's been done.  I'm sure it has been done.  Well
they have weddings for dogs now and cats and, 

B.97:  Oh.

A.98:  you know, they have all that parties for them where they dress up.  I've
seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them
to a par-,

B.99:  Oh, my.

A.100:  I haven't gone that far.  I'm not that bonkers.

B.101:  No [laughter].

A.102:  You know, my cats do not wear clothes, an [laughter],

B.103:   I, I don't think they'd like to.  

A.104:  No.

B.105:  I put a bow on her one ni-, on day and Jerry just kept saying you are the
meanest person [laughter].

A.106:  [Laughter].

B.107:  I took a picture of her [laughter] and that was all it, all it lasted
for.

A.108:  We-, d-, do any of your friends have, have, uh, older children that they
do anything with.  Do, do you have friends with older children, or do they
just all have young kids.

B.109:  Um, yeah, all the ones I know, my brother-in-law has three young kids seven
and on down and they, they go on family vacations and, uh, they go, like to go
skiing, we-, the, the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention, but,
uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had in-, contracted chicken pox
first and then she spread it to her, her li-, younger sister and her brother
and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation, where she got better.
So, sh-, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention,
because she got to go out.  [laughter] [breathing] I think she planned it.
She's only five, but I think she planned it [laughter].

A.110:  [Laughter].

B.111:  And she got all the attention from her dad.

A.112:  Oh, see there, she needed that, 

B.113:  Wo-, oh yeah.

A.114:  didn't she.  You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,
I, you know, to ha-, I was an only child, my mother was an only child so, I,
you know, I wasn't raised with brothers or sisters and I always got all the
attention, so I wouldn't know.  I think I would be extremely jealous, or would
have been, had there been another child in the family.

B.115:  Yeah, it's, it's, we can see it work with her,

A.116:  Tough, it must be tough.

B.117:  she's frustrated.

A.118:  Yeah, yeah.  We-, she, she's the middle one?

B.119:  Yeah.

A.120:  So she's never been the only one, so she really doesn't even know what it
is to be the only one.

B.121:  Right.

A.122:  Yeah, that's tough, you know ...
