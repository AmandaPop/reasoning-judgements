REMARKS:        The initial transcribing of this tape was a little better than
average.  But, while listening to Speaker A's section and Speaker B's section, 
there were a lot of noises and background sounds that I had to insert that 
could not be heard on the first section of the tape.  Also, Speaker B's baby 
was in the background quite a bit.  Sometimes the baby was crying, sometimes 
the baby was just making baby noises (i. e. squealing, playing), and sometimes 
the baby was talking, which was very time consuming. As I said before, a lot 
of the baby's noises could not be heard on the initial transcribing of the 
tape.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, I think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we
didn't buy so much stuff overseas.

B.2:  Well, I don't know how much that would do for the budget, though.  I mean,
that has helped the economy as a whole, [noise] you know, American,

A.3:  Well, then maybe,

B.4:  jobs and all.  But,

A.5:  they wouldn't have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that
[breathing].

B.6:  Yeah, if we bought more American stuff I guess that's more American taxes.
Well, I guess, you know it's like your own home budget, you know, you can
either earn more money or you can, uh, spend less.  And, you know, just like
you and I have to make choices like that, I think the government has to do it,
too.

A.7:  Well, I agree.  I think that's what I'm trying to say [laughter].

B.8:  Yeah.  The question is wh-, which [baby_crying], excuse me, that's my
little girl.  Which one [/baby_crying] should they do?

A.9:  {Pause} [Breathing] Spend less.  I think we sh-, well, I think we give too
much money away.

B.10:  To?

A.11:  Other countries.

B.12:  To other countries?

A.13:  Yeah.  We don't ever get,

B.14:  [Baby_crying]. 

A.15:  anything from anybody.  When we're having,

B.16:  Well, that's, that's the,

A.17:  to fight to get money to, 

B.18:  ((that's the)),

A.19:  help us with this war we were just in.

B.20:  We're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away
[/baby_crying].

A.21:  Right.  Well, it's not true though.  We're not anymore.

B.22:  Well, I, we're s-, we are still the biggest ones [breathing] as, you know,
as far as how much money we've got in the whole country.  We're still bigger
than anybody else.

A.23:  [Breathing] We can't even take care of the people that are hungry and,

B.24:  [Baby_crying]. 

A.25:  homeless here.

B.26:  Yeah.  That's,

A.27:  I mean, 

B.28:  that's an important thing.  We've got, we've got a lot of people
[clicking] who are getting money [clicking] from the government for this,
that, and the other thing and, uh, it would probably help if we could figure
out how to get them to put money back into the system instead, you know.  You
take someone on welfare [clicking] and you give them a job and they're paying
income taxes, all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the
other direction.

A.29:  But, see, r-, right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  If you're a T I worker you, how well you know.  Are you,

B.32:  [Laughter].  

A.33:  are you a T I worker?

B.34:  Yes.  I am.

A.35:  Yeah.  So am I [breathing].  So we know, you know, that times are really
tough right now.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  And yet we're still [breathing] sending money here and there, I just know
it,

B.38:  [Baby_crying]. 

A.39:  you know, it's just crazy.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  And more and more people without, I have several friends without jobs now
that, in this last riff [breathing] went out looking for jobs.  And jobs are
really hard to come by now.

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  #Really# hard to come by.

B.44:  Yeah.  That's what I don't understand.

A.45:  And that's scary,

B.46:  [/Baby_crying] Yeah.  You wonder, you know, when is it going to happen to
me.

A.47:  That's right.  

B.48:  [Baby_crying]. 

A.49:  It's already happened to me once.

B.50:  Yeah [/baby_crying]. 

A.51:  But I was lucky.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And I got to stay in T I but, you know, not,

B.54:  [Baby_crying].

A.55:  everybody's that lucky anymore [breathing].

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  And their, I don't know, the welfare system is just so abused.

B.58:  [Beep] {pause} [/baby_crying] Well, I, I don't think the problem so much is
abuse.  I think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too
much.  Um, I mean, who, where does it say that the government's supposed to be
the one to take care of all of the people [noise] that are homeless or
hungry or et cetera, [noise] et cetera?  [baby] And, and where does it say
that, that if [baby] someone is short that they can go to the government and,
and get a handout?

A.59:  Well, I know, but then, okay, but that's here.  But then, other countries
are doing it to,

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  us.  

B.62:  [Baby]. 

A.63:  Their, when their people are hungry and all, they're asking us,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  for handouts.  So why shouldn't our own people be able to ask,

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  for a handout?  I mean, I think,

B.68:  [Baby]. 

A.69:  we should take care of our own things right here,

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  in our own country.  And then, if we have anything left over to share
with other countries, then maybe we should consider sharing.  But --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- I just don't, I think we're s-, and then they keep raising the taxes.
Boy, I'll tell you what, I barely make ends meet, and they raise taxes and
[breathing] wages aren't going up that much,

B.74:  No.  They're not.

A.75:  [Laughter]  And it's hard.  I,

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  mean, you know, especially if you're alone, it's, on one salary, it's
terribly hard,

B.78:  [Baby] Yeah.

A.79:  to pay the bills and pay,

B.80:  [/Baby].

A.81:  your house payment and a car payment, and insurance is ridiculous
[breathing],

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  you know.  And,

B.84:  You know, I think, you know, I've got a fairly decent job here at T I but,
uh, when I think of y-, you go to the, the [noise] grocery store and you see
someone working as a [noise] cashier and you think, [noise] y-, you know how
much a cashier makes.

A.85:  Not very,

B.86:  And you go, 

A.87:  much.  

B.88:  how do these people get by?  Because, 

A.89:  They, 

B.90:  I know how hard it is for me to get by [baby_crying].

A.91:  Yep.  It's hard.  It's really hard.  I, 

B.92:  Yeah [baby_crying].

A.93:  Well, no, I don't know, I guess if we had the answers we'd,

B.94:  [Baby_crying] [laughter].

A.95:  we could save the country but, 

B.96:  [Laughter]  We could go run for office [laughter].

A.97:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, they all say great things when they run for office.

B.98:  Well, the thing is, um, you know, who's really in charge of deciding how
the money gets spent?  And, and, [baby_crying] it's, you know, it's not the
president.  The president just suggests it.  The ones who actually (( ))
debate it and decide it is the, is the Congress.  And you know what the
Congress is out for?  They're, they're [/baby_crying] going to do whatever it
takes to make their voters happy, which means bring more jobs and more federal
spending to their little area and, uh, and that means every Congressman is
sitting there working for money going to his area.  Nobody's working on less
money going to his area, or on anybody else's area.  And if you just, if you
just look at how much [noise] Congress spends on itself, it's ridiculous.

A.99:  Yeah.  I know that.  You know, and then they cut the defense.  I, I'm not
sure if that was such a great idea.  That cut us really bad [laughter].  I ((
)), I hated to see that.

B.100:  Well, now, the thing is [clicking] {pause}, yeah, they're cutting defense
which is, you know, there are people out there working for defense contractors
who are losing money.  But I d-, I don't mind, because I think you'll,
government is not there to give me a job.  Government, [noise] the defense is
there to defend our country and they do it for whatever, you know, they spend
whatever money they need to [noise] to do that [/noise].  But I don't want
them to, to break the budget,

A.101:  [Breathing].

B.102:  just so that I can have a job [noise].  I would rather have the, the
government stable so that I can go get a good job with someone who's not
work-, you know, not making defense stuff [/noise].

A.103:  {Pause} Well,

B.104:  If you know what I mean?

A.105:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I,

B.106:  [Baby]. 

A.107:  do.  But I still hated to see it [laughter].  I mean,

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  one of the reasons I voted for Bush was because Reagan was so defense
conscious and we were doing so well, and I thought, well, Bush is going to
just carry right on [laughter].

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  [Breathing] He didn't [laughter].  Was I surprised [laughter].

B.112:  Well, he didn't have much choice, really.

A.113:  [Lipsmack] Well, 

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I don't know.

B.116:  But the defense is not the biggest part of the federal [noise] budget,
either.  The biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social
Security.  And, uh,

A.117:  [Noise]  But those are things that we, we really need.  I,

B.118:  W-,

A.119:  hate to see the old people,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  that don't have anybody, and h-, you know, there are [noise] people out
there that have no family or, and they,

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  really depend on their Medicare --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- and their Social Security, and maybe they're in a nursing home
somewhere.  And they cut,

B.126:  Yeah.  

A.127:  some of this stuff.  And what happens to them?

B.128:  Yeah.  W-, you know how fast your T I medical insurance has been going up,
right?

A.129:  Yeah [laughter].

B.130:  Well, just think, the federal government's insurance bill has Medicare.
And that's been going through the roof.  And that's [beep] why, f-, you know,
that's, that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there.

A.131:  So what's the answer [breathing]?

B.132:  {Pause} [baby] Think we need to figure out a way to, uh, to make medical
care cheaper.  Why is this stuff so expensive?  Why is the cost going up so
incredibly fast?  {Pause} [/baby].  You know, because it's, it's coming out of
my paycheck, it's coming out of your,

A.133:  Yes.  Yes.  

B.134:  paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes, too.  {Pause} [baby].  Why,
why is these hospitals making so much money?

A.135:  Isn't it England that has it all state run or something?

B.136:  Oh, there's a whole lot of countries,

A.137:  But,

B.138:  in Europe that do that.  Sweden, Denmark, Norway.

A.139:  They, what is,

B.140:  [Baby]. 

A.141:  it, is it free to the p-, 

B.142:  [/Baby]. 

A.143:  to people or, how do they work,

B.144:  It's,

A.145:  that?

B.146:  it's free for everybody [baby_crying]. 

A.147:  In the state, or the country? 

B.148:  [/Baby_crying]  Everybody in the count-, like I lived in Denmark for a
couple of years.

A.149:  Uh-huh.

B.150:  And medical care there is free.  You just go and say, I want your help, and
they'll help you.  There's couple of things though.  First of all, it's not as
high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government
instead of by us.  And second, um, your taxes are a lot higher.

A.151:  Oh, okay.

B.152:  An awful lot higher.  We're talking fifty percent, something like that.

A.153:  So they are paying for it?

B.154:  They are paying,

A.155:  Okay.  

B.156:  for it.

A.157:  Well, the way I, you know,

B.158:  And the, and the, 

A.159:  it was talked about,  

B.160:  just the quality of care is not as good, either.

A.161:  Well then, that's not the answer.

B.162:  There has got to be a middle ground.  I,

A.163:  Uh. 

B.164:  think Canada's got a good answer, but I don't know many details about it.

A.165:  {Pause} What do they do?

B.166:  It's, it's some sort of government program.  I've heard a lot of people say
good things about it, but I just don't know the details on it.

A.167:  Oh, okay.  I don't know, I don't know if anything will ever happen t-, to
ch-, change things.  I, I guess it's going to have to change.
 
B.168:  Well, something's going to have to change.  But you look at the Congress
and you look how many of them get reelected and they're the one's that have
got to make the changes.  I mean, I don't see anything changing, because
you've got the same old people in there.

A.169:  And the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance.
Now, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to afford it at all.

B.170:  Yeah.

A.171:  It's eating me alive.  Because, uh, I might be almost fifty, but I'm
single.

B.172:  [Baby]. 

A.173:  ((And [laughter] don't think)), and this company's, 

B.174:  [/Baby] Single.

A.175:  that just becau-, and I own my own home and I have a garage,

B.176:  [Baby]. 

A.177:  [Laughter]  And because I'm single, there's companies that won't take me.
No matter how,

B.178:  [/Baby] Yeah.

A.179:  old you are, they won't take you because they say you're a risk, you go
out and party.  I ((said I)),

B.180:  [Baby].

A.181:  don't even drink.  I,

B.182:  Huh.

A.183:  mean, I don't even go out.  But they won't take, I mean, I was turned
down this year,

B.184:  [/Baby].

A.185:  by an agent who represented, I'm not sure of the,

B.186:  [Baby].

A.187:  companies he represented, but I was told because you're single they
absolutely won't take you.  I said,

B.188:  [/Baby]. 

A.189:  that is, that's prejudicial.  That's terrible.  What's going to, 

B.190:  Yeah.

A.191:  happen if they all start doing,

B.192:  Uh-huh.  

A.193:  this?

B.194:  What's really terrible is they can do this to you, you know, and you don't
really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the
g-, government says if you're going to drive a car, [baby] you've got to have
the insurance.

A.195:  But yet, they're not helping us,

B.196:  They're,  

A.197:  with the company.

B.198:  They're not helping you [/baby] be able to afford the insurance that
they're making you buy.

A.199:  That's right {tape fades}.
