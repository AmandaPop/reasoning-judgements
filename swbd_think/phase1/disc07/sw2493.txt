============================================================================

@B.1:  Okay.  What kind of T V shows do you like?

A.2:  Well, um, I don't have a lot of time to watch T V, unfortunately
[laughter].

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  This is not a good subject.  Um, I, when, the little bit of time I do
[laughter] get to spend because I'm in school [breathing] in the evenings --

B.5:  I see. 

A.6:  -- um, [breathing] uh, I like to watch movies --

B.7:  Uh-huh. 

A.8:  -- and comedies, and uh, I watch the news --

B.9:  The news. 

A.10:  -- and the only game type shows that I ever watch are WHEEL OF FORTUNE.

B.11:  Okay.

A.12:  How about you?  [breathing].

B.13:  Um, I don't, I don't care for WHEEL OF FORTUNE very [laughter] much.

A.14:  [Laughter]. 

B.15:  I don't care for game shows in general, I guess --

A.16:  Well. 

B.17:  -- uh, they're not usually, there's usually not that many on in the evening
anyway.  So about, the WHEEL OF FORTUNE,

A.18:  Yeah, I know.

B.19:  is about the only one that's on in the evening times. 

A.20:  Oh, I haven't watched it in ages but, 

B.21:  Yeah, yeah.

A.22:  uh, you know [laughter]. 

B.23:  Um, I do like, uh, well they had a good T V movie on last night called
SEPARATE BUT EQUAL --

A.24:  Oh, yes, 

B.25:  -- it's a General Motors, 

A.26:  I didn't get a chance to see that.

B.27:  Hall of Fame type presentation.  Uh, it's a two parter, the other part's on
tonight.  But it was about the, uh, the, uh, the, well it's supposed to be a
true story, you know, a dramatization.

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  The true story of the legal struggle that ended up in the Supreme Court
decision, Brown versus the Board of Education, which ended up, um, [lipsmack]
oh, saying that separate and equal is not constitutional as far as, you know,
schools it was talking about.

A.30:  [Noise] Uh-huh.

B.31:  And it was interesting.  It was a, it's, it's, it's really a high, one of
these high drama type, you know, uh, shows that's also true.  Any of those
things I like, HALLMARK HALL OF FAME,

A.32:  Oh, yes. 

B.33:  and those kind of shows are always so good. 

A.34:  Yes,

B.35:  I like to watch those. 

A.36:  they are.  They, I love those.  But then, unfortunately, they don't have
nearly enough of those.  Those, and the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ones,

B.37:  Right.

A.38:  specials.  Those, those are great too. 

B.39:  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I can watch those NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ones over and over
again.

A.40:  [Laughter] Yeah, I know what you mean [laughter]. 

B.41:  And they're, they're good.  They're, they're, I like news shows too.  Like,
uh, SIXTY MINUTES --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- or TWENTY TWENTY.  Uh, when I have a chance I watch those on, uh, I
guess SIXTY MINUTES is usually on Sundays, and, uh, I just like to see, you
know, who they are raking over the coals [laughter].

A.44:  [Laughter] Yes.  Well, you know, I think they're ((supposed)) to have a new
one out.  Have you ever watched EXPOS3E?

B.45:  I haven't caught that one yet.

A.46:  Uh, that's kind of one along the line of SIXTY SIXTY, I mean, uh, not
SIXTY, TWENTY TWENTY, and --

B.47:   TWENTY TWENTY? 

A.48:  -- uh, yeah, SIXTY MINUTES.  But, uh, I've only watched it once.  Uh, like
I said, I've been in class --

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  -- and, uh, so during the week, uh, I don't have much time, and I spend a
lot of time [breathing] with, uh, my daughter on the weekend and she lives a
way away, so,

B.51:  Right.  Right. 

A.52:  uh, I'm, u-, we're not usually watching T V [laughter]. 

B.53:  Right. 

A.54:  But, uh, but it is interesting.  Uh, they, this time of year unfortunately,
it gets kind of, most of them are reruns and, you know --

B.55:  Right.

A.56:  -- stuff like that.  That's why I kind of stick to the [breathing] movies
if they're good.

B.57:  Uh-huh. 

A.58:  Uh, that one sounds good though, that was on last night, 

B.59:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.60:  I didn't get a chance to, I didn't get home till ten so [laughter].

B.61:  Right.  Well, that makes it hard. 

A.62:  Yeah.

B.63:  Yeah.  That was a good show.  Um, what else do I enjoy?  Oh, my wife
[breathing] and I have been into this, uh, L A LAW [laughter].

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  Have you ever heard of that show? 

A.66:  I've heard of it, I haven't watched it, uh, uh-huh.

B.67:  Yeah, it's getting pretty, you know, it's kind of like a DALLAS type thing,
you know, but it's more of, it, it takes place in L A, and it's this law
office, and all the cases they take and the, and the, uh, interoffice, uh, uh,
politics [breathing] and so forth, people trying to maneuver and get power and
back stabbing, and also helping each other and, [breathing] you know, if you
know all the lu-, interoffice love affairs, and --

A.68:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.69:  -- uh, all that, all that kind of stuff, and you know, power struggles to
see who's going to be the next, uh, uh, oh, president of the law firm or
whatever, and that kind of thing.  And, uh, and then, of course, they always
have a lot of court cases --

A.70:  Yeah.

B.71:  -- and they show where they actually have courtroom [breathing] drama,

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  type thing, where they're trying to, you know, you're always sitting there
trying to guess at the end of the show, you know, and they always have the
verdicts, you know, and you're always trying to out guess [breathing] is he
going to be guilty or innocent or whatever, and they always put, [breathing]
you know, twists and turns,

A.74:  [Lipsmack] I was just going to say, 

B.75:  twists, 

A.76:  [Laughter] Usually it's so twisted, [laughter] you know, it's hard.  Oh.

B.77:  and they throw a lot of twists and turns in, like, like one of the recent
shows there was this really, uh, [lipsmack] young woman who, uh, was accused
of killing her millionaire husband who was, you know, much older than she was,
like, you know, in her early twenties, and he was in his sixties, and --

A.78:  Uh-huh.

B.79:  -- he was, she was accused of killing him for his money, and she said, no,
she wasn't, and the, and this law firm took on the case, and got her off, um,
and, uh, and, you know, you think she's innocent all along, you know, and
just, you know, because of her circumstances that, you know, that's why people
thought she had done it, you know, because it just looked so obvious that she
had done it.

A.80:   Right.

B.81:  And that's why everybody assumed she had.  And so they get her off, and at
the very end of the case, after it's over, he's talking with her, and he
figures out that she really did do it after all [laughter].

A.82:  Oh, my gracious.  

B.83:  A-, uh,

A.84:  So what did he do then?  Ooh.

B.85:  after he got, after he got her off. 

A.86:  Yeah.  Well, 

B.87:  Well, that's how the show, 

A.88:  then they couldn't retry her.

B.89:  that's how the show ended.  

A.90:  Oh, 

B.91:  It just left you hanging there like -- 

A.92:  Oh [laughter].

B.93:  -- you know, like you set me up.  You fed me all this in-, information, you
know, that made it look like this other person was guilty, you know, and --

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  -- and that's how he basically got her off, by, by casting a shadow of
doubt, saying, well, this other, his daughter did it, you know, and because
this other will was, had her name on it, you know, and all this kind of stuff,
but actually, she had done it after all and,

A.96:   Oh, my good-, oh. 

B.97:  he figured it out after he made her innocent, and then that was right
before he was going out to the big news conference, you know, to talk to the
reporters and stuff, you know, and how does it feel, you know, to get her off
the hook,

A.98:  Yeah. 

B.99:  and this and that.  And they, he went out there knowing that she was really
guilty,

A.100:  Uh [laughter].

B.101:  [Laughter] so that kind of thing [breathing] so, it's a fun show.  Then I
like comedies also like, uh, [breathing] there's a show called, I watch
ROSANNE once in a while, uh, you, you've heard of her, probably.

A.102:  Oh, yes.  I don't watch, 

B.103:  Yeah.

A.104:  her anymore [breathing], 

B.105:  Yeah.

A.106:  not after that STAR SPANGLED BANNER thing [laughter].

B.107:  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah, I don't watch her that often.  I watch, sometimes I
watch THE SIMPSONS, that's that cartoon show --

A.108:  Uh-huh.  I've never watched that [breathing].

B.109:  -- [Breathing] Bart Simpson's or COACH is another one.  It's a sports
comedy, where the guy is a coach of a,

A.110:  I have watched that,

B.111:  a football team. 

A.112:  yeah, that's good. 

B.113:  A team at Minnesota State where they're, never have a good team, you know,
but he's always trying to, always trying to pull it off.  And he has his
girlfriend, the, that broadcasts, the anchor at the local news station, and
she's always trying to get him out of jams,

A.114:  [Laughter]. 

B.115:  and she, so, you know, whatever, whenever I have time I just turn it on,
basically, and see what's on.

A.116:  Yeah.  It's a nice way to relax.  I mean, 

B.117:  It is.

A.118:  in a way, I mean, I find it anyway, although, sometimes watching the news
isn't very relaxing [laughter].

B.119:  No, no. 

A.120:  I get home from, from class and everything and turn on the T V and watch
the news, early news, and it's like, [breathing] uh, I didn't really need to
watch that before I go to bed [laughter].

B.121:  Right.  Yeah. 

A.122:  Oh, [lipsmack].

B.123:  So, but I enjoy taking in a movie when I can.  I'm going to try to watch
the second, half of this one tonight.

A.124:  Yeah.  Well, see, that was, that's another thing, if I would have been home
I probably wouldn't have watched it,

B.125:  Yeah, [breathing] yeah, yeah.

A.126:  because I have class tonight, and I would have missed the second half, and
that's the most frustrating, [laughter] because that's, you know, you can, if
you missed the first half,

B.127:  Yeah.

A.128:  you can kind of catch up.  They catch you up, 

B.129:  They catch you up, and the,

A.130:  you know, with the second one, but if you miss the second half, you've
missed the whole,

B.131:  Right.

A.132:  [Laughter] you know, outcome, 

B.133:  Right.  Do you have like a, a V C R,

A.134:  and, oh, it's frustrating.

B.135:  where you could, tape it or something, on the record mode?  Or on the ti-,

A.136:  No, I don't, 

B.137:  Yeah.

A.138:  unfortunately.  We have cable but that's one thing I need to, we had one,
but it broke down.

B.139:  It broke down, yeah.

A.140:  So, uh, I haven't gotten another one, because I haven't, you know,

B.141:  Right.

A.142:  I haven't even rented movies to watch, [laughter] because,

B.143:  So little, so little time --

A.144:  Yeah.  

B.145:  -- to do that.

A.146:  But, uh, but perhaps when it's over I will, y-, you know, I, of course,

B.147:  Yeah, have a chance, more chance to relax. 

A.148:  Right, well, that's it.  I, but I have gotten, we have cable and so --

B.149:  Right. 

A.150:  -- um, that's,

B.151:  There's always a movie on [laughter].

A.152:  Yeah.  ((Sometimes)) I spend a lot of time on that.  Some movies that I
would never have gone and seen,

B.153:  You.

A.154:  uh, you know, have turned out to be really good movies.  Uh, --

B.155:  Right.

A.156:  -- you know, you hate to spend the money on them, [laughter] especially as
expensive as movie theaters are today.

B.157:  Right.  How much are they out there? 

A.158:  Uh, movies?  

B.159:  Yeah. 

A.160:  Oh, uh, it costs you six fifty to go to a movie, each --

B.161:  Six fifty, yeah. 

A.162:  -- a piece -- 

B.163:  Yeah.

A.164:  -- to go to, uh, a movie, unless you catch a good matinee. 

B.165:  I think out here they are still about five fifty -- 

A.166:  Uh-huh.

B.167:  -- about a dollar less.

A.168:  Well, uh, everything's high priced out here [laughter]. 

B.169:  [Laughter]. 

A.170:  [Laughter] But uh, uh,

B.171:  Things are going up all over too, yeah. 

A.172:  Yeah, uh, but I'd rather, you know watch it on, of course, the only problem
with cable, though, is it's, it's, is that they show the same one over about
five hundred times before [laughter] --

B.173:  Right. 

A.174:  -- you know, you don't get that many new ones in.  But, uh, [breathing]
uh, they have a lot of good, uh,

B.175:  Specials.

A.176:  my son likes to watch, uh, the sports station, you know,

B.177:  Uh-huh.  

A.178:  And, uh,

B.179:  Yeah, the all sports station.

A.180:  Right -- 

B.181:  Yeah.

A.182:  -- uh, you know, things like that.  So, [breathing] that's what makes it
worth it [breathing] --

B.183:  Right.

A.184:  -- uh, because he's handicapped, and he's at home all the time, so,

B.185:  I see.

A.186:  so, uh, uh, you know he enjoys that but, uh, um, I, [laughter].

B.187:  [Laughter].

A.188:  Like I said, T V isn't my best subject because, 

B.189:  Right.

A.190:  but I, I do enjoy a good comedy, a good movie is a comedy, if I can, you
know, sit down and, and watch, or if they have a good, uh, you know, show on
that's a good comedy.  I'm not real much for the sitcoms because of
[breathing] their, they need to have a new twist or something in some of
those,

B.191:  Uh-huh.

A.192:  you know they're getting all kind of the same. 

B.193:  The same, yeah, yeah.

A.194:  But, uh, uh, it's just,

B.195:  [Breathing] Well, [breathing] I think we've probably talked long enough
[laughter] about this subject.

A.196:  [Laughter] Uh, yes.

B.197:  [Laughter].

A.198:  Uh, okay.  Well, it was nice talking to you.

B.199:  Well, it was nice talking to you,

A.200:  And, uh,

B.201:  You have a nice day,

A.202:  Okay, you too.  

B.203:  Okay.

A.204:  Um, bye-bye now.

B.205:  Bye.
