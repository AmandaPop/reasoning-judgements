REMARKS:        There was a television in the background throughout the 
entire conversation. 

========================================================================

A.1:  [TV] Child care seems to be, uh, a, uh, a topic that various, I guess,
with where you are geographically.  If you're in an area where you got a lot
to select from, then, I guess, there are a lot of criterias to choose from,

B.2:  Yeah.  

A.3:  but if you're in an area where there's two or three then, uh, you get
what you can take.  And I guess it depend on the age of the child, the needs
of the child, how long the child has to be there, if it's a five day a week
deal I would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple a month.

B.4:  Oh, yeah.

A.5:  And, uh, we're in a situation where it's just one, maybe two days a month,
uh, at best so we're,

B.6:  Well, that's lucky.  

A.7:  in only a couple of hours usually what we're using them for now is to
transport between school and, and, uh, the day care center and have them wait
there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up.

B.8:  Yeah that's good.

A.9:  So it's nice to, uh, to just have them there for the limited time frame,
but the, uh, [lipsmack] the drawback is the pay structures there's so many
different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have, a
lot of the ones have just decided that they will simplify their work load by
saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay
ten dollars,

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  regardless of whether you road one way or both ways, 

B.12:  Oh.  

A.13:  and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three
hours [child_talking], they just averaged it all out,

B.14:  Wow.

A.15:  but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which
will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  And I've got, uh, one kid getting out at two forty-five and one getting out
at three thirty, so the one picked up at two forty-five gets there by about
three,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  and I'm there a little before four o'clock to pick them up.  So, he doesn't
stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when I get there
and [noise] doesn't get there until about four, it's about thirty minutes to
do a ten minute ride,

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  In there little bus.  And, so the, you know, just for the, doesn't really
work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one-way bus ride
for these two,

B.22:  Yeah, 

A.23:  kids, 

B.24:  I can see that.  

A.25:  but some days we have to do it, some days it just works out to where I
don't get into work early enough to get off early enough to get them,

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  But, uh, fortunately the other ends of the deal is some days my wife, uh,
being a dental hygienist works by appointments,

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  So she, if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the
day care to of them take them to school and she has, uh, uh, appointment say
at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at
eight thirty,

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and I'll get off in time
to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the
other direction.  But, uh, [breathing] just a myriad of, of possibilities that
these people have to serve, so they have a myriad of pay structures but, uh,

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  it can get expensive.  Most of them run, uh, [lipsmack] four some as many
as five dollars an hour per child,

B.34:  Uh.

A.35:  for, uh, what we call drop in care which is the situation we're in, we're
not a regular,

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  so, the days we do use them we pay through the nose, 

B.38:  Oh, I bet. 

A.39:  and, uh, and make their kids stay there.  We found on in the area that,
that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour, that's still five
dollars an hour for two of our kids.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  And it, it's, uh, fun we try to keep it to a minimum. 

B.42:  I be-, I, you'd have to. 

A.43:  Yeah, it's,   

B.44:  Uh, I when, when I, uh, I, I, I was, I was a commercial artist for almost
six years before, uh, we started our family and I looked into, uh, into child
care and, and were living in, we were living in Dallas, my husband was working
at the North building at the time and we just didn't like anything we saw.  We
really, I didn't want to leave an infant,

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  with the child care that was in the immediate area,

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  that we were, we were located in so, we, uh, we [laughter] tightened some
belt, belt loops,

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  and, uh, I just, I decided to stay home with, with her, and we're, we're
expecting our second child any day now, in fact I'm past due [laughter]. So,
so, I just, so we've been real pleased that ou-, that, that I, that I haven't
to, to use the, we haven't had to use day care.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  But, because what we found we just didn't like at all.

A.53:  Well, even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other
hurdles of the ratio of workers to, uh, kids, and, uh, the, uh, infant, wo-,
uh, worker areas, how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off
from the other noise,

B.54:  Yeah. 

A.55:  uh, once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it, uh,
it's not as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it
would cost you to go back to work,

B.56:  Right,

A.57:  and, you the, 

B.58:  that's exactly what it was with us.  It was just, it was, uh, we, all we
had to do was we pay off a vehicle early and then I would have just been
paying for, for that and, and child care was my, uh,

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.

B.60:  salary, and it wasn't worth it.   

A.61:  That's it. 

B.62:  So, it was, 

A.63:  Of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were
making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what
you do pay doesn't mean a hill of beans on your tax return.

B.64:  No, it's not. 

A.65:  Can't deduct it so what's it good for [laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  So, it's, it's gotten, it's changed a little bit over the years, but, uh,

B.68:  Yeah.  It is so expensive down here for a child care because we're
originally from Missouri and most of our family's still there,

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  and, uh, my husband's sister's have their kids in child care and it's a
lot less expensive then it is down here.

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  It's, um, it's, it's amazingly less expensive [laughter] than here.

A.73:  Yeah, what the market can bear. 

B.74:  Yeah, oh, it, oh, yeah. 

A.75:  And boy, there are kids in this little section of Plano that we're in,
we're surrounded, less than a mile we have six different centers to our, at
our disposal,

B.76:  Wow. 

A.77:  we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over
west a little bit further there's two more over there.  There's just all
around us, but, and we've been to everyone of them,

B.78:  That's lucky,

A.79:  over the time. 

B.80:  that's lucky. 

A.81:  But, the kids, uh, [breathing] the kids just, well, we used to use them a
little more than we do now that they're in school,

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  and the kids just kind of get tired of them.  They get tired of the, uh,
you know, what's available to play on and, uh, and what's outside,

B.84:  Really. 

A.85:  and plus they, they tend to just shift around in, in who runs them for a
while and the, uh, pay structure changes and [noise] so we've just moved with
wherever ch-, it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at
[laughter],

B.86:  [Laughter].

A.87:  and they want to live at this one for a while. 

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  And, uh, we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to, uh, take off
for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week,

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at, uh, eleven and
get's off at seven thirty at night.  [TV] And that, she does that on
Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  and I can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time t-, for her to
go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take vacation even if I,
uh, take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than, uh, right at a weeks
full, full, uh,

B.94:  Wow.

A.95:  full week's worth of vacation and I have, you know, three weeks a year,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  I been long enough to do that.  But I always end up in a must take
situation anyway, so,

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have
a few to, for whatever, week, long weekends, or the like, and I think we're
going to do that again this summer like we did last summer, because we paid
close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the
home,

B.100:  Ooo-eee.

A.101:  at a couple a dollars an hour to take care of them on those Thursdays
[breathing],

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  so, it, it's hard to, to find the prices, I guess, that does seem to be
one of the major driving factors.

B.104:  I know, oh, it is, it, it, it, pl-, plus, um, when we were in, in the
section of, uh, North Dallas over by Addison, there's just not hardly any day
care over there,

A.105:  Um.

B.106:  at all, it's surprising. 

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  Because when I was searching for it, the b-, the best place I could find in
the was down in Farmers Branch and I worked in Carrollton it just,

A.109:  Oh, boy. 

B.110:  and I was, I was going to have to drive and drive and drive and, and it
was just, it was just re-, there were just so many strikes against it, but
[breathing], but up here in McKinney there's, there's a few places, there's
li-, I think there's, I've seen two up here.

A.111:  Um.

B.112:  And there's really not very much. 

A.113:  Well, I guess they haven't had the, I don't know what the incentive would
be, but, um, I guess with ones all around the Plano area and figuring that
most of them drive south for their jobs,

B.114:  That's true.

A.115:  maybe they, maybe they've done it that way and gone with that logic.

B.116:  Oh, yeah, a lot of people drive into Dallas from here,

A.117:  Yeah. 

B.118:  a lots of them.  But,

A.119:  It must be on what they're counting on. 

B.120:  Yeah, Yeah.  I, I, I assume so [sniffing]. 

A.121:  Hum.  Well, I speaking of kids I've one hollering at me so,

B.122:  Okay [laughter]. 

A.123:  I better head on, 

B.124:  Okay, 

A.125:  well,

B.126:  well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.127:  Cross paths later. 

B.128:  Bye. 

A.129:  Bye.
