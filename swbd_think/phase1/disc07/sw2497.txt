REMARKS:        There were some people talking in the background of Speaker
The speakers talked over each other a good bit.

============================================================================

A.1:  (( )) I think my daughter [screeching] talked to somebody in Carolina.
What is that, is it a school up there that, uh [/screeching],

B.2:  Yeah, North Carolina State.  

A.3:  Oh, great, great, that's wonderful.  Yeah,

B.4:  Yeah, yeah, I, I didn't know that we were going to be talking to mostly T I
folks.  I thought it was all scattered out among graduate schools or
something.

A.5:  Is that right?  

B.6:  Yeah. 

A.7:  Yeah, we, uh, we thought the opposite, we thought, well it's going to be T
I people, and I think they went to customers, you know, people,

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  that use T I computers and everything, which is fine [breathing].

B.10:  Yeah, one of, one of our professors went down to a seminar you guys had,
uh, sometime last year,

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12: and got the information and brought it back and,

A.13:  Actually they don't talk about much, uh, of what it's for, but my wife
keeps keeps ask, asking me, and I'm saying well, your computer is eventually
going to just answer your voice, you know,

B.14:  That's right.

A.15:  they're, they're, of course, it's very obvious for people with handicaps,

B.16:  Sure.

A.17:  but, in general, I guess it would be faster --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- than typing and everything so,

B.20:  you, you, yeah, you could just sit there and talk.

A.21:  Oh, yeah, it's, it's, uh, around the corner. 

B.22:  Reminds me of something I read in an Isaac Asimov science fiction thing
[breathing] one time [laughter].

A.23:  Right.  Well, I mean it's so, uh, T I's, uh, been the pioneer on, a little
advertising for T I,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  not that I know that much about the, uh, voice synthesis, but they've been
working on it for years and years, you know,

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  they have the Speak and Spell and all of that, of course --

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  -- but they're, they're going to take it much further and, I guess, in
aircraft and all that.  A lot of it is going to be like you talk to the
computer like TWO THOUSAND AND ONE or TWO THOUSAND AND TEN,

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  when you talk,

B.32:  Yeah, 

A.33:  to the computer.

B.34:  like Hal.

A.35:  Hal, right. 

B.36:  Yeah. 

@A.37:  [Laughter] That was great.  Well, what do you think about the metric
system?  You, well what do you do out there?

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  Are you a professor, you say?

B.40:  No.  I'm a, I'm a student here.

A.41:  Okay.

B.42:  Um, yeah, I think we should adopt it.  I, I think we're a little bit
backward as far as the rest of the world's concerned.  Um, I know it causes a
problem for industry in a li-, in a small way, but nothing that won't be
overcome in a little bit of time.

A.43:  Yeah, well, we're not going to have much to fight over because I do too,
uh, being an engineer.  Most, General Motors have pretty much, and I'm not too
sure about the rest of the cars, I'm sure all the Japanese cars,

B.44:  Oh, yeah. 

A.45:  I'm somewhat of a car buff [breathing].  Almost all of it is metric.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  What, what, what bothers the heck out of me is, uh, one of these
so-called American made cars, {pause} where part of it's put together in Japan
--

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and what you've got is you've got standard and metric.  You know, you go
in there with a wrench, and you know, oh, golly,

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  it's not a metric, it's a standard. 

A.51:  Right.  Well, I, I work on G M cars only, and I haven't noticed that, that
much.  Usually the metrics will fit.  They're so close there's an overlap.

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  [Breathing] Uh, you know, there's something funny that I haven't really
resolved with metric.  I've got to really go to the store and see if it's
true.  I can't remember the size.  I think it's, uh, eighteen or something
like that.  I have a set of metric and, and the old wrenches too, and I think
that's an exact size of the three-quarters, and they don't make it in metric.
They just skip over it.

B.54:  Yeah,  

A.55:  And,

B.56:  you're right, you're right,

A.57:  it, 

B.58:  because mine goes from seventeen to nineteen. 

A.59:  Right. 

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  And I was thinking I've got to get an eighteen,

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  because I don't, I don't like, I'm so used to, when I'm
grabbing tools for my car, to grab for the number, you know? 

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  Because I don't even bother with the, unless I'm working on a bumper or
something, but the engine parts and all are all metric, you know?

B.66:  Yeah, a friend of mine's got a, a Colt, and I was doing something to it,
and golly, half of it was standard and half of it was metric.

A.67:  ((I haven't noticed)), 

B.68:  ((It was the)),

A.69:  it mostly being,

B.70:  most irritating thing.  

A.71:  Yeah, well, I mean, well, on General Motors cars it was all metric.  I use
my metrics, essentially, when I work on the cars, I don't, well, I guess, uh,
in changing the oil, I guess, that's, uh, I don't even know, a nine-sixteenths
or something like that, I don't even remember.

B.72:  Yeah, 

A.73:  Uh,

B.74:  I don't either, I can't convert them.  I'm hope,

A.75:  But I was thinking I just had a cheap set of metrics.  In fact, uh, I
thought, well, I guess either I lost the eighteen,

B.76:  [Laughter].  

A.77:  and then I, I started to see it in stores, and I noticed that the cheaper
sets, again, I'm calling it cheaper sets minus the eighteen.  I thought, well,
I've got to go to an expensive place, go to Sears and get Craftsman tools
there, and see if I can't get that eighteen.  I want a full set, you know,

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  I still haven't checked out to see if they do make the eighteen,

B.80:  They don't.  

A.81:  I, I'm sure they do. 

B.82:  Uh, you think so?  I've, I've,

A.83:  Well, I guess they do. 

B.84:  I've never seen one.  

A.85:  I don't know why they wouldn't.  

B.86:  I've never seen one.

A.87:  Oh, you haven't?  Really? 

B.88:  I've never seen one.

A.89:  I just thought it was my set, so I just didn't have a, a good quality set,
you know.

B.90:  No, as a matter of fact, I don't think, is there a sixteen? 

A.91:  [Breathing].

B.92:  I don't think,

A.93:  Uh,  

B.94:  there's a sixteen either. 

A.95:  [Lipsmack] I think it's, what number did I just say?  Eighteen, something
that is the same as a three-quarter, and it, that, I, I'd rather have it all
metric.

B.96:  Yeah, I would too.  I mean we, we're just about the last holdout in the
world to,

A.97:  Right.  

B.98:  to hold on to this old, archaic system.  I mean even England's gone metric.

A.99:  Te-, uh, Texas Instruments makes equipment for the semiconductor business.
You know, we make not a lot of, but we make, we were making a lot of our own
manufacturing equipment, and I bet they have a lot of metrics there.  I think
that, uh, the only emotional part might be in miles, you know, mile signs.

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  But that's, that could be last anyway.  Maybe pick a year, two thousand,
say, Okay, we'll slowly change.  But I think,

B.102:  Yeah, and, and even changing the things, I mean, first off, I, I mean, you
need to address do you even need to change the signs?

A.103:  Right. 

B.104:  Because for so long people are going, are going to be able to equate miles
to kilometers,

A.105:  Right.  

B.106:  I mean, when you drive around Europe you do the same thing. 

A.107:  Well, I think the speedometers, don't the cars have them both now?  Am I
not mistaken?  I, I, I look at mine, I don't even know.  I read it,

B.108:  Yeah, most of them do.  They have the, uh,

A.109:  Upper and lower, yeah. 

B.110:  yeah, they have the, the kilometer inside and the, and of course, the miles
per hour great big so you can see it.

A.111:  Right. 

B.112:  Uh, yeah, I, I, I, it's silly.  I don't, I don't think that we ought to be
any different,

A.113:  Oh, no, 

B.114:  it causes a lot of problems, 

A.115:  I don't think so either.  

B.116:  a lot of times between, uh, different countries in their manufacturing
stuff and,

A.117:  I don't even know how many businesses are actually doing it without an
order.  I'm not too sure that the government needs to order it, although, I
guess they would have to in, again, mileage signs but, uh, it,

B.118:  Well, you know, even, even, uh, interstate signs and stuff, you, you can
reprint the number of kilometers,

A.119:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.120:  on, on that reflective, uh, stick on,

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  tape stuff that they use to, uh, stick on those things, and they can, ju-,
all, that's all they have to do.  I mean, that wouldn't cost a great deal of
money.

A.123:  Uh-huh. 

B.124:  And, uh, I, I, I just don't see any problems with it.  I think it's just,
uh, obstinate Americanism.

A.125:  Oh, yeah.  I think that I, I guess it was, uh, five years ago or more than
when they, it failed,

B.126:  Uh-huh.  

A.127:  and I guess people just got tired of talking about it.  I'm not too sure, I
guess there was no one really pushing it, and no one saying that it was going
to mean business to us.  I think nowadays we all would say, who are in
industry and everything, we'd say, Hey, this means business, we ought to,

B.128:  That's right. 

A.129:  uh, make everything metric,

B.130:  That's right.  

A.131:  and I just, and I see no problem with it at all.

B.132:  Exactly right.  I mean, 

A.133:  Uh, 

B.134:  I mean, I, I, I can think of one, for instance, you take a, you take a
textile industry, and they're selling stuff by the, by the yard,

A.135:  Uh-huh. 

B.136:  you know?

A.137:  Right, yeah.

B.138:  Now, now there's a big difference between a yard and a meter when you're
talking about fabric.

A.139:  Right. 

B.140:  [Laughter] and I don't, 

A.141:  Well, I, I, I'm ready to convert.  I, I, we probably all thought it was
strange, you know, again, five years ago, but I don't think there's that many
people with reservations anymore,

B.142:  No, I mean, 

A.143:  I don't know if, uh,

B.144:  look at all the, all the food containers are labeled, 

A.145:  Sure.

B.146:  uh, with both systems,

A.147:  Right.  

B.148:  I mean, that's no problem. 

A.149:  In fact they said it failed, and then, I guess it has failed, but I, in, in
general, there was still a lot of people that, I, I, I'm not sure it's a total
failure, because so much has converted, you know?

B.150:  Yeah well, 

A.151:  and I'm not too sure that it's actually not a success more than a failure,
you know?  I don't know what percent has actually converted.

B.152:  Yeah, I, I, I just, I just chock it up to this obstinate Americanism,
because [breathing] they sit there and, and they just don't want to learn a
new system.

A.153:  Uh-huh. 

B.154:  You know, it's just like they, they won't learn foreign languages.  They go
some,

A.155:  Oh, you're absolutely right.  

B.156:  you know, they expect everybody to speak English. 

A.157:  You, that, that's a pet of mine too.  I just wish we all and us down here
in Texas, of course, should all speak Spanish.

B.158:  Yeah. 

A.159:  We should have six and eight years automatically,

B.160:  Sure.  

A.161:  of Spanish, and I, I push my daughters, I've got two daughters and, uh,
one is taking Latin, and one has taken Spanish but not enough of it, and, uh,
I think we, we down here especially,

B.162:  Sure.  

A.163:  should speak,

B.164:  Sure.  

A.165:  and California, New Mexico and all that, really.

B.166:  I mean, you, you look around at all these other countries, I mean, I mean,
you look at Japan.  Not only do they learn the metric system, they also learn
the, our system.

A.167:  Right, right. 

B.168:  You know, and, and they also take three languages [laughter].  I mean,

A.169:  Oh, yeah.

B.170:  well, I mean, it's no wonder that we're getting beat out on everything in
the world because those people, those other people out there are working.

A.171:  Yeah they're working.  They're out, they're studying harder,

B.172:  Yeah, I mean, 

A.173:  and they're working harder.

B.174:  look who's taking the, the engineering jobs, 

A.175:  [Talking] {people in background}.

B.176:  and the, and the math jobs, and the science jobs.

A.177:  Uh-huh. 

B.178:  You know, they're all Orientals.  I mean, we've got loads of, uh, Asians
here in school just like we do at every other school around this country.

A.179:  Yeah.  What are you taking in school [/talking] by the way, you say you're
in school.

B.180:  Uh, what am I taking? 

A.181:  Yeah. 

B.182:  Uh, Masters in public administration. 

A.183:  Oh, well, you know, my wife's, uh, a well, I have a daughter in college,
you know, and, uh, who's got, down at U T, University of Texas, I mean, and my
wife also has gone back for a teaching and English, and English as a second
language, uh, which is, you know, just teaching kids that are, [breathing]
have, have their native language, and not English.

B.184:  Right, yeah. 

A.185:  And so she's going back for that.  And so, I, I, I've got three people I'm
supporting in, in school now, and I guess I ought to go back myself,

B.186:  [Laughter].  

A.187:  I'm getting enthusiastic because they, they're having so much fun, you
know?  [laughter].

B.188:  Uh, I, I don't hold out much hope for anything coming out of this Masters.
I, I'm taking it more or less just because I'm interested in it, but I'm, I'm
also taking a, uh, paralegal course,

A.189:  Oh, that's great.  

B.190:  and I, I really want to do that more than anything else.  I, I went to law
school for a year and a half --

A.191:  Uh-huh. 

B.192:  -- and, uh, decided, well, I don't really want to be a lawyer.

A.193:  Uh-huh.

B.194:  I mean, I knew that going in, I just wanted a law degree because it would
open all kinds of doors --

A.195:  Uh-huh. 

B.196:  -- but it's just too much work for a, uh, a degree you're going to hang on
the wall and never use.

A.197:  Yeah. 

B.198:  So I said, well, maybe I ought to save some money here [laughter], so I
got out of that and got back into the Masters and then decided, well,
paralegal is really the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what I really
like.

A.199:  Sure, politics and everything,

B.200:  Yeah. 

A.201:  You ought to do what you like. Uh, y-, I'm an engineer, and even when I was
going through engineering school halfway through they said, Up, don't need
any more engineers,

B.202:  [Laughter].  

A.203:  we've got too many.  They go through this phase all the time but I think
you still should do what you want,

B.204:  Sure. 

A.205:  because, uh, if you're good, at whatever you are,

B.206:  Yeah I mean,   

A.207:  you know, and there's employment.
