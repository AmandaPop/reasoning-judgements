============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay, exercise is something that I don't do enough of and I have an
incredible, uh, set-up at home that I, that I have available to me that I
should use, and um, in fact, I'm trying to get back into it this week.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  I have a tr-, treadmill, and a, a exercise bicycle, plus a dog I could go
walk.  [laughter] And a whole lot of things like that.

A.5:  [Laughter]  Well, it sounds like you're, you have the stuff there.

B.6:  I have the stuff there, I don't have the motivation all the time.

A.7:  Yeah [breathing].

B.8:  So, how about you?

A.9:  Well, I, uh, go to aerobics twice a week which I started a little over a
year ago.

B.10:  Oh, that's good.

A.11:  And, I, I think that's probably pretty good for me, um, I, part of my
incentive when I started was to try to lose a few pounds, because, I had a
special reason, you know, I wanted to, 

B.12:  Uh-huh, uh-huh {softly}.

A.13:  and, had a lot of motivation, whi-, and I did, but then, you know, I just
gradually {pause} come back up a few pounds anyway, which is no big deal.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  I'm not over weight or anything, but you know how you always want to lose
a few.

B.16:  Yeah.  Uh, never happy.

A.17:  And, I've found that now, I, I think, if I didn't do the aerobics then
I'd probably have to do something else because I'd probably gain weight, you
know,

B.18:  Yeah that's,

A.19:  because I,

B.20:  the one thing about if you exercise enough or, or even a, a moderate
amount, you don't really have to be that concerned about your diet, if you
just eat normally and don't over eat.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  But, you can, because if you don't exercise, then it seems like, um, wh-,
you just have to be really, really careful about what you eat.  You can, you
can eat like a normal person if you get a moderate amount of exercise,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  and not really have to worry about it.

A.25:  Well, I've never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but,

B.26:  Really.

A.27:  you know, I feel guilty all the time, because, oh, I shouldn't be eating
that [laughter].

B.28:  Well, you must, you must not have a weight problem at all.

A.29:  Not really, uh, I mean, I would just like to be, you know, five or six
pounds thinner, but I don't consider that to be that big a deal.

B.30:  No, oh, no.  But, how often do you go to aerobics?  

A.31:  Twice a week.

B.32:  You do, and you've been pretty faithful about that?

A.33:  Yes, uh, in fact, I probably haven't missed more than five or six times in,
as I say, about a year and three months.

B.34:  And, that's for an hour each time you go?

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  Well that, that's good.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  That's really good.

A.39:  I, I think it's, you know, at first it, it was kind of a drag, because I
was not used to doing that much of anything, and, um, I had been going to
school and doing a lot of just, you know, sitting and studying, and, and,
really not working out at all,

B.40:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.41:  but, uh, now as long as I keep going, it's, it's not that difficult to
do.  And, I can see where, you know, different muscles and things are in
better shape.

B.42:  Oh, my muscles are horrible, that's the main reason I really ought to be
doing something like that, because mine's not, so, so much, uh, weight, I
mean, I have, I, I, if I had, if I lost ten pounds, I'd think of myself as
nice and thin, but, uh, most of it is just, you know, it's just in bad shape.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  So, but I, it was, I, I know how, I felt so tired last week and yesterday
was for the first time in a, in quite a while, I took my dog for a walk, and
it was incredible how much more energy and how much better I felt last night.

A.45:  Oh, really?
				   
B.46:  So, uh, you know, if a, if you can just remember even though you don't, I
don't particularly enjoy it at the time,

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  the benefits are just, uh, just, you know, far, far out weigh the,

A.49:  Yeah, there's so-, sometimes when I go to aerobics and I get all hot, you
know, it's too warm in this place where we go, and everything, and I'm
thinking, why am I doing this,

B.50:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.51:  but, like I say, it just kind of becomes a habit. {Phone ringing in
background} An i-, if you don't break that cycle very often, 

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  then you keep doing it.

B.54:  Well, it sounds like you're, you're, uh, you know, got it, got it well in
hand.  I, I just, I go great guns for a few weeks and then I, something
happens that disrupts my schedule and then I just find excuses and the next
thing you know, you're not doing anything.

A.55:  Yeah.  Well, I think one thing too, that makes this easier for me is that
I, uh, do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to
drive up there.

B.56:  Um.

A.57:  If I had to go, you know, several miles, if it took me ten or fifteen or
twenty minutes each way, I probably would quit doing it.

B.58:  Do you go right after work?

A.59:  No, uh, in fact that's kind of, uh, one of the things that's funny about
it is, I go at eight o'clock at night.

B.60:  Really?

A.61:  Yeah.  And, you'd think, well, who wants to get up and go then,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  but, um, it's really not been that much of a problem.

B.64:  So it's during the week?

A.65:  Yeah, 

B.66:  You go during the week.

A.67:  yeah.  Well my husband and I were also doing quite a bit of walking,
but we got off of that a little bit.  Mostly, you know, with the winter months
and all,

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  it seems like there are too many reasons that you can't go, because of
the weather and things and.

B.70:  Does he go to, have an exercise program too?

A.71:  Not really and he needs to, but, uh, he's a C P A, so at the moment he's
snowed under, 

B.72:  Oh.

A.73:  until after tax season, but I am definitely going to get him back on
something because he has a few, kind of, nagging health things that I think,
you know, some more exercise would help.

B.74:  So, yours is a class, an aerobics class that you go to?

A.75:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.76:  But some men, I guess, are not too comfortable doing that but,

A.77:  Yeah, we've had a couple of them in the class and, oh, uh, they have kind
of stuck with it.  One of them though has been coming with his girl friend and
they're about to get married in a couple of weeks, so it might be interesting
to see if they stick with it [laughter].

B.78:  [Laughter].

A.79:  But, um, I also swim quite a bit in the summer time.

B.80:  Gosh, you wor-, you sound like my sister.  I have a sister in Nevada who,
who is really int-, I mean, she's very athletic anyway, she always has been.
She was the athletic person in the family, and she swims, and she, you know,
cross country skis, and does all this stuff.  It sounds like, you sound like
the same type.

A.81:  Well, I'm not gung ho, you know, I, but I'm not opposed to any of, of, you
know, 

B.82:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.83:  kinds of things, I just don't do a lot of them.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  You know, it's tough to, to work everything in that you want to accomplish
and I have a lot of other interests.

B.86:  Yeah.  Well, uh, it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests
[laughter], but we just have to talk about exercise so.

A.87:  [Laughter]  Well.

B.88:  Well, keep up the good work and I'm going to, I'm going too.  I'm
going,

A.89:  Well, you'll have to start working on your machines, because that's nice
that you have those things.

B.90:  Well, I told a friend of mine, whose got a real, she really does have a
weight problem, well, I have an exercise bike that's sitting over here that's
collecting dust, and I, I have my treadmill, and I have a rowing machine and a
trampoline, I said, I'll come over this afternoon and you can borrow the, the
ex-, the exercise bicycle, 

A.91:  Yeah,

B.92:  at least maybe it will get some use, so, um, you know, we're going to try
to, she's got about fifty pounds that she needs to lose, so, you know, even
though that sounds, that's bad it, it may be easier for her to lose that, for
me to lose te-, then for me to lose ten.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  So, I'm, I'm going to, you know, try to help her and that will kind of help
to get me, you know, make me want to do things too.

A.95:  Yeah.  That might be good.  

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  I have a friend who, uh, needed to lose a lot of weight and she and, uh,
another friend of hers decided to start walking and they were doing, I don't
know, several miles each night.  And, boy, she really got the weight off.

B.98:  Really?

A.99:  Yeah.  Really.

B.100:  Yeah, kind o-, kind of having, uh, uh, a buddy or somebody to kind of stir 
you on, and, and you know, keep your motivation level up too,

A.101:  Well, yeah.

B.102:  I think sometimes might help.  So I was thinking maybe your husband
would, you know, maybe the two of you all (( )) if he had, come on let's go,
or you, you know, and you all kind of did it together, in a way that helps.

A.103:  Yeah, it, it helps a lot with the walking, because, otherwise, it's just
plain boring,

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  uh, to me, at least.  I don't like to go out by myself.  But, that's when
we do the most talking, and, you know, about things that have taken place
during the day,

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  and all sorts of things that I don't think, you know, we typically do.
[laughter]  We don't take that much time to talk.

B.108:  Well, maybe if the, with the weather getting so nice and after,

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  you come home from aerobics make him go for a walk with you [laughter]
while you cool down.

A.111:  Well, I enjoyed talking to you.

B.112:  Well, you too.

A.113:  All right, bye-bye.

B.114:  Bye.
