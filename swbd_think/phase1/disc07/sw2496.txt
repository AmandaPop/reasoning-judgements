A.1:  Okay, Maureen, uh, could you tell me what type of, uh, dining out that you
like to do?

B.2:  Well, we're probably different from you folks.  Down here we're into, uh,
Mexican or Tex-Mex or something like that.  That tends to be one of my
favorites is to go out to uh, have some Mexican food.  We have like, um, El
Chico's and one new place, uh, that's pretty good is uh, Pappasito's, so when
I go out and I like to splurge on eating, I usually like to go out and get
some Mexican food, and make sure there's a basket of chips keeps being
[laughter], replenished on the table.

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  Is that, that's because you're, you're natives there and that's what you're
used to,

B.6:  No.

A.7:  you, you've grown up that way? 

B.8:  No, I'm not a native here, actually, um, from Philadelphia, originally, and
lived in, uh, Ohio for, you know, a good portion of time going to high school
and college there.  So I've been down here for about eight years, but, uh, I
don't know, that's just something that I really picked up on, I really did
like the Mexican food.  The other thing I like, I guess, um, I don't eat it as
often, is maybe Italian food.  We don't have as many places around here to eat
Italian food, but [breathing],

A.9:  Yeah, right.

B.10:  I like Italian food. 

A.11:  Yeah, we've got a place down at Providence that's, that's called Federal
Hill, and it's all the old, old Italians, and they've got some real nice
restaurants down there.

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  But what we usually like to do is, is go out and, and have something that
we normally don't have at home.

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  Like you can have, uh, naturally we've got a lot of fish up here, you know,
--

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  -- and shellfish, and, because we live right on the coast, but that's
readily available, and we can usually have that at home or we usually throw a
steak on our, on the grill or something,

B.18:  Um. 

A.19:  but when we go out to, to eat, we like to go to a better restaurant.  I
like, I like jacket and tie, um, you know, when you go out to dine --

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  -- it's, we kind of make a night of it. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  But we try to order something that we don't usually have around the house.

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  And as far as, um, Mexican type, we've got, the only thing up here that we
have anywhere close to that is Taco Bell.

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  That's not too close to the real thing [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's what I say, because I, I just, last month I spent
a week in Dallas.

B.30:  Oh, yeah? 

A.31:  Yeah.  That I H and laser seminar that they had, I don't know,

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  if you've seen the book.  And then some of the local guys down there,
they, they took me out to all of these places, you know, and it's, it's
really, uh, it's unique, and I think, I don't know if it's psychological or
not, but I think the beef down there is out, out of this world.

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  We, we just don't get the quality up here like, like you have.

B.36:  Where did you go for it?  Did you go like to Hoffbrau Steaks?

A.37:  No.  We went to, uh, uh, uh, I, we stayed at the Park, Park Plaza, Park
Suites?

B.38:  Park Suite, yeah, right across the street, yeah.  

A.39:  Yeah, so we ate there one night, and then we went to, uh, Picci's {phonetic
spelling} one night and had Italian.

B.40:  Um.

A.41:  You know where that is?  Over in, um, can't really tell you what part of
the, what part of the town it was in.

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  But it was, it's supposedly known, it was up by one of the colleges, anyhow
--

B.44:  Um. 

A.45:  -- and that was in the middle of the week, and it was, it was, you had to
wait in line to get in.

B.46:  Um. 

A.47:  Like I said, it was noted for, you know, it's food. 

B.48:  And what was the name of it? 

A.49:  Picci's {phonetic spelling}. 

B.50:  Um, okay.

A.51:  And then, uh, oh, no, let's see, I went someplace.  I can't remember the
name of it, some other place we went, um, [smack] but we went to one and they
serve you, I mean, the hamburger was a pound of meat.  And the hamburger, I
know it was, it was a,

B.52:  [Laughter]. 

A.53:  huge loaf of bread,

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  I couldn't believe it. 

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  [Laughter] I thought if this is the size of a hamburger down here, ((I'll
order)) hamburger.

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  And then we went to some fast-food places that, you know, during, during
lunch.

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  We went out to some of those, and it was good.  It was, um, [smack] I like
Mexican food, I like the burritos and all that, but I don't like the sp-, the
hot.  I,

B.62:  Yeah. 

A.63:  like it spicy, but I don't like it, I don't like it hot, you know, where
you, your roof of your head's blown off.

B.64:  Last night we went out and people we were with, she, uh, had fajitas, and
she had this pepper on the plate, and maybe she thought it was a sweet pepper,
but [laughter] it wasn't, and she ate it, and I was wondering why her eyes
were watering [laughter].

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter] she, and she had drank all her iced tea.  And she [laughter],

A.67:  Right, and, and it doesn't make any difference, either.  If you, if you eat
some of that stuff, and you can drink a gallon and it doesn't seem to put out
the fire but,

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  And some people like that.  Me, it,

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  it seems like, I don't know, how about you?  Do you like the extremely,

B.72:  No, no. 

A.73:  hot? 

B.74:  I, I can maybe eat some jalapenos but I really don't, you know, ask for
those on there.  I'm more like into the enchiladas, and, and stuff like that,
but no, I don't really like it hot.  Um, I remember meeting somebody a long
time ago, before I ever moved to Texas, and he put hot sauce on everything he
ate.  I mean, Tabasco's, and that kind of stuff,

A.75:  Uh. 

B.76:  on everything he ate.  I think he must've just had a, a stomach that was
iron or something [laughter] [breathing].

A.77:  Yeah, yeah.  That's incredible.  That, and, um, I'm afraid to take the
chance when I go down there to eat a meal like that --

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  -- because once you get it, what are you going to do with it?  If it,

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  if it's too hot, and I'm not sure if, you know, if when they cook down
there, if they automatically just do that.  They throw a couple of red peppers
in it, and,

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  you know, in the, the sauce, because that's what they're used to.

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  And up here, we're not really, well some people are, I guess, up here.  I
mean, they'll eat fire.  But I'm just not, I'm not, I don't mind the spices, I
love garlic and all the rest of that, but,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  the hot stuff, oh.

B.88:  [Laughter]. 

A.89:  And that's all you mainly do then, right?  Italians?  How about, uh,
Chinese?

B.90:  Well, those are my two favorites.

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  You know. 

A.93:  You go out for Chinese at all? 

B.94:  Uh, yeah, yeah, there's one favorite place that we have called August Moon
that's, that's pretty good, and, uh, I've got one thing on the menu that I
really love, but, um, we don't do that probably as often.  We used to do a, a
quick, take out kind of place that wasn't real great Chinese, but we used to
do, we just liked vegetable fried rice quite a bit.

A.95:  Oh, yeah, yeah. 

B.96:  Just, you know, as a quick kind of dinner thing, that's, [breathing], you
know, it's not real filling, but, you know, get some veggies and rice and
stuff.

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  [Breathing] Every once in a while we go out to a little bit nicer Chinese
place.

A.99:  That's what we'll do, we'll take some, we'll take, take out like sometimes
on the weekend, um, like snacks.

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  You know, like, uh, beef teriyaki or, or chicken fingers or that type of
thing.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  Uh, egg rolls or fried rice, because it's easier to get out than to make
it.  [breathing] uh, we'll do that occasionally.  [breathing] um, do you go
out as much now, as, uh, because the economy being such?  Has that,

B.104:  [Breathing]. 

A.105:  put a damper on you or does it make any difference?

B.106:  [Smack] Um, [breathing] well, recently we've both been trying to do some
diet, so we haven't gone out,

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  because when they tell you about how much fat is in all that food, you
know, it really kind of crimps your style there.  But, um, [smack] we
probably, you know, maybe go out like once a week on the weekend, usually with
friends or something, we kind of go out.  Um, not always, you know, sometimes
we cook the meal at home and have people in.

A.109:  Oh, yeah. 

B.110:  [Breathing] But I haven't really thought about, you know, the economy all
that much, and, and eating out.  We, we never really did it a lot but,
[breathing] you know, we do maybe go out a couple of times a month at least,

A.111:  Yeah, you know,

B.112:  to eat out. 

A.113:  up here it's, it's, the restaurant business has fallen off --

B.114:  Um.

A.115:  -- uh, pretty substantially, because the, the unemployment rate is pretty
high.

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  It's, uh, in Massachusetts it's almost ten percent now.

B.118:  [Smack] Oh.

A.119:  So, people don't have the discretionary incomes that they had, you know,

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  overtime has been cut back a lot in certain areas, but us, I mean, we
still, we live more or less like you, and our kids are grown up and they're
gone, so it's just the two of us, and, uh, [breathing] we tend to go out maybe
once a week,

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  Maybe once every other week, something like that.  [breathing] but we'll,
we'll go out for, uh, uh, take out --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- and bring it home [breathing].  Um, but it hasn't, it hasn't, it, uh,
it hasn't stopped us yet.

B.126:  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  And I was just wondering down there.  It hasn't done anything to you
either, so, your economy is a little bit better though, I think, down there
now.  Well,

B.128:  Well, though, you know, T I has laid off quite a few in this area, and then
General Dynamics has its woes too, so that, it seems like there's,

A.129:  Oh, okay, so there's,

B.130:  been a lot of people recently, you know, when big companies, uh, change
their programs, and, and such, that there's been an influx of some unemployed,
but probably, when you spread it out over everybody in Dallas, it maybe has
not changed the percentage all that much.  You know, maybe,

A.131:  Yeah. 

B.132:  one or two percent, possibly, it's hard to say. 

A.133:  Yeah. 

B.134:  It just seems like a lot when you hear about companies that keep
continually advertising or stating that they're, you know, you know, cutting
out so many thousands of employees, it sounds like big numbers --

A.135:  Right. 

B.136:  -- of people out there.

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  That's true. 

A.139:  And it depends on life styles too down there.  I'm not sure if, if you all
tend to go out more down there than we do up here or, or if we tend to go out
more.

B.140:  I think the people down here must shop for entertainment, because we have
more shopping malls within close proximity.  I mean, [laughter] it's like we
could have shopping malls even across the road from each other.  There must be
a lot of people with a lot of money who just like to go out and shop, because
we have plentitude of shopping malls within like a five mile radius.  I {fade
out}.
