REMARKS:        Speaker B was a heavy breather at times.  Also, she mumbled and
was somewhat muffled, especially when both sides are played together.
==============================================================================

@A.1:  What movies have, uh, have you seen lately?

B.2:  Well, the last movie I saw was GHOSTS.  I, there's a lot out that I'd like
to see, I just don't have much opportunity.

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  I have a small child, and it's, gets so expensive [laughter].

A.5:  Well, that's true, that's true, #if you have to get a baby-sitter and
everything else, yeah.#

B.6:  #But, you have to either#, yeah, so, but, uh, what have you seen?

A.7:  Uh, [clicking] I've seen GHOSTS, we really enjoyed that.  

B.8:  Yeah. I thought that was pretty good.

A.9:  I thought that was a good movie.  And, uh, about a week ago we went out and
saw, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  And, I guess I'm just not smart enough to figure that movie out.  That was
just, uh, uh, I don't know, I r-, I didn't really enjoy it that much.

B.12:  I have a friend who saw that and told me, said I don't want, said don't go
see it, it, because you won't be able to sleep but,

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  I don't know, from all I've read about it, I, I, I really think I'd i-, I'd
like to see it.

A.15:  [Talking] I think it, you know, it probably was a good movie.  I just, uh,
really didn't get into it that much.  But, uh, everybody I've talked to has
just loved it and,

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  they want to go back and see it, 

B.18:  Really?  Um.

A.19:  you know, two or three times.  But, uh, there's a lot of little things
that go on in the movie, that you have to, uh,

B.20:  Really?  Yeah.

A.21:  really pay attention to, uh, to get the total gist of it. But,

B.22:  Well, I do, I enjoy going to the movies and I ta-, I try to, there, we have
a dollar theater, I don't know, where, d-, are you in Dallas, or?

A.23:  Uh, yeah, in Dallas.

B.24:  Okay, well, I li-, in Carrollton,

A.25:  Okay.

B.26:  and there's a new dollar theaters, it's really nice, and so, uh,

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  see, I took him and a friend t-, to see, uh, KINDERGARTEN COP a couple of
weeks ago.

A.29:  Was that a pretty good movie?

B.30:  You know, i-, it was so uninteresting that I don't even remember what it
was about [laughter].

A.31:  Oh re-, is that r-, [laughter].  #It was that bad, huh?#

B.32:  #The, the kids seemed to# enjoy it, and then, uh, let's see, uh, bef-, the
week before that, I took them to see LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO which was just
awful.

A.33:  Oh, was it?

B.34:  I mean, even the do-, it wasn't even worth a dollar [laughter].

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  Uh, the first one was much, much better.

A.37:  Oh Lord.

B.38:  I, in fact, I enjoy the, joy the first one, LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

A.39:  Right.  Yeah, I, I saw the first one and I, I thought that was, you know,
pretty humorous.

B.40:  But the second one's just, it's more, it really hardly has anything to do
with the kids, it's more about their relationship, and they're just always
fighting, and they break up, and they, you know, get back, typical, you know,

A.41:  I see, I see.

B.42:  typical plot [laughter].

A.43:  Right.  Huh.

B.44:  So, but I was real disappointed in that, and then KINDERGARTEN COP, like I
said, I, you know, I just, I don't even remember it.

A.45:  Don't even remember it [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter] My mind must have just been somewhere else.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  So,

A.49:  Another movie that I've seen that was pretty good was, uh, SLEEPING WITH
THE ENEMY.

B.50:  Oh, I'd like, yeah, I want to see that one, too.

A.51:  That was a good movie.  That, that was one movie, that, uh, I wasn't ready
for it to be over with.

B.52:  Really.

A.53:  It was pretty predictable towards the end, but, uh, I still thought it was
a good movie.

B.54:  Yeah, I definitely want to see that.  Have you seen, uh, THE DOORS?

A.55:  No, I haven't. #No, I haven't.#

B.56:  #I haven't seen that either.#  I, uh, when it first came out, it was like,
hey, you know, I've really got to go see this movie, and now that it's been
out awhile, it's kind of like, well, maybe I don't really have to go see it
[laughter].

A.57:  Right.  Right.  And I haven't, uh, talked to anybody that's seen that.  I
don't know, uh, #what anybody's views are on,#

B.58:  #I don't think I, I haven't either, and it's had# terrible reviews.

A.59:  Oh really?

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  I see.  Have you seen the movie FLATLINERS?

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  It's out on video now.

B.64:  Yeah, I rented the video. I thought that was pretty good.

A.65:  Yeah, that was, uh, pretty suspenseful.  

B.66:  So, my same friend that told me not to go see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also
told me not to see FLATLINERS so,

A.67:  Okay [laughter],

B.68:  I don't think I trust his judgment [laughter].

A.69:  so they've got a, they've got a weak stomach, then, huh?

B.70:  I don't thi-, I, uh, I think if, uh, I enjoyed FLATLINERS, I rented that
not t-, uh,

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  just about a week or so ago, and I, I like Julia Roberts.

A.73:  Right, she is a, a good actress.

B.74:  Seems like,

A.75:  Did you see, uh, oh, that movie with her and Dolly Parton and,

B.76:  Uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS?

A.77:  STEEL MAGNOLIAS.

B.78:  Yeah, I just watched that yesterda-, or Sunday.

A.79:  Really?

B.80:  I just watched that.

A.81:  I enjoyed that movie.  I thought that was a good movie.

B.82:  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  I heard it was a real tearjerker, so I was
pretty much prepared.

A.83:  Prepared [laughter]?

B.84:  [Laughter] And I knew that she, I knew that she died, so,

A.85:  I see.

B.86:  I was prepared for that j-, I still cried, 

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  but I was, I was prepared for it [laughter].

A.89:  Oh Lord.

B.90:  And, uh, it seemed like every time I turn on the movie channel, PRETTY
WOMAN is on.

A.91:  Right.

B.92:  Have you seen that?

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  That, that's a goo-, I think that's just a cu-, real cute movie.

A.95:  That really is, and I didn't think that I was going to enjoy that, uh, just
from what people had told me about it and,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  and I thought, well, it's not going to be that good, but I, I really did
enjoy that.

B.98:  Yeah, I did too.

A.99:  And ((anymore)), uh, my wife and I are getting bad.  We, we wait until
videos come out, instead of going to the movie theater.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  Uh, for the very reason, you know, it's just so expensive.

B.102:  Well, uh, yeah, with the dollar theater, though, I, it's, sometimes it's
cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to, you know, to pay,

A.103:  That's true, that's t-,

B.104:  it depends on where you rent your videos but, 

A.105:  Plus, a lot of movies, you need to, sort of see them in a theater, you
know?

B.106:  Yeah, I'm glad that,

A.107:  It just makes them that much better.

B.108:  I'm glad that I saw GHOSTS before it went.

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  Because it's out on video now, but it's still playing at the dollar
theater, I'm glad I got to see it there, rather, it's, T V just doesn't have
the same impact.

A.111:  Right, right, because you can alway-, you'll either get interrupted with a
telephone call, or want to get up and leave, and that just doesn't make the
movie,

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  you know, you need to just sit through it, and, and enjoy it.

B.114:  Uh, yeah, for ones that you want to see again,

A.115:  Right.

B.116:  or, you know, ones that you really weren't sure if you wanted to see or
not, you know,

A.117:  Right, that you didn't want to waste the time or the, 

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  the expensive movie ticket, then the videos are worth it.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  There's another one I want to see, is, uh, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES.

B.122:  I haven't seen that, and I, you know it, of course won a lot of Academy
Awards.

A.123:  Right.

B.124:  But I've heard that it's real, it's a long movie.

A.125:  That's what I've heard, that, uh,

B.126:  Like, three hours.

A.127:  Right.

B.128:  And, uh,

A.129:  But, uh, I've heard the scenery is real good in it.

B.130:  Really?

A.131:  Yeah.

B.132:  I've heard a lot of good things about it, but I've also heard that it can,
it becomes slow.

A.133:  Oh, there's parts in it that don't move?

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  Yeah. #I bet that's true.#

B.136:  #So, I don't kno-, you know,# ((speaking)) about making a three hour time
commitment.

A.137:  [Laughter].

B.138:  [Laughter] I don't know.

A.139:  That's right, that's all afternoon, I'll tell you what.

B.140:  So,

A.141:  But, uh, yeah, there are a ton of movies out.

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  Seems like a lot, just, uh, you know, the first three months of this
year. Seemed like there's been a lot of movies come out.

B.144:  ((I thought also)), I wanted to see the, THE MARRYING MAN, with, uh,

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.  We've only saw a, uh, like a preview of
it, and it looks pretty formula, you know,

A.147:  Oh, really?

B.148:  so, oh, I don't know now, if I want to see it.  Now, it's like, now I'll
probably wait until it's either at the dollar movie or #on video [laughter].#

A.149:  #Or on the video# [laughter].  That's right.  But,

B.150:  And, what else, what else is out right now that I want to see?

A.151:  Uh, let's see, there was another movie that I saw a preview to that I
wanted to see.  Uh, something about cowboys.  Uh, ALL MY HEROES ARE COWBOYS
or,

B.152:  Is that new?

A.153:  Yeah, it's, it's pretty new, uh, I'm trying to think who it's got in it.

B.154:  I guess, uh, uh, there's a song by that name, I guess, 

A.155:  Uh,

B.156:  but it's not new.

A.157:  Yeah, it's, uh, that song, that Willie Nelson song is in it.

B.158:  Yeah.

A.159:  Uh, but it's about this, this guy that's a rodeo, big rodeo guy, and he
comes home to his dad,

B.160:  Okay, yeah.

A.161:  and he's, I don't know, in a rest home or something.  And then they go
off and do s-, I don't really know what all it was,

B.162:  Yeah, I think I've seen, you know,

A.163:  But, uh,

B.164:  commercials, yeah.

A.165:  Yeah, yeah, they sound like that would be a pretty good Western movie.
But, uh, I don't know yet.  I'll just have to save my money, I guess
[laughter].

B.166:  [Laughter].

A.167:  And splurge a little bit,

B.168:  Yeah.

A.169:  but, well hey, I appreciate the conversation.

B.170:  Yeah, it was nice talking to you.  #You have a good day.#

A.171:  #Okay, you have a good day.#

B.172:  #Bye.#

A.173:  #Bye-bye.#
