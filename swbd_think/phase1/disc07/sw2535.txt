========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I don't know how you feel about this but, uh, it's really scary to
me [laughter].

B.2:  Oh, yeah, me too.

A.3:  There was a thing in there, our we, have a little Lewisville paper that
just comes out twice a week and there was a thing in there just this week
saying that in all of Denton County, Lewisville had the highest crime rate, of
all of Den-,

B.4:  Well it's not surprising, considering how close to Dallas it is.

A.5:  it, I guess that's true.  But, you know, you've got to figure, uh, you've
got to look at it like, Carrollton is in Denton County, you know.

B.6:  (( )) that's true.

A.7:  You know, you know, and it gets kind of scary, you know, when you're
looking at Lewisville, you're looking at Denton, you're looking at, you know,
some of the larger cities and, and Lewisville had more crime this last year
than any of them.  And, it's just getting,

B.8:  Yeah, uh.

A.9:   it's just getting really scary and almost, uh, out of hand, you know.
There's been, I don't know if you've heard any, bu-, any of it on the news
lately, or not, but there's been a couple of, uh, you know, a few months ago,
there was a deal in North Dallas where they had the man taking little girls
out of their bedrooms, breaking into their bedroom win-,

B.10:  Ye-, oh, yes, I was living up there when all that mess was happening.

A.11:  At that time.  There's been a couple of those here in Lewisville over the
last few weeks.  

B.12:  Is there?

A.13:  Yeah, and they're, you know, they're not sure if we're working with the
same guy or not, but, uh,

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  it's really scary, you know, it really is, so.

B.16:  Yeah, it is.

A.17:  What are things like, you said McKinney, do you live in McKinney, too?

B.18:  Yes, we, 

A.19:  Are things pretty calm up there, or?

B.20:  Uh, oh yeah, it's, it's deader than a doornail up here.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  We've only lived, uh, my husband was, uh, transferred up here from, uh, the
North Building, we-, 

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  to, um, so it's, we've been up here for about eight, six or eight months
an it's a lot different than Dallas [laughter]. 

A.25:  Oh yeah, yeah.

B.26:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.27:  I grew up in, I went to high school in Frisco and lived there several
years so I was up, you know, pretty close to where you guys are.  

B.28:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.29:  And, and it was always, I don't know, Frisco, there always seemed to be a
lot of drugs in Frisco.

B.30:  Really, oh, uh.

A.31:  For as small a town as it was, there were a lot of drugs.

B.32:  Um.

A.33:  But as far as major crime, there didn't seem to be, it was, you know, one
of those nice little small towns, and nothing ever happened, and it would be
nice to kind of get back into that, so, I don't know.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  I just don't know, as a matter of fact I had, uh, one of these
conversations the other day where our topic was, uh, capital punishment and,

B.36:  Oh, yeah.

A.37:  you know, the death penalty and you know what.  You know, we were talking
about that,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  and one of the things that we kind of got to talking about, is, you know,
what is it we can do.  You know, what can, what can be done to stop it.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  And I'm not sure that I know #the answer to that question.#

B.42:  #I don't know that one {spoken slowly}.#

A.43:  You know, I mean one of the things that we talked about that I truly
believe is, you know, you give somebody a, you know, a jury convicts somebody
and they give them a sixty year sentence and the guys going to be out in
twelve or thirteen years, you know.

B.44:  If that long.

A.45:  Yet, they, oh, it's very wrong, it's horrible, you know.  

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  I hav-, I take a business law class, um, on Tuesday nights and my
instructor is a practicing criminal attorney,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  and, you know, so he does this like everyday, you know, deals with this.

B.50:  Oh, yeah [breathing].

A.51:  And he said you know, you could pretty much, if you sit on a jury, now,
right now you could be sure that they will serve just about a quarter of
whatever you give them, you know.

B.52:  Why is that?  Why is that?

A.53:  Well, they, they say we don't have enough room in the prisons,

B.54:  I know.

A.55:  and we've got to get them out.  Well if that's the case, let's
come up with some money somewhere, to build some more,

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  and keep these people in.  I mean, there was a thing on TV the other
night where they were interviewing, it wa, it was a women's prison and they
were interviewing these women and these women are li-, they asked them, is
this a deterrent and they all said, no.

B.58:  Of course not.

A.59:  I mean, we're going to be out in a couple of years, this is no big deal,
I mean, this is like a little vacation.

B.60:  Yeah, yeah.

A.61:  We don't have to work, we don't have to, you know, we don't have to
worry about making a living.

B.62:  Don't have to do anything.

A.63:  You know, we're fed and we're clothed, and we're, you know, this is no
big deal and.  And, you know, they were asked, you know, well when you get out
will you commit that same crime again and they said probably.

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  You know, that's how we live, that's how we make our living.  

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  We live by selling drugs, we live by stealing, we live by this, you know.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  Obviously the system's not working.

B.70:  No, no it's not.

A.71:  You know, an, uh, and I don't know what to do to make it work.  It's real-,
you know.

B.72:  [Breathing] Oh, it, it's, it's too, it's too hard to enforce the capital
punishment.  It ta-, it, it's all, all this automatic appeal stuff, it just
drags it out for years and years, and years.

A.73:  Right, years and years, that's something we talked about too, you know,
if,

B.74:  And then people forget, you know, th-, you hear, oh this person's going to
be put to death.  But you don't, #they don't tell you what this person has
done.  Ye-, killed five children or something like this.#

A.75:  #What this person had done ten years ago.# The brutality of their crime.
Exactly.

B.76:  And, and you don't get to hear that part. 

A.77:  Oh, that kind of wears off with time, and people's outrage slowly goes
away and, you know.

B.78:  Mine doesn't [Laughter].

A.79:  No, mine doesn't either, but with specific,

B.80:  I know what you're saying.

A.81:  yeah, but with specific cases people, bu-, you know, the names aren't
familiar anymore, an.

B.82:  Oh that's true, that's very true.

A.83:  [Throat_clearing] You know, people don't remember the, what happened and
they don't remember the outrage they felt at the time.  You know, that, oh my
God, look what he did, you know, an.

B.84:  Yeah, yeah, they say, they'll ((just)) say oh, he killed a police officer,
you know,

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  who has a wife and three children.

A.87:  Yeah, they don't mention that part, yeah, that's exactly right.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  There was a thing on the other night about, they had this women, uh, her
husband was a police officer and was killed, 

B.90:  Oh.

A.91:  I think brutally, I mean this guy point blank just shot him in the head.
I mean, just, uh, for no reason, I mean he, the cop pulled him over for like a
mano-, minor traffic thing, you know.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  And, and, uh, you know, she was getting ready to go through the trial, you
know for this guy.

B.94:  Oh, God,

A.95:  And, you know, the-, they asked her,

B.96:  wouldn't that be horrible.

A.97:  uh, can you imagine.  They asked her if she wanted the death penalty and
she said yes.  

B.98:  Of course.

A.99:  I do.  

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  And I want to sit on the front row when it happens.  

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  I want to be there, I want to watch it, you know and you can't blame her
for feeling that vindictive, you know, I mean.

B.104:  No, you can not.

A.105:  And, you know, it showed her trying to explain to her children, where
daddy is, you know.

B.106:  Oh boy.

A.107:  And it was just, oh, it was just, it was just horrible, I mean this, her
little girl was like five and she was, you know all of a sudden she started
crying and said, mommy I want my daddy and, and, you know, her mommy said I
know, honey an.

B.108:  Yeah an they just can't grasp it.

A.109:  Oh, and this little girl said, uh, said something about that man shot my
daddy, didn't he.  

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  And the, her mother said, yeah honey, the man shot your daddy.

B.112:  Uh.

A.113:  And, uh, she said where did he shoot my daddy, and it was in the head, 

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  and the mother said, well, we won't worry about that right now.  

B.116:  Yeah, oh, (( )).

A.117:  And she said, I think he shot daddy in the face.  And mom said, well
you're right, you know, and she just started crying and it was just so sad,
you know.  I mean just, I want to,

B.118:  And how a five year old can grasp something like that is be-, is just, uh.

A.119:  No, you, an adult can't grasp something like that, 

B.120:  No [laughter].

A.121:  the enormity of it, you know, I mean, I don-, I don't know and these poor
children are going to be fatherless forever and this guy ought, chances are,
he,

B.122:  He'll be out.

A.123:  he'll be out, he'll be walking the streets and it's just doesn't,

B.124:  Or, or you and I are going to be supporting him for the rest of his life.

A.125:  One of the two, that's right, that's right.  I don't know, I just I know,
you kno-, I look at some of the millions of dollars that we, you know give to
other countries every year,

B.126:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.127:  and I know some of the, I know those people, I, I mean I know they're
people too, and I know they deserve to have food to eat and water to drink,

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  but I just want to say, hey, you know let's straighten out, yo-, use
that money and straighten ourselves out before we go trying to heal the world,
you know, I mean.

B.130:  Yeah, yes, too mu-, we give away way too much,

A.131:  Oh, we do,

B.132:  in my, in my opinion.  An, 

A.133:  we do, we dre-, we really do.  And I guess, if, if we would as a country
unite and sit down an, and if Congress received a millions of letters in one
week saying, 

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  we're not going to take this anymore, you're either, you know, do away
with some of these laws providing this or we're going to vote you out next
time, maybe something would happen, you know.  But people don't get involved
and don't sit down and do that, so, I don't know.

B.136:  No, people would rather hide their head and,

A.137:  Yeah, and just not pay any attention to it, yeah.

B.138:  and not ve-, venture out their own front door than,  

A.139:  Yeah, well, we're feeding starving kids overseas but we're not paying any
attention to the ones that are starving next door.

B.140:  #Yeah.#

A.141:  #You know,# it's really pa-, sad, it really is.  I heard something that
their supposed to be starting a huge campaign in New York about, um, child
abuse and stopping child abuse,

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  and it's supposed to be like, it's starting there, supposed to be like a
big nationwide campaign,

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  and, you know so hopefully, that will take off and really do something, I
don't know, there's just,

B.146:  That would be nice, but, you know, it's like the big drug campaigns that
you hear every once in a while,

A.147:  Yeah.

B.148:  They, the big hype is at first and then it just kind of #fizzles and dies.#

A.149:  #Kind of fizzles out.#   Yeah, that's true, that's true.

B.150:  And [sniffing], uh, it's just, it's got to start at home, is where it's got
to start.  And, uh, it's, but then there's so many peo-, you get so many
different opinions, like well you shouldn't have, w-, I shouldn't have to
have, to do this or I shouldn't have to do that and all this other stuff, I
don't want to get involved and, and it just,

A.151:  Uh-huh.  I chased a bunch of kids down on Easter Sunday.  We had put
Easter eggs out in the front yard for an Easter egg hunt for, you know, my son
and for his cousins and stuff and, and, uh, a bunch of kids came along and
just started grabbing them, stealing them.

B.152:  Uh!

A.153:  I went running after them screaming, hey you stop, you stop.  I called
the police, you know, I mean there was people that laughed at me, they were,
Easter eggs Dena.  I called the police because I figured if these kids were
stealing Easter eggs at ten,

B.154:  That's theft, that is theft, yes, uh-huh.

A.155:  they're going to be stealing cars at sixteen and robbing houses at
twenty-one, you know.

B.156:  Yes, well you've got to be held accountable for their actions, no matter
how old you are, or what it is.

A.157:  That's right, these boys knew that what they were doing was wrong. 

B.158:  Of course.

A.159:  And when I screamed at them to stop, they kept running, 

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  they knew what they were doing was wrong.  That's why I called the
police, to heck with them, you know.  The police asked me if I wanted to press
charges and I said no, I'm not going to press charges, I wanted the boys
parents to know what had happened,

B.162:  Yes, tha-, 

A.163:  and I want you to go to talk to their parents, and I want, you know,
the-, their parents to be aware.

B.164:  Now that's something that sure doesn't happen anymore, boy when I was a
kid if you did something to somebody else, you got trotted over to that
person's house and, and you had to apologize to their parents,

A.165:  Well.

B.166:  and all this other kind of stuff.

A.167:  This is exactly what I told my mom, you know, when it was all over, I said
if we had a decent set of parents here, those boys will be back here this
afternoon,

B.168:  Of course.

A.169:  with money to repay the eggs and with a big apology, and nothing.

B.170:  Nothing, of course.

A.171:  The one girl, the boys ran, I couldn't keep up with them.  But the one girl
was like carrying a two year old on her back, and I was able to keep up with
her and follow her until the police came, you know,

B.172:   Yeah.

A.173:  so we would know who they were, and her mother, the police called her
mother to come and pick them up and her mother had the same attitude as she,
as she did.  They were convinced that the absolute only reason I called the
police was because she was black.

B.174:  Oh Lord.

A.175:  It had nothing to do with the fact that she stole from me.  And the
little girl told me that, the only reason you called the police is because I'm
black.  And the little two year old sister she had with her, she patted her on
the leg and said see what happens when your black, honey, you'll live with
this your whole life.

B.176:  Ooh!

A.177:  And I told her, I said honey, this has nothing to do with you being black.
I'd follow white kids that stole from me, I mean stealing is stealing.  I
don't care what color you are.  You think just because you're black you can
steal and nobody's going to call the police.  That doesn't make any sense, you
know.  Oh it was just horrible.

B.178:  No, ugh!

A.179:  And then the mother's attitude, the mother looked at me and goes, well what
is it that you want.  Do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what.  You
know, it was that kind of attitude, 

B.180:  Oh!

A.181:  you know, I mean it was just bad, and I thought, you know the parents
went home, and you know the kids ...
