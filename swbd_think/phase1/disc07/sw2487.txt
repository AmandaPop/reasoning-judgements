==========================================================================

A.1:  Are you in the new car market right now?

B.2:  No, I'm not, uh, and I won't be for a while, it's kind of called not
having the money but [laughter],

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  I always like to look at what's out there.  Are you looking at cars right
now?

A.5:  I'm not looking right now but I have been considering what I would
purchase, uh, in the near future.

B.6:  Well what ha-, what are you thinking about?

A.7:  Um, well, I'm getting in th-, in my mid thirties now, I'm looking more
for a, uh, kind of a luxury sedan I guess.  I'm driving a two door coupe,
sport coupe right now,

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  and I'm getting a little tired of it. 

B.10:  So you're looking at, uh, lux-, luxury cars a little bit bigger.

A.11:  Yeah, a little bigger and,

B.12:  Have you looked at, uh, the Buick Riviera?

A.13:  I haven't, uh, really been out looking at cars, uh, it's something I would
possibly consider.

B.14:  It is.   Well I happen to drive that one just because I think it looks nice
and, um, I owned a Buick for a while and it, it performed real well.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Um, I, do-, I have a lot of friends that have bought cars recently and it
just seems like there's and epi-, um, a million people wh-, that buy Honda
Civi-, uh, Honda Accords.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  Its like everybody buys a Honda Accord and I really don't know what makes
them select that over any other car.

A.19:  I don't know, I've been told to check out the, uh, Acura Legend first
though, and I guess they're made by Honda as well.

B.20:  Oh, are they, I didn't know that, I didn't know that, uh.

A.21:  It's the, uh, luxury line of, uh, Hondas, I think.

B.22:  And I, uh, I've read some articles too, about, oh, I think the last one
that got me going, I don't know much about it at all, but those little Geos.

A.23:  Uh-huh [barking].

B.24:  They're kind of cute and they get excellent gas mileage, I mean, they're
like the top rated gas mileage car out there.

A.25:  Yeah, I do need something that gets a little better mileage than what I'm
ge-, getting right now.  

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  I get about thirteen miles per gallon.

B.28:  Whoa [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter] No, I've been, uh, leaning more towards looking at, uh, Mercedes
Benzes, say four or five years old.

B.30:  Ugh, that sounds nice.

A.31:  Not the new cars, but, uh, ones that are more affordable.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  They tend to be very reliable and, uh, people that, uh, own them, uh,
typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule.  I think
they're kept in, uh, better condition than, uh, most other cars.

B.34:  I agree with you there.  I have, uh, uh, a friend who has one and, you
know, another thing is, is they don't age, they always look the same, so you
really don't know what, what year it is.

A.35:  Uh-huh, yeah, they don't change style very often.  I like that.

B.36:  They don't.   And, uh, th-, you know they're a quality car, they,

A.37:  Uh-huh, if you were to buy, uh, a new car right now what factors would you
consider, uh, looking at to make you decision?

B.38:  [Sigh] Well, I would definitely have to look at price.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:   Uh, and, I would look at what I could afford, uh, I definitely
would chose a car on, on what appeals to me as far as looks, but, it would
have to be dependable, uh,

A.41:  I find that price is always the governing, govern-, governing factor,
uh, regardless of what else you're looking at so,  

B.42:  It, it'd have to be.

A.43:  It's difficult to buy something that's out of your price range,
something that you can't afford.

B.44:  Exactly and there, there's such a range of prices, prices in the car market
that if you don't start by narrowing it down by that factor, I mean that
really gets you into just one little slot  and then there are many,
many options to go to, go to from there.  Uh, I'd, one thing that always
interests me is whether or not to buy an American car, or a foreign car.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, y-, I drive a Pontiac right now and I've had very good
luck with it, uh, no problems.  I'm just changing my preference, for what type
of car I'd like to drive in the future.

B.46:  Uh-huh, so you're going to, uh, something a little bit bigger and, and
having better gas mileage too.

A.47:  Yeah, eventually, I'd like to do something like that.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Get out out of, uh, uh, driving this, uh, teenage, teenage automobile
[laughter].

B.50:  [Laughter]  Well you make me laugh because right now, I, what I did is I, I
acquired a car through my folks which is a nineteen eighty-four L T D and my
teenage daughter hates it,

A.51:  Sure.

B.52:  because it's an old persons car.  

A.53:  Well there are cars that teens absolutely refuse to drive. 

B.54:  Oh, well, absolutely and, uh, it's, it's a nineteen eighty-four car and it
has eighteen thousand miles on it, actual miles.  So it's kind of thing like,
I'm going to drive this car until it dies.

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter] You know, I mean, it's just too good to, and then maybe when I
go out and look in, in the car market I'll be able to get what I really want
and,

A.57:  Uh-huh, do you prefer buying, uh, cars new from, uh, dealerships or, uh,
buying used cars from individuals.

B.58:  Oh, I think I'm going to fall in to the category of most women, uh, in
saying that I feel better going to a dealership because, I don't know anything
about a car mechanically. 

A.59:  Right, but don't you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman.

B.60:  O-, that was an experiment I did last year was I went and, and talk, and
drove a few cars and talked with the, the salesman and I found that, uh, I had
matured a little bit in that they don't intimidate me at all.

A.61:  Okay, well that's great if they can make you feel at ease, that's pretty
good [barking].

B.62:  Uh, oh, they, well they, they make you, they don't make you feel at ease,
but I've come to the point where I know that I'm the one they charge and that
they can't, you know, talk me into some-,

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  Um, I think they're intimidating to both men and women and,

A.65:  They certainly are and they try to take advantage of, uh, the consumer's
ignorance towards automobiles.

B.66:  Exactly, and once you, once they sense that you really like something,
then you're really in trouble.

A.67:  Yeah, if they sense that you're really interested and that's the car for
you, they're, whe-, they're negotiating position is that they're going to get
as much money out of you as they can,

B.68:  Exactly.

A.69:  with as many options piled on.

B.70:  Yeah, the, uh, I ha-, also had a ne-, had a nineteen eighty-four, uh,
Bronco two which, uh, my ex-husband had purchased, I paid it off and, and when
I acquired this L T D I thought well, I'm going to sell this car while I can
get some money out of it yet.  So, I was th-, selling a car and that was
interesting because I had to kind of research, well what is it worth, um, and
kind of understand what someone would ask me about it.

A.71:  Sure, well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an
individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a
dealership.  

B.72:  Oh yes, absolutely and yet at the same time, it's, it's a matter of like
selling anything else you have to find someone who wants that particular item.

A.73:  Sure, well I've found that any car that runs is basically in demand.

B.74:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.75:  And uh, you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by, uh,
comparison, uh, listings.

B.76:  That's what I did, is I kind of did a little bit of both.  Blue book is
kind of a dream.  It's kind of like if you can attain it you're doing well,

A.77:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.78:  but if you go by what the other cars are listing for then you can rest
assured that you're going to get right in that ball park. Ho-, so,

A.79:  Yeah, uh, yeah, I agree with you on that.

B.80:  How soon do you think you'll be purchasing a car.

A.81:  Well, I'm not sure, I'm, I'm  just, uh, kind of thinking about it and
haven't really made any, uh, decisions or commitments on it [barking].

B.82:  Do you think of colors at all when you, 

A.83:  Well, I drive a black car right now and I've always liked black,

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  but, uh, I maybe, uh, interested in other colors, uh, I'm not really
interested in yellow, or white, but I've always had a preference for red,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  and black and, uh, well, it's just something I'd have to think about,
depended on, it depends on which, uh, what cars are available.

B.88:  That's right, would you order it or would you, uh,

A.89:  Oh, no, I would, uh, go to the want ads in the paper and, 

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  uh, find one that would, meet my, uh, needs.

B.92:  Well that sounds exciting, it really does, so.

A.93:  [Laughter] {pause} Well, may, maybe sometime soon, I don't know.  Probably
not this year.  I think I need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for
the car that I have right now, and just keeping it in, uh, good operating
condition.

B.94:  Well that sounds like a good plan, you might as well just, you know, get
it, enjoy it for one more year and get it in good sha-, shape for selling it
or trading it in.

A.95:  Yeah, well that's the point, it isn't costing me any money right now, it's
running, uh, very well,

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  and I haven't had car payments for seven years.  

B.98:  Mu goodness.

A.99:  I enjoy that immensely.

B.100:  What type of car do you, are you driving?

A.101:  I'm driving a nineteen eighty Trans Am.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  The only trouble I have with it is with insurance companies.

B.104:  Oh, I'm sure.

A.105:  They don't want to insure it.

B.106:  Uh-huh, because it has such, uh,

A.107:  Just because it's a sporting model.

B.108:  powerful en-, right, right.

A.109:  Has nothing to do with driving record, 

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  I have no accidents or tickets, and, uh, [laughter], they're very
reluctant, uh, yet even to insure that car.

B.112:  I can understand that they're, I mean they're just very difficult to work
with and they can, they can see a potential for a problem even if your record
is good.

A.113:  Yeah, well my insurance agent told me that, uh, when, when I, uh bought a
new car, or whe-, more specifically when I bought my Honda, [laughter] to give
him a call because then he wou-, he would make me a good deal on an insurance
policy.

B.114:  [Laughter] Caus-, well that's good.

A.115:  But I haven't really no intention of buying a Honda.

B.116:  They don't really appeal to me that much, I,

A.117:  It, uh, well it's, it's more like an economy car and, uh,

B.118:  Right, right.

A.119:  I'd be looking more of, uh, more for a luxury sedan, something with a
little more status.

B.120:  You seem to put a lot of, um, image into your selection of a car, which
lots of people do [music].

A.121:  I really don't consider it to be a status symbol, uh, it's just I'm
interested, I know people who have cars of that nature and, uh, they tend to
hold their quality and hold their value.

B.122:  That's true, uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.123:  Uh, and they're just very attractive automobiles as far as I'm concerned.

B.124:  And I liked what you said also about when people have cars that are, uh,
that are quality cars ...
