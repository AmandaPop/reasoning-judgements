on Speaker A's side during monologue.

========================================================================

A.1:  We built our home in what was a brand new subdivision in nineteen
sixty-five and we were the fourth lot in this subdivision to be built on.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Uh, finally just last year the last home [Noise] {sounds like water
running} of the last lot was sold and, uh, a home was built on it.  So, the
subdivision is now full, but we're in a [/Noise] community of five thousand
people.

B.4:  Oh, that's pretty nice.  I did mine.  I built my own home in nineteen 
sixty-one.

A.5:  Oh!

B.6:  That's pretty much about the same time and I,

A.7:  Yes.

B.8:  I built on two acres of land in a town called Cumberland, Rhode Island.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, it was, it's, uh, it's just a private, uh, piece of property.  I
mean, there's no, you know, there's no other, well there's other houses in the
area but at that time there were just individual homes scattered throughout,

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  the town.  And, I guess the town of Cumberland's probably got
thirty-five thousand people in it or so.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Which is right on, on the Massachusetts, Rhode Island state line.
That's, that's why I work in Massachusetts.  It's only, it's only a twenty
minute ride.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And, uh, I did the whole house myself as a matter of fact.  I had the
foundation poured, the concrete poured and the rest of all the building I did
entirely on my own, which was quite a project.  Uh,

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Would you do it again? [Laughter].

B.18:  No [Throat_clearing] [Laughter].

A.19:  Oh, I see.

B.20:  No.  I w-, I, I don't think so.

A.21:  Well, we wouldn't have done it the first time.  So [laughter],

B.22:  Uh, I, I would, I would probably, I would act as a contractor and
subcontract everything out, I think.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I, but I would not physically do the work because I worked every night
after, after working all day in the, in the plant.  And then, weekends, all
your weekends were tied up and it took me about, oh, a little over seven
months to finish it, which I thought was pretty good.

A.25:  Did you finish it?

B.26:  Yes.  I, I completely finished the house.

A.27:  So you do not have any place that has a mopboard off or a,

B.28:  No.

A.29:  a piece, uh, we have a friend who, uh, rents homes, redoes homes and
rents them,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  and he never quite has finished any one of the houses that he's done.
I mean #there's,#

B.32:  #Well, I,#

A.33:  always just one little detail that,

B.34:  I had, uh, when,

A.35:  [Throat_clearing].

B.36:  I moved in, I did not have my garage built and my breezeway and the
concrete, s-, upstairs the stairs, the stairs were, were made out of wood and
the reason I did that it was getting late in November and the winter was
coming,

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  and I just, I ran out of time #really.#

A.39:  #Uh-huh.#

B.40:  And, I, I waited until the house was completely finished in the interior
and the e-, exterior of the house short of the breezeway, and the, and the
attached garage.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, I did that and the driveway the following spring.  Which, uh, I needed
a break from the work,

A.43:  Sure.

B.44:  and I needed a break to get a little more money ahead.  Stuff like that.
So I waited, oh, probably November, December, until March or April, I guess
around April and then I went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage.
Because I thought it was too cold to be pouring,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh {very faintly}.

B.46:  concrete outside in the winter time.

A.47:  Did, do you find that, uh, the area has changed since you built your
home,

B.48:  #Uh,#

A.49:  #or has,# or has the area, main-, [sigh] it, are the rest of the homes in
keeping with the decor and the style of yours?

B.50:  Sure. Yeah, they, they, that area has managed to maintain itself very well.
The people are [sigh] real,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  proud of their homes and they've managed to take care of them.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  But, I noticed now that several of the homes where the elderly folks that
live there have either gone on or, or moved or whatever,

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  and, their children are now living there. Okay?

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And they ston-, teem-, seem to tend as much to them as their parents
did.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  Does that make sense?

A.61:  Well, it's a little bit surprising because, uh, the older we get, my
husband retired a little over a year ago and,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  [Lipsmack] we still, of course, are maintaining our home and he keeps up
the painting and, and all of this, and we did remodel, we have a large, uh,
den I suppose it is, kitchen den combination, and we did remodel that after,

B.64:  Oh, I, y-, yeah, I've done the s-, I, 

A.65:  after, uh, he retired but as far as doing anything, uh, major to it we at
this point would rather travel and I, uh,

B.66:  I've done the s-, I did the same thing, 

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  but what I'm saying is that some of the people that I know, they have
moved on to Florida or retired, you know, similar to your op-, you know your
situation,

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  and, but their homes have passed on to their (( )) children or, or,

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  to younger, younger families and they don't seem to maintain,

A.73:  #Oh.#

B.74:  #it# as well as the original people did.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  I, (( )) or like you would or I would,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  and perhaps its just it's, you know, because some of their homes were
given to them,

A.79:  Yes.

B.80:  and some of them the young people had to buy and perhaps they don't have
the money to spend on them.

A.81:  Somehow we don't think of a gift as being quite as dear to us as something
that we've had to work for.  I mean,

B.82:  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're right.

A.83:  Uh,

B.84:  I think you're right.

A.85:  we, I, I look at our home though and I think well gosh, you know, if we
don't do this then the next person who owns this home for instance is going to 
probably remodel the kitchen.  Put in new cabinets, that kind of,

B.86:  Sure.

A.87:  thing, you know.

B.88:  Sure. 

A.89:  After, oh, twenty six years, uh, things get a little scuffed up and it's
not something that I'm not interested in the mess anymore.  #Uh,#

B.90:  #Yeah.#

A.91:  the style of our neighborhood, uh, we're certainly not the smallest home
and we're not the largest home, but it has maintained itself in that the homes
that were built afterwards, uh, have come up, some of them are a little
smaller because at one point they wanted to put some two thirty-five housing
in.

B.92:  What is, what is two thirty-five housing?

A.93:  Well [sigh],

B.94:  I'm not familiar with that term here in Rhode Island.

A.95:  It, it's a law, it was quite some time ago when the neighborhood was very
new and we had some very restrictive covenants, uh, in the subdivision and
they were attempting to put seven houses in an area that was originally set
aside for five.

B.96:  Oh. Ok-,

A.97:  And I think the two thirty-five came because they could, people could get
into them for a down payment of something like two hundred and thirty five
dollars.

B.98:  I #see.#

A.99:  #And,# of course, we were involved with an attorney and were able to stop
that before it got off the ground and so the, some of the homes on that side
of the street are a little bit smaller but they were,

B.100:  Uh-huh.  I built a, I built a three bedroom Colonial home with one and a
half baths, up and down,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  and a, and an attached two car garage,

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  and a breezeway.  And, it was a, it's a pretty substantial home.  I, I,
I, I like,

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  the roominess of it, uh,

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  and, and I, actually the only thing I've done, other than you know,
wallpaper, pain-, paint over the years in the, in the interior is I did
refinish all the kitchen cabinets.

A.109:  Um.

B.110:  And I put a kitchen in the basement,

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  which was probably the best move I ever did.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  Okay?  And, uh,

A.115:  We have a rock base here and it's very #difficult,#

B.116:  #Excuse# me Verna for just a second.  Can you hang on just a second?

A.117:  Sure.

B.118:  Okay.  {Speaker B begins to speak to someone in background} Yeah, there's
your report.  Okay?  And that's everything, w-, would you give this to Barbara
Rashad for me please?  [Talking] Would you carry that over?  (( )) If you want
to hang on a minute.  You got a minute?  Okay, hang on a minute and I'll,
I'll, uh, finish up with this lady. {Resumes speaking to Speaker A.} Yes
ma'am.

A.119:  We have a rock base here and it's very difficult to put in a basement.
Our home is all brick and #with the two,# 

B.120:  #Yeah.  Are you, are you# on a flat, on a slab?  Like,

A.121:  No, no.  We're build,

B.122:  Do, do you have a basement?

A.123:  No we do not have a basement because we would had to have built up instead
of down because, 

B.124:  I see.

A.125:  uh, there's, the rock is so close to the surface here that it's difficult
to, to do basements.

B.126:  Okay.

A.127:  So we didn't do that but, uh, we have an attached two car garage and
#etcetera.#

B.128:  #Well,# it sounds, 

A.129:  Typical family there,

B.130:  It sounds.  It sounds like you have [Laughter],

A.131:  family home [Laughter].

B.132:  It sounds like, yeah, sounds like you have a real nice home and it's, uh,
it sounds like, what part of Indiana or is, is,

A.133:  We're, uh, two miles, we're between Indianapolis and Chicago on Interstate
I sixty-five and we're just now being found by the north end of the state,

B.134:  #Okay.#

A.135:  #and# getting a lot of, you know, there were homes on the market for ten
years that sold in the last year because there's a lot of people coming down
from,

B.136:  Is your real estate market, uh, slowed down there like it #is here in the
northeast?#

A.137:  #It just, it just# went crazy this last year.

B.138:  #It did?#

A.139:  #Everything# sold.  #Absolutely everything.#   

B.140:  #(( )).#  #Is that right?#

A.141:  #I mean we had# someone come knock on our door the other day and offer us a
price which I thought was absolutely ridiculous for our home.

B.142:  #You know well if you sell it for that,#

A.143:  #The problem is there's nothing# else to buy.

B.144:  Sure, if you sell it for that price.  Whatever you have to buy is going
to be #inflated# --

A.145:  #That's,# yes,

B.146:  -- by that same amount.  

A.147:   Well, and -- 

B.148:  So there's really #not an advantage to it.#

A.149:  -- #our children are all here# and we want to stay here.  So, 

B.150:  Sure.

A.151:  We have no reason to,

B.152:  [Noise].

A.153:  sell.  Nice talking with you.  Sounds like you're busy.

B.154:  Okay, Verna.  Yeah, well I'm in my office and I have someone here with me
and, uh, it's really been a pleasure.  I enjoyed it and, uh, if you ever get
to New England #look me up.#

A.155:  #Thank you# [Laughter].

B.156:  Thank you ma'am.

A.157:  Bye-bye [Beep] {telephone tone}.
