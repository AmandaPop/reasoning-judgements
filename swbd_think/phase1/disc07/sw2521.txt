REMARKS:        With the combination of the speakers speaking over each other,
the tape fluttering, and the background telephone noise, it was harder 
than usual to transcribe.  The phone noise indicated in brackets sounds like 
the transmission of a phone number called from a touch tone phone.  The other 
noises in brackets are varied and usually very faint.  All throughout the 
tape, on the first section and on the second section (Speaker A), some sort 
of a faint background noise was there.  Sometimes it sounded like another
faint conversation from the telephone line, or it could have been the other 
side of the tape bleeding through.  All of the noises and tape abnormalities 
were on the first section and Speaker A's section.  Speaker B's section was 
very good.       

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

@B.2:  So, who is your favorite football team?

A.3:  Guess.  I bet you can't guess [laughter].

B.4:  Well, I would say the Saints ((after)),

A.5:  You got it.  

B.6:  ((since)), 

A.7:  And I want to tell you something.

B.8:  {Pause} What's that?

A.9:  They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly.

B.10:  Yeah?

A.11:  Yeah.  I think they are because they're getting better every year.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  And, uh, they,

B.14:  Can't, 

A.15:  got a lot, 

B.16:  call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more.

A.17:  I don't think so.

B.18:  No.

A.19:  We went to the playoffs.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Yeah [laughter].

B.22:  Well, I'm a, I'm a Buffalo Bills fan.

A.23:  Yeah, 

B.24:  from a, 

A.25:  now I like them, too.  

B.26:  from a long time ago.  So, it's good to, it's good to see the Bills doing
so well now and, 

A.27:  They are.  They are doing a whole bunch better.  Who's, 

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  their quarterback?

B.30:  What's that?

A.31:  Who's their quarterback?

B.32:  [Lipsmack] Uh, Jim Kelly.

A.33:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like to watch them, too.  They're the, I like to watch
almost all the football but, um, of course, I watch every Saints game that I
can watch.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  But I think they're going to, I think they're really going to do good
because it seems like they're finally all [noise] coming together.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  If they would just quit blowing it.

B.38:  Well, [/noise] the, it, the, the N F L draft really seems to be doing its
job because, got teams like, like Buffalo who weren't, certainly weren't a
powerhouse, uh, ten years ago.  Now, they've been able to get some good
players and come around and th-, New Orleans [noise] {faint} the same story
and, uh, a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they, uh, [/noise]
they weren't getting the draft picks and now the, uh, other team, so it
[noise] seems to be, uh, moving around and, uh, to, to New Orleans benefit,

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  and, uh, you see how, look at the Cowboys now [/noise].  They're, uh,
they're hurting.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, uh,

A.43:  Really bad.  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  But they got so much bad publicity, too.  And I think that hurt a lot of,
you know,

B.46:  W-,

A.47:  people even wanting to play on their team.

B.48:  Yeah.  W-, w-, well, yeah.  Uh, firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson
what, what kind of, uh, uh, doesn't give you much respect for their team at
all.  Any t-, any team that, tha-, where the owner would fire Tom Landry, you
know, is like one of the greatest coaches of all time.

A.49:  Right.  Right.

B.50:  And just because they had, had a couple of bad seasons.  And you can't
even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching.

A.51:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because all the problems, I mean, if you think about those
years that we had the losing season, of how bad, I mean his players were
constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs, because of,

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  uh, you know, messing with young children and, I mean, it was just one
thing it seemed like right after the other,

B.54:  Right.  And he alway-, 

A.55:  with them.  

B.56:  and, uh, had a lot of trouble with injuries, too.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  You know, he'd, uh, never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy.  And
then even like, uh, what is it, Eric Dickerson left,

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  the team, you know, tha-, you're right.  You know, like people were jumping
ship right and left.

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  And, I don't know, that sounds to me more like the front office problem
than coaching problem, but then the team was sold.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  So,

A.65:  But, uh, that Jimmy Johnson came in, too, though, and he just, you know,
when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided, you
know, this is the way it's going to be and it was bad.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  I mean, it really was.  To me it was like it's going to take them quite a
while to rebuild because e-, everything, I mean anything that Tom Landry
wanted or had, he was going to change it.

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  I mean it's, tha-, I mean, you know, that's the way I felt about it.  But,

B.70:  Well, 

A.71:  I tell you what, if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- isn't nobody going to beat us [laughter].

B.74:  [Laughter].

A.75:  There ain't nobody going to beat us then.  Because look how good we did
without a quarterback this year [laughter].

B.76:  I know.  Who was the quarterback?

A.77:  Well,

B.78:  See, I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback,

A.79:  #They,# 

B.80:  #is.#  

A.81:  had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it.  Uh, Fourcade was for
a while.  And then, um, I can't remember that guy's name, the one that held
out for the money and he was across the river [lipsmack].  Uh, I can't think of
the, I can't think of his name now, but really we didn't have a quarterback.
#That,#

B.82:  #Yeah.#  

A.83:  was the whole problem.  We had one guy that couldn't throw and we had one
guy that couldn't run.

B.84:  Huh.

A.85:  And, it was, it was just bedlam.  We really didn't have a quarterback.  It
was, uh, defense w-, w-, won all the games.

B.86:  Did they, were they able to draft anybody this year?

A.87:  I don't know because, you know, they gave away a lot of their drafts.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  For different people for,

B.90:  Right.  

A.91:  you know, other places.  So, I don't know.  I hadn't heard, you know,
whether they have a new one or not.

B.92:  Well, when is the,

A.93:  But, uh,  

B.94:  N F L draft hasn't, has the N F L draft even gone yet?

A.95:  Uh-huh.  Not yet.  But, I mean, I don't know whether they have one of the
first, you know,

B.96:  Right.  

A.97:  choices of somebody, 

B.98:  Right.  

A.99:  that would be real good.

B.100:  Well, they've, yeah, they've, 

A.101:  I mean, ye-, everybody gets in draft.

B.102:  Sure.

A.103:  But, I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any
good.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  But, uh,

B.106:  Or even making the playoffs so that doesn't, doesn't help you in the draft.

A.107:  Right.  But we,

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  really, I mean, really and truly we just don't have a quarterback,

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  that's all there is to it.  But, the players and stuff, they finally quit
giving away the really good players and started keeping them too.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  Because we had some, you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback?

B.114:  That was a few years ago.

A.115:  Yeah.  Well, he was good.  But we, every time we'd get a real good player
they'd treat him bad.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  And, of course, we had a different coach then, too.  But they'd treat him
bad and then he'd leave.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  Or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies.

B.120:  Right.

A.121:  And it was weird.  It was like they were trying, if you were good, ((boy)),
let's don't have you on our team, you know.

B.122:  [Laughter].

A.123:  But, um, this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  The quarterback, all of them, every one that they played, I think they
played, uh, I can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks, but
all of them were bad.

B.126:  Huh.

A.127:  I mean, they were terrible.  They could not pitch.  You know, they couldn't
even take handoffs.  It was,

B.128:  Right.  

A.129:  terrible [laughter].  But, uh, 

B.130:  Oh, that's one,

A.131:  all the other places, 

B.132:  it's one thing, 

A.133:  I mean, our defense was unbelievable.

B.134:  Yeah.  Buffalo's,

A.135:  #Did you get to watch any of their games?#

B.136:  #lucky though to have,# uh, Jim Kelly than, now he's the number one rated
quarterback in the N F L.  I think,

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  I'm pretty sure he was this past season.  And, uh, then with, uh, uh, the
defense, with Bruce Smi-, Bruce Smith there at linebacker there, they've got a
very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering
and their fighting as they, problems they had in the past and now they're, uh,
really playing as a, good together as a team.

A.139:  Yeah. 

B.140:  So,

A.141:  Um.  Do you watch it every Sunday?

B.142:  [Breathing] Uh, when I can.  I'm a, I'm a musician and, uh, the band I play
in, uh, I, this is just something on the side and, uh, the band I play in, we
tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays.  So I missed a lot of Sundays during
--

A.143:  Um.

B.144:  -- this, 

A.145:  Did you ever get to watch any of the, uh, New Orleans games?

B.146:  ((Ac-,)) I, I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans
games, per se.

A.147:  I'm a,  

B.148:  New Orleans [noise] just isn't, isn't one of the areas, I've lived in so
many places.  I've lived in, [/noise] uh, Denver but I don't like the Broncos.
There's,

A.149:  Um. 

B.150:  no love for the Broncos.  But, 

A.151:  No.

B.152:  I've lived in, [noise] uh, uh, I was born in Buffalo and I lived in, uh,
outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now
and, uh, so I tend to look for, uh, uh,

A.153:  Teams in your area.

B.154:  and I lived in Detroit, too.  So I like, uh, first of all, first and
foremost the Bills games I want to see.  And then I'll, uh, normally check out
the Eagles or the Patriots and, Patriots were so depressing this last year
that --

A.155:  I know it [laughter].  

B.156:  -- yeah, that, uh, 

A.157:  Yeah. 

B.158:  I kind of gave up on them.

A.159:  Yeah.

B.160:  But, uh, first and foremost the Bills.  I even wen-, I went to, got to go
to a Bills game this year, which was fun.  It was the, the Bills, Eagles game,
which appropriately enough --

A.161:  Oh, 

B.162:  -- fortunately,

A.163:  that's neat.  

B.164:  the Bills won.

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  And it was good weather.

A.167:  Yes.

B.168:  ((We beat)) Buffalo in, in, uh, was it third of December?  And,

A.169:  Oh, my goodness. 

B.170:  it was sunny and forty-five degrees.  So, we couldn't a done much better
than that in Buffalo [laughter].

A.171:  No.  Because usually it's snowing [laughter].

B.172:  Yeah.

A.173:  Ice and rain and everything.

B.174:  Sure.

A.175:  But, I tell you what, if you get to watch some of these, [noise] now I
don't know how it will be this year, you know, but, I mean, these games
[/noise] go right down to the wire.

B.176:  Uh-huh.

A.177:  It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair, you know, going oh, no,
no.  And one, uh, [lipsmack] I can't remember.  It was about, uh, it was right
close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the
playoffs,

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  or not [noise].  So, we're watching the game.  All right.  The other team
got the ball and we had like, no, we got the ball back.  That's the way it
was.  And they had to kick.  And, uh, to know whether we were going to win the
game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us.

B.180:  Uh-huh.

A.181:  So we had to sit there, you know, and they cut the show off and shorin-,
started showing us another football game.  We did not get to see the end of
the game.  You talk about people calling in.

B.182:  Oh, my gosh.

A.183:  It was wild.  I mean, here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair,

B.184:  Sure, 

A.185:  you know,  

B.186:  and then they changed the game.  

A.187:  and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another, you
know, one that was going on.

B.188:  Right.

A.189:  Cut us off right there the last few seconds.  The station finally, you know
how they'll put the little message down at the bottom.

B.190:  Right.

A.191:  Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that [laughter] had
cut that off, that it was the national,

B.192:  Right.    

A.193:  you know,

B.194:  It was the network.

A.195:  Uh-huh.  An-, because it was funny.  I mean everybody was furious.  I was
so mad I got up and went and called, [noise] [laughter] you know, I couldn't
believe that.  But, almost [/noise] every game that I watched it would come
right [noise] down to the end, we would be ahead, you know, but then [/noise]
at the ver-, in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with
them or, you know, right ahead of them.

B.196:  Right.

A.197:  And it'd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didn't.
Oh, and it was, it was something else.  I said this is the most, if we had a
quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl.

B.198:  Yeah.

A.199:  There's no question about it, because everybody was playing good together
except the quarterbacks.  And the quarterbacks just didn't do anything.

B.200:  Yeah.  Well, (( )) that's the, that's the guy that counts [laughter].

A.201:  [Laughter] Yes.  But, maybe we, maybe we'll get your guy.

B.202:  Oh, I, 

A.203:  [Laughter].  

B.204:  I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any
time.
