A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Hi, I, uh, I like, I love to do, uh, all kinds of crafts and sewing, I, I
find that's my one release [laughter], so.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  What do you do?

A.5:  Um, I like to do like physical things like sports.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Um, I really enjoy softball and my favorite is volleyball,

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  and, but, I'm at school, I'm in, you know, I li-, I live up at the college,

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  So sometimes it's hard for me to do that, so I just, like sometimes,
I like, just to get away, I go to my room and I like walk in, turn the radio
on, or, you know, just kind of like veg out or something.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  Well I have two small kids and so, I, I don't have, you know,
much time to, to go places and play sports, you know, 

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  I have to do something where I can do it at home.  So, I'm, uh, I just
love to sew and, uh, you know, I ma-, I make a lot of my Christmas presents,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  and I love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that.

A.17:  I like to do that stuff, but when I'm in, like when I'm at school, I don't
have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it.

B.18:  [Child_talking] No, I remember when I was in college, I didn't have time to
do that stuff either.  It was really,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  But now, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time now but I have more
time than I did, so.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  And a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity, you know, for, you
know, I've got two kids to put clothes on, so.

A.23:  Yeah, exactly,  uh-huh.  Like, um, we-, I have, I come from a family of
twelve children,

B.24:  Oh.

A.25:  and when I'm up here, I really miss my younger brothers and sisters, so
you know, that's, that's a change, because there's nine of them that are
younger than me.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  (( )) I'll call ho-, like when I know my mom and dad aren't home, I'll
call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters.  I, I really miss
them a lot so I don't, I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies
too.

B.28:  Yeah, I, yeah, I just, uh, have, you know, one brother and he's married,
and, you know, they have a couple kids, so I, you know, I don't have, uh, you
know, I don't get on the phone too much.  But, yeah most of my stuff is just
going pla-, you know I enjoy going places with my kids and I do like sports,
but I'm, you know, I don't have a lot of time for them.  My, I like
volleyball.  Of all sports, I think that would be my favorite, because I hate
basketball an, an,

A.29:  Yeah, well, I'm not much of a basketball fan either.

B.30:  Yeah, I enjoy playing volleyball but I, you know, I, I don't have a lot
of time to do it, so.

A.31:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.32:  It's maybe once a year or something an, and then I, you know, used to
play it a lot when I was in school, but now that I'm married and stuff I, you
know I've like, I'm really bad.

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  Nobody would want me on their team.  I'm the, you know, I'm the opposing
teams best player, so, so to speak, so.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  But, yeah, I enjoy, um, you know, just, I, you know, I have varied
interests and stuff and yeah, so.

A.37:  Yeah, um, not that I like reading, but I do do a lot of reading while I'm
here at school.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Do you like reading as a hobby?

B.40:  Uh, I love to read, but I, you know, I don't have a lot of time to read
an,

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  You know, what reading I do, I kind of do because it's, you know, it's
the necessary stuff as far as fun reading, you know, I maybe get to read the
Sunday paper, but, that's about it, you know, so.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Yeah, I don't have a lot of time to read.  I, yeah, I remember in college,
I did a lot of reading, most of it text books, [laughter] so.

A.45:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And, just, you know keeping busy with everything else going on, so.  But
yeah, I, I like to do, uh, I've made stuffed cows, you know, dress, you know,
dolls, they're like dolls, the-,

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  you know, you make clothes for them and everything like that.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  They, those have been real popular with my family.  I've had them calling
up and saying, will you make me another one and,

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  so, I do things like that, you know, if I had more time, I'd probably do
it and sell the stuff but, you know, I don't have enough time to do it to
really, you know, take orders on it,

A.53:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.54:  you know, it's like I can only do it when I have time.  I have a whole
stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is, so.

A.55:  Do you, um, I know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here
at college, and I make them also, is the padded covered photo albums?

B.56:  Oh yeah, uh-huh, I do, I've done those too, before, yeah.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  Those are real, I, I have a co-, several of those that I've made like as
wedding gifts, you know.  I made them out of all lace and, and satin, you
know, and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that, so.  

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Those are real popular, in fact, I got some of those for my wedding, so.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  I know they're real popular here at school, also.

B.62:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, those are fun to do, and just little things, you know,
I, I didn't have a lot of, when I was in college I did, you know,

A.63:  [Whispering] {Sounds like caller A is whispering to someone else in the
room}.

B.64:  I did sewing for other people when I had time, you know, like if somebody
needed a bridesmaids, maids dress made, I'd make that, but that's about all the
sewing I did, I never had time for, you know, to sew myself a new dress or
anything like that so, but, yeah.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  I just kind of sew for my kids and that's about it, so.

A.67:  [Laughter].

@@B.68:  Well, I guess maybe we've co-, covered the topic, pretty good.

A.69:  Yeah.  I really don't have any other.

B.70:  Yeah, I'm not too much, uh, you know, [child] I don't have a lot of
hobbies, mine are just mostly, you know things I just do out of necessity.

A.71:  [Door] Uh-huh.

A.73:  It was nice talking to you too.
