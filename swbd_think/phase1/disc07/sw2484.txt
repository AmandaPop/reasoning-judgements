A.1:  Hello [Talking] [clicking] [breathing] [static].

B.2:  Hello [Breathing] [static].

A.3:  Hi, uh, my name's Nicole.

B.4:  Hi, Nicole, I'm Mary Ann.

A.5:  Uh, where are you Mary Ann?

B.6:  Uh, I'm in McKinney.

A.7:  Oh, I, I'm in Dallas #[Laughter].#

B.8:  #I see.#  Okay.

A.9:  [Laughter] Not very long distance.

B.10:  No, not at all.

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  and, yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll
call.

A.13:  Yes, it would [laughter].  Okay, are you, uh, do you know about the topic?

B.14:  Uh, if, if I understood correctly it was what, what changes we might, uh,
suggest or whatever for the justice system?  Is that?

A.15:  Yeah.  It, uh, justice system, #uh, and, uh,#

B.16:  #[Laughter].  Perhaps above# my head.

A.17:  what we think about the judge, changing it to, so the judge would do the
conviction, or no, sentencing.

B.18:  #Sentencing,#

A.19:  #Sentencing.#

B.20:  and would all the jurors have to agree on.  Okay.

A.21:  Okay.

B.22:  That would be a good place to start.

A.23:  All right, I'm going to press one.

@B.24:  All right.  Have you ever served on a, on a jury trial?

A.25:  Yes, one time [noise].  One time.  But we found him innocent.  So, uh,  

B.26:  Was it, was it a criminal?

A.27:  Yes.  It was,

B.28:  Okay.

A.29:  this guy bit another guy's finger off [laughter].

B.30:  Oh, oh [laughter].

A.31:  But, he deserved it, I probably would have bit his finger off too if he was
trying to strangle me,

B.32:  [Noise] (( )).

A.33:  or beat me up, you know, if I could have gotten his hand in my mouth, I
would have bit him just like this guy did.  He was scared, he was a kid.

B.34:  Oh, my.

A.35:  You know, and the guy was trying to beat him up.  This older teenager was
shacking up with this guy's ex-wife --

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  -- or something.  They were, uh, uh, they were really in a mess and there
were children involved and it was just terrible.

B.38:  Uh.

A.39:  But, I didn't think anybody, you know, they all deserved to go to jail
[laughter], not just the one guy, you know.

B.40:  It really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing.

A.41:  It really was, he was trying to beat him up, so, you know, we found him
innocent.  So, I really don't know what happens after you find them guilty.  I
thought that the Judge did do the sentencing [/Talking].

B.42:  No.  I served on, on both a criminal and a, a civil, uh, jury, and in my
criminal trial he pled guilty, uh, to the first, to, to kidnapping,

A.43:  [Gasp].

B.44:  and so we went through the second part of the trial because in Texas there
are two parts.  First of all to find if they are guilty or innocent.  He
already said he was guilty so then, then we go through the trial to determine
what, uh, punishment should be meted out.

A.45:  #Oh.#

B.46:  #So,# we still went through three days of, of, uh, testimony and so forth.
And, and witnesses saying, [breathing] oh, he's an upstanding young man, just
weak and was led by another guy and so forth.  So, we were the ones that, that
came up with the sentence and the Judge gave us some parameters and said, you
know, according to the law it can be no more or no le-, uh, no more or less
than and he gave the, the number of years.  And, he said it would also include
a, a possible fine up to ten thousand dollars and, and we had, that, that took
us six hours just to agree on what we thought was appropriate for this young
man.

A.47:  Good grief.  That would be hard to do.  #You know,#

B.48:  #Uh,# it wasn't the easiest thing I've done, but no, nor was it hard.  To
us the young man had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty,

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  so we did not, we didn't have to struggle at all with that.  It was now,
what's fitting and, and we'd gone through all that, so I, I don't know, I
thought that was easier than, than trying to decide,

A.51:  Yeah, #whether he's guilty or,#

B.52:  #his guilt or innocence.# 

A.53:  #Yeah.# 

B.54:  #Yeah.#

A.55:  That's true.

B.56:  I, I probably would not mind letting the Judge do the sentencing, as long
as the jury of, of peers were determining guilt or innocence.  For one thing,
we didn't know that the others involved in the trial had, uh, I, I mean had, I
mean involved in the crime had already come up for trial, we couldn't know
what had come of their, uh, sentencing.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  and, and we couldn't know that until after we had made our findings.  So,
it turned out we had done about what the other juror had done, and so it, you
know, we felt a little better.  But, I think if that could be in the hands of,
of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information, seems like
it would be fairer.

A.59:  Is it different in different states, do you know?

B.60:  Since it's state, uh, laws.  Yes.

A.61:  Because I know on some times the news, you know, and they say the Judge
gives the sentencing.  And, so, that's what, I guess I thought it was that way
everywhere.  Being as I hadn't been all the way through, you know, anything
like that.

B.62:  It, now it may be on some Federal Laws, you know, it, it, this was a,
{pause} we were dealing with, uh, with the state #laws, not necessarily,#

A.63:  #State, yeah.#

B.64:  fed-, not necessarily federal.  That may have something to do with it.
And, it may be too that if it were, um, a capital crime, uh, capital murder or
something like that, that it may be different.

A.65:  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't, oh, that would be hard.

B.66:  Yes, it would.

A.67:  It would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really,
really, really sure.  You would have to be really, really, really sure that he
did it.  I mean really sure [Noise].

B.68:  I had a friend who sat in on a, or who was on a jury recently for a murder.
But, the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even
an option.  Uh, the death penalty was not an option.  So, in, in this case
everyone on the jury felt that it should have been [laughter] and they were
very convinced the man had no redeeming, uh, qualities, and couldn't be
rehabilitated and they were, they were really upset that he was getting off so
lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in.

A.69:  [/Noise] Oh.

B.70:  I'm real glad that I don't, that I don't work in that kind of a, a back,
background.  I'll take my job any day.

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  #Right [laughter].#

A.73:  #Yeah.#  ((Think)) of the #pressures.#

B.74:  #I don't# work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does, but I
can handle the imperfections that I'm around.  I, I could not work in the, in
the, uh, criminal area for very long as a, as a police officer, as, uh,
someone who works for the court system or whatever.

A.75:  Yeah (( )).

B.76:  So, anyway, back to the original question.  I really think I, if, if we
were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence, I'd be more than happy to let
the Judge determine the, uh,

A.77:  The sentencing.

B.78:  #the sentencing.#

A.79:  #Yeah, I agree# with you.  Right. I do agree with you.  I, I figure that
it's been a couple of years now since I've served now, so I'm, I've been
looking lately for mine, [laughter] it's about time for me to get called up
down there again.

B.80:  Um.

A.81:  So, I enjoy doing it.

B.82:  I do too.

A.83:  As long as I get paid well.  #[Laughter].#

B.84:  #[Laughter].#

A.85:  Now before I worked for T I and I didn't get, uh, time off for jury duty,
you know.  It was difficult,

B.86:  Oh.  #I bet.#

A.87:  #because# there are a lot of places that don't give you ti-, I mean, they
give you the time but not the pay.

B.88:  I see, okay.

A.89:  So, you know, you lose a day's pay and you, well, you make about eight
dollars or whatever it is [laughter], #you know.#

B.90:  #Big deal.# Oh, you make eight dollars now in Dallas County, huh, it's only
seven fifty here in Collin.

A.91:  I think it's eight.  It might, I, #I don't remember,#

B.92:  #It probably is,# which is about what it costs you to park your car, right?

A.93:  Well, they send you a free bus ticket.

B.94:  Oh, do they.

A.95:  And I use it.

B.96:  Oh, okay.

A.97:  So, you know, I come out pretty good on it, I mean I get, plus my T I
money, I come out real good on it now [laughter].

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  The last one I served on I was working at T I and so I got time off for it.
But I was working third shift and that made it a little difficult,

B.100:  Oh.

A.101:  to decide,

B.102:  I can see how that would be #difficult.#

A.103:  #yeah,# to decide which day to take off and, you know, do you take off
day after you go or before you go, so,

B.104:  [Laughter] Oh, that would be tough.

A.105:  so, it was tough.  So, but anyway, well, I don't have much
more to say about it.

B.106:  What about the other suggestion that they had that, uh, about the ju-,
all the jury agreeing on the sentencing.  Do you feel that that
is a requirement?

A.107:  I think if anybody has a doubt, you need to, yeah, I do feel
that, yes, I really do.

B.108:  That there should be a-, agreement?

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  I think I do too.

A.111:  Because someone might see something that you don't see.  I mean, you know,
they may have, they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt,
that,

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  you know, yeah, I really think that everybody needs to agree.

B.114:  It's, it's, it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes
man and get carried up along with the emotions, and so, if there's somebody
who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt, I would a whole lot
rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than
that a justice not be meted out correctly.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  So.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  I agree with, boy it's really easy [laughter] to discuss something when you
both agree [laughter].

A.119:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, you know that, I mean I, you have to agree on this
almost, I would think.  I can't imagine not agreeing that everybody should
agree on a jury.  I, I, I don't know, I, when we, we all really agreed on
this.  Did you all have any disagreements when you were doing the
sentencing?

B.120:  Well, it took us six hours to reach agreement.  Yeah.

A.121:  I can't remember how many, it didn't take us but an hour, I think, or an
hour and a half.  We were all pretty, I think we had one man in there that,
uh, wanted to find him guilty, because he kept saying, he did it.  Then we
kept saying, he did it, but, the other guy, you know, we had to convince him
that, um, you know, that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty, he didn't need to
go to jail for doing it.

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  That was, you know, he did it, he admitted that he bit that guys finger,
but he did it in self defense.  So, you know, we just didn't feel that he
#needed,# 

B.124:  #apparently# you all were successful in, uh, convincing him at last
[/Breathing] [/static].

A.125:  Yes, finally we di-, it didn't take [/clicking] [/breathing] [/static],
