===========================================================================

A.1:  We've, my husband's retired and we vacationed a lot and I think I've had a
lot in the meantime.  I'm not sure I would have picked that one either
[laughter].

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Shall we have a go at it? [laughter] [beep].

B.4:  Sure.  Okay.   

A.5:  Uh,

B.6:  Trial by jury.

@A.7:  I think one of the facets of living in a small town is that oftentimes
you are, uh, sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at
least, maybe not that person, but part of their family.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  So that might lead you to a biased, uh, decision perhaps, if you
were.

A.9:  I would think so.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  On the other hand, uh, I don't know if, course the judge as all
the expertise in that field and he's trained for that and, and I'm sure there
are certain rules that are set down that he goes by, uh, along the way to make
a decision.  But, perhaps the jury can, uh, give their, uh, input as to what
they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there.  Uh, have you
ever sat on a jury trial?

A.11:  Yes, I have.

B.12:  Yeah, I have, too, and I found it real interesting but,

A.13:  I did, t-, yes.

B.14:  But, we weren't given any opportunity to make a decision as to what would
happen.  We just said whether or not we thought the party was guilty --

A.15:  Um.

B.16:  -- and he took it from there.

A.17:  Uh, the last trial I sat on, at the end of the session the prosecuting
attorney called us into a private room, and more or less instructed us to find
her not guilty because even though they knew and they proved that she had set
fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money, that would we find
her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any
kind whatsoever.  Which, we did find her guilty against his instruction --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and she did flee the state.  But,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter] but she was guilty and, we just didn't understand why he was
doing that.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  That would merely make for some odd behavior on the, on their part
[throat_clearing].

A.23:  My husband sat in on a jury trial, a murder trial that lasted for two weeks
--

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- that left him, uh, I mean, in the very beginning he was convinced that
the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally
voted, uh, guilty --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- uh, which surprised me that, that, uh, through the jury discussion they
were able to convince him against his original opinion so, maybe that speaks
well for juries.

B.28:  Yeah.  I, I remember the one that I sat in on.  We had quite a problem
coming to a conclusion and, and we came back with so many people this way and
so many that way and the judge told us we couldn't leave until we came to a
decision and we just could not.  We were split and he kept us there one
evening until seven, uh, and everyone wanted to go home and so they were
willing, some of them were willing to change their, uh, decision just to get
out of, uh, out of the jury room.

A.29:  That doesn't seem fair, does it?

B.30:  No, and I, I couldn't believe they would do that, so maybe in a way it
should be left up to the judge because, uh, maybe the jury isn't, uh, going to
give them an honest decision.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  You know, I, I don't know, I guess if, if we had more power, we're just
people off the street, so to speak, and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- we don't have the, the, uh, background, to maybe make that decision.

A.35:  The only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in, uh,
Chicago, where so many judges were guilty of so much misjustice from the
bench.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  That, after all, they're only people, too, in that they're subject to
corruption just like any other human being,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  and they do have a lot of power.   

B.40:  Uh-huh.  It seems, uh, sometimes it seems, uh, rather, I guess rather, uh,
odd that one person would have that deciding factor.  He would be the sole
factor, uh, determining a person's outcome.  I guess, though, but the jury
still has their input and maybe he goes, uh, has a lot to decide, has to
decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case, too.

A.41:  Maybe we both agree, then, that we need to keep juries and, 

B.42:  I think so.

A.43:  I think so [laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter] We could go on.

A.45:  I think we've reached a decision [laughter].

B.46:  I think we have.

A.47:  Nice visiting with you.

B.48:  Thank you, bye-bye.

A.49:  Bye.
