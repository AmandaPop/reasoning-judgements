==========================================================================

B.1:  Oh, mostly we watch college basketball.

A.2:  Oh, do you?

B.3:  Yeah, and, uh, you know, [baby_crying] we're from, uh, originally from
Louisville, Kentucky.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  And they've got a fairly decent ball club down there.

A.6:  Yeah, it's been around for a long time, hasn't it.

B.7:  Uh, as long as I can remember. 

A.8:  Yeah.  Who's the coach's name?

B.9:  Denny Crum.

A.10:  Yeah, that sounds familiar.

B.11:  Yeah, Denny Crum's pretty good.

A.12:  Yeah.

B.13:  He, uh, I don't know, he's got a million dollar contract when he quits.
{Man's voice in background}.

A.14:  And with pro ball, you mean?

B.15:  No, with, uh, when he quits, they'll give him a million dollars.  {Man's
voice in background}.

A.16:  Who will? The opponents?  [laughter].

B.17:  Denny C-, uh, uh, Louisville University.  The university gives him a
million dollars when he quits.

A.18:  Well, why, 

B.19:  (( )).

A.20:  that doesn't make sense, does it?

B.21:  Because he's good.  And it's giving him an incentive to stay around, and,
uh, he's been there for some-, twenty something years --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- and, uh, I really don't know the, uh, full reason why they're doing 
it --

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  -- but they've got confidence in the man.

A.26:  Yeah.  But to me, I'd want to quit [laughter].

B.27:  Oh, he gets too much, he get-, you know.

A.28:  Oh, that just shows how much he gets paid anyway.

B.29:  Yeah.  

A.30:  Huh.

B.31:  He's got a T V show down there and everything.

A.32:  Really?  Where are you all living now?

B.33:  In Denison.

A.34:  Denison?

B.35:  Texas.

A.36:  Yeah.  Do you ever watch the Mavericks?

B.37:  Sometimes.

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  Not a lot, uh, I, I don't really care for pro basketball.  I like college
basketball and pro football.

A.40:  Huh.

B.41:  But I do watch some, uh, pro foot-, basketball, mostly it's, uh, I watch
certain players.

A.42:  Yeah, like who?

B.43:  Oh, Magic Johnson.

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  Uh, Larry Bird.

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  Uh, Michael Jordan.

A.48:  Yeah, he's good, too.

B.49:  An-, I can name a few more, I just can't think of their names,

A.50:  [Laughter].

B.51:  right off hand.  Uh.

A.52:  I used to watch basketball, in fact of, of the pro sports I guess it's my
favorite.  It's just that I haven't watched many sports this year, or in the
past several years.

B.53:  Well, the, uh, N C double A tournament's going on right now, and, uh, I
haven't watched it this year because Louisville's out of it this year.

A.54:  How come?

B.55:  Oh, they just, uh, they had three tall guys who had, uh, didn't meet the
requirements, you know, uh,

A.56:  The, uh, academic requirements?

B.57:  Yeah, academically, 

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  they didn't meet the requirements, so they couldn't play this year s-,
four of them, they had four people.

A.60:  Huh.

B.61:  My husband's sitting here putting four fingers in my face [laughter].

A.62:  [Laughter].

B.63:  Four [laughter].  Uh, but they weren't very good, but they was, uh,

A.64:  four out of five hurts.

B.65:  Huh?

A.66:  Four out of five hurts.

B.67:  Yeah, well, I think they got, 

A.68:  [Clicking].

B.69:  I think that was almost everyone of them that he recruited, recruited for
this year.

A.70:  Huh.

B.71:  He didn't, and none of them got to play [Voices].

A.72:  So, well, no wonder they're out of it [clicking].

B.73:  Uh, sorry.

A.74:  I said, no wonder they're out of it.

B.75:  Yeah, well they put up a good show.  They did pretty good for, uh,

A.76:  [Clicking].

B.77:  you know, having all short people, and, uh,

A.78:  Uh-huh.

B.79:  we only had one, we only had one senior on the team.

A.80:  So they'll be back.

B.81:  S-, next year they'll be back,

A.82:  Uh-huh.

B.83:  and back with a vengeance.

A.84:  Well, do you agree with that requirement that they meet those, uh,
academic?

B.85:  In some states, yeah, because it's reasonable.  Now, you know, with me
being from Louisville, I'm going to say at Louisville it was unfair, because
Louisville's got the highest, um, uh, the line, the line, the line drawn, I
don't know the correct word for it.

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  But Louisville's is higher than most other universities and, 

A.88:  Well, I didn't realize it could vary from state to,

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  state or univers-, to,

B.91:  Yeah, they, they vary from university, not just state to state, university.

A.92:  Huh.

B.93:  {Man's voice in background} If they'd been anywhere else, I don't, you
know, I don't care where it was, anywhere in the United States, they could
have played.  But being they was in Louisville, they couldn't play.

A.94:  How does that coach feel about that?

B.95:  Oh, he's highly upset.  He, uh, went on, uh, he was on, uh, TWENTY TWENTY
or SIXTY MINUTES, I can't remember which one, and got blasted.  Uh, you know,
they, uh, that's where it all came about, because he said a few remarks about,
on that, uh, talk show or --

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  -- news show, and then they, uh, next thing you know, well, they're in
violation if they don't, uh, if they keep playing they're in violation.

A.98:  Huh.

B.99:  So, but, uh, Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much [laughter].

A.100:  [Laughter]  On national T V?

B.101:  On national T V.  #He messed up.  But, uh,# 

A.102:  #Yeah,# it's all politics.

B.103:  Probably, that's probably,

A.104:  Yeah.

B.105:  what it mostly is.  I, I can't say that for sure.  But, you know, uh,
right now, though, Kentucky's just now getting off of a, uh, their suspension
from playing on, uh, T V and then games.

A.106:  Uh-huh.

B.107:  Next year they'll be, uh, playing, and I know Memphis State was even in a
few of them, where they go-, uh, couldn't play --

A.108:  Huh.

B.109:  --in, uh, games and stuff because of, uh, uh, Dana Kirk, that was their
coach down there, uh, or over there.  Uh, he, he was, uh, we was living in
Memphis for a while, that's why I know about Memphis State.

A.110:  Uh-huh.

B.111:  Uh, he was selling soda machines at the, uh, selling, like Coca Cola had
given him --

A.112:  Uh-huh.

B.113:  -- uh, for this little, uh, this little, uh, {man's voice in background}
kid's, uh, basketball camp.  That's what it is.  These little kids would come
here, and, uh, Coca Cola had sponsored the, uh, sodas, you know, just give
them to him,

A.114:  Uh-huh.

B.115:  told him to give them to the boys.

A.116:  Uh-huh.

B.117:  Well, he sold them for something like fifty, seventy-five cents to these
boys, when he's supposed to be give them to them.

A.118:  Oh for heaven's sake.  #What a cheapskate.#

B.119:  #And, uh,# yeah, he was a, he was, we call him Dana Jerk.

A.120:  Yeah, oh.

B.121:  {Man talking in background} And he blames all of his, uh, tax problems on
his elementary school wife.

A.122:  His elementary school wife?

B.123:  Yeah, she, she never even got out of elementary school.

A.124:  Oh, really?

B.125:  Um.

A.126:  Well, she might have been the cause of it [laughter].

B.127:  No, he was just a jerk, He put, uh,

A.128:  Yeah.

B.129:  he put the blame on everyone but himself.

A.130:  Yeah.

B.131:  He went out and, you know, bought the, bought recruits.

A.132:  Oh.

B.133:  N-, I'm sure you know that's one thing you don't do.

A.134:  Yeah.

B.135:  He went out and did that, and he got caught.  And then he got caught with
the taxes, and then he got caught with the sodas, and that soda really went
over on the people in Memphis.  They really got hot about that.

A.136:  Yeah, I can imagine, especially the kids that were buying them.

B.137:  These were young kids too.  

A.138:  Yeah.

B.139:  They couldn't have been out of middle school.

A.140:  Huh.  Well, that almighty dollar.

B.141:  Y-, well, that's, yeah, I, I'll agree there.

A.142:  Uh-huh.

B.143:  More powerful than you think.

@@A.144:  Yeah it is.  Well, I think we met our time limit.

B.145:  Yeah, I think, guess we did, 

A.146:  So,

B.147:  too.  All right, well --

A.148:  I thank you very much.

B.149:  -- well you have a good day.

A.150:  Bye-bye.

B.151:  Bye-bye.
