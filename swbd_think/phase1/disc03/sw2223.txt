=============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay the topic that we had Victoria, again, as I mentioned was, what do
you feel is wrong with our public school system and I guess if I were to look
at with four grown children and having been thr-, all of them, four of them
through public schools and colleges, I guess the public school system I would
have to say is that we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more --

B.2:  Exactly [laughter].

A.3:  -- we need to, we need to probably try to get more one on one with the
teachers and the, and the students if we could.

B.4:  Smaller classrooms possibly.

A.5:  And the other thing was we need to really, really tighten up our discipline
in schools because they run, here in New England, I'm not sure about the rest
of the country, but I know the schools are almost running rampant up here.

B.6:  Exactly.

A.7:  And it's too bad because there are, you know, serious drinking problems
with, with real, uh, you know, young, young kids.  I'm talking kids that are
nine, ten, eleven, twelve years old, drug problems.  These,

B.8:  I would [throat_clearing].

A.9:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.

B.10:  When I was in school, uh, I was supposedly in one of the best school
systems in the country in Fairfax County and I'm, I think back and I, I don't
feel like, I, I could have learned a lot more and don't feel like I learned as
much.  I've only been out of school, high school for four years, but --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- I think I could have learned a lot more and I, I worry about the
children that are in the other school systems that aren't as good, uh, I don't
know any particular ones but, you know, when, when they say that one of the,
where I went to school was one of the best counties,

A.13:  Yeah, I lived,

B.14:  then I think,

A.15:  I lived, that's just outside of Washington.  I lived in Fairfax County.
That was really, really a nice, nice area down there.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And my, I had the same situation here.  My kids were, we brought them up
and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and they were not, not
too, too bad, and this is going back, like, ten years, I guess, ten years ago.
They were not too, too bad at that time.  And I was fortunate enough to have
the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with, with T I, with my 
job --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and I worked there in the southwest for ten, almost ten or eleven years.
And the kids got a, my kids got a much better edu-, education in Texas simply
because they had the opportunity to have more one on one --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- uh, relationships with the, with the, uh, the faculty, okay.  And, and
that helped, like, especially one of my sons, he was, he could learn, but he
really had to work at learning if,

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  if that makes sense to you.  And, and, uh, again, like you say, there
was, and you're still a student and there's so much more you could have
learned and, but I, I, I don't know, I think discipline, I guess.  If I were
to look at one thing, we've lost, oh, kids used to have a respect for the
teacher, I guess,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  at one time, but I think we've kind of lost that in our school system and
I'm not really sure how to get it back.  I say discipline, and that might be
the wrong choice of words, but, i-,

B.26:  I know, uh, I know with, uh, I think teachers need to be paid more.  I have
a lot of friends who, and myself who thought about going into elementary
education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got
and said, well, there's a lot of other things I could do --

A.27:  #Oh, yeah, it's so, it --#   

B.28:  #-- making a lot more money.#   

A.29:  -- it's so hard and, it's so hard to compete and that's not one of the
things that's going to make the people, like yourself, that are just
graduating colleges, you know, or across the country, want to go jumping into
a, an,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  education field when the, when there's, you can almost double your pay in
almost any other field, you know, for,

B.32:  Exactly.

A.33:  as a, as a entry level.  And I'm not saying that we should give them the
world, either, but I think we ought to pay them a little more money.

B.34:  Uh-huh.   

A.35:  Uh, they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and I don't
really believe that.  I think it's a lot more than that.

B.36:  Uh-huh.   

A.37:  When you figure the hours and time they put in the school and stuff.  All
right and even if it is only a hundred and eighty days a year, let's pay them
for the hundred and eighty days a year.  I mean,

B.38:  And, and I mean that, their, their day doesn't end, you know,

A.39:  No, no, they,

B.40:  when school's out.

A.41:  that's what I mean.  At one time we, we used to be able to carry that
over to the kids.  Of course I, I can see the teacher's point, too, where at,
at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about
kids, so,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  but if they had some, probably some ((renumeration)) to help them say,
you know, maybe I'll give this kid a little extra help or something --

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  -- in the long run I think it would really be worthwhile.  

B.46:  I mean, they, they, uh, go home and grade papers, lesson plans, prepare for
the next day.

A.47:  What is, what is your major in school that you're,

B.48:  I'm an interior design major.   

A.49:  uh, super, that he sounds good.   

B.50:  [Lipsmack] Yep, so,   

A.51:  And you're finishing up this year, huh.   

B.52:  Exactly, in May.   

A.53:  Well, that's great.  I, I wish you all the best in y-, in your future, in
your endeavors out there in whatever you're doing.

B.54:  Yeah.   

A.55:  And it's good to talk to a, a, a student, rather than, most of the folks
I've talked to are, are industrial people that, like myself, that have been in
the work-, [breathing] --

B.56:  Uh-huh.    

A.57:  -- work force for a number of years and, and it's a, it's refreshing to
talk to, to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and, and things, you
know.  And see how you feel about things.

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

A.59:  Well, I don't know what else we can do about this school situation,
Victoria, and if there's anything else you'd like to add.

B.60:  I think that's about it.   

A.61:  You have a nice day --  

B.62:  You, too.   

A.63:  -- and I'm going to say good-bye for now and if you're ever up in Rhode
Island way, around T I, look me up, it's Ray Smith at T I in Attleboro,
Massachusetts.

B.64:  All righty.   

A.65:  Have a nice one, Victoria.   

B.66:  You, too.   

A.67:  And good luck in your future.   

B.68:  Thank you.   

A.69:  Bye-bye.   

B.70:  Bye-bye.
