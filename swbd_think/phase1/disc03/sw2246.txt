============================================================================

A.1:  So, Eric, what do you think, um, that,

B.2:  Well, I'm more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term
effects in terms of, uh, balancing budget and so forth.

A.3:  Yeah.   

B.4:  Um, I tend to view, um, and I take a fairly radical view towards economic
policy and feel that, well, it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at, uh, on
in (( )) instances I think that goods should cost, um, real total costs rather
than just manufacturing costs.  And that means, uh, if you, oh, produce
something that creates, uh, uh, adverse health effects, that should somehow be
reflected in the product if you, uh, the cost of forestry that you cut down
and such needs to be reflected.

A.5:  So, you think that they, that those, 

B.6:  In,

A.7:  products should cost more?   

B.8:  Well, I think, I think my long-term sense of, of budget concerns is that
we're going, is, a lot of ((other)) government's spending goes on, goes
towards this, uh, health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor
health or need for health care are brought about by various factors,

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  such as, such as pollution, stress, you know, work, work environment
conditions and so forth.

A.11:  Yeah.   

B.12:  But general the government is, government or individuals end up paying for
that rather than the, uh, some of the source of need for the health care.

A.13:  Uh-huh.   

B.14:  Um, but that's a very long-term sort of concern.  Um, I don't, I don't have
great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes.  And
no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and, uh, no one likes the
idea of reducing spending very much so I don't see any real, uh, real
immediate hope.  I mean ((it's)) the whole ((quota's)) living on debt.

A.15:  (( )).  

B.16:  ((Ut-,)) and, 

A.17:  Uh-huh.   

B.18:  ((they buying)) on credits constantly.  

A.19:  Well, do they, I mean, um, I never liked doing that, 

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  and I, I didn't up until, uh, several years ago when it came down to the
point of, you don't have a choice.

B.22:  Yeah, well, exactly.  

A.23:  You know, if you, if you need to have a car, then you have no choice.

B.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.25:  And, uh, i-, it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things
like buy a house.

B.26:  Yes, well, I [laughter], I don't know anyone who paid cash for a house
that's for sure [laughter].

A.27:  Really, I mean, so, what choice do you have.   

B.28:  Yeah,  

A.29:  Then,

B.30:  you don't have much.  Um, I, I mean it seems to me one might have choices
if one radically restructured the system, but that's not really a possibility
at this point.  It has it's own inertia and, 

A.31:  Yeah.  ((I did)) it's just that, uh, there needs to be some, some change
take place so that the inertia can began to go in a different direction than
straight down.

B.32:  Yeah [laughter] I hope so.   

A.33:  You know [laughter], that's the problem that I think we have.

B.34:  Yeah.  Well, I'm, I'm in academics and actually I'm in the job market now
trying to get a professorship and I'm watching, uh, the education budget
getting cut back so severely, um, at least in California where I am where
there's a very severe budget crisis,

A.35:  Uh-huh.    

B.36:  because of agriculture was wiped out last year and a number of other
things.

A.37:  Yeah.   

B.38:  And, uh, I'm, I, I have a lot of, I have some personal investments in this.

A.39:  Uh-huh.   

B.40:  Uh, in addition to whatever philosophical investment there is, and I don't
know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a, uh, a major
loaning nation to a major debt nation in the,

A.41:  Yeah.   

B.42:  in the course of a decade.

A.43:  Uh-huh.   

B.44:  We are (( )) a lot has changed more radically.  And,

A.45:  Well, we were, we were in debt before that, it just wasn't as apparent.

B.46:  Yeah, it was it's, it's, uh, seems to have worsened considerably.

A.47:  Somehow we still, I guess, believed that the countries that we were helping
were, were eventually going to pay us back, and that hasn't happened.

B.48:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, well, I can see, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's
kind of funny because we, it seems like we loan money, you know, we money with
strings attached, and if the government changes and the country that we loan
the money to, um, I can see why they might have a different attitude towards
paying it back.

A.49:  Uh-huh.   

B.50:  It's a lot (( )), you know, we don't really loan money to, to countries.
We loan money to governments.  And it's the,

A.51:  Oh, that's true.   

B.52:  and it's the governments, 

A.53:  I hadn't thought of it that way, I think,

B.54:  it's the governments, that, that's really what we do.  You don't go up to
the country, you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group
and you loan it to these people who are representing the government.  And by
extension representing the country, but when those people are gone, and you
have some new, you know, starving third world country with a brand new
government that threw the previous rascals out.  Um, they're personal
incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low.

A.55:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.56:  Because it's, they didn't, they didn't borr-, I mean, you know, it would be
like you paying off the debts of, uh, some neighbors of yours.  You wouldn't
feel very happy about it.

A.57:  Yeah, that's true.   

B.58:  So, (( )) sort of like this is, uh, mi-, h-, I see a mis-, I don't know
there's, (( )) if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to
and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to.

A.59:  Yeah.  In some, in some cases it, uh, I think it's actually going to, you
know, the people that it's intended for and other cases, uh, and, and this is
all based, and this is all up to actually the government that's in control.

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.61:  Now in some cases the, the money actually does filter down to the, to where
it's supposed to get to.

B.62:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.63:  And in other cases it, it does not.   

B.64:  Yeah, I, I, I tend to get a little upset about loans to coun-, to obviously
corrupt governments.

A.65:  Yeah.   

B.66:  Um, there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of
the neighboring government or something like that so we,

A.67:  Yeah.   

B.68:  give them an ((either)) corrupt government anyway, but it's hard to view
that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point.  Um,

A.69:  I don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for
that, um, I know that they're trying to be, they're, that they're supposedly
trying to be fair with taxes, and by making it more equal but I can't really
understand why, um, it has to be the same percentage.  Where you have someone
that makes, um, a very low amount of money,

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  the same percentage may affect them thirty-five or forty times more
severely,

B.72:  Uh-huh.   

A.73:  than the same percentage of someone's, well, if they earn a great deal of
money and I would, being somewhere in the middle, feel like that it would be a
lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted,

B.74:  Uh-huh.   

A.75:  toward the top end.  If I, I can put my, you know, I think to myself, if
I had that much money,

B.76:  You could afford to pay more taxes.   

A.77:  I could afford to pay more taxes.

B.78:  Uh-huh.   

A.79:  It wouldn't bother me a bit.

B.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, boy, uh, I mean, I completely agree with you, um, on
the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over
the last ten years.  Um,

A.81:  Yeah, they used to have and what do they, I don't know what the percentage
is now, they used to be taxed thirty percent.

B.82:  Yeah it's, it,  

A.83:  And I remember hearing an interview with, uh, who was it, the man who
invented Hawaiian Tropic,

B.84:  Uh-huh.   

A.85:  you know, and he, he was talking about that.  He was talking about nobody
went broke over paying thirty percent.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  Well, the U S pays, 

A.87:  You know.  

B.88:  the U. S. pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country.

A.89:  Well that's,  

B.90:  Um (( )),  

A.91:  They, they get, we-, it, it depends on how you look at that because like
Sweden,

B.92:  Uh-huh.   

A.93:  they pay a lot in taxes, but their day care is government subsidized.

B.94:  Yeah they,  

A.95:  Women who,  

B.96:  they get things that they pay for.

A.97:  want to stay home with their children,

B.98:  Uh-huh.   

A.99:  are subsidized,   

B.100:  Uh-huh.    

A.101:  to do that.  

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  They don't have to live, um, hand-to-mouth,  

B.104:  Uh-huh.   

A.105:  because it, the government there and the country there has placed a very
significant value on motherhood.

B.106:  Yeah, right, I think that's, um, well, I think that's an important thing
personally.  Um,

A.107:  Uh-huh.  I think we could learn some things from, and the, and the health
care system.  You may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of.

B.108:  Uh-huh.   

A.109:  And you don't have the corruption in, in, uh, medicine,  

B.110:  Well they,  

A.111:  that, that we have here with the, the outrageous charges and,

B.112:  Yeah, I think the, the Americans that I know who are, are, are sort of
anti-tax, (( )) seem anti-tax because they're distrustful of the government
will spend their money wisely.  And the sense is, I can spend the money on
myself, if I gave it to the government they would just waste it.  Seems to be
a, not an attitude I hear is a lot of people,

A.113:  Huh.   

B.114:  and I think you hear that att-, you, if you go to Sweden, you won't hear
that as much.  People will say, well, we need those services.  And we've re-,

A.115:  Yeah.   

B.116:  makes our country great so we will, are more willing to pay for it.  I,

A.117:  Yeah, I think that if we could model, you know, programs after those that
are already, I mean, they did a lot of work.

B.118:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.119:  Finding a program that worked, 

B.120:  Yeah.   

A.121:  and if we were to do the research, take under advisement what they have
already working, and adapt it the, that, that particular day care system,

B.122:  Uh-huh.   

A.123:  um, works very well, and the Canadian health plan is probably the best
one in existence today.

B.124:  Yeah, well, it, it may not last [laughter] once they,  

A.125:  [Laughter]. 

B.126:  I hope it does but it's, uh, it's, uh, sad situation.  Part of this,
this, you, you hear the phrase creeping socialism,

A.127:  Huh.   

B.128:  which is, uh, uh, a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such
types of spending programs.

A.129:  Yeah.   

B.130:  And, um, usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread
lines in Moscow, um, but if you use, I mean, this creeping ...
