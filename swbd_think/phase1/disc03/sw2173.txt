A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay, well, I guess I can tell you that tonight is MURPHY BROWN, that's the
one I don't miss --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  #I've never seen that before.#

B.4:  -- #and I don't know if you've seen that,# that's with Candace Bergen, and
[clinking],

A.5:  Uh-huh.  I've heard about it but I've never watched, in fact I don't
usually watch T V on Monday nights.

B.6:  Really [laughter].

A.7:  I guess I'm either just really tired from the weekend and I get hom-, well,
uh, I have aerobics on Monday nights, too.  I just didn't quite make it
tonight --

B.8:  Uh-huh [/clinking].

A.9:  -- because I was caught up at work for too long.

B.10:  Oh, gee.

A.11:  But, uh, yeah, I, I usually don't get home until eight o'clock, so that's
--

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- another good reason.  But,

B.14:  I'd say that's the only one I don't miss, or I try not to miss that one and
CHEERS on Thursdays.

A.15:  Yeah.  I like CHEERS.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  But those are probably about the only two that I, that I usually
hi-, [laughter] --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- with any regularity.

A.19:  Back when I had time to watch T V, oh, maybe last year when I wasn't doing
aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately, um, I liked THE
WONDER YEARS, and, uh, um, sometimes, every now and then I'll catch DOOGIE
HOWSER, because I think that comes on at eight on Wednesday nights, and that's
about the time I get home from aerobics and I turn on the T V as I sit down to
eat dinner --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and I'll catch that.

B.22:  My daughter watches that -- 

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- religiously.  We tape it for her, because it comes on at nine here --

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  -- and she has to go to bed at eight thirty.

A.27:  Oh, no [laughter]. 

B.28:  And, uh, so that, you know, we watch it too.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  While we're taping it, we watch it.

A.31:  Yeah, it's kind of cute.  Um.

B.32:  Yeah, I like the lessons.  It's a good, uh --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- good, it's got a lot of good morals to it.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  I enjoy that one.

A.37:  I like, uh, what is it on Tues-, oh, I think COACH is kind of funny on
Tuesday night.

B.38:  Oh, that's right, COACH --

A.39:  Yeah --

B.40:  -- yes --

A.41:  -- I like that one.

B.42:  -- that's another one --

A.43:  Uh.

B.44:  -- that I try not to miss, although it use to be better.  I don't know, it
seems.  Well,

A.45:  I haven't seen it in a while.

B.46:  yeah, I was going to say, I haven't seen the past couple episodes.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I think the last one I really saw was when he broke up with Christine.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And I was thinking, well, do I really want her to go back with such a jerk?

A.51:  I know [laughter].

B.52:  [Laughter].

A.53:  I know, it's funny that, that women even like that show, because he really
is, he's such a jerk.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  But then, it's just kind of funny, because yo-, you can sit there and laugh
and go, yeah, what a guy.

B.56:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.57:  Typical [laughter].

B.58:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.59:  But, uh, that one's kind of cute.  I'm real bad, I got hooked on a soap
opera when I was in college,

B.60:  Oh really.

A.61:  GENERAL HOSPITAL.  Everybody in the dorm watched it.  I mean everybody.
You were an outcast if you didn't,

B.62:  Really.

A.63:  gather in the T V room at two o'clock in the afternoon to watch,

B.64:  Um.

A.65:  this soap.  I mean, people scheduled their class around it, and
everything.  So I,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  I started watching it, and to this day I still watch it.  I just kind of
got caught in that, and then, after I moved out of the dorm, my roommates
watched GENERAL HOSPITAL, and they watched ALL MY CHILDREN, and some other
soaps, and I was going, I'm not even going to be near that T V when they have
any other soap on because I don't want to get stuck in another one.  One is
bad enough.  No more.  #But, uh,#

B.68:  #I know.#  Excuse me, just a minute, I think, Katy, get off the phone.
[Noise] {Phone hanging up noise} [laughter].

A.69:  Woops.  How old is she.

B.70:  Ten. 

A.71:  Oh [laughter].

B.72:  So, she's been ge-, hearing about the, the different calls,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  and I've, I've been in the middle of tests and stuff so I keep you
saying, oh press three [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah [laughter].

B.76:  [Laughter]  So.  Let's see, I was trying to think of, I don't think I've
ever watched any soap operas.  I thi-, my mom used to watch YOUNG AND THE
RESTLESS.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  But I don't, I don't watch them.

A.79:  Don't ever start.

B.80:  No [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter] That's just the thing.

B.82:  Well, my last boss's wife, she, oh gosh, she would run the tape player from
the minute she went to go do her aerobics, and she used to do like, um, filing
at the hospital.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  And I think she did some work at a thrift store.  So as long as she was
gone, for about four hours, well, maybe three, she would tape soap operas.

A.85:  Oh gosh.

B.86:  And, uh, she would watch them at night, when she came home.

A.87:  I just couldn't watch that much T V.

B.88:  [Laughter] I know, he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because, I
guess, for about four years now,

A.89:  Um.

B.90:  she, you know, he'll come home from work, and there she'll be --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- watching soap operas, ye-,  

A.93:  Yeah, course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate
into about two hours of T V watching time, because they're really half of it
is just commercials.  They play more commercials in soap operas than anything
I've ever seen in my life.

B.94:  Oh really [laughter].

A.95:  But still, I just don't think I could sit down for two hours, and
especially two hours of soap operas.  I'd, that'd be, that might be a real
good way just to break that habit --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- is to have to watch them for that long.  I'd kind of be like, uh, this
is enough [laughter].

B.98:  Right [laughter].

A.99:  I can't take this any more [laughter].

B.100:  #Yeah well, she's really# --

A.101:  #This is disgusting.#

B.102:  -- she's really into it, I guess, but.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  I never have g-, gotten used to, well, I just really never have been 
home --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- I think, during that time.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  And so I never had a chance, and even when I was in school, of course, I
always had classes about that time.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  So I never had a chance.  But GENERAL HOSPITAL, huh, is one to get hooked
on if you're going to get hooked [laughter].

A.111:  Yeah, yeah, I think so, I mean, I guess.  That's the only one I've ever
watched.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  And I just, I refused to, I mean, I never watched DALLAS or KNOTS LANDING
or any of those things,

B.114:  No.

A.115:  because it's like I don't want to get hooked into one of these things
that you have to watch it every week.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  I mean, you can watch COACH from time to time, and not have to, you know,
not feel like, Oh, wait, I'm missing an episode and I won't know what's going
on.

B.118:  Right, really.

A.119:  And so, that's fine.  And I like L A LAW, too.  That's another one.

B.120:  And I've never watched that.  I going to have to watch that sometime.

A.121:  It is pretty good.  I've watched it maybe five or six times.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  But it comes on kind of late on Thursday nights, and sometimes I'm trying
to get things done --

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  -- and get in bed so I can go to work, of, of course for you, it probably
comes on really late on Thursday night, come to think of it.

B.126:  Yeah, they, everything starts at eight.  

A.127:  Gosh [whispering].

B.128:  And then it goes through ten.

A.129:  Oh, gosh [laughter].

B.130:  And, uh, I don't think JOHNNY CARSON comes on until like eleven.

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  So everything, really, that's what's really cut into my T V watching --

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  -- is the time that everything comes on since it's all shifted back an
hour.

A.135:  Um.

B.136:  I just, I don't really have time to stay up late, and since I have to get
up so early to go to classes, I can't stay up past ten thirty, I'm falling
asleep anyway [laughter].

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  So [laughter].  I miss most everything anyway.

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  But, uh, let's see.

A.141:  I haven't watched JOHNNY CARSON in a long time.  I used to watch that, and
I used to watch DAVID LETTERMAN and --

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  -- things like that in college.  And LOVE CONNECTION.  That was one of my
favorite ones in college, because we'd get up in the, in the apartment and the
guys from downstairs, who, by the way, two of them were from San Antonio
[laughter].

B.144:  [Laughter].

A.145:  There were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  and they'd come upstairs and watch it with us.  And we'd all sit there
and, you know, we'd be yelling and going, pick this one, pick this one.  And
we just had, it was just a fun, you know,

B.148:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.149:  fun thing to watch.  But, uh.

B.150:  I've never seen it.  What is it?  Is it like a version of the dating game,
or.

A.151:  Kind of, yeah, 

B.152:  Huh.

A.153:  they have the three choices on video and, it's usually real funny,
because they'll usually get someone in there that, half the time the dates
didn't work out at all.  And they have to tell about their date and how it
went, and,

B.154:  Oh, God.

A.155:  half the time they'll say, well when he showed up at the door, he didn't
really look quite like his video.

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  And, I just wasn't real, sometimes they really burn each other.  It's
really kind of funny.

B.158:  That is terrible, and the other person has to hear it.  Uh, 

A.159:  Yeah, well then if the other person hears something like that, they come
back just as bad.

B.160:  Uh-huh.  Oh gosh.

A.161:  [Laughter] And he'll say, well, she underestimated her weight by quite a
bit [laughter].

B.162:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.163:  And, they, they just got, you know, they, they go back and forth, and it's
kind of funny.

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  Um, and then you'll see the real funny looking couples, and it's, it's,
it was just entertaining.

B.166:  Uh-huh.

A.167:  And of course that was, that's been probably oh, five, six, seven years
ago #[laughter].#

B.168:  #Oh gosh# I was going to say I never heard of #that one.  The LOVE
CONNECTION.#

A.169:  #We used to do that, but, uh,# I don't know if it even still comes on.

B.170:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.171:  But that was always fun.

B.172:  [Noise] Yeah, I hadn't heard that one.  Let's see, I can't, oh gosh,
tha-, that probably wipes out my whole inventory of T V shows, other than, um,
P B S.

A.173:  Yeah.

B.174:  I, right now they've got that Katherine Hepburn one where she's touring all
the gardens,

A.175:  Uh-huh.

B.176:  of Europe.  I, of course, have missed the first series of that but --

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  -- that's about the only thing that I really catch on P B S --

A.179:  Yeah.

B.180:  -- and, uh, we used to get Arts and Entertainment in San Antonio, and I, we
get a little bit of the good ones here, but we used to try and catch, uh, some
of the stuff they had on there.

A.181:  Uh-huh.

B.182:  And, like I said, [laughter] I don't really watch T V too much any more,
uh,

A.183:  Yeah, sometimes I'll turn on C N N or something like that in the morning
when I, if I, I get really sick of the radio in the morning, because they
just, they're so obnoxious.

B.184:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.185:  And so I'll turn on the T V and just, I can hear it back in the bathroom --

B.186:  Uh-huh.

A.187:  -- and, you know, keep up kind of what's going on in the world.  So I'll do
either C N N or GOOD MORNING AMERICA or something like that --

B.188:  Uh-huh.

A.189:  -- but, from time to time.

B.190:  Well, we used to watch C N N because that was the only thing on really
early that I,

A.191:  Uh-huh.

B.192:  could an update on all the news.  But with the war coverage.  I had had
it with reporters --

A.193:  Yeah.

B.194:  -- and the coverage.

A.195:  Yeah.

B.196:  And so, after a while, I just turned it off.  I said, I can't take it any
more, I just can't.

A.197:  Yeah, I haven't watched it since the war started.

B.198:  Uh-huh.

A.199:  I, C N N, though, was, it was a life saver for me.  Back in October, T I
had sent me to Taiwan.  Actually they sent me to six foreign countries.
Taiwan was right about in the middle.

B.200:  Uh-huh.

A.201:  And all they speak there is Chinese.  And in my hotel room there was
nothing but Chinese programs on.

B.202:  Oh.

A.203:  And they had C N N.

B.204:  Uh [laughter].

A.205:  And I just kept that thing on constantly because I was going, English
language, this is wonderful.

B.206:  Uh-huh. 

A.207:  And, and they, at least I kind of knew what was going on on the other side
of the world --

B.208:  Uh-huh [tapping].

A.209:  -- and trying to keep up with, okay, what's the weather been like, and
what's happening back in the U S, because by then I'd been out of the country
for three weeks --

B.210:  Yeah.

A.211:  -- already, and I was, I was, you know, wondering what's been happening
lately, but.

B.212:  I, I never knew that, I never even thought that they would have C N N on in
Taiwan.

A.213:  Yeah, believe it or not.

B.214:  I guess that keeps anybody that's traveling that's American over there,
[/tapping] you'd think that they'd put it on in Chinese or translate it in
Chinese.

A.215:  Yeah, it was in English.  They had it in Tokyo, too, in English.

B.216:  Huh.

A.217:  But they had, they had, they had MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, have you ever seen
that before?

B.218:  No, I've heard about it, I've seen a little bit of it.  It was kind of,
[laughter] I don't know.

A.219:  They had that on in Tokyo.  I watched it one night.  I've seen it here
before a few times.

B.220:  Huh.

A.221:  It's a real sarcastic type show.  It's kind of funny.  Um, I thought, I
can't believe they're playing that in Japan.  These people over there must
think we are horrible.

B.222:  I know, that, #I didn't much care,#

A.223:  #I mean some of the# American shows were some of the worst ones we have.

B.224:  Uh-huh.

A.225:  And that's what they're showing in Tokyo.  And I'm thinking,

B.226:  Oh.

A.227:  they must think Americans are just really terrible [laughter] #if they
watch this.#

B.228:  #They probably do,# you know, if that's all they see of us.

A.229:  Yeah.

B.230:  Oh God, what a thought.

A.231:  Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing.

B.232:  So next time I think of that, next time I meet somebody from Japan, they're
going to think, oh, MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.  Yeah, that's what she's like.

A.233:  She's like Peggy Bundy, oh boy.

B.234:  Oh, golly.

A.235:  And he's like Al Bundy.

B.236:  Yeah, because I, I can't remember where I've seen clips,

A.237:  Uh-huh.

B.238:  of that, but they were showing highlights of it and stuff, and I was
thinking, who'd think this is really up my alley for half an hour, you know,

A.239:  Yeah.

B.240:  if I'm going to spend my time.  But it was, um, a lot of, um, borderline
jokes, you know.
