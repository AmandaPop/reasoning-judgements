=============================================================================

@A.1:  So, uh, how's the weather by you?

B.2:  If it had rained any more in the last two weeks, instead of planting Saint
Augustine grass in the front yard, I think I would have plowed everything
under and had a rice field.

A.3:  [Laughter] I, I heard that it's been raining down there a little bit, but
it's really been that bad?

B.4:  It's so bad, wanted to mow, today I was off and I wanted to mow the yard,
but just walking across it, it's still so mushy if I took a mower out there
I'd tear the sod up so bad.

A.5:  Really that bad, huh.  Is it, is it typically this rain-, I don't think
it's typically this rainy by you down there is it?

B.6:  It's steady, but it's not in the amounts that we been getting.  Normally we
get an inch here and then a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch,
inch and a half.  We're getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time.

A.7:  Oh, God. I guess, you're getting all of California's rain.

B.8:  Well, that's where the front had cam-, come from.  They said it came out of
the Pacific, run across California, who was really needing the rain.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  It should've, it should've stalled over them for a couple more days.

A.11:  Oh, they're getting another one, later in the week there.  There was
another one that was, another storm, um, that was supposed to hit them like on
Wednesday, or something.  So I suspect it'll, it'll wind it's way to you
afterward.  It's not a pleasant thought.  So.

B.12:  Well, maybe I, maybe I can get the yard mowed before it hits.

A.13:  [Laughter] Well, well, I can, uh, I can understand that weather.  We're
having, uh, we are, i-, we had a late, um, um, an ice storm here, about two
weeks ago, which is, you know, um, and, and it's, and it's, they're calling it
the worst ice storm in like the last hundred years.  And, um, and then to the
point where about three hundred thousand people in our, in our area lost
power and, 

B.14:  Isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though?

A.15:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  This is, this is, um, well, yeah, up here, in, in, in
Rochester, winter usually doesn't, you know spring comes about this time March
or April, and, um, this was sort of unexpected.  It had actually been pretty
fairly nice, you know, in the, in the forties and, um, it had even been in
the, uh, in the, in the low fifties a couple of days in a row.  And then they
actually, they predicted it.  They said well we're going to have an ice storm
coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be.  And it came in,
and in one night it basically destroyed, it destroyed approximately one third
of all the vegetation in, um, in like the three county area by us.  And about
half the city-owned trees in the city of Rochester are destroyed.  Um, we had,
uh, um, my wife and I own our own home, and we have a very big willow tree in
our backyard, that, um, that ninety percent of which came down in one night.
Things like that.  It was a, it, it definitely is very, um, it wa-, it was-,
it wasn't supposed to be as bad.  They, they have, I, I guess, apparently, you
know, ice storms here occasionally, but never anything this bad this late in
the season.

B.16:  Yeah, I'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit, um, up around
the Chicago area.  Uh, they had a little film clip about how bad it was up
there, and I just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with
it.

A.17:  Oh, yeah, it was, it was utterly amazing, I mean, we, we would, um, we got
up in the morning, you know, um, we, didn't, we, we didn't sleep very well
because ev-, all, all around you there were crashing sounds and, and there
were sounds of things breaking, and you know, you look, you know, we, at one
point we woke up to the sound of the, uh, the electric lines being ripped off
our house, and things like that.  And then, you go outside, and everything is
covered in ice.  I mean, um, you're talking about the lawn before being too
mushy to mow, um, in our case, it was just the opposite.  I mean, the lawn was
just a solid sheet of ice.  Each blade of grass had a small individual
covering of ice, you know, uh, maybe, you know, two or three millimeters
thick.  But thick enough that you could actually see it.  My car was covered
completely in ice. It was in ice of about a half inch thick, at one point.

B.18:  How do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that?

A.19:  Well it, 

B.20:  I've always lived down in this part of the country, and I'm not used, you
know, we had an ice storm, or a sleet and a good freeze and the windshield
ices over and you take hot water, or warm water out of the tap and thaw your
windshield.

A.21:  Yeah, um, actually, it turned out in our case, um, I know somebody who when
they tried to defrost their car, cracked their windshield.  Um, though,
occasionally it can be dethawed.  In our case we didn't, um, we didn't have
the problem, because my, we keep my wife's car in the garage.  So her car
didn't get iced over, you know, it wasn't, um, um, it was a little bit cold in
her car in the morning, but it wasn't iced over.  So I just left my car out
there for a couple of days and, um, within two or three days, it was, it was
actually warm enough that everything melted.  Um, it was, it was actually one
of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen.  Because, everything looks, you
know, if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet
of ice.  And, and, and it looks really nice, the whole, whole place.  But, um,
it got, you know, after the initial storm, it got worse as things started to
melt, because, um, as things melted, branches shifted and started to fall,
again.  So, we're still cleaning up.  We actually left, the last people got
power, I guess, yesterday, and we left the state of emergency last night or
something, at like midnight.  So, it's, it's, it's not fun.

B.22:  Hearing what it does to the lawn, I hate to even guess what the road
conditions would be like in something like that.

A.23:  Strangely enough, the roads weren't that, the, the roads themselves were
okay.  Um, there wasn't, given that, um, sort of things hit, and, and for some
reason, I don't, I don't quite understand why, they, maybe the ice didn't have
anything to grab onto, the roads themselves weren't, weren't like covered in a
solid sheet of ice.  Things seemed to be okay.  Um, especially given that, you
know, the next day it was forty degrees.  Um, you know, e-, everything started
to melt, and then the roads themselves ice-wise were okay.  It was just that,
um, there were, there were power lines down everywhere on the road, and there
were trees downed everywhere, and wherever you drove was sort of like driving
through an obstacle course.  You didn't want to have to wind up hitting, um,
you know, hitting a tree, or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or
anything else.  That was the rough part of it.  They closed school for kids
for like a week, ju-, just because of that.  So.

B.24:  Sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here.

A.25:  Yeah, that's what I'm actually told.  I've, I've never experienced a
hurricane.

B.26:  Well, we get the same things, trees being uprooted, limbs falling all over
the place, power lines getting torn completely off the, poles being completely
pulled out of the ground.

A.27:  Oh, God.  Yeah, well, I guess, um, but typically it, down there, though,
you don't get much coldness, eh.  You get,

B.28:  We get maybe all winter long, we might end up with twenty-five days of
really cold weather, and of those, by the time it gets lunch time, as, as long
as the wind's not blowing, it's bearable.

A.29:  How, well, when you say cold, what do you mean by cold?  [breathing]
[laughter].

B.30:  Uh, I think of any, thirty-five and below as cold.

A.31:  Oh, sheesh, yeah, um, um, it's right about now when they're talking about
hitting thirty-five and forty degree days, we're thinking heat wave.  Because,
occasion-, what'll, what'll happen here is, with the wind chill it can go
below zero quite often, which is not, not fun.  I personally hate it. I'm only
here for school.

B.32:  Another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze
coming straight off the Gulf, the wind chill factor blows everything out of
proportion.  Uh, most of the time during the winter that we've got an
offshore wind which is blowing straight out.

A.33:  So you don't get the wind chill there.  That's nice.  That's nice.  Uh, I,
my, my goal is to move some place south, so that I don't have to worry about
winters any more and just worry about, you know, an occasional thirty-five
degree day I can handle, but the, the, the sad part about here is that winter
starts in, um, in, you know, early Sept-, or September, October, and then it
ends in March or April.  So there isn't that much summer and spring and fall
here.  It's pretty much, you know, lots of winter and, uh, it's a very long
winter, semicold winter, and a very gray winter, usually.  So, not, uh, not
fun.

B.34:  Trying to think, where's the warmest, where the warm lines start.  I guess
probably if you're drawing a line across a map of the country, put the middle
of your ruler on Dallas.

A.35:  Is it that low?  ((You think, uh)),

B.36:  They get snow up there, but it's, it's not a long lasting snow.  It'll be
there, they may have a week of it, then it warms back up into the high
thirties and forties.

A.37:  That's not too ba-,

B.38:  You get much above, you get much above the Texas border on, in that sec-,
sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma, they've got a little bit longer
winter.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  They're catching all the cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies,
straight across Kansas and Nebraska, and there's nothing, the only thing that
stands between Oklahoma and Kansas and Nebraska, there's a barb wire fence
somewhere around Topeka.

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  That's the only thing to slow down the wind.

A.43:  A little barb wire fence, huh.  [laughter] Well, I've only been out, uh,
I've only been in the west once.  So, uh, I was, I was in Iowa, and it was
bitter cold when I was there.  And that's the way, that's north, um, that's
sort of north {pause} midwest though.  So, way, way north of where you are.
So, I, I, uh, my experience wasn't, wasn't quite, down there.  I, I, I, like I
said, I want to wind up somewhere down in that range where it's nice and warm
and, you know, when, when, when you get twenty-five cold days a year rather
than twenty-five warm days a year.

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  Which is what we wind up with ...
