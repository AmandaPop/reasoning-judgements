============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what's your favorite shows?   

B.2:  Oh, gosh that's hard to say [laughter].  It's, um, used to be a big TWIN
PEAKS fan but they've made me mad so I haven't watched them in a, in a while.

A.3:  Uh-huh.   

B.4:  Um, oh, I watch a lot of, uh, public, we watch public television a lot
MYSTERY and, oh,

A.5:  Huh.  That's one of my favorite.   

B.6:  Oh, I, oh, I really like mysteries.   

A.7:  Yeah, MYSTERY and, uh, MASTERPIECE THEATER.   

B.8:  Yeah, I watch that occasionally.   

A.9:  Yeah.   

B.10:  When there's something real interesting on.   

A.11:  Uh-huh.   

B.12:  But, uh, oh, I-, (( )) that I, it's hard to have the, I don't really watch
a whole lot [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah.  I don't, not anymore I don't.  There's just nothing on it.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  I got, I got sort of hooked on that, uh, DARK SHADOWS.   

B.16:  Have you?   

A.17:  Yeah.  I, when I watched it originally I didn't know it was a, I don't know
it was going to be a series.  I thought it was just a movie.

B.18:  Huh.   

A.19:  And, so, I started watching it and all of a sudden, stay tuned next week,
and I went, what.

B.20:  [Laughter].   

A.21:  And then it blows into this whole series thing so I sort of had to stay
with it.

B.22:  Yeah, is, is it good?  Is it,  

A.23:  Not really it, it, it's, it's gotten to the point it's getting ridiculous
now.

B.24:  Yeah.   

A.25:  And they, they just had the, uh, season finale and I don't, I don't know
what they accomplished,

B.26:  [Laughter].   

A.27:  but I think the writers just figure, well, let's just do anything and,

B.28:  Yeah.   

A.29:  we'll, we'll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas.

B.30:  Yeah, that, that's, that's kind of what happened on TWIN PEAKS they did all
this big building up, building up, building up and then the, the solution was
ridiculous I had,

A.31:  Yeah.   

B.32:  it figured out by the thir-,  

A.33:  Yeah.   

B.34:  I thought I already had it figured out and I did and that made me mad
[laughter].

A.35:  Yeah, I don't like programs that I can figure it out.   

B.36:  Yeah.   

A.37:  Um, the only one that I watch religiously is L A LAW.   

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  I really like that.   

B.40:  Well, my paren-, my parents really like L A LAW.   

A.41:  Yeah, that's, that's my favorite.   

B.42:  Is it good?  I've, I've always heard a s-, really good.   

A.43:  Well, I'm, I'm a struggling law student,  

B.44:  Oh [laughter].   

A.45:  and I, the reason I like it is because they give you good law in there.

B.46:  Do they?   

A.47:  Yeah, it's not like these other programs where they just make up anything
they want.

B.48:  Oh, yeah.   

A.49:  And they, they throw little tidbits out that are really good.

B.50:  You know, like they, they at least, you know, they've been in a courtroom
before [laughter].

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Of course, I mean, it's got its bad side so it's limited by the
format,

B.52:  Oh, of course.   

A.53:  obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out
that you do,

B.54:  Yeah.   

A.55:  I mean, they're, they're,  

B.56:  Oh, no.   

A.57:  in California and they're, they're waiting list is about four years, four
or five years,

B.58:  Oh, Lord.   

A.59:  for a civil case.   

B.60:  Yeah.   

A.61:  So, uh, I mean, you know, it's very difficult to,  

B.62:  It would be nice if ((justice traveled)) that quickly.   

A.63:  Yeah, it would.  Yeah. 

B.64:  But it shou-, it, it sure doesn't.   

A.65:  No, not at all.   

B.66:  [Laughter].   

A.67:  You know, the wheels of justice grind slowly.   

B.68:  Yeah, well, it's not really justice's fault but that's on a another whole
subject altogether [laughter].

A.69:  Yeah.   

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  I'll agree with you there.  I'll agree with you.   

B.72:  Oh.   

A.73:  I know, I know the shortcomings too.   

B.74:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, let's see what, oh, I guess I've got a two year old
so we do SESAME STREET everyday [laughter].

A.75:  Oh, well, not in that, that's not on my,  

B.76:  Not here,  

A.77:  that's not on my list of (( )).

B.78:  ((not now)).

A.79:  ((Now there was some of the)) some of the classes I'm in I think I'm in
SESAME STREET, but, uh,

B.80:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.81:  Some of the professors I think imitate Big Bird.   

B.82:  Yeah, oh, yeah [laughter].  Have an intellectual role of Big Bird, that's
pretty good.

A.83:  That's it, I mean, Big Bird would make a good judge.   

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  Better than some of the judges I've seen.   

B.86:  Oh, that's true.  That's true.   

A.87:  Yeah, I've got my own pet peeve about judges but, uh, oh, well, we're stuck
with them.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah, that we're kind of stuck with them.   

A.89:  Sort of like lawyers, you know [laughter].   

B.90:  [Laughter] Oh.   

A.91:  Um, let's see, what else is, oh, I like A and E.   

B.92:  I wi-, I wish we got, I wish we got that on our cable system, we don't.
There's always good stuff on A and E.

A.93:  They don't have A and E on cable in Dallas?   

B.94:  Well, not where I am. 

A.95:  [Throat_clearing] Oh. 

B.96:  Not, we're, we're in far nor-, we're, I mean, we're, I'm thirty-five miles
north of Dallas in McKinney.

A.97:  Oh.   

B.98:  It's a small town.  There's only one cable system here.

A.99:  Oh.   

B.100:  And I've ca-, griped about them not having A E, A and E but they don't have
it.

A.101:  Yeah, I'll tell you. 

B.102:  I mean in Dallas they do.   

A.103:  [Throat_clearing] The, um, uh, A and E and DISCOVERY and C N N, I couldn't,
I couldn't live without those.

B.104:  Oh, I wat-, oh, I like C, I like C N N's new-, uh, news coverage better
than anybody's.

A.105:  Oh, yeah, I, I just leave it, when I'm home during the day I just leave it
on just to listen to it.

B.106:  Yeah, du-, wh-, during when the war was real hot and heavy we just h-, had
it on C N N all day long.

A.107:  Yeah, the best coverage.   

B.108:  Yeah, oh, the, oh, much better than anybody else's.   

A.109:  Yeah.  Uh, the networks got sort of ridiculous,  

B.110:  [Breathing].    

A.111:  with they, they, they felt like they had to interrupt normal
programming for all this but they didn't have anything to say.  

B.112:  No, they're, plus they had a-, all the inaccuracies were wor-, d-,

A.113:  Oh, yeah.   

B.114:  then they'd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to,

A.115:  Yeah.   

B.116:  oh, ((it was)), just get, it was ridiculous,  

A.117:  Yeah.   

B.118:  so I just, 

A.119:  Well, the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway, I mean.

B.120:  Uh-huh.   

A.121:  It, it, it got far more coverage than it should have.  I, it was, it was
beautifully played out thing, I mean,

B.122:  Yeah, oh, yeah.     

A.123:  it, it roused the patriotism of the, of the country and all that sort of
stuff and,

B.124:  But, uh, [breathing] they, they interrupted for no good reason a lot.

A.125:  Yeah, exactly, I mean, and sometimes they, they would, now I like JEOPARDY
and JEOPARDY comes on,

B.126:  Uh-huh.   

A.127:  here at seven o'clock.   

B.128:  Uh-huh.   

A.129:  And for I don't know, it much have been two or three weeks there, they were
doing this expanded nightly news.

B.130:  Oh, wow.   

A.131:  You know, and I'm going I will never get to see JEOPARDY again.

B.132:  ((I think it was just rehash)),  

A.133:  Yeah.

B.134:  oh, ((t-,)) oh. 

A.135:  I'm saying, what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first
half-hour.

B.136:  Nothing [laughter].   

A.137:  Nothing. 

B.138:  And I, I know, I know the scud at-, scud attacks are s-, are exciting to
somebody but after you've seen them,

A.139:  Yeah.   

B.140:  seen them for two weeks in a row,  

A.141:  Oh, well, there goes a patriot missile, oh, well, that's good,

B.142:  [Laughter].  

A.143:  that's good.   

B.144:  Across the black sky a white streak oh, wee.   

A.145:  Yeah, oh, boy.  Golly, gee.

B.146:  Well, mayb-, maybe where b-, uh, um, oh, ((jaded)),  

A.147:  Yeah, we are.   

B.148:  and, and su-, because television's brought everything into your living
room.

A.149:  Yeah, well, i-, it was intere-, it was int-,

B.150:  But it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't [laughter]. 

A.151:  No, I mean, there, there was nothing to it.  I mean,  

B.152:  Which is, that's good, that's good.   

A.153:  I mean, yeah, I'm happy,  

B.154:  But, but, the T V coverage, it's pitiful.   

A.155:  for that, I'm happy for that but, but unfortunately I sort of had the
inside track because I'd been in the, I'd been in the military for thirteen
years,

B.156:  Oh.   

A.157:  and I w-, and I worked in intelligence.   

B.158:  Oh [laughter].   

A.159:  And, and there was no,

B.160:  Contradiction in ((turn)) [laughter].  

A.161:  Yes, another one of those [laughter].  Military intelligence, ha-ha.
That's what, that's just like justice for all [laughter].

B.162:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.163:  But I mean, my goodness there's, they're sitting here making all this big
deal out of the Iranians,

B.164:  I know.   

A.165:  and I'm sitting there thinking to myself, uh-huh, sure.    

B.166:  Uh-huh.   

A.167:  I mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but the stupid
people can't read comic strips, I mean,

B.168:  No, they can't.   

A.169:  how do you expect them to operate tanks.   

B.170:  It's, put it in Russian.   

A.171:  Yeah I mean,  

B.172:  [Laughter].   

A.173:  They can't even read their own language.   

B.174:  Yeah, i-, it, it was just, it was, the coverage just went way too far.

A.175:  Yeah, a, it just, totally ridiculous I mean, the Israeli's could have fixed
the whole problem years ago if they just sent, sent their guys in there and
killed Saddam.

B.176:  Oh, that's, that's what my husband says, he says, just send the Israeli's
in, t-, to pick off,

A.177:  That's right, I mean, the Israeli's gon-,  

B.178:  Saddam they'll, they'd love it (( )). 

A.179:  They're not afraid of anything.   

B.180:  Huh-uh.  No.   

A.181:  See what happens when they, when they take a plane load of their citizens
down in (( )).

B.182:  Oh, yeah.   

A.183:  That doesn't, uh, that doesn't, that situation doesn't sit around and
develop very long.

B.184:  No, I just wonder what's going to happen to the hos-, to the, the hostages
that's over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things.

A.185:  All right, I, I, I think everybody's jumping to conclusions.  I don't think
anything's going to change.

B.186:  You don't think so, 

A.187:  No. 

B.188:  I just,  

A.189:  First off I don't think that the Middle Eastern situation's going to
change,

B.190:  ((Oh)), that's true.

A.191:  I don't think that,

B.192:  Oh, are you kidding.  

A.193:  They're not.  Yeah, they're not going to come up wi-,  

B.194:  But they all hate each other.  

A.195:  they're not going to come up with a peace plan,  

B.196:  Huh-uh.  

A.197:  or any of this kind of crap.   

B.198:  You know, you, you see them on interview, they interview everybody,

A.199:  Uh-huh.   

B.200:  and everybody says the same things.   

A.201:  Yeah.  Well, they, they, they get, 

B.202:  That they always have.   

A.203:  ((Oshmid Aukomo)), you know, the janitor for the U. S.  Embassy, and you
know,

B.204:  Oh, yes, I know.  Yes, I can't say, when are they going to knock on my door
and interview me, they've talked to everybody else in the world [laughter].

A.205:  Yeah, really.  And it was, it was r-, it was even worse here in North
Carolina.

B.206:  Was it?   

A.207:  Because, because a lot of the, matter of fact all the units, the marines
and, and, uh, the F, the F-sixteen squadrons came out of North Carolina.

B.208:  Did they?   

A.209:  So, every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they
were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives, you know.

B.210:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. 

A.211:  And, and I, and I understand the way they feel about their husbands and
wives being over there,

B.212:  Oh, yeah.   

A.213:  and all that.  But to get on camera and just [noise] {imitates a woman
crying} oh, this is so terrible, I just, I don't what we're going to do.

B.214:  [Laughter].   

A.215:  I'm thinking to myself, you know, what do they people think they were
getting into,

B.216:  They're, they're voluntary army.   

A.217:  when they joined the military?  You know, I'm going, it, what did you
think it was?

B.218:  Uh-huh.   

A.219:  A paycheck?   

B.220:  Uh-huh.   

A.221:  You know, run around and then play soldier. 

B.222:  Yeah, they do, they think it's a paycheck.   

A.223:  Well, the reservists sure do.   

B.224:  Yeah.   

A.225:  We had a reservist here in North Carolina who, who, who's unit was ordered
up and he refused to go.

B.226:  We had a doctor that did that here.   

A.227:  I hope he got busted.   

B.228:  Oh, yeah.   

A.229:  Yeah, the ot-, this,  

B.230:  She did.    

A.231:  this guy did too.  He ended up going to Leavenworth, which is good I'm
glad.

B.232:  Yeah, ((I mean, just)), wh-, an-, th-, they, military paid for her
education.

A.233:  Huh-uh, and then sh-, 

B.234:  And they kept having her on the news,  

A.235:  That's right.   

B.236:  every night.   

A.237:  And then she didn't want to do her obligation.  Yeah. 

B.238:  Uh-huh.  Oh, she's, she's in hot water [laughter].   

A.239:  Well, I, uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not racist or anything but one of my,
one, another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of black,

B.240:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.   

A.241:  on the news.  Talking about how unfair it is because the blacks are poor
and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military, so there's more
of them getting killed than the whites.

B.242:  Oh, yes.   

A.243:  Now to me that doesn't make any damn sense.   

B.244:  It, nobody forced ...
