B.1:   Hi Chris, this is Carol. 

A.2:   Hi. 

B.3:   This is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for  people to
young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps, um, or something like that doing public service. I

A.4:   or doing or doing public service.

B.5:   [breathing] suppose the idea is to um [lipsmack] I don't know [laughter] [breathing] 

A.6:   Well, 

B.7:   but but th- w- the point 

A.8:   in 

B.9:   be to that 

A.10:   order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and 

B.11:   It 

A.12:   doing 

B.13:   sure 

A.14:   public 

B.15:   does 

A.16:   service how are they supposed to support themselves. 

B.17:   Yeah I I I suppose the i- the idea would be to get um people interested in public service and to um I don't know maybe people give give p- give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have 

A.18:   well 

B.19:   Um 

A.20:   yeah I think that's a good idea although I don't I think if it's something that is forced on you Um I think that the attitude is not going to be [laughter] quite the same. [breathing] 

B.21:   Well I tend to agree and [breathing] Um Uh, In that we do live in the United States and I think one of our uh one of the [breathing] things that our country is based on is freedom of choice um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing [breathing] something that may not be or the timing that they want to do it or uh [lipsmack] perhaps even you know maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of of forcing someone to do something I am I am pretty much against 

A.22:   from 

B.23:   that 

A.24:   what I've 

B.25:   [breathing] 

A.26:   read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives [breathing] but 

B.27:   Just 

A.28:   I- g- 

B.29:   on their own 

A.30:   right but 

B.31:   Uh-huh 

A.32:   I agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they are ready to do it [breathing] Um I don't think that you can just snatch somebody away from you know you don't know what 

B.33:   [child] 

A.34:   their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just 

B.35:   That's right. 

A.36:   snatch em away and make them go do something they don't want to do 

B.37:   [child] 

A.38:   or like the draft. [laughter] 

B.39:   I think there would be an awful lot of resentment and uh I I really don't think it would be feasible in our country 

A.40:   then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay 'em or are you going to provide them with you know place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you, know. 

B.41:   That's right. Yeah, some young people do some young people 

A.42:   Yeah. 

B.43:   start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents. 

A.44:   That's true. 

B.45:   Brothers and sisters things. 

A.46:   That's 

B.47:   like 

A.48:   true. 

B.49:   that I suppose they may have exceptions but um [child] I guess it all it would all boil down to I mainly I I guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's what's trying to be accomplished by [breathing] by that proposal. 

A.50:   I'm not sure I'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or 

B.51:   Uh-huh 

A.52:   it's like you said that's something more [breathing] Yeah To t- make people aware. 

B.53:   [lipsmack] More esoteric 

A.54:   Yeah 

B.55:   [laughter] 

A.56:   What's going on and what needs to be done but [breathing] I really do I think that the pop- that the people are pretty well where I think more so now than ever before 

B.57:   You know I think that's true and I tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness 

A.58:   Yeah 

B.59:   of that at least I mean I I feel I try to as an individual my children are very young but um I- I think they're being taught a lot [child] maybe to be more responsible 

A.60:   Uh-huh 

B.61:   and um [lipsmack] Hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in [lipsmack] as fortunate 

A.62:   Yeah 

B.63:   as as perhaps 

A.64:   Yeah 

B.65:   they are [child] 

A.66:   Yeah and I think that that's the trend now 

B.67:   Pardon me 

A.68:   I think that's the trend now and I think people are a lot more willing to give of their time 'n help out 

B.69:   You know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis 

A.70:   Yeah, 

B.71:   then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced 

A.72:   and 

B.73:   um 

A.74:   get an- get more out of it. 

B.75:   That's right. 

A.76:   So I think 

B.77:   [laughter] 

A.78:   we or [laughter] sounds like we pretty 

B.79:   [lipsmack] 

A.80:   much 

B.81:   [breathing] 

A.82:   agree. 

B.83:   Yeah 

A.84:   [laughter] 

B.85:   it's an interesting idea, but I think we do agree and [laughter] [laughter] at least I'm I'm I don't think I would vote for it if it came down to that. 

A.86:   No, I don't think I would either. 

B.87:   [lipsmack] able just do our best to to do our own 

A.88:   Do 

B.89:   fair 

A.90:   what you 

B.91:   share 

A.92:   can when 

B.93:   and 

A.94:   you 

B.95:   [laughter] 

A.96:   can right 

B.97:   [laughter] 

A.98:   then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you're doing [breathing] to help I 

B.99:   [child] 

A.100:   think that's more important than [breathing] 

B.101:   That's right 

A.102:   than to [exhaling] 

B.103:   [lipsmack] 

A.104:   pre- 

B.105:   Well 

A.106:   you know 

B.107:   it's been nice talking to 

A.108:   Nice 

B.109:   you about 

A.110:   talking 

B.111:   it I have to admit it's something I hadn't thought 

A.112:   Yeah, 

B.113:   of before 

A.114:   really 

B.115:   it it is interesting to think 

A.116:   [laughter] 

B.117:   about it. 

A.118:   It does kind of catch you by surprise, 

B.119:   yes. [laughter]
