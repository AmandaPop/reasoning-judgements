=============================================================================

B.1:  [Noise] So, what do you think of, uh, public schools today?  [breathing].

A.2:  Well, the problem we're having down here in public schools, is, is
financing, for one thing.

B.3:  Uh,

A.4:  Uh, and, and, the, uh, the tax districts.  They're in the process of, of
rearranging the tax, tax districts.

B.5:  so they can't decide.

A.6:  And, uh, some of the more rich schools, are those, are those schools that
are financially well off, are going to have to support those are aren't.
Especially in the minority n-, neighborhoods.

B.7:  [Sniffing] Uh.  

A.8:  And uh, there's a lot of problems with that.  

B.9:  Well. 

A.10:  A lot of debate going on with that.  

B.11:  And, and, and the ((restructuring)) is sort of --

A.12:  Yeah.  Restructuring.

B.13:  -- sort of screwing around with whoever is getting what money --

A.14:  Right.  

B.15:  -- to what school?  

A.16:  Right.

B.17:  Yeah.  [lipsmack] We actually don't have, we have, we're having some
problems of own up here with teachers.

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:  But, uh, we are, we are apparently, I'm, I'm fairly new to Rochester, I've
only been here a cou-, a few years. And we are supposedly Rochester public
schools are, are one of the model, the city schools are some of the models for
the rest of the country.

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  They have very specific programs that, uh, that are being implemented at
the moment, that everybody is watching, you know, to make sure that they're
all, they're all working and, uh, for instance, they have a mentor teacher
program where, uh, there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go
around, and, and help other teachers learn how to teach.

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  And things like that.  But they're having a lot of problems here because,
uh, because they also pay the teachers, I think, much better than others
places in the country.

A.24:  Yeah.  That's a problem down here, it, uh --

B.25:  pay, do they pay them well?

A.26:  -- uh, not, no, not too well.  

B.27:  Oh yeah, they, there, they pay them a little better here I think than 
most --

A.28:  Yeah.  

B.29:  -- than, than, than, than the national average. Especially these mentor
teachers.

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  But they're having a large problem negotiating contracts.  they have been
in con-, they have been without a contract, I believe for, over six months, or
something like six months --

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- and they are now putting in, you know, some sort of federal arbitrator I
think or something, because they just, have a horrible time getting the, you
know, getting their contracts straightened out, and they have been good, and
they only walked out once or twice, I believe, and they --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- keep getting, you know, they, they'll go all the way to your table,
they'll have some proposal and then, someone won't like it for some reason, or
some of them will, say, vote it down and it just goes but, 

A.36:  Yeah.  I think, uh, someone that really wanted it, or I really don't
unders-, or I guess I do understand, people that, I guess, that want to teach,
teach, it's, it must be inborn in them or something, because they're certainly
not going into it for the, for the money, nor the prestige, or whatever.

B.37:  Yeah.  So, that, that's, 

A.38:  (( )).

B.39:  that, that's always, I'm, I'm actually, I'm a P H D student, at the
moment --

A.40:  Yeah.  

B.41:  -- and, uh, it's always occurred to me that, that, uh, you know, I've been
told looking at it s-, all so, I have some bias in this.

A.42:  Yeah.  

B.43:  But it, but it's always seemed to me that, that those people who should be
paid the most I think, or paid, the most I think you know, significantly more,
are, are teacher types because they sort of hold for of the future in our
hands than almost anyone else.  Yet, yet I don't think that, uh, it, it, it's
being done.  And also in general I think that our educational system is okay.
But I think we're, lacking in some very significant areas --

A.44:  Yeah.  

B.45:  -- that, that need to be worked on, uh,

A.46:  I think one thing, too that's hurting the teachers, as far as recruiting
teachers is that, the, uh, they've lost a lot of their, their authority --

B.47:  yeah, 

A.48:  -- in the classroom.

B.49:  how, wha-, what do you mean by that?  

A.50:  Well, I mean, uh, they, no more punishment, per se --

B.51:  Oh, yeah.  

A.52:  -- I, I'm speaking mostly of elementary.

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  Uh, you know, it's, if some, if a teacher does anything that, uh, they're
liable to have a law suit against them for, for, uh, cruel and unjust
punishment or whatever.

B.55:  That's true,  

A.56:  It's, uh,

B.57:  that's true.  And, well, I think that, 

A.58:  And, of course, you've got the drugs, and the, uh, other problems that you,
were much more prevalent than when I was going to school.

B.59:  yeah, I think actually, in, any, there are some places where some
teachers are just afraid to teach.  You know, are they going to, or they go to
work, where they're just baby sitters, I think, rather than teachers, you
know, they're job is to make sure that no kids get killed in their classroom
for that day and,

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  the, uh (( )) so it's hard to imagine a, a, I mean, I, I, I can't imagine
teaching in a situation like that, and actually trying to get anything across
to a student.

A.62:  Yeah. 

B.63:  Yeah I'd be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the
day and just being happy.  So, I, I sit back, that the, that's one of the main
things that sort of happens to be shured up, you know, in or educational
system maybe.  [laughter] (( )) do that, means you have to have a metal
detector, and, and, uh, outside the school or something.

A.64:  Yeah.  

B.65:  I'm not sure.  

A.66:  And, uh, also, you know, this is purely my, my thoughts, because I am, I'm
a Christian, and I think when they took prayer out of school, that, uh, uh, I
think it hurt.

B.67:  Well, possibly.  I think it does, uh, I'm not sure I think it does some,
uh, it, it, it, it may sort of lead to some, uh, it, it, it may just be
another form of sort of regimenting, you know, in kids, which I, which I think
is good actually, to have some kids sort of sit together and, you know, just
say things, and sort of do things together, so possibly --

A.68:  Yeah.  

B.69:  -- possibly I think that, uh, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm actually Jewish, so I
suspect that I would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of 
prayer --

A.70:  Yeah.

B.71:  -- in school.  But I think some things might be a, a wise idea, just to
give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view,

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  I think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today.  I wo-, wou-,
I would agree with you [laughter].  And, I think somewhat.  Although I do
understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so,

A.74:  Yeah, yeah, I do too,

B.75:  so,  

A.76:  but, uh,

B.77:  (( )) and, I also, I mean, I think that our, I think that our schools look
a lot worse nowadays,

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  relative to schools, sort of, in other countries, like compared to the
Japanese school system.  I was in a panel that would, that addressed the issue
of, you know, science, and how our kids they're just very, very far behind of
science because a lot of them just aren't going into it, because they just
don't know anything about it, and how it's got to be upgraded now is all.

A.80:  Well, I, I believe in freedom of, but not freedom from.  If you understand
what I mean.

B.81:  I think so.  You, I, I read a little bit on that, that, 

A.82:  Right.  

B.83:  that sounds interesting.  

A.84:  But, uh, we've, like I say, we've been redistricting here in Dallas, has
been a, a major issue, for, I guess the last year.

B.85:  Oh. Well, hopefully they'll resolve it soon.  

A.86:  Yeah, they, uh, they, the voters voted one way and it, and then, uh, some
federal judge said no that was unconstitutional, and they have had two or
three votes and, and the city council is divided over what it is district
should be because, they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing
repinta-, repins-, -sentation, and, uh, it, it's just a big battle.

B.87:  Well, I hope it all works out -- 

A.88:  But, uh,  

B.89:  -- yeah.  I, I, I have, I mean, you say that your, your kids are grown up
and out of school now and --

A.90:  Yeah.  

B.91:  -- I've yet to have any so [laughter],

A.92:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.93:  So, [laughter] I'm not quite (( )) the issues yet -- 

A.94:  Yeah.  

B.95:  -- but I'm sure I will, it will hit me a little harder in a couple of
years.

A.96:  Yeah, and also the cost of it, you know, not, not, not great, not, uh,
public school, but, I can't imagine having to raise a kid now, and, and have
to look to college -- 

B.97:  Oh, I can't even,

A.98:  -- (( )),

B.99:  I can't imagine it [laughter].  

A.100:  you know, fifteen years or so later, they go, it's going up. 

B.101:  My only hope is that, uh, is that whatever, I'm going to wined of being
college faculty somewhere I think --

A.102:  Yeah.  

B.103:  -- and my, and my only hope is that, uh, whatever kids we have want to go
to school wherever I teach [breathing] --

A.104:  Yeah.  

B.105:  -- because that typically is very, otherwise, I can't imagine it.

A.106:  Yeah, 

B.107:  It would,

A.108:  I, I just don't see how a person could, could put enough, away enough
money --

B.109:  No.  I,  

A.110:  -- out of their paychecks, to pay for our kids schooling within fifteen
years.

B.111:  I, I don't, I, it, completely beyond me.  I went to my under graduate,
uh, education --

A.112:  Yeah.  

B.113:  -- uh, on a lot of financial aid and, where I am now, I'm, I'm only in
graduate school because they waive tuition and --

A.114:  Yeah.

B.115:  -- they pay for school a little bit otherwise I would never,

A.116:  Yeah,

B.117:  be comfortable again.

A.118:  kids in private school have to do what I did either, of course, the
service I'm at, I don't think gives a education, uh, after service.

B.119:  Well, they give some, some financial aid for education, they, they,

A.120:  Yeah.

B.121:  advertise that they give it, you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand
dollars for,

A.122:  But, uh, that's how I got my education, such as it was, was going into it
is service, and then coming back, coming out in three years, and getting, uh,
two years paid for.

B.123:  That's, that's actually a great way, I think.  I know, I have lots of
friends who are doing things like that.

A.124:  Yeah.  

B.125:  I think, it's a great way, I couldn't.  I'm actually deaf in one ear --

A.126:  Yeah.  

B.127:  -- so they wouldn't take me.  

A.128:  Yeah.

B.129:  Uh, but that is a real, a real, I mean, that's a real good way to do it, I
think,

A.130:  Yeah.

B.131:  I think that, you know, these people are sort of getting the money and
doing something for it so, I think it's real good.  Anyway, it's, it's, it was
nice meeting you.

A.132:  Okay.  And I'm, I'm glad to have met you.  Oh, are, are, work with, Texas
Instruments?

B.133:  No I'm not.  I'm just like you, a person on the, uh, phone thing.

A.134:  Oh.  Okay. I was wondering, I guess this is not just Texas Instruments
wide, because I worked for Tex-, Texas Instruments,

B.135:  Oh no.
