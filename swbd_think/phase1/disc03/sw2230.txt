=============================================================================

B.1:  Why do you think so few people vote then?

A.2:  Why do I think so few people vote?  I, I think a lot of it is, uh, apathy.
Uh, and, for example, uh, when things are going good I think the voter
turn out is less, just because people figure why bother, you know, what's the
difference.  Especially when two candidates seem roughly equal.  Uh, and in
others cases, you know, they, they see themselves as one voter in a million,
and they think, what difference is it going to make whether I vote or not,
they, they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact.

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  And I think a lot of cases, like a lot of our, minority issues, the, we had
the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back.
And it lost, well, that was decided by a very small margin.  Uh, and there
were a lot of, of minorities that wanted it to go the way that it didn't go
[noise] but, they also had very low voter turn outs, especially like in the
Hispanic community.  And I think in that case, they just, they developed a
distrust of the system, and so they've chosen not to participate in it.

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  And I think that's part of it.  What part --

B.7:  What do you think?

A.8:  -- what part would you say the big brother aspect plays, the people that
don't want to be called for jury duty or --

B.9:  [Laughter] Oh.

A.10:  -- or things that they've heard that says you know, well, they use this
registration for this purpose or that.  So they just don't bother.

B.11:  I, I've heard people say that.  I know i-, it's a real thing, and I think
it makes a difference as to how many people vote.  Apparently, not being a
citizen, not, not serving on jury duty is important enough to them, that they
don't want to have any say, in, uh, politics.

A.12:  Huh.  And then what about the smaller election, say, some of the city
elections, uh, even down to the, uh, school board type, uh, elections,

B.13:  [Laughter].  

A.14:  I guess there are so many, that, uh,   

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  you can, uh, weed out the ones that you really want to,  

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  partake in.  

B.19:  Well, last November was my first election in Dallas.  I've only lived in
Dallas a little over a year, and I went down this long list of judges that I
was voting for.  And, I mean, I didn't know anything about any of these races.
I didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were.  I didn't know
anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet, and I'm going,
you know, how can I possibly make an informed choice here.

A.20:  Uh-huh.  

B.21:  So what's the point in voting for these people?  I, I mean i-, you know,
get just as good of results as if I through darts at a board.

A.22:  [Laughter] Right.  Well, it's a shame that, uh, that even the politician
who wants to give, give out good information about himself, uh, has trouble in
virtually everything he does say that's positive or, or even mediocre gets
attacked from the other side, such that he spends more of his time defending
than he can putting forth any decent information, uh, and then once you get
off the candidate's personal information, then you want to get into an actual
issue, and then how the candidate feels about that,

B.23:  Uh-huh.  

A.24:  there's, there's very little room for, or very little time, to handle all
the different things you'd like to know about a candidate, and then
unfortunately after you do get some of that information, you may find out it
wasn't true to begin with.

B.25:  Yeah.  You,

A.26:  [Laughter] so,

B.27:  you think then that, uh, part of it is because the, uh, it flashes too
much on the personal, uh, characteristics of the candidate rather than his,
uh, job performance issues?

A.28:  I would say that it's much easier to deal with the, the public, the, uh,
media that's, that's giving the information to the public, it's much easier to
deal with, uh, any personality quirk, or any negatives that they've found, or
any sk-, skeleton in the closet --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can
listen to either side of a given issue --

B.31:  Yeah.  

A.32:  -- uh, and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues, lets say
that, uh, Texas State, uh, Rail Road Commission has to solve, when you don't
even fathom what the implications are of they're decision, so,

B.33:  Yeah.  I'd, 

A.34:  who would you care who got in that position, you know. 

B.35:  I'd say there's a large number, especially of urban young voters that
don't know what the Rail Road Commission does.

A.36:  Right.  

B.37:  And so, they go, you know, w-, who, who, what does it matter who I vote
for.

A.38:  Right.  

B.39:  I think, well, that's one thing I've noticed, I've, I've lived a couple
ever different places.  I've noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices
than any place I've ever been.

A.40:  So, [smack] there's more apathy [laughter] I guess, 

B.41:  Well,

A.42:  or confusion.  

B.43:  a lot more confusion, you know, I, i-, in other towns I've never called
upon to decide all this long list of judges.  I've never been called upon to
decide, you know, i-, i-, we're, we're voting for a rail road commissioner,
and, and, uh, land commissioner, and that sort of thing.  And other state fees
would be appointments of the governor --

A.44:  Uh-huh.  

B.45:  -- [Noise] we wouldn't be expected [noise] to cast a ballet on the subject.

A.46:  Huh.  Boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important,
doesn't it?

B.47:  Well, it does.  

A.48:  Yeah.  A lot more ((appointee's)) I guess --  

B.49:  Uh-huh.  

A.50:  -- makes him carry a lot more weight.  

B.51:  But it also means you've got a unified state government, and you don't have
different departments pulling against each other.

A.52:  That's probably well worth it then, [noise] it would probably be worth it
just to do away with the cost of the elections,

B.53:  [Laughter].  

A.54:  and, uh, put it in the hands of maybe, 

B.55:  Yeah.  

A.56:  one man who can, at least, get his party together.  

B.57:  Yeah.  

A.58:  So, huh.

B.59:  The, the big problem I guess with the, the mass media, is, you know, you
don't have time to educate the public on these matters, because the public is
not going to sit still and si-, soak the message in.

A.60:  Uh-huh.  

B.61:  I mean, anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less, they're
not going to care about.

A.62:  Right.  

B.63:  Or, or if you can't dramatize it, and put it on UNSOLVED MYSTERIES, then
they're not going to, you know, they're not going to want to hear it.

A.64:  Do you find it convenient to vote, the actual time of day type, where you
have to go in the line you have to stand in?

B.65:  Uh, the, the line, what I waited maybe ten minutes in line.  It, it was,
uh, a minor inconvenience.  It was certainly worth it,

A.66:  Did you go -- 

B.67:  to me I think.

A.68:  -- early in the morning or, 

B.69:  I w-, went right after work,

A.70:  After work.    

B.71:  so that was when the line is the longest.  

A.72:  Huh.  That's interesting.  Well, where, in my little district, fortunately
it is literally across the street.  I could walk over there as it were, we
live,

B.73:  Uh-huh.  

A.74:  across from the school, and so we, I drive out of my complex early in the
morning, and go over there usually before the poles even open, and, and vote
right at the, you know, number one, or two, sometimes the third or fourth
person in, in line --

B.75:  Uh-huh.  

A.76:  -- and I wait longer to, to watch them set up, than I do actually in the,
in the line itself,

B.77:  [Laughter].

A.78:  but that gets me out of there at a time that I can go down Central and
not be bothered by the, the traffic, as it were --

B.79:  Yeah.  

A.80:  -- because normally I'm, I'm at work before seven, so, uh, just stay a
little later tha-, as it were, and, and make the, the effort to vote.  Uh,

B.81:  Uh-huh.  

A.82:  but unfortunately, since there are so many other things that, uh, our
city wants to vote on, they don't, they, they tend to make the elections, if
it's a not important election, as it were, they only opened a few of the
poles, so,

B.83:  So you have to go a little out of your way, huh?

A.84:  I don't always, I don't always vote at the same place --  

B.85:  Yeah.  

A.86:  -- so it's a little bit more trouble for me to, well, this election is
going to be held this date, and I've got to go over here --

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  -- and I've got to remember, uh, you know, on this election, I'm in this
district, in this election I'm for here and, uh, you know, this precinct votes
here,

B.89:  Uh-huh. 

A.90:  and, I would just assume ((in holding still)) --     

B.91:  Yeah.   

A.92:  -- and all vote in the same place as many times as they want. 

B.93:  Yeah.  I would also like better information on, on what, on, you know, what
am I voting on, and who, some just general statements about the candidates.  I
guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers.

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  And I didn't see much of it.  Like, you know, like, you saw a lot about the
major races, but a lot of the minor ones that your being called upon to
decide, there's very little information on.

A.96:  Uh-huh.  

B.97:  As far as, you know, what, what is the duties of this political office,
and, uh, and what are the characteristics, or wha-, what are the issued
statements, and, uh, spoken goals, of the, uh, candidates.

A.98:  Right.

B.99:  I'd like to get,

A.100:  Probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this
particular office affected you, or could have affected you over the last
several years, you know, these are the kinds of decisions that this particular
judge, or this particular, uh, rail road commission, for instance,

B.101:  Yeah.  

A.102:  does.  If, if, you know, if he, he does do something [laughter] or you
pay attention to this, or this is the guy that, to blame for this if, uh --

B.103:  Uh-huh.  

A.104:  -- you didn't like what happened.  Your right.  There is no, uh, no such
deal, other than the small publication that the, uh, league of woman voters
puts out, it supplements that newspaper, that I get, a local newspaper, that
they, they published, but, uh, nothing per se in the major newspaper, and as
hungry as they are for things to print, you'd think they would want to do
that.

B.105:  Yeah.  Well, they, the Dallas Morning News did publish a, a section that
covered the major races, and it explained a lot to me about the individual
candidates, and helped me make a lot of better informed decisions.  But still,
uh, you know, if it left a lot of the, the, the local races, the races unique
to my precinct, uh, up in the air.  There is one thing that, that did annoy
me, and that is the, that my congressman last fall, didn't have anybody
running against him.  So basically, I had no choice --

A.106:  Uh-huh.  

B.107:  -- and I think, uh, in some districts, you know, there's, a, a party, one
party or another that ((sets)) a lock on it, that, uh, you know, why vote when
it's decided already.

A.108:  Right.  

B.109:  That sort of attitude.  

A.110:  That's true.  [smack] With so many elected officials, I guess there's just
so many people to go around [laughter] in some of those cases.

B.111:  Yeah.  

A.112:  Huh.  [smack] Well, I hear someone calling me, so I better let you go.

B.113:  [Breathing] We used the five up.  

A.114:  Yeah, at least [laughter].  

B.115:  [Laughter] Okay. 

A.116:  Bye.  

B.117:  All right.  Bye [noise].
