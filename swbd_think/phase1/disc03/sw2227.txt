A.35:  Uh, I don't know, but people, the other day I went into a bar and this guy
asked me to dance.

B.36:  [Laughter].   

A.37:  All he saw was my hair and he goes, do you want to dance.  I turn around

B.44:  No, it, with the, uh, who was on, the music people, wasn't that Fishbone.

A.45:  Yeah.   

B.46:  Yeah I saw that, it was awesome.  But I didn't see the rest of it.

A.47:  No, oh, you missed WAYNE'S WORLD.

B.48:  Are you serious? 

A.49:  WAYNE'S WORLD was pretty cool.   

B.50:  They're awesome.   

A.51:  So, uh, let's see, what else.  Uh, see, like, all we do here is, like,
every time we walk in the room we turn on the T V --

B.52:  Oh, really?   

A.53:  -- because we don't want to do anything like study or anything,

B.54:  Yeah, that sucks.   

A.55:  so all the, all we do is turn, like, like, when I was in high school I
used to do, like, my homework in front of the T V set,

B.56:  Really?

A.57:  you know.   

B.58:  Uh, kind of annoying but that's cool.

A.59:  What?   

B.60:  Kind of annoying to, like, in front of T V, like trying to do homework, you
know.

A.61:  Yeah.   

B.62:  Trying to write an essay, you start talking about, you know, [laughter]
like, IN LIVING COLOR or something, I don't know.

A.63:  Well, I like, I, I just, I just bogused on all my homework so it really
didn't matter [laughter].

B.64:  Cool, yeah, B S that's the way to do it.   

A.65:  Yeah, I know, and I did that all through college and it worked [laughter].

B.66:  Cool, yeah, works for me.   

A.67:  So, uh, let's see, what else.  Like, the news we don't watch,

B.68:  No, unless, 

A.69:  because they're boring.   

B.70:  I watched through the war, you know, there's only one.

A.71:  Yeah, especially the war, I mean it was like, I, haven't I seen this
episode before, you know.

B.72:  I know, I guess they think that people don't watch T V, but I mean if you
watch it for, like, five minutes, then it repeats everything over and over and
over.

A.73:  Yeah, I know.   

B.74:  It's, like, oh, man.   

A.75:  And, and in North C-, see the, the thing is, like here they just, they just
give you like local news, okay.

B.76:  Yeah.   

A.77:  Like, a house burned down in this little town.   

B.78:  Oh. 

A.79:  And were here, and I go, so what happened worldwide, you know.

B.80:  [Laughter].   

A.81:  It's like, you know, even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died
somewhere else, they're not going to tell you, you know,

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  they're going to spend more time on doing a, a thing on a, on a cross
guard who's a hundred and five years old,

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  than they are on anything else, you know.   

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  So, but, uh, let's see, what else.  Oh, we watch, like for example, uh,
okay, do you watch STAR TREK?

B.88:  Uh, I haven't seen it in years, but I used to.   

A.89:  Okay, well I used to hate STAR TREK.   

B.90:  Yeah?   

A.91:  I thought, I thought, like, when it, like, when I was, like, in high school
and junior high school, I used to hate it --

B.92:  Uh-huh.   

A.93:  -- but then we started watching it.   

B.94:  [Laughter]. 

A.95:  And, and, like, the new ones are pretty cool because,

B.96:  Really?   

A.97:  because they got like, uh, like special, like especially things, that,
like, fuck with your mind.

B.98:  Oh, really, that's cool.

A.99:  Because what happened is, like they have this hologram right,

B.100:  Uh-huh.   

A.101:  where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you
can touch everything and stuff.

B.102:  Are you serious?  Oh, man.

A.103:  But it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like
the hologram makes up all these things and, uh, I mean sometimes it, sometimes
it's funny, sometimes it's not, but, uh, you know,

B.104:  That's cool.   

A.105:  it's something to pass the time, 

B.106:  Sound like (( )).

A.107:  till we do and then, and then we watch football.   

B.108:  Uh, yeah, basketball's cool, but football kind of after a while,

A.109:  Which basketball?   

B.110:  Which basketball?   

A.111:  College or,  

B.112:  Yeah, I kind of like college better, it's more spirited (( )).

A.113:  We got, we got two teams of the A C C going there.   

B.114:  Oh, yeah?   

A.115:  We got Duke and North Carolina.   

B.116:  Cool.   

A.117:  But, I mean the, I mean there's nothing to do, like for example 
yesterday --

B.118:  Uh-huh.   

A.119:  -- uh, they go, s-, some girl goes, do you ((dares)) want to go to a
picnic, right.  I hear no, we're just, you know, it's like we just woke up,

B.120:  [Laughter]. 

A.121:  we had a hangover and everything, you know.  And so we just woke up and,
uh, we're watching T V, and I go, no, today we're just going to dedicate
((ourself)) to watching golf --

B.122:  [Laughter] golf, yay.

A.123:  -- and bowling, you know, and everybody, it was, like, oh, God, do you guys
really watch that?

B.124:  [Laughter].

A.125:  No, you know, I was, like, a whole golf tournament, it's, like, for
example, baseball, I hate baseball, I mean,

B.126:  Oh, me, too.

A.127:  Somebody told me, like, that, like, you can watch baseball, and the actual
play time that there is --

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  -- is five minutes.

B.130:  [Laughter].

A.131:  Because by, the play time is --

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  -- when the person, when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the
catcher or when the, when the pitcher pitches and it's hit.

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  Okay,

B.136:  That's true.

A.137:  and that's, like, you know, five seconds for the whole play --

B.138:  Yeah, that's true.

A.139:  -- and that's it.  I mean, maybe a home run could last a little bit longer
because the guy has to run around all the bases, you know.  But I mean, it's,
it's like that, I mean it's was, it's just, but when I went home that's all,
like, they had on T V --

B.140:  Ooh, really?

A.141:  -- so I tu-, I watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh, my
God.  And T V in Argentina's really bad.

B.142:  Oh, really.  So, so why from Argentina, why'd you come over here?

A.143:  Uh, because, uh, I wanted to go to school here.   

B.144:  Oh, that's cool.   

A.145:  Yeah,  

B.146:  How long did you live there? 

A.147:  they have better computer science up here than they, than they do down
there.

B.148:  Oh {faint}.

A.149:  So, and I also, uh, my father works for I B M,

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  and we came up here, we, well, we came to the United States in nineteen
seventy-six,

B.152:  Uh.

A.153:  seventy-seven --

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  -- and, uh, we lived here for about seven years then we moved back.

B.156:  Huh.

A.157:  And so then I said, I'm going to move back up there to go to college.

B.158:  [Laughter] That's cool.

A.159:  He goes, okay.  So he goes, but do it fast, so I did my undergraduate in
two years.

B.160:  Oh, really?  Awesome.   

A.161:  Yeah.  So, but it's, a, it's just, you know, oh, well, we've been talking
for five minutes.

B.162:  That's cool. 

A.163:  That's the only obligation we have.   

B.164:  Groovy.   

A.165:  And, uh, well, tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks.

B.166:  Yeah, no doubt.   

A.167:  Okay.   

B.168:  Okay. 

A.169:  All right, nice talking to you.   

B.170:  Yeah, you, too.
