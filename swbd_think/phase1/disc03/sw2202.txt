=============================================================================

A.1:  So what kind of music do you like?   

@B.2:  I like all kinds of music actually.   

A.3:  Yeah, that's, same here.   

B.4:  I'm kind of partial to country western, I like that.   

A.5:  Do you?   

B.6:  And I like mood music, like, you know, when I'm in the mood for that.

A.7:  Yeah.   

B.8:  I like semiclassical.  The real classics I'm not as familiar with as, you
know, the ordinary sounds that you hear every day,

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  type of thing.   

A.11:  Yeah, that's about, that's about all I listen to is the classical --

B.12:  Uh-huh.   

A.13:  -- stuff.  We have a, we have a really good classical radio station here.
It's, uh, gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody.  It's, uh, one
hundred percent listener supported.

B.14:  Oh, huh.   

A.15:  And it's a twenty-four hour station.   

B.16:  Oh, that's fantastic.   

A.17:  Yeah, they, they get a lot of support here.   

B.18:  Well we have a similar, uh, radio station here.  And because of the, uh,
people, I guess being pressured to have advertisers, you know, a lot of the
stations have to have advertisers --

A.19:  Uh-huh.   

B.20:  -- they kind of like compromised and they do some of it at like certain
hours, but it's not always at a time when you can, you know, sit down and
listen to it, so --

A.21:  Uh-huh.   

B.22:  -- you, you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is
available,

A.23:  Yeah.   

B.24:  type of thing, you know.   

A.25:  Yeah, that's the good thing about them.  They do no advertising.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  That's, it's really nice.  Just music.   

B.28:  We have that on T V.  We have two public, uh, broadcasting systems.  Uh,
channel two and thirty-six also, that, are publicly supported.  And they have
excellent programming.

A.29:  Yeah.  I li-, I like P B S.   

B.30:  Yeah, yep.   

A.31:  Uh,  

B.32:  Same thing. 

A.33:  P B S here you can't get it unless you have cable.   

B.34:  Uh-huh.   

A.35:  And that really upsets me because I won't pay cable prices because there's,
it's, it's useless having cable I think.

B.36:  It is.  It's expensive.   

A.37:  It's, uh, it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there.

B.38:  No, and the, the problem is that they can do it at will, you know, like, up
the prices and you're, if you have it you just have to pay it.

A.39:  Yeah, exactly.   

B.40:  You know, that's the hard part.   

A.41:  I've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it.   

B.42:  Yeah.   

A.43:  Every time I get one of those special offers in the mail.  

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  I've avoided the temptation so far, but I sure do miss P B S.

B.46:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

A.47:  Because they may have lots of good stuff, MASTERPIECE THEATRE and mystery
--

B.48:  Yep.   

A.49:  -- and nature.   

B.50:  See we have cable here.   

A.51:  Yeah.   

B.52:  And almost everyone here has cable.  And it, uh,  

A.53:  [Throat_clearing].   

B.54:  it's good because you don't need the outside antennas with your T V
inside.

A.55:  Yeah.   

B.56:  And it gives you a lot more, uh, of the other, you know, of the widest, uh,

A.57:  Uh-huh.   

B.58:  television that's available to you.   

A.59:  Yeah.  I, I had cable before I, uh, came up here and I miss some of it.  I
mean we had pretty good cable where I was but,

B.60:  Uh-huh.   

A.61:  I miss Discovery Channel, and A and E.   

B.62:  Yeah, that's what I like.   

A.63:  And C N N.   

B.64:  Yep, right.   

A.65:  You know,  

B.66:  And I love that.   

A.67:  I'm having C N N withdrawal pains.   

B.68:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Do you go to the theatre for, for music?  Uh,

A.69:  Every once in a while.  Uh,

B.70:  Have you been to the opera ever?   

A.71:  Uh, occasionally.   

B.72:  Yeah.   

A.73:  Down in Charlotte.   

B.74:  Oh, that's nice.   

A.75:  Yeah, it, it's, it's pretty good.   

B.76:  I've seen MAN OF LA MANCHA and, uh, a few of those, you know,

A.77:  Um, yeah.   

B.78:  that in Boston and, uh, I enjoyed it thoroughly, I really did.  I've seen
a few musicals and I go to Atlantic City once in a while and I always like to
catch some shows when I'm there.

A.79:  Uh-huh.   

B.80:  Especially, like, when they have special singers and things, and LA CAGE
AU FAUX,

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  that was excellent.   

A.83:  Yeah.  I been into Boston a few times.   

B.84:  #Uh-huh.#   

A.85:  #Uh,# I was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and, went out
to the, uh, Esplanade, and,

B.86:  Oh, wow.   

A.87:  #listened to the Boston Pops and,#  

B.88:  #Well, we're only about two hours# from there.   

A.89:  they're good, they're really, oh, really?   

B.90:  Yeah.   

A.91:  Yeah, Boston's okay, I mean I wouldn't want to live there, 

B.92:  No.   

A.93:  but it's a nice place to visit.   

B.94:  Right.  I, I,

A.95:  Yeah, it's crowded.  I know that.   

B.96:  [Laughter] it sure is.   

A.97:  It's murder driving in that place.   

B.98:  Isn't it awful?   

A.99:  Yeah.  I always get stuck in the, in the afternoon traffic. 

B.100:  Oh, yeah.  I, I think that the commute to, to and from work has to be the
worst horror show.

A.101:  [Laughter].   

B.102:  Because even the breakdown lane is used for a pass-, you know, a travel
lane in the morning.

A.103:  Uh-huh.   

B.104:  And that's really, I think that's a very serious thing, you know, I'm
surprised they haven't had more, you know, really fatal accidents out there
doing that.

A.105:  Well, I tell you, the way people are driving nowadays I'm surprised we're
not killing more people than we are.

B.106:  Oh, I know, it's true, true.   

A.107:  Seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year.  

B.108:  So what are you majoring in?   

A.109:  Uh, human factors.   

B.110:  Oh.  And, and what is that?   

A.111:  That's, uh, well, it's sort of difficult to explain.  It's [breathing] it's
industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the human
factor standpoint,

B.112:  Oh.  

A.113:  how does it interface with the person using it.   

B.114:  Oh, I see.    

A.115:  And, and,

B.116:  Yeah, we had someone from, uh, do some ergonomics in our area.  Do you, do
--

A.117:  Yeah, it, that's very similar.   

B.118:  -- cover some of that?   

A.119:  Yeah,  

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  very similar.  Uh, uh, specializing in the computer end.   

B.122:  Oh, oh, oh.   

A.123:  You know, uh, interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of
good stuff.

B.124:  Oh, well then, this is right up your alley,   

A.125:  Yeah, this is,  

B.126:  what they're trying,

A.127:  uh, sort of the same sort of thing.   

B.128:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.129:  That's, why it's, uh, it was the professor who brought this thing in.  He'd
gone to a conference,

B.130:  Uh-huh.    

A.131:  down there and brought this thing up and I, yeah, sure I'll do it.

B.132:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.133:  Why not?   

B.134:  Really.   

A.135:  Hey, if T I wants to give me five bucks a phone call, that's okay.

B.136:  Sure, sure.   

A.137:  You have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place.
[Breathing] {sounds like speaker is smoking}.

B.138:  Yeah.  It's true.  It is int-, in fact I have a friend of mine that moved
to North Carolina she's, uh, an emergency room nurse.  She does operating room
--

A.139:  Uh-huh.   

B.140:  -- and, uh, she's been down there a couple years and she really loves it.

A.141:  Where's she at?   

B.142:  I don't know the city.   

A.143:  Yeah there's,

B.144:  All I know is it's down in, in North Carolina.  Fact the last time she was
up, I meant to ask her, you know, what city she was in.  I didn't, but she
said it's really nice.

A.145:  Yeah, there's not too many,  

B.146:  (( )). 

A.147:  not too many big ones around here.   

B.148:  No.   

A.149:  No, matter fact we don't have any big ones [laughter].   

B.150:  [Laughter].   

A.151:  After, you know, after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta, you
come here and,

B.152:  Yeah.   

A.153:  you know, they, people think Charlotte is the big town, you know
[laughter].

B.154:  Oh, wow.   

A.155:  And it's small.   

B.156:  Really?   

A.157:  Yeah.   

B.158:  What's the population?   

A.159:  Uh, Charlotte, oh, what about quarter of a million.   

B.160:  Oh, that's, that's pretty good size, though.   

A.161:  Oh, it's fairly good size,  

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  I mean, it's, it's not, it's not small,  

B.164:  Yeah. 

A.165:  but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards.   

B.166:  Yeah.   

A.167:  Course everything's small cons-, compared to Atlanta.   

B.168:  I, I liked Atlanta, too.  I have a sister-in-law that lives in Atlanta.

A.169:  Yeah, my, my brother and, uh, sister-in-law live there.  I like,

B.170:  They, she, uh, she in fact, went from Massachusetts to, uh, Florida, then
to Atlanta and she really, really likes it.

A.171:  Yeah, Atlanta's, Atlanta's a good city, it really is.  Uh, you have to get
used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty-five.

B.172:  Yeah.   

A.173:  But, uh, if you, if you miss it at the right time of the day, then you're
okay.

B.174:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.175:  But it always seemed like when I was there I was always finishing, I lived
in Duluth, which is, uh, north of Atlanta, well, not north, it's more east --

B.176:  Uh-huh.   

A.177:  -- uh, along I eighty-five --  

B.178:  Uh-huh.   

A.179:  -- and I would always be on the other end of two eighty-five having to go
all the way around two eighty-five and then onto eighty-five to go home,

B.180:  Oh.  

A.181:  and it was always at the end of the day.   

B.182:  Yeah.   

A.183:  I never managed to plan my departure right.   

B.184:  [Laughter] The airport's something down there.   

A.185:  Oh, yeah.   

B.186:  Oh, my God, I, I swear those (( )) planes, going or coming, going or
coming.

A.187:  Yeah, yeah, it's scary.   

B.188:  It is.  It's un-,

A.189:  It's scary, they, they rival even, uh, Chicago on, uh,  

B.190:  Yes. 

A.191:  departure and arrival, uh,  

B.192:  Unbeliev-, 

A.193:  number of arrivals every day.    

B.194:  In fact, when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we
watched.  I couldn't believe,

A.195:  Yeah,  

B.196:  the traffic. 

A.197:  oh, it's busy, it's a busy place.   

B.198:  It is.   

A.199:  And they have amazingly few accidents there.   

B.200:  I know, isn't it?   

A.201:  Amazingly few.   

B.202:  Unreal.   

A.203:  Because, uh, I mean if you're flying anywhere down here, you always go
through Atlanta.  You can't avoid it.

B.204:  Uh-huh.   

A.205:  It's the hub city.   

B.206:  Yep, yep.   

A.207:  And, uh, God.   

B.208:  I went there to, to visit the Underground when that was, you know the
Underground City.

A.209:  Uh-huh, yeah.   

B.210:  And I thought that was really neat.   

A.211:  Yeah.   

B.212:  Amazing. 

A.213:  That's super, it's getting even better, too.   

B.214:  Oh, really?    

A.215:  Yeah, they, they just, they never stop doing things to it.  

B.216:  Is that right?   

A.217:  All kinds of good stuff go-,    

B.218:  Course, I haven't been there in about, uh, eight years.   

A.219:  Yeah,  

B.220:  So, 

A.221:  last, well, see I left there in, uh, eighty [click] {tongue} what was it,
eighty-six --

B.222:  Yeah.   

A.223:  -- so it's been, it's been five years.  

B.224:  Five years.    

A.225:  for me.   

B.226:  The, the growth in that place is phenomenal.   

A.227:  Yeah.  It just doesn't stop.   

B.228:  They don't stand still, that's for sure.   

A.229:  I mean,   

B.230:  We're having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and,

A.231:  Yeah.   

B.232:  credit unions,  

A.233:  Yeah.   

B.234:  and all that kind of good stuff.   

A.235:  Yeah.   

B.236:  And it's starting to effect, you know, the economy.   

A.237:  Sure.   

B.238:  Because of, uh, the, uh, businesses that have their money tied up.

A.239:  Yeah, exactly.   

B.240:  Every place you go, you know, the,

A.241:  Couple of years ago I was thinking about moving to Massachusetts,

B.242:  #Uh-huh.#   

A.243:  #but, uh,# boy I'm glad I didn't --  

B.244:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.245:  -- because it's really going downhill up there.

B.246:  It has.  I don't know what they're going to have to do to boost it, but
they need to do something quick.

A.247:  Well, you know, I, I was, when, when the big boom was going on, I was
thinking well, Dukakis must be an absolute genius --

B.248:  Yeah.   

A.249:  -- and then I, I, I really think that all of that was just, you know,
temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential
election.

B.250:  Yeah.   

A.251:  Because it certainly wasn't sustained.   

B.252:  Sometimes I wonder, though, if the Presidential election isn't what really
did everything in, because he wasn't really paying attention to business, you
know.

A.253:  Well,

B.254:  You can't do both things well.   

A.255:  Yeah, but on the other hand, if it, if it needed his personal intervention
all the time, then it wasn't a good system anyway.

B.256:  No, true, #but, uh,# 

A.257:  #You know, it should,# it should have been rolling right along without him.

B.258:  Yeah.   

A.259:  You know, good, a good chief executive would be able to sit back,

B.260:  That's true. 

A.261:  and not do anything.   

B.262:  Yep, that's,

A.263:  Hopefully.   

B.264:  Yeah [laughter].  Somebody has to watch the store, though, you can't
really --

A.265:  No, that's true.   

B.266:  -- you know, without overseeing,   

A.267:  And, and, and Lord knows without the legislature up there they probably did
all kinds of things while he wasn't looking.

B.268:  Sure, sure.   

A.269:  So.   

B.270:  Look at what happened just in Washington alone.  God. 

A.271:  Yeah.  Well you can't,  

B.272:  It's mind boggling.   

A.273:  You can't trust legislators anyway.   

B.274:  [Laughter] No.  Well, it's been interesting talking to you. 

A.275:  Yeah, we n-, we didn't talk too much about music, but we had a good
conversation [laughter].

B.276:  But, oh, yeah, right [laughter].  I hope to hear,
