============================================================================

@A.1:  Do yo-, are you on a reg-, regular exercise program right now? 

B.2:  Yes, and I hate it [laughter].   

A.3:  [Laughter].   

B.4:  How about you?   

A.5:  Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on.

B.6:  Off and on well, I guess I've been kind of off and on I've, uh,

A.7:  Right now I'm kind of off.

B.8:  Had some health problems that have led me to, uh, I'd say more on than off
[laughter].

A.9:  Okay, what type of exercise do you do?

B.10:  Uh, I do walking on the treadmill, and then I do low impact aerobics.

A.11:  Okay.  I guess you don't enjoy that very much.   

B.12:  Not, not really.

A.13:  Do you find that, uh, to be boring?

B.14:  Yeah, and time consuming, I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring
and time consuming, it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know, then you have to
take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.

A.19:  But I,

B.20:  Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
[laughter].

A.21:  Yeah, I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not I just
bought myself a solo flex machine, I don't know if you've seen those
advertised on T V.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.  But I
haven't really sat down and used it match yet, so it's collecting dust right
now.

B.24:  [Laughter] Yeah, a lot of things do that. I had an,

A.25:  I used to jog somewhat.

B.26:  I had an exercise bike I use to have one, and I finally got rid of sit
cause I never used it, but I do use my treadmill [breathing].

A.27:  Uh-huh, well, that's good.  Yeah, my parents have a treadmill it's, when I
go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.

B.28:  Yeah, it's nice because when the weathers bad you can't, you don't have any
[laughter] excuse.

A.29:  Uh-huh, I just got the bicycle out today, and it was real nice outside, had
to get out to do something.

B.30:  Yeah, I can't ride a bike so.

A.31:  I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so thought
I,

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.

B.34:  Yeah, it's too nice, it's been too nice all weekend.   

A.35:  But, uh, yeah, I need to start jog something again.  I've always of that to
be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise, but it's terribly boring,
and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.

B.36:  Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?

A.37:  No, I never have.  Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries
I usually only go about a mile or two.

B.38:  I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on
your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt,

A.39:  Yeah,

B.40:  worse. 

A.41:  it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete,  

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  or on asphalt.  Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or
dirt to jog on.

B.44:  Yeah, that's not quite so [laughter],   

A.45:  You have to have the right,

B.46:  so easy.   

A.47:  type of shoes too, that's,  

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  very important.   

B.50:  Yeah.  I found that,

A.51:  But,

B.52:  true especially from walking on ((toe and fronts)).   

A.53:  Yeah, I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much
use [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter] Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six
months.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  I usually enjoy the exercise I do but, uh, like I said I'm just
not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.  So I'll, I'll bicycle I
get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent
basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile, but then I'll get tired
of doing that,

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a
week.

B.58:  (( )). 

A.59:  But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,  

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a
little bit, I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that
thing on a consistent basis.

B.62:  Yeah, well, don't let it collect dust.  At least exercise while dusting it
off [laughter].

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  [Laughter] [breathing] well.   

A.65:  Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can,
uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.

B.66:  Yeah, that, that'll be good.   

A.67:  I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a
lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.

B.68:  Uh-huh.   

A.69:  Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical
education courses on exercise, an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks
session on a universal machine, lifting weights and,

B.70:  Oh.

A.71:  uh, working out like that.  And that was very helpful we kept charts of
our progress,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see
how much you improved over the weeks.  I found that to be, uh, very helpful.

B.74:  Are you going to do that?   

A.75:  Uh, I need to,  

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  I haven't started yet but, uh, [laughter] it's a thought.  

B.78:  Well, that sounds like something good to do then.   

A.79:  Sounds like something I should do.   

B.80:  Yeah, nice way to start off this spring.   

A.81:  [Laughter].   

B.82:  Get back in shape.   

A.83:  How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking? 

B.84:  Well, I do, I switch every other day one day I walk and one day I do the
aerobics.

A.85:  Okay, how far, about how far do you go walking?

B.86:  [Breathing] Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now I just had surgery,
um, less then two months ago, and right now I'm just a little over about a
mile and a half,

A.87:  Okay.

B.88:  but I'm trying to workup to three miles.   

A.89:  Well, that's good.  Well they say that walking is just as good if not
better then jogging.

B.90:  Yeah,  

A.91:  It,

B.92:  it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.

A.93:  Sure.   

B.94:  Yeah, but.   

A.95:  Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart
rating going, uh,

B.96:  My walkman broke,  

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  so I'm upset [laughter],  

A.99:  [Laughter].

B.100:  and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud [laughter].  

A.101:  Yeah.   

B.102:  [Laughter].   

A.103:  But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is. 

B.104:  Yeah, it is and this doesn't, you know, my treadmill has an incline and,
you know, you can get a really good workout on it.

A.105:  Um, do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch,

B.106:  No, I,

A.107:  on T V?   

B.108:  I just do it on T V,  

A.109:  Okay.

B.110:  I have a cassette.    

A.111:  Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V?   

B.112:  Um, it's a, it's a tap-, I use tapes.   

A.113:  Oh, okay, okay, like a Cathy Smith workout,  

B.114:  Or, or Richard Simmons,

A.115:  or Jane Fonda.   

B.116:  [Laughter].   

A.117:  Okay [laughter].   

B.118:  Sweating to the oldies [laughter].   

A.119:  Right.  I, ev-, every now and then I'll watch E S P N, I get cable on T V,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training, and, uh, what
is the other one called.

B.122:  There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N, I don't know if he's still on
any more or not, I don-, I don't know if I get E S P N or not [laughter].

A.123:  Uh-huh.   

B.124:  But, uh, one, you know, I use to watch one, watch one on the air, but that
was back,

A.125:  BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of.

B.126:  That's was, yeah.   

A.127:  With Gill.   

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  (( )).    

B.130:  Yeah, I watched that cause he was cute [laughter].   

A.131:  Yeah, [laughter] he-, he-, he's not bad his assistants usually aren't
either.

B.132:  [Laughter].   

A.133:  [Laughter].   

B.134:  But, uh,  

A.135:  They're always in, in Hawaii some place.   

B.136:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.137:  On, on the beach.   

B.138:  But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and, 

A.139:  Yeah, well, they, they do low I pact stuff now,  

B.140:  Do they.

A.141:  they're on every day.   

B.142:  Are the-, yeah they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.

A.143:  Yeah, every morning.   

B.144:  I'll have to tune in.   

A.145:  It's on E S P N, uh, at what time, I can't remember what time.  It's, uh,
you know, I can't remember offhand what time.

B.146:  I'll have to check it, check,  

A.147:  Yeah (( )).

B.148:  check, check it back up, and, but the thing is everybody always looks so
good on that show, at least on (( )) [laughter].

A.149:  Yeah, every now and then.  

B.150:  Not everybody has a picture perfect body.   

A.151:  Uh-huh, well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than
the other shows that are on T V.

B.152:  I haven't watch any other ones on T V.   

A.153:  They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day.   

B.154:  Just on some of the tapes.   

A.155:  Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.   

B.156:  Okay, [laughter] thanks.   

A.157:  I actually taped a few session that they had on there but, 

B.158:  Now, that's a thought.

A.159:  uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made. 

B.160:  [Laughter].   

A.161:  So I'm kind of bad about that myself.

@@B.162:  Well, that's thought, I haven't thought about that, well they're going to
beep us pretty soon.
