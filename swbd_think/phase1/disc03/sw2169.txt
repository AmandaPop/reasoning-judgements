REMARKS:        Extremely muffled, especially Speaker A.  Talk on top of 
each other very much.  Speaker A breaths into phone.

============================================================================

A.1:  I think I was one.  Okay. Um, first thing I thought of was just the men
that put the flyers on the door.  Every Christian, and I think I feel sorry
for people that have to do that, you know what I mean.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  I always pray for the guys.  But when I'm sitting on my couch and it's, 
and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob, it's kind of 
frightening [laughter] like whoa, and I've, I've kind of gotten used to it, 
but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming 
up from the side, because you can't see them approaching your house, you know,
#they just,#

B.4:  #Uh-huh,# right, because they're just sort of coming from the side #or
whatever. Yeah.#

A.5:  #Exactly, and when# I'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all
of a sudden somebody, a man's got their hand on my door knob, it's like, uh, um
{sharp intake of breath}.  Like oh, no.  And I don't, I don't like that, and I
guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to
prevent that or, you know --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- I think there's other ways to advertise other than a flyer on your door.

B.8:  Yeah, plus, uh, you know, look at the, you know, the, besides the po-, the,
the aspect of invasion of privacy, there's a big pollution aspect, too.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  I find I throw out a,

A.11:  [Breathing].

B.12:  lot of those flyers, and I have no interest in whatever they are.

A.13:  #Right.#

B.14:  #I, I do,# I find out, and there's a law that just the things you get in
the mail --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- I, you know, my, my name being sold if I, if I give money to the World
Wil-, Wildlife Federation, you know, it's a, it's a --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- I feel it's an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk
mail.

A.19:  #Right.#

B.20:  #Because# they sell my address.

A.21:  Right, I do too.  Even the,

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  credit card things and like we have a Visa, and we've got, we get ten
applications probably a #month# --

B.24:  #That's,# I agree, yeah, and, 

A.25:  -- for other Visas, and it's like, wait a minute, we have a commitment with
the company we're with.  If I want a Visa from your company --

B.26:  I'll call you.

A.27:  -- I'll call you.

B.28:  [Laughter]  #That's right.#

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  And they all say that they're the best Visa, but, you know, I definitely
have the one that I so far picked out to be the best, you know --

A.31:  #Yeah.#

B.32:  -- #because# of the low interest rate or whatever.  

A.33:  #Yeah.#

B.34:  #You know,# very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest
rate.  They're always more expensive.  And they, uh, you know, if you stay, if
you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you
get a good, um --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- a good credit line so you don't like to bot-, I don't like to bother
with it.  Yeah.

A.37:  It shows stability.  But, um, now I also thought I, I get calls, I'm a
housewife so I'm home a lot in the day --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and, I, I get probably four calls, probably four a day, probably three
day a norm, but seems like, it seems like it's more than that of phone calls,
and, and it, I've gotten to where I've really had to say, okay, wait a minute,
this, you know, it's okay to be nice, and sometimes, you know, I feel like God
says talk to this person or something.

B.40:  Yeah.  Huh.

A.41:  But most of the time I just have gotten where I can say I'm not interested,
thank you, and I just hang, you know, and I hang up real nicely, but, um, I
know a few months ago, I, I would feel that I had to explain to them that I'm
on the other line, or I'm in the middle, and it's, I've just come to a
realization that I don't have to explain to #this stranger what I'm,# 

B.42:  #Uh-huh, that's right.#

A.43:  doing it, and give excuses, that's it's okay just to say I'm not interested
and go ahead and hang up.  But, I, I don't know, I don't think most people are
secure enough to probably answer like that --

B.44:  #Yeah, that's right.#

A.45:  -- #and therefore I think# it's an invasion of privacy --

B.46:  [Throat_clearing] #It takes, uh.#

A.47:  -- #because I thought# all these people share, you know, what they're
doing, even though it's none of the business --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and I did it for a long time, and, and, I just, I thought that was one,
I thought of that #right off.#

B.50:  #Yeah, they# ask you a lot of, they ask you a lot of personal questions,
and they, yep, and, you know, they, and they just keep talking to you, too.
I, I, I find that a big pain.

A.51:  Yeah, right and,

B.52:  I think,

A.53:  they don't want to let you go, they don't believe you, if you're on
another line long distance --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- and they just want to keep going and going and stuff.  #So.#

B.56:  #I# think, do you find that as a woman, that you probably see more things
of invasions of privacy than, uh, a man would?

A.57:  Um, yeah, I probably do.  I feel like, I don't know, I'm a Christian.  I
feel like --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- women are more usually deceived.  Yo-, I feel like, I don't think that's
necessarily a bad thing, because God gave us husbands and fathers --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- to help look out for us.  But I know that during the day, the, when the
((cults)) come by, they come by during the day, and it says in the BIBLE, that
be ((leery)) of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly
women, lay captive with gossip and stuff,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  and I see that they don't come home when my husband's here, they don't
come to my house normally when my husband's here.  They come when I'm here
alone.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And I notice that, and it's almost like there's a, a subconscious
understanding, I think it's spiritual, that you can rationally explain the
subconscious understanding, that you know there's, there's a more gullibility
here,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  when there's not a, a man present.  I don't think I'm less than a man
because of that, uh, but I see that, and,

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  God's really shown me that, and I don't talk to them.  I don't try and
witness to them --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- I don't try and convert them.  I just say, You can, you can ei-, you can
come back when my husband's here if you'd like to, but we're Christians,
good-bye and I shut the door, and that's it.  And I'm not angry to them, you
know what I mean?

B.72:  You know what's really funny, um, is that I get calls, you know,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  mostly telephone sales people that I just, you know, that want to start
beating my ear, you know --

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  -- and, um, and then they start asking, you know, well is your wife there.

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  And then I'm thinking, well how did they know I was married?

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  You know, and I'll say, I'll say, no she's not, because actually my wife
and I live apart right now because I'm in graduate school.

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  And, um, so I only get to see her on Thursday through Monday.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  And it's one of those things where they'll say, oh, your wife's not
there?  And I'll say, I'll say no.  Oh, well, when is she going to be there?
#And I'm like well# --

A.85:  #Are you kidding?#

B.86:  -- she's never going to be there.  

A.87:  #Oh, man.#

B.88:  #Yes, she's never going to be here.#

A.89:  #They do that, really?#

B.90:  #Oh, yeah, uh-huh.#

A.91:  #See I,#

B.92:  #And, and they'll# keep going until they get that out of you when your
wife is going to be here, because they want us to be here together, because I
guess I, it's,

A.93:  She can talk you into that,

B.94:  yeah, maybe #she would talk me in ((and maybe)),#

A.95:  #Most, a lot of# women, a lot of women, most women control the budgets and
they control,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  the money and they control the husband [laughter].  I mean most of the
time that's how it works.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  So, so therefore, I guess that they, they, they see that, um,

B.100:  #Yeah, they, they do.#

A.101:  #So they say, like I can talk her into it,#

B.102:  ((What do you think)) I just, just threw out stuff tonight that, uh.  I
walked out of a grocery store, and a fellow said, you know, for a dollar, you
can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries, and normally when you
see these things, it's normally, um, uh, a church, you know, that's doing a
raffle or it's some type of boy scouts --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- or it's some type of group or whatever, and I, automatically you think,
oh it's a raffle, must be for the kids, you know,

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  so you put out your dollar and you fill out this coupon, and then when
you look at it as you walking away you see that it's for some sales pitch of
some kind where they're going to, you know, and I find that a big invasion of
privacy.  I just, I'm, from then on in it's like, oh, this makes me angry, you
know.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Now you have to question everybody on what they're doing, now, you sure
this goes to such and such organization?  And you sure you're with multiple
dys-, muscular dystrophy or whatever.  I find that a big invasion of privacy,
too,

A.109:  #Yeah.#

B.110:  #because they# sort of pull,

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  that over on you, you know, like, um --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- like this is a charitable organization but actually it's not, it's a
come-on so that they can get your name and phone number.  So,

A.115:  Huh.

B.116:  because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell
you that you won.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  But actually they started calling me, telling me that I could, you know,
buy a soft, water softener --

A.119:  Oh, great.

B.120:  -- and they called me for, um, what else other than water softener, the
same place called me for something else in kitchen.  It was all kitchen stuff.

A.121:  That's funny.

B.122:  They put me on, and they all called me,

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  you know, and each one asked me,

A.125:  (( )).

B.126:  when my wife was going to be here.

A.127:  ((Oh, they're)) I know, it's funny how you can look back as a Christian,
you can see how these things apply and they're true.  And in even, even in
people that are giving groceries it's like they, there's just a pattern that
you can see in things like that.  I've noticed that about the cults, that they
work our neighborhood in the day, and they work them good, and I consider
that, I kind of consider that an invasion of privacy, but not so much as I do
the other,

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  you know what I mean --

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  -- because, but I do, to a degree, there's also not a day to day
occurrence, it's not that often that they come by, but I've notice, it's kind
of gone down before, and when we first moved here, it was pretty often, but
I've noticed that they really work in the day, and you very rarely see them in
the evening, because the men are home. #And so,#

B.132:  #Well I think also,# you know, in th-, the, if men are home during the day,
they're, they're, um, they might be unemployed men, who might be more apt to,
uh --

A.133:  Right.

B.134:  -- you know, be at the end of their rope --

A.135:  #Right.#

B.136:  -- #and be looking# for, uh, uh, a salvation in the sense or looking for a,
uh, saving grace, you know.

A.137:  #Looking for something,# 

B.138:  #Looking for something.#

A.139:  yeah, #kind of depressed or something.#

B.140:  #Yeah, they're searching for something.#

A.141:  #Yeah, I didn't think of that, but yeah, that's good.#

B.142:  #And also, and also, you know, the woman# at home during the day, if, if
the housewife is at home, um, you know, she may be bored at the time --

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  -- so she'll spend a little bit more time to listen, I think --

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  -- you know, because she may have finished her work, the kids may be taking
a nap, they may, uh --

A.147:  Right.

B.148:  -- they may be playing some place, 

A.149:  Right.

B.150:  you know, or,

A.151:  And and there's nobod-, but there's no husband there to come,

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  in and say, wait a minute.  

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  You know, I really think this is good, and that one, I think we need
that, but I know I need it.  But, um, the only thing I would follow is my
husband just said this, he said public bathrooms [laughter].

B.156:  He said what?

A.157:  Public bathroom [laughter].

B.158:  That's an invasion of privacy?

A.159:  Well, he was teasing, but he was just being smart, because, because, you
know, you don't want to go in #the public bathroom.#

B.160:  #[Laughter] Well that's true, that's true.# [laughter].

A.161:  What can we do to solve that?  We can make the architects for all the
buildings make private stalls for everyone.  I thought that was funny but,

B.162:  Well, you know, the, the terrible thing is, I don't know if you've watched
the news,

A.163:  [Barking].

B.164:  lately, I guess we just had something up here, (( )) I'm in Baltimore,
Maryland.

A.165:  Uh-huh.

B.166:  So, um, I get, you know, we, I saw some news out of like New Hampshire
and a big thing in the courts right now is, um, they don't have enough stalls
in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms.

A.167:  #That's funny.#

B.168:  #So that men,# you know, because men design these things, men can go in and
use the urinal or use the toilet, but, their lines are always, you know, they
go through much faster.

A.169:  #Yeah, I did hear that on the news.#

B.170:  #but, but the women have to wait# in long lines that are uncomfortable,

A.171:  [/Breathing].

B.172:  and, and if they really have to go, it's a very difficult problem to be,
you have to stand in line for an hour.  And, uh, and then the whole,

A.173:  [Laughter].
