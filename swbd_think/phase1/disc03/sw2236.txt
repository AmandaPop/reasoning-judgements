===========================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] Good morning.    

B.2:  Uh, hi.  You mentioned model railroading, that, uh,

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  I, I've been, uh, I've been watching a program on the public broadcasting
station here, uh, about model railroading.  Have you ever seen that?

A.5:  [Breathing] I, I always turn on the T V set, and it seems like I catch
that program, in the last five minutes --

B.6:  Uh, 

A.7:  -- and, 

B.8:  well, it's been very interesting.

A.9:  I, I think it, you know, what I see is fascinating, and I kind of enjoy it.
Uh, I've always had that hobby, ever since I was a child --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- and, uh, I refuse to get involved, because I never had space for a
permanent layout --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- and then, here, about five years ago, we bought a big old house out in
((Virginia)), and there was a, a, there was two basements.

B.14:  Wow.  

A.15:  There were two, two separate furnace rooms, and so I took the smaller
furnace room and now it's full,

B.16:  [Laughter].  

A.17:  [Laughter] of trains.  

B.18:  You should have taken the larger one, huh?  [Laughter].  

A.19:  [Laughter].  

B.20:  Well, uh, my, uh, brother had a Lionel train set.  He was a, a bit older
than, I, and, so when I came along, I was interested in, fooling with the
train, and since he was past that stage, why, he didn't have any objections,
and, uh, in fact I started doing a layout, uh, in our garage at one time, but,
I got about as far as sort of painting some streets and things on a piece of
plywood and putting up a few things, and it got to be hot summertime when I
gave it up [laughter].

A.21:  Uh.  

B.22:  But, uh, I've always enjoyed, uh, the train and, you know, fooling with it
and all.

A.23:  Do you still have the, uh, train set?  

B.24:  He has it.  

A.25:  He has it.  

B.26:  Yeah.  I mean since it was his, I couldn't very well, keep it forever
[laughter].

A.27:  Uh.  

B.28:  But, uh, actually, I, I have, had an idea not long ago, uh, hope to build
another house some day, and I was thinking I might, uh, incorporate some sort
of a display space, and ask him if he would let me put the train up, you know,
not, not as a working type of thing, but just to --

A.29:  Put it on display.

B.30:  -- uh-huh.  

A.31:  (( )) the early Lionel can be quite valuable.  

B.32:  Yeah.  I don't know what year his was bought, but probably around nineteen
forty, forty-two maybe.

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  I'm just guessing, but, something like that I would think.  

A.35:  Well, some of those, around the war years were, uh, kind of difficult to
get a hold of, because Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of, uh, uh,
war equipment --

B.36:  Uh-huh.   

A.37:  -- and, I, I think he almost discontinued production, uh, in nineteen
forty-two, and forty-three.

B.38:  Oh really.  

A.39:  So some of the prewar models are quite valuable.  

B.40:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if, I don't know if he knows.  I know
there's some, uh, booklets and things, you know, showing different models and
stuff, that are quite old, that were with it.  But I don't know they were
original, or if they were picked up, you know, in later years.

A.41:  Well, I menaged to sweet talk my brother out of, uh, his Lionel train set
that, dated back to about nineteen thirty-three --

B.42:  Uh.  

A.43:  -- and, uh, he kind of not happy I've got it now [laughter]. 

B.44:  [Laughter].   

A.45:  [Laughter] I'm, I'm not going to give it back.  

B.46:  [Laughter] Yeah.  That's probably the way it goes sometimes [laughter].

A.47:  And I had a, uh, post, uh, World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric,
uh, G T One locomotives, and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs --

B.48:  Oh. 

A.49:  -- so I understand that, that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and
fifty dollars now.

B.50:  Wow.  

A.51:  So, it's, it's sitting on display on top of my book case.  

B.52:  [Laughter] it has a prime one spot, huh?  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  Well, I think those things are neat, and, and I say I watch that show, and
there are some, uh, real interesting museums around, that, uh, have good
displays, and I, I said that, well, if I ever took a trip I, you know, might
ignore some of these museums, because a lot of them are called childrens
museums, or toy museums --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- and, that wouldn't really catch my attention, but if I knew that they
had, you know, really good train layouts, I would want to go and see what they
had.

A.57:  Well, Pennsylvania, used to have, uh, some commercial displays.  There was
one place that was half way between Harrisburg and Allenstown, Pennsylvania,
in a community called Midway,

B.58:  Uh.  

A.59:  which (( )) it was half way, and, uh, we had a huge room which was
probably, uh, forty feet wide, and a hundred and forty feet long.  Uh, and the
central portion of that room was occupied by one huge, low gage lay out,

B.60:  Wow.

A.61:  running, uh, uh, Lionel tr-, and American Flyer trains --

B.62:  Huh.

A.63:  -- and they had done a lot of work on that with, uh, scenery and buildings,
and they had trolleys running around, and, uh, a lot of animation in there,
and, uh, it was in business for a long, long time, I don't know it, it still
maybe in business.

B.64:  It might be.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  Well, uh, you mentioned another hobby, sailing.  Do you have a sail boat?

A.67:  Yes, uh, I bought a, uh, Bristol thirty-five, five, for my wife --

B.68:  Uh.  

A.69:  -- and we keep it on the ((Chesapeake)) Bay, and, uh, starting next
weekend, I'm going to have to go down and, uh, (( )) out for the summer
season.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  We have a cruise plan to sail from, uh, (( )) Maryland, up to Philadelphia
this summer.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  About a two week cruise, and, uh, two or three lay days in Philadelphia.

B.74:  Oh. that'll be nice.  

A.75:  They have a, a new water front, uh, marina in Philadelphia, it isn't as
developed as, uh, Water Side and (( )) the Baltimore, uh, water front, but,
uh, the marina is only about, uh, two or three blocks from the historic
district --

B.76:  Oh. 

A.77:  -- so that's quite, uh -- 

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  -- handy for our youngsters.  We can pick them up and show them the
Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and, uh --

B.80:  Yeah, 

A.81:  -- Franklin, 

B.82:  and just be right there, huh.  

A.83:  Franklin Square.  

B.84:  Yeah.  Well, uh, we're not, uh, really sailors, but, I want some summer
soon, to, uh, hire a sail boat with a captain since we're not, you know,
versed in that, and, uh, go to the Caribbean.

A.85:  Uh.  [Lipsmack] there are some, uh, good opportunities for that in it is
British Virgins.

B.86:  Right.   

A.87:  Uh, 

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  that, that is almost an ideal sailing area.  Uh, if you have a, even a
little bit of experience, uh, I've seen a number of people go through a, a, a
cruising class in ((Annapolis)) --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- where they might get, uh, maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing
experience, go down to, uh, uh, British ((tortolla)) and charter a boat for a
week, and they take it out and have a grand time.

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  Uh, it's fairly sheltered waters right there, and, uh, you don't need any
fancy navigation equipment, because you can see all your destinations from
[laughter],

B.94:  Right,

A.95:  uh,

B.96:  it did sound fascinating to me.  I would love to, just go down, I've
always liked islands and water, and that sort of thing anyway, and, uh, been
on a couple of big cruise ships, so, uh, you know, I kind of had seen it from
that point of view, but I, I think I would like the sail boat.

A.97:  Uh-huh, uh, I've been there, several times, uh, the first trip, uh, we flew
down and, uh, chartered a, uh, Morgan, uh, forty-five --

B.98:  Uh.  

A.99:  -- and I had fun that, then a few years later a guy I was racing with, uh,
decided to take his boat down, for a winter season, and so I went offshore
with him to, uh, Saint Thomas, and then we cruised, uh, the American Virgins
for a week before I flew home.

B.100:  Which do you think is best, American or British Virgins (( )),

A.101:  I think the better sight seeing is in the, uh, British Virgins.

B.102:  uh-huh.  

A.103:  Uh, there's, uh, some very nice places like the bass which is a, uh, sort
of, a huge monolithic rocks, that you can, you can walk up the beach into
these, uh, enormous caverns that are partially submerged, and you can wade in
the pools and so very popular tourist spot.

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  Uh, (( )) is an excellent resort up in, uh, (( )) which is very easy to get
into, and there's some very nice reefs in that, uh, vicinity, if you like
snorkeling, and, uh, scuba diving, and --

B.106:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's neat. 

A.107:  -- and, uh, there are some very nice resort hotels, so you can go in, and,
uh, enjoy a very classy dinner, uh, the Pier Island Yacht Club is, uh,
extremely exclusive, like, uh, I think they're probably charging five hundred
dollars a day for a room now and,

B.108:  Ooh [laughter]. 

A.109:  [Laughter].  

B.110:  That's getting up there [laughter].

A.111:  And, uh, it's a, kind of a nice place to visit, uh, uh, it's better being
on a boat, than being on land, because, uh, your boat becomes your hotel,
your, uh, your dining room, your taxi cab, and, uh,

B.112:  [Laughter] everything.  

A.113:  everything else.

B.114:  Yeah.  That's why I think it would be neat.

A.115:  Well, I'd recommend it.  

B.116:  Sounds good.  [Breathing] well,  

A.117:  Well, I guess I better get back to work here.  

B.118:  Yeah, we've probably talked long enough, 

A.119:  Okay. 

B.120:  and I've, I've enjoyed talking with you.  

A.121:  Thank you very much.

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  Bye.  

B.124:  Good-bye [noise].
