A.1:  What kind of coins do you primarily collect?   

B.2:  Um, basically I, my preference is Arab coins,  

A.3:  Huh.   

B.4:  and ancient coins.   

A.5:  Huh.  I've got a, uh, I've got a few, I don't know, I don't know, I don't
even know if they're real, but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins
that somebody gave me as I, when I was a kid.  Never done anything with them,
I still got, still got them in a box.

B.6:  Uh-huh.   

A.7:  I'm mostly into, uh, [throat_clearing], American gold and silver dollars
and stuff like that.

B.8:  Oh, very interesting.  Um, over the years, of course, by my grandparents
used to give me silver dollars so I've got a few of those,

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  tucked away but, um, your Greek and Roman coins m-, you know, if, if
they're, um, in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag
them out and,

A.11:  Well, I keep meaning to do that every time I go to a show I keep saying,
well, I'll take them with me and let somebody look at them.  They just, they
just feel phoney, you know, they feel like they're made of lead or something.
And, uh, they don't have any sort of it, it's got a, it's got a like a picture
on it,

B.12:  Uh-huh.   

A.13:  but there's no, uh, inscriptions or, or dates or anything else.

B.14:  That would be the Greek ones? 

A.15:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.   

B.16:  Okay, because I think most the Roman ones have,

A.17:  Had something on them.   

B.18:  Right,  

A.19:  Yeah.   

B.20:  right.  So this,  

A.21:  It had a, it had a, has a bust of somebody on there but, uh, no sort of
identifying marks or anything.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  Um, it, the, are they silver or,  

A.23:  No, I don't,   

B.24:  bronze?   

A.25:  no, they're not, they're, it's, it's too heavy for silver it's, it's more
like lead I think, fairly soft.

B.26:  Oh, interesting.   

A.27:  Yeah, I think they're fakes [laughter].   

B.28:  [Laughter] Did, did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could
have picked up some fakes pretty easily?

A.29:  Probably [laughter].  I don't know,  

B.30:  Oh. 

A.31:  where they got them from.  They just came up and gave me a whole bag of
these things,

B.32:  Uh-huh.    

A.33:  there's probably about thirty or forty of them in there.   

B.34:  Gee.   

A.35:  Yeah they,  

B.36:  That's [laughter], you might be sitting on a gold mine.   

A.37:  Wouldn't that be something.   

B.38:  Right, um, I don't know a lot about, um, Greek and Roman, although, I'm a
member of an organization and that is the, the primary interest of some
ancient, uh, ((Numismatic)) Society Club,

A.39:  Uh-huh.   

B.40:  and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek, so
every now and then we have a program so I've picked up a bit.

A.41:  Huh.   

B.42:  But, um, if it, if they're really soft and very early they could be, uh, I
think they call them Lydian coins.

A.43:  Huh.   

B.44:  And, um,  

A.45:  Gosh, all these years I've been thinking they were fakes, maybe they're
real [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter] Right.  I don't, you know, I, I guess they say that a lot of
people in the, in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes.

A.47:  Uh-huh.   

B.48:  You know, if you go to, um, uh, a fight and then the people say, oh, look
what I just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last
night.

A.49:  Uh-huh [laughter].   

B.50:  But, um, I think that's fairly recent ((phenomena)) probably.

A.51:  Sounds like some of the coin dealers I know [laughter].   

B.52:  [Laughter] Now, now.  They're supposed to, they're supposed to be licensed
and ((the)), um, aboveboard.

A.53:  [Throat_clearing] [Laughter] Right.  I used to be a coin dealer so I, I
know,

B.54:  Oh, I see.   

A.55:  I know those guys, you kn-,

B.56:  Oh, and you made your own,   

A.57:  Yeah, I've got a whole roll of krugerrands here would you like to buy, I
just made them last night.

B.58:  [Laughter].   

A.59:  Here's a nice, uh, twenty-dollar gold eagle, uh, just, just manufactured in
Lebanon last year [laughter].

B.60:  [Laughter] Wa-, was the gold worth, I mean, was it really gold?

A.61:  Yeah, that, they, they are gold.  They're just, of course, the, the
twenty-dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value.

B.62:  Right.   

A.63:  And amazingly enough your, your into, Middle Eastern sort of coins.  The,
the largest amount of fakes of U. S. gold is made in Lebanon.

B.64:  Oh, really?   

A.65:  Yeah.   

B.66:  Is that, uh, still true?   

A.67:  Yeah, still is.   

B.68:  Wow.   

A.69:  Yeah, that's sort of like a cottage indust-, industry over there.

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  Um, and, and there's some very specific things you can find.  You can even
narrow it down to where it was made.  I mean people are so aware of these
things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be an
a real one and, uh, you, you can almost tell the area, somebody,

B.72:  You mean ma-,

A.73:  probably even knows the guy who made them.   

B.74:  Oh.  I suppose he, he has to protect himself too so that somebody can't
say, you know, when he's selling them that somebody else made it.  I mean
it's, so that he gets his own profits.

A.75:  Yeah, well the,  

B.76:  [Laughter].   

A.77:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not
to fall for that gimmick but I, I have seen a few of them sell these things.

B.78:  Huh.   

A.79:  And, of course, you have to, you have to be able to prove they, they knew
it was counterfeit, and that's always very difficult.

B.80:  Oh, I see, otherwise the, the buyer is respond-, 

A.81:  Well, he can, he can usually go back to the dealer, but if, if it's an
unscrupulous dealer he'll just say, hey, you know, you, you had an opportunity
to see it, you know, it's yours.

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  Of course, you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd
have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't, fraud is very difficult to
prove.

B.84:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.85:  Because you have to, you have to show that they knowingly did it.

B.86:  Right.   

A.87:  And that's, all he's got to say is well, in my, in my professional judgment
it was a, it was a real coin.

B.88:  Uh-huh.   

A.89:  So, you know, it's his word against mine [laughter]. 

B.90:  Right, right.   

A.91:  That's one of the reasons I got out of the business.  There were too many
shenanigans going on.

B.92:  Oh, that's interesting because I'm more interested in the research and I'm
going some ((dye link analyses)) of, of these early coins from the six and
seven hundreds.  And, and so, I'm not into that, the buying and selling
business.

A.93:  Uh-huh.   

B.94:  Um, it sounds like I'm wise [laughter].   

A.95:  [Laughter] Yes.  Yeah, nowadays the, the, the way the, uh, the market is
and the, and the way the, uh, grading systems have changed over the last few
years that's primarily what got me out of it.  They, they kept changing the
grading systems on coins and, you know, you go out and buy a very nice
silver dollar collection, and you've graded it at the current grade, and then
the next year they've changed the grading system, and now these things are
worth a fourth of what you paid for them.  You know, it's just,

B.96:  Oh.   

A.97:  it just go-, it just got ludicrous after a while.   

B.98:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.99:  Uh, what the, the standards for, for an uncirculated silver dollar changed
so many times in three years, and a lot of people lost lots of money on that,
of course, the, the persistent dealers will just sit there, if they graded
them as M S sixty-five, then by golly, they're M S sixty-five, I don't care
what you say.

B.100:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.101:  And they'll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them.

B.102:  Right.   

A.103:  At inflated prices [laughter]. 

B.104:  Uh-huh.  I think that's, that's the, the hardest thing is that people who
don't really know feel sometimes a,

A.105:  [Throat_clearing].   

B.106:  for example, I know, um, you know, the ancients better but because it's
old they figure it's got to cost, you know, thousands of dollars.

A.107:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's r-, it's silly, I mean, I, I, I used to have
people walk into my shop with, um, Indian head pennies, you know.

B.108:  Uh-huh.   

A.109:  And they say, wow, you know, this is really old.  Yeah, well, it's not
worth anything [laughter].

B.110:  Oh.   

A.111:  I'll give you a nickel for it, you know [laughter].   

B.112:  [Laughter] Right.  Right.   

A.113:  And e-, even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even
seen like, uh, like two-cent pieces and things like that.  Those are not,
those are not even expensive, I mean, you can pick up very nice ones for
eight, nine dollars.

B.114:  Oh, really?   

A.115:  Oh, yeah,   

B.116:  I didn't know that.   

A.117:  yeah, they're cheap.  They're super cheap.  Um,  

B.118:  Oh that,   

A.119:  I-, several, I mean, i-, it's funny the way the business works because
there are so many things that are enormously out priced.

B.120:  Uh-huh.   

A.121:  Um, some, some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them
are, are worth hundreds of dollars.  You know, and, and the coins themselves
aren't worth very much at all,

B.122:  Uh-huh.   

A.123:  face value basically.  Uh, and then, of course, the silver coins are more
and more being traded for bullion then anything else.

B.124:  Uh-huh.   

A.125:  Uh, you can, you can buy bags of silver coins, a, a bag has a thousand
dollars face value in it and it's traded for silver.

B.126:  Oh.   

A.127:  Yeah.    

B.128:  So, basically if, if someone isn't really interested in the coins it's not
some, an investment?

A.129:  No, it's, it's more of a, uh, it's a commodity purchase really.

B.130:  Uh-huh.   

A.131:  Uh, it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do
find some, some, uh, nice coins, I mean, people who are starting out
collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of
them with these, uh, with these bags.

B.132:  Uh-huh.   

A.133:  Uh, especially you want to get a mixed bag, of course, dimes, quarters and
halves.

B.134:  Uh-huh.   

A.135:  Uh, but you could fill a whole bunch of, uh, holes with these things.  I
used to, I used to advertise buying wheat pennies.  Um, I'd give a dollar a
roll, which two cents apiece which is basically overpriced.

B.136:  Uh-huh.   

A.137:  Um, but I used to go throu-, I, I'd get loads and loads of these things.  I
ended up one time with about, uh, about twelve bags of these things.  And I'd
gone through all of them and I found a couple of them.  I found nineteen O
nine ((V D B)),

B.138:  Oh.   

A.139:  and I, um, a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce.  I found several
good ones out of there.

B.140:  Uh-huh.   

A.141:  People giving it to me for two cents.  I, uh, that's okay. 

B.142:  Right.  

A.143: Turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars [laughter].
