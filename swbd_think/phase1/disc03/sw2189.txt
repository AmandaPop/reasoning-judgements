REMARKS:        There was some background noise on Speaker B.  I also had 
some cutting out on the third conversation with Speaker B. 

==========================================================================

B.1:  Oh, no, I hadn't heard about Bo Jackson though.  What happened?

A.2:  Well, Bo was, uh, playing football actually, you know, he plays both
football and bas-, and,

B.3:  Yeah.

A.4:  baseball and he was playing, 

B.5:  Plays for the Raiders.

A.6:  and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or, you know,
injuring his hip, and there's been arthritis and he's been out for a number
of, of seas-, games and it, just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals
put him up on waivers made him a free agent.  So, they're saying now that Bo
knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury.

B.7:  Uh, I didn't know that.   

A.8:  So, they had, uh, they're having actually a special on today and they were
mentioning that, and even though Kansas City may have dropped him, some other
teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike, uh, the ((Athletics))
Shoe Company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer
sponsors [noise],

B.9:  Well, 

A.10:  and ((since)) that makes him more money anyhow [laughter].

B.11:  Yeah, it does.  He has more money out of the, uh, ads than he does the game
itself.

A.12:  Yeah, he does it, it's pretty amazing though how much ((he)) can get for
endorsements anymore.

B.13:  I, well, I think, uh, Joe Montana got something like a million dollars for
saying I'm going to Disneyland.

A.14:  I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever.  On the same program they had Michael
Jordan, they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing
with the Chicago Bulls, about, I think, two million dollars for endorsing
McDonalds, and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike.  And
then, of course,

B.15:  Outrageous prices.   

A.16:  he's got, uh, Wheaties also.   

B.17:  Yeah.   

A.18:  And that's, that's in a year.  That's, uh, what would you do with all that
money?

B.19:  Uh, I wouldn't know what to do with it.   

A.20:  [Laughter].   

B.21:  We're just discussing what we'd do with five thousand.   

A.22:  [Laughter] Yeah, I could make that go a lot of places [laughter].  It's
amazing anymore there's a, also a program on this evening about the, a very
sports intensive evening it seems to be on T V, about the business of college
athletics.

B.23:  Uh, the, uh, achievement for the, let's see, how are they putting that, uh,
the school, let's see, the academic rebuild board, review board, uh, the
dean's being it, more involved with the athletes.

A.24:  Uh-huh.   

B.25:  Yeah, I was watching that.   

A.26:  Yeah ((it)), it talked about all S M U and their, the death penalty and
how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and, and things of
that nature.  I guess anymore it's just a big business.

B.27:  Yeah, well, uh, some of, for most of the people I guess it is.  But some of
them though they do it just for the love of it.

A.28:  Uh-huh.   

B.29:  Uh, 

A.30:  I think it al-, probably also is more as you get into the, the big schools
the ones that the T V -s are going to cover and things anyhow when you start at
the, the lower side or the smaller schools are all doing it just for the, for
the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone.

B.31:  Well, that's not necessarily true though.  You know, uh, I'm an avid, uh,
basketball fan of the ((Bulls)),

A.32:  Uh-huh.   

B.33:  and I know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits,

A.34:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.35:  you know, and so, you know, he's doing it because he wants to.

A.36:  They actually mentioned a little on the fact that he's, started the ((N C A
A)) program where he's actually, not necessary to say he's getting around the
rules somewhat, but it's actually, sounds like a pretty good idea where he
goes out and recruits other students who don't meet the minimum academic
requirements to get into the college and, and then qualify for a student
athlete position.  And he takes them and signs some contract or something with
them but sends them then, then to junior college.

B.37:  Yeah, I heard about that.  I haven't heard much about it though.

A.38:  So, at least that's, uh, some way that they're, you know, I, I guess the
best part about it you can't just drop a whole ((scol-,)) scholarships because
it does, I would imagine, at least in it's intentions, help a lot of people
who couldn't afford to go to school.

B.39:  Yeah.   

A.40:  But that seemed like it was actually, uh, you know, if there's a good way
to get around it, well, that sounded like it was a pretty smart way.

B.41:  You know, yeah, I don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though
[laughter].

A.42:  Well, at least it's hopefully still helping the,  

B.43:  Yeah, 

A.44:  the student.   

B.45:  yeah, it's helping the kids.   

A.46:  Your not, uh, going to graduate somebody who still can't read and write.

B.47:  Uh, that's happened too much.   

A.48:  Uh, way too much.  Yes, it has.   

@@B.49:  Yeah, well, we veered from the subject.   

A.50:  [Laughter] Yeah, but that's quite all right, I think.  They just want to
have some kind of normal conversation.

B.51:  I hope so.   

A.52:  [Laughter].    

B.53:  That has happened to me more than once.   

A.54:  Has it?   

B.55:  Yeah, almost all the time.   

A.56:  Really?  Well this has been, uh, actually some pretty interesting,
interesting topics that I've had, I've had things from, uh, tax reform to
baseball, to fishing.  Those are the three I've participated in.

B.57:  I haven't had anything on fishing.  I've had, uh, oh, arts and crafts,

A.58:  Uh-huh.   

B.59:  uh, football, basketball, and baseball.   

A.60:  Well, heck you, 

B.61:  Child rearing, or child day care,  

A.62:  Uh-huh. 

B.63:  and couple other things I can't remember.   

A.64:  Well, sounds like you participated quite a bit.

B.65:  Yeah, well, almost everyday the (( )) the lines are open.  

A.66:  Uh-huh.  Do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split?

B.67:  Uh, half-and-half.   

A.68:  Is the?  Well, that's good.   

B.69:  So, you know, I, I had to start out doing it, I done it about five times,
and then, uh, here lately they, I've been letting them catch me.

A.70:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's good.  Well, it's been enjoyable speaking with you.

B.71:  All right, well, you take it easy.   

A.72:  All righty.  Good-bye.   

B.73:  Bye.
