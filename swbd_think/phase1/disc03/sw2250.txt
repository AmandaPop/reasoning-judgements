@A.1:  So, what kind of benefits do you have in your job that you think is, uh,
very important?

B.2:  Health care.   

A.3:  Health care?   

B.4:  Number one.   

A.5:  Like dental?   

B.6:  Dental and medical, yes.   

A.7:  (( )).  

B.8:  Yes.  I'm unfortunate in that I was able to take early retirement from my
company last year.  And being able to do that I was able to keep my, uh,
health insurance that the company pays for,

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  which and I had to pick up my own life insurance.  And my wife, who works
at the same company, was able to add me to, to the, uh, dental insurance.

A.11:  Right.   

B.12:  So, I was really unfortunate.  I really was.   

A.13:  So, just this, so you think that the, a good company will provide good
health?

B.14:  I think they will as long as they can, but the problem obviously is the
cost of health care.

A.15:  Right.   

B.16:  As you know, it's just going completely out of sight.   

A.17:  I hear that's like one of the major, uh, the major costs to com-, to
corporations nowadays.

B.18:  It is very much so, it's a billion dollar problem, you know, every year.
Uh, our company had, it doesn't apply to me thank goodness, it applies to, you
know, to the younger,

A.19:  Uh-huh.   

B.20:  employees, that they're having to pick up, you know, more of the, uh,
health insurance cost, you know, themselves, the deductibles are going up,

A.21:  Right.   

B.22:  and the (( )) payments are going up, and I'm concerned that's just, you
know, the beginning of it.

A.23:  See, the problem I have with it is that I don't have a job. 

B.24:  Oh, yeah.   

A.25:  So, I don't have [laughter],  

B.26:  That's a problem too, yeah.  

A.27:  and I'm still in, in school.   

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  I'm still in college.   

B.30:  Right.   

A.31:  And so I don't, I don't know firsthand, 

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  of these benefits.   

B.34:  Right.   

A.35:  But I, I do agree with you that health, health insurance is one of the
major ones.

B.36:  Oh I,

A.37:  I don't know about dental, I mean, dental is, is kind of like, uh, you
know, you're asking for a little too much.

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  To, for me, I think it's like, uh, you know, you're, you're expecting too
much from a company.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  If something happens, it happens and they'll pay you for it,

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  but to actually have, you know, big coverage,  

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  for something like that,

B.46:  Well, actually, excuse me, our dental insurance, you know, it's, it's good.
It's certainly better than nothing.  It's not, you know, it's not the super
you, for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you
probably don't have it, you know, I do have some dental problems and it's
very,

A.47:  Right, I'm only twenty-one.   

B.48:  very expensive.  And if your blessed with, you know, good dental, uh,
situation you are extremely lucky.

A.49:  Uh-huh.   

B.50:  You really are.  I've had a lot of problems, I still have some ongoing
problems.  Mainly because back when I was growing up, you know, we didn't know
about fluoride,

A.51:  Right.   

B.52:  and I was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma.  You only went to the
dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt.

A.53:  Exactly.  Yeah.   

B.54:  There was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then.  So, the younger
people, you know, are, are really, uh, really in better shape than, than
people of my generation or for the most part.

A.55:  Uh-huh.   

B.56:  But, uh, dental insurance is important to me.  It is not as important as,
uh, as health insurance, you know,

A.57:  As health.   

B.58:  if I had to rank them.   

A.59:  Right.  So, for a health insurance, what do you think would be a, uh, a
good health insurance with a, a low deductible and a high premium, or do you
prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible?

B.60:  Oh, gosh.  That's, that's the general, you know, y-, you know, you almost
need to know the family situation, you know, and, you know, number of kids
fortunately I have two children and they're both grown and (( )) you know,
under their own plans so I don't, I don't have medical, you know, expenses for
them per se.  Uh, I guess if I had to choose I would be willing to pay more,
you know, to get, to get better coverage.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  I guess,  

B.62:  Now we,

A.63:  it also depends on how, how many times you're going to use it.

B.64:  That's right.  That's right.  And also we, I say we, uh, I'm retired from
Texas Instruments and they're just, they're like most everybody, you can't
just, you know, drop into a hospital and demand, you know, a thousand dollars
worth of tests, you know, or you think you need to be hospitalized, but
there's only a certain, I mean, you can go anywhere you want to go, but
there's only approved, uh, health care centers, you know, that, uh, that they
will pay, you know, the maximum ((amount)).

A.65:  Right.   

B.66:  If you choose to go, you know, you pick up the difference.  According to
the emergency, it doesn't make any difference you can, you know you can go
wherever you need to go.

A.67:  Right.  So,

B.68:  Also they were doing, for a long time they were doing, the company was
paying for second opinions,

A.69:  Uh-huh.   

B.70:  to doctors, but they have since dropped that I guess it got to be, you
know, not cost effective.

A.71:  Too expensive, more expensive for them to do that and,

B.72:  Right.  So, they have dropped the, uh, second opinion type thing.  But
before you, uh, allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital, you really,
there's a telephone number that you have to call, you know, and they will tell
you exactly, you know, what they will pay for it.

A.73:  Uh-huh.   

B.74:  And if you,

A.75:  So, th-, that's pretty good.   

B.76:  Yeah, if you want to, so, at least you, you know you wouldn't have any
surprises you can order any type of, you know, service you want but you stand
a good chance, you know, having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  So, the, so, I guess that, if, when I get a job and I, and I look
into the health insurance,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  that they're going to pay for then I should really look really, really
deep into the policy.

B.80:  Absolutely.  You need about even probably,

A.81:  The very first thing I, I should look at, huh?   

B.82:  Absolutely.  Do you have a family?   

A.83:  No, not yet.   

B.84:  I see.  Well, it will become even more important, you know, when and if you
do.

A.85:  Uh-huh.    

B.86:  But I would really check that out, because I'm concerned in coming years
it's going to be, you know, just a horrendous burden to, especially the
younger folks.

A.87:  What I'm really scared about and, you know, I'm, I don't know firsthand but
I, it seems to me that, like you were saying earlier, that the deductibles are
getting bigger and bigger,

B.88:  Uh-huh, right. 

A.89:  and that's scary because, you know, in the end you're getting insurance
for basically nothing.

B.90:  That's right.   

A.91:  I mean, something really, really, really serious has happened for you,

B.92:  {Very faint} Uh-huh. 

A.93:  you know, to make it worthwhile.   

B.94:  Right.   

A.95:  And then that, that, that, that defeats the purpose, 

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  of insurance.   

B.98:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Um, you know, some companies can, can't even
afford any longer, you know, to carry the insurance.  They're just dropping it
(( )) they don't have any choice.  It's bankrupting them.

A.99:  Yeah.   

B.100:  But I'm, I am and very fortunate in that I was able to retire, you know,
with, with health benefits.

A.101:  Yeah, that sounds like a big, big asset, 

B.102:  Oh, absolutely. 

A.103:  to do that. 

@@B.104:  Absolutely.   

A.105:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.   

B.106:  Same to you.   

A.107:  I guess I'll, uh, maybe see you again sometime.   

B.108:  Okay.  You take care of yourself.  Good luck to you.   

A.109:  You too.   

B.110:  Thank you.   

A.111:  Bye.    

B.112:  Bye-bye.
