============================================================================

@A.1:  All right, well what do you think about women's role's in the last
generation?  What, uh, what changes have you seen?

B.2:  Well, I, I have noticed a lot, uh, more women's roles at work, which I
like, in management, which that's good.  I, I guess to have a woman's
[breathing] viewpoints.  And uh, in a way things are handled at work,
especially in personnel type jobs which I think is probably better on the hand
of women for, uh, any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that.
[talking] Women probably understand that better than the men do.

A.3:  Oh, yeah.   

B.4:  So I think that's good.   

A.5:  Yeah, I would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than
men [laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

A.7:  We only have to get up, you know, for the daytime feedings. 

B.8:  [Laughter] So I think that, that's a good benefit, I think, having women,
uh, in, in higher up positions, stuff like that.

A.9:  Well, I've noticed that it seems that some women are, I guess what I call
the feminists,

B.10:  [Laughter].   

A.11:  you know, or you know, very strong --  

B.12:  Uh-huh.   

A.13:  -- uh, you know women's libbers --  

B.14:  Yeah.   

A.15:  -- and others that don't want to be.   

B.16:  Right.   

A.17:  And it's, it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which.

B.18:  And how to treat them [laughter].   

A.19:  Yeah, you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs, you know. 

B.20:  Right, right.  And who wants to be treated which way.   

A.21:  I think they should all wear signs.   

B.22:  [Laughter].   

A.23:  You know, or something. 

B.24:  [Talking] [Speaker whispers to someone in the room] Yeah. 

A.25:  But, uh, I, I found it interesting especially, uh, being from a military
background, the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not.

B.26:  Right, I thought that was really interesting in the war.  I figure,

A.27:  I can't figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go.   

B.28:  Right.   

A.29:  If you can stay out of it, although I guess, although I did notice that all
the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and
fat to go.

B.30:  [Laughter] They couldn't do anything about it.   

A.31:  Now, it's kind of like when the men do, you, course you, you, used to
saying used to be the old men declare the war, the young men fight it.

B.32:  Right, right.   

A.33:  And now, and now it's, it's, I'm happy to see that the women have the same
problem that the men has had,

B.34:  [Laughter].  

A.35:  because they got the old fat women, yell-, yeah they ought to fight, but
course they don't have to go.

B.36:  That's exactly right.  They can just watch it.   

A.37:  I always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over
to the Gulf and let her fight.  But,

B.38:  I think it's, uh, I think if they want to do it, you know, if that's what
interests them and they think, you know, they can handle it, I think they
ought to be able to do it.

A.39:  Well, they couldn't be worse than some of the men.   

B.40:  That's right, you know,

A.41:  I think it all depends on mental set more than sex.   

B.42:  Right.  That's exactly right.  Now they're trained and everything so
[breathing], let them do it if they want to.  That's what, that's the way it
is in a lot of jobs, you know, like the firemen, you know, for a long time
they thought stuff like that, you know, trying to be firemen, policemen and
stuff like that, and now if they get to be all that,

A.43:  Well, I think if, you know, regardless of sex, whether you can, if you can
handle the job, then I think you should be able to do it.

B.44:  Right.   

A.45:  But I do object to, you know, someone hiring a woman just because they have
to meet their quota.

B.46:  That's exact-, and I feel the sa-, exact same way.   

A.47:  That's,   

B.48:  That's right.   

A.49:  that's really just kind of discrimination no matter how, any way you put
it.

B.50:  Right.   

A.51:  You know. 

B.52:  You're, uh, you know, it's the best person qualified I think and, and
that's the way it ought to be, but it's, as we know, it's not,

A.53:  Yeah, I, I stutter to think that I may be flying in a seven forty-seven
with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the
right, you know, the right sex,

B.54:  Right. 

A.55:  rather than qualifications.  

B.56:  Exactly, same with a doctor [laughter].   

A.57:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.58:  in a hospital [laughter].   

A.59:  Hate to, hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical
school simply because she happened to be a female.

B.60:  That's right.   

A.61:  You know.  

B.62:  #She got that scholarship.#  

A.63:  #Or a black woman named# Rodriguez.   

B.64:  Right, they need to give the scholarship to a ((w-,)), that's true, that's
true with any case.  I hate that, but, but that is true but, 

A.65:  Well, I think we, that society tends to overcompensate --  

B.66:  Right.   

A.67:  -- much with, whatever it's with the, the black problem, or whatever that
may be now.

B.68:  It's, yeah, eth-, any ethnic problem or race.  

A.69:  Or with anyth-, ethnic problems, uh, I think so-, society tends to
overcompensate and we g-, we s-, we swing out to the far left and far right
trying to get everybody in.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  Don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, 

A.71:  Oh, that's true. 

B.72:  and get everybody covered.   

A.73:  Oh, yeah, God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say,
you know, hey, sweetie or something.

B.74:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And now everything's his, you know, uh, his and her, and
everyth-.  You have to, you always have to say it like that, you can never say
you know, his, you know, and that never has offended me when, you know, when
someone's talking and they say, you know, his job or something like that or,

A.75:  Right.   

B.76:  That's never,

A.77:  A wait person.  

B.78:  I mean I understand that they're talking about the job [laughter] not the
person in the job.  That's, that's always, that's always been strange I
thought, but [breathing] some women like to fight it.  But,

A.79:  What do you think about, uh, about our new governor, since she happens to
be a female?

B.80:  Yeah, she, she, uh {whispering}, I, I don't know, I, I can't say that, that
I, well I can't say that I did or didn't vote for her because I didn't get to
vote this time, but I don't know that I'm, I guess I'm ready.  Just hard to
see a woman in such a, I guess powerful position.

A.81:  I think I'm more scared of her not because she's a female but bec-, more
for her, p-, political beliefs and what she says she's going to do.

B.82:  Right, right.  

A.83:  I think I'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position.

B.84:  Right [talking].   

A.85:  Although you see more and more, uh, more and more of the ladies that are
becoming active in politics.

B.86:  I kn-, that's true and,   

A.87:  And, you know, occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the
business sector.

B.88:  Right.  Inexperience also, that's something that bothers me is, uh, you
know, she is, you know, the treasurer forever, it bothers me that, I don't
know, that she doesn't have that much background I guess in, well, it's hard
to say.  I don't know, something about it just, just kind of bothers me.

A.89:  I think her background totally bothers me.   

B.90:  [Laughter] Yeah, she, I mean, she seems on the outside, uh, good and
everything, but, but I don't know it just, it just kind of bothers me and
that, that just may be because we're not used to having, I'm not used to
having women in, in roles like that, you know, as role models.

A.91:  That could be, yeah.   

B.92:  You're just always used to men, I mean that's just something that men
always did.

A.93:  Yeah, the governor was, you know, the governor, he did this,

B.94:  Right.   

A.95:  And now we got the governor, she's going to do that.   

B.96:  That's exactly right.  And,  

A.97:  I wonder what they call her, if she was married, I wonder if they would
refer to him as the first husband?

B.98:  [Laughter] probably, yeah, and in Dallas, you know, we had the, uh, Annette
Strauss and she's a, uh, first woman mayor so.

A.99:  Yeah, Houston got a female mayor.   

B.100:  Do they?   

A.101:  Yeah.   

B.102:  I didn't know that {whispering}.   

A.103:  She, oh, yeah, she's a, she's a staunch supporter of all the, uh, gay
rights.  Matter fact, she lives down the gay district.

B.104:  Oh, does she really? {whispering}.  

A.105:  Oh, yeah.   

B.106:  Oh, Lord.   

A.107:  So I think, you know, I'm not sure whether she was elected because she was
a female,

B.108:  [Laughter]. 

A.109:  or be-, or because she supported the gays.  I really don't know because a
large, you know,

B.110:  [Laughter] big combination of both.  

A.111:  there's a large population down there of gays.

B.112:  She's got,  

A.113:  Yeah. 

B.114:  covered all the bases didn't she?   

A.115:  Yeah, she seems to be interesting.  I, I, and you see more and more, uh,
you know, uh, Mickey Leland's wife is,

B.116:  Yeah.   

A.117:  taking over his seat.  And,  

B.118:  Right.   

A.119:  course you know we got the, like you said they elected a female mayor in
Dallas, one in Houston, we got a female governor and there's two or three more
governors in, in the, in the, states that are females.

B.120:  That's really good, I guess.   

A.121:  And there's quite a few, if they can do the job, I think more power to
them.

B.122:  Right.   

A.123:  You know, I would, I, I, I would dearly love to find out, you know, I
could, I could say well, I guess I was wrong about Ann Richards.

B.124:  Yeah, yeah.  They alway-, they, they say a lot of times that, you know,
woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that,
so that ((side would)) be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play
into it.  Because a lot of times, you know, you do look at the men and they
never seem to show any emotion, [breathing] they just,

A.125:  Yeah, but I think we're bred that way.   

B.126:  Yeah,   

A.127:  You know, I think that's,  

B.128:  exactly, and that's,   

A.129:  I think that's part of the, of, of, of the male mystique.  

B.130:  That's sad to say,  

A.131:  And, uh,

B.132:  that, that, that that's true, though.   

A.133:  Course the reason, y-, I think it's going to be harder for, for females in
the next ten years or so to make strides in, say, you know, the Southwest and
Midwest,

B.134:  Uh-huh.   

A.135:  and, you know, down here in the southern states than it will be up in the
more liberal east and west coast.

B.136:  Right, right. 

A.137:  Because, you know, 

B.138:  I am surprised, though, that we do have so many that are in politics down
here.

A.139:  We don't have quite as many as they do east and west coast, but this is
kind of the last bastion of the, you know, the,

B.140:  Yeah.   

A.141:  the good old boys,  

B.142:  Yeah.   

A.143:  with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your,
down between your legs driving down the road.

B.144:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.145:  And, of course, that's changing, too, but, you know, I think and that came
about because of the women, you know, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

B.146:  That's right.   

A.147:  MADD. 

B.148:  That was a good, that was a good leadership that women,

A.149:  The greatest force in America is mothers.   

B.150:  That's what they say, that's true.   

A.151:  If you could mobilize the mothers you got them.   

B.152:  [Laughter]  It's true.   

A.153:  Yeah {faint}. 

B.154:  Well, I hope, you know, that they [breathing] whatever these leaders of
ours do, that everything's for the good.  That just, like, like you said, it's
with man or a woman it sh-, however they're going to be able to take care of
us and, I don't know,

A.155:  Just depends on who's going to exploit us when.   

B.156:  Yeah, I do know, though, in our company, we don't have a lot of upper,
upper management, w-, I mean, we rarely have any women that are upper
management.

A.157:  Is that because they're just not, uh, you just don't have any women that
are there, or,

B.158:  I don't know.   

A.159:  no one has ascended to that level yet?   

B.160:  I don't know.  That's really, that's really, well, it's, it's so, uh, I
guess we're, we're kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of, men always did
the, you know, the engineering and all this, and the technology and men are,
so I'm, I'm sure that's has a lot to do with it.  But,

A.161:  I've noticed that in a lot of companies that, you know, everybody says,
well there's no women in upper management and my first question, well, is
there anyone qualified to be there.

B.162:  Right, right.  

A.163:  Just because you happen to be a, a female or a minority or anything else,
doesn't automatically mean y-, it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that
part.

B.164:  That's right.  That's exactly right.  So, but a lot of more women are
starting their own businesses I've noticed than,

A.165:  Yeah.   

B.166:  And that's, that's pretty interesting.   

A.167:  We have several here in Austin that have, uh, I guess, started up.  One of
them, matter fact, runs a furniture, uh, place.  She builds library furniture.

B.168:  Oh, does she?  {whispering}.  

A.169:  And she,   

B.170:  That's pretty interesting.   

A.171:  and she's t-, she's taking over, and it's, uh, it's, it's a million dollar
a year company and she's having a ball doing it.

B.172:  Yeah, there's a lady here in, uh, Dallas who started a mozzar-, or a cheese
company.  Can't remember the name of it, and she's a multimillion-, n-, naire
from it.

A.173:  Yeah {faint}. 

B.174:  And I, I just think God, if only it could be me [laughter].

A.175:  Yeah.  I've got several, uh, matter fact, I have some friends who own
machine shops, and they have several ...
