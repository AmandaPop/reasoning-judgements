=============================================================================

A.1:  The home that, uh, we bought, back in the early eighties was, uh, typical
tract home and we were, uh, trying to find something that would, would get us
into the housing market as it were, thinking that someday we'd move on.

B.2:  Uh-huh.   

A.3:  Uh, the economy, however, changed that a little bit and looks like we're
going to be in this home for a while,

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  but, uh, it's not too bad.  Some of the things that we didn't, uh, think
about when we bought, it turned out, uh, worked out all right for us was we
bought on a top of a hill and some of our neighbors down the lower part, uh,
get their yards flooded every once in a while.  Doesn't get up into the house,

B.6:  Uh.   

A.7:  but it just makes a bit of a mess in the, in the yard itself,

B.8:  Yeah.   

A.9:  a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the, on the, uh,
grass area, it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and I'd never
really thought about that, but, but we're pretty much at the very top of this
little hill and all the runoff from, from the concrete, uh, the shopping
center near us, and the alleyway, all that goes down to our neighbors, so,

B.10:  Yeah.   

A.11:  so that was a little thing that I'd never really considered and was
fortunate that it worked out that way.  Uh, another, uh, calamity, I guess,
that befalls some purchasers that I, uh, didn't think about when I first
purchased this house was, what can happen r-, immediately behind you.  We are
on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us
from the rest of the, from a street and a little, little, uh, business area
and, uh, some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later
a, a, uh, shopping center built up behind them,

B.12:  Oh.   

A.13:  and it was a grocery store that had, that stocked at night.  About three
a m,

B.14:  Oh, no.   

A.15:  every night they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it
would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move,
but they couldn't stand that noise.  Then oddly enough, after that, they, uh,
uh, it closed down.  That grocery store isn't there, and hasn't been there for
about six years now, so, uh, it's kind of a, a bad thing to happen, but, we
happen to have landed, again, in a very lucky spot.  There is a little
business development behind us that's a bit of a, a, a little bank and a
couple of dry cleaning things and little strip shopping center, but it's
several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little
wall is a triangle shape and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to
do anything more than put some grass and trees there.

B.16:  Oh, good.   

A.17:  There's not even a parking lot so, it, it's a nice, uh, two or three houses
on either side of us is nice grass and trees and, and then across from that is
a, a major four lane street and then across from that is, is, uh, the parks of
the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and
that completely goes on to the horizon.  So, as far as we can look out over
our little retaining wall, is grass and trees and parks.

B.18:  Oh, that's really nice.   

A.19:  And we really didn't, didn't, uh, I mean that wasn't our consideration.
When we bought it, it was a complete blank lot.  They hadn't even built the
house yet, and we were new to the, this whole process and all we knew is that
it was a, the cheapest house that this, this tract development, uh, sold.  So
it turned out to be pretty good [breathing] and,

B.20:  Where do you, what area do you live in?   

A.21:  Dallas.   

B.22:  Oh, okay.  I live in Dal-, uh, Rowlett.   

A.23:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's a nice area as it were.  About the only two things
that, uh, didn't work out too well for us, well, one of them's nice in, in a
way.  We're on the beginning of a corner.  We live on a, on a U-shaped drive
and we're the first house that they actually started turning to make for a
turn on a, on a cul-de-, not a cul-de-sac, but a turn on a,

B.24:  Uh-huh.   

A.25:  ninety degree turn on the street, which meant that we're not jammed right
up against our neighbor's house.

B.26:  Oh, that's really nice.   

A.27:  There's, there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side, but on the other
side there's over sixty feet before the next house because they, they set us
back a little ways and they turned it sideways so our houses begin to, to turn
to, to make this turn as it were, so we're real far away and we have a really
large lot.  We have a bigger lot than all the rest of the, the ones down the
street.  But, uh, as it turned out, we decided, we learned that neither one of
us really likes taking care of all that grass, so,

B.28:  Oh [laughter].   

A.29:  it was a bit of a drawback, but, uh, it'll probably make for a good
selling point if we ever get someone that does like all that grass.

B.30:  Yeah, it probably will.   

A.31:  And, uh, uh, we did also end up in a, in an area that we didn't, we didn't
realize when we bought it that, uh, the soil is that, uh, black clay and it --

B.32:  Yeah, we have that.   

A.33:  -- it tends to, uh, uh, go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and
it, it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that, uh, most of these
houses get no matter how much watering we do.

B.34:  Uh-huh.   

A.35:  So, we have to contend with doors that sometimes, sometimes during the year
don't, uh, close just right and, uh, things of that nature.

B.36:  Right.  I guess that's just Texas though, you [laughter] have to live with
that.

A.37:  Yeah, that's true.  There are, there is a little, little segment up near
McKinney and up near, uh, [lipsmack], uh, they said out near Wylie there's
some, some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it, it,
uh, goes back into the black gumbo around it.

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  But, there are some housing developments that, uh, the guy that came out
and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little, little pockets
of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all, and had I only known
[laughter], maybe I'd have looked over there.

B.40:  [Laughter] Really.   

A.41:  Uh, what about your house?   

B.42:  Well, we bought, uh, our first house at the end of eighty-six and, like I
said, it's out in Rowlett.  And it's, it's real nice, it's four bedroom and
it's kind of a tract area, too.  We've got people behind us and on both sides
of us.  I don't really like that too well.  I keep telling my husband that our
next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land
[laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  But, uh, it's a, it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and
grow in for quite a while I guess.  Uh, hopefully till the real estate market
turns around.  Like you, we, we bought when it was down a little bit, but
we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that, we couldn't sell for
anywhere near what we've got into it so, 

A.45:  Uh-huh.   

B.46:  It, uh, hopefully it'll turn around.   

A.47:  It's true.   

B.48:  Sometime. 

A.49:  That, there's always that chance I guess [laughter]. 

B.50:  Yeah, oh, I think it will eventually.  Out here they're building more new
houses all the time, though.  And people can go and buy a brand new one that's
never been lived in for less than they can get a used one.  So I guess that's
what they would choose.

A.51:  Huh.   

B.52:  But there, uh, w-, as a first time home buyer I know what you mean.
There's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for.

A.53:  Uh-huh.   

B.54:  The only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking
between the double panes --

A.55:  Uh-huh.   

B.56:  -- and wa-, moisture gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now,
they've got so much.  And the builder's gone bankrupt and the glass company's
gone bankrupt, so --

A.57:  Uh-huh.   

B.58:  -- we don't really have any recourse,

A.59:  Nothing you can do.   

B.60:  and just hope they break or something [laughter].   

A.61:  That's right.  There's nothing you can do.   

B.62:  Yeah.   

A.63:  Yeah, we've got  [throat_clearing],

B.64:  But, other than that, we haven't had any problems.  

A.65:  We've got one that's done that.  We've been pretty fortunate.  Most of our
neighbors have had many more.  Uh, I don't know that we've done anything
different to prevent ours from doing that, but most of our neighbors have
ended up replacing them, uh, buying some nice Anderson windows or some, some,
uh, name brand windows.  Uh, one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs,
and they have the, uh, different kind of window that, the kind that you can
tilt out either pane and --

B.66:  Oh, uh-huh.   

A.67:  -- and raise or lower, you know, lower the top down or the bottom up or
tilt it in, both of them tilt in so you can clean them or, and it's a real
strange mechanical beast,

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  but, uh, they haven't lost their seal yet, so it's, I guess there's a
qual-, some quality in it.

B.70:  Yeah.   

A.71:  So,

B.72:  We had a, our insurance, our home owner's insurance actually covered some
of it because I told them it looks like something is eating into the glass.
It turns like a milky white, you know,

A.73:  Uh-huh.   

B.74:  so I said, well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or
something that's eating into that, which would be covered under a glass rider,
so they replaced like seven of them and we just had to pay the deductible, but
--

A.75:  Huh.   

B.76:  -- they wouldn't, that insurance company went out of business in Texas
because they had so many claims --

A.77:  Goodness.   

B.78:  -- that they couldn't make a profit and so, now none of the other insurance
companies will, will consider covering that.

A.79:  Yeah that's,

B.80:  Which I can understand.  It's really not --  

A.81:  That would be hard to,  

B.82:  -- damage. 

A.83:  hard to cover all the ones that go bad.   

B.84:  Oh, yeah.   

A.85:  It's true.   

B.86:  But I bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad.  

A.87:  Goodness.   

B.88:  Just about every window in our house I guess eventually is going to have to
be replaced.

A.89:  Yeah and it would be nice to do it with, with all the same kind, too
[laughter].

B.90:  Yeah, well what they did is just, they came in and just cut the glass out
of the frame and put more glass in.

A.91:  Huh.   

B.92:  That's over a year ago and it's, it hasn't had any problems.

A.93:  And those held?   

B.94:  Yeah, seemed to.   

A.95:  That's interesting.  I didn't know they could do that.   

B.96:  Somebody told me that they thought that, too, was caused by just a little
bit of shifting in the foundation, puts a little pressure on that seal and
makes them pop open.

A.97:  Yeah, that could be.  But once you get that moisture in there it, it can
fog up and not go away quickly enough.

B.98:  Right.   

A.99:  Well, I hear my kid calling me,

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  I better go see what he wants.   

B.102:  Okay, well, it was good talking to you.  

A.103:  Okay, bye.   

B.104:  Bye.
