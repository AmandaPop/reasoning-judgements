A.1:  Hi, Carol.

B.2:  Hi, Frank.

A.3:  How do you feel about, uh, lawn and garden work?

@B.4:  Uh, well, to tell you the truth, my husband does most of the work.

A.5:  [Laughter] So you feel good about it [laughter].

B.6:  Yeah, I feel real good about it.

A.7:  What kind of a system does he have?  Does he have a power mower or a riding
mower?

B.8:  Yeah, no, he has a, um, you know, um, a push mower, I mean, it's electric
of course.  Um, I think it's not very old, about, um, not that old, three or
four years old, maybe.  And, uh, he, he really enjoys it, so.

A.9:  So you let him enjoy it.

B.10:  Yeah, that's fine [laughter].

A.11:  [Laughter]  You don't feel, you don't feel guilty about it. 

B.12:  No, well, last, uh, no I do enough other things, I don't feel guilty about
that [laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  Last year, this is, I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but last year for the
very first time, I did mow the grass.  My first time in my whole life.

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  And, uh, that wasn't too bad, I, it was good exercise.

A.17:  It's, it's a push mower though.  

B.18:  Well, you know, it's electric of course, I mean, it's a power, a power
mower,

A.19:  Yeah, 

B.20:  but it's, it's pretty powerful. 

A.21:  but it's, it's power, power but you have to push it.  

B.22:  Oh, yeah.

A.23:  I've, uh, I've got to admit that the last two lawn mowers that I've gotten,
um, were, uh, power driven.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  They're, they're, uh, you know, they're gasoline and they have a mechanical
contraption on a pulley handle, and it pulls the lawn mower for you.  Um, it
takes me about an hour to do, [laughter] to do my lawn.

B.26:  That's about the same for ours.

A.27:  And, uh, well, if you, if you got him a power mower it'd probably take him
a lot less time to do it.  But I enjoy doing it.  I feel good doing it, uh, I,
I feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that, with a [laughter]
pull tractor on it so I don't have to push so hard.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  But, uh, I enjoy going and cutting grass.  I like the way it looks.  And,
uh, I also have oth-, other garden equipment like, uh, Weed Whacker, the
trimmer to go around all of the,

B.30:  Oh yeah, uh-huh.

A.31:  the, uh, fence and everything.  Does he have those as well?

B.32:  Oh, yes, um, let's see, we've got a Weed Whacker, we have an, uh, edger,
you know, that goes between the grass and the sidewalk.  Um.

A.33:  Oh this, this comes with the blade on it, you mean?

B.34:  Right.  

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  Um.

A.37:  Is that a power mower or is that, a power edger or is it?

B.38:  That one is electric --

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  -- so he's got to plug that in, and drag the cord around, and let's see,
um, hedge clippers.  You know, electric of course, he-, hedge clippers.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Um.  I think that's all of the power tools we have.  We, um, but that's
that's, I think that's about all they make [laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter]  How often does he do it?

B.44:  Oh, once a week.

A.45:  All right.

B.46:  Um, actually though, we just moved to, uh, Texas a year and a half ago.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And they have a new, uh, system that they're trying to promote here which
is they don't bag it, as they call it.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Um, [noise] {sounds like phone dropped} essentially cutting it, um,
probably more like every four or five days, and, so it's still short enough so
that you can mulch it back into the grass, and never bag it.  For one thing,
um, cuts down on waste,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  for landfills and all that.

A.53:  So, so the, the state is encouraging you to do that?

B.54:  Um, it's actually through the county extension service.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And they put out all kinds of information on it, and then they put up, uh,
they had a few lawns in the area that were like samples, and they put a big
sign in their yard that said, you know, This is a Don't Bag it Lawn, and let
you watch and see how they did it.  So, their grass clippings were never
bagged.  They just mulch back into the grass itself and acted as a fertilizer.

A.57:  Do they do something to the lawn mower to, to help it, uh, stay inside or
they, 

B.58:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, and our lawn mower does that too, it's, you, you
shut off the, where the bag would go --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- or where it would, you know, spray out the side.  

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  So that it just mulches underneath.  It just goes back down, um, right
underneath the blade.

A.63:  But they don't, they, they have special munching, mulching, uh, mowers --

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  -- but that's not one of them.

B.66:  No, that's, no, that's, it's not necessary to have that.

A.67:  It is not.

B.68:  Nope.

A.69:  Oh, I always thought it was. 

B.70:  But yo-, you have to, but you're right though in that you do have to cut it
though when it's, um, relatively short.  You can't let it go a week or two.
Because if the clippings are that long, then they'll just lay on top.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  They have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down --

A.73:  Oh, that's interesting.

B.74:  -- um, into the grass.

A.75:  Maybe something I can try this time around [throat_clearing].

B.76:  It takes, takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do
it every four or five days, um, since he doesn't have to bag all of those
clippings, you know, rather than taking, I don't know, as an example an hour
and a half to do the whole lawn, it only takes an hour.

A.77:  Huh.

B.78:  So, you know, plus less bags, less waste.

A.79:  Does he have the lawn treated?

B.80:  Um, we tried that, but we really weren't happy with it.  So he does that
all himself now.

A.81:  Oh well, I, um, I tried it about ten years ago, and I've been doing it ever
since.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  I've been having it treated.  And it makes it grow much faster.  Uh,
[laughter] our season though, in New England, uh, is, is only three months or
so, and then it starts getting cold again in Septem-,

B.84:  Oh that's true [laughter].

A.85:  So we don't have, um, I guess down in Dallas you must have a, a longer
season.

B.86:  Oh, gee, I, I'd say our grass is getting green right now.

A.87:  No kidding.

B.88:  So I'm sure he'll, in fact he may have already cut it once.  I can't
remember.

A.89:  [Laughter]  No kidding.

B.90:  Um, but it'll be, we'll have to start cutting real soon.

A.91:  Wow.

B.92:  And, uh, then, oh, well, on into October, November, I'm sure.

A.93:  Oh we, I, I, I don't go that, uh, that deep.  It starts getting cold, as
soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the, uh, the grass.

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  I know in the summer time I've got to, uh, I've got to actually hold it as
long as I ca-, uh, as long as I can make the grass, I can't cut it.  I think
it's recommended three, three and a half inches they want me to leave it.  So
I can cut it.

B.96:  (( )) that long, wow.

A.97:  Well, in the summer time so that the heat doesn't, uh, burn the grass.

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  And they recommend that I keep the blade very high.  So because it's that
high, I have to do it frequently, as well.  I try to do it every, uh, uh, six
or seven days.  If,

B.100:  What kind of grass do you have?

A.101:  Um, I real-, I've got a mixture I guess [laughter].

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  It's all different kinds.  But if I let it grow too long, if I let it go
like a week and a half, two weeks, then it starts seeding on me.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  And that's, it gets too long, then it, uh, starts bunching up underneath
the lawn mower, and I can't get it out, and it's, uh, it turns out to be a
real mess.  So I've got to do it, uh, uh, no later than once a week.

B.106:  Right.

A.107:  And I, uh, I don't block off my, my, uh, chute, but I don't pick up my
grass either.  I leave it on the lawn,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  and, uh, I try to go over it again.  I do pick up, or I rake up, uh, you
know, the clumps that --

B.110:  Right.

A.111:  -- uh, that occur, but I try to leave it down there.  I did pick up, uh, a
lawn sweeper.

B.112:  Oh really.  ((We don't have one of those)).

A.113:  Yeah, that's kind of, that's kind of like, uh, the old-fashioned carpet
sweeper, only it's, it's wide --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- and you just put it on your grass, and what it does is it sweeps the
lawn, and it only picks up, you know, the height that you, you set it at.  So
I set it very high, and it just picks, or skims the grass.  It doesn't dig way
down deep.  So I don't have a lot of grass that I, uh, that I collect.

B.116:  Does it work for leaves?

A.117:  Oh, yeah, works very good with leaves, 

B.118:  Oh.  (( )).

A.119:  because leaves, if you pick them up right away, uh, they'll sit on top of
the grass.

B.120:  Right.

A.121:  And, uh, I'm trying to find a way how to electrify it or motorize it
[laughter]. Because this I have to push.

B.122:  [Laughter]  Oh, well.

A.123:  But, it, uh, it's, it's wide enough to pick up, uh, like the width, two
widths of a lawn mower.  So you can do it relatively quickly.

B.124:  Oh, yeah.  Well that's sounds interesting.  We d-, we don't, I don't know
if we do that very much.  I think I remember my mom had one of those.  #I
don't know.#

A.125:  #I, I try to take# the, the clippings and, uh, put them in a mulching, not
a mulching, but a, a to let them decompose.

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  I think that is mulch-, what do they call that?

B.128:  A compost pile.

A.129:  Compost pile [laughter].  

B.130:  Right.

A.131:  I haven't been very successful.  I'm on my third year now, and I still have
a pile in the back yard [laughter].  It, it doesn't decompose.  I guess I 
got,

B.132:  It's not composting.

A.133:  [Laughter]  You supposed to put chemicals on it?

B.134:  I don't think so.

A.135:  No.

B.136:  No, I think it's supposed to be natural.

A.137:  It's not working [laughter].

B.138:  Oh well.

A.139:  It's getting, it's shrinking down, it's getting small, but it, uh, it's
still grass, it's, it's dried up grass, and it just stays there, it doesn't
turn into dirt.

B.140:  I think you're supposed to turn it every once in a while.

A.141:  What, air it out?

B.142:  Well, I think, it, it, on the inside is where it, the chemicals, you know,
it starts to break down.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  And I think you're supposed to turn it.

A.145:  Oh.

B.146:  I mean, not, not very often, but, you know, go in and, and stir it up so to
speak --

A.147:  Yeah.

B.148:  -- to get the stuff on the outside in to the inside.

A.149:  I'm going to have to try and do that.

B.150:  It might help, I don't know. 

A.151:  Maybe it'd work [laughter].

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  Uh, the other thing I was thinking of doing is getting some chemicals to
try and help the process up, uh, a little more, a little faster.

B.154:  I don't know.  I, I, I think the idea is supposed to be natural so that,
you know, there's no,

A.155:  Chem-, no chemicals in it.

B.156:  No chemicals and plus then you can use it as a fertilizer and not have to
worry about spreading those chemicals --

A.157:  Yeah.

B.158:  -- like on your lawn or your bushes or whatever.

A.159:  I, um, I'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because
of the, uh, um, I guess what I didn't realize was that, that, they're actually
putting poisons on my grass --

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  -- and it wasn't until, uh, a year or two ago where the state required
anyone putting chemicals on lawns that they tell the customers what they're
actually putting on the lawn, and what the, uh, the hazards are.  And, uh, my
children are all grown up now, but when they were younger, I was fertilizing
my grass and didn't realize that some of the chemicals that are on the grass,
that are being put on by the chemical companies, um, stay there longer than,
than, than a few hours.

B.162:  And they're playing on, they were playing on it,

A.163:  And, yeah, and my, uh, dog was out there --

B.164:  Sure.

A.165:  -- playing in the grass and they were playing in the grass, so I don't what
long term effects that they, the chemicals had on the grass, but that's
bothered me to the point where I'm thinking about discontinuing it this year.

B.166:  Yeah.

A.167:  And try to get more, uh,
