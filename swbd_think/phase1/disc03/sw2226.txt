REMARKS:        Speaker B seemed to be washing dishes during the conversation. 

===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, books.   

B.2:  Yes. 

A.3:  Mainly I read the Bible these days.   

B.4:  That's very good.  I do, too.  

A.5:  Good, that's great to hear.  Uh, and Christian literature.

B.6:  Uh-huh.   

A.7:  Uh, I've kind of, I used to read a lot of, uh, novels, but it seems as
though if you really want to set a t-, side time to read the Bible and you
work and --

B.8:  Uh-huh.   

A.9:  -- and whatever, uh, that pretty well takes up your time for reading.

B.10:  Yeah, it does.  It,   

A.11:  And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible
[laughter] in my heart and he really has.  It's getting,

B.12:  That's good.

A.13:  to where a just really want to read it.   

B.14:  That's good.  It, it, [throat_clearing] it's, uh, it's hard for me to find
time, also, to read.  Uh, a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff
like that for, you know, because I don't have a lot of time, but when I do get
to sit down and, and read, I like to read the Bible and I like to read, I read
to my daughter a lot, too.

A.15:  Do you?   

B.16:  And, uh, I like to read, you know, Bi-, I have Bible storybooks --

A.17:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

B.18:  -- so I like reading those to her and she really enjoys those.  So that's
good.  And it, and it's kind of short because we don't, woe don't have a lot
of time,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  to, to read, so, it's real enjoyable.   

A.21:  Yeah.   

B.22:  For both of us.   

A.23:  Have you ever read any of Frank E. Peretti's?   

B.24:  Frank E. [whispering], no I guess I haven't.

A.25:  Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, uh, uh, I forget the t-, the other, well he,
uh, he's also written a lot of children, how old is your daughter.

B.26:  Five.   

A.27:  Five, okay, he's written some children's books as well and they're all
spiritually,

B.28:  Oh, really?

A.29:  uh, oriented, yeah.   

B.30:  What's his name again?  Peretti [whispering],  

A.31:  Frank E. Peretti,  

B.32:  Frank E. Peretti [whispering].

A.33:  P E R E T T I.   

B.34:  I have to look for those.   

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, do because, uh, I love to read his, his, uh, children's
books just [static] [laughter],

B.36:  Just to read them.  Well, that's good.  

A.37:  Yeah, oh, they're good, they're great.   

B.38:  That's good.   

A.39:  And it's like, uh, uh, usually about a family of, uh, archaeologists --

B.40:  Uh-huh.   

A.41:  -- and the spiritual fights that they get into,  

B.42:  Oh [breathing].

A.43:  like, uh, uh, digging in old ruins,  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  and running across, like, uh, the old gods and things.   

B.46:  Oh, that sounds pretty neat.   

A.47:  Yeah, it is.  It's real exciting.   

B.48:  Oh, I'll have to look for those.  

A.49:  And it also teaches them spiritual warfare --  

B.50:  [Sniffing] Right.    

A.51:  -- you know, so,  

B.52:  Well, that's neat.  Well, I [throat_clearing], I have a, my daughter has
PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection --

A.53:  Uh-huh.   

B.54:  -- and I like that because it's a, it's real easy to, uh, follow for her,
you know, uh, gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd
[laughter] never understand any of it.

A.55:  Well, it's hard for me.   

B.56:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.57:  [Laughter]. 

B.58:  It is, it is real hard to, to follow and understand,  

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  and, uh, I've got a Bible that, uh, has a little bit of a, uh,
[breathing] a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are.
That's, that's about the hardest thing is, who's related to who [laughter].

A.61:  I know it, and especially it's hard to keep your interest --

B.62:  Yeah.   

A.63:  -- in those begats.   

B.64:  Yes.   

A.65:  [Laughter].   

B.66:  Yes, it sure is, but, but it is good reading and it's good for us,

A.67:  Uh-huh, that's right.

B.68:  and [sniffing] and everything.  I really do enjoy it.  But, uh,
[lipsmack] I also, but then on the other extreme I like to read, uh, uh, I
guess ho-, I don't know, horror, Steven King type books.

A.69:  Uh-huh, yeah, I've read a lot of his, too.   

B.70:  The, and I, I like that, that's good fun reading.   

A.71:  Yeah.  Can't put them down.   

B.72:  No you can't, you really can't.  They are good and ooh they just, they're
just so suspenseful.

A.73:  Uh-huh, yeah.   

B.74:  I really do enjoy his.   

A.75:  Uh, there's another guy.  Oh, what can, what is his name [lipsmack].
Oh, durn [laughter], you would, well you know when you're recording you can't
re-, remem-,

B.76:  I know [laughter].   

A.77:  Uh, oh, Dean, uh, Kratz, or Kranz or,

B.78:  Judith Krantz?   

A.79:  Y-, who?   

B.80:  Judith Krantz.  I know her.   

A.81:  Uh, no, it's a guy.   

B.82:  Oh, okay.   

A.83:  And he, he writes the same thing, though.  It's that real, 

B.84:  Oh.

A.85:  gruesome [laughter],  

B.86:  Ooh.

A.87:  horror stories.   

B.88:  Yeah.  That's good. 

A.89:  Yeah.  Koontz.  Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that. 

B.90:  [Breathing] Yeah, oh, I think I know who you're talking about.  Uh, I've
seen, I don't think I can pronounce it either, but [laughter].

A.91:  Yeah, uh,  

B.92:  Yeah, I'm in a book club and I think I've seen his books --

A.93:  Uh-huh.   

B.94:  -- in there [throat_clearing].  I've never read any of his.  But they're 
real,

A.95:  I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though.  It seems like it's all the
[breathing],

B.96:  [Sniffing].

A.97:  did you ever read the, uh, uh, oh, it's one of his first books, THE
STAND.

B.98:  Yes.  That, oh, that long thing.

A.99:  I know it.  And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from
that, I mean.

B.100:  Yeah, they do kind of follow or,   

A.101:  You know, that,  

B.102:  Are similar.   

A.103:  Uh-huh.  I love that book, though.  I thought it was great. 

B.104:  Yeah, it really was, and I loved THE SHINING.   

A.105:  Ooh, yes [laughter].  

B.106:  That was, that was  my favorite.   

A.107:  Oh, those hedges when they started moving.   

B.108:  Yeah, yeah.   

A.109:  Whenever they [laughter], they made that into a movie, I was thinking oh,
my gosh if they show that,

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  I'll just die.  For some reason that scared me more than anything.

B.112:  Yeah, that is, he just brings stuff alive, you know.   

A.113:  Yeah.   

B.114:  You could just visualize everything.   

A.115:  Uh-huh.   

B.116:  That's, 

A.117:  And that was a pretty scary movie, too.

B.118:  Yeah, I think they did a pretty good job, but [throat_clearing],

A.119:  Yeah [laughter].

B.120:  they didn't follow it exactly, but they did give it, you know, do it
justice.

A.121:  Uh-huh.  That's right.   

B.122:  But, uh, most of the time they don't with, when, follow books very well
[sniffing] when they make them into movies [child_talking].

A.123:  Yeah, that's true.  I liked IT as well.   

B.124:  Yeah, yeah, uh,  

A.125:  That's,

B.126:  I did, too.   

A.127:  another big fat one.   

B.128:  Yeah.   

A.129:  [Laughter].   

B.130:  Yeah, that was good.  I liked, uh, I also liked, uh, CUJO.  Did you read
that one?

A.131:  Yeah,  

B.132:  And,

A.133:  except it broke my heart.   

B.134:  Yeah,  

A.135:  [Laughter] I'm a dog lover.   

B.136:  Me, too [laughter]. 

A.137:  [Laughter]. 

B.138:  And then, uh, [throat_clearing] NIGHT STAND, is that NIGHT,

A.139:  No, it was, uh,  

B.140:  DEAD, DEAD ZONE.  That's one I liked.  

A.141:  What?   

B.142:  DEAD ZONE.   

A.143:  Oh, yeah.   

B.144:  That was a, 

A.145:  I've read that one, too.   

B.146:  That was a real good one.   

A.147:  He's written a lot of books.   

B.148:  [Laughter].   

A.149:  Boy, he just sits down eight hours a day.   

B.150:  [Throat_clearing] I know it.   

A.151:  Just like any other job.   

B.152:  Right, and then he has some under, uh, another name.   

A.153:  That's right.   

B.154:  That he's written. 

A.155:  That one about the Gypsies, or that,  

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  hunger or, s-, uh,  

B.158:  Yeah, uh, I think his name was Bachman.  He wrote under the name of
Bachman.

A.159:  Yeah, Richard Bachman.   

B.160:  Yeah.  He is really interesting.   

A.161:  Yeah, he's so prolific.   

B.162:  Yeah [breathing].  Ooh, I wish I could do that [laughter].

A.163:  Oh, I know it.  And I have gone back and, after I, I graduated, I read some
of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through --

B.164:  Uh-huh.   

A.165:  -- and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,

B.166:  I do, too.  I love old, good old,

A.167:  Once you can get into the language, you know, the l-,  

B.168:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.169:  It's like, it's English, but it's not the same English they speak today.

B.170:  Right.    

A.171:  So it's kind of hard to keep, you know, at it, but --  

B.172:  That's true, but I,   

A.173:  -- their worthwhile.   

B.174:  That's, that was one of my favorite subjects in school was, uh --

A.175:  Literature?   

B.176:  -- literature.   

A.177:  Yeah, me, too.   

B.178:  I used to love those old, good, good old books.   

A.179:  Uh-huh.   

B.180:  [Sniffing] I didn't mind doing that at all [laughter].   

A.181:  Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself.   

B.182:  Yeah, yeah.  I liked, uh, [throat_clearing] oh, gosh why can't I think of
their names, uh, [lipsmack] [breathing], shoot, the one that wrote, uh,
WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

A.183:  Uh, wasn't that Jane Ehre?  No,  

B.184:  No that was another one.

A.185:  he wrote JANE EHRE, too [laughter].   

B.186:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, well, you know who I'm talking about [laughter].

A.187:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

B.188:  Yeah, those are good old --  

A.189:  Yeah, uh-huh.   

B.190:  -- good old books and classics, that's right.   

A.191:  Right, right.   

B.192:  Sure is neat {faint}.   

A.193:  That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen,

B.194:  Yeah.

A.195:  because they'll take a classic and, and, uh, televise it --

B.196:  Right.   

A.197:  -- you know, put it into a viewing format,  

B.198:  Right.

A.199:  more or less.   

B.200:  A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays.   

A.201:  Uh-huh.   

B.202:  I know it's, it's really hard for me.  I work two jobs and --

A.203:  Do you?   

B.204:  -- uh, have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school, myself,
so it's, it's hard for me to --

A.205:  Well, I can imagine.   

B.206:  -- sit down and read, but when I do I just, just love it.  

A.207:  Yeah, yeah me, too.
