========================================================================

A.1:  Well, the roles of women have certainly changed over the last, uh, decade
or two.  And I wonder if the, the stresses that it puts on the, the woman's
body is, uh, all that good for her as it were, had, had there been enough
adjustments in society to help the woman cope with what she has to go through,
uh, support group wise or, or just all the different aspects that men have
developed over the years to handle what the world does to them.  Uh, how, how
is the woman's world coming along in that respect?

B.2:  I think it's come along very slowly.  I think that, uh, a lot of the
stresses that you talk about have, have taken a long time to become
recognized.  But more strides are made toward addressing those stresses in
women than ever were in men.  And I think that, you know, women have had
stress, you know, for the last two hundred years, but it's been a different
kind of stress.  Different kinds of situations because just being in the work
place is different from being at home, but at home you still have work to do,
you still have things to take care of, but you don't have the responsibilities
and the pressures that you have in the work place.  So a lot of women have a
little bit of trouble adjusting to that, but I feel like the, i-, in the last
couple of decades, the, the roles have almost come full circle.  Because you
know, early on, people were wanting to, we were wanting to stay home with the
kids.  And then they got into everybody has to have a career.  And it seems to
be going back to a lot of women wanting to stay home with their kids.
Although, I don't think it'll ever go back to the way it used to be.  There
will still be many, many women who seek careers, uh, before they seek family.

A.3:  Do you think as a matter of choice or economics? 

B.4:  Both. 

A.5:  #Both.#

B.6:  #I think# it's, it's a matter of both.  Um, e-, economics has a lot to do
with it, unfortunately.  But, uh, I think a lot of choice has gone into it
lately.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And, and most of them or a lot of women, I know, would rather, um, if they
have children, they would rather stay home with them --

A.9:  Yeah. 

B.10:  -- #if they# --

A.11:  #That's true.#

B.12:  -- if they possible can. 

A.13:  You know, that's an interesting point that you brought up about the, the
fact that they essentially always have been under stress. Uh, I would say more
in the later, latter years, even those who stayed home had stress.  But when
you're the one or the two out of ten women staying home on the block --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- uh, then the stresses that you do have, uh, the normal day-to-day
stresses caring for children or whatever is occurring, uh, you could go to, at
one time, one era, you could go to the other dozens of wives on the block --

B.16:  #Yeah.  Your neighbors.#

A.17:  -- #or you could meet for# tea or whatever and you had that stress relief,
uh, built in.

B.18:  That's true. 

A.19:  Uh, whereas now, it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever
percentage happens to be in your neighborhood, like for our neighborhood,
we're looking at ninety percent working women, #let's say# --

B.20:  #Yeah.#

A.21:  -- uh, there's no place for the wife to go when she has those kind of
stresses to be relieved.

B.22:  Right. 

A.23:  So. 

B.24:  There's no one for her to go talk to and there's also no one to, to kind of
come in and take over for her and allow her some time to herself, for even a
day, you know, because there's fewer and fewer people left or women left at
home to do that.

A.25:  That's right.  About two months ago OMNI MAGAZINE, which is a, a science
magazine --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- are you familiar with that? 

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  Ran an article, um, really restating some conclusions of some, some, uh,
programs or some investigations or research, whatever you want to call it,
into the, the actual physical differences between men and women, and
questioning whether those physical differences, uh, accounted [cough] {in
background} for some of the differences in ways women handled stress as
[cough] {in background} opposed to men.  And, I guess to just barely summarize
what the article said, was that in the, the womb the differing levels of
testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain, the base of the
brain --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- affected essentially how the brain was connected to the rest of the
body.  Uh, now, how that has to deal with stress, I'm not really sure --

B.32:  Um.

A.33:  -- since I thought most of the stress had to do with, you know, from the,
from the eyes and the mental processes on up.  I don't know --

B.34:  Yeah. 

A.35:  -- what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body.
But it was an interesting, uh, uh, line of reasoning where we've always
thought or been told especially by the, for lack of a better term, women's
libber, you know, we're --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- just the same as men --

B.38:  Right. 

A.39:  -- well, maybe not.  And, and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress
the same way that men have, have managed to do all these years.  And maybe it
will take a lot longer before the physical evolution or for lack of a better
term, will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through.

B.40:  Yeah.  I agree with that.  I, it, it's something that, um, you know, I
guess, science will eventually have all the answers to everything, I don't
know, but it seems like it, it would really be, it's, it's really difficult to
put two p-, a male and a female in the same role, in the same circumstances
and have them react to, have them and their bodies react to the same situation
in similar ways.  I think, you know, even between same sexes in a different,
in the same role there would, there would be differences in the way one guy
handled something over the way another guy would handle it.

A.41:  Right. 

B.42:  So I think, when you put a male and a female in, in, in comparison, you
know, it would be, uh, completely different, I mean, just, just totally
different.  And it, you know, goes, a lot of it goes back to the way you were
raised as children, you know, the males are raised to believe this and be this
way and the females are raised to believe something else and be this way.
And, uh, when, when you're raised that way, you kind of perpetuate that, oh,
those ideals that other people, uh, force upon you.

A.43:  Right. 

B.44:  And so you don't, you're not able to, well, I guess you are able to, if you
want to change them, but you stay in those roles for so long that it's, it's
hard to, to adjust and it would take a, a really long time for, I think,
science to figure out, you know, what affects women, how, and how the same
thing affects men.  I think, I just don't think it's any kind of study they
can do in any even twenty or thirty year period of time, you know.

A.45:  Yeah.  The subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they
need [laughter].

B.46:  That's right [laughter].  

A.47:  It would be an exhausted test [laughter]. 

B.48:  [Laughter] It would. 

A.49:  Uh, how about the, the area of role models or roles as it were, when you,
you know, teach the boy that, uh, he fixes the car and the woman fixes the
meal.  Uh, not, not arguing that there should be [breathing] a role for a sex,
but should there be, uh, any set of, not, not a specific role, let's say,
let's not say that only the, the girls should do the cooking --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- but at any given generation or for any given, uh, compatibility, if you
want a couple to be together, shouldn't they have, uh, defined roles, as it
were, uh, certainly capable of sharing the other role for nothing more than
empathy.  I mean, it, you know, at least they understand what the other person
is going through.

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  Not being a tremendous cook, I, I know what the burden of preparing a 
meal, 

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  but I don't know what really would have taken to make that meal taste any
better --

B.56:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.57:  -- out on the budget I give her, that kind of deal [throat_clearing] so, I
wonder, I don't have any argument or problem with women changing a given 
role --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- as long as there's something on the other side, let's say, of any
relationship to, to match that, I mean --

B.60:  #To pick up the slack, yeah.#

A.61:  -- #you don't want two people doing# the same thing in the relationship.

B.62:  That's right.  Yeah. 

A.63:  So. 

B.64:  Yeah, you have to, it has to balance out and I guess that's when you get
into relationships and people, people are attracted to people who compliment
them most often.  I mean, they say opposites attract and I'm not too sure I
believe that very much.  But, uh, I think that people, when they get into
relationships, you know, if there's somebody who, like, if you got two people
who hate to cook, they're going to eat out all the time and th-, you know,
that's not that big a deal.  But, you know, if you get somebody who likes to
cook and someone who doesn't like to cook, then the person who doesn't, who
doesn't like to cook probably likes to do something else, you know.  So, I
think that people end up, I think that, that women are more diverse now than
they ever were, as far as what they have learned and what they're capable of
and, and, uh, what they're willing to do.  And so I feel like, you know, that,
men have gotten to be that way, too.  They've gotten a little bit more relaxed
in their thinking about, uh, women and you know, what they expect of them.  So
I think that, you know, it's a slow evolution, but I think it's, it's, it's a
good process.  I think it's, it's working, you know.  There are still people
who, men who believe that women should be home, you know, all day --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and cooking dinner [laughter] --

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  -- my husband's in the kitchen cooking dinner saying right on [laughter]. 

A.69:  Yeah.  I know one that's still that way, but that's about it.  I'm down to
one friend that holds that position still.  I'm the only one home, right now,
and I --

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  -- I have the kids clamoring for my attention now, 

B.72:  [Laughter]. 

A.73:  so I understand what that's like.

B.74:  Yes.  So I, you know, think that there are very few men who still feel that
way and very few women who will tolerate a man who feels that way.

A.75:  Now that's an interesting point, yeah.  I mean, once the expectations 
are,
