============================================================================

A.1:  I've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this.  It's been down this
weekend.

B.2:  {T V in background} Well, I haven't tried, but this is, I haven't called in
a couple of days, but education in public schools.  I have a son who's
graduating, uh, in May, and there's some interesting problems of, of, of how
d-, you, how do you challenge the kids today.  And I have some real hang-ups.
I think that, uh, if your, if your kid's not ambitious, he can sure get lost.

@A.3:  In the school systems?

B.4:  #Yes.#

A.5:  #That's right.#  What school system does he go to?

B.6:  In North Garland, he goes t-,

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  What school system are you familiar with?

A.9:  Okay, my children go to Garland, and I teach in Dallas. 

B.10:  Y-, oh, okay, #well, I have a daughter that's in the, in,#

A.11:  #And my husband teaches# with Plano.

B.12:  in the I B program at Garland.

A.13:  In the what?

B.14:  In the, are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program.

A.15:  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

B.16:  Uh, do your kids go to Garland High, you said?

A.17:  No, no, they're still in elementary.

B.18:  Oh, okay.  

A.19:  So, yeah.

B.20:  Well, there's a, it's, um, she went from Austin Academy when it opened up,

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  over to, uh, to North Garland for ninth grade.  But at North Garland,
the, the difficulty I see with the education system is that, uh, is that, you
can, you can, you can get some masses, but unless, if the kid's really
dedicated, it seems like they do all right.  But if, if, if your child is just
pressing along, uh, I, I'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid
enough.  Would you, argue with that?

A.23:  I'm definitely not, are you kidding?  [sniffing] #No.#

B.24:  #Well you know# the, the, the thing that I don't see, and maybe you would
take issue with it is that if, if we went to, if there was an opportunity for
teachers to teach year around.

A.25:  No, I want that [laughter].  

B.26:  Well would, 

A.27:  I think it would be better for the teachers and for the children, because
we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have.  I know when you
get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like
they've lost so much ground, we spend at least the first six weeks just
backing up, reteaching what they had the year before.  You know.

B.28:  Well how do we accom-, how do we get that?

A.29:  Well, we're starting pilot schools.  It's a-, Dallas is doing it I know.  I
think Plano, don't they have some, and Richardson's supposed to start some
pilot schools, going to school year around.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And then we, you know, we investigated this by flying some people out from
Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it.

B.32:  Does it work well out there?

A.33:  Yeah, it seems to, and one thing, it'll save us money, because we've got
the buildings sitting there, right, and we might as well use them.

B.34:  Well, what about the, what about the issue of air conditioning.  Isn't that
a s-, an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning?

A.35:  Well, air conditioning, what's, and, and heating.  

B.36:  Oh, yeah.

A.37:  Isn't air conditioning less than heating, because we have to, just up like,
if we get in the thirties, we raise it up to the seventies, right, that's
forty degrees.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Isn't it less?

B.40:  Yeah, it's, it's less degree days, you're right.  But I think, I think,

A.41:  And it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer, really, if you go
year around --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- there's not thirty days difference.

B.44:  W-, well how do they do it?  Do they put, uh, long, do they put two or
three week breaks between?

A.45:  There's different ways to do it.  Like I, I think going two six weeks and
then having two, two weeks off, each after a two six weeks period is one way.

B.46:  Is that, from, from what you've seen, is that the desirable way to do it?

A.47:  See, I don't know, because I've never seen it in action.

B.48:  Oh, you said you had some people from California.  Oh I thought you,

A.49:  No, the school system in Dallas has sent people there --

B.50:  Oh, okay.

A.51:  -- to do that.  No.

B.52:  But you didn't go.

A.53:  But I think I'd like it, and I know a lot of teachers that would like to
try it.

B.54:  Well, the, the other issue has to, that I hear that the local commentator I
listen to (( )) some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact
that the principal, do you see that the principals aren't really in charge?

A.55:  The principal's, their t-, hands are tied, by all the administrators, and I
heard that in Dallas, it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom
of the educators that were hired [laughter].

B.56:  Well I had heard that one of the comments #when they, when they brought 
it,# 

A.57:  #It's just, you don't# even know who all your bosses are.  It's ridiculous.

B.58:  Um.  Then why the, the one they brought in, the new superintendent for
Dallas schools, the admini-, um, can't think of his name, but the idea --

A.59:  Marvin Edwards.

B.60:  -- yeah, that he had suggested that, that maybe they could reduce the
number of administrators and, and some of the people who were administrators
saying, that, that, uh, that's not what he was hired for.  But they resented
the fact that he would try to save some costs there.

A.61:  Well, you know he did, supposedly cut administrators, but what they've done
is create other offices for those same people, and just rehi-, renamed their
jobs --

B.62:  Um.

A.63:  -- and, you know, opened up n-, other n-, other things.  One thing we've
got going is called reading and initiative, and they've hired all these
administrators in on that, you know.

B.64:  Well, you know, the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that
it tak-, that it took to contest the, the football, um, issue.

A.65:  Pass or no fail, what is it?

B.66:  Yeah but the --

A.67:  No play.

B.68:  -- I can't think of the name of the school,

A.69:  No play.

B.70:  that, that, uh, but in any event they, they, they kept arguing.

A.71:  Carter High School.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  And they went to court, I mean, i-, you know, guess I, I'm sympathetic with
the kids, but, but how much money did that cost Dallas to, to, to fight that
in court.

A.75:  And all the things that Dallas fights, costs thousands, probably millions
of dollars, I bet you.

B.76:  But just think of all the, the, all the lawyers you've kept employed, see.

A.77:  Yeah, I know.  

B.78:  [Laughter].

A.79:  And psychologists [laughter] and stuff.  

B.80:  That's right, 

A.81:  That's right.

B.82:  and, and all these other people are out running around.  I guess that's
the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce, so.  But you need to keep
all these people employed, right?

A.83:  #No, we do not.#

B.84:  #And, and #[laughter],

A.85:  No [laughter],

B.86:  You mean, you mean, we need a little more of our tax money, like maybe,
uh,

A.87:  We need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students, because
it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper, and [laughter]
you're trying to ration it, you know, now that's sad, when there's supposed to
be what, you know, one thousand, what, sixty-five dollars, something like
that, spent on each pupil.

B.88:  Yeah.  (( )).

A.89:  Um, it's, it's wrong.  Anyway, I was thinking about [sniffing] one thing
that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's
modalities, and I think in nineteen, uh, ninety-three we're supposed to begin
that.  If, if a child is a visual learner, we're supposed to present him with
all these visual things, and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic, we're
supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it, learns the best
way.  And that's going to be quite a problem.

B.90:  (( )) Oh that's,

A.91:  But if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help.

B.92:  Um, that's interesting, and how many administrators is that going to take?

A.93:  [Laughter] I don't know, no telling, I don't know.  And, you know, at
nongraded schools.  They've had one in Gladewater for years and years and
years.  If we could just let these kids go at their own rate.  I have children
even, I, I teach Chapter One, and it's for kids that have fallen behind in
their reading according to, like I T B S scores.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And some of the kids, really they shouldn't be in there, and they're, you
know, they're not being challenged, and they're not being challenged in their
home, and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road.

B.96:  Yeah, well, that's, that's part of where my son is, um, would like to go to
Rice, but I don't think he's, well, the, the difficulty is, is, is the people
that get in are, are, are overachievers.

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  And he's not an overachiever.  But the same time, everybody can't go, but
it, the question of, of, you know, of how far should you take a kid in the
motivation, I'm not sure, I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on
the teachers to motivate these kids.  I had a, a friend that was administrator
in Richardson said if the parents read books, then the kids probably would
read books.

A.99:  Right.

B.100:  But that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to,
question of, of how much reading do those kids' parents do.

A.101:  My children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time --

B.102:  Well.

A.103:  -- to do anything with them.

B.104:  Well, but that's the point, as I would say, uh --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- and that is, that's what makes, there's a lot of problems.  But anyway,
um, I'm trying to think how much longer.  I had a conversation, week or so ago
and we got carried away, and they cut, it beeps in at ten minutes.  So.

A.107:  I know it, I know it [laughter].

B.108:  [Laughter] So anyway.

A.109:  I went for a couple and I didn't know that there was even a cut off or
anything.  Oh another things that's wrong with schools, this is big,
[laughter] there's too much emphasis on test.  We're spending the first hour
of every day teaching for the (( )) test at my school, and we're going to do
that until at least the first part of May.

B.110:  Huh.  Well see, that's in the Garland schools, the numbers, they, I don't
think they have to do that because most everybody passes.

A.111:  [Laughter]  But see, they're not in Dallas.

B.112:  Well, opportunity, right?  [laughter] If you get graded on percent
improvement.  But see, that.

A.113:  Yeah, we're not working with the same type of students --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- that most of these kids in Garland are.

B.116:  And unfortunately, the, uh, that's, that's tough, that's a real challenge
though.  But, uh.

A.117:  But see, what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even
more than they are.

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  And we're not teaching toward the test, we're teaching, you know, I always
objected, you know, it's like there's not a whole lot of, you know, fun time
like we used to have in school.  Like our principal says, I want every child
to be on task all the time.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  And you can't do that as adults.  But we're expecting kids to.  And like
after, after recess, play --

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  -- we don't get that. Okay.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  If they finish before their thirty minutes is up, then they can go out and
play for like maybe five or ten minutes, probably be the most.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  But we always got that, didn't you?  {Loud dish clanging noises}.

B.128:  Well, yeah, you know, our s-, son had that, he was, had an attention
deficit disorder, and they were keeping him from recess and in reality that's,
uh, that's one of those really tough situations.  I think the kids need some
time to play.

A.129:  Yeah.  {Dishes clanging}.

B.130:  But, (( )) people like, if more people like you though that understand the
problems get in and (( )) and change some education so. Uh, I got some
background noise there but I guess {/TV} ...
