============================================================================

A.1:  So what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or,

B.2:  Well, I, uh, I'd have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals.

A.3:  Bengals.   

B.4:  Uh-huh.   

A.5:  Yeah, uh, I w-, uh, I was pulling for the Bengals when they, uh, lost the
Super Bowl [laughter].

B.6:  Oh, that was sad, wasn't it.   

A.7:  Two years ago, was it.

B.8:  Yeah, yeah, yeah that was just a couple of years ago.

A.9:  Yeah, I, I pulled for them for the sole reason because I didn't want
forty-niners to win.

B.10:  [Laughter].   

A.11:  Anybody who plays the forty-niners, really.   

B.12:  Yeah, well, uh, it's kind of hard to, uh, to know what to do with some of
these teams and they're either extremely strong or very, very weak --

A.13:  Yeah.   

B.14:  -- and, uh, nothing much in between.   

A.15:  Yeah, that's true.  Uh, my favorite team is, is, are the Raiders.

B.16:  Oh, you like the Raiders.   

A.17:  Yeah, I mean I've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super
Bowl last, I think it was eighty-four,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  I think it was.   

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  And, uh, I pretty much like them ever since that.  And they haven't, they
haven't produced since then but, 

B.22:  No [laughter].   

A.23:  But, least I've stuck with them.  I'm loyal.   

B.24:  Uh-huh.  Well, that, that, and that's the important thing.  I mean, whether
they win or lose, why the fun is, is, in the supporting them.

A.25:  Yeah.   

B.26:  And staying with it, and hoping that, uh, you know, the next time is a
better time around.

A.27:  Yeah.  What other teams, uh, do you like up there?   

B.28:  Well, [breathing] uh,  

A.29:  Or do you not watch much football?   

B.30:  Oh, I love football.   

A.31:  Oh, really?   

B.32:  Oh, watch it, uh, e-, every game that's on I watch.   

A.33:  Every Sunday and Monday.   

B.34:  Yeah, and Thursday nights [laughter].   

A.35:  Oh, that's right.   

B.36:  No, there, uh, well, let's see, I ((never use)) thought about football too
much yet.

A.37:  Yeah, me either.  It's kind of like, they, they gave me the topic and I'm,
like, football, jeez it's been a long time.

B.38:  Yeah, right, uh, uh,  

A.39:  Did you know that they're playing a game today?   

B.40:  Yeah, that's the World League?   

A.41:  Yeah.   

B.42:  Yeah.  What time is that supposed to be?   

A.43:  They're playing it right now.   

B.44:  Oh, are they?   

A.45:  Yeah.  I think it's, uh, A B C that's carrying it.   

B.46:  Oh.  

A.47:  It's, either A B C or N B C, one or the other, I think.  I'm not too sure.
One of the major stations.  It's, uh, Barcelona versus New York.

B.48:  Um.  Well, uh, I haven't, for some reason have never really gotten enthused
about football in the summer f-, from the, the World League.

A.49:  Yeah, the temperature's just not right.   

B.50:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, it just seems like it should only be done in cold
weather [laughter].

A.51:  Yeah.   

B.52:  Rather than just be played at a-, anytime during the year.  

A.53:  We usually don't, uh, we usually don't have very cold weather down here,
you know during, uh, during football season.  I-, it gets colder later on in
the season.

B.54:  Uh-huh.   

A.55:  But it takes a good while for it to get cold.   

B.56:  Huh.   

A.57:  But, couple, couple Christmases ago we had a, a freak storm and I live near
the coast, actually I live, like, right on the coast of North Carolina --

B.58:  Ooh.   

A.59:  -- and, uh, what, they, they called it like a winter hurricane --

B.60:  Uh-huh.   

A.61:  -- and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain, it just
brought a lot of snow.  And basically it rain-, it, it snowed only on the
coast, but not inland.  So the coast was completely, we had, like, ten foot
snow drifts which, in the coast, we barely get an inch of snow a year.

B.62:  Oh, is that right?

A.63:  Yeah, and so, we, you know, because being near the water, we get less snow
than anybody else.

B.64:  Yeah.   

A.65:  And this time we had a bunch of snow.  We, we, I had fun playing in, in the
snow, playing football in the snow.  And so, I mean, I, I had never done that
before,

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  and it's, it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and
it doesn't matter because it's snow.

B.68:  Is that right?   

A.69:  Yeah.   

B.70:  Huh.  I would think, uh, that if you were real cold and you hit, uh, hit
the ground that it would seem to hurt more.

A.71:  Yeah, well we had, like, layers of clothing to keep away the snow.

B.72:  Well, that helps doesn't it [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah.  But the snow also helps, you know, and it, it, we had, like, one
foot deep snow,

B.74:  Oh, yeah.

A.75:  in this, in this open field and so it was a little hard to run, but when
you got hit and you fell, you didn't really feel it.

B.76:  [Laughter].   

A.77:  You just felt the hit of the person, but when you hit the ground, it was,
you know, just snow.  It was, it was pretty fun.

B.78:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.79:  But, it's, it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather, that's true.

B.80:  Yeah.  Right, right [lipsmack].  What kind of weather you having right
now?

A.81:  Well, right now we're having nice weather.  I, I probably say, in, in the
upper sixties, maybe lower seventies right now.

B.82:  Oh, my, well our weather's suddenly turned cold again, uh, our weather is
so unstable ((never know)).

A.83:  Yeah, especially at this time.   

B.84:  Yes, and, uh, this morning, why, it was raining and it was quite cold and
then it seemed to warm up somewhat, and then, before, uh, before I got out of
church it cooled off again.  So much so that I, uh, stopped at home to change
coats because I had to go down to the hospital and, uh, the coat I had on was
just too light in weight.

A.85:  Yeah, is it very windy up there now?   

B.86:  Yes, very strong winds.   

A.87:  Yeah, we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been
up, been with us all day {pause}. Well,

B.88:  Well, been awfully nice talking with you.   

A.89:  Yeah, this is the first time I've talked with someone up north.

B.90:  [Laughter].   

A.91:  Really.  Mostly I've been talking with people in Texas.   

B.92:  Yeah, right.  Right.  Most people seem to be there, out there.

A.93:  Seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas.

B.94:  Right [laughter].   

A.95:  [Laughter].   

B.96:  Okay, well good talking to you.   

A.97:  Yeah,  

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  nice talking to you, too.   

B.100:  Bye-bye.   

A.101:  Bye.
