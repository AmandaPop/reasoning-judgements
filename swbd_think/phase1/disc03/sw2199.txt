=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you have a lawn?   

B.2:  Yes, we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a
pretty good size front yard.

A.3:  Oh, good, so who cuts the grass?   

B.4:  My husband.   

A.5:  [Laughter].   

B.6:  It's not a job that I enjoy at all.   

A.7:  Well, I used to own a home, and when I owned my house I had a small yard
and a small front yard, and a small backyard and I cut the grass.  But I sold
it, so now I live in an apartment.

B.8:  So you don't have to fool with any of that anymore.   

A.9:  So I don't have to fool with any of it, no.   

B.10:  Well, I'm big into the plant, I like the, the flower beds and plants a lot
better than I do the lawn.

A.11:  Oh, then my wife and you would probably get along well.  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Yeah, I had, used to have a garden until the kids got older and we don't
have any more room in the backyard so now all I've got is flowers instead of
vegetables.

A.13:  [Laughter]  Yeah, we talk about, uh, Laura talks about growing, uh, right,
right now she's interested I think in herb garden.  She mentioned this
morning,

B.14:  Um.

A.15:  that she could grow, just you know, flower box --  

B.16:  Uh-huh.   

A.17:  -- and I think that's, but I think, uh, after we, uh, after I finish
school, and we're ready to, you know, settle down someplace and I get a decent
job, then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can
have a garden.

B.18:  Yeah, it's nice to have.  Nothing is better than going out there and
picking your own tomatoes or --

A.19:  Yeah.   

B.20:  -- different vegetables and things,  

A.21:  Yeah, I,  

B.22:  to eat.   

A.23:  Yeah, and that's the big problem with being in an apartment is we've talked
about it and even, uh, Laura even said, you know, as a wedding present, we
should ask for these big pots, you know,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  that we could put on the front porch, because the apartment complex
actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other
side --

B.26:  Uh-huh.   

A.27:  -- so we thought about, you know, having, putting it in pots and putting
pots just on our steps and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers.  Like right now
would be beautiful in, in Maryland, you know, daffodils are just all blooming.

B.28:  Um.   

A.29:  So it would be really pretty.   

B.30:  Yeah, container gardening is really pretty easy because I've done some of
it before.

A.31:  Uh-huh.   

B.32:  You just need to get the, you need to get the right mix of soil so that it
doesn't dry out.

A.33:  Yep, yep.   

B.34:  And so that your plants, because and then you have to, you still have to
water them a lot of times, once, here in Dallas you have to water sometimes
twice a day, because it gets so hot in the summer.

A.35:  Yeah, well, we wouldn't have to worry about that [laughter]. 

B.36:  [Laughter].   

A.37:  Right now we're going through, we just, it just rained all day today or
it's been raining most of the morning, drizzling off and on.

B.38:  Um.   

A.39:  But, yeah.   

B.40:  Well, we've got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere.  All
of our neighbors are out scalping their lawn for the first time.

A.41:  Oh, really, this is, what is, I guess your growing season's just about to
begin?

B.42:  Yes.   

A.43:  Oh.  

B.44:  We hit our, we'll hit our last spring freeze [breathing], it snowed here
as late as May before,

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  but that was really unusual.   

A.47:  Yeah.   

B.48:  Our, our, our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth. 

A.49:  Yeah, that's a,  

B.50:  And so, we're all,  

A.51:  S-, 

B.52:  everybody's out planting and buying and --  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  -- seeing what died. 

A.55:  See, we're a little bit later than that, but that's right, that's about
right about the same.  Yeah.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  But, I think, uh, I think you, you must have much warmer weather through
the winter, so that's,

B.58:  Yeah, it makes it nice for gardening when it's, when it's like that because
we can grow a lot of things even through the winter --

A.59:  Uh-huh.   

B.60:  -- that, uh, you all can't grow.  We can start, I can start a garden in
July.  I've done that, and, and plant some of the, uh, sturdier crops,
broccoli and things like that,

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  you have to really water it a lot when it's, when it's young like that
and it's in the heat --

A.63:  Yeah.  And then,

B.64:  -- but then --

A.65:  July and August, yeah.   

B.66:  -- then as the fall comes on, you get a, you can get a really beautiful
second crop of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes that's the
only, some peas --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- and different things like that, that's the only time of the year you can
grow them.

A.69:  Um.   

B.70:  Because otherwise it's too, it gets, if you start them when it's cooler in
the spring, then it gets too hot in the summer.

A.71:  Right.  You know, that, jeez I never thought of that because see, here our
growing season is basically done by, uh, well you might have some tomatoes
still blooming in, uh, in October, the begi-, very be-, first week of 
October --

B.72:  Uh-huh.   

A.73:  -- but normally everything's done by September.   

B.74:  Yeah.   

A.75:  End of September means you're basically done growing anything.

B.76:  Um, yeah, but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker.  

A.77:  Uh-huh, yeah, because it,

B.78:  Because we can grow, sometimes there have been times when, when, when I've
grown stuff out, I've grown broccoli up through November.

A.79:  Oh, gee that'd be nice.   

B.80:  And still have it producing, and okra.  Okra will grow real, okra will grow
to be six foot tall. ((It's just)) [breathing].

A.81:  Uh-huh.  We don't even grow okra up here.

B.82:  Yeah, you probably don't have the right,

A.83:  Yeah, we don't have the right whatever.

B.84:  temperatures and stuff.   

A.85:  Yeah.   

B.86:  Probably not too many people eat it up there either [laughter] seems to be
kind of a southern delicacy.

A.87:  Well, I think it, it, it, it's getting, uh, a little bit more popular
because see there's a lot of the, uh, first, you know, first the big wave of
Tex-Mex food came by, you know,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  and so we're, we're big into tacos and stuff up here now, and, and taco
salads and things, which they, probably Mexican people don't even know what a
taco salad is.

B.90:  [Laughter].   

A.91:  But I think it's, now it's moving up, too, because, uh, just the change,
you know, just something different.

B.92:  Yeah.   

A.93:  Plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and I think the, uh, the
mid-Atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes.

B.94:  Yeah.   

A.95:  I think it's our Irish descent.   

B.96:  Maybe so.   

A.97:  Yeah, but I think it, it's changing now.  Yeah, so I, so we do know what
okra is.

B.98:  Uh-huh.   

A.99:  I wouldn't have known what it was when I was a teenager, though.

B.100:  Oh.  Well, what's your favorite plant if you were, you know, you were
talking about your containers, maybe you were going to get those started.
What would you like to put in them?

A.101:  Well, we were going to, probably just going to start, well because we're
going to be moving, we're talking about just putting, throwing tomatoes in --

B.102:  Uh-huh.   

A.103:  -- you know, and then, uh, but also things like tulips, I think, uh, I
would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now, you know.

B.104:  Yeah, tulips is just kind of late because you have to, you have to force
them.

A.105:  Uh-huh.   

B.106:  If you were going to do that.  You might put some strawberries in there
around the edges.

A.107:  Yeah, we, we talked about that, too, in fact, uh, my sister-in-law,
Laura's brother's wife, you know, was talking about, you know, putting
strawberries, uh, moving their strawberries because they just moved.

B.108:  Uh-huh.   

A.109:  It's this problem with being in school, you know, they just moved and they
took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in
containers and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them.  I
think, but they going to let them bloom this year in the containers.

B.110:  Yeah, they'll work that way.   

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  And they're kind of pretty.  They've got little white flowers and,

A.113:  Uh-huh.    

B.114:  Long as, 

A.115:  Would you have to stake them up, do, aren't they, do they grow,

B.116:  No.

A.117:  along the ground, strawberries?   

B.118:  They'd grow kind of like a vine.   

A.119:  Uh-huh.   

B.120:  They, they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would. 

A.121:  Yeah.   

B.122:  And, and along those is wh-, that's where the strawberry grows and it will
eventually take over an area.  You plant them, when you plant strawberries,
you plant them like six to eight inches or more, you can even plant further
than that, but to cover an area, so you co-, you put them eight inches apart,

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  all through a flower bed, and by the next year, you'll have pretty much a
solid bed,

A.125:  Oh.

B.126:  of strawberries.   

A.127:  See, I've never grown strawberries.   

B.128:  They're real simple.  That's why I like them.  I just put a bunch out
because you just put them out there and you water them.

A.129:  Uh-huh.   

B.130:  The bugs don't, least h-, at least here, the bugs don't particularly bother
them and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care,

A.131:  Yeah.

B.132:  you know, during the rest of the year.   

A.133:  Uh-huh.  Just water.   

B.134:  Yeah.  And then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw
them away and start over again.  They don't last forever.

A.135:  Uh-huh.  Well, they say, aren't, maybe you're supposed to cut them back.
Cut them and re-, 

B.136:  That can help.  You just get to a point where they're just not productive
anymore.

A.137:  Yeah.   

B.138:  It's just a kind of, uh, just the way the plant is.   

A.139:  Yeah, rotationary thing.    

B.140:  Yeah.   

A.141:  Oh, that's interesting.  See because I've never really grown strawberries.
Lot of tomatoes, but never really strawberries.

B.142:  Yeah, I like tomatoes but I always end up with, when I've grown them, I, I
end up with,

A.143:  Uh, yeah.

B.144:  the little cherry tomatoes, just thousands of them [laughter] and I can't
figure out what to do with them all.

A.145:  Hundreds of thousand, you can't even give them away.   

B.146:  Yeah, because everybody else is growing --   

A.147:  I can remember,

B.148:  -- the same kind of thing.

A.149:  as a kid growing up, my whole family, all my family grew strawberries,
grew, excuse me, grew tomatoes so whenever somebody would come over your house
they'd always bring some tomatoes,

B.150:  Yeah.   

A.151:  well, but you grew your own tomatoes.   

B.152:  [Laughter].   

A.153:  So if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good,

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  because you already had a half dozen, you know, pulled that day.  It's
really funny.

B.156:  Yeah.  Some other things that will grow good in those containers, and you
can, you can mix and match the flowers with your, your vegetables,

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  and grow around them.  Marigolds and impatiens.   

A.159:  Oh, yeah.

B.160:  They do real good, especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when
you're on a porch,

A.161:  Uh-huh.

B.162:  area part of the time.  I mix, all, all my flower beds are mixed up.  I've
got onions behind the irises and [laughter],

A.163:  Well, that's makes sense, though.

B.164:  All back and forth and around.  Yeah, because they're going to be, they'll
grow now, from now until the, about [lipsmack] middle of June,

A.165:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.166:  then I'll have all the onions and they'll be out and then I'll put in
some flowers, some annuals for the rest of the year and some color.

A.167:  Oh, you are a big gardener, huh.

B.168:  Yeah, I like getting in the dirt,

A.169:  Yeah.

B.170:  I just don't, I hate mowing [laughter].   

A.171:  [Laughter].   

B.172:  It's too hot, and it has to be done too often.  

A.173:  Yeah, I guess the more the plant, the less you have to mow. 

B.174:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.175:  Because that's a, when I had my yard, it was, you know, it was, it was
really a hassle.  Cutting grass was just a terr-, just the thought of it was a
terrible thing.  Oh, I used to hate it.

B.176:  Yeah.  With ours it wouldn't be so bad.  We had a self propelled mower, but
the self propelled part broke.

A.177:  Oh.

B.178:  And so it doesn't, and then, and then, it weighs a ton.

A.179:  Yeah because,

B.180:  Because it's,

A.181:  it's when it's self propelled it's heavy, yeah.   

B.182:  Yeah, and it's, so it's supposed to pull itself along and my husband, it
doesn't bother him and h-, I'm got out and mowed for him one day just to be
nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home, and I said, what is with
this mower, I can't even push it around the yard.

A.183:  [Laughter] Yeah that,  

B.184:  And, you know, he's like, well, I get more exercise pushing it around.

A.185:  [Laughter]  My, uh, my brother went out and bought a mower used, you know,
he was looking for a lawn mower and he --

B.186:  Uh-huh.   

A.187:  -- he just had bought a house, he lived in an apartment before.  And he
bought a used mower, it was a real big heavy one and he said that, that, you
know, basically they sold it on him because, you know, it was a macho 
thing --

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  -- the bigger and heavier the lawn mower, the more macho,

B.190:  [Breathing].

A.191:  the guy behind it.  So, you know, of course he couldn't buy one of those
little, little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the, uh, one of the
Aames, or --

B.192:  Yeah.

A.193:  -- the, the fast mowing places.  You had to buy a big one, you know,

B.194:  [Laughter].

A.195:  because it meant something for your macho.   

B.196:  [Laughter].

A.197:  Same reason why he has to drive a big truck with four wheels, you know.

B.198:  Yeah [laughter].

A.199:  Four wheel drive.  It was a macho thing.  He had to use that, but then
after he used it one year, he took it back to where he got it used and he sold
it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller.

B.200:  [Laughter] Yeah.   

A.201:  He said it was just too dang heavy.   

B.202:  Too many trips around the yard with that thing, huh.   

A.203:  Yeah.   

B.204:  For sure. 

A.205:  Plus, I think he lives at a small hillside, too, so,  

B.206:  Oh, gosh.

A.207:  yeah, trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around, you know,
without it tipping over,

B.208:  Oh, yeah.

A.209:  it was a pain.

B.210:  That's the other thing with my husband.  He gets, he, he's one of these
people, he didn't care about the flower beds and stuff, I guess we divide it
pretty well that way,

A.211:  Yeah.

B.212:  but, he, he gets real picky about the grass, he wants to get out there,
and he cuts on diagonal and goes all this back and forth, and,

A.213:  Uh-huh.

B.214:  you know, and gets the weed eater out and trims all the little bits
around the flower beds and all the little bits around the trees that he
doesn't get.  He'll go out there and spend four hours on the lawn.

A.215:  Uh-huh.  Well, it's probably his, his, his personal time.  While he's
cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else.

B.216:  I guess [laughter].

A.217:  It's probably, and plus, no one bothers him, you know, you walk behind a
lawn mower making all that noise,

B.218:  No, nobody's going to bother you.

A.219:  no one ever talks to you.  You know, you're on your own.
