@A.1:  Okay, camping.  My camping experiences are, uh, using a trailer,

B.2:  I see.  

A.3:  a Terry eighteen foot, uh, mobile trailer and, and that's, you know, like
going to lakes and stuff like that.

B.4:  Sure.   

A.5:  Setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever.

B.6:  Uh-huh.   

A.7:  Uh, what's, what's your thoughts on camping?   

B.8:  Well, for me camping, I've never owned a trailer so for me camping is m-,
has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents,

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  but I guess that this, cu-, two kinds of camping that, um, I've done, one
is to throw a, a tent and food and the like in the back of a car and drive to
a campsite and setup the tent and have the, the car right next to me.

A.11:  Uh-huh.   

B.12:  The other is to actually, you know, carry everything on your back.  I've
done camping out in, at, in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where,

A.13:  [Cough] Yeah, that's, up here in New England that's, we call that
backpacking which is the same thing which is you're, you've got everything on
your back, you know,

B.14:  Right, right.   

A.15:  it's a aluminum camp frame, uh,  

B.16:  Exactly.   

A.17:  uh, yeah, like, well [laughter], um, the older you get the more
convenience you try [laughter] to bring with you I guess, so.

B.18:  I understand.     

A.19:  ((I'm up)) to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to
be probably Winnebago, I hope if,

B.20:  Oh, yeah.   

A.21:  I only can afford one but that, of course, camping again is, is like you
say, that, that your, your backpacking is, I guess, what I would call true
camping.  I'm not,

B.22:  Right.   

A.23:  I'm not sure that the other c-, type of camping is nothing more than a
leisure for,

B.24:  Well, either way it's, get, I guess, maybe we can define it as living away
from the home [laughter].

A.25:  That's right, that's right. 

B.26:  But,

A.27:  We have, we have, uh, around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have,
uh, campsites that are, uh, ((barriers)) set aside for each, like each
individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity.

B.28:  Exactly.   

A.29:  And you back in, you know, and or just pull into your spot and, uh, some
you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or,

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  by the week or whatever.   

B.32:  Yeah, when I, when I mentioned I've done this camping out of the car, I've
actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's
through Texas Instruments.

A.33:  Oh, really?   

B.34:  Yeah, T I has a lit-, uh, owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that
borders, that, the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma,

A.35:  Yeah, they wh-,  

B.36:  it's called Lake Texoma.   

A.37:  Lake Texoma, they've got a big, uh, er-, big rec centers up there, right?

B.38:  Yeah, that's right, so, that's where I've done most of that actually.

A.39:  [Cough] Is that a pretty nice place?   

B.40:  It is.  It's really beautiful.  The, the lake is, is outstanding.

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  It's a huge, huge, huge lake.

A.43:  I spent about ten years in Abilene for T I, I've, I worked out there in
Abilene in west Texas,

B.44:  Oh, yeah.   

A.45:  and I never did get a chance to get over to,  

B.46:  Oh, yeah, I think,

A.47:  Lake Texoma.  I, I wished I had, uh,

B.48:  Well, if you every get to Dallas you can probably, you know, bo-, you can
go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks.

A.49:  That's unreal, yeah [laughter]. 

B.50:  Yeah, so.  It's easy to do.  I'm actually interested in getting one of
those, kind of, my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of
years, one of those kind of campers that pop-up.  So, it's about, uh, maybe
eight foot square and, but only about two feet tall and when you get to where
you're going it raises up and there's tenting material,

A.51:  Oh, yeah, that folds out from it, it's like a crank up top thing.

B.52:  Yes, exactly.

A.53:  Yo-, yeah, it's, you're talking of a trailer type,

B.54:  Y-,

A.55:  that you pull? 

B.56:  Exactly.

A.57:  Huh, yeah, okay.

B.58:  My wife has a lot of interest in those and I've actually been keeping my
eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand
dollars.

A.59:  Yeah, yeah,  

B.60:  Which, 

A.61:  you can, that's about the price of them up here.  They're, they're, uh,
s-, Sears sells them, Coleman sells them.

B.62:  Sure.    

A.63:  They have some, some good buys on them.   

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  And those are pretty nice.  I, they're, they're have a little galley, a
little, uh, sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and, uh, and a
little stove that's like a ((propane's stove)).

B.66:  Uh-huh.   

A.67:  Couple of little cabinets and, and, uh, sleeping (( )) on either end of
the, the canvas when you open it up it's just all screened in so it's pretty
neat, uh,

B.68:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah that's,  

A.69:  the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very, very convenient to
travel on the highway with because it's very low.

B.70:  I see.   

A.71:  ((Mine)) is like pulling a big house behind me, you know [laughter].

B.72:  Oh, yeah.  You said yours is eighteen feet long?    

A.73:  [Cough] Yeah,  

B.74:  What,

A.75:  an eighteen foot Terry, uh, it's completely self-contained.  I mean, I
have everything, a shower, T V, everything in it,

B.76:  Oh, yeah.  Y-, y-, 

A.77:  you know and,

B.78:  The brand is Terry?

A.79:  Yeah, T E R R Y, Terry.   

B.80:  Oh, I'd never heard of it.   

A.81:  Well, they're, I guess, they're pretty popular up this way.  You know, it's
a pretty rugged trailer.  It's a tandem wheel even though it's only
eighteen foot long so there's, it drags pretty good, you know, with a car,

B.82:  Yeah.   

A.83:  but I've got a big Oldsmobile that I pull it with when I [laughter],

B.84:  Yeah, well, that's neat. 

A.85:  uh, if I get rid of that I'll have to get rid of the trailer because I
don't, I'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the ((hills up
here)) [laughter],

B.86:  Oh, yeah, that's something.   

A.87:  kind of hilly country up through this way wh-, 

B.88:  Yeah.   

A.89:  Um,

B.90:  Yeah, well, that's great.   

A.91:  Well, uh, I, I like camping I, I did a lot of it, I, when my kids were
small, of course, they're all grown now and gone.  I've got four boys and
they've kind of all gone, and we don't really do that together much anymore as
they've out, two are out in California and two are still in Texas, so, we kind
of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little
fishing but,

B.92:  Right.   

A.93:  I wished I had the opportunity to do camping because I used to love to
live at the lake all summer,

B.94:  Oh, yeah.   

A.95:  and into the fall and, 

B.96:  Yeah.   

A.97:  uh, it was kind of pretty nice, but, uh, I just wish that I had an
opportunity to do a little more.

B.98:  That's right [laughter].  And it,  

A.99:  The thing that I, I, then again, I, I tried pulling the trailer one year
and I went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff, but that
got to be a hassle, you know, breaking down,

B.100:  Right.   

A.101:  and setting up and breaking down.  So, I decided that I would lease a
sp-, a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England,

B.102:  Uh-huh.   

A.103:  and go there every, every spring and stay there all summer and it really
worked out good for me.

B.104:  And, and you c-, and you still do that?   

A.105:  Oh, yeah, yeah.   

B.106:  And so you drive to work from there?   

A.107:  Yeah.   

B.108:  Or you just take the summer off?   

A.109:  No, I drive from the campground.   

B.110:  Oh, wow, that's nice.   

A.111:  ((Which, uh,)), it adds maybe twenty miles, uh, you know, uh, each way but
it's not all that much.

B.112:  Yeah.   

A.113:  Uh, twenty miles is goi-, is just going a little different way.  It's
probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work.  I live in Rhode
Island, work in Massachusetts but,

B.114:  I see.   

A.115:  it's, uh, it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get
to the campground and be, just be out in the country and woods all by yourself
or, you know, with just a few neighbors around or so.

B.116:  Right.   

A.117:  And that's, that's pretty nice because you can fish and just,

B.118:  Well, I envy that.  What a great life [laughter].   

A.119:  Yeah, well [laughter], like I say, just a, I, I enjoy doing that, I wished
I had more time to do it,

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  but hopefully I can get up a retirement here before too much longer and
then,

B.122:  {Very faint} Huh. 

A.123:  I'll be looking forward to, to like I say win-, Winnebago because of the
older you get the less things you want to do.

B.124:  I understand and [throat_clearing],  

A.125:  I don't want to let the, I don't want to let the canopy down, I don't want
to jack it up [laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter] that's right. 

A.127:  I don't want to do all that stuff anymore,

B.128:  Just want to get in and,

A.129:  I just want to (( )) and just turn the key off and get in the back and do
whatever [laughter].

B.130:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's funny.  Well,

A.131:  But, uh, it's been nice, uh, like I really appreciate talking with you and,

B.132:  Nice talking to you too.   

A.133:  I thought I'd give you a call on my lunch time here today and,

B.134:  Well, I appreciate it.   

A.135:  worked out good.  Ye-, 

B.136:  And good luck with your, uh, your fut-, your hopes of buy a Winnebago
[laughter].

@@A.137:  Uh, I, I thank you very much, you're ever up this way [breathing], look
me up here at T I in Attleboro.

B.138:  I'll do it.  Nice talking to you, Ray.   

A.139:  ((Thank you, sir)). 

B.140:  Bye-bye.
