===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess we're on the air now.   

B.2:  Right.   

A.3:  Uh, I haven't had too much experience with, uh, judges and jurors.  I've,
uh, served on a jury one time and, uh, I think one of my concerns after that
experience was uh, finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't
bring themselves to sentence someone.

B.4:  Yes, I, I have, my primary experience has been as, uh, an expert witness
a-, and, uh, and two murder trials.

A.5:  Um.   

B.6:  And, uh, in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each
time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be, uh, death.  But,
in terms of I, well, the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or
mandatory sentences for, uh, certain crimes.  I think, depending on, uh, in
certain crimes, I think that they should be mandatory.  For example, uh, armed
robbery, uh, if we have convicted, I think, uh, plea bargaining should, should
be, uh, a thing of the past.  Uh, certain types of, uh, you know, homicides.

A.7:  Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.  You do need a, uh, fixed and clear sentence
there.

B.8:  Yes, in, in homicides related to other than I guess what are called, uh,
crimes of passion, uh, for example, you know, as you, as you very well know,
the great majority of homicides are people murdering other people they know --

A.9:  Yeah.   

B.10:  -- mostly people they know.  So in those instances, uh, that's, uh, I think
that there is some leeway there.  What wa-, is interesting in this regard is
the recent case in New Hampshire --

A.11:  Yes.  

B.12:  -- the schoolteacher, 

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  and the life sentence, uh, she received.   

A.15:  Yeah, I think that was a logical decision there.   

B.16:  Yes, [laughter] and it came very quickly, surprisingly.   

A.17:  Uh-huh.   

B.18:  Uh, I guess it was, uh, they brought in their verdict and sentence at the
same time, did they not?

A.19:  Well, yeah, I think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence --

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  -- uh, but that was, that was fairly quick.  I think that is something that
we need in this country.  I know the last time I was down in the Caribbean,
uh, we had visited the island of, uh, Saint Thomas which is American, and
there were twenty-three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about
it.

B.22:  Um.   

A.23:  At the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of Tortola,
and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place.

B.24:  [Laughter]  Well, in answer to, you know, answer to the question, though,
I still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury, even though,
as you say, there are some, uh, people who are reluctant.  I do not think,
again, in the matter of, uh, uh, that, that judges should have the, {pause}
uh, {pause} the upper hand or the only hand in that sense [breathing]
because I think if, but I, I've never served on a jury, you probably know this
better than I, uh, {pause} if the jury does their job and, of course, there
are those on the jury that do not, I'm sure, but, and ask the questions and,
uh, correctly, and then one of things I've always wondered is, uh, the ability
of jurors to, to ask questions.

A.25:  I've never, uh, really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a
question.

B.26:  Well, that, that, that, and that's an interesting point.  I've never, I,
you know, I've thought about it, I've asked myself, you know, this question
before.  I've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own
question, but I know that at least during the deliberations of the jury --

A.27:  Uh-huh.   

B.28:  -- they can ask questions.   

A.29:  Yes.  I don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that,
though.  It's, it depends on the, the tr-, they can ask, uh, points of order
of law --

B.30:  Uh-huh.   

A.31:  -- and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript.  

B.32:  Right.   

A.33:  Uh, but, uh, asking questions during the trial, my experience as a juror,
uh, well, it was a traffic situation, uh, there were three points of law that
had to be made.  And the County Attorney did not make the points.

B.34:  Uh-huh.   

A.35:  But, the, uh, defendant took the stand on his own behalf and unfortunately
[laughter], he made the points himself in his own testimony.

@@B.36:  Uh-huh.  May I ask you a question?   

A.37:  Uh-huh.   

B.38:  Why does your voice sound familiar to me?   

A.39:  Uh, I work for E Systems.   

B.40:  That's, [laughter] that's probably why it does.  I work for G T E.

A.41:  Okay.   

B.42:  [Laughter] Your, your voice when, uh, I didn't recognize the name, but the
more I listen to your voice, I, uh, I know I have heard it somewhere and I was
trying to place where I had heard it.  That's very interesting.  But, now back
to the topic.

A.43:  Okay [laughter].   

B.44:  [Laughter] But, uh, because I work for, uh, Hal ((Ammon)). 

A.45:  Oh, I know Hal ((Ammon)) quite well.   

B.46:  Yes, I am on staff to Hal ((Ammon)) to G T E.   

A.47:  Okay.   

B.48:  [Laughter] So,  

A.49:  Well, say hi to Al, or Hal the next time you see him.   

B.50:  I, [laughter] I will,  

A.51:  And tell,

B.52:  and, which will probably be t-, uh, Monday as a matter of fact.

A.53:  Yeah, well, tell him that Bill Mayhood sell h-,, said hi.  

B.54:  Okay Bill, I recognize the name now.  I and, uh, my name is Jim Moscow.

A.55:  Okay.   

B.56:  And, uh, so I've heard the name and, uh, well, back to the topic
[laughter].  I guess we've talked long enough, Bill.

A.57:  All right.   

B.58:  But, uh, all right.  Well thank you for calling and nice, and have a good
weekend.

A.59:  Thank you, goodnight.   

B.60:  Good-bye.
