=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I, uh, before I was married, I used to play a lot of sports.

B.2:  Uh-huh.   

A.3:  And, uh, but when I got married [laughter] and had children and everything,
it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my
obligations so I haven't done a lot of, uh, exercise on purpose.

B.4:  Uh-huh.   

A.5:  What about you?   

B.6:  Well, it's funny, this week, yesterday I started exercising seriously.

A.7:  Oh, really?   

B.8:  This weekend I cleaned out my closets and, uh, [lipsmack] a couple years
ago I, too, got married.  I haven't have any children yet, but [breathing]
this weekend I cleaned out some closets and I found a bathing suit that I had
bought.

A.9:  Uh-huh.   

B.10:  [Laughter] Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on
me.

A.11:  [Laughter] Oh no, that can be awful.   

B.12:  So yesterday I went to, uh, a spa. I belong to a private spa and went in
and, and got with a trainer and, uh, he checked body fat content --

A.13:  Uh-huh.   

B.14:  -- and we set up a program for me to work on, and I went back tonight also.

A.15:  Oh, that's good.  

B.16:  So I've been two nights in a row and I, I'm going to take it pretty
seriously.  I'm going to start going every night just, you know, even if I, I,
like tonight I only went for thirty minutes,

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  but I at least did something.   

A.19:  Do you work out on, like, is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is
it?

B.20:  Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few, like,
three different types of, uh, uh, weight lifting for my legs and,

A.21:  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  and my hips --  

A.23:  Uh-huh.   

B.24:  -- and then I did a hour of aerobics.    

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And that was really tough [laughter].   

A.27:  Oh, I bet.   

B.28:  And I was sore this morning when I got up, but then tonight I got into a,
a, it's sort of like an aerobics class --

A.29:  Uh-huh.   

B.30:  -- but it's only thirty minutes and it's for your abdominals --

A.31:  Uh-huh.   

B.32:  -- your thighs, and your butt.   

A.33:  Um.   

B.34:  So, and that was, thirty minutes was definitely plenty.   

A.35:  [Laughter].  

B.36:  So,   

A.37:  Doesn't sound like low impact.   

B.38:  No, it was a lot of sweat but,

A.39:  Well.  

B.40:  I've been trying to eat correctly also.   

A.41:  Well that's good.    

B.42:  So,

A.43:  So are you moti-, 

B.44:  Have you started exercising at home or,

A.45:  Well, I, like, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do
exercise, but I like to, uh, play tennis and play racquetball --

B.46:  Uh-huh.   

A.47:  -- I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort, and so
that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, uh, the shape that I
was satisfied with at least.  And, uh, then I have given that up, but, uh, I
would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a
position that I like myself.

B.48:  Uh-huh.   

A.49:  I don't feel good and I get, you know, when you get out of shape and you
don't, if, you're easily tired --

B.50:  Uh-huh.   

A.51:  -- and so that has made me, but I, I'm not the kind of person that could go
to a spa --

B.52:  Yeah.   

A.53:  -- and work out, I just, if something like, uh, I mean I have so many
chores and so many --

B.54:  Uh-huh.    

A.55:  -- obligations every day for, to add another obligation -- 

B.56:  Yeah.   

A.57:  -- would make me feel stressed.   

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

A.59:  And I wouldn't enjoy it.  But if I have something, some team sport or some
activity, then it's kind of like having fun,

B.60:  Yeah.   

A.61:  playing and then you, then you get some of the, uh, good exercise and
some of the desired results, but you, you're doing it for fun.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.   

A.63:  But I really admire people who can go and work out and,

B.64:  Well, I don't, you know, a lot of people, I have a girlfriend that goes for
the social aspect of it --

A.65:  Uh-huh.   

B.66:  -- and she walks around, talks to people and [breathing], and, I don't
really get into that.  Naturally I'm married --

A.67:  Uh-huh.   

B.68:  -- so my husband goes a lot and we'll go and, and just do what we want to
do and then leave.

A.69:  Well, that's nice.   

B.70:  But, yeah, and swimming is a, is a part that I, I'd like to get into as far
as my [breathing], you know, just aerobic activity --

A.71:  Uh-huh.   

B.72:  -- they say that swimming is real good, so I'd like to try that as well.
And that's probably something that, that you could do, you know --

A.73:  Yes.   

B.74:  -- family, 

A.75:  It is kind,

B.76:  included.   

A.77:  It is family, and it's fun.   

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  It's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and [breathing] and all.  And also,
the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the
relaxation, you know, like saunas, or [laughter] --

B.80:  Yeah.   

A.81:  -- you know, uh, hot Jacuzzis or whatever,  

B.82:  Right.   

A.83:  they have that kind of is, kind of makes it fun and stuff, you know, you
can relax that way,

B.84:  Uh-huh.   

A.85:  afterwards and things.   

B.86:  Yeah.  I agree [breathing].  

A.87:  Well, I guess it's getting late.  

B.88:  Yeah.    

A.89:  And I should take off, but, uh, I appreciate that, that helped me, helped
motivate me [laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter] Okay.   

A.91:  Think someone can do it.   

B.92:  Yeah.   

A.93:  Maybe I should start thinking about it again.   

B.94:  Well, try it or, or maybe just exercise at home.  I bought a tape, and I'm
going to try doing that.

A.95:  Yeah, I bought one, I went to the, I bought the low impact first.  I
thought,

B.96:  Uh-huh.   

A.97:  I shouldn't out of the blue just jump in.  

B.98:  Yeah, that's me.   

A.99:  So, but I haven't done it.   

B.100:  Uh-huh.   

A.101:  But I'm going to try it.  Well you have a good night.   

B.102:  Thanks a lot.   

A.103:  We'll see you.  Bye-bye.   

B.104:  Bye-bye.
