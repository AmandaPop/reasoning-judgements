===============================================================================

A.1:  So, what kind of eating out do you like?

B.2:  Oh, preferably Mexican food or seafood.

A.3:  Yeah, I, I like seafood, or Chinese, or especially Mongolian.  We've got a
real nice little Mongolian restaurant here.

B.4:  Oh, really.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Um.

A.7:  I go out there probably once a week.

B.8:  Wow.

A.9:  It's not bad, you know, you have to find out the right things to get --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- so you can get the most for your money.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  But, the two mea-, the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a
pretty good deal.

B.14:  Oh, yeah, we haven't found a who-, you know, the best Mexican food we've
found is back in Houston.

A.15:  Naturally.

B.16:  And, uh, same goes for the seafood, of course.  

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  There's not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere.

A.19:  No.

B.20:  But, uh, I think our luxury here is Red Lobster --

A.21:  Oh, yeah.

B.22:  -- and, but back home there's, you know, different places, family owned --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- seafood restaurants.

A.25:  Do you have a Steak and Ale there.

B.26:  Uh, not close, about an hour away --

A.27:  Um.

B.28:  -- in Waco there's the closest one.

A.29:  I haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time, but my favorite used to be
their steak and, uh, Alaskan king crab.  Oh, that was good.

B.30:  Yeah, uh, it's been a while since I've been there.  I was always, jumped on
the steak whenever I went there --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- instead of the seafood.

A.33:  Yeah, they had, they had really nice Alaskan king crab.  Of course it was
expensive, though, dinner for two was about fifty bucks.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  So.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  And now that I'm full time poor student, I got to watch the pennies.

B.38:  Yeah [laughter].

A.39:  Consequently that's why you go out to Mongolian all the time.

B.40:  Oh, so.  No, I pretty, you know, Mexican food or, or seafood pretty much, I
could probably live on that.

A.41:  Yeah, I haven't found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere I'm
at.  I usually do all my own Mexican food.

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  Like, I'm partial to burritos and tacos.

B.44:  There you go.

A.45:  And, and I do them better than anywhere I've had out, so, and I can do them
cheaper, and I can do them my way.

B.46:  Yeah, right, right.

A.47:  And (( )),

B.48:  Well, what do you [barking] like about your, your Chinese food place there
that makes you keep going back?

A.49:  Basically the food and the price.  I, it's sort, it's set up on a sort of a
buffet sort of thing.  You go up and pick your own vegetables and all that,
fill up your own plate.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And then you drop it off at the, uh, grill --

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  -- and then go sit down.  And they, they fry it out and season it the way
you want it seasoned, and then they bring it out to you.  And the price is
really reasonable.  The drawback is that, all the, uh, all the staff are, uh,
uh, either Koreans or, uh, Thais, and they can't speak English very well.

B.54:  Oh.

A.55:  So it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain some things to them.
But if you can get past that, it's okay.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  The food is really good.  I don't know, I, to me that's the thing you got
to have.  If the food is bad, you're obviously not going to go back.

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  But if the food is good, and the price is decent, and the service is lousy,
I have a tough time going back again.

B.60:  Yeah, uh,

A.61:  I mean, it's not worth the hassle just for the good food.  There's plenty
of places that have good food.

B.62:  Right.  Yeah, uh, there's, there's a couple places around here that we'll
go back to now and again.  Um, [throat_clearing] one being a Chinese food
place and, and another being another Mexican food place, and it just seems
that, if the, if the help is, is good, and they're like they're supposed to
be, that, you know, you're tempted to give the food a second try.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  But not the people --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- for some reason.

A.67:  Yeah, I, I hardly ever give the people a second try.  If somebody's rude to
me, or [cough] excuse me, somebody's rude, or something like that, I won't go
back, I don't care how good the food was.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  But generally I, I, the places I've been where I've had trouble with the
help, generally the food hasn't been that good anyway.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  Which is sort of indicative of the whole problem.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  Well gosh.  

B.74:  Now what?  [laughter].

A.75:  Now what?  I guess it's been about five minutes.

B.76:  How long, do you eat, do you go out once a week?

A.77:  I try to go out once a week, sometimes more than that.  About every other
weekend I go down to Charlotte and see my, my ex-college buddy down there, and
we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down
there to eat.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  We've got a family, there's a family restaurant here, I don't know if
they're over in Texas yet.  I know they're in Louisiana.  It's called Ryan's.
Um, it's, it's a good restaurant.  They, uh, they have like a big food bar --

B.80:  Um.

A.81:  -- and you can order from the menu or just take the food bar.  And the food
bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- and they've just got tons of stuff.  And it's really cheap.  One person
for about, it's about six bucks.

B.84:  Wow.

A.85:  And it's all you can eat.  And the food is good.  And of course, you, your
service is pretty good because it's serve yourself.

B.86:  Yeah, right.  So you can't complain about that, really.

A.87:  Can't complain too much.  They have people come around and, uh, deliver
your, your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill
up your iced tea.  But other than that they don't, they don't bother you.  So,
it's a pretty good place.  Bet you don't have those over there.

B.88:  I don't think so.  I haven't heard of it.

A.89:  We have, uh, there's two of them in Charlotte, and we've been to both of
them, and they're both terrible.

B.90:  Oh, no.

A.91:  It was, it was, I was amazed, because I've been in a lot of Ryan's in
Alabama and Georgia, and this is my first time in one in North Carolina, and
they were terrible.

B.92:  Oh.

A.93:  [Throat_clearing] And we got one in Raleigh here, and I thought it was
pretty bad until I had gone to those ones in Charlotte.

B.94:  [Laughter] Made you reconsider.

A.95:  Yeah, we figured this is probably the best one.  

B.96:  Oh.

A.97:  But uh, it's a pretty neat chain, because they, they don't take out loans
for anything.  They, when they build a building, they pay for it right then.

B.98:  Um.

A.99:  So that when they open the door they're making money immediately.

B.100:  Right.  Well that's a good way to go about it.

A.101:  It's a smart operation.

B.102:  Yeah, there's, there's kind of a, a little place set up like that, I know
that they've got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in, uh, Houston.  It's
called You Are Cook,

A.103:  [Laughter].

B.104:  and that's exactly what you are.  It turned out it's a cattle rancher
who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle.  So it's an ongoing circle --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- you know, and you, you get your all your salad, and everything for your
salad is at one part of the restaurant, and then everything for a baked potato
and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section.  And then
right smack in the middle is these three huge grills, that they have set up
for the people to use, and you go in and you pick out your own selection of
meat, that you want to cook, you know, filet or T bone or whatever it is --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and they're just huge, you know, the meat is just massive --

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  -- just massive.  I think the smal-, the smallest they have is, uh, is I
think a nine ounce filet.  I mean, just, we're taking doggy bags home every
time we go.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  And it's, it's, it's like twelve dollars a person, but you are, you're
getting --

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  -- three or four meals out of it --

A.115:  Exactly,

B.116:  -- by the time you take it home.

A.117:  And then you cook it yourself?

B.118:  Yeah, you take it up to the grill and you flip it, or they'll cook it,
they'll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you.

A.119:  Gosh, that's half the fun, cooking it yourself.

B.120:  Yeah, it's really a lot of fun, they'll get up there.

A.121:  Well, that's, that's an interesting sounding place.

B.122:  Yeah, season it and throw it on the grill and, and, sit around and, and
just talk while it's cooking, and some people go back and eat their salads and
leave it there.  Most people stay up there so they get to take --

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  -- their own [laughter] steak back that they paid for.  But, uh, it's
really neat.  I never thought it would go over much.  Because I don't want to
cook my own dinner, I want to go out and, you know, pay for it.  But it's
really a neat,

A.125:  Yeah that sounds pretty neat,

B.126:  really a neat phenomena how it all works out.

A.127:  It'd be worth giving a try.

B.128:  Yeah, if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try.

A.129:  Pretty interesting.  I've never heard of anything like that.

B.130:  Yeah, I'm not sure where all, you know, he's, Texas bound, obviously.

A.131:  Yeah.

B.132:  Because I haven't heard him go any farther than those three cities.  But
that, it's really neat too.

A.133:  Huh.  That's a unique idea.  I gue-, I guess that's part of the game
nowadays in fast food, you got to come up with some catchy idea.

B.134:  Yeah, yeah, and it's, it's and I, and you know the fact that it's his own
cattle,

A.135:  Yeah,

B.136:  it's just an ongoing,

A.137:  he, he surely doesn't have to worry about supply.

B.138:  Right.

A.139:  That's a pretty good idea, huh.  Maybe I'll start a restaurant now.

B.140:  Yeah, yeah, you got all these tips.

A.141:  [Laughter] I don't know if I trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything
though.

B.142:  [Laughter].

A.143:  Probably burn the place down.

B.144:  Oh, I bet you can't get, find Mexican food over there.  I had always
wondered what I'd do if I lived somewhere other than Texas.

A.145:  Well, come to say, I've never even seen a Mexican here.

B.146:  Oh, well.

A.147:  We got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis, but, gosh.

B.148:  Um.

A.149:  Oh well.  Well I guess that about does it on the fast food circuit, doesn't
it.

B.150:  I guess so.

A.151:  [Laughter] Some of the subjects, I tell you.

B.152:  Yeah, well, they've, they've been a lot worse [laughter].

A.153:  [Laughter] It was good talking to you, Jackie.

B.154:  You too, Dave, 

A.155:  You have a good night.

B.156:  You too.  Bye-bye.
