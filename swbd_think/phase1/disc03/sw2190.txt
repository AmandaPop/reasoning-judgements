REMARKS:        This was very difficult to transcribe.  Both 
speakers had a tendency to not finish their sentences and 
constantly interrupted each other.  Their sentences were full of
fragments.  

========================================================================

@A.1:  Oh, go ahead I, I am glad to talk to an expert.  I always wanted to know
who an expert was.

B.2:  Oh, well, I'm not an expert, I just had a little, I've, I've seen a little
pollution in my time.  It's, uh, the, the chemicals we were dealing with were,
uh, a Raid repellent and, uh, that was really quite dangerous, I'm not certain
that that was, that, that's really a pollution issue.  I think pollution issue
is, is, uh, is, is the argument over, over people catching, uh, things like,
uh, respiratory disease.

A.3:  Uh, well, there, there's two things, uh, the one I'm interested the most, I
guess, myself, uh, would be the, the Freons ((I mean)), for ((air cond-,)) the
one, I guess, that's the one I'm most curious about is how they're going to
replace the Freons in air-conditioning.  That seemed to be the biggest
surprise to me and whether, when they replace it, you know, they're going to
really come up with something that is not just as bad.

B.4:  Well, the, you know, that, that's another arguable issue and I, I've seen
the, uh, uh, uh, assuming you can buy into global warming I bi-, 

A.5:  Yeah, I, uh, was, uh, you know, where they were all concerned about that,
but that, that it seems to be,

B.6:  Well, did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES on, uh, when he was talking
about when if, if the, if the war started in, in Kuwait and they'd set those,
uh, all th-,

A.7:  No, I heard about it though.

B.8:  uh, it was, it was, it was interesting but, uh, I'm just curious what he
has to say now that they've got them all lit.

A.9:  Was that before, I didn't see it, was that before they actually did that or
it was w-,

B.10:  Yes.  And his argument was, uh, was that, that you would see a, uh, a year
with no summer.

A.11:  #Because of that,#  

B.12:  #Which actually happened.# 

A.13:  you know. 

B.14:  And it, it ac-, yes, it actually happened, uh, it was a volcano erupted and
it was high enough up but, uh, they had some people from the national
meteorological center I think it was (( )) which is the national, anyway,
research people and they said that the, uh, that the pollution would not go
high enough.  And it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his
billions and #billions of stars,#

A.15:  #Right.#   

B.16:  may have once made a mistake, but th-, th-, th-, the, the com-, the
general, the opinion among, among the, uh, meteorologists at, uh, I'm, uh,
member of the American Meteorological Society, and an-, 

A.17:  Are you d-, you didn't work at T I?   

B.18:  Yeah, I do.   

A.19:  Oh, okay.   

B.20:  But I'm, uh, I, th-, I did that in my (( )). 

A.21:  Where do you work in research, or 

B.22:  No, I'm a planner, a production planner.   

A.23:  Oh, okay.   

B.24:  But I, I, I'm in the active reserves as a weatherman, so.   

A.25:  Oh, #okay, yeah.#   

B.26:  #Uh,# I, I keep up from time to time, but what the, the argument is that, uh,
that, uh, maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is.  But, um, if
there is, uh, we probably could do something about it now,

A.27:  Yeah.   

B.28:  and if there isn't, if there isn't and we do some the right things, I
think, how do you feel about, about all this smog and th-, stuff on cars.

A.29:  Uh, well, I'm kind of a car buff myself, I was going to ask you another
question, but, uh, I-, I'll do that in a minute.  I, I think that the
changing, you know, from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage, #you know,
no-, not using# ...

B.30:  #Well, do you have an# older car?   

A.31:  No, no, no.   

B.32:  I, I have been working on an older car #but it to-, yeah.# 

A.33:  #Really?  Oh, I'm a car# buff too, we ought to wor-, talk about that one day,
uh, uh,

B.34:  Well, I'm restoring one.   

A.35:  I think you can use the, you can use high, you know, the ninety-two
percent, uh, ninety-two octane I don't think you'll have any trouble.

B.36:  I'm not having any problem it's a seventy.   

A.37:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.   

B.38:  And the.

A.39:  No, I, I think, uh, I, uh, work on my own cars and, uh, I don't think
that's a problem.  I thought, I'm saying, I was glad to get rid of leaded
gasoline, 'n. 

B.40:  But did you have another ques-, you said you had another quest-,

A.41:  Uh, oh, ye-, i-, the same thing about the war, uh, or related to the war
on, I was watching C N N and I cannot remember what station it was, what, did
you see the advertisements, uh, where they talked about nuclear war, what that
would have been like in changing the atmosphere, it is so scary that I hope
that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total
disaster, you know.

B.42:  Uh, e-,

A.43:  Did you see any of those, uh, I, it was, 

B.44:  No, I didn't see ((that)), that, I know that the, uh, that's ...

A.45:  It must have been channel thirteen, I don't recall, although, I thought it
was on C N N, oh, I,

B.46:  Well, that, they ((called nuclear winner)) and, and I suppose that's,
that's the ultimate, uh, pollution problem.

A.47:  It was a somewhat of a commercial because it c-, I saw it regularly and it
showed that and it was really devastating and, ((it would, uh)),

B.48:  #Well it,#  

A.49:  #how much# ash would fall and, and how it would essentially literally
destroy the world, you know.

B.50:  Well, (( )) the Chernobyl accident, uh, actually, um, because the
circulation budget as high as it went, uh, covered, uh, a fairly remarkable
amount they did some tracers and they I, I think it's ((drawn)) in, uh, I
think, gets in there (( )) I can't think of the other trace, but I saw a, a
presentation on, on that and they, it went quite a long ways but I, I, I guess
I can be a little sympathetic but, you know, there's some argument that in,
in, in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that's the,
uh, the pine trees giving off pollution and,

A.51:  Oh, really, yeah, there, there's probably a lot of natural things, uh,

B.52:  But the, but when you se-, when you get up in the morning in, in Dallas
and, and see all that haze from west Texas,

A.53:  Yeah.   

B.54:  is that, is that pollution?   

A.55:  Uh, it, I guess it's got to be really, I don't know, I don't know if it's
air pollution it's, uh, it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not I
don't know.

B.56:  Well, it, that's the thing is that I think, I think Dallas really does have
a problem in this, the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel, burning fuel,
the problem is, is it's like Los Angeles.  People don't, people don't want to
use mass transit, so.

A.57:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, well, I live in Arlington and there, there, there are no
buses.  I mean, there, there is, the only school bus, the only buses you see
are school buses, so.

B.58:  But who wants to, who wants to, um, ride a bus?   

A.59:  Well, I know it, it's, uh, you know, the car is, we have this big romance
with the car, but, uh, I think people are, would be interested if you had one,
I mean.

B.60:  Well, my boss drives forty miles one way each day.

A.61:  Yeah.   

B.62:  And one of the guys that works with me drives forty-five miles.

A.63:  Yeah.   

B.64:  And, and they don't think it, well, I guess they do think something of it
but, um, not even to, you know, you consider how much, um, but then you get
into all these issues of, of whether it, it's the types of pollution and what
it's doing to your lungs and,

A.65:  Yeah.    

B.66:  are we going to die of, of respiratory, so, we all move out of the, out
of downtown so we get away from the, the smog.  My, my wife grew up in
southern California and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles, uh,
wh-, when the valley was clean.

A.67:  Yeah.   

B.68:  And now the valley is not and so people move out ((one more)) valley and,

A.69:  Well, you said you were car buff, uh, I think that, uh, all of us could use
one electric car right now, I mean, today,

B.70:  Yes, yes. 

A.71:  because I think, uh, you said people drive forty miles and fifty
whatever, yeah, when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but
I think we all could, in a family, say, have an electric car where my, one of
my daughters or my wife, my wife, she could use one now if they had one, you
know,

B.72:  Well, do ... 

A.73:  because they, she don't even, she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the
car.

B.74:  General Motors apparently has one that they're, they're testing, I think
it's, no, it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing (( )).

A.75:  No, no, you're right.  I, (( )) I have seen them but, uh, they have a
battery car.

B.76:  But they #suppose,#

A.77:  #Uh,# I went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse, now
that I think of it, and I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to
ask anybody, there were no electric cars.  I was surprised but now that you
just mentioned that.

B.78:  Huh.  ((Well, the)) ROAD and TRACK was talking about that this, apparently
General Motors has some, uh, they apparently think they're close.

A.79:  Yeah.  I, I think, uh, there could be a lot of ((peo-, I thi-,)) people
close this is really, we're, we're nine years away or less, I guess, from the
next century and I think,

B.80:  ((Well, th-,)) there's still a lot of research, I was over in, in the
((research)) lab a couple, I guess, it's been about a month ago and saw this,
(( )) research ((it was a little light)) that says solar, solar powered
research.

A.81:  Yeah, they've got a, they've got a area over in, the ((S M)) building too
which is, uh, but it's a solar, uh, it's for, uh, ((the-, g-,)) ((gots)) some
money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for, you
know, uh, electricity, a hundred and twenty volt or whatever.

B.82:  Yeah.  Well, do you work in that C building?

A.83:  No, I'm actually in the south building but, uh,  

B.84:  Oh, ((I'm at)),

A.85:  I was, uh, I'm the ((facility)) so I've been in all, most of the
buildings anyway.

B.86:  Oh, well, I'm in, I'm in ((the)) C building, been there for, #all my life.#

A.87:  #Oh, yeah, well,# the, the solar area is right, right around from the
auditorium now.  And it, they've got several different, uh, areas where
they're called solar lab.  It's,

B.88:  Huh.   

A.89:  right there on the first floor you look, walk by there.   

B.90:  Well, that's been a ((con-,)) I know the focal plain array is they were
taking space to, a long time.

A.91:  Yeah, but the solar project, you know, T I's been into it for years, and I
guess it's just not, uh, economical yet because of the other fuels.

B.92:  Well, the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon, you know, who wants to,
yeah, I mean, we want to not pollute, but, uh, at a dollar a gallon, uh, it's
hard to beat,

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  the amount of energy you get from, uh,

A.95:  I've seen some.  I think ((then again I'm surprised now I didn't)) think
they'd asked anybody when I was in the auto show.  There was nothing, uh, and
there was no, d-, place for air pollution or companies or anyone there.  It
was just pure automobiles.

B.96:  Well, I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol,

A.97:  There?   

B.98:  they had one with spots on it and something. 

A.99:  Huh.   

B.100:  I didn't go but i-, wa-, it was showing they, I mean, uh,  

A.101:  I didn't see,   

B.102:  an article.    

A.103:  did you go?   

B.104:  No, I didn't,  

A.105:  Oh.   

B.106:  I didn't go, so.  I wh-,

A.107:  Uh, I was, uh, quite impressed with all the cars, you know, the engines are
so much smaller now and everything and they're, they all have brand new
engines, even General Motors, uh, very few only the Caprice and them and the
Cadillac had eight, ((uh, the old)) V-eights, they're all brand new engines,
uh, of course, they're burning gasoline, of course.

B.108:  They've done a lot.   

A.109:  Yeah, and, uh, whether, you know, that's one way, you know, uh, uh, f-, on
air pollution I, I, I don't know if the automobiles are the biggest
contributor or not really.  They've got catalytic converters, everyone seem to
have gone to that, whether they last, uh, and do a good job and now that they,
the inspection systems are analyzing that, uh, well, what do you think if
you're in that, you know, if you're concerned about that,

B.110:  Well, ther-,

A.111:  I mean, if you're, you're, you're knowledgeable on that.   

@@B.112:  Well, they, uh, it's interesting though because my cars are older and so
I didn't have to, if you live in Dallas County you have to have your, have to
have it checked and it's (( )), I had a friend with a Fiero that, uh, they
tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that
((pinned)) and, so, apparently ...
