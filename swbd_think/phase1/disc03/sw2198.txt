===========================================================================

B.1:  So what movies have you seen lately?

A.2:  So, I really haven't seen any movies lately.  I, the only two movies I've
seen were, uh, uh, KING RALPH which really was depressing, wasn't any, any
good.

B.3:  Oh, it was bad?

A.4:  Yeah.

B.5:  Oh, that's disappointing,

A.6:  And,

B.7:  I was thinking about going to see that.   

A.8:  Well, it's not worth the whatever five bucks or four, four fifty, whatever
you pay for, you know,

B.9:  Yeah.   

A.10:  to get into the movie.  But,  

B.11:  Wait for it to come out on videotape, I guess.  What's the other one?

A.12:  Yeah, yeah, or, I saw ((CHIMA PARA DISO)).   

B.13:  Oh, say that again.   

A.14:  ((CHIMA PARA DISO)).   

B.15:  What's that?   

A.16:  It's a foreign film.   

B.17:  Uh-huh.   

A.18:  It's a, an Italian film about, uh, this guy who, uh, who from when he was a
little kid, like ten years old.

B.19:  Uh-huh.  Oh, CINEMA PARA ((DE SIMO)).   

A.20:  Yeah.   

B.21:  Oh, okay, because you're saying it with a, you're saying it,

A.22:  Italian accent.   

B.23:  little Italian, oh, are you Italian?   

A.24:  Yeah.   

B.25:  Oh, okay, that's why, go ahead.   

A.26:  Yeah, it's , it's about a movie about, you know, this guy who was running
a, a movie --

B.27:  Uh-huh.   

A.28:  -- you know, movie studio, whatever, he ran, 

B.29:  Yeah, I saw it, too.   

A.30:  he ran a machine. 

B.31:  Yeah.   

A.32:  That was pretty good, didn't you think so? 

B.33:  It was, I really liked it.  My wife and I loved it.  Yeah. 

A.34:  I thought, yeah, I thought that most Americans might not like it, because,
you know, of it's, it's not that good of a quality film, but, I mean, it's the
meaning behind it that I liked.

B.35:  Uh-huh.  Yep, that's true.  Yeah, it had a really, uh, I thought the story
was really nice and I thought, uh, the guy that played the projectionist I
just thought was superb.  You know, he was,

A.36:  Uh-huh.   

B.37:  great.  Uh, and the little boy was good, too.   

A.38:  I, I thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person, you
know, from when he was a little kid,

B.39:  Uh-huh.    

A.40:  to little older to little older, t-, except the last, the very last, you
know, the last person, the last actor that played the kid, you know, when he
had gray hair,

B.41:  Yeah. 

A.42:  he didn't look anything like him.  But you know, up until that point they
did a really good job of keeping, you know,

B.43:  Yeah.   

A.44:  an actor.   

B.45:  Yeah they did.  Well, I think that's the guy that, uh, it was like, his
story.

A.46:  Uh-huh.   

B.47:  I think he was like a Italian director or something like that --

A.48:  Right.   

B.49:  -- and I think that was himself.  He was, he, that was his own story.

A.50:  Yeah.   

B.51:  On what's made him successful or whatever.  Yeah, so of course he picked
probably all these really good looking young people, you know, yeah.

A.52:  Yeah [laughter].   

B.53:  Yeah, I liked that, too.  [lipsmack] yeah, uh, we, uh, my wife and I are
planning on trying to go see, uh, uh, [lipsmack] SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
tonight.

A.54:  Yeah, I hear that's pretty good [music].   

B.55:  Yeah, it's a suspense, well I guess it's ranked number one now.  It's
supposed to be pretty good, suspenseful.

A.56:  Oh, is it?   

B.57:  Yeah.  But, are you good at, do you like suspenseful movies like that.

A.58:  Yeah, I do.   

B.59:  Yeah, because see, I, I'm not really one that likes real sus-, I like the
nice lighthearted comedies most of the time.

A.60:  Well, it depends on what mood you're in, too, you know.   

B.61:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.  But, uh,

A.62:  Like, for example, TEQUILA SUNRISE, I liked that.   

B.63:  Yeah, well that, well that was, that's with, uh, who's, what's his name's
in it, uh,

A.64:  Uh, I don't know.   

B.65:  Mel Gibson.  And, uh, what's his, yeah, that was a good movie, too.  That
was good.  I,

A.66:  Yeah, is that supposed to be something like that one?   

B.67:  Yeah, yeah something like that, except it's, it's supposed to be really,
you know, suspenseful.

A.68:  Yeah.   

B.69:  So I guess, but, you know, we're, it's been rated pretty well, and every,
all the critics like it, so.  And every, word of mouth has been pretty good on
it.  So,

A.70:  That's pretty good.   

B.71:  Yeah, we're, we're going to go see that, probably tonight.  

A.72:  Well, what have you seen that, that,  

B.73:  Uh, actually, let's see.  We, we, uh, we've rented a couple movies lately,
you know, because you get them on videotape, we rented, uh, just last night we
watched, uh, [lipsmack] David Lynch's, uh, movie, BLUE VELVET.

A.74:  Uh-huh.   

B.75:  Which, which is, that, it, it sort of has some of the, some of the music
behind it, is, did you ever watch TWIN PEAKS?

A.76:  No, I don't watch that show.   

B.77:  Yeah, well, that, it has some of the music, we've wa-, we watched TWIN
PEAKS,

A.78:  Uh-huh.    

B.79:  because, uh, uh, a little bit, so it ha-, you know, and I think she had
seen part of it before, friends of hers had rented it,

A.80:  Uh-huh.   

B.81:  and she'd seen part of it, but we thought we'd rent the whole thing and
actually it's a pretty good movie, but it's not great, you know.  They said
it's supposed to be really weird, but, because that David Lynch has, like a
weird style.

A.82:  Uh-huh.   

B.83:  But I didn't think it was really weird.  You know, not as weird as, I don't
know, I, we also,

A.84:  Maybe you expected too much out of it.    

B.85:  Yeah, I think, yeah, that's probably true.  Yeah, we also saw WILD AT HEART
which is also a David Lynch movie, that,

A.86:  Uh-huh.   

B.87:  that, that had been out.  Now that was a weird movie.  That,

A.88:  WILD AT HEART?   

B.89:  Yeah.  

A.90:  About what?.   

B.91:  It was, it was about, uh, a guy, uh, Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley, like
a, like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie --

A.92:  Uh-huh.   

B.93:  -- he's like a real violent, uh, twenty year old and he, uh, he's in love
with this girl that's about sixteen or seventeen and they leave, he's involved
with like a murder and then, uh, [lipsmack] he, they go to, uh, they go to,
like, Louisiana and Texas and, uh, he get, they get, he gets more involved
with this robbery and whatever.  But it's sort of,

A.94:  So he just gets in trouble everywhere.   

B.95:  Yeah, he gets in trouble everywhere he goes.  It's real violent.

A.96:  Um.   

B.97:  And, uh, you know, which is like what David Lynch's other movies were
about, you know, the, so, I don't know, I just, I didn't think it was that
good.  My wife liked it a little bit more than I did.

A.98:  Yeah.   

B.99:  She looks, she looks at more, some of the, uh, more creativeness behind it,
you know.

A.100:  Yeah.   

B.101:  She likes the different type of movies, you know.  But I didn't think it
was that good.

A.102:  I don't, I don't like to look too deep into movies.  If it's good, it's
good, if it's not, it's not [laughter].

B.103:  Yeah.  That's sort of the way I feel, too.   

A.104:  Yeah {faint}.  

B.105:  I don't know what else, we just saw something recently.   

A.106:  I want to go see THE DOORS.  That's what I want to go see.  

B.107:  Yeah, they say that's pretty good.  Well, how old are you?  

A.108:  I'm twenty-one.   

B.109:  Twenty-one, oh, see you're young, so you, you, see I'm thirty-one, so,

A.110:  Uh-huh.   

B.111:  you see this as like a mythical thing, you know, so, you're like,

A.112:  Right, well, I mean, I, I, you know, I'm pretty familiar with the story of
Jim Morrison.

B.113:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.114:  I mean I don't know everything about it but,   

B.115:  Yeah.  It's one of the things, uh, if you read in the newspapers and stuff,
the critics really like it or they really don't.

A.116:  Uh-huh.   

B.117:  Yeah, so I think, uh,  

A.118:  Uh.   

B.119:  But I think, it's supposed to be well done.   

A.120:  I heard, I heard that it, that, what is it, SISKEL AND EBERT, someone told
me that SISKEL AND EBERT said that one of the two liked the whole movie, but
he doesn't like the ending so he wouldn't recommend the movie,

B.121:  Uh-huh. 

A.122:  and he didn't like the ending because of the way Jim Morrison's life
ended and it's like, that's ridiculous, I mean, that's a true life story.  How
can you not like something,

B.123:  Right, yeah [laughter], yeah. 

A.124:  that really, you know, is, if it happened, it happened, y-, you're just
telling a story.

B.125:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  Yeah.  I guess, I guess, uh, [lipsmack] well, I
was watching, uh, ARSENIO HALL the other night --

A.126:  Uh-huh.    

B.127:  -- and, uh, [lipsmack] the actor that plays Jim Morrison's, one of the
other, uh,

A.128:  Val Kilmer?   

B.129:  Uh, not Val Kilmer, the, uh, Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other
characters in the band,

A.130:  Uh-huh.    

B.131:  One of the other men in the band, uh, was on, was on, uh, ARSENIO, and he
was talking about it, you know, and, uh, he said that, uh, they tried to stick
pretty much to, you know, the,

A.132:  The real story?   

B.133:  the real story,  

A.134:  Yeah.   

B.135:  and, and, and for, to, for all of them to get an understanding of how
their characters were they c-, they watched older videotapes, you know, of
their, them in interviews,

A.136:  Right.   

B.137:  and things like that.  So they tried to make it pretty, you know, close
to the line.  [lipsmack] But, uh, they s-, also said that whatever the guy
that directed it, I don't (( )),

A.138:  Yeah.   

B.139:  he, uh, he's very, he really liked THE DOORS, so it was very much his
impression, too.

A.140:  Right, yeah.    

B.141:  So if,  

A.142:  Oliver Stone, isn't it?   

B.143:  Yeah, yeah, and he's a very strong willed person and his, his ideas
whatever came through.

A.144:  Yeah.   

B.145:  You know, with however, so they said if, if you, uh,

A.146:  But he's a good director, so, I mean,  

B.147:  Yeah so,

A.148:  he should still be able t-,

B.149:  So if you like his view and his direction in other words,, then you'll
really like the movie --

A.150:  Uh-huh.   

B.151:  -- you know, so probably if you liked his other two movies, uh, those are,
like, WALL STREET, and PLATOON then,

A.152:  Oh, I liked PLATOON, it was all right.   

B.153:  Yeah. 

A.154:  But I didn't see WALL STREET.   

B.155:  Yeah, if you liked PLATOON, you'll probably really like this, because it
takes pretty much the same direction for the time.  You know, uh --

A.156:  Yeah.   

B.157:  -- I think, so that's, uh, because he has a pretty strong will and he
directs his own way.  So it should be, you know, pretty good.

A.158:  Well, I think I'll go see that this weekend or next weekend, one or the
other.

B.159:  Yeah.   

A.160:  Because I really want to see it, I wanted to see it, uh, about two weeks
ago, when I had a chance to go see it, but I, I went home for the weekend and
they didn't have it playing home.

B.161:  Uh-huh.   

A.162:  For, like, spring break and,   

B.163:  Yeah.  Oh, are you in college?   

A.164:  Yeah, I'm still in college.   

B.165:  Why, why are you participating in this study? 

A.166:  Uh, my, uh, roommate took a voice ((over)) course --  

B.167:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.168:  -- and they told him to sign up for this --  

B.169:  Yeah.   

A.170:  -- and he asked me if I wanted to do it and I said sure.   

B.171:  Yeah.    

A.172:  You know, it's like, just, you know, to help out, whatever, you know, the,
the more participants you have, the bigger,

B.173:  The more participants, the better it works out because I'm a voice
researcher.

A.174:  Uh, you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and, and,

B.175:  Right, uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.   

A.176:  I guess they wouldn't be called dialects, but they're pretty close
sometimes [laughter].

B.177:  Yeah, that's what they're, yeah, that's what they're really looking for.  I
think just how we speak also,

A.178:  Right.   

B.179:  looking where we pause and where we don't, things like that.

A.180:  Yeah.   

B.181:  Yeah, but that's pretty, that's good, uh, what, do you get many movies on
campus?

A.182:  Well, the, the good thing about campus is that we have this, uh, system
that, uh, uh, it's a, it's called U A B, uh, university something or other, I
don't know, and they give out like movies, they show movies in the theatre for
a dollar.

B.183:  Uh-huh, right, yeah.   

A.184:  And, and so, you know, like, every other day or, or so they have, like,
movies for a dollar.  Sometimes they're even free.

B.185:  Uh-huh.   

A.186:  I think, uh, they showed, uh, ((CHIMA PARA DISO)) free.  

B.187:  Uh-huh.   

A.188:  Uh, but I missed it so I rented it the other day.   

B.189:  Yeah, yeah because my wife and I saw it in the theatre.   

A.190:  Uh-huh.   

B.191:  We really liked it.   

A.192:  Yeah, I liked it, but I didn't, I didn't know if the Americans would like
it so much.  They might, you know, look into it and say, uh, this is low
budget film and it's not really that good, but, I mean, I like the story.

B.193:  Yeah, it was a great, that's a, I think, that's, that's one thing, too, uh,
you know, you can't get so much caught up in the expense --

A.194:  Right.   

B.195:  -- as, as you do a good, telling a good story.   

A.196:  Yeah.   

B.197:  And I thought that was, that movie really told a good story.

A.198:  Yeah.   

B.199:  And, and I think if you really like the story going along with it, you
don't notice that it's a little bit, you know, it might not have as many
camera angles,

A.200:  Right.   

B.201:  or it may not have, you know, uh, [lipsmack] because the, you know, the
character actors, the town, the community people were just great.  They just
seem so real, you know.  They came right,

A.202:  They were, they were.   

B.203:  off the screen.   

A.204:  I mean, I, you know, I, I go to Italy every summer,  

B.205:  Uh-huh. 

A.206:  ex-, I missed last summer, but, I mean, it's like that.  You go into the
small towns, especially, you know, like, in where he was in Sicily --

B.207:  Uh-huh.   

A.208:  -- and the southern part of Italy, everything is like that, you know, and
no one has any money, you know, you just barely get by.  But everybody is like
a big family,

B.209:  Right.  

A.210:  and it's like, it's just like that.  So that's why I liked it.  I guess
I'm a little biased but [laughter].

B.211:  But, see, I really think, yeah, I, I think those characters came right off
the screen in that story.

A.212:  Yeah.   

B.213:  You know, it was really enjoyable and, and my wife, we thought the same
thing.  We were so pleasantly surprised.
