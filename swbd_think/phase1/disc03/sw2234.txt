========================================================================

A.1:  Well, my family moved to Texas about eight years ago.  My husband was
raised here, by I, I have never lived here, so, um, when we came back to
Texas, I was really kind of excited.  There wasn't a state income tax and
there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the, the grocery store and
things.

B.2:  Huh-uh. 

A.3:  And all of that was new to me,  because I'm sort of feeling like we're
getting a better deal here [laughter], than what I was accustomed to.

B.4:  Yeah.  Did you move from the Northeast? 

A.5:  Well, I lived in Missouri and then in Utah and them, um, both places had
pretty good state income tax.  And, um, we've always paid tax, you know, on
everything we purchased, even food at the grocery store.  So, I thought it was
really, you know, kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your
groceries and, but, I think, I mean, I don't enjoy paying taxes.  And it's
hard, but, um, I think that is what we have to have, you know, have our
streets and have, have our government and [throat_clearing].  Excuse me.  And
have, and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay
for the employment of the people that run them and, and things like that and I
think, I guess, what I feel is that most people, um, they don't like to pay
taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair
share.

B.6:  Yeah.  I think, yeah. 

A.7:  And, um, that makes you feel bad. 

B.8:  People that can really influence the government have all the money to
throw.

A.9:  Right.  And you know, when, um, when last year the elections were going, on
the governors election and state and, you know.  I, I didn't have anything
against Clayton Williams personally or anything, but, um, it was kind of hard
for me to think, here's someone as wealthy as he is, didn't have to pay any
income tax.  That he said that year, he claimed, he had, he didn't have to pay
income tax and he thought, you know, there's some people are living pretty,
pretty good life styles, but they're not paying income tax.  And that's not
fair,

B.10:  No. 

A.11:  to me.  And there's, you know, some people, you know, who are abusing the
systems that we pay taxes to support and all that makes us feel bad.  But I
think, all in all, how I feel, is that, um, I'm willing to pay the taxes
because I think I like our country compared to the other countries I've
studied and visited.  And I'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy
the services that I enjoy.  How do you feel?

B.12:  Well, yeah.  I agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get
and,

A.13:  Huh-uh. 

B.14:  and I think that, you know, I don't think that there's any really, any
system that everybody would think is fair, as far as, being taxed.

A.15:  Huh-uh. 

B.16:  So, I guess, in Texas with, we live here also,

A.17:  Huh-uh. 

B.18:  and that it's mostly sales tax, so it's, really the people that have
money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax
on the larger items that they buy and stuff.

A.19:  Huh-uh. 

B.20:  I've lived in Texas most of my life.  We, um, lived in Kansas City for a
couple of years, and we were kind of in for a rude awakening.  They had
personal property taxes on like cars and, the first year we were there it was
kind of like, eight hundred dollars,

A.21:  Oh, no. 

B.22:  And we're like (( )).  My husband says I used to complain to pay sixty
dollars to get licensed in Texas and now,

A.23:  [Laughter].  

B.24:  you know,

A.25:  Huh-uh. 

B.26:  So, I mean, that was kind of different and then to file a, a state income
tax, was also kind of tough, too.  I guess, since we've been married, we've
moved a lot, so it always seems like, you know, we're always paying taxes for
something.

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  And it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money
back.  But,

A.29:  Huh-uh. 

B.30:  I, um, have a accounting background, so I then, have also done tax
returns in the past for other people when I worked for an accounting firm.

A.31:  Huh-uh.

B.32:  And, uh, you know, it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the
resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in
places, they don't have to pay taxes.

A.33:  Right. 

B.34:  Or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income
that they get or whatever.

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  So, you know, I think, if, I can understand why the rich people don't want
to pay,

A.37:  Huh-uh. 

B.38:  you know, a large, large percent because, you know, that's not really
fair, either.  If they've earned money by themselves, well, you know, people
just kind of ((given)) the money,

A.39:  Yes. 

B.40:  it's kind of depressing sometimes, I think. 

A.41:  Well, it is, and sometimes, I think, um, well, for myself, that income that
we have, we pay a certain salary, but, I think the employer keeps in mind this
will be deducted, you know, so, so many taxes will be deducted from it and so,
I think, you know, our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay
taxes on it.

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  And so, I think, you know, in that way, we're compensated, um, just by our
society.  Um, yet, you know, they don't pay you, um, what, just what it would
take, and if you pay taxes on it, you wouldn't have any money left over.  And,
and, um, but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything
I wish that they would, I guess, because I'm not one of them [laughter],

B.44:  Well, yeah, that's true [laughter]. 

A.45:  I wish that they would, you know, realize that they, they couldn't make
this kind of money, they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else.

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  In that, even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that
have like, fifty percent income tax, you know, that have,

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  socialized medicines and things that, they, um, they wouldn't be able to
enjoy the (( )) in that.  So that, you know, they need to be willing to pay a
little bit more for it.  Yes, they've earned it.  And yes, they have such
great fortune here, but they need to pay for it, too, because they couldn't do
it somewhere else.

B.50:  Yeah. 

A.51:  Um, I like Texas, um, not having the state income tax and I hope that
because, um, we've had enough industry here, that, I guess it, is that why we
don't have industry here is able to, to fund the state because we have oil
here and things, I mean, that's what I've always heard.  Is that, um,

B.52:  They must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last
few years, that, that really has not been,

A.53:  Big boom.

B.54:  the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes, I wouldn't
think.

A.55:  Yeah.  There's something about, um, the industry in the state,

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  That, um, there's enough.  I know, we moved here from Houston and the city
had enough money.  It was really nice that they had, um, that they began to
cut back because of the oil problems, but, um, they would have, um, so many
community outdoor theaters and,

B.58:  Huh-uh. 

A.59: And like, uh, community country club type things.  That the, it was such
nice services to offer the residents in the city and I really liked that.

B.60:  Don't you have to, why people decided to expect certain services,

A.61:  Huh-uh. 

B.62:  Then, they don't really think they should pay for them, maybe.  I don't
know.

A.63:  Yeah.  That's true.  And I, you know, like the property tax that we pay is
so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri.  But, um, I'm, I'm comfortable
at least in this year, with, with, we have some good schools.  The school
thing might be changing but,

B.64:  Yeah. 

A.65:  I'm willing to pay for that for my children.  And I'm willing to sacrifice,
I guess.  I'm not going to be the type of person that's going to grumble about
the taxes, even though we're paying a pretty high percentage.  I feel like you
get what you pay for and I want to be here and I enjoy, I enjoy living here in
this country and having seen other countries, I'd much rather live here and
pay taxes,

B.66:  Huh-uh. 

A.67:  than live somewhere else and not [laughter].  Anyway, well, I guess, I
better let you go.

@@B.68:  [Laughter]  Well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.69:  Yeah, it was nice. 

B.70:  I haven't ever, I need, I've never initiated one of these phone calls.  Do
you call in do you get to pick the subject or,

A.71:  No.  No.  They just define it to you and so,

B.72:  Oh.  I see. 

A.73:  you get what, uh, get luck of the draw but,

B.74:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.75:  [Laughter] Yeah, anyway, well, good luck to you. 

B.76:  Okay, you, too. 

A.77:  Bye. 

B.78:  Bye-bye.
