==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you, um, have a garden?

B.2:  Um, I have several outside shrubs that I maintain and take care of.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Do you enjoy working out in the yard?

B.4:  Yeah, I certainly do.  Uh, I planted a rose bed last year --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and, uh, they came out looking really nice, lot of red and white ones,
pink.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  I have some roses out in my backyard, too, and they've done real
well.  I was surprised.  Um,

B.8:  Uh.

A.9:  we had some in Virginia, and they were real hard to keep up with, but
seems like they like the Texas climate better.

B.10:  Yeah, yeah, as, as long as you give it, uh, good drainage and, uh, lot of,
uh, oh, [laughter] some, some plant food once a month.

A.11:  Right, yeah.  We built up our, we built up boxes and put them in that so
that they would drain, because our soil is so bad {pause} where I live.  Do
you live in Texas, or?

B.12:  Yeah, I'm in, uh, Plano.

A.13:  Plano, oh, yeah.  I'm out in Rowlett, and we have that brown clay soil
[laughter] and it's real hard to grow anything here.

B.14:  Yeah, I've got a, a. well, my roses are on the west side of the house.  I
asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their front door --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- because it's right by their entryway.  And they, they wanted roses.  So
[laughter] I, that's what I planted.

A.17:  Oh [laughter].  That's accommodating.

B.18:  Uh-huh, yeah, and I still need to assess the damage outside from the, the
freeze this winter.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  I've got quite a few dead shrubs, some wax (( )) and Oleander.

A.21:  Right.  We've got a few things, too.  It's hard to tell if they'll come
back or not.

B.22:  Yeah.  The trees are all doing really well.  I've got a nice Japanese Maple
out front that, uh, is looking really nice right now.

A.23:  Well, that's good.  We, we planted three pecan trees out front, and every
one of them died.  I told my husband this is the last one.  If it dies, we're
going to something else.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  But we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it
with all kinds of compost and pine needles and everything else we could think
of.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Hopefully it'll drain this year.

B.28:  Yeah, every year, uh, there's some freeze damage, and I lose different, uh,
variety of shrubs.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  Have to go replace them with, uh, something a little hardier.

A.31:  Yeah, it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the
freezing --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- that we get down here.  I have a few little flowers I plant around the
trees out front.  I've enjoyed doing those.  I put, uh, pansies out in the
winter, and they pretty much last all winter.  And then I put, uh, moss rose
out in the summer, and it just goes crazy, don't really have to do anything to
it.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Puts a lot of color out there #all year.#  

B.36:  #Yeah, I don't do much with flowers# myself.  I just get a lot of ever,
evergreen type shrubs.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  Some, uh, dwarf Burford Hollies, and Yaupon Hollies.  

A.39:  Oh, yeah.  Those do pretty well here, don't they.

B.40:  They do very well, uh-huh.

A.41:  We've got, my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind
of make a little cut so that the kids wouldn't come marching through the yard
and everything.

B.42:  Yeah, they make a nice hedge.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Uh, and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to
trim them, uh, into a, a boxy type hedge.  You can just let them, uh, grow
their natural, uh, shape.

A.45:  Right, yeah.  The only thing I don't like about them is weeding around
them, because they get those sharp pricky things get in your hands.

B.46:  Oh, yeah.  I've got some Chinese Hollies that are just outrageous.  They,
they are very sharp.

A.47:  Oh, really.

B.48:  Do you do your own, uh, lawn maintenance, or do you hire somebody to, uh,
to do that?

A.49:  Yeah, we do it. My husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that
stuff.

B.50:  Yeah, I do that myself, too.  I really don't appreciate them calling me up
all the time to try to push their services on me.

A.51:  Yeah, we get something on the door about every week.

B.52:  Because I've got a very small yard, the entire size of the lot is only
forty-five by ninety feet.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  It's what they call low maintenance yard.  And these, uh, uh, maintenance,
uh, companies call up wanting to, uh, uh, put, put the, uh, weed killer and
the fertilizer down and they want, they want to charge forty or forty-five
dollars per application.  For my size yard I, I don't spend that much in a
year.

A.55:  Yeah, really.  Oh, our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and I
don't think it looks any better than what my husband does.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  So I'm not really tempted to do that either.  If it,

B.58:  It doesn't take much work.

A.59:  Yeah.  I can mow the back yard, but there's something about the grass in
our front yard is so dense --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there, and I can not push
it.

B.62:  Yeah, I've got a little electric mower.

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  And I, I will never buy another one of those again.

A.65:  Really.

B.66:  It's fine for my size yard, but, uh, it really doesn't have the power of a
gas motor.

A.67:  Huh.  I would like a self-propelled one I think.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  That, that might make it easier.

B.70:  It's better for, for a large yard.

A.71:  Yeah, ours is not that big, but like I said, if I had to mow the front, I'd
be stuck, because I can't get it to move [laughter].

B.72:  Yeah.  Before I moved down here, when I was up, uh, north in Wisconsin
living with my folks, they lived on, uh, three and a half acres of land, and,
uh, we started mowing that with a push mower.

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  Uh, they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big
improvement for, for us [laughter] --

A.75:  Oh, I'm sure.

B.76:  -- us kids who had to go out there and, uh, mow the, the grass every, every
week.

A.77:  Yeah, that's pretty large area.

B.78:  It, it still took a few hours, even with the riding mower.

A.79:  Really.  Did people up there edge as pr-, as strictly and stuff as they do
down here?

B.80:  Um, not nearly as much as here, uh, I think it's probably because we lived
out in the country somewhat, and, uh,

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice.

A.83:  Yeah, I lived in a town, it was a college town in Virginia, and, I mean,
people kept their lawns mowed, but they sure didn't get into it like they do
here in Texas.  Wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here.

B.84:  Yeah, a lot of people do, but then again, there are a lot who do nothing.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  My street, uh, is kind of in between.  There are a couple of, uh, neighbors
who are, are really good about planting flowers and trees.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  But there, the majority really haven't done anything with their yards.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  This neighborhood is, is four years old, and you would think that, uh, in
that time they'd, uh, get their lawns and, and gardens established.

A.91:  Yeah, it's hard, I know.  We tried to do our landscaping out front.  My
husband tilled it up in the fall, and then we've been waiting on some guy
supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of
about a dollar.  And, uh, he has never got it to us, so it just sits out
there, kind of dug up, and --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- doesn't look too good.  So I can't say anything about anybody else's
[laughter].

B.94:  Yeah, I'd like to see the, the neighbors put some trees in the front yards,
anyway --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- just to get something started.  

A.97:  It'd seem like they'd want to just to, uh, get some shade and keep their
houses --

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  -- a little bit cooler in the summer.  

B.100:  You'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the
yard goes, plant a tree.

A.101:  Yeah, yeah.

B.102:  It's nice when the builders plant trees for you whe-, when they build the
house.

A.103:  Yeah.  Did they not put any in, in your neighborhood?

B.104:  No, my builder was Gemcraft, and they didn't put, uh, trees in at all.

A.105:  We had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died.  And
so, that's where we keep putting that pecan that keeps dying.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  We have, uh, I think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that,
that's hung on out there.

B.108:  The trouble with, with builders planting the trees is they, they get the
weaker varieties, ones that aren't as desirable.

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  And, uh, those include Arizona Ash and, in some cases, silver maples.

A.111:  Yeah.  {pause} Hope ours continues to live.  It's been there about four, I
guess, almost four years now, so maybe it's e-, established enough that it
will go on and survive.

B.112:  Yeah, that's probably true.  I've got a live oak in front.  Uh, I, I really
like the oaks a lot.

A.113:  I like an oak, oak trees, yeah.

B.114:  They're very hardy for this area.

A.115:  My, um, husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always
digging up little Red Oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back
and start them, but --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- so far we haven't had much luck.  

B.118:  Oh, I had a Red Oak a few years ago that I bought from, uh, from a guy who
sold trees off the back of a trailer [laughter].

A.119:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.120:  And that was a mistake for, uh --

A.121:  Oh.

B.122:  -- well, two reasons.  One thing it wasn't insured.  And the other reason
was that I bought it in spring and it was a balled and burlapped tree, uh,
right before summer, the heat of summer --

A.123:  Oh.

B.124:  -- it couldn't, uh, take the heat and it died.

A.125:  Yeah, well that's too bad.  We've got all of our trees from Calloway's, and
luckily they'll take them back any time for any reason if they die, so.

B.126:  Yeah, I usually go to Calloway's or Wolfe. 

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Calloway's tends to have nicer shrubs, uh, more fully developed.

A.129:  Uh-huh.

B.130:  And, uh, I don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those
places, although they have cut back on their warranty, uh, for the shrubs the
past couple of years.

A.131:  Yeah, I know they guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty
like six months or less.

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  But Calloway's has kept theirs forever, so. 

B.134:  Really, well that's good for trees.  

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  I don't think they do that for shrubs.

A.137:  Yeah, I don't know, we haven't bought,

B.138:  I thi-, I think it's still a year or less for, uh, for shrubs.

A.139:  Uh-huh.  We haven't bought any shr-, shrubs yet.  Hopefully, I think we've
almost waited this, too late this year now to start putting in anything of any
size.

B.140:  Oh, it's never too late to plant something, un-, unless, well, for trees,
if they're balled and burlapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall, or
winter.

A.141:  Yeah.

B.142:  But for, uh, just shrubs, say five gallon or one gallon shrubs, any time
of the year is fine.

A.143:  Oh, really, it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get
warmer?

B.144:  Right.  Just have to take care of them and water them, uh, so they get
established, put some, uh, some, uh, uh --

A.145:  Root stimulator, yeah.

B.146:  -- right, some, uh, stimulator down.  So, uh, yeah, it's never a,

A.147:  #Oh well, that's good to know.#

B.148:  #problem to plant things too late.#

A.149:  Maybe there's still hope for our front yard this summer then.

B.150:  I'm just waiting for a sale.  

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  They haven't really had any good sales on plants yet.

A.153:  Yeah, I've, I've noticed that they haven't had anything great. 

B.154:  {Pause} So, but once they, uh, drop the prices a little bit I'll be out
there, uh, picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where we're, [laughter]
where my dead shrubs are right now.

A.155:  Right, yeah.

B.156:  I haven't even pulled them out of the ground yet.

A.157:  Yeah.  Last year we thought some were dead, and finally they started
leafing out again at the bottom, so we just cut them way back and was able to
save them.  But this year they look even worse.

B.158:  You have to watch the, like, the crepe myrtles --

A.159:  Uh-huh.

B.160:  -- because they'll look really bad, like they're dead, and all of a sudden
they'll bud out.

A.161:  Yeah.

B.162:  I've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful, and, uh, there are
buds coming out all over the place now.

A.163:  Huh.  Ours haven't done anything yet this year.  

B.164:  I have a crepe myrtle tree in the back yard that still hasn't done
anything, and I'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now.

A.165:  Yeah, I like crepe myrtles.  They really add a lot of color (( )).

B.166:  Have to make sure they don't get out of hand [laughter].  They, they 
can,

A.167:  [Laughter] Oh, we haven't had that problem yet, they're pretty, #ours are
pretty small.#

B.168:  #Right, they can get out of control.#  

A.169:  Oh really.

B.170:  But mine keep dying back down to the ground, so I haven't had that problem
yet.

A.171:  Yeah.

B.172:  But I do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house.

A.173:  Oh, does it grow along a fence or something?

B.174:  Grows on the, uh, on the brick --

A.175:  Oh.

B.176:  -- on the house itself.

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  That you have to really watch, uh, to, uh, keep it under control, because
they will take over a house, if you don't, uh, tend to it.

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  Uh, those things grow about an inch a day.
