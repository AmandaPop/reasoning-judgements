============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

@A.2:  Okay, Bob.  Um, our project's painting.  Um, do you have any, uh, any
thoughts on whether painting is a good idea or a bad idea.

B.3:  Well, well, of course, uh, it depends I guess on what you're, uh, oh, oh,
what you're, you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going
to paint yourself.  Uh, I've painted, uh, like I said, both interior and
exterior myself.  Uh, not a lot of exterior but, uh, I've painted, you know,
rooms and ceilings inside and, you know, and I usually find it, uh, pretty
easy and, and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it.  {Very faint}
It's, um, 

A.4:  Oh, that's, yeah, that's for sure,  

B.5:  {Very faint} yeah it,  

A.6:  um, what kind of paint do you like to use?   

B.7:  Well, I, I nearly always use a latex base, uh, especially for interior.
Uh, the brands, uh, you know, vary but, uh, Sherwin Williams makes a pretty
good paint, and Jones Blair and, you know,

A.8:  Yeah.   

B.9:  ((Kelley)), I think makes pretty good paint, so. 

A.10:  Then you don't have, you don't have the mess to clean up when you use an
oil, oil base painting and, 

B.11:  Yeah, right, right.   

A.12:  Boy, I'll tell you,  

B.13:  You know, um, 

A.14:  oh, um, we, uh, I designed and built my own home about twelve years ago.

B.15:  Oh.    

A.16:  And it was one of the, uh, you know, the old New England salt box.  So, I
((instead)) of painting because I figured when I got, uh, just a couple years
older I'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder,

B.17:  Yeah.   

A.18:  so, we put, uh, white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather
naturally.

B.19:  Uh-huh.   

A.20:  And the trim, instead of painting, I stained.   

B.21:  Yeah.   

A.22:  So, I figured instead of going out there and scraping and, you know, having
a, having to ((climb up)) on a ladder, the stain kind of just, uh, it
weathers.

B.23:  Uh-huh.   

A.24:  So, I eliminated that chore that I don't have to do that.  I stained the
original stain and I stained once since then because it started fading a
little bit.

B.25:  Uh-huh. 

A.26:  But other than that, um, I'm like you, I like to use a latex paint on the
inside,

B.27:  Right. 

A.28:  we've, uh, 

B.29:  Yeah. 

A.30:  we've done some, uh, walls.  The ones we haven't papered 
we've done in, uh, uh, latex,   

B.31:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

A.32:  uh, uh, pastels.    

B.33:  Yeah.    

A.34:  And clean up is, is, uh, is a joy,  

B.35:  Right, yeah.    

A.36:  uh, a little soap and water and air-dry them, and you don't have to worry
about that.

B.37:  {Very faint} Yeah [noise].  The, what kind of, what kind of equipment do
you use, uh, I mean, just brush and roller or,

A.38:  Yeah, a roller and, uh, I bought one of those that you can screw in, uh,
uh, a three foot extension so,

B.39:  Uh-huh.    

A.40:  you can climb up on the walls and, the ceilings, we didn't paint the
ceilings, was just natural plaster.

B.41:  Uh-huh.   

A.42:  So, I didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just, uh, so far
it's okay,

B.43:  Yeah that's,  

A.44:  you know, we haven't had any problems with it.   

B.45:  Uh, I, I did a, had to paint the, uh, my brick, my house is brick on the
outside except for the overhangs and, you know, like the, a little bit of, uh,
what do you call the, the eaves and stuff.

A.46:  Yeah,  

B.47:  And, uh,  

A.48:  so your lucky too, you don't have to worry about going out there and,

B.49:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.50:  scraping and painting and,   

B.51:  But, uh, those overhangs and things do have to be painted, you know, every
four or five years, and I bought a, uh, a power roller that, uh, it's really
designed for indoor use but it's got a ((line on)), you know, an extension and
a pump you just put your can of paint down in the, in this pump and it pumps
the paint up through the roller,

A.52:  How do you, 

B.53:  and it works pretty good. 

A.54:  control the amount of flow or anything? 

B.55:  Well, it's got a, uh, got a regulator on it that you just set the, set the
deal on it, you know, for the, the flow and then it's got a trigger on it that
you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle.

A.56:  Well, is there a little electric pump you put in there?   

B.57:  Yeah, it's an electr-, just a little electric pump motor that, uh, turns on
and off, you know, builds up pressure so that it, you know, it kind of pushes
the paint up this, uh,

A.58:  Huh.  That's interesting.   

B.59:  up the extension.  It's a, uh, Black and Decker brand.  And, and it works
pretty good.  Like I said, it was designed for indoor use, you know, for
painting walls and ceilings,

A.60:  Yeah.   

B.61:  but I found it worked pretty good for outdoors, uh, there's certain times
of the year, of course, that, uh, that it probably wouldn't do very well
because of the temperature and stuff.  {Very faint}, but, uh, ((the right))
time of year it works pretty good.

A.62:  Do you really have a problem down there with, with having to repaint with,
with paint blistering or peeling off or,

B.63:  Well, if, if you buy a good grade of paint, uh, you don't really, uh, of
course, Texas heat, you know, you, it really gets pretty hot outside so you
have to be sure and get a good grade of paint.

A.64:  Oh, that's ((there for)) direct,  

B.65:  For the direct sunlight and stuff. 

A.66:  yeah, the direct sun beating on it, yeah.   

B.67:  Right, but, uh,

A.68:  Yeah, that's right.   

B.69:  But, I, I haven't really found it too bad.  We've lived in our house about,
uh, oh, thirteen years I suppose, and, and ((we're)), really only painted once
and, you know, it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then
but, you know, it's probably going to be time to paint again in a couple of
years.

A.70:  So, you're in the same position that I'm in, I've, I've only done mine
twice and you've,

B.71:  Right.   

A.72:  you've done yours, 

B.73:  Right so,  

A.74:  twice too.   

B.75:  And, uh,

A.76:  Well, once was on there and then you just had to do it once. 

B.77:  Yeah.  On the, on the interior, do you do, uh, do you all have a lot of,
uh, plaster walls that the, the, uh, color is built into the plaster so you
don't paint a lot?

A.78:  No.  Nope.   

B.79:  Oh.  Yeah, I, I watch, uh, some of these T V programs, you know, how to do
it's, you know, you fix it y-,

A.80:  Oh, like, 

B.81:  you fix it (( )). 

A.82:  a solar house?   

B.83:  Yeah, there's a solar house and some of those and I, I really haven't, you
know, haven't paid a lot of attention though to whether or not you do painting
or on top of plaster or not, so.

A.84:  Huh.   

B.85:  So I hadn't, hadn't really thought about that. 

A.86:  So, they just, when they, when they put the plaster walls up, they just
tinted the plaster?

B.87:  Well, that's what, my impression was that they, you know, that they were
just white, well, they're white walls, you know, unless it's white, if you
want white walls then white plaster is, uh, doesn't need to be painted or that
was my impression anyway, I'm not sure.

A.88:  Huh.   

B.89:  But, uh,

A.90:  Yeah, that's interesting.   

B.91:  Yeah. 

A.92:  No, ours, you know, wouldn't, they were just regular ((old)) plaster walls.

B.93:  Uh-huh.   

A.94:  And then some of them, you know, like the kitchen and the bathrooms we, uh,
we had put paper up.

B.95:  Right, yeah.   

A.96:  And actually the, uh, bedrooms upstairs too.  But,  

B.97:  Yeah that's,  

A.98:  but the rest of it and I, I just don't like papering.  

B.99:  Yeah. 

A.100:  I, painting is, is a lot easier.   

B.101:  Yeah.  Well, we really have, uh, our, our bedrooms, I guess, are the ones
that have, uh, that have to be painted, uh, we've got paper on, uh, our dining
room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we've got paneling in our family room
and game room.  So,

A.102:  All right, so you don't have a, a lot of paint either.   

B.103:  But we don't have a lot of paint inside,

A.104:  Uh-huh.   

B.105:  of course, the ceilings are, you know, all, all have to be 
painted.   

A.106:  Yeah.   

B.107:  But, uh, but they don't require a lot if, the only, the problem that I've
seen in the past is like when you've got, uh, if you've got natural gas and
heat, of course, you don't, in the east I suppose you don't have a lot of
natural gas heat, but if you don't have your, your heat adjusted, your gas
adjusted right, then you can get some stains, you know, on the ceilings, and,
uh,

A.108:  Oh, they get, yeah, yeah, 

B.109:  ((You know)), cei-, see, uh,

A.110:  and that's something we don't.  We get, uh, we've got on oil fired,

B.111:  Uh-huh. 

A.112:  hot water baseboard.   

B.113:  Yeah.   

A.114:  So, and it doesn't generate, uh, there's a little dust on it once in a
while but it's not even,

B.115:  Yeah.   

A.116:  like hot air.   

B.117:  Right.   

A.118:  So, and we don't use gas, in fact, there wasn't any gas in the, in the
street when we built.  There was no houses around.

B.119:  Yeah.   

A.120:  Um, so we didn't have that problem.   

B.121:  Yeah.   

A.122:  Um, I've got a wood stove, 

B.123:  Uh-huh.   

A.124:  and I thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't,

B.125:  Yeah. 

A.126:  it's wood and it's, uh,  

B.127:  If it's ((been)) a dry,

A.128:  airtight, yeah. 

B.129:  Yeah.   

A.130:  So that, even that doesn't, doesn't create a problem,  

B.131:  Yeah. 

A.132:  but I think, uh, more and more people are getting away from paint
they're, they're doing other things.

B.133:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.134:  Um, especially with the oil base.   

B.135:  Yeah, the, the paneling and the wallpapering and the, 

A.136:  Yep, yep.   

B.137:  and that kind of stuff or ((like)),

A.138:  And, there's, there's less maintenance.   

B.139:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's, 

A.140:  Yeah, you don't have to,

B.141:  and it's been nice because I have to worry about painting the, these
rooms that we've got to have the paneling on them.  Of course, if you decide
you want to change the paper and, you know, [laughter], you've got just about
as much problem, so.

A.142:  [Laughter] yeah, that's right.   

B.143:  Well, we did do that, we, we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one
of our, you know, off of our, part of our house and then repapered it and
it's, that was not any fun.

A.144:  [Laughter].   

B.145:  But, uh, we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the,
actually put the paper up.  Next time I think I'll do it the other way around,
let them strip and I'll hang the paper.

A.146:  Oh, I hate hanging paper.   

B.147:  [Laughter]. 

A.148:  That is, oh,  

B.149:  Yeah. 

A.150:  that's one of the jobs that I just, I'd do anything else, but I'll,

B.151:  Yeah. 

A.152:  I'll, um, but papering and, uh, and, and putting up, uh, drywall for the
plaster, I hate that stuff too.

B.153:  Yeah, yeah that's 

A.154:  You know, I just contracted that stuff out and,  

B.155:  Yeah. 

A.156:  I did the papering, you know, when we built, but that's not my, uh, that's
not my cup of tea.

B.157:  Yeah, it's, there, hanging the, hang the drywall is not, uh, not a lot of
fun.  You got to, you got to really pay attention and, and know pretty much
what your doing with that,

A.158:  Yeah.   

B.159:  to get it up and get the, the, uh, seams and everything 
covered up just right and all that so it's,

A.160:  So, what are the other questions that I'm, actually I had a house, um, my
home before this one was, uh, was a Cape Ann and I ((wasn't)) up and down too
that was, uh, that was kind of high.

B.161:  {Very faint} oh, yeah. 

A.162:  And that was painted.  Um,  

B.163:  Yeah.   

A.164:  We bought that and it was, uh, the paint was, uh, so-so.  I had s-, I had
to do a lot of scraping.  And then I put, uh, uh, water base paint over the,
uh, oil,

B.165:  Uh-huh. 

A.166:  and it was eight years before I had to do it again.   

B.167:  Oh that's,    

A.168:  And uh, and the manufacturer recommended that, uh, he gave me, uh, I can't
remember what the solution was, and he said just, uh, wash your house down
with it.

B.169:  Uh-huh.   

A.170:  And then, uh, you know, with a long brush,  

B.171:  Yeah.   

A.172:  and then just hose it all down.  And I had the whole yard was full of
soap suds.

B.173:  [Laughter].   

A.174:  And he said just paint over that,  

B.175:  Yeah.   

A.176:  and, we sold the house, oh, a, well, twelve years ago.   

B.177:  Yeah.   

A.178:  And I don't think they've repainted since.   

B.179:  Well, now that's,

A.180:  So that's held up,

B.181:  And that's an oil base on the bottom and then a water base,

A.182:  And it was,

B.183:  over that. 

A.184:  Right.  I had, uh, I had put one coat of, of, uh, water base and then
before we sold it there was another one,

B.185:  Uh-huh. 

A.186:  and I'd wash the house down and all that. 

B.187:  Yeah.   

A.188:  And it's, it's held up.
