REMARKS:        Speaker B was very easy to transcribe, Speaker A spoke
very quickly and cut himself off a lot. 

======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, pro football.   

B.2:  Pro f-,

A.3:  I like two teams.  One, the New York Giants, and the second is the Raiders.

B.4:  Okay.   

A.5:  That's right across the country.  I don't think I could s-,

B.6:  Yes [laughter].    

A.7:  I don't think I could s-, 

B.8:  That's one end to the other.  That's true.   

A.9:  I don't think I could spread my patriotism any more than, well, actually I
like, uh, San Francisco forty-niners, too.

B.10:  Yeah, San Francisco, I go with, so.   

A.11:  Uh, I'm surprised being that, being from Dallas I thought you'd be a Dallas
fan.

B.12:  Well, I'm not originally from Dallas,  

A.13:  Oh, I see.   

B.14:  so, uh, I kind of, I moved around a lot when I was, well, up until last
year,

A.15:  Uh-huh.   

B.16:  and, uh, so I've, I've kind of picked teams all over the country.

A.17:  I liked, uh, the Cowboys.  I lived in, in West Texas in Abilene.  I worked
with T I in Abilene for ten years,

B.18:  Uh-huh.   

A.19:  and I really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they, they went
through a rebuilding thing down there and, and, and, uh, I watched them go
downhill like all the teams do, you know,

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  like Pittsburgh did, like the New York Giants did, like, like I think the
forty-niners are about to do.

B.22:  Yeah, I think that's true.   

A.23:  I think the, the players get a little old and get a little tired and, uh,

B.24:  Well, the only thing that San Francisco may have done differently is that
they've done a good job in the last few years of, of getting rid of their
older players,

A.25:  Sure.   

B.26:  and, and bringing up a bunch of new people.

A.27:  You're exactly right.   

B.28:  You know. 

A.29:  And, and this the other teams failed to do.  Houston,  

B.30:  Right.   

A.31:  failed to do that.  They had Bum Phillips in there and, uh, and a good
running back, I forget t-, uh, I forget the fellow's name, uh --

B.32:  Campbell.   

A.33:  -- Campbell.   

B.34:  Earl Campbell.   

A.35:  Earl Campbell and they run that man to death.   

B.36:  Uh-huh.   

A.37:  And,

B.38:  But it, it worked for them,  

A.39:  Yeah but,   

B.40:  but, uh, you're right, they, they kind of,

A.41:  They had nothing to back it up and,    

B.42:  Exactly.   

A.43:  And, uh, you see that so much in pro sports.   

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  We, we go through this, this rebuilding cycle without a, without a backup
bench and it's, it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics, and this
year have finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five
guys on there for an hour, you know.

B.46:  Yeah, that's right.   

A.47:  But I like, uh, I like the Giants.  I, I kind of think they snuck into the
championship this year, this past year and, and I'm not so sure [laughter]
they'll get away with it again.  But,

B.48:  Well, I think I got to agree with you there.   

A.49:  They, they kind of pulled it off this year, but I like,

B.50:  They did a, they had a excellent game in the Super Bowl, uh --

A.51:  Yes.   

B.52:  -- I was real impressed,  

A.53:  Yes.   

B.54:  but, uh, because,  

A.55:  I think the whole thing of how they got there was, to me, I, I kind of,
well I, I guess that's the rules and, and the way the, and the way the, the
playoffs are run, but I, I don't know I just think there was probably some
other teams that, they only missed by couple of points,

B.56:  Uh-huh.   

A.57:  and they really should have been in there, but.  I like the Giants
because of, uh, Bill Parcells and I like him as a coach and he's, he's been
for years a, a good coach.

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

A.59:  I, I think, I'm not sure that they can repeat, okay.   

B.60:  Well, as hard as it is to repeat anyway --  

A.61:  Yeah, yeah.   

B.62:  -- uh, and as, as close as I think the New York Giants were to the rest, I
mean, there really wasn't a dominant team this year.

A.63:  No.   

B.64:  And, uh, you know, if, if, if like San Francisco was dominant for two
years, uh, they had a, you know, they had a chance to, but, uh, I don't think
New York's going to be able to do that.

A.65:  No, I don't think they'll be able to carry it that far.   

B.66:  Right.   

A.67:  Uh, 

B.68:  They've got th-, I mean they've got some excellent players, uh,

A.69:  Who, who would you, if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams,
who would you say is going to be the new, new, uh, Super Bowl champions, this
year for ninety-one?

B.70:  Um.  Uh, I might go with Bu-, 

A.71:  That kind of, that kind of put you out on a limb a little, 

B.72:  Yeah.   

A.73:  bit, I guess.   

B.74:  You know, this may be really out on a limb but I might go with Buffalo.
As, as good as they were toward the end of the year, got into the Super Bowl
and just, just missed, think they'll be hungry next year.

A.75:  I thought, I thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this
past year.

B.76:  Yeah.   

A.77:  I really did.  And I w-, that would be my choice.  That would be my choice
again this year, because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt,
they brought another young fellow in there.

B.78:  Reich, uh, Reich or,   

A.79:  Yeah,  

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  Reicher, or Reicher, whatever his name is.   

B.82:  I think it was.   

A.83:  He, they never even missed a beat.   

B.84:  No.   

A.85:  I mean, they just kept right on pouncing.  And if it weren't for the tumble
of the ball,

B.86:  Uh-huh.    

A.87:  Buffalo would have been there this year.  Tha-, and to me, that's another
super team.  Course, I'm being up here in the northeast corner, I kind of like
these northeast teams [laughter].

B.88:  [Laughter] Yeah I can believe that.   

A.89:  Course, I used to like the Patriots, too, they were just down the road from
here,

B.90:  Yeah well,   

A.91:  but, boy, the Patriots are kind of sad.  They're, now they're talking of
moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with
them.

B.92:  Yeah, I think that's probably would be best for the area. 

A.93:  But, uh, yeah, they, they really, I think they hurt the sport this year
with all the controversy over that locker room incident with, uh,

B.94:  Uh-huh.   

A.95:  with, uh, all that, the reporter and stuff and I think they just could
have handled it more professional way.  I, I,

B.96:  Oh, yeah.  

A.97:  I believe that they, they hurt themselves.  I guess they've had a lot of
trouble with, uh, with the Sullivan boys and Kiam.  They didn't really see eye
to eye.  And of course, the, the big political football up here, you know.

B.98:  Uh-huh.   

A.99:  Now they're, now they're trying to move the team somewhere else last I
heard.  [breathing] Boy just kind of [laughter].

B.100:  [Breathing]. 

A.101:  I've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you, when
they only like thirty miles from where you live, you can get to see the games
once in a while, and --

B.102:  Uh-huh.   

A.103:  -- it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and
every week you come away a loser.  [breathing] I mean after a while guys get
tired and we just didn't go anymore.  So,

B.104:  Yeah, well, losing is, I mean, I'm, I'm originally from St.  Louis, and St.
Louis Cardinals,

A.105:  Yeah, sure.   

B.106:  when they were there, were, uh, a mostly a losing team but, 

A.107:  But they played like professionals, exactly right.   

B.108:  Exactly.  And, and, th-, yeah, they never, they never did things to
embarrass the town.

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  And that's what I think would be, would be bad about New England.

A.111:  Yeah, they, they really didn't do good at all for us up here and that's,
that's, too bad because they were, they were some good play-, they are some
good players on the Patriots team,

B.112:  Uh-huh.   

A.113:  you know and,   

B.114:  That's true.   

A.115:  I think they need to get rid of Grogan, he's been around too long.  They
should put him in the front office doing management or something but, they
need to get him off the field and, and get the manager (( )).

B.116:  Well, he's going to, he's going to kill himself.   

A.117:  He is, eventually.

B.118:  He's going to end up paralyzing himself or something.  I mean,

A.119:  Because he's been,

B.120:  I worry about that guy.   

A.121:  He's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile and these young fellows,
that just take advantage of that.

B.122:  Oh, yeah.   

A.123:  And, and, and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally,
it's just their strength will beat him, you know, sometimes.

B.124:  Yeah.  Well, the only thing that might save him is that, in the backs of
their minds, they may think that they don't want to hurt him permanently.

A.125:  Sure.  But,  

B.126:  And so they may let up on him.    

A.127:  no one, oh, I'm sure they don't, yeah.  If it's,   

B.128:  So I don't know.   

A.129:  That, that would be, and the other thing is they're going to be there in
that position one of these days, you know.

B.130:  Right, right.   

A.131:  And hopefully they, like Bo Jackson now as I understand has hurt himself in
both baseball and football.  He, he's, there's question as to whether he's
going to come back.  I haven't read today's paper.

B.132:  Well, the last I heard, I didn't read it in the paper but I heard it on TV
was that they were still saying that he's out permanently, you know.

A.133:  Is that right?   

B.134:  Yeah.   

A.135:  There's a, there's a fabulous career, 

B.136:  Yeah.  Well they were, they were talk-, I think I was watching, uh, the N C
double A -s and they were talking about, uh, you know, this is one reason they
say that, that athletes get the money as quickly as they can, you know,

A.137:  Oh, sure because they're,

B.138:  get all the money th-, you know.  

A.139:  they're tenure is real short [laughter] [cough].   

B.140:  Right, and it could at anytime.   

A.141:  Anytime at all, yeah.  But, yeah, he make come back into baseball, but I
doubt if he'll ever come back and play (( )).

B.142:  You know, it was weird when I, what I read in the paper was, uh, the, uh,
the, the baseball career was over permanently.  The football career might not
be and I don't understand that.  I would have thought it was the other way
around.

A.143:  Well, I would have, too, I, that's the s-, that's the, I don't understand
that.  Obvious, I think football is much more strenuous than baseball.

B.144:  Especially, yeah, I mean,  

A.145:  You get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while.

B.146:  Yeah, uh-huh.   

A.147:  You know, if you're not up for three innings or whatever but, 

B.148:  And you don't get hit.   

A.149:  [Laughter] the key right there, yeah.   

B.150:  [Laughter] or you're not supposed to anyway.   

A.151:  Some, some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground,
you know, I mean, but, uh, 

B.152:  That's right.   

A.153:  I, I, that's surprising.  I, I was, I had not heard that in the, in the,

B.154:  They, it may have been a misquote.

A.155:  Yeah they,   

B.156:  But that's sure what I got.   

A.157:  No, I'm sure they p-, well, it all depends, I guess, on, on what they feel
is, you know, what he can do because baseball is not a light, an easy sport
either.  That's a very, very athletic sport, lot of running and stuff like
that.  And the hip may be a real problem, but I,

B.158:  Oh, yeah.   

A.159:  I would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him
than, than baseball would.

B.160:  Yeah, I was, I, I was kind of surprised that, uh, that the Royals let him
go with a football career as long as they did, you know.

A.161:  Well, Steve, I'll tell you, I think, I still think Joe Montana's the best
quarterback ever handled a ball.

B.162:  Uh-huh.   

A.163:  And Terry Bradshaw I think is probably even better than he is.  Or better,
or was better than, than Joe Montana is now.  Because I, of course, [laughter]
another, another Steeler fan showing up, you know.

B.164:  Uh-huh.   

A.165:  Another black and yellow surfacing up here, you know.

B.166:  [Laughter].   

A.167:  [Laughter] this is the black-and-blue league up here in the corner.  But I
like Bradshaw as a quarterback and I think, uh, Joe Montana's probably one of
the finest and John Elway, I believe that fellow, if he had some different
people in front of him, he would be on par with, with Joe Montana.  Because I
really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make
him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad.

B.168:  Well that's, uh, I agree with you there.  I mean, he didn't have the
surrounding cast that Montana had.  There's no doubt about that.

A.169:  Yeah, that's a fact.  I like John Elway.  I think he was a fab-, he, he
still is, he's got a, he's got a lot of years left in him.

B.170:  I don't think he'll do it in Denver, though.   

A.171:  No, I don't believe so.  I don't believe he's going to be able to get the
job done in Denver.  He's going to run up some big numbers and stuff, but I
don't believe he's going to get the job done there, because Den-,

B.172:  I'm not even yeah,

A.173:  simply because Denver is not, not the, doesn't have enough depth I don't
think to support him like, like Joe Montana got supported with the
forty-niners.

B.174:  Well, I think it's, it's not only depth.  I don't think that they've got
the spirit or whatever to go out and get the people to support him.

A.175:  Yeah, that's,   

B.176:  I mean,

A.177:  that could be true, too.   

B.178:  Yeah.  The coaching staff seems, I mean they were, they're fighting each
other, coaching staff and,

A.179:  Yeah.   

B.180:  L A and,

A.181:  Yeah, that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win.

B.182:  Oh, yeah, that did in New England a couple years ago, didn't it?

A.183:  Yeah, pardon me?

B.184:  Didn't it do that to New England a couple years ago?   

A.185:  Oh, it certainly did.  It most certainly did.  Yeah, we, as I say, we went
through the Sullivans that, that owned the team, you know,

B.186:  Uh-huh.   

A.187:  and, and owned the stadium and it's unreal the in-fighting, it was, it
was just, it's every day in the paper was like, you know, it was like saga
like a, like a,

B.188:  Yeah.

A.189:  like a soap opera, it, you know, who's fighting with who, who doesn't
want to go out on the field, who doesn't want to catch, it's unreal.  I mean,
you know.

B.190:  Oh, yeah.   

A.191:  That, that's really detrimental to the team.  Well, Steve it's been nice
talking with you.

B.192:  Yeah, it has.   

A.193:  It sure has and I, I'd like to try this thing every once in a while.  I
thought I'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy I'm locked in up here
anyway so,

B.194:  [Laughter].   

A.195:  Well, like I say, I, I guess I'll root for any football game because I
really like the sport and I'm glad that was my topic today so,

B.196:  Yeah,  

A.197:  You, uh, 

B.198:  it worked out real good.   

A.199:  you, uh, take care of yourself,  

B.200:  You, too.   

A.201:  and if you're ever up this way to T I in Attleboro, look me up.

B.202:  All right, I will.

A.203:  My name's Ray Smith and I work in building twelve.   

B.204:  All right.   

A.205:  Okay, come on up.   

B.206:  You take care.   

A.207:  Bye-bye.   

B.208:  Bye-bye.
