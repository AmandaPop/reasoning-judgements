REMARKS:        Speaker B had a radio on in the background but it didn't 
distract me too much.  Speaker A was hard to hear in a lot of places when 
Speaker B overlapped.  I couldn't even understand it the second time 
through because Speaker B was not cut out of Speaker A's conversation. 

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okey-doke.   

B.2:  Okay. 

A.3:  Down here it's been, it's, everybody's got colds and everything because
it's cold one day and hot the next day.

B.4:  Really?

A.5:  It's (( )),

B.6:  Oh, that's the way it is up here.  Like today,

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  it was fifty and raining, and two days ago it was snowing a blizzard up
here,

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  so, [laughter] it just, 

A.11:  Well, it is, it's about,

B.12:  it just likes, kind of crazy all over the, 

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  country I guess.   

A.15:  It's about seventy-five here today.

B.16:  It's seventy-five down there?

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Yeah, that's not too hard to take.

A.19:  No, but, uh, couple of days ago it was in, uh, mid, uh, thirties at night,

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  and only warmed up to about forty-five in the daytime.   

B.22:  Uh-huh.  Well, it does that up here.  Well, we get a lot of weather that's,
that's, uh, controlled by the ocean we're,

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  s-, we're so close to the ocean here in Rhode Island. 

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Are you familiar with, with Attleboro at all or,

A.27:  Not, not, uh,

B.28:  in Massachusetts?   

A.29:  No, not the, uh, the area, you know, I am the T I plant,

B.30:  Okay.

A.31:  ((but)) as far as, you know, what they make and everything but the
weather, no.

B.32:  Okay, well, New England is kind of, kind of like, uh, pretty close, sits
right on the Atlantic Ocean,

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  and we get, you know, a lot of, a lot of the weather is driven by the
winds coming in off the ocean,

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  the northeast winds bring in all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean,
you know,

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  and that drives our weather ((nutsy)).  Sometimes we'll get the clouds
and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture
and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature,

A.39:  Yeah.   

B.40:  you know.   

A.41:  Well, down here,  

B.42:  But,  

A.43:  they'r-, normally Dallas normally has pretty good weather.  

B.44:  Yeah, 

A.45:  {Very faint} but, uh, 

B.46:  (( )) it's not bad, uh, I, I was, I was in Abilene for ten years.  I
worked in Abilene for ten years, so.

A.47:  Yeah.   

B.48:  I'm kind of familiar with the weather out that way in west Texas but not
in, not in Lewisville.

A.49:  Yeah.  But, uh, also the pollen down here has been terrible.  If, if you've
got sinuses, if you're bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that
other stuff that gets in the air, boy, it's just been driving everybody crazy.

B.50:  Is that right?   

A.51:  Yeah.  ((You)),  

B.52:  Ev-, everybody's sick down there?  And, 

A.53:  Uh, either sinus problems or, like I say, colds or flu or whatever, of
course, I don't know that that's real-, really weather related.  I think, you
know, we just have, every once in a while, have epidemics of,

B.54:  Uh-huh.   

A.55:  of viruses going around.  I know I had strep throat here about a week
ago, week and a half (( )),

B.56:  Well, I did too.  About a month ago I had a, a real severe cold,

A.57:  Yeah.   

B.58:  but nothing that required, you know, um, 

A.59:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

B.60:  a doctor's visit or anything like that I was just able to take some
aspirin and rest for a couple of days,

A.61:  {Very faint} Huh. 

B.62:  but it just seemed like it, you're absolutely right, you don't know how
to dress, you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because it's
real cold,

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  and by noontime you're taking everything off, you know,  

A.65:  Yeah.   

B.66:  to, to go walk around the site and stuff and, and it's unreal that, uh,
uh, you know, by evening you can drop back twenty, thirty degrees,

A.67:  Yeah.   

B.68:  it's just the weather changes so quick, you know.

A.69:  Yeah.   

B.70:  And if you don't have coats and sweaters with you, of course, by then
you're all sweated up and warm,

A.71:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

B.72:  and that's how I think a lot folks carry,  

A.73:  Yeah.  Well, I'm a hot weather person.  I'm, I can take the heat, but I
don't like the cold.

B.74:  Yeah, my, the older I get, the less I like the cold up here I'll tell you
[laughter],

A.75:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.76:  I think that,  

A.77:  That, 

B.78:  I think that, uh, you know, it just takes it's toll and, 

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  uh, and, uh,  

A.81:  (( )).  

B.82:  when you get, when you're young you kind of can tolerate a lot of,

A.83:  Yeah. 

B.84:  a lot of cold weather and stuff.   

A.85:  That snow is pretty to look at, but I, I don't like to drive in it or,

B.86:  You're right, you're sure right.   

A.87:  Uh, 

B.88:  It's, it's nice to look at, but the last couple of storms we've had, the
last couple of snowstorms we've had have really been good because they snowed
and, and like within a day it's warmed right back up and melted the roads and
stuff,

A.89:  Huh. 

B.90:  so, we're able to get around pretty good, and it didn't stay too long on
the sides of the roads but, uh,

A.91:  I spent, uh, I spent a year up in Colorado Springs,  

B.92:  Oh, I've,  

A.93:  at T I up in Colorado Springs.   

B.94:  Uh-huh.  I guess you've seen some pretty weather up there too.

A.95:  It was beautiful weather and it ((is)), 

B.96:  Yep.   

A.97:  it was real strange.  It could snow and be sun shining or right after it
got through snowing,

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  you could go out in short sleeved shirt, and it wasn't that
uncomfortable.

B.100:  Uh-huh.   

A.101:  Because of, um,  

B.102:  that's the way I found, [throat_clearing], that's the way I found Abilene
in the winter.

A.103:  Yeah.  It's a, it's a dry snow.  It's not a wet, slushy,  

B.104:  [Throat_clearing]  Yeah.    

A.105:  snow, it's (( )),

B.106:  There's no, see the humidity up here,  

A.107:  Yeah.   

B.108:  too is really bad, in the summertime it's really bad, it can be
seventy-five, eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety, ninety-five
percent and, boy,

A.109:  Yeah.   

B.110:  your just like, you're in an oven roasting, I'll tell you. 

A.111:  Yeah.   

B.112:  But west Texas now was a hundred and ten and I didn't mind that at all, you
know,

A.113:  No.  

B.114:  because it was so dry.   

A.115:  Yeah, and I also spent, uh, eight years with T I out in, uh, Ridgecrest,
California.

B.116:  Uh-huh.    

A.117:  Out in the middle of the Mohave Desert.   

B.118:  Yeah, that's nice out through there.  I've got a,  

A.119:  And I loved that.   

B.120:  I've got a son lives in Riverside and I drove across the Mohave Desert,

A.121:  Yeah.   

B.122:  went to Las Vegas.  I went from route five to Las Vegas by car,

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  and that was a pretty nice trip.   

A.125:  Yeah.  But, uh, that was also a dry hot, it wasn't a, it wasn't a humidity
hot.  And, uh, I enjoyed it.

B.126:  I was surprised that last year was my first trip out there.  I'd never been
to California and I went to, out to Death Valley, and,

A.127:  Yeah.   

B.128:  it was like a hundred and twenty-five or something, and it,

A.129:  Yeah.   

B.130:  it didn't feel that hot.   

A.131:  No, huh-uh.  Especially (( )), 

B.132:  It, it, like strange that it, you're right in the middle of the mountains
and it's so brown,

A.133:  Yeah. 

B.134:  and dry, but, boy, you just didn't feel,

A.135:  Yeah.   

B.136:  it didn't feel that hot.   

A.137:  Especially if you can get, find some shade.   

B.138:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [laughter] that's the hard thing out that way, but,

A.139:  Yeah. 

B.140:  uh,  

A.141:  ((Having no)),

B.142:  I liked Riverside though, the weather in Riverside was pretty good in
California w-, it w-, I have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona,
so.

A.143:  Yeah.   

B.144:  That was pretty good.  But the weather here in New England like, like they
say, if you don't like,

A.145:  {Very faint} ((too cool)). 

B.146:  it too well, well, just stick around a little bit and,  

A.147:  It will change.   

B.148:  and it, it will change up and give you something that you may like worse
or like more it all depends [laughter],

A.149:  Yeah.   

B.150:  on, Mother Nature's kind of fickle up this way, I guess.   

A.151:  They had a, they had a interesting show in, uh, public channel down here
yesterday on, uh, the, uh, ice ((flows)) and the ice age and how the weather
effected the ice ages and everything and it's real interesting.

B.152:  Uh-huh, that sounds like it, yeah, that sounds, yeah.  I imagine it would
((that, this)), actually we get real cold weather where the wind blows,

A.153:  Yeah. 

B.154:  down out of Canada is called that, uh, Canadian express and, boy, that
winds comes down,

A.155:  Yeah.    

B.156:  and it, and it seems to make a big dip.  Sometimes it dips all the way
down to you folks down in Texas, and then,

A.157:  Yeah.   

B.158:  it roars back up the east coast here.  By the time we get it, it is
hauling some cold weather.

A.159:  Yeah.  In fact, I think they showed on the, they showed the United States
map ((a shores)), of course, Canada or North America map,

B.160:  Yeah.   

A.161:  and showed, uh, how far the ice had come down and during the last hal-,
ice age.  And I think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice
[laughter].

B.162:  Boy, that's unreal when you think about it,  

A.163:  Yeah.    

B.164:  you know, that's, that must be something to, to, well, they say these big
icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic,

A.165:  Yeah.   

B.166:  then you see the tip of them, they look like small mountains and that's
only like one third of the iceberg, the rest of it,

A.167:  Right.    

B.168:  submerged under the water.   

A.169:  Right. 

B.170:  And that's been, uh, uh, a problem, you know, to, to the merchant people
that, that fish and stuff up here.  They run into that ice stuff in the winter
and it breaks away.

A.171:  How long have you been up there in, uh, at, Attleboro?   

B.172:  I've lived here all my life and I worked, uh, I've been with, uh, T I
fifteen years, ten of it in, in Texas, five years up here.

A.173:  Yeah.   

B.174:  [Throat_clearing], but I've lived up here all my life, and I'm fifty-eight
years old, so, I, I co-,

A.175:  Well, my wife spent some time up in Connecticut.   

B.176:  Yeah, that's right next door to us.  

A.177:  Yeah. 

B.178:  Connecticut's not that far away.  

A.179:  Yeah. 

B.180:  Did she like it up here in Connecticut? 

A.181:  Yeah, she liked it, and she wants to go back up there and, and, uh, look
around, you know,

B.182:  It's nice,  

A.183:  (( )). 

B.184:  the best time to come up here is like in, in the fall, in the late fall,

A.185:  Yeah.   

B.186:  and look at the leaves turn colors because that's, that's something that
you just can't paint a picture of or,

A.187:  Yeah.   

B.188:  and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning
colors.

A.189:  Yeah.    

B.190:  And, uh, that, that's really nice to look at, uh, #the summers are hot.#

A.191:  #What do you all have, aspen?#    

B.192:  Pardon me.   

A.193:  You all have mostly aspen or,

B.194:  No, we have a lot of maple up here and oak.  Mostly oak and maple is, is a
(( )) and pine, of course, evergreens up, as you get up north into the
northern part of the, the eastern corner here, it's all pine trees and,

A.195:  Yeah.   

B.196:  but, uh, I guess the hardwoods are probably the biggest thing we have are
our hard maple and hard oak and,

A.197:  Yeah.   

B.198:  and the, the evergreens.   

A.199:  Well,   

B.200:  But that's scattered with birch trees and stuff and, uh, it's real pretty
when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors,
and people come from all over the world, come through New England (( )) only
like that, [throat_clearing], week or two when the colors are the brightest,
you know.

A.201:  Yeah, a lot of our trees and things now are starting to bud out.

B.202:  Oh, sure because it's so warm.   

A.203:  I sure hope we, I sure hope we don't get a hard freeze, 

B.204:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.205:  t-, to kill everything ((now)). 

B.206:  Uh-huh. 

A.207:  But, uh, 

B.208:  Well, uh, yeah, th-, i-, it's kind of one more week here, I guess, and
we'll be into, uh, into the springtime I gu-,

A.209:  Yeah.   

B.210:  we got another week of winter he-, just about, right?   

A.211:  Uh-huh.   

B.212:  We'll be out of the, out of the winter and into the springtime,

A.213:  Yeah. 

B.214:  and we might get one more little snowstorm in April, but I don't think it
will amount to much.

A.215:  Yeah.  Usually down here our worst, our worst month, our coldest month is
usually February.  But we didn't have, have that much of a winter this year.

B.216:  That's what I noticed when I was there was the ice storms you got around
February.

A.217:  Yeah, yeah, usually,

B.218:  One time I flew into D F W and it was iced over [laughter]. 

A.219:  Yeah.   

B.220:  You had to go into Love Field because we just couldn't get into D F W.

A.221:  I'm, I'm kind of sorry that we haven't had a real good hard,

B.222:  [Sneezing].   

A.223:  a long, hard freeze.  We've had a, you know, we've had a freeze but just,

B.224:  Yeah. 

A.225:  maybe one or two days.   

B.226:  I think that that kills a lot of germs and stuff. 

A.227:  It kills a lot of the bugs and the,

B.228:  Yep, you're absolutely right.  I think it does.  It kills germs and bugs
and the same thing up here.  If we get a hard, hard freeze in the ground, we
get a lot of,

A.229:  {Very faint} Yeah. 

B.230:  a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the
spring, but if we don't, boy, they just seem to jump right out.  And,

A.231:  Yeah, and I'm afraid this summer's going to be bad as far as bugs as fleas,
ticks, and stuff like that.

B.232:  Yeah.   

A.233:  {Very faint} but, uh,  

B.234:  How long have you been with T I, uh, 

A.235:  Thirty-two years.   

B.236:  Thirty-two years.   

A.237:  Yeah.   

B.238:  Boy that's a long time.   

A.239:  Yeah.   

B.240:  Uh, you working in the, in the military e-, equipment?   

A.241:  Uh, D S E G.   

B.242:  Yeah, D S-, defense systems equipment,  

A.243:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.244:  group.  Yeah, yeah, I was in that ...
