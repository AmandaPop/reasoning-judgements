REMARKS:        Speaker B appears to be breathing heavy and possibly 
out of breath the first part of the tape.

======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay [breathing].

A.3:  There, well have you had this with one of your parents yet?

B.4:  Uh, not with my parents, although my parents are now in their early
seventies.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And, uh, fortunately, they have to this point been very physically healthy
and very self sufficient, and they really look after themselves (( )) and I
think considered what they want done as they get older and may be less able.

A.7:  What, what is, do they want done, that's interesting that they have already
said.

B.8:  Well, the, it's more that they have (( )) when they retired and we are from
South Dakota.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  So they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls, which is
the biggest city in the state.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And set themselves up near medical facilities and I, I can not say that I
can tell you what they have decided as to, okay, because I think some of that
is that maybe you think ahead somewhat but you do not, uh, ((book those)),

A.13:  #Right and,#

B.14:  #facilities.#

A.15:  it depends on their health, too.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I know some people say they never want to go to a nursing home, you know,
where others say well, you know, put me there {sort of a laughing talk to end
of sentence} if I get that bad, you know.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  Now, my parents are seventy-nine and eighty-one

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  and they are, they are still taking care of themselves, but when they
were your parents age, they were doing much better.  Now it's gotten to where,
it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably anytime, you know,
that, that we, we are going to have to change them from their home or
something, you know.

B.22:  Well have they, [inhaling] do they recognize the coming and try to make the
decision themselves?

A.23:  No, my stepfather is one that's always had a horror of nursing homes, and
do not ever put me there.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Now my mother, on the other hand, I do not think would mind, you know.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Uh, they live in a small town, uh, a hundred and twenty miles northeast of
Dallas, and uh, and so, the nursing home there, if, if they had to go there,
there would be some of their old friends there,

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  you know, and it's, and rather than in a city where you probably would
not know anyone.  So, that would be to their advantage.  But, uh, I guess, you
know, I do not know how long, I have a brother and two stepsisters, but we
really have not really discussed it that much either.  We should have by this
point, you know, at seventy-nine and eighty-one, but I guess we are just
[inhaling] waiting to see what happens and then I guess we will make a, make
decisions then.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And, uh, but my stepfather's health is, is failing bad, you know, I do not
know if he has starting of alzheimer or, or what, but the last, say three
years, since he had to have some kind of brain surgery, he has been going down
hill, you know.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And, uh, so, anyway, I, uh, by this time, we should have probably made some
decisions but we have not.  So, I, I can see a lot of friends here in the
neighborhood too, uh, one's mother just got to where she could not take care
of herself anymore in Florida, as far as, you know, eating meals and all that
kind of stuff.  She just was not doing it, you know.  So she has come to live
with her daughter in the neighborhood.

B.34:  Yeah, that is one of the options that, uh, that is so related to
[breathing] the family situation of the children and, uh, you know, I guess,
not that it has happened in our case, in my family, because it, well I have
seen it in their generation.  It, what you do is first see your parents go
through it with their parents.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And I would say, at this point, um, you can say I have been through all
that, because I have no, [noise] no grandparents left.  Uh, and it's you see
all the different options,

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  and you see that they all can work, uh.

A.39:  I have almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends
in the neighborhood, as many mothers, it's always been mothers, have come to
live in the home, but then maybe they will have a stroke or something and, and
then, then they will go,

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  to the nursing home.  But they go to the home first.

B.42:  Well if they are, uh, that's the thing, if they are physically able, it is
a much more pleasant, more caring, uh, situation to be in the home of one of
the children.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Uh, the other side of that is that if the children are no where near,
[inhaling] where the, uh, parents had spent their life, then in a sense you,
you have no friends at the new place.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  Uh, in this, that you are, unless that you develop new friends.  And, uh,
the best thing is kind of a combination where, uh, the, at least one of the
children, if not several are, uh, uh, back in the area where the parents, uh,
had spent their years and then,

A.47:  That would make it easier, yeah, if, if you were.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  But, like you say, then to up root them and take them to another state or
something.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  But, uh, in some of the cases, I was talking about in the neighborhood,
though, they have been up rooted from another state, but then, but then maybe
things had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any
more anyway, you know.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Too, uh, they, you know, get to where they do not get out that much
anymore, maybe especially, if they had not always lived in that area they are
moving from.

B.54:  Yes.  Well it's, uh, it's not an easy choice, because it's, uh, [inhaling]
but it's something that we all face.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  And we, uh, 

A.57:  And then, then it's, then it's our turn.  So {talking and laughing at once}
we better, better handle it well because it will be, 

B.58:  Yeah, but the way society changes, it makes it so that, [inhaling] uh, what
was acceptable [noise] for our parents and their parents [inhaling] may not be
as workable for us.  It, it's certainly a problem as we, as people live older,
of course as long as you can live a healthy life, uh, the, uh, the care is, is
not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems.

A.59:  Right.  And, of course, one thing we have not even discussed that makes a
big bearing on what you do, is the cost.

B.60:  Yes.

A.61:  You know, if the parents, if they are going into some kind of, of nursing
type home, you know, that helps, helps them, uh, you know, do they have the
money to pay for it.  Or, are the children going to help out to make up the
difference.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  You know, if there's two parents, that might be three thousand,
