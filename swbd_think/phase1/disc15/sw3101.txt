During most of the tape B is breathing constantly into the receiver.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you have a boat?

B.2:  No.

A.3:  Do you like to boat?

B.4:  Oh, yeah,

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  Yeah, I went and saw boat today, I about flipped over it.

A.7:  What kind?

B.8:  I am not, I am not sure what kind it was.  I saw it just sitting on the
side of the road.

A.9:  Oh, a ski boat, though.

B.10:  Oh, yeah.

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  No doubt about it.

A.13:  [/Laughter] We have,

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  seventeen foot Invader, and,

B.16:  Oh, yeah,

A.17:  Yeah, it's, we have only had it a couple of years but it's so much better
than the other boat.  We had a, an older ((Trihold)) that was just horrible,
cause, I mean, God, you felt every wave [inhaling].  But the, uh, the Invader
is really neat, I really like it.  It's got the, bow up and the bow down, and
all that stuff, so, it's kind of fun.

B.18:  That sounds neat.

A.19:  Yeah, so,

B.20:  (( )).

A.21:  we ski every weekend [sigh].

B.22:  Well at least you have weekends off.

A.23:  Yeah [laughter].  If we did not, I think I would go nuts.

B.24:  Oh, I know, I know, I do not have that luxury, yet.

A.25:  Oh, really.

B.26:  Yeah, I am in the restaurant business.

A.27:  Oh.

B.28:  I run restaurants and, uh, did not really, [sigh] do not really have that
time off yet, so.

A.29:  Yeah, that would be difficult.  Where did you see the boat?

B.30:  It was out, out in s-, out in Garland.

A.31:  Oh, well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days
that's really neat.  It is a Baja, but it's huge.  I think it would be more
boat than I would want right now.

B.32:  Yeah, this one is big too.

A.33:  Huh.  Well eventually, my husband thinks that we are going to sell
everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean [laughter].

B.34:  Oh, that would be great.

A.35:  [/Laughter] Yeah, I think we would kill each other [laughter].

B.36:  [Laughter] I think I could probably handle that.

A.37:  Well I think I could for awhile.  I do not know.  But,

B.38:  For awhile.

A.39:  Yeah.  But I would, I mean I would have to get away from him eventually.
But, another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that
and he said that they are just planning to take their bikes and then go into
port every once in awhile.  And say see you later and take off, and he said
that they thought they could keep their sanity that way.

B.40:  Well that would be great.

A.41:  Yeah, I do not know if I could live on a boat.

B.42:  Who cares about sanity though.

A.43:  [Laughter] Well I know, what could make you insane floating around in the
middle of the Caribbean?  [Laughter].

B.44:  I know it.  No telephone, no fax machines, n-, nothing.

A.45:  Exactly.  Well that's another th-, good thing about our boat is going out
on the weekends, at least, [inhaling] we are forced to talk to each other and
there's nothing to interrupt us, and it's just so relaxing.

B.46:  Oh, that's true.

A.47:  So, even if we do not ski, but now that the water is warm enough, we have
been skiing a lot.

B.48:  Well, that's good.

A.49:  And my little seven year nephew is coming next week so I guess I will have
to teach him how to ski.

B.50:  [Breathing] [noise] Seven is about the right age.

A.51:  Yeah, I think that's about when I learned.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Do you ski?

B.54:  Oh, yeah.

A.55:  Oh, yeah {sounds like a loss of words here}.  ((Do you have)) your own ski
and everything?

B.56:  Yeah, I sure do.

A.57:  Oh, yeah, it's a lot of fun [noise].  My husband has a wet suit, so he can
ski pretty much year around, if he, if he [noise] has the guts to [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  But, uh, it was really neat, last weekend we were sitting out in the, in
the boat and a, a, a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he
threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast.

B.60:  Oh, really.

A.61:  Yeah, that was really neat.  I had never seen the shad do that.

B.62:  Huh. 

A.63:  So, that was pretty cool [breathing].  So, anyway,

B.64:  That's kind of different.

A.65:  Yeah.  I was amazed.

B.66:  Yeah, I kind of, I kind of enjoyed that boat I looked at today.  It was
nice and clean.

A.67:  Really.

B.68:  It was not, yeah, it was not that old.

A.69:  Did it have a cabin?

B.70:  No, it did not, it was open.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  Open up front, had a little, and it was open in the back too.  In the back
kind of had a little [sigh] deck in the back of it also.

A.73:  Oh, really.

B.74:  Yeah, it was kind of different.

A.75:  Huh.

B.76:  I thought.

A.77:  It must have been pretty big.

B.78:  Yeah, it was.

A.79:  Huh.

B.80:  Rather lar-, I do not know how big it was or anything, I was just looking
at it and until I got around to the for sale sign.

A.81:  [Laughter] How much was it?

B.82:  [Inhaling] Uh, fourteen thousand.

A.83:  Oh my.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  I wonder how old it was.

B.86:  Uh, pardon me?

A.87:  Was it very old?

B.88:  No, it could not have been that old (( )).

A.89:  Huh.  Was it inboard, outboard?

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  You do not know how big the engine was.

B.92:  No, I did not ev-, I did not even look at it.  I got around the price tag
and said, okay [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter].

B.94:  [Noise] I said that's enough.

A.95:  Yeah, well ours will be paid off in ninety-three, and I will feel like I
hit the lottery then, I guess.  But,

B.96:  [Breathing] Yeah and I know it.

A.97:  It's pretty nice, it's nice to have.  It's a good way to get away, Kyle is
afraid that, he does not want me to, to pull it by myself yet, but the way our
drive way is,

B.98:  [Noise].

A.99:  there's like a forty-five degree turn, so I do not think I could get it
out even if I wanted to.

B.100:  Um.  Where do you all, where do you all go skiing?

A.101:  We go to Lewisville.  And, but it's really nice, I mean, we have talked
about getting the, the slip so that if after work, if I wanted to go out and
play around in the boat I would have plenty of time, cause now it does not get
dark until nine o'clock.

B.102:  Oh, I know it.

A.103:  But, it's really nice having it in the garage, cause then if we want to go
to Whitney, or you know, Grapevine or any other place, it's just there and we
can load up and go.

B.104:  Yeah, that's true.

A.105:  [Sigh] So, plus I do not have any idea how much slip rental is, it
probably, probably get a little expensive, I would think.

B.106:  Uh, somebody was talking about that at one time, they were talking about,
uh, was it one hundred fifty a month.

A.107:  Whoa.

B.108:  Something, a hundred twenty --

A.109:  I think I will keep it in the garage [laughter].

B.110:  -- a hundred twenty, a hundred fifty a month, 

A.111:  [/Laughter].

B.112:  oh, I know it.

A.113:  That's outrageous.

B.114:  Well, it, yeah it is and is not.

A.115:  Just to have a place to park you boat.

B.116:  Yeah, especially on water even.

A.117:  Yeah [laughter].

B.118:  [Laughter] With some wood going around it.

A.119:  [Inhaling] That's pretty wild.

B.120:  Yeah, everybody has got to make a buck though.

A.121:  Oh that's true.

B.122:  It's the name of the game, I think.

A.123:  Well that's what, we were coming back from Arkansas, I guess last October,
and there was a marina for sale, and he said now that would be a fun job
[laughter].

B.124:  [Laughter]. 

A.125:  But, yeah I can probably do that for awhile.

B.126:  Working around the, working around the water and,

A.127:  Yeah.

B.128:  take off on the boat anytime you wanted to.

A.129:  Yeah, you know, hang out the gone fishing sign [laughter].

B.130:  Yeah [laughter].  In it's truest sense, right.

A.131:  Really.  I do not know, a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the
water that you pour money into, but we have been real fortunate, we have not
had any problems.  So, but Kyle is real good with the maintenance, I think
that that's real important [breathing].  So, fortunately, he knows what he is
doing there.

B.132:  Well, that's good, does he know how to work on them or just minor stuff.

A.133:  Well just the minor stuff.  Uh, we,

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that [laughter] stuff.

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  But you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good.

B.138:  That's true.  

A.139:  So, that's fine, I can live with that.

B.140:  Took it in and got it's, got all of its shots, right.

A.141:  Yeah [laughter].

B.142:  [Laughter].

A.143:  It's kind of like our only child now.

B.144:  Right [laughter].

A.145:  [Laughter] Well, hopefully, someday you will get that dream boat.

B.146:  Oh, I know it.  Or that time off, one of the two.

A.147:  [Swallowing] Yeah, really.

B.148:  [Laughter].

A.149:  Yeah, you kind of need, need them to go hand in hand, I guess.

B.150:  Yeah, it helps.

A.151:  Yeah.

B.152:  It helps.

A.153:  Because I, there's times, you know, even our weekends where we do not have
time to go and it's sad because you think,

B.154:  [Cough]. 

A.155:  (( )) you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting
there.

B.156:  Oh, I know it.

A.157:  So, but it's well worth it when we do get to go.  And hopefully, it will be
good weather this weekend so we can go [breathing].

B.158:  Man, it is supposed to be.

A.159:  I hope so.  Well, I enjoyed talking to you [breathing].

B.160:  Myself.

A.161:  Okay, maybe I will get you again sometime.

B.162:  #All right,#

A.163:  #All right,#

B.164:  Take care.

A.165:  Bye-bye.

B.166:  Bye-bye.
