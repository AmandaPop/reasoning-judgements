========================================================================

@A.1:  [Static]  Okay, I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking.

B.2:  #Alright  [Noise].#

A.3:  #Do you# enjoy cooking?

B.4:  Sometimes, 

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  not all the time [laughter].

A.7:  I'm kind of that way, too.  When I have, I, I enjoy cooking when I have
time.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday [laughter].

B.10:  [Children] Yeah, that, that's about the same boat I'm in, too.

A.11:  It gets kind of boring.

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  How big is the family you cook for? 

B.14:  Uh, five.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  We have four, so, and two of them are teenage boys, #so 
[laughter].#

B.16:  #Oh,# well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are
boys, #too.  So,#  

A.17:  #Are# they?  [Laughter].

B.18:  And they get pretty particular sometimes #in# --

A.19:  #Yeah.#

B.20:  -- what they want to have.

A.21:  Yeah.  Yeah, we have that problem too.

B.22:  Huh.

A.23:  But also, now it's just the amount that they eat.

B.24:  [Breathing].

A.25:  It's just absolutely incredible [laughter].

B.26:  Oh yeah, well see, I, m-, my oldest is nine and he already --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- he already does that [noise].

A.29:  Does he?  [Laughter].

B.30:  And I told him --

A.31:  (( )).

B.32:  -- he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches
#teenage years# --

A.33:  #Yeah.#  [Laughter].

B.34:  -- so #he can eat.# 

A.35:  #That's true.#  Uh, do you have any favorite things that you serve when
you are doing a special meal?

B.36:  Um,  

A.37:  Favorite recipes that you've come across or,

B.38:  [Breathing] My husband and I, our favorite meal is, uh, and we do it like
for special stuff --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- celebrations and, we have like steak and he does the steak and then
uh,

A.41:  Out on the grill?

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And he marinates it in his special #stuff# --

A.45:  #Ooh# [laughter].

B.46:  -- that he does.  And it's real good.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And, #uh,# --

A.49:  #How,# 

B.50:  -- I do sauteed mushrooms, so {very faintly} --

A.51:  Ooh, yeah.

B.52:  -- and asparagus.  And that's our favorite,

A.53:  Ooh, that's sound good.

B.54:  dinner.

A.55:  I love that. My husband really likes seafood.

B.56:  [Noise]  Yeah, so do we [noise] {sounds like a lighter}. 

A.57:  Um, and, (( )) I think that no matter what I do, I don't serve enough of
it, really, to, uh, to suit him.  I didn't grow up eating that much seafood
and, uh, so I don't know, it's just kind of not natural to me but I like it.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  And, uh, [lipsmack] I don't know, one of his favorite things is, uh, well
it's called seafood stew and it's really, it's really like a s-, soup that,
that you serve over rice.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And, uh, it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it.  And,	

B.62:  It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it, #is it?#

A.63:  #No, no.#  That's kind of Louisiana I think --

B.64:  #I don't know what that,#

A.65:  -- #if you do that.  Yeah,#

B.66:  I don't see how you eat that, #but#

A.67:  #I# don't either [laughter].  But, uh, 

B.68:  [Noise]. 

A.69:  no this is just re-, it is really good and, and one thing that's good is it
makes the, a large amount.  And so I've, usually we eat one and I freeze two
containers of it.

B.70:  Oh.

A.71:  Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice.  But
neither of my kids will eat it.

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  You know, #so then# --

B.74:  #So it,#

A.75:  -- they eat a pizza or [laughter].

B.76:  Yeah, it defeats the purpose.

A.77:  Yeah, it really does.  One thing I've run across, {pause} [lipsmack]
recently though, a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken
enchiladas.

B.78:  Oh yeah.

A.79:  Have you made them?

B.80:  Yeah.  My husband makes those. 

A.81:  #Does he, ooh.#

B.82:  #I'm not, I don't# eat enchiladas.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  I, I don't like enchila-, I don't like the tex-, I don't know, I guess
it's the texture, or something.  I don't like the taste of enchiladas.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  But everyone else in my family does.

A.87:  Well, are, these are done with a flour tortilla.  Is that what he uses?

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  I don't know, I, it's, I don't know what, I don't know.  I, I don't know
what it is about the enchiladas.  I just, [sigh] and I'm the only one
including my Mom and Dad and my brother.  I'm the #only one that# --

A.91:  #Isn't that something?#

B.92:  -- doesn't eat it [noise].

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  But, my kids love it.

A.95:  I was going to say, my kids both eat it.  I guess that's one thing that I
particularly like, um.  But I think it's good for, you know, for, for company,
too, and I've made it a few times.  Um, and you can make a lot at one time --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- when I needed to make something to, uh, to give somebody.  

B.98:  Yeah [noise].

A.99:  You know, like,

B.100:  [Breathing].

A.101:  you know, to take over to somebody's #house# --

B.102:  #Yeah.#

A.103:  -- #or something else.#

B.104:  #Yeah, I've# got a chicken casserole that's like that, #that, that I've,#

A.105:  #It, it's# nice when it makes, 

B.106:  [Breathing].

A.107:  a lot because you can feed your own family and then,

B.108:  Yeah, because I, when I make this chicken casserole I, it, it makes a
real big casserole and then another one that I freeze.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  So, or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're #not# --

A.111:  #What,# --

B.112:  -- going to #eat,#

A.113:  -- #what# does it have in it? 

B.114:  It's jus-, you can use chicken or turkey, because --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving --

A.117:  Sure.

B.118:  -- and using the leftover turkey.

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  And it's rice and, (( )), when I do recipes I just throw stuff in.  I
don't, I'm not real good about measuring --

A.121:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.122:  -- because I just, I do it to taste.

A.123:  Uh-huh.  Sure.

B.124:  And,

A.125:  Sometimes those are the best #ones,#

B.126:  #Well# yeah, but it, it's like, it's just chicken, it, it's, as much as
you want, you know torn up --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- and, and rice and cream of chicken soup --

A.129:  Uh-huh.

B.130:  -- and some mayonnaise and lemon juice --

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  -- and celery and that's it, and some hard-boiled eggs.

A.133:  Yeah.  #Ooh, that sounds good.#

B.134:  #And that's it.#  You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just
to, you know, heat it through.  

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  And you sprinkle, uh, that, those, uh, toasted onion rings.

A.137:  Oh, yeah. #Those are good aren't they? {Very faintly}.#

B.138:  #On top of it for the crunchy.#

A.139:  Uh-huh.

B.140:  And that's it, you know {very faintly}.

A.141:  Um.

B.142:  And #it, it, it goes# --

A.143:  #That sounds good.#

B.144:  -- and it's filling because of the rice.

A.145:  Right.

B.146:  So,

A.147:  You cook the rice before you put it in?

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  Yeah.

B.150:  Yeah.

A.151:  I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really, #kind of gives it a# --

B.152:  #Yeah, it gives it a, an extra# --

A.153:  -- #tang that would be good.#

B.154:  -- #yeah, little tang.#

A.155:  I guess I would now use the, the new mayonnaise free.

B.156:  Yeah, that cholesterol #fat free?#

A.157:  #Yeah.#  That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many --

B.158:  #Uh-huh.#

A.159:  -- #new# things like that because like I told my husband this summer, I
love to eat, you know, chicken salad and tuna salad --

B.160:  #Uh-huh.#

A.161:  -- #and stuff# like that and, and, you know, basically it certainly a l-,
low calorie, you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there
and spoil the whole thing.

B.162:  [Noise] I know.

A.163:  You know and now it's, it's, it's okay and you can even, I used to just
put a tiny bit in.  Well now, I'm just putting more and more in [laughter].

B.164:  I don't like tuna salad unless it's got #lots of mayonnaise in it.#

A.165:  #Yeah, and it's only,# it used to be like a hun-, hundred calories per
tablespoon and now it's like twelve.

B.166:  Yeah.

A.167:  Oh!

B.168:  #I know.#

A.169:  #I just# think that's the best thing to have happened, I'm just so excited
about that.  #Anyway {very faintly}.#

B.170:  #Yeah,# we did the low-cal stuff.  Well with my kids I don't, they get
enough sugar and --

A.171:  Yeah.

B.172:  -- stuff anyway.  Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway.

A.173:  Yes [laughter].

B.174:  And they don't need any added help.

A.175:  Right.

B.176:  So, when we're here at home, you know, with sweets and stuff, they, they
don't, we don't really do that much.  I do a lot of fruits --

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  -- instead of the cakes and the candies and -- 

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  -- you know, stuff like that.  And, and drink wise they have Kool-Aid,
milk or water. 

A.181:  Yeah.

B.182:  Normally.  Now when they go to their grandmother's house,

A.183:  [Laughter].

B.184:  which is every weekend.  It's a, it's a different {pause} --

A.185:  #That's when they,#

B.186:  -- #a different story# all around.

A.187:  As our family would say, a pig out [laughter].

B.188:  Uh-huh.

A.189:  [Laughter]  #That's good.#

B.190:  #That's exactly# what it is.

A.191:  Oh, one of my boys that, that's, twelve, um, [lipsmack] is, has high
cholesterol.

B.192:  Oh really?

A.193:  Have you ever found out -- 

B.194:  #No,# --

A.195:  -- #about# your kids.

B.196:  -- not yet.

A.197:  Um, and my other one does not.

B.198:  #Huh.#

A.199:  #So,# oh, year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet
to try to get it down.  And did!  He was able to get it down.  It's, I think
it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high --

B.200:  #Yeah.#

A.201:  -- #things# in cholesterol.  He's never eaten any eggs.  He's never had
anything but skim milk and you know, I've never bought butter [laughter] --

B.202:  Huh.

A.203:  -- and things like that.  But, um, [sniffing] oh, he just left for the
doctor again and it's, it's kind of back up.  Um, so he needs to be careful
again.

B.204:  #Yeah.#

A.205:  #So we've# really been talking about the foods, you know, for him to, #to
be sure to eat# --

B.206:  #The lower cholesterol foods and stuff# [noise].

A.207:  -- and, uh, so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days 
#[laughter].#

B.208:  #[Laughter]# [/children].

A.209:  And all that kind of stuff does really help.  Well, I think we've probably
talked long enough and [/static] {voices fade}.
