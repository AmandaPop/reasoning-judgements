========================================================================

A.1:  [Beep]  Okay, you have three boys.  

B.2:  Right.  

A.3:  I have two boys and two girls.  My youngest is college age but he's, so
he's still around occasionally.  But, uh, he's, he's twenty-two and it's his
last year of college.  But, uh, we were very active with them when they were
young.  Whatever they were in, gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball,
whatever, we were always involved in the parent club and coached some and went
to all the games and, and, of course in Plano, that's a big deal.  We'd, even
where we lived in Albuquerque before, there's a lot of parent involvement in
the children's lives.  How about where you are?

B.4:  That's good.  Well I try, I try to as much as possible as, my oldest is
nine.  He plays --

A.5:  Oh. 

B.6:  -- plays soccer and is getting ready to start playing football.

A.7:  Oh, my.  

B.8:  And, uh, I'm behind him a hundred percent on that.  

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  And my, my middle one is five.  He's playing soccer and T-ball.

A.11:  Oh, dear.  

B.12:  My youngest is two and he wants to do it all, so [laughter]. 

A.13:  Yeah [laughter].  He's learning from the big brothers --

B.14:  Th-, 

A.15:  -- huh [laughter].

B.16:  That's right.  

A.17:  That's neat, though.  And sometimes those that see their older brothers do
it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills, seems, naturally,
you know.

B.18:  That's true.  

A.19:  They, they start so young just kicking the ball and, are, are you pretty
involved with --

B.20:  I try to be -- 

A.21:  -- with their, uh,  

B.22:  -- as much as I can.  

A.23:  Do you coach them or go out to parent nights?  

B.24:  Oh, no, I, I just go out to as many games as I can get to.  

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.26:  It's kind of har-, har-, hard with me just because I'm in the restaurant
business and I --

A.27:  Oh. 

B.28:  -- have to work weekends, but my wife's there all the time and, mean
that's, that's one of my, that's my downfall.  On my side of that, that, that
aspect.  Which is I thinks a lot of people's, too.  Just in general.

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  Is that, is there, everybody's working, you know, the, the dad is away at
work and then the, then the wife goes away to work and --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- kids are stuck with sitters and they're not involved in there as much
with th-, their, with their kids.  They let somebody else raise their kids.

A.33:  Right, right, well that's seems to be a, a pretty current trend.  I, I work
in the schools and I see a lot of kids that, obviously, are looking for a
family and usually find it within a group at school rather than at home
because their parents are off working or, uh, usu-, you know, a lot of times
it's a single mother trying to raise, and, of course, I, I deal with
adolescents, so that's where it, fourteen, fifteen, that's where it really
starts coming out, this lack of, of, uh, family life.

B.34:  What do, what do you, what difference do you see in those kids that, than
ones with a mother and father in the participation?

A.35:  Well, they look for their security and their, uh, self-esteem, uh, outside
of the home and usually in the wrong groups.

B.36:  Really?  

A.37:  And, and, uh,  

B.38:  Acceptance?  

A.39:  Right.  

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  And they find that they're very easily, unfortunately, uh, the kids who
make them feel the most welcome when new students come into school are the
kids that are, are, uh, on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like
that and, and, uh,

B.42:  Wrong side of the fence.  

A.43:  They're the, but they are the first ones that will come up and say, you
know, you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your
classes and things like that --

B.44:  Right.  

A.45:  -- and, and, uh, when you've got a, a child that's just coming from a
situation, a move is a terrible thing on a child.  It's, it's just such a
traumatic, especially if they've lived for any length of time --

B.46:  Oh, sure, I mean th-,   

A.47:  -- in the first place and they come up here, no friends and here are these
people just throwing themselves and before you know it you've got a, a kid
involved in things you don't want them involved in and, and most of the time
the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and
the kid's coming home to an empty house or they're coming home to take care of
little brothers and sisters and, and, uh, you've got these ready made friends
just ready to go.

B.48:  That's right.  

A.49:  And, and, uh, I, I don't know what the answer is because I am a working
woman and, and I don't like to say, if the women would stay home any more than
I like to say, if the men would stay home.

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  And, 

B.52:  Well you're fortunate that your kids --

A.53:  And, 

B.54:  -- are grown.  I mean,  

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  Did, did you, did you work when your kids were growing up?  

A.57:  When my youngest was in third grade I went back to work.  

B.58:  Right.  

A.59:  But I stayed home up until then, when, by that time my oldest was, oh,
she's about six years older than he is, so she must have been in about, uh,
tenth grade, I guess.

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  My oldest was, and I had one in tenth, one in ninth and one in eighth and
then this third grader.  And, and, uh, but I went to work for the school
district where I was home in the summer.  I had two weeks off at Christmas.  I
left school at th-, four o'clock every day and was home to take them to
anything they needed to go to in the afternoons.

B.62:  Did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it? 

A.63:  Uh, no, in the schools.  

B.64:  In {faint}, 

A.65:  I, I, uh,

B.66:  (( )),

A.67:  I did work some summers but it was never, my work never took first place.

B.68:  Right, j-,  

A.69:  If, if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere, that's where I was.

B.70:  Did you work at the same school that your kid was going through?

A.71:  Uh, I, when my youngest was in elementary school, I worked at, in his
elementary school for three years.

B.72:  Right.  

A.73:  And, uh, but I had an understanding with the principal but, under no
circumstances was I to be treated any differently.  I don't want, I said, I
don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't
get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day.  That, that it would be
handled the same way they dealt with other p-, other kids.  It, it gets real
easy when a mother is in a school, or a father, even, for a teacher to, every
time some little thing goes wrong to run, and pretty soon, all you're hearing
is negative things.

B.74:  Right.  

A.75:  So it, you know, and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by
the teacher and not tattled --

B.76:  Right.  

A.77:  -- necessarily.  But it, it,  

B.78:  Well, it puts you, it puts you in an awkward situation -- 

A.79:  It worked well.

B.80:  -- puts the child in an awkward situation.  

A.81:  It worked well with me and I, and I told the principal, I said if, if, uh,
my student, my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other
discipline, have at it [laughter].

B.82:  Right.  

A.83:  You know, I'm, I'm, I have always wanted them to respect rules and teachers
and, and, uh, I don't want them to think that I'm going to come riding to the
rescue every time something happens but,

B.84:  Well, they need to.  I mean, any child as far as that goes.  

A.85:  Right.  

B.86:  There's that, there's that certain, there's that, that fine line between A
and C, you know, that you have, you need to ride.  And all kids do.  They,
they need discipline.

A.87:  Well, I think unfortunately what, what we're seeing in the very few of the
instances is that, for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the
day, their idea of parenting is to come riding to the rescue and take their
child's side without knowing the whole story or --

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  -- even when they do know the whole story, it's, it's either another
student's fault or it's another, it's a teacher's fault or, it's anybody's,
and they consider that being a good parent.  And that, wh-, when really what
the child needs is their attention more of the time.

B.90:  Well, that's usually what gets them in trouble to begin with. 

A.91:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.92:  Not enough a-, not enough attention.  

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  Like you were saying, they go off into the wrong groups and --

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- get hooked up with the wrong people so,

A.97:  It, it, it's, and it's difficult.  I understand, I, I know a lot of single
women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kids' head and
keep food on the table and I don't know how these women are supposed to have
time to, to parent.  It's, it's, I don't, I don't know what the answer is to
it.  It's, it's really sad.

B.98:  You don't know if there is one.  

A.99:  I, there may not be.  

B.100:  There may not.  I mean it's just -- 

A.101:  I-, i-, it beats being -- 

B.102:  -- an on-, ongoing problem.  

A.103:  -- it beats being homeless [laughter].  

B.104:  Right. 

A.105:  You know.
