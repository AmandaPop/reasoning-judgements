============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, #child care,
Mary Dell?#

@A.2:  #Oh yes.  I'm# an old experienced hand.  I started back when it wasn't,

B.3:  [Noise].

A.4:  stylish to do that at all. 

B.5:  [Noise].

A.6:  My daughter that's seventeen now --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- I worked even when she was a baby.

B.9:  #Oh.#

A.10:  #And# I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
[lipsmack] and then I was really lucky to have put them in a,

B.11:  [Noise].

A.12:  Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, #right off# --

B.13:  #Uh-huh.#

A.14:  -- of Walnut Hill and Preston.  

B.15:  #Uh-huh.#

A.16:  #And# it was a wonderful environment.  

B.17:  [Noise] {paper shuffling}.

A.18:  I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have
that kind of place [lipsmack].

B.19:  Uh-huh.  #I see.#

A.20:  #So, it# worked well.  

B.21:  #Oh.#

A.22:  #How# about you?

B.23:  Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of
them has ever been in --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- but, uh, they both went through preschool.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  And, uh, [breathing] we've just been real lucky #[laughter]# --

A.30:  #Uh-huh.#

B.31:  -- I think, anyway. #To not,#

A.32:  #It's not# hard to find anything that's part-time.  So many of the churches
have really strong --

B.33:  Right, like half day #programs.  Uh-huh.#

A.34:  -- #preschool and children's# day out --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of
the few churches that did it.  There were a couple downtown Dallas but they
were so, seemed,

B.37:  [Noise] {sounds like water running}.

A.38:  cold and impersonal, I just couldn't hack it.

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there
when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there
today.  #So there# --

B.41:  #Oh.#

A.42:  -- was real continuity.  She went back as a teenager and these people that
had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.

B.43:  Oh, my gosh.

A.44:  So, it, it was really neat.  But it was because they had a director that
had always done it as a labor of love #and# --

B.45:  #Uh-huh.#

A.46:  -- she just kept good people and --

B.47:  #Oh my goodness# {faint}.

A.48:  -- #real cheerful# place, lots of arts and crafts, and I'm really glad my
kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that. 

B.49:  Right. #Right. Yeah.#

A.50:  #That if they# hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never
going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.

B.51:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh,
public schools out here.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  You know, to, your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do [laughter]
you get them once a week or something, #you know.#

A.54:  #Or pay for it# after school.  Our Emily's in the third grade over at
Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so
that they can take French and #music and art and# --

B.55:  #Oh is that right?#  #I had no idea.#

A.56:  -- #you know, I willingly# did it but I thought,

B.57:  [Throat_clearing].

A.58:  this makes me angry.  This is something that ought to be in the schools --

B.59:  #Oh my goodness.#

A.60:  -- #rather than# some of the other stuff they #do.#

B.61:  #And# with our budget cuts, I'm #sure# --

A.62:  #Yeah.#

B.63:  -- that's not going to [laughter] #not going to change anytime soon.#

A.64:  #Well that's the only way they're.#  Yeah, well, that's the only way
they're going to be able to do it.  And parents who really want their kids to
have any humanities are going to have to do that.

B.65:  Oh my #goodness.#

A.66:  #So,# in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes.

B.67:  Yeah.  That's true.  Well even the preschools, you know they get so much
of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like
wham #[laughter].#

A.68:  #Yeah.#  Yeah.

B.69:  Culture shock. #It's just,#

A.70:  #Put the# colors away [laughter].     

B.71:  Yeah, yeah.  #Get the computers out# --

A.72:  #Which is too bad.#

B.73:  -- and, you know.

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  ((That's)) hard.

A.76:  #Uh-huh.#

B.77:  #It's so# difficult for them.  Um, {pause} [lipsmack] did you have your
children, did you say in home, in, in, private care, was #that in your home or
in someone else's home?#

A.78:  #Until they were two.  Yeah.#  Yeah, both times they were at our house.

B.79:  Uh-huh.  #So you were able to have somebody come there.#

A.80:  #And that was hard too.  I,# I lucked out with really good people both
times but I know so many people that are never able to find that and I'd
practically give my paycheck away to do it, #so [laughter].#

B.81:  #Yeah. Yeah.#  Did you have a nanny or did you have #someone# --

A.82:  #Yeah.#

B.83:  -- that lived in with you?

A.84:  Well no, she didn't live with us.  Uh, the first one was an,

B.85:  [Noise] {paper shuffling}.

A.86:  elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school --

B.87:  #Oh.# 

A.88:  -- #just purely on# baby-sitting money.  

B.89:  #Oh my goodness.#

A.90:  #And she kept# Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at
night.

B.91:  #Uh-huh.#

A.92:  #And she# was neat [noise] because she was like the grandmother that my
kids never had --

B.93:  #Yeah.#

A.94:  -- #because# both our parents are dead.

B.95:  Oh.

A.96:  So that, that was a plus from --

B.97:  #Oh gosh.#

A.98:  -- #that respect# as well.  And then with Emily it was a neighborhood
friend --

B.99:  Uh-huh. 

A.100:  -- that kept her.

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  So,

B.103:  I have, uh, 

A.104:  I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care
#center.#

B.105:  #Uh-huh.#  I was just listening to a program this morning, oh well, I
guess it was on the HOME SHOW, but they were talking about, uh, [breathing] a
new, uh, [sigh], oh I can't even think of the name of it.  I was halfway
listening while #I was painting [lipsmack] [laughter].#

A.106:  #Uh-huh.#

B.107:  Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and
children --

A.108:  Uh-huh.

B.109:  -- [Lipsmack] and they've now moved it to Washington, D C and the, the
doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine
leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery #day-care# --

A.110:  #Yeah.#

B.111:  -- #and leaving them there.#

A.112:  #Oh that would be hard.#

B.113:  You know, so, um, 

A.114:  Well, they give a lot more leave.  I work at N C N B now, and our
benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people --

B.115:  Uh-huh.

A.116:  -- are, are really expanding.  We have more options now then we did when I,
my kids were born, with being able to take off full-time longer --
 
B.117:  Uh-huh.

A.118:  -- of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time #for# --

B.119:  #Oh boy,# #that's great.#

A.120:  -- #up to six months.#  It's really neat.  I've, I've had a couple of
assistants that came back just three days a week or they've, you know,
[noise] whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.

B.121:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.122:  We try to work it with their hours.  And that helps because you don't have
to just wean yourself cold turkey and say --

B.123:  #Yeah.#

A.124:  -- #okay,# I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again.

B.125:  Right. Right.

A.126:  And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.  I've, of
course it's too late for me [laughter] so --

B.127:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.128:  -- #I've, I've not# tried them to see how effective they #are but# --

B.129:  #Uh-huh. Uh-huh.#

A.130:  -- I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very
fast [noise].

B.131:  #God, it's amazing# {very faintly}.

A.132:  #And for# {pause} our age group it's too late, too little, too late.

B.133:  Right.  Right.

A.134:  But I, [lipsmack] I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and
improved because more of us are going to have to work.

B.135:  Uh-huh. #Uh-huh.#

A.136:  #Two income# families I think are here to #stay.#

B.137:  #Well# and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why
the government makes the decisions they do --

A.138:  Uh-huh.

B.139:  -- you know, the, the people that work in big business have families --

A.140:  #Right.#

B.141:  -- #they# have children.

A.142:  #Yeah.#

B.143:  #So,# it's only to their advantage that they get these programs #going 
and# --

A.144:  #Oh sure.#

B.145:  -- working and, uh,

A.146:  You retain employees and keep them longer.  That's, that was the rationale
they gave when they were giving us information about our --

B.147:  Uh-huh.

A.148:  -- Employee Assistance #Programs that# --

B.149:  #Uh-huh.#

A.150:  -- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying 
to --

B.151:  Right.

A.152:  -- split ourselves in fifteen million pieces [laughter].

B.153:  Right.  Right.  

A.154:  So, I, I hope it helps.  It seems to help the new mothers --

B.155:  #Oh that's good.#

A.156:  -- #not have to come# back full-time. #because that's hard.#

B.157:  #That's good to know.#  I have a couple of friends that,

A.158:  [Noise]. 

B.159:  have, have found the, uh, you know, a pri-, a private home to take their
children to when they're young --

A.160:  Uh-huh.

B.161:  -- until they hit the preschool age.

A.162:  #Uh-huh.#

B.163:  #And they# usually, you know, you'll find a, a woman that's keeping like
six children or --

A.164:  Uh-huh.

B.165:  -- four to six children in the home and my future, future sister-in-law's
mother does that too, #full-time.#

A.166:  #Well in Plano# though the problem is, you find, and this is what I found
with Emily.  I, from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in
Plano area.

B.167:  Uh-huh.

A.168:  And I kept finding [noise] neighbors and friends and they'd move. 

B.169:  Oh.

A.170:  She ended up being in a different home #every year.#

B.171:  #Too transit. Uh-huh.#

A.172:  And I finally decided [noise] I didn't like that because it was traumatic
to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.

B.173:  And her #surroundings.#

A.174:  #So# this year I, I tried Kinder-Care and,

B.175:  [Throat_clearing].

A.176:  then she's old enough to {voices fade},
