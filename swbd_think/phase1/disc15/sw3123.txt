A.1:  Okay, what do you think about the school systems?  

B.2:  Uh, well, where I live in Plano -- 

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their
school system.

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  And, uh, in fact, I think that there's some areas of, of Dallas and
Richardson that are in the, those s-, town, city limits, but they, uh, all of
the, the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district
and they use that as one of the things that they, uh, you know, that they try
to market when they sell homes in that area.  The fact that it is in Plano
schools.  Uh, I do have children in that school system.  Uh, and have been
personally pleased with that.  Uh, I'm not sure that it's that, that there's
that much glory in the Plano schools versus, say Richardson and some of the
other areas.

A.7:  Okay.  

B.8:  Uh,  

A.9:  What do you see as being a problem with the school system?  

B.10:  Uh, probably the biggest controversy within our school system is the use of
the open classroom concept.  Uh, where, uh, all, uh, all the students at a
given grade level are in one large area for much of the day, uh, segregated,
you know, by teacher, but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Uh, I've now had two children that are, have been in the s-, in the system.
Uh, one who seemed to do just fine in that tap, type of atmosphere, the other
I'm not so sure about because of, uh, his attention span.  I think he's a
little bit more easily distracted --

A.13:  Oh.  

B.14:  -- than was she.  And that seems to be the primary complaint.  Uh, I think
my biggest c-, problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the
schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their
classroom to eat, uh, rather than giving them a, a break from that area --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- during the day.  Uh, and, uh, that's, [laughter] I guess I'm a fairly
satisfied, uh, parent as far as the school system goes, myself.  Uh, that,
that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and their interest, uh, in the students individually, is going to make
the difference versus, you know, physical things, such as the open classroom
versus a more closed classroom.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  Uh, what do you see as problems?  

A.21:  Well, I don't have children in school and it's been so long since I was in
school myself, I'm not really sure how to answer that.

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  When, uh [breathing] I don't know, it seems that they're, you know, that,
that the difference is between each school.  I think if it was, if it could
possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to, to
gauge, you know, how, uh, a particular group of students was doing.

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  Uh, the curriculums differ so much and I'm not saying that that's bad
necessarily, but I think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem
is.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  You know, you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a, if, if
it's the, the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got
the problem, you know, what the materials that they're using and everything.

B.28:  Right.  

A.29:  That could be causing a problem.  

B.30:  Now in, in Dallas, I know at least at some of the later grade levels they
have these magnet schools that I think were initially set up to address the
segregation issues.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Uh, and I wondered, uh, what the real overall effect on education is of
those.  Uh, I know I have a niece in the Dallas system that is a, uh, was just
elected to go or selected, whatever, I, I think you have to apply and be
accepted to these magnet schools, but she's interested in the arts and in, in
particular in dance.

A.33:  What kind of school is that?  

B.34:  Uh, they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain 
interest --

A.35:  Oh, okay.  

B.36:  -- and, uh, she will be attending I think Skyline Arts Magnet, uh, or arts
and something [laughter] magnet school, uh, next year when she enters high
school.

A.37:  Yeah, I think that's kind of a good idea because, you know, it doesn't, it
doesn't, it doesn't divide people by, by anything besides what they're
interests are.

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  And it's a mu-, high-, it's a learning environment if you're grou-, if
you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are
interested in sciences --

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- it seems like it would, it would, uh, it would help.  

B.42:  Now I would think that would, would be a good point as well. 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  They, they don't have that type of thing in Plano.  They just have these
two gargantuan [laughter] high schools.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Uh, but I do think they do provide some type of special interest focus, I
think the later years.

A.47:  Okay.  

B.48:  Uh, for, for students.  

A.49:  What do you think about, about sports in high school and about, uh, the
competitiveness.  I've, I've, know I've seen in Plano that there's a lot of
really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high
schools.

B.50:  Well,  

A.51:  And do you think that's healthy?  

B.52:  Oh, not really.  Uh, I've not been that aware of it.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Uh, I live on, it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano --

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  -- with Central Expressway down the middle.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  Uh, and I am on the west side, but just barely on the west side.  I guess
my kids are younger than that and in, they're in the non competitive, uh, just
athletics, uh, organizations, you know, your typical soccer and baseball --

A.59:  Oh, yeah.  

B.60:  -- and all that sort of stuff.  

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  And because of where we live, uh, the teams that my son has been on has,
have been from both sides of the fence, if you will.

A.63:  Oh, okay.  

B.64:  They've drawn from both sides and I really haven't sensed any of that yet.
I, it may become more obvious to me in, later on.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  I think the, one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have
high schools and senior high schools, which a lot of people don't realize
that, that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools, of which there are, there
are quite a few in Plano.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade.

A.69:  Now I didn't even realize that at all.  

B.70:  Yeah, that's, was very different.  Uh,  

A.71:  Um.  

B.72:  They have middle school sixth, seventh and eighth.

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  And then they'll have, uh, fact, they have a couple of huge schools that
are actually almost all middle school and elementary school, all of those
grades in one building.

A.75:  Huh.  

B.76:  But, uh, for the most part,  

A.77:  Well, I know they've got a lot of elementary schools.  

B.78:  Yeah, bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools
for sixth, seventh, and eighth and then there are a number, at least, I could
probably think of six high schools.

A.79:  Well, now what is Shepton going to be?  

B.80:  Shepton is a high school.  

A.81:  Okay.  

B.82:  Ninth and tenth.  

A.83:  Okay.  

B.84:  And, uh, there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams, and there's
Clark and, I don't know whether there's more than four.  I want to say that
there are more than just four, but, uh, it's just ninth and tenth grade and
then the, the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders.

A.85:  Um.  

B.86:  Which is a, sort of a different concept.  

A.87:  Yeah, that does seem kind of different.  

B.88:  And they're, they're just so big.  I'm a little bothered by that.  Uh, just
the sh-,
