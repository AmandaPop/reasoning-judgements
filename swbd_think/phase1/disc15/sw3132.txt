Speaker B apparently had children in the home that you could hear in the
background very clearly.

===========================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] {television or radio}.  Well, hi Nola, this is Vic [lipsmack].  Uh,
do you have any hobbies that, uh, that you really participate in?

B.2:  Um, most of my hobbies include t-, three little girls.

A.3:  Oh [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] They keep me pretty busy.

A.5:  Is that right?

B.6:  I, uh, we're home schooling.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So I, um, am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that
kind of thing.  Um, I'm also, we're expecting a baby in August so I've been
trying to get some things in the house organized for that --

A.9:  #Uh-huh.#

B.10:  -- #and have# repainted a couple of chairs [children] and repainted a
dresser and --

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  -- some of that kind of thing.  Um,

A.13:  Do you have, uh, as part of your home schooling, do you have any like, uh,
handicraft type things that you've done with, with your children?

B.14:  Um, yeah, we do different things.  Uh, I sew --  

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- so, uh, I haven't had a lot of time for it, for a little while but, um,
that's one thing that we do do some of.  Um, [lipsmack] --

A.17:  Uh-huh [lipsmack].

B.18:  -- #I,#

A.19:  #Do# you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of #stuff or have
you before?#

B.20:  #Oh yeah.#  Yeah.

A.21:  Oh, that's good.    

B.22:  Um, [lipsmack] I {pause} have, I can do lots of things and I enjoy lots
of different things.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I don't have a lot time for most of them but when I do, I like, uh, I like
art.  I like, uh, [lipsmack] the sewing.  Um, [lipsmack] let's see what else?
{Pause} I can do, you know, lots of different things like cross-stitch and
different things but I just don't spend that much time on it --

A.25:  #Right.#

B.26:  -- #uh,# quilting.

A.27:  #Um.#

B.28:  #I've# made quilts for the girls' beds and things like that [children].
Um, 

A.29:  Well, that's nice.  Something they can keep for a long time and enjoy
#later on.#  

B.30:  #Yeah.  Something# to cover them and keep them warm #[laughter].#

A.31:  #Keep them warm [laughter].  That's always beneficial too.#

B.32:  That's right [/children].

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Um,

A.35:  Well I think most of my hobbies are, I don't really have any handicrafts
that I can speak of.  I've done some woodworking type things but, uh, uh, I
don't really consider yard work a hobby either.  I guess #it's, uh,# 

B.36:  #I think# it could be.  I do a little bit of gardening.

A.37:  Yeah, I do some of that and I, I must admit that I do enjoy a certain
amount of it.  I guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that
it becomes somewhat --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- less of a hobby.

B.40:  It's more tedious.

A.41:  Yeah.  But, um, [lipsmack] I'm,

B.42:  [Children].

A.43:  interested in music so I do a few things in that regard.

B.44:  Oh, what do you do?  [/Children].

A.45:  Well, I, uh, uh, my children are, uh, learning to play the piano. 

B.46:  Oh, wonderful.

A.47:  And it's been ages ago since I played,

B.48:  [Noise].

A.49:  but I still like to sit down and, and play around with the piano myself,

B.50:  [Children].

A.51:  some.  And, I have twelve year old daughter that's far surpassed any
ability that I ever [laughter] --

B.52:  Huh.

A.53:  -- have had.  Um, 

B.54:  I would love for my girls to take piano lessons but we've been unemployed
for a while so I haven't had a chance to do that.  So, 

A.55:  And, uh, also there's an instrument of all things called a recorder, 
uh --

B.56:  [Child_talking] [whispering] Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and I, I play that some --

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  -- just by ear, I #don't# --

B.60:  #Uh-huh.#

A.61:  -- read music on that.  I used to play the clarinet and I still have one
or actually recently just got another one.  And, uh, I play it from time to
time as well.

B.62:  You're more interes-, interested in the instruments then in voice?

A.63:  Well, I am in a, a church choir.  In fact, it's that organization that,
uh, it is doing this fund raising using, uh, the {pause} --

B.64:  The T I thing.

A.65:  -- the T I thing --

B.66:  #Oh, that's neat.#

A.67:  -- #for, for# that as a matter of fact and that's, that's why I'm enrolled
in this, is our choir is doing it.  So, that --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- that I can pass a good time and I do enjoy that a great deal.  Um,
[lipsmack] and I bic-, I bike ride.  I guess that's really the closest thing
to a bonafide hobby that I #have.#

B.70:  #Uh-huh.#

A.71:  Just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and
an exercise.  So that's probably the extent of my hobbies.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  I've enjoyed music too.  Um, I was in choirs from fifth grade on
I think and --

A.73:  Um.

B.74:  -- and, uh, had just a little piano, a little violin [children].  I even
had a little bagpipe at one time [laughter].

A.75:  Did you really? Well, that's different.

B.76:  Yeah.  In, in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New
Jersey --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and they, uh, th-, --

A.79:  #Oh, you had to play the [laughter],#

B.80:  -- #they, just that# year they began teaching bagpipe for the, to put
together #group# --

A.81:  #Yeah.#

B.82:  -- for, it was fun.  It was interesting.

A.83:  I bet that was. 

B.84:  [Noise].

A.85:  That's very different.

B.86:  Yeah [noise].

A.87:  Uh.

B.88:  But, uh, {pause} we all enjoy music too.  Um, I don't know if they want us
to specifically to do more on the craft side or [noise],

A.89:  Well, I'm not sure that it really matters a whole lot #at all [laughter].#

B.90:  #Probably not [laughter].#

A.91:  That's sort of been my interpretation of, of these conversations.  Um,
[lipsmack] in fact I think we probably, uh, have talked long enough.

B.92:  Yeah, c-,

A.93:  Would be my guess.  So, 

B.94:  I, I don't know how long we've gone but,

A.95:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it's been adequate.  So, I enjoyed talking with you.

B.96:  Okay, nice to talk to you too.

A.97:  And good luck with your children.

B.98:  Okay, #thank you.#

A.99:  #Alright.#  Bye-bye.

B.100:  Bye-bye [/noise] {television or radio}.
