===========================================================================

B.1:  You ready?

A.2:  Yeah.

B.3:  Okay.  What have you seen lately?

A.4:  Well, uh, it's funny, when I tried,

B.5:  [Noise].

A.6:  to make the call the other days, I thought,

@B.7:  [Noise].

A.8:  I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES but today I went to 
see REGARDING WITH HENRY.

B.9:  Oh, I'm dying to see #that.#

A.10:  #It# was really good.  #We# --

B.11:  #Oh.#

A.12:  -- uh, Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital --

B.13:  Uh-huh [talking].

A.14:  -- and, uh, Jeff and Deeanna went and [swallowing] another friend in the
neighborhood, and, uh, we all liked it.  We had both moms and, uh, fifteen
year olds and a twelve year old and --

B.15:  Oh, my goodness.

A.16:  -- everyone enjoyed it.  #And, uh,# 

B.17:  #Oh, well# I am just dying to see it.  I went to dinner with some friends
last weekend and they said get a baby-sitter and we'll all go see REGARDING
HENRY --

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:  -- and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad.

A.20:  Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour
and --

B.21:  Oh.

A.22:  -- visiting friends and one thing and another.  A lot of the ones I had
wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston, uh, and his
friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I
thought well, I want to see this one, too.  So, [laughter] #we, uh,# 

B.23:  #Yeah.#

A.24:  I finally, it's my first summer movie [laughter].

B.25:  Oh my.  Well, let me see.  Was it, well, we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE
DALMATIANS last weekend and that may be, no, right before I went in the
hospital my girlfriend said come on, we're going to the movies.  And we won't,
well she goes all the time but I go maybe once every couple of months.

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  And when I go, I go see two at a time. [laughter] So we went to see
SOAPDISH, #and# --

A.28:  #Oh,# was that good?  Cause,

B.29:  -- Oh, hysterical.  We laughed so hard,

A.30:  [Breathing].

B.31:  it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the
audience was #laughing# --

A.32:  #Yeah.#

B.33:  -- #so hard.#

A.34:  #Well, I want# to see that and CITY SLICKERS both. #I love# --

B.35:  #Yeah# -- 

A.36:  -- #comedies. But, that's what I was [laughter],#

B.37:  -- #that's the other one that we went to that night.#

A.38:  [Laughter]  Oh, was it?

B.39:  And, my face hurt so bad,

A.40:  [Laughter]. 

B.41:  from laughing --

A.42:  Oh {very faintly}.

B.43:  -- because I love Billy Crystal.  And course, growing up on, on the back of
a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true
and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.  It was so funny.  Both of them
were great.

A.44:  Oh, well good.  I'm, I'm glad to hear that #because they,#

B.45:  #Oh, they are,# are we just laughed so hard.  And like I said, with CITY
SLICK-, I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball and it is so overacted that
you're just hysterical --

A.46:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.47:  -- you know.  Just, they just carried it off, 

A.48:  [Noise].

B.49:  to the tee.

A.50:  Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S --

B.51:  #No.#

A.52:  -- #that# was out a couple of year's ago.  They had a free showing at the
Berkeley, um, United Artist.

B.53:  How neat.

A.54:  And, [breathing] I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend
and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd
try it, you know, free movie.

B.55:  Shoot, yeah.

A.56:  It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing,
SOAPDISH, too.  I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came #out.#

B.57:  #Oh# yeah.

A.58:  And the whole theater was hysterical and it's just, it's just goofy.  I
mean, it's, uh, if you have a chance to rent it, at least, or it should be
#out on T V, I would think,#

B.59:  #Yeah, I think it is.#  I think it is.

A.60:  Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy, make your cheeks hurt
laughing.  Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know --

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  -- I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, #with# -- 

B.63:  #Oh gosh# --  

A.64:  -- #everyone laughing.#

B.65:  -- #I never laughed.#  And people were just screaming and applauding and,
you know, it was just hysterical.

A.66:  Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery [laughter].

B.67:  Oh, me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.

A.68:  Yeah [laughter].

B.69:  I mean I'm getting around real good and I'm just still real sore. 

A.70:  Yeah.

B.71:  And today I was, I, course I went back to work two weeks after, #uh# --

A.72:  #Oh,# gosh.

B.73:  -- but see I don't have permanent work.  I, right now I'm working with a
temporary agency.  And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went
up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software
for free.

A.74:  Oh.

B.75:  Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what
everybody wants, and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.  And I said,
yeah, and I went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from
that.  And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days
a week.  And so I went to my doctors last Thursday, 

A.78:  [Cough].

B.79:  and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh, you're just
healing really well, I just can't get over this.  He says, in two weeks you
can go back to doing your crazy normal things.  If you want to play ball, you
can go play ball.  He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like
playing ball but you can -- 

A.80:  Yeah [laughter].

B.81:  -- if you want to.  And, uh, you know, he was teasing me and he says, yeah,
you'll be out there waterskiing, I can just see it #now.#

A.82:  #[Laughter].#

B.83:  And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.  You've only
got two more weeks.  I said okay fine, I, I will, I will [laughter].  Whatever
you call easy, I'll do it, you know.  [Lipsmack] But and I've been out trying
to find a job because this is [noise] just not cutting it.

A.84:  Yeah. Yeah {very faintly}.

B.85:  And so, I don't, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when
I was, when I'm still sort of on the sore side.

A.86:  Yeah {very faintly}.

B.87:  But, well, wha-, what's your next, have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet?  

A.88:  No, that was one, uh, Jay got to see [laughter] with a friend and #so
I# --

B.89:  #[Lipsmack]  Uh.#

A.90:  -- and to try and, uh, try and find time it's hard, uh, with Jim's
schedule, too, just to get a time #that we can both go.#

B.91:  #Oh yeah.#

A.92:  And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh,
we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for
our age group [laughter] --

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  -- and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too.  Uh, and that's what he
would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too, but knew that, uh, we've,
we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.  We're really
enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing, uh --

B.95:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.96:  -- #there's# just not a time, enough time to do it all and he said, well,
realistically [laughter],

B.97:  #Yeah.#

A.98:  #You know, he# knew he couldn't get them all in.  But, uh, Jay really
liked ROBIN HOOD.  Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they
thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics.  He
said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big
but the, the fire scenes and the dra-, #you know# --

B.99:  #Uh-huh.#

A.100:  -- that action part is fantastic.  But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.
It was real different then you'd expect, #but h-# --

B.101:  #Oh# really?

A.102:  -- but he enjoyed it and #so,#

B.103:  #Well I went,# course I am a Kevin Costner fan.

A.104:  Yeah, me too.  #And# --

B.105:  #Supreme.#

A.106:  -- yeah, I really, uh, like him a lot.  Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES
was the last movie we had #seen# --

B.107:  #Uh-huh.#    

A.108:  -- #for several months but,#

B.109:  #Gosh, was that wonderful.#

A.110:  It was, I, uh, [lipsmack] in fact, uh, a friend from Germany was visiting
in March and we wanted, we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to
see it.  We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him #to
see it, too.#

B.111:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.112:  Uh, I just thought that was terrific.  And I really enjoy Harrison Ford
which is one of the reasons #I wanted to see,# 

B.113:  #I do, too.# I think he's really good.

A.114:  And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.  That's not an easy part to play,
I, I don't think {very faintly}.

B.115:  I wouldn't think.  Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night
so I sort of think I may go do that.

A.116:  Yeah.  That's at, that one won't your sides [laughter]. 

B.117:  Good [laughter].

A.118:  Um, it, was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE
DALMATIANS?  Or, 

B.119:  I hav-, my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley
and Jamie's age {voices begin to fade}.

A.120:  Uh-huh.

B.121:  And we went to the,
