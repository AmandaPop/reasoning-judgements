Speaker B and sounded like a lawn edger or mower.

===========================================================================

@A.1:  Uh, do you want to give a start on it?  

B.2:  Well, I think for me, I, I'm from Alabama.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  South Alabama, and so I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Uh, in a pretty liberal family for, for that area at the time. 

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  And so I was very much a part of all the, uh [breathing], you know, what
was going on there.

A.9:  Uh-uh.  

B.10:  Uh, my parents are pretty active and, uh, it was very scary and, but now
we've seen, you know, [breathing] uh, black people have a lot more civil
rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, you know, twenty years
ago.

A.11:  Oh, definitely.  

B.12:  There's still a lot to be [breathing], you know, to be accomplished, but --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of
because I can remember, you know, separate public restrooms and separate water
fountains and --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- sitting in the back of the bus and everything.  

A.17:  [Throat_clearing] You can relate to that.  Now see, we didn't, we don't
have any of that because, well, like, we live in the country --

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- in Clarion County and, uh, we really didn't have things like that going
on --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- that we, you know, uh, ran into.  So we kind of, uh, I guess when I
think of social changes, I think, think more of, uh [lipsmack], uh, visiting
habits of families --

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  -- and such.  

B.24:  Well, that's true.  

A.25:  Uh,  

B.26:  That's a good one right there.  

A.27:  Yeah, that there's less visiting done, I think, on a whole than there used
to be.  Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or
not, you went visiting [laughter].  And, uh, today, you know, people, they do
visit, but it's not quite the same as, uh, what it was, say, twenty years ago,
thirty years ago.

B.28:  Right.  And I grew up in, out in the country, too, basically, in a rural
area --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- and with lots of family.  

A.31:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.32:  And so we were always at family in different p-, -- 

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  -- family members' homes.  

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  But even now, you know, they don't even do that.  

A.37:  Well, they're so spread out, I think has a lot to do with it.

B.38:  Well, and they're so busy.  

A.39:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.40:  People, people's personal schedules are so busy.  

A.41:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.42:  Mainly because, I, a lot of it has to do, I think with more women 
working --

A.43:  Right, right.

B.44:  -- in our family, you know, twenty years ago, not that many of the women
worked.

A.45:  That's right, yeah.  

B.46:  And now, uh, almost all the women work.  

A.47:  The majority, yeah.  

B.48:  And, so that means, you know, a lot of [lipsmack], a lot of the social
visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women --

A.49:  Probably, because when you work -- 

B.50:  -- at that time.  

A.51:  -- [laughter] you -- 

B.52:  Right.  And now,  

A.53:  -- don't really care to go out and visit as much.  

B.54:  That's right.  

A.55:  And, uh,  

B.56:  And now, uh, I mean my mother does not work and, and she, you know, she's
f-, finds herself pretty alone a lot --

A.57:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- because most of her friends are working women.  

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  But even just social visits, people don't do that anymore.  You're right.

A.61:  No, huh-uh, they don't do as much.  

B.62:  And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people --

A.63:  Uh-huh.   

B.64:  -- anymore.  There's a real,  

A.65:  You have to make arrangements or have -- 

B.66:  Right, you know, you don't want to,  

A.67:  -- an invitation or,  

B.68:  You want to make sure it's okay or,  

A.69:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.70:  I guess we don't not to make, invade people's privacy or whatever.

A.71:  Well, that could be part of it.  I don't know for sure what it is.  I know
our children mostly are scattered out at a distance, so we really don't have
that even.  We don't,

B.72:  Well, out of, out of fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us
don't live within fifty miles.

A.73:  Oh, really?  

B.74:  And th-, and most live within ten --

A.75:  Oh, that's pretty good.  

B.76:  -- or, or twenty.  So, but that's, you know, that is rural, it's a rural
family and --

A.77:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- most people didn't go away.  I'm just one of the two --  

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  -- out of fifteen -- 

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  -- that don't live in the, you know, even in the same state. 

A.83:  Well, apparently there must be work available, for those -- 

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  -- that are,  

B.86:  There is in that area.  

A.87:  Uh-huh.  Because around here, there's really nothing for the young people,
no good, I mean there's jobs.  There's minimum wage jobs, but, uh, to make a
good living, there really, around here, there just isn't too much.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  And I guess, you know, that would greatly affect social ch-, i.
e., social change.

A.89:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.90:  Probably the job market has alwa-, and the, the economy -- 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- has always affected, uh, social change.  

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  Probably.  

A.95:  So, [lipsmack] well, there's the main things I can think of.  I really
tried to think of some other things and I couldn't really,

B.96:  Well, I think just, also, you know, the women's movement, too, has affected
a lot of social change.

A.97:  Yeah, definitely.  

B.98:  Uh, people -- 

A.99:  Some good -- 

B.100:  -- marry,  

A.101:  -- and some bad [laughter].  

B.102:  Yeah.  People marry later.  

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  I mean basically, I think, now, again, where I'm from in, in Alabama that's
not necessarily true --

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- because people do still get married right out of high school.

A.107:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.108:  But now out here in Texas where I am now, that's very unusual. 

A.109:  They'd rather get their life started first before,    

B.110:  Most people get marrie-, I mean get, go to college or at least get a job
and even, you know, people are, seem to, a lot of people seem to [breathing]
be engaged for a long time before they get married --

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- because they do want to be financially set up.  

A.113:  Yeah, well, even to get school finished, I think, a lot of times it's
better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in.  Because a
marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration [laughter] and if you're busy
with school it's, I think it's really difficult for a family.

B.114:  Right.  But probably, uh, you know, more women being in, in the work force
also greatly, greatly affects social change.

A.115:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.116:  Because it affects child care and,  

A.117:  Right, right.  

B.118:  Uh [lipsmack],  

A.119:  Yeah, I know my, my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh, she has two little
boys and they, they've been in day care since, you know, one's four and one's
one --

B.120:  Right.  

A.121:  -- and they've done well [noise].  Now, I wouldn't want to do it that way,
but, uh, she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted.

B.122:  Well, and they're, you know, they're, they're saying right now, we don't
know what, we just now are seeing the effects of day care on --

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  -- the generation that's just now coming into -- 

A.125:  That's right, yeah.  

B.126:  -- the work force and in their twenties.  

A.127:  Yes, uh-huh.  

B.128:  They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care.

A.129:  That's right, yeah.  

B.130:  And so, you know, [/noise] it remained to be seen exactly what that, what
that does.

A.131:  Uh-huh.  Now, I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter.  She's just eight
weeks old, so this will be new for me [laughter].

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  So, uh, but the others I'm too far away to help them out at all.

B.134:  Where do they live?  

A.135:  Uh, well, I have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh.  One in
Maryland and one in Connecticut.  A son in Connecticut.

B.136:  Well, they're not too far, though.  

A.137:  No, but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and, uh, it's too
far to, you know, really go too often.

B.138:  Uh-huh.  

A.139:  Pittsburgh's not quite so bad.  It's just a couple hours.  Maryland, maybe
five hour drive.

B.140:  Well, I live like fourteen hours from home.  

A.141:  Uh-huh.  That's worse yet.

B.142:  In fact I'm,  

A.143:  [Laughter]. 

B.144:  I'm driving tomor-, I'm, I'm driving home tomorrow, so,

A.145:  Oh, are you really?  

B.146:  To go be there for the Fourth of July.  

@@A.147:  Do you, uh, stay overnight on the way, or you,  

B.148:  No, I can drive it all.  It's just me, 

A.149:  You're young.   

B.150:  So I can make it.  

A.151:  How old are you?  

B.152:  I'm thirty-five.  

A.153:  Okay, well you're young enough yet to [laughter], 

B.154:  Although it's, it's, it is pretty, I don't know, I don't enjoy it that
much.

A.155:  Uh-huh.  

B.156:  It's pretty much like get there and,  

A.157:  It's work to get there.  Yeah.  

B.158:  It's just not that pleasant.  

A.159:  Yeah.  

B.160:  Even with other people, I basically just don't like to drive that far.

A.161:  Uh-huh.  Now my son, they, they, flew, he rebuilt a Aranca Chief, airplane,
and they flew down last weekend.  They came down in it.  And it still took a
long time because it's not a fast, it's not a high-speed airplane.

B.162:  Uh-huh.   

A.163:  But they enjoyed in thoroughly.  So,  

B.164:  When you say you're in the second phase of this project, what is the
second phase of it?

A.165:  I'm not sure, but you have to change phones.  You have to call from
another, a different,

B.166:  Oh.
