=====================================================================

B.1:  Okay, uh.

A.2:  Do you have annual family reunions or,

B.3:  Uh, yeah, uh, our, the my mother's side of the family is quite large, or
well, was quite large at one time, [laughter] and, uh, [throat_clearing] they,
uh, for as long as I can remember, have had, uh, a yearly reunion, um, back,
uh, early on they used to, to rotate them from hou-, from som-, to, to
different people's houses,

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  in the family.  [sigh] And,

A.6:  All local.  Were they like all in Dallas?

B.7:  Uh, no, no not, no, this was, well, I am actually from Mississippi, and,

A.8:  Oh.

B.9:  so that's, it, it was around there generally.

A.10:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.11:  Uh, that's where the family --

A.12:  Just from city to city then (( )).

B.13:  -- grew.  Yeah, and it was not only in Mississippi, in some other places,

A.14:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.15:  as well, so.  It was, uh, it was a big deal, but, uh, they tried to, to
centralize it in one spot.  So, in the past couple of years they had it at a
state park every year.

A.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.17:  We rent a pavilion and, [inhaling] and do that and that's usually works out
to be pretty good.  And, uh, they will rent a pavilion on a weekend, and 
uh [throat_clearing],

A.18:  Do you go back?

B.19:  I have not gone back lately.  In fact, uh, this past Sunday was the, was
the reunion, but I did not get to go.  Uh, I have, 

A.20:  Is it choice or just business or,

B.21:  Not getting to go.  

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  Uh, just, uh, the distance involved and,

A.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.25:  uh, just not, I have a younger daughter now and, uh, I, it's kind of hard
to get her, [throat_clearing] get her there,

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  and everything.  But I am going to, to, uh, hopefully next year get to go
back, cause, uh, a lot of the family has not, uh, on her side, my mother's
side, has not seen, you know, my daughter, so [inhaling].

A.28:  Oh.  Do you have brothers and sisters?

B.29:  I have one brother, so.

A.30:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And, is your mother still living?

B.31:  Yes.

A.32:  Oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway.  Would you not?

B.33:  Right, yeah.

A.34:  I mean, either way there was family reunion time,

B.35:  Right, I, I usually see her a,

A.36:  or not,

B.37:  couple times a year so that's no, no ((big)) thing.  But, uh, I, uh, I do,
I do enjoy the reunions.  The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we
had them, uh, they were mainly [sigh] my mother's [sigh],

A.38:  Relatives, right.

B.39:  uh, father's.  My mother's father's family had quite a few,

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  uh, brothers and sisters.  So, it was a large reunion of, of, of that
group, uh, from that descendants.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  And, uh, a lot of those people have, and at time, you know, they all knew
one another.

A.44:  Right, right.

B.45:  And now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are d-, have,
uh, have died off, or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives
of, of,

A.46:  The next generation, uh-huh.

B.47:  of that group.  [sigh] And so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used to
be.  So, I think people feel less of a desire to really go.  I know that,

A.48:  Wh-, why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?

B.49:  Well, I, I just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-, when, [sigh] when
they were a-, you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or
they were all in the same ar-, geographical location.

A.50:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.51:  You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they
were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together,

A.52:  Right, right.

B.53:  in one small community.  

A.54:  Right.

B.55:  And as, as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved
away and so forth.  And now [breathing] when they come together it's, it's
generally, [inhaling] you know, like say the kids of those people who are not,
you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the,
[inhaling] the closeness that they used to be there.

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  Which is a shame but that's just how it is.  My mother was complaining
last year about th-, you know, it's dwindling down every year, you know,
that's just, I think --

A.58:  Is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe ((yes)),

B.59:  -- that's just [throat_clearing],

A.60:  we get so involved in our work lives and [sigh] just,

B.61:  Well, yeah.

A.62:  social lives and so forth.

B.63:  Yeah, that's, uh, yeah, I think that's some of it.  But, you know, I have,
uh, I, I, it's just the way, you know, I think society is now, is that we are
not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  It's more of a, you know, a smaller, [inhaling] smaller unit, and you
know, we, [inhaling] we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate
family,

A.66:  Right, right.

B.67:  as opposed to the extended family.  Of people that we may or may not
remember or know, you know, very well.  Uh [sigh], 

A.68:  (( )) It really makes an effort on, to,

B.69:  Right, 

A.70:  do this anymore.

B.71:  it requires a lot of effort to, to,

A.72:  Right, right.

B.73:  to do that sort of thing.  I mean, I, I used to enjoy going, I mean I
still do kind of enjoy it, but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people
there that I really, really enjoy seeing.

A.74:  Right, right.

B.75:  You know, I, it's going just for the sake of getting together, I think for
the family.  And,

A.76:  Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in
that group?

B.77:  [Throat_clearing] Uh, 

A.78:  On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.  

B.79:  Um, um, no, not really.  Tha-, in that, but, then again, uh, well, I, you
know, I have some aunts that, uh, I, I, I do.  That's about th-, my mother's
sisters,

A.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.81:  you know, but I feel closer to them, because I kind of grew up with them.
But,

A.82:  Right.

B.83:  [Inhaling] But, uh, as, you know, for the rest of that group, no not
really.  Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those
people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion, so, uh --

A.84:  Right, right.

B.85:  -- you do not really feel that [sigh] that really close to them.

A.86:  Right.  In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together [throat_clearing]
every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City.  They had
chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough
people that were willing to go that far,

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas,
Oklahoma area.  And, uh, [swallowing] so they cancelled that one and, uh, are
looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family
letter,

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  that circulates, and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you
do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the,
your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order.  And
then, [sigh] about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and
when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know
anything about this person.  You have,

B.91:  That's a good idea.

A.92:  read something about what is going on and [inhaling] about their children
and so forth.  So, you are kind of,

B.93:  Right.

A.94:  half way acquainted that way.  [inhaling]  And that,

B.95:  Yeah.

A.96:  that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each
other, I think.

B.97:  Right.

A.98:  We tried to start that in my husband's family.  His mother's side decided
they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and I said, well
let's start this letter, and it just never (( )) my husband's sisters started
it and sent it to us and that's as far as [laughter] it got.  I sent it,

B.99:  Yeah.

A.100:  on to the next one, and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to
the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona,

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  for that family.  [inhaling] We are real glad we got together because
since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one
sister-in-law of the original family left.  And the sister-in-law died and the
sister is in a nursing home, so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two
years ago.
