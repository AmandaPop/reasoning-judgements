=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot and it's been humid.  I
don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high
for, uh, this late into, uh, well, it's not really late into the summer, but
the, the humidity has hung around all of June.

B.2:  Yeah.  Are you native to this area?  

A.3:  No, I grew up in Michigan, so, uh,   

B.4:  Oh, okay.  

A.5:  But I've been, I've been in Texas for fifteen years.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  So, uh, but, you know, I know the summers get hot but -- 

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  -- it certainly, uh, this humidity has just really hung on there.

B.10:  Yeah.  Yeah, it seemed like, well, you know, last year was so strange
having all those heavy, heavy rains in April and this year we really didn't
have heavy rains until May.  Kind of like pushed the season back a little
farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity
and it just tried to rain, I mean, I was coming in from my car just a few
minutes ago and it was trying to rain which --

A.11:  Yes.  

B.12:  -- seems strange to have it raining in July.  Normally we don't have too
much, uh, humidity or, or, uh, rainy time when it's past June.

A.13:  Oh, that's right, that's right.  I can remember it not, it's really August
that it happens.  You get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been
so dry --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- and it just gets so dry and, the earth opens up.  I can remember the
first year I moved here --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- and it didn't rain, I moved here like in late August and it didn't rain
from August until December and,

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  I went home and told it just doesn't rain in Texas.  I mean it was great
after growing up in Michigan and not, and al-, you know, every day was cloudy,
almost every day was cloudy and I, you sort of forget how much it did rain and
coming here and then it didn't rain, it was just wonderful.

B.20:  Well, yeah, see I, I lived in, uh, Ohio mainly.  I lived in, uh, Pontiac
just a little while before I came --

A.21:  Oh, yeah.  

B.22:  -- down here and, you know, so many times when you were trying to schedule
outdoor activities, you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not
because of the weather.  It might rain on your little parade.

A.23:  That's right, that's right.  

B.24:  You know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some
activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it
getting rained out.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do.  

A.27:  That's right.  

B.28:  What part of Michigan were you living in?  

A.29:  Oh, I grew up in Dearborn -- 

B.30:  Okay.  

A.31:  -- which is a suburb of, of Detroit. 

B.32:  Yeah, yeah.

A.33:  You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is, so, uh,

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  [Laughter] Anyway, yeah.  

B.36:  What brought you down here?  

A.37:  Oh, a teaching job.  

B.38:  So you teach in Plano schools?  

A.39:  Yeah, I did, I did for a while, uh-huh.  So, I'm home with, home with two
children, so, uh,

B.40:  Oh. 

A.41:  So, 

B.42:  Okay {faint}.

A.43:  New career.  

B.44:  Okay.  

A.45:  New career but, uh, anyway, so that kind of, uh, well, I had been down
here to visit so I (( )) school and said hey, let's, you know, find a place
that has a nice job and, uh, that's how it worked out.

B.46:  Well, yeah, I think a lot of people were, uh, leaving Michigan all about
the time I came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a
mass exodus.

A.47:  Oh, yeah.  

B.48:  You know, the, the little joke about, will the last person leaving Michigan
just turn out the light [laughter].

A.49:  Oh, well, it's a nice place, you know, I mean it's, it's a nice, that's a
nice place, though.

B.50:  Well, you know, I, I said I lived in, uh, the Pontiac.  I didn't live in
the city of Pontiac, I lived to the west of it.  Uh, I forget the, the county,
but you know where all the lakes are around there.

A.51:  Okay, sort of.  

B.52:  I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.  It was real close to
where I worked.  It was only like four miles to work and it was wonderful
being on the lake like that.  You know, in the summer, you feel like you're,
you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and
everybody's, you know, out enjoying the water and such, and, uh, in the winter
time the lakes froze over, you could still kind of go sledding and such out
there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those
lakes.  There's lots of really small ones out there.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  You know, like maybe a mile, two long.

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  That's enough to, uh, do some boating -- 

A.57:  That's right.  

B.58:  -- and it was lots of fun.

A.59:  That's right.  Lake, I think Lake Whitmore is the only one I have real
memories of.

B.60:  Um.  

A.61:  Which is, well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor, so it's
probably out in that direction, but that's the only one I probably could 
name --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- after all these years [laughter] so,  

B.64:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.65:  But, uh, 

B.66:  But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you
know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was
grand.  And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all
those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,
but there was quite a few lakes all around there.  It seemed like, it was
almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where
I was.  ((I said)) I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac, I was way out to the
west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits and it was really
nice out there.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  We had, uh, Pine Knob -- 

A.69:  Oh. 

B.70:  -- you know, to go skiing --

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  -- and stuff.  

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  So there were things around there.  Really was pretty nice.  

A.75:  Sure, sure, and d-, isn't that where they have a summer music festival
there, too?

B.76:  Right, right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter
time they make snow and have a ski slope.

A.77:  That's right, that's right.  I know, we used to, we, we didn't do a lot of
it, but we did.

B.78:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.79:  We did, so those are always fun.  And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski
slope --

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  -- that we went to, so, uh,   

B.82:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.83:  It was nice.  I always tell people [laughter] that in the winter we use, we
used to, uh, my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn
the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.

B.84:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  

A.85:  So but, uh, you know, we probably did some ice skating on it, but then it
chipped, chipped and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty
uneven so,

B.86:  Yeah, yeah.  We used to have a Christmas time, uh, some of our relatives
would come up from Alabama, and I think most times we would have snow around
Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts.

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  You know, because they were from Alabama where it never snowed --

A.89:  Oh. 

B.90:  -- and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there
and playing in it, you know, eternally.

A.91:  Oh.  

B.92:  [Laughter]. 

A.93:  Oh, right, right.  If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be
okay at Christmas time.

B.94:  My first winter here, I, I came down in, uh, early eighty-two and there was
just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be-, couple days before
Christmas.  It lasted only a few hours, like --

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  -- by noon it was gone.  

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go
to work because the roads are all, you know, snow [laughter].  And I was
laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke, ha ha.

A.99:  [Laughter]. 

B.100:  They said, no really, there's snow and there was, but a very short time and
the weather got warm so quick --

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  -- it just melted it all away.  

A.103:  Yeah, yeah, I know.  

B.104:  Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun.  

A.105:  No, that's not fun either, so, uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy
snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so,

B.106:  [Laughter]. 

A.107:  But, uh, well we have, our house is kind of on a little hill, so, uh, we
get the sled out and, uh, the kids go down the hi-, the hill on the sleds when
it's icy, I mean they just go down the ice.

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  [Laughter] And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.  

B.110:  [Laughter] [noise].

A.111:  I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold
weather and get out there.

B.112:  Oh, yeah.  I think it's fun, even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out
there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a
little bit.  I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad, but if you get on the,
the, uh, grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, you know, not
slip and fall.  I mean, first,
