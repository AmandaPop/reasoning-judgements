=======================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, do you want to start?

B.2:  Okay, uh, I haven't, I don't know that much about the possi-, what the
possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury, but, uh, I
think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having
twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be
new-, unanimous.

A.5:  Now that, do you, do you agree, that they should all be unanimous?

B.6:  [Lipsmack] [breathing].  I don't,  

A.7:  Or even, even in, uh, like they said, you know, lesser, you know, trials,
you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous
still?

B.8:  I don't know, I don't know if I feel, I don't feel real strongly about
that.  If the, uh, the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a
lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, uh, I didn't think that you
really had to have a, a jury [laughter].

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  Unless, I guess, if you request one you can.  But I think, yeah, making it
unanimous sometimes might, uh, let, the only thing, it might let more people
get off.  I don't think it would convict any more people.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And we have so many people already, you know, the jails are already
overloaded.

A.13:  Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.  I mean if one
is determined that it's, you know, that he feels that he's, you know, going
against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.  So I don't
know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets
[noise] tired of fighting, you know, just gives in.

B.14:  Yeah.  Well, if it's, no, but they, they, what if they never agree.
Doesn't it just, uh, do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or,

A.15:  And they have to stay in until they all agree --

B.16:  Agree {faint}.

A.17:  -- yeah.  I don't know, I'm not sure if they go, I mean to twelve new
people or what they do exactly, but I do know for sure that all twelve have to
agree before he can either, you know, either he or she can either go free or
to jail, either one.

B.18:  Yeah, and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a
little stringent [laughter].

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Especially because there's twelve.  The thing about it is, I think jury
selection, too, a lot of times, uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose
who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way, too.

A.21:  That's, that's just it.  I don't understand.  You're supposed to, you know,
go in if you have, you know, like if you've never heard of the people before
or anything, but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and
everything else how you can get people that are total, totally impartial to
it.

B.22:  I know.  I don't think, well, I guess you really can't, but the other thing
is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't
swayed by the news either.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  So, uh, but then, again, you know, they, the, one of the questions they
asked is, should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky, too,
because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, you
know, they have to, they stay till they retire --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too
[laughter].

A.27:  Yeah, I agree.  I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone.  Not
only, you know, that they have to stay in there, but, hey, how many times have
you heard of judges being bought over.

B.28:  I know.   

A.29:  You know, so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has
the presiding, you know, uh, vote.  I think he can be, you know, I, I don't
know if it's the way it is in real life, but I've seen it on T V where the
juries go one way and the judge to-, totally finds it obnoxious and he
completely, you know, goes the other way.

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or
what.

B.32:  I think in some cases they are.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is --

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- if it's, you know, so that's another thing where they have the power,
but maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair
or less fair.  Maybe there should be more than twelve people [laughter].  I
don't,

A.37:  Oh, oh, my God.  If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long
they'd be sitting [laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] I know.  I don't know.  

A.39:  I, I think it's just, I don't, I mean, I think it's as fair as it can
possibly get, but I just think it's really har-, you know, I mean, some cases
go on for years, you know.

B.40:  That's true, and I've never been on jury duty, but they have to keep going
and going and going.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  And lose their, not lose their jobs, but not go to work.

A.43:  Yeah.  I, I don't know how it could be more fair.  Course, I don't know.
Maybe --

B.44:  It could be,

A.45:  -- maybe they should be asking someone that's been on, on trial before.

B.46:  Really, I've never seen one in real life either so I don't have, you know,
I don't know that much about it, but I think, it seems that we have a, a
pretty fair system compared to other countries.  I don't know how we could
make it more fair.  I really don't.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  The unanimous vote is questionable, though.  And, and how, how many cases
get juries might --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- want to be reviewed, too.  

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  Because, uh, [breathing] I don't know if you should really have a jury for
s-, a small infraction.  But I'm not sure who gets them [laughter].

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  I don't know anything [laughter].  

A.55:  I know.  I don't know that much about it either.  I just, I don't know.  I,
I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, you know, how they
can make it more fair for them or not, but then again, maybe they should be
there so that is fair.

B.56:  Right.  

A.57:  I don't, I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way.

B.58:  No, whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, uh,
unique --

A.59:  Uh-huh.   

B.60:  -- I think, when they started it.  

A.61:  Yeah.  

@@B.62:  So, how long do we need to talk? [Laughter].  Do you know?  

A.63:  Oh, I think we can hang up anytime [laughter].  

B.64:  Okay.  Uh, in, uh, what do I do now?  Do you know?  Anything, or just --

A.65:  No, I don't -- 

B.66:  -- wait for someone else.  

A.67:  -- what else to say, so.  

B.68:  Okay, well it was nice talking with you.  

A.69:  It was nice talking to you, too.  Bye.  

B.70:  Thanks.  Bye-bye.
