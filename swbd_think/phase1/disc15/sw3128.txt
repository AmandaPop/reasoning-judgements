A.1:  Hello.

B.2:  Hello.

A.3:  Hi, my name is Leslie.

B.4:  Hi, Leslie, I'm Carol.

A.5:  Hi Carol.  Where you from?

B.6:  Uh, Plano, Texas.

A.7:  Oh, you're kidding, so am I.

B.8:  Oh, well, we're right here in town then, maybe we know each other
[laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, you're not from choir, are you?

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  Leslie who?

A.13:  Leslie French.

B.14:  Okay, what choir are you from?

A.15:  Uh, Christ United Methodist.

B.16:  Oh, of course, I'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy
Dillon.

A.17:  Oh, okay, I'm in the soprano parts.

B.18:  You're sop-, well, I, well we can chit chat easily without any sweat then.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  What a hoot.  

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  I, I'd forgotten about this thing, I have been so bad.

A.23:  Well, I have too.

B.24:  Oh, good.

A.25:  I have too, and I,

B.26:  Obviously it's working now, I sh-,

A.27:  I guess so --

B.28:  I will do better.

A.29:  -- I only had, uh, one other chance at this thing, and,

B.30:  Well, okay, let's, what are we going to discuss, Leslie?

A.31:  We're supposed to discuss food and cooking --

B.32:  Fine.

A.33:  -- and, uh, did it describe it to you at all?

B.34:  Well, it, I was hunting for all of my stuff and every time I'd press the
button they were already talking by the time my phone clicked back in --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- I have a cordless phone that doesn't do well.

A.37:  Okay, well, and it says, uh, which foods would you recommend, for a, uh,
menu for a dinner party, and then maybe we can share recipes what, what they,
what they kind of said.

B.38:  Great, we can do that --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- I don't care what you serve.

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  I'll let you go first.

A.43:  Okay.

B.44:  You're in charge of the call, you ready to press one.

A.45:  I'm pressing one right now,

B.46:  Go.

@A.47:  Okay [beep] Okay, well I was thinking about if I did a dinner party right
now I'd do a Mexi-, Mexican fair of sorts, because that's about the only thing
I'm creative at, and, uh,

B.48:  What kind of things would you put on it?

A.49:  Well, for appetizers I'd start with, you know, the typical cheese nachos
and, uh, melt the cheese over the chips and, uh, put some green pepper or I
mean, chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot, and then another
good, good, uh, recipe for appetizers is a bean dip.  I don't know if you've
ever done that, but you put just the refried beans --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and then a layer of, uh, of sour cream,

B.52:  Oh, that seven layer dip.

A.53:  Well, it doesn't really have seven layers --

B.54:  Okay.

A.55:  -- mine doesn't anyway --

B.56:  I guess,

A.57:  -- and then I put like a layer of cheese and then some salsa on top of
everything, and then you just use it for dipping your chip into.

B.58:  That's a wonderful recipe.

A.59:  Yeah, it's real good, and then, 

B.60:  What would you use for your main course?

A.61:  Probably go with fajitas, uh --

B.62:  Oh, yeah,

A.63:  -- season up some good chicken and beef and chop up a whole bunch of things
so that they could kind of pick and choose what they like and,

B.64:  That's an easy way to please everybody.

A.65:  Yeah,  

B.66:  That way if there's something that they don't want then they can just
simply leave it off on their own.

A.67:  That's right.

B.68:  That's a good idea.  

A.69:  So, I haven't done any dinner parties though lately [laughter].  I've just
been.

B.70:  Well, I'm a very casual informal person, so most of my quote dinner 
parties --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- would probably be very laid back.  We'd probably do ribs or chicken or
something like that on the grill --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- put with corn on the cob and maybe a tossed salad, fresh fruit, that
type of a thing.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  I'm a, I'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time --

A.77:  Yeah [laughter].

B.78:  -- and disposable plastic forks, throw them away for an easy cleanup --

A.79:  Uh-huh, uh-huh,

B.80:  -- so, I, [laughter] I'm afraid I not a real fancy, sit down, kind of use
your best china --

A.81:  Oh --

B.82:  -- dinner party kind.

A.83:  -- yeah, that's me too.  

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  In fact we don't even have our dining table yet, so, I guess we've been
pretty casual for most of everything.

B.86:  Well, my life is kind of casual so, my dinner parties would be also.

A.87:  Well, speaking of dinner parties, are we still doing this uh, [laughter]
um,

B.88:  Well, what's a good pot luck --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- for eight to ten people.  What do you,

A.91:  You know what I was planning on doing, I didn't know if it was needed, but
was a salad, I mean, that's, I didn't know if it had to be a casserole of
sorts.

B.92:  It can be anything --

A.93:  Okay.

B.94:  -- it can be anything.  I, I may just bring fresh fruit --

A.95:  Okay,

B.96:  -- because I know everybody will eat that, even though it's not, you know,
someone will bring a meat.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  If not, we go meatless, I don't care,

A.99:  That's right, yeah, it's kind of,

B.100:  Yeah, we don't, we don-, we eat too much meat at dinner parties anyhow
[laughter].

A.101:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's, that's my, my love of, if I'm not going to have
a full meal, is to make sure I get a good salad in there, and a good, you
know, thing of fruit, and that, that'll satisfy most anybody.

B.102:  I think they always go over well.

@@A.103:  Yeah, okay.  How long we supposed to talk on this about three minutes I
hope.

B.104:  I think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss.

A.105:  Yeah, okay, well, then if we're done, it's, all we do is just say good-bye,
right.

B.106:  Okay --

A.107:  Well. 

B.108:  -- I've enjoyed talking to you.

A.109:  Yeah, I'll get,

B.110:  If I have a Mexican dinner at any time, I'll do, 

A.111:  [Laughter].

B.112:  I think I'll run your, yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and --

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  -- the whole nine yards.

A.115:  Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

B.116:  Okay --

A.117:  Nice talking to you.

B.118:  -- I've enjoyed talking to you.  Bye.

A.119:  Bye-bye.
