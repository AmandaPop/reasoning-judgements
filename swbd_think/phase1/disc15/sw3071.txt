A.1:  [Laughter].

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about music.

B.4:  Okay.

A.5:  And, uh, let me go ahead and push one here. [tone] Uh, do you ha-, are you
a musician yourself?

@B.6:  Uh, well, I sing.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  I don't play an instrument.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Where, do you sing in, in a choir or a choral group?

B.10:  Oh, not right now.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  What kind of singing do you like to do?

B.12:  [Talking] Oh, pretty much anything.

A.13:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Um, are you, uh, are, are, have you, have you been singing a
long time or have you studied?

B.14:  Oh, yeah.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  And I've had some classical vocal training.

A.19:  Oh, really?

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Oh, great.  Did, did you do that in, uh, Texas, or somewhere else?

B.22:  No, I was in Europe.

A.23:  Oh.  Whereabouts?

B.24:  In, uh, in Germany.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Um, well, I likewise sang in high school
and in college in choirs, and then I didn't sing in a choral group, um, until
after I was, uh, married, and I sang in a couple of, uh, community choirs, and
then [breathing] um, waited for a while, and now I've, for about the last
eight years I've sung in a church choir here,

B.26:  Oh, yeah.

A.27:  in Texas.  And, um, so I, I enjoy,

B.28:  [Throat_clearing].

A.29:  ((just)) the chorals singing a lot,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  as well.  Um, are you a soprano, alto, or, 

B.32:  Soprano.

A.33:  A soprano.  Yeah, so am I.  Do you, and, uh, what kind of music do you like
to sing?  Um, you were saying you had classical training.  Do you have a
particular composer that you like or,

B.34:  Oh, well,

A.35:  a particular ((type))?

B.36:  as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  [Noise].

A.39:  I've been listening to, um, some, uh, some advertisements for MADAM
BUTTERFLY, and I'm wondering if you, if you have ever done anything like that,
have you ever done any, uh, if,

B.40:  No, no, 

A.41:  if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY.

B.42:  I haven't done, [noise] uh, I'd love to,

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  but, um, that's, uh, Puccini, I think, right?

A.45:  Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.  Um, MADAM BUTTERFLY was, um,

B.46:  [Cough].

A.47:  in Dallas, it's been two or three years ago now, and then I went to see
that, and,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  it was really wonderful.  It was particularly well, the acting was
particularly nice, I thought, and, um, so,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  it was quite popular.  Um, you don't play, um, an instrument so,

B.52:  No.

A.53:  uh, um, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or [laughter],

B.54:  Uh, I think it would be nice if I played the piano.

A.55:  Yeah, yeah.  That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who
sings or does, you know, some other kind of instrument, I think piano is
always good background,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  beginner.  Um, I played piano all through, well, I guess from the time I
was fi-, five until I graduated from college, and, uh, then I was a piano
teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school, so, um, that was
the instrument both of my children started on, but neither of them stayed with
it [laughter].

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  One of them, um, turned into a violist, and the other one is, the boy is,
um, guitar and, and percussion, so.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Um, but the, I, I think that the piano background is very, um, useful, and,
um, I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to
accompany yourself,

B.62:  Oh, yeah.

A.63:  just for practicing and so on.

B.64:  [Throat_clearing].

A.65:  Uh-huh.  Do you have any other kind of music that you like?

B.66:  Um, oh, I like to listen to all different kinds of music.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  I have a, I used to work with a fellow who had, um, although this
was a computer company, he had his, uh, P H D in musical, uh, I guess it was
in composition, actually, from University of North Texas, and, uh, yet when I
would go into his,

B.68:  [Music].

A.69:  his office every now and then, you never knew what kind of music he'd be
playing on the radio [/music] [laughter].  It may be country, it might be
classical, it might be rock, you know --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just
liked all kinds of music.

B.72:  Yeah [noise].

A.73:  And that was, that was neat for, for me to hear that somebody is,

B.74:  There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really
particularly like but, 

A.75:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, do you have any plans to, uh, do anything with your music
in the near future or,

B.76:  Well, [breathing] I have, I have like, we, I wish I could --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- but I, I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree
or,

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  um [phone_ringing],

A.81:  I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing, I'm not sure
where,

B.82:  [Phone_ringing]. 

A.83:  you are in Texas, but I do know that some communities have,

B.84:  [Phone_ringing].

A.85:  uh, community choruses and,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  uh, that's often a good way to get back into it again.  Um, it's not r-,
terribly demanding.  You might have to audition, but that probably wouldn't be
a problem, but, um, [lipsmack] there usually, you know, that they take tours
and things like that and you get to know --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- you know, people socially as well as, as in a musical setting, so --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- that's always fun.  I think that's, well, that's one reason why I have
enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music, but
we've gotten to know each other quite well, um, in, on a, a social level, and,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  and I think we sing better because of that.  I think, you know,

B.94:  That's good.

A.95:  I think we sing more like, uh, people who trust each other [laughter],

B.96:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.97:  which is really nice.  So, whereabouts in,

B.98:  [Throat_clearing].

A.99:  Texas are you, if I could ask?

B.100:  Oh, I'm in Flower Mound.

A.101:  Flower Mound, okay.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  Well, I'm in Plano, so, um, we're just not too far apart, actually.

B.104:  Yeah, that's pretty close.

A.105:  Uh-huh.  It was funny, um, [lipsmack] uh, it's, you know, I talk to people
all over, uh, Texas, um, and only one person outside of the coun-, uh, of the
state, so I'm always asking where, where in the state, you know, the person is
from if they're in Texas.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  Um, are, do you have a family?

B.108:  Um, I'm married.

A.109:  Uh-huh.  I was wondering if your, if your spouse, or if, you know, if you
had, uh, other musical people in your family.

B.110:  [Noise] I'm sorry?

A.111:  Uh, if you have other people in your family who are also musical.

B.112:  Oh, a little bit.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  [Throat_clearing].

A.115:  Do you come by it naturally?  Was your, were your parents that musical?

B.116:  Yeah, I think so.

A.117:  Yeah, yeah.  That often is the case, um, the, you know, it's, it, sometimes
it will skip.  Like my husband is not musical at all, but his mother is very
musical, and, um, and his children are very musical, so [laughter] you never
know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.  So, um, well,
I'm not sure how long we've talked.

@@B.118:  I think,

A.119:  I haven't paid, haven't been paying attention to the, to the clock.  But,
uh, I'll bet we've done, we've done at least five minutes.

B.120:  Probably [laughter].

A.121:  [Laughter] Well, I've enjoyed talking with you,

B.122:  Okay.

A.123:  uh, Becky, and, um, maybe we'll talk again.

B.124:  All right, thanks.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye.

B.126:  Bye-bye.
