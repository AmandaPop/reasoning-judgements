=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity, and I
had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working, uh,
this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal
on the column --

B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  -- and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights
would go out completely, which is even worse than them just not getting bright
[laughter].

B.4:  Exactly.

A.5:  And I had presumed that it was the switch, and, uh, this is, uh, an older
car, it's a seventy-two M G, so I had to mail order the part, uh, which I had
done, and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to
discover that that apparently is not the problem, it's not in the switch,
because it does the same thing with the new switch.

B.6:  Oh.

A.7:  So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that,
uh, you know, that they will accept it, although it's been removed from the
box it's obviously not been really used.

B.8:  Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably
the part that failed?

A.9:  Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring
diagram that I did have of the car --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.  I talked
to one mechanic about it, and he suspected the switch also.  Uh, but I've not,
you know, I really don't know what the problem might be.  It, it, the other
switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off,
which is on the dashboard --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow, but,

B.14:  Yeah, I know, uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh,
usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.  Do you have a separate
fuse for your high beam --

A.15:  I --

B.16:  -- as opposed to your low beam?

A.17:  -- I don't know, I should look at that.  I don't remember seeing one in
the, uh, in the diagram --

B.18:  Diagram.

A.19:  -- so I'll have to go back and look at that.

B.20:  Yeah, I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.  I know
sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same
unit, like the headlamp --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing, but
sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam
requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse.

A.23:  Yeah, that's a good idea.

B.24:  So, that's a possibility.

A.25:  What I've typically found when that, uh, companies are pretty good about
accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all, and
I hope that that's the case this time.

B.26:  Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts
for, uh, old imports?

A.27:  Right, exactly --

B.28:  Who,

A.29:  -- it's out of Kansas --

B.30:  Um --

A.31:  -- somewhere.

B.32:  -- so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that.

A.33:  No, it's not.  I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had
indicated was the right part for this car, but it is not either, it's
obviously doesn't quite fit, so it must be for a different year, so I'll have
to try to return that as well.

B.34:  Yeah, have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the
metroplex?

A.35:  Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car, because
I've owned this car since it was new, and, uh, but it's over like in the Brook
Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and --

B.36:  Oh, yeah.

A.37:  -- Inwood area --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and I hadn't used him for some years, and the last time I called him
back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of, uh, all import
cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and
{pause} German cars [laughter].

B.40:  I'll be darned.

A.41:  I'm not sure that he works on much else at all, but he doesn't work on
British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at
it.  So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person, as it turns out that
one, that shop is near where I now work.  So, I'll, uh, I should be able to
take it in and check that part out.  I've not had to exchange any other parts
recently, because they were defective.  Now, I've had, had pretty good luck, I
just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable
dual cassette players, uh, repaired.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  I purchased it at Sam's, and I had assumed that it had a ninety day
warranty, and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of
saving the receipt, because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole
year go by.  Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to
actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play, and as it
turned out, it had a full year's warranty, and I could have gotten it repaired
for free but --

B.44:  Oh, my goodness.

A.45:  -- I had to take it in, 

B.46:  [Throat_clearing].

A.47:  while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought
had long since been lost, uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I
had missed the window by about a week or two.

B.48:  Oh, no.

A.49:  So I didn't even, I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to
pick it up.  But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where
I've had to take a product back because of a defect.

B.50:  Well, ours wasn't within the last year.  I guess it's been within the last
two years, uh, Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new, and it's one with
the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh, I
don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control
and things of that sort, and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two
problems.  It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point
that we park on a hill, under our car port, and, it, when you first dropped it
into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley, and knowing
that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard, otherwise it would
just wrench control away from you.

A.51:  Good grief.

B.52:  And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be
driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet
stopped at the stop sign --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and the engine would just quit.  

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it
out, and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing, so they
adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away, so we ended up taking it back
again, and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time
around, but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service
and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever, and, and they
had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently
was a programming error --

A.57:  Huh.

B.58:  -- in the, uh, computer control unit, which fortunately they replaced under
warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty
dollar part --

A.59:  My goodness.

B.60:  -- and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine
--

A.61:  Huh.

B.62:  -- for a considerable period of time, and now it seems to be, we don-,
we're not experiencing the stalling, but we're still experiencing a very
uneven,
