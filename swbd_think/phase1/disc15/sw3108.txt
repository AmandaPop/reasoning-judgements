========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what movies have you seen recently, Valerie?

B.2:  Let's see, the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE.

A.3:  Oh, we haven't seen that one yet.

B.4:  Well, don't bother [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter] Oh, it wasn't that good.

B.6:  Well, oh, from a woman's point of view and it was very, uh, chauvinistic as
far as women go.  Uh, it was, it was entertaining, but, yeah, I don't think
the general audience would, would go for it.

A.7:  The most recent one that, uh, my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER.

B.8:  How was that?  

A.9:  That was excellent.  It was -- 

B.10:  That is one I've been dying to see.  

A.11:  -- just a really, a really funny movie.  At the same time, it had a story
line about people trying to find themselves.  There were parts that were sad.
I mean, it just ran the gamut of emotion.

B.12:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, and,   

A.13:  And, but it was just enter-, all around entertaining.  

B.14:  How long did that movie run?  

A.15:  Uh, it's still on, to the best of my knowledge.  

B.16:  But, I mean, time wise, how long, was it -- 

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  -- two hour or,  

A.19:  Uh, it's, I think it's less than two hours.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  

A.21:  We, we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter] That always seems to happen when you rent them, you know
[laughter].

A.23:  Yeah, but this one, it was fairly long.  I, I'm guessing probably an hour
and forty-five minutes, maybe.

B.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, and, uh, it,   

A.25:  But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and --  

B.26:  Was it, oh, good.    

A.27:  Bruno Kirby,  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- uh, who was the, oh, Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the
old cowboy.

B.30:  Oh, great.  

A.31:  So we really enjoyed that.  

B.32:  Oh, well, I'm looking forward to seeing that one.  That was next on our
list, so, uh,

A.33:  Yeah, I think that, uh, I can highly recommend that movie this, to see.

B.34:  Okay, okay, good deal -- 

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- good deal.  Do you rent movies very often, or,  

A.37:  Uh, we generally rent a couple a week.  Uh, in order to get a decent movie
to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday.

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  [Laughter]. 

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  They get -- 

B.42:  That's exactly right.  

A.43:  -- they get taken up at the store, so,  

B.44:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.45:  We will rent two or three movies on Thursday and, uh, with luck, you'll
have one or two that are good.

B.46:  Yeah, right, right.  

A.47:  Most of them are a coin flip [laughter].  

B.48:  [Laughter] Oh, gosh.  Yeah, yeah.  And we usually have, oh, [breathing],
we don't get out as much as we like.  We have two children, so we [laughter]
occasionally get out to the movies --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- but, uh, it's, it's fun, it's a fun thing to do to get out and --

A.51:  Yeah, well, 

B.52:  -- be entertained for once.  

A.53:  Quite frequently, we have our grandchildren on the weekends --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- and, uh, we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as
something else that we can see and,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  What ages are they?  Have you found -- 

A.57:  Uh,  

B.58:  -- trouble finding movies for them or,   

A.59:  Uh, generally try to stay in the at least P G range.  

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  The, uh, the oldest is nine, the youngest is three.  He doesn't really pay
attention.

B.62:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.63:  The five year old doesn't have the attention span, either.  

B.64:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.65:  But the, the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V [laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] Uh-oh, uh-oh, yeah. 

A.67:  So, 

B.68:  They have been doing that.  We've been waiting for a, a good movie out this
summer for the kids to see.  The last one they saw was HOME ALONE and, uh,
they enjoyed that, but, uh, I missed that one.  My husband took the kids to
see that one so,

A.69:  Yeah, my wife took, uh, I think the kids to see that one, but --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- we can generally find something at the store [baby_crying] for them to
watch.

B.72:  Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good deal.  

A.73:  The, uh, oh, we saw this movie, PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented, 
uh --

B.74:  Okay, let me think --  

A.75:  -- last weekend.  

B.76:  -- if I have rented that one.  

A.77:  Harrison Ford.  

B.78:  Harrison Ford and, how does the story line go?  

A.79:  It's, uh, he is a prosecuting attorney and, uh, [baby_crying] another
prosecutor in the, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered --

B.80:  Oh, okay, we haven't seen that one.  

A.81:  -- and he's trying to find it, but, course, it's one of these with a twist
where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's,

B.82:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.83:  And it's an extremely long movie.  It's, it's over two hours long.

B.84:  Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.  

A.85:  Which, uh, my wife enj-, she likes the suspense movies.  I enjoy --

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- them to a degree.  

B.88:  I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day, and then my
husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me, so I thought I better
save that one for another day [laughter].

A.89:  Save that for another day.  

B.90:  Yeah, because I think he'd like that one.  

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  You enjoyed that one, then.  

A.93:  Yeah, I think you, it's, uh, it's something I think you would enjoy, yes.

B.94:  Uh-huh, okay, well, that's a good one to put on the list.  

A.95:  It, it's like most suspense movies, what was it was on T V recently,
[baby_crying] uh, FATAL ATTRACTION.

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  It's one that, once you've seen it once [baby_crying] and, uh, the suspense
there is not really [baby_crying], you really can't see it again --

B.98:  Right, okay.  

A.99:  -- so you know all the story and who did what --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and when it happened, so -- 

B.102:  Uh-huh, okay.  

A.103:  -- once, once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that, then
it's, it's not good for a second watching particularly.

B.104:  Uh-huh, uh-huh [baby_crying].  

A.105:  At least I don't think so [laughter].  

B.106:  I don't think too many of them are anymore.  It's, it's a shame, but, 
uh,

A.107:  I don't know, we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times
[laughter].

B.108:  I know [laughter].  

A.109:  It's just slapstick comedy [laughter].  

B.110:  Oh, no [laughter].  Oh [groan].

A.111:  Sit there and laugh, and, my one grandson and I, my wife can't understand
it, but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE [baby crying] --

B.112:  Oh, gosh.  

A.113:  -- which is another funny one [laughter].  

B.114:  Yeah, we've heard about that one, but we haven't seen that one either
[breathing].  So, well, it sounds like you and your grandson like the same
kinds of movies.

A.115:  Yeah, we like to laugh [laughter].  

B.116:  [Laughter] Oh, God.  

A.117:  I, I have a theory.  I like movies for entertainment.  I don't want to --

B.118:  Right.

A.119:  -- uh, go away depressed -- 

B.120:  Right, right.  

A.121:  -- from watching a movie.  

B.122:  I agree, I agree.  

A.123:  Life's depressing enough [laughter].  

B.124:  That's for sure [laughter].  

A.125:  Well, I've certainly enjoyed talking with you.  

B.126:  Well, you, too, Jim.  

A.127:  Okay, bye.  

B.128:  Thanks for punching in and, uh -- 

A.129:  Have a nice weekend.  

B.130:  -- I hope you see a good movie soon.  

A.131:  Okay.  

B.132:  Okay.  

A.133:  Bye.   

B.134:  Bye-bye.
