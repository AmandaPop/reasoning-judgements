B.1:  [Noise]  #Okay.#

A.2:  #Um,# well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before.

B.3:  [Noise].

A.4:  Do you have children?

B.5:  No.
 
A.6:  No. Okay.  Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference --

B.7:  #Yeah.# 

@A.8:  -- #in how you# felt.  Um, what do you think about the proposal that all
young Americans should spend a year or two,

B.9:  I think it's a good idea.  I think everybody should, should, uh, put in
their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the
good of themselves.

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  I think it's, uh, would every-, everyone grow up and mature and, and
realize what this country's all about.

A.12:  I just, um, [lipsmack] I guess that's (( )), my, that's something that my
family has always believed strongly in, and, uh, I had opportunities in high
school, 

B.13:  [Noise].

A.14:  to work in some programs, um --

B.15:  Did you?  [Noise] {like something fell}.  Oh! {very faintly}.

A.16:  -- and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh,

B.17:  [Noise].

A.18:  [Sigh] it benefits the person doing it --

B.19:  #Uh-huh.#

A.20:  -- #so# much I don't think they realize and I, uh, [lipsmack] I, I think it
gives you a better perspective,

B.21:  [Noise].

A.22:  on life and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the
real world #and# --

B.23:  #Yeah.#

A.24:  -- and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.

B.25:  Really [laughter].  Yeah, I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few
things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to --

A.26:  #Yeah.#

B.27:  -- #go through,# you know, they, just, they were, they did things for
people,

A.28:  Yes.

B.29:  you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for
their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do.

A.30:  Yeah.  Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, my
first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the
question I thought, well that sounds wonderful.  And then, I wondered if
people were unwilling but, but I think even if you went in with a negative
attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.  Um, but I do know
through some organized groups like Scouts and church --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- um, they,

B.33:  [Noise].

A.34:  do still have opportunities.

B.35:  Yeah, that's probably true [noise].

A.36:  But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number #could,#

B.37:  #You know but# even, even through those groups, do you think that they
participate as much as maybe they used to?

A.38:  No, um, not since, um, {pause} not as much as I remember growing up.  And
that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um,

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  seemed more common in the last two decades.

B.41:  Yeah.  I think that's probably true.

A.42:  #But,#

B.43:  #I# think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller
communities --

A.44:  Yeah.

B.45:  -- then in the larger cities.

A.46:  Yeah.  Where, uh, where abouts do you live?  What part of the country?

B.47:  Well, I live in Richardson right now. #Which is just,# 

A.48:  #Oh, okay.#  We're in Plano #so we're not far apart.#

B.49:  #Right. Yeah, okay.#

A.50:  One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin and, and I
know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so I know there is the
possibility that --

B.51:  Yeah.

A.52:  -- it could be out of the area.

B.53:  Gosh, I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're
right.  Yeah.  I grew up in a real small town in Florida.  

A.54:  Oh.

B.55:  I mean a real small town [laughter].  And, uh, I think it was just (( )),
of course it was back in the, in the fifties and I think it was real prevalent
back then.  I (( )), I think people thought more of others than they do now.

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits
from it.  

A.58:  Well, and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back.
Um, if we've lost some of that and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um,
that's true, maybe that's a way, if, if young people had to do it --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the
things I always [breathing] thought was a wonderful part of our country. 
#Um,# --

B.61:  #Yeah,# I do to.  I do to.

A.62:  -- is helping others {pause} [noise].

B.63:  [Breathing] [laughter].  I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for
it though.  I think you would have to start younger.

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  I, I don't know how young you'd have to go but I think by the time
they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now.  At least
around here.

A.66:  [Noise] Yeah, I think, uh, {pause} I think it does help, um, even
preschoolers, you know they're, um, things even just starting around the home.

B.67:  #Right.#

A.68:  #You# know little ones can do a little bit to help the family.

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a
pattern.  There's always something, [noise] no matter how young, and then that
helps develop that attitude.  Um, I guess I would really like to see this
happen with families more.  You know, I think this is certainly a possible
way, um, to handle it but I wish, (( )) that's something that I think that has
been lost in families and I think that's a good place to start again.

B.71:  Yeah.  I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't
do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for
anybody else.

A.72:  Yeah.  And I do think, um, the schools, if you're trying to do something,
even with food drives and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both, I
mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much --

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  -- they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.  I
mean, that's, uh, gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as
fortunate as these areas #and, uh# --

B.75:  #That's# probably true.  That's probably true.

A.76:  -- it's, I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young but
they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia --

B.77:  #Uh-huh.#

A.78:  -- #area# every year.  They've done this for fourteen years now.

B.79:  Oh, that's great.

A.80:  Um, and it is, it's, uh, and they've also see that there's, there's a
different way of life and those families are really close.  Some of the things,

B.81:  [Noise].

A.82:  that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there --

B.83:  #Uh-huh.#

A.84:  -- #and,# uh, [lipsmack] it really, every youth that's ever gone really has
felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective.
And, and that's just the t-, two weeks during, during the summer. 

B.85:  Uh-huh.

A.86:  So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would --

B.87:  Well, that's, that's #great.#

A.88:  -- #think, uh,#

B.89:  I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved
in that sort of thing.

A.90:  Well that's,

B.91:  Like I said, I think it does, e-, even a small amount of exposure can
make a vast difference --

A.92:  #Yes.#

B.93:  -- #in their# attitudes {pause} [talking].  Well [laughter],

@@A.94:  Well, I guess, um, did you have anything else?

B.95:  No, no I guess that's about all.

A.96:  Okay.

B.97:  Okay.

A.98:  Well, I enjoyed talking with you.

B.99:  Well, good talking with you.

A.100:  And I hope you have a good evening.

B.101:  You too.

A.102:  Thanks.

B.103:  Okay.

A.104:  Bye, bye.

B.105:  Bye [noise].
