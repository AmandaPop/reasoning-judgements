===========================================================================

@A.1:  Well, my favorite type of music is classical music, and, uh, I, I enjoy
orchestral classical music and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano,
you know, and that's, those are, that's my favorite type.

B.2:  Well,

A.3:  Uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.  

B.4:  Oh, well my favorite, well, I, I don't really have a favorite, I, I like
everything basically.  Um,  I guess if I had to pick, it would be like 
pop, I would think, but I like everything.  So, it's kind of hard to choose
sometimes.

A.5:  Yeah, you know.  I guess I enjoy, I enjoy jazz, listening to jazz sometime
although I don't feel like I have a good, g-, good understanding of it, or a
good, a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not, but, but, um, I
enjoy it and, uh, sometimes I enjoy listening to, uh, fiddle music.

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  #We were# in Colorado recently and heard this, these, uh, well, we heard
this fiddler and we bought his, we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to
listen to the --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- fiddle ((pans)). So,

B.10:  I grew up next door to, uh, the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader so,
 
A.11:  Oh, Chris Xeros.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Oh, you lucky thing.

B.14:  So, we used to go and listen to them all the time and, my parents still do.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and, and what not.  Plus my parents
are, well, especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music and he introduced
my brother and I both, to a lot of it. #So,#

A.17:  #Oh,# gosh, Chris Xeros [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  You grew up with his children, too, then?

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Oh, gosh.

B.22:  Sure did.

A.23:  Gosh, small world, huh?

B.24:  Yeah.  We all went to high school together and, uh, and we're still in
contact with each other.

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not so,

A.27:  Oh gosh.  Well actually, I used to play in the Richardson Symphony, I
played violin in the orchestra for several years --

B.28:  Oh really?

A.29:  -- you know, yeah [laughter].  So, 

B.30:  It is a small world isn't it?  

A.31:  Yeah, small world.  So, I, uh, I know Chris [laughter].

B.32:  [Children] Yeah, he's a pretty nice guy.

A.33:  Most of the time [laughter].

B.34:  Yeah, [laughter] well I never I had to work for him and I never would want
to work for him.  So [laughter],

A.35:  No, no.  Well life just took different turns here so, uh, it just [talking]
didn't work out to do that now.  So, he's, he's about ready to retire, another
year and he,

B.36:  Yeah, he sure is, he just became a grandfather.

A.37:  Yeah, I heard that.  It's, it's daughter, it's his daughter that,

B.38:  Uh, uh-huh.  Yeah, they just had the baby's christening so,

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  It was really nice so {very faint},

A.41:  Was it a boy or a girl?

B.42:  He's a little boy [children].

A.43:  Yeah.  What did they name him? 

B.44:  I can't, it, it's a [sigh], oh gosh, it's like [children] Elijah, or
something like that.

A.45:  Oh.

B.46:  I keep forgetting, what, what she named him.

A.47:  Oh.

B.48:  His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for --

A.49:  Of course.

B.50:  -- for her daddy, but [breathing], I think it's Elijah [children].  

A.51:  Oh.

B.52:  It starts with an E.

A.53:  Yeah, yeah.

B.54:  I can't remember [laughter] [children] [noise].

A.55:  Oh, so you've heard the Richardson Symphony?

B.56:  Yes.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  Yeah, we've heard them and, liked, liked it real well, of course
[laughter] [children].

A.59:  [Laughter] Do you have a favorite instrument?

B.60:  Um, [sigh] actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.

A.61:  Yes.

B.62:  I really like those, in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding.

A.63:  Oh, did you?

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  Oh.

B.66:  Which was real nice.  I got married, uh, during the Christmas season and we
[children] played, uh, old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding
marches and what not, and it was real nice, [children] I liked that a lot.

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  I liked the sound of the harpsichord.  

A.69:  And it played by itself?

B.70:  No, somebody played it [children].

A.71:  Well, I mean, but you didn't have oboe or something with it?

B.72:  No, no, no, no, no.  Just by itself, just by itself.  

A.73:  Yeah.  Oh.

B.74:  It was real nice.

A.75:  Well, that's really, yeah that's, I bet that was nice.

B.76:  [Children] Yeah.  It went well, it was a change, you know, from your
traditional, normal, you know, stuff, and since it was Christmas time and,
and, uh, we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias
and, you know, stuff like that and --

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  -- so, we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols,
Not, not, you know, the bouncy, [laughter] you know --

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  -- sing along kind but -- 

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  -- some of the old, older ones that some, I don't even, I recognize the,
the melodies, and whatnot, but I didn't recognize the name.

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  So, it was real nice.

A.85:  Well actually, I play, I play the violin in, in a string quartet that
often plays at weddings.  

B.86:  Um.

A.87:  So, um, I always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or
piano.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  And, it makes, it makes it nice.  It makes, you know, you can say classy
or it makes an elegant wedding to #have# --

B.90:  #It does.#

A.91:  -- something else.

B.92:  It really does and it has such a different sound to it, anyway.  It's
almost, I don't know the way it vibrates, it's kind of haunting, you know, on,
on some of the notes [children].  It, it's, I, I like it.

A.93:  Oh.

B.94:  I don't know how else to explain.  But, we've got friends that are in the
music business that go around Dallas, they're, uh, called Odessa.  It's a
husband and wife team that we've known for years and, uh, we try to [children]
make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff, too, so
we've had a lot of stuff, you know, friends and, and things to do with music
that constant, plus my husband's real big into music, too, so.  He doesn't
play anything, but,

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  he just likes to listen.  And my dad and my kids are now well, my oldest
is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite
songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and,

A.97:  Oh.  Now does, does the school in, in your, in your city, does it, does it
offer, like band, or some of the instruments?

B.98:  Yeah, well, my, my oldest is only nine.

A.99:  Okay.

B.100:  So h-, he hasn't really gotten into, um, that yet.  They have choir that
they go to, you know, music --

A.101:  Right.

B.102:  -- class that they go to but, um, he's not old enough yet to get into the
band yet.

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  So, 

A.105:  Right.

B.106:  I think that starts in sixth grade.

A.107:  Probably.  Oh.

B.108:  So,

A.109:  Gosh.

B.110:  but I don't know.  He, he's, he, the only thing he's shown interest in
wanting to play is the drums cause his, my brother plays, and, um, I don't, I
don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not [children], you know,
it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's
interested --

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  -- in something, you know.

A.113:  Right.  Right, you got a little ways to go, too [laughter]. ((Right)).

B.114:  Yeah, just a little bit [children].

A.115:  Hey, oh.  Well, my, well my oldest is eight and, and she's, we've, started
her on piano so, uh,

B.116:  Uh.

A.117:  But, that's been, it's been fun, I mean it's a lot of work to see that
she's [barking] prepared but it's been fun, it's been fun, I feel like I've
learned a lot about the piano.  I've learned a lot about playing the piano.

B.118:  Really?

A.119:  And, uh, it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when I
hear it at other places, or when I, you know, see some, see and hear someone
playing.  I sort of watch their technique, too, and, and see if it corresponds
up to what she's learning.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  So, it's been fun.

B.122:  [Children] I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or ...
