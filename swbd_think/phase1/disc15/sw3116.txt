===========================================================================

@B.1:  Okay.  Talk about, uh, what kind of restaurants we, we like to go to and
what, uh, makes us go back, and I'll start talking about it.  Uh, it's kind of
like, uh, places that are family style kind of things because it's a, a casual
atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff.  And, and, uh,
but, we were in California recently and I went, we went to a couple of very,
uh, I guess, expensive, extravagant restaurants, because it was kind of the
thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like, and we got to get some
real good food, more exotic, and, uh, we thought that the service was very
good and, uh, that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even
though it is expensive, you know, like maybe once a year or once every six
months go to it or something like that.

A.2:  Uh-huh.  

B.3:  But, how about you?  

A.4:  Yeah, I, I enjoy going out, but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with
his company, you know, with his work --

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  -- so it's something that I end up kind of experimenting with, with my
girlfriends, or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and --

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  -- and so we end up usually finding something that's, uh, quick service
and, uh, that's hopefully economical and, uh, certainly tastes good.  I hate
to, uh, pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre.

B.9:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.  

A.10:  Uh, as far as to really go out for an evening, though, I do like to have a
place that's not real, real formal, but kind of on a formal side just because
usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing
and then, uh, the quality of food is usually kind of, is affected by how the
mood is set so,

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  Uh, I guess my favorite kind of foods would be, uh, the ones that
[lipsmack], well, I don't know, favorite is just going out for a good, good
hearty steak.

B.13:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.14:  But I, I find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak
houses, it doesn't seem, and I, I find that amazing being in Texas.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  I'm from another state originally and I always thought Texas was supposed
to be such a good meat state.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  And it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a
real good juicy steak.

B.19:  Uh-huh.  You know what we have around here, too, is, uh, a place where you,
uh, you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself.

A.20:  Oh, really?  

B.21:  Yeah, and they, they have everything else cooked, you know, but, baked
potatoes and all that, but you, you pick your meat and, you know, whether it's
marinated or, or just regular --

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  -- and, uh, then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself, you know,
and then have all the stuff to put on it, you know, like if you want to --

A.24:  Huh.

B.25:  -- I don't know butter on it, or whatever or garlic and stuff like that --

A.26:  Huh.  

B.27:  -- you can, you can do it.  That's kind of interesting.  It was really
good.

A.28:  Yeah, it's kind of an interesting approach.  

B.29:  Yeah, we thought that was, that wasn't too bad.  But most of the time, you
know, I was really surprised, like I say, going at these fancier restaurants
and, and I thought, I really liked the food, you know.  It, uh, it was
different because, you know, you see all these things like you see all these
chef's, chef's shows and stuff like that --

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  -- and, uh, and, you know, I always watched and thought, well, I wonder if
that's any good, you know, it looks kind of small, but actually it wasn't bad
at all.

A.32:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.33:  You know, when they have like seafood dishes, uh, but, it's just kind of,
kind of sparse with different things put in it that, that really, uh, that
really taste pretty good.  You didn't, you wouldn't think it goes together,
you know.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  But, uh, but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family, family
type of things, you know.

A.36:  Yeah.  

B.37:  Because it's, uh, it's easier to go with two kids, two young kids, now
[laughter].

A.38:  Yeah, that's what we have, too.  

B.39:  Yeah.  

A.40:  And, yeah, you do have to kind of decide, well, are we there to get a good
meal and, and just be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot
of time and a lot of money --

B.41:  Right, right.  

A.42:  -- which doesn't work with kids.  

B.43:  Yeah, that's true.  

A.44:  So, what would make you go back to a good restaurant?  

B.45:  Well, I think, uh, some of the things that I liked were, uh, uh, well, I
would see the food, and whether or not it tastes good.

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  Uh, the service, if they're, you know courteous or if they just kind of are
hasty, you know.

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  If they just get your order and go and you never see them again or they
coming to, you know, talk with you a little bit or something.

A.50:  And do you find that when you have children that it's, it really makes, uh,
you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by
the way they treat you with kids?

B.51:  [Laughter] Yes, I have, we have.  

A.52:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.53:  We have noticed that.  Yes, uh, if they more, you can tell when they're
oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to
write with something, you know.

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  To occupy them, you can really tell.  

A.56:  Yeah.  

B.57:  The other thing I've liked, too, is, uh, now this isn't, you don't have
this at, at family restaurants, but, uh, is some type of a, like a, a pianist
or something --

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  -- that will play some music while your eating and stuff.  

A.60:  Oh, yeah.  

B.61:  And that, that, that was kind of neat.  

A.62:  Yeah, we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's -- 

B.63:  Uh-huh.  

A.64:  -- that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it, it just
makes for a real classy feel, and, uh, it kind of carries over the
conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is
saying next to you, but, I mean --

B.65:  Yeah.  

A.66:  -- you know, at the next table, but just within your own little group, so
it makes for a nice, nice place to go.

B.67:  There was two places that we went to, one in San Francisco and one in, uh,
in Monterey, California.

A.68:  Oh, yeah.  

B.69:  And, uh, the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big
skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you c-, had a great 
view --

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  -- you know, of San Francisco and everything.  

A.72:  Yeah.  

B.73:  And, uh, and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant
is the view.  And the one in, in Monterey was really nice because it was
overlooking the water, too.  So that was, that was a couple things that we
liked.

A.74:  Yeah.  

B.75:  But,  

A.76:  Well, sounds good.  

B.77:  Okay.  You have anything else to say?  

A.78:  No, I think we covered everything.  

B.79:  [Laughter] Okay, well thanks a lot.  

A.80:  Well, thank you for being home [laughter].  

B.81:  [Laughter] Okay.  

A.82:  Okay, bye-bye.  

B.83:  Bye-bye.
