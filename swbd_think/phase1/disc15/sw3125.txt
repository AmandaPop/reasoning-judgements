============================================================================

A.1:  Well, Vic, you said your professional, your favorite professional football
team was, was the Cowboys?

B.2:  That's right.  

A.3:  Well, you know, I, I could, uh, pick the, uh, Chicago team.  

B.4:  Oh, you could.  

A.5:  Yeah.  I got a lot of northern neighbors here.  

B.6:  Okay.  

A.7:  And, uh, they really, uh, pull for the Chicago.  What are the, what are the
Chicago team called?

B.8:  The Bears.  

A.9:  The Bears, yeah --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- right.  Chica-, Chi-, 

B.12:  I'm not sure how they'll do this year.  I don't know who they'll use as
quarterback.

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  I'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet.   

A.15:  Right.  Well, there's a lot of good teams out there in the professional
world and, uh, course we hope also that the Cowboys do good.  I know I do and
it's your favorite team, so why don't you tell me about them.

B.16:  Well, what, uh, I get optimistic about is just, uh, the relative age of the
team now with all the youth that they've added and sort of a change in the
nature of the team to the, to more of the, uh, the, the pure athlete type at
all the positions.  Uh, I like them having added a wide receiver with a nice
track background that can high jump real high.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  What's his name?  

B.18:  Uh, Alvin Harper, I think.  

A.19:  Harper.  

B.20:  Out of Tennessee.  Because he was a, think he's about six foot, three and
apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him.

A.21:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.22:  And, uh, I understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet.

A.23:  I'll be darned.  

B.24:  When he was in high school, so, uh, he creates a real problem for people
now, uh, particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back
there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it.

A.25:  Well, is he a fragile, uh, football player.  You know, they had an end, or
a, a wingback or something like that, that would go down the field and, and,
uh, he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was
getting hurt.

B.26:  Getting hurt.  I don't think this one has any, a record like that.  Seems
to be more of a, a, a sturdy athlete.

A.27:  I see.  

B.28:  I know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few
years.

A.29:  What's the coach's name, Johnson?  

B.30:  Yeah, Jimmy.  

A.31:  Jimmy, you think he can do better this year than he did last year?

B.32:  Well, he did better last year than most people thought.  

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  Including, including myself, but, uh,  

A.35:  What about his players, uh, and their reactions to him and his, uh, kind of
unorthodox professional football type, uh, coaching.

B.36:  Well, I guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college
atmosphere to it than --

A.37:  Yeah, right.  

B.38:  -- than, certainly than his predecessor.  

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  I really don't know how they, they really react to that.  It probably does
him well right now with, with like I said, the youth he has on the team.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  Uh, I think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some
dividends is, is changing the offensive coach that, bring in a new, uh,
offense and new offensive system that I think the, so far, the players are,
are, uh, re-, responding well to.

A.43:  Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach?  

B.44:  Well, that's the theory [laughter].

A.45:  Yeah [laughter].  And what about the quarterback, do you think he is, uh,
going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion?

B.46:  Well, I don't know whether anybody can for a whole,  

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  year anymore.  

A.49:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.50:  But, uh, he is,

A.51:  [Sneezing]. 

B.52:  uh, he's pretty sturdy, but he's got to learn to get,  

A.53:  [Sneezing]. 

B.54:  rid of it pretty quick.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Uh, well is Cowboys your, your favorite team as well or,

A.57:  Well, re-, in reality, uh, they are my favorite team.  Uh, uh, and have
been, you know, back since the glory days or before the glory days.

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  They used to practice, you know, right over here, uh, on, uh, six
thirty-five and Coit --

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  -- right in that area.  

B.62:  Right over there at, uh, near Forrest, I think and,   

A.63:  Yeah, right.  

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  And, uh, it was a dingy little old field, uh, uh, that, uh, you would have
thought maybe a, a high school would have played on.

B.66:  That's the one that,  

A.67:  It's all surrounded, you know, by apartments and businesses and everything.
I was shocked when I saw it.

B.68:  I think that was the place that had the, looked like corrugated tin fence
around it painted blue.

A.69:  Yeah, and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former
coach, you know, uh, stood up in there, in there and,

B.70:  Right.  

A.71:  But, I guess, uh, you know, it doesn't take a lot of, uh, fancy things to
make a good football team.

B.72:  Well, I guess not.  

A.73:  Since they did, uh, they were America's team, you know back then.

B.74:  Yeah, during that time period, they sure were.  

A.75:  And, and I don't think they are now, though.  

B.76:  Do you go to many of,  

A.77:  Looks like somebody else laid claim to that.  

B.78:  Do you go to many of the games or have you before?  

A.79:  Uh, I've been to several games, uh, in my lifetime.  However, I prefer to
watch the, uh, watch the game, uh, via the T V tube.

B.80:  Well, I guess I do, too, really.  

A.81:  Yeah, I, I, I find myself, uh, when I go to the football games of, uh, of,
uh, missing a play by talking to somebody in the group,

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  or a st-, a fan stands up or I'm looking at the cheerleaders or the
clowns --

B.84:  Right.  

A.85:  -- and when something does happen I say, what happened, you know.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  And then, course, uh, you can see it on the, on the playback out there.
Uh, but back there when I was going I don't think it was that good.  Or if
they had it at all, you know.

B.88:  Right, that's right.  I think I went to more of their games when they were
still operating out of, uh, the Cotton Bowl --

A.89:  Yeah.  

B.90:  -- than I have since they moved to Texas Stadium.  

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  Course,  

A.93:  We, we have a lake house, see and we go out of town.  

B.94:  Oh, that works out nicely.  

A.95:  And, yeah, we just go down there and, uh, watch the game.  

B.96:  I'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts
and fewer blackouts --

A.97:  Yes.  

B.98:  -- this year.  

A.99:  Absolutely and, and, uh, if the team, you know, starts off good this year,
I think that, uh, they will be a, a drawing card and perhaps they can, uh,
return to their former glory days.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  You know, I had people, uh, all over the world, you know, that I run into,
uh, say, you know, they think of one thing, the Dallas Cowboys and the movie
DALLAS.

B.102:  That's right.  

A.103:  And so, uh, I think that, uh, they will come back, and Johnson, while he's
unorthodox, I think he is doing a good job and he's all, uh, he's all 
business --

B.104:  Yeah, he is that.

A.105:  -- and he got a lot, he got, he got rid of a lot of the cry babies, uh, the
people that thought that had it, they had it made, because, uh, they were
stars --

B.106:  Right.  

A.107:  -- and he cleaned that out real good and, and I'm sure he lost some good
ones that shouldn't have gone, but, in his type offense he was looking for
youth and for, uh, uh, uh, to rebuild a new team.

B.108:  Uh-huh.  

A.109:  And I think that was the reason why he cut all the players.  And I think
also that oil man that, uh, that, uh, owns, that oilman and his partners that
own the team, uh, is interested in making a dollar and, and they've certainly
gone to, uh, great lengths to, you know, to bring the team back into Texas for
spring training, and --

B.110:  Right.  

A.111:  -- and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the
various factions, you know, uh, especially, back in the beginning I think he's
done a great job.

B.112:  Well, that's my,  

A.113:  What's his name, uh,

B.114:  Oh, the, uh, Jones.  

A.115:  Jones, yeah.  

B.116:  Yeah, Jones is his name.  

A.117:  And, uh, he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and, uh,
and, uh, so, you know, the, they've got the stadium out there and,
