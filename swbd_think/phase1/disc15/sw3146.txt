receiver when she spoke, resulting in frequent noise throughout the
conversation.

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Hi, #Nancy.#

A.3:  #H-,#

@B.4:  Well, do you do a lot of dining out?

A.5:  No, um, we don't although we enjoy it.  Um, we do it more when we have
company #come.#

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  Um, what about you?

B.8:  Well, we do s-, some dining out.  Um, I, I do a lot of cooking so, um,
mostly like when we go out, you know, it's my husband and I, I, we don't go
out too often as a family, [noise] um, unless it's [static] like a fast-food
kind of thing.  But, um, but we do enjoy dining out.  One of our favorite
places here in, in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe.  I don't know if you,
have you ever been there?

A.9:  I've heard of that but I haven't been there.  Um, where,

B.10:  [Throat_clearing].

A.11:  about is that?

B.12:  Um, [talking] well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe
Pacific, #and, uh,#

A.13:  #Oh, okay.#  I, I've been to Cafe Pacific.

B.14:  Have you?  Th-, now that's down in, uh, Highland Park.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  It's Highland Park Village.  Did you like it?

A.17:  Yes.  Uh [breathing],

B.18:  Oh, I love it [laughter].

A.19:  Before we moved to,

B.20:  [Throat_clearing].

A.21:  the area, my brother, uh, lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came
up one time when my father was visiting and --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- we all ate there and, oh, their seafood was wonderful.

B.24:  Oh, it is, it's fabulous.  #It really is a great place.#

A.25:  #Now where is# the Atlantic Cafe?

B.26:  Atlantic Cafe is down on, I believe it's on McKinney.  

A.27:  Oh, okay.

B.28:  Um, and o-, originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and
th-, the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
And then they, they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific.  And, I loved
them both.  I really do.  I think they're wonderful.  That's our favorite.
You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is
Houston's.  Have you been there?

A.29:  No, um, but I've heard that's really good, too, and,

B.30:  It's wonderful.  The only thing is [static] you have to wait. You have, you
have to expect to wait at least an hour.

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an
hour waiting to get in.  And, a-, as long as you know that [static], it's
okay.  But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib --

A.33:  Oh.

B.34:  -- um, anywhere [laughter] --

A.35:  Oh, okay.

B.36:  -- in the area.  I love it.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And, my husband really likes their ribs.  So it's hysterical.  We go in and
we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't
even look at the menu #[laughter]#.

A.39:  #[Laughter]#  You know right away #what you want [laughter].#

B.40:  #I know# right away what we, what we want.  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.41:  Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too, and, uh, actually the, the Steak And
Ale out here,

B.42:  [Throat_clearing].

A.43:  uh, we've gone to, uh, my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when #they've# --

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#

A.45:  -- had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday #night# --

B.46:  #Uh-huh.#

A.47:  -- and, uh, the time we went the prime rib was really good.

B.48:  Was it?  Really?  I've nev-, I've, I've been there for like, you know,
lunch --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- but, I've never been there for dinner.  And, it was good, yeah.

A.51:  Yeah, yeah {very faintly}.

B.52:  Oh, that's great.  That's,

A.53:  [Breathing] [laughter].

B.54:  great.  Another nice place for, for prime rib is Baby Doe's --

A.55:  #Oh, I've heard about that, too# --

B.56:  -- #Maxwell's nice,# have you been there?

A.57:  -- but no. [laughter] We've, uh, I guess we eat out even less than I
realize  #[laughter].#

B.58:  #[Laughter]#  And I didn't think we ate out very often [laughter].
See!  Baby Doe's is nice.

A.59:  Oh {very faintly}.

B.60:  And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, uh, is
Lawry's.  I've heard that's real good,

A.61:  #Yeah.#

B.62:  #Lawry's# Prime Rib?

A.63:  Yes, I'd, I had heard that, too.  Um,

B.64:  I've, I've never been there but I've heard it's real good.

A.65:  Have you been to the little, uh, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France,
um, right #here# --

B.66:  #[Breathing] [laughter] Yes.#

A.67:  -- on Central Expressway?

B.68:  Yes, actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to.  

A.69:  Oh, okay.

B.70:  Uh, they have real nice lunches.  Have you, have you been there for lunch?
Or,

A.71:  Yes, uh --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- primarily lunch, well, and breakfast sometimes but, uh, during the week
they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, uh, very reasonable complete
dinners for six ninety-nine that #included# --

B.74:  #Really?#

A.75:  -- the soup an-, or salad --

B.76:  Really?

A.77:  -- entrees and accompaniments and dessert and, uh, the, my husband and I
like veal, #uh# --

B.78:  #Uh-huh.#

A.79:  -- a lot and their veal dishes have been good.  We've tried different ones
when they've had them as one of the --

B.80:  The specials.

A.81:  -- Uh-huh.

B.82:  Have you ever been to Biffin's? 

A.83:  #Huh-,# 

B.84:  #I# keep hearing about it.  I keep hearing the advertisements of it --

A.85:  #I, yes, no,#

B.86:  -- #and, and they# keep saying, you know, oh, it's wonderful, it's
wonderful.  I have not been over there and I was thinking, you know, it's
supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl.

A.87:  Right.  And,

B.88:  And, uh, I've, I've not been there.

A.89:  I haven't either, uh, one place, and I've only been there for lunch, but,
uh, I went with a friend, and we met her husband, um, down on Greenville, down
near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's, 

B.90:  [Sigh] I've been there. 

A.91:  Oh, I, we just we-,

B.92:  That was nice [breathing] [laughter].

A.93:  It was and we had the,

B.94:  [Throat_clearing].

A.95:  uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best
mushroom soup and they did.  It was wonderful but, uh, and we just had soup
and salad so we could make room for the dessert #[laughter],# 

B.96:  #[Laughter].#

A.97:  which was a chocolate sack.  I don't know if you tried but -- 

B.98:  #Oh# --

A.99:  -- #or s-,#

B.100:  -- I've heard of it.  Where, where it's made, it's like, it's like a, it's
all chocolate, like made like a paper bag --

A.101:  #Yes!#

B.102:  -- #and# it's filled with what, whip cream -- 

A.103:  #It, yes# --

B.104:  --  #and, and strawberries and something?#

A.105:  -- it had a sponge cake --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- and whip cream and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries --

B.108:  Oh.

A.109:  -- in a raspberry, uh, puree and,

B.110:  [Breathing] [laughter] Oh.

A.111:  and [breathing] we shared one, the three of us and it was plenty because it
was very rich but, uh --

B.112:  Oh.

A.113:  -- I wished I'd had a camera.  It was beautiful [laughter].

B.114:  Oh, I bet it was.  I bet it was.

A.115:  Uh {very faintly}.

B.116:  The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day, and --

A.117:  Oh.

B.118:  -- we took another friend with us and, uh, [throat_clearing] for dessert
we thought we had just stuffed ourselves [laughter].  And so we had, they had,
uh, like a berry assortment.  It was, it was raspberries --

A.119:  Oh.

B.120:  -- and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on
the bottom.  And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of
like in a, in a decoration on the, you know, how they do the plates real
fancy with the decorations and then --

A.121:  Yes.  Yeah {very faintly}.

B.122:  -- piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it [noise] --

A.123:  Oh.

B.124:  -- and it was #outstanding.#

A.125:  #It sounds# wonderful.

B.126:  It was really, really relatively simple but, oh, it was good.  It was
really good.

A.127:  Well, that's, uh, one of the things th-, that I do enjoy when you get a
good restaurant.  Uh, I love fresh berries.  And, their, their fruits are
always exceptional.  I don't, I'm, know they must have a special source for
getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,

B.128:  You can't #find them.#

A.129:  #you can't# find them --

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  -- like that and,

B.132:  [Talking] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [breathing] [laughter] You know, i-, I'm
originally from Connecticut and, uh, I was home a few years ago and my sister
and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and, uh, I was really
amazed, you know, the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.  You
know, they were real, real pretty but they lacked, [clicking] the service and
they lacked the at-, the, just the, I don't know.  The restaurants down here
seem like they have, uh, I guess there's so much competition that they,
[clicking] really have to be good.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  And, I thought [clicking] I would really miss that.

A.135:  [Breathing] [laughter]  I would, too, because,

B.136:  [Throat_clearing].

A.137:  well, because we don't go out very often.  When we do go out, um, in a way
it's like a little mini vacation I guess, and, uh, it is, it's a whole
experience.  Of course you want the food to be good but the atmosphere and
service I think, are important, uh --

B.138:  Uh-huh.
 
A.139:  -- too.

B.140:  [Lipsmack] And, you know, in order to survive in this area [clicking], I
think they have to be good.

A.141:  #Yeah.#

B.142:  #Because# the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.

A.143:  [Breathing] [laughter] Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a
little off the beaten track but it is wonderful.  It's called Cafe Max and
it's at Plano Road and Campbell.  They have the most wonderful salads.  They
do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed #two or three.#

B.144:  #Oh, really?#
