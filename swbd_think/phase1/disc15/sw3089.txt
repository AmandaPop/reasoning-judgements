A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Hi.

A.3:  Um, Sunday I went to see ROBIN HOOD, along with fifty million other people
[laughter].

B.4:  Bet you stood in a long line, didn't you.

A.5:  No, we got really lucky.  The first theater that we went to was sold out,
so we ran down the road to another one,

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  and it wasn't too bad.  It was pretty crowded once we got in there.

B.8:  Well, you've seen the more recent one than I have then.  I have, we don't
usually go out to movies.  We usually wait until we can watch them at home.

A.9:  Yeah, that's really a lot of fun, too.

B.10:  Right.  Uh, we have been trying to get out to go, but it just seems like
with working and, and,

A.11:  Yeah, and it's so expensive --

B.12:  It is getting --

A.13:  -- unless you go,

B.14:  -- that way isn't it.

A.15:  Yeah, I mean,

B.16:  Well, did you like ROBIN HOOD?  

A.17:  Yeah, I did.  Um, I hadn't seen any of the earlier ones, so I really didn't
know what to expect, but they had injected a lot of humor into it --

B.18:  Yes.

A.19:  -- which I really liked.

B.20:  The previews look like that --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- that's the way it was.

A.23:  And so, and there was a lot of action, lot of swashbuckling type of thing
[laughter],

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  but, um, I really liked the humor.  Of course I love Kevin Costner,

B.26:  Oh, yeah --

A.27:  so that helped,

B.28:  -- well that's --

A.29:  -- it doesn't hurt to sit and --

B.30:  -- needless to say, [laughter] really,

A.31:  -- watch him for two hours [laughter].

B.32:  Did you see DANCES WITH WOLV-, DANCES?

A.33:  No, I never went to see that one.

B.34:  I haven't either, we want too, uh, because everyone tells us that we'd
better go see it on a wide screen.  So,

A.35:  Yeah, that's definitely what I want to do.  But I think by then it might
even be at the dollar movies.

B.36:  Well, uh, maybe so, I'll have to check that out [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah,

B.38:  But, uh, I think that some of the most recent ones we've gotten and rented
have been GHOST --

A.39:  Oh, really, did you like that?

B.40:  Yes.  Did you?

A.41:  Yes.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Very much.

B.44:  In fact, uh, you know, it's one of those things that I want to see more
than once [laughter].

A.45:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.

B.46:  Yes, and, uh, oh, we got MEMPHIS BELLE, and all the things that are out at
the current time,

A.47:  Now is that the one, is that the one with, uh, who's in MEMPHIS BELLE?

B.48:  That's about the airplane --

A.49:  The airplane, yeah.

B.50:  -- the old airplane.

A.51:  Was that good?

B.52:  Yes --

A.53:  Huh.

B.54:  -- it's good.

A.55:  I didn't realize that was already on video.  

B.56:  It is, it's been out, about the same time GHOST came out.

A.57:  Oh.

B.58:  Yeah, so we, we, uh, we'll, I watch and grab the first one that comes out.

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  And of course we have some grandchildren, so we're taping or, or watching
as many of the cartoon types --

A.61:  Oh, yeah.

B.62:  -- as we can get, and get them and, uh,

A.63:  Uh, my cable had a Disney preview on this weekend, and so I taped a bunch
of shows --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- off of that [laughter].

B.66:  Right, yes.  Well, we've gotten, our children are still small.  So, uh, we
just, they like the little Peter Pans and all that sort of thing.

A.67:  Oh, yeah, I have a niece that is just in love with THE LITTLEST MERMAID --

B.68:  Yes.

A.69:  -- she just thinks that's the best show in the world.

B.70:  Well, they have a, a movie out now, and I saw it at Blockbuster's and it's
called BABY TALK, BABY SONGS --

A.71:  Huh.

B.72:  -- and our little two year old granddaughter just loves it, and it's real
[lipsmack] down to her level.  It's songs about getting up and getting 
dressed --

A.73:  Oh, really.

B.74:  -- and getting dressed on your own, by yourself, and --

A.75:  That'd be neat.

B.76:  -- it tells you that you're a miracle and there's nobody like you, and
[laughter] --

A.77:  Huh.

B.78:  -- it's very, uh --

A.79:  I'll have to go get that.  My little two year old niece is coming to see me
for her vacation, so I guess I'll

B.80:  You would

A.81:  go see if I can get that.

B.82:  she would really love it, and we're even thinking about, uh, buying a
copy of it of the tape to put in our church library --

A.83:  Oh, yeah.

B.84:  -- because I think it's a, it's a real excellent movie to sort of build
kids', little kids' egos up --

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  -- and tell them that they can, they're individuals and they can do what
they want to on their own, and --

A.87:  Well, that would be neat.

B.88:  -- real, real nice little movie.

A.89:  Yeah, I was a, when I was growing up I was the victim of that, of the
CINDERELLA movie, because they say that now girls my age have the CINDERELLA
syndrome where they think that their prince is going to come and solve all
their problems [laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter]  That doesn't happen [laughter].

A.91:  [Laughter]  No [laughter].

B.92:  Yeah, so.  Well, I think that, uh, that it sounds like that our lives run
along the same path --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- as far as movies go.  We kind of like the same thing. 

A.95:  Yeah, I really enjoy comedies, and,

B.96:  I do too, and, and love stories,

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  I'm not for, much into SILENCE OF THE LAMB or anything like that.

A.99:  No, I wouldn't go see that if I had to, I don't think.  I'd have nightmares
[laughter].

B.100:  I would too, I just, I'm not interested at all [laughter].

A.101:  No.  There've been a few, they're not really spy movies, I guess they're
suspenseful movies --

B.102:  Well, now, that's, that's not bad.

A.103:  -- yeah, that don't have a lot of the blood and gore, because I just can't
deal with that.

B.104:  No --

A.105:  But --

B.106:  -- who wants to.

A.107:  -- I do kind of like the suspense.

B.108:  Yes, exactly.

A.109:  I mean, you know, I, I love old, old Hitchcock, Hitchcock classics --

B.110:  Uh-huh, yeah, I like those too.

A.111:  -- things like that, but some of the rest, yeah, I wouldn't go see SILENCE
OF THE LAMBS if I had to [laughter].

B.112:  No, no, that'd be the last one on our list [laughter].

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  Oh, shoot.

A.115:  But, um, (( )) is supposed to be very good.

B.116:  Yes, oh I want to see that one too.

A.117:  Yeah, my sister-in-law said she just really enjoyed that, that had been one
of the better ones she had seen all summer.

B.118:  Oh, good.

A.119:  So I guess I'll have to eventually get to that one.

B.120:  Yeah, exactly [laughter].

A.121:  Huh.

B.122:  [Noise]  Uh.

A.123:  Well, do you tape movies off the T V?

B.124:  Yes --

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  -- yes.  In fact, a lot of times I'll scan through the program to see if I
can find something that we'd like to tape to watch during ou-, during the
week.

A.127:  Yeah [laughter].

B.128:  I don't find many,

A.129:  well, especially right now because there're all reruns --

B.130:  Yeah, exactly.

A.131:  -- just on regular T V.

B.132:  And, I don't find too many [laughter].

A.133:  Yeah, it's kind of difficult.  Well, like I said, this weekend Disney had
SINGING IN THE RAIN on --

B.134:  Yes.

A.135:  -- and so I taped it [laughter].

B.136:  [/Noise] And we've, we've got that on tape too, from once before Channel
Thirteen, uh, put that on because, oh, somehow or other they had interrupted
it.

A.137:  Oh, really.

B.138:  So they put it on straight through without any commercials in it.

A.139:  Oh, wow.

B.140:  And so we got it that night.  And --

A.141:  Yeah.

B.142:  -- I've got all the old musicals, like OKLAHOMA --

A.143:  Oh, yeah --

B.144:  -- and um, HELLO DOLLY,

A.145:  -- that's like watching that Disney preview, they're going to have SOUTH
PACIFIC on --

B.146:  Oh, my gosh,

A.147:  -- and, I mean, just all these great old classic musicals.

B.148:  Oh, wonderful.

A.149:  And I thought, boy I think I'm going to have to trade in my H B O and get
Disney.

B.150:  You know, I was just thinking about, maybe we ought to have Disney.

A.151:  Oh, I would love to have it.

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  But, you know, it's kind of hard to justify when you don't have children.

B.154:  That's true, but, you know, looking through the program as I do, I see a
lot of things on there that are not just for children.

A.155:  Oh, yeah.

B.156:  Yeah, so.

A.157:  Well, especially with all those old musicals, because I just love them.

B.158:  I do too.  I love all the old musicals, and all the, like you said, the old
Alfred Hitchcock, and --

A.159:  Yeah.

B.160:  -- uh, just old movies [laughter].

A.161:  Yeah, I taped, uh, FUNNY GIRL was on a couple of weeks ago --

B.162:  Oh, really.

A.163:  -- so I taped that one.

B.164:  Yeah.

A.165:  Yeah, there's a lot --

B.166:  Uh-huh, I guess I missed that [laughter].

A.167:  -- of fun ones.  That was like on Channel Twenty-one, so it --

B.168:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.169:  -- it had the commercials in between it --

B.170:  Well, that's okay.

A.171:  -- but you can fast forward through those [laughter].

B.172:  Yes, exactly [laughter].  Oh, well, you sound like that you like, are like
us, you don't go out too much to the movies.

A.173:  No, we really don't, I mean, we, we both work, and so we're exhausted --

B.174:  We do too.

A.175:  -- when we get home, and then the weekends there's always so much to do to
catch up from what you didn't do all week.

B.176:  Isn't that the truth [laughter].  That's exactly the truth.

A.177:  So, really, I think Sunday going to see ROBIN HOOD was the first time I had
gone with my husband to the show in a year probably.

B.178:  Well, I have, uh, one son still at home, and they went to see that the
other day, too.

A.179:  Yeah.

B.180:  Liked it real well.

A.181:  Yeah.

B.182:  And, uh, he goes to movies, but, and he'll come home and he'll say well,
you'll like this, and you'll like that, so --

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  -- Or, he and I pretty well like the same thing, so [laughter].

A.185:  It really has gotten outrageous, though, at the prices --

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  -- because, I mean, if you are a young kid trying to go on a date, it'd
cost you a fortune.

B.188:  Well, they pretty well have to go Dutch.

A.189:  Yeah [laughter].

B.190:  [Laughter] They really do.

A.191:  Or go to the Saturday afternoon cheap show [laughter].

B.192:  Yeah, exactly [laughter].  Oh, shoot.  Well.

A.193:  Well.

B.194:  I say it was nice talking to you.

A.195:  You too.
