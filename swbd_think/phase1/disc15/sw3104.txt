REMARKS:        There was noise all the way through on B.  A did not
speak loud enough, making it difficult to catch all her words.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, let's see.

B.2:  How many, you said yours are all, I mean, that sounds like an army.

A.3:  [Laughter] Five.

B.4:  Oh, lord.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  That is an army, I came from a family of six,

A.7:  [/Laughter].

B.8:  and I have only got two, and they are, one ...

A.9:  Well (( )) any number is nice, let me tell you.

B.10:  Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not
parenting, that's a hobby.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  But,

A.13:  It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.

B.14:  Well, do not tell that to all my friends. 

A.15:  [Laughter].  

B.16:  They are into quality time.

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  I am into getting through the day.

A.19:  Yeah, but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too.

B.20:  [Noise] {it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes}.  Well I, I, I can
spot a kid who really, you know, whose parents spend every,

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  quality time with them, you know, outside of the work day. 

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And when I take care of some people's kids, 

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  you know, when they, when they have teachers' holidays,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids,

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  that are usually in day care,

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  and you can spot them,

A.33:  You can tell.

B.34:  because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.

A.35:  How to just entertain themselves.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Yeah, yeah.

B.38:  Really.

A.39:  It's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being, uh,
busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.

B.40:  It's not a problem for my two, they are only eighteen months apart [sigh].

A.41:  uh, keeps you busy.

B.42:  They can find things to do and mess around,

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  and plot and scheme and everything else. 

A.45:  [Laughter] Well, that's great.

B.46:  You, did all five of yours complete college?

A.47:  No, our last daughter, she did not want to go to school.  She's, uh, but
she's married now, they built a home just a couple miles from us.  And,

B.48:  Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then?  [Sigh].

A.49:  Well, we did not do it right all the time [laughter].  With our first boy,
we persuaded him to start here, and I do not always think you should try to
make them stay closer to home.  I think the main thing is to, uh, right now, I
think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in.  Uh, and take
what they are interested in, and then, then start looking for schools.

B.50:  Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen
is going to be what they are ultimately --

A.51:  No, not necessarily.

B.52:  -- ultimately graduating at.

A.53:  But, Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have.  He wanted to go to
((Embrey Rey-, Riddle)) and we talked him into going local here first.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh.  He went
to aeronautical, uh, oh, just learning to work on engines and that.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole
life is [laughter].  And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted
to go originally.

B.58:  [Sigh].

A.59:  And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing.  Uh, but, but
right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut
and they build and rebuild non jet engines.

B.60:  How about the other four, other three who went?

A.61:  Uh, the other ones, uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she
wanted to, uh, we did not want her to go, but she went to Erie, to Gannan
University.  Uh, or Gannan College, I am not sure which it is, college, I
guess.  Uh, she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon
realized, you know, even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and
finished at Clarion.  Because, it, uh, saved her quite a bit of money and she
got really the same basic education that she wanted.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also.  And, uh, did very well
there.  And they have all really got, uh, they have all really got really good
jobs.  And, uh,

B.64:  [Inhaling] When they were, like in junior high and high school,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going
to go to college and,

A.67:  Uh, yeah, they kind of had that, they just expected to go.  Daphne never
went, she always said she would never go to college.  She said, I, I always
thought she would change her mind,

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  you know, but she did not.  And there's nothing wrong with that, you
know, if, college is not for everybody.

B.70:  Uh.

A.71:  But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your pa-, wage income.  I think
it's what they want out of life, because if they get an education and are
willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better
income.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he
retired from the state.

B.74:  [Laughter]. 

A.75:  You know, #that boggles,#

B.76:  #Yeah, I was,#

A.77:  my mind.

B.78:  I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making,

A.79:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.80:  as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired.

A.81:  Okay, did you go to college?

B.82:  Yeah,

A.83:  You did.  See [noise] it makes a difference.

B.84:  I went, uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln,

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  [Sigh] because Lincoln is where, where my parents live.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  And there really, there really was not a choice, 

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  I mean the finances, uh, dictated that you had to go there.

A.91:  Uh.  Uh-huh.

B.92:  I kind of, I am not going to say I resent it,

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  but I was, well you know, 

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, 

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, 

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  and [inhaling] the whole bit, uh, [noise] my parents did not even discuss
with me going to college out of state,

A.101:  Some place else.

B.102:  or anyplace else, and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not
support it.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  [Inhaling] If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how
much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, uh, scholarship,

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone
[inhaling].  Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the
Harvard University in Boston.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  And that was, uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that
had ever happened, I mean I was,

A.109:  That's great.

B.110:  taken out of my element, you know, the homogeny midwest,

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  which is a lovely place to grow up,

A.113:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.114:  and put into someplace else where,

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  people thought differently,

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  looked differently, sounded differently, you know,

A.119:  Different life styles, yes, yes.

B.120:  different life style.  And I think it was probably one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  Now my kids, I keep saying that, uh, you know, I would like them to go to
the best school that they possibly could.

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look
like, you know, we are putting money away already.

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  Uh, but I really think it's important [inhaling] to put these children
someplace where, in addition to, [inhaling] you know, them getting an
education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they
are raised in.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Especially if you lived a pretty insular community and,

A.129:  Right.

B.130:  An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, 

A.131:  It's quite a bit different.

B.132:  It's very different.

A.133:  See that's the way we are, we are more of a rural type of an area and it
does make a difference.  I, they say, you should not look at the expense of
the college when you are looking.

B.134:  You should not.

A.135:  Yeah, not really.  Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help,

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  with a more expensive college.

B.138:  Oh, yeah.

A.139:  And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are
better off.  Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school.

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  Uh, we, we did all we could, but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of
their money to go.
