=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, having, uh, personally, uh, helped, uh, two children attend,
or, or to select colleges, one of them not very successfully [laughter], I'm
not sure if I'm any authority on this topic at all.

@B.2:  Well, which colleges did they go to?

A.3:  Well, a daughter, uh, went to the University of Virginia, that was a good
selection.  She,

B.4:  That's a beautiful school.  

A.5:  Yeah, really is.  

B.6:  Beautiful school.  

A.7:  And she was, she was very, [ringing] very happy there and v-, and very
successful in what she picked to do, so, uh, she's just graduated from there,
so that was a good selection.  Uh, our son has this kind of, you know, he's,
well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned, turned into, you
know, flunking out because of, of, of, uh, too many parties going on, then he
stayed out of school for a while, then he went to Richland for a couple of
years and then he went to, to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great,
but, uh, it was so expensive.  So now he's --

B.8:  Well -- 

A.9:  -- now he's back,  

B.10:  -- I guess the question then becomes, how did you all make the selection or
did you just let them do them by themselves?

A.11:  Well, in, in that case, with him, uh, he kind of made the selections by
himself and I think that we should have given him more direction.  And, he was
our first, [/ringing] you know, so we, we didn't have quite the insight that,
uh, that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen, so.
Uh, but, I, I think, you know, i-, just in terms of, of what happened, I think
that first of all I'd, I would know the reputation of the school and, uh, for
more than just academics [barking], but, you know, if it's a party school or
not.  Although, I think every school [noise] is a party school to some degree
personally [laughter].

B.12:  Well, that's true.  Of course, uh, you know, for me, my son, he's only 
six --

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  -- and, but I had the experience with my sister going to school and she
was, I treated my sister almost like my daughter --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- because she was nine, ten years younger than I was.  

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  And she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  I can say that because it was a big well known school, it had a well known
education and it was a wonderful education --

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  -- but, yet it was a small school.  

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  Whereas I went to the University of Texas -- 

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  -- which was, you know, a million people go there -- 

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- I think that for me it's going to be one of those things, yes, I want to
make sure it has a good education, but I also want to keep it small enough
that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big.

A.29:  Yeah, I've heard that from people who have gone to Texas.  

B.30:  It's way too big.  

A.31:  Yeah.  I went to, uh, Iowa State, which is also a big eight school --

B.32:  Yes.  

A.33:  -- like Oklahoma.  

B.34:  Yes, I'm, I'm quite aware.  

A.35:  Yeah.  And, uh, when I was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand
people which was just a great size, I thought.  It's, it's,

B.36:  Texas only had fifty-five thousand when I was there.  

A.37:  Oh, gosh [laughter].  That's just awful.

B.38:  And for me, I had to admit, the one thing that I lacked was the, uh,
interaction between, uh, students.  I knew everybody within my dorm --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- but that was it!  

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  Because the school was just too big -- 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- and whereas my sister, when I went to visit her, she knew everybody on
the whole durn campus.

A.45:  Yes.  That, that's true.  It makes a lot of difference and, uh, 

B.46:  So, uh, course, now we're, we're already telling our son, you know, Tex-,
uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Now, of course, Texas is good only because, you know -- 

A.49:  You went to school there, yeah.  

B.50:  -- I w-, because I went there, of course.  

A.51:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.52:  But, uh, we're going, my parents let me choose on my own -- 

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- and I want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own, but I kind of
keep an ear open as to what he's doing.

A.55:  Sure, oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, our daughter chose, uh, Virginia because she
didn't want to go to school in Texas.  I mean she just sort of didn't want to
go to school here.

B.56:  Well, I was, when I was in Louisiana in Shreveport -- 

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- I would go to any school except L S U.  

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  I did not want to school -- 

A.61:  Same deal.  

B.62:  -- in the, in the same state.  

A.63:  Yeah.  And, uh, in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas, uh, Rice
and Trinity, but she decided she wanted to go out of state and, uh, Virginia
was, uh, you know, in the east.  It wasn't a, you know, it wasn't an Ivy
League school, but it was, well, it's quite a bit further and it was, uh, of
the state schools that she could have gone to it was one of the cheapest, yet
one of the best, t-, you know, with the academics and the tradition and
everything that is there.  Uh, she made a really good selection, we thought
and, so, uh, she pretty much made that her-, herself, but she did have some
others in the wings.  You know, there's another school that she, she would
have, have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there.  So, uh, [lipsmack] I
don't know, I think it really depends a lot on the child, because our daughter
is, was just a lot more levelheaded about her proc-, the process.

B.64:  Luckily I still have twelve more years to worry about it.  

A.65:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  So, uh, but, you know, I guess you have to really look at your finances
and, uh, Texas has such a bargain in education, I mean,

B.68:  Right now they do.  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  Now if the, uh, legislature has their way, they're going to raise the
tuition --

A.71:  I know.  

B.72:  -- in, in double.  

A.73:  I know.  

B.74:  And see, back when I went to school there, when I first entered the school,
it cost me two hundred dollars --

A.75:  Uh, that's something.  

B.76:  -- as an out, as an out of state student.  

A.77:  Uh.  

B.78:  But then I was there for about two and a half years, they then switched it
to forty dollars per semester hour --

A.79:  Oh, wow.  

B.80:  -- so almost overnight I went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred
dollars.

A.81:  My gosh.  

B.82:  And I have to admit, uh, [throat_clearing] -- 

A.83:  That was a shocker.  

B.84:  -- I wasn't, I wasn't quite ready for that one.  

A.85:  No, I'll bet not.  

B.86:  It took me only about twelve years after I graduated to finish paying off
the bill, but (( )).

A.87:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know how that is.  

B.88:  But, at least I was one of the good guys.  I did pay my bill off in full.

A.89:  You did pay yours?

B.90:  Yes, I did.

A.91:  Good.  Yeah.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  My husband went to school on loans, too and, and we, he was able, you know,
we paid his off after we were married, but, uh, well I'm at the university of
Texas at Dallas and, as a graduate student, and, uh, you know, I have to say
that, uh, it's a real bargain.  I mean for, as far --

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  -- as I'm concerned it's been a real bargain.  Of course, you know, living
at home makes a lot of difference.  If I had to, to pay room and board
somewhere, that would make a lot of difference, uh, in,

B.96:  Well, what about the University of Virginia.  How much did it en-, end up
costing?

A.97:  Uh [breathing], I think, uh, on a yearly basis, I'm trying to think.  I
would just make it a rough figure of about, uh, with, with the travel expenses
and so on, although she didn't come home that much, uh, actually.

B.98:  That's a long way.  

A.99:  I would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year.  

B.100:  Uh, that's not too bad.  

A.101:  It's not when you look at the, you know, the school and the fact that she
was,

B.102:  Now, did she get to, did she get to live in the dorm on that very front
row, you know --

A.103:  Uh, no.  

B.104:  -- that goes up by the rotunda [laughter]?  

A.105:  On the lawn, no.  No, that's, that's an honor that's bestowed on very few
and she didn't get to do that, although she knew people who did live there,
but, yeah, that's, that would have been neat.

B.106:  When we went to visit it, we didn't know what it was and my little kid, he
was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside, 

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  to see what he could find [laughter].  

A.109:  Well, you know, the graduation takes place right there on the lawn, on, on
that --

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  -- in that big fat grassy area.  And, uh, they had four thousand graduates
this spring and boy that was quite an event, I'll tell you [laughter].

B.112:  Yeah, we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year -- 

A.113:  Oh, yeah.  

B.114:  -- and we went to visit.  That was the very last thing we saw was at the
tail end of the Parkway.

A.115:  Yeah.  

B.116:  We had, we had a blast.  

A.117:  That's a great place to visit.  

B.118:  It is.  

A.119:  That really is, yeah.  

B.120:  It, I can see why you want to go there.  

A.121:  Yeah.  

B.122:  That's,  

A.123:  Well, they're just so, it's just steeped in tradition and, and the, uh, you
know, they're, they still talk about Mister Jefferson, the, you know, I mean,
the founder of the school, of course was Mister  Jeffer-, Thomas Jefferson and
they --

B.124:  Uh-huh.  

A.125:  -- and, and a lot of,

B.126:  And, of course, you've got to go to say hello to Monticello, yeah, yeah.

A.127:  Right, uh-huh.  And, and a lot of the, of his traditions, I mean, for
instance, they don't call the students freshmen, sophomore, junior, senior,
they call them first year, second year, third year and fourth year because Mr.
Jefferson felt that one's education never ended and to you put those four
designations of freshmen, sophomore and so on, on the person's education
limited them.  And [barking] he felt that you could go on to school forever.
You should just have the number of years that you were there attached to your
name if you want to do --

B.128:  Huh.  

A.129:  -- identify someone, so.  I had to be very careful about talking about
seniors or fourth year students [laughter].

B.130:  [Laughter]. 

A.131:  You got to get the terminology right [laughter].  

B.132:  Well, I tell you what, I've enjoyed talking.  

A.133:  Yes.

@@B.134:  I'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end -- 

A.135:  All righty.  

B.136:  -- because it's just about time for supper -- 

A.137:  Yes, it certainly is.  

B.138:  -- so,

A.139:  I got to go make it here [laughter].  

B.140:  Actually it, it was a fun conversation.  I enjoyed it.  

A.141:  Well, I, I this is my last one.  You're number ten of ten that I can, I, 

B.142:  Congrat-, well, con,
