===========================================================================

A.1:  Yeah.  Yes, I talked with, um, I talked with people from Richardson and
Plano and, uh, the first three days, and then yesterday I talked with someone
with, from Pennsylvania, so,

B.2:  # Yeah, because, #

A.3:  # it's the, #

B.4:  I've only made, this is only my third call. 

A.5:  Oh. 

B.6:  I, I tried to make calls two different days and I couldn't get through. 

A.7:  Oh, I know.  Sometimes I just I'm, in, it just takes a very long time so,

B.8:  Does it?  Yeah, I've been trying to, you know, do that, and, and sometimes
I just can't wait that long,

A.9:  # Yeah, I know.  #

B.10:  # so I just # hang up. 

A.11:  Well. 

B.12:  Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again. 

A.13:  This is hilarious [laughter]. 

B.14:  But I knew as soon as I heard your voice, I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy
((Kester)) [laughter]. 

A.15:  [/Laughter] Oh.  Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?
[Laughter].

@B.16:  Well, let's see, I, um, [lipsmack] gosh, I can't even think.  I haven't
read any, and you're such a reader, I know that and I,

A.17:  Well, I don't read all that much for enjoyment.  I mean, I read a lot for
school, but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading [laughter].

B.18:  Yeah.  The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # and # it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think. 

A.21:  Um. 

B.22:  Um, or something like that. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  And it was, it was kind of, I really didn't like it at all. 

A.25:  Huh. 

B.26:  It was, it was written back in the early eighties. 

A.27:  Oh, yeah. 

B.28:  And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome --

A.29:  Oh, yeah. 

B.30:  -- of the, um, it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing. 

A.31:  Interesting. 

B.32:  It was really an interesting, because I, I right away looked at when it was
copyrighted. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written. 

A.35:  Yes, yes, yeah. 

B.36:  And it was all about women searching for themselves. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  And, um, [lipsmack]  you know, a lot of [laughter]  hanky-panky,

A.39:  # Yeah.  #

B.40:  # going # on. 

A.41:  Yeah.  That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for wh-, when a
lot of books like that were coming out, I think.

B.42:  That's right. 

A.43:  And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written. 

B.44:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.45:  Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um,
adults.  I was always,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # just # more aware of her jer-, you know, for her young people, her books.

B.48:  Yeah, and she's more famous for that,

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  but she has been writing for adults also,

A.51:  I'll be darned. 

B.52:  and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,

A.53:  # Yeah.  #

B.54:  # and # see what it was like.  It was very, um, [lipsmack]  the style was
very conversational. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  [Lipsmack] You would have lots of conversations between people --

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  -- rather than any description. 

A.59:  Right, yeah, yeah. 

B.60:  You know how that is, and um,

A.61:  Yeah.  I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got
anything printed, in print. 

B.62:  Yeah, she has, because I, I remember seeing a new book by her --

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  -- that was out, and I think it was a, it was an adult book. 

A.65:  I'll be darned. 

B.66:  So anyway,

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  but that's the last thing I, I've read,

A.69:  #Yeah. #

B.70:  # and, # um,

A.71:  Well, it's, I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't,
let's see, I think I read, oh, when I was on vacation, um, between semester
break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer --

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  -- and I went to my mother's, I read a book that I have, should have read
when I was probably in high school.  I read, um, JANE EYRE. 

B.74:  [Gasp]  I,

A.75:  [Breathing] No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  JANE EYRE?
No, no, no, no, it wasn't JANE EYRE. 

B.76:  WUTHERING HEIGHTS?

A.77:  No, it was, um, uh, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,

B.78:  # Oh, yeah, #

A.79:  # by Jane # Austen. 

B.80:  by Jane Austen, yes. 

A.81:  That's what it was, yes. 

B.82:  Yes. 

A.83:  And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard
that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist, and [breathing] she
really was good.  I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot
was put together so,

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.85:  # intricately # and, um, and, you know, I just, but I, as I say, I was
pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then. 

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  [Laughter]. 

B.88:  Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # or # had to write it, read it in high school or college, but I don't
remember it. 

A.91:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.92:  And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg --

A.93:  Uh-huh. 

B.94:  -- and I got her the, I got her someone, I think it was, um, oh, some
actress reading it. 

A.95:  Oh, how interesting. 

B.96:  You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape. 

A.97:  Yeah. 

B.98:  And so I got that for her, and she loved doing that. 

A.99:  Oh, I'll bet, yeah. 

B.100:  But I remember that was the book. 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,

A.103:  # ((Right)) I wouldn't be, #

B.104:  # I'm just going to # have to put it,

A.105:  surprised, yeah. 

B.106:  in the car sometimes and listen to it. 

A.107:  Sure.  Oh, yeah. 

B.108:  But, um,

A.109:  Well, I read that, and then I'm trying to think, um, usually I try to, to
find something long [breathing]  that,

B.110:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.111:  # I'm # going to, when if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas
vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a
while, um,

B.112:  Yeah.  Oh, that's what I do too. 

A.113:  Yeah, and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for
school.  I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.  Actually, it's for
school, but it's for, um, there's a, a literary jour-, well, not a literary
journal, it's a, [breathing] it's kind of a journal of, of the history of
ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.  The first
issue doesn't come out until next year, but, um,

B.114:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.115:  # I'm doing # some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to
wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,

B.116:  # Oh, how neat.  #

A.117:  # and I've, yeah, # it's really neat because these are brand new books and
I,

B.118:  # Oh, great.  #

A.119:  # just got # a, I got a, th-, this one, um, most of the stuff is on, uh,
literary criticism and philosophy,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # and # religion and all that. 

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach, and it's a, a, a biography,

B.124:  # Oh, great.  #

A.125:  # that is # really interesting,

B.126:  Oh, that's fascinating. 

A.127:  I mean, it, it's fascinating, it really is. 

B.128:  Oh. 

A.129:  Um, but it's so long, I, I don't really have the time to read the whole
thing, but I think,

B.130:  # Yeah.  #

A.131:  # eventually # I'll go back to it.  But it's,

B.132:  # Yeah.  #

A.133:  # it # was written, I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one, so
it's a brand new book. 

B.134:  Oh, it's a brand new book. 

A.135:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.136:  Oh, that, that would be wonderful --

A.137:  Yeah,

B.138:  -- # to read something like that.  #

A.139:  # and he really, this man really # shed some light on, um, [lipsmack] some,

B.140:  # Yeah.  #

A.141:  # aspects # of [breathing]  of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the,
and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, [breathing] 
um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as
anything.  I mean, you know, that was --

B.142:  Yes.

A.143:  -- it was families had just loads of musicians [laughter]. 

B.144:  Yeah, and they just went from generation,

A.145:  # Yeah.  #

B.146:  # probably # to generation,

A.147:  # that's right.  #

B.148:  # just with # these, with these all passing it from one to the other. 

A.149:  Yes, uh-huh, and, um,

B.150:  Yeah, that's the way it was, I'm sure back then. 

A.151:  Yeah.  So, uh,

B.152:  # Yeah.  Oh, that's interesting.  #

A.153:  # it was just really # interesting, if that's, you know, that's kind of
what, but I have to [breathing] not only am, am I re-, reading it to decide
whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of
advisers for this, um, journal [breathing] doesn't have, right now doesn't
have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,

B.154:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.155:  # [Breathing]  # um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man
might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board so,

B.156:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.157:  # I don't # know if I want to take that responsibility or not, but
[laughter]. 

B.158:  Wow, that's rough. 

A.159:  But at least I,

B.160:  # That's real rough.  #

A.161:  # can tell them # what I think, so, um,

B.162:  # Yeah.  #

A.163:  # it's # real interesting. 

B.164:  Well, that's a neat thing to be involved in. 

A.165:  Yeah, it is. 

B.166:  Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they
were just starting a magazine --

A.167:  Uh-huh. 

B.168:  -- that was similar to that. 

A.169:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.170:  I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do --

A.171:  Yes [breathing]. 

B.172:  -- in small colleges,

A.173:  # Yeah, #

B.174:  # but, # um,

A.175:  that it, you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,

B.176:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.177:  # like # that, right, uh-huh,

B.178:  # Yeah.  #

A.179:  # because # it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.  That's one way,
it's really good public relations for small schools,

B.180:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.181:  # I think # so [breathing]. 

B.182:  Yeah. 

A.183:  But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of
my research assistantship, is, um, [breathing] it's helping a professor, uh,
compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems [breathing] for a book
that he's writing, and --

B.184:  Oh. 

A.185:  -- [Breathing]  so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a
lot of different poems and [breathing]  a lot of French people. 

B.186:  Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,

A.187:  Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was
written,

B.188:  # Yeah.  #

A.189:  # in # the French and then has been translated into English by,

B.190:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.191:  # various # people. 

B.192:  Oh, I see. 

A.193:  And the translations are all so different from one another. 

B.194:  All different. 

A.195:  Uh-huh. 

B.196:  Oh, that's interesting. 

A.197:  So it's multiple translations of single works and, [breathing] and that's
right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um, my work, is
just kind of compiling,

B.198:  # Gosh.  #

A.199:  # all # that for him.  So,

B.200:  That's great. 

A.201:  It's real interesting. 

B.202:  Boy, you really lift me up to a different,

A.203:  # [Laughter].  #

B.204:  # [Laughter] # I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,

A.205:  # [/Laughter].  #

B.206:  # cleaning # the stove and,

A.207:  Oh, well, let me tell you,

B.208:  # You know, I'm [laughter],  #

A.209:  # There are days when # I would be ((prefer)),

B.210:  # I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.# 

A.211:  # really doing that [laughter].  #

B.212:  That would be nice. 

@@A.213:  [/Laughter] I don't know if I've told you, but, um, this is not on the
subject,
