REMARKS:        There was static and an echo throughout the conversation. 
At one point during the beginning, there was a hissing noise and voice A
suddenly faded momentarily and then picked up once again.  During the
monologue, however, there was no fading.

==========================================================================

A.1:  #Okay.#

@B.2:  #Okay.# Start us. 

A.3:  Alright.  Well, I guess, you know, I, I wasn't expecting that question
about AIDS, so I haven't thought too much about it but I guess that I think
that we should have more research.  Um, I'm just concerned that it's just
going to be such a major health problem.

B.4:  #Yeah.#

A.5:  #And# if we, you know, and if it's not, I say, it would seem to me the
sooner we take care of it, the better off we're going to be.

B.6:  Right, because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse.

A.7:  Well, that's what I think.

B.8:  Ye-,

A.9:  And, it's going to start affecting all of the population.

B.10:  #Yeah.#

A.11:  #You know,# I mean, #right now# --

B.12:  #It already has.#

A.13:  -- yeah, you know, and it's just going to become such a huge issue.  And
it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  So, I #guess,# 

B.16:  #Although# they're doing a whole more than they were five years #ago.#

A.17:  #Yes.#

B.18:  You know, they're living longer and, and their medicines are a whole lot
better.  So, they're not having to go through as many of the, as, of the other
diseases, or so it sounds #anyway.#

A.19:  #Yeah,# yeah.

B.20:  As, you know, when, when all of this first started out, they, they came
down with every single disease that came down the pipes because they had no
immune system --

A.21:  Right {very faintly}.

B.22:  -- and, they suffered so much worse.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  So --

A.25:  Wel-, 

B.26:  -- you know, at, at least they're making progress but they've got to get it
stopped.  They've got to find a cure.

A.27:  Well, I think so, too.  And so, I guess I would, you know, personally I
would be really in favor of that.  Now, I have had, um, I have two friends
who died of #it.#

B.28:  #So# have I.

A.29:  And, uh, so, and those have just, you know, it's just been real hard.   

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And I just hate seeing people, [sigh] you know, go through this.  So, and I
keep thinking, it's going to hit our church eventually, #you know.#

B.32:  #Well,# yeah.

A.33:  It's like, uh, it's, it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody
yet, but, you know, it's going to just start affecting I think, everyone.

B.34:  Well, especially with, you know, surgeries all the time.  

A.35:  I know.

B.36:  It's so scary.

A.37:  It is really scary.  You know, I, I thought of that for myself, for like my
children.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  This whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary.

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  Because, you know, people don't know.  That's the thing.

B.42:  #Right.#

A.43:  #There's,# there's a time factor in there.

B.44:  Yeah, and you know, well with the time factor it could be up to ten years.

A.45:  I know.

B.46:  You know.  So, that's what's so bad.  And, and you may test negative this
time but you may test positive, you know, two weeks down the road.

A.47:  I know.

B.48:  So, the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever.

A.49:  Well, that's right and I think, you know, people give blood innocently
enough --  

B.50:  Yeah [noise].

A.51:  -- assuming that they're okay.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  I don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they, I don't know,
I guess they might.  But, uh, you know, I, I would hate to be in a position
where I would need a transfusion or my children.  I think it would be a real
scary thing.

B.54:  Yeah, and, and like when I went in the hospital, you have to sign a paper
saying that, that you'll allow them to give blood if they, if you need it.
Otherwise, they won't do the surgery.

A.55:  Oh.

B.56:  [Laughter]  So, what do you do?

A.57:  Yeah, really.

B.58:  I mean, yeah, you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you
say no I don't want the blood, then they, they may say well then I'm not
#going to do the surgery.#

A.59:  # Th-, yeah,# right.  Well because, yeah, then what are they going to do?  

B.60:  Right, right.  #What# --

A.61:  #I'm,#

B.62:  -- what can they do?

A.63:  They have no other alternative, I suppose.  Um, [lipsmack] well, I, I don't
know, I mean I just, [static] but then I think, well, [static] a yeah, I guess
that basically I do think we just need more research because that's going to
sort of be our only answer.

B.64:  Well, that's right.  And they've got to do something about it.  They can't
put it on the back burner and just say, well, you know, the research is going
on and doing good enough, because it's not.  There's no cure yet.

A.65:  Well, and I worry, you know, the older my children get the more expos-,
chances of exposure they're going to have.

B.66:  You #got it.# 

A.67:  #I mean I can't# imagine, well, even for you, being a single person.  I
mean, I think, [sigh] gosh, how scary, you know, to meet people and,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  Y-, you know.  

B.70:  Of course I don't have that problem [laughter].

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  I probably will never have to worry about that [/laughter].

A.73:  Uh [/laughter].

B.74:  Oh gosh, what a shame [laughter].

A.75:  [Laughter]  Well, you might, you know, eventually,

B.76:  Slight chance, you think.

A.77:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  

B.78:  Ugh.

A.79:  That might eventually happen.

B.80:  #Oh.#

A.81:  #But,# uh,

B.82:  It is, it's like, okay show me your papers #[laughter].#

A.83:  #I mean,# [laughter] I mean really.

B.84:  Then we'll talk.

A.85:  I know.  Well, it's just a, it's just a sad thing and, I don't know
hopefully, this is going to get taken care of -- 

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- #at some point.#

B.88:  #Well, they're# doing a lot over in Europe --

A.89:  #Yeah.#

B.90:  -- #with it.#  And I know when Randy was so sick, he was having medications
flown in from Europe because he couldn't get his hands on it over here.  And,
uh,

A.91:  Oh, this was your husband, wasn't it? 

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  That's right.  I've forgotten that.  You told me that but I'd forgotten.

B.94:  Yeah.  So, he was, he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe.

A.95:  Uh-huh [sigh].

B.96:  And then, he finally was able to get the, what is, the #A Z T# --

A.97:  #A Z T?#

B.98:  -- over here, only because he had connections,

A.99:  [Noise] {sounds like water running}.

B.100:  that was not open to the public at that time.

A.101:  Um.

B.102:  So, I don't know but they've got to do it because it's, it's everywhere.  

A.103:  Well, I know, and, a-, you know, and make it available to people th-, that
can use it, #I, you know# --

B.104:  #To everybody.#

A.105:  -- if I were sick I would try anything I think.  I mean, what do
you have to lose?

B.106:  Of course.

A.107:  I mean [laughter],  

B.108:  #That's right.#

A.109:  #That's not,# that's what's so crazy, I mean, what's to lose at this point?

B.110:  There's nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do.

A.111:  I would, if it were me. 

B.112:  Yeah, or if it was one of my kids.

A.113:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, you'd want, you'd want everything available and then
to think, well, it's available but you, I mean, you know, you could only get
it in Europe.  Um --

B.114:  Right, no problem.

A.115:  -- would be a terrible --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- that would be a terrible thing.  But, #uh# --

B.118:  #Yeah.#

A.119:  -- how long was he, how long was Randy sick?  

B.120:  A little over two years.

A.121:  Um.

B.122:  A little over two years and at that point he was, the fifth, fifth longest
survivor.  But see, that was almost four years ago.

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  And now they're living a whole lot longer.  [Lipsmack]  So, but he, I mean,
jeez, he had everything under the sun.  He had hepatitis, he had meningitis,
he got throat cancer and he never --

A.125:  Ooh.

B.126:  -- smoked even a grapevine, much less a cigarette, you know.  Um, just you
name it, #he, he just,# 

A.127:  #So he was really# susceptible.

B.128:  Oh, it was horrible.  It was horrible.

A.129:  That's awful.

B.130:  Yeah.  And then I had another very dear friend of mine die four months
after Randy did.

A.131:  Huh.

B.132:  And, uh, he didn't know he was sick.  He'd just, you know, had a cold that
he couldn't shake all winter --

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  -- and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and
uh, he had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen
#hours# --

A.135:  #Uh-huh.#

B.136:  -- of going to the hospital.

A.137:  Uh.  Well, in some ways that's a blessing.

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  I mean it's such a awful thing to suffer through.

B.140:  Yeah. #Yeah# --

A.141:  #Well my,# 

B.142:  -- and his friend had died the year before.

A.143:  Huh.

B.144:  And they swore it wasn't AIDS but I know darn good and well it #was.#

A.145:  #Yeah.# Yeah.

B.146:  You know, so [sigh], ooh, it's just that that's close to home.

A.147:  Well, I know.  It is.  Well, my two friends, both, one, one lived a fairly
long time with it.  I'd say Ken had it, well, he thinks he had, he was H I V
for ten years.  #You know, I mean,# 

B.148:  #You're kidding.#

A.149:  No, he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties.  #Uh# --

B.150:  #Um, my# gosh.

A.151:  -- and then he died in eighty-nine.

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  So, and then Harry, {voices fade almost immediately}
