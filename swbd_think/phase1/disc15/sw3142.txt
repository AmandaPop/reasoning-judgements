=============================================================================

A.1:  [Lipsmack] Okay, well I guess I enjoy eating out, um, uh, here and there,
or it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home
and I guess I like a variety of, a variety of restaurants.

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Uh, sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries
and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal, and sometimes it's, I enjoy
it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal.

B.4:  Yes.

A.5:  And, uh, sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  Something, #you know,#

B.8:  #Do# you usually go out, uh, with the children or without them?

A.9:  Well, a variety.  I, I like to go sometimes without them and,

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  sometimes I, sometimes it's okay to take them along. So [laughter],

B.12:  Right [laughter].

A.13:  Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner
--

B.14:  Yes.

A.15:  -- or lunches so, uh, it just, you know, it just varies, we do a mix.
Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband
and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, you know,
have a moment of peace and quiet without [breathing] --

B.16:  Yes.

A.17:  -- little ones at the table.

B.18:  Yes.

A.19:  So, uh, [lipsmack] #I guess# --

B.20:  #Well,# 

A.21:  -- I guess actually on those, those times, uh, we even, there are times I
even say, oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children, 

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  this is our night out.  So but, uh, anyway, where do you like to eat?

B.24:  Uh, well, uh, we don't have any children so, uh, we tend to,

A.25:  [Noise].

B.26:  like to try all sorts of different things.  And, uh, we're very attracted
to exotic food.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And, uh, we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, uh, sort of gourmet
Mexican and, uh, things like that, as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and, uh,
Chinese and things, and, and things of that sort.  Now, yes, of course, we
like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or
hamburgers [laughter] --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- or something like that, too.  And, uh, we probably go out one to two
times a week.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  And, uh, uh, we're pretty much regulars at an Italian, local Italian
restaurant.

A.33:  Oh, which one do you like?

B.34:  Momo's.

A.35:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's been a long time since we've been in there but, uh,
but it's good.  There's an Italian restaurant over, over by the mall, over by,
uh, Plano Parkway there, ((pas-)) {very faintly} -- 

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- Oh, is it Campari's or something?

B.38:  I've heard about it, I haven't been in there.

A.39:  Well, it's good.  I haven't, my husband had been in there several times
and we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, uh, their pastas were great.  

B.42:  Tha-, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.  I, I like
different kinds of food.  So, when we go out, I'm always looking for something
other than the standard menu, even if,

A.43:  [Noise].

B.44:  it's a Mexican Restaurant, like something other than, uh, you know the
standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and -- 

A.45:  [Sniffing]  #You're brave [laughter].#

B.46:  -- #fajitas now.#  Yes, yes and once in a while things backfire.  I
mean, we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food, and things #like that# --

A.47:  #Oh, God.#

B.48:  -- And I'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try, we'll try
anything.  

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  Ethiopian, we've had Ethiopian.  And, uh, not in Plano of #course
[laughter].# 

A.51:  #No,# I don't think so [laughter].

B.52:  But, we really, we really do enjoy going out and uh, and, um, I'm pretty
adventurous in cooking, too, which also occasionally [laughter] backfires.

A.53:  [Lipsmack] Oh, well. [laughter] Even though traditional it can backfire.

B.54:  Yeah.  I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a
restaurant or, or what attracts us to a restaurant.  How do you usually find
a, a new restaurant?

A.55:  Uh, well my husband's kind of the eth-, he, he's the ethnic fan.  So he's,
I don't know.  You know what, we read, we read the, uh, D MAGAZINE --

B.56:  Uh-huh. So do we.

A.57:  --  we, we check that and, uh, the Friday section in the newspaper --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- the pull out section there.  They often do ratings of restaurants, #so#
--

B.60:  #Right.#

A.61:  -- uh, we've, uh, we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on,
from there, uh, just for something that had a high rating.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  We have found, uh, a number of restaurants either through D and
the,

A.63:  [Noise].

B.64:  Friday paper and sometimes the, the OBSERVER.  Which my husband usually
picks up.

A.65:  Okay.

B.66:  And also through coupons.  When a new restaurant opens up, they usually
send out coupons.

A.67:  #That's,# 

B.68:  #And you know, when# they say, you know, buy one get one free.

A.69:  That's right.

B.70:  It's hard to resist, 

A.71:  [Noise].

B.72:  so we'll go in.  And very often we'll, 

A.73:  [Noise].

B.74:  find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they, give, they no
longer give coupons.  We'll, we'll, uh, we'll stay there.

A.75:  Oh good.  #Oh, good.#

B.76:  #But# we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through
coupons,

A.77:  [Lipsmack].

B.78:  and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews.

A.79:  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too.  That's true.
That's true.

B.80:  I mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and
you've got say four or something like that.  It's very expensive to go out to
eat.  

A.81:  Oh right.  Right.

B.82:  So, yeah that, that is really one of our, it's almost a hobby with us.

A.83:  Well I think that it's just, that's ex-, [laughter],  

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  sometimes I think going out to eat it's, it's sort of a recreation.

B.86:  Yes.

A.87:  So, uh, just a, just a change of pace --  

B.88:  Yes.

A.89:  -- from, uh, eating at home.  #So, uh# --

B.90:  #Yeah.#

A.91:  -- anyway.  I guess, uh, as far as, as far as service when we go out --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- gosh, it's nice, it's nice to have someone [throat_clearing] come and
wait the table.

B.94:  Oh, absolutely.

A.95:  And clear the table and,

B.96:  And do the dishes [laughter].

A.97:  Yeah, and do the dishes.  And, uh, actually it's kind of nice to, you know,
I always, uh, a waitress or waiter that waits the table, [throat_clearing] it's
nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive.

B.98:  Oh, yes.

A.99:  So, uh, we've had experience with that, too.  So,

B.100:  M-, m-, m-, my sister, who also lives here in Dallas, uh, tends to, uh,
chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the
course of dinner, which drives me absolutely batty.

A.101:  Oh, yeah. [laughter]  Well, [throat_clearing] #how we [laughter]#  --

B.102:  #((but)),#

A.103:  -- it may, it may help their tip, may not, huh.

B.104:  What's your favorite restaurant?

A.105:  [Sigh]  Gosh, I guess just in Plano, I, Plano I like to go to Souper
Salads.

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  Uh, Chili's, Chili's is always fine.

B.108:  Sure.

A.109:  I guess if we go to Dallas, into Dallas, we like, uh, the Routh, is it
Routh Street Cafe.

B.110:  You know, we've never been there. 

A.111:  [Noise] #Well# --

B.112:  #And# that's supposed to be wonderful.

A.113:  -- well, you would like it.

B.114:  Um.

A.115:  You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  It just, we've, we've taken people there several times and, uh, they have
a good, they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding.  I
guess, it's, whether you call it Southwestern but, uh, oh we had venison --

B.118:  Ooh.

A.119:  -- venison chili one time.  Which was absolutely wonderful.  And then I
guess it must be seasonal and we've been back, oh, I guess it's in the winter
season well they've never had it --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- when we've been back, so.  But, uh, well you ought to try that.  It's,
it's, it's very #good.#

B.122:  #I# would probably like that.  One or two times in my life I've ever
had venison, I've loved it.  But, you know, just, it's just not, I don't know
people who hunt so [laughter], 

A.123:  [Lipsmack].

B.124:  #uh# --

A.125:  #No.#

B.126:  -- That's, that's supposed to be a wonderful place. W-, uh, uh, uh, here in
Plano, well, we tend to go to Momo's a, l-, fairly often.  And, uh, sometimes
we'll go, you know, we, we also go to Chili's and, uh, Colter's Bar B Q, and,
and uh, we go to, lil-, there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that,
we go to.  My husband particularly likes that.  We go into Dallas,

A.127:  [Noise].

B.128:  a lot and, because we're both were from the Richardson, North Dallas area,
up until fairly recently.  And, uh, we'll go down to, uh, Blue Mesa Grill,
Mexican food, and --

A.129:  Oh, that's good.  Yes, I've been there.
