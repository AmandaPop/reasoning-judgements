=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess we're going to talk about budgets and spending, and

B.2:  O-, okay.

@A.3:  I don't have a set budget.  I just [laughter] know what I have coming in
and I know what I have to keep in reserve in order to survive.

B.4:  Well, I, I, uh, I have one, though, written out.  But just basic things,
but what always ruins mine each month is all these other things like --

A.5:  Unexp-, --

B.6:  -- car repairs,

A.7:  -- unexpected, unexpected expenses.

B.8:  Yes, yes, yes,

A.9:  Yes, the things that crop up that you didn't plan for.

B.10:  Right, I, I just have mine all written up.  If I didn't have any of those,
it would come out to that [laughter].

A.11:  [Laughter] So that's why we always have to have a reserve somewhere so we
can not be caught shorthanded.

B.12:  Right --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- right.  I also keep, uh, my finances, I make a big chart at the
beginning of the year, and [breathing] each column, you know, is each
different expense, and then I add them up at the end of each month, so that,
and I post it, kind of, from my checkbook.

A.15:  I see.

B.16:  And then I add them up at the end of each month so I do know exactly what I
spent, and then I can look at my chart and see what I spent where.

A.17:  Uh-huh, do you --

B.18:  And that's the way I do mine.

A.19:  -- do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not, make a forecast of
what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are?

B.20:  Yeah, I can do that because I can add across then for twelve months, you
know, on my chart.  I can add it up at the end of the year and see what I
spent.

A.21:  But you,

B.22:  But again, when you say budget, that budget that I make that's supposed to
work for the year, it doesn't have all these extra things on it that
[laughter] come up.  Like we spent eighteen hundred dollars last month getting
our shower redone, you know.

A.23:  Was your shower pan out of kilter?

B.24:  Um, oh, we had a leak and the tiles just all started falling in --

A.25:  Oh, my.

B.26:  -- uh, and this the third, this house is eighteen years old, and it's the
third time it's happened.  The first time it was the pan --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and then the next time it was termites, and then this time I think it
was just some kind of a leak [laughter].  But anyway.

A.29:  Those,

B.30:  Anyway, uh, our house is to an age that, that a big part that's not
budgeted,

A.31:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.32:  is have to use for repairs.

A.33:  You know, it really is a shame the way they build houses, though, because
you can go over to England and look at those castles that are four and five
hundred years old, and they're like, you know, so, like a Rock of Gibraltar --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- they're so steady and steadfast and just rigorous constructed.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  And our homes here in the States, you know, they're made to, a good wind
would blow them over --

B.38:  Yeah, [laughter] that's true.

A.39:  -- which is really a shame for the, to speak of the building industry like
that.

B.40:  Yeah, yeah, things do --

A.41:  I mean the,

B.42:  -- wear out fast.

A.43:  Well, much faster than they did when I was a child growing up, I mean,
those houses were made to last.

B.44:  Now, where did you grow up?

A.45:  In Detroit.

B.46:  Um, uh-huh, okay, so you're used to homes with basements and that sort,

A.47:  Oh, yes, solid foundations and wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and
the whole bit.  Yes.

B.48:  Well, maybe homes for, have always been built more sturdier in the north
than down here because of the snows and winters and everything.

A.49:  Well, I, see I don't have anything to base that on, because I was an adult
when I moved here.  I've been in Dallas about twelve years, and you know, I
haven't really seen, um, a quality home.  Even the homes that I see that are,
that they're building out in North Dallas where they're paying just thousands
and thousands of dollars for, they're using plywood, I mean, pressed board on
the roof.

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  If I was the buyer I'd have a fit.

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  They're not even using, um, a pure wood produc-,

B.54:  Plywood, is that what, what,

A.55:  Well, no, not, not plywood, pressed wood, you know, where they take all
these remnants and press them together.

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  I would have, I would have a complete fit if I saw my new home being built
like that.

B.58:  I guess so many people don't know that much about construction that they
know these things to look for.

A.59:  I think we should have steel girders in our homes and there're not.

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  I, I just, um, it's just, it's ridiculous.  I just feel very, very
disheartened abo-, about the way I see the building industry go.

B.62:  Um.

A.63:  No wonder, you know, the hail damage is so extensive and, and things like
that where it shouldn't be, and your homes, if they cat-, catch on fire, they
go up within a matter of minutes rather than, you know, uh, it takes a long
time for the fire really to get a hold --

B.64:  Oh, yeah, yeah, we,

A.65:  -- because they're inf-, they're using inferior inflammable material.

B.66:  Oh, the house next door to us burned a few years ago, but what really got
it, we had wood shingles, all wood shingle roofs in this neighborhood.

A.67:  Well, see, they should have known that, they should have made, uh --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- they should have dipped them and, and prevented, and made them fire
proof.  They, they knew, you know, they knew, I mean, you know, where are our
engineers at, our building engineers,

B.70:  Well, you know, maybe, maybe there should just be, um, laws or something
that the builders specifications that they,

A.71:  Well, yeah,

B.72:  #have to do,#

A.73:  #there are codes.#  Well it's their, the building codes and the building
laws are too slack.  That's what wrong, they're not stringent enough.  They're
not after the consumer, they're after the builder, they're protecting the
builder and not the consumer.

B.74:  Oh, definitely, right.

A.75:  Yeah, I know it.

B.76:  Well I guess we've kind of gotten off the subject, haven't we?  [Laughter].

A.77:  Yes, we did,

B.78:  We should have --

A.79:  we got caught, we kind of,

B.80:  -- been talking about home repairs.

A.81:  Oh, dear, I hope --

B.82:  No.

A.83:  -- we don't get in trouble.

B.84:  Well, if,

A.85:  But as far as a budget goes, I do not have a budget, I just know what my
income is --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- and I have X number of dollars, um, dedicated to a savings program, and
X number of dollars for contribution, and, but that's automatically in my
brain, so it's --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- not written down on paper.  I'm so used to it that, um,

B.90:  Well, I guess the thing we do, if we're, when we're short, we have one of
these, uh, line of credit [inhaling] accounts at, uh, [breathing] First City
in Richardson, it's like for ten thousand.  So, so if we, like we had to buy a
new roof a few months ago that --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- was four thousand dollars --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- well, something like that we put on that line of credit and then we try
to, you know, pay it off --

A.95:  Is that,

B.96:  -- as we can, you know, that's ho-, that's what we do with things we can't
afford I guess you would say,

A.97:  So you,
