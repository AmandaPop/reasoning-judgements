REMARKS:        Speaker B had continuous background noise -- (dishes) 
clinking noises, dog barking, talking, laughter, television.  I've only 
made notations in the text where the background overrode the Speakers' 
conversation.

============================================================================

A.1:  [Beep] Okay.

B.2:  I had, uh, just, my last car I bought was a new one.  I ordered it from,
uh, you know, from the factory with all the little options and stuff I wanted
on it.

A.3:  All the goodies.  

B.4:  It was a Oldsmobile.  

A.5:  An Oldsmobile.  Had you owned Oldsmobiles before?  

B.6:  Yes, I had.  I liked, uh, I had had a four four two and I, when I was
younger and that was, uh [laughter] quite a car.

A.7:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And you, what just the memory of that made you go to
Oldsmobile again or, 

B.8:  Uh, well, I looked around.  Uh, I think it may have had some influence.  I
just liked, uh, this particular car.  It was a good buy.  I got it through the
T I, they had at the time the fleet purchase agreement.

A.9:  Oh, yeah.  

B.10:  So that, uh, took a lot of the hassle out of it.  And, uh, anyway I got all
the things I wanted, the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that.

A.11:  Do you, are you still driving that car?  

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  How old is it now?  

B.14:  It was eighty-five.  

A.15:  Eighty-five, are you going to be looking again soon, or how long, do you
normally keep cars for a long time or, 

B.16:  Well, uh, I am now.  I've, uh, [laughter] I bought a houseboat and had
other expenses --

A.17:  Oh, my [laughter].  

B.18:  -- so I'm not, I'm not in the m-, any position to be [laughter] buying a
car right away.

A.19:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.20:  Although, I was, look like I might have to, but, because I had a little
trouble with it.  I had to have a valve job and so forth done on it.

A.21:  Oh, my.  

B.22:  Seem to be running pretty good now.  

A.23:  Was it still under warranty or,  

B.24:  Oh, no, no, this was just recently.  

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You put a lot of miles on a car or,  

B.26:  Uh, yeah, I do a pretty good bit.  I've got about ninety-six thousand on
this one here.

A.27:  Oh, my.  For what, almost six, well six years, huh.  

B.28:  Yeah.  I drive about eighteen miles out to the plant and back --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- each day, I mean each way.  Thirty-six miles a day.  

A.31:  Well, we don't, we don't buy new cars that often.  We drive them, you know,
till they get maybe seven or eight years old and then we'll, what we'll do is
sell off, we'll have one about seven, say, and one that's twelve or thirteen
years old and we'll get rid of it and then we'll --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- buy a new one and, and, uh, I guess right now we have a, a seventy-eight
Chevy wagon and then a, a four year old, uh, Crown Victoria that I love 
and,

B.34:  [Laughter] You like Fords, huh.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Well, my husband's, my husband got to chose, choose the make
[laughter] --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- and then I got everything else [laughter].  

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  He, he, he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home, he's in, in
college, but he drives an old Ford, seventy-seven Ford pick up --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- that he loves, but, no, I, this was the last year they made the big
Crown Victoria --

B.42:  Oh, yeah.  

A.43:  -- and, before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly, so I,

B.44:  [Laughter].  

A.45:  it loo-, I, I guess some people think it looks boxy, but, always like
to, to have a, room in a car --

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  -- I'm not into compacts.  I like -- 

B.48:  That's, uh -- 

A.49:  -- something you can relax in.  

B.50:  -- something we, uh, were interested in for our kids while they were
learning how to drive was a pretty good size car, although --

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  -- two of them decided on trucks, pick up trucks.

A.53:  Well, that's not, that's a good choice for a child, I think to start, to
start to drive in.

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  Our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours, but our second one, uh,
bought a real old, I guess it was a Olds ninety-eight, but it was one that was
still metal before [laughter] they brought in fiberglass, and we, she was such
a nervous driver we felt like she's probably better off in that [laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.57:  You know, if she, if anything did happen, she was going to be all right
but,

B.58:  Well, that's true.  I mean they, uh, they should have a little car around
them.

A.59:  Not, well, just for safety's sake.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  And, I don't know, I, I look at the new ones on the market now and the, the
bodies are so --

B.62:  Plastic.

A.63:  -- sleek, I guess, for wind resistance.  

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  You know, and, and, uh, they just don't look like they're roomy inside.  I
guess they are.  I haven't been looking at them to,

B.66:  Well, there's a lot less room in this one I have than the earlier ones I've
had.

A.67:  Oh, really?  

B.68:  Yeah, this is supposedly a, I guess they call it a mid-size car, but
[laughter],

A.69:  Uh-huh.  Is it supposed to seat six?  

B.70:  It, uh, well, no, it's a, it's got bucket seats in the front. 

A.71:  Uh, okay.  

B.72:  You can fit, you can sit five people in it.  

A.73:  A lot of knee room in the back or,

B.74:  It's fair.  Uh, nothing anything like your Crown Victoria [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah {faint}.

B.76:  Just, you know, you can sit in there and it's, it's reasonably comfortable.

A.77:  Right, right.  

B.78:  I don't sit back there very often [laughter].  

A.79:  Well I, e-, even in our car I know, like when my husband and my sons and
sons in laws all have long legs, they're tall people, and so if one of, like,
my husband's driving, then he soot-, scoots his seat back --

B.80:  Yeah, me, too [laughter].  

A.81:  -- and so we can't put a, we can't put a tall person with long legs behind
him.

B.82:  Same here.  

A.83:  So it,  

B.84:  S-, I'm six foot, four, so [laughter],   

A.85:  Oh, my word.  Yeah, you're like my son-in-law.  No that's, so you can't,
then, then like I could sit in back because I'm only five four, so my legs
would fit --

B.86:  W-, 

A.87:  -- fine back there, but you couldn't put a, a real long legged person back
there comfortably.

B.88:  That influences my car purchase decision, too, because I can't really get
in a lot of these Toyotas and --

A.89:  Right.  

B.90:  -- Hondas and stuff.  

A.91:  Well, yeah.  I wonder sometimes, you know, we have the Dallas Mavericks
here that play --

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- and they'll show them sometimes on T V and they've all got these real
low,

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  sports cars -- 

B.96:  Maybe, yeah,  

A.97:  -- and I,  

B.98:  Well, now sports cars, they have a lot of rooms for your legs, you know,
you kind of s-, lay,

A.99:  Well, I've never been in one, so I, but I'm always wondering how on earth
somebody six seven, six eight [laughter] is getting into those little old
things.

B.100:  Yeah, to a little more of a reclining position.  

A.101:  [Laughter] They must -- 

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  -- because I don't know where they're going [laughter].

B.104:  [Laughter] Yeah, their feet go way up under them.  I've drive a Camer-, I
mean a, the, uh, Chevy Cor-,

A.105:  #Corvette.# 

B.106:  #Corvette.#

A.107:  Well, even to get out of it though.  I mean, #you're# --

B.108:  #(( )).#

A.109:  -- only a foot off the ground at the most.

B.110:  That's true.

A.111:  And it's got to be, you know you can't get your leg out and (( )), I
thought, I always, you always see them standing by it, you know, if they're
advertising

B.112:  [Laughter]. 

A.113:  They don't ever show them getting in and out.  

B.114:  Yeah, right.  

A.115:  And I thought, that's the part I'd like to see [laughter],

B.116:  [Laughter] [barking]. 

A.117:  is them getting in or out.  

B.118:  The unfolding and folding act.  

A.119:  Right.  Well, listen, I never had a car that's had the swivel seats that
where you can like when you're wanting to get out, you just turn it to the
side and then --

B.120:  No --  

A.121:  -- your feet are --

B.122:  -- I haven't either.

A.123:  -- and, and I don't even know if they, I know for a while back I saw them
advertise that and I thought that might be kind of a neat --

B.124:  Looks like a real good idea to me.  

A.125:  -- a neat thing to have, but I, I, for some reason, they don't carry them,
and I don't know if they found they were unsafe, or --

B.126:  Huh.  

A.127:  -- you know, maybe to do that, they had, couldn't make them where they were
just real stable.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  One thing our d-, our car doesn't have that I'd look for in another car is
that, that little [noise] gutter, like it runs, so that when you open the door
the water doesn't [laughter] just come off the,

B.130:  Yeah.  

A.131:  It doesn't have that, so when you open our car door, it comes.  The new,
the new one does --

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  -- so they, I guess that's [laughter] the year, they learned that's not a
good idea, because it just comes right off the roof and straight down.

B.134:  [Laughter]. 

A.135:  And just, you know, I try to put an umbrella up there, but that doesn't
help too much.

B.136:  [Laughter].

A.137:  It just, so I get the interior wet and I don't like to do that, just along
the side there.

B.138:  Well, you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here, I'll bet
[laughter].

A.139:  Well, I, I don't know [laughter].  We,   

B.140:  Sure been wet this, I never seen a spring like this.  

A.141:  How many inches do you all average a year?  

B.142:  Huh?  

A.143:  How many inches do you average a year?  

B.144:  Oh, I don't know, but we're way, we must be way above average this year
because it's been terrible.

A.145:  You just have -- 

B.146:  Just rain, rain, rain.  

A.147:  -- had a lot.  

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  Is it, is it, uh, kind of a dirty rain?  You know, I, I've never been down
in there, but you always here how polluted with all the oil,

B.150:  No [laughter].  

A.151:  It's not?  

B.152:  No [laughter].  

A.153:  It's not?    

B.154:  Uh-huh.  It's just rain [laughter] [barking].  

A.155:  Well, I, I didn't, course,  

B.156:  No, it's, uh, I don't think it's any particularly polluted here.  I mean,
you can,

A.157:  It is up here, too, it is everywhere but,    

B.158:  I guess if you went, uh, if you went over by the -- 

A.159:  With all the oil.  

B.160:  -- refineries and stuff --  

A.161:  Right.  

B.162:  -- you might. 

A.163:  Right, that's where I was thinking of.  

B.164:  No, that doesn't,  

A.165:  That doesn't --

B.166:  Uh-uh.

A.167:  -- that doesn't affect,  

B.168:  No, we never notice that over here.  We live on the northwest side.

A.169:  Oh.  Then you don't have any trouble with the water.  

B.170:  Hi there, Mr. Colombia [laughter] {to someone else in the room}.  Just had
a friend come back from Colombia [talking].

A.171:  Oh, my.  Well, I just, I don't know, I, you know, I just hear that [noise]
{laughing in the background} when you read about Houston, seems like they're,
course, [noise] {loud talking in background} all their advertising, or, not
advertising, but news reporting is maybe an oil --

B.172:  Uh-huh.  

A.173:  -- refinery blowing up or something like that.  

B.174:  [Laughter]. 

A.175:  You don't ever, I, I need to get down that way, I guess, sometime, when I
retire.

B.176:  They have a -- 

A.177:  See what they, 

B.178:  -- lot, yeah, it's not that far.  

A.179:  [Laughter] I know -- 

B.180:  They have a,  

A.181:  -- my grandchildren keep me landlocked.  

B.182:  They have a, uh, big, you know, it's a big complexes all around the ship
channel over on the --

A.183:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.184:  -- east, east side of town, southeast.  Other than that, you know, it's a
nice, clean city.

A.185:  Huh.  

B.186:  Real modern.  

A.187:  Yeah, I, that was where they had, when the economy went bad a couple years
back they had all the limousines for such good buys.

B.188:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.189:  We had one of our principles at our, of a school here in Plano, an
elementary school went down and bought one.

B.190:  Uh-huh.  

A.191:  I think she paid eighteen or twenty thousand dollars [laughter] for a
limousine and she's still driving that thing around, and they tease her just,
just, you know, to see her drive up in front of the school, [loud talking in
background] everybody wonders who it is.  It was just a,

B.192:  Yeah, never heard of limousines being a good buy.  Know we had plenty of
real estate, though.

A.193:  Well, they just said, you know, the limousine companies were going out of
busy and --

B.194:  Oh, yeah. 

A.195:  -- and you could pick one up -- 

B.196:  Oh, I guess that's true, yeah.  

A.197:  -- for a real good buy and they had, supposedly in Houston, they had a lot
of them.  So I thought well, that, I don't know, we even debated about that at
that time, but decided, no, that wasn't the [laughter],

B.198:  [Laughter].

A.199:  that wasn't the right, when our kids were little we had a van, which we
loved --

B.200:  Oh, yeah.  

A.201:  -- for, for traveling, we had four kids, and they just --

B.202:  We did, 

A.203:  -- that allowed them to really move around. 

B.204:  We had,
