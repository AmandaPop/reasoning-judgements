REMARKS:        Speaker A has a very quiet voice and was difficult to
pick up at times.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Well, Nancy, [laughter] uh, as, as I was talking, my brother, uh, his name
is Ainsley, and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band --

A.2:  Oh. 

B.3:  -- and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center, uh, during the summer
season.  Uh, they were free concerts, but he was with that group for like
twenty-one years and, uh, did both very traditional marches, a lot of, you
know, John Phillips Sousa and, uh, all of, and Franco Goldman.  In fact, the
name of the, uh, the band was because one of the famous, uh, march composers
of all time, uh, Richard Franco Goldman and his son, Edwin, actually I may,
may have those reversed, father and son, started the band like seventy years
ago, I think.  So it's the oldest organization, really of it's type in the
country and, uh, my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as
a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a
number of years.

A.4:  Oh. 

B.5:  So,

A.6:  That, that must have been wonderful.  D-, were you able to hear --

B.7:  Well, I was --

A.8:  -- sometimes?

B.9:  -- able to, uh, to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a,
a concert there [noise], and, uh, it was quite enjoyable, uh, in that, uh, he
also had one of the c-, well, actually there were two of the composers that he
used were actually there at the performance also.

A.10:  Oh. 

B.11:  So I got to meet them.  And, in particular, I got to go to the rehearsal
beforehand and that was when I realized how good he really was, was at a
rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of, uh, working with the
musicians.  And one of his biggest struggles, uh, with the band was that this
was all union musicians --

A.12:  Oh {faint}. 

B.13:  -- which didn't give him a lot of leeway.  Once they were in the band, uh,
he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing
at that particular season.  And, uh, he ended up with some very unusual
characters in that, that organization.  It was easy to tell that just from the
rehearsal time.  But, uh, anyway, what were you going to tell me about your
dad?

A.14:  Well, uh, actually that lead into a couple different things.  Uh, my dad
worked with unions, uh, for placing so he could really relate to what you were
saying, but, uh, my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so,
uh, even as a child I got to go to a lot of different, uh, kinds of musical
events.  Uh, I grew up in Detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range
of things.  Uh, one of the regrets I have is that I grew up with a house
filled with classical music and music that I really loved, but I never took
the time to find out, uh, who the composers were or, it, it was just always
there and there were certain things that, uh, I liked so much, but I still
have trouble to this day, sometimes, I will recognize a passage, but I'll have
no idea what it's from --

B.15:  Oh.  

A.16:  -- or whose it is and, uh, over the last few years and when my father lived
with us, uh, I made more of an effort to learn, but, uh, that's something that
I regretted.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  But, uh, when you mentioned the band music, my son just started high school
this year and has been in band since middle school --

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  -- but this was the first year with marching band and I really enjoy band
music.  Uh, it,

B.21:  Oh, yeah, I was in the band in high school.  

A.22:  Oh, what instrument -- 

B.23:  And that,

A.24:  -- did you play?  

B.25:  I played the clarinet.  

A.26:  Oh, I like that a lot {last word faint}.  

B.27:  And, uh, so I, I did that my, all through high school and then I guess my
first year in college I played, but it wasn't a marching band, it was just a,
it was a symphonic band and, uh, ironically, in college, the marching band was
part of the athletic department, rather than the music department.

A.28:  Oh [laughter]. 

B.29:  [Laughter] And I was, I was in the symphonic band that was actually part of
the music department and I thought that was pretty unusual.

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  So,  

A.32:  What, uh, my husband, Tim, played a trombone in high school and he also
played in a, a band in college, not marching band, but symphonic and that was
really the first time that I got to hear a lot of, uh, uh, band music and some
of the wonderful composers other than the traditional Sousa and things --

B.33:  Right.  

A.34:  -- that everybody knows and so I've enjoyed this so much with our son --

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  -- now doing that.  And he plays tuba [laughter] so I don't --

B.37:  A tuba.  

A.38:  -- don't get to see him when he's doing, uh, concerts.  We just see the top
of the bell at the back.

B.39:  [Laughter]. 

A.40:  But in marching season, he's easy to pick out [laughter].

B.41:  Right.  Well, does he bring the tuba home to,

A.42:  Yes.  Uh,

B.43:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.44:  We, uh, [lipsmack] laughed when they're in sixth grade and they try them
out on instruments and try to find the appropriate instruments, we thought of
suggesting that they ought to also find out what vehicles the parents drive
because [laughter],

B.45:  [Laughter]. 

A.46:  uh, the tuba and the sousaphone don't fit in, in every kind of, uh --

B.47:  Yeah, just anything.  

A.48:  -- car.  

B.49:  I have a niece that plays the harp -- 

A.50:  Oh. 

B.51:  -- and she found the same thing that, uh, she had, I think what they call a
troubadour harp for a while and, that she learned on and trained on, but then,
uh, uh, a harp became available which, there are just not very many
instruments, uh, and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived
in, in, uh, Missouri at the time, and they actually drove to Colorado to buy
this instrument, but they first had to go and buy a full sized station wagon,
uh, so they'd have room to bring it home.  And that's dictated their cars
every since then, is having one large enough for a full, you know, concert
harp,

A.52:  [Laughter]. 

B.53:  that she plays [laughter].  Uh, well I, uh, because of my brother's, uh,
work with music, for a long time he was a, uh, a critic for the MUSIC JOURNAL
and as a result of that, he, well, that was part of the reason he ended up
with this incredible classical album, uh, library or collection, which I have
now inherited.

A.54:  Oh. 

B.55:  And, uh, I, I don't listen to in nearly enough.  It's the same sort of
thing, there's so much music that I recognize, but don't who, you know, who is
the composer, but I've, based on just measuring number of inches or in this
case, feet of albums, that I think I have about a, a, uh, two thousand album
classical record collection now.

A.56:  Oh, gosh.  

B.57:  So I figured that, uh, I could probably listen to a different album every
day of the year for about seven years [laughter].

A.58:  God.  

B.59:  If I wanted to at this point.  But then it's hard to find a place to stack
that much music.

A.60:  Yeah.  

B.61:  Most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room.  But, uh,
anyway, uh,

A.62:  Well, he must have collected that over a period of years.  

B.63:  Well, he really did.  Uh, I know that he was a critic probably in the early
sixties in New York City.  He had, uh, we were thirteen and a half years
apart, I think, and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir
College --

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  -- and, you know, he did not finish high school.  He just went straight to
Westminster, so I never really remember having lived at home with him.  And
after he did get out of college, it was not long he, before he, uh, just moved
to New York City knowing that that's where he had to live to, quote, unquote,
make it in the music world.  And, uh, became a music critic and that probably
puts us somewhere around the early sixties, uh, when he was doing that.  I've
seen that date a good bit on the, uh, on some of the albums because he would
typically, uh, sign and date everything that, I think everything that he owned
he did that with [laughter].  But certainly all of his albums and all of the
music, uh, he, had signed and dated.

A.66:  I was going to ask you and, it seemed that there must have been a big gap,
uh, I, also have a brother who's thirteen years older and --

B.67:  My goodness.  

A.68:  -- one who's nineteen years older.  You don't run into that very often.

B.69:  You have one that's nineteen years older?  

A.70:  Uh-huh.  

B.71:  My goodness.  That is a wide spread.  Well, we were at the opposite ends.
There were two sisters in between.  But, uh, because he left home so early --

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  -- I think there was one summer I can remember him living at home and I was
maybe six years old.  I mean, other than that, uh, I don't even ever remember
living in, in the same house with him at all.

A.74:  Oh, I'm glad you got to go and hear him in New York.  That, that, uh, that
must have been very special.

B.75:  Well, it was, it was thrilling.  Uh, my mother was with me at the time and
it was, ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that
particular group which he'd been with so long.  She had seen him, fact, she
had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall --

A.76:  Oh. 

B.77:  -- before.  Uh, and I'm not sure, it was probably the American Symphony
Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was, uh, in New York City.  That was
Stokowlski's orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for
quite a while [noise] and it at one point did, in fact, uh, uh, conduct there
at Carnegie Hall.  So she got to see him there and I, I didn't ...
