=======================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, uh, let's see.  What do you use?  How do you control your money.

B.2:  Well, right now we don't have a whole lot of money [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  So there's not much to control.  

A.5:  Okay,

B.6:  [Laughter]  Um, basically, I'm usually the one that, uh, handles the
money.  Um, uh, my husband's been unemployed for a little more than a year --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- so we've kind of, uh, it's been extremely tight, but we've managed
somehow.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Um, we pay the necessities first and, uh, then, from there, if there's
anything left [laughter] --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- try and save some of it.

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  But, uh, how, you want to go ahead and say what you do.

A.15:  Yeah, sure, what we, uh, what we try to do, is of course you have to pay
your, your necessities first, right --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and, uh, you know, your rent and whatever else, and uh, and then after
that we always put away some money for savings, no matter how much it is, uh,
you know, how little or, or whatever --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and, uh, and then after that then we have, then our, our, you know,
spending money or whatever for miscellaneous things.  But one thing that we've
used, and it's, it's kind of good because it gives you kind of a savings plan
sort of, and, uh, what it is we have a ledger, you know, just a, a book, and
in it --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- in it we have different accounts, [child_talking] uh, that, let's say I
would save a hundred dollars a [child_talking] month or something, that's what
would go into savings, for instance --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- [child_talking] uh, we have it so that in that ledger, you know, the
bank just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- well, what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred
dollars, and we break it down into different categories.  So for instance, uh,
let's say twenty dollars would go to, to the cars --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- you know, car repair, maintenance or whatever --

B.28:  So you've already got it there when you've got the,

A.29:  -- right, and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes, another
twenty dollars would go to, uh, you know, kids toys or something, you know --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- and, uh, so that then, when we want to spend money on clothes or have
the car, you know, serviced or something like that, then we just go to that,
you know, that page on the ledger and say, Okay, you know, we have whatever
saved, like a hundred and twenty dollars for clothes, so we can go spend, you
know, whatever, how, you know, up to a hundred twenty dollars.

B.32:  That's a good idea.

A.33:  Yeah, and that's how we kind of keep track of things, so that when the car
fix-, you know, when the car breaks down or something, you, you have some
money at least, you know, earmarked for that.

B.34:  Yeah --

A.35:  And, and it seems to work.

B.36:  -- [Child_talking] you don't just go overboard spending too much of the
savings on one particular thing.

A.37:  Right, right.

B.38:  That's a good idea.

A.39:  And so, it, you know, it seems,

B.40:  When we have some money, we'll do that [laughter].

A.41:  [Laughter] It seems to work pretty good, you know.  The only part is you
got to keep track of it, you know, every, every month of stuff.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  But that seems to work pretty good.  And, uh, the other things we do is
just, uh, [noise] just try to, uh, just try not to spend a whole lot.  You
know, with some things of course you have to, you know --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- and we try [noise] to, you know, make sure where we go and, uh, try to
catch something on sale or, or something like that.

B.46:  Yeah,

A.47:  But, how about you guys.

B.48:  Well, some, that's there're several things I do to save money.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Um, one is to use garage sales --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- and we do a lot, get a lot of things used, and the things that we do
have, I try and recycle a lot, you know, before I'll get rid of something,
I'll look at it and think, What else can I do with this --

A.53:  Right, uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and, uh, how else can I use this to solve some other problem somewhere
else, you know --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and, uh, that has helped a lot.  Um, and I do shop the sales and buy
more than what we need --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- so that I've got it ahead of time and I don't have to go out and buy it,
something not on sale, because I've already gotten it on sale --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- then when the sale comes around again, go ahead and stock up again.

A.61:  Well, that's a good idea, yeah.

B.62:  Um.

A.63:  Have you gone to any of those places that, uh, you know, like [/noise] uh,
uh, uh, I guess the different names for them are like the Price Club or Sam's
or --

B.64:  Sam's --

A.65:  -- things like that.

B.66:  -- um, [noise] we have a Sam's not too far away, but I haven't, uh, used it
yet.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  They're going to, they're building a new one that's going to be even
closer, and I'm, I'll probably use it when it's over here --

A.69:  That's,

B.70:  -- even a little closer.

A.71:  Yeah, [/noise] I've been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty
good, uh, you know, stretch your money there, because you get the --

B.72:  Yeah --

A.73:  -- the big things, you know.

B.74:  -- you have to buy quantity --

A.75:  Right, right.

B.76:  -- but, um, that's how you save money --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- you know [noise].

A.79:  And uh, [/noise] one of my, I recently got a Master's in computer sys-,
science, or computer systems.  And one of the things I really learned a lot
was, uh, there's a number of programs for the computers, if you happen to have
a personal computer or whatever --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- that a lot of programs that'll help you budget your money, and, uh, it's
kind of really neat, because it does a lot of things for you, as far, it gives
you all your graphs and your charts and stuff, and show you where you're
spending money.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  So, if you're really honest about inputting everything that you spend your
money on, you'd be, you, you're really surprised at like [noise] --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- boy, you know, I spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something,
you know --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- and,

B.88:  Well, I think there's an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we
really don't need --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- and I think since being unemployed, we look, you look at things more
carefully, you know, do I really need this --

A.91:  Uh-huh

B.92:  -- or is it just something I want --  

A.93:  Right, right.

B.94:  -- and you have to decide how much you want, and, and I think, uh, I've
noticed that however much money you have, you can spend that much --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- or more, you know, people, people will go beyond what they have, no
matter what they have.

A.97:  Right.

B.98:  If they use credit cards, that's one thing we're trying, try not to do is
to use the credit cards, because that just runs,

A.99:  Right, that can get you in trouble pretty quick [laughter].

B.100:  Yeah, yeah, if you, and I really like paying cash instead of checks even --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- um [breathing] we got, changed to an economy account at the credit
union, so it costs less to use less checks --

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  -- and, um, those are just little things you can do.

A.105:  Well, that sounds, that sounds pretty good.  Well, do you have anything
else to say, or any other plans that you use?  Uh, I like what you say about
the recycling thing, looking at something before you get rid of it.  That's a
good --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- that's a good thing.  

B.108:  I, uh, having a garage sale yourself, helps [laughter].  We just had one
this last week end [laughter].

A.109:  Oh, did you?

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  Well, we did, we did something like that, too.  We recently moved here from
California, and we had a, there was like a bargain fair, you know, where
everybody brings stuff to sell --

B.112:  Oh, yeah.

A.113:  -- and there really, we made a lot of money, I was surprised, a lot of baby
clothes we sold and stuff that we --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- don't need any more and stuff, but, uh --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- but, uh, I was surprised, yeah, that's a good way to make some money,

B.118:  Yeah, when you can't use it any more --

A.119:  Yeah, that's right.

B.120:  -- that's, uh, I think, uh, learning how to do things yourself a lot helps
too.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  Like I cut everybody's hair myself.

A.123:  Oh, that's good.

B.124:  And if you can, uh, just watch how they do it at the, uh, shop or,
