A.1:  And hello there.  

B.2:  Hi.  

@A.3:  So I guess the question is, do you have any pets.  

B.4:  Yes.  We,  

A.5:  What do you have?  

B.6:  Well, we have a cat.  

A.7:  A cat --

B.8:  Yes.

A.9:  -- named,   

B.10:  Named Bounce.  

A.11:  Bounce?  

B.12:  Actually, it's Bounce the, uh, about third.  

A.13:  Bounce the third, okay.  

B.14:  Yeah, uh, that's because [throat_clearing] when I was little I had a
storybook about a cat named Bounce and --

A.15:  And the name stuck with you.  

B.16:  -- and the cat was, uh, gray and white in particular.  

A.17:  Okay.  

B.18:  Had to be gray and white so, all the Bounces have been gray and white.

A.19:  Very good.  

B.20:  We also have a rabbit.  

A.21:  A rabbit?  

B.22:  Named Coco Bunny.  

A.23:  And I assume that, now, the rabbit doesn't get out, right?  

B.24:  Right. 

A.25:  The rabbit is in --

B.26:  The rabbit is in a cage -- 

A.27:  -- in the cage, okay.  

B.28:  -- outdoors only, year round and this rabbit has been with [laughter] us
for, uh, [lipsmack], oh, six, seven, eight, eight years.

A.29:  Now do you just have one rabbit?  

B.30:  One rabbit [laughter]. 

A.31:  In other words, it never multiplied.  

B.32:  [Laughter] No.  

A.33:  [Laughter] Okay.  

B.34:  That's for sure.  And, uh, that's actually all the pets we have at this
time.

A.35:  Well, I've, I've had -- 

B.36:  How about you?  

A.37:  -- uh, I had three Cocker Spaniels, uh, up until about, uh, four or fi-, I
guess about four years ago and they, they were all very old.  Twelve --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- thirteen, and fourt-, -- 

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- fifteen, and they died.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  And, but I believe the, a child must have a pet to grow up with, so --

B.44:  Right.  

A.45:  -- on my, uh, kid's fourth birthday, his birthday present was a Basset
Hound.

B.46:  Oh [laughter].  

A.47:  Which, as he calls it a basket hound, but -- 

B.48:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  

A.49:  -- that's okay, I guess.  But, uh, anyway. 

B.50:  Cute.

A.51:  So, yes, we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old -- 

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- and in fact, it just had the lovely, uh, yesterday, I got to take the
dog to the veterinarian for his shots.

B.54:  Oh, boy.  

A.55:  That's one of the, uh --

B.56:  D-, 

A.57:  -- to me, one of the things I don't care about having a pet about.

B.58:  Right.  Yeah.  Does he live indoors or out-,  

A.59:  No, he's an outdoor dog.  Uh,  

B.60:  Outdoor, yeah, that's kind of,   

A.61:  He's a very low maintenance dog.  Uh,  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  We actually have a, uh, an automatic feeder -- 

B.64:  Um.  

A.65:  -- and we have an automatic waterer, so he always has plenty of water.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  So I don't have to worry about going out there and, like for example, I'm
going on this two week vacation.

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  He'll be fine.  

B.70:  Ooh, how nice.  

A.71:  No one even has to look after him, although we have a neighbor who's going
to come over, you know, say hello just to --

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  -- keep him happy, but, uh,  

B.74:  He's just in the fenced backyard.  

A.75:  He's in a very well fenced backyard -- 

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and --

B.78:  Well, how nice.  

A.79:  -- chase the kids and he likes that.  

B.80:  Yeah, that sounds like a good situation.  That's about how I would like to
have a dog if I had a dog [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  See, our cat is also, uh, well, outdoors and in the garage.  At one time
she was an,

A.83:  [Sneezing]. 

B.84:  indoor cat and then she started to -- 

A.85:  Claw.  

B.86:  -- do things in the house that I didn't appreciate [laughter]. 

A.87:  Now has it been declawed?  

B.88:  No, no. 

A.89:  No, oh, you should.  

B.90:  Oh. 

A.91:  Have you ever thought of having,  

B.92:  Well, no, because she's outdoors.  

A.93:  Okay, okay.  

B.94:  So, if she's outdoors, I don't want her declawed.  

A.95:  True, true, true.  

B.96:  Uh, but she, uh, she was kind of a feisty little character when she was
little and as she has gotten older, because she's about seven years old,

A.97:  Now my wife would very much like to have a cat.  

B.98:  Would she.  

A.99:  Because she, she grew up with a cat.  

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  Then, uh, the cat lived indoors and the whole bit.  I just don't care for
cats.

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  I don't know what it is about it, but, I guess because,  

B.104:  Well, they're so independent.  

A.105:  Yes, they are.  

B.106:  A lot of people don't.  I,  

A.107:  You can't say, come here.  I mean it just doesn't, you know, 

B.108:  That's true [laughter].  It could just stand there and stare at you in a
strange way.  In fact, my cat right now is just rubbing up against the, the
wood,

A.109:  [Sneezing]. 

B.110:  on the door here with a look of, don't you want to feed me or to pick me
up and love me.  Yes, you sweet thing {speaking to cat}.

A.111:  Well, we have a humongous, uh,

B.112:  [Laughter]. 

A.113:  our back, what do you call it, the, uh, living room has nothing but one
big window after another --

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  -- so it's all windows -- 

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  -- and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and
the dog, you know, he's, he, he knows when we're in the room --

B.118:  Uh-huh.  

A.119:  -- because when we're in the room and just walking down the hallway, not,
he'll come and, and look at us, you know.  We'll wave at him and he'll come
back to you, you know.

B.120:  [Laughter]. 

A.121:  [Laughter]. 

B.122:  So he is sociable.  

A.123:  Yes, he is.  

B.124:  Even though he, 

A.125:  He's ver-, most loving dog -- 

B.126:  Even though he's outdoors, yeah.  

A.127:  -- you've ever had.  I can't, I can't, really, I cannot imagine not having
a dog.

B.128:  Yeah.  My boys and, uh, my husband have been talking recently about having
a dog, but we don't have a, a fenced in backyard and we don't want a fenced in
backyard.  We're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park.  And we
just, you know, one --

A.129:  Well, what you have -- 

B.130:  -- reason we,  

A.131:  -- to do is have an indoor dog.  

B.132:  Yeah.  I guess it would have to be.  And we,  

A.133:  And they can be very nice, too.  

B.134:  Yeah.  That's true.  

A.135:  Aft-, after they've been trained.  

B.136:  Yeah, well, that's right.  

A.137:  And they do require a lot of training.  

B.138:  Yeah, [breathing] yeah.  That's for sure.  

A.139:  Now, my dog, he, we've got him trained that we could bring him inside, but
once we bought the new house --

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  -- my wife said uh-huh.  No, no. 

B.142:  [Laughter]. 

A.143:  He's not coming inside this house so,

B.144:  Well, pets, pets really are hard on houses.  I mean, there's just no doubt
about that.  We've, my husband was in really estate for a while and, you know,
he had more problems over pets, uh, in both rental houses and houses that
people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled
and --

A.145:  Uh-huh.   

B.146:  -- so, so that's my main -- 

A.147:  And they do get the carpet -- 

B.148:  -- objection.  

A.149:  -- uh, [laughter] soiled.  

B.150:  Yeah.  

A.151:  So,  

B.152:  I mean e-, even the best trained --

A.153:  Yes.

B.154:  -- one, you know, is going to have problems from time to time and you just
can't really get that, that smell out and, 

A.155:  Well, I tell you what, I've got some, uh, carpet, uh, cleaner that, uh, you
know, it's some type of dog smell away.

B.156:  Uh-huh.  

A.157:  It works wonderful.  It really, really does.  

B.158:  Oh, that's good.  When we moved into this house, both dogs and cats had
been in it and, uh, we did not realize that there was a problem.  And after we
moved in it was so bad that we had to go ahead and, uh, recarpet the entire
house.

A.159:  Oh. 

B.160:  And when they pulled the carpeting up, it was so bad on the back.

A.161:  [Laughter]. 

B.162:  There were so many spots, you just wouldn't believe.  And, uh, they, we had
to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete
slab --

A.163:  Oh, come on.  

B.164:  -- and they had to wear, you know, gas masks and stuff, so we moved
everything from one half of the house to the other half and, you know, then --

A.165:  Now, this -- 

B.166:  -- just took -- 

A.167:  -- is from a cat or a dog?  

B.168:  -- took that, well, actually both.  

A.169:  Okay.  

B.170:  The, uh, took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that.  And we
had to stay out of the house for, you know, ten hours or something and then we
came back and then they put the new carpet down there, moved the furniture
back to that half of the house [laughter] and h-, --

A.171:  Because yes, dogs need training -- 

B.172:  -- had to do it again.  

A.173:  -- but cats usually don't even need any training.  

B.174:  Yeah.  

A.175:  Seem like they --

B.176:  No, they usually don't.

A.177:  -- automatically go to the little litter box.  

B.178:  Well, 

A.179:  They think, you know,  

B.180:  Well, so anyway, we've had that.  That was very bad experience [laughter].
So, I don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets.

A.181:  Well, in fact, if we're getting ready to go on our vacation, my little six
year old, now he's saying, we need to buy a mother dog to take care of, uh,
Copper while we're gone.

B.182:  [Laughter]. 

A.183:  I said, you don't buy mother dogs, you buy little puppies [laughter].

B.184:  [Laughter] So they'd have company, right.  

A.185:  And, and my wife's saying uh-huh, no [laughter].  

B.186:  Well, it really is fun to have two pets together.  

A.187:  Well, we had three at one time.  

B.188:  Uh-huh.  

A.189:  We had three -- 

B.190:  Yeah.  

A.191:  -- in the backyard all at one time.  And they played.

B.192:  Yeah.  

A.193:  And they also humped on each other all the time, but, you know they,

B.194:  Yeah.  But they must really have fun together.  

A.195:  Oh, they do.  

B.196:  It's, it's cute to see s-, several at a time like that.  

A.197:  Although I'll tell you what.  It really would scare me like now in the
summer, when, this hot, uh --

B.198:  Oh, yeah.  

A.199:  -- when they're playing that hard, I, you know, it's, I'm not sure if that
was that good for them or not.

B.200:  Uh-huh.  

A.201:  But our dog does have plenty of company.  Let me, because of the, uh, we
have a --

B.202:  Kids.  

A.203:  -- the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside.

B.204:  Uh-huh.  

A.205:  And he is constantly chasing the kids and,  

B.206:  [Laughter]. 

A.207:  People walk in our neighborhood, he's always, and we're on the corner, too,
so, you know --

B.208:  Uh-huh.  

A.209:  -- he has a lot of traffic going by,
