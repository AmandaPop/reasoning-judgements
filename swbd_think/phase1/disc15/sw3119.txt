==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Do you have, you, there's a recycle center in Plano isn't there?

B.2:  Yes, we're doing several different things, uh, and I haven't kept up to
date on what's happen lately, but they have, uh, the igloos around and they
have various places for different kinds of recycling.

A.3:  Oh, really?  

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  That would be neat.  

B.6:  And, uh, uh, I understand in the future we're supposed to, uh, begin a
curbside pick up as well --

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- but that hasn't started yet.  

A.9:  That I would love.  I wish Carrollton would do that.  

B.10:  How about you?  

A.11:  Well, I, I fortunately live, live pr-, pretty close to the Wal-Mart and
there's a pretty good size recycle center behind the Wal-Mart so it's
convenient for me to do it, but curbside would be much more convenient.

B.12:  Curbside would be wonderful, I'm ready [laughter].  

A.13:  Yes, I know.  

B.14:  Uh, they're also doing, uh, a, a recyclable bags to put the grass clippings
in.

A.15:  Oh, really?  

B.16:  Uh-huh, so that you, th-, you can't put them in plastic anymore.

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  And, uh, so that seems to be helping a little bit, too.  

A.19:  Yeah.  My husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the re-, or the
mulching mowers so that they don't, they don't bag anything anymore.

B.20:  Oh. 

A.21:  So, it was, I, I know it cut down on his work load, [laughter] but it's
also being helpful [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter].  That would be great.  H-, I, I am not sure how a mulching
mower works.  Does it just chop it up finely, or what?

A.23:  Yeah, it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it
up so fine that, you know, it really is, what, from what I understand helpful
to the grass and then plus, you don't have the big bags of, of grass every
time.

B.24:  And you don't see the clippings lying around, then.  

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  Huh.  

A.27:  Yeah, so,  

B.28:  Well, now do you recycle plastics also?  

A.29:  Yeah, we have plast-, at this center we have plastic, glass, aluminum and
newspapers.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  But, uh, the, I noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or
paper company and they buy like your office paper that you, if you,

B.32:  I've heard that, that's, uh, something that can be started.  

A.33:  Yeah.  And so I've started that in my office, but it's kind of.  It's not
as convenient because they want you to have a certain amount before you'll
take it to them.

B.34:  Oh, is that right.  

A.35:  And I don't really care if I get paid for it, I just don't want it
[laughter], 

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  you know, I just want it out of my office and I don't want to waste it.

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  But I was reading in a magazine the other day and I hadn't even thought
about doing this that, uh, a lady, mainly for cost cutting reasons, has sent
out a memo to everybody in her company that says, if you're sending out
interoffice memos, it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already
been used.

B.40:  Oh, that's a good idea.  

A.41:  Yeah, and I hadn't thought about that [laughter] so I'm going to make
everybody start do it that.

B.42:  That's great.  

A.43:  They think I'm nuts [laughter].  

B.44:  [Laughter] Well, no, you've got to do that.  

A.45:  Well, I know.  I mean I showed them the brochure that the city sent out
that, you know, explained how many, if you recycle this many cans, this much
power is saved and all this stuff, so I think they're beginning to get a
little more aware of it, but, uh, they, uh, they laughed at me and brought me
Greenpeace stickers and [laughter], 

B.46:  Oh, how funny.  Well, old har-, habits die hard they say.  

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  And, and it's the whole issue of conservation and everything is, I, you
know, I, I talk about it all the time with my kids, I'm a teacher --

A.49:  Oh. 

B.50:  -- and I, we talk about it a lot and yet, uh, there are often times I find
myself doing, you know, throw-, going ahead and throwing a way a plastic
bottle, instead of, you know, separating it and so forth.  I, and I just
forget, so,

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  It's a, it's a effort on everybody's part, I think, to begin to do this --

A.53:  It really is.  

B.54:  -- keep it up.  

A.55:  I've gotten my husband kind of trained now because it's real funny because
I would pull a jar out and rinse it out to put it in the glass and he'd throw
it away.

B.56:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.57:  [Laughter] And I'd say, you know, I had that out for a reason [laughter].
But he's learning now, too, so --

B.58:  Oh, good.  

A.59:  -- it was kind of difficult, but, you know, I don't, I don't have any kids,
yet and that's what they kept stressing in a lot of the brochures is if your
kids are going to, you know, be able to survive at all without having mounds
of trash around --

B.60:  That's right.

A.61:  -- everybody's got to start doing this.  

B.62:  That's right.  And my kids help a lot.  My son, uh, tried to, or helped
build a, a little recycling center for us here --

A.63:  Oh, that's good.  

B.64:  -- at the house, you know, put, to put the cans in and the papers and, uh,
plastic and so forth, so we have a little place that he built out in the
garage.

A.65:  Well, that's neat.  

B.66:  Uh, so until we get curbside service, we cart it all over --

A.67:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.68:  -- everywhere, somehow, but, they're real good about it, uh, they're real
responsible, much better than I am really about, uh, sorting things out, 
so, 

A.69:  Huh.  

B.70:  So they've done a real good job.  

A.71:  Yeah.  Well, I'm real anxious to get a little more implemented into my
office.  I've got the aluminum cans out, and I've got the newspapers where
ever-, everybody's pretty much aware of that because they get yelled at if
they throw their, uh,

B.72:  [Laughter]. 

A.73:  But, now what I'm going to do with this recycled office paper is, uh, just
get separate trash cans and tell them to put their trash in this one and the
paper that can be recycled in that one and hopefully, hopefully [laughter]
they'll go along with it.

B.74:  Oh, that's great.  

A.75:  So,  

B.76:  And you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through,
can't you.

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  So, I don't know, we'll see, but, uh, that lady said she was real surprised
that she did get a lot of protests at first, but she said it's cut down on
their office expenses a lot and,

B.80:  Uh-huh, I bet.  

A.81:  It's just recycling.  So --

B.82:  Huh.

A.83:  -- anyway, we'll see.  

B.84:  Well, we just need to do more and more [laughter].  

A.85:  Yeah, but I mean, I guess there's only so much that they can do as far as
re-, as advanced stuff now, but, something else that I'd really like to get
into more and I haven't is the, like the Downy softener products and stuff
that you just buy the concentrate.

B.86:  Right.  

A.87:  I wish they'd get more into that.  

B.88:  More people doing that, yeah.  

A.89:  Yeah.  And even just the companies coming out with more things like that.

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  So, I don't know.  I know a lot of companies are real dedicated to it.  I
just got a brochure from my insurance company the other day and the whole
thing was made on recycled paper and then something I hadn't heard of is they,
the ink was produced with s-, with, a soy based oils --

B.92:  Is that right? 

A.93:  -- instead of, instead of petroleum --

B.94:  Huh.

A.95:  -- because they said it was less toxic.  And I had never heard of that
[laughter].

B.96:  I've never heard of that either.  

A.97:  But, I mean they made a big deal to let everybody know that whole brochure
was recycled and can be recycled again.

B.98:  Interesting.  

A.99:  Yeah, it really was.  

B.100:  Well, and that, the other issue is disposable diapers.  

A.101:  Oh, yeah.  

B.102:  Uh, and I, I guess some companies are beginning to do some things, uh, to
where part of the diaper can be recycled, or degraded --

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  -- uh, but did an interesting thing in my classroom in calculating the
number of diapers that were used for my class of kids --

A.105:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.106:  -- just in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers.
And, uh, the kids were just astounded.

A.107:  Yeah.  

B.108:  And then we calculated according to the number of kids in the school and
that kind of thing and,

A.109:  Wow.  

B.110:  But, so, that, you know, that's a real eye-opening, uh, activity to do,
because you, you begin to think of the [noise] [laughter] thousands and
millions and --

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  -- billions --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- of diapers that are still there.  

A.115:  Oh, well, 

B.116:  Oh, it, that's incredible.  

A.117:  One of my girlfriends recently had a baby and she does about half and half.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  She uses the cloth diapers at home, but she said when you're traveling it's
just almost impossible.

B.120:  That's right.  

A.121:  So she says she feels like she's doing her part some because she's not
using them all the time.

B.122:  Yeah.  

A.123:  But, yeah, that's something I kind of been thinking about because we
haven't had children and I thought oh, God [laughter].

B.124:  The whole idea!  Oh, and I, you know, I, with my first, I was all gung ho,
well we're going to do cloth and everything, and then part way through, I, I
just [laughter],

A.125:  [Laughter].
