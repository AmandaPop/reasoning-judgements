============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, I, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party I, depending on
the number of people, I might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a
chicken dish --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and, um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato
dish, and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.

B.4:  Oh, that sounds good.

A.5:  So that makes,

B.6:  Uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.  Last time I had people over
for dinner we had lasagna, and I used my mother's recipe, I really like it.
It's got, um, you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put
tomato sauce in with it and, I'm not sure she even puts, must be some Italian
spices in there.  I can't remember.  But, um, for the cheese part, you mix,
uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese --

A.7:  Well, that sounds good.

B.8:  -- and, uh, layer all that.  It's good.

A.9:  That sounds good.

B.10:  And, then, uh, uh, tossed salad and, and, um, {to someone in the room} Oh,
my goodness, Diane, get down from there.  {back to phone} And, uh, let's see,
what else did I serve with that.

A.11:  Bread, do you have bread to go with it?

B.12:  Corn, yeah, I made French bread with that one too.

A.13:  Gosh.

B.14:  I have a recipe that's [dishes] pretty good for that [noise].  So.

A.15:  Oh, well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on
the cooking for lasagna, they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a
great big pan of lasagna.

B.18:  I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna --

A.19:  So.

B.20:  -- in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once.

A.21:  Did you?

B.22:  It was good.

A.23:  Well, I, I know people that have, have served it and they say, gosh, if you
have company coming --

B.24:  Easy [laughter].

A.25:  -- when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy, and she said
it's, they said it's good.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  So, that, that's always sounds good to me, um,

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  I feel like, I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot. 

B.30:  Oh, I know.

A.31:  I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always
for company, just for, just for family.

B.32:  Oh, yeah.

A.33:  So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.

B.34:  Not my favorite place, but.

A.35:  But a time consuming place.

B.36:  A necessity [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah, right, right, so.

B.38:  Let's see, what else do we like to have for, trying to think what else I
like to serve.  My mother likes to serve taco grandes.  Have you #ever had,#

A.39:  #I don't know,#

B.40:  #that?#

A.41:  #what# that is.  No I don't know what that is.

B.42:  You take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco --

A.43:  Okay.

B.44:  -- shell --

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  -- and you, uh, for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some,
um, tomato sauce in it, and, and I like to just add picante sauce to get the
Mexican flavor so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  And, then, um, let's see, and then, and you heat up refried beans, and you
cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese, and what you do to make it, you
take the shell and you spread the beans on first, then you put the meat, then
you put the grated cheese, and then you put, um, let's see, what's next, then,
and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next --

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  -- and then the, um, lettuce, and you can put, uh, like guacamole and {to
someone in the room} Katy, I'm on the phone.  Well, get a towel or go change.
I'm on the phone.  {Back to phone}.  Um, oh a little sour cream is good --

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  -- and, and chopped olives,

A.53:  Right.  Do you like to make your own guacamole?  

B.54:  Uh, yeah.

A.55:  Yeah, we, we don't make it very often, I guess, but, uh,

B.56:  No, I don't very often.  Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to
eat them plain --

A.57:  Oh do they?

B.58:  -- so.  Yeah.  

A.59:  Gosh,

B.60:  I just cut slices off and.

A.61:  Gosh,

B.62:  I like an avocado sandwich, too.

A.63:  Oh, that's good, that's good, or it's always good on top of something in
the sandwich.

B.64:  Yeah, yeah.

A.65:  Oh, well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party
across the street the other day, and, and everyone there said they never made
guacamole salad.

B.66:  {Spoken off phone}.  What you want.  {Back to phone} wh-, where do they get
it?  [Laughter].

A.67:  Well, I don't know, I guess they don't have it at home,

B.68:  I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to, I guess they just buy
it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.

A.69:  They must, they just said they never had it at home.  So I, I was concerned
that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought,
gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the 
top --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- so quickly, so I just,

B.72:  It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.

A.73:  Oh, does that help?

B.74:  Yeah, if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while
you're waiting before you serve it.

A.75:  Okay, well,

B.76:  That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.

A.77:  Well, I'll have to remember that.  Well, I just, I, that day I just took
extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than
I --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- ever thought it would, so.

B.80:  Oh, that's good.

A.81:  I thought maybe that was the trick.

B.82:  That probably helps, too.

A.83:  Yeah, yeah, so.  Oh, well.  I guess we bought a lot of, we've been buying
turkey lately, instead of beef, so --

B.84:  {Off phone} Do you want it?

A.85:  -- even though, you know, 

B.86:  #Oh, yeah we have too,#

A.87:  #the ground turkey,# it's, the meat is softer and I, everybody --

B.88:  {Off phone}  Do you want scrambled?

A.89:  -- seems to like it.  So.  Sometimes it seems to be cheaper, too, so we --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- often buy it --

B.92:  Yeah --

A.93:  -- we buy it,

B.94:  -- if you get it on sale,

A.95:  Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the, the filets, and then the
chicken, or turkey nuggets, and I don't think anybody in my house knows the
difference,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  unless you tell them.

B.98:  Yeah, yeah --

A.99:  Or in,

B.100:  -- I don't think mine know either.  In fact, we've been getting lunch meat
that's turkey, too.  It costs less than the other, I don't know, there's
supposed to be something more healthy about it [laughter].

A.101:  Yeah, yeah.

B.102:  Poultry instead of the beef and --

A.103:  Less cho-, less cholesterol.

B.104:  -- pork, yeah [laughter].

A.105:  Yeah, right, right.  Well, I guess that's probably all we need to do for
tonight.

B.106:  Yeah, I, I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve.  Um,

A.107:  I always like dessert [laughter].

B.108:  One salad that we always like, my sister-in-law always brings to family
dinners, is a, I don't know what you call it.  Uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese
and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like Cool Whip --

A.109:  Right, right --

B.110:  -- that's good --

A.111:  -- that's always good,

B.112:  -- and quick and easy,

A.113:  Probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make and it's really
for special occasions is cheese cake, and we take a recipe from my
grandmother, you know --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- it's probably fairly typical, cream cheese and egg and sugar, and the
insides of a,
