REMARKS:        Speakers sounded very much alike and at times, I had
trouble discerning them.

========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so, uh, during the summertime do you dress differently than, than you
would when school's going on?

B.2:  [Throat_clearing] Uh, a little bit.  During the school year we're, uh,
definitely expected to wear hosiery and, you know, things like that.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  Although we can wear slacks.  

A.5:  Oh, really.  

B.6:  Uh, during, during the school year.  And, of course, that's a good idea
because I do sit on very low chairs to read stories --

A.7:  Oh, yeah.  

B.8:  -- to kindergartners and, you know, so it's pretty important to, uh, I also
like very much the new split skirts.

A.9:  Oh, yeah.  

B.10:  You know, because then you,  

A.11:  But those aren't that new.  I mean I have some that were way old
[laughter].

B.12:  Oh that's, oh, that's true, the old culottes.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  That's right.  But those are just real comfortable and, uh, you know, allow
you the privacy and all [laughter].

A.15:  Oh, yeah, yeah, they're very nice.

B.16:  The only, 

A.17:  Do you, can you get away with wearing the shorter one, style, the ones that
really look like shorts, kind of?

B.18:  Uh, no, I think it needs to be longer probably -- 

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- if it's split.  It, it varies, though, between the princ-, from one
principal to another.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  There are some, like, uh, some principals insist that you not wear, uh,
anklet type shorts.

A.23:  Uh. 

B.24:  I mean socks.  

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  Uh, that you have to wear h-, you know, hose.  

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  But I know of other schools where they wear, uh -- 

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- you know, anklets and,   

A.31:  Well, my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses, I, when I
dress to go to work, my dresses are pretty long --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- and, uh, 

B.34:  [Throat_clearing].

A.35:  I couldn't find any hose one day, but I found some knee-highs so I put
those on --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- and the wind caught my skirt and he said, when have you got on
[laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] How embarrassing.

A.39:  Yeah, it was real funny.

B.40:  I know, I hate that.  You really, really have to check on the, [laughter]
check on the length.  Well, we wear the knee-high ones a lot, too, so
[laughter],

A.41:  Yeah.  It's pretty comfortable.  I had never done that and I just, I could
not find any hose anywhere so,

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  The one day that I did it and I got caught.   

B.44:  Do you wear, uh, suits very much?  

A.45:  Uh, no, I really don't.  My, I work for a computer company, but it's not,
uh, real visual.  I mean it's not like an I B M where you have to --

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- wear your blue suit.  

B.48:  Yeah, right.  

A.49:  But, uh, I can get away with wearing dresses a lot which I really enjoy --

B.50:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.51:  -- because especially, I mean, you know, it's nice sometimes in, in a suit
because if you're hot inside or cold, or you know, whatever, you have your
jacket, but --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- uh, I'm more comfortable in a dress.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  So, but,  

B.56:  I am, too, and I,  

A.57:  The best thing, are you from Texas?  

B.58:  Uh, I've been here seventeen years.  

A.59:  Oh, well you qualify [laughter]. 

B.60:  But I'm from, [laughter] but I'm from Illinois.  

A.61:  Oh, well, see that's what's so funny because so many girls move down here
from the north that they have these heavy wool suits and it's like, God, what
do I do with that [laughter].

B.62:  That's right, that's right.

A.63:  I say, well that's the best part about Texas.  You can buy one dress that
you can wear pretty much all through unless, like, it's the --

B.64:  That's right.  

A.65:  -- two cold months and -- 

B.66:  Right.  

A.67:  -- it's December.  

B.68:  That really is nice.  I, uh, I'm kind of a pack rat especially when it
comes to clothes [laughter].

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  And I, I mean, I still have some sweaters that I had, you know, from before
I moved down here --

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  -- things that were, were wool, or just, you know, really nice things and,
and really very seldom get to wear them --

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- and should certainly get rid of probably all of them [laughter],

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  but, like I said, I'm kind of a,  

A.77:  Yeah, but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale
[laughter].

B.78:  Yeah, that's, that's really true, because who would want it down here.

A.79:  Really.  

B.80:  But, anyway.  

A.81:  Huh.  

B.82:  They, they still sit around in drawers and boxes and I, I get them out at
the beginning of the winter --

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  -- out of a box and put them in my drawer and then at the end of the winter
I take it out of the drawer and put it back in the box,

A.85:  [Laughter]. 

B.86:  and sometimes I never wore it [laughter].  Now that is silly, isn't it.

A.87:  Well, that's really weird because last winter I bought my first cardigan
that I ever remember buying, and I only got to wear it like twice --

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  -- all winter long, so,

B.90:  Are you from here, then?  

A.91:  Well, yeah, Oklahoma -- 

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- and Texas, so, I mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter, but, uh, I
guess I just didn't notice it because I never really dressed very warm so,

B.94:  Well, the thing is that, you know, it does get cold, but it's just such a
short season.

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  You know, and you just --

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  -- can't wear that much.  

A.99:  Well, and I found a new dressmaker, so, that I just am crazy about the
style of the dresses, so --

B.100:  Oh, how nice.  

A.101:  -- I've been, yeah, I mean, I go into every store and I go, Do you have
Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like I'm strange, but
[laughter],

B.102:  Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit.  

A.103:  It's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit, and they are the neatest dresses.  They
just are very flattering to your figure and --

B.104:  Huh.  

A.105:  -- uh,  

B.106:  Where have you found them?  

A.107:  Uh, I've been fortunate.  I've found them in, in a catalog and they're a
lot cheaper than you can find them at Dillard's.

B.108:  Uh-huh.  

A.109:  So, uh,  

B.110:  But they carry them at Dillard's?  

A.111:  Yeah, they do have them at Dillard's -- 

B.112:  Huh.  

A.113:  -- and,  

B.114:  I'll have to look at those.  That sounds interesting.  

A.115:  Yeah, I really enjoy them.  I've, I've, and it's really funny, too because
I've had a lot of compliments --

B.116:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.117:  -- on them when I wear them, so,  

B.118:  Well, you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and I -- 

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  -- I really do, too.  I just, I don't know, I'm really comfortable in,

A.121:  Well, I'm short, and I've been told that if you wear the longer skirt, it
gives y-, it gives you more of an elongated look.

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  So, uh, I've always been more comfortable in the longer ones. 

B.124:  Uh-huh.  I like that, too.  

A.125:  Yeah, so.  My husband's kind of whiny.  He says, well I like the shorter
ones [laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter]. 

A.127:  And I'm like, well, yeah, you don't have to sit with your legs crossed all
day long [laughter].

B.128:  That's exactly right [laughter].  

A.129:  So,  

B.130:  Oh, well [laughter].  

A.131:  But, anyway, but I don't have any play clothes because I spend all my money
on clothes that I wear to work --

B.132:  For work [noise].  

A.133:  -- so on the weekends and,  

B.134:  Well, you work year round, right?  

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  Yeah.  

A.137:  But it's just kind of frustrating because on the weekends you want to go
out to play and you don't have any play clothes.

B.138:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.139:  So, I need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts,
I think, where then, that way, I could at least wear the shirts on the
weekends.

B.140:  Uh-huh, that's true.  

A.141:  Put them with my shorts or something.

B.142:  Yeah, that's true.  Well, I have more summer stuff, I guess for that kind
of casual because we do go on a [throat_clearing], uh, I go back to Illinois
and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my
husband's --

A.143:  Um.  

B.144:  -- mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there 
so,

A.145:  Yeah.  

B.146:  Uh, in fact, I was thinking this summer that since I'm doing summer school,
I haven't worn har-, very many of those things, but I was thinking, oh, well,
I got to get them all together, so, to take them on our trip.

A.147:  Yeah.  Well, I've lost weight recently, so I'm now getting to dig out the
things I haven't worn --

B.148:  Oh, how nice!  [Laughter]. 

A.149:  -- for a while, so that's kind of fun [laughter].  

B.150:  I took, I went through my closet this spring and I, I took some stuff out
and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because I'm so tired of
looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight [laughter].

A.151:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.152:  But it isn't so much too tight, I mean, I could easily, well, maybe not too
easily,

A.153:  [Laughter]. 

B.154:  but I could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and, you
know, and there are things that I really don't want to get rid of.

A.155:  Yeah.  

B.156:  You know, I really want to keep them -- 

A.157:  Uh-huh.  

B.158:  -- because they're nice and so I thought, well, I'll put them in there and
then maybe I'll feel so bad that I can't wear them now,

A.159:  [Laughter]. 

B.160:  and I'll do something about it [laughter].  But, so far [laughter],

A.161:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, that's something my husband says, what are we
going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of
those, because, 

B.162:  [Laughter]. 

A.163:  I, I have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and, it's like,
what are we going to do?

B.164:  Oh, that's funny.

A.165:  Said well, we'll have to get a bigger house [laughter].  

B.166:  Yeah, that's right [laughter].  Hey, when you have kids, you definitely
have to have,

A.167:  Oh, I know, and then, well my sisters have had their children, and so now
they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me, and I'm
like, well, what am I going to do with all this stuff [laughter].

B.168:  [Laughter]. 

A.169:  I don't think it will fit my dog [laughter].  

B.170:  You think they're hinting?  [Laughter].  

A.171:  Yeah, they definitely are.  But it will be nice if we ever do have kids --

B.172:  Yeah, that's true.  

A.173:  -- because then I've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a
boy and a girl.

B.174:  Ooh.  

A.175:  So that worked out.  

B.176:  Yeah, you'll be glad, believe me.  

A.177:  Yeah, I'm sure I will be because, God, I was, in was in Foley's the other
day and I turned the wrong direction and I ended up in the little kids'
clothes --

B.178:  Uh-huh.  

A.179:  -- and I just picked up something for my niece and it was just, it was like
thirty bucks [laughter].

B.180:  Oh. 

A.181:  I thought, golly.  

B.182:  It's just unreal.  The time, though, that it really gets the worst is, uh,
is when the kids get old enough that they really care what they're wearing.

A.183:  Oh, yeah, I can imagine.  

B.184:  My kids are twelve and fifteen.  

A.185:  Oh. 

B.186:  And, uh, you know, they're both boys, so they're probably not as picky as
if they were,

A.187:  [Laughter]. 

B.188:  girls, but on the other hand [laughter] --

A.189:  Yeah.  

B.190:  -- they can be pretty picky and, you know, I mean, I could get away with
[breathing], you know, with it not costing nearly as much --

A.191:  Uh-huh.  

B.192:  -- you know, when they were littler, because they didn't care [laughter].

A.193:  Yeah, definitely.  

B.194:  Anything was fine, but, you know, now it has to be a certain kind of, 

A.195:  [Laughter]. 

B.196:  certain kind of jeans and the, the shoes are just about the worst.

A.197:  Oh, God. 

B.198:  Oh!

A.199:  Yeah, I can imagine.  

B.200:  Jeez.  I'm, my son just came out the other day and he's, his what is it, I
think they're Reebok,

A.201:  Uh-huh.

B.202:  Whatever, my other son has Nike Airs at the moment -- 

A.203:  Oh. 

B.204:  -- but these Reeboks [throat_clearing], and I was thinking he bought them
in March.  It was early March he bought them and they are demolished.

A.205:  [Laughter]. 

B.206:  I mean, they are absolutely demolished.  There are pieces hanging off of
them.

A.207:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.208:  The inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out.  

A.209:  [Laughter]. 

B.210:  I mean, that's how worn out they are.  And they c-, I bought them on a
wonderful sale at Mervyn's --

A.211:  Uh-huh.  

B.212:  -- they must have been thirty-five or so percent off --

A.213:  Wow.

B.214:  -- they cost sixty dollars.  

A.215:  On sale?  

B.216:  On that much of a sale.  

A.217:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.218:  And my husband and [laughter] I were just talking, you know, it's, I mean,
we're talking minimum of three of those a year.

A.219:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.220:  That's a hundred and eighty dollars a year,

A.221:  [Laughter]. 

B.222:  for his tennis shoes.  

A.223:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.224:  You know, and my husband,  

A.225:  Maybe I won't have kids [laughter].  

B.226:  [Laughter] Oh, it's just awful!  And my husband bought, I mean this year
he bought a pair of, of really good, you know, work, leather, nice, men's
dress shoes --

A.227:  Uh-huh.  

B.228:  -- and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or -- 

A.229:  Wow.  

B.230:  -- you know, something like that.  And, you know, he said, I felt terrible
spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes.  He said, but I'll still
be wearing them in ten years [laughter].

A.231:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.232:  And, and he's, I mean, we're talking a, just a piece of rag. 

A.233:  Oh, no.  

B.234:  So, anyway -- 

A.235:  I just can't imagine. 

B.236:  -- before we go visit grandma [laughter],  

A.237:  Yeah, really.  Well, my mother had three girls, but I don't remember being
that picky about my clothes.
