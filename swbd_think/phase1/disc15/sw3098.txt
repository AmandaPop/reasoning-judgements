A.1:  Hi, Maureen.

B.2:  Hi.

A.3:  Uh, we are supposed to be talking about children and spending time with
them today.  Neither one of us have any children, but it might be interesting
if we talked about what we thought we would do if we had children, or perhaps,
you know, what some of our friends do and what we approve or do not approve
of.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  Uh, do you have nieces and nephews or anything?

B.6:  No, unfortunately, my husband and I are both only children.  Now we do have
like some cousins that are, we are kind of close to and sometimes we see the
cousins children.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  You know, that's going to be the closest nieces and nephews that we can
come up with, is our cousins kids [inhaling].  They do not live close to us
but, uh, uh, as a matter of fact, we were going to ask, uh, his one cousin to
try to make plans to have her kids come, maybe visit this way for a few days.
And, of course, you know, things sometime you get to be the, uh, the tourist
folks and we will take them to Six Flags, take them to Wet N Wild.  I mean
they may not be real quality time [laughter] but, 

A.9:  It will be fun though. 

B.10:  Yeah, it will be a real treat for them.  You know, to kind of come and do
that because they live in East Texas, so they will be something real out of
the norm.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And I used to, uh, used to have a neighbor in one apartment complex I lived
in and she had, [inhaling] at the time, her kids were like eleven and nine and
five.  And I used to spend a lot of time with her and her kids.  We used to go
to the pool all the time, it was an apartment complex, so we used to the pool
and, you know, just kind of play around and do, uh, water games and, you know,
uh, have picnics out there, that kind of stuff.  That was our normal thing.
We also, uh, she had gotten one of those, uh, laser disc players,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  and we used to get, uh, some movies, which is kind of hard with kids
sometimes to, you know, [inhaling] get some movies that are enjoyable for the
kids and not always a strict Disney thing.

A.15:  I'm sure.

B.16:  You know, when you get eleven and nine year olds, they want something a
little more active than a cartoon.

A.17:  Try MILO AND OTIS.

B.18:  MILO AND OTIS, what,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Is that with the animals, like the dogs?

A.21:  The dog and the cat.

B.22:  [Inhaling] I have seen bits of that like on, uh, cable or something
picked it up,

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I think somebody was showing it recently.

A.25:  It's really good, my husband and I rented it and, as a matter of fact, we
kind of like shows like BAMBI and everything.  Sometimes we will go to this
theater and we are the only adults, you know,

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  and we spend money [laughter].  But, MILO AND OTIS is good and I think
any, the whole family would enjoy that.

B.28:  Um, that sounds cute.  Well, we had one silly movie that we used to watch a
lot, cause, they were kind of expensive when she got that player, uh, we did
not have too many movies.  We used to watch AIRPLANE over and over and over
again.  I mean, have you ever seen that movie?

A.29:  Yes.

B.30:  It's real silly.

A.31:  Yes.

B.32:  But, um, in the, it's fairly clean, there was only one little section of it
that they probably edited for T V [inhaling].  But, uh, we used to watch that
a lot, I mean that was just real kind of flap stick kind of fun stuff.  We
used to watch that with her kids.

A.33:  Probably some of that went over their heads anyway,

B.34:  Some [breathing],

A.35:  you know [laughter].

B.36:  [Laughter] You know, there, uh, her kids I remember one summer cried all
summer long they wanted to go to Six Flags.  You know, and they see these ads
on TV.  uh, Six Flags looks wonderful.  And we took them there and then they
were too scared to get on the rides [laughter].

A.37:  Oh, so you got to walk around and watch everything.

B.38:  [Laughter] They would not get on any of the rides even if they were, you
know, tall enough, they did not want to get on any rides {speaking in a high
pitch voice}.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  And they cried all summer long, {speaking in a high pitch voice} when are
you going to take us to Six Flags, I want to go to Six Flags.

A.41:  [/Laughter].

B.42:  ((Then)) they kind of chickened out [laughter].

A.43:  Well I was noticing, I have, [swallowing] my husband has a nephew --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and, uh, I, I would say that his mother is probably like one of the
perfect mothers, she, it's just one of those kind of deals, she spends a lot
of time with him, she listens to the what he has to say, [inhaling] and he is
turning out, he is thirteen, he is turning out to be a really good kid.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And I think, uh, whatever she has done, you know, she has done it right.
But I think it takes and awful lot of time and effort to raise kids, too.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  You know, I watch our neighbors, and everything they do is child related.
Uh, it's

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  like their whole,

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  social lives kind of flow around where,

B.54:  Uh.

A.55:  they are taking the kids and what they are doing with the kids.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Um, which may be part of the reason we never had kids [laughter]. 

B.58:  Oh, (( )).

A.59:  [/Laughter] That they are time consuming I, it appears to me.

B.60:  Well, you know, one thing that, that, you know, I kind of say, we have only
been married a couple of years, but, um, you know, I think so many times in
the past, you know, like even forty, fifty years ago, I mean it was just
expected or kind of pushed upon people, you get married and you have kids.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Whether or not there was something inside you really wanted to do.  And I,
I like it now that people make the decision, you know, okay, I am going to be
married and then yes or no whether I have children.  It's not so much a (( ))
society dictating to you, do this, you know, it's everybody is supposed to get
married and have kids.  If you do not want kids, fine, do not have them.

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  People are beginning to, where they do not ((view you as)) such a social
pariah anymore.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  But, uh, well you still get, you know, particularly if you are around a
bunch of people with kids, they still tend to look at you a little strangely
if you do not have them.  But, I am running into more and more people who have
opted not to have kids.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  So I do not feel quite so bad.

B.70:  Yeah, I mean, uh, you hear people, well there are some people that marry
later and then they are very set in their ways and there are activities that
they do, and well I really do not want to make that sacrifice.  I have, you
know, been single all these years and, or you know, we have been married and
we have all of our (( )) activities and I do not want to change my whole life.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  Or, I came from a family that I had a very bad childhood, and I do not know
that right now I could have children and cope with it.  I have too many bad
feelings with my own childhood, and maybe I will turn out to be, you know,
abusive like my mother was.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  So they say, you know, I, I do not feel that I want to do that,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  which is fine.  You know I, I think that's a wonderful decision on their
part if that's how they truly feel.  Not, you know, everybody [noise] saying
when are you going to have kids [laughter].

A.77:  [Laughter].  

B.78:  It's none of your business.

A.79:  That's right. 

B.80:  It's my option,

A.81:  [/Laughter].

B.82:  to do that.  You know, you do not just have ten kids because, you know,
you are supposed to somehow #as of the old days.#

A.83:  #Right, or you do not know# any better, or there's nothing available
[laughter].

B.84:  Yeah, my mom was from a family of, of ten and she was the youngest and her
dad was like sixty when she was born.

A.85:  Oh, my gosh.

B.86:  And she said, you know, so there was hardly anything from her father
[swallowing].  There was like twenty years between her father and her mother,
her father was sixty and her mother was forty.  So, you know, it did not make
the best situation for her, you know, to have, uh, you know, good family kind
of situation there, she had brothers and sisters that kind of like pushed her
[laughter] around a lot because they were so much older.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  [Inhaling] Yeah, it was not the best situation, but, yeah.

A.89:  Yeah, plus when they are that old, you know, it's not as though they are
going to go out and rough and tumble with the kids like a younger parent
would.

B.90:  Right, right.  Although, I mean, we are, we are in our late thirties now,
my husband and I, and we are still considering it and, [inhaling] you know, I
think that I have kind of done the right thing.  I mean, I have, I was just
really shocked to have a cousin who is a bit younger than I and she was one of
these types out of high school, you know ...
