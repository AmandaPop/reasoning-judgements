to hear him. Speaker A seems out of breath.  There is a hiss or white 
noise in background of both speakers.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Well #and,# 

B.2:  #Let's# see, we're going to talk about, uh, 

A.3:  Kids in college --

B.4:  #Kids,#

A.5:  -- #and# how to help them.

B.6:  How to pick one right?

@A.7:  Yes.

B.8:  #Well, I've been,#

A.9:  #And you've# been through three of those? 

B.10:  Uh, three times, #yeah.#

A.11:  #Yeah,# well, I've been through once.  So,

B.12:  #Well if,#

A.13:  #How# did you do it with your three?

B.14:  Well, with, uh, John, the first one, he wanted to go into engineering.  So,
uh, he had never really lived in a large town, so we looked at good
engineering schools in relatively small towns, like Purdue in, uh, Lafayette,
Indiana.  We looked at, uh, Clemson and V P I.

A.15:  Where were you living back then?

B.16:  We were living in, in north Alabama at the time.

A.17:  Okay.

B.18:  And, uh, we looked at Mississippi State, which was in a small town in
Mississippi and, uh, finally settled on Auburn, which was in Alabama in the
small town of Auburn.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And, uh, we also wanted a school that had a, uh, coop program because, uh,
he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good
way to get some experience at the same time.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  So that was kind of how, uh, we finally settled on small town and good
engineering school with a coop program for him.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  For Brian, it, that was kind of funny because he first started out
thinking, uh, (( )) that he wanted to go to a small school.  That's what he
thought when we lived in,

A.25:  [Breathing].

B.26:  Alabama.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High, he figured if I can
go to Senior High, I can go to school any place #[laughter].#

A.29:  #Yeah, I, I think there's a lot of that.#  When you go to a school with two
thousand kids there --

B.30:  That's right.

A.31:  -- suddenly a college that's small seems, I'm going backwards.

B.32:  Yeah.  So --

A.33:  So {very faintly},

B.34:  -- he ended up, uh, I don't remember what his original major was because he
changed it about three times,

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  at A and M.

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  #But,# he ended up going to A and M, I think because of, uh, he just
thoroughly enjoyed,

A.39:  [Clicking].

B.40:  the, uh, the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, uh, he was sold on the place.  Jana, I think, wanted to, to stick a
little closer to home.  And really didn't have a major when she went in.  In
fact, I think that with, somewhat of a, a default because her grades were not
as good as, uh, Brian and John's --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- in high school.  So she was somewhat limited in her, in her choices to
places like Stephen F. and,

A.45:  [Clicking].

B.46:  North Texas, and maybe U T A.

A.47:  #Uh-huh.#

B.48:  #And, uh,# she had some,

A.49:  [Talking].

B.50:  idea that she might want to, uh, do something with, uh, physical therapy
and T W U was also up in, uh, in Denton.  #So# --

A.51:  #Uh-huh.#

B.52:  -- if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even
have to move out of her apartment.

A.53:  [/Talking] Yeah.

B.54:  So, it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that,
uh, [clicking] [talking] she could commute back and forth between the two.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  How did, uh, your gal pick Baylor?

A.57:  Well, I think it was, well, a little bit of, she narrowed it pretty
rapidly to eliminate the real big ones, Texas and A and M.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  And then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted
to do and, uh, the, uh, quality of the program, it, it, you know, Baylor was
kind of always at the lead there for, uh, for some time.  Uh, she looked at
Austin College, I think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying
at any of the state schools.

B.60:  Oh.  What's her major?

A.61:  Um, accounting.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  So, it was a bit of, of the major, but not a whole lot.  There's a lot of
campuses have business majors, #so# --

B.64:  #Sure.#

A.65:  -- that was not a big deal for her.  But she just, uh, it was sort of her
choice and I think it was a little bit of, we visited there and she visited
some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there.  So, she had spent
some time #there and# --

B.66:  #I# see.

A.67:  -- felt pretty comfortable.  She, she looked at Austin College but I
think, again, it was the, the size aspect.  It was just too small for somebody
coming #from# --

B.68:  #Uh-huh.#

A.69:  -- #Plano# --

B.70:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.71:  -- unless you, you really felt you needed something smaller.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  #So it's,# 

B.74:  #What is# the population of Baylor?  I don't even know.

A.75:  Uh, about, uh, eleven thousand.

B.76:  Oh, is it?

A.77:  #Yeah.#

B.78:  #Okay.#

A.79:  So, it's, uh, it's sizeable but it's, it's sort of in the not giant size.

B.80:  Yeah, yeah.  Not like, uh, Austin and College #Station.#

A.81:  #Yeah.# Yeah, in the case of your kids, that I, I guess with Jennifer it
was more, uh, that she was making her own choice.  Which I kind of feel is one
of the keys, if they're going to go do it, they better, they better decide
where.  With, uh,

B.82:  Yeah, it needs to be a place they want to go.

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Uh, if they're going to be successful.  If they think Mom and Dad picked
it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's
what they want them to do.  Uh, that's the wrong reason for picking a place.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  That's kind of the way Brian picked his first major.  I think he, without
asking me, he thought because I was in computer science that he should do the
same thing.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  And so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and,
finally asked if I would mind if he changed.

A.89:  [Noise] {sounds like unwrapping something}.

B.90:  And I said, not at all, because y-, you want to find something that you
like to do, not necessarily what your Dad does.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  #So, uh# --

A.93:  #Definitely.#

B.94:  -- he felt a little easier about that after, uh, after I told him it
wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do, rather
then copy what I did.

A.95:  Yeah.  Well, it seems, uh, I don't know of a whole bunch of kids who, uh,
really do what their father did.  There's some, I think doctors may be a place
where, and I don't know quite why, that sons often follow Dad --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- into the profession, and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to
get an in and another folks [laughter] can't get in as easily.

B.98:  Well, that could be.

A.99:  But, uh, I don't have any kids who want to become engineers.

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  Uh, so, uh, you just kind of live with it.

B.102:  Sure.  Well, and they, they need to do something that they think --

A.103:  Yeah {very faintly}.

B.104:  -- they will enjoy.  [noise] And, uh, like I told Jana once she finally
settled on a major, she just did so much better in college than she did in
high school #once# --

A.105:  #Uh-huh.#

B.106:  -- she found something to get excited about.

A.107:  Yeah [clicking].

B.108:  And, uh, whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is, is
immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it.  And, uh, so far, I think she
is.

A.109:  Yeah.  Well, that's the key to it, is that enjoying what you're doing and,
uh, you know, I think the folks I see having more trouble picking colleges
are, I got some friends, who, at Arco, there who, uh, well, they're from back
east and, uh, their kids are, are looking in on some of those eastern private
schools.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  When you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag
and you --

B.112:  Oh, I know it.

A.113:  -- start saying, well, do you really [laughter] have to go there to get
what you want?  [laughter].

B.114:  That's right.  I mean it would be nice if you could but, you, you can be
successful without necessarily having a, uh, a degree from an eastern school.

A.115:  Uh-huh.  But they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there
so it's, uh, [sigh] some of them do that.

B.116:  Uh-huh.  Well they feel some, uh, peer pressure -- 

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  -- from their peers.

A.119:  Yeah.
