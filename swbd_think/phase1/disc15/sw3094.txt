A.1:  [Children] Okay, what, uh, T V shows do you like and what do you watch?

@B.2:  [Breathing] {fairly heavy} Well, I, I tend to be a, [sigh] a, uh, [sigh]
sports, news and, uh, not very many of the modern sitcoms.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  What about, what about yourself?

A.5:  Well, uh, I like a variety of things, you know, uh.  [sigh] The, like the
sitcom wise, I like, uh, MAJOR DAD, [sigh] I'm in the, I'm in the Navy so I
kind of, you know, can associate, even though he's a Marine officer.

B.6:  Yes #[laughter].#

A.7:  #I, uh, I# kind of associate with that a little bit and I kind of like the
way it's done.  Um, I like, uh, CHEERS.  I don't get to see it as often, as,
as I'd like to though.  Uh, uh, let me [barking] see what else.  Oh, there's
some on H B O that I've, uh, I like, it's a TALES FROM THE CRYPT.  They're
kind of like those, you know, (( )) Alfred Hitchcock TALES FROM THE CRYPT type
of things.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  I like watching that, too.  And, uh, I just, uh, I like, you know, enjoy
the horror or the mystery or whatever.  Just kind of seeing, you know, what
the twist would be.  And, uh, same thing, I like if I catch old TWILIGHT
ZONE and stuff, I like those.  So,

B.10:  Well, what I find is that outside of, uh, well sports because I'm a sports
fan, is the, the ones that I do watch is, uh, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  Yeah #[laughter].#

B.12:  -- #except# I, I wish they didn't have so many reruns [laughter].

A.13:  Right.  Right. 

B.14:  And otherwise we're caught up with, uh, because we are pretty good at
sitting down to dinner in the six to seven o'clock period, --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- uh, good ole, WHEEL OF FORTUNE, --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- which is, uh, an interesting combination of a, a lot of luck and, uh,
the, it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and
see if you think you're smart or smarter then, then those folks are.

A.19:  [Sniffing] Right.

B.20:  Uh, I have a family that is very much into sitcoms and, and I have to at
six o'clock, uh, fight getting the news,

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  on versus, uh, having the channel changed on me because they want to watch
COSBY or one of the other #ones# --

A.23:  #Right.# Right.

B.24:  -- that are running on one of the, uh, the off channels.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Well that's, uh, [talking] I don't do it so much, n-, I guess in
the last year or so, but before that, I w-, at the same time thing were
happening to me in front of the T V at a certain time I was watching JEOPAR-,
uh, JEOPARDY --

B.26:  #Uh-huh.#

A.27:  -- #and I# thought that was kind of interesting, you know, trying to answer
the questions and you o-, you learn some good #things# --

B.28:  #Yeah.#

A.29:  -- I thought, you know, pick up some interesting facts.

B.30:  Certainly more educational then WHEEL OF FORTUNE [laughter].

A.31:  Right.  [laughter]  But the one (( )) that slipped my mind, but the one
that I, my favorite T V show right now I would say is STAR TREK, uh, THE NEW
GENERATION.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I really enjoy it.  It's, uh, 

B.34:  [Noise].

A.35:  it's, uh, you know I thought that, I really liked the old STAR TREK and
this STAR TREK, uh, is so much better, you know.  Of course the, uh, special
effects are better and the, the story lines just seem to be really good and
it's, it's, uh, I really like it, enjoy it.

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#

A.37:  #And I,# but I always, you know, I, I got to start getting into the habit
of trying to record it on the V C R because I always forget, you know the kids
bedtime is a little after it starts,

B.38:  [Noise].

A.39:  so I kind of lose track of time putting the kids to bed.  And, uh, so I
always end up missing it.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  But I do like that show a lot because it follows, uh, follows a good
story line.  

B.42:  Yeah.  I find that, it seems to me and, uh, maybe this is as you get
older, I'm in my mid-forties now, but, uh, uh, I guess from my vantage point,
I think the quality of T V has gone down or else my interests have changed,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  because there were, there were various series over the years that I would
always make sure that I watched and yet I find that now, uh, there's hardly
anything that, that, except SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. that draws me to say, I want
to try to watch that.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  I may watch something just because it's on but I, uh, I tend to go more
to the educational channels, if there's, uh, something that seems interesting
there.  I just, uh, --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- as I say, don't find the modern sitcom very, uh, well, just very
appealing to my interests.

A.49:  Well, there is a lot of things that interest me too, that I catch, catch,
you know, as I'm, I flip through the channels on the Discovery Channel.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  And I do like a lot of shows on that.  Yeah [/children].

B.52:  Do you get A and E?

A.53:  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Because that's one, b-, we don't have cable so, uh, there's a few things I
miss because I don't have cable and A and E is one, whenever I'm on a business
trip --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and they have it, I find that it has things that are, uh, that interest
me.  They have a lot of series, uh, I guess I'm into, uh, I'm a history buff,
so, with all their reruns of, uh, the aviators over the --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- ages and, uh, who built what planes and all that was, uh, that type of
stuff interests me.  

A.59:  Uh-huh. Yeah, that's, uh, one of the things here, is, we, we, we kind of
have to have cable here with the reception in the Virginia Beach #area.#

B.60:  #Huh.#

A.61:  You, you maybe, if you're lucky, get three channels okay.  And, uh,
otherwise, uh, if you want anything more than that you need to get it, you
need to get, uh, cable T V.

B.62:  Yeah.  I guess that varies from place to place.  Being in the Dallas area
because we have, we have about seven without, uh, cable and then with cable,
who knows how many you can get.

A.63:  Right.  Right.

B.64:  Seven seems enough [laughter].

A.65:  Yeah.  [laughter] Yeah, that sure is plenty.  But, uh, let me see, what
other, oh, there's a new T V show out called DINOSAURS.  Did you catch any of
that?

B.66:  Uh, I've read a little bit about it but, uh, I haven't, I don't even know
if it's running here in Dallas.  It kind of shows the level of interest I have
in looking at the T V schedule.  What time's it on there?

A.67:  Well, I, I don't know that it's showing anymore.  I thought, I saw it
show once or twice, --

B.68:  #Uh-huh.#

A.69:  -- #I# saw the first one, you know, because I was interested in seeing what
it looked like.  And it wasn't really that good.  I mean, you know, the Muppet
stuff was really, was, was okay #but, uh,# --

B.70:  #Uh-huh.#

A.71:  -- the, the comedy on it wasn't, wasn't very, very funny or anything.  

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  And, uh, I think it might have been cut already [laughter].  Because, uh,
same with you, I haven't really paid attention but I hadn't seen it, you know,
just glancing through the T V GUIDE or whatever.  So, it might have been cut
and, uh, I thought that was surprising being a new show and I'm sure it cost a
lot of money to make.

B.74:  Well, they do but it, it's amazing these days.  If something isn't making
it, the word of mouth, uh, of people talking to each other can cause a program
which gets bad reviews to, uh, to, uh, not last for very long.  And, --

A.75:  #Uh-huh.#

B.76:  -- #even# though they did,

A.77:  [Sniffing].

B.78:  invest money in it --

A.79:  #Uh-huh.#

B.80:  -- #that# they, uh, 

A.81:  [Children].

B.82:  it's I think the comparison is like baseball managers this year.  They seem
to, uh, say, two weeks in, uh, you've had your chance time to, uh [laughter],

A.83:  [Laughter] #Yeah.#

B.84:  #Since# you aren't making it, we're going to find somebody else.

A.85:  Yeah, that's true.  How about any of the other shows like, uh, you know,
THIRTY-SOMETHING or L A LAW or, or, uh, what, SHANNON'S DEAL, I #guess is
another one?#

B.86:  #Well, you know,# L A LAW seems to be real hot and in fact, because of the
particular business I'm in, I'm not a lawyer,

A.87:  [Noise].

B.88:  but I work with lawyers a lot, --

A.89:  Uh-huh [sniffing].

B.90:  -- and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  And yet I, again I have to say because of, uh, uh, I,

A.93:  [Noise].

B.94:  have not watched very many episodes of it.

A.95:  [Children] Uh-huh.

B.96:  Uh, again it's, I don't know what I do with my time but I certainly don't
spend it watching,

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  uh, T V in the evenings.

A.99:  Right.  Right.  Well, same here, usually it's already by the time we get
everything done, it's, uh, time to go to bed #[laughter].#

B.100:  #Uh-huh.#

A.101:  But, uh, I've caught that a few times, you know, THIRTY-SOMETHING and all,
and, uh, and even L A LAW, and usually the episodes [children] that I watch,
you know, I'm not a fan of it or anything,
