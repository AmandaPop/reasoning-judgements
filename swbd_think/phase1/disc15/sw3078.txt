========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, what do you think?

B.2:  [Inhaling] It, um, I'm trying to remember exactly how the question was
worded.  What, what change,

A.3:  Women's roles and how they've changed,

B.4:  In the last generation or two.

@A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  [Breathing] Well, one thing, and I don't know how, how long a span a
generation is considered, whether we're talking, you know, twenty years or, or
whatever --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- but it seems to me there are more and more women, it's obvious there are
more and more women working outside the home --

A.9:  Oh, yeah.

B.10:  -- some of them, of course, are finally climbing corporate ladders --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, whereas when I was growing up it was either secretary or teacher.

A.13:  Oh, really?  Are you working outside the home?

B.14:  Yes, I work at T I.

A.15:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I still notice a lot of not necessarily prejudice, but
I work with a, um, some men that are very chauvinistic still.

B.16:  [Laughter] So do I [laughter].

A.17:  Yeah, it is, it's, it's very hard to deal with, because, I mean, they know
that it offends me what, the way they act, but they do it anyway.  So.  I
don't know though, it's really weird because m-, I came from a very, my family
has a lot of strong willed women in it, and so, I've, I've never really, you
know, nobody ever said, well you could only be a secretary or a nurse to me.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  You know, my, my parents were very strong and said you can do whatever you
want to do.  So, I got really lucky there, but it's real funny, I have a niece
and a nephew now, and my nephew is seven years old, and something was said
about my niece being a doctor, and he said, Well, she can't be a doctor, she
can only be a nurse [laughter].

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  I thought, Golly, you're seven years old and you're already opinionated
[laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter] Well, and probably, probably he hasn't seen any female doctors.

A.23:  Well, yeah, that's the only thing I could figure, because I'm, I'm sure
that he didn't get that from my, my mother or his mother.

B.24:  Probably not, but, but on, if he watches television --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- if he gets a coloring book the doctor is, is frequently, uh, sh-,
portrayed as a male --

A.27:  Oh, really.

B.28:  -- and the nurse.  Well, I'm just, I'm just thinking of pictures that --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- I've seen, and, and, you know, uh, uh, I, I suspect no, no message was
ever intended to be while, what, you have to be this gender to do this job --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- but it does sometimes come through.  And when I said, um, that, th-,
those were the only two professions folks seemed to do, it wasn't necessarily
that that was what I was told to do, or, or whatever, it simply, that's what I
observed growing up was --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- about the only women, you know, it, a woman at that time could, uh,
clerk in a grocery store --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- or any other kind of store --

A.37:  Be a teacher.

B.38:  -- yeah, and I went into teaching, that was what I ha-, started out doing
early on --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and left that when I decided to get married and leave Texas for a while.

A.41:  Oh, really.

B.42:  So, and I've never gone back to it in the last, in the intervening nineteen
years, it's just, uh, I, I love to teach, I don't want to have to deal with
the discipline problems --

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  -- and so forth, so, that's a whole another story.

A.45:  Yeah, yeah, my daddy was a, that was his, I guess, second profession.  He
was a teacher [laughter].

B.46:  Oh, okay.  Undying admiration comes from me, that's, that's for sure.

A.47:  Huh, well, that's neat.  Well, um, it was real funny I went to a seminar
that was just, it was, is a satellite seminar.  It was really neat, and it was
just for women.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  And they talked about the Cin-, Cinderella syndrome.  And I had never heard
about that, had you.

B.50:  Uh, uh, not by that term, anyway.

A.51:  Well, it's about how women, or not necessarily women, but little girls are
taught that your prince will come, and he'll do everything, and he'll make
everything right.

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  And, um, it was really neat, because she totally reworked this, the story
about Cinderella, um, met, worked her way to this ball, and then [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  It was really neat, it was great the way she turned the story around.

B.56:  Very interesting.  

A.57:  Yeah, she left her calling card in the form of a glass slipper and
[laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] Very creative.  

A.59:  [Laughter]  Yeah, it was really neat, but you know, I hadn't even thought
about fairy tales, that they really do leave that impression, I'm sure with a
lot of little girls.

B.60:  Well, I hadn't thought about it, but very likely.  I went to a seminar, a
conference, just, uh, Friday afternoon, that was put on by, by T I, but it, it
dealt with, um, the minority issues of promotion within the business.

A.61:  Oh, really.

B.62:  And they had invited three speakers from, uh, one from Xerox, and one from
Pepsico, and another company out of Denver, and, the-, these gentlemen were
all, uh, V P or higher, were from minorities, but in addition, they were also
addressing, um, women, or including women --

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  -- in, in the entire focus of --

A.65:  Huh.

B.66:  -- the minority issues.  And, so, uh, it was a very interesting discussion
in the afternoon, uh, the questions and so forth that their con-, three, uh,
uh, speeches engendered, uh, just talking about, Well, how, how does your
company deal with this, and --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- and, and so forth.  And it was refreshing to hear that, uh, companies
are beginning to address the issue of, uh, [breathing] so few women beyond a
certain level --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- So few in the board room --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and so forth, and so, they, they shared some of the ideas they, their
companies were, had, uh, instituted as far as, uh, giving a leg up, mentoring
processes, and --

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  -- so forth that they --

A.75:  Well, that's neat.

B.76:  -- that they had in place.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  And then one of our V P -s shared what, what are some of the things that T
I is doing to, um, come up with some similar results.

A.79:  Huh, well that's neat, yeah.

B.80:  I'm beginning to find more and more female engineers --

A.81:  Oh, really.

B.82:  -- although not, um, [lipsmack] not many of them yet have moved into
manager positions --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- but that'll, part of that's because so many of them are, are still real
young --

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  -- and they've got to learn the business first --

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  -- and then they can move up.

A.89:  Well, I work in a computer industry also, and, um, I've found very few
women that are higher up in the M I S departments.

B.90:  Um.

A.91:  I can only think of one out of all the people that I've talked to, so,
it's, it's amazing that, yeah, they're out there, but they're just slowly
moving their way up, but, hopefully it will all happen and by the time my
little niece gets up there she can [laughter].

B.92:  [Laughter] She can pick whatever she wants to be --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that
prince --

A.95:  Right.

B.96:  -- that's okay too.

A.97:  Oh, yeah, yeah, 

B.98:  But there,

A.99:  I don't want here to be neglected of anything like that but,

B.100:  Yeah, but there are other options that are available.

A.101:  Oh, yeah, well, um, I lost my train of thought [laughter].

B.102:  I'm sorry [laughter].

A.103:  [Laughter] No, that's okay.  Um, well, I've lost it [laughter].  Um.  Oh,
well, um, yeah, it's, it's, uh, I think it's gotten a lot better over the
years, but, like I said, I felt very fortunate that I grew up around strong
willed women anyway --

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  -- so, because, I, I, some of the women that I have worked with are so
wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them,

B.106:  [Laughter].
