===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I'm talking to you from Dallas.  What part of the country
are you in?

B.2:  [Talking] Oh, boy, this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter] Well, we can, uh, complain together ((or swear )) we can
complain together about the humidity [laughter].

B.4:  Exactly.  I guess the weather hasn't been too different between us.

A.5:  No, I don't think so, I wouldn't think, yeah.  I,

B.6:  W-, what part of Dallas are you from?

A.7:  Far north Dallas [laughter].

B.8:  Oh, north Dallas.

A.9:  Yeah, about a half a mile from Plano [laughter].  

B.10:  Well, jeez.

A.11:  #So we're in the,#

B.12:  #Well then you've been# getting quite a bit of rain also.

A.13:  Yeah, it's been very, very rainy, I know.  Oh --

B.14:  How about that.  How does it compare to the years past?

A.15:  -- um, I don't know, I haven't lived here, let's see, we m-, lived out of
state in Wisconsin and we just c-, we lived here ten years ago, and when we
first lived here, we l-, we were in Garland, East Richardson,

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  and, um, doesn't seem like it was quite as humid.

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  And, I don't know, then we went, we lived in, uh, Madison, Wisconsin for
five years, um, for my husband's schooling, a-, graduate schooling, and it
just, it's a lot cleaner up there, but, um, it's a lot colder too.

B.20:  Huh.  Well, what brought you guys down to Texas then?

A.21:  Uh, his job, he came back to start work again for a different company, so,
#said,#

B.22:  #How#  #about that.#

A.23:  #Here, here's# a g-, here we are again.

B.24:  That's great.

A.25:  It just seems a little more humid than it, I don't ever remember, of
course, you know, you only remember the good stuff, but, um, I just don't
remember the humidity.

B.26:  Right.  #Well# --

A.27:  #This# much rain, and this much humidity.

B.28:  -- definitely, I'm sure, the winters are more mild here.

A.29:  Uh, yeah, they are.  Actually, though, it was a lot rainier here in the
winter, uh, we came back last August.

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  It's just a lot rainier than I remember it, all th-, through the
seasons, you know.

B.32:  Sure.

A.33:  Um,

B.34:  It seems that progressive, I've, been down here five years, just over five
years now, that, every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy.

A.35:  Yeah, and I think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more
polluted.  I really do think that's part of it.

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  Um, uh, in, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, when they get winters it's, um,
th-, the winters are bad, but not what you hear about.  It's just like down
here, when you hear, when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up
north think it's a hundred and sixty down here.

B.38:  A hundred and sixty.

A.39:  Hundre-, I'm making that up.  

B.40:  #Uh-huh, right.#

A.41:  #You know, when# it's only like ninety-five.

B.42:  Sure.

A.43:  Um, it's just like up there, when you hear it's forty below, it's probably
really only five below.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  Um, and it's so dry, that it's, it's like going to Ar-, well, probably what
y-, Arizona used to be like, you know,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  it's just dry and cool, so it's not, it's not what you think it is.

B.48:  True.

A.49:  Um, no, there have been times, though, when it gets so frigid that you
[laughter],

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  you can't stand it.  Where did you move here from?

B.52:  Colorado.

A.53:  Well, there, you could talk about that, that's, 

B.54:  #Oh sure, I, I'm uh,#

A.55:  #that's a strange state for,# 

B.56:  I'm very familiar, my grandparents and all my relatives are from
Wisconsin.

A.57:  Oh, there you go, okay.

B.58:  So, I'm, uh, quite familiar with how it is up there, and if you, kind of
interesting, uh, the people down here typically don't think it gets above, you
know, fifty degrees [laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter]  This is very true.

B.60:  And it's always snow, you know, but, uh,

A.61:  Yeah, right, well actually, the summers up there, we thought, were the most
beautiful time of the year.

B.62:  Oh yes.

A.63:  Um, in terms of Colorado, I know my husband likes to camp and backpack and
all the stuff I don't like, um,

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  but I'd, used to go on, I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and
I did a lot of business in, uh, um, Colo-, well, Denver, and that's, that's
probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and col-, uh, it just was
a very mixed bag in terms #of Colorado.#

B.68:  #Oh sure.#  My parents just live, uh, thirty miles south of Denver and it
can be sunny and, and no problem in Denver and they'll be having snow
[throat_clearing].

A.69:  Isn't that strange?

B.70:  So it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a short distance
[throat_clearing].

A.71:  Yeah, and then things like torn-, are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or
n-, I don't, 

B.72:  Uh, it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  It used to be no problem, just because it was such a, a rugged terrain
and with trees everywhere, but now,

A.75:  #The mountains, yeah.#

B.76:  #as they start to clear# more things out.

A.77:  Even, I mean, I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I can tell
you that, um, they've even had, in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania,
they've even had, I'm going to say, mini tornadoes for lack of a better word.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And, and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside.
That was unheard of, you know, twenty years ago.

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  Um, so I don't know what's happening, if it's, you know, we are, the
greenhouse, I don't really know.

B.82:  Yeah, me neither.

A.83:  It's just, you know.

B.84:  But,

A.85:  It's definitely not as, um, I know I associate the pollution with weather
in general, so I guess one thing we do miss, is that's a smaller town, and it
w-, it was, it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the
atmosphere, you know.

B.86:  Sure, sure.  Well, it's been good talking to you.

A.87:  You too. 

B.88:  #Good-bye [/talking].#

A.89:  #Okay.#

B.90:  Good-bye.

A.91:  Bye-bye.
