==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  Well  I don't know, um, I, I like to sail, and my husband's a camper, um,
but I've never been camping in eleven years of marriage, so that tells you
something [laughter]. 

A.3:  So camping, camping is not your bag [laughter]. 

B.4:  Camping is not my bag, no, is that your bag?

A.5:  Oh, I used to be, I, I was in the scouts for probably close to twenty years
and I,

B.6:  Oh, my, okay.  

A.7:  I got my  fill of it. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  So, now my idea of, of vacation is laying on the beach,

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  Uh,  drinking a Mai Tai or two, or whatever. 

B.12:  Yeah, well we do that to, yes.  Uh, I could tell you one place I could
probably convince you to go to.  Have you ever heard of the British Virgin
Islands?

A.13:  Yes. 

B.14:  Not the U S, but the British. 

A.15:  Right. 

B.16:  Yeah you have (( )) and, and n-, Peter Island and (( )).

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  You've been there?

A.19:  No, I haven't but I've heard of it and, and,

B.20:  Yeah, you need to g-, you need to go there. 

A.21:  and we were, uh, we were even talking about that, you know, here just in
the last few weeks. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  In fact I saw a brochure on Tortola. 

B.24:  Tortola. 

A.25:  Or, Tortola. 

B.26:  That's okay, yeah.  You uh,

A.27:  Uh.  

B.28:  it's,  it's, I mean it really is.  Have you ever been to Hawaii, or
Bahamas or,

A.29:  Oh, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, I've been to all those places several times and,

B.30:  Yeah, what you, what you never want to do is go back there and you don't
even want to bother going to the U S side.  You just want to go straight in to
the British Virgin Islands.  It's wonderful [laughter].

A.31:  I lo-, I like the Caribbean anyway. 

B.32:  Yeah, I mean it's, the natives are friendly, um, the water is, even more
than you'd think, um.  And I mean if you could talk yourself into i-, I don't
know if you like boats are not, but they sail tall ships down there that are,
that are like being on a regular cruise. 

A.33:  Right, kind of like uh, uh, barefoot cruises type of thing, yeah, uh-huh. 

B.34:  Right, right, yeah.  Um, where else, I'm trying to think, what, what are
some of your favorite vacation spots. 

A.35:  Uh, Jamaica. 

B.36:  I've never been there, I've been to the,

A.37:  Now that's, it's, it, it's really a friendly place,

B.38:  Is it? 

A.39:  and it's  very, very beautiful and there's lots to do. 

B.40:  I think a long time ago, when we were going to go there they were having
some trouble in (( )). They, they were having some unrest among the civilians. 

A.41:  Well they had, a, one time they had some rebels, uh,

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  raising trouble, but that's pretty much subsided now. 

B.44:  # Yeah, I think that's, #

A.45:  # Uh, but that's a, # that's a place I would recommend.  Uh, uh, probably
the other place would be somewhere like, uh, Puerto Vallerta. 

B.46:  Is that worth going to? Now we lived in, uh, the, the upper Mid West for a
while before we were in Texas and then we left and then, uh, we came back with
my husband's job about eight months ago.  And when we lived in the up, the Mid
West, um, we were talking about wouldn't it be nice in the winter to be able
to just fly to Mexico.  Um, but one thing we never did was do that, or go to
places like Puerto Vallerta.

A.47:  Yeah, actually, it very, very pretty,

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  there's  a lot to do there and it's reasonably priced.  Of, of all the
places that I know in Mexico, probably the most, uh, practical. 

B.50:  You can get the taste of Mexico without getting into a lot of trouble,

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  in terms of the water, the food.  I mean you feel like Southern Ca-, --

A.53:  Yeah, you don't really have that problem there.  They've got their own
water purification system and,

B.54:  -- and you're still like in Southern California, essentially. 

A.55:  Uh, kind of. 

B.56:  I mean, I know you're not, but, you know. 

A.57:  Yeah, no kind of, you it's, you know, it's kind of got that atmosphere but
it, it caters very much to, uh, to young adults and children too. 

B.58:  Uh-huh, that's nice to hear. 

A.59:  So, kids can have as well, there's lot of places, uh,

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  You know Cancun is just really overbuilt. 

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  And I don't think caters to kids as much anymore as they used to. 

B.64:  Family, yeah, and I've never been to either of those. 

A.65:  I went back when it was just relatively new. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  And, uh, over the years as it go so crowded, that, you know, you just can't
trust, you know, turn kids loose and let them play, and so it got worse. 

B.68:  Isn't that a shame, yeah. 

A.69:  You can down there, you know, you can. 

B.70:  See that's nice to hear, yeah.  Um, one place we like is Northern
California, Napa Valley, have you ever been out there?

A.71:  Yes, but, you know [laughter], 

B.72:  [Laughter].  

A.73:  I  go to California every other week. 

B.74:  Yo-, oh, you do?

A.75:  So, uh, I get my fill of California. 

B.76:  You go to Silicone Valley?

A.77:  Uh, no actually, uh, I go up into Fairfield, Travis Air Force Base. 

B.78:  Oh, okay. 

A.79:  And, uh, so I, get, uh, I get my fill of all that. 

B.80:  Yeah, tha-, I can say that because, uh, we haven't been.  I mean that was
like once, you know, five years ago or something, but, um, I used to work in a
place called E D S and I know I used to go a little bit more than I wanted to
to Sacramento and after a while it just, or L A and it wasn't fun anymore.

A.81:  Yeah, L A I hate to even get off at the airport. 

B.82:  # Yeah, I mean it's, um, #

A.83:  # And I go there all # the time, it's just, I mean it's like a second home,
I, I and I'm there my attitude changes. 

B.84:  Every other week, well look at it this way, you have great frequent flyers
to,

A.85:  # Yes [laughter].  #

B.86:  # to, to # the vacation spots [laughter]. 

A.87:  Yeah, that, I mean, that is true. 

B.88:  One place you might consider is, um, are you native Texan?

A.89:  No. 

B.90:  And, I mean, or have you traveled around the mid, the United States a lot,
or,

A.91:  Yeah, I've been just about everywhere you could imagine in the world
[laughter]. 

B.92:  Oh, okay, are you a pilot or something. 

A.93:  Uh, well I am, but, uh,

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.95:  # but, # not, uh, I don't do that as a, as a business. 

B.96:  Not anymore. 

A.97:  No. 

B.98:  Um, I was going to say, one place my husband's been trying to get me, I
probably wouldn't camp but I would stay in Queen Victoria's, I think that's the
name of it, but ((Vance)) National Park in Canada. 

A.99:  Yeah ((Vance)).

B.100:  Yeah,

A.101:  # Yeah.  #

B.102:  # have # you ever been up there? 

A.103:  No, but, uh, we're planning, I'm, I'm planning, to take a ski trip up there
this winter. 

B.104:  That's yeah, a place, I mean, that's I mean I see pictures, I mean that's
to us would be God's country.

A.105:  I've been up in, uh, you know Montreal and Toronto and those kind of
places. 

B.106:  Uh-huh, I've been up there.  I thi-, I mean I like Canada, I, we, where we
came from when we came back here was Minnesota and, uh, it's beautiful, it's
just too darn cold.

A.107:  Yeah, I go to Minnesota regularly too. 

B.108:  Do you. 

A.109:  [Laughter]. 

B.110:  What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?

A.111:  Huh. 

B.112:  I'm not supposed to, I, I'm not supposed to ask this kind of, but what do
you do?

A.113:  I'm an engineer. 

B.114:  Oh, you are, my, he's an engineer too, but he doesn't do that [laughter]. 

A.115:  [Laughter]  But I travel all over.  Vermont, now, now if you really want to
go some place,

B.116:  # That's beautiful.  #

A.117:  # in the # Spring,

B.118:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.119:  # in # early Spring, like, uh, right at the end of April, is early Spring
for there,

B.120:  Uh-huh. 

A.121:  is when all the leaves change,

B.122:  # In Vermont you mean.# 

A.123:  # start coming,# yes, 

B.124:  Uh-huh. 

A.125:  and  they are absolutely, it's breathtaking, really is. 

B.126:  You mean changing from the, you mean changing into green or,

A.127:  Well when they start coming out, you know when they start,

B.128:  # Yeah, right, uh-huh, yeah.  #

A.129:  # the leaves start coming # out.  Uh, it's really, really pretty.  And then
the other time of the season is in the late Spring, uh,

B.130:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.131:  # just # before Summer, uh,

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  I'm  sorry, the Fall, ga-,

B.134:  The Fall you mean, yeah, that's okay.  

A.135:  I'm so-, jus-, talking about Spring, but  anyway in the Fall, uh, just
before the get the, the frost is another time. 

B.136:  What month is, wha-, what time, of, ye-, of, of, what time of the fall is a
good time to go to Vermont. 

A.137:  Usually for leaf watching and things like that,

B.138:  Yeah.  

A.139:  if  you want to look at foliage change, yo-, is, is about the, the, the
fi-,

B.140:  Sure.  

A.141:  anywhere  from the very first to middle October. 

B.142:  Really. 

A.143:  Yeah, much past that they start really getting into the cold season. 

B.144:  Because we talked about, uh, they offer bread, bed and breakfast bicycle
tours, that kind of thing. 

A.145:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing]. 

B.146:  Hiking tours, and that's kind of my outdoors type, you know, hike and then
you can stay somewhere where there's a ho-, nice fireplace and,

A.147:  Well they've got plenty of that stuff there.  In fact, I,

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  in  fact, you know, through business, you know, I've met a lot of nice
people at companies that, where I go and, and we've gotten to be friends over
the years and, uh,

B.150:  # Gee, that's nice.  #

A.151:  # and, uh, you # know. 

B.152:  Well what's a good bed and breakfast in Vermont? 

A.153:  Well I mean by name?

B.154:  Yeah, by name. 

A.155:  Well I don't really know of any by name because they all have little family
type names,

B.156:  Yeah, well #what's a good tow-,# -- 

A.157:  #but I drive, I #drive b-, by them all the time when I'm going back and
forth. 

B.158:  -- what's like a good town to go to then?

A.159:  Uh, probably up in the (( )).

B.160:  Uh-huh. 

A.161:  Either there are, down in, uh, I'm trying to think what the name of that
little town is. 

B.162:  Burlington, no, that's -- 

A.163:  Well Burlington is the big, see that's where I go for the big city. 

B.164:  -- that's a city, yeah. 

A.165:  Um, I'm trying to think of that little town, just down the way,

B.166:  Bennig-, no, Bennington, no, that's in,

A.167:  Uh, uh, Water, Waterville. 

B.168:  # Waterville, okay.  #

A.169:  # Ye-, and # then there's, uh, Middlebury. 

B.170:  Middlebury, I've heard of that, okay. 

A.171:  Yeah, Middlebury, is a, it's a, it's a real tiny community,

B.172:  Uh-huh.  

A.173:  and  it's got like three colleges. 

B.174:  Oh.  

A.175:  But  they've got these little bed and breakfasts all over down there and,
and anywhere in from there on, on further down south,

B.176:  # Uh-huh, see.  #

A.177:  # there's nothing # but mountains. 

B.178:  See, we, I mean, if New England, if the, um, economic situation were
different, we probably would have gone there instead of coming back to Dallas. 

A.179:  Uh-huh. 

B.180:  Um, because the topography here, I don't know how you feel about Texas. 

A.181:  [Throat_clearing]  Flat. 

B.182:  Right, it's just not, I mean in general it's got the different terrains,
but I just don't think it's a, a beautiful state.

A.183:  Texas is not a beautiful state, by any means, I mean, of course, that, I
mean, I've lived here for most of my life but, uh,

B.184:  Yeah.  I'm originally from Pennsylvania.  Now there's a pretty state. 

A.185:  Oh, yeah, that is, yeah. 

B.186:  Um, (( )) and Allegheny Mountains. 

A.187:  Well do you know where Lockhaven is?

B.188:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh. 

A.189:  Yeah, [laughter]  I used to fly for Piper. 

B.190:  Oh, my goodness, you really, yeah.  What do you do sell airwa-, airplane
parts now, if you don-, me-, engineer them or what. 

A.191:  No, build them. 

B.192:  I'm kind of envious of somebody that gets to travel that much [laughter]. 

A.193:  [Laughter]. 

B.194:  But it's like anything else, it's not all it's cracked up to be when you're
in a suitcase that often. 

A.195:  No, it's, it's not, it's not, uh, it's not that great all the time, not
when you have a wife and,

B.196:  Yeah.  

A.197:  and  child, but it's, uh. 

B.198:  Yeah, and overseas, do you go overseas? I mean we've never been to Europe
at all.

A.199:  Yes, yes. 

B.200:  Have you, have you been to Eastern Europe?

A.201:  Uh, not, no, not really there.  Most of, most of mine has been in, uh,

B.202:  Germany.  

A.203:  England, uh, you know, uh, Belgium, you know. 

B.204:  Uh-huh.  If you were taking an airline overseas is luf-, Lufthansa a good
airline?

A.205:  Lufthansa is very good. 

B.206:  Is it. 

A.207:  Yeah.  

B.208:  How about Yugoslavian airlines. 

A.209:  Uh, I've never taken that one [laughter]. 

B.210:  [Laughter]  I mean when you, when you've been overseas are most people
receptive to Americans?

A.211:  Yeah, pretty much.  

B.212:  That's something we're  considering here. 

A.213:  You, you, the only thing you have to be really, you have to just be very
cautious. 

B.214:  Of what?

A.215:  Of just, you know, what you say to people, you don't want to tell them
anything that, you know, that, that could possibly give them the wrong idea. 

B.216:  That you have too much on you or something or,

A.217:  Yeah, that, plus, uh, you know, if you work for a government contractor,
you don't want to tell them things like that or,

B.218:  Uh-huh.  

A.219:  you  know, whatever, you just want to be pretty low key, just, the, just,
you know, just participate as a tourist, and try to stay out of,

B.220:  Like I'm in journalism, I wouldn't walk around opening my big mouth saying
that's what I do for a living. 

A.221:  No, you'd probably, you know, be better, if you just,

B.222:  # Low key.  #

A.223:  # you know, # say hey, I'm, you know, I'm an artist, or [laughter], 

B.224:  Yeah.  

A.225:  or, you know, something other than what you are, or, you know. 

B.226:  That's a good idea, yeah.  That's something we're pursuing, we're thinking
about.

A.227:  But, uh, especially on the airplane part because, they, there, there's a
lot of potential for, you know, uh, hijackings and things like that, terrorist
attacks.

B.228:  Oh goodness. 

A.229:  You just have to be very, very cautious.  Uh, you don't want to dress,

B.230:  Uh-huh.  

A.231:  [Clicking] you know, like you're, uh,

B.232:  Hello.  

A.233:  fit to kill.  (( )) get off the phone honey {talking to someone else who
picked up the phone}.

B.234:  [Laughter]. 

A.235:  Got a bad habit of [clicking] of getting on the telephone. 

B.236:  Well that's okay, she wants to talk about vacations, that's what it is
[laughter]. 

A.237:  [Laughter]  Uh, but anyway, uh,

B.238:  Really, see now, European travel, i-, I mean, so you're, I mean you sound
like a, a fellow that knows, I mean, is it still safe to go, though. 

A.239:  Yes. 

B.240:  In terms of,
