A.1:  Well hi, Bob.

B.2:  Hi.

@A.3:  Hi.  Um, my lawn and garden, well that, that's quite a topic because, uh,
basically my husband takes care of it.

B.4:  Um.

A.5:  Um, but what he's done is he's done a raised garden in the back yard --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- because that, we don't have dirt around here, you understand that.

B.8:  R-, right, yeah, that's the,

A.9:  Th-, it's, it's sludge, it's, it's mud, it's cruddy.  So you know, instead
of, uh, trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented, um, we've just
decided to do the raised garden, and it works out great.  He just built like a
twelve by eight box --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- out of, um, lumber, that's, you know, the (( )) lumber, and it's, I
guess it's maybe, oh, say eighteen inches wide.  So it makes a really nice
box.  Set that on top of the dirt --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and then worked and worked and worked with the soil.  I mean bag after
bag from Wolfe Nursery --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- to, uh, fill it up.  But over the years, it has produced some of the
best vegetables and garden, um, you know, type things, that,

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  boy, it's been really great.  And right now, we have tomatoes out there,
and we've got, you know, have eggplant, we're growing corn.  Corn grows great
here.  So, um,

B.18:  Yeah, oh, that's good, uh,

A.19:  We really enjoy that a lot.

B.20:  Yeah, well, it's, uh, so far as vegetable gardening is concerned, it has
been, uh, many years since I've tried any of that.  Uh, I, we did have, uh,
we've been in our house, uh, where we're located now for about fifteen 
years --

A.21:  Oh.

B.22:  -- and about, uh, eight, nine, about nine years ago, I guess, we put a
swimming pool in our backyard, which means we don't have a backyard anymore.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  Uh, so our, our gardening is pretty much, uh, limited to plants, uh, you
know, shrubs and, and trees, tha-, that kind of gardening.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  Uh, in the years that I did have vegetable gardens, there were, you know,
there were times when I had really good gardens and there were times when they
just, they weren't very good at all.  And I guess, uh, the soil and the, and
the bugs together, sort of, uh,

A.27:  It's, it's amazing they come up.  Well, someone told me they, they come in
the, in the, uh, packs --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- you know, the seed packages --

B.30:  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.

A.31:  -- that's where the bugs come from [laughter].

B.32:  Uh, I always like to try to grow squash --

A.33:  Yeah, oh those,

B.34:  -- and, uh, the squash bugs, w-, would just go crazy.

A.35:  Oh, yeah, we've given up on those ourselves.

B.36:  And, uh, and in, in my experience with tomatoes was that if I got tomatoes
at all, they usually got, uh, sun blisters, you know, or, or it would rain on
them and they would bust open, you know, when the heat hit them.  But, uh,

A.37:  Yeah.  I guess we've got an early, early grow variety or something like
that, and they're just now, you know, starting to turn red, so, b-, hopefully
before all this heat hits,

B.38:  Yeah, but, uh, 

A.39:  we'll have some tomatoes.

B.40:  but there were, you know, there were years, uh, w-, I grew, uh, the
little plum, salad type tomatoes --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- uh, quite a bit, and had real good luck with those.  Uh, one year at a,
the house we lived in before, which was also here in Richardson, uh, we grew
okra, and I, I picked okra,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  up until almost Christmas [laughter].

A.45:  I know what you mean.  Green peppers grow like crazy, too, around here.

B.46:  Yeah, and, uh, and I s-, I still occasionally will grow, uh, jalapeno
peppers.

A.47:  Right, yeah.

B.48:  Uh, we, we like jalapenos, and they, they grow real well too, you know --

A.49:  Definitely. 

B.50:  -- you just stick one of those anywhere.

A.51:  Right [laughter] Right.

B.52:  Uh, one of the things that we're doing, talking about, uh, about lawns and
shrubs, uh, we have a live oak tree in our front yard --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  And we're in the process, or at least in the planning stage of, of putting
in a bed around that oak tree.

A.57:  I think that'd be really pretty.  Really nice.

B.58:  Uh, right, yeah, we're going to just have a ground, you know, put ground
cover and, and may-, you know, maybe a few low plants under there.

A.59:  I th-, I think that Asian jasmine just is so aggressive --

B.60:  Right.  And, uh,

A.61:  -- it'll take no time at all to surround that tree --

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  -- and probably your house and your back yard and your pool,

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  the way it goes.

B.66:  We, uh, we, uh, brought some plants out, we're from both from East Texas --

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  -- and we brought some plants in from there, and, uh, o-, one of the things
that we brought, unintentionally, was, uh, violets --

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  -- which is l-, almost like a ground cover --

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  -- and they really s-, they really spread out and grow, uh, pretty rapidly
when they, you know, when they're growing well.  Uh, yeah.

A.73:  Oh, that would be a good idea.

B.74:  But they, uh, they are I guess, uh, not an annual, but a, they, they
volunteer to come back every year --

A.75:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.76:  -- but they die off during the winter, I've forgotten what the term is for
that.  But, uh, but they do die back during the winter, so that, you know,
they are not really very satisfactory for a, you know, for a full ground
cover, because of that.  But, uh,

A.77:  Yeah, well, that, you know, one project we're looking at is we're building
a deck out back, and we want to put a tree in, and we've been looking around,
and maybe you could, you know, suggest something, but, um, the tree that we've
sort of, you know, come upon is a Bradford pear.  And we wanted it for shade,
and we wanted it, you know, for the leaf --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and, um, that's, you know.

B.80:  Yeah, um, I, I don't, I'm not familiar with that pear tree, uh, but it's a
nonbearing

A.81:  Right,

B.82:  pear, is that right?  Yeah.

A.83:  it do-, it's, yeah, it's ornamental.

B.84:  Uh, and then the, uh, of course the leaves drop off during the winter.
Right, so yeah.

A.85:  Right, that's true [laughter].

B.86:  We have, uh, we've had real good luck with, uh, and again, these are like
volunteer trees that we transplanted from East Texas, but we've got a couple,
uh, well, we did buy one, though, we have a couple of red bud trees.

A.87:  Oh, red bud.

B.88:  And, uh, we've got one of those on our patio.  Uh, we've got a lot of rock
and, and around in our, one area of our patio.  And we brought a, a red bud
tree in, and it has done very well.  It has a, a, a little larger leaf than,
uh, maybe even than a pear tree.  I know it's got larger leaves than a plum
tree has.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  The, the, uh, leaves are probably, uh, oh four inches or so in diameter,
and, uh, you know, makes a pretty good, uh, tree.  I-,

A.91:  That would be a great shade tree then.

B.92:  It has, uh, of course, during the early spring, it has the red, you know,
the red flowers that are really pretty.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  Uh, the only problem with it is it does have a seed pod, uh, you know, a
little, it's a little, flat, bean type seed pod --

A.95:  Um.

B.96:  -- that, uh, will drop off, you know, uh, when, uh, when they start drying
out.  So there's a little bit of clean up work for that.

A.97:  But as long as you mow the grass around, 

B.98:  Yeah, yeah, always it's, uh,

A.99:  well, you said it was around rocks but,

B.100:  W-, with our, in our case, uh, it's fairly close to our swimming pool --

A.101:  Oh.

B.102:  -- and so the, uh, the flowers, uh, uh, blow in there, they don't drop in
but they blow into the swimming pool.  So there's a q-, a good bit of cleanup,
you know, in the swimming pool from that, but it's, you know, it's not too bad
even at that, so.

A.103:  Well, that's just in the springtime, too, isn't it?

B.104:  Right, and, uh, but, uh, yeah, we, we've really enjoyed that.  Uh, the live
oak tree that we have, uh, is in the front, and of course the live oak is, uh,
it's susceptible to bending by the wind.  I-, it, it leans away from the
predominant wind direction.

A.105:  Oh.

B.106:  And I think, I think you'll find that.  Uh, we also have an apple tree, uh,
in our side yard, and it does the same thing.  The, the southwestern w-, -ly
winds which are predominant, you know, during the growing season, make both of
those trees lean,

A.107:  [Laughter].

B.108:  toward the northeast.  

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  And, uh, so, it's, but that's, uh, the live oak tree, that's, you'll find
that, uh, pretty much anywhere that there are, if there's a grove of live oaks
growing, they're going to be leaning away from the, you know, the direction of
the wind.

A.111:  Oh, that's interesting, get to know all these things.

B.112:  Uh, if you, if you go down along the, uh, Texas coast, there a lot of them
grow, you know, down there, and you'll see them.  And there'll just be like
twenty-five or thirty of them, growing real close together and they'll all,
every one of them, be leaning away from w-, --

A.113:  [Laughter]  Leaning away from,

B.114:  -- away from the, from the water, mostly.

A.115:  Well, that's interesting. 

B.116:  Yeah [throat_clearing]. 

A.117:  Yeah, I know that, um, we've done some other things with the grass and
trying to, you know, get the right combination of grass here --

B.118:  Right.  The, uh, 

A.119:  -- because it's,

B.120:  What kind of grasses are you growing?

A.121:  Well, we s-, ours was a model house --

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  -- so when they set it up they had like these cement walkways across the
front yard,

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  and they had planted bermuda, and then when they took the cement walkways
out, they stuck in, um, wh-, what is that, Saint Augustine stuff.

B.126:  Saint Au-, right.

A.127:  And I am a transplant here from the north myself, and so when I saw that
Saint Augustine, I said, Oh, weeds.  And I spent, I mean, weeks, just pulling
it up, bag by bag --

B.128:  Um.

A.129:  -- until I went to the nursery one day and found out they were selling it
by plugs, you know --

B.130:  [Laughter]  Right.  Yeah [laughter].

A.131:  -- and I could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of
stuff I'd thrown out.  So, we're trying to, um, a-, after this winter, we had
a lot of winter kill, and hopefully, you know, some of the Bermuda will take
over and --

B.132:  Right.

A.133:  -- because I really like that grass.

B.134:  Yeah, what you, what you will find, uh, with the Saint Augustine grass is
it's very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms.

A.135:  Yeah, that, yeah, grubs.

B.136:  You know, uh, the, the grub worm is the larva of the, uh, June beetle --

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  -- the June bug beetle, and, uh, the grub worms, uh, in the late spring,
uh, the, the beetles come in and, and they lay their eggs in the grass, and
then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at
the roots.

A.139:  Ri-,

B.140:  The eats the roots of the grass off.  And, uh, w-, we had Saint Augustine,
uh, in, uh, our yard before, before we, the house we were in before.  And one
year all the Saint Augustine in our backyard,
