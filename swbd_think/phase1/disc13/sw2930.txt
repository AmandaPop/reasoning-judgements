=============================================================================

A.1:  There a lot of places to camp in Dallas?

B.2:  Well, not necessarily in Dallas, but it's a very short drive to areas near
here. 

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Do you do a lot of camping?

B.4:  Well, I have done camping in the past.  Uh, I can't remember when the last
time I actually went camping was.  It was, uh, several years ago, and then I
did most of my camping in the mountains.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Well, that must have been fun though. 

B.6:  Well, it is.  I enjoy hiking and camping.  We went to the (( )). I have,
uh, some land there, and so it's, it's handy to, to station yourself there on
the land --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking
and, and overnight camping.

A.9:  Well, that sounds fun. 

B.10:  Do you do most of yours in tents?

A.11:  Yeah, we've done ours, I've only been camping twice. 

B.12:  Oh, wow. 

A.13:  And one of them I don't really consider camping. 

B.14:  Um. 

A.15:  It was on the edge of the lake and it was at a camp.  I don't like those
camping grounds --

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  -- where, you know, you got R V beside you and then another people in tents
beside you. 

B.18:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.19:  # I # just don't care for that. 

B.20:  No, I agree with you.  I think it's much nicer when you can really get out
far enough away where,

A.21:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.22:  # that # you can't see people --

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  -- [Laughter] right out the window.  But,

A.25:  Well, it doesn't, uh, we, uh, four years ago, it was about four years ago,
my little boy was three months old and the first time I left him we went
overnight camping.

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  And we went, and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of
nowhere by the lake.  And we had a ball.

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  Just sat out there with our, we didn't even use tents then, we just had,
uh, sleeping bags --

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  -- and fire going.  And we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for
breakfast the next morning. 

B.32:  Doesn't that always taste so much better,

A.33:  # Oh, it did, it did.  #

B.34:  # when you're out like that.  # Yeah. 

A.35:  I didn't even think about frying potatoes.  But my sister-in-law, she's
always done a lot of camping. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  And she's good.  She'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your
area out.  And, yeah.

B.38:  That's right.  If you don't you'll find every rock on it when you --

A.39:  Uh-huh. 

B.40:  -- put your [laughter], when you put your bag down. 

A.41:  Well, sh-, yeah, she was, she is always prepared, I mean, she brought
everything from, like I said, toilet paper to the rake.  The only thing we'd
had to do, we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill, you know.

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  We, and we, and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped --

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  -- and we broke the, I guess it's the freezing component --

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  -- and we broke that out of there and put it over our, um, hole. 

B.48:  Oh, what a clever idea --

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  -- I wouldn't have thought about that. 

A.51:  Well, it held our pan and, you know, the potatoes and stuff.  We had a good
time. 

B.52:  Oh, that's a good idea. 

A.53:  Yeah, we're still waiting to go again. 

B.54:  Uh-huh.  Well if you get a chance, now there are some really nice camping
areas, uh, up in the Wichitas, which is in Oklahoma --

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  -- and, uh, Arkansas. 

A.57:  Arkansas. 

B.58:  I can't remember the name.  It's, it's on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And it won't take but just a, you know, just a quick look at a map to find
where those mountains are,

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # but # I took a drive up through there, as a matter of fact, last
September, just took the drive through to see what was there.

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  They have some wonderful camping areas there. 

A.65:  Pretty. 

B.66:  Beautiful, beautiful country. 

A.67:  Well, I love to swim, so I like to get out by a lake --

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  -- or a, uh, you know, somewhere close --

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  -- where we can swim. 

B.72:  Right, well, Lake, Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place --

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  -- and we had a two bedroom mobile home there, but the boys still liked to
throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and --

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  -- build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit
--

A.77:  Yeah. 

B.78:  -- and then they came in. 

A.79:  How old are your boys?

B.80:  Oh, oh they're grown now. 

A.81:  Oh, so they don't go camping with you. 

B.82:  They go camping on their own. 

A.83:  Oh. 

B.84:  Once you start them, they enjoy it all their lives. 

A.85:  Yeah, well, I haven't taken my little boy yet. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  I'm afraid to get him out.  He is so fearless, he, it terrifies me. 

B.88:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.89:  He,

B.90:  Oh, don't be concerned.  There's much less for them to get hurt on camping
than there is elsewhere.

A.91:  Think so?

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  Well, it's the water he's not scared of.  He'll go out into it until it's
up to his nose --

B.94:  Uh-huh. 

A.95:  -- and then try to ((tread)) back [laughter]. 

B.96:  Uh-huh.  Well, it's easy to keep him occupied though on land.  I know that
I took my kids, we'd go out, and I've them walk with me along the lakefront --

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  -- and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell, and finding
the biggest shell.  And, or we'd hunt pine cones --

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  -- or we climbed some, uh, pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so
that we could eat the pine nuts. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  And, we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out.  We, you know, we,

A.103:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.104:  # we # searched for (( )) and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild
berries, and, uh, it's really, you know --

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  -- the, the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find. 

A.107:  If you know what to look for. 

B.108:  Uh-huh.  I had my boys build their own little c-, you know, three leg camp
stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark. 

A.109:  Well, that sounds so neat. 

B.110:  And, uh, we cooked in a pot.  I baked them a cake, right there on a camp
fire.  They were so impressed. 

A.111:  Yeah. 

B.112:  I used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven. 

A.113:  Well, I'm impressed [laughter]. 

B.114:  [Laughter]. 

A.115:  My mother-in-law and my, well, they've always done a lot of camping.  I
grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and there wasn't, I don't know, but we just
didn't get out.  My mother and my father split up when we were young, so, and
my mother wasn't into that, and that's who I stayed with.

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  So we didn't do much outdoors stuff, except swimming --

B.118:  Uh-huh. 

A.119:  -- and we went swimming a lot. 

B.120:  Uh-huh. 

@@A.121:  And, uh, oh, excuse me, my baby's getting sick. 

B.122:  Uh-oh. 

A.123:  I know. 

B.124:  Well, if our time is up we can quit. 

A.125:  Yeah, um, I've got to clean her up [laughter].  I'm sorry, appreciate it. 

B.126:  Okay.  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  I enjoyed talking.  Thank you. 

B.128:  You bet, bye-bye. 

A.129:  Bye-bye.
