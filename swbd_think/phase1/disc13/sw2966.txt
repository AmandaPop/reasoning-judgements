REMARKS:	Callers start talking about the switchboard in the middle
and then go back to current events.

============================================================================

@A.1:  [Clicking] What type of news media do you prefer for keeping up with
current events?

B.2:  Okay, normally I watch, uh, T V.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Okay.  

B.4:  Uh, usually twice a day.

A.5:  The news shows themselves, or, uh, like network news or national, or, 
uh,

B.6:  Oh, basically network news.  Was it, 

A.7:  Okay, how about shows like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES, or, or TWENTY TWENTY?

B.8:  Once in a while depending what I think's going to come on when they put on
the previews.

A.9:  Yeah, I kind of watch for, uh, what, what they're going to cover on SIXTY
MINUTES.  If it's not, if it doesn't look interesting, uh, pass on that
[laughter]. 

B.10:  Yeah, that's about what I do.  But, uh, usually I hit the headlines when I
walk by book stores or anything else on papers.  But I normally don't buy
newspapers.

A.11:  Yeah, I'll only get the newspaper a couple of days a week.  But, uh, I get
a lot of calls from, uh, the MORNING NEWS and the TIMES HERALD where they want
to sell me the paper at a special rate, [laughter] but, uh, no, I'll only read
it on, on Fridays and Sundays typically.

B.12:  Fridays and Sundays.  Why Friday?

A.13:  Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper
[laughter].

B.14:  Oh!  Okay, Sunday's usually my big one.

A.15:  Yeah, I get the Sunday paper because of the T V schedule.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  But I'll flip through and see what, read the headlines, see what's new.

B.18:  Yeah, I enjoy just point blank reading basically the headlines and I go
especially if I've seen something one way or the other, and I hit the T V to
find out actually what's going on around here.

A.19:  Yeah, I, I don't listen to the radio for news.  That's strictly for
entertainment while I'm driving to and from work.

B.20:  Oh, it's same way here.

A.21:  And for waking up in the morning.  Have to set the alarm.  Whatever news
they cover they usually read out of the newspaper that day.

B.22:  What about when, um, Desert Storm was on?

A.23:  Oh, I thought C N N was great [laughter],

B.24:  D-, 

A.25:  but, uh, I was glued to the T V all during that time, watching C N N but
after, after it was over I haven't even tuned in to C N N since.

B.26:  Yeah, well see I had the radio going on ((that)) almost all the time,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  especially between jobs on that.  And that's when I hit the radio, but
when they stopped, I stopped.

A.29:  Yeah, there has to be absolutely nothing else on T V before I turn on C N
N, usually.

B.30:  But, uh, now I like, see I usually I hit the six o'clock and usually the
ten, but, uh, sometimes I have to search on ten because they get boring.  They
pick up the same thing on six, so I usually have to search to see if
anything is come up or not.

A.31:  Yeah, uh, I'll catch, uh, some of these news briefs that they have, say at
the top of the hour in the evening --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- and they'll mention the subject and say they have details at ten.  I
hate it when they do that because I usually don't catch the news at ten
o'clock and they don't fill you in at that time on, uh, what's going on.  Even
though it's something interesting that you may want to watch.

B.34:  Do you ever discuss at work?

A.35:  Um, yeah, usually with the people I work with, uh, uh, we don't talk too
much about the news but if something comes up, uh, yeah, it's a topic for
discussion at the lunch table.

B.36:  Now, see usually when I was working at T I we hit about eight o'clock in
the morning we all just c-, (( )) what was news and coming up and all so, we
ju-, hack it out between all of us,

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  one way or the other, but, uh.

A.39:  No, we don't discuss too much, uh, too much news except for at lunch,
unless there are rumors a-, for pertaining to layoffs or company business,
things of that nature.

B.40:  Well ours was kind of strange because we'd hit, um, since we were all
females, and, uh, we'd hit either the blacks, because two of us were black,
o-, one, two, three, four of us are white.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And so, it would be a cross between all of it going in together and, uh, I
really enjoyed that.  I really enjoyed that because we got a cross section
of viewpoints.

A.43:  Yeah yo-, --

B.44:  And it was fascinating in the morning so we ended up getting there, well,
we were all there, usually by seven thirty.

A.45:  -- you get a lot of different perspectives that way.

B.46:  It wa-, it was fascinating, it really was.  I really enjoyed it and I
think everyone else did, otherwise we wouldn't keep doing it every morning,
bu-,

A.47:  Uh-huh.  Do you get any news magazines?

B.48:  No.

A.49:  Okay, I don't get any news magazines but I do get a, uh, a photography
magazine that does have a lot of photo journalism in it which is interesting.

B.50:  Oh, that would be interesting.

A.51:  Instead of reading about the news, you get to look at the pictures.

B.52:  I'm not, uh, I don't seem to find time to read too much, except of the
stuff I'm studying right now.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  But, uh, news wise, that way, no.  But I have realized most of mine, uh,
from the T V, I think has increased watching the news.

A.55:  Okay.

B.56:  Since, since the war.

A.57:  Yeah, yeah, I think the coverage has gotten better.  Are, are you real
satisfied with the T V news coverage?  [Barking].

B.58:  Um.

A.59:  Are there other things that you'd like them to, to spend more time on.
They're, they're very limited.  They have half hour to pr-, provide all the
news, weather, sports and what not.  And, uh, most of the major stories are
the same across all the ne-, major networks, but, uh, they do have, uh, uh,
scoops and specific stories that, um, I'll say one network that another one
won't cover.

B.60:  Well see I'm like, as I said, I pick up on SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY TWENTY,
usually my favorite is SIXTY MINUTES.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  And I'll pick up on them and find out what they're going to see and then
I'll pick up the rest of the s-, stories like that,

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  and get into like that, but, not, uh, {pause} most of the time if a
really interesting one thing or another I'll go a little bit further, but
usually it's, I just don't have the time.

A.65:  Yeah, I think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage,
although, uh, T V, networks and, uh, there are radio stations that, uh
specifically cater to the news. 

B.66:  But I can understand now why some of the newspaper's circulation has gone
down, because it's so much easier to watch the T V and keep at least ninety
percent abreast and watching, you know, reading the newspaper, and forget it.

A.67:  Yeah, well it's like I read a lot at work and I really have to make an
effort to read anything when I get home.  I think that's why, uh, uh, reading
newspaper suffers to watching T V, and T V is more entertaining, uh, it, uh,
[laughter] usually have it on all the time when I'm at home, whether I'm
watching it or not.

B.68:  Well I got tired with newspapers because I seem to stack them up without
reading them.

A.69:  Yeah, um,

B.70:  That's why I stopped [laughter].

A.71:  that's, uh, that's a weekly chore.  Get rid of the old newspapers that
haven't been read [barking].

B.72:  I found out when I got the newspaper that it, I'd read the headlines,
front page, and maybe through a couple other sections and then I start packing
them up and I'm going, I never read this, 

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  what am I, you know, why even subscribe to it when I'm not reading it.

A.75:  Well I get the Sunday paper tomorrow and I'll pull out the T V section and
put that aside and I get out the sports section and read that and then I start
clipping coupons and if I have any time, uh, later in the week to read the
rest of it, I may pick it up and, uh, glance at it, but, uh, I usually don't
scan it cover to cover.  

B.76:  Well see like when they have that recycle program on, was it save the
earth, save America, I think what it was.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  I watched that twice, I recorded that,

A.79:  Huh.

B.80:  because there were some things in there I wanted that I hadn't written
down so I had recorded that.

A.81:  That's interesting.

B.82:  But you can't find that in the newspaper.

A.83:  No.

B.84:  But see I take that as far as my concern, that's news to me.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  Because I enjoy something like that, but, uh.  I wonder about the rest of
the world in itself.  How much they get, or how much, I talk to people that I
work with at night now and the younger group, they don't watch too much.

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  They don't even see it but I think they're being raised watching T V more
than newspapers.

A.89:  Yeah, I believe that's true.

B.90:  So I wish they'd put a little bit more depth in some of their stories.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well (( )) that's, that, gets back to what I was saying
before about, uh, the, say the network news coverage.  They only have so much
time to provide so much, uh, coverage of the news and they can't get very in
depth in the with the, within the limitations of the time that they have to
present it.

B.92:  I think they could use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a
little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the
time.

A.93:  Well, sure, but, uh, you're talking about, uh, sensationalism here that you
have to report the news and typically news is, is, uh, or ty-, the types of
events that, uh, shock people or, uh, uh, major crimes, uh, court cases,
things of that nature and most, uh, it's just a fact that most things that
make news are, are bad types of occurrences, they aren't, uh, positive in
nature.

B.94:  Well that's too, true to a degree, if they can put a complete half hour T
V program on of what police have done to, um, or fireman, you know, off handed
when they go in and find people or, going down, all, all sorts of things.  You
know what I'm talking about.

A.95:  Yeah.  There is a show on,

B.96:  [Laughter] Sorry about that.

A.97:  there is a show on, in fact, it was on tonight at eight o'clock called
COPS.

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  Have you ever seen that?

B.100:  I've seen parts of it.  That's one of them.

A.101:  That's very, very interesting, 

B.102:  Um.

A.103:  gives you a whole new perspective of the police department.

B.104:  There, there is lots of stories out there about people, what they've done
out of, you know, stop on the highway and stop someone, uh, just because there
was an accident one way or the other.  

A.105:  Right.

B.106:  To me that's positive.

A.107:  Yeah, well I think they actually came up with that to show, not just to,
to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department
because it does show, uh, what positive impact the police have in the society,
not just that they're always there when bad things happen.

B.108:  See, so you wouldn't, see like that's a cop show, fine, but there's
positive in many different areas,

A.109:  Oh yeah.

B.110:   that they could push a little bit more on T V.
