REMARKS:        Speaker A is a fast talker and it is hard to catch his words. 
Speaker B breaths heavy.

============================================================================

A.1:  Well, Pat, what do you wear to work?

B.2:  [Talking] [noise] {in background} [breathing] Well, depends on the day,
[laughter] and what I feel like.  I don't have a, a real, like strict dress
code as far --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- as, you know, suits and everything.  I can wear pretty much what I want
as long as it's decent.

A.5:  [Cough] Yeah.

B.6:  You know, I can wear blue jeans, I can wear a dress, I can dress up --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- so it just depends on the mood I'm in and where I'm going, you know.  If
I got a customer coming in, then I'll dress up.  If not, you know --

A.9:  Yeah.  My, my schedule --

B.10:  -- hey, #blue jeans.#

A.11:  -- #yeah, my# schedule's pretty similar.  I, um, I teach, so on the days I
teach, I teach a couple days a week, so --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- whenever I teach I try and wear a tie.

B.14:  ((Well, that's all ri-,)),

A.15:  But, uh, but that's, I wear, normally just wear like khaki pants and a
shirt and tie.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I never wear a sport coat.  That's ridiculous.  But then,

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  most of the time, you know, then I just have to, uh, I can wear jeans
or, or just casual clothes.  I think they, I think they frown on shorts and
sneakers, but I think, I could probably get away with jeans and sneakers, 
uh, 

B.20:  Oh, we can't even wear shorts.

A.21:  Yeah, I could, well, if I don't have to see students, and, uh, I'm just in
my lab,

B.22:  (( )).

A.23:  and no one sees me, then I'm probably okay.  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Oh, no, shorts are no, no go here.  

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  You can't wear shorts, you can't wear, uh, like halters --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and stuff like that and to me, really, you can't wear anything that's,
uh, outside clothing --

A.29:  #Right, uh-huh.#

B.30:  -- #You know,# like for the summer time.  #And, uh,#

A.31:  #Yeah, well# that makes sense.

B.32:  in the winter time, I guess you can pretty much wear what you want as
long as it's presentable,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  that's what I consider.  You know, just don't get too outrageous here.

A.35:  Yeah, as long as you're clean and yeah.  That makes a lot of sense.

B.36:  And not too dressy, like, you know, after five stuff.  I've nev-, 

A.37:  [Laughter] [noise].

B.38:  Sort of them get sort of touchy, too.  So.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  Th-,

B.40:  And, uh, the women, you see, you have, you can't wear halters or nothing
like that, I mean, at all.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  Like even if you got a jacket on, you got to have a bra on and all that
stuff --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- which no big deal [laughter] to me. 

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  So, but as far as dress for, dressing for work, that, I don't, it doesn't
bother me.  I'd prefer if we had a uniform.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I really would.  To save a lot of money if you had a uniform.

A.49:  Yeah, that would ma-, that would.

B.50:  Because, when I, while I was in the service, and see I had clothes that I
could wear whenever I got ready, but you had to wear that uniform to work, and
so you knew what you was going to wear.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Wasn't no, What am I going to wear today?  [laughter].

A.53:  Yeah, and you don't have to worry about fashion and stuff, too, you know --

B.54:  Nope.

A.55:  -- buying nicer clothes and things.  Yeah --

B.56:  That's right.

A.57:  -- that makes a lot of sense.

B.58:  I wouldn't mind having a uniform.  People think I'm crazy but,

A.59:  [Laughter] Well, you know my mother's a waitress, and she has like three
uniforms --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- that she sort of wears in rotation.

B.62:  That's right.

A.63:  And she likes that, you know. 

B.64:  Yeah, because it, it doesn't mess up your clothes either.

A.65:  Uh-huh, yeah, your, your.

B.66:  You know, because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins
it, its just ruined.

A.67:  Uh-huh, that's right.  Where the, the uniform as, as a waitress, now your
uniform really, it might be a little expensive when you first buy it, but, you
know, that's, it doesn't, it's made of polyester so it doesn't stain like
cotton or wool would,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  You know.

B.70:  Well, see, if you work at a fast food, because I work at Wendy's sometime
on the weekend --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and they give you the uniform.  

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  So it, it's supplied --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- so, you know, if it messes up, hey it's their fu-, uniform --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- they messed it up.  You only wear it, you know, to Wendy's --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and so if you mess it up at Wendy's there's no big deal.

A.81:  Yeah, well, that makes sense, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

B.82:  But, you know -- 

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- of course, T I, I'm sure, if they ever went to uniforms they're not
going to just give them to you.

A.85:  [Laughter] That's (( )),

B.86:  [Laughter] But now some of the people around here do wear uniforms, you
know, the facility guys --

A.87:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.88:  -- or maintenance crew and the truck drivers --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- and all of them have, have ((T I un-,)),

A.91:  Uh, probably the people that, probably the people that are prone towards
getting dirty.

B.92:  Yeah, the, yeah, that's what they are, too.

A.93:  Yeah, with the type of job that you have you might be getting dirty,
either, either manual label, labor where you'll perspire heavily --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- or, uh, or where you'll come in contact with, uh, oil and things.

B.96:  Yeah, because they're always in the high #space (( ))# --

A.97:  #Right, uh-huh.#

B.98:  -- you know, working on stuff --

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  -- and all I do is, I sit at a desk and program, but that's not going to
get me dirty.

A.101:  Yeah --

B.102:  [Laughter]  So.

A.103:  -- that's what, yeah.  I find, too, um, if you're a programmer, do you get
cold?  Does your, how's your air conditioning work?

B.104:  Well, mine, it works pretty good. 

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  I have a sweater at work because sometimes it gets chilly --

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  -- and everything, you know, but, uh, but the whole building's like that.
I'm not in a clean room or nothing.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  So. 

A.111:  Oh, oh, see, yeah, because my office is really heavily air conditioned --

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  -- because, I guess, they, they keep the air conditioning on all the time,
where they don't in a lot of the other offices --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- because of the computers.  And, um,

B.116:  Well, see, I just have my, the whole building is computerized,

A.117:  Right, 

B.118:  okay, 

A.119:  uh-huh.

B.120:  and so it's all air conditioned.

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  But my, my computer is like by my desk --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- and then you go to another cube, and then somebody else's but, uh, the
computer rooms, now they're real cold,

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  and I don't have to work in one of those.

A.127:  Yeah, see, sometimes my air conditioning gets really cold.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  I think it's probably because my office is one of the only ones air
conditioned in a, a large area, you know --

B.130:  #Oh, well then, yeah it's just-,#

A.131:  -- #probably, probably that's# why I get, because sometimes, boy, I'll get,
I'll freeze it's so cold in there,

B.132:  No matter.

A.133:  especially when it's ninety degrees outside.

B.134:  And seems like it kicks in extra hard.

A.135:  Right, yeah, and blows on my legs.  Man one time I left I thought I was
going to, I thought I was going to freeze.  The one day I wore shorts to the
office because I was just going to be in my lab and I wanted to be comfortable
because I thought the air conditioning would be all turned off, you know --

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  -- and jeez, if it wasn't the --

B.138:  #Cold, huh.#

A.139:  -- #air, ((conditioner))# wasn't blowing, it wasn't fifty-five degrees.
Yeah.

B.140:  I think the reason why we can't wear shorts is because then the women and
the men would be in competition.

A.141:  That's true.  A lot of those nice looking legs.

B.142:  See and,

A.143:  Yeah. 

B.144:  then you guys couldn't work [laughter] [noise] {high pitch tone}.

A.145:  [Laughter] Yeah, I was just laughing.  It's funny that, um, we get
clothing, you know, because, uh, I'm, I'm in graduate school.

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  I only work part time.  And my wife, uh, we recently, we decided we'd buy a
sewing machine because that would be a good investment, you know, and we could
make clothes and save money.  So she's made me shorts.

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  Well, of course, you know, she makes shorts and she says, Here I made you
shorts, and they're, they're a nice material, nice checkered, plaid material
here, but, but she didn't put a fly in them [laughter].

B.150:  [Laughter].

A.151:  Yeah, the pattern she bought didn't have a fly.

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  So, it's like, well, they're fine for her, but, uh, you know, they're just
everyday summer shorts, you know, but there's no fly [laughter].

B.154:  [Laughter] You kidding me, those are real good for men to wear, so.

A.155:  Yeah, they're not, for a guy that really changes your, the whole way you do
your day [laughter].

B.156:  That's right.  

A.157:  So I was laughing, I thought that was funny, you know, because while I, I
was up at the office and everybody says, Oh, jeez, those new shorts.  Th-, I
think they were laughing because they are sort of a wild color, you know --

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  -- but I was just crossing through to get my mail #and stuff.#

B.160:  #Now my boss,# now he, he golfs every weekend --

A.161:  Uh-huh.

B.162:  -- so he's got different outfits.  

A.163:  [Laughter].

B.164:  And he cracks me up with these color codes --

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  -- of his aqua colors, and, I tell him, see only people like you on the
golf course wears them colors.

A.167:  [Laughter]. 

B.168:  That's the only place you could probably wear it.

A.169:  That's probably true, without being laughed out (( )).

B.170:  Yeah, #uh-huh.#

A.171:  #Yeah,# I'm not, I never, I laugh at the wardrobe.  My father-in-law wears
golf #clothes# --

B.172:  #Now,#  #oh yeah [/talking] [/noise].#

A.173:  -- #and it's# the only time he puts on those funny clothes.

B.174:  Yep.

A.175:  And he doesn't wear those in the back yard or #casually around,#

B.176:  #No, just when they# go to play golf.

A.177:  Just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes.  That's true.

B.178:  Now I think I B, now I B M has a strict dress code --

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  -- when I, uh, I went to apply for them before I came here, and they men,
they used to have to, they have to wear white shirts.  I don't care what their
job is --

A.181:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.182:  -- they have to wear a suit.  And see, to me, I think that's ridiculous
because you're working with all that xerox machines and stuff like that --

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  -- all that black ink.  Huh-uh, no, give me a break dude.

A.185:  Yeah.

B.186:  No, I think them, them people should be able to wear blue jeans, you know
--

A.187:  Uh-huh.

B.188:  -- because that stuff gets really bad.  

A.189:  Yeah, but they have that dress code.  I, you know, I also know, um, E D S,

B.190:  Yeah, 

A.191:  Uh, #E D S.#

B.192:  #they have# a dress.

A.193:  I have some friends that interviewed with E D S, and, uh, you know, they
interviewed while they were in college, so they didn't really have a suit with
them --

B.194:  Uh-huh.

A.195:  -- and the woman said to them, Well, your second interview would be here,
but, du-, du-, du-, du-, oh, and on that day, I would say wear a suit, because
I guess they just had on a sport coat.

B.196:  Uh-huh.

A.197:  And the one guy even had like, um, a gel in his hair, you know, his hair
was sort of slicked back --

B.198:  Yeah.

A.199:  -- you know, which is popular with the kids --

B.200:  Yeah.

A.201:  -- and she says, Oh, and, you know, uh, I wouldn't put the gel in my hair,
you know.  In other words you're to bore us, a two or three piece suit with no
gel in your hair, you know, and that way --

B.202:  Yeah.

A.203:  -- she made it pretty clear during the inter-, you know, the first
interview, how they were supposed to dress for the second interview, you know.

B.204:  God.

A.205:  So I thought that was really funny, too, you know.

B.206:  I don't think that should be, your hair --

A.207:  Uh-huh.

B.208:  -- I mean, yeah, I guess so, because some people do get wild with their
hair --

A.209:  Uh-huh.

B.210:  -- you know, with these haircuts now [laughter].

A.211:  [Laughter].

B.212:  Some of these haircuts, boy, I tell you, I don't know.

A.213:  I don't think my hair has probably changed in ten years.  

B.214:  It's funny, because my son is fifteen --

A.215:  Uh-huh.

B.216:  -- and he's into this fading crap, you know [laughter].

A.217:  He, he's into what?

B.218:  The fade, like, he looks like #no hair# --

A.219:  #Uh, oh really?#

B.220:  -- wait a minute, and so he has hair though.

A.221:  Uh-huh.

B.222:  He can, I can only let him fade it a little bit.  I tell him he's got to
have hair all over or none, one or the other, you're not going to be going
around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head,

A.223:  [Laughter].

B.224:  and people's names carved in your head, and no, no.

A.225:  [Laughter].

B.226:  Uh-huh.  You're not going no where with me, he's not.

A.227:  [Laughter] Yeah, I see them, I see the kids with the, the things cut in
their hair all the time.

B.228:  I told him, No, no, huh-uh, we can't have that.

A.229:  [Laughter].

B.230:  I'm not one of them liberated parents, I guess, I don't know.

A.231:  [Laughter] Well, tha-, you know, my dad was the same way.  I thought it was
really funny back in the nineteen seventies, my brother came home with cowboy
boots on.

B.232:  Yeah.

A.233:  (( )) was growing up in Pittsburgh.  And my dad called my brother Tex for
about the next four weeks.

B.234:  Uh-huh.

A.235:  You know, and other than calling him Tex, he barely talked to him because
he was so angry he was wearing cowboy boots [laughter].

B.236:  Well, down here, that's no big deal.

A.237:  Yeah, I thought it was just so funny, you know.  My dad, we're not in
Texas.

B.238:  [Laughter].

A.239:  [Laughter] It was very funny, you know, and all that over a pair of cowboy
boots, and it was finally my mother convinced him, she, you know, the cowboy
boots give you about, uh, an inch lift, you know, they sort of have a heavier
heel --

B.240:  Yeah [/breathing].

A.241:  -- and she, and we're all short, the whole family's short, so she said,
Well Sam, if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may 
be,
