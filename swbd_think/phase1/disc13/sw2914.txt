============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay.  Well what are your hobbies?

B.2:  Oh, they range from, {pause} from, from needlepoint to, uh, anything in the
hobby field as far as, um, needlework is concerned.  I've had to give it up
recently because, um, I've got problems with, uh, nerves in my right hand.
But basically, it's anything in that hobby line, I'll try anything, including
making, uh, earrings.

A.3:  Um.  That sounds interesting.

B.4:  I have no love of yard work for hobby work though.  How about you?

A.5:  Well, uh, my, I've got some fairly bizarre but, uh, I do a lot of flying,
aerobatics, for one.

B.6:  Oh, fantastic.

A.7:  [Laughter] Which a lot of people don't do.  And, uh, woodworking.  I d-, I
do enjoy doing some landscaping type stuff.  I b-, I li-, I enjoy working with
wood and stuff like that, building decks, gazebos, those types of things.

B.8:  Oh.

A.9:  So.  But, uh, probably if I had to say my most favorite one was probably
be, uh, flying.

B.10:  I've been in a, uh, glider which, as a student pi-, pilot, I loved it
immensely.

A.11:  Did you, oh, you actually tried it before?

B.12:  #As a student pilot.#

A.13:  #As a student pilot?#

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  How long did you do it?

B.16:  Uh, I was only in one, one trip.

A.17:  [Throat_clearing].

B.18:  Something I would have liked to have kept up, but we moved out of Colorado,
so, [door] that was, you know, that ended that point.  But, yeah, that, I'll
try, as far as you could say hobby, then, I'll try anything that's unusual
that I've never done once.

A.19:  Um.

B.20:  Just to find out what it's like, the experience, oh, as, but that's not a
constant hobby, you know, like I'll do, uh, oh I'll pick up normally a petit
point or anything in stitchery type of line.  And if I'm really bored, I'll
even pick up something and color it.  But I do a lot designing also.

A.21:  Um.  Well, needlepoint looks pretty.  I, I think, you know, if it's done
real, real, you know, if its done right it looks really good.

B.22:  Well, I've done a petit point, which is [talking] really extremely hard
and, uh, that was very difficult for me, it took me, oh I think that almost
took me a year and a half to finish that.

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  And petit point is like, if you've seen regular needlepoint, it's one half
of that in the stitches, and it goes down like real small, little tiny, it's
exactly what it says, petit point.

A.25:  Boy, that's tedious.

B.26:  Yes, it was tedious.  I dropped it, as I said, it took me about a year and
a half, because it's not something I could continuously do.  But now I'm into
more, uh, taking something that I like and trying to actually put it onto
paper myself --

A.27:  Um.

B.28:  -- which I find more enjoyment.  That's got a lot of math to it at that
point.

A.29:  What type of scenes do you do?

B.30:  Uh, this last one, I'm trying to do a house.  There's a house here in
Plano, actually it's a real estate office, but it has, it's, oh, I would say
it, every section of this real estate office is a different type of a
structure.  It goes from almost, um, castle looking on one side to a very old
fashioned look on the other side.  And it just varies in each little section
of this real estate office.  And I think they did it because of that purpose.
It is a real estate office.  But it fascinates me the way they've done it.
And it's, it looks good.  It's all done in brick.  The windows even vary on
it.  And that,

A.31:  Um.

B.32:  It really fascinates me.  So I've sat across the street from it, and I've
tried to put it down on the paper now.

A.33:  I've been over to Plano quite a few times, my brother lives over there, and
I've yet to see anything like that over there.

B.34:  It's on, um,

A.35:  [Throat_clearing].

B.36:  let's see, Fifteenth and, uh, Park.

A.37:  Oh, okay, so it's, it's on the other side. 

B.38:  Well, I live right around here.  But it's not, if you drive by it, you
don't notice it, because its all brick, there's no difference in the front,
except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look
at it.

A.39:  Um.

B.40:  That's why it fascinates me.  But, uh, again, you know, I'd like to be able
to go ahead and take that some day and actually make a house of my own.

A.41:  Well, that's pretty neat though.  I wou-, I mean, I wish I had that much
patience to sit down and do something tedious like that, but, after a while it
would just drive me nuts.

B.42:  Well, see, you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo.  Your
playing with numbers {pause}.  That's all this is.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You're putting it on paper.  So, your just playing with numbers.

A.45:  Um.

B.46:  It's like, I would love to play with work, but I don't have the strength in
my hands any more to do anything like that.  But I've put up, uh, like, um, a
wall board, fixed a bedroom and put in a bath.

A.47:  I like thing-, I like, I like building furniture probably the best.  That,
that sort of thing.  When I have the equipment and, and the place to set it
up.  I like things that are difficult to do.  I like to see if I can do it.
Back when, when I was in college I took lots of wood courses and then I, I
even did it after I was out of college, I continued to do it, and I built just
about every stick of furniture in my house.  Everything from dining furniture
to armoire to the whole nine yards.  Takes a long long time to do all that
stuff.

B.48:  Yeah, I have a small miter box, uh, for hobby mitering.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And it does the same thing, what you're saying, but I'd like to, which I've
been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby, which because I'm
having difficulties with this, is to go into, uh, I'm sure you've seen it, is
those wood, uh, {pause} oh, they're, they're wood pictures on the wall, but if
one move, if one part moves, it counterparts the other parts, and so like it's
a continuous counterpart around it, and it's all made out of wood.

A.51:  Um.

B.52:  And I have, as I said, I have a miniature, uh, miter box which is made for
hobby works, and I've had that for quite a few years now, but I haven't really
gone into that part.  I've been thinking about making, um, oh, ladders and
everything for my, uh, pocket parrot, because they're hard to find, toys for a
pocket parrot.  They make them for parrots, and they make them for cockatiels.
And a pocket parrot's between the two, and so I need rings that are exactly
between those two sizes, so I'm going to, I've got some designs for, I go into
the pet stores, but you can say, again, another hobby I've got is my birds.
So [door],

A.53:  Birds.

B.54:  Um?

A.55:  Birds.

B.56:  I have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot.

A.57:  Oh, those are interesting.

B.58:  {Pause} But, um, other than that.

A.59:  Which ones talk?  Do, do the, do they talk?

B.60:  Uh, Sam, uh, cockatiel talks, he whistles at me and says Good morning.  Uh,
he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel I had.  The pocket
parrot is a very quiet bird.  It's an extremely tame bird.  It's, uh, if
you're real gentle with it, when you buy it, he'll come out and sit on your
shoulder with no problem.

A.61:  Um.

B.62:  Yeah, they're a very, very tender bird.

A.63:  About the only thing I had when I was growing up was probably a parakeet
and canary.  And, uh, we could let it out and fly around the house a little
bit, and, uh, oh, they wouldn't really, you know, didn't really want you to
pick them up, per se, but, you know, when I did, they didn't, they didn't give
me a lot of trouble.

B.64:  Well, see, when I was, oh, about, I guess about ten years ago, fifteen
years ago, I don't know if it's been that long.  I took my dog, my cat and my
bird into the vet at the same time.

A.65:  [Laughter] Boy, I bet that was interesting.

B.66:  And he was just sitting there.  He goes, Carol, you're the only one I know
of that does this.  And I go, What's the problem, because I never thought
about it.  I had never thought one thing at all about it.  And of course the
dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage.

A.67:  Um.

B.68:  And, uh, my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from
underneath his wing.  And he, uh, finally said, Well, you ought to get it a
mate.  But the bird turned around and bit him.  He was furious.  He was so mad
at me.  But, yeah, he had a picture of my birds sitting on top of the cage
with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat
walking underneath the cage.  So he just loved it, he just absolutely adored
it.

A.69:  That's unbelievable.  I would never have thought that, you know, they would
leave you alone without trying to attack each other.

B.70:  Well, the one large cat that I still have, uh, he took claw marks and put
it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a bird rack that we set
up outside for birds,

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  going after the birds.  And then he'd get down and,

A.73:  [Throat_clearing].

B.74:  jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels
out on top of the cage.  I'd get so mad at that cat, because I didn't realize
what he was doing until I saw these big claw marks going down my drapes, from
his back claws.

A.75:  Yeah, that nice expensive.

B.76:  Yeah, I didn't think, I didn't appreciate too much.  I mean, it's rather, I
thought it was rather funny, here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting
right next to him but,

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  I mean the birds were out, they weren't in the cage.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  They were out, I never left them in.  So.

A.81:  Huh.

B.82:  I thought, but I still have that cat.  In fact I have both cats, which are
my kids' cats.  But the birds are in here with the cats.  They don't care.
They keep an eye on any cat that walks outside, but they don't care about
these cats.

A.83:  Oh, they get used to each other.

B.84:  I don't know what it is.  I've seen,

A.85:  Guess they know they have to live together, so they may as well make the
best of it.

B.86:  I've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way.  I mean, I've seen
that dog, my son's dog, open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally
around the cat's head.  And,
