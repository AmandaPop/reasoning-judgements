REMARKS:   The first spoken comment heard on the recording is Speaker B 
saying, "Well."  Buzz throughout recording.  On Speaker A side of 
recording a child interrupted the conversation several times. 

=========================================================================

B.1:  Well [laughter]. 

A.2:  Well, what kind of music did you all listen to? [Buzz]. 

B.3:  Oh, my goodness.  Now see, we think of classic rock that they, you know,
have on all the easy listening stations now --

A.4:  Uh-huh. 

B.5:  -- as our heart and soul.  I mean it was, that is a really good question
because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles.  I mean we
were there. 

A.6:  No, now, well then you was, in the, uh, or, I am sorry,

B.7:  # Yeah.  I was, #

A.8:  # I am going # to make you sound like you're --

B.9:  Well, I was,

A.10:  -- # eighty something.  #

B.11:  # I was in # seventh grade when the Beatles came out. 

A.12:  # Okay, #

B.13:  # I # was --

A.14:  Woodstock. 

B.15:  -- fourteen years old. 

A.16:  What was,

B.17:  # Woodstock? #

A.18:  # yeah, # what was you doing during Woodstock?

B.19:  Well, I wanted to go.  I was in Chicago.  And I guess I was close to
eighteen or something.  I, I, it was like, I think, the summer between my, uh,
high school and college.  Somewhere around in there. 

A.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.21:  # I # can't quite remember the year.  And, uh,

A.22:  You would have had a ball. 

B.23:  Uh, yeah. 

A.24:  I, I kind of liked, would have liked to have been there. 

B.25:  We could not, we could not get it together to drive.  I mean, you know, we
had never driven outside of, you know,

A.26:  # Yeah.  #

B.27:  # ten # miles out of town at that time.  And here we were all hep to go to
Woodstock, you know. 

A.28:  [Laughter]  Don't you wish you had been able to, though?

B.29:  I really do.  You,

A.30:  Oh, that would have been such a great memory. 

B.31:  It would have been incredible.  I, I think of, uh, you know, all the,
social changes that were going on around that time.  And,

A.32:  # Yeah.  #

B.33:  # and # the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of
raising people's consciousness.  Everything from, well, I mean, I remember we
had the first Earth Day back then, you know,

A.34:  # Yeah.  #

B.35:  # we # got out of school at, at, uh, the university, and we celebrated
Earth Day.

A.36:  You went and planted a tree or something?

B.37:  Yeah.  Planted trees and stuff, and we did not realize, you know, the
implications of all that then,

A.38:  # Uh-huh.  Well, #

B.39:  # and a # lot of the stuff that goes on --

A.40:  well,

B.41:  -- # today.  #

A.42:  # growing up # with, [child_talking]  when I grew up, it just was not, we
did not have any causes. 

B.43:  Well,

A.44:  To me it didn't, doesn't seem like we have got much, you know what I mean?

B.45:  Well, you do.  You'll, y-, I mean there w-, there was no name to it.  It
was everything that was started in the sixties.  You --

A.46:  Yeah. 

B.47:  -- had, you had to fight for racial equality. 

A.48:  Well, I do remember demonstrations over busing. 

B.49:  And busing themsel-,

A.50:  Yeah. 

B.51:  It was like just a continuum.  You know, everything sort of had a seed in
the sixties. 

A.52:  Yeah {faintly}.

B.53:  And women's rights, I mean, things for women were totally different for you
by that time. 

A.54:  Yeah.  Well, right.  By the time I was born, even now, you know, women's
rights, uh, we just,

B.55:  # You just assume.  #

A.56:  # we are totally # equal now.  There is not really a lot to fight over.
Now I saw something on T V last night on TWENTY-TWENTY.  You know, men's, uh,
fathers or daddies, now wait a minute, Daddies Are People Too.

B.57:  Yeah. 

A.58:  It is about a lot of men, you know, all right, going through divorces.  The
judge will usually, uh, give custody to the mother ninety-seven percent of the
time.  Because they go through the female. 

B.59:  Yeah.  Well, we learned --

A.60:  Uh,

B.61:  -- from KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, didn't we? [Laughter]. 

A.62:  Yeah [laughter].  Something like that.  But it does seem, you know,

B.63:  It seems unfair. 

A.64:  Yeah.  It really does. 

B.65:  But it, see men are coming into their own --

A.66:  Yeah. 

B.67:  -- now too. 

A.68:  They are, well, I thought about that.  I thought well, now men, you know,
have to fight to be equal.  And I think that is only right though, really.
He, one guy said the judge looked at him and said, "Well, now, Mister So and
So," he says, "I have never seen, uh, calves follow a bull.  They always
follow the heifer."

B.69:  [Laughter]. 

A.70:  "That is why I always," he said, "That is why I always give custody to the
mama."  And he said, "Well," he said, "does that mean you are going to shoot
them if they break a leg and,

B.71:  [Laughter]. 

A.72:  you know, butcher them if they get fat?" He said, "My kids are my
cattle." 

B.73:  Yeah. 

A.74:  You know.  But that, that is the way most people feel, that women should
get custody.

B.75:  Well, are you married and do you have children?

A.76:  Yeah.  I am married and I have got two kids. 

B.77:  Two kids.  And, and how does your husband respond to all the new,

A.78:  [Baby_crying]. 

B.79:  social, uh, changes?

A.80:  My husband is not a conformist at all. 

B.81:  [Laughter]. 

A.82:  He is still back there in the seventies [laughter]. 

B.83:  Well, see,

A.84:  [Laughter].  

B.85:  bless his heart, you know [laughter]. 

A.86:  [Laughter]  Well, I mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jea-, not bell
bottoms but,

B.87:  [Laughter]. 

A.88:  flared pants.  And he, well I do not like them but,

B.89:  # They are # -- 

A.90:  # you know, to # him,

B.91:  -- going to be back in style any day now. 

A.92:  Yeah.  Any day now [laughter].  Well, he just, you know, he is, he is his
own person.  He,

B.93:  # Oh.  #

A.94:  # you # know, he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes, but he
wears what clothes he wants to.  Which we are both that way.  If something is
out of style, I do not really care.  If I like it I am going to wear it. 

B.95:  Yeah. 

A.96:  But, uh, my husband is not a conformist at all [laughter]. 

B.97:  Oh.  Well see, that, that is the spirit of the sixties.  And whether we are
talking about the rain forests. 

A.98:  Uh-huh. 

B.99:  I tell you, you know, the situation you have right now and, and all of our
generations is what to do with the children.  Because both mother and father
have to work now. 

A.100:  Well, uh, we are trying to keep away from that.  My husband works for the
railroad. 

B.101:  Oh, okay. 

A.102:  We have got it real tight.  But I have got a four month old baby, and I do
not want to work.  I want to tend to her. 

B.103:  That's,

A.104:  I want to raise my kids. 

B.105:  That's, see, that is your commitment. 

A.106:  Uh-huh. 

B.107:  You do not know what you are changing when you do something like that. 

A.108:  Well,

B.109:  You do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent. 

A.110:  Right.  Well, when he grew up, he grew up with his, we both grew up with
single mothers. 

B.111:  Uh. 

A.112:  And my mom had six kids. 

B.113:  Uh-huh. 

A.114:  So, she had to work.  And, you know, I was raised by my sisters and stuff. 
And I can, I can't see the difference.  But I know that it would have been
better had Mom been able to stay home with us. 

B.115:  That one person --

A.116:  Right. 

B.117:  -- that you could always count on being there. 

A.118:  Right.  And my husband was the same way.  And we just, I want to raise my
kids.  I do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them. 

B.119:  Well,

A.120:  I want to be there to make sure that, well, they need guidance and they do
need parental guidance --

B.121:  They definitely --

A.122:  -- twenty-four --

B.123:  -- do. 

A.124:  -- hours a day. 

B.125:  They definitely do.  I,

A.126:  Do you stay home with yours?

B.127:  Uh, well, see, I, if I had some I would.  I, I have not, I had an
unfortunate thing happen, and I am, you know, and it is not going to happen
that way.

A.128:  Uh-huh. 

B.129:  But my, my, uh, friends are having babies right and left, so I get to see
the different ways that they,

A.130:  # They raise them.  #

B.131:  # uh, all raise # them.  And, and one gal, she started a business,

A.132:  [Child_talking]. 

B.133:  in her home.  And she, she hired an au pair, which is a college kid to come
in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the
house.

A.134:  Well, but see now,

B.135:  And the guy lives in with her, you know,

A.136:  # Yeah.  #

B.137:  # I # mean, you know, it is a family sort of unit sort of thing and the,

A.138:  {Speaking to child} Okay, sweetie.  Let mommy talk. 

B.139:  And so,

A.140:  Well, I think that's neat. 

B.141:  So that is a different way.  And then my other girlfriend just, you know,
tears her hair out and goes at it, you know, twenty-four hours a day, watching
both kids all the time.  And I think there is a point where you just have to
get away.

A.142:  Right. 

B.143:  And it is good for the kid and it is good for you to develop, you know,
your interest so you do not stop growing --

A.144:  Uh-huh. 

B.145:  -- at the same time. 

A.146:  Well, I know the family is really going through changes.  But now, we are
trying to go back to about the sixties, when the parents, you know, when the
mother was staying at home. 

B.147:  Yeah. 

A.148:  ((Unit)).  Or that, what do they call it, the nuclear family?

B.149:  Yeah. 

A.150:  Yeah.  But, uh, [child_talking]. 

B.151:  Do you have any, uh, do you have your mom or anybody around you that --

A.152:  Uh,

B.153:  -- # helps you? #

A.154:  # well, my family # is Kentucky.  Now my, one of my sisters is down here. 

B.155:  Yeah. 

A.156:  Her husband happened to get a job at T I [child_talking].  They moved out
here, but w-, his family lives here and, my husband was in the service when I
met him. 

B.157:  Uh-huh. 

A.158:  And so we, we've been all over {Speaking to child} Okay, Kyle
[/child_talking].

B.159:  [Laughter]. 

A.160:  Then I, [laughter]  he got a sunburn and he is itching, so I am keep having
to scratch his back. 

B.161:  Oh. 

A.162:  See, uh, {pause} I would love to get a business going out of my home.
Outside of, I mean, going,

B.163:  # Right.  #

A.164:  # yeah.  #

B.165:  Well, that is,

A.166:  I would rather work at home, if I could. 

B.167:  Well, see and, and that is, uh, the sort of the thing of the nineties is --

A.168:  Yeah.  That --

B.169:  -- women --

A.170:  -- is the trend. 

B.171:  -- working out of their own home. 

A.172:  Yeah.  They are bringing offices, I mean, jus-, I mean big businesses into
their home.  Bringing their computers home --

B.173:  Right. 

A.174:  -- and working from there. 

B.175:  And I think, you know, the more we try to, you know, shape that, the more
input we,

A.176:  [Child_talking]. 

B.177:  have into what that whole system is going to look like.  Because that is,
that is our choice now too.  That is,

A.178:  # Well, I think, #

B.179:  # that is our # cause. 

A.180:  I think one that would be, uh, it is, uh, kids could see their parents,
you know, how hard they work,

B.181:  # Yeah.  #

A.182:  # they # would understand more.  When, uh, we first moved down here, I was
working.  I was working a twelve hour shift, and it was three and four days a
week. 

B.183:  Uh-huh. 

A.184:  And, uh,

B.185:  # Um.  #

A.186:  # oh, # my little boy just, he went wild.  You know, I mean because,
because he had been used to me --

B.187:  Being there all --

A.188:  -- being there --

B.189:  -- the time. 

A.190:  -- all the time, yeah. 

B.191:  Yeah. 

A.192:  And he is just now, well, when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work
and decided just to stay at home and it was costing too much at home, than,
more at home than I was bringing in.  So,

B.193:  Yeah.  See the-, the-, the economic situation on the whole thing.  And
then, uh, well it is, see we do have things that we are [laughter] concerned
about here.

A.194:  Uh-huh. 

B.195:  This generation, I don't know.  Social change is always going to go on, but
I think we have taken a big leap in the last, you know, twenty, thirty years. 

A.196:  Uh-huh. 

B.197:  And, uh, nothing is the same. 

A.198:  No, it seems like it is totally different.  Of course, I do not have much
to compare it to.  To me,

B.199:  # Well.  #

A.200:  # our # causes do not seem as important as you all's were.  Do you know
what I mean?

B.201:  Yeah.  But we, we grew, we passed them on to you, [laughter]  you know, I
mean,

A.202:  You, you what?

B.203:  I said, "We passed --

A.204:  Okay. 

B.205:  -- them --

A.206:  We passed them on to us. 

B.207:  -- on to you." 

A.208:  [Laughter].  

B.209:  I mean, you know, because it takes a lot of hard work.  It takes writing
letters to Congressmen and,

A.210:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.211:  # and, # you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to
shape and mold the future.  And, and, uh, you know, um, did we make the right
choices? We do not know, we will never know. 

A.212:  No. 

B.213:  I mean, you know, I, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the
children of today.  Yeah, I think we made some big wrong choices. 

A.214:  Okay, yeah. 

B.215:  And I think business got in the way.  I think the greed of the
eighties got,
