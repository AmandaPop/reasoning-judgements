=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you watch much T V?

B.2:  Well, I watch in the evening with my kids [TV].

A.3:  Your kids.  How many kids do you have?

B.4:  I have four children.

A.5:  Oh, goodness.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  I have got two.

B.8:  Well, 

A.9:  That is about all I want [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah, it keeps you busy, doesn't it?

A.11:  Yeah, they do.  They are still babies.

B.12:  Uh, my children like to watch SESAME STREET.  I watch with them every once
in a while, but that is not my favorite programs.

A.13:  Oh, well.  We have only get two channels.  We do not have cable.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But I am not crazy about T V much.  It just, well it kind of is an idiot
box.  Now SESAME STREET is a good program --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- because, uh, I do have that on videotape, and I will let him watch that
every once in a while.  And he has learned to count to twenty from that.  
So,

B.18:  Yeah.  It can be very --  

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- educational.  There are shows th-, that I like.  Uh, I like good family
shows,

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  uh, though.  Uh, I let my kids watch things like LITTLE HOUSE ON THE
PRAIRIE.

A.23:  Okay.  

B.24:  And the COSBY SHOW is, uh, is, uh, kind of unrealistic as a family unless
you live in upper class and have money.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  I think that sometimes the things they show on there though, uh, the
problems that their kids get into, are, are good to, uh, show that they do
have problems anyway.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  Uh,  

A.29:  But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real
people do.

B.30:  Yeah.  I mean, like I said, real life is not that easy.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  And, uh, I watch a show that I like i-, for entertainment.  Uh, it is
called the QUANTUM LEAP.

A.33:  Oh, I love QUANTUM LEAP.

B.34:  I watch that show every time, 

A.35:  Um, yes.  

B.36:  and, uh,  

A.37:  That is a good show.  

B.38:  I, I like, uh, how the, how he has to help with the people that he, that
he becomes.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  Uh, because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he
lives there for a while and then he is gone.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  He has to do something positive to help them.  

A.43:  Right.  

B.44:  So I,   

A.45:  He always got to change history is what it is. 

B.46:  Yeah.  Yeah.   

A.47:  Usually, yeah.

B.48:  It, 

A.49:  That it is so good.  I was glad when they put that back on this channel,

B.50:  Me too, me too.

A.51:  because like I said, we only get two channels because we do not get
cable.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And still my little boy, he watches videotapes. He won't, um, this is
terrible, I do not like him sitting in front of the T V all day.

B.54:  No, that is not terrible.

A.55:  Well, 

B.56:  I do not think that is terrible at all.

A.57:  It, but it is a not really a good baby sitter [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter]  Well,   

A.59:  It is really not.  He needs to get outside and play.  And he is four years
old, and he just does not like to go out there by himself.  And I will let him
watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  But other than that, I do not like him glued to the T V all the time.

B.62:  Well, I do not think it is, it is healthy all the time either.

A.63:  Huh-uh.  

B.64:  Uh, and my kids like to, to go play with their friends, and so I guess I do
not mind too much when they do watch a little bit.  Now I, there are shows, I
do not have cable either.  And there are shows that I really put my foot down
on.  If there starts to be a lot of violence,

A.65:  Uh-huh.   

B.66:  I do not go for that.  I will not let them watch that.  If --

A.67:  Well, we made the mis-,

B.68:  -- there is  a lot of language or,

A.69:  Right.  We made the mistake of getting ROBOCOP.  And that is one of the
worst, oh, I do not let him watch it anymore.  Because --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- the, the pieces, like especially where they kill somebody, it is just
not good.  I mean it is just real violent.  I mean,

B.72:  Well, it, [sigh] you know, today I watched, and it is like they show
bloody,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  you know, things, and they show it in slow motion.  And,

A.75:  Uh-huh. 

B.76:  and everything like that.  And before, in a western or something, in the,
in the olden days,

A.77:  You would see somebody get shot, they would just fall down.

B.78:  Yeah.  And they were gone [laughter].  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  And, and it was not, uh,  

A.81:  So graphic.  

B.82:  not like today.  Uh,   

A.83:  Today it is, it is really graphic.  They try to make --  

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  -- it too realistic.  

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  And,    

B.88:  Too much realism I think,

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  sometimes.  I don't, 

A.91:  Now he is watching HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS right now.

B.92:  Oh, that is a fun show.

A.93:  It is, it is cute.

B.94:  Oh, I really --

A.95:  And that,

B.96:  -- like that one.

A.97:  little ROGER RABBIT on before that.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  That is cute.  And they have got THE HE MAN, uh,

B.100:  The cartoon or the,

A.101:  MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, the --  

B.102:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.103:  -- movie.  That is a real cute show.  

B.104:  That has good moral values too.  

A.105:  HE MAN?  

B.106:  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, I think, uh, 

A.107:  Yeah, good versus evil.  

B.108:  Yeah,  

A.109:  Huh.  

B.110:  yeah.  

A.111:  Oh, well, it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway.

B.112:  Yeah.  At least we have the same --  

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  -- ideas.

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  Yeah.  Language too.  A-, language and violence and sexual, y-, you know,

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  things.  I, I get kind of, uh, saying, "I am sorry kids, this is",

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  And I, I think it is important that I see what they are watching.  If,

A.121:  Yeah.  They do have like those parental control things on the, uh, remote
controls.  You know, where you can block out what channels you do not want
them to watch.

B.122:  You mean in cable?

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  Oh, I do not know, because I do not have that.  But,

A.125:  Well, my, my, uh, stepfather and them have, my stepfather, my
father-in-law, and them have that.

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  And, uh, they do not have any kids, but they was told how to use that.  But
still, when the kids get older, they learn how to break through that parental
control.

B.128:  Oh, do they?  [laughter].

A.129:  Huh.

B.130:  They are too smart.

A.131:  I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons.

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  So, it is, it is, I am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much
for those movies because, now we have got a lot of western tapes.

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  JOSEY WELLS, now he loves to watch JOSEY WELLS.

B.136:  Well, I think that is a good show too.

A.137:  Yeah,

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  Clint Eastwood.

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  And like THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER, we have, oh, my husband likes westerns.
And he also likes STAR TREK.  Now STAR TREK is good movies, good shows.

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  The, uh, series?  We have got a lot of those.

B.144:  Uh, I think not even the old one but the new one too.  I like --

A.145:  Uh-huh.  

B.146:  -- both of those [child_talking].  

A.147:  THE NEXT GENERATION?  

B.148:  Uh-huh.  

A.149:  Yeah.  My little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk. 

B.150:  Yeah.  

A.151:  And my little girl has Mr. Spock's ears [laughter].

B.152:  Oh, d-, [laughter],  

A.153:  [Laughter]  I told my husband he cursed my kids. 

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  They were both born with pointy ears.  

B.156:  Oh, well.  

A.157:  Not real pointy.  My little boy grew out of it.  

B.158:  Oh, that is not a problem anyway,

A.159:  No.

B.160:  but it is fun [laughter] to, you know, seeing the show anyway.  Uh, now I
like, uh, everything Mi-, oh, no, not Michael Douglas, um, oh, I can't think
of his name.

A.161:  Kirk Douglas?

B.162:  No, the, the man, right now who is having, uh, who has done, uh, BONANZA,
and then he did LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.

A.163:  Oh, Michael Landon.

B.164:  Michael Landon.  There you go, Michael --

A.165:  Oh, now there,

B.166:  -- Landon.  I have always liked --

A.167:  Yeah.

B.168:  -- and thought he did good shows. 

A.169:  Like HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN?  

B.170:  Uh-huh.  

A.171:  {Speaking to child} Here are some cookies, Kyle. {Resumes talking to
Speaker B} Yeah, I liked HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN, [/child_talking] and I, and I
thought that was kind of neat though.  But I loved LITTLE HOUSE ON THE
PRAIRIE, especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up.

B.172:  Yeah,  

A.173:  She was --  

B.174:  yeah.  

A.175:  -- kind of like my idol [laughter],  

B.176:  [Laughter].  

A.177:  when I was growing up.  Because I am twenty-seven, so it is, you know,
she is about the same age as I am.

B.178:  Uh-huh.  

A.179:  I wanted to be just like her, because she is so cute.

B.180:  Yeah, I, and I liked that show because it, it portrayed, I thought, really
well, uh, pioneer kind of days.

A.181:  Yeah and,

B.182:  You know,

A.183:  well,

B.184:  but, 

A.185:  I liked it,

B.186:  Yeah.

A.187:  but there, that is about the only, uh, show I have seen where every time
they sit down at the table, they pray --

B.188:  Uh-huh.

A.189:  -- before they eat.  And I thought that was real neat.

B.190:  Yeah.  

A.191:  Because there is not a lot of shows that do that.  [cough] And, uh, they
have this little cartoon that is on Sunday mornings with,

B.192:  Now what is that?  

A.193:  Jot. I remember him in school, but I do not, it is just this little dot
with arms and feet and little eyes, and his parents are there.  They have it
like before one of the church things,

B.194:  Uh-huh.  

A.195:  uh, you know, church that comes on?  And it is a just this little dot.
And he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home, and the parents
will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that,
and,

B.196:  Oh, I have --  

A.197:  It is just,    

B.198:  -- not seen that.

A.199:  Well, it is, usually we go to church on Sundays.

B.200:  Uh-huh.

A.201:  But we will miss every once in a while.  And I will let Kyle watch that,
and he just, well, I even like Jot.  I mean I, it is funny.

B.202:  What channel is it on?

A.203:  It is on channel, well, let us see.  You are in Plano?

B.204:  Uh-huh.

A.205:  Uh, it is twelve or ten down here.

B.206:  Well, I will look and, and see.  Yeah, we go to church on Sunday.  About
one o'clock is when our meetings start.  And, uh,

A.207:  Oh, well, this is of the mornings.

B.208:  It is in the morning? 

A.209:  Uh, around nine or ten I think.  It is before one of the, I think it is
before the First Baptist in Sherman airs.

B.210:  Okay.  

A.211:  I think that is the one that it,  

B.212:  W-,    

A.213:  uh, comes on before.  

B.214:  Well, we'll look.   

A.215:  It is real cute.  You know what?  He is bouncing around, and his name is
Jot, and then he has got a friend named Cat.  And I think the dog is the only
one that is not a, a dot [laughter].

B.216:  [Laughter].  

A.217:  [Laughter] But it is real cute.  And like I say, they, they teach him stuff
from the BIBLE.  And I think it is just a real cute show.  I am trying to get
my little boy into reading, uh, like church books and things.

B.218:  Uh-huh.

A.219:  We have got like NOAH'S ARK and, oh, LORD IS MY SHEP-.  We have got about
eight or twelve books for him, just little Bible stories.

B.220:  Uh-huh.

A.221:  And they-, he is, he is getting to where he likes them.

B.222:  Yeah.

A.223:  We got him a little Jesus doll, uh, about a year ago, and he has always
kept that.  He likes it [laughter].

B.224:  Well, I really like, now we get channel fifty-five, although we do not have
cable,

A.225:  Uh-huh.

B.226:  we do get channel fifty-five.  And that is a, uh, like, a, a song, they
sing songs on there but they're, uh, worship through music kind of things. But
they are up to date, uh, and some of them are like, uh, videos --

A.227:  Uh-huh.  

B.228:  -- like music videos, that go along with the songs about church and Jesus.
And,

A.229:  So it's a,  

B.230:  And I,   

A.231:  a Christian songs?  

B.232:  Yeah.  

A.233:  Oh, that sounds fun.  

B.234:  The Chri-, it's called the Christian music station or something like that.

A.235:  That's something.  Well,   

B.236:  And, uh, I really like that.  

A.237:  Yeah.  

B.238:  Uh, I turn that on, on Sunday mornings.  And I do not, you know, and so my
kids do not, uh, have an [/TV],
