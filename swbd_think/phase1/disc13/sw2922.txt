===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  So what kind of car do you want?

A.3:  Well, I think, we're, we have pretty much narrowed it down to a Mazda
minivan.

B.4:  Oh.

A.5:  The new, uh, the, uh, M P V.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  The, uh, the one that's the all wheel drive.

B.8:  Do you have a family?

A.9:  Yes.

B.10:  uh, that helps [laughter].

A.11:  [Laughter] Well, we're, we do it mainly because we tr-, we do a lot of
traveling, and I want to do it in comfort.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Right now we have, we have, we have a four door, you know, sedan, but it's
just, uh, it just doesn't have quite as much room, and it's not very
comfortable to drive long distance in.

B.14:  You, you sound like you've been looking recently, your, or you're,

A.15:  Well,

B.16:  buying it soon.

A.17:  we've, we've been looking for about, you know, two years to decide, but,
you know, with the style changes, you know, they're, they're, a lot of them
are changing right now, and we're trying to wait until we see what, what it's
going to, you know, the style going to stay for a while.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, supposedly the Mazda is going to change this coming year, and
we'll just, we'll wait til the ninety-twos come out.

B.20:  That won't be much longer.

A.21:  No.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  So that's, that's pretty much, uh, you know, where we stand now.  How
about, how about you?

B.24:  Well, actually, I haven't, it's funny, I haven't been looking at all, I
mean, because, um, I'm a grad student,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].

B.26:  and my wife's got an eighty-seven F-, Olds Ferenza, and I have an
eighty-two Bonneville, which basically, our, our, our, our plan is to wait
another year until I'm down with graduate school and then sell the Bonneville
for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy anot-, a, a new car some
place else, and I think, we pro-, I'm, I'm sort of stuck.  I want, half of me
wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may
be the last time I can drive one for a long time.  And the other half of me
says be pragmatic and get some sort of, um, probably small, economical car for
a couple of years, and then get something bigger, like a minivan when, when,
when we have kids and stuff.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Or, or, or when we travel a lot.

A.29:  Yeah, you pretty much have to take advantage of the, uh, the wild and crazy
while you can.

B.30:  Yeah [laughter].

A.31:  And then you got to turn into the practical.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  That's kind of the way I've had to transition.  I was into, you know, the
sportier cars, and then, uh, when, when, when it comes to putting car seats
and all that kind of stuff in it, you know, you just don't, uh, can't get away
with it any longer.

B.34:  Yeah, they don't work [laughter].

A.35:  Or then, and then you got to wait until you're, you know, after your kids
are grown, and you can scale back down again.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  But, uh, you know, right now I have a pickup truck, and it's one of the
supercabs, and you can get, you can get, uh, you know, q-, kids and everything
in there.  The only thing is it's, it's not very comfortable.  And, uh,

B.38:  Right.  Well, it's a, it's a, it's note like the, I've seen that Mazda 
van --

A.39:  Yeah,

B.40:  -- and, and it seems like it would be the right thing then.

A.41:  Well, they've made some changes over the, you know, the last couple of
years since they've come out.  This year they're coming out with a new
transmission, a little bit heavier duty transmission, which the Japanese are
not well known for, but, uh,

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  but they're supposedly getting a new, uh, transmission.  In fact I think
((Board Warner's)) the one that going to, going to design it for them.

B.44:  Oh, okay.  That'll be nice.

A.45:  And that'll, that'll help some.  And, uh, they're going to change the
interior to where the back seat itself can either be removed or laid, lain
down into a bed, whereas now it can't.

B.46:  Oh, okay.

A.47:  You can lean it back a little bit, but not all the way.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  So, we're looking at those type things, also.

B.50:  That's just, yeah, it's thinking ahead.  It's real good.

A.51:  Yeah, plus, you know, th-, the, uh, the wheel base, uh, the, the way it is
right now the all wheel drive, d-, it's a little bit higher up off the ground,
but they're going to raise it three more inches up, and,

B.52:  That'll give you a little extra.

A.53:  little bit more clearance.

B.54:  Yeah. (( )).

A.55:  And, uh, you know, not that I really need it for any, but I like sitting up
high.

B.56:  Yeah, it's actually a real nice feeling.

A.57:  So you can see.

B.58:  I, uh, grew up driving the Suburban, and then recently I test drove, um,
for some strange reason I test drove a Range Rover.

A.59:  Yes.

B.60:  Not because I was going to buy a forty,

A.61:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.62:  thousand dollar Jeep, mind you [laughter].

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  But just, but, but because, um, my, my wife works for a temp agency, and,
they, and, and they had a job and they called me.  Basically, I, basically I
was shopping the agent to make sure, you know, he was doing good things by
Range Rover, you know.  They sent me out as a, to sort of act like I wanted to
buy one, basically.  And then report back to the company as to how the
salesman is doing.

A.65:  Um.

B.66:  So I had to act like a buyer.  And, uh,

A.67:  That's kind of interesting.

B.68:  Yeah, it's a neat little, um, it's, it's, it's, it's sort of like being a
scab, I guess, [laughter] in a sense.  But, uh, but I used, you know, I mean,
he did a wonderful job.  So I just went back and said wonderful things about
him, you know.  But, we went, and part of it was test driving a Range Rover,
and I realized afterward, you know, it's a real nice ride, because it's nice,
you're nice and high, and lots of clearance, and stuff like that like you
said but,

A.69:  Forty-seven thousand dollars is.

B.70:  Forty thousand, yeah, that's just,

A.71:  It's a little stiff.

B.72:  way too much for, for a jeep.

A.73:  Yeah, I agree.  I don't think, even if I had the money to spend on it, I
don't think I'd buy one.

B.74:  No, I wouldn't, I mean, I would get, if I wanted to pick out a car like
that I'd go for a Bronco, or, or, or, you know, Blazer, or something.  I
figure it's,

A.75:  Plus nowadays, you know, y-, it, cars are high anyway, you know can't
hardly get anything decent for less than, you know, nineteen or twenty.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  And that's, that's a pretty big investment, even nowadays.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  And I want something that's going to last me for at least seven, eight
years, and, uh, I just can't see, you know, these people spending these
thirty-five to forty-five thousand dollars on B M W -s and Mercedes, and then
trading them every year or two.

B.80:  Oh, yeah, this, this is nothing.  I mean, he, uh, he was showing me, they
had this, I was, you know, they had, they had a beamer there that was
seventy-eight thousand, and a Mercedes that was ninety, you know.

A.81:  God, that's so, that's silly.

B.82:  And the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these Mercedes the previous
year.  It was amazing.

A.83:  I, uh, I, like I say, I d-, I think even if I had the money I wouldn't want
something like that.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  It's just not within my, it's just, it's impractical.

B.86:  It, totally impract-, and I, I can't imagine what's that much better about
them that,

A.87:  Too many other good things you can do with the money besides --

B.88:  Right.

A.89:  -- waste it.  Uh, I just, uh, you know, there's too many people that need
things and, you know, places that you can put it.

B.90:  Yeah, I agree.

A.91:  Not, not to waste money like that.

B.92:  It'd be nice to think that I could afford it, mind you, but.

A.93:  Yeah.  I mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it, but, I, I'm just not,
I, even if I had the money, I, I'm, I know for a fact I just wouldn't, I
wouldn't buy one.

B.94:  Yeah, no, I w-,

A.95:  I just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff, but, uh, we try to keep
our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can, if we can get by with
it.  We have a Volvo right now that's, it's seven years old, and it's got, uh,
about eighty-five thousand miles on it, and it still drives like it's brand
new.

B.96:  I was going to say, a Volvo at,

A.97:  [Throat_clearing].

B.98:  eighty-five thousand miles is still being broken in, isn't it?  [talking]
{Woman's voice in background}.

A.99:  About, that's about right.

B.100:  I mean,

A.101:  And we, we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five, six,
seven years, if we can, if we can make it go that long.

B.102:  Yeah, tho-, a-, aren't those the ones that, that have, is it Volvo or Saab
that has, like, the three hundred thousand mile club and I think it,

A.103:  Well, Volvos, uh, there's a lot of them that we, in fact we have a mutual
friend, uh, my wife and I, that, uh, they, uh, they just passed three hundred
thousand miles on theirs.

B.104:  And the car's probably still fine, right?

A.105:  It's still mechanically fine.  Now, you, you know, there's, there's money
to invest in it during, during that three hundred thousand miles, you know,
uh, timing chains and, and various other things,

B.106:  Right.

A.107:  but all in all, if you, if you take it mileage based on what you spent
over that life of the car,

B.108:  It's wonderful.

A.109:  relatively cheap.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  So, uh, you know, I, so far I can't complain.  It's been a good car, and,
and we're going, we're, like I say, we'll try to keep it for a long time.
It's been paid off for several years.

B.112:  Th-, th-, that's nice to have, no payments, yeah.

A.113:  Yeah.  And, uh, the, the only other thing is, you know, the, the pickup
truck's nice but it's impractical for, for travelling and family.  So, we'll
get something that we can haul stuff in, if we have to [hum] --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- and then have it for, you know, trips and, and everything.

B.116:  That's great.  You've really thought this out it sounds like.  I mean, I'm
sort of, you know, I sort of look around and go, Yeah, that's a nice car,
that's a nice car, but I haven't really,

A.117:  Well nowadays, it pays to shop, because you're going to have to live with
it for a while.

B.118:  Right.  [laughter] Uh, 

A.119:  You know, if you, if you're paying for it for three or four years, uh,
[/hum] that's a long time right there in itself.

B.120:  to be paying for a car.

A.121:  And then you don't want to turn around and, and, you know, the next time
you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and, uh, you don't want to start
another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a
month.

B.122:  That's true.

A.123:  So, uh, it, it's, it's crazy.  So.

B.124:  That's, that, that, that's real true actually.

A.125:  But, the little, that eighty-two Bonneville that you have, that, that, uh,
that's probably a pretty good car.  [sniffing] [throat_clearing] [squeak].

B.126:  That's, that's actually, it's got, um, it's actually, it's low on mileage
given i-, that ((it's eighty-two)).  It's only got seventy-five thousand on
it.  And, uh, or seventy-four or whatever, you know, and it's, it's in, uh,
it's a funny coincidence that m-, my cousin sold me the car.  And she's up for
the weekend now, [laughter] so she's out baby-sitting in the next room.
[laughter] Sort of perfect coincidence, it's a perfect time to be talking
about that car.  Um, but yeah, it's just, it's just, you know, I have little
problems here and there, you know, um, stupid things start to go, like the,
uh, I can't open, it, it has electronic windows, unfortunately, electric
windows and doors, and the, uh, and the passenger window is gone, you know, it
doesn't open any more.  But I'm not going to fix it because I'm going to sell
it in a year.

A.127:  Yeah, well, you know, uh, things like that that go out, you know, if you
replace them, it's just so costly anyway.

B.128:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's seventy-five dollars for the motor alone.  And then
another seventy-five to install it, you know, so.

A.129:  It's crazy.  Yeah.

B.130:  That can, that, that's crazy, or like the air conditioning went.  The air
conditioning sort of blowing warm air, so I went down to the, you know, my
local mechanic, and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and
they went through everything.  I told them to put a shot of Freon in, and
they said, yeah, it needs a shot of Freon.  But then he came back, and he
said, well, the reason you're losing the Freon is because you have a leak in
this condenser line, and when i-, and that's a hundred and fifty dollars to
fix that, and then while we're in there we have to change this, this, and
this, and, you know, and so it w-, w-, it would have wound up costing was
close to four hundred dollars.  But he said look if you're selling the car in
a year, don't bother doing it all.  He said, I'll give you a shot of Freon
every now and then, and, and you're fine, you know, so,

A.131:  Well, and your wife has what kind of car? 

B.132:  She has an eighty-seven, um, Ferenza.

A.133:  Oh, Ferenza.

B.134:  I-, it's an Olds, yeah, it's an Oldsmobile.

A.135:  Yeah, okay that's Pontiac?

B.136:  Yeah, 

A.137:  Okay.

B.138:  No it's Olds actually.

A.139:  Or Olds.  Ferenza, yeah.

B.140:  Olds, yeah.  That's actually a real good car, I'm finding.  It's, uh,
mechanically is very sound.  Um, unfortunately the body was, uh, rust proofed
by a company called Rusty Jones --

A.141:  Uh-huh.

B.142:  -- which I'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not, but, uh, Rusty Jones
went out of business because their rust proofing wasn't very good.

A.143:  So now you've got some rust.

B.144:  And now I've got some, I mean, the eighty-two has no rust at all, and the
eighty-seven has some pretty big rust spots on it.  So it's,

A.145:  That's terrible.

B.146:  So and, 

A.147:  That's one, that's one bad thing about living in an area where you have to
put salt on the roads.

B.148:  Yeah, actually, we're, we're looking forward to getting out of here.

A.149:  Oh [laughter].

B.150:  We're, yeah, in a year I'm done and then we're moving south or west.  Or
southwest.
