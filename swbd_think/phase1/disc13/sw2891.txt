============================================================================

A.1:  And what movies have you seen recently?

B.2:  [Children] Well, [sigh] [lipsmack] we aren't just real big go to the, you
know, first time it comes out kind of thing.  We neither one like to stand in
line, and [laughter].

A.3:  I don't blame you.  We're --

B.4:  So --

A.5:  -- the same.

B.6:  -- we, uh, a lot of times will just kind of hold on until it comes to a
dollar theater, or something, or maybe rent the video, although I prefer the
dollar theater, because it is kind of fun and I say dollar theater.  I think
they're actually two dollars #these days, but [laughter],#

A.7:  #Right, there's# been inflation all the way along.

B.8:  It's like saying go to the five and dime, you know [laughter].

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  It's not five and dime anymore, but the, uh, [lipsmack] analogy is there.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  But, um, we have teenagers --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and we have {pause} [breathing], we have a guideline.  I shan't say
rule [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  That, uh, you know, we like to see the movies that they want to see first
--

A.17:  Um.

B.18:  -- so that we can kind of talk about it and decide whether it's really
appropriate or you know, or not, and uh, we're probably stricter than most
parents.  I know we are because I know that my children's friends, even the
youngest ones routinely see things that,

A.19:  Well, I know that my kids have gone to things that I would never set foot
in but they haven't gone with me and I haven't paid the bill.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  So there's, there are an awful lot of movies that I just think are, uh,
unconscionable to be shown on, especially to kids, and I have had to hope that
they would enforce the R ratings and not let kids under eighteen in.

B.22:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.23:  [Sneezing] #Excuse me.#

B.24:  #And I don't# really think they do.  I mean, uh, uh,

A.25:  [Sneezing] We're having a pollen attack here and I'm having hay fever.
#Excuse me.#

B.26:  #Oh, bless# your heart, I've, I've have a throat that is so sore --

A.27:  Uh.

B.28:  -- I know exactly what you mean, just from that d-,

A.29:  But any-, anyway, um, my kids are now twenty-one and twenty-four, so I
don't --

B.30:  With absolutely no, you know,

A.31:  -- do anything now.

B.32:  Yeah, yeah.

A.33:  But once in a while what I try to do is try to [children_talking] entice
them into something that I think is going to be useful or educational or
something [laughter].

B.34:  Yeah, yeah.

A.35:  So the two recent films that we have seen where I've been able to drag them
along, um, are the, uh, HENRY THE FIFTH, the Kenneth [children_talking]
Bronoff version --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and ROSENCRANZ AND GILDENSTERN ARE DEAD --

B.38:  Oh. 

A.39:  -- which were wonderful.

B.40:  Really.

A.41:  Both of them were just outstandingly good.  

B.42:  #Well.#

A.43:  #Excellent# acting, wonderful sets, costumes, and really worthwhile.

B.44:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  We, uh, I guess probably the last one that we really paid
full price for was, uh, [lipsmack] oh, the Russian one, that, they made the
book.

A.45:  Um, I'm a bad one to ask [laughter].  I don't, 

B.46:  The submarine, the, uh, 

A.47:  Oh, yes, yes, I know the one --

B.48:  #Sean Connery.#

A.49:  -- #you're talking about# HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.

B.50:  There we go.

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  Which I was so glad that [noise] {snaps fingers} my husband had read the
book before we went, because otherwise, [laughter] he, you know, he had to
kind of sit [laughter] and explain it along the way to me that, uh --

A.53:  Uh, yes.

B.54:  -- you know, that, uh, I thought it was very well done, though.

A.55:  Well, uh, my husband went and took his son and he enjoyed it a lot --

B.56:  #Uh-huh.#

A.57:  -- #but I've# never cared much for war and spy movies --

B.58:  Yeah, yeah.

A.59:  -- so they let me stay home and work in the garden [laughter].

B.60:  That was [laughter] a nice trade.

A.61:  But they thought it was a good movie, and, uh, I like Sean Connery, so I
said if it comes out on video, I'll be willing to pay the two dollars to rent
it, and then if I'm --

B.62:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

A.63:  -- #bored, I don't# feel like I've lost a lot and I can #turn it off.#

B.64:  #That's right,# that's right.  We, uh, have, have, have thoroughly enjoyed
the, uh, DANCING WITH WOLVES.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  That was, uh, I guess we paid full price for that one, too.  

A.67:  Well, I.

B.68:  That one was very unnerving for me.  I, uh, I have an American, uh, native
American heritage, and --

A.69:  Um.

B.70:  -- I knew going into it that it was probably going to affect me deeply.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And I was right [laughter].

A.73:  Um.

B.74:  Definitely did, #it definitely did.#

A.75:  #[Lipsmack] Well, uh,# I have to tell you a comment that the man whose
office is next door to mine goes to a lot of movies and, uh, he will come back
with his capsule review.  And he had said --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- well, it has absolutely beautiful scenery, but you wouldn't like it
because of the cruelty to animals and any movie I have to say I, where I
notice the scenery means I didn't like the plot.  [Laughter] So,

B.78:  [Laughter] Well, I have to agree with you.  It, that, that part of it was
somewhat unnerving, although, [breathing] [sigh] it was cruelty to animals,
yes, but not masochistic kinds of things.

A.79:  Um.

B.80:  You know, it was very much in the natural, you know, the way it really
probably was.  Not some sadistic, crazed person, you know, who's going around
pulling the wings off flies and birds [laughter].

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  You know, swinging cats by their tail.  Not, not that kind of, uh,
torturistic --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- type thing.  You know, it was, but it was awfully graphic that way but,

A.85:  Well, I keep telling people that I don't go to movies where there's lots of
blood and, uh, shootings.  And I certainly don't go to horror films.

B.86:  Oh, yes, I agree [laughter].

A.87:  If they are trying on purpose to scare me then I don't want to go [noise].

B.88:  I'm certainly not going to give them money to do it [laughter].

A.89:  Absolutely not.  Oh, I'll tell you one, though, that I heard such good
things about.  Um, [lipsmack] oh, let's see, what was it?  Um, it's a David
Lynch movie and it's about Sailor and Lula, they're the two charac-, main
characters.  I can't remember the name of the film now.

B.90:  #Well, uh.#

A.91:  #But anyway,# got lots of just wonderful reviews and I had heard that it
had violence in it but I thought, well, I'll go give it a try.  And the first
five minutes of that movie were so disgusting that I went and got my money
back.

B.92:  Said, I'm leaving.

A.93:  I did.  I told my husband, I've got a book in the car, give me the car
keys, you can stay and watch this if you want to.  But I don't need this.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And I just got up and left.  And in about two more minutes he joined me and
we asked for our money back.  I said, you know, I, I realize that this is
advertised as an R movie, and I had heard that it contained violence, but I
had no idea how --

B.96:  That this was what I was getting #myself into.#

A.97:  -- #disgusting# this was going to be.  And in the five minutes I watched
there was no let up.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  It was, it was just filthy.  

B.100:  #Yeah, and there's,#

A.101:  #And, now, I# don't mind, uh, nudity, and I don't mind suggestiveness if
it's appropriate to the story.  I'm not a prude and I'm not a prig.  But I do
not see any reason why you should have one string of filthy language with no
intermission in it --

B.102:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

A.103:  -- #and, uh,# graphic violence and blood, and, uh, it total disregard for
human beings.

B.104:  Wanda, I read something here just a while back about, it was a newspaper
thing, just about the movie moguls and the television writers and what not,
that, basically, they individually, personally [children_yelling] are not even
close to living the lives that the normal American person does.

A.105:  Oh, yeah.

B.106:  That, we, uh, excuse me [Whispering] {to child}.

A.107:  And I think that's got to be true if you look at what they produce.
[laughter] What they think is the #ideal normal person.#

B.108:  #So how could they possibly,# you know, so when they do find something that
relates to some of us, you know, it's just kind on the seedy --

A.109:  Um.

B.110:  -- side of our lives, [laughter] you know, #it's not the uplifting.#

A.111:  #Yeah, and most of us aren't that seedy.#  [Laughter].

B.112:  Yeah, exactly [Laughter].  

A.113:  #At least the ones with the money to go to the movie.#  

B.114:  #We're a lot more mundane and humdrum and,# 

A.115:  Right.

B.116:  You know, we, uh, we saw that little HOME ALONE with our children at
Christmas --

A.117:  Uh.

B.118:  -- and, you know, thoroughly enjoyed that, but it was, uh --

A.119:  I heard that was --

B.120:  -- you know --

A.121:  -- real cute.

B.122:  -- totally different, you know, kind of thing, and even in that there were
a few things that had I been making it, I wouldn't have put in --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- you know, so, but, uh, but, you know, we, uh, we try to, you know, catch
things when they come ba-, on the television --

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  -- and they're redone, you know, so that the bad language is out and the
heavier scenes are --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- removed for the kids.  We rent a lot of the old musicals and broadway
type things, you know, for the kids to watch here at home and try to.

A.129:  There's a theater here in town that has, uh, been renovated by a foundation
to #its# --

B.130:  #Uh-huh.#

A.131:  -- heyday of the twenties.  And it has the big --

B.132:  #Oh, how fun.#

A.133:  -- #old organ and# everything and the big screen, and they show only movies
made before nineteen fifty.

B.134:  Oh how fun.

A.135:  And it is just great.  We go to that probably once a month or more. Uh, at
the very beginning when they were having film [noise] {snapping fingers}
festivals like a Katherine Hepburn festival,

B.136:  [Noise] {snapping fingers}.

A.137:  and a Fred Astaire festival, and so on, we were going a couple of nights a
week, [laughter] and it's great.  For one thing, it's not --

B.138:  I wish they'd do something like that in Dallas.

A.139:  -- well, it's not full of rowdy teenagers who are, uh, spilling their cokes
and throwing their popcorn and talking all the time.  Mostly --

B.140:  That's true but,

A.141:  -- middle age folks who are pretty decorous [laughter],

B.142:  [Laughter]

A.143:  and sit still and listen to the film.  

B.144:  That's cute.

A.145:  And they've got these absolutely terrific prints that are from the, uh,
film archives in Los Angeles that have just been specially restored, and
sometimes they are made from the original negatives, so they're really crisp
and #good# --

B.146:  #Uh-huh.#

A.147:  -- like they were when they first came out.

B.148:  Oh, that's neat though, that's, you know, that's good.  I wish more
teenagers would take up some of those, that they realize that they can be
entertained and enjoy a,

A.149:  And you can go to a #movie like that,#

B.150:  #evening's activity.# [/Children].

A.151:  and you know that it's going to be entertaining and it's going to have
some wit in the dialogue and,
