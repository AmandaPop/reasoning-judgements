==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, so, uh, what about automobiles?

B.2:  [Laughter] Well I drive a pickup truck.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And, uh.

A.5:  You should live in Texas.

B.6:  That's probably true, it, it's a small pickup truck though.  It's one of
those Isuzu, uh, space cab types with a sunroof.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So it's actually not a real pickup truck, you know.  

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  It's, uh, it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and, uh, it
has, uh, with the space cab in the back I can carry some storage, but I have
to admit Fred, I, I've never had a gun rack back there so,

A.11:  Uh, oh, you're in trouble.

B.12:  I probably wouldn't fit in Texas.

A.13:  [Laughter] You don't have a Yosemite Sam mud flap back off, or anything
like that.

B.14:  N-, no, no, nothing like that.  It, my, it's pretty preppy.  I think, uh,

A.15:  [Breathing].

B.16:  my truck sort of puts me as a, uh, as a Baltimore, Baltimore suburbanite,
I think is more, you know.

A.17:  [Breathing].

B.18:  I, uh, when I bought the truck I was going to buy a boat,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  and I needed something that would be able to haul a small boat.  But
then I, I, um, I because I wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water
sports and things, and that's one reason why I bought it, but then right after
I bought the truck I broke my foot.

A.21:  [Breathing].

B.22:  And I, and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy I got,
no sideward movement, you know, for a couple of months.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  And that meant the whole s-, uh, water skiing, you know, uh, season was
over so I thought, well okay.  And then by the, the next year I was thinking
about doing it again, but I invested the money in a house, you know, so.

A.25:  Oh, well th-, that's probably a little more sound investment.

B.26:  Little more sound investment, yes, so.  So then I still have this
pickup truck and then I think well now maybe I'll, you know, go by the boat
again and of course then, I broke my foot again.  Uh, so the tho-, 

A.27:  [Laughter]  Perhaps you should just, uh, dispel that thought.

B.28:  Yeah, that so, that's, so I'm not ever going to, going to own a boat.

A.29:  But you still like your truck though.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, I love my truck, in fact, uh, well my wife and I contemplate
selling, both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we,
now we're a two pickup truck family.

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  Uh, hers, in some ways is, is a little more convenient, and then mine's
convenient other ways, so it's hard to decide.  She has a, a cap on the
back and, and, uh, she has, um, uh, roof racks, so we were able to carry things
on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  without them ever worrying about em-, them getting wet or whatever.  

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  But with mine, see I have a space cab so you can put like luggage
immediately behind the seats and I also have bucket seats and air
conditioning,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] so each one has its good points and each one has its bad
points in a two truck family.  Ye-, uh, wha-,

A.39:  Yeah.  Do you feel that, uh, you're the always the guy that gets called
when someone moves or something?

B.40:  I think family, um, I do a little bit but surprisingly I have, uh, two of
my brothers, since I bought my Isuzu pickup, two of my brothers have bought,
uh, Isuzu Troopers, which actually, you know, can open the back and just take
out your back seat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in
them, so,

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  I think, um, I used to be the one that was called, but now everybody
owns one themselves, you know.  I do have some friends every once in a while
that will ask me and I'll, I'll, of course, do that, you know, that doesn't
matter.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Ye-, it's fo-, for a friend you'd do it anyway, so it doesn't really
matter.

A.45:  Yeah, that's, uh, it just seems that, uh, I don't know if I'd ever want to
own one because I know I've used guys with pickup trucks two or three times.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And, and they, you know, what are you doing this weekend, well I'm
helping a guy move, you know, 

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  and it just seems like they're always getting the call.

B.50:  Yeah that's true.  What type of car do you drive, Fred?

A.51:  Well I have a eighty-five Mercury Cougar --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and I've had it since, well eighty-six actually, so it was still
fairly, you know, it was a new style when it came out.

B.54:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.55:  And, uh, my wife drives and eighty-seven top-, or an, wait an eighty,
eighty-seven Topaz, yeah that's right.  And so we're a Mercury family, I
guess.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Um, not so much on her part, but I don't know, my dad always bought Ford
and Mercury products, so.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  And I like the looks of the Cougar.  

B.60:  Yeah, they're nice looking, I like them.

A.61:  Yeah, thanks, and, uh, except for I got a some Texas hail storm damage, a
little golf ball action.

B.62:  Oh really.

A.63:  So I've g-, d-, driving around a, with a Chinese checker board
basically.

B.64:  Oh, gee.

A.65:  I got that about a year and a half ago.  Actually, two years ago this May.
And I just totaled out the car,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  and, uh, so it paid for itself and I'm basically driving, uh, almost a
free car, so.

B.68:  Yeah, well that's, see that's what I'm hoping to stop paying truck
payments soon.  You know, that's, I think that's, payments are important.
What, yo-, so, but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz, they're nice too.

A.69:  Yeah, we haven't had a trouble with either of them yet.  

B.70:  Uh-huh {said softly}.

A.71:  Uh, her Topaz, uh, uh, my Cougar's got like eighty some thousand miles on
it.  It's made trips because we're both from Indiana, and she moved down here
first.  She s-,  

B.72:  Yeah, so you've gone, yeah, back to visit family.

A.73:  Pardon.

B.74:  Have you driven back to visit family, in Indiana.

A.75:  Uh, yeah, yeah.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  I've made the trip probably ten times because I was still going to
school and she was down here.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And, so, it's, just racks up, you know, about sixteen hundred miles each
time.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  A-, and we just started going in Carla's car, the Topaz and it seems to
make the trip pretty well.  It's getting around thirty-five, forty miles per
gallon.

B.82:  Oh, that's really good.

A.83:  Yeah it is, especially we, we were weighting it down a little bit,

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  It get, it, you know, the, it averaged out around thirty-five or f-, forty.

B.86:  Yeah, is, uh, gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do?

A.87:  Probably.  Uh, the Cougar I got it just for its looks,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  And, uh, the, the Mercury brand and, uh, [beep] Carla wanted a, a car
that got [barking] good gas mileage, a little something to get around town.
And, uh, dependable and, uh, uh, it, it, it's kind of a sportier model than
most Topazes.  It's got the, the stripping on the side and,

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  it came with, uh, I think Eagle tires.  Some guy had, some salesman had
decked it out.

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  And, uh, so it, it looked pretty sharp.

B.94:  I, I take it, you don't have, you don't have kids then,  

A.95:  No, no, we, we just got a new puppy, but, uh, 

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  it's close enough.

B.98:  Because if you had, if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about
sportier looking, you'd be saying things like, it has a good back seat, uh,

A.99:  [Laughter].

B.100:  the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely.
It's, tha-, that's a big difference in conversations there.

A.101:  Oh, so you don-, you don't have children or,  

B.102:  No, we, well we're just recently married, in December.

A.103:  Oh, okay.

B.104:  Uh, but that's we, we laugh now, my wife says we should sell my truck and I
say we should sell hers.

A.105:  [Laughter].

B.106:  And I said well the reason why we should sell yours, Laura, is ca-, see
mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space
area,

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  with seat belts.  I said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there, so
we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on
trips.  I said but we can go on trips in mine, you know, we can travel
anywhere with my truck, so that's uh, you know, we, I laugh about that.

A.109:  That's funny, 

B.110:   Uh-huh.

A.111:  see that's true I never thought of that an.  

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  You know, oh, it's a good chil-, and, you know, loading up the kids, you
know, we haven't crossed that yet, so.

B.114:  [Laughter] I n-, we haven't either.

A.115:  Have you seen these new station wagons?  They look pretty sharp.

B.116:  Well wh-, the Ford ones?

A.117:  Uh, I don't know what it was, I just saw it going down and mom and the
kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car.

B.118:  Yeah, I think, uh, I think Ford was one of the first ones to step into
that new, um, that new almost shuttle, space shuttle like appearance.

A.119:  Yeah, yeah.

B.120:  And I think they've done, they've really come on strong with some of
that, um, uh, wind resistance and energy saving, and, uh, uh, developments.  I
think that that's their station wagon.  I think those are Fords.

A.121:  Okay.

B.122:  But I do, I like those.

A.123:  No more of the, the panel station wagons anymore.

B.124:  Yeah, [laughter] now, now the station wagon looks sleek, it looks, yeah.

A.125:  I know they do look pretty sharp.

B.126:  And hopefully, I think, you know, it's supposed to get better gas mileage
and, um, I think that, that's becoming an important thing too.  My wife and
I've been discussing this, you know, looking for a car, when we do get rid of
one of the trucks, we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Just because, um, i-, it just has become such an important thing I think
for the environment and for the economy and everything, you know, to start to
pay attention to that more and more, so.

A.129:  So you, you bought an Isuzu, so you're not a, a, the buy American crowd,
or.

B.130:  No, I think, I think the reason why I, I bought the Isuzu is because, you
know, I looked, almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway,

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  there's only a couple of them like I looked, the first place I went were
the, were Dodge, Chrysler Plymouth, and, you know, I went to a number of them
and I priced them all out.  And I was just, the, the, I was almost going to
buy a, um, a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck but the salesman
insulted me.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  Um, the guy, the salesman, you know, they always do that deal with you
where they say, well I got to go talk to my manager.  Well here the manager is
actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on, he's
always on T V.

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  And he comes out of his office and I asked him for, I, I said well you
know, it was like maybe eighty-three hundred dollars for this truck.

A.137:  Yeah.

B.138:  And I said well, I, I'd like it for eight thousand dollars.  I said for
eight thousand dollars, I'll s-, you know, I'll write out the down payment now
and, you know, because I can get f-, I can get financing through my credit,
because I'd checked about financing and everything, you know.  I said I'll, for
eight thousand dollars, I'll take it.  You know, because it was o-, sort of
marked down, you know.  And the, and the guy came out of the back and insulted
me.  He said, he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go
back to the used lot.  It's behind the building, and he walked away.

A.139:  Oh, man.

B.140:  I guess it was a sales technique.  He thought he was going to pressure me
into giving up that three hundred dollars that I asked for, I don't know.  

A.141:  That, 

B.142:  And I said, I said, I looked at the salesman, I said I'm, I'm sorry your
boss just insulted me, I can't, it's against my pride to buy a truck here now.

A.143:  No kidding.

B.144:  And I felt really bad, I walked out and the guy called me at home the next
couple of days, it was terrible.  But you know, I walked out, I got into, my
brother was actually with me shopping for a car, we drove down the street and
he said why don't you just look in here.  And we went into the Isuzu dealer,
because my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper, he wanted one,
you know.

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  And we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale, like
ninety-six hundred dollars with everything ...
