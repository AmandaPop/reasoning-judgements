============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, Ray, what do you think about taxes?

B.2:  Okay, um, too high, obviously. 

A.3:  Uh-huh, yeah, I agree. 

B.4:  But property taxes have been going up repeatedly, uh, over the last, uh,
well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that they've increased. 

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  So, um, and they're always saying if, you know, if they don't raise taxes
then they're going to have to lay off on, uh, the teachers --

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  -- they're going to have to lay of, uh, firemen, they're going to have to
lay off the police officers, but yet they don't talk anything about the
administration, about cutting back on that end of it. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  They just, they've, they're in the middle of an expos3e now on the state
and the City of Providence, uh, public works departments.

A.11:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.12:  And they've had T V cameras going around.  Uh, they wait at some of the
yards and they follow the trucks as they come out, uh, at random --

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  -- just to see what they do during the course of the day. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  And there's not much that's going on, I'll tell you. 

A.17:  [Laughter]. 

B.18:  I mean they're going to gin mills and, and spending half a day in there
drinking, or,

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  they're going to other people's homes and doing work. 

A.21:  Oh, so you've got, you ha-, you have a little graft and corruption, huh?

B.22:  Uh, I think that's in any city or town, I think.  I don't think there's any
that are free from graft and corruption. 

A.23:  Yeah.  Um. 

B.24:  Uh, if they could eliminate something like that. 

A.25:  Yeah, you know, the waste.  You know, that's, I think, uh --

B.26:  Yeah. 

A.27:  -- I, I think that's a big problem.  Uh, uh, I don't, do you think you get
some good services for your taxes? Do you have a good school district? Do you
have,

B.28:  Um, I thought we always did. 

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  I grew up in a town, it was, it's a small town. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  It's in Rhode Island.  Actually I live in Rhode Island.  I work in
Massachusetts. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  Um, but about, uh, six, seven months ago, they had a breakdown of all
school systems, and how many children actually once they, once they get into
the school system, how many actually graduate.

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  And I was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town. 

A.37:  Yeah.  Around fifty percent?

B.38:  Uh,

A.39:  [Noise] {knocking or hammering}.

B.40:  not quite, but it was up there.  It was the forty percentile range. 

A.41:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, that's pretty much, I think, nationwide it's, you
know, the average is about seventy-five percent, uh, complete school, you
know.  Twenty-five percent dropout rate throughout the country --

B.42:  Yeah, that's,

A.43:  -- for school districts.  I'm not sure how they figure that out, if they do
per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like
that.  But some schools, uh, I don't know, see I, I live in a small community
and, um, we don't pay much in taxes.  I don't.  Uh, this sets, this is a
farming community, and the farmers control your property taxes basically, and
in the sense, you services.  We have, uh, probably what's considered the third
worst, maybe the fourth worst school district in the, in the, in the state,
other than the city of Baltimore itself, probably, you know, which is always,
I guess a low s-, a low streak.  So actually, I think, for the return on my
taxes, for my, my, my, uh, state taxes that go to my school district and my
services and whatever --

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  -- I think I get a pretty good return.  But my employment tax, you know the
federal, I don't think I get a good federal return at all.  I think locally, I
think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars, and that was,
that included state and local taxes, so that was school district and snow
plowing, which isn't probably anything like that you have, and that included
my water and sewer --

B.46:  Um. 

A.47:  -- um, but I didn't think that was too bad [/noise]  {knocking or
hammering}.

B.48:  Yeah, [throat_clearing]  mine are right now, they're two thousand dollars,
just a little over two thousand. 

A.49:  Uh-huh.  Do you own a lot of property, just a, or a small lot?

B.50:  No, uh, third of an acre. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  And, uh, it's a colonial --

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  -- house that we have, it's a saltbox. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  It's, uh, twelve years old. 

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  The, uh, [throat_clearing]  plus the, plus the personal property tax we get
taxed on our automobiles. 

A.59:  Oh, do you?

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  See, we don't do that. 

B.62:  And then the, the town also has a fire tax --

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  -- so we get a fire tax added to. 

A.65:  Uh, everything on top of that. 

B.66:  Yep. 

A.67:  # Yeah, see, I.  #

B.68:  # And it's, the # bulk of it's going for the school system. 

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  But we had, uh, [throat_clearing]  when I, when I got out of school, I, I
went up and I worked in a, in a missile plant up in, uh, Buffalo. 

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  [Throat_clearing] And up there, they had like all our fire departments were
volunteers.

A.73:  Right, yeah. 

B.74:  They had, uh, the best of equipment and, and the best of training.  A-, and
it didn't really c-,

A.75:  You mean you have a #full-time fire department?#

B.76:  # No full time.  #

A.77:  Is that what you have now, though, in your town?

B.78:  Yes, yes, we've got all full time fire departments. 

A.79:  Oh, how many, about how, my goodness, see that's, see that's, down here,
um, being a member of, we have, we have a couple full time firemen, but
basically, you know, they w-, train the guys and they run the show, and they
live in the firehouse and, you know.

B.80:  O-, okay, and then you have call,

A.81:  And then most everybody else is volunteer. 

B.82:  Yeah. 

A.83:  So there's like a core of, like each station has like two or four
full-time, then everybody else is volunteer.

B.84:  Yeah, we got volunteer, I mean, uh, we used to have volunteer up here --

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  -- and now they're all paid. 

A.87:  Um. 

B.88:  Which is, you know, I don't know, we can, there's a lot of things that can
be done.  Uh, the federal taxes are out of sight because of,

A.89:  Yeah, oh, that just, federal taxes just more and more and more and less and
less services, you know?

B.90:  That's it.  They just keep --

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  -- they don't cut anything --

A.93:  Right. 

B.94:  -- and it just feeds on itself, and I don't think there's anything that
anyone can do anymore. 

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  It's just grown to such proportions. 

A.97:  Yeah such, it's just out of hand, I agr-, you know, the, the whole idea,
like around here, um, you know, after Desert Storm or whatever, we have a
plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut, you
know, that they advised on cutting.

B.98:  Oh, yeah. 

A.99:  But because of Desert Storm, now, they said, well, we can't cut it, so they
put it back in action.  Now granted, everybody around here was happy, because
it keeps two or three hundred people employed.

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  But, you know, if we don't cut some of these nationwide, you know, some of
these expenses just have to be cut.  If we don't need such a large Army, and we
don't need, if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes,
then why does Congress say, tough, take them anyway?  You know?

B.102:  Well, it's like the [throat_clearing], the tanks.  Now everyone's after the
tanks, they're the, you know, like the, the Mach One, is it, the Mach One
Abrams.

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  Um, I don't know how much it costs.  Let's, let's round figure, just say a
million dollars.  Now for a million dollars, you can produce probably a
thousand hand held antitank weapons --

A.105:  Right. 

B.106:  -- rockets. 

A.107:  Uh-huh. 

B.108:  And you give them to a thousand peasants.  You don't even have to train
them. 

A.109:  Right. 

B.110:  And out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit.  Now you
take out a million dollar tank with a, with a, you know,

A.111:  # With a one thousand dollar antitank weapon.  #

B.112:  # Right.  But they're, but they're still going # with the, with the
mechanized infa-, it's like the, it's like the old days when they had the
cavalry.  They didn't want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps --

A.113:  Yeah.  A-,

B.114:  -- # or whatever they were doing then.  #

A.115:  # And you know million dollars, do you # know how many people that would
feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls,

B.116:  [Cough]. 

A.117:  and get, and --

B.118:  Right. 

A.119:  -- keep in school --

B.120:  Yep. 

A.121:  -- and, you know, if we, re-, uh, I just --

B.122:  And --

A.123:  -- in some ways I just don't. 

B.124:  -- you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all
they say, well if they didn't spend the money and they didn't, then they're
overruns, and if didn't cost a hundred dollars for a hammer --

A.125:  Uh-huh. 

B.126:  -- uh, you would put a lot of people out of work.  But those people you put
out of work, you could, you could rechannel their energies into making a rapid
transit system in this country. 

A.127:  That's right, oh I agree with you a hundred percent.  You know, our
direction has really, you know, solar energy, uh, you know, there's been some
recent great discoveries in solar energy, surprisingly --

B.128:  That's right. 

A.129:  -- because there's, there's no money invested in it. 

B.130:  No, um, in fact, in fact, T I just announced --

A.131:  Yeah, a big thing. 

B.132:  -- some breakthroughs in --

A.133:  Uh-huh. 

B.134:  -- solar energy --

A.135:  Yeah. 

B.136:  -- you know, some flex-,

A.137:  A flexible solar material --

B.138:  Yep.

A.139:  -- that it can be woven --

B.140:  Yep. 

A.141:  -- over top of something. 

B.142:  Yep. 

A.143:  It could be, it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the
plane, you know, it, uh, it just, it could be put on the top of automobiles
too,

B.144:  It's being channeled into special action groups, by special action
groups --

A.145:  Right.  

B.146:  -- and, they just keep, the taxes keep going. 

A.147:  God, they just keep, yeah, it's, that just,

B.148:  Just for those, just for those groups, and we've got like the, the, uh,
Groton, Connecticut --

A.149:  Uh-huh. 

B.150:  -- where they make the subs. 

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  And we've got a division in, uh, in, uh, Quansett that does it, that does
the same thing.  So, when they announced the contract up here for that latest
--

A.153:  Uh-huh. 

B.154:  -- uh, sub, I guess, uh, NEWPORT NEWS said they were going to sue the
government because of, you know, blah, blah this and blah, blah that, whatever
it was.  But it's generating jobs up here for us but it's really, it's really
not if you look at the whole, you know, it's generating jobs for a few people. 

A.155:  Uh-huh. 

B.156:  If they channeled their energies, if they go back to like when Roosevelt
put, put in the C C C camps --

A.157:  Right. 

B.158:  -- and they built border ways for the reservoirs and, you know --

A.159:  And highways. 

B.160:  -- highways and bridges and yeah, um,

A.161:  See that's a big problem we have.  Um, I'm originally from Pennsylvania --

B.162:  Oh, okay. 

A.163:  -- and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every
bridge that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration.
Uh, within was in the City of Pittsburgh --

B.164:  Is that right?

A.165:  -- and there a-, yeah, because, see they, Eisenhower put through money for,
uh, though it probably didn't affect Boston, it went --

B.166:  Was it,

A.167:  -- th-, uh, a highway from New Jersey west. 

B.168:  was it funded by, by special bonds or.

A.169:  I'm not sure what it was, but it was, uh, Eisenhower, I guess, thought that
you should be able to move tanks across the country,
