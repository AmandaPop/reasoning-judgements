==========================================================================

B.1:  (( )).

@A.2:  Uh, well I mean I've had time to think about it because, uh, we've had,
uh, i-, i-, there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk
to so.

B.3:  Oh, okay.

A.4:  So, um, I, I was thinking about a couple things, uh --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- and whether they are serious.  Some things are serious and some aren't.
I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, uh --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- not the biggest thing, but one of the things that bothers me is the
credit information, uh, situation, 

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  that you, uh, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if
you want any s-, sort of credit, 

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  e-, extensive checks and, and things of that nature.

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  When, um, I, I, I mean I, I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy,
simply, I, I do t-, I do feel it is but I don't know whether,

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  some of the questions they ask are legitimate --

B.17:  Uh-huh,

A.18:  -- uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
[laughter],

B.19:  Well what's scary is, uh, uh, about two, three, four months ago on a Sun-,
in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS
MORNING NEWS.

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  They showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out and
they just took, um, a fellow in John Q. Public in Dallas and all they had was,
let's see, they had his birth-, they had something like his birth date, the
street address, um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last
name, [cough] excuse me, and it was, um, very scary to see what they found
out.  I mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, you
know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names,
locations, um, it was really frightening.

A.22:  Well I guess, I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact,

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  that once you give your social security number there are people I guess
who are, who are, uh, actually collecting all this all the time and,

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  and profiles are given.  I understand, uh, I read the other day that,
uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone --

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- uh, all, all they need now is your telephone number, which I guess is
involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number
or not.

B.29:  Right, uh-huh.

A.30:  I, I, I feel that is an invasion of privacy but it,

B.31:  I do too, yeah. I don't, the other thing I don't like is, um, in terms of
uh, like we just moved here from, uh, Minneapolis and, uh, to get the, the
very nice townhouse that we're in, 

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  you were required by the property management firm that was representing a
private landlo-, you know, husband and wife, owners, um, who had never done
this before.  They, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information
and what we really didn't have the same opportunity, you know, and I guess
that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do
it too.

A.34:  Yeah, exactly.

B.35:  Um, in terms of the credit, yeah, I know, um, we're also going through
adoption now,

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  in for an adoption, and I mean after we gave our fingerprints n-, to the 
F B I, you, you,

A.38:  My God.

B.39:  look at each other, yeah, you look at each other and say, well,
[laughter], it's too late now.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  Um, so I mean it's, it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how
if they really try, um.

A.42:  Yeah, I, I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me, 
uh -- 

B.43:  Uh-huh, go ahead.

A.44:  -- uh, well, by, b-, uh, I make my living by, uh, flying airplanes for, 

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  for a company.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  And, uh, as a, as a, uh, an airline pilot I have to take random drug
testing. 

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  I mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time, so I
when I finish a, a certain flight on a random basis I have to, 

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  uh, have a wri-, a drug test and, and, and that's without i-, uh,
probably cause, 

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  and, uh, a-, and,

B.55:  (( )) it isn't,  

A.56:  in the end now, I mean they've tested, they've spent forty million
dollars and they've found, uh, I think, uh, in pilots anyway, of something
like, uh, uh, eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come
up, uh, #three guys have come up positive, and one of them was a bad test,
so.#

B.57:  #Positive for anything, see yeah.#  See, uh, and I just started working,
well for an electronics firm down here, I used to be a reporter.

A.58:  Yeah.

B.59:  And then now, I'm in corporate communications,

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  and, uh, part of that [cough] excuse me, was, as a new hire, that I had
to take a drug test,

A.62:  Drug test, righ-,

B.63:  and I had never been asked that and I thought, um, I really didn't like
it.  Um, I, I have very mixed feelings about it.  I don't disagree or agree
with you.  

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  Um, I think i-, I think that it's well and you're in that field, so I
don't know, but it's, you know, we lived in, uh, Minneapolis when the
Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas, 

A.66:  Yeah, right.

B.67:  yeah, that hit the fan like, uh, you, uh, you're obviously aware of
that, um [throat_clearing].  

A.68:  Yes, I am.

B.69:  I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of, if they're
going to do random, um, I, I don't agree with random, I guess I would look for
a standard in consistency.

A.70:  Yeah.

B.71:  You know, in terms of maybe at set intervals, so that everybody knows
what's going on, um, I don't see a problem with that.  I do think, I see some
level of necessity, um, [throat_clearing] in something where people are
transporting other people, uh, only because of the things you've heard about.
The problem is the reason I feel that way, even to a low degree is because
it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, you know, majority, um.

A.72:  Yeah, I, I can understand the public's alarm to it, 

B.73:  Yeah, I'm not alarmed.

A.74:  but, I guess, having done this all my life, I knew that there wasn't
a problem and, and it, indeed it has proved out that way, but now, try to get
the damn thing repealed, you know.

B.75:  You can't, yeah, I know, it's, um.

A.76:  I guess I feel bad because, uh, not only that but in some of the instances
like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, I mean wha-,
what, what happens if you say no.  If you say no then you're excluded and I,
doesn't seem the courts,

B.77:  Right, right, it's a matter, and that's, um, exactly what it is.  

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  I mean, that, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion.
Um, if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania.

A.80:  That's right.

B.81:  I mean, if, you hate to say that, but that's the way it is.

A.82:  It's my feeling also that, that, that although I, I don't know if it's
that serious, i-, but that was part of the question, 

B.83:  Uh-huh,

A.84:  I do feel the courts have, have held up a great deal of, of our privacy,
I mean particularly look in, in some of the, in some of the, 

B.85:  Uh-huh.

A.86:  uh, I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of
privacy,

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  which I support of course, but it I guess with our fear with crime and
maybe airline crashes and things like that, it does seem that we've, we've
slipped and that's eroded, or at least those in the market place their
everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, you know, it's fair game,
t-, you, you have to answer these questions, of course.

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  Uh, I don't know, I, I feel there has been an erosion and I don't really
know how serious it is, except I don't like it [laughter].

B.91:  In terms of the privacy, yeah, that in it, and also, I agree with that and
in the, in terms of the question, um, in terms, uh, I worked in medical public
relations for almost a decade,

A.92:  Um.

B.93:  and that was pre-AIDS and all the other, um, things,

A.94:  Um.

B.95:  that were probably there but just not [throat_clearing], excuse me,
labeled and I have a real problem with medical professionals, um, it goes back
to the things like drug screening but if it's in any level even with the
potential to endangerment,

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  um, and I think this is much stronger than, you know, pilots or, uh, train
engineers being screened,

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  um, the transmission of the AIDS virus, um, i-, i-, that's a real
ethical problem.  I mean I don't, I don't have the answer, I, I, you know, I
mean I think of the young girl in Florida who, well, yeah that's, was she from
your part of the country?  #Or was she from,#

A.100:  #What was that?#

B.101:  The young girl that, uh, contracted AIDS through her dentist, allegedly.

A.102:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

B.103:  And then they proved it, yeah.

A.104:  Right.

B.105:  I don't, I don't know, um, i-, y-, I don't know if it's the old story that
we are killing ourselves in general, or what, um,

A.106:  Well I mean it, it, just take that, that step now, where, where now we
feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then, 

B.107:  Uh-huh.

A.108:  uh, there's always the need to, to go and inspect lockers of high school
students, tha-, 

B.109:  Oh, yeah, the, I guess the question is, uh, the, the thing for me is, who
sets the parameters or who has the control, you know.

A.110:  Yeah, I guess so, I mean well, uh, good luck to you, you just moved to
Texas [laughter] --

B.111:  Yeah [laughter].

A.112:  -- from Minneapolis.  Uh, I don't, 

B.113:  Yeah.

A.114:  I don't hold out much hope for you.  I think they'll be a cultural shock.
I mean I was based there a lot, uh, several times in the service and I was
absolutely flabbergasted at the, in, in at least in criminal law some of the,
some of the,

B.115:  Oh it's, it's ter-, 

A.116:  latitudes that the police had, but.

B.117:  I'm, uh, very seriously, no-, more than just seriously, I'm more than
likely going to be going to law school in the Fall.

A.118:  Oh yeah.

B.119:  And, yeah, if I figure out that's still what I really want to do and, th-,
the things I'm finding out are the [throat_clearing] in terms of things like
privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented,  

A.120:  Yeah.

B.121:  um, it's no better than journalism [laughter].

A.122:  [Laughter].

B.123:  Um, except in journalism it's words, um, this is very frightening in
that, uh, oh, and in, uh, in Texas they, they d-, they do not require for
instance for prospective adoptive parents,

A.124:  Um.

B.125:  whether it's domestic or international, they're one of only five states
that do not require a criminal investigation check.  Yet, if you're caught
with, let's just say, um, that somebody who's in ne-, not us, but somebody
who's need of carting, um, aluminum beer cans around, they haven't touched
them, they haven't drank them,

A.126:  Um.

B.127:  they picked them up off the street and they want to take them to a
recycling, uh, resource --

A.128:  Yeah.

B.129:  -- for money, or whatever.  Um, they've, they've been going through a lot
of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, um, because
they've been arresting people like that.

A.130:  Well, I mean, I don't understand, 

B.131:  You know.

A.132:  if you, if you don't, if they don't make a criminal check, why do you
have to be fingerprinted.

B.133:  Because, um, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the
federal level.  #Because you have to de-, because you have to deal with the I
N, yeah, because you have to deal with the, uh, imi-, immigration service.#

A.134:  #Oh, I see, oh the state doesn't require it.  Well that's kind of, that's
rather, that's rather unusual, isn't it.#

B.135:  Yeah it is, it's, uh, the whole thing is, I mean there's, again there's no
consistency.  You know, like in your, in terms of you being a pilot and being
tested randomly, um, I can't see why after a certain number of years or after
a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval, or you know, I mean
(( )),

A.136:  Well I guess, I guess the extension of that is, why, why not, the next
thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists and then if we
really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the
street.  

B.137:  They, they do that in Texas.

A.138:  Oh, they do?

B.139:  [Laughter] They don't do it for drugs, what they do is they check to see
if you've got, uh, current insurance or they check to,

A.140:  Yeah. 

B.141:  to see if you're permits are, 

A.142:  Well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, to, to invade
our privacy and,

B.143:  Yeah, I know and it's kind of, um, what's the word I want, I don't, it's
ju-, to me it's just frightening, you know.

A.144:  Yeah.

B.145:  I mean the old, uh, I'm old enough now where George Orwell, uh, way past
time [laughter].

A.146:  I just going to say, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR,

B.147:  Yeah.

A.148:  is come an-, is come and gone but it's here.

B.149:  Yeah, it's exactly true, I mean I,

A.150:  And the computers, of course helps that.  #The computer abilities store
that information.#

B.151:  #Well look at what we're talking now,# I mean, it's, look how we're talking
now, I mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, you know,
