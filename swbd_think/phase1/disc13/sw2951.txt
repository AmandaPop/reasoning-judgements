==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, do you want to start?  Do you have a,  

B.2:  Well, credit cards, um, I would think they are wonderful but, uh, I think
you have to have a lot of restraint.

A.3:  [Laughter] That is true.    

B.4:  Uh, I have never been in trouble with credit cards, but, uh, my youngest
daughter is, and a friend of mine is.  And I think it is terrible that they
can, uh, you know, wipe out a max in, uh, such a short time.

A.5:  Uh-huh.   

B.6:  Uh, I never pay interest charges.  I value my money too much to, uh, line
somebody else's pockets with my money.

A.7:  Uh-huh.   

B.8:  And I always, uh,   

A.9:  [Throat_clearing].   

B.10:  pay it off before, uh, I am charged any interest on my balance.

A.11:  So you never let it run up on you.   

B.12:  Never.   

A.13:  That is wonderful,   

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  that is wonderful.  I am, uh, I, I kind of, uh, uh, I'm just do ver-, you
know, just, just all depends it, it when I have everything all paid off, and
then I start wanting something.  And I don't really have enough, well, don't
have enough in savings s-, you know, like for a big purchase.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  Then, uh, sometimes I, I, uh, lose sight of it, you know, it is, it ju-, it
is just is easy to use. And then, uh, after a while it is, I am like you, I
hate paying those people interest.

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  And then I ma-, I make, I, I added like, uh, uh, wrote, uh, {tape skipping}
an addition to, to my car loan through the credit union which I knew was lower
interest,

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  just to pay them all off.  And then I swore I would never use them again.

B.22:  Right.  You really have to show a lot of restraint.  

A.23:  Uh-huh.   

B.24:  But if you look at [throat_clearing], if you look at the time frame on
that, uh, you will find that you have about six or seven weeks before you have
to make that payment back to the credit card company,

A.25:  Uh-huh.   

B.26:  without being charged any interest.   

A.27:  Uh-huh.  The only thing is, you have to make sure that you don't charge
more than you know you are going to be able to pay --

B.28:  That is correct, yeah, you,    

A.29:  -- at a given time.   

B.30:  Uh-huh.   

A.31:  And,

B.32:  Your budget has to be so that you can, uh, 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  you know, summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular
time.  And I can do that.

A.35:  Yeah.  And the problem, the problem is, especially with young people, is
they, they want things now.  They don't want to have to wait for them.  And
credit cards are the way to do that.

B.36:  That is right. 

A.37:  And then, 

B.38:  Well, that is what the, 

A.39:  then they are in trouble. 

B.40:  you know, that is what, that is what it is geared for, advertisement,

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  you know, is, uh, to whet you appetite and give you that, {imitates
childish voice} "Oh, I've got to have that.  I can't live without that."  And
that is the image that the younger generation has, you know.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  I have a, I have a friend who, uh, well, she is old enough to know
better,

B.44:  Uh-huh.   

A.45:  but, uh, she, she did it, and she got really in bad shape.  She ended up
going into bankruptcy.  And --

B.46:  On that,    

A.47:  -- Palley Royal is her downfall, and there is no limit on those things.
They just let you come and spend and, you know, run it up, run it up.  So I
don't know.

B.48:  Who was that, that could?   

A.49:  Palley, Palley Royal.   

B.50:  Is that a department store?    

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Oh, okay.  That is probably, 

A.53:  I, I do not know if,  I don't know if it is local. 

B.54:  No, it is not in, uh, in Dallas, huh-uh, no.  We, 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  we have Dillard's and, uh, Sanger Harris and Macy's and --

A.57:  No Palley Royal. 

B.58:  -- Neiman Marcus and things like that.  And I am sure that they probably
would not have a problem either [laughter].

A.59:  Well, I know, I know a lot of people who, uh, some ga-, some ladies at work
who don't have any problems with money or anything, but they, they really love
Palley Royal.  So, you know, they, it is just ha-, you know, you got stay
[laughter] away.  Or else you might end up, you just --

B.60:  Well, self-con-,    

A.61:  -- can't help yourself --   

B.62:  Yeah.   

A.63:  -- and buy.   

B.64:  Self-control though is the key.   

A.65:  Self-control is the key.   

B.66:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

A.67:  My daughter has, my daughter is twenty, and she got a Sears credit card --

B.68:  Uh-huh.   

A.69:  -- when she was about eighteen.   

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  And, uh, Christmas before last, she and her boyfriend, her boyfriend had
gotten one too, I believe.  And they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to
everyone --

B.72:  Uh-huh. 

A.73:  -- in their -- 

B.74:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.75:  -- family.  I mean they spent lots of money on, 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  they gave each other these beautiful things.  They gave --

B.78:  Oh, dear. 

A.79:  -- stuff to all of us.  And we were going, I can't believe you all.  You
should not have done this.  And they got angry and said, "We wanted to do it."

B.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.81:  Okay, that, she is still paying on that Sears charge.

B.82:  Wow.   

A.83:  She has now, you know, she has learned, and she,  

B.84:  Sure.   

A.85:  she is, uh, definitely paying it off.  Pay, paying on it and not running
it back up.  But you can't tell them.

B.86:  Well, experience is the best teacher --   

A.87:  That is right.   

B.88:  -- and sometimes, you know, uh, a lot of us have, have to learn by
experience.  And, and, uh, if you can learn by someone's else's past mistakes,
then you are very wise --

A.89:  Uh-huh.   

B.90:  -- if you can heed to advice given.   

A.91:  The only good thi-, one good thing about credit cards though, uh,
especially in business, if you, uh, you have to, you know, you are going to be
reimbursed by your company.

B.92:  That is true.  Yes, I am, yeah.

A.93:  And then, 

B.94:  Uh-huh. 

A.95:  uh, in fact I know of a man who is in, uh, he is in a, he, he, he, he
when he, he is in an oil pipe, pipe line selling kind of a thing.  And he has
to, he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission, you know,

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  later on.  But if he did not have credit cards he could not exist.
Because a lot of those, you know, because he knows six weeks down the road he
is probably --

B.98:  Sure. 

A.99:  -- you know, he is going to get the money to pay for it.  But he really
does, so sometimes I think,

B.100:  Oh, credit cards are, you know, really a blessing.  

A.101:  Uh-huh.   

B.102:  Uh, but you have to be wise when you use them.   

A.103:  That is true.   

B.104:  And, uh, I have nothing against them other than, you know, people abusing
it.  And then they get themselves in hot water and, you know, they are just
hurting theirselves.  And when you, uh, have a bankruptcy, it takes you, I
think, about eight years to wipe that off your --

A.105:  Oh, yeah.   

B.106:  -- record.   

A.107:  Yeah.   

B.108:  And so, you know, that is the shame about that is, uh, and people won't
touch you.  And you have got to live that down.

A.109:  Uh-huh.  That is true.  That is really true. 

B.110:  So you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit.

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  I mean it is a wonderful thing, but do not abuse it.

A.113:  Right.  You know, like emergencies or something that you do not have the
ready ca-, that you do not have --

B.114:  Oh, 

A.115:  -- cash. 

B.116:  absolutely. 

A.117:  Your -- 

B.118:  Sure. 

A.119:  -- car breaks down or you have to -- 

B.120:  Uh-huh.   

A.121:  -- you have to have something.   

B.122:  Sure.   

A.123:  It is a real, i-, you know, you do not have the money in savings, so it
really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it.  But, but like you
say, use it wisely.

B.124:  That is right.   

A.125:  Only in, you know, when you really have to.  Or knowing that you are going
to pay it off every, every month.  So that is, that is something about
American Express.  If you only use American Express, [laughter] you do not
have a choice.

B.126:  Well, there is a lot of people that, uh, know exactly what they are doing.
And they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt.  And they
will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy.  And they, they
have a way of, uh, diverting all of the things that they have bought and put
it like in hiding.

A.127:  You are kidding? 

B.128:  No, I have heard, uh, uh, there was a radio program in Dallas that we
listen to and I, well, it, in fact it is nationwide.  And I was shocked at
some of the stories that came out of that, uh, program about these people that
really, you know, they bought all these wonderful things, and then they went
bankrupt.

A.129:  And they were knowing they were going into bankruptcy.

B.130:  And they knew that, yes, they knew -- 

A.131:  So, they, it was -- 

B.132:  -- that they were going to do  -- 

A.133:  -- planned. 

B.134:  -- that and they just, uh-huh.  And, uh, they said, you know, it was worth
the, uh, jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time.  Because they
still had the stuff, you know, and they could write it off.  You know, they
can only, uh, be responsible for a certain percent and not the full, uh,
amount that they owed.

A.135:  Uh-huh.   

B.136:  And I do not know who, uh, determines, uh, the percentage rate that they
have to repay.  But it is not surely what they are, were indebted for.

A.137:  Oh, no.  Right.  Uh-huh.   

B.138:  Uh-huh.  So it, it, they use it as a scam instead of, uh, to me they were
criminals and they used th-, that in a, in a really bad situation.

A.139:  Yeah.   

B.140:  And that has kind of snowballed, I guess, around.  So, I do not know, maybe
the courts and lawyers are working on that to co-, you know, cover all the
loopholes that might exist.

A.141:  Uh-huh.   

B.142:  But I have never been in that situation and hope I never have to be.

A.143:  Yeah.  Me too, really.  Well, I guess, we covered it.

B.144:  Okay. 

A.145:  Do you have any, do you have anything else you want to add?

B.146:  No, I can't think of anything.  I am sure that we have not covered
everything because that is, uh, that is a great big, uh, a ball --

A.147:  Well, 

B.148:  -- uh, credit. 

A.149:  if you have got any other thoughts, throw them out.

B.150:  I can't think of anything right now. 

A.151:  (( )) [laughter]. 

B.152:  [Laughter] Well, listen, thank you for calling and you have a good day.

A.153:  Well, thank you, Catherine.   

B.154:  Bye, bye.   

A.155:  Bye.
