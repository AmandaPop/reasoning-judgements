=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I guess it depends on what age.  I am in the thirty something, so I
know, I mean I lived through it.  Uh, are you old enough to know about the
war?

B.2:  Uh, just barely.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.   

B.4:  Yeah, I am, uh, twenty-nine.

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  So, uh, 

A.7:  Well, yeah, you are old enough.

B.8:  Yeah.  But --

A.9:  But it was on the fringe.

B.10:  -- just, uh, yeah, exactly.  Had some friends that were, that were in it.

A.11:  It ended, uh, when I was in, uh, college.  In, uh, when I turned nineteen
in nineteen seventy, I cannot even remember at this point.  Uh, when I turned
nineteen it was the year that, uh, the draft was still going on.  If I had
been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.

B.12:  Really?  [Child_talking].

A.13:  Yeah [laughter].

B.14:  Wowie!  

A.15:  So I learned a lesson in gender [laughter].  

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  Uh, in terms of the war, I do not know.  Uh, actually I do not really know
that much about it.  I just know socially the impact it had here and what you
hear in the media, you know.  Uh, I guess I think it was, uh, uh, not that
great that we were in there, uh, in terms of for how long it lasted.

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  You know.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  What do you think?  

B.22:  Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way.  It is certainly has
affected, uh, U S policy though.  There is,

A.23:  Uh-huh.   

B.24:  there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached
the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no
different from Iraq.  I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller,
weaker one.

A.27:  Right.  The devastation, yeah.

B.28:  Yeah.  The only difference was that the government said, okay if we were
going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a
hundred percent. And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war,

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  against these people as well.

A.31:  Yeah.  And in full --

B.32:  Which, uh,  

A.33:  -- faction, yeah.  

B.34:  Right.  Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.  It was sort of, of
a president's war --

A.35:  Yeah, 

B.36:  -- rather than a -- 

A.37:  it just kind of --  

B.38:  -- country's war.  

A.39:  -- dragged on.  Uh, I do not know how you were historically.  But I was a
little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since --

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- L B J and --  

B.42:  Yeah.  It --  

A.43:  -- I mean, I pa-,  

B.44:  -- seemed to me like it was,   

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  it seemed like it was going on forever, yeah.

A.47:  It really, well, yeah, in fact, because in terms of when your, there is at
least ten years between us, so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure
that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Uh, one of the things I did not like was the weapons, the weapons, I can't
even say it, the weaponry th-, systems that they used.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Uh, it just did not seem that, uh, I do not know, technically we knew what
we were doing either.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera, and you
would think, [sigh] you know, just, uh, how could the government or the
Pentagon, uh, who-, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.

B.54:  Yeah, right.  

A.55:  Uh,   

B.56:  Of course now i-, w-, uh, now everyone's more, uh, you know,
environmentally --

A.57:  Conscious, yeah.  

B.58:  -- uh, intelligent than they were back then.  I mean back then it was not
commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things --

A.59:  Nutrisweet,  

B.60:  -- that people --  

A.61:  yeah, and all these other things.  That is true, uh,

B.62:  -- that people know about themselves now.

A.63:  Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, uh,
Vietnamese people as a whole.  Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping
them restore themselves.

B.64:  Uh-huh [child_talking].

A.65:  You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields
there [laughter].

B.66:  Yeah.  I do not know if they, uh, I do not know if they have that resource
or not.

A.67:  Yeah.  I mean I do not think they do. But I just think it is kind of a
shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans
there and,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  uh, so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good.  And that one I
probably, uh, my main opinion would be w-, w-, we should not have done it.

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  Well, 

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  that is what I know about the Vietnam War [laughter].  

B.74:  [Laughter].  

A.75:  [Laughter] Unless you,   

B.76:  Yeah, well, you know a little, uh, a little bit more than I do, explain it.
I did not, uh, get to live through it.  That the people that I know that it
did,

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  uh, felt very strongly.  Most of, I work for a government contractor.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  So most of the guys I work with, are, uh, oh, at least some of the guys I
work with rather are veterans.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  Oh, Vietnam?   

B.82:  And, uh, from Vietnam.

A.83:  Jeez, yeah.

B.84:  And, I have not talked to any of them that, that were not, you know, glad
that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  You know,

A.87:  And that, that, 

B.88:  most of them are ver-, very strongly that, that the reason for America to
be there was a good one.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  They just felt that the way America backed them up was not, was not at all
right.

A.91:  In terms of the personal.

B.92:  Yeah.  In term of, uh,  

A.93:  Yeah.  The bitterness is more on a personal --  

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  -- level than on a,   

B.96:  Personal level and, and the finances, how they started.  You know, like air
attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  Because the Congress would not approve, you know.

A.99:  The money is --  

B.100:  So,   

A.101:  -- after, yeah.  

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  I mean, I think it started actually like, like in the late fifties.  I mean
like in fifty-eight, fifty-nine.

B.104:  Huh.  I, I, 

A.105:  So it really, I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty-three, I mean I was
nine years old,

B.106:  [Cough].

A.107:  when Kennedy was shot.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  So, I mean I remember, uh, right around then that's when I first started
hearing about Vietnam.  But then as I got older and studied in school, I
realized it was even going on before that.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  You know, and you think to yourself, oh, my goodness, Eisenhower
[laughter].

B.112:  Yeah, right.

A.113:  That sounds ancient, yeah.  And I know, I know, you know, a lot of the
Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties, uh, guys that I know,
that, they are just kind of bitter, you know.  They, they, you know, I hate to
quo-, that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, but it is that kind of idea.

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  You know, they just do not feel that socially they were given, like a
friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.

B.116:  Right,  

A.117:  Yeah.  They were not given the,  

B.118:  right, the ticker tape parade and all that.  

@@A.119:  Yeah.  So, well, I won't keep you any more.  

B.120:  Okay.  

A.121:  That is probably as about as much as we both know [laughter].  But thanks
for talking to me.

B.122:  Yes.  Uh, were you calling from Texas?  

A.123:  Uh, yes, is that where you are at?   

B.124:  No, I am in Falls Church, Virginia.

A.125:  Oh, I know where that is.  That is beautiful where you are at.

B.126:  Yeah, right in, right near D C.

A.127:  D C, yeah.   Are you a native of there?

B.128:  Uh, pretty much, yep.  Been, 

A.129:  Yeah, uh, Dallas, it is, uh, ninety-two degrees here today, but at least
the humidity is, uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.

B.130:  Yeah.  It is about the same weather here.

A.131:  Really?

B.132:  Little bit, little bit cooler, like eighty-nine.

A.133:  Well, you, 

B.134:  But, basically the same thing.

A.135:  Yeah, well you are not missing too much then [laughter].  

B.136:  Yeah.  Right.  

A.137:  Really.  Well, take it easy.  

B.138:  Okay.  

A.139:  Okay.  #Bye-bye.#  

B.140:  #Bye-bye.#
