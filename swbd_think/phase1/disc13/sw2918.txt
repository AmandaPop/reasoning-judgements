===========================================================================

A.1:  If you don't cook, though, what do you like to eat, if you go to a dinner
party?

B.2:  Well, uh, I'm, uh, a bit of a seafood lover, I suppose.  Uh, I have a
health problem in that I, my cholesterol was high.

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  So I'm in the, in the process of bringing that down.  So I don't eat a lot
of beef or pork --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- or almost none.  So I would say most likely a dinner party would be, you
know, would include some kind of fish, seafood, or, you know, or poultry type
dish --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- as the main course.  #But, uh,#

A.9:  #Well, uh,# I was just thinking as I was listening to this recording go
over and over til they found a party for me to talk to [laughter],

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  I could talk about a dinner party I had, uh, Sunday --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- and it included some seafood --

B.14:  Well --

A.15:  -- so that would probably be, uh --

B.16:  -- that sounds good.

A.17:  -- appropriate for you.

B.18:  Well,

A.19:  Uh, I had, uh, some people from Germany visiting, and they are,
uh, fans of American shrimp --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- so I did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a
bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then, uh, quickly, uh, fry up
in a little olive oil, and then, uh, take out of the wok, put some, uh, red,
strips of red pepper and green pepper in --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- stir that a little bit, uh, add some, uh, sliced mushrooms --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just
bring it to a simmer.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And then you serve it on rice, and it's really a, a pretty low cholesterol
dish,

B.28:  Yes, that sou-, sounds really good.

A.29:  because its done with the, uh, shrimp and the olive oil.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  You don't use any kind of beef fat or --

B.32:  Right, yeah.

A.33:  -- no, no animal fats in it.

B.34:  Right, and #that's,# 

A.35:  #And# it's very popular and it looks very pretty,

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  and, uh, with rice and a salad, you've got a, a meal.

B.38:  Right. That, that really sounds good.  Uh, I'm a, uh, a, uh, frequent, as
frequent as possible, traveler to the New Orleans area --

A.39:  Um.

B.40:  -- and so we eat a lot of seafood, my wife and I eat a lot of seafood when
we go down there.  And, uh,

A.41:  Oh, that's a good place to get it.  

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I miss it.  I lived in Houston for a long time --

B.44:  Oh, did you? [Laughter].

A.45:  -- and [laughter] we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat.

B.46:  But, uh, we, we have not been there, uh, since last summer, but, uh, it's,
we're looking forward to going back as soon as, as we can.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Uh, but we eat, uh, eat a lot of shrimp and, uh, eat oyster dishes and we
like, uh, things like, uh, the poor boy sandwiches with the fried oysters on
them.

A.49:  Oh, yeah.

B.50:  Course I'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more, but that's, uh, we
like tha-, that, and, uh, love gumbo.

A.51:  Oh, yes.

B.52:  And, uh,

A.53:  Oh, I wish I had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  She used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo,

B.56:  Right, yeah.

A.57:  with shrimp and all sorts of other,

B.58:  [Throat_clearing] [Cough].

A.59:  goodies in it.  My job was picking the crab [Laughter].

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  So, uh,

A.61:  [Laughter] Not my favorite part [laughter].

B.62:  [Laughter] But, uh, but I guess, uh, my, like I said, I'm not a cook, so my
wife probably does, or does definitely do, you know, all of the cooking for,
you know, when we have a dinner party.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Uh, I help w-, with what I can, and, uh, you know, we'll have, uh,
something on the order of what you had, uh, you know, it a main dish and
probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  And, uh, we eat a lot of rice, and, and, uh, the, the bell peppers that
you, uh, sauteed are just right up our alley.  We eat a lot of that, a lot of
mushrooms.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  Uh [lipsmack],  

A.69:  Well, the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful
dish.

B.70:  #Right.#

A.71:  #People# always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers, and if I'm
making a whole lot, uh, I use a yellow pepper as well.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  For one pound of shrimp, I use one red pepper, one green pepper and, oh,
maybe, half a dozen, ten mushrooms, medium sized mushrooms --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- and that's plenty for four people, 

B.76:  Yeah, yeah.

A.77:  and if they're light eaters, you can squeeze in six.

B.78:  Yeah, 

A.79:  But,

B.80:  if you, if you wanted to, uh, put a little crunchiness in that, uh, throw
a few cashews in it.

A.81:  Oh, yeah, that's good.

B.82:  [Laughter] Yeah, but, uh, 

A.83:  Uh, my husband is a Chinese cook.  He doesn't do much cooking either, but
he loves to cook Chinese.

B.84:  Right, and, uh,

A.85:  And he has a marvelous, uh, chicken with cashews and,

B.86:  Right, the cashew #chicken is, is, I, I really enjoy that.# 

A.87:  #and the szechuan peppers# now those are not the hot ones --

B.88:  Oh, yeah, just,

A.89:  -- those are the little round pink ones.

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  And oh, they are wonderful.  That, uh, he does that, uh, uh, chicken with
cashews and szechuan peppers and he also, not at the same meal [laughter],

B.92:  [Laughter].

A.93:  does a wonderful vegetable dish with #szechuan.#

B.94:  #Right.#

A.95:  peppers --

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  -- use, that uses either asparagus or, um, [lipsmack] let's see, what does
he use, asparagus is the one we like the best, oh, broccoli --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- you can do the same dish with broccoli, and also, if you're really in a
pinch, you can do it with just celery,

B.100:  Yeah.  We, uh, 

A.101:  and it's pretty good.

B.102:  we also, uh, uh, cook on a, do an occasional dish with, uh, some kind of
a Mexican theme --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- and, uh, we, you know, have discovered that you can make, you know, just
as good a Mexican food with, uh, with chicken, or with even with turkey, we,
we do cook a lot with turkey --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- and it, you can come out with, you know, good spicy Mexican food and,
uh, and make it chicken or, or turkey or something like that instead of going
with the beef.  Like when we make fajitas, we can make, you know, chicken
fajitas --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and, and enjoy them just as well.

A.109:  Oh, I like them too, I think they're great.

B.110:  Yeah and, uh,

A.111:  Uh, we, I've been trying to convince the cook at, uh, at the place where I
work, uh, we are kind of isolated, and so we don't go out to lunch very often,
and we do have an excellent kitchen --

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  -- uh, which is encouraging for people to stay around and, uh, eat and
interact with one another at lunch.  We're a think tank,

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  so that's one of our functions is to [laughter] get people to talk to
each other --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- and she has started cooking, uh, much healthier food, m-, much more, uh,
salad without mayonnaise and, uh, much more [lipsmack] main dishes without
oils and, uh, and vegetable, I mean, and, uh, animal fats.

B.118:  Right.

A.119:  So, I think we're improving our diets.  I don't know whether it's the
California influence, or whether it's everywhere, but.

B.120:  Well, I think it's everywhere.  I, I, I know that, uh, oh, probably at
least half of the people that I know are on some kind of a low fat diet for
one reason or another,

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  or are low fat or no fat.

A.123:  Well, my husband's cholesterol is not real high, but he, his father had,
uh, an early heart attack, and so he is very conscious --

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  -- of his, uh, physical condition, and he walks a lot and tries to get, uh,
to stay,

B.126:  [Noise].

A.127:  in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol, and since I
prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a m-, moderately low cholesterol
diet anyway, that suits me just fine.

B.128:  Yeah.  We have found that, uh, since we've stopped eating so much beef and
pork that when we do eat it, it tends to upset our systems [laughter].

A.129:  Um, yeah, yeah.

B.130:  And, uh, you know, it's, uh, my wife in particular w-, she, uh, she said,
you know, when she eats, uh, some kind of a beef dish, if it's the, the least
bit spicy along with the beef itself, that she really, her, you know, her
stomach really acts up, so --

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  -- so we eat, uh, eat very little beef, and, uh, we just.

A.133:  Yeah, we don't either.  We just eat it once in a great while,

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  and, uh, it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we
know is a big meat [laughter] fan.

B.136:  Right.

A.137:  But there're fewer and fewer of those.

B.138:  Uh-huh {very faintly}.

A.139:  So, we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a
little tiny, uh, [lipsmack] grill.

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  It's, oh, it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide, and we
just put a few charcoals in there and, uh, we can cook a piece of chicken.  We
buy boneless chicken breasts and #save us# --

B.142:  #Uh-huh.#

A.143:  -- ourselves a lot of time.  And that with, uh, d-, have you ever tried
Lawry's Lemon Pepper?

B.144:  Oh, 

A.145:  You can buy it in the grocery store.

B.146:  Yeah, I, I don't know whether we've tried that or not.

A.147:  It's a --

B.148:  I, I know we've got a, we've got a, uh, is that, uh, the salt?

A.149:  -- well, it has sea salt in it.

B.150:  Yes.  I think we've got it.

A.151:  But it's not the same as, they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt, and the
Lawrey's season-, Lemon Pepper --

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  -- and the Lemon Pepper's the one I love on chicken and fish.

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  And, uh, yeah, just barely brush it with oil, grill it, uh, so it's not too
done, and sprinkle a little of that on it, and then I add some lemon thyme
from my garden.

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  [Lipsmack] And that makes an excellent and very easy to fix dinner.

B.158:  Yeah.  You know it's, uh, about fifteen minutes until noon here, and we're,

A.159:  [Laughter].

B.160:  talking about food, and I'm [laughter], I, uh,

A.161:  Well, I hope you have a nice lunch.

B.162:  Yeah, it's been a, it's this is a, this is a good timely conversation, got
my appetite going.

A.163:  [Laughter] I'm just looking at our menu.  Unfortunately we're having a
terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because, uh, we're going
to have Italian sausage and French fries [laughter].

B.164:  [Laughter].

A.165:  [Laughter] I think I may stick to the salad bar today.

B.166:  Right, yeah.  Okay, well, it's been nice talking to you, and, uh,

A.167:  Nice to talk to you too.

B.168:  Or, maybe we can have a good lunch and think about it while we're, uh,
about our conversation while we're eating.

A.169:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
