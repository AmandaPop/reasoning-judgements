=========================================================================

A.1:  I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now.

B.2:  [Talking] I've lost track.  I don't really know.  I, I do have some
opinions, but go ahead.

A.3:  Yeah, um, well I know that they're, they're real cautious about letting
Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism.
#What,# 

B.4:  #Uh,#

A.5:  #What?#

B.6:  #okay#, I hadn't thought about that, uh.

A.7:  What all do you know about it?

B.8:  Uh, well I just have an opinion, now I didn't think, I thought the
terrorism thing was overstated, I mean,

A.9:  [Noise].

B.10:  there was nothing over here.  In fact even, this is not our subject, I
guess, but, uh, maybe it is or isn't, I suppose.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  My wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid, you
know, of how the war was going to go and everything, I said, I told her, no,
it's just not going to happen.  There's not going to be any terrorism over
him, and there wasn't, you know.  They just didn't have an organization, but,
uh, I, I, I'm concerned that we're letting too many, that we don't have enough
controls.  I think that, uh, the Asian gangsters that we've let in here and if
--

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and the guys from, uh, Cuba, you know, there's a lot of criminals down
in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us, and, uh,
and the last, you know, out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a
tremendous criminal element that we let in from, from Asia and I think that --

A.15:  #That's right.#

B.16:  -- #there's got# to be some sort of controls over that.  I mean this Asia
mafia thing is getting out of hand.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I don't, I don't, I didn't know what, I don't even know what our controls
are.  I don't even know what, uh, if we have any guidelines at all, uh, on
immigration.  Um, I always thought that we did, but I don't, I don't, I don't
know what they are right now.

A.19:  There, I don't think there's much of, much of one, because I'm sure all the
people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  And, uh, most of them, it's just like Australia, most of them were
criminals from Cuba --

B.22:  #Yeah.#

A.23:  -- #and# I think that was just an attempt that, that Fidel Castro to
undermine, you know --

B.24:  Yeah.  The,

A.25:  -- the United States to some extent.  So he just released and got rid of
all his criminals and sent them to us.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And it's almost the same thing in, in, uh, from Asia, because {pause} --

B.28:  #Because we,#

A.29:  -- #a lot,# a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the
war, and,

B.30:  I, I do have some sympathy with, uh, you know, of course we have this big
Mexican problem, not a problem, but I think that we need to do something with,
uh, the immigration of back and a-, forth across Mexico, uh --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- I, I'm sympathetic, I don't know what the answer is, I guess.  I'm
sympathetic certainly with that, that, that they want to come over here and
they, I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work.  And if, if
they have jobs, you know, I hear the story that they're taking away American
jobs.  But I don't know, uh, I don't know how many American jobs they are
really taking away.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  So I, I'm sympathetic, but I don't have an answer.  I don't --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- uh, I think that we should have good relations with, with Mexico, but
that's not really exactly immigration.  It is and it isn't.  I don't know to
what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens, owe the
children education and all that, uh, although, the idea of education is an
answer to a lot of problems in the world.  So --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- I guess it's what they, their, the Mexican kids get a good education
along the way, and maybe that's a benefit to everybody, you know.

A.39:  Yeah, and a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the
daytime to come over here and work --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and they have green cards.  And, uh, then, like you said, a lot of, I
run into people every day that can't speak English.

B.42:  Oh, yeah.

A.43:  And, uh, and, and most of them, you know, are working in janitorial
positions so,

B.44:  Yeah.  #And that,#

A.45:  #So, I,# I don't know, like you said, I don't know how much, how much
they're taking from the work force, you know.

B.46:  Yeah, I never thought that they were much.  I do cringe when I hear some of
the problems we've had.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Um, uh, of course you mentioned the language.  I feel so bad that we, here
in Texas, or certainly the southern part of the United States, uh, California,
Texas, and all that, why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish, uh, by junior
high, you know --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- as well as us, you know --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- so that we could, wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.  That,
that, that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico, and then,
in Europe, you know, they speak their French and all and they try, they go out
of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand.
We, we cert-, we don't really even make an effort --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- to speak Spanish, and I feel bad about that {pause}.  Go ahead.

A.55:  Well, that's, I yeah I took Spanish in school, and that's, you know, one
reason that I did it --

B.56:  #Yeah.#

A.57:  -- #is because,# because whenever you travel anywhere near the border, you
know, there more and more people speak Spanish.

B.58:  Yeah, I guess it's never too late.  I, I do have some Spanish books, and
I've always, uh, every year I say I'm going to try to speak some newcomers
language, you know.  I don't know if it's costing us any money or how much
money they're putting into it, uh, that's always a factor, I mean how much, my
wife says, How much the federal government is putting into it --

A.59:  Well --

B.60:  -- immigration.

A.61:  -- yeah, well, it's basically on the, well, I think it's mostly
concentrated toward the borders, and, uh, it's more, um, the immigration is
tied in with, uh, drug trafficking.  So they have to watch out who comes in,
and, and they're always finding drugs on, you know, on the most, um, [talking]
{person calls out in background} innocent looking kind of --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- I forgot what they found, but a dog found it the other day, you know --

B.64:  Oh, yeah.

A.65:  -- on the border.

B.66:  Oh yeah, I, I, I think that certainly is a problem.  I guess our
immigration history, that's a great subject.  They, uh, didn't say to talk
about that, but that is, I mean, on Ellis Island, they, you know they're
redoing that and going to make it a museum, a national museum.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  That certainly was interesting, since all of us had, uh, ancestors that
came over that way.  Or not all, but I guess, I guess if you go back far
enough you came over on a boat originally, you know.  But, uh, a lot of us
have parents, grandparents, my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety
or something like that.  And I'm sure they came over, you know, through Ellis
Island, you know.

A.69:  That's right.  Well.

B.70:  So we all immigrants, one way or another, well we certainly are, coming
from Europe.

A.71:  Yeah, and one of the, one of the things that really gets to me, uh, about
the Mexicans is that, um, once they have children over here, their children
are American citizens then.

B.72:  Oh, yeah, those were laws are unusual.

A.73:  Yeah, and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children
without any parents.  So,

B.74:  Yeah, but I don't understand, whose rule is that, you know.

A.75:  And they, you know, and, and they just follow the rule no matter, you
know.  So that doesn't seem fair to the children.

B.76:  Yeah, sometimes common sense should take over rather than, yeah, that's a
law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all --

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  -- that you would do it that way.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until
they, uh, get citizenship.  I'm sure they want to.

A.81:  Yeah, and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was
that, it was in the eighties some time --

B.82:  Oh, yeah.

A.83:  -- if they could prove they'd been here five years.

B.84:  I heard something about that, yeah.

A.85:  And, uh, a lot of them had been, you know.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Some of them, some of them moved back and forth, but --

B.88:  #Yeah.#

A.89:  -- #uh,# most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico, especially --

B.90:  #Oh no.#

A.91:  -- #the way it was then.#

B.92:  Oh, no, I, I could see, you could see why.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything.  What
the controls are.

A.95:  I think most, you know, like especially the celebrities and everything,
they just have a, uh, well, they have to get a green card if they going to do
any kind of work, you know, in movies --

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  -- and, and such.  But most of them have temporary visas.

B.98:  Yeah.  I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, uh.

A.99:  As long, it's like well, it's a kind of a bad, a bad, bad example, but when
Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it.

B.102:  Oh, really?

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  So that, you know, and that's the thing with the jobs.  

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  And of course no one beat him out.  

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  So, you know.  He just ruined his own career, so.

B.110:  Oh, well yeah.

A.111:  Yeah {pause}.

B.112:  Yeah, well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably
one of the, one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying
to immigrate to.  Uh, although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is
falling apart, that maybe there'll be, won't be that much of a rush to get out
of all the Communist com-, countries, uh, I guess Poland now, now is
noncommunist so --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- maybe not, maybe immigration from Europe to here will s-, you know
slowly, uh, change, maybe it'll be, even out like trade, you know.  So many
people will immigrate here in the twentieth, at the year two thousand, so many
of the people will go back overseas.  You know, maybe it will average out, I
don't know.

A.115:  Yeah, I think #so.#

B.116:  #It# doesn't, has, doesn't seem so far.

A.117:  Because there are other I, j-, uh, job opportunities,

B.118:  [Swallowing].

A.119:  in Europe that there aren't here --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- you know, even, um, like or-, orchestra players can find a job sometimes
[noise] {telephone line noise} in Europe when they can't find one here.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  And I'm a trumpet player.

B.124:  Are you a teacher?

A.125:  Uh, no, I, uh, I don't any more.  I just went to school and I was a music
major for a while.

B.126:  Oh, really, yeah.

A.127:  But I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony.  #So,#
--

B.128:  #Yeah.#

A.129:  -- so he had to have a work visa there.

B.130:  Oh.

A.131:  And of course they had a lot of musicians from, from other countries --

B.132:  #Uh-huh.#

A.133:  -- #and, uh,# in the Mexico City Symphony.

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  But I think, um, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet
section are from Mexico now.

B.136:  Oh, really.

A.137:  But I think the conductor, I don't know, or one of the conductors is, is
from another country.

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  It's like any other symphony.

B.140:  Yeah [/Talking].

A.141:  You know, and then, and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico so he had to,
