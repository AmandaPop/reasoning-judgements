A.1:  Do you have any special menus that you like to use when you're
entertaining?

B.2:  Well, I don't entertain that much anymore, unfortunately. 

A.3:  Yes, but we dream. 

B.4:  If, huh. 

A.5:  We dream though. 

B.6:  [Laughter]  Oh, yes.  Well I mean, you know, like for holidays, the family
gets together, so, uh, I guess you'd call that about the same.  I mean, I don't
have dinner parties, but, uh [laughter], 

A.7:  # Yes.  #

B.8:  # I # have family get-togethers [laughter]. 

A.9:  # Well.  #

B.10:  # Uh, # and I, I guess it's about the same thing, so, uh. 

A.11:  Are you a traditional cook. 

B.12:  Well, no, I, in fact, I love to find different things, uh, I'm always
searching for recipes that are different.  Some things are traditional, okay,
uh, we always have turkey for Thanksgiving. 

A.13:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.14:  But, uh, uh, there, but I always try to add at least one new dish.  Uh, I
find it, uh, interesting,

A.15:  # Yeah.  #

B.16:  # to # vary it. 

A.17:  # I do too.  #

B.18:  # So that, uh, # uh, but, uh, wha-, I, you know, it, you can do a lot of
things.  The meat is, is pretty standard, usually. 

A.19:  Sure. 

B.20:  I mean you pick a different kind of, you pick whatever kind of meat you're
going to have and, um, you, uh, can do ju-, a few things with it, you know. 
But, uh, I mean,

A.21:  # Then you can, #

B.22:  # as far as # salads or vegetables, there are so many things that you can
do these days,

A.23:  # Oh, yes.  #

B.24:  # that, uh, # it makes it quite a challenge and it depends on whose coming
too. 

A.25:  # Yes.  #

B.26:  # Uh, # for a holiday family get-together I don't make any, you know, I'm
not real picky about exactly what it is, but if we're just getting, together,
uh, you know, for a family, uh, [popping]  dinner then I try to keep it as, uh,
fat free and as cholesterol free, and, you know, all that other stuff, as I can
[throat_clearing]. 

A.27:  Yes, I have a son-in-law who is a wonderful cook, and, uh, my daughter
reads cookbooks and he cooks.  But, uh, for the last few years, I have, uh,
had something different for him every holiday.  Uh, for Christmas, or
Thanksgiving, which ever one they're with us.  And, uh, I think the two,
[throat_clearing] that have been the biggest hits, uh, I think one of them
came out of the Martha Stewart cookbook.  You're familiar with Martha Stewart
and her,

B.28:  # Right, oh yes.  #

A.29:  # all her culinary # delights. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  And it was, it wasn't, all that, you know, yummy, an, it wasn't a lot to
eat but it was interesting.  Carameli-, caramelized onions.

B.32:  Oh, interesting. 

A.33:  And, uh, you cut them in half and turn them over, with the cu-, you know,
don't peel them or anything, and turn them over,

B.34:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.35:  # with # the cut side down, and you bake them like two hours and a half on
about two seventy-five or something like that.  And then, when, you know,
until they're kind of, well not really burned they call them caramelized and
then you, uh, you mix up this little, uh, mixture of cranberries and sugar and
a few nuts and, uh, a little bit of liquid and then you bake that for about
thirty minutes, and then you, it's just a really pretty condiment r-,
actually.

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  And so, then you just eat the insides, you know, the few layers of onions
that didn't get hard or anything and then, uh, then that filling. 

B.38:  # [Popping].  #

A.39:  # But # that was interesting and another interesting one that he liked so
well was turnips.  I've always had a neighbor or two that ha-, wanted to bring
me turnips.  Well who, not many people like turnips. 

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  But I did a casserole using half turnips, half potatoes, swiss cheese, milk
and butter and just baked them and it,

B.42:  # Um [popping].  #

A.43:  # it's absolutely # wonderful.  It's and the secret is using half potatoes.

B.44:  Right, yeah, I could see that would be, then it wouldn't be such a, an
overpowering flavor, you know, it would be, uh, just, just a flavor but not,
you know, the real strong.  That's the only thing, turnips have such a strong
flavor to them.

A.45:  And that swiss,

B.46:  # Now I love them raw, but, [laughter].  #

A.47:  # Oh, I do too, oh especially so # many people like them to dip in
vegetable dip, too, I think.

B.48:  Now, you know, speaking of vegetable dip, I was introduced t-, uh, to
something, by a girlfriend of mine recently that I never would have dreamed of
because, of, you know, usually when you think of a vegetable, uh, tray you
think of, uh, uh, broccoli or cauliflower and, and celery and the, you know,
standard things.

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  Have you ever tried using raw sweet potato?

A.51:  No! Well I'm glad to hear about that. 

B.52:  Tr-, try it.  I was, she, I picked it up, I thought it was carrot at first,

A.53:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.54:  # you # know, we were, she just had a veggie tray and I picked it up and
tasted, I said, gee this doesn't taste like carrot.  She said it isn't, so I
took another one just to see if I could figure out what it was, and I couldn't
and she told me it was raw sweet potato and, um, it is, I do, I do not like
sweet potatoes cooked,

A.55:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.56:  # I # do not like them at all.  Uh, I'm really do enjoy them raw
[laughter]. 

A.57:  # Well I'll be darned, and you've eaten them, #

B.58:  # I-, with this, it's, it's not a real, # uh, strong flavor, you know, it's
just kind of a light flavor. 

A.59:  Do you know when I was growing up my mother wouldn't let us eat raw sweet
potatoes. 

B.60:  # Huh.  #

A.61:  # She # said they were poison. 

B.62:  [Laughter]  My goodn-,

A.63:  So we just, [laughter],  you know, raw potatoes, yes if she was peeling
potato and we were, you know, she'd, we'd want a piece,

B.64:  # Right.  #

A.65:  # and, # uh, but she wouldn't ever let us, so I suppose that is a myth,
isn't it. 

B.66:  [Laughter]  Oh, yes, um, I hope so because of I've sure eaten a lot of it
since I was first introduced to it, uh. 

A.67:  Yeah, you're still alive and kicking. 

B.68:  Yeah.  But, uh, uh, people are quite surprised to find out, it's just not
one of the things that you would think of of putting on the vegetable plate. 

A.69:  No, and it is colorful too. 

B.70:  It is colorful, adds a lot of color to your tray. 

A.71:  Well I have spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma.  And so I've had a
wonderful time with the Mexican type dishes,

B.72:  # Oh, I love that.  #

A.73:  # the Santa Fe influence # as well as the Tex-Mex. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  And I have so many wonderful recipes, and my family here, I, we're
originally from this part of the country and,

B.76:  # Uh-huh [popping].  #

A.77:  # if I # do any of those casseroles, especially, they will say, um, this is
sort of spicy [laughter]. 

B.78:  [Laughter]  Yes I know, it's funny. 

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.80:  # N-, # see I'm originally from California and my husband was from New
Mexico and, uh, the first ten years we were in Maryland my sister-in-law
mailed us care packages of chili peppers and, uh, things that you co-,
condiments that you couldn't get for Mexican cooking, here, Spanish cooking,
[laughter] you know, that, uh, uh, and now of course I can get them all he-,
you know, here in Maryland because it's become popular out here too, and they
have several Mexican restaurants.  But when we first moved here, twenty years
ago, we couldn't find any kind of, you know, except for,

A.81:  Finally the Taco Bell started springing up. 

B.82:  Yes, uh, well we have several, uh, very, you know, Chi Chi's, uh, very nice
restaurants that, uh, serve, uh, uh, real good, you know, Mexican food. 

A.83:  # Yeah.  #

B.84:  # But, # but I know, um, I have visited my sister-in-law in New Mexico once
or twice and, um, it is, it's always refreshing because it's so, she always
fixes something different that I've, you know, not had.  So, uh, I need to, to
try a few more recipes and [laughter].  But you're right, anybody that tastes
it, [breathing] even the mild, they are so surprised [laughter] that it's, uh,
that spicy.

A.85:  Yeah, they really don't, my friends and relatives really don't like it very
well. 

B.86:  Huh-uh, not if it's spicy [laughter]. 

A.87:  # Uh-huh, well it, #

B.88:  # Now you have # to either go completely, you know, and let them add the,
uh, like the salsa or the sauce to it, um, or, um, well it depends on what
you're making.  If you're making enchiladas it's hard to do that. 

A.89:  # Really.  #

B.90:  # But, # uh, well it's hard to let them add their own, you know, just to
make it spicy, you can, even the enchilada sauce is a little bit spicy. 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  Well it's been fun talking to you. 

B.92:  Well it's nice talking to you. 

A.93:  And, uh, good luck in your, uh, entertaining, or cooking, #or get-togethers
or whatever, and dream on.# 

B.94:  #[Laughter]  Oh, yes well you too.#  You too, thank you. 

A.95:  Bye-bye.
