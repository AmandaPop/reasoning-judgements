=========================================================================

A.1:  Great.

B.2:  Um, are you, what, what type of music do you like?

@A.3:  Uh, I like, uh, n-, probably cutting edge rock would be the best way to
describe it.

B.4:  Oh, well then I'm sure we're going to have a lot in common [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter]  Good deal.

B.6:  [Laughter] I'm just joking.  What exactly is #cutting edge rock?#

A.7:  #Cutting edge rock.# Oh, I don't know, you got your top forty rock, which I
just can't stand, top forty music.

B.8:  Oh really [laughter].  Uh-huh.

A.9:  The stuff you'd see on M T V and V H One and what have you.  And then
there's new music, come from, we've got a radio station down here that, uh,
started broadcasting about a year ago, and they've, uh, they play music that
you just wouldn't hear on any other radio station.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  More like a, it's more like a college station --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- would play.  Which we don't have down here, but, uh, it's just music by
different groups,

B.14:  I see.

A.15:  and, you know, things you wouldn't, you wouldn't, uh --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- you wouldn't, would never be exposed to.

B.18:  Is it music that, um, like you can understand the words to?

A.19:  [Laughter] Yeah, most of it.

B.20:  Oh, okay.  Well the, the thing that I hate really is music that, um, it
just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of
music.  Do you know what I mean?

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  Like, didn't seem like it was mean-,

A.23:  Kind of noise.

B.24:  What?

A.25:  Noise.

B.26:  Yeah, it's nois-, it just doesn't seem like it was supposed to be played at
the same time, together or that someone isn't tuned, or whatever.  But, um, I
have to admit, I do love Top Forty, and, um, although I don't watch M T V, I
do love that type of music.  But,

A.27:  We-,

B.28:  I feel like it's the best music that you can sing along to, and dance --

A.29:  Yeah, yeah.

B.30:  -- and, um, I'm an aerobics freak.  So I just, uh, I love that type of
music to do aerobics to and exercise and that sort of thing.  Do you go out to
listen to music a lot?

A.31:  Do I go out to listen to music?  

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Well, I go to school and work.  So I don't get --

B.34:  Don't get much time.

A.35:  -- too, too many opportunities to, uh, go out and see a, a live band,
although occasionally --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- I'll go downtown.  They have what they call Deep Ellum down here where a
lot of local --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- bands play, and I've gone down there a few times.  

B.40:  Do you play any sort of instrument?

A.41:  No --

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  -- I'm musically destitute.

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  Have no talents.

B.46:  Oh, don't be silly.  I used to play the piano, and I used to play the
guitar, but then when I moved out, you don't get to take the piano with you.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  And, uh, there's no guitar around.  So I decided just to turn on the radio,
and that'll be my musical entertainment from now on.  But, We don't get to go,
I love concerts.  If I could, I would save my money and just go to concerts.
But obviously, not only is, they don't come around Rochester too often, but,
um, standing in line for hours on end doesn't really appeal to me either.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah, I used to go.  I, when I first moved to Dallas several years
ago I've gone to a few concerts, but it just, it just gets to be more of a
hassle than it's worth.

B.50:  Yeah, exactly.

A.51:  Yeah, and you get a lot of thirteen and fourteen year olds, and it's just a
crowd of little kids.

B.52:  I know, and then by the time you leave, you end up like sitting in your car
for an hour just to get out of the parking lot.

A.53:  Yeah.  We usually go down.  And there's a tower that they have downtown.
You go down and have a couple of drinks and wait for traffic to go away.

B.54:  Do you have a good, um, stadium there, or, or,

A.55:  It's, it's an indoor arena.

B.56:  Oh right, what's it called?

A.57:  Reunion.

B.58:  Oh, Reunion, no that's not what I'm thinking about. Wasn't,

A.59:  There's one, there's the Bronco Bowl, that's out in Fort Worth though.

B.60:  I don't know what I'm thinking of.

A.61:  Arlington Stadium.  

B.62:  Oh.

A.63:  There's several big things down in --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- down here.  Most of the, most of the concerts are out at Reunion Arena.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  And it's, it's okay.  The, the acoustics could be better, but, 

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  like I say, I haven't been down there to a concert since, jeez, I don't
remember who I went to see last.

B.70:  Well now, you have to like the Beatles and Billy Joel and (( )), 

A.71:  I like the Beatles, some Billy Joel, you know, like in high school I guess
I --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- was a big Billy Joel fan, but, I've been,

B.74:  Sort of grown out of that?

A.75:  Well, you know, I listen to it, but I won't go buy it.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  I've, I've, like I've been exposed to so many new and different bands
lately, just through this new radio station, that I realize there's just a lot
of, a lot of things I've, I never would have heard or even thought of looking
at, or listening to and, 

B.78:  Like, who are some of those bands?  What are they called?

A.79:  Oh, I'm trying to think of a good example, one that won't get me into too
much trouble, um,

B.80:  Who won't get you into too much trouble [laughter]?

A.81:  [Laughter] Yeah, be a bad example.  But like, for example, the violent ((
)).  They've been around for a while --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- and they've just started playing some new music of theirs, and it --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- made me go out and buy some and listen to it. 

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  I won't say I like the whole album really, but, uh,

B.88:  Well, you know, I was just reading the newspaper, and, um, there's this big
thing on Madonna's new movie, TRUTH OR DARE.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  Have you heard about that?

A.91:  Yeah, I was reading an article about that yesterday.

B.92:  And, um, well, I haven't seen the movie, but obviously it looks extremely
risqu3e, and, um, they were just mentioning some figures that she's made, like
in the past year she made thirty-nine million dollars, and over the past
couple of years, it's totalled almost two hundred million dollars, and, I
mean, as much as I like Top Forty, I don't like Madonna.  I don't like her and
I don't like her music, and, um, I just don't like [laughter] anything about
her, actually.

A.93:  The only thing I like about Madonna is, I think if, if I was given a ticket
to see her perform --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- I think she'd be entertaining to see perform.

B.96:  Probably, yeah.

A.97:  But I don't, I don't really care for her music.  There's one or two songs
that I liked, you know, for a while --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- until they overplayed them to death.

B.100:  Right, exactly.

A.101:  But, uh, I've never been a big Madonna fan, but I do think if someone gave
me a ticket, it'd be a really entertaining show.

B.102:  Yeah, that's true.

A.103:  I wouldn't go stand in line or sleep overnight at the,

B.104:  But, I know, oh, God, no.  But to think that she's able to make that much
money.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  Just think of, I mean, that is what our kids are growing up with right now.
You know, that their, that they were talking about how Madonna is becoming a
role model for kids.

A.107:  That's crazy.

B.108:  And, uh, boy, it's really scary.  [laughter] I don't know, but, I guess I,
I still go back to the old faithfuls like James Taylor and, if I c-, if I had
my choice to sit and listen to, um, oh, I don't know, some new group of today
or just, uh, put on a tape of, I don't know, Carly Simon or whatever, that's
probably what I would stick to.  Although I do have, uh, an unending love for
fifties music, which you probably detest.

A.109:  Some, no, there's some, my parents, you know, I used to listen to the stuff
they listen to --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- you know, the Guess Who and what have you.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  I've got some of that.  Uh, I don't, I won't say I make tapes to listen to
in my car, but,

B.114:  [Laughter].

A.115:  occasionally I put on ((L C D)) and --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- crank it up because, I'm, 

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  you know, the stuff I grew up with --

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  -- listening to so,

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  I'm, I've got pretty broad musical tastes.  I don't really care for gospel,
and I'm not a big country fan, but,

B.124:  Me, either.

A.125:  other than that I'll listen to just about anything.

B.126:  Yeah.  Do you have, uh, any sort of collection?  Are you like, uh, you
know, do you go out and buy a bunch of C D -s or tapes or,

A.127:  Yeah, I've got some, I've got, I don't know, about a hundred, hundred and
fifteen C D -s I suppose.

B.128:  Do you really?

A.129:  I just, I've got a bunch of albums, but I never play them because C D -s
have taken over.

B.130:  Yeah, exactly, they really have.  We were talking about, um, how the only
way to really destroy a C D is to drill a hole through it.

A.131:  Yeah [laughter].

B.132:  That you can microwave them, and, uh, I don't know, do whatever.  Really an
amaz-,

A.133:  You can scratch them up pretty good and they'll still play.

B.134:  yeah, amazing. But, well, it was nice talking to you.

A.135:  Yes so, go out and play in that sun.

B.136:  Yeah, right, and I'll have to turn on my James Taylor tape or something
[laughter].

A.137:  [Laughter] All right.

B.138:  All righty.  Take care.

A.139:  Okay. Bye. 

B.140:  Bye-bye.
