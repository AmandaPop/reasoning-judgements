==============================================================================

A.1:  What part of the country are you in?

B.2:  [Barking] Uh, Pennsylvania.  Yeah.

A.3:  Oh, you are?  East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh.

B.4:  Oh, are you really? 

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  What part of Pittsburgh?

A.7:  Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County ((
)).

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And, uh, where are you from?

B.10:  Uh, Clarion County.

A.11:  Oh, okay, I know where that is.

B.12:  I li-, we live out in the country.

A.13:  Yeah, that's pretty out there.  What, well,

B.14:  Yeah, we have, we have two children that live in Pittsburgh [laughter].

A.15:  Oh, okay, yeah, I got my brother and my whole family there.  I'm, I'm
talking to you from Dallas right now.

B.16:  Oh, oh, you are?

A.17:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.18:  Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then?

A.19:  No, my husband does.

B.20:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.21:  And who, how about you?

B.22:  No, I'm just, my son works for a c-, a computer,

A.23:  place that, that needed this.

B.24:  Uh, federal company, you know, so, yeah.

A.25:  Well that's okay.  I guess it's an easy thing to do.  So you're f-, you
have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?

B.26:  Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've --

A.27:  Oh, that's a,

B.28:  -- you know, remodeled.

A.29:  Those are beautiful.

B.30:  It had been, you know, of course, a farm.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  It's a farm community, and we.

A.33:  Yeah, is it a, is it a working farm or is it?

B.34:  Ours is not a working farm [laughter].

A.35:  More, more, I can understand that, that's probably what I would, uh, 

B.36:  Yeah, I have a garden but you know, we have a garden.  

A.37:  Yeah --

B.38:  But we don't farm.

A.39:  -- I can hear the accent now I hear the [laughter],

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.

B.42:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

A.43:  We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.  

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  We, we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh, and that's, that's not
what they want to hear on this call, uh --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around,
uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they
call North Dallas.

B.52:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.53:  And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano, well, it's not little any
more.

B.54:  Uh, Grapevine, do you know Grapevine?

A.55:  Uh, yes, that's out near the airport.  That's about forty-five miles from
us.

B.56:  Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell.  He, he's living now
up, uh, in, in Maryland but, uh, he,

A.57:  It's, yeah,

B.58:  [Static] li-, lived in Grapevine for a long time.

A.59:  That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here,
because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um,
Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean --

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.61:  -- you know, in terms of, and in terms of housing down here, um, you really
have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.

B.62:  Oh, it's terrible.  I,

A.63:  It really is, I mean we're, we're in a leased town home, and it's, uh,
you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's
nine hundred a month.

B.64:  Oh, I'm not surprised.

A.65:  But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get
into what they call high density living --

B.66:  Uh, right, right.

A.67:  -- you know, the big apartment complexes --

B.68:  Right, right.

A.69:  -- and, and I just have no tolerance for that.

B.70:  Yeah, yeah, it's not good [laughter].  

A.71:  No.  I pre-, 

B.72:  And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but
when they sit down and look at what it costs to live --

A.73:  That's right.

B.74:  -- and, uh, [static] of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly
nice, they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh, 

A.75:  Yeah but like the town home we're in.  I don't know how, I mean, we, this
is, it's like a duplex, like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.

B.76:  Right, uh-huh, right.

A.77:  And it's nice but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  and now she can't sell it.  And our neighbors,

B.80:  Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.

A.81:   Yeah, I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side,
they're very nice, thank God, 

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  they paid fifty-eight for it.

B.84:  Oh, my heaven.

A.85:  That's how bad it, I know.  

B.86:  Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, and, uh, it's --

A.87:  That's right.

B.88:  -- people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.

A.89:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really,
really bad.  I mean you,

B.90:  But we like our area.  It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and
everything --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- but, uh,

A.93:  How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually, because we're
considering moving to Pennsylvania [laughter].

B.94:  [Laughter] Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh --

A.95:  That's not too bad.

B.96:  -- north.

A.97:  That's north.

B.98:  And yeah, and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.

A.99:  Are you going up toward, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of the name of that
town that starts with an M, Bradford, no that's too far north.

B.100:  Bradford's north of us.

A.101:  So you're, you're not that far north then, okay.

B.102:  No, no.

A.103:  Well, you're really not too bad.  Yeah.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a f-, few years, or that
you've,

B.106:  Well, we've been here since sixty-six.

A.107:  Oh, then you have, yeah.  Do you have a lot of land or,

B.108:  Uh, we have fifty acres.

A.109:  Oh, my, well, then.

B.110:  Oh, pardon me, we have forty, we gave ten to one of our children
[laughter].

A.111:  There you go.  Did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like
you live in an isolated area or,

B.112:  No, not really, and, and towns keep creeping closer and closer, you know.

A.113:  Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has
to do with homes, uh, indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair
was out in the, you know,

B.114:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.115:  the rural end of Washington, and now it's [static] it's a terrible
connection.

B.116:  Yeah, it's ours up here.  We have, our rural connections are real bad
[laughter].

A.117:  Oh, well that's okay, um,

B.118:  But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large
towns but, you know, reasonable.

A.119:  But, but, sub-, yeah, substantially, you know.  Um, do you like living in
an older home and restoring it like that?

B.120:  Uh, yeah, we're tired of doing it though.  We, we don't want to do too much
more [laughter].

A.121:  [Laughter] How big is it?  How many square feet do you have?

B.122:  Uh, oh, golly, I really.

A.123:  Well how many rooms do you think, yeah?

B.124:  We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry --

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  -- and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh we, have a half bath downstairs,
too.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing
room and a junk room [laughter].  And, uh,

A.129:  A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too.  That's, that's large if
your children aren't at home any more.

B.130:  Pardon?

A.131:  That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.

B.132:  Well, it really isn't too big yet.  We, we li-, a lot of people say that
but, um,

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  it's, we just like it real well and,

A.135:  It's enough space for two people [laughter].  Yeah.

B.136:  Yeah, we had five children, so --

A.137:  Oh, okay.

B.138:  -- and they've all moved [laughter], you know, on.  They're all out on
their own now.

A.139:  Yeah, right.  That's okay.  Well, we've got, um, th-, this town house is
pretty big.  It's about eighteen hundred square feet.  It's got three
bedrooms, two and a half baths --

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  -- um, it's really nice.

B.142:  Well, it sounds like a good buy.

A.143:  Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know.  Um, we had a house
in Minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a
working farm near Dayt-,

B.146:  Oh, that makes a big difference.

A.147:  right, near Dayton, Ohio, and he said, you know, he's, he's slowly getting
me to, um, not feel isolated if we move t-, to where there's more land.

B.148:  Uh-huh.  You really aren't isolated because it's, the advantages, your
home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people,

A.149:  Right.

B.150:  but yet you can have your friends, uh, you can have them in, you can go
out.

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  You have more of a choice, you're not pressed upon as bad.

A.153:  That's kind of what, like his parents have, uh, land that they retired to,
um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta --

B.154:  Uh-huh.

A.155:  -- and, in Georgia, and it is too far south for me,

B.156:  Uh, uh-huh.

A.157:  but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log
cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these.  I
mean, it's just beautiful.

B.158:  Uh.

A.159:  It's like a custom, you know --

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  -- it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins.
[laughter].

B.162:  [Laughter].  

A.163:  You know, I mean, it's modern it's,

B.164:  More luxury.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.165:  Right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country --

B.166:  Right, yeah.

A.167:  -- it's you know, um, but, uh, I don't, what else about housing except
it's, uh, well, Pittsburgh's housing economy, i-, i-, I think it's holding
it's own.

B.168:  Uh, they're, yeah, I suppose they are now.  We, both of our children who
live there have just bought a home.  Now,

A.169:  What part, what sections are they in?

B.170:  Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area.

A.171:  Yeah, that's nice.

B.172:  And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable.
They didn't have to do much to it.

A.173:  Great.

B.174:  The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done.  It's twenty
years old, I think.

A.175:  Uh-huh.

B.176:  And, but they have two children, too, and they, they --

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  -- bought what they could afford.

A.179:  That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, and they've
been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now --

B.180:  Uh-huh.

A.181:  -- and, um, it's, it's, you know, they're s-, going to start to see their
return --

B.182:  Uh-huh.

A.183:  -- on their investment very soon.  Um, but it's a beautiful home and,

B.184:  They are beautiful homes.

A.185:  I mean, my brother lives, is it called Baldwin or Bebble?

B.186:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.187:  I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um, it's
real pretty up there.  It's just,

B.188:  It is, it's real nice.

A.189:  And the neighborhoods are stable --

B.190:  Uh-huh.

A.191:  -- you know.  It's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've
been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.

B.192:  Oh, my you wou-, you do when you mo-.  When we first got married, uh, my
husband works for the state, and we moved once a year usually [laughter].

A.193:  Oh, my goodness.

B.194:  And then after they had to start paying to move us, 

A.195:  Uh-huh.

B.196:  that suddenly wasn't necessary any more [laughter].

A.197:  [Laughter] That's what it is here, yeah, that's why we're at a point now
we've, uh, we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what
happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next
house that you get [beep] {high pitch} we'll be staying in [laughter].  So.

B.198:  Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah.

A.199:  Yeah, that's kind of like --

B.200:  Yeah.

A.201:  -- where we're, so we're considering Pennsylvania, and we're just kind of,
you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.

B.202:  Uh-huh.

A.203:  A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice
house and,

B.204:  Well,

A.205:  but I disagree with that, I.

B.206:  I do too, I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.

A.207:  Uh-huh.

B.208:  You know, they buy a place and they just hate the area.

A.209:  I know, and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady,
but it's still not going up.

B.210:  Uh-huh.

A.211:  And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be
there for at least --

B.212:  Uh-huh.

A.213:  -- five years, uh, you, you know.

B.214:  Yeah, well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.

A.215:  Oh, I'm sure, yeah, there, I mean, you can go down a street, and here, he
told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on --

B.216:  Right, uh-huh.

A.217:  -- or, you know, even big executives --

B.218:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

A.219:  -- um, it's really, I mean, a-, and, and it's hard to sell the properties.
People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.

B.220:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.221:  And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get
a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no
property, Jean.

B.222:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.223:  And it would make you ill to see this.  

B.224:  Yeah.

A.225:  I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city
block in Pittsburgh or something.

B.226:  I, I couldn't handle that [laughter].

A.227:  Yeah, I know, and that's, you know, like I can look outside right now and
look into the next unit.

B.228:  Uh-huh.

A.229:  You know, it's across the way, and it's landscaped and all that with
azaleas, 

B.230:  Uh-huh.

A.231:  but it's still, it's still not that private.

B.232:  I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, [laughter] because we mow, you know, a
good bit of ground around the house area.

A.233:  Yeah but you have a rider.

B.234:  And I do get tired of that but, uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want
to change it.

A.235:  No, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can
keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
