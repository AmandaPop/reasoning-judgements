@A.1:  Okay, Catharine, can you, uh, give me your views on, uh, what you think
about the, uh, care of elderly?

B.2:  Well, I would, I hate to see them being put into a hair ca-, or a health
facility care environment, because they then feel like, you know, the family
has abandoned them, is what I get, the comments from elderly people that I
know that it's happened to.  And the elderly people that I [throat_clearing]
that are still hanging onto their homes, that is their greatest fear, is to be
put into a, a, a care facility, rather than their families taking them in.
Because the families then seem to neglect visiting them.  But if that is the
case that they have to go to a care facility like that, I think that care
facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the, uh, medical, um,
evaluation, what kind of credentials do the medical people hold, uh, if
they're qualified, uh, what type of recreation do they have for them, uh,
their food, uh, situation, um, the environment that they are exposed to the
majority of the time that they're there, is it bright and cheery, and to put
them in with people that have the same type of, uh, life-style, uh, that they
would feel more welcome in, uh, in making new friends because they can relate
to certain individuals because of their personalities.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Um, so I guess I would like to hear how you feel about it now, Ray.

A.5:  Uh, we just went through an experience, um, both my parents passed away
fairly young, and, uh --

B.6:  Oh, my,

A.7:  -- my wife's mother died when she was only nine years old, so the only one
that we really had was her father [throat_clearing].

B.8:  I, I see.

A.9:  And, uh, uh, he's no longer with us.  He passed away when he was, uh, he
was going on eighty-nine years old, so he had a good long life.

B.10:  Yes, he did, uh-huh.

A.11:  But he always maintained his own apartment.  He lived in the city, he lived
in, uh, Rhode Is-, in fact we live in Rhode Island.  I work in, in the
Massachusetts plant, but I live in Rhode Island.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  He's always lived in the, in the city, and he's always been kind of
independent.

B.14:  That's wonderful.

A.15:  He's, uh --

B.16:  That's good.

A.17:  -- he's never had a, a, never owned an automobile, never had a driver's
license, you know he's always,

B.18:  So he was very independent, wasn't he [laughter].

A.19:  Yeah, he got around, yeah, because he lived right down --

B.20:  Yes.

A.21:  -- down city in the port authorities right there.  So he used to take the
steamer down to New York, and you know, I mean, he went --

B.22:  Wow, that's wonderful.

A.23:  -- yeah, he went everywhere he wanted to go.

B.24:  Sure, he, it didn't have any hindrances for him.

A.25:  No.  And then about a year and a half ago he, uh, he started having mini
strokes --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and we got kind of concerned about him, and then, uh, he had fallen in
the street a couple of times but --

B.28:  Oh, bless his heart.

A.29:  -- he, uh, he still didn't want to give up his apartment --

B.30:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and, uh, finally, a year ago last Thanksgiving, um, my wife tried to
call him and he wouldn't answer the phone.  So we kind of expected the worse.
So I went down --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and he had had another stroke, and, uh, I found him, he was just, he was
just standing in the middle of the room, all covered with shaving cream.  He
always trying to shave, and he didn't know who I was, so we brought him up to,
to, uh, stay with us.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  And, uh, he, he snapped out of it.  He, uh, he was probably, uh, say,
ninety-five percent himself.

B.36:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.37:  And in, in the course of the next, during the next year towards, again it
was getting on towards Thanksgiving time, he started having, you know, more
strokes, and then, uh, one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the
hospital --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and while he was in the hospital he had a, a massive stroke, and it
crippled him, on one side, his right side --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- so he didn't have the use of, of his arm or his leg, or, and then, uh,
he lost the ability to speak, and we're not sure, but we think that he was
very hard of hearing to begin with, almost his whole entire life.

B.42:  I see.

A.43:  So we figured that, uh, his hearing deteriorated even further and his
eyesight.  Um, we did as much as we could for him, and then it got to the
point where we couldn't handle him anymore.

B.44:  Sure, I understand that.

A.45:  Um, I was working during the day, and, and, uh, my wife couldn't, she, she
couldn't get him up.

B.46:  Uh-huh, sure.

A.47:  So, the alternative was to put him back in the hospital, which we did --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and they took care of him, you know, and he slowly deteriorated, and uh,
to the point where he became fairly stable, I mean, he, he knew who we were
when we went in to visit him, even though he couldn't communicate with us.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And then they said that, um, there was nothing more that they could do for
him and he had to go into a nursing home.  The doctor said that he couldn't
come back with us --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- because we couldn't take care of him.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  And we started looking around, and they said no.  The first nursing home
that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go.  So
we didn't have much of a choice.

B.56:  Wow, I didn't know that they were that, uh,

A.57:  Well, at least up here.  Um, so he went in there anyhow, and my wife went
in there every day to see him, and, you know she,

B.58:  Were you satisfied with, uh, the facility?

A.59:  Uh, at first, at first, no.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  It's, uh, it's very cold, or at least we thought it was.  They're very
clinical, they're, it's like a, well it's a business.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  You get them in, you do what you have to do for them, and that's it.

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  Um, so we go on weekends, and she would go during the day to, to visit 
him --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and they had a laundry, you know, they had the whole facility was there.
But closed up most of the time.  So she'd go in and do his laundry for him,
and she'd go in and feed him, and, and it got to the point where, um, they, we
knew them just as much as they knew us, and, and they really cared for him at,
you know, he was in there for almost six months.

B.68:  So you established a relationship with the, uh, the personnel there.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.69:  With the nursing home, right.  Um, and it was run, the nursing home was run
by, uh, regular staff, but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists --

B.70:  Okay.

A.71:  -- which was a surprise to us.  You know, we didn't realize that they had,
I guess --

B.72:  Well, then you did see some compassion from the people there --

A.73:  -- Uh, but most of the people were,

B.74:  -- or were they just very businesslike and perhaps not of that faith.

A.75:  Well, they didn't have anything to do with it, they owned it.

B.76:  Okay.

A.77:  But they, I suppose they cared how it was run, but they had an
administrator that ran it, and, and most of the people were, um, uh, aliens --

B.78:  Okay,

A.79:  -- you know, uh, Jamaicans, or Africans or --

B.80:  Okay, yes.

A.81:  -- and they, they took real good care of him.  He had lost a pair of
slippers one day, and one of them, out of her own money, bought a pair of
slippers for him, and, you know, that type of thing.

B.82:  I see, uh-huh.

A.83:  But I think only because my wife spent so much time there.

B.84:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.85:  I mean, she was there every single day during the week, and then on
weekends we would go in, the both of us --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- and she would do things, and she would donate little things, and she'd
help clean up the tables --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- and you know, that type of thing.  So --

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  -- um, but you're right, when most, when most people end up in there, and I
hear it from a lot of elderly people, their greatest --

B.92:  Sure.

A.93:  -- fear is that they're going to end up there and nobody's going to see
them.

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  They'll be abused, because you hear horror stories, all the time.

B.96:  Oh, yes, sure.

A.97:  But if you care, then it makes a difference.  Those people --

B.98:  Oh absolutely, absolutely,

A.99:  -- that have a, a lot of visitors --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and we had a gentleman that, that, uh, let's see, maybe about a week
after my father-in-law was in there, he shared his room.  He came in, he could
get around fairly well.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  He again had a, had a stroke, and he was partially paralyzed.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  But he was young enough where they gave him therapy, and he was beginning
to move up, but he could talk [laughter] and tell us things, Oh, you want to
see what they're doing here, and do you want to see this, but don't --

B.106:  So he kind o-,

A.107:  -- tell anybody, you know [laughter],

B.108:  Yeah, so he kind of adopted you and your wife.

A.109:  Yeah, 

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  yeah, in fact, uh, we go down to see him, she goes down occasionally,
maybe, maybe, uh, once or twice a week, just to see him --

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  -- and, uh, I'll stop in maybe once or-, once or twice a month on the
weekend, I'll go down to see him.

B.114:  Well, I'm sure he looks forward to that.

A.115:  Uh, yes, but he gets out, he can get out.  You know, he can, he's got a lot
of friends, and they take him here and they take him there.  So he's not as,
as bad off as some of the people.  Because some of them are in there, and in
the six months that my father-in-law was in there --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- um, I've, I've seen a lot of them that didn't have any visitors
whatsoever.

B.118:  Right, yeah.

A.119:  At least while I was there.

B.120:  They're abandoned by their families, yeah.

A.121:  Yeah, they just,

B.122:  Or they might not have any at all.

A.123:  Yeah, and, uh, we had an old dog, an old shepherd.  They were inseparable,
my father-in-law --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- and the dog.  We brought the dog down there, and --

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  -- it was nice and all the old people, Oh, look at the dog.

B.128:  Oh, yes.

A.129:  Well, most people don't do that, you know.

B.130:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.131:  They don't, they don't, they figure once you're in there you forget
everything, and that's, that's really not the case.  And it's, it's sad, um, I
hope that I never get into that situation where --

B.132:  Of course, yes.

A.133:  -- you know, the kids will say, Well, okay dad, you know, here you go.

B.134:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.135:  I think I'll walk off into the mountains somewhere, or out into the,

B.136:  Like the old Indian people used to do [laughter],

A.137:  [Laughter] But, yeah, yeah, and, you know, and there's something to say for
that, I think.

B.138:  Well, yes, they died with dignity, didn't they.

A.139:  Right, they do, and, and the people that have families that don't,
