A.1:  Okay.  Are you currently active in any type of exercise program?

@B.2:  No.

A.3:  You're not?

B.4:  [laughter] No.  I get enough without having to do it.  [/laughter] If I
exercised I'd be too thin.

A.5:  Is that right?

B.6:  Uh-huh.  I just have one of those metabolisms that, um --

A.7:  Doesn't require exercise.

B.8:  -- doesn't require it, really.  

A.9:  #I#, 

B.10:  #If# I, if, yeah.

A.11:  I wish I had such luck.  

B.12:  Well I think you kind of are born with those type of genes.

A.13:  My wife is that way.  I, uh, course I've always, uh, I've always been in
fairly good condition but --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and I do exercise.  Uh, lately I've been off of it because I've had
shoulder problems, but, uh, that seems to be on the mend, and I think I'm
pretty close to getting back on a program again.

B.16:  Well, I did have a program of walking because I enjoyed doing it in the
evening and I had a dog at that time, and I walked him, and I kind of lost
like ten pounds, and I said whoa. [laughter]  Better stop.

A.17:  I do notice as I get older, I, I tend to, I, you know, I don't exercise
like I, like I used to.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And it's much, much harder for me to control, you know, the few pounds here
and there.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  So whenever I do have to lose five or ten pounds, whatever, it's a major
effort, whereas I could use to just lay off two or three meals, uh, you know,
for a day or so, and then, you know, I could lose, you know, five pounds.  Now
I'd have to do that for two solid [laughter] weeks before I'd lose five pounds.

B.22:  [laughter] Well, my daughter really, 

A.23:  [throat_clearing] 

B.24:  uh, is into, uh, fitness, uh, course she's in, uh, the nursing profession
and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says, Mom, you, you know,
you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your body other than
maintain your wea-, your weight.

A.25:  I think it's important when they, when they talk about, you know, getting
your heart rate up, and ...

B.26:  Yes, and, and,

A.27:  and ... 

B.28:  she has a very strenuous, um, exercise mode that she keeps herself in,
plus she has, um, a family that she takes care of, and a forty hour work week.
So I'm really amazed at her stamina.  But, she, um, has inherited a little
problem from her father's side, because he did have a weight problem.  But he
maintains his weight now, because he jogs like, uh, nine miles a day.

A.29:  Nine miles a #day#.

B.30:  #Yeah#, and he gets that adrenalin high, and I guess that really, I've never
reached it.  [laughter] Um ...

A.31:  I used to run, uh, you know, quite heavy, I used to, I used to run like
three and maybe four miles three or four times a week.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  But, uh, over the years of the pounding and everything else, my knees just
don't support it any more.  So, i've, I do walk, and I do ride my bike, and we
do have a workout facility here at work.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  I do, I used to be on a fairly rigorous, uh, weight lifting program, and,
and, uh, riding th-, the stationary bike, uh, but, uh, then I started, I think
it was just from trying to lift too much --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- I started getting the shoulder problems and, uh, so I've been off now for
about four months.

B.38:  Well, I think the old adage is quite true in this case, with exercise that
moderation is the key.

A.39:  That's right.

B.40:  If you know your limits and you stay within those limits, I think that you,
and you're happy with the exercise that you do, because I think it's, um, very
imperative that you have a happy, um, attitude about exercise.  Otherwise it
becomes a chore and a task, and, and you, you think of it as work, and, um, it
doesn't really, uh, do a lot for you, but if you think of it as a, uh, a source
of, uh, well being and health and, uh, uh, have a positive attitude, I think
you, you go a long way with that.

A.41:  The one thing, I mean, I enjoy doing it.  I enjoy any kind of a, any kind
of outdoor, uh, activity, exercise --

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  -- whatever.  And, in fact, I u-, I do it during lunch, I, I really look
forward to it.  Uh, I did overdo it, and I know it, and I keep trying to tell
myself that I'm not twenty years old any more.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Huh.

A.45:  I can't, I just can't keep up.

B.46:  Yes.

A.47:  And I, and I've got to learn just, you know, when I get to a certain point,
I use it to maintain, I'm not, I'm not after, uh, you know, the twenty year
old body any more.  I'm not, uh, I'm just not geared that way.

B.48:  You're just, uh, focused then,

A.49:  Yeah, on just #staying in condition#,

B.50:  #on maintaining your health# because if,

A.51:  and, uh,

B.52:  you do the exercise naturally you're going to feel a lot healthier.

A.53:  But I had my, uh, cholesterol was down to, it was [whistling] I think
around a hundred and twenty-two.

B.54:  Oh, that's good.

A.55:  Yeah, very good.

B.56:  That's very good.

A.57:  My, my blood pressure was real good --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and, uh, my, uh, percent body fat was less than eighteen percent.

B.60:  Well, that's marvelous.

A.61:  So, I mean, overall, I was in very good shape.  Now --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- after four months of being off exercise, I've put on probably fifteen
pounds --

B.64:  Wow.

A.65:  -- and taking on, you know, taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and
everything else.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  So, I know, I've got a major event --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- uh, once I get back.  I think probably within a couple of weeks I'll be
able to get back to it again.

B.70:  Well, I think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for
that goal.

A.71:  [laughter]

B.72:  [laughter]

A.73:  I know it's got to happen.

B.74:  Oh, sure.

A.75:  Uh, I'm, I'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe, 

B.76:  [laughter]

A.77:  so I have no choice.  I can't afford a new one.  So.

B.78:  Okay.  [laughter]

A.79:  [laughter] But, uh, but it's, it's something I've done pretty much all my
life.  I, uh, I played college ball, and, and I've, I've always liked staying
in shape, and it just really bothers me when I'm not.  So, uh.  And, and plus
it's just important.

B.80:  I think it does a lot for your mental, um, exercise, too.  Uh, keeping, um,
a clear mind.  I think your mind is clearer when you exercise.

A.81:  Well, I sleep better at night.

B.82:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh#.

A.83:  #I think# clearly, you know, I'm doing something.  Uh, I just, I have real
poor self-esteem.  If I know that I haven't done something, I just feel lazy
and I feel like I've cheated myself.

B.84:  #Yeah, ((you don-,)) yeah#.

A.85:  #And I've gone# through four months of that, and I'm kind of like, 

B.86:  You,

A.87:  you know, it's time to get back on, on #things#.

B.88:  #you've# beat yourself over the head long enough.

A.89:  Yeah, I, I hate it --

B.90:  Yeah, sure.

A.91:  -- I really do, I hate it.

B.92:  Yeah, and it has an effect on your family life, too.

A.93:  That, too.  And may, like I said, my wife is one of those.  You know, she
could sit down and eat a whole chocolate cake --

B.94:  Uh-huh [laughter] [talking] and not show.

A.95:  -- and, and never, never, show an ounce of it.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  And she's got one of those fast metabolisms.  My daughter does, too,

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  and I see them eat, and then I'm, of course I'm impelled also, 

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  and, uh, that just, that, that seems to be the worst thing I have a
problem with, is I tend to like food way too much.  And, uh, back when, back
when I was working out, when I got home, I didn't tend to want to eat as much.
I was, I came home, I felt satisfied, I'd get out and work a little bit in the
yard, I'd come in, I'm hot --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- and a little bit tired.  And I'd just, and I'd just grab a salad or a
snack or something like that, and then that would be the end of it.

B.104:  Well, one of, uh, eating is one of the joys of life, you know, and, uh.

A.105:  [laughter] Huh.  It is for me.

B.106:  Yeah, well it is for a lot of people.  And, uh, you, you surely should get
satisfaction out of eating, you know, because you socialize and you're
maintaining your, your body, uh, you're, you're maintaining all of your, uh,
faculties that run the body, your brain and your flesh and your bones and all
of that, and eating is a pleasure.  That is one of the basic, uh, motivators
in life, is eating.

A.107:  Yep, that's for sure. 

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  [laughter] But, uh, I've got to get on the wagon, and I know it.

B.110:  [laughter]

A.111:  But I, like I, I mean, I have probably three people in my neighborhood who
enjoy running and walking --

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  -- and riding the bike and stuff like that.  So, I mean, there's, there's
plenty of opportunities.

B.114:  Sure, and they've got #these#,

A.115:  #I just# have to do it.

B.116:  marvelous health clubs too that, you know, you can use their facilities.

A.117:  Yeah, we, in fact we've got several of them, uh, you know, within just a
couple of miles.

B.118:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.119:  In fact, uh, you know, T I has a real good one right there in, in
Lewisville --

B.120:  Oh yes, uh-huh.

A.121:  -- not too far from where I live.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  So that, that, that's something I can use.

B.124:  Oh, certainly.

A.125:  So.  Well, I guess that's about all I can say about exercise, huh.

B.126:  Well, that's fine. I think we covered quite a bit.

A.127:  [laughter]  

B.128:  [laughter] [sneezing] {someone in background}

A.129:  Well, it was, uh, #joy#,

B.130:  #Well, it was# nice talking with you.

A.131:  Same here.

B.132:  #Take care#.  

A.133:  #Take care#.

B.134:  Bye-bye.
