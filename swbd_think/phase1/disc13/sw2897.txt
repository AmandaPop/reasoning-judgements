REMARKS:        Very bad background on Speaker A.  It appears that he
is in a room filled with people.  You could clearly hear other people
speaking in background. 

============================================================================

A.1:  [Noise]  {sounds like in a room filled with people} What do you think about
the benefits in jobs?

B.2:  Um, I'm, I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.  I think that,
um, our health insurance is terribly expensive. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.  But, um,
you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess.  What about you?

A.5:  Yeah, and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you
paying for all of it. 

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Or, or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and
what isn't. 

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  #Right the#  --

B.8:  #Yeah, I,#

A.9:  -- health insurance I have is Met Life, and, if, it's the type that if you
go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars and then, uh, the
insurance pays the rest of the bill.  Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy
thirty. 

B.10:  I see.  Now we, I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is
covered but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll
somehow the area, and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for
the area where your doctor is located based on zip code. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the
eighty-five percent they paid much lower and when I called they said, Oh well,
that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.
And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type
of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance
each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate.

A.13:  Right.  And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.  So,

B.14:  Yeah, I would assume that [laughter] you know, whatever doctors are willing
to do the paperwork and send it in.

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  But it's, it's difficult.  What about other, other benefits? Are there
others that you're dissatisfied with?

A.17:  Well, I work for Sears, and, and, um, that's about the, the only real
benefit you have, is health insurance. 

B.18:  Well, you have vacation, I mea-,

A.19:  Yeah, yeah, but everybody gets vacation.  I mean, like, uh, T I and some
other places, you know, they have so-, recreational facilities, and they have
a driving range and weight room and, you know, I think they even have a
swimming pool --

B.20:  Huh. 

A.21:  -- and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that. 

B.22:  Yeah, I'm not familiar with that sort of thing, but you know, to me
vacation [laughter] is, is an issue, and I mean, different places have
different amounts of vacation, I would assume.

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without
pay, perhaps or, um, {pause} I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.  Some
places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  Um, ours is based on number of days, and, you know, people try to build
them up in case they really do get seriously ill.

A.27:  Right. 

B.28:  Right.  But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits
around here {pause}. So maybe that covers the topic then. 

A.29:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, the work-, the working conditions, you know, if
you could include that in benefits.  Some places aren't very safe to work. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that
you have to work under.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Or maybe a ben-, uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be
the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.

A.33:  Right, uh-huh. 

B.34:  Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that
than others. 

A.35:  Yeah, I think so. 

B.36:  And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know, how, how
they enforce the rules. 

A.37:  Uh-huh {pause}.

B.38:  But other than that I don't have much feeling for, [laughter]  for the
benefits, since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them. 

A.39:  Um, work-, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um,
how much it costs the employers --

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  -- and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.  And it
reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides
that.  But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was
allowing. 

B.42:  Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation. 

A.43:  Well, well, they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of
going through the state. 

B.44:  Oh, I see. 

A.45:  So apparently it costs less that way. 

B.46:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits,
it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company [laughter]  --

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  -- and at least, you know, financially in the short run, but I would think
they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied
working for them. 

A.49:  Yeah.  That's what I, what I think the-, they should be able, they should
be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are and how much
profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have
everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.

B.50:  Right.  I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way, but I would assume
that the productivity is way down, also.

A.51:  Yeah, the productivity and the training costs, if they have to train the
same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can
save money. 

B.52:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.53:  You know, and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang
onto them.

B.54:  That's right.  No, I agree. 

A.55:  Okay, it was nice talking to you. 

B.56:  Well thank you for calling.  Bye-bye. 

A.57:  Yeah.  Bye-bye [/Noise]  {sounds like a room filled with people}.

B.58:  Bye-bye.
