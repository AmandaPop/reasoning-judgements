A.1:  Okay.

@B.2:  Okay.  We're talking about houses and if they're typical for the area.

A.3:  Is yours?

B.4:  Um, well, I don't live in a house, I live in a duplex.  Um, it's typical
for the area, I would say.  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Is it, is it brick or,

B.6:  Um, it's, it's stone and, uh, and wood, it's a combination --

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  -- which is very typical for Austin.

A.9:  Yeah, our neighborhood, everything is a little bit different.

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  I mean, you, they're, they're all custom built homes, and used in, just
about every other one is a different builder.  So every one has its own unique
design and, and characteristics.

B.12:  Well, when you talk about that, this is a really, um, I lost my house
because I divorced and couldn't make the payments.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  and long, sad, typical divorce story.

A.15:  ((Well)) I've been through one of those too [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] Well, I haven't gained myself back financially yet,

A.17:  [Throat_clearing] 

B.18: And, um, we went from a four bedroom home to this two
bedroom duplex, and, um, I found a very nice area.  Usually when you're
talking rental property and duplexes you're not in with nicer homes.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  But there are beautiful homes in the area, and they are, it's not like
tract housing at all.

A.21:  #That's good.#

B.22:  #Not a typ-,# it's a, um, I don't know if you're familiar with where
Northwest Hills is in Austin, but that's where I am.

A.23:  Northwest Hills.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  No, I'm not really familiar with the area.  I'm, I come to Austin very
seldom.

B.26:  Just to visit your sister.

A.27:  That's about it.

B.28:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.29:  So, and, and I couldn't even tell you where she lives.  I know she lives
off Congress somewhere.

B.30:  Oh, okay.

A.31:  Um, but,

B.32:  Are the homes in your area, what, what square footage are they?

A.33:  Uh, between twenty-four and thirty-one.

B.34:  Okay.

A.35:  And, uh, most of them are probably ninety percent brick, and whatever
little bit of wood trim and everything else.

B.36:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.37:  So even up to on the second, second story the brick goes all the way up.
There's not much siding.

B.38:  Well, that's, that is really nice.  

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  I like that.  And th-, the maintenance is low and it always look good.

A.41:  Yeah, we have a two story, and it's, uh, and I can't, we don't have, I
don't think we have more than, maybe just on one side there's just a little
bit of siding, but not,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  it's very little.

B.44:  What about the thing that I noticed and liked very much, and d-, hadn't
seen it often from the twin cities, in Texas it's so common to have one of
those pretty wooden front doors with the iron, uh, you know, the w-, the
pretty window in it?

A.45:  Stained glass?

B.46:  Not stained glass, but you know, I, I don't know what, #bevelled glass.#

A.47:  #Frosted,# uh.

B.48:  #Right, or frosted.#

A.49:  #Yeah, uh-huh.#

B.50:  Is that common in your area?

A.51:  Yeah, uh, in fact ours, we have stained glass in ours, 

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  and, uh, quite a few of them on our street have what they call a frosted
glass, which is kind of like a bevelled etched glass.

B.54:  Uh-huh, that's what more, more typical a-, around here.

A.55:  Yeah.  So, uh, yeah it's kind of a mixture.  And then we have some that are
just solid wood with just a, just a regular normal small window in the middle
of it.

B.56:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.57:  Uh, so --

B.58:  (( )).

A.59:  -- there's a variety there.

B.60:  It sounds like you're in a very pretty neighbor-, area.  

A.61:  It's very, very nice.  We, we're real proud, we, of course we've, uh, we've
waited a lot of years for it.

B.62:  Uh-huh [barking].

A.63:  Uh, we moved, have made several moves and, and been able to appreciate, uh,
the equity.  

B.64:  Well, that, that was my, that was my plan [laughter]. 

A.65:  [Throat_clearing] It takes a while, of course both, both of us were
divorced too, so I know what that's like,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  to have to step down a little bit and then, then kind of build your way
back up.

B.68:  Right.  Do you work for T I?

A.69:  No I don't.

B.70:  I don't either.  I, I had been working there and I left T I to see if I
could, uh, find something that would pay me a little better.  And that was in
January, and so far it hasn't proved to work out that way.

A.71:  Well maybe you can go back.

B.72:  Well, I guess I'm not one to go back.  It's maybe, maybe make another cha-,
another step or another direction.  I know the day I left, it was real funny.
One of my past bosses looked at me and said, when I told him good-bye, And I
was just talking to someone seeing whether or not I couldn't hire you back
[laughter].

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  Which made me feel very nice.  It (( )) was a pleasant way to leave.

A.75:  Well, of course.  That's the best way to do it.

B.76:  Absolutely.

A.77:  Don't burn any bridges.

B.78:  Oh, no, no, I don't believe in that.

A.79:  Well, I, you know, hope that you can, uh, get back into something that you
want.

B.80:  Well thanks so much.  What do you do?

A.81:  Uh, I'm an engineer --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- with a defense in-, industry.

B.84:  Oh, okay.

A.85:  And, uh, I can't, I can't afford to leave, and I can't afford to leave the
area [laughter].

B.86:  I underst-.

A.87:  I'm stuck with my house for a long time.

B.88:  Oh, I understand, that's where I was from.  Um, I'm terrible at staying on
the, on the subject, [laughter] so if you want me to stay on it I'll try.

A.89:  [Laughter] I see, it's tough.  

B.90:  Um.

A.91:  But, uh, you know, we, of course, we've, uh, we have a daughter that's six
and, and we would like to stay in this house until she gets out of high school
at least.

B.92:  That's why I'm struggling so d-, so much to, uh, I'm paying terrible rent
in this duplex.  I can't buy in the area, um,

A.93:  [Throat_clearing].

B.94:  but it, I'm trying to keep my daughters in the schools they were in.
And so far I'm, I'm managing it.  So that's, it, it means a lot.

A.95:  Oh, yeah, and you can also, a lot of times, you know, even not necessarily
in this neighborhood, but in neighborhoods close by here, there's a lot of
people who've left or had to, to leave it --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and they became HUDD foreclosures.

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  And people are picking those up for very little.  So maybe you could luck
into something like that and get a real nice house that way.

B.100:  Well, we're definitely checking out our options.  Uh, to get back to your
neighbo-, how many people, how many houses in your area have pools?

A.101:  Uh, I would say probably every other one.

B.102:  Oh, and do you have one?

A.103:  No, I don't want one.  I've had one before, uh, and it's just a lot of
upkeep,

B.104:  That's,

A.105:  and you spend a lot of time with them.  And then, and there is, there is,
uh, quite a bit of cost involved.

B.106:  Well, I've, I understand that, just to keep the filters running, keep it
clean, keep it warm or cool, or whatever,

A.107:  Chemicals, #water# --

B.108:  #Right,# right.

A.109:  -- it, it, and if you have it, I had mine heated so the elec-, electricity,
well not the electricity but the gas, and electricity because you do have 
both --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- was pretty high, and I just, uh, I just don't want to go through that
any more.

B.112:  You don't, you, you don't really tend to use it as much as you anticipate
you will either.

A.113:  No, you're right.  

B.114:  But, um, I have to, I have to share this, talking about houses in the area.
Just this morning I ha-, I saw a For Lease sign went up in front of one of
these beautiful duplexes in the area, and I, I had noticed it before the sign
ever went up, thinking, Oh, that's really lovely and I'd love to be there and
the location is great.  And it said four bedrooms.  And, you know, I'm living
in a two bedroom with two daughters, and it's horrible [laughter].

A.115:  I can imagine.

B.116:  And then, and then it also had the sign on it with a swimming pool.  So, me
being the eternal optimist that I am, I'm going to work saying, okay, I've got
the number, I know it's going to rent for a lot more than what I'm used to
paying, but, you know, with the pool and the extra bedroom, it was going to be
so nice.  Maybe I can do it.  So I called and found out how much it costs to
rent this place per month [laughter].  And I could not believe it.  Nineteen
hundred dollars.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I know.

B.118:  I could not believe it.

A.119:  Well, I mean, it, it, it, especially in this neighborhood, you know, of
course, you can tell there, there's about three different major jumps.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  They start, here they start at about one fifty and go up to about five
hundred.  And you can, you can see, and you may have one next to you that's
four hundred and the other one, you know, down the other street, will be, you
know, one fifty.

B.122:  Are they intermixed very well or does it seem to be streets, 

A.123:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.124:  that are?

A.125:  Well actually they're, they're pretty much just, just spaced here and
there, which makes it nice, because you get to appre-, you get to share some
of the appreciation of everybody else's property value.

B.126:  Exactly.

A.127:  And, uh, like the guy just next door to us, he's probably got the same
square footage, but he paid anoth-, he paid about a hundred thousand more than
we did.

B.128:  Wow.

A.129:  But you ought to see his pool.  He paid forty-five thousand dollars just
for his pool.

B.130:  Oh my goodness.

A.131:  And it's got little fountains, and all kinds of stuff, 

B.132:  [Sigh].

A.133:  and course, I spent all my mon-, [laughter] I spent most of the, most of
the extra money that we had I spent in, you know, we put curtains and,

B.134:  Yes.

A.135:  all this stuff in,

B.136:  Yes.

A.137:  and then we put, uh, the, the landscaping, did the landscaping so that
there's minimal, you know, upkeep in the yard --

B.138:  #Well that is# --

A.139:  -- #because I travel# a lot and I don't have time.

B.140:  -- that's great planning.

A.141:  And, uh, and I, you know, have some deck in the back, and, uh, you know, we
have like a, it's not like a, it's not really a gazebo, but it's kind of like
a little area out there where we have some table and chairs and stuff like
that.

B.142:  Oh that sounds nice.

A.143:  And there's just very little to mow, very little upkeep.  You have to pull
weeds out of the flower beds occasionally, uh, but, uh, #what I des-,#

B.144:  #Is your,#

A.145:  Sorry.

B.146:  No, go ahead.

A.147:  No I was going to say when I designed this house, I designed it myself, and
I took a lot of time to plan out everything I like, like wha-, like where my
stereo, where the T V --

B.148:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.149:  -- so I have built-in cabinets, and, uh, you know, big covered patio, big
game room, big living area, big dining room, uh, bedroom, the closets, you
can, he-, her, my wife's master closet is probably the size of a small
bedroom.

B.150:  Oh, that's, that's kind of what I left.  It's not quite as, wasn't quite as
big as that, but it was wonderful.

A.151:  And lots and lots of shelves, built in, uh, chest of drawers and stuff in
the closets.  So it, it's really, it, it, we designed it to stay here for a
while.

B.152:  Well that's great.  I hope you'll appreciate this, I was just smiling as
you said I designed it myself, and you had already shared your,
