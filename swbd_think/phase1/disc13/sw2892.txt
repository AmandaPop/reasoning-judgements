===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, about crime, um, what are your concerns?  

@B.2:  [Baby_crying] [cough] Well, my uh, uh, basic concern is that overall we
have, uh, such a overcrowding in the prisons now that, uh, judges are
actually, uh --

A.3:  Uh-huh {very faintly}.

B.4:  -- basing their decisions on what they do with criminals once they are
caught --

A.5:  Right, #I agree.#

B.6:  -- #that, uh,# probation and stuff like that is, uh, becoming more and more
pre-, prevalent.

A.7:  #I know it.#

B.8:  #And more people# are getting out eat-, earlier.

A.9:  #I agree.#

B.10:  #And so# there's less, you know, motivation for people to, you know,
deterrent, I guess --

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  -- the deterrent value has gone down.

A.13:  Yeah, I know it.  They've taken the deterrent out of crime anymore, it
seems like, and just, I don't know, I'd ne-, I don't think the punishment fits
the crime on most of these things, anyway, uh, some people just get a slap on
the wrist for murder, it seems like, and then others get, you know, a, a
horrible sentence for p-, practically nothing.  I just can't understand, you
know --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- what they're.  Of course, I know, I think dope has a lot to do with a
lot of the crimes we have and --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- dope and all that sort of stuff.  But, [throat_clearing] and I think
they've tied policemen's hands a lot too, on some, you know, some laws out
there, tied their hands, where they, you know, can't arrest them or can't
shoot or anything [laughter] like that, you know.

B.18:  Yeah I know.  It's a,

A.19:  You can't shoot a fleeing felon or something, oh, you know, just
#ridiculous.#

B.20:  #Yeah, it gets# sort of hard.  And, then, uh, they get information from
people and their attorney isn't present and they can't use it, you know --

A.21:  Yeah, yeah.

B.22:  -- because they just assumed that the guy was, you know [sniffing] --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- tortured or beaten into, uh --

A.25:  Well, uh [laughter],

B.26:  -- giving his confession.

A.27:  Absolutely, absolutely.

B.28:  No.

A.29:  And these lawyers, I get so made at them because they, or defense lawyers
any way, they just seem like they get these guys out [baby_crying] on the
flimsiest excuses, you know, and uh, I don't know, really makes me mad.  Some
of these things that they come up with that I just can, just boggles my mind,
that a judge is even.  I remember reading in the paper where a, a guy was
suing, uh, let me see, who was he suing?  The parents of this girl he had
murdered because he said if they had been stricter parents she wouldn't have
been out and he wouldn't have m-, raped and murdered her.  And so, he was
suing them, and I thought, that shouldn't have even come to court, you know.
That should have been laughed out of court.

B.30:  Yeah, that, I don't what ever happened.  But that is amazing.

A.31:  Isn't that pitiful.  I,

B.32:  [Baby_crying]  Oh, brother.

A.33:  I hear your little baby crying [laughter].

B.34:  Yeah, yeah, he's a little upset.

A.35:  Is he?  Bless his heart.

B.36:  He doesn't see me --

A.37:  Oh [laughter].

B.38:  -- so he's like, oh, where'd you go?  You disappeared.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  Down here Stephen. {Talking to the baby in the room}.

A.41:  How old is he?

B.42:  He's uh, ten months.

A.43:  Oh, ten months.  My goodness.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, he's getting to be a big boy really.

A.45:  Is that your only child?

B.46:  Uh, no, I have another one that's two.

A.47:  Oh, oh my goodness, you guys have your hands full.  Don't you?

B.48:  Well, yeah.  [noise] Both of them in diapers.

A.49:  Oh, my goodness.

B.50:  Yeah, that's a, that's a little of a -- 

A.51:  Two boys?

B.52:  -- work load.

A.53:  Yeah, I guess.  That's uh, oh my. {Very faintly}.

B.54:  Yeah.  But, uh, my wife's home during the day, so, so --

A.55:  Oh, okay that helps.

B.56:  -- she, uh, she does, has most of the fun time.

A.57:  Yeah, yeah, you get to come home and really enjoy them probably.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Okay, back to crime.  

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter] We're supposed to find out wh-, let's see, what are our concerns
or what do we think, did she say what, what d-, d-, do we can solve it, or
something, I think.

B.62:  Yeah, right.  Uh-huh.

A.63:  I'm like you, I think the judges need to, or I don't know.  Build more
prisons, I don't care if a --

B.64:  Yeah, #I think that's probably the# --

A.65:  -- #or and execute some of these guys that are on death# row, you know.

B.66:  -- that, that seems to be the guiding factor with the judges.  They say,
hey --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- we'd like to convict more of them, but, you know, we don't have a place
to put them, so what are we supposed to do?

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  And, uh,

A.71:  And if they would, you know, when they send these guys to the death
penalty, kill them --

B.72:  (( )).

A.73:  -- you know, quit wasting our taxpayers' money by having appeals, appeals,
appeals, appeals.  Just get them on and kill them and go on with it.

B.74:  Yeah, right.

A.75:  Empty, there's, there's a bunch on death row.  We'd empty a lot, bunch of
beds if we'd, uh, uh, you know, do what we're supposed to do and get on with
it.

B.76:  Yeah, right.

A.77:  #And to me that, that's a,# 

B.78:  #If you don't want# to have the death penalty, take it away, but #you know#
--

A.79:  #That's right.#

B.80:  -- make up your mind. (( )).

A.81:  And if, you know, if, uh, uh, I know Texas is one of the leading ones that,
we it's, we've probably executed probably more than, I think Texas, Florida --

B.82:  Florida, yeah, and #Louisiana.#

A.83:  -- #and Alabam-,# yeah, yeah, the southern states are, are more into that,
and [laughter],

B.84:  Yeah, I know they have it up here, but it takes, #you know.#

A.85:  #Do they just# keep appealing and appealing and appealing it?

B.86:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.87:  Yeah.  #And then they just get out for.#

B.88:  #And it's going to take a few years# for it to kick in.

A.89:  Yeah, and then they get out for good behavior, you know, and that makes,
but see, I don't care what they say, I think the death penalty is a deterrent
to some --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- t-, t-, to some extent.  And you know, about, did you watch SIXTY
MINUTES the other night about those criminals, those prisoners being given a
free education from Boston University.  Now I thought, and I thought, golly,
and this, uh one guy said, you know, if they want to give away free education,
there's a lot of poor people that'd like to have it #a degree# --

B.92:  #Yeah, right.#

A.93:  -- from B U, you know.  Why give it to these criminals who aren't going to
be able to use it anyway, #you know?#

B.94:  #Uh-huh# [barking].

A.95:  And I just, makes me sick that, they could, they're mollycoddle.  I
remember down here one time the judge ordered the, uh, I think the c-,
prisoners were complaining because they didn't have color T V, so they had to
give them color T V.  That's, you know, cruel and unusual punishment because
they --

B.96:  Right [laughter].

A.97:  -- didn't have color T V.  They had to watch black and white [laughter].
Oh, God.  Oh!

B.98:  Oh my word.  Yeah, I, I think the deterrent would, uh, really make a
difference.  That and, you know, uh, paying cops a little bit more.

A.99:  #Yeah.#

B.100:  #You know,# because the --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- police officers we have, they're either, you know, there are some that
have, that are actually going corrupt because --

A.103:  #Sure.#

B.104:  -- #they# don't get any money.  And there are some that, the best quality
people are not going into the force because --

A.105:  #That's right.#

B.106:  -- #they say,# hey, you know, there's better things I can do, you know.

A.107:  My son-in-law is a policeman out here.  And, uh, he makes, he makes
pitiful.  His wife makes more than he does, you know, and I think that's a
shame --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- that that happens.

B.110:  There's, yeah, there's some people that are dedicated and will do it
anyway.

A.111:  Yeah, #that's the way he is.#

B.112:  #And then there's some that,# you know the police department would say
well, it actually would like to turn this particular person down --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- but, [laughter] we need them, you know.

A.115:  Yeah, right, right.

B.116:  And, um, I'm sure you,

A.117:  Or they're forced into, you know, having so many minorities, and whether
they're qualified or not they hire them because they have to have that ratio,
Blacks,

B.118:  [Barking].

A.119:  and Whites and Hispanics, so they, uh, that's, that's what's happening to a
lot of them, I think, they're getting, and these guys probably aren't
good cops anyway, but they, were in the right place at the right time and the
right minority --

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  -- so they're getting on.  

B.122:  Right.

A.123:  I'm, I'm sure, I know there's some good minority policeman, but, uh,
they're not applying for the jo-, [laughter] I mean, it's the minorities but
they're not applying for the jobs especially.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  And I think quotas, and they do have quotas, I guarantee you --

B.126:  Um.

A.127:  -- they've got quotas --

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  -- they have to have so many --

B.130:  Right.

A.131:  -- and uh, like I say, whether, and that's the same with the fire
department, anything else.

B.132:  Right.

A.133:  If they're not qualified they shouldn't have it.  

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  I don't think they should lower the standards just so they can pass the
test --

B.136:  Right.

A.137:  -- or anything, and that's what they do a lot, they just --

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  -- lower the standards a little bit, and that way more people qualify and,

B.140:  Right [/barking].

A.141:  I think that's, 

B.142:  I think that that is true.  Well, I better get going, #see
what he's doing.#

A.143:  #Okay, we've had our# five minutes haven't we?

B.144:  Okay.

A.145:  Thank you.

B.146:  Thank you.

A.147:  Bye-bye.

B.148:  Bye-bye.
