REMARKS:        Children in playing in the background until halfway 
through conversation on caller B's side.  This conversation could 
be used for the topic of crime.

======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Well what do you think about gun control?

B.4:  [Children].  Well I tell you, I'm, I'm for some really strong
gun control measures, but I mean that opens a lot of questions that I don't
have any answers for [laughter].

A.5:  Yeah [breathing].

B.6:  It's like, I'd, I'd like to see a lot of controls, um, on it, and because
I would like, uh, I think, the, you know, with a goal and a purpose in mind of
seeing violence decrease in our society.  But, uh, how to get from here to
there, I'm not sure.

A.7:  I wouldn't be f-, against control if it made it virtually impossible for
even criminals to get them.

B.8:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.9:  #That's# the problem is when you, when you, you know, you take it away
from the people who don't intend to ever use them for, 

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  for violent crime other than hunting and things like that.

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  And the criminals can always continue to get the guns, regardless.  They
can get them through the black market, 

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  or, whatever.  So, I'm not sure if gun control in it's true sense, that
they're trying to implement it will ever work.  

B.16:  But I, I think what would happen though is that yes, you would have a
certain type of criminal, a certain criminal element, 

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  that would, um, b-, be able to find a way to get the guns, but I think in a
lot of domestic s-, uh, disputes and a lot of family disputes, um, I'm not sure
that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns.  You know, in other
words, a, a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence
but isn't the kind of family that's involved in criminal activities, if, if there
were gun controls and that, there just were not guns accessible to that type of
family.

A.19:  Yeah, I think, you know, if it, when it came down to these, uh, what I,
what I would consider militant type guns, assault rifles,

B.20:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

A.21:  and, you know, hand guns, because I'm, I'm not, I'm not a real advocate
of hand guns,

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  I, I mean, I do, I do own one.

B.24:  Do you?

A.25:  But I own it for protection.  #I know how to use it,#

B.26:  #Uh-huh,# #uh-huh.#

A.27:  #I know when# not to use it.  I think for the person that's inexperienced,
has no business with one, #um, yeah.#

B.28:  #Uh-huh.  I know, well# that's the thing.  I'm not really sure, [noise]
{snapping fingers} if I want to, um, learn how to use one.  I'm not sure I
could use one.  I, I've thought a lot about this, there wa-, something that
came up that made me think a lot about it,

A.29:  [Throat_clearing].

B.30:  and I, I'm not sure, uh, somebody was saying that you'd have to, [sigh]
you know, be able to pull the trigger in the end.

A.31:  #Yeah.#

B.32:  #And I guess,# I always thought if it was, threatening my personal safety
or especially like my kids, #you know.#

A.33:  #Well the reason# I say, we were, uh, we personally have experienced a major
crime, #in our family.#

B.34:  #You have!#  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  #And, uh,# you know, with my wife and daughter.

B.36:  Oh, my goodness.

A.37:  they were kidnapped.

B.38:  #You're kidding.#

A.39:  #And,# you know, and, and it's really made me look differently,

B.40:  I can imagine.

A.41:  at the way it is, you know, and I'm not saying that I, if I'd had a
gun, I could have done, you know, anything, 'cause I, I really wasn't even
there.  

B.42:  Yeah, 

A.43:  It happened while I was away.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  But, but, I think there are certain cases where it could get you in
trouble.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  You have to be able to know when it, when it can and when it can't.  

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  If it came in the middle of the night where if I could get my hands on
it and do something with it, that's one thing.  Um.

B.50:  Yeah.  But, yeah, that's, the, that is the thing, see as in the
past say five years, I've evolved #from#

A.51:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.52:  thinking, no, I'm really, am so much of a pacifist that I would have to
find another way to deal with the situation or, deal with being victimized,
you know, I couldn't use a gun.  Hold on just a minute.  {Talks to children}
[/children].  {Back to caller A} Sorry.  We have a kind of a open house and 
the #sound really travels.#

A.53:  #That's all right.#

B.54:  Um [laughter].

A.55:  Well I've kind of got pros and cons about both.  There, there, there,
there's good things and #bad things and,#

B.56:  #Uh-huh.  No,#

A.57:  there's, there's a lot of details that you, you know, it's hard to work
out all the details.

B.58:  Yeah, but I, but I, what I started to say is I've come to the point now
where I'm thinking, no, I really want to take a self defense course and I want
to take control over, um, you know, my own defense, and my own safety.  I, I,
I think I'm jus-, I need to take re-, more responsibility for that than I do
right now.  I think I just, I allow myself to think well it will never happen
to me, or it won't happen to, you know, I'm not going to have to deal with
that, 

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  #and I just, I don't think that's, it will, I'm sure.#

A.61:  #I assure you, it, it can, it can and, and the chances,#

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  you know, because we've been through a lot of the, the court battles and
all this other stuff over the years, 

B.64:  #Yeah.#

A.65:  #because# they're behind bars now but,

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  but they won't be there long.

B.68:  #Oh, boy.#

A.69:  #An, and# we, we've had to deal, you know, we've had to deal with a lot of
that,

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  and the, the frightening thing is, and, and I can,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:   I can tell you from, you know, just statistics and, 

B.74:  #Uh-huh.#

A.75:  #and from# even other people I've talked with.  Your chances is, one, is
actually one in three right now.  

B.76:  Wow.

A.77:  One out of every third person is,

B.78:  Wow.

A.79:  has, i-, I'm talking about a major crime,

B.80:  Right.

A.81:   committed against them.  Now, it's one out of every four or five for
just a, a crime.

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  Whether it be just normal robbery, or #whatever.#

B.84:  #Holy smoke,# that's wild.  I was ta-, again I was talking with somebody
just last week and, 

A.85:  [Throat_clearing].

B.86:  a-, about crime in general.  I guess it's been on the news a lot lately,
and I, must be in the back of everybody's mind, but I was saying, if people
around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher
fence, that, you know, they're going to take care of themselves and I said
there's, it's going to come to a point i-, where that, you can't get a fence
that's high enough, #and a security system that's good enough.#

A.87:  #Well actually th-, a, a higher fence is less# is more of a security risk,

B.88:  Yeah, 'cause, 

A.89:  than a normal average six foot fence.  

B.90:  #No kidding.#

A.91:  #Did you know that?#

B.92:  No, I, I don't know.

A.93:  Yeah, we thought, 'cause we had an eight foot fence.  

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  The problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an
eight foot fence --

B.96:  Oh, that they can't #do behind,# 

A.97:  -- #that they can't# do behind a normal fence. 

B.98:  That's something, #wow.#

A.99:  #Um,# in fact they say it's actually, it's, you're actually more secure if
you have no fence at all.

B.100:  Yeah, well I can see how that might #be.#  

A.101:  #But, uh,# 

B.102:  Now, I mean, you don't have to answer this or not, if you don't want to,
'cause I know it's a personal thing, but with the crime that your family was
involved in, wa-, was there, were there guns involved in that.

A.103:  Yes.

B.104:  There were, gosh #that is really.#

A.105:  #Yeah.  They,# well they didn't use them but they put, they put the guns
#to their heads.#

B.106:  #Well they# don't have to use them in that #case,# 

A.107:  #Yeah.#

B.108:  I mean, they just #have to have them.#

A.109:  #And, you know,# they, they physically were not harmed,

B.110:  They weren't, #yeah.#

A.111:  #in any way.#  They were very lucky.  

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  And, and knowing the guy and his record,

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  his normal motif is to kill them.  

B.116:  [Gasp].  Really.

A.117:  He just, he just happened not to.  He put them in the trunk of her car
and drove them out and left them.

B.118:  Wow, is he just crazy?

A.119:  Yeah, he's just basically crazy.  He's, he's been, he's been in prisons,
you know, a couple times.

B.120:  Wow.

A.121:  And, yet he's out in a #very little time.#

B.122:  #He has killed# people and he's, and he's out.

A.123:  One, he's, one #person but he's,# 

B.124:  #One person, ye-,# 

A.125:  he's used them, not maybe necessarily killed them, 

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  but that's his normal style,

B.128:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.129:  #I mean that,# that's what he would do in a, #in a confronted situation.#

B.130:  #Yeah, if he could,# yeah, #gosh.#

A.131:  #Uh, you know,# he's, he's been, it's been proven that he that he's not,
uh, society material, 

B.132:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.133:  But yet, you know, like I say, he'll be back out on the street just because of
this, this new, you know, uh ... 

B.134:  There's no prison space.

A.135:  Yeah, there's no prison space, but, you know, you, you come to the point
where you have to r-, you have to say, either they're rehabilitatable or not.

B.136:  Right, you got to do one or the other.

A.137:  Uh, you know, and those that they, that they, that, that clinically are
nuts and out of their minds or those who have committed a murder who are, who
will do it again, 'cause they've, they've said, you know, when a person's
murdered somebody out of cold blood,

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  the chances are they would do it again. 

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  Because they feel no remorse.  

B.142:  Gosh.

A.143:  They need, and I, and I, and I hate to say this 'cause I know it sounds
awfully bad, but they need to eliminate them, they need to get them out of
society.

B.144:  [Sigh].  Yeah, I because we can't, 

A.145:  We can't tolerate it anymore.

B.146:  Yeah.

A.147:  We don't, we, we, we flat don't have the space, we don't have the money.
Spend it on the ones who, who,

B.148:  #Have a chance.#

A.149:  #do have a chance# [throat_clearing].

B.150:  Did you, did you hear about that, um, prison reform that's going up in
Washington state or Oregon, or someplace up there where they're taking
criminals who are repeat offenders, and I mean really repeat offenders, 
[child_yelling] that, uh, have raped several times, or child molesters
that have molested several children over and over again and they have put them
in, I don't even think they call it a poli-, a, a prison, but that's some kind
of special, it's a separate building, in a separate location and they are just
in there indefinitely.  They don't have any time when they are going to be
released.

A.151:  I, I mean, I've, I've heard of, you know, similar programs, 

B.152:  Uh-huh, tha-,.

A.153:  but to me, I mean, if, and I, I, you know, again I hate to say this but
had they, had they really hurt my family,

B.154:  Yeah.

A.155:  or whatever, 

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  I would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead.

B.158:  #Yeah, I, I understand that.#

A.159:  #I, and I, I hate to say that# but,

B.160:  #No.#

A.161:  #I, I# mean it's, it's just yo-, they, they violate your family.  Of
course at that point you don't #have much to lose,

B.162:  #That's right, that's right.#

A.163:  #and I, and I ha-,# like I say, I really hate to say that, but I, I think
that I would be that, uh, #taken by it [throat_clearing].#

B.164:  #No, I can under-,# I, I can understand and respect that.  I have, you know,
my own three kids, and I, I've, I saw a story on T V about one time, about a
father who did take revenge on, um, someone who had hurt his children and,

A.165:  #Uh-huh.#

B.166:  #and shot# the guy and, uh, I, you know, I remembered that.

A.167:  [Throat_clearing].

B.168:  That was years ago, and I remember seeing that.

A.169:  Yeah.

B.170:  And I, I really could understand where that was coming from.

A.171:  But the victims are the ones that are, the, are made the criminals.  I
mean they're the ones that, #that end up hurting the worst.#

B.172:  #Yeah, yeah,# I, #I've heard that.#

A.173:  #And that, that's# really a shame, but as far, you know,  but as far as
gun control goes, I think that there, there definitely needs to be some
measures taken.  

B.174:  #Yeah.#

A.175:  #'Cause# not everybody's capable of own, of owning and, and #taking care of
a weapon.#  

B.176:  #And, using it, yeah.#  And terrible accidents do happen when there's kids
around.  

A.177:  Yeah.

B.178:  #But, on the other hand,#

A.179:  #You know, it's hard to say that,# 

B.180:  you can't rely, I mean, [breathing] the whole time I was growing up, up
until last five years, I always thought well the police will handle it.  You
know, they'll get it under control and #I just don't feel that way.#

A.181:  #Well there's not enough policeman.#

B.182:  I don't feel that's true anymore.  They're not going to be able to
handle it.  

A.183:  No, well there's not enough policeman,

B.184:  Uh-huh.

A.185:  or, detectives, or whatever, 

B.186:  Uh-huh.

A.187:  you know, and the people have to learn to, to help themselves some they
ha-, by being extra careful,

B.188:  Right.

A.189:  uh, by, you know, by knowing the signs of a c-, of a crime beginning to
happen or whatever.  And, and, and frankly, just reporting them.  A lot of
people, d-, they, they choose not to get involved when in fact they really
should.

B.190:  Wow, that wo-, that would be hard to understand.

A.191:  Yeah, well I mean lot of people say, well I don't want to get involved
because then, you know, 'cause then if, you know, they get off then they are
going to #come after me.#

B.192:  #Oh, [breathing],#

A.193:  Uh, you know, there's a, #there's a lot of that.#

B.194:  #yeah, but still.#

A.195:  Well see to me I, I will never stand by.  

B.196:  Yeah, you can't.

A.197:  I, I won't,
