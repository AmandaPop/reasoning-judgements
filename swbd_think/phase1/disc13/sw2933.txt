=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I work for a temporary service,

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if
you worked a regular full time job.

B.4:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.5:  We have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and
vacation pay and, they, if you,

B.6:  So, do you, you say you work for a temporary, but do you work full time
hours doing that?

A.7:  Um, I could if I wanted to, 

B.8:  Uh-huh, oka-, 

A.9:  I'd, I'm not right now, but, um I have.

B.10:  But do they, uh, determine your benefits on whether or not you do, work
those hours or,

A.11:  Yeah, yo-, like you have to work twelve hundred hours, um, within a year
to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation
pay, so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year,

B.12:  #Then they, uh, adjust it accordingly.#

A.13:  #then you don't get the benefits.#  Yeah, yeah, you don't get anything at
all [laughter].

B.14:  [Laughter] My, uh, husband works for a, a large oil company and they, uh,
and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank, so,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  we've always, uh, always had access to, to good benefits as far as
insurance and, and usually some dental, and {pause} life insurance and that
kind of thing, you know an,

A.17:  Right, yeah, my husband has good benefits too, or I probably wouldn't be
able to do the temporary work.

B.18:  Yeah, exactly.

A.19:  I think medical is probably one of the most important things to have.

B.20:  I know, uh, here sometime back, you know, they ha-, had given him a
printout, you know, of, uh, money that the company had paid into stock in his
name and how much he'd paid and, um, the medical benefits and what not that,
uh, he was entitled to, and they estimated those benefits at about forty
percent of his salary.

A.21:  Wow.

B.22:  You know, including vacation, like you said, 

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  and paid holidays, and, and, uh, all of those things.  Now some of those
you look at and you say, well, I'm not going to need that or use that benefit,
but, I guess it's there, knowing that it could be used, if you so chose.

A.25:  Yeah, those must be pretty good benefits, I've heard that usually they
average about thirty percent of your salary, so it sounds like maybe his
company's a little bit better.

B.26:  Yeah, yeah, I, uh, we've always been dealt fairly with that way.  And I
would certainly, you know, caution any young person going into, you know,
looking at jobs, to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and
how they're going to match up.  And it might be wise to take a lower salary or
hourly wage if you knew that, uh, long term, the, you were going to get more
of a profit sharing, or, you know, or just, you know,

A.27:  Right, yeah.

B.28:  whatever, you know, the differences in the, you know, in the benefits.
We belong to an H M O through my husband's work.  Is, do you, is that the kind
of medical you have?

A.29:  Uh, no fortunately we still have the, it's just regular Traveler's
insurance that my husband has, so we can go anywhere.  

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  I guess that's good, I don't know, uh, I can't decide.

B.32:  Well, we, uh, we have five children so it's been good for us,

A.33:  Oh, yeah.

B.34:  to, uh, to have the H M O for the most part.  We're in a different one
now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment, but I think it, in
the end, it will all come out in the wash.  There, uh, mental health benefits
are very, very low and anything that is elective of, in any way, could
possibly be conceived as elective is, you know, not covered, so.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  If you have those kind of services that, while the general public may
see them as elective, you don't see them as elective, 

A.37:  Really.

B.38:  then, um, you know, uh, you know, you may not get the coverage, that's
you might have.

A.39:  Yeah, my husband works [throat_clearing] for a psych hospital and I know
that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready
because their insurance won't let them stay any longer.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  It frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point
where they can really make some progress,

B.42:  That's right, that's right.

A.43:  and then they're gone.

B.44:  And I know that that is a, is a concern and if those people aren't willing
to go to outpatient, you know, therapy or something, then that benefit is,
what, what was paid is almost wasted.

A.45:  Yeah, really.

B.46:  And, uh, well I mean, I guess you can't ever totally say that, but, you
know, the best good was not gleaned from the money spent.

A.47:  Right, yeah.

B.48:  Where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference.
There should be some provision for appeal or something, I guess, (( )) need.

A.49:  Yeah, do you, uh, does your husband's company have any of the new, like
a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits.

B.50:  [Clicking] Well, yes, I guess so, you know, uh, but not, uh, not really.
You know, there, there are some options in, in every area, whether it's
medical or, uh, you know, insurance or, you know, a, a stock, you know,
savings kind of plan that's subsidized by the company,

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  and that kind of thing, so.

A.53:  Yeah, that's one thing I wish that we had was like a four oh one K plan or
one of those things were they matched what you could save,

B.54:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

A.55:  those are really good deals.

B.56:  Yeah, we have been so grateful for that over the years, because, we, uh,
uh, that, that's what our kids are going to go to college on, I guess, so.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  You know, it's good that, 

A.59:  That or retire, I don't think we can plan on Social Security taking care
of us, so.

B.60:  No, I don't think so.  I think there are going to be too many of us our age
for any way that that system can possibly even barely lessen the load.  We
just better be, those of us who can, try to do something, anything to put away
for, hopefully we won't have such a attitude in our country about elderly
people not being able to work and not being smart enough to lend a hand by the
time we get there too.

A.61:  Yeah, with what they say about how the population's changing, 

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  I think  attitudes will have to change to go along with that.

B.64:  Exactly, so it's going to, we're going to see a lot of changes in the next
while.

A.65:  And that will probably change the insurance benefits too as people get
older and still work and,

B.66:  I would think so, don't you think, yeah.

A.67:   they'll need more health care.

B.68:  I know, uh, my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last
couple of years and she's seventy-two.

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  And, uh, it's just been so difficult to get, uh, you know, to get anything.

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  But, uh.

A.73:  Does that just supplement like medic-, medicare or,

B.74:  Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, 

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  like that so, but.  You know, I would say that overall we've been very
luck and are very happy, you know, if I, if I  had to, [child_yelling] {in the
distant background} you know.

A.77:  Yeah, that's good see I, my husband's been self-employed and he's worked
for, uh, like a small companies,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of
every kind of benefit you can have.

B.80:  Yeah, yeah, I, I work for, part-time for a man who's self-employed and
gosh, you know, he and his f-, he doesn't do anything for me, you know,
because I have what I need through my husband.

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  But, uh, it sure is rough for him, it's providing for his family.

A.83:  Yeah, when we, when he was se-, self-employed and we had to get our own
insurance, to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous.  

B.84:  Oh, I now it.

A.85:  I mean you co-, you might as well have saved the money you paid every
month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something.

B.86:  Yeah, but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing
happen to, you know, 

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  you or your baby where you'd need, need somebody to jump in and take over
those payments.

A.89:  Yeah, yeah, it's scary [laughter].

B.90:  Yeah, it sure is.  Well I appreciate getting to visit with you.

A.91:  Well it was good talking to you.

B.92:  Take care.

A.93:  You too, bye.
