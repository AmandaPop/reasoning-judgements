REMARKS:  Speaker A dominates conversation.  Speakers
overlap one another throughout recording.  Speaker A
seemed to be munching on something.  Speaker A stutters,
making it more difficult than usual to transcribe what
he is saying at times. 

============================================================

A.1:  Well, I, I've been, uh, I have probably had more
time than you have to think about this #subject#,  

B.2:  #Uh-huh#.  

A.3:  so I'll tell you, is it a serious problem?  Yes,
I do --  

B.4:  #Yeah#.  

A.5:  -- #believe# it's a serious problem.  

B.6:  #Uh-huh#. {faintly}  

A.7:  #However#, there are solutions to it.  

B.8:  #Uh-huh#.  

A.9:  #And# foremost, uh, where we compare w-, that we are
now doing fifty percent of our, uh, people are voting. 
Uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some
European and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics
that, #uh,#  

B.10:  #Uh-huh.# [child_crying]  

A.11:  that have very high percentages.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  Uh, so, uh, one of the reasons, uh, that, uh, o-,
one of the reasons that we could get, uh, one of the 
reasons that it is lower in the United States is that
mostly we hold it on Tuesdays.  God knows why we hold
it on Tuesdays.  And then we #further# --

B.14:  #What# ... 

A.15:  --  complicate it by saying, you know, we will keep
the polls open until eight o'clock.

B.16:  #Right#.

A.17:  #Most# people, uh, a great number of people now work
at various, at different jobs that, if a third of the
people are shift workers, they won't be able to get to
the, to the polls in any case.  If they, uh, have to
work late into the evening and not get up. My #solution#

B.18:  #Right.#

A.19:  to that is that we hold it on Sundays.  As do probably 
sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now.

B.20:  Oh, really, they hold it on the weekends?

A.21:  They hold it on the week-, no they hold it on a, #either a# --  

B.22:  #Sunday.#  

A.23:  -- Saturday or a Sunday,  

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.25:  #or at# least a day when, when, uh, a great number
of people are not working.  

B.26:  Huh.  

A.27:  I-, in America that is not true because a, a great
number of people work on Sundays.

B.28:  #Well, uh# ...  

A.29:  #Bu-, but# that is one of my solutions. #Uh# ...   

B.30:  #I#, I know here in Dallas that they have just
instituted in the last couple of years, a, uh, a real
long period of time that you can absentee vote before
the elections.  And they, I do not think they have seen
a really high  --   

A.31:  Have you #absentee#  --

B.32:  --  #improvement#.

A.33:  --  voted #in, in#  --

B.34:  #No#.

A.35:  -- in Texas?

B.36:  #No, I always vote.#

A.37:  #Well, I have absentee voted# in, uh, New Hampshire,
and it is a fairly, fairly complicated process where you 
#have to go# --

B.38:  #Oh, really.#  [child_talking]

A.39:  --  pick up the ballot.  I do not say that it is
that complicated, but part of the process also is that
you must register, preregister at some particular point. 
New Hampshire is fairly easy but other #states# --  

B.40:  #Huh#.  

A.41:  -- you have to register every couple of years. And,
uh ...   

B.42:  To absentee vote specifically?  

A.43:  Well, to vote, to vote, to just #vote#.  

B.44:  #Oh.#  

A.45:  So registrations are perhaps a, a problem also. And
we're the mobile, mobile society, uh,  

B.46:  #Uh-huh#. 

A.47:  #People are# always mo-, you know, one out of every
seven people moves every year.  [laughter] Uh, th-, that
is almost a fourteen percent turnover every,  

B.48:  #Uh-huh.#  {faintly}  

A.49:  #you know#, if you compound that, that, uh, eh-  
eh, th-, i-, if it is difficult to register to vote,
that would remove your eligibility to vote. {sounds like
speaker is chewing something}

B.50:  But [throat_clearing] I do not think it is difficult
enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first
place,

A.51:  #Well#.

B.52:  #who#, or, who are not just motivated who really
believe that their, they, their voice is heard.  I mean,
and the #people that I have talked to# ... 

A.53:  #Well maybe that is another factor#, the motivational #factor. The
motivational factor is probably# ...

B.54:  #Right. I think that is the biggest one.#  

A.55:  #I# ...   

B.56:  #That's# the biggest problem. #I# ...   

A.57:  #Well#, that's diminished by, w-we have noticed this
in particular.  I, I'm just read two books, one of them
is WHOSE STARS AND STRIPES NOW?  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  THE, uh, TRIVIAL PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENCY IN
NINETEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT.  

B.60:  #Oh, really#?  

A.61:  #It's a fairly# decent book.  I #mean#

B.62:  #Huh#.  {faintly}  

A.63:  it's, uh, it's preceded by, uh, several other books by
these guys.  Uh, WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER was about the
eighty-four elections.  And I forget what [laughter]
the other #books were#,

B.64:  #[laughter]#

A.65:  but any case, uh, i-i-it is, uh, uh, the mar-,
uh, uh, th-, th-, there was, uh, BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS was
the one in eighty-two.  Uh, they, these guys, uh, have
taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections.  
In any case, they say that, uh, there's a definite trend, 
uh, well, you know, toward candidates using negative voting.  
It is the only way that you can use television effectively.

B.66:  I don't understand that.  Why do, uh, is that just
because they have such a low opinion of the public?  And
the public's, #uh#,

A.67:  #No#, the public --

B.68:  #gullibility#?

A.69:  -- #would rather hear# something negative about the
other guy th-, uh, than, than a positive factor.  And
y-, and, you know, to if you, if you go on the attack,
i-, and put some sensational thing before the public,
as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign, and it is not 
refuted, people will, you know, uh, believe it.  If you don't 
refute it, as he didn't, #there must be some truth#

B.70:  #Well, he did refute it.#  

A.71:  to the matter, #see#.  

B.72:  #He#, he refuted it, it just was not effective enough
to ...   

A.73:  {sounds like speaker took a bite of something
crunchy} Well, he didn't refute it til the last two
weeks of the campaign.  He didn't believe anybody would
believe that.  #And indeed his trend started upward.#

B.74:  #Well that see, I, I# didn't believe anybody would believe 
that either.  I, #I, I guess I#    

A.75:  #Well, they do.#

B.76:  have a hard time coming to terms with the, the fact that 
the American public really was, #you know, so# ... 

A.77:  #Well, don't give# too much credit to the American public
for their motivational #ability#.

B.78:  #[sigh]#

A.79:  And, and, and it ... 

B.80:  Well, then how can a democracy work then?

A.81:  #Well, it, uh, well, I don't know.#

B.82:  #How, how can it work?#

A.83:  Is it working?  I mean that's, that's the 
question.  I guess the question also is that we 
discovered, is that they don't throw rascals out.  
Everybody seems --  

B.84:  #Right#.  

A.85:  -- #disappointed#, but they don't throw the rascal
out, their own rascal.  

B.86:  Right.  

A.87:  Uh, my, my solution to, to part of this is, is to,
to make it a-a-an, an economic incentive for people to
vote.  That #sounds rather crass, I think, because# --  

B.88:   #What?  [laughter]# 

A.89:  --  then, then you are saying, well, uh, y-y-you  

B.90:  #[sigh]#  

A.91:  #know#, y-, in-, y-y, it could be c-, convoluted in 
many ways where people would actually, uh, by paying them, 
I mean, you know, you would take a certain amount off 
their income tax or property tax or whatever.  

B.92:  #Huh.#

A.93:  #But th-#, it would be very difficult to administer
because I am sure that any time money and votes are
involved, [laughter] it just, #the whole thing#

B.94:  #Well,#

A.95:  just stinks.

B.96:  how about, how about the reverse of that?  When
I have heard about England's elections, they are allowed
to run for what, a total of six or eight weeks.  Even
for the higher offices in the, in the land.  What if we
totally took money out of the camp-, eh, ma-, just
severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much
of an issue?  I feel like, #if#,

A.97: #[clink]# 

B.98: if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence 
that their vote was counting rather than their #contributions 
would count.#

A.99:  #Yeah, but the idea is to get# the individual to the 
polls, a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for 
him to get to the #polls#.  

B.100:  #I don't#, I don't care how easy it is for them, I
do not think they are going to because they do no think
that their, that anybody listens to their vote. They
think  whoever has the b-.  They really think that the
packs, you know, no matter what you're promised during a
campaign, and these days we are promised #hardly anything of 
substance.#

A.101:  #Oh, you mean the special interest groups?#  

B.102:  Right.  And, eh, and, eh, y-, no matter what a,
a, candidate promises during the campaign, i-, which
isn't very much, specif-, any, th-, they do not promise
anything specific these days.  But whatever you are
promised, they just, they just reverse themselves
depending on who pays them what once they get into
office.  #I mean, I think that's the# ...   

A.103:  #Well, read my lips#.  And, and, and no new taxes  
and #yet Bush did that. But I mean, but# --

B.104:  #Yeah. Yeah. [sigh]#

A.105:  but he's excused from that. Generally, people, I've 
read polls now where they've excused him because there 
was a, a definite necessity to balance the budget.

B.106:  Well, then why did he say that during his campaign?

A.107:  #Oh, he, he he gave it, he did#

B.108:  #Then he, it was totally irr- ...#   

A.109:  he did, he promised the best he could. And he is 
the president and he should, he should address those 
problems and if there needs to be a change in a period 
of time.  Wh-, what  was so funny about it is that, I 
guess, that it happened so rapidly, you know. He knew it.  
#He actually knew it. And being#

B.110:  #Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.#

A.111:  associated with government, he should be held up to 
the light for that. And #maybe# 

B.112:  #Yeah.#

A.113:  he will.  

B.114:  Yeah.  Well ...   [sigh]

A.115:  But I think it is, er-r-r, I mean,

B.116:  #[sigh]#

A.117:  #I think you#, you still have a view that the
American voter is different from other voters.  And he
is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of
liberty and all that.  I think voters are #motivated, 
uh ...#

B.118:  #What about, what about# voters in the other countries that you
were talking about?  Like in the European countries
where they have higher turnouts?   And, well, the newer
democracies because #it's going to be totally different, but# --

A.119:  #Well, I don't know if they have higher# turnouts -- 

B.120:  #You do not think so#?  

A.121:  #overall. I don't# think England  has, I think 
England has about a seventy percent, sixty-five percent turn out.  

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  I think that we just discovered in this, in, in the
Indian elections is th-, one of #the greatest# --  

B.124:  #Oh#.  

A.125:  --  greatest and massive things in, in the world.
Uh, just, it was, got vi-, more #violent every year.#

B.126:  #Right.#  

A.127:  They went down almost fifty percent in this election 
#before they blew up#

B.128:  #Oh, really?#  

A.129:  Ghandi.  But,  

B.130:  #[sigh]#   

A.131:  #simply because people were so#

B.132:  #Yeah#.

A.133:  #concerned# about their inability that to, that
their vote does not count any way.

B.134:  #Huh.#

A.135:  #And the# corruption of politics in, in, in that
s-s-situation there.  But th-, but, you know, everything
is relative to when, uh, eh, w-w-, you know, we had
higher turnouts because at that time we cur-, talk about
the turnout relative to the eligible voter, right?

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  I mean is, but, but before these enormous, before
this Voting Rights Act, what we had was a, a great deal
of our population, uh, mainly the blacks in the south
and #the#

B.138:  #Uh-huh#.

A.139:  Hispanics were precluded by, 

B.140:  #Oh#.  

A.141:  #by, uh#, voting laws, uh, from reg-, from their
eligibility to register.  Now everybody is available.

B.142:  #Oh#.  

A.143:  #So, if you really# computed it, they probably when
we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen
fifty, we really only had a fifty percent #turnout
because all the eligible# --  

B.144:  #Oh, I see, because, right.#

A.145:  -- voters  --  

B.146:  Weren't qual-,  

A.147:  -- #you know, the-, it was skewed#  --   

B.148:  #dis-, were disqualified#.

A.149:  -- by the eligible voters being less than
the total population #of ...#

B.150:  #But isn't that#, isn't that kind of a blanket racist
kind of thing to say the blacks and Hispanics and other
minorities just don't vote?  Or is that just #the,
the truth?#

A.151:  #No, I think the high-, there's a higher# percentage 
in, in certain black areas of voters.  I don't know about
Hispanics, you know. #I just,#

B.152:  #Yeah#.

A.153:  I, I mean I haven't studied the statistics
well enough to, I mean, I think in this 
sort of --  

B.154:  Well ...   

A.155:  -- conversation we can only do our own reaction. 

B.156:  Right, right.  But you know that just made me think
of something that happened down here in Dallas last
year.  They have this huge fight going over
redistricting here.  

A.157:  Uh-huh.  

B.158:  And at one point they di-, they took another vote
on it, and they, uh, the minorities could not get enough
of a vote out to, to pass their plan.  And this is
something that had been going on for months. It was on
the news every night.  They, and they have had lawsuits
over it.  I mean, it was r-, it was a major issue, and
there still wasn't enough minority vote to get, to pass
the plan that they were backing. So that's, y-, you
know, I think that you  have really hit on something
there.  Wa-, to say that, uh, those ...   

A.159:  What do you mean?   

B.160:  Well, with the minorities and we are saying we have
lower voter turnout.  Maybe it is, is, uh, now that we
have #minorities included in the# ... 

@@A.161:  #You know, Karen, I wonder if# we are recording.

B.162:  Why, did you not press one?

A.163:  I did press one, but usually by this time they tell
me that the time is up.
