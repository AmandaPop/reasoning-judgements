B.1:  Well where, what, what's good in Washington D C to eat?

A.2:  Well I think we're very fortunate because, uh, in the past twenty years
Washington has really developed a, a good number of quality restaurants, uh.
Mostly, although you have your normal continental, we've gotten the ex-,
excellent ethnic restaurants, um, we have Ethiopian restaurants, we have Latin
American restaurants, um, you know, besides the normal range of French and
Italian and things like that.  So, uh, we try to, e-, because I am Italian
background and my husband is Chinese, we really try to, uh, experience quite a
bit of difference in cooking styles.

B.3:  Well you have a lot to thank your husband for, noodles.

A.4:  Oh, God, yeah [laughter].  But, 

B.5:  [Laughter] I live in a great pl-, I live in Berkeley, California in what
they call the gourmet ghetto.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  It's, uh, it's, it's, it's got every, well it's, it's a very, uh, polyglot
community, you know.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  Got every, every kind of ethnic background you can think of, but just up
the street is one of, one of, one of only two five star restaurants on the
east coast --

A.10:  Oh, my.

B.11:  -- less than a block.  

A.12:  Well what, 

B.13:  I mean on the West Coast.   I think there's only like four in the U S, but.

A.14:  Uh-huh, is it continental?

B.15:  Uh, well no, it's French, actually. 

A.16:  It is French, uh-huh.

B.17:  It she, uh, {voice says Chez Penny} Yeah, yeah, the, the name of it is Chez
Penny, you may have heard of it but,

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  They, uh, they, they, [laughter] they specialize in flower salads actually.

A.20:  [Laughter] And I'm sure it's quite,

B.21:  And, they got, you know, e-,

A.22:  I'm sure it's quite pricey.

B.23:  Well actually it's like thirty-five dollars for the meal.

A.24:  Oh.

B.25:  And that's, you know, and each night is a different, tha-, tha-, there's
never the same meal twice.

A.26:  So it's a price fixed and you go in for the menu that they have.

B.27:  Yeah, and you go in, you know, and of course it's booked for months on
end.

A.28:  Yeah, yeah.

B.29:  But they also have a, um, a, uh, I understand a buffet or something that,
you know, people can just walk in.

A.30:  Oh, that's interesting, uh-huh.

B.31:  You know, combination, this is like during the day.

A.32:  What kind of food do you like?

B.33:  Oh, good.

A.34:  [Laughter] Any speci-, any specific place?

B.35:  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm one of those people that, as long as it's good, it
really doesn't matter. 

A.36:  And, and you're adventuresome?

B.37:  Oh, extremely, yeah,

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  I was one of those kids that would go into a menu, go into a restaurant
when I was a kid and, and, and would not order unless I had never had it
before [laughter].

A.40:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well we're very fortunate, we have, we have two sons and
ever since they were e-, even very little they we very adventuresome.  I mean
they tried frogs legs an, and they tried rabbit and all sorts of things, so,
uh, we've never had to have the problem of picky eaters and,

B.41:  Well, it's, oh, I was a, I was a picky eater when I was real young but,

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  then I got to the point where I discovered that, you know, [laughter]
there was something other than,

A.44:  [Laughter].

B.45:  than Twinkies in the world.

A.46:  Oh, well they, they've been, they've been adventuresome since they were, I
mean even preschoolers, they'll, they tried anything.

B.47:  Oh, that's great.

A.48:  Yeah, so, um, it's been f-, it's been great and, uh, of course, in the
area of Maryland where we are, of course, crabs are one of our big delicacies.

B.49:  Oh, I know, I know, 

A.50:  And, 

B.51:  I, I used to live back in North Carolina and I remember going to up to,
to Richmond, James River, and we'd get,

A.52:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.53:  (( )) and, and flounder, you don't, we don't get flounder out here on
the West Coast.

A.54:  Oh, I know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful.
I know that you have abalone out there.

B.55:  Yeah i-, that's true, that's true.

A.56:  And fresh, i-, there's nothing to re-, I mean fresh abalone is wonderful.

B.57:  Yeah, it really is, a lot of work, but it's, it's good, really is.

A.58:  Yes, yes, but, uh, you know, Baltimore also is a wonderful eating city.  
I'm b-, 

B.59:  Uh, yeah, Baltimore, Baltimore, I saw a movie about Baltimore recently,
((ABALON)) that's right.

A.60:  O-, okay.  And Baltimore's got some great dining areas, it's got little
ethnic communities, little pockets of ethnicity, in the city,

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  and it's absolutely marvelous.  The p-, it's sort of one of these
underrated cities and they're some great restaurants there.  Um, it, there are
mostly, um, besides the little ethnic things you've got your great seafood
places, and there's one great German restaurant there called Hausners.  The
owners of which, um, traveled all over the world and this place is room after
room of art, so that you feel you're in a museum, except it's completely over
done.  And it's, it's a real place to bring people for something to talk about
and it's a very German restaurant.  They've got the whole gamut of German
dishes.

B.63:  Huh.

A.64:  So, uh, when we go out I guess we look, as you said, you like to try when
you were young, something different.  We try to go out for either two things,
something to make it a festive occasion, and to try something very unusual,
or else we go back to a few of our, uh, for Chinese restaurants, we usually
follow the chef.  If we know the chef's in a restaurant and what their
specialties are so there are certain Chinese restaurants, this is something I
learned from my husband, where you only eat certain things.

B.65:  Sure.

A.66:  And, uh, other things that they don't produce in, you know, in quality,
but other as-, other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things, so, uh,
we, we do tend to eat out at least once a week, sometimes more, although with
two sons in college, now, that may be, it may be a little less.  

B.67:  Yes, well, t-, uh, uh, of, of course without two, two sons it's, it's also
easier to go out isn't it, I mean.

A.68:  Yes.

B.69:  Really, you know, I mean.

A.70:  [Laughter] It certainly is. 

B.71:  [Laughter].

A.72:  So, uh, what's, what's your major consideration when you go out to dinner?

B.73:  Well, uh, basically it, it's, it's, it's, it's good food and, and,

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  uh, [beep] price comes into it some, you know,

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  not, not, 

A.78:  Which would, so it's fun to find good food for a reasonable price, too.

B.79:  Yeah, we-, that's what's really great about where I live here.

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  It's in, in an area that's within, you know, four or five blocks.  There
must be forty restaurants.  I'm not kidding.

A.82:  Oh, that's, 

B.83:  It's just --

A.84:  Oh, well how tempting.

B.85:  -- it's in, you know, it's just, just down from the, from, um, University
of California Berkeley.

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  And, uh, and it's, [laughter] and tha-, that's what's good about it is that
th-, the, the, the prices are extremely reasonable,

A.88:  Yeah.

B.89:  and the competition is so keen, 

A.90:  Yeah.

B.91:  that the food really is good, so you know, you,              
 
A.92:  We have to, we have to drive (( )) any restaurant where we're not in
walking area of any, even a store so we do have to drive but, w-, you know,
within a, um, fifteen, twenty minute drive we have a whole span of, of
restaurants that we can chose from and unless you go into downtown Washington
and the elegant areas, uh, even the, some of the areas in Washi-, you can get
very reasonable and very tasty meals.  And, uh,

B.93:  One more time, what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore, the
German.

A.94:  Hausners.

B.95:  Hausners, I'll --

A.96:  Hausners, H A U S N E R S, {spells out the word} uh-huh.

B.97:  -- have to remember that,  

A.98:  #Yeah, if you ever get out there,#

@@B.99:  #Well Linda, it's been a pleasure talking to you.#

A.100:  Well I enjoyed talking with you, too.

B.101:  All right, you have a good one.

A.102:  All right, bye-bye.
