====================================================================

A.1:  Have you had any thoughts on this?

B.2:  Well, not really.  Uh, I, uh, am of an age where I could have very well
served in the military --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- during the Vietnam era,

A.5:  How old are you,

B.6:  #and I did not.#

A.7:  #if I can ask? [laughter].#

B.8:  Huh, do what?  [laughter].

A.9:  How old are you?

B.10:  I'm, will be forty-nine in August.

A.11:  Okay, so we're about the same age.

B.12:  Right.  Uh, during that time I was in college --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and, uh, and also had some minor health problems that did keep me
out of, out of the military, or help to keep me out, anyway.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  But, uh, I'm not opposed to military service at all.  Uh,

A.17:  Yeah, I think this is also a, a broader scope.  I think --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- uh, they're talking about, uh, just service in general, and, um, I, I
did a lot of this sort of thing in, in college in the summers.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Um, I worked, uh, in, uh, Mexico doing community service, uh, for two
summers while I was in college.  And, you know, it was an incredibly
worthwhile experience.  So, in theory, I'm in favor of this.  But on the other
hand, I'm an economist [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  And, uh, just like, uh, well, the military has a tremendous, uh, you know,
responsibility for security and everything, but there's also an equally
tremendous budget.  So I guess on the other hand, as, as, as, as good as this
idea is, it's got to be paid for, uh, even though it's, uh, you know, it,
it's, it's never quite voluntary.  People have to be paid if they're asked to
serve for a year in any capacity.  So, uh, you know, uh, uh, the idea is
great, where does the money come from?

B.24:  Right.  I guess uh, uh, I have had some thoughts in the past that, uh,
this, this service should not be, uh, performed for, for areas that we don't
need the service, you know.  Uh, it's, if it's, uh, if it's voluntary service
but --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- it's being furnished by the government, it should be to take the place
of things that the government's doing already.

A.27:  It should, it should or shouldn't?

B.28:  Should.

A.29:  It should.

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  So, uh, you know, the voluntary service in the medical, you know.

A.33:  But I don't think it was voluntary.  I think it was just a year of required
service.  There was nothing about voluntary.

B.34:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, then, then I guess that's, you know [laughter],

A.35:  That's why as an economist my, my, my ears perked up.

B.36:  [Sneezing] Uh, at any rate, I guess my idea is that, that if we're going
to replace, if we're going to, to institute this national service policy --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- that that service policy should replace some other area --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- where we're spending money.  Uh, you know.

A.41:  And doing it at a less expensive rate then.

B.42:  Uh, yeah, uh, eliminate some bureaucrats --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- [Laughter] and let the, let these nat-, this national service take care
of their job.

A.45:  Of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running
it.

B.46:  Right, and uh,

A.47:  I mean, let's face it, the military is probably [laughter] one of the most
bureaucratic agencies.

B.48:  Right, yeah.

A.49:  So I, I, I, you know, on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was, Oh,
it's wonderful.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  You know, I think people do owe their country something, whether it, they
serve in the military, of for those who for one reason or another can't, want
to serve in another area and have talents in another area --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- great.  But then, who pays.  

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And if they have to and they don't go into the lab-, the other labor force
you're losing money in terms of taxing --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- from other jobs I mean.  So there's, it's not, it's not a real cut and
dry --

B.58:  Yeah, I agree.

A.59:  -- thing.

B.60:  Uh, and, and, and it would, uh, would be nice if we could get some, uh,
some multiple use out of this, you know.  Maybe, uh --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- have the, the military, which is, you know, i-, is a, a, a real drain
financially --

A.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.64:  -- on the country, have the people that are in the military serve some
other function --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- you know, in-, instead of just military, uh,

A.67:  And just marching around waiting for a war [laughter].

B.68:  Right.  Uh,

A.69:  Yeah, uh, we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with, uh,
which was v-, although volunteer there was a minimum payment, uh, like Vista,
which was a domestic Peace Corps some --

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  -- time back.  And probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some
of that.

B.72:  Yeah, I have seen, uh, you know, I'm not really that, you know, that
familiar with it.  I am aware that, that, that Vista and, uh,

A.73:  Yeah, and I know the ar-, what the army has a corps of engineers --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- which, uh, could probably be one of those areas that, uh, could be, uh,
privatized or civilianized, or whatever, some of the areas there, you know,
for domestic use.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  I've always wondered why the army corps, uh, of engineers took care of
floods, you know, in --

B.78:  Right.  It's,

A.79:  -- in certain areas, why was,

B.80:  Well, I guess, uh, in, in looking at that, one reason that the army corps
of engineers is that the military schools --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- do have probably among the top engineering schools --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- in the country.  Uh,

A.85:  But of course there are many private engineering schools that are
absolutely superb.

B.86:  But, uh, but if the government's going to, uh, to provide the service --

A.87:  Yeah, ((the main)) ((that made)),

B.88:  -- then government, you know, government trained people --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- are, are logical to do that.  Uh,

A.91:  Yeah, and of course back during the depression when the government started
doing things like, uh, C C C, the Civilian Conservation Corps,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  so I, uh, you know, there's a bit of a history of people serving the
government, and it doesn't have to be as the military, you know, if you go in
just as a, an enlistee, uh, the wage isn't anything great.

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  So, if, if you're asking for a year of service, it doesn't have to be a
wage comparable to the, uh, if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a
wage comparable to the private sector.

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  So, it could be, you know, a wage enough to, for have someone to live on to
eat and, if, uh, if in fact,

B.98:  Well, and it,

A.99:  So I guess, that it, a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were
implemented [laughter].

B.100:  [Laughter] Right it, yeah, uh, I guess, uh, basically, I'm, you know, I'm
in favor of, uh, of the idea --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- but I think that, uh, like you said, a lot of thought needs to go into
it.  Just, uh, the financing and, and the, the, uh,

A.103:  How it's administered and how --

B.104:  Yeah, but, uh,

A.105:  -- you know, uh, just the, who, uh, who, who would be exempted, because I'm
sure there would be exemptions to it.  Uh,

B.106:  But, uh, you know, medical service and, uh, aid,

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  you know, or, or assistance for families and, uh, oh, even, uh, even, uh,
running the uh, the prison system might be a, you know, a, a,

A.109:  Uh-huh, or even, or even,

B.110:  an area that could run, could t-, be taken care of.

A.111:  doing paperwork for a police system.  You know.

B.112:  Right.  Uh, there's any number of things that the government's involved 
in --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- that, uh --

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  -- that this service, 

A.117:  Homeless,

B.118:  could take care of.

A.119:  homeless and all.  I think they're going to cut us off.

B.120:  Well, I think that's my call waiting line ringing.  

A.121:  Oh, oh.

B.122:  Whoever that is will probably call back.

A.123:  Yeah, but I think, you know, in terms of the, the, the cri-, pressing
problems in the United States today, that in terms of the homeless, in terms
of the state of the, the state of the prisons --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- um, there are probably a lot of things that could be done, uh,

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  on a volunteer basis.  

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  So maybe they should do pilot projects --

B.130:  Right, and, uh,

A.131:  to try it out and see how it works.

B.132:  Just to see what, uh, what all could be done.  Yeah.

A.133:  Yeah, well, listen, it was good talking with you.

B.134:  Nice talking to you too.

A.135:  Okay, bye-bye.
