@A.1:  How has your weather been recently?

B.2:  Well, the last two weeks we have had records [laughter].

A.3:  Record what?

B.4:  Yes, uh, we've be-, we've had between ninety and ninety-five degree weather
with about eighty-six to eighty-eight percent humidity.

A.5:  Oh, wow.  That's something.  

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  We've had a really wonderful Spring.  It's been rainy, it's been
comfortable, it's been cool, and we've only had a couple of really severe
weather storms --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- which is unusual for northeast Texas.  Generally we have some, you know,
there's, there's always at least one or two good hail storms [laughter],

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  before the season ends.

B.12:  Yeah, I know what you mean by good hail storms [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah, last Thursday, though, it was just raining buckets, and it was
probably in the low eighties.

B.14:  Um.

A.15:  It was really a nice late Spring day.  Very comfortable, just really was
nice.  Had plenty of rain, and within three days time all of that moisture is
gone, the sun has come out, and it is hot [laughter].

B.16:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.17:  I mean big time hot.  The air conditioners in the buildings are saying, oh,
no, not again.

B.18:  Oh, yes I know.  Unfortunately my air conditioner broke down, uh, two days
ago, so, uh, things have been like a sauna [laughter].  Uh,

A.19:  Uh-huh, I can imagine.  Well, typically, though, what does your weather
run?  When does your Spring actually start?

B.20:  Well, Spri-, Spring usually starts, uh, in May --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and we usually have seventy degree weather to, seventy to eighty degree
weather in May and in June --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and then, uh, toward the end of June it starts getting hot --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and, uh, hot meaning, you know, ninety and above.  

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  I consider ninety and above hot [laughter].

A.29:  Uh-huh, yeah  [laughter].

B.30:  Uh, and we usually have about the same humidity.  But unfortunately, uh, we
had a very early Summer, and I'm hoping that we'll again maybe get some cool
weather.

A.31:  Oh, wow.

B.32:  But, uh, I don't know.  Uh, it doesn't look very encouraging,

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  because they're calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot.

A.35:  Right, oh, boy.

B.36:  So.

A.37:  I know it's been about eight years ago, I guess now, right here in Dallas.
I guess it was late May, temperatures got up into the nineties, and by early
June it was rocking a hundred --

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  -- and it stayed that way until September.  We had ninety-one consecutive
hundred degree days.

B.40:  Oh, my gracious.  Wow [laughter].

A.41:  And I didn't know whether we would survive at all.  Oh, but,

B.42:  Oh, I guess not, that's, you don't have much humidity though, do you.

A.43:  Well, actually, you know, we affect our humidity a great deal.  This at one
time wasn't a real humid area.  But, we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of
reservoirs, and that increases the relative humidity.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  I mean, if it's there to evaporate, it's going to go up into the air, and
the hotter it gets, the more evaporates.

B.46:  Um, probably put in more trees and things too, uh, might, uh, uh, it seems
like the area there, more tree seemed to, uh, uh, hold the humidity in, uh,
even more.

A.47:  Well, we have attempted to reforest some areas,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  but as a matter of fact at one time, this was, uh, a very dense forest
in this area, and for farming and for construction and things, a lot of the
forests have been cut down, and then of course, you know, they bulldozed a
bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir (( )) moisture [laughter].

B.50:  Yes, [laughter] I know.

A.51:  [Cough] But for the most part we have very mild Winters here.  We may get
one snow storm.  I may actually see white on the ground one day, but if even
ices over, a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow, man,
businesses close down, traffic comes to a snarl, I mean, nothing happens if it
gets enough snow you can see it on the ground.

B.52:  Well, don't feel bad, it does here too, and we get snow all the time
[Laughter].

A.53:  Um, God.

B.54:  Uh, they don't get that awfully much but they get enough --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- unfortunately that, uh, uh, if, if they aren't used to it --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- it's not like --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- having snow two, you know, uh, three to five inches all the time --

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  -- or quite often --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that --

A.65:  Oh, yeah.

B.66:  -- but here, uh, the schools close when there's half an inch of snow
[laughter] --

A.67:  That's true, they sure do.

B.68:  -- and, uh, everything else closes down, so, uh,

A.69:  You know, one of the things I have noticed is that the weather changes over
time as well.  I was raised in Amarillo --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and I can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in
Amarillo.  It started in October and stopped in March, or April [noise].
{breathing sound} And it, you know, there stayed snow on the ground all Winter
long --

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  -- to, to some depth.  But actually, that has changed considerably, uh, the
Winters are no less cold, but they're dryer.

B.74:  Right.  Right, yes, it's been the same way here.  Uh, we haven't had nearly
as severe, uh, a Winter in the last five years even --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- than we had, uh, I've been in Maryland for twenty years, so --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- uh, um, I'd say when I first came here, you know, it was quite common to
have several snows --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and, uh, you know, they, they build in, uh --

A.81:  Uh-huh

B.82:  -- ten snow days for our kids back here --

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  -- in the school, and, uh, the last three years they haven't taken but one
day.

A.85:  Oh, wow, that's something.

B.86:  So, uh, it has,

A.87:  Well, I don't think there was a single day out this year for our kids.
They, I don't, they don't put ten in there, I think they put three.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  But, good grief, here, three days for snow days.  Actually one, year before
last, they took a snow day [laughter] because it was flooding [laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter] Okay.

A.91:  It was a Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school, so they just
canceled school.

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  There's just too many.  We're in a very, uh, they're low hills.  You don't
notice them because of the trees and because of the, so many buildings built
around, but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of
gullies, which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding.

B.94:  Right, right.

A.95:  And, uh, that can create almost as a big hazard.  And I drive a little
Nissan.  When it floods it drowns [laughter].
 
B.96:  Yes, right [laughter].  You wouldn't go through too many puddles.  Do you
have much, uh, many problems with, um, lightning, uh, with electric storms,
there?

A.97:  Well, yes, uh, any time there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it.

B.98:  Oh, really --

A.99:  Yeah, one of the,

B.100:  -- okay, because that, that's one thing that we have here.  See, I'm
originally from California --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- so the contrast between the lightning storms I experienced there and the
lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard [laughter] you 
know --

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  -- uh, uh, have been, uh, quite an experience.

A.105:  Right.

B.106:  But, um, uh, we seem to have a lot, this time of year we seem to have a lot
of, uh, where it's still, I mean, last night it went down to sixty degrees,
but it's ninety, let's, it's eighty-two right now, here.  So,

A.107:  Oh, goodness, it really does climb fast, didn't it.

B.108:  Yeah, yes.  So it, the contrast in the Spring is so, uh, you know,
different, I guess that it breeds, some, uh,

A.109:  Well, I am a little bit concerned.  This last week our temperatures did not
drop down below the upper seventies at night, which means, that --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- you know, we could be looking for a very warm Summer.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  I really don't want that [laughter].

B.114:  No I don't either, I know what you mean, because electric bills go up 
and --

A.115:  Oh, 

B.116:  -- in fact, uh, I was at my daughter's on Sunday, and they had their first
brown out.  Uh, it just, electricity just went off, for about twenty minutes,
and then came back on --

A.117:  Um.  

B.118:  -- but it went off in the whole neighborhood.  So, uh --

A.119:  Oh, my goodness.

B.120:  -- uh, this isn't, uh, this is still May.  It's not a real good time of
year to start [laughter] --

A.121:  That's right.

B.122:  -- you know, because, uh, uh, it kind of looks for the, but the Summers
have been longer, and, um, hotter.

A.123:  I agree.

B.124:  I think that a lot of it has to do with,
