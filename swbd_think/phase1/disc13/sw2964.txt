===========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about gun control?

B.2:  Well, uh, I am probably, uh, closer to being a, what is it?  The ten is on
the end of, uh, no gun control?  [laughter].

@A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  I guess I am probably closer to a ten than a one.  I be-, I am, uh, I am
not opposed at all to having a waiting period for, you know, for the purchase
of guns.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Uh, I think that is appropriate, uh, a background check on people that, uh,
[sneezing] excuse me, espec-, especially people that buy handguns.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Uh, but, eh, eh, I believe that, uh, you know, the Constitution gives, uh,
the individual the right to own firearms, for, you know, for their, whatever
their own purposes are.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  As long as they are legal purposes.  And, uh, I am opposed to anything that
would limit what the Constitution allows.

A.11:  Yeah.  And I, I think, I think that is right.  Uh, the only thing I object
to is like, uh, machine guns and, uh,

B.12:  Yeah.  I, I, I, uh, I, agree with that,  

A.13:  Yeah (faintly).  

B.14:  uh, although I can, I can see where there might be, even be a, a
potential, uh, sometime, you know, a need sometime in the future for the
individuals to have, uh, even machine guns available. Uh, you know, if, if we
were ever invaded, of course, now that is pretty far fetched.  But if the
United States were ever invaded, I think that the man on the street is going
have to be the one to defend the country at some point.  Or, or might have to
at some point.

A.15:  Uh-huh (faintly).  

B.16:  And, uh, I think that there should be, uh, sufficient, uh, guns and, you
know, and ammunition and things available for that.

A.17:  Do you think, uh, like Reagan, of course before that, you know, he was in
westerns all th-, all that time, and, and, uh, he was real gung ho.  And then,
[throat_clearing] then just now, just this last year, it seems like he's, he
was, uh, and he was not, that bill does not restrict anything outside of just
having to wait seven days.  But --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- it is interesting that he turned around for some reason.

B.20:  Yeah.  Well, I,

A.21:  Because it,

B.22:  I always wondered, you know, why he was so adamant about, you know, about
being opposed to that waiting period.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Uh, you know, even before, I mean, you know, I, I did not see that the
waiting period was a, you know, it was a major restriction.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  [Cough].

A.27:  I think,  

B.28:  Excuse me.  

A.29:  and I think a lot of times, you know, that, uh, criminals do not go out
and buy a, uh, what, uh, uh, a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred
dollars,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  you know, a handgun.  They go out and buy the cheapest thing they can,

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  and then, then they go rob a liquor store or something.

B.34:  Yeah.  And, uh, plus, you know, I, I, I guess my opinion is that if, uh, if
a, uh, criminal or somebody with criminal intent, real criminal intent, wants
a gun, they are going to get one.

A.35:  Yeah.  That is true.    

B.36:  Uh, the drug dealer is not going to, you know, he's not going to wait the
seven days for a gun anyway.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  So it is, it is only the, actually it is only the, [laughter] the, uh, the
people that are trying to be, uh, law abiding people are the ones that are
going to wind up being able to get the guns legally.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Uh, you know, af-, even with the waiting period.  And I, you know, I cannot
see that, uh, that there is anybody that, that does not have criminal intent
that would have, uh, any reason to object to that waiting period.  That is,

A.41:  Uh-huh.  That is right.  And a lot of times like, uh, what is his name?  I
cannot remember his name right.  The guy in the Austin tower, uh, Whitman?

B.42:  Yeah.  Whitman.

A.43:  You know, he was sane, and, and I guess they could have said like Lee
Harvey Os-, Oswald was sane when he bought his gun, you know.  But he bought
his by mail anyway.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  But later on, you know, something can happen. They can, they can have a
brain tumor or they can break down one way or another.

B.46:  Right.  Well, uh, you know, Hinckley  --  

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  -- was the one that took the shot at Reagan.

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  And, uh, he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas, I think, or
somewhere in the Dallas area.

A.51:  Uh-huh {faintly}.  

B.52:  And, you know, if, if he had had to have a waiting period, he did not stay
in Dallas long enough, uh, at that time to have waited the seven days.

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  So if, if there had been a waiting period, he would not have had the gun.
Uh, or a least he would not have had that gun.  He might have had another one.

A.55:  Yeah.  He might have.

B.56:  But, uh, you know, so I, you know, I can see that there are, are reasons
for having a waiting period.  That, that, uh, I think that anybody that, you
know, anybody that does not have a, a criminal background or, you know, any,
any real reason to not allow them to have one.  I think that anybody that
wants one should be able to buy one.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  That is interesting because I do not own one [laughter] though.  I do not
own a gun.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  But that is, you know, that is my personal opinion --

A.61:  Yeah,  

B.62:  -- anyway.  

A.63:  I do not either.  Yeah.  That is true.  Because, you know, once, once
they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group, then the,
uh, [cough] it gives them a foothold to, to be against somebody else, you
know.

B.64:  Right.  

A.65:  And, uh, and the hunters, you know, the hunters, uh, with what gun species
there are left, well, especially I mean, using a rifle, white tail deers
mostly.

B.66:  Right.  

A.67:  You know, that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle.  Uh, you
know, they have every right to have a rifle and be able to, to hunt.

B.68:  Right.  You know they, rifles and shotguns for, you know, for, like you
say, for deer hunting and for bird hunting are, you know, that is kind of the
American way, so to speak.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  And that, uh, I think it was a rifle that that kid shot that
burglar with in Arlington, or wherever it was?

B.70:  Uh.

A.71:  It is, I think --

B.72:  Yeah, I believe it was.

A.73:  -- it was,

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  uh, two years ago or so now, 

B.76:  Uh,

A.77:  you know.

B.78:  there was a, a, uh, deal on television just, uh, I saw it, uh, yesterday
or the day before, where there was an, an Oriental shopkeeper in California, I
think it was in San Bernardino,

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  California.  That there were five young guys, they were gang members that
came in to rob his store.  And they all had guns.  And he had a gun somewhere
under the counter that he got.  And he shot all five of those.  Killed two of
them.  But, you know, he, he was really blazing away.

A.81:  Yeah.  I wondered how he managed that.  

B.82:  And, uh, I think he got shot twice --  

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  -- himself.  And, uh, but he was okay, you know, it was just, he was
injured, but not seriously apparently.  But, uh, you know, it was really
surprising, but it was good, you know, [laughter] from my point of view, it
was good to see him being able to defend him, you know, his, his property and
his store.

A.85:  Exactly.

B.86:  And, uh, you know, I, I think that is, you know, that is the intent of the
Constitution is to, of that part of the Constitution, is to allow people to
defend themselves and their property.

A.87:  Uh-huh.  And, and more and more of that kind of thing happens.  I mean, can
you imagine?  I mean it used to be like, with the dapper bandit is one guy,
you know,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  with a gun.  And a, a lot of the stuff that he did, they did not
publicize because th-, it would breach the security of the rest of the ba-,
the banks.

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  One of the things that he did is, is, uh, any counter top that was there,
up to maybe like four feet high, he could vertical jump on top of the counter
top and, and,

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  and jump down and, and be with those people behind the counter --

B.94:  Right.  

A.95:  -- before they knew it,  

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  you know.  And they, they showed a, a, a, a,

B.98:  [Sneezing].  

A.99:  piece of tape of that one time, but it looked like they had cut it up
some.  And that was one of the things that was so scary about him.

B.100:  Right.  

A.101:  And not only did he, he, uh, rob banks, but he, uh, at the time when he
first started, he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at, at the
time. [noise] And that is how he, that is how he surprised the cashier.  He
jumped, he jumped back there with her and, and, you know, there was nothing
she could do by that time [/noise].

B.102:  Uh-huh.  I had, I had not heard about him robbing the Safeway.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  But then there is also, there is the, uh, what is his name?  Bernie Getz,

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  who in the New York subway.  I guess, uh, well, I would have, e-, e-,
even mixed emotions about him.  Uh, somebody carrying a gun, you know, out
into the public, on public transportation.

A.107:  Right.

B.108:  Uh, you know, of course he was, his, the purpose of him having the gun was
to defend himself.  Because he, apparently he had felt threatened, you know,
on the, on the subway before.

A.109:  Uh-huh. 

B.110:  But, uh, I am not sure that, uh, the private citizen carrying a gun is, you
know, just the routine private citizen carrying a gun --

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- is, uh, necessary to, uh,

A.113:  Yeah.  I would, 

B.114:  I mean if you are not, if you are not, uh, in a position where you have to
defend yourself, you know, uh, in a routine basis, then, uh, perhaps carrying
a gun on your person is not, uh, is not all that advisable.

A.115:  Yeah.  And then,

B.116:  Uh, I know that they are talking about here, you know, here in Texas, about
having a new gun law that would allow certain individuals to be licensed to
carry a gun.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  And, uh, I think they ought take a long, a good long hard look at, at who
is allowed to carry a gun.

A.119:  Yeah.  Right.

B.120:  In those, you know, in those situations.

A.121:  Like the, the judge, what was it, two or three months ago?  The judge in,
uh, Fort Worth, I think, maybe it was Dallas.  But he, [throat_clearing] he
just convicted, uh, a man for murder, and the guy jumped up and, and
apparently knew where the judge kept his gun.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  And held it on him for a couple of hours.

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  You know, and, and he should, he should either have kept it fairly well
concealed or kept it a secret.

B.126:  Right.  Well, I guess that, I do not really know, uh, I, I guess there is
not really a, you know, a lot to say from my point of view except that, you
know, the, the Constitution says what kind of rights we have, and I do not, I
really do not see the, the point ...
