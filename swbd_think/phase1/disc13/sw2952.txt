A.1:  Okay, what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?

B.2:  Well, uh, I have two children,  

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  One of the things that I have made time for is, uh, playing softball.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  I really enjoy, I enjoy softball, but I enjoy all kind of sports.  I enjoy
watching and participating.  I really like water sports like swimming and
skiing, but I do not get to do that too often.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  And then I, I really enjoy sewing, but I do not get much of a chance to
just really sit down and do much sewing.  How about you?

A.11:  Oh, I, uh, like sports type things too.  We like to get out and walk, and
we like the water sports too.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard
to get to do that --

B.14:  I, know it.  It is.  

A.15:  -- very often.  

B.16:  Do you work full time?  

A.17:  Yeah.  Well, part time.  We --  

B.18:  Part time.  

A.19:  -- are going to have a baby in July.  

B.20:  Oh.  

A.21:  So part of my big hobby has been [laughter] trying to put together a
nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately.

B.22:  Right.  Yeah, that definitely takes over your time. 

A.23:  Yeah,  

B.24:  [Laughter].  

A.25:  it does.  I have been,    

B.26:  Is this going to be your first?

A.27:  Yes.  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Oh.

A.29:  I have been doing some cross-stitch for something I wanted to put in the
nursery.  So, I have not --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- done that in years, but I have kind of enjoyed that.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.

B.34:  Right.  Well, that is, it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then
you have got something to show for it.

A.35:  Right, yeah.

B.36:  Yeah.  That is neat. 

A.37:  And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah.  I do too.  

A.39:  I just go out just to, just to enjoy it and not -- 

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- really spend money sometimes,  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  just look.  

B.44:  Well, since I have had kids, it is kind of funny.  I, I never really was
much of a garage sale shopper until I had kids.  But you will probably find
after your children get bigger, uh, like when they want things like tricycles,
toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store, you can find that kind of
stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars.  

A.45:  Yeah, yeah, we --

B.46:  And, 

A.47:  -- bought some baby clothes, yeah, last weekend at a garage sale.

B.48:  Yeah.  Oh, you can just get all kinds of things and kids, especially
clothes and toys, they just do not use them and wear them, you know, for that
many years or anything.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  So, I am, I have become a garage sale shopper.

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  And it is fun.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  On the weekends I drive around, look to see, you know, who is selling what.
And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class.

A.55:  Oh [laughter].

B.56:  And just, you know, all kinds of things like that, that you would probably
pay thirty dollars for, and I got them for two dollars [laughter].

A.57:  Wow!  Yeah.  

B.58:  Yeah.  So,   

A.59:  Yeah, it is kind of a hobby, it, that is time consuming too, really, to
find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop --

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  -- at a lot of places.  

B.62:  Yeah, it is.  It, it does take more time.  But I do not work, so, uh, that
is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a, have a
happy growing up years and [laughter],

A.63:  Right, yeah.  I think that is important too.  I am not --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- going to work --

B.66:  Well, 

A.67:  -- after the baby comes.

B.68:  Well, that is good.

A.69:  So,  I --

B.70:  I am glad,

A.71:  -- guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies.  I do not know
[laughter].

B.72:  Well, at first, when you first have a baby, you, uh, seems to take every
moment of your time.  Partly because you are not used to, you know, juggling
your time around like that.  But,

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  eventually the, you will, you will be doing lots of stuff.  So,

A.75:  Yeah. 

B.76:  But I think, my husband is real into sports too. He plays on a T I softball
team and the church softball team.  And by the time he plays two games a week
and I play a game a week, we go to lots of softball [laughter].

A.77:  Wow!  Yeah [laughter].  

B.78:  But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for
them to play with and we, that is getting outside and, you know, doing things
they like to do too.  So,

A.79:  Yeah.  So that is good.  A whole fam-, your whole family can enjoy those
hobbies.

B.80:  Yeah.  And one other thing we are doing this year is, uh, we bought Wet and
Wild passes.

A.81:  Oh.  

B.82:  We have never done that before, but the kids are always wanting to play in
the water.  And, uh, like you said, unless you have a pool in your backyard or
access to a good place to play, it is kind of hard. And, uh, they have real
good kiddie areas, uh, at both of the Wet and Wild's around here.  So, we are
planning on going two or three times a week [laughter].

A.83:  Oh, wow.  That will make the summer go by in a hurry.

B.84:  Yeah.  I think it will.

A.85:  Keep the kids busy.

B.86:  Yeah.  Because my oldest daughter is in school, and she gets bored real
fast when she is home with nothing to do.

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  So, I think that will be a lot of fun.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  So we are looking forward to that.

A.91:  Yeah.  Uh, do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a
chore?  [laughter].

B.92:  [Laughter] Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun
[laughter].

A.93:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.94:  But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore.  It's,

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  our yard has had so many problems.  It has completely died out two times.

A.97:  Oh, no.  

B.98:  And, uh, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.  So it has
become a chore [laughter]. 

A.99:  Huh.

B.100:  Do you and your husband like to work in the yard?

A.101:  Oh, well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it
[laughter].

B.102:  Yeah.   

A.103:  I like to put flowers out and, you know,

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  a few little things like that.  But as far as --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- mowing every week, and finding time --

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  -- to get all that stuff done,

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  it gets to be a chore.

B.112:  Yeah.  That is true.

A.113:  Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.  They kind of take over and turn into
work instead of --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- fun.  

B.116:  Well, that is how sewing.  I love to sew, and, uh, I wish I had more time
to do it.  But sometimes I will get started on a project and then finishing it
is more of a chore than [laughter],

A.117:  Yeah.  If it does not go quite, quite right.  

B.118:  Yeah.  Another thing I enjoy doing is cooking. I, I like especially, it is
real strange, but I like to cook for other people.  Like I have a friend that
is, uh, pregnant but she can't get up and walk around right now.

A.119:  Oh, no.  

B.120:  So, I enjoy, you know, cooking things to take over to her house or,

A.121:  Oh, that is nice.  

B.122:  Yeah.  And it, it is fun for me to do that.  It is, it is something I enjoy
doing.  It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us
[laughter].

A.123:  [Laughter].  

B.124:  It is kind of like when you are a kid and, and someone else's house was fun
to clean, but -- 

A.125:  Yeah.  Your,

B.126:  -- you did not want to do your own [laughter]. 

A.127:  [Laughter] How funny.  I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not
working, when I --

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  -- do not get home until five-thirty or six, and I have to cook and clean
up,

B.130:  Oh, yeah.  

A.131:  it is not, it is not fun.  But I think I will like it better.

B.132:  Yeah.  When you are home --  

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  -- it's, it makes a difference.  It sure does.  

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that?

A.137:  Uh, yeah, we have done a little bit of camping.  We like that.  It's, there
again, it is just so hard to find time to get away --

B.138:  Uh-huh.  

A.139:  -- for a whole weekend.  

B.140:  Yeah.  Well, that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend,
but the next. My parents go camping a lot, and they invited the kids and my
husband and me to go with them and,

A.141:  Oh.  That sounds fun.  

B.142:  Yeah.  We are really looking forward to it.  The girls love it.  They have
been a couple of times, and, uh, just getting to be outside, you know, all the
time and sleep in a tent.  And that is really fun to them.  So,

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  We are looking forward to that.

A.145:  Well, that sounds nice.  I, I think that would be a good family thing --

B.146:  Yeah.  I --  

A.147:  -- to start doing --  

B.148:  -- think so.  

A.149:  -- more often.  

B.150:  Yeah.  My, uh, my husband loves to fish.  I am not much into fishing, but,
uh, my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish so --

A.151:  Uh-huh.  

B.152:  -- I think it will be real good for them [laughter].

A.153:  [Laughter].   

B.154:  They can go fishing.  

A.155:  Yeah,  

B.156:  [Laughter].  

A.157:  we have camped with some friends who have young children and,

B.158:  Uh-huh.  

A.159:  uh, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right
around the shore where they can just pull in a line.

B.160:  Uh-huh.  

A.161:  Oh, they have so much fun doing that.  

B.162:  Yeah.  

A.163:  And they think they are really great fishermen --

B.164:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.165:  -- because they are catching so many [laughter]. 

B.166:  Oh, I know.  Yeah, uh, she is really looking forward.  I am hoping, that is
another thing though, when sometimes your, uh, hobbies can interfere with each
other.  Because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament
that weekend.

A.167:  Oh.

B.168:  And I am saying, no, no [laughter].

A.169:  Yeah.  Skip this tournament [laughter].

B.170:  Yeah.  If you are doing a lot of things, sometimes you have conflicts, and
you have to decide what you enjoy the most.

A.171:  Right.

B.172:  So, 

A.173:  Yeah.  Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?

B.174:  Well, not really right now.  I keep thinking when the kids get bigger and I
have a little more time, uh, I might take up, there is, I would love to
cross-stitch.  I think cross-stitching is so pretty, but I have never done
any.

A.175:  It is not too hard.  It is,   

B.176:  Yeah.  

A.177:  I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or -- 

B.178:  Yeah.  

A.179:  -- crochet or something like that.  

B.180:  Yeah.  I, I crocheted when I was younger.  It is funny, when I was in high
school, I made a blanket. And, but you know, I can't even remember how I did
it now [laughter].

A.181:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.182:  It has been so long since I did it that but,

A.183:  Yeah.  I started to s-, to knit a sweater.    

B.184:  Uh-huh.

A.185:  And I got off on my rows somehow, and so what should have been the back all
of a sudden was on the front.

B.186:  Oh, yeah.

A.187:  And then I tore it out and threw it down. [laughter] And I never have,

B.188:  [Laughter].

A.189:  picked it back up again, and now I can't remember anything about it
[laughter].

B.190:  Yeah, well, I did the same thing.  Uh, when I was pregnant with my first
daughter, I was really bored, and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits.

A.191:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.192:  It was a real pretty rug.  And I thought, well I could use this as a gift
or something, you know.  And oh, [sigh] it was so, it was beautiful, but I did
not realize how long it took.  And I got about two, two-thirds of it done,

A.193:  [Laughter].  

B.194:  and then I just, I had the baby [laughter].  

A.195:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.196:  And then it was just like --  

A.197:  Forget it.  

B.198:  -- I forgot all about it.  And every once in a while I will be digging
through the closet, and I will find that thing.  And I will think, oh, maybe I
ought to get the rest of that out, you know, and finish it.

A.199:  Yeah.  

B.200:  But, uh, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, uh, hobby.

A.201:  Yeah.  I remember that.  

B.202:  It seemed like people did them a lot.  

A.203:  Yeah.    

B.204:  Uh, uh, people do not do that much any more. So, it was something easy I
could do [laughter].

A.205:  Yeah, yeah.  They are pretty easy.

B.206:  Yeah.

A.207:  Well, it has been real good talking to you.

B.208:  Yeah.  You too.

A.209:  And I hope you enjoy your camping trip.

B.210:  Oh, thank you.  And thanks for calling.

A.211:  Uh-huh.  Bye.

B.212:  Bye-bye.
