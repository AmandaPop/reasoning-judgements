REMARKS:        Speaker A mumbled at times.  Children sounds with Speaker B.

============================================================

A.1:   Okay, so my children are twenty and twenty-four --

B.2:   Oh.

A.3:   -- and, uh, my son just moved, uh, to Arkansas.  So he's
married, so --

B.4:   Uh-huh.

A.5:   -- course, uh, uh, when, when they're here, when they lived here, and I
have a daughter whose twenty, and we spend a lot of time
together --

B.6:   Uh-huh.

A.7:   -- not so much as, you know, (( )) we're, we both have, everybody's busy,
but when my kids were younger, I was a single parent --

B.8:   Oh.

A.9:   -- and I spent most of my life with my children.  I did a,
did a lot things with the kids. 

B.10:   Yeah.

A.11:   But, uh, yeah, it's a, I don't, I, I c-, I, one thing that happened is
when, when my son, uh, graduated from high school, and he went off to
college, then it, r-, it drastically changed.  Uh, see prior to that we had sit
down dinners, and we talked, and we did a whole lot of things. 

B.12:   Uh-huh.

A.13:   And then when he left, re-, uh, my daughter and I just kind of said,
Well, let's just kind of do what, do our own thing.

B.14:   Uh-huh.

A.15:   And, uh, you know, I, I think that might, I don't know, I don't
know, you know, it's been so long since I had little children at
home, I'll, I'll leave it up to you as to what's really going on
these days.

B.16:   Yeah, well, I, first of all, I'd, I admire you for, I have a few
friends who are single parents, and I just don't know how people
do it [laughter].

A.17:   Yeah.

B.18:   That's is a tremendous burden --

A.19:   Uh-huh.

B.20:   -- to be working and have two kids to take care of and,

A.21:   Right.

B.22:   I don't know how you did it.  But, um, I have a six year old
that's, well she's in first grade.  And then I have a three and a
half year old.  And um, I have always been a big advocate of
spending tons of time with my kids.  

A.23:   Uh-huh.

B.24:   And, um, when I, my first one, when she was born, I had to
work part-time for a while because we had to have the extra
money.  But when the second one came along I was fortunate enough
that I, I quit, and I've been able to stay home.  And, um, ...

A.25:   Oh, so you're not working now?

B.26:   No.

A.27:   Great.

B.28:   No, I don't work, yeah.  So I one of those few old-fashioned
moms [laughter], and we, uh, I spend the whole day with Tara, and we
go and do things and we read books, and we play, and, you know,
it's just, it's great. 

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:   And I did the same thing with Taylor, uh,
who's my first grader, she's also a girl, and, uh, I th-, I think I can tell
a real difference.  Um, Taylor has excelled in school like I
just, I never imagined she would.  She's at the top of her class
in everything, even though she's almost a year younger than
almost all the kids in her class.

A.31:   Um.

B.32:   And I really feel like that, um, time I spent with her, I
mean, she probably already had a lot, uh, of it in her, but you know,
we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a
lot of things.  I think it helped her to feel real good about
herself and feel like she could, she could do it, you know.
[laughter]

A.33:   Yeah.

B.34:   So, it's, it's been real rewarding for me, anyway.

A.35:   Right, but you know, if, uh, uh, I know now that I can look back, and,
and I think about how much, how much time I devoted to my
children and, and it's, not necessarily, but sacrificed a social life,
because I really did --

B.36:   Oh, I'm sure.

A.37:   -- devote myself to my children.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Basically, I mean.  I mean, I was, I did some things --

B.40:   Yeah.

A.41:   -- but, I mean, I really did, but I have no regrets about
that.  

B.42:   Uh-huh.

A.43:   And, I, you know, um, and I can look back, and it was so
much fun --

B.44:   Uh-huh.

A.45:   -- being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun
things that --

B.46:   Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- you know that you get to do w-, that ch-, that kids get to do, and, and
that you wouldn't do by, do, you know, with other adults.

B.48:   Right.

A.49:   So, it's great fun.

B.50:   Yeah.

A.51:   I really envy you.

B.52:   Yeah.

A.53:   This is a wonderful time of your life.

B.54:   Well, it is, you know, as a matter of fact, I think I'm real
bad about looking ahead and thinking, Oh, I don't ever want them
to [laughter] grow up and, you know, go away to college, and all
that kind of thing.  But at least I'm really making the most of
the time while they're little, and, um, everything Taylor even
attempts to do, you know, we go and watch her and support her. 
And that was something my parents weren't able to do, and I
resented that, because I would be in, I was always in plays in
high school and in all kinds of drama, and they could never come and
watch me.  And that just, was so hard for me.  So, I made a vow
that when I had kids, no matter what they did, I was going to be
there --

A.55:   Uh-huh.

B.56:   -- you know, and see them do it.  So it, and like you said,
it's fun.  I really enjoy it.

A.57:   I can remember my, my mom started working, my parents (( )), well,
course both of them worked, but my mom started working, when, I, I
was the third, the las-, the youngest --

B.58:   Uh-huh.

A.59:   -- and she started working when I went to first grade.

B.60:   Uh-huh.

A.61:   And I can remember, just a couple of t-, few times, that she
would stay home.  And I, I don't know if she was sick or just
wanted to take the day off or what, but --

B.62:   Uh-huh.

A.63:   -- come home from school -- 

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and you know, eve-, like you'd
tell that she'd just mopped --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and she had, you know, food was
cooking and the house smelled so good, --

B.68:   Uh-huh.

A.69:   -- uh, I tell you what, I'd ta-, I don't know if children who,
maybe children who have that everyday don't, don't, don't
appreciate it as much as, you know --

B.70:   Uh-huh.

A.71:   -- but, uh, it really was, really was a special --

B.72:   Yeah.

A.73:   -- and I wished that she could have been home more.

B.74:   Yeah.

A.75:   It would have been greater because she was, because she
worked she was always kind of high strung and --

B.76:   Uh-huh.

A.77:   -- you know, didn't have the time to spend with us
individually, so.

B.78:   Right, yeah.

A.79:   I, I think it's great, if, if, uh, if, if you enjoy staying home
with your kids while they're young --

B.80:   Yeah, yeah.

A.81:   -- and, and can do it.  

B.82:   Yeah.

A.83:   That's great, I wish I could stay home now. [laughter]

B.84:   [laughter]  Well, I feel, I feel really thankful that I can. 
I mean, we have had to really lower our standard of living, you
know, we have friends who have beautiful homes, and we have a
very small, old house.  But I just, to me, that's not important,
because I feel like we'll have plenty of time to get us a nice
house some day.  [laughter]

A.85:   Uh-huh.

B.86:   And I won't have these, you know, these little kids all my
life. 

A.87:   That's right.

B.88:   So, um, I just, I have been willing to make the sacrifices,
and my husband has too.  And so, it's not been a problem for us.

A.89:  Well, and, and, uh, so you probably have a lot of friends who have small
children.

B.90:   Right.

A.91:   Do y-, do you find the trend is, uh, away from what you're doing,
or that they're not spending that much time with them, put them
off with sitters, and how abo-,    ...   ?

B.92:   Well, it's interesting.  We're real involved with a church
group, and so most of our friends are, uh, church friends.  

A.93:   Right.

B.94:   And they're, the majority of them do stay home.  Uh, almost all
of my friends I can call any time of day and they're home.  But,
um, the fr-, the friends that I've kept in contact with from, you know,
when I did work, and they're still working moms, you know, --

A.95:   Right.

B.96:   -- uh, that, I feel like I real big, uh, difference in
opinion with some of them, because some of them work just because
they enjoy working.  You know, they, they don't really have to
work, they just want to, they like to get out and they don't want to
be with their kids all day [laughter] --

A.97:   Yeah, yeah.

B.98:   -- and, and that's hard for me, because to me they're giving up
something so precious, you know, and, um, so any time we talk,
get on that topic, I have to be real careful because --

A.99:   [laughter]

B.100:   -- I'm afraid I'll say something to offend them [laughter]. 
But, um, most of my friends do stay home, so that, it's kind of
nice, we, we have a big support group around here.

A.101:   Well, that's great.

B.102:   Yeah, it is.  I don't know how long everybody will be able
to afford to keep doing it but if --

A.103:   Well ...

B.104:   -- I guess you just get used to, you know, living however
you have to live to ...

A.105:   Well, and then, you know, and then i-, if you don't ever have to go to
work and you,  and you're you're happy --

B.106:   Yeah.

A.107:   -- you know, even if your, uh, kids all the way through high
school and then it doesn't mean you have to go back to work.

B.108:   Right, yeah.

A.109:   So ...

B.110:   Yeah, well, I intend to, uh, I think when they're both in
school, I may, I have a degree to teach, and, um, I've never used
it because I was pregnant when I graduated from college, and I've
always had, you know, been home with kids or worked part-time. 
But, um, I might go into like substitute teaching or something,
because ...

A.111:   But the hours are, at least you'd be home, you know?

B.112:   Yeah, yeah.  And I can choose.  They say as a substitute you
can tell them the days that you're interested, and, you know, the
days you're not, you don't have to.  So ...

A.113:   That way, uh, maybe then, then you can find out if you're really
happy doing that if you want to do it full time later on.  So that's good.  

B.114:   Right, yeah.  Because I have a feeling I'm not going to like
it.  [laughter]

A.115:   [laughter]

B.116:   When I did my, uh, student teaching, I, oh, I hated it.  I
said, I don't know why I majored in, uh, elementary education and here
I'm about to graduate, and I don't even like this.  [laughter]

A.117:   Well, maybe now that you've had your own children --

B.118:   Yeah.

A.119:   -- you'll like to be around little children --

B.120:   Yeah.

A.121:   -- or have a l-, little better tolerance. 

B.122:   It'll probably make a whole difference, and plus I didn't
feel well at the time.  I was pregnant, and I was real sick and ...

A.123:   That'd be tough.  Yeah, yeah.

B.124:   Yeah, I, and you just don't feel like being around all these
little kids when you are just sick to your stomach. [laughter]

A.125:   [laughter]

@@B.126:   But anyway, it's been nice talking to you.

A.127:   Nice talking to you, and maybe I'll talk to you again.

B.128:   And, uh, thanks for calling.

A.129:   Okay, bye-bye.
