REMARKS:        Caller A had a squeaky door opening and shutting throughout
the conversation as well as some voices and strange noises in the background.
Caller B had voices talking in the background throughout the conversation and 
breathed loudly.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Pat can you tell me, uh, wha-, actually they want what everyday
occurrences are.

B.2:  Define everyday occurrences?  [Talking].

A.3:  Right, or do you have, 

B.4:  Every time you use a credit card,

A.5:  Yeah [noise] {strange squeaking and static noises almost like someone
tuning in a radio}.

B.6:  every time you log in to a computer terminal.  Particularly where you
have access to a, to a network.  Anybody can, with the right kind of skill and
tools get very much involved in those things which are on your system that
you don't particularly want exposed.  That's why we have such security
measures for our corporate information.  

A.7:  Um, that's a point.

B.8:  ye-, if you absolutely [breathing] [laughter].

A.9:  Um, actually, um, using credit cards,

B.10:  Uh-huh [rattling].

A.11:  the information that the person that you give it to, has, of, uh, available
to them is very limited.  That's to just your name, I guess, um, you don't
have to tell where you live, you don't have to put your phone number down.
Some people ask you for it, but you're not required to give that information.

B.12:  That's right.  When was the last time that you used a credit card that
they didn't ask for your driver's license, as well.

A.13:  Oh, very, very few up here.

B.14:  Really, um.

A.15:  Yeah, yeah, they just don't, they don't ask for a driver's license, um,

B.16:  Uh-huh, well most of our checks are even printed with our address, our
so-, even our driver's license numbers are printed on there,

A.17:  Yeah, see my,

B.18:  because they require that.

A.19:  yeah, my checks are, it's just my wife, 

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  and my name, no address, 

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  so it's just names on the check.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  So no one can, you know, I mean they can I suppose,

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  with a little leg work if they wanted to, but the average person's not
going to do that anyhow.

B.28:  Right, but we're talking about people who are interested in invading your
privacy.  People who have a reason to do that.

A.29:  Okay, um.

B.30:  People who are interested in building data bases of information about your
financial background, your educational background.  Uh, one of the biggest
fraud scams that I've heard of recently is people who have access to such
information and they find out who's a widow and what she's worth and then they
present themselves to her as a, uh, a rich suitor.  

A.31:  Oh, okay, that's, yeah, I --

B.32:  And bilk her out of anything that she has, those a-, 

A.33:  -- I've read articles about that, but --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- people have to be pretty gullible, uh, 

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  either that or, or, especially widows, um.

B.38:  There are very vulnerable people, though.  Older people are very vulnerable
to such things,

A.39:  Old people.

B.40:  and they tend to, to, 

A.41:  Right, and, and some people, some of the older people today, uh, their
husband's handled all the finances, 

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really, really
not savvy,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  as far as it comes to fi-, to handling their own personal affairs.

B.46:  Well on the other hand, how can you be savvy with so much out there today?
There are so many clever scams and, and many of them are computer based and
they're based on information that's available in the public realm.

A.47:  Yeah, I'm, I'm still not convinced that they can get you if you're, if
you're aware.  

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  First of all you never should give your, your, uh, credit card numbers
over the phone to anyone.

B.50:  That's right.

A.51:  Which is, which is kind of basic.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Um, they, people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine I
guess, 

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  they sell lists of names to other people.

B.56:  Uh-huh, that's right.

A.57:  But they'll send you junk mail usually.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Um, and you can stop that easy enough, just go to the post office and just
have your name taken off.

B.60:  Uh-huh, did you, have you registered for a conference recently?

A.61:  Uh, yes I have.  

B.62:  Okay, did they ask for your fax number?  

A.63:  No, they did not.

B.64:  Okay, I registered my people for several conferences in the past six
months and they'll ask for your telephone number and they'll also ask for a
fax number.  You would think on the surface that that is for rapidly sending
you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that.
Not at all.

A.65:  Right.

B.66:  Those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your
street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations (( )) over your
fax.  

A.67:  Yeah, but that's, uh, 

B.68:  And you don't expect it from that source, therefore you're not as, uh,
you know, you're not as leery.

A.69:  Isn't, doesn't corporate have a, didn't they put a stop on that?

B.70:  Uh, some, some cases.  But, tha-, it, it exists, is what I'm saying, 

A.71:  Yeah, right. 

B.72:  those avenues exist.

A.73:  Yes, they do exist,

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  and if someone wants to really find out about you, I suppose if they
wanted to go to all that trouble they could, uh.

B.76:  I heard a story not long ago, this guy saw a really attractive young woman
and he said hey, I'd like to know this girl more.  So he wrote down her
license plate number and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her
address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in
the credit bureau and he got her financial standing, okay.

A.77:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.78:  From that he also got her social security number and certain social
security information is, uh, a matter of, is, it is accessible if you know
somebody in the government.  So before it was over with he knew that she was
divorced, she had two children, what school they went to, what her average
income was, he knew that she'd gotten a boat in the divorce because he was
able to get those public records,

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  he knew all about her.

A.81:  Yeah, you could do that if you really want to, yeah. 

B.82:  And he intro-, yeah, he introduced himself to her, he said I think our
kids went to school together at such and such school.  Sh-, I don't really
remember that, and, I mean, you know, he was relying on her not remembering,
or,

A.83:  Right, yeah.

B.84:  or not being willing to admit that she didn't remember him, 

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  and just moved right in on her.

A.87:  Yeah, that's, and you can do that, anyone can do anything,

B.88:  Sure.

A.89:  that's public record, whether it's divorce or anything like that,

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  um, whether you purchase a home, that's all, that's all public record.  

B.92:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's right.

A.93:  Um, what they do with that information, people are really, um, go out and
do it I suppose, somebody does the leg work, and they,

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  and they generate a list, um, it's, uh, I think lists are generated from
lists, now and,

B.96:  Uh-huh, that's true.  I'm still getting lists from many, many years ago.  

A.97:  Right.

B.98:  Or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago.

A.99:  Yeah, we had, uh, we've got a, an account at Sears and Roebuck,

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:   and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our
address listed now with, with double towns in it,

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  and I've tried and tried and tried to get it off, but you, just can't
get it so,

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  since then, we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both
towns, so I know damn well,

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else.

B.108:  Of course.

A.109:  But there isn't anything you can do about that.

B.110:  No, you can't stop them from selling your lists.  Although some of them
really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to
put your name on a mailing list then we will not.

A.111:  Right, some of the, some of the charities now will, will do that,

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  if you chose, choose not to have your,

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  your name put on a list and I, I do that, you know, we have our charities,

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  that we give to and then we say yes, no, just don't.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  Because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list.

B.120:  Uh-huh.  And you have to really do some research or you do not find out
who is legitimate and who is not.  And sometimes finding out who is legitimate
and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about
people.

A.121:  That's right, that's exactly right.

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  Most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect,

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  go to fund the organization.

B.126:  Absolutely.

A.127:  I mean very, very little of the funds get out to do, uh, anything
worthwhile.

B.128:  That's right [breathing] [laughter].

A.129:  Um, it all started with the government.  The government started keeping
tabs on you, and whether they,

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  those list that internal revenue has, whether they leak out to the
public or not, I'm really not sure.  Maybe in some cases they have, in the
past.  Uh, once a list is out, it's out forever.

B.132:  Oh yeah, you bet, you bet.  And with computer technology now, look how
spooky it is for how accessible these things are.

A.133:  Yeah.  But the bulk of it, probably ninety-seven to ninety-eight percent
of all those lists are going just for solicitations.  Um, some people maybe
are using them for ulterior motives, I'm not really sure.

B.134:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.135:  But the bulk of them is, and it's junk mail and you can, you can,

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  you can get off those junk mail lists.  

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  You just tell the post office.

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  So that will limit that amount of stuff.

B.142:  Sure.

A.143:  I read, uh, I read and article where this, this man, uh, se-, sent to
everything they could possibly get and he was getting reams and reams of
paper,

B.144:  Uh-huh [rustling].

A.145:  all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  and what he was doing with them, he was storing them up and he was using
them for fuel --

B.148:  Way to go, neat.

A.149:  -- during the winter time.  

B.150:  That's great.

A.151:  What I do is on all the credit card solicitations, 

B.152:   Uh-huh.

A.153:  if they have a return envelope with it, I write across the face of it,
no thank you, your rates are too high,

B.154:  Uh-huh.

A.155:  and I mail it back to them.

B.156:  Uh-huh.

A.157:  Because now they have to pay the postage, so now it's costing them
something to do that.

B.158:  Yeah, they don't put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore.

A.159:  They don't?

B.160:  Not as many as I've seen in the past.

A.161:  Oh, up here they do.  

B.162:  Um.

A.163:  Well they're still doing it.  Well it's just like up here we don't,
there's very, very few times I've had to show my driver's license for,

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  to use a credit card.

B.166:  Yeah [breathing] [laughter].

A.167:  Uh, and I'm not sure why, you know, why it's so prevalent down there and,
maybe it will catch up, up here.

B.168:  Um, that's possible [breathing] [laughter].  I really don't understand that
either, but my stars, some of it, sometimes it's very difficult.  Now the
gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your
drivers license.

A.169:  Yeah, we've got the --

B.170:  Although some of them have a blank on there for it, they don't generally
enforce using it.

A.171:  -- we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump.

B.172:  Um, I've not seen one of those [breathing] [laughter].

A.173:  Yeah, so whatever yo-, whatever brand that you buy, you just drive up to
the pump, 

B.174:  Uh-huh.

A.175:  you put your credit card in it and then it says, you know, please
commence pumping and then when you pump, then when you're through --

B.176:  Uh-huh.

A.177:  -- you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you
can push yes, if you want one and if you don't want one you push no,
