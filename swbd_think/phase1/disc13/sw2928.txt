============================================================================

@A.1:  All right, Robert [whispering].  Bad dog {resumes talking}.  Uh, my dog
just went on the floor.  Anyway, um, what do you do about recycling in your
area?

B.2:  Well, as a matter of fact, uh, it's, it's funny they I chose this subject
because, uh, uh, the City of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just, uh, put in
a city wide recycling, uh, regime, in which, uh, bottles and newspapers are
recycled, and a truck comes around, uh, once every couple of weeks, and they
separate your bottles for you and your newspapers, and, uh, and they give
little, uh, or actually fairly large green plastic, uh, containers to put out
curbside and all that.  So I think this is a real sign of progress here in the
City of Raleigh.

A.3:  They separate everything for you?

B.4:  They do.  All you have to do is you put all your glass in the bottom of
this thing --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- followed by your plastic, followed by the newspapers, and when they come
around to pick it up they do all the separation.

A.7:  Wow.

B.8:  So you only have one place to put stuff.

A.9:  Wow.

B.10:  So they've made it, uh, they've made it convenient.  It used to be if you
wanted to recycle you had to drive to a, uh, a central location in the city
and then do all the separation yourself.  And a lot of people didn't do it
just because the recycling location was so unpleasant.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Because you know when you have all that amount of stuff, pretty soon you
have various kinds of vermin running around, and --

A.13:  [Laughter]  Right.

B.14:  -- women seem to have something against having mice running across their
feet,

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  when they're trying to recycle.

A.17:  Yeah.  That sounds like it's, uh, a really a, what you have to do
basically, you have to make it as easy and convenient for people as possible.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  And, unfortunately, while the responsibility should be on the consumer, it
will be placed on the cities now because, you know of the convenience factor.
I try to get as, I try to save aluminum cans and, uh, plastic and all that,
and whether I get much for it or not doesn't really bother me.  But, uh, you
know, I live in Sherman, Texas, which is probably a small town of about, I
don't know, twenty, twenty-five thousand --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and they have sites around in the community to, the grocery stores are
really helping out a lot.  They allow you, they've got fenced in areas
[barking] on their properties, and and you go and, uh, drop off all your goods
there, but like you said, you have to separate [barking] them, and, uh, I
don't know if it's really, I don't think it's that bad cleanliness wise,
because it's there on the store's property --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- and it's on a, it's on con-, it's on, you know, asphalt, and there's
huge trash bins, but there may be some unsightly [barking] creatures running
around.

B.24:  I wonder what happens if somebody just misses with a bottle and it hits the
asphalt.  I would think you'd just end up with a [barking] lot of broken
glass, unless you swept up every day.

A.25:  Yeah, yeah, I've, I don't drop mine off there.  I take mine in to a, uh, a,
uh, a big metal recycling place that takes about everything, and they pay you
for it [barking].

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  So, I've never taken mine to the, to grocery stores and dropped off
[barking] but,

B.28:  Yeah, but, uh, it, it, it sounds, let's see, y-, you may, you said one
thing that, uh, uh, you know, just for the, the sake of argument here, um,
[barking] that, that I'd like to bring up, and that is whether it's the
function of government to do the recycling rather than the individual
consumer.

A.29:  Uh-huh [/barking].

B.30:  And I guess my opinion would be that that's maybe one of the few functions
that government ought to do.  I can think of a lot of things that they
shouldn't do that they do do.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  But, uh, it seems like recycling is something that, uh, that the government
ought to do and that everybody ought to pay for, because I think in the long
run, it's one of those things that's, that's of universal benefit to every
citizen in the country.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  Well, all I was saying was that to get it done it would have to
take the, the convenience, a-, and the burden would have to be placed on
someone other than the consumer --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- because the consumer just won't do it.

B.36:  Right, right.

A.37:  So, if, if government should do it, you know, somebody's got to do it, and
if, if anybody, it should be the government, but, you know, ultimately it
should be the responsibility of the consumer.  But that just won't happen,
it's unrealistic.  So, uh, you know, in the ideal society everyone would, uh,
buy all unre-, all recyclable stuff and everything would get recycled and we
wouldn't have any problem.  But, uh --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- that's not feasible, so, uh, yeah, the government should probably step
in and, uh, take a little more charge.  And what's really good is, um, uh,
that the government there in Raleigh, I mean, they've, you know, they provide
the bags, didn't you say that?

B.40:  They pro-, well, they provide these big plastic, uh, boxes actually.

A.41:  Yeah?

B.42:  They're a good size box, maybe eighteen, uh, inches by, uh, thirty inches
in size, and, uh, you know, maybe fifteen inches deep.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  A good sturdy plastic box, and it's got, uh, some, uh, uh, bungy cord, uh,
kind of arrangement so when you put your newspapers on the top they don't blow
away in the wind if it's windy.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And, uh, and then they, they apparently built these rather, uh, uh, fancy
trucks that come around and have, and have the various bins for the re-,
various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the
newspaper.

A.47:  Huh.

B.48:  And they're kind of these high sort of, uh, high tech, uh, uh, trash
collector trucks.  They're big things, too, they must be as long as, at least
as long as a school bus.

A.49:  Wow.

B.50:  And, uh, I'm sure it's costing the City of Raleigh money, but of course, I
mean, that comes out of the taxes and so the people are ultimately paying for
it, and I think that people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of
having newspapers and bottles and, and plastics and all that.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  I wonder if, uh, the government there makes any money off the
recycling.

B.52:  Well, I think that they, that they do attempt to, uh, that, that, that
they, they sell the, the glass and the newspaper.  My understanding is that
they don't meet expenses with it, but that they offset a lot of expenses.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  One of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint
costs about twenty-five or thirty percent of what recycled newsprint costs.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  So a newspaper company is not, is not going to buy recycled newsprint when
virgin newsprint is available at a third of the cost.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And I think one of the problems there is that, is, is the cost of virgin
newsprint is not being accuratel-, accurately reflected, because that cost
ought to reflect the cost of recycling.

A.59:  [Barking]  Um.

B.60:  And, and what the government needs to do, really, in a good capitalist
society, I mean, capitalism thrives on there being a fair price for a product,
and, and that price ought to, has to include, uh, the cost of its disposal and
it also has to include the cost of, of any damage it inflicts on the
environment.  And that's really where we as a capitalist society have gone,
have gone awry.  We have not really assigned costs appropriately.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  For example, the real cost of a barrel of oil, if you take into account
pollution and all of the other side effects, is probably a hundred dollars a
barrel.  Now I'm just guessing --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- but I bet you that that's an accurate guess.

A.65:  Um.

B.66:  And, but we're, we're paying twenty, so the, the cost is wrong on that
thing.  And somewhere along the line you have to pay the piper.  That's what
Adam Smith was saying hundreds of years ago as far as capitalism is concerned.
If you don't charge the right prices, you're going to, eventually that price
is going to make itself felt.  But the way to make the system work is to, is
to put the price on the commodity and have the people who use the commodity
pay that price.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And the role of government in a capitalist society is to see that that
happens.  And the way government, uh, does that is through taxation.  So with
newsprint, for example, the government should tax virgin newsprint to the
point where its, uh, its price is pretty much the same as recycled newsprint
and earmark that money for the recycling of newsprint, you see what I mean?

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  So that the people who use the newsprint are ultimately paying for the
entire product.  Not only for its production but for its disposal.

A.71:  Um.

B.72:  Hey I bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on it
[laughter].

A.73:  No, I didn't figure I'd get a lecture, but I never thought of that.
That's, you know, I didn't know there was such a price difference there.  What
about oil, recycling oil?

B.74:  Well, the, the, um, of course most, you know, you can't recycle oil in the
form of gasoline because --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- it's destroyed.  So there's not a question of recycling there, but there
is a question of, of, uh, environmental damage.

A.77:  Well, I was talking about like motor oil.

B.78:  Oh, yeah.

A.79:  Because I had read an article about ten years ago that said it costs so
much less to just clean up the motor oil that's, that's used in the engine --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- and run it through a few different processes than, you know, it's, it's
more economical to actually do that, and I was just wondering if it's just
slow because it's messy or because there aren't the facilities available to
recycle the oil.  I was wondering if you knew anything about that.
