===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  ((All right)).  Do you work?

B.3:  Yes, I do.

A.4:  What do you do?

B.5:  Uh, I'm a data manager at a manufacturing company that makes landing gear.

A.6:  Oh.  Well do they have good job benefits?

B.7:  Yes, they do.  

A.8:  Huh.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  Very good.  Uh, comparable, I used to work for T I and I used to
work for Martin Marietta, and they are comparable to them.  Um, as good or
better.

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  What, do, do you work?

A.12:  No, I don't.

B.13:  Oh, okay.  

A.14:  Uh, I said my husband works on the railroad.  They've got a lot of
benefits, but it's expensive.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  Uh!  The insurance is a kick in the tail every month [laughter].

B.17:  Really?

A.18:  Uh-huh.  It wo-, 

B.19:  Well, I, uh, my insurance is, is very reasonable where I work, and #course
the,#

A.20:  #Well the# insurance is good.  We only have to pay like a hundred dollar
deductible per year.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  It's just it's, uh, it's like a hundred dollars a month.

B.23:  Oh, is it really?

A.24:  Yeah, well, I mean, well that's just,

B.25:  Well I, I chose an H M O, and mine only runs five dollars a, uh, five
dollars a month.

A.26:  Well, this is, uh, like retirement benefits, and, it's a bunch of different
benefits in one.  It's not just --

B.27:  Oh, I see.

A.28:  -- it's not just medical insurance.

B.29:  Okay, well I pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a
retirement, uh, benefits pack-, a profit sharing type of thing. They match
our, uh, we can put in up to fifteen percent and they'll match, uh, sixteen,
six percent one hundred percent, you know, so that is --

A.30:  #That's great.#

B.31:  -- #that's better# than most companies do.

A.32:  Yeah, that's good.

B.33:  Plus, plus they, you know, we have bonds, we have a credit union.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  It's a fairly, it's not a real large company.  Well, it is, it's part of a
large company, it's a subsidiary of a large company and [clicking] {phone},

A.36:  Whoops, I'm sorry.

B.37:  That's my call waiting, they'll just have to call back.  Uh, we have, uh,

A.38:  [Door] [TV] [child_crying] I'm sorry.

B.39:  [Clicking] We're part of a company, we have a company in California, a
company in Canada, and this company here.  So we have about five hundred
employees at each place.

A.40:  They do.

B.41:  So it's, there's about fifteen hundred all together.  Then we, but 
we're a, a subsidiary of, of a larger company, so we have all the benefits 
that all the big large companies have.  I don't know any that we don't have.

A.42:  I don't know a lot about benefits.  Most of the jobs that I've had, you
know,

B.43:  [Clicking]. 

A.44:  I don't have a degree, I quit college when I first got pregnant with 
my --

B.45:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.46:  -- little boy.  I plan on going back, [baby_crying] just I want to wait 
for my kids to grow up now.

B.47:  Yeah. 

A.48:  [Baby] And, uh, uh, I'm sorry [laughter].

B.49:  That's all right.  

A.50:  So all I've had is mainly fast food jobs, and I worked at a toy store 
and I worked at T I for a while, but it was for Manpower so,

B.51:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.52:  I liked working at T I.

B.53:  I worked for T I for seventeen years.  And then I moved to Florida and
worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years.  And then I got,

A.54:  Oh, you're in Florida?

B.55:  I wa-, no I'm in Texas.  Uh, I left Martin Marietta for this company here
in Fort Worth.  It's, I'm in Grapevine right now --

A.56:  Oh, okay.

B.57:  -- but I work in Fort Worth.  And they just offered me such a fantastic
deal, I, I just couldn't turn it down.  There wasn't any way I could turn it
down.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  They, they moved me and they paid for every, I mean they paid for
everything.  My license, my driver's license, all my utilities at my home,
plus, you know, paying to move my furniture, and --

A.60:  [Baby_crying]  Sh.

B.61:  -- my license tags, everything.  I just, you know, and, plus a huge salary
increase.  And I thought, God I'll be stupid if I don't take this.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  And I wanted to come back to Texas anyway so,

A.64:  [Baby_crying]  Well, that's great.

B.65:  And like I say, they have all the same benefits that Martin Marietta and T
I had, so, um, I've,

A.66:  What did you say you did again?  A compu-, a data?

B.67:  I'm a data manager.  

A.68:  Huh.  

B.69:  And it,

A.70:  Well I took data processing in college.

B.71:  Oh, di-, no.  This is, a lot of people think that it has something to do
with computers,

A.72:  [Baby_crying].

B.73:  and it really does, I mean, I do have a computer, but it really doesn't
have anything to do with computers.  It's data that, uh, is generated, like
reports, test reports, financial reports, all kinds of reports that, that a
project would generate, uh, now it's my job to see that contractually these
people, you know, deliver them on time, and I have to make sure that they,
they do get delivered.  And that's, that's what my job is.  And it's, that's
that kind of data instead of,

A.74:  Instead of computer data.

B.75:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.76:  Well, that sounds great though.  What did you do at T I?

B.77:  I was a, a configuration manager at, at T I, which was sim-, well, it was,
uh, similar, but wasn't.  I mean I, it was, uh, doing, it was a little bit
more technical, configuration management, it is a little bit more technical
than what I'm doing now.  And I liked it, but it was a, it was a job that I
always felt like I didn't have control of.  You know what I mean?

A.78:  #Right.#

B.79:  #I never# felt like I mastered that job.  And when I moved to Florida, I
moved down there as a configuration manager, and stayed there from, stayed at
that job for quite a while, until I got an opportunity to go into data
management, which I, and I've been in that ever since and love it.  I mean,
that's just my cup of tea.  The configuration --

A.80:  Right.

B.81:  -- manager was just,

A.82:  I always hate to feel out of control of anything.

B.83:  Oh, I do too, 

A.84:  Yeah.

B.85:  and I really did.  I'd sit there, and, you know, when people asked me
what I did, I never could really tell them what I did because I didn't know,

A.86:  [Laughter].

B.87:  because I, you know, I was doing the job.

A.88:  You played it by ear.

B.89:  And I was getting good raises and my boss even got non-periodic raises,
but I really just felt so out of control.

A.90:  Um.

B.91:  So, but anyway I'm, and I, like I say, I've always been with a company
that's had a lot of benefits.  So, uh, and, and, when you get older, now I
know when you're younger, my daughter doesn't realize it, but I wish I had
when I was younger, thought about retirement, but you know --

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  -- you think, oh, that's twenty years away from now, who's going to worry
about it.

A.94:  Well, me and my husband are, we've talked about it.  We're having six
dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement.

B.95:  That's good.  That's smart.  I wish I could talk my daughter into 
realizing that #she works# --

A.96:  #Well, that's,#

B.97:  -- at T I also.  And she,

A.98:  At the T I,

B.99:  Yeah.

A.100:  in Sherman, or.

B.101:  No, she wo-, at the Expressway site, S C Building.  And, uh,

A.102:  Okay, well, uh,

B.103:  Uh.

A.104:  um, that's about the only thing we're doing for retirement now.  When I
worked, I wanted to go to T I.  I was wanting to become a T I -er.

B.105:  Uh-huh.

A.106:  That way I could get some benefits --

B.107:  Yeah.

A.108:  -- because most the jobs around here you can't get benefits --

B.109:  I know, isn't that a shame.

A.110:  -- especially if you, well, if you don't have a degree or something.

B.111:  Right.

A.112:  But I'll go back to school one of these days and I will get me,

B.113:  Well, I was, uh, forty-five before I got my degree.  I, uh, started back
when I was, it took me nine years.  I was about thirty something before I even
went back to school, or even started college.

A.114:  Uh-huh.

B.115:  And I was forty-five when I finally graduated.

A.116:  Well I was eighteen, and I went and got my G E D.  

B.117:  Uh-huh.

A.118:  I quit the high school --

B.119:  Uh-huh.

A.120:  -- I just couldn't stand it.  

B.121:  Oh, yeah.

A.122:  And then course I hated it.  Two years after I quit --

B.123:  Yeah.

A.124:  -- I wish I'd never done it.  But then I, I went and got my G E D and I
went to school and th-, I loved college.  I was making a three point oh
average.

B.125:  Really.

A.126:  I wasn't having hardly any problems, except for with my computer class.

B.127:  Yeah.

A.128:  I did have problems there, but, uh, now I was, then I was old enough to
know, you know, well I'm paying for it I've got to --

B.129:  Uh-huh.

A.130:  -- you know, do something with it.  But then I wanted to stay home with 
the babies so, 

B.131:  Yeah, I stayed home with my kid, I guess the longest I ever stayed home 
was eight years, I stayed home with my kids.  Uh, my son went ahead and 
graduated from college.  And my daughter has quite a few hours, but she, 
bless her, she and her husband, are you know, are kind of struggling.  He's 
a policeman, (( )), so they, they're still both having, and she works a 
second job too.  So, she really doesn't have time.  I gu-, if she wanted to 
make time, she could, but, and eventually I think she'll go back when it 
really means something to her.  But right now that's not foremost ((she 
likes being with her little girl)).

A.132:  Well, we're having a hard time right now, too, but it's just, who, if the
kid, if kids don't have direction, if their mother ain't home directing them
through the day, kids are growing up wild nowadays.

B.133:  Oh, I know it, I know it.

A.134:  My mom had to work, and I, I can feel the difference.  Um, a lot of, well,
my husband had somebody to push him.  His mother was able to stay home with
him more --

B.135:  Yes.

A.136:  -- and, you know, he got his life straight at an early age,

B.137:  Uh-huh.

A.138:  which I'm not a, I never went wild or anything, but I still don't know
what I want to be when I grow up, and I'm twenty-seven years old [laughter].

B.139:  I know it [laughter].  That's me.

A.140:  Yeah.

B.141:  I, here am I in my fifties and I still don't know what I want to do.  But
my, my mother didn't work, she was always home.

A.142:  Huh.

B.143:  So, (( )) I guess really, looking back, knowing that she was always 
there when we got home from school, my mother was there,

A.144:  Uh-huh. 

B.145:  and now what I did when my kids were growing up, since I had to work, I
worked nights.  I was home, I was sleepy, but I was home when they got home
from school.

A.146:  Yeah, that's what's important, isn't it?

B.147:  Yeah.

A.148:  You have, while I, when they start going to school, now my baby's just
three months old.

B.149:  Uh-huh.

A.150:  And I'm not having any more, so, I'm going to be there for them --

B.151:  Uh-huh.

A.152:  -- at least until they're in the second, well, until the baby starts to,

B.153:  school.

A.154:  pre-, uh, kindergarten --

B.155:  Yeah.

A.156:  -- not preschool, which it don't take long.  It seems like just yesterday
that my little boy was born, and he's fixing to go to school next year.

B.157:  Oh, is he?

A.158:  Yeah.  They're all growing up.

B.159:  Your, your husband works for the railroad, you say?

A.160:  Yeah, he sure does.

B.161:  Oh, now, d-, do they have pretty good benefits there besides, uh.

A.162:  Yeah, their medical and dental is real good.

B.163:  Is it?

A.164:   And like I said, they do make it easy for you to, that's where a lot of 
our money is going is toward his retirement.  But, I want, we'll like that 
once --

B.165:  Sure.

A.166:  -- you know, we get older --

B.167:  Oh, yeah, abso-,

A.168:  -- and we'll need it.  And like I said that's six dollars a day, and oh, I
haven't really sat down and figured it out.

B.169:  Uh-huh.

A.170:  Guess it'd be pretty easy.

B.171:  Yeah.

A.172:  Three times six is what, eighteen?   Yeah --

B.173:  Oh, once I did.

A.174:  -- so it's a hundred and eighty a month.

B.175:  Well, yeah, that'll add up fast, fast, fast.

A.176:  Yeah.

B.177:  Absolutely.  Yeah, you're smart in doing that.  I would never quit that.

A.178:  No.

B.179:  #Well, I've started, uh,#

A.180:  #Well, it's, it's like this,# we don't see it, so we don't really miss it.

B.181:  That's right, I went the other day and had them start taking some money 
out of my, uh, sa-, checking at work in, to put into savings account, plus 
I buy a two hundred dollar a month, a bond a month, so they'll, and they'll
stack up faster than you realize.

A.182:  Yeah, now I wish they had that bond here.  I know that they had that
at T I,

B.183:  Uh-huh.

A.184:  for the T,
