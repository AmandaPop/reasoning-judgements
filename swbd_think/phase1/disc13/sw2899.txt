===========================================================================

@A.1:  Alright, Rob, what do you think about, uh, choosing a college?

B.2:  Yeah, what should I tell my parents, huh?

A.3:  Yeah [laughter].

B.4:  Not being a parent, but being a student, uh, I guess I'd say, th-, there's
a lot of things.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Uh, I think they need to provide a lot of guidance during high school,

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  preparing them for the college they want to go to, and then it's a
trade-off between what, you know, what, you got to find out what a kid wants
out of college, [talking] you know, is it, uh, a, a social thing, or is he
looking to make big bucks later with a, with a name brand college, so to
speak.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Things like, you know, do you go to S M U, you want to spend all that money
and get that name, or do you, you know, you, you just kind of wasting your
time to spend all that money if you're not going to use the degree for
something.

A.11:  Yeah.  Do you think a child in high school could know what they want in a
college?

B.12:  I don't think in high school you know, but I think that's when you should
start being exposed to the ideas and start asking some questions.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Having the, hav-, you know, somebody that's been to college needs to sit
down and explain these things to you.  You know, I went in, not knowing
anything, and if I'd a had a little better idea what was going on, I'd a
probably made a lot of decisions differently.

A.15:  In what way?

B.16:  Oh, I'd probably started sooner and taken courses in high school that would
have prepared me better for, for what I was going to see.

A.17:  Yeah.  Would you have, uh, went to the name college or,

B.18:  Probably not in my situation, I don't have the money for it but,
uh,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  then again, it's kind of hard to say where I would have gone, had
I been thinking about it back in high school.

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  So, 

A.23:  Uh,

B.24:  I think, I don't know, to me college was a, was a, I knew nothing about
what it was going to be like.  It's, it's a whole different thing than high
school.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  You know, just go up and show up, and stay up all day, and, and you know,
they tell you what to do and you do it.  It's kind of a, you drop in a couple
times a week and it's up to you to, to learn it and get it done.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  So, I think those are the kinds of things that parents sh-, should
let their kids know if they know themselves.  Yeah, college is a whole
different ball game.

A.29:  Yeah.  Did either of your parents go to college?

B.30:  No.

A.31:  Yeah. Neither did mine, so, 

B.32:  So, yeah.

A.33:  I wasn't really, didn't know what to expect, so, uh, yeah, it sounds
like, uh, like you said.  Sometimes the, the name colleges, the, the large
major universities carry the big name, and, uh, if they're private, you know,
like a Harvard or something, they're big bucks.  Sometimes, fortunately,
though, uh, some of the big name schools are in state,

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  and they're state universities, like, uh, Michigan, or, you know, Purdue,
or something like that, and you can get, uh, a good education at a good cost,
you #know.#

B.36:  #Decent price.#  #Yeah.#

A.37:  #If,# if you're in state.  But, if, you know, if your kids are, ou-, uh,
uh, they want to go to college out of state, you know, you have to, look, like
you said, is the, are y-, are they going to get the education that's going to
balance out?  Like here in Sherman there's Austin College, and I'm from up
north, I never heard of Austin College, but it's well respected in this area.
It's private, it's very expensive, and just talking to people that go there,
it is, uh, you know, y-, you know the professors on a first name basis, you go
over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them, and at the
major universities you just don't do that.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  You know, there's thirty thousand people there and there's couple hundred
people in each of your class, and, and I remember one professor wanted to have
people over, but people were, you know, just kind of scared to go over, and,
are they going to be called brownnoser, when, uh, so it's just sort of
unaccepted,

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  you just kind of go to class and you don't usually use the office hours.
I mean, there's not the, the relationship.  You get the degree with the big
name on it, but, you know, you don't build that, there's a lot of learning
that you don't get,

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  as opposed to, that's what I like about Austin College.  I didn't know
that, because I'd never been around any small colleges, but, uh,

B.44:  #((that)),# 

A.45:  #but# there again, like you said, the big name, the big bucks, you know,
you can go anywhere with a, a degree from Stanford, you know, and people turn
heads, but, you know, a degree from Austin College, or something, you know,
where's that?  Well, you know, it's not really well known.  And unfortunately,
sometimes that has to do with their sports program, you know.

B.46:  Right, right.

A.47:  I-, if, uh, you know, well, some schools, maybe not.  Like U N L V, you
know, people kind of think that's a joke, you know, and, you know, it's big
name and everybody knows about it, and everybody wears U N L V shirts, but,
you know, what kind of education are these people getting?  But, you know,
some of the other schools, like, uh, you know, North Carolina and Duke, you
know, while they're successful in, like, basketball, I mean, people know that
they're really good in academics.

B.48:  Right.  A lot of the schools I th-, I think, I don't know for sure, but I
think the schools up in the northern states are o-, generally provide a better
t-, education.  I could be wrong about that, but my experience with Texas
schools has not been all that great.

A.49:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've never been to school down here, so I really don't know.
Uh, I guess, there again, I mean, there's the good and the bad, like,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  um, there seem to be a lot of junior colleges and community colleges down
here and up north there aren't.  I mean, pretty much you either go to a
technical school out of, if you go to further schooling, you go to, like a
technical school, like a Devry, or something like #that,#

B.52:  #Right.#

A.53:  or you go to a university or a major college, there are n-,
[laughter] there, as far as I know, there are very few,
