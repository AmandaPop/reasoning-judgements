========================================================================

A.1:  Do you know something about how to take care of kids?  [laughter].

B.2:  Yeah, I was just wondering, how did this get on my list? [laughter].

A.3:  It is what?

B.4:  How, how did this subject get on my list?  Oh,

A.5:  I,

B.6:  well.

@A.7:  I do not know.  I have got mine.

B.8:  I am not sure.  Uh, well, uh, my children are grown now, but I used cher-,
child care services, uh, for a number of years.  And I, I do not know if I had
it to do it over again, maybe I would be a little more selective and really,
you know, find out more about them.  I think the main thing was that I needed
someone to take care of my children.  And I, and I generally used some place
that was either, you know, uh, close to where I lived or close to where I
worked.  And I really never had an-, had any real problems and always felt
like that they did a good job.  And, uh, but I do not have small children now,
so, uh, I do not know if it would be different now, you know.  I hear, I hear,
I know a lot of, uh, mothers or, uh, people that I work with and they are
putting, you know, their children in different places.

A.9:  Well,  

B.10:  Uh,

A.11:  yeah, I, I do not have kids yet, uh,

B.12:  [Laughter].  

A.13:  I am work for a couple, uh, for at least two or three years.

B.14:  So you're,

A.15:  And my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point.  
Uh,

B.16:  Yeah.  Uh, I suppose, uh, d-, it depends on what kind of program they have.
Especially for summer, summer programs.  Uh, whether or not, you know, a lot
of it is, uh, when they are in school and, you know, their after school thing.
You would hope they would have time for studying, but most of the time they do
not, they just play.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  But, uh, I think Summer time, uh, I, I know, I was talking to one lady.
She is just changing her daughter to a different, uh, child care center for
the Summer.  Because they have so much structured time and they offer
different classes.  Like her daughter is going to be taking gymnastics.  And
she said if she had left her where that she was, uh, previously, that a lot of
time would, you know, just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted
do, and a lot of times they get bored.  So,

A.19:  That is actually, yeah, what I have been, I am thinking of the child care
center.  Because th-, they have like licensing procedures and, and stuff like
that, that seems to me, you know, good.  And, I mean it is, a state license to
seemingly --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- more often than not it means that they are good.  And they have lots of
activities and people who know how to take care of the kids and some,

B.22:  And I guess the ratio of, of workers to children, you know, would be
something to consider.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  Uh, especially if they are little bitty,

A.25:  [Cough].  

B.26:  children, that would be a, I wou-, I, I would hate to leave an, uh, a
real small baby, you know.  Uh, before, say before three or four years old.
Anything, anyone young-, younger than that, I would, uh, kind of feel, kind of
uncomfortable about leaving the child.  But,

A.27:  With somebody else, yeah.  Oh, I agree.  

B.28:  Yeah.  But I did it.  So, I mean,  

A.29:  And,  

B.30:  but, but l look back on some of the things that I did with my kids and I
shudder,

A.31:  I wonder,   

B.32:  you know.

A.33:  actually, I wonder about costs.  Because most people I know who, who have
kids, you know, uh, one parent does not work a part of the time.  You know,
only works part time and takes care of the kid part time.  And then it turns
out that, that person's salary just winds up going to paying --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- the people who, who, who take care of the kids.

B.36:  That is true, that is true.

A.37:  You know, that, whi-, which amazes me.  Uh, uh, I, you know, it never
occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be.

B.38:  So, basically I think that when they do that, that person really feels a
need to get out of the house.  And, you know, even if their, the money is
going mostly to child care, they are not really having much to take home.

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  It is something a fill-, fulfilling a, another need, I suppose, than
staying home with, with children all the time.  But that is a tough deal to do
too, too, you know.  But, uh, it would be nice to, to work, you know.  I do
not know.  I do not know a good solution to that, but, but it is, it is tough
to be, I, I started to say stuck at home with children,

A.41:  [Laughter].  

B.42:  all the time [laughter] {mimics dramatic voice}.  And never getting
out [laughter].  That is, that is just probably not a real good way to put it.
  
A.43:  Yeah that,   

B.44:  But some people, you know, they, their, their life, and children call be a
full time job.  And you do not have time for anything else.  So you, so I
would say, maybe, you know, a day or two a week to get out to go do something
else.  Not necessarily go back to work or something.  But, I do not know.

A.45:  Yeah.  I do not, I do not, you know, I just it, yeah, it is, it is strange
thing because people do. I mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go
out and just, who cares if it, if, if all your salary goes to pay somebody?
You sort of get away for a while too.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  We have, I do not, I do not, uh, it is strange, it is funny that I should
get this particular, we should be on this topic now.  Because, uh, because we
have, even though we have no kids, we have people staying with us.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49: Uh, for the, for the, for the, for the, the weekend.  And they have a six,
a six year old son and a three month old son.

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  So I am just sort of seeing what all the hassles are, you know of,

B.52:  [Laughter].  

A.53:  You know, like last night, we, we, we, the six year old decided he wanted
to go camping in the back yard.  So we pitched a tent in the back yard,
actually.  And his father and, and the little boy and I all went out and had,
you know, a, a b-, a boys' night out --

B.54:  Oh,  

A.55:  -- in the back yard.  

B.56:  really?  

A.57:  And about quarter of one, he woke up half crying and he could not sleep and
this and that.  I mean, w-, we wanted to bring him inside [laughter].  So one,
about, a, on-, one o'clock in the morning, we all got up and sort of wandered
inside.  So I am think-,

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  all the benefits of taking care of kids, or all the fun part of taking
care of kids, I guess.

B.60:  Yeah.  I tell you, it is, uh, yeah, maybe it is something before you start
having children.  You know, maybe there is a lot of stu-, stuff, uh, that you
will never have them if you start [laughter] doing all that.  Get too logical
about it.  But it is great, it is great having kids.  And then, uh, yeah, I
think everybody ought to, ought to try it.

A.61:  Yeah.  We plan on a couple of years.  And I suspect issues like child care
will become very important to my life then,

B.62:  Yeah,

A.63:  you know.

B.64:  yeah.  She will prob-, she will probably spend a lot more time finding
the right place.  Uh, I do not know, I, I tend to think if they are licensed,
then they are, you know, I do not know, I, you know, y-, you can f-, you get a
feel from it too.  If your child is too small you cannot, but if y-, if they
are old enough to, to know, you know, they will, they will let you know if
they are unhappy or, or if someone is not treating them well.  Or,

A.65:  Yeah.  That, that, that is probably true.  Although I, I do not, I do not,
like you say, I don't know if I would put a kid there who is less than, you
know, uh, four years old or something.

B.66:  I will tell you one thing, is that, my, of course I am, I am a single
parent, and so I guess, and, uh, my, my son was five and my daughter was two,
and I had, uh, they had to go in child care.  But, uh, but I think they were
more, uh, well I, uh, my sister who had two boys and she did not work, and sh-,
and she had a real difficult time when th-, it went time for them to go to
school.  They did not, uh, want to leave her.  And my children, who were so
used to being out, and, uh, learning how to get along with other children and
taking directions and stuff like that, they just went very smoothly off into
school, you know, without a problem.  So, uh, I think even if you do not leave
them full time, but have them, you know, preschool or mother's day out or
couple things, a couple of days a week or something like that, I think it is
always good.

A.67:  Yeah.  Probably just to make friends and,

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  and stuff like that.  

B.70:  So.  

A.71:  Yeah.  I, if, it is just like I say, this is a very foreign topic for me,
so [laughter],

B.72:  [Laughter].  

A.73:  One of those things I have to learn about.  I do, I work with kids a lot.

B.74:  You do?  

A.75:  I, I do work with kids a lot.  I, uh, I, I, do, uh, uh, I teach a karate
class twice a week --

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  -- with, with, with kids.

B.78:  Oh.  What age?

A.79:  Uh, they are four to seven.  Actually there is one at, I work mostly with
four to seven and then eight to twelve.  I, I am, I am the class
((supervisor)), so I, I help out in this class. And, uh, and it is, really,
um, weird.  Because I am not, you know, the fir-, when I first started doing
it, I, I can, put it this way, it, it has helped me gain lots of respect for
people who can work with lots, large numbers of kids.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Because when I first started like I had no idea how to, how to handle a
fi-, five year old kid.  Wi-, especially when there are ten of them floating
around, and you are supposed to be running around teaching them things.  And,

B.82:  Oh.

A.83:  of course,

B.84:  Uh, do they pa-, have, uh, their attention span, is it, do, do you have a
hard time holding their attention?

A.85:  Uh, I, I do, but I am finding there is, there is, uh, another person there
who has goo-, he has got absolutely no training from what I know, but he is
just wonderful with kids.  And he seems to know how to hold their attention,
you know.  He keeps them, she does lots of, you know, he is, he is, he is fast
moving with them.  They will do this exercise, and they will do that, they
will do this, they will do that.  He keeps them moving quick enough that, you
know, when they stop losing attention, they start, you know, they are, th-,
all of a sudden they are switched.

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  And, you know, there are a couple in there who actually have, uh, who I
think have attention deficit disorders or they have a very, very low
attention,

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  and those are harder to work with.  But, you know, but I, I, I, I, uh,
the regular ones, you know, the normal kids, you can just let them go a little
bit.  And, and, and he sort of, he is real good at keeping them in line.  And
I am learning from him how to do these sort of things just, just by watching
him.

B.90:  Did you say, uh, your karate class is all boys or mixed?

A.91:  No, it is, it is boys and girls.

B.92:  Is that right?

A.93:  It, it, it, it is mixed.  There are, uh, there are, uh, more boys than
girls.  But there are a number of, number of girls in there who actually, uh,
do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls.  I mean,

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  I mean, a lot of the little boys too.

B.96:  Why, why would a parent want their child to take karate?  Or is it the
child that wants to take it?  Uh,

A.97:  Uh, in some case, actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring
their kids because, because of the sort of discipline, you know.  And it is,
it is not, we do not, you know, say, "Get down and do a hundred push ups for
me now, you little guy."  But, uh, it teaches, we, we, we focus very highly
on, you know, on, on, on issues of respect and self-discipline and
self-confidence.  We have a lot of s-, kids who come in very shy, you know,
and unsure of themselves.  And, and you can see them come, you know, week by
week that they come more and more out of their shells and start to become, you
know, more sociable and --

B.98:  Um.

A.99:  -- more sure of themselves instead of more sure footed, you know.  Uh, and
the parents love it actually.  They find, you know, we, we, we, there are
rules.  Like the kids are not allowed, the kids have to bring in their report
card in, every, after every quarter or, or whenever they get their report
cards. They have to bring them in to make sure that they are keeping up with
their grades.
