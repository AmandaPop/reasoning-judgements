=============================================================================

A.1:  What are some of the things that you do with them?

B.2:  [TV] Well, my oldest son is eleven, and he is really into sports.  And my
little girl just started sports.  Anyway, my oldest son, he plays baseball
right now, and he's a pitcher on his team, and he's doing really well.  And we
go to all the ball games and everything.  And his dad's a scoutmaster, and so
he's a scout in the troop, and they spend a lot of troo-, time together doing
scouting things.

A.3:  Wow.

B.4:  Uh, my little girl, she's seven, and, and just got through with soccer, and
so we would, we'd have to split time, and my husband would go one place and
I'd go the other place, but we, one or the other would be at the games.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And then I have a four year old, and we spend time here at home.  I read to
him and things like that.  As a matter of fact, one thing our family does, is
we try to, uh, go to the library, and everybody gets books, and then I, we get
one book that we read together, like story at the end of the day, just before
they go to bed.  And then I have a brand new baby.

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  And, uh, she takes a lot of time, so I guess that's the time I spend with
her, feeding her, diapering her, you know, [laughter], all that kind of stuff
--

A.9:  #Oh, my.#

B.10:  -- #rocking her.#

A.11:  Well you have two boys and two girls, don't you?  Well, aren't you,

B.12:  Yeah, came out [baby] even.

A.13:  Yes.  Oh, well it sounds like, really sounds like you do wonderful
things.  Uh, in fact, uh,

B.14:  [Child].

A.15:  I don't know enough families who do what you're doing, now.

B.16:  A lot of families don't have that option.

A.17:  Well, um, I think a lot of families don't, but I think a lot of families do
and don't exercise it.

B.18:  Yeah, yeah.

A.19:  [Noise] {telephone line noise} Uh, sometimes I feel that acquiring things
becomes, uh, so important. And instead of, uh, just putting in your time in
those early years.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Uh, I, I've seen it quite a bit with, uh, as you can t-, probably know, I'm
[noise] {like plastic cup falling} older than you.  I have two only they're
both, uh, away from home.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And, uh, they, they engaged in the sports activities and it was interesting
though.  Our son really never wanted us to go.  We wanted to go --

B.24:  #Oh.#

A.25:  -- #because# we had moved around quite a bit, and that's a wonderful way to
meet friends, too, 

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  of the families.  But he was a little shy about our going.

B.28:  #Uh-huh.#

A.29:  #But we# did, maybe every other game.

B.30:  Well, I get up there and yell and everything.  [laughter] I'm a yeller.

A.31:  Yes.

B.32:  And my poor son, he says it's okay as long as I don't call him honey.
[baby] As long as I don't say, go, honey [laughter].

A.33:  Well, when you said he was a pitcher, I think, oh, gosh, that is so hard on
mothers.

B.34:  Well, it's, it's, um, tense.  Gets real #tense sometimes.#

A.35:  #Well being, uh,# and I think other people, uh, tend to not, uh, remember
that that is a child.

B.36:  Yeah, yeah.  It can be that way.  That's really true.  And you have to try
and remember that too, especially when they're littler.  This year we're kind
of on a winning #team.#

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  And, we, we beat a team rather profoundly and you can't help but feel bad.
But, we had our years when they were growing up that we were beaten real
soundly #too.#

A.39:  #Sure.#

B.40:  So, you know, uh, [lipsmack] I guess it's all in the age, and as you grow
up and you get better and, 

A.41:  And they should, they --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- need to have that, uh, feeling of accomplishment, also.  

B.44:  I think one thing, like you were saying, is we need to remember that it,
they're just kids --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- though.  This is not the pros or any big time thing.  We need to
remember they're children.

A.47:  Well, I had friends whose, uh, son played basketball.  And, uh, he was on a
team for two years and maybe got into, uh, two or three games, both, uh,
during the seasons for a minute or two.

B.48:  Oh, no.

A.49:  And I just think that that is so terrible --

B.50:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.51:  -- #it's# unbelievable.  I don't know how a coach could even do that.

B.52:  [Lipsmack] I know that here in Plano we have regular basketball and
that's what my child plays during the basketball season.  And
then they have what they call classic.  [noise]  And the best players play, and
the ones that are just barely new sit on the bench most of the
time.  They play a little bit.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Just like what you just said.  And, and I we just don't want our boy to do
that, you #know.#

A.55:  #No, no,# well, and I think after he gets older and if everybody knows
that, that, uh, they're willing to, when the son gets very good and they want
to get on one, a little bit more high powered team, then he can excel.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  Or if he wants to bid his, bide his time a little bit, sitting on the bench
until he comes of age, maybe another year or something.

B.58:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.59:  #But I think they# certainly have to know what kind of team they're
getting on.

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  Well, I love to hear about your reading, too.  So many mothers and fathers
don't, uh, uh, take their children to the library.  I used to have a
Bookmobile that came by our house.

B.62:  Oh, that's great.

A.63:  It was wonderful, and we could take as many books as we wanted to.

B.64:  Um {very faintly}.

A.65:  They didn't come but about every two weeks, and so, you know, you can go
through a lot of books, really.

B.66:  Well, that's a good amount --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- of time --

A.69:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.70:  -- two weeks.

A.71:  So it was just really wonderful, so.

B.72:  Oh, that sounds great.  You know, I used to read to them, and now my two
oldest can read to me every so often and that's really #been# --

A.73:  #Yes.#

B.74:  -- fun, too, that they #read to me.#

A.75:  #There was an# experiment here, well, I don't guess it was an experiment,
it was just a project in, uh, one of the schools here in Charlotte, one of the
elementary schools --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- uh, where the kids, uh, [lipsmack] didn't watch television for a couple
of weeks.

B.78:  #Uh-huh.#

A.79:  #And, uh, uh,# there was a lot of cooperation, I think, uh, among the
parents and children with this and many that they interviewed afterwards said,
no, they really didn't, didn't miss it.  They, they got kind of used to it,
and it was okay.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  So.

B.82:  Yeah.  And they say when you don't watch T V as much, you're more creative
and, and imaginative in your own mind of games to play and #things to do# --

A.83:  #Well of course.#

B.84:  -- instead of just being entertained --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- all #the time.#

A.87:  #Yeah, I# worry about the couch potato, uh,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Yes.

B.90:  Syndrome [laughter].

A.91:  Well Clarisse, it's been --

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- very enjoyable talking to you.

B.94:  Oh, Terry, I just appreciate you too.

A.95:  Oh, thank you so much.

B.96:  Thanks, have a good day.

A.97:  You too.  Bye.

B.98:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
