of the individual speakers.

=========================================================================

B.1:  [Throat_clearing]  Yeah, matter of fact, it's sort of interesting because
they do have drug testings at the company I work at. 

A.2:  They do, all right. 

B.3:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.4:  How do you feel about it?

B.5:  Uh, I don't know.  I was, uh, for the most part the people that it's
effected have not exactly been the most valuable employees, so I personally
think that, you know, it doesn't hurt the business center, the work atmosphere,
you know. 

A.6:  Uh-huh.  Are all employees, uh, subject to it or just a certain,

B.7:  Yeah, it's basically new employees. 

A.8:  New employees. 

B.9:  Yeah.  Um, existing employees are too, but they, for some reason they
don't, uh, uh, do anything about it.  You know, they don't, uh, exercise it.

A.10:  Yeah, what about random testing?

B.11:  They supposedly have it, but I've never heard of anybody getting randomly
tested. 

A.12:  What, what type of industry is it, Wayne? 

B.13:  Um, electrical engineer. 

A.14:  Electrical, okay. 

B.15:  Hold on for just a second. 

A.16:  Sure. 

B.17:  {Pause} My ninth month old just got hold of one of my three and a half inch
diskettes [laughter]. 

A.18:  [Laughter]. 

B.19:  I think, uh, that won't last very long.  Write protection just doesn't, uh,
doesn't have any eat protection on it. 

A.20:  I've, I've never been involved in a company that had the drug testing, but
have been involved in companies that have discussed it.  One of them, very
hazardous type of operation.  Drilling oil and gas wells. 

B.21:  Right. 

A.22:  And there's enough problem with injuries in that area anyway, uh, without
contributing to it through drugs or alcohol. 

B.23:  Yeah. 

A.24:  And, you know, it was encouraged.  It's just a matter of a lot of
businesses today I don't believe know how to implement a drug program.

B.25:  Uh-huh. 

A.26:  How to really, really have a good one, whether it's preemployment or
ongoing, either one. 

B.27:  Yeah, they, they, I think the way they figured out with us is basically
just they can globally say if anybody comes for, you know, an application,
white, black, educated, uneducated, everyone has to take it.

A.28:  Uh-huh. 

B.29:  And that way, you know, they're open.  Um, and I guess, you know, our
company has a fairly good turnover, so I guess they figure that they'll,

A.30:  # Eventually, #

B.31:  # get # the majority of employees that way. 

A.32:  have everyone.  Yeah, at least run a spot check.  And I think maybe the
knowledge that they could have random testing may have an effect, too. 

B.33:  Now I do know of two employees that were fired because they couldn't pass,
and I don't know exactly why they were picked out to do the drug testing,
because I know I wasn't. 

A.34:  Yeah. 

B.35:  But, um, that's right interesting. 

A.36:  I personally don't, it's easy to see in some industries, you know, you
don't want --

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  -- uh, bus drivers or pilots to be under the influence of drugs, and it's
easy to see that type.  But it can effect almost every, every office. 

B.39:  Oh yeah, yeah, ours is for security reasons.  We're government contractors,
and they don't want secrets leaking out. 

A.40:  Right, and, are, if you're government contractor, you probably fall under
some type of government supervision on it. 

B.41:  Right.  Yeah there are requirements, matter of fact, I think, levied upon
the company to have some sort of drug testing.  But, uh,

A.42:  Did, was there much objection to it prior to implementation or. 

B.43:  Oh, yeah.  There was a, a big thing saying that it was, you know, invading
people's rights and things like that. 

A.44:  Uh-huh. 

B.45:  You know, but,

A.46:  Which is,

B.47:  Then again it's against the law, so it's like, how can they, you know, be
invading your rights verifying that you've just been invading the law. 

A.48:  And people are confused, I think, too, by what is a test.  You, we all know
about the Olympics and the testing there and how some of them can be wrong. 

B.49:  Uh-huh. 

A.50:  Uh, I think they're afraid of {pause} appropriate prescription medication
showing up.  Some of them are, some of the innocent ones are. 

B.51:  Uh-huh. 

A.52:  And they,

B.53:  Well, they, you know, they said that, um, I don't know if it's ever been
proven for sure, but they were saying that some prescription drugs could show
up as being drugs but,

A.54:  I think they can. 

B.55:  Yeah. 

A.56:  And I think a lot of it, uh, that's,

B.57:  # As long as they give you another shot.# 

A.58:  # why the type of test is important.  #

B.59:  Yeah. 

A.60:  We tend not to know, we tend to think theoretically, but lots of times
getting down to the actual method and, and results being evaluated properly is
where we have a short fall. 

B.61:  Right. 

@@A.62:  Where are you located, Wayne?

B.63:  Um, Virginia. 

A.64:  In Virginia. 

B.65:  Uh-huh. 

A.66:  Okay. 

B.67:  Where are you calling from?

A.68:  North Carolina. 

B.69:  Oh, okay. 

A.70:  But I've been in, in Oklahoma for about twenty years.  So just got, kind of
got back to this part of this country.  Originally from Virginia. 

B.71:  Oh, okay, well, I'm, um, up near the capitol, up near D C. 

A.72:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, pretty, pretty time of the year up there now, isn't it. 

B.73:  Oh, yeah. 

A.74:  The cherry blossom festival apparently went all right. 

B.75:  Yeah, yeah, I missed it this year. 

A.76:  Did you. 

B.77:  But, uh, you know, we've, we've seen it a couple of times, and it's really
nice, but didn't get to see it this year.  There are so many things you take
for granted when you're in here, you know, year round, D C.

A.78:  Oh, yes.  Do you get to the Smithsonian?

B.79:  Yeah, every now and then we've been down there.  Haven't, uh, taken the
kids down yet though.  We, uh, took them to the White House for Easter Egg
roll.

A.80:  Oh, good, good.  But,

B.81:  And, uh, down in the mall for fireworks and things. 

A.82:  I think, that's one of the areas, uh, I've found several areas in the
government that I really enjoy seeing money spent, and the Smithsonian complex
is one of them.  I think it's great to go through there and see kids of all,
all sizes and ages going through those buildings there.

B.83:  My oldest is, uh, two.  So she's just getting to the age where, you know,
she'd recognize the whale and everything like that but. 

A.84:  Uh-huh, and it'll be a great memory for her later, too, I think. 

B.85:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.86:  Well, the, uh, time limit I think is, is about up, but I enjoyed talking to
you, Wayne. 

B.87:  Yeah, I did, too. 

A.88:  All right, thank you. 

B.89:  Thank you. 

A.90:  Bye. 

B.91:  Bye-bye.
