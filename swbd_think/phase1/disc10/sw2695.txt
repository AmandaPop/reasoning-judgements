============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  The, I guess the latest one that we've seen is, uh, AWAKENING.
With, uh,

B.2:  AWAKENING?

A.3:  Yeah. 

B.4:  # Well, I haven't # --

A.5:  # That's with, uh, #

B.6:  -- # heard of that one.  #

A.7:  # uh, oh, the guy that # plays Mork.  Uh, Robin Williams. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  And he played a terrific part in that. 

B.10:  Huh. 

A.11:  But, uh, that's one of the better ones we've seen in, in the last, oh, I
guess, the last six months. 

B.12:  Yeah.  We just saw, uh, FLATLINERS last night. 

A.13:  FLATLINERS?

B.14:  That was really good. 

A.15:  I wa-, I never did get to see that. 

B.16:  Oh, that's a good movie. 

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  It's got some,

A.19:  This, uh, AWAKENING I think is, is something along the same lines. 

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  It's, uh, about a doctor, uh, and it's a true story. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  Uh, there was a bunch of people that were, uh, they, first of all, they,
they thought they had Parkin-, Parkinson's disease. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  They would tr-, first start trembling [noise] {sounds like the tinkling of
glass} real bad, but then they would just g-, almost go into a coma. 

B.26:  Huh. 

A.27:  And, uh, they, they could tell that they were res-, that they could hear
you. 

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # But # it was just a blank stare you got, and they were just almost frozen
in, in, in a position. 

B.30:  Uh. 

A.31:  And they tried some, uh, tried some drugs, and then all of a sudden that
one summer, uh, the drug that they gave them brought them out of their coma.

B.32:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.33:  # And # that's where they got the word awakening. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  But then they lapsed back into the coma. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  But, uh, and Robert Di Niro played the, uh, played I guess, uh, the co-lead
part.  He was one of the ones that were in a coma. 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  When did this movie come out?

A.39:  Oh, it's been out I guess now for, or a month and a half or something like
that. 

B.40:  Huh.  I haven't heard about that one. 

A.41:  But if you get a chance, see it.  I also want to see, uh, that, uh,
SLEEPING WITH THE ENE-, or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

B.42:  Oh, that's --

A.43:  Well, I,

B.44:  -- a great a movie, yeah.  We --

A.45:  I've heard --

B.46:  -- went to see that. 

A.47:  -- that's good. 

B.48:  Oh, that's awesome. 

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  Yeah.  If you don't, [laughter]  you don't mind the, uh, the gross parts of
it. 

A.51:  Yeah.  Well, I heard it's not really that,

B.52:  # Yeah.  #

A.53:  # that, # uh, gross. 

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  It's not like FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH or --

B.56:  Oh, yeah. 

A.57:  -- something like that,

B.58:  Just the subtle kind of stuff [laughter]  though. 

A.59:  Yeah,

B.60:  # Yeah.  #

A.61:  # yeah.  #

B.62:  It, uh, FLATLINERS is a real good movie too. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  I recommend renting that.  It's got some, uh, interesting things about it. 
Because, you know, you know what the plot is basically?

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  That they --

A.67:  But then they --

B.68:  -- kill themselves --

A.69:  -- they're trying --

B.70:  -- and come back. 

A.71:  -- to experience, uh, life after death. 

B.72:  Yeah.  And then when they come back, all sorts of s-, strange things start
happening to them. 

A.73:  Yeah.  We don't see as many movies as we used to. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  Uh, we got a V C R, so we go to Blockbuster Video place and rent the
movies. 

B.76:  Yeah, that's what I, I just did today.  I got, uh, DARKMAN.  Have you seen
that?

A.77:  Huh-uh. 

B.78:  No.  I, I haven't.  I'll guess I'll watch it tonight. 

A.79:  Yeah.  There was another good movie that Robin Williams played in, uh, that
really surprised me.  It was, uh, DEAD POETS SOCIETY. 

B.80:  Oh, yeah.  I liked that one.  That was good. 

A.81:  Uh, but it, uh, it's not typical Robin Williams.  I, you know, I expected
some comedy or something like that.  But he,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # he's # a good dramatic ac-, actor when he wants to be. 

B.84:  Um, yep.  So what other movies have you rented recently?

A.85:  Uh, that AWAKENING I guess is the last movie we've been to in a couple
months. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  Like I say, we, we, uh, our son, one of our sons gave us for Christmas some
Blockbuster, uh, gift certificates. 

B.88:  Huh. 

A.89:  And, uh, we just go up and find some old movies that we haven't seen. 

B.90:  Yeah. 

A.91:  Uh, some of the old classics. 

B.92:  What kind --

A.93:  Uh, some,

B.94:  -- # of movies # -- 

A.95:  # some, some of the, #

B.96:  -- # are you into most? #

A.97:  # like the, uh, Aga-, Agatha # Christie,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # uh, # movies.  MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS,

B.100:  # Yeah.  That's a good one.  #

A.101:  # and some of the others.  # Course the new releases, they're, I don't know
what the rule is now, but I think they had, I don't know if it's a year or what
before they put them on a V C R,

B.102:  # Yeah.  #

A.103:  # so # you can rent them. 

B.104:  It's about a year. 

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  Actually, I just, uh, they just put one out that's only been out for, uh, a
half a year it seems.  

A.107:  Yeah.  But there's a couple out that I wou-, I'd like to see.  I want to
see that the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  I want to see, uh, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. 

B.110:  Yeah.  I haven't seen that. 

A.111:  And, uh, I can't remember some of the others.  Oh, we went and rented, uh,
FIELD OF DREAMS. 

B.112:  Yeah. 

A.113:  Have you seen that one?

B.114:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.115:  Yeah.  That was good.  Kevin Costner. 

B.116:  Yeah.  It was okay [laughter]. 

A.117:  But, uh,

B.118:  I'm not much into baseball [laughter]. 

A.119:  Yeah.  I like nature movies too.  I like, used to be, uh, Walt Disney would
put out what they called true life adventures. 

B.120:  Yeah.  Like, like have you seen THE BEAR?

A.121:  Yeah, I saw THE BEAR.  That was good. 

B.122:  That's pretty good.  When the bear comes up and attacks them [laughter]. 

A.123:  Yeah. 

B.124:  Scares the hell out of them. 

A.125:  Yeah.  But some of the old ones that he put out like, uh, THE LIVING
DESERT,

B.126:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.127:  # and, # uh, oh, there were several.  I can't remember them all.  But he
would the show the animals and everything that live in a particular region or
whatever. 

B.128:  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  I remember he done one on the desert and he done one on the prairie.  Uh,
but I, I like the true life adventures. 

B.130:  Um.  Yeah.  So does my girlfriend [laughter]. 

A.131:  Yeah. 

B.132:  She's, she's, um,

A.133:  # I'm not, #

B.134:  # a veterinarian.  #

A.135:  I'm not much for the, for the gory FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTHS and, and
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and all that other stuff.

B.136:  Yeah [laughter].  That's what my sisters like. 

A.137:  Huh.  Now,

B.138:  # Yeah.  I, #

A.139:  # I do # like a good mystery, you --

B.140:  Yeah. 

A.141:  -- know, like PSYCHO or something like that. 

B.142:  Uh-huh. 

A.143:  But not the gory where they just, all they show is blood and guts. 

B.144:  Yeah. 

A.145:  I never did see that, uh, one that won, uh, so many Academy Awards.  That,
uh, the one Kevin Costn-, Costner directed and starred in. 

B.146:  Which one was that? Uh,

A.147:  Uh, about the Indians. 

B.148:  The wolves? Oh, yeah. 

A.149:  Uh, DANCE WITH WOLVES --

B.150:  Yeah, that's --

A.151:  -- # or something like that.  #

B.152:  -- # pretty good.  That's a # very good movie. 

A.153:  I didn't see that.  I've heard some people say it's good and some people
say it's, they didn't like it.

B.154:  Yeah. 

A.155:  Course, I guess you, you can get that on any kind of movie you see. 

B.156:  Uh-huh.  It's a long movie though [laughter]. 

A.157:  Yeah.  I heard it's over three hours long.  But, uh, plus movies cost so
much now unless you go to the early movie. 

B.158:  Yeah.  That's true. 

A.159:  Down here, I don't know what costs you up there, but down here, man and
wife, you're going to spend, if you, for your tickets and any popcorn and cold
drink, you're going to spend close to fifteen dollars. 

B.160:  That's about what it is here too.  Those three dollar drinks [laughter]. 

A.161:  Yeah. 

B.162:  Three dollar popcorn. 

A.163:  And they're awfully small too. 

B.164:  Yeah. 

A.165:  And, uh, it used to be the candy counter and stuff would have the small
bars, but now all they have is the big old family --

B.166:  Oh, yeah. 

A.167:  -- size bars.  So,

B.168:  Yeah, I just got some free passes for movies because I'm graduating. 

A.169:  Yeah. 

B.170:  So, I can use those. 

A.171:  Where, where are you attending school?

B.172:  N C State. 

A.173:  N C State?

B.174:  Yeah.  Graduating in computer science. 

A.175:  How did you all do in basketball this year?

B.176:  Oh, we did pretty good. 

A.177:  Yeah. 

B.178:  Yeah. 

A.179:  You all usually always have a good basketball team. 

B.180:  Yeah.  Next year we're not [laughter] going to have anybody though because
all our seniors are leaving.

A.181:  Well, this is football country down here. 

B.182:  Yeah. 

A.183:  Although Arkansas had a pretty good basketball team. 

B.184:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Yeah [laughter],  as always. 

A.185:  Well,

B.186:  Well,

A.187:  I was trying to think of something else.  I, I do miss, uh, I'm, I'm
fifty-seven years old --

B.188:  Uh-huh. 

A.189:  -- and you don't sound like you're that old. 

B.190:  No [laughter], 

A.191:  # [Laughter].  #

B.192:  # twenty-two.  #

A.193:  But, uh, I remember when I was a ki-, kid and you'd go to the movies.  And
you got to see a movie and usually a double feature. 

B.194:  Uh-huh. 

A.195:  You got to see a newsreel,

B.196:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.197:  # and # usually a serial like FLASH GORDON or, or, uh, ZORRO or something
like that line,

B.198:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.199:  # and # then a cartoon. 

B.200:  [Laughter]. 

A.201:  At least one cartoon, sometimes two cartoons. 

B.202:  Yeah. 

A.203:  And you could spend almost all afternoon at the movie, just watching movies
--

B.204:  Yeah. 

A.205:  -- and other stuff.  But now it, it's the movie and the previews and that's
about it. 

B.206:  And the ads [laughter]. 

A.207:  And the ads. 

B.208:  Throw a coke ad in there. 

A.209:  Yeah.  But a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the
cartoons and the serial.

B.210:  Uh-huh. 

A.211:  Because you always wondered, uh, how can the guy get out of this, you know.

B.212:  [Laughter]. 

A.213:  And then the next,

B.214:  Cliff hanger. 

A.215:  Yeah.  Cliff hangers, and the next week you'd find out how he got out of
it. 

B.216:  And into something else [laughter]. 

A.217:  Yeah. 

B.218:  [Laughter]. 

A.219:  # But, uh, #

B.220:  # Well, okay.  #

A.221:  Well, I enjoyed talking with you. 

B.222:  All right. 

A.223:  And good luck in your schooling. 

B.224:  Yeah. 

A.225:  Okay.  Have a good day. 

B.226:  All right, bye. 

A.227:  Bye-bye.
