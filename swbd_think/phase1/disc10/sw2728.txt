B.1:  Okay. 

A.2:  Is this one of your favorite topics?

@B.3:  Well, I love to fish.  I haven't in the last few years,

A.4:  # Yeah.  #

B.5:  # but, # in fact, when I married, on our honeymoon that's where we went was
fishing. 

A.6:  Oh my, my, my son would love to find a woman like that I think [laughter]. 

B.7:  [Laughter]  Well, i-, I really do enjoy it but I, like I say I haven't been
for years.  We u-, when, after we got married, a couple of years after we got
married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot, and includ-, no we skied too
but after the kids came we stopped #you know.# 

A.8:  #Yeah.# 

B.9:  #Now I am divorced so,#

A.10:  #They have, they have a way#  of influencing #your life.# 

B.11:  #Yeah, they don't,#  you know, especially when they're little like that it
was difficult to have them in the boat, we were always worried something would
happen so we didn't,

A.12:  What type, what type of fishing did you enjoy?

B.13:  Well I liked trolling the best. 

A.14:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.15:  # I, # I mean I like moving so instead of just sitting in one spot and I
really do like to fish in the rain. 

A.16:  Oh, is that right?

B.17:  Yeah, I, when it's not pouring,

A.18:  # Oh.  #

B.19:  # I # mean, but when it's just a light rain I'm, I really enjoy that and I
find that you, we use to catch a lot of fish when it was raining. 

A.20:  Yeah.  Do, do you like cartoons?

B.21:  Do, pardon me? Say that a-,

A.22:  Cartoons. 

B.23:  Cartoons?

A.24:  Yes. 

B.25:  Yes. 

A.26:  One of my favorite cartoons is a picture of a, a fellow in a pouring, a
downpour, raining oh, the boat is half full of water, there are beer cans
floating all around and th-, the line is in the boat with him and he's got the
biggest grin on his face you've ever seen [laughter]. 

B.27:  [Laughter]  Oh gosh.  I don't know whether I'd go that far [laughter]. 

A.28:  No [laughter].  So when you say you're enjoying the rain that, uh, you must
be in warm weather climate then. 

B.29:  Well, see the thing is when, when, I, I am from, originally from Ohio,

A.30:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.31:  # and # I met my husband in Iowa and we, he was from Minnesota and we went
on our honeymoon to Minnesota,

A.32:  # Oh.  #

B.33:  # so, # it was, well it was in August and so it was warm enough but, uh, I,
cause I don't enjoy cold weather at all [laughter] so we, uh, we lived right
by a lake and it was nice.

A.34:  Yeah.  Have you ever done any, uh, ocean fishing?

B.35:  No ,

A.36:  # No? #

B.37:  # I # have not.  I lived in the Bahamas for a year,

A.38:  # Oh.  #

B.39:  # but # I didn't do any fishing.  We did some scuba diving but that's all. 

A.40:  That, that's a nice sport too I think. 

B.41:  Yeah. 

A.42:  Beautiful sights and,

B.43:  It's, it's gorgeous. 

A.44:  Now the only offshore fishing I've done is from the Bahamas and caught a
nice big barracuda. 

B.45:  Ooh, how nice. 

A.46:  Yeah, yeah, interesting, interesting time.  I've, I've been in the Great
Lakes too and caught some salmon there,

B.47:  Uh-huh. 

A.48:  but I really enjoy farm pond fishing,

B.49:  # Oh.  #

A.50:  # probably # as, as much as anything. 

B.51:  I've never fished in a farm pond. 

A.52:  Oh.  You, you can get out and, it, a fairly large pond with a lot of stumps
and everything, good black bass fishing. 

B.53:  Um.  Um. 

A.54:  And I enjoy walking around the edge and trying to select a spot, I've even
done some, uh, tube fishing.  Are you familiar with that?

B.55:  No, huh-uh. 

A.56:  That's an inner tube with a special seat in it,

B.57:  # Ooh.  #

A.58:  # and # you wear waders and you have little fins that you kick around so
you move, manipulate yourself anywhere you want in a pond.

B.59:  Oh, how wonderful. 

A.60:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun. 

B.61:  [Laughter]  Relaxing too, huh?

A.62:  [Laughter]  It is and cooling. 

B.63:  Oh, that sounds great. 

A.64:  You know the, the, uh, water below helps keep you cool.  You may be baked
in the sun in the upper half of your body,

B.65:  # [Laughter].  #

A.66:  # but, # uh, it's, it's a nice relaxing way and gentle,

B.67:  # Oh.  #

A.68:  # undulations # of the water, you know, it, it is nice I think. 

B.69:  Oh, it sounds wonderful. 

A.70:  But fishing is a good, relaxing sport.  If you, if you don't have patience
I don't know if you would enjoy fishing because,

B.71:  # No.  #

A.72:  # you, #

B.73:  I, I know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be
moving all the time,

A.74:  # Yeah.  #

B.75:  # I # think you have to be able to sit an, and just enjoy yourself quietly.
If you can't do that you're not to make a good fisherman.

A.76:  No and I think that's part of the lure is, is just to be, uh, relaxed and
with the world and,

B.77:  # Right.  #

A.78:  # no # pressure, not, not worrying about whether you catch anything or not.

B.79:  Well, in this day and age that's wonderful to be able to do that
[laughter],

A.80:  # [Laughter].  #

B.81:  # because # our lives are so stressful so. 

A.82:  Do your children fish?

B.83:  Well, real sad to say we don't as much as we, I'm divorced and, and, uh,
since we've been to Texas we haven't. 

A.84:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.85:  # Now # in Iowa when they were little, my son I used to take him fishing
and they both have, you know, gear and we've, we've gone once or twice but
they, there's just not that many lakes around here that I'd be interested in,
in going to,

A.86:  # No, no, #

B.87:  # and so, # you know, and I just, uh, we just haven't and not that they, I
think they both wou-, would like it.  They have gone with their dad and, uh,
he lives in Arizona now and, uh, he lives in the Phoenix area and the
mountains are real close and he's taken them up to the mountains and,

A.88:  # Trout fishing.# 

B.89:  # yeah.  #

A.90:  Yeah, that's fun too. 

B.91:  Yeah and they've enjoyed it. 

A.92:  It, it's a challenge to learn to use the different equipment.  A fly rod,

B.93:  # It is.  #

A.94:  # entirely different # technique. 

B.95:  # Yes.  #

A.96:  # And # I'm always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that
small [laughter]. 

B.97:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Isn't that, that is amazing isn't it. 

A.98:  Yeah.  They,

B.99:  Well I can remember when I was trolling, I caught, and we couldn't eat
this, it was a, a Rock Bass and, of course, they're not good to eat but I
mean, it was, it was for me, it was like a six pound fish and that was big for
me and,

A.100:  # Oh yeah.  #

B.101:  # I was # just tickled to death that, to catch it.  We threw it back in but
uh, that, was, I think, the biggest fish I've ever caught. 

A.102:  Well, you know, in Virginia, well they do, they do eat the Rock Bass
though. 

B.103:  Well we do-, in Minnesota people just don't, they don't eat them,

A.104:  # Yeah.  #

B.105:  # for # some reason, so. 

A.106:  I think if they, if they cut around that red streak,

B.107:  # Oh.  #

A.108:  # in # it then you're in good shape. 

B.109:  Is that right?

A.110:  Uh-huh. 

B.111:  See we didn't know that so we just threw it back in so. 

A.112:  Well, that's a hybrid, right? It's a salt water #that migrated into the
fresh.# 

B.113:  #Yes it is#  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.114:  Yeah.

B.115:  Yeah. 

A.116:  And that, it was a big thing they call Stripers in Oklahoma. 

B.117:  Oh. 

A.118:  And Rock Fish, I know, in Virginia,

B.119:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.120:  # and, # uh, probably up, up there too then. 

B.121:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.122:  Have you ever done any surf casting?

B.123:  No. 

A.124:  That's fun. 

B.125:  Is it?

A.126:  Uh-huh.  I could stand all day on the surf and you just have a lot of
weight on the end of it and you're fighting the undertow so there's some
action going on whether it's the fish or not all the time,

B.127:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.128:  # and # that's, uh, a relaxing time too. 

B.129:  Would you have to repeatedly cast though in the,

A.130:  No, uh-huh,

B.131:  # No? #

A.132:  # no.  # The secret is to cast just over the break of the wave and then the
undertow keeps the line moving outward in, you know, it stays there for the,
uh, flounder or, or some of the other special fish too.

B.133:  Oh. 

A.134:  It's good, good exercise too. 

B.135:  Oh, that sounds great. 

A.136:  Yeah.  What,

B.137:  When I grew up, when I was growing up, my dad was an avid fisher, fisherman
and we had a boat and we would go out in Lake Erie, because I'm from Ohio, and
we would fish.  That was before it was so polluted,

A.138:  # Oh yeah.  #

B.139:  # and so # yucky, it was a beautiful lake then and, uh, we would, we would
fish and, and my dad would, I can remember even when were, in-, weren't
interested when we were younger, and we would play around the, the lake or
around and we'd go up into Michigan and the rapids up there in Grand Rapids,
Michigan were just beautiful and he would fish.  He would get his, you know,
his waders on,

A.140:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.141:  # his # long boots and he would go out and we would just play by the water
and just have a ball and he would fish and it was so gorgeous,

A.142:  # (( )). #

B.143:  # and that # was one of my wonderful childhood memories. 

A.144:  I hope, uh, that the future generations have places they can go. 

B.145:  Yeah, isn't that scary?

A.146:  It is, it is,

B.147:  # Yeah.  #

A.148:  # with # all the pollution that we do have. 

B.149:  Yeah, it, it's bad.  Lake Erie when, I haven't been home for several years
but the last time I was home I was just so surprised to see how terrible Lake
Erie was, I mean it just was awful. 

A.150:  Um. 

B.151:  And it just makes you so sad because at one time it was just a beautiful
lake,

A.152:  # Yeah.  #

B.153:  # and # not too long ago, really. 

A.154:  # Right.  #

B.155:  # but, #

A.156:  But Sally, it's been nice talking to you and I,

B.157:  #It sure has.#

A.158:  #hope you get to#  go fishing soon. 

B.159:  Well thank you. 

A.160:  [Laughter]. 

B.161:  And you have many good fishing days too. 

A.162:  ((Thanks)). Good night. 

B.163:  Bye, night.  Bye-bye.
