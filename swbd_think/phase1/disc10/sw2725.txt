@A.1:  Okay, what do you think are the most si-, significant changes women have
taken a role in?

B.2:  Oh, God, um,

A.3:  # [Laughter].  #

B.4:  # that's # hard, I, I suspect there's, I, I don't even know, um,

A.5:  # I, I to me,#

B.6:  # virtually everything.  #

A.7:  yeah, well, uh, to me the biggest significant thing I've noticed is women
are becoming mayors of big cities more, and more, seems like, especially in the
south. 

B.8:  Um, yeah, tha-, tha-, tha-, that, I, I go-, I didn't know that much
actually, that, that, it, it, it's happening a lot?

A.9:  Oh yeah, Dallas has one, Houston has, a fa-, as a matter of fact the mayor
of Houston is the highest paid mayor in the United States. 

B.10:  [Beep]  {line} [noise]  And, and, and she's a woman. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  (( )) oh really. 

A.13:  Yeah and,

B.14:  Who is that?

A.15:  Uh, the mayor of Houston. 

B.16:  Right, wha-, wha-, wha-, what's her name?

A.17:  Oh, gosh, I can't remember what her name is. 

B.18:  Oh, the only Texas politician that I actually know is, is a woman is Ann
Richards. 

A.19:  Okay, our governor, yes. 

B.20:  Yeah, who, who to me is just, um, I, I had heard very little about her
before,

A.21:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.22:  # but, # um, I saw her speak at the, uh, I guess it was the eighty,

A.23:  # Democratic convention thing, yeah.  #

B.24:  # ye-, the eighty-six, no # the eighty-eighth, convention, whatever,

A.25:  # Well, I, uh, #

B.26:  # and I was # just, I feel in love with her. 

A.27:  m-, most of the, the larger cities like Dallas has a woman mayor, San
Antonio has a woman mayor, Houston has (( )), uh, woman mayor, so that to me
has been the biggest jump I think, that I've noticed, uh, women are, they're
getting in politics a lot more than, uh, they were years ago, or they're mor-,
a little be more accep-, I still think they're have a hard time getting in
because they don't have the money to spend on campaigning like the men do, for
some reason.

B.28:  Yeah, that's true, I think that there's, but that, I think that will come
with time, with, um,

A.29:  # Yeah, I do too.  #

B.30:  # more, mo-, more, more # PAC -s and so forth being interested in them.

A.31:  An, I, I'm still, I guess I'm kind of chauvinistic, I still, I still prefer
men doctors and men lawyers but, you know, that's just me, yeah. 

B.32:  # Oh really.  Why is that? #

A.33:  # I don't know, I just # have more confidence in them, for some reason. 

B.34:  That's interesting.  I, um, no, I'm, I'm, I'm probably partial to, uh, I
mean I, I think that there, there are certain jobs that men, I mean, I'm not
se-, I don-, I don't mean to be sexist here but I think there are certain jobs
like ((minister)),

A.35:  # Oh, I do too.  #

B.36:  # I think probably, probably # women are better gynecologists than me-,

A.37:  # Right, but, yeah, absolutely, #

B.38:  # and I think, you # know, men are possibly better. 

A.39:  maybe pediatricians even. 

B.40:  Ye-, maybe pediatricians, although that I, I could split on, I, I think I
have some,

A.41:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.42:  # I know # some good males.  But there are some things I just think you
know that,

A.43:  But I get irritated when I hear a man telephone operator.  I don't like men
telephone operators, I expect women.  I grew up with women telephone operators
and that's what I want to hear. 

B.44:  Uh, now that's interesting.  Yes. 

A.45:  And I don't, uh, I don't like to see women truck drivers,

B.46:  # Um.  #

A.47:  # and # I think, you know, if women want to go into combat, go, you know,
if they're that stupid, they want to do it, go ahead and go on, I don't care.

B.48:  Right, anybody who wants to go into combat, I get to that point, uh. 

A.49:  Yeah, yeah, in fact, go he-, right ahead, sister, if th-, if you're going
to get out there and want to go, I'm, you know,

B.50:  # Go ahead and have fun, yeah.  #

A.51:  # I'm all for it [laughter].  I'm # not going to stop you. 

B.52:  I'm, I'm, no, yeah, there are some that I, there are some jobs like, for
instance I get a little bit annoyed when I see people saying, um, that they
should, you know, there was an issue a while ago in New York where they were
going to lower the standards for firemen,

A.53:  # Oh, huh.  So women could be, #

B.54:  # because they, so women could be # firem-,

A.55:  See, I don't believe in that either. 

B.56:  Right and I might think if you're going to lower the standards, you know,
you're, you're just,

A.57:  # That's right.  #

B.58:  # what, what, # what, what good is a fireman who can't pick me up. 

A.59:  That's right, absolutely, I agree, I agree an,

B.60:  But as for other stuff, I think, I had no idea about the politics and I, I,
I think that's wonderful, I mean. 

A.61:  Yeah, I, I think, and I've read, you know, all the magazines have an
article on it, women's magazines, course you probably wouldn't be reading, but
I do, bu-, and it says that, that women a-, are, uh, they're not as quick to
make a, a decision, you know, they study the, the cases more before they
decide on something than men do.  Men are a little more anx-, they'll, they'll
make a quicker decision than a women, women will,

B.62:  # Yeah, we're very impatient.  #

A.63:  # yeah, women will study # it a little bit more before they, uh, come right
out and, uh,

B.64:  Well that's probably better, I suspect,

A.65:  # Yeah, it is.  #

B.66:  # as a general # rule, I, I don't know why this is but I suspect it's
probably the case that women are po-, are, are, are more honest politicians. 

A.67:  Yeah, I think so too, I really do. 

B.68:  I mean, it, it, it may be because there's an old boy network. 

A.69:  Yeah, and I don't think they're motivated by greed as much as men are.

B.70:  That's true. 

A.71:  They probably have a comfortable home with their husb-, you know, if
they're that high, they'll probably, you know, and so, and I think men are
motivated by, a lot of them, in politics, to me, by greed, and, uh, like you
said a good, good old boy system is, a-, is rampant in almost every state.

B.72:  Ever-, ever-, ever-, any, anywhere you go basically there, there's,
there's,

A.73:  Anywhere you go you've got it, even in the police department, every place
else, you know.  I, I don't mind seeing women policeman too much, if they're
accompanied with a man policeman.  I don't like to see women out on their own,
you know. 

B.74:  Well, yeah, I guess, although there are some women who honestly, if they
were, uh,

A.75:  # I know they could, #

B.76:  # I, I'd go running # if they were cha-, chasing, chasing me. 

A.77:  I would too, [laughter]  yeah, I would too, I, (( )),

B.78:  But, but you are right, I think there are some, I, I think that, you know,
more often than not, I'd be, you know, I mean, the-, there, there are still
biological differences, that I think lots of people forget. 

A.79:  Absolutely, and I get to see, I'm always, have been irritated when, uh,
girls want to play football.  I don't think girls should play fo-, I'm sorry,
it's too, uh, the women are built different, they just don't need to be banged
around like that, and the parents that get out there and demand that their
daughter play football because she wants to, it just, I just can't believe it,
I wouldn't do that to my daughter.  I don't think girls should play football,
I just don't.

B.80:  Um, I'm probably of, of, of the opin-, I, I never had that situation, so
I'm probably of the opinion that, uh, that well, if they really want to, I
guess maybe they should, but, I'd (( )) I'd sort of look at it and go, well,
are you really sure you want to do this? I mean [talking] [TV],

A.81:  Well, you know, it's just not very feminine, of course, I, I'm a femi-, I,
I'm not a feminist.  I, I like being feminine. 

B.82:  # Yeah.  #

A.83:  # I # don't want to, I don't want to be equal to the man, and do the, you
know, do everything they do and get everything.  I think, I agree, equal pay
for equal work.

B.84:  # Right.  #

A.85:  # If # the women does the same, she ought to get paid the same (( )) and
that's, that probably is my biggest complaint about woman's role is they don't,

B.86:  # Even today.  #

A.87:  # they are # not pai-, absolutely, they're not paid equal to what men are
and for so-, I don't know if they'll ever, there's a, a handful of women that
are, a handful, but I don't know if in my lifetime if I'll ever see it equal. 

B.88:  Uh-huh. 

A.89:  But, uh, you know, I, you never know. 

B.90:  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm sort of like that.  I believe in equal but different. 

A.91:  Yes, yeah. 

B.92:  I mean there, there are differences and people just have to sort of realize
that there are differences and,

A.93:  # I know, and I th-, #

B.94:  # work from there and figure # it out, you know. 

A.95:  But, you know, so many people don't want to th-, think like that, they just
think, you know, equal and that's it.  They don't take any, in to account
differences or anything and I just, there are differences, whether we like it
or not, there are differences and they, uh.  But I, the women politicians that
I've known, or not, not personally known, but I've se-, you know, seen and the
politics, I have really liked their, uh, fair and, uh, knowledgeable and, I, I
just, I like women politicians for some reason.

B.96:  We-, you mean ever-, they're, they're everything a politician should be. 

A.97:  Yeah, right, I think they set an example that the men ought to follow, but,
but, I obviously, they're no-, and it, and it's a shame that there aren't more
and then they, they make it so tough, you know, because it takes a lot of
money to run and most these women don't have the money to, to run.

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # And # I guess have a hard time getting backing, you know, somebody
probably doesn't, you know, the men won't,

B.100:  Until women are, are better represented in politics, I think is one of the
(( )), but. 

A.101:  Yeah, yeah, and I don't think in my lifetime, I'll see a woman president,
or even vice president.

B.102:  Yeah, almost. 

A.103:  Oh, came close. 

B.104:  Almost, cam-, well not, not, not so close, but, uh,

A.105:  But now I didn't even, I didn't even vote for Ann Richards, though, even
though she's a woman, I didn't vote for her.

B.106:  Oh really. 

A.107:  No, I, I,

B.108:  I don-, I don't know anything about her politics, I just saw her and saw
her give this wonderful speech.

A.109:  Well we really didn't have a whole lot to chose from down here, but
[laughter], in our governors race, but, I, I'm a Republican and I ju-, I voted
for the party and you know, she was Democratic an, and she's really having a
rough time, I, all ready, you know, she's,

B.110:  Is she. 

A.111:  Uh, yeah, they, you know, giving her, she's trying to straighten up the
insurance board, which is, you know, [laughter]  a bigger task than anybody has
a right to try and tackle and,

B.112:  # [Laughter].  #

A.113:  # oh, # she'll probably not make it, I'm sure, but. 

B.114:  Oh, well, well. 

A.115:  Anyway. 

B.116:  Well, I guess it was good while it lasted for her,

A.117:  # Yeah.  #

B.118:  # you # know, I don't know what to say about that [laughter]. 

A.119:  Do you all have many women politicians up there?

B.120:  Uh, there, there are some act-, now that I think of it there are some, um,
we don't have like the mayors and, and, and the governor. 

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  The governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, you know,

A.123:  # Oh yes, yes.  #

B.124:  # if ever there # was an old Italian, you know, pa-, part of the old boy
network, Mario Cuomo, I suspect but,

A.125:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Now he's still the governor, Cuomo is?

B.126:  Yes, he's still the governor, um,

A.127:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.128:  # and still # they're desperately trying to talk him into running for
president. 

A.129:  Oh, are they really?

B.130:  Oh yes, they, they keep, his name always pops up an, for, for, for the
Democratic nomination.  Because I think if he would actually take the
nomination, he's one of the only Democrats I know that could actually possibly
do it at some point. 

A.131:  Really? Um. 

B.132:  But, um, as for, as for the rest of, we have, we have some senators and,
and, and representatives and so forth, but that's probably about all. 

A.133:  Oh really. 

B.134:  I don't, I don't know that we have that many women politicians around here.

A.135:  Oh. 

B.136:  I guess New York is still, still behind the times, not like,

A.137:  # Oh [laughter].  #

B.138:  # you Texans # are way up there. 

A.139:  Well they do have a uni-, and most of our suburbs ha-, um, they're fairly
large suburbs, they have, uh, mostly women mayors also. 

B.140:  Really?

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  That's really, cause I don't even, I couldn't think of a woman mayor, that
I'd ever known (( )).

A.143:  Really? Well now see, uh, th-, the, the difference in Houston and Dallas,
Dallas is, uh, let me see, Dallas is really run by the city manager and the
mayor is just kind of a, you know, not a really, but now Houston's, its mayor,
se-, uh, mayor, what's the other way they go, the city counc-, I mean, uh,
{pause} oh, what is that, gu-, I'm trying to think, uh, something manager. 

B.144:  # Some sort of, uh, county mayor? #

A.145:  # Like a city manager, he really # runs the town. 

B.146:  Well, yeah, okay. 

A.147:  And, but now in Houston, she actually does the firing. 

B.148:  She does the actual running?

A.149:  Yeah, she does the running down there and that's why she makes more money
than the mayor of New York, the mayor of Los Angeles,

B.150:  # Wow.  #

A.151:  # uh, # uh, she makes a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year. 

B.152:  Wow, that, that, that is a lot for a mayor, that's great. 

A.153:  Yeah, yeah, so, sh-,

B.154:  Well, I guess, I guess if, if she deserves it, I mean. 

A.155:  Yeah she also brought uh, um, chief of police as a woman down there also. 

B.156:  Now that's strange. 

A.157:  Yeah it is. 

B.158:  I, I didn't know, that, that seems like quite an improvement, I mean or,
quite a, quite a significant jump for, uh,

A.159:  Yes, yes and she just made that change,
