===========================================================================

A.1:  [Music]  Okay.  Um, what area do you, are you in?

B.2:  Okay. 

A.3:  What area of the country?

B.4:  Uh, I'm in southwest Houston. 

A.5:  Oh, in Houston?

B.6:  Uh-huh, what,

A.7:  Okay.  I'm up in Plano, near Dallas. 

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  Do you live in a suburb or [noise]. 

B.10:  Yeah.  I live in, uh, um, well, I live, uh, I live about five minutes from
the T I plant, and it's in, uh, A-,

A.11:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.12:  # it's # in the (A-leaf) area.  Which doesn't mean anything to you,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # but # it's in a, it's in a subdivision, and it's,

A.15:  # Yeah [sniffing].  #

B.16:  # uh, probably, # uh, I don't know. 

A.17:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.18:  Three bedroom house --

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  -- with, uh, you know, fenced in yard.  And it's, it's an older house, it's
--

A.21:  Is it?

B.22:  -- about twenty years old.  I bought it about four years ago,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # and # I've been kind of fixing it up and,

A.25:  # Uh-huh [/noise].  #

B.26:  # uh, doing # things --

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  -- to it as I can. 

A.29:  Yeah. 

B.30:  Yeah, I love it.  I'm just, it's a lot of work though, I'll tell you. 

A.31:  What? Fixing it up or keeping it up?

B.32:  Keeping it up,

A.33:  # Yeah.  #

B.34:  # and, # uh,

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  Uh, I decided that I was going to try to do my own yard this year. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  So I've, oh, I've, you know, it takes me three days, like --

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  -- come home one afternoon and --

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  -- mow and one day edge --

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  -- and one day weed eat.  And then my stupid magnolia tree is dropping
leaves. 

A.45:  #Oh, yeah.# 

B.46:  #And the#  raking and the,

A.47:  Yeah [child]. 

B.48:  And I thought, wait a minute, this is, and now it's ninety-five degrees
almost --

A.49:  Oh, boy [child]. 

B.50:  -- here in Houston.  It's horrible, but --

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  -- anyway,

A.53:  #So you don't,#

B.54:  #So, how,# how about your house?

A.55:  Well, we have a really large house.  We have three kids, and we bought a
five bedroom house,

B.56:  # Oh, my goodness.  Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # [Children] when we moved # here.  And, um, it's getting to be too much
[laughter]. 

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  Too much work to keep it up. 

B.60:  How many kids do you have?

A.61:  Three. 

B.62:  #Three kids.# 

A.63:  #Three, so#  we have a bedroom for everybody, and then we have an extra
playroom for them to pile all their toys in.  And an extra T V up there and,

B.64:  #And you're a working,#

A.65:  #the ironing board# and [laughter], 

B.66:  you're a working mom, too. 

A.67:  Well, yeah.  I, that's the other thing is, I was working, uh, full time.  I
just started back about a year and a half ago.  And, um, my youngest one got
to be three years old, and so then I went back to work.  And I decided after a
year of being a secretary that what I really wanted to do was go back and get
my Master's Degree [laughter] [children].

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  And, um, so then I went to part-time work, and I'm going to school
part-time.  And, uh, it's getting to be too much financially too, without my
full time income.  So, we're, we're [noise] just decided to put, last week, to
put our house on the market and, um, get a smaller house.

B.70:  #Smaller house.# 

A.71:  #Not too small#  though, with three kids. 

B.72:  Oh, man!

A.73:  So,

B.74:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.75:  so that, that was kind of a hard decision to make.  But I think, uh, I,
it's just been an awful lot.  You know, financial is one thing and that's kind
of concrete.  But also, it's just, there, it, the house is just really big.
And there, there's a lot of kids [children] and a lot of space, and it all
gets messed up [laughter].

B.76:  I know, I, you know, I can imagine.  Gee,

A.77:  So, and with cleaning out to, you know, to sell the house, we're trying to
clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything.
And when you have this much space, you don't have to be as careful about
throwing stuff out.  You just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom
or something.  So it's ju-, we just have massive stuff that, you know, is, we
just accumulated too much stuff.  I mean, not that we have a whole bunch --

B.78:  Well, it, it,

A.79:  -- of things, it's just little junky, you know, #old,#

B.80:  #You#  #tend,#

A.81:  #toys.# 

B.82:  to fill up what area you have. 

A.83:  That's it. 

B.84:  You, you don't have, you know,

A.85:  Yeah. 

B.86:  When I moved into this house, I thought, oh, wow, because I moved here from
an apartment. 

A.87:  Right, right. 

B.88:  And apartments, you can't accumulate --

A.89:  Uh-huh. 

B.90:  -- a whole lot because you just don't,

A.91:  # There's no place to put it, yeah {faint},#

B.92:  # have room to put it.  #

A.93:  to put it. 

B.94:  And now, you know, well you've got the garage, [laughter]  you know. 

A.95:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.96:  So, uh, going to a smaller place, yeah, you're going to,

A.97:  [Noise]. 

B.98:  you'll find,

A.99:  # Yeah.  #

B.100:  # it's # going to be great though.  It makes, it gives you a good feeling
when you've got, clean out the stuff #and#  --

A.101:  #You#  #know,#

B.102:  -- #get rid#  of it.

A.103:  yeah, you have more c-, control over it [laughter]. 

B.104:  [Laughter]. 

A.105:  It seems almost like it's taking control here.  #But,#

B.106:  #A lot# of things in the garage that, you know, you never use, you never,
wa-, you know,

A.107:  # Right.  #

B.108:  # why # do I keep them? There's, you know, it's just filling up the garage.

A.109:  Yeah, yeah.  #It's,#

B.110:  #So#  #you have to, uh,#

A.111:  #just because#  you have to physically go out there and go through it, I
guess, when you,

B.112:  Uh-huh.  Well I kept, kept things that, see my children are grown. 

A.113:  Uh-huh. 

B.114:  And, uh, some of the stuff, you know, was from when they were growing up so
what, you know, you hate to throw it out.  But they don't want it and,

A.115:  # Right.  #

B.116:  # you # know,

A.117:  Yeah. 

B.118:  But I'll probably keep it, keep it a while. 

A.119:  get, yeah. 

B.120:  But it's, it's amazing how a house, uh, I don't know how you do it with
your children.  And although I, you know,

A.121:  It's crazy [sigh]. 

B.122:  Well, me-, I did it too but,

A.123:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.124:  But, oh it's,

A.125:  #I think,#

B.126:  #it's a tough deal.# 

A.127:  well, I don't, I really have, uh, really relaxed standards about how well
organized and cleaned it is.  I mean it has to be basically clean because you
have to be organized e-, enough to know where things are, to be able to find
things.

B.128:  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  If it gets too messy, you spend your whole life going through trying to
find what you need.  So I learned that it has, you have to maintain a certain
standard of cleanliness, but I mean organization.  But I, I mean, compared to
the other mothers here, on my street that don't work, I mean my house is just,

B.130:  [Laughter]. 

A.131:  it looks horrible compared to theirs. 

B.132:  [Laughter]. 

A.133:  But I mean, you have to decide what you're going to do, you know.  If you
going to, uh,

B.134:  # That's right.  #

A.135:  # what's the # most important thing, yeah. 

B.136:  That's right. 

A.137:  And so that's what slides for me {faint}.

B.138:  You know, you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you
going to run your life,

A.139:  Right [sniffing],

B.140:  #you know.#

A.141:  #exactly.# 

B.142:  But it is, it's, it's, it is a lot of, a lot of work. 

A.143:  Yeah.  And, uh, we, this house was new when we bought it, and it's all
white walls.  And so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes, a-, you know.
But we just never got, we didn't have the money, we didn't have the time to
really decorate it.  And I w-, said to my husband, if we had a smaller house,
it wouldn't take, you know, hundreds of dollars to decorate one room.  It, of,
uh, you see we did this one huge wall that we have.  And it was like three
hundred dollars worth of wallpaper.  And I didn't even buy that expensive
kind, you know, that it wouldn't even cost that much.  But it was, it's a real
long wall.

B.144:  Uh-huh. 

A.145:  So if we had a smaller house, [laughter]  everything would be smaller and
i-, it wouldn't take, w-, it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up,
you know. 

B.146:  Uh-huh. 

A.147:  And, uh, but I have a feeling it's going to be hard.  Uh,

B.148:  Are you, have you started looking for another house?

A.149:  We have, we have driven around in the neighborhood.  We don't want our
children to have to change schools. 

B.150:  Uh-huh. 

A.151:  We want to try and stay in the same school area. 

B.152:  Oh. 

A.153:  So we've driven around the neighborhood, and we've looked from the outside.
But, um, I still trying to find time to get this house.  This weekend we're
going to finish up the garage and we're going, uh, do, you know, I have a few
other things I need to do here.  And then after that, I hope that this house
will be good enough for people to come through and look at it.

B.154:  Uh-huh. 

A.155:  And then I want to start going to some open houses and, and, um, you know,
look at some.  But I've talked a lot with our realtor about it, and she assured
me we could get, you know, a four bedroom house in the price range that we want
in that area.  She said, You're not going to like it as much as this one
[laughter]. 

B.156:  [Laughter]. 

A.157:  I said, Yeah, [laughter]  no kidding.  But,

B.158:  Well, uh, well, are prices holding? You know, you be able to get what
you've got in that house,

A.159:  # Um, #

B.160:  # do # you think?

A.161:  yeah.  For this house, it's, it's just in this area of Plano, it seems
the, the h-, houses are moving really quickly.  I, they said, my realtor said
about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months, because we live
half a block from the elementary school. 

B.162:  #Oh, that's#  --

A.163:  #So that's#  --

B.164:  -- #a real plus.# 

A.165:  -- #real nice.# 

B.166:  Uh-huh. 

A.167:  Yeah.  And it is five bedrooms.  She said you, you, i-, it's really hard to
find that.  And most places, places have four, and there are people that
really want five.  So that's another plus.  So it might be closer to three
months.  And, you know, we'll be, if we're real lucky, we won't lose any
money.

B.168:  Uh-huh. 

A.169:  You know, we'll, we'll be able, it's mostly the closing costs that are
going to, that y-, we can, we'll be, be, uh, asking for more than we bought
the house for three years ago.  But the closing costs are going to eat out
just about all of it.  So,

B.170:  So maybe you can get enough to cover that. 

A.171:  Yeah.  Then we'll feel really, we'll feel good [laughter]  about it. 

B.172:  So are you,

A.173:  # So, #

B.174:  # you, # you, you're basically going to have to sell that one before you
can,

A.175:  Before we can look too much, yeah,

B.176:  Or commit to something else anyway. 

A.177:  Right, that's what, that's what our realtor wants to do.  I've talked to
some other people who have put contingencies on their houses. 

B.178:  Uh-huh. 

A.179:  And, um, but our, our realtor just doesn't really like to do that.  She
doesn't even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until,
you know, I,

B.180:  Oh, really?

A.181:  Yeah. 

B.182:  I would have thought, you know, at least go and start looking,

A.183:  # Well, I'm going to, #

B.184:  # at least to know.  #

A.185:  I'm going to.  I'm going to tell her, you know, when I have the time
[laughter], 

B.186:  [Laughter]. 

A.187:  that's the hard thing.  I have finals right now, because I'm taking two
classes.  I have finals and papers and stuff, so, in, um, two weeks from now, I
should be pretty well set.  And, uh, I'm going to go out there and look.  I'm
going to tell her, I, I want to know, I want to have a feeling before I sign
saying I'm going to sell this house.  I have to see what --

B.188:  Uh-huh. 

A.189:  -- exactly it is --

B.190:  Uh-huh. 

A.191:  -- that we're going to be moving into. 

B.192:  Uh-huh. 

A.193:  So, [sigh]  but I trust her pretty much in that. 

B.194:  Yeah.  Well. 

A.195:  You know, she knows what we're looking for and she knows what's out there. 
So,

B.196:  Yeah. 

A.197:  So how about in Houston? How is it down there?

B.198:  Well, I think, uh, you know, I think, uh, real es-, houses, uh, are, th-,
it's selling #much better than,#

A.199:  #Is it getting better?#

B.200:  than it, than, than they did.  I think new,

A.201:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.202:  # new # homes in certain areas, uh, you know, are, are, are doing very
well. 

A.203:  Uh-huh. 

B.204:  Uh, and I think, uh, when I bought this house, was, actually, it's, be, in
May it will be five years. 

A.205:  Uh-huh. 

B.206:  And, uh, this was, uh, a f-, a for-, foreclosure. 

A.207:  Oh, yeah. 

B.208:  And, uh, so I mean it was, h-, had been pretty bad --

A.209:  Uh-huh. 

B.210:  -- in this area for, for awhile. 

A.211:  Right. 

B.212:  And, and, uh, I guess over the past year, it sort of, I got my, uh, the
appraisal, you know, the thing you get for what they're base your taxes on?

A.213:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.214:  And it's gone up from, it went down from what I bought it for. 

A.215:  Oh. 

B.216:  And then, and now it's come #back up.# 

A.217:  #Come back up.#  Oh, good. 

B.218:  Yeah. 

A.219:  Yeah. 

B.220:  Well, but then again I, I didn't care if it went down as long as I don't
want to sell it.  #Because#  --

A.221:  #Right.# 

B.222:  -- then I have, my taxes are going to be less.  But,

A.223:  That's true.  I didn't think about that.  That's right. 

B.224:  Yeah.  But, uh, but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood,

A.225:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.226:  # uh, # when I bought, when I, like I say, when I bought this house, there
was, oh, just many, many homes for sale,

A.227:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.228:  # and, # uh, now, uh, you don't see quite as many.  And I, and there's a
lot of people, like I just put a new roof on my house and --

A.229:  Uh-huh. 

B.230:  -- repainted the outside,

A.231:  # Uh-huh [/music].  #

B.232:  # and, uh, # I've got a, three or four {becomes faint},
