=========================================================================

A.1:  So, the topic is vacations?

B.2:  Alright, that's a good, that's a good topic, huh? [laughter]. 

A.3:  I think so.  I enjoy them. 

@B.4:  Where did you go on your last vacation?

A.5:  Uh, the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents.  It was,

B.6:  What?

A.7:  The last one was back down to Lubbock, Texas,

B.8:  # Uh-huh, yeah.  #

A.9:  # to visit # family. 

B.10:  Uh. 

A.11:  But that's not the tradition for us. 

B.12:  Oh, yeah.  What's your out of the, out of the state type, where do you like
to go?

A.13:  Uh, we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year. 

B.14:  Really?

A.15:  Yeah. 

B.16:  What kind of, uh, vacation spots are there in Colorado?

A.17:  Oh, Rocky Mountain National Park. 

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  It's, it's just like any of the other national parks.  It, you know,
there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching and,

B.20:  I think my parents took me there when I was real young.  We went to
Colorado Springs and, uh, Rocky Mountain National Park.  It was real pretty.

A.21:  Oh, it's,

B.22:  Got to see Pike's Peak. 

A.23:  Yeah, we usually try and drive up there, oh, once every year or two. 

B.24:  You drive by yourself up there?

A.25:  Sure. 

B.26:  Oh, wow. 

A.27:  To the top the of the peak, sure. 

B.28:  Oh, that's tough.  I don't, I don't think I could do that [laughter]. 

A.29:  Oh, it's not bad at all.  It's, it's a beautiful drive. 

B.30:  Oh. 

A.31:  Now I admit up there, the altitude is kind of {pause} interesting,

B.32:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.33:  You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy, but it's fun.  You know,
take along a picnic lunch and,

B.34:  Sure is pretty up there. 

A.35:  Oh, we love it. 

B.36:  You have mountains all around you?

A.37:  Uh, no, they're only to the east, uh, I mean to the west of us. 

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  Here in the Springs, you know, it's right there at the very foot of the
Rockies.  You know, and once a week we drive up into the mountains, usually,
you know, usually once a week, once every other week.

B.40:  Wow, that's neat.  I'm jealous [laughter].  There's hills in Texas. 

A.41:  Yeah, well, I enjoy hills, in Texas too.  I've been in Sherman. 

B.42:  Have you ever been out of the United States for, uh, vacation?

A.43:  No, I haven't, you?

B.44:  Or business?

A.45:  Uh, once to Mexico City, but just a little day thing on business. 

B.46:  Uh-huh.  I went to, uh, the Bahamas last year, on a cruise for my
honeymoon. 

A.47:  Uh, that's nice. 

B.48:  It was really neat, I had never been out of, really, out of Texas or out of
Indiana much, out of the United States.  I'm from Indiana so,

A.49:  Did you enjoy it?

B.50:  What?

A.51:  Did you enjoy it?

B.52:  Yeah, it was great. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  It was really pretty down there. 

A.55:  Uh, got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a
different culture and,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, really did.  There, in fact, one, uh, family that {pause}
sat at our table every meal was from London,

A.57:  # Oh.  #

B.58:  # and # they had never been to the United States, so they were really
enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips.

A.59:  Huh. 

B.60:  They had been to Disneyland, and it was neat to meet different people. 

A.61:  So the place that I went, that we've gone on vacation that I think I
enjoyed the most,

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  # was # Seattle. 

B.64:  Oh, really? I've heard it's really pretty up there. 

A.65:  Well, we, uh, was, two years ago,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # we # went during the drought. 

B.68:  Oh. 

A.69:  I'm sorry, three years ago.  It had been dry for a whole week. 

B.70:  Oh, wow. 

A.71:  It didn't rain for a whole week. 

B.72:  Yeah [laughter], that would have been nice.  That would have been best time
to go.

A.73:  Yeah, somehow we picked the right time and, uh, walked down on the wharf,
and I think we ate seafood every meal for, well, not quite every meal, but most
meals for a week. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  Uh, it was wonderful.  Uh, the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl
really enjoyed.  It's {pause} very interesting.

B.76:  Pacific Science?

A.77:  Yeah. 

B.78:  Really?

A.79:  Yes.  It was, it was super, and, uh, went to the Seattle Aquarium. 

B.80:  Uh-huh. 

A.81:  And it's right down there, on the, right there on the ocean, and {pause}
down there on the wharf by the piers and all, and you walk down in a dome, a
glass dome,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # and # the bay is circulating over your head, and you,

B.84:  # Oh, wow.  #

A.85:  # and you # can watch the fish swim by and sharks and oh it's,

B.86:  Oh, neat. 

A.87:  Yeah, and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, and oh, it's,

B.88:  # [Laughter].  #

A.89:  # it's # amazing. 

B.90:  That's the vacation you recommend, huh?

A.91:  Oh, absolutely. 

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  Without a doubt.  Seattle is beautiful, and the mountains,

B.94:  # Yeah, I've heard it is.  #

A.95:  # the mountains to the east # of Seattle,

B.96:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.97:  # are # just incredible. 

B.98:  Really?

A.99:  I rode a ferry for the first time in my life. 

B.100:  Oh, wow. 

A.101:  You know, up there, {pause} you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of
islands around there by ferry,

B.102:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.103:  # Instead # of by bridge.  And you drive your car on.  You park your car,
you set your brake.  You walk upstairs and you have a beer,

B.104:  # Oh.  #

A.105:  # or # coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day. 

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  It's amazing. 

B.108:  And your car is on a ferry?

A.109:  Yes. 

B.110:  And it goes across with you?

A.111:  Yes. 

B.112:  That's really neat. 

A.113:  Yeah, yeah.  And there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry,
you know, and drive,

B.114:  To work?

A.115:  on to it, yeah, live on an island off, off shore from Seattle. 

B.116:  That's really wild. 

A.117:  And, you, uh, everyday they drive on the ferry.  They go upstairs and have
their morning coffee. 

B.118:  Huh. 

A.119:  Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across
and, you know, depending on where it is. 

B.120:  [Laughter]  Hour and ten minutes?

A.121:  Well, in some places, you know,

B.122:  # Yeah.  #

A.123:  # in # some areas, you know, depends on how far they are commuting. 

B.124:  That's really interesting. 

A.125:  Oh, it, it's strict, I'm, I'm a West Texan. 

B.126:  Uh-huh. 

A.127:  Out there in the land of no water. 

B.128:  Yeah. 

A.129:  And, to think that people live on the water daily, is kind of odd to me. 
You know, it's, it's a different life style than we are used to. 

B.130:  Yeah, it is.  I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different
parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long, and I haven't really
seen much.  So what are some good things in Texas to go visit?

A.131:  Oh, Galveston. 

B.132:  Galveston?

A.133:  Yes, I liked Galveston real well, uh, {pause} there's, uh, one of the areas
down there close to Galveston is, I forget the name of the island,

B.134:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.135:  # but # it's a bird sanctuary,

B.136:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.137:  # with # all kinds of wild birds.  Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks
and pelicans and it's very pretty.  Uh, I like the Rio Grande Valley. 

B.138:  Uh-huh. 

A.139:  Real well.  Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone,
to the,

B.140:  # Yeah.  #

A.141:  # to # the Alamo. 

B.142:  Boardwalk and all that. 

A.143:  Yeah, the river walk.  Oh, it's,

B.144:  Yeah. 

A.145:  And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up
and down through there.  Oh, it's just simply beautiful. 

B.146:  I've heard it's really pretty. 

A.147:  And, of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down
to San Antone just,

B.148:  Really?

A.149:  Yeah, and go to, uh, Lone Star, and uh, you know make my annual pilgrimage
to the Lone Star Brewery, and. 

B.150:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.151:  Uh, El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way.  You know, go across
the border and all.  Uh, the Davis Mountains are interesting,

B.152:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.153:  # out # there in West Texas. 

B.154:  Down by Big Bend?

A.155:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of
winter,

B.156:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.157:  # because, # {pause} there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be, it
can best be appreciated when you are not burning up. 

B.158:  Yeah. 

A.159:  You know, whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at.  It's most
enjoyable,

B.160:  # Um.  #

A.161:  # to # get, you know, to get warm. 

B.162:  Uh-huh. 

A.163:  That's nice, uh, down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where
the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.  I love the Texas
Hill Country.

B.164:  Yeah. 

A.165:  And, uh, Austin is neat for, for an occasional visit. 

B.166:  I've heard to go to Austin too.  A lot people say to go down there. 

A.167:  Yeah, yeah it's a fun few days.  Uh,

B.168:  What's there to see in Austin?

A.169:  Oh, U T is real pretty. 

B.170:  Uh-huh. 

A.171:  Uh, there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area,
Marble Falls and all.  That's real pretty.  Uh, [ringing] I would say
definitely go see that part and, uh, I'd say go to, uh, Midland once, just for
the heck of it.

B.172:  [Laughter]. 

A.173:  I don't know why, exactly. 

B.174:  [Laughter]. 

A.175:  But, uh, you know, find out when they are holding {pause} the petroleum
fair, uh,
