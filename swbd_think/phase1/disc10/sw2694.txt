A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  So,

A.3:  Well, what have you had done recently to your automobile that you're just
really excited about? [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] Really, depressed is a better word.  I, actually it's being done
as, right now as we speak [laughter].

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  I had, uh, I guess that's something I could kick myself about.  I, uh, and
I guess this all started with a leaky water, uh, pump and, uh, let the engine
get over heated and, uh.  Right now they're pulling the heads off my engine
and, uh, having to do, uh, replace the head and the exhaust manifold and so
forth.

A.7:  Oh, that's major, major isn't it?

B.8:  Oh, about five hundred dollars worth --

A.9:  Oh, is that all?

B.10:  -- so far, I guess,

A.11:  # [Laughter].  #

B.12:  # or # around in there [laughter]. 

A.13:  Oh, yeah.  Well, now this isn't certainly something that you could do
yourself, is it, or would want too?

B.14:  Uh, well it, some people could probably do it themselves. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  Uh, I'm not one of those. 

A.17:  Yeah, I, I'm not.  About the only thing I can do mechanically with a, a car
is put gas in it [laughter]. 

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  I know how to take care of it but I wouldn't --

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  -- attempt to do anything.  Although I did used to try and change the oil. 

B.22:  Well, actually I did start, I did some things myself when I, before I found
out what the problem was,

A.23:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.24:  # or # how serious it was.  I tried a few things like changing the spark
plugs and pulling the P C V valve out.  Checking, uh, some of the things that
might have been wrong. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  I do, you know, some minor stuff.  But I don't really like to do, uh, car
work all that much [laughter]. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  I'd rather do wood working. 

A.29:  Oh, that's more interesting,

B.30:  # Yeah.  #

A.31:  # I # would think. 

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  I had the, uh, the brakes changed on my car.  And what went in, what I went
in for, I thought was rather a routine, uh, not real expensive but, you know,
maybe expensive.  But it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job. 

B.34:  Wow!

A.35:  And they, they work okay, but the noise is so loud.  There's --

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  -- such a whirring noise.  And they tell me that that should have gone away
in two hundred miles.  But I s-,

B.38:  You should of, you should of never been there to begin with --

A.39:  Really?

B.40:  -- I would suspect. 

A.41:  Well, I've still got it after about seven hundred, and I'm taking it back
in --

B.42:  Um. 

A.43:  -- next week. 

B.44:  Especially --

A.45:  But,

B.46:  -- for four hundred bucks [laughter]. 

A.47:  Well, I didn't know.  See that's part of the problem.  You, if you're not
aware.  And, uh,

B.48:  And you just, uh, you know, you just never know, and you know, you feel
like you're getting taken of advantage of a lot of times.

A.49:  I agree.  Uh, I, I guess, you know, the money has to be spent, and that car
has to be taken care of.  But you would hope that, uh, people would be a
little bit more honest with you.  I guess maybe the key there is to get more
than one estimate.  But I, I get so tired of having to run here and run there,

B.50:  # Yeah.  #

A.51:  # you # know. 

B.52:  That's not easy to do too, because, uh, you know, a lot of them will pull
it apart and start on it, and then they want to, then they add things on to it
--

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  -- or whatever.  You can't always get an estimate, I guess. 

A.55:  That's very true.  Well, I guess we've kind of covered the topic, huh?

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  [Laughter]. 

B.58:  Car repair. 

A.59:  Car,

B.60:  We could go on for days. 

A.61:  Yeah, I'm afraid so,

B.62:  # [Laughter].  #

A.63:  # they, # more than they want to hear. 

B.64:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.65:  So, well, I hope you have good luck getting yours fixed. 

B.66:  Yeah.  I'll, uh, I, uh, I hope so too.  I've got, uh, my fingers crossed.
I was expecting that I might hear something this afternoon, but not so far.

A.67:  Uh-huh. 

B.68:  So,

A.69:  Okay. 

B.70:  But we shall see.  Have a nice weekend. 

@@A.71:  Thank you very much, and the same to you. 

B.72:  Okay. 

A.73:  Bye, bye. 

B.74:  Good talking with you.  Bye. 

A.75:  Uh-huh.
