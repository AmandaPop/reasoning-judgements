REMARKS:        There is a clacking noise that can be heard on this tape 
and on at lease two other tapes.  About the middle of Caller A's 
conversation, there sounds like a cat meowing or a child crying and 
possible a bird.  It's hard to tell what it is.

==========================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, you said you don't have kids but, uh, you're interested in the
topic.  

B.2:  Well, yeah and, um, actually I'm very interested.  We are, my husband and 
I are thinking very soon, um, about having children and I think that I am 
just, um, a little bit, uh, brainwashed or whatever by just thinking that kids
are so wonderful and cute and I can't wait to have one and I don't see the 
real responsibility of it.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Um, and, an actually how dramatically your life can change when you do have
children.

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  Do you have kids?

A.7:  Yes.  Yes.  I have one son who's now, uh, eighteen, 

B.8:  Oh.

A.9:  and he's a sophomore in college.

B.10:  Oh wow.

A.11:  And it, it does but I was very lucky in that I was, uh, teaching at a
university and so basically, and lived within walking distance,

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  so I was able when he was little just to, uh, leave him with a neighbor
in, uh, one of these carry cots, 

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  and then go up and teach a class and come back,

B.16:  Wow.

A.17:  because I could do my work at home and my, my students who were working
on their masters' degrees and stuff would come to my house, 

B.18:  Okay.

A.19:  and I would meet with them there.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  So it was really ideal and then later on, uh, when he was, gee, maybe two
and three I actually took him, then I changed to a different school but it was
still within walking distance --

B.22:  Oh, that's great.

A.23:  -- and, uh, he spent a lot of time in my office because I was, uh,
department chairman, 

B.24:  Uh-huh [clicking].

A.25:  and, um, you know, really didn't interfere because all his life [clicking
noise] he had sort of been used to, there were quiet times [laughter].

B.26:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.27:  And so, and that worked out great.

B.28:  That's wonderful.  How is it now?  I imagine, you said he's a sophomore?

A.29:  Yes.

B.30:  So this is, is he living at home?

A.31:  Yes, he's commuting.  It's, um, about, gee, he commutes forty-five minutes
a, each way,

B.32:  Uh-huh [clicking].

A.33:  but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because it's too,
too, chancy for him to miss classes {background noise} [child] {might be
a cat} -- 

B.34:  Oh really.

A.35:  -- and so, actually we don't, I mean we still spend a lot of time 
together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and, and, uh,    
then, you know, he's in the house studying in the evening,

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  and he also works and so,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  uh, he usually calls me, 

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  when he gets home from school at noon.  I mean not, not checking in 

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  but more, gee, you know,

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  missed you, you know, this is what's new type of thing and I think we
have a very good relationship from that standpoint but I think it's unusual
and,

B.46:  That's great.

A.47:  I think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the
time [laughter].

B.48:  Oh really.

A.49:  Until, till, uh, six years ago.

B.50:  Where, what part of Europe?

A.51:  Well, I was actually in the Middle East.  

B.52:  Oh my goodness.

A.53:  So.

B.54:  Oh how nice.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  Was he raised bilin-, as a bi-, #was he bilingual? [TV].# 

A.57:  #Bilingual?# Yes. Yeah.  Actually, uh, he, he was more, in a sense raised
trilingual in that I spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby.

B.58:  Oh my goodness.  

A.59:  And then, but he always answered in Arabic because he heard more Arabic
than Spanish, 

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when
he was two and a half, 

B.62:  Oh gosh.

A.63:  and he had heard me talk English on the phone, 

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  but, you know, he hadn't, he really didn't use it. 

B.66:  That is wonderful.

A.67:  So.

B.68:  Boy, I, I, I am Arabic, actually.   

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  My background is, uh,

A.71:  Where are you from?

B.72:  my, my grandparents are from Syria.

A.73:  Oh, okay.

B.74:  And, uh, I wish that my parents had taught me Arabic when I was younger.
It was really a sort of the taboo language,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  when I was little, uh, you know, there was the whole an, and there 
#still is,#

A.77:  #because you,#  they were newly in this country?

B.78:  Well my parents were born here.

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  My grandparents, 

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  moved here, uh, and then had my parents shortly after they moved here.

A.83:  Where were they, where, they, what village,

B.84:  In Damascus. 

A.85:  Oh, from Damascus.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  From Damascus, all of them actually.

A.87:  Oh, okay.

B.88:  And, uh, I just, I think it's a real shame because now I don't have the
patience and I don't have the ability, you know, at my age to start learning a
foreign language, 

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  but when you're a kid [static] you just pick it up so naturally.

A.91:  Yeah, but see there's a big, big issue there because my, my family spoke
German at home, 

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  so that we couldn't understand.

B.94:  Oh really.

A.95:  And, and my, uh, nieces and nephews are not learning their mother's
language.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  So that, I think this is a, a tendency in the States because it's a
melting pot so I think my son had the advantage of we were actually living
outside the country

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  so there was a reason for,

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  him to learn it.

B.102:  Uh-huh.  That's true.

A.103:  Yeah, it's really hard.

B.104:  Yeah.  Do you think that your being in academics, uh, helped your son.  He,
he sounds like he is very responsible and, uh, you know, seems to be concerned
about his studies.

A.105:  Well I'm not so sure that it's the, the academics as much as spending time
with him,

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  and I've been concerned in the States since I've been back, 

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  with the number, particularly in the Washington area where I live now.

B.110:  Oh.

A.111:  Uh, with seeing how many kids come home to empty houses,

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  and like in our court, we live in a townhouse court, 

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  and there's seven year olds that come home and they're locked out.

B.116:  Oh geez.

A.117:  and you know, some of the neighbors sort of feel sor-, sorry for them
and, and, you know, would be very responsible if something happened but the
parents aren't willing to, to pay that person to sort of be in charge,

B.118:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.119:  and, and I think this is, I, you know, I've just seen so much of it here
in this country that,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  you wouldn't see in, in, certainly not in the Arab culture, I mean,

B.122:  Yeah. Oh no, that for sure.

A.123:  [Laughter] peo-, people are more important than things so,

B.124:  And then everyone wonders why, why, like you said, that seven year old,
you know, why two months from now,

A.125:  He's a terror.

B.126:  he's on drugs or something.

A.127:  Well he's a terror, he just, 

B.128:  Oh really.

A.129:  you know, climbs on cars, 

B.130:  Oh geez.

A.131:  walks around the court threatening people with sticks,

B.132:  Oh.

A.133:  yeah it, 

B.134:  Well, he has no discipline, I mean no one is there to tell him what's
right and what's wrong.

A.135:  Right.  Now would you continue, do you work now?

B.136:  Yes I do.  I work full time and my husband actually is going for his 
P H D,

A.137:  Oh.

B.138:  and, uh, would like to teach.

A.139:  Uh-huh.

B.140:  And be a professor, uh, hopefully somewhere in the south.  I, I, I'm from
Boston and, I, I'm fed up with the cold weather [laughter] really between 
Boston and Rochester.

A.141:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.142:  But, uh, ideally I would, uh, I want to have a child and I'd like to be
able to be home for a year.

A.143:  Right.

B.144:  I, and I really just selfishly don't want to miss that.

A.145:  Uh-huh.  [clicking] [talking].

B.146:  And, uh, you know, my husband's schedule, hopefully, will be flexible, uh,
in that he could do a lot of his work at home --

A.147:  Uh-huh.

B.148:  -- and, uh, I'm not sure I, I still want to work, I think that's very
important, 

A.149:  Right.

B.150:  to keep that up and I don't want to, um, you know, I don't want to go
several years --

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  -- without working outside the house but, uh, but I think that him being,
uh, a little bit more flexible with his schedule will really help us out a
lot.

A.153:  Uh-huh.

B.154:  So, that, that's nice thing about teaching.

A.155:  Right, right.  That, yo-, he'll be able to spend more time which is so
important.

B.156:  Right.  And I imagine that obviously your summers were a lot lighter.
#As far as work load.#

A.157:  #Right, actually# we traveled extensively because,

B.158:  Oh.

A.159:  I was doing archeology and so --

B.160:  Oh wow.

A.161:  -- you know, he was always able to come with me on all my travels,

B.162:  Uh-huh.

A.163:  because a lot of the places I went by car, of course.

B.164:  Oh sure.

A.165:  And, I mean, you know, I was living in the middle of it and I took every
advantage and,

B.166:  Uh-huh.

A.167:  and, you know, he doesn't dislike travel now, he might not like it, uh,
you know, he might not feel compelled to travel,

B.168:  Right.

A.169:  because he has seen a lot,

B.170:  Uh-huh.

A.171:  but he's very comfortable traveling.

B.172:  Uh-huh. 

A.173:  And so,

B.174:  Well he has done more and seen more than most people do in a lifetime,

A.175:  That's right. That's right.

B.176:  it sounds like.  That's wonderful and it, it sounds like he really
appreciates it too.

A.177:  Right. [laughter] You know, that, that remains to be seen [child] 
[noise] but yes I think so,

B.178:  [Laughter].

A.179:  I think so.

B.180:  That's great.

A.181:  So.

B.182:  Does he have a girlfriend?

A.183:  No.  

B.184:  (( )), oh.

A.185:  No and, and, and I find that interesting because he's been two years ahead
in the schools here --

B.186:  Oh wow.

A.187:  -- and so he always, you know, [child_crying] was treated like little
brother.  When the band needed transportation they'd say oh, he can't drive
so,

B.188:  Oh.

A.189:  you know when he's a senior he can drive some of the, the younger kids
around type of thing --

B.190:  Uh-huh.

A.191:  -- and he di-, he didn't get his li-, I mean he was just sixteen when he
graduated from high school so,

B.192:  Uh-huh.

A.193:  you know, he, he has friends but he doesn't have any, you know, he hasn't
really gotten into the social thing,

B.194:  Uh-huh.

A.195:  and he's, I think that's all right.  He's going to, it looks like finish
his degree first before,

B.196:  Uh-huh.

A.197:  he gets too involved.

B.198:  Uh-huh.  Well that's a good idea.

A.199:  Yeah.

B.200:  You know it's, its', I would love, when I was little I had friends and
they had enormous families and I would love to have a large family. It seems
so expensive though, 

A.201:  Um.

B.202:  to think about raising a child besides just the, the essentials, you
know, clothes,

A.203:  Right.

B.204:  and food, and this and that.  I really feel like there's this whole, uh,
you know, you have to keep up with the Jones or whatever,

A.205:  That's right.

B.206:  they say and, uh, you know, it just seem like, when I, you know, 
watch,

A.207:  But you don't have to keep up.  I mean, kids appreciate it more if you
don't.  

B.208:  Really.

A.209:  I think if, if things are special and are for them they see that their kids
are being bought, 

B.210:  Uh-huh.

A.211:  that their friends are being bought, 

B.212:  Yeah.

A.213:  by their parents.

B.214:  Well I hope so, I mean I look at these toys on T V and I just,

A.215:  [Laughter].

B.216:  think oh, my God, they didn't have those when I was little.

A.217:  Uh-huh, and they don't need them and they don't even appreciate them.

B.218:  Yeah.

A.219:  I mean that's my feeling.

B.220:  Uh-huh.

A.221:  I think, you know, from what I see, a lot of people just, it's a token,
you know, you don't have me so you have all these material things.

B.222:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, it's interesting.  Well, I don't know I
think I'm ready for it.  A couple of years, we got married a couple of years
ago and I thought, oh my God, I'll never be ready for a kid -- 

A.223:  Uh-huh.

B.224:  -- but I, I definitely think I am now.
