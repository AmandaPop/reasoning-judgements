REMARKS:        Easy recording to transcribe.  Both spoke clearly and 
distinctly.  Speaker A breaths a little heavy.  In speaker B's background, 
it sounds like someone is cutting and chopping as in cooking. 

============================================================================

@A.1:  [Breathing]  Okay.  You've, do you have a, uh, monthly budget?

B.2:  Well, uh, we, we do, but not an official one. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  I mean, basically, we know, we have, I, I think I'm a little crazy in that
we keep so many different savings accounts. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  We'll have our checking account that's just the, the money that we use and
spend. 

A.7:  Right. 

B.8:  And then we have a savings account, which is money, w-, w-, where, we work
our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything, and then we write it
out like it was a check. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  So, we're nev-, we pay off our bills in full.  [Noise] We're not paying any
interest, but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have
it all written out already.

A.11:  Right. 

B.12:  And then we have another checking acc-, another savings account, which is
like for heavy duty savings,

A.13:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.14:  # you # know, that's just taken out of our paychecks every week.  And then
we have a, a fourth sort of C D type arrangement, [noise]  uh, where, you know,
it's in a C D and we can't get to it.  So, I guess our budget is just what's in
our checkbook.  We don't say we have x amount for entertainment, x amount for
gas.  It's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two
times, some weeks one time, some weeks three times.  Uh, so there's nothing
really that we have written down for a budget. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  But I'm a saver.  I would rather, if I had twenty extra dollars, I would
rather save it than spend it. 

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  And that's my philosophy.  And, uh, sometimes, I, I, you know, I think that
that's not necessarily the best way to live, but I, I always think that you're
going to need it for a rainy day. 

A.19:  Right. 

B.20:  You know? How about you?

A.21:  Well, we're very, very similar.  We,

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  I have worked for a goal of saving three months' salary, #and,#

B.24:  #Wow!# [Noise]  {sounds like something is being pounded or chopped}.

A.25:  and we put that, uh, in a account.

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  And we just leave it there.  That's,

B.28:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.29:  # our # emergency account.  If the car breaks down,

B.30:  # Uh-huh [Noise].  #

A.31:  # I mean, # we can take money out of that.  But, you know, then our goal
after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months' salary. 

B.32:  Right [Whistling]. 

A.33:  Now, we've r-, only, we've recently done that.  So now, we have extra money
we don't have to slap in that account, so we're looking into mutual funds or,
uh, just, uh, common stock, you know, anything like that that we can get a
higher,

B.34:  [Noise]. 

A.35:  return on our money. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  Uh, let's see, we do have the checking account.  We have, Carla works for T
I so she has a C O D A plan. 

B.38:  Oh!

A.39:  You know, where she puts in, if they put in a dollar, sh-, if she puts in a
dollar, you know, T I pays fifty cents. 

B.40:  Oh, that's great!

A.41:  It's sort of like a matching fund.  Then she gets like eight percent
interest on top of that. 

B.42:  Uh-huh [/whistling]. 

A.43:  So, that's been, uh, pretty juicy for the --

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  -- last couple of years. 

B.46:  Yeah, that's wonderful. 

A.47:  And,

B.48:  One nice thing that my company does, uh, and I know this is going on all
over the country, but they allow you to put into a, a certain fund --

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  -- whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be
for the year, such as any prescriptions, uh, if you wear glasses or contacts,
any expenses you might have for that, any dental expenses you anticipate, if
you have kids, day care, that sort of thing, uh,

A.51:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.52:  # outside # of a major medical hospitalization problem, anything that, that
might be medically related.  And so you claim that amount at the beginning of
the year [Whistling].  Let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  They'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck, uh, broken up
into fifty-two weeks.

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  So, whatever that is, divided by fifty-two.  And w-, what in, in a sense
happens is, you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars. 

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  Do you have something like that?

A.59:  No.  Well, they may have.  We just haven't taken advantage of it. 

B.60:  It's really wonderful.  In our case, we don't have that many medical
expenses, thank God, and so,

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # I # only claim two hundred dollars [Noise]. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  So, I, my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars. 

A.65:  Right. 

B.66:  And they break that up into three dollars and eighty-five cents a week
that's taken out automatically.  And then if I go and get my teeth cleaned for
thirty dollars, I pay the thirty dollars, and then I send it in to the, it's
Blue Choice, I send it in to them, and then they send me a check back for
thirty dollars.  But the nice thing is that that thirty dollars I wasn't taxed
on --

A.67:  Right. 

B.68:  -- initially because it, it almost looked like I never made that thirty
dollars.  And it's really wonderful.  If I, this is the first year we did it,
and, uh, next year, I, I'm just going to claim a lot more.  If you don't spend
it all, then you do lose it.  But I feel we could have benefitted from even two
hundred dollars more from it. 

A.69:  Huh, #so,#

B.70:  #But#  it's a nice little savings account.  And then they, they tell you if
you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a
savings account, and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and
that sort of thing. 

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  But, um,

A.73:  So if you don't use it in one year, you lose th-,

B.74:  Yes.  If you don't,

A.75:  # Um.  #

B.76:  # lose # it.  So if you decided to claim or, or to put aside five hundred
dollars and you only spent four fifty, they let you know each quarter,

A.77:  # Yeah.  #

B.78:  # and # they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left, two
hundred dollars left, but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't
spent that fifty, then you do lose it. 

A.79:  ((Well)) it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again. 

B.80:  Yeah, right [laughter]  or just buy a new set of glasses or [laughter], 

A.81:  # Well, yeah, that's # --

B.82:  # or whatever.  #

A.83:  -- true too. 

B.84:  But I, I don't know how people can really live on a budget.  Our, I mean, a
budget that's really written out. 

A.85:  Uh-huh. 

B.86:  Uh, you know, this amount of dollars, because you, your life [noise]  just
fluctuates so much.  I mean, each week is so different. 

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  Some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to
go under, and so, to me, it's just easier to,

A.89:  Well,

B.90:  # I don't know.  #

A.91:  # there again, we # both have the natural tendency to save. 

B.92:  #Yeah, that's true.# 

A.93:  #But like,#

B.94:  #That's true.#

A.95:  #so if we have#  the extra money, we're going to slap it away as --

B.96:  Right. 

A.97:  -- opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it. 

B.98:  That's true.  Yeah. 

A.99:  #So, for those#  --

B.100:  #That could make a#  #point.# 

A.101:  -- #people#  that are in debt,

B.102:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

A.103:  # like you # said, you pay your credit card off at the end of the month,
and so do we.

B.104:  Right. 

A.105:  Because I hate interest. 

B.106:  Oh, I hate it too. 

A.107:  So, I mean, but some people don't care about interest. 

B.108:  Well, you, you know, some people look at their, their credit card limit as
a loan in a sense.

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  And they, uh, you know if their limit is twenty-five hundred dollars, if
they have a hundred left, they'll spend that because they think they have it. 

A.111:  Yeah. 

B.112:  And then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives
practically. 

A.113:  Right.  It's a vicious circle. 

B.114:  Yeah, it really is. 

A.115:  Yeah.  Credit cards are good if you use them correctly. 

B.116:  Uh-huh. 

A.117:  But they can be very dangerous if you don't. 

B.118:  Oh, they sure can.  That's for sure. 

A.119:  Especially, yeah, that interest is terrible. 

B.120:  I know.  And you know, they send these applications out to college kids. 

A.121:  Uh-huh. 

B.122:  And a college kid gets an application that says, You've been approved for
this amount of credit,

A.123:  [Laughter]. 

B.124:  y-, y-, you know, [noise] automatic approval, and they get them, and then
these kids start charging and, and they get themselves into some deep trouble.

A.125:  Oh, yeah. 

B.126:  Before they even [laughter]  start making money, they're already,

A.127:  [Laughter]. 

B.128:  in debt, you know. 

A.129:  No kidding. 

B.130:  Let alone loans and [noise]  stuff.  But,

A.131:  Yeah, that sounds like you, uh, know what are you doing, you've got your
big master savings account that you're going to {Background noise sounds like
something was dropped} use to retire on or something or,

B.132:  Well, it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on. 
But, uh, it's, yeah, it's just, uh, something that's automatically taken out of
our paychecks each week. 

A.133:  Uh-huh. 

B.134:  And, uh, it goes for an emergency.  We had a disastrous storm here about
seven weeks ago.  And Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks,
and everyone lost their power.

A.135:  [Noise]. 

B.136:  And we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed. 

A.137:  Oh, man! [Breathing]. 

B.138:  And it wasn't covered by insurance.  So that's something where y-, you
don't plan on, it's not something that you can,

A.139:  [Laughter]. 

B.140:  you know, you're not saving for a trip or whatever.  It's boom, here it is.
And you just have to pay for it.  So it's an emergency fund.  But when we got
[noise] married, we, you know, obviously got some money.  And that, that's
what's put in the C D.

A.141:  Oh. 

B.142:  And to me, I, I try and forget that we even have that. 

A.143:  Yeah. 

B.144:  Because I don't want to think about that.  [Noise] Uh, but it would be nice
to just, not always think about saving, like have a, have a twenty dollar bill
and think, oh, maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this.

A.145:  Yeah. 

B.146:  And it'll come [/Noise]. 

A.147:  Yeah, we, I just did that.  My wife's birthday was yesterday. 

B.148:  Oh, really?

A.149:  And, yeah, so, I'm very tight, you know, with my cash. 

B.150:  Uh-huh [Laughter]. 

A.151:  And we haven't really, we don't go to malls and shop because they're too
expensive. 

B.152:  Oh, yes. 

A.153:  And, you know, we'll buy things here and there, but --

B.154:  Uh-huh. 

A.155:  -- she ha-, we haven't really went shopping for her. 

B.156:  Oh. 

A.157:  And, you know, but she's been really good, and she hasn't really said much.
And I go, well, look, you know, today we're going to go out and get something.
So we went out and blew about a hundred bucks.  But,

B.158:  # Oh, isn't that great.  #

A.159:  # you know, for us, # that's a, that's huge,

B.160:  # Oh, I know what you mean [Noise].# 

A.161:  # for me, you know, #

B.162:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.163:  # but, # you know, some people do it every weekend. 

B.164:  Oh, it's incredible!

A.165:  But,

B.166:  They really do.  I mean, I, I like discount stores.  I have no problem with
buying an, a no name brand of something.  {Sounds like a bell tinkling in the
background}.

A.167:  Yeah. 

B.168:  Uh, I'm not into labels and that sort of thing.  [Bell]  {Sounds like a
timer going off in background}.

A.169:  Yeah. 

B.170:  Our fire, our smoke detector's going off [Laughter]. 

A.171:  Oh, o-,

B.172:  #Making french fries.# 

A.173:  #You're not cooking,# are you?

B.174:  Um, my husband's making french fries [/Bell]  [Laughter]. 

A.175:  That's funny. 

B.176:  Or burning French fries, one or the other.  But, um, I feel fortunate that
my parents instilled in me, you know, a sense to save and,

A.177:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.178:  # and, # you know, watch where your money goes.  And I think --

A.179:  Well, that's good. 

B.180:  -- that's very valuable.  Yeah. 

A.181:  That's good. 

B.182:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.183:  Sounds like, uh, you know what you're doing. 

B.184:  Yeah, I hope so.  We do, you too.  Was your wife always like this or was
she, did you have to,

A.185:  Did I have to train her?

B.186:  Yeah [Laughter]. 

A.187:  No, she, she's really good.  She, uh, she didn't, uh, you know, she doesn't
go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and --

B.188:  Uh-huh. 

A.189:  -- like Blondie in the cartoons, you know. 

B.190:  I know. 

A.191:  She doesn't do anything like that.  She's not big on sales and all that. 
She's just really --

B.192:  Uh-huh. 

A.193:  -- she's really great.  She's really content, and just uses what she has
and then,

B.194:  # That's great {very faint}. #

A.195:  # {Sound fading} you know, # she just, you know, some day [/breathing],
