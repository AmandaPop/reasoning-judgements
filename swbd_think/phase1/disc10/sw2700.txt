REMARKS:        There was background noise throughout most of the recording,
but it did not really interfere with understanding the conversation.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, how would you rate it?

B.2:  Uh, well, I'm kind of in the middle.  I lived in the Ozarks for a long
time, where a lot of people do a lot of hunting.  And, uh,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  now I live in Dallas, where there's a lot of crime.  And I'm all for, uh,
the average Joe being able to have a gun.  But then again I'm not, you know,
as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever,

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  I'm all for that too.  I don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a
gun right away.  If you want a gun for a legitimate purpose, you should be
willing to wait --

A.7:  Yeah, that's true.

B.8:  -- long enough for someone to verify that you're not a,

A.9:  Yeah, th-, that's true.  

B.10:  #a potential criminal.#

A.11:  #I'm, I'm kind of like you,# you know, I do-, I'm kind of in between.  But
I, I'd rather not rate it at all because I think it's very site specific
[Cough] {in background}.

B.12:  Yeah.  And I, I don't think, you know, I think it's one of the
constitutional rights that is important and, you know, we, we should be
allowed to have guns.

A.13:  Yeah [whistling] {in background}.

B.14:  I don't think they should turn around and say, you know, the government
says you can't have a gun.  Because that just, I don't know.

A.15:  Right.  It doesn't make sense, if, if you --

B.16:  Any, #any, any country# --

A.17:  -- #can govern yourself.#

B.18:  -- where they've ever revolted, you know, it takes guns to revolt.  And
sure, we don't need to.  But, uh, never know, there might come a time
[noise].

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  #So,#

A.21:  #Well,# I, I think, you know, it's like you're saying is, you know, wh-,
in, in places in communities where hunting is common, yeah, you can't ban guns
there.  It's not, it's,

B.22:  [Talking] {background voices}.

A.23:  kind of impossible.  It's a way of life for people.  What? [laughter]
{faintly} But, uh, in, in cities I think there, there may be a possibility for
a certain law restricting firearms in certain areas.  Maybe not the ownership
of such, but it's restricting the, you know, the, uh, presence of, of hand
guns --

B.24:  Well, they --

A.25:  -- #in certain areas.#

B.26:  -- #do that now.# I mean you're not supposed to have a hand guns, well
maybe you're allowed to have them, say in the city, but you're not allowed to
use them --

A.27:  No, that's what I'm saying --

B.28:  -- #in the city limits and things.# 

A.29:  -- #like not have one in the# city.  Like you can have one, but you can't
have it in your apartment if it's, you know, because you're in the city.  Like
you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else.  And y-, just because you
live in the city doesn't mean you can't have it.  But you just can't have it
in the city.

B.30:  Well, what does that do to people that, uh, use it for protection?  Like,
you know, I personally I don't --

A.31:  #Well.#

B.32:  -- #have# a gun, but I wouldn't mind having one.  I live in a neighborhood
where the crime rate is going up.  Somebody breaks in my house, I wouldn't
mind having a gun, you know, in self-defense.

A.33:  #Yeah, well,# 

B.34:  #But, uh,# 

A.35:  you know, I se-, see I don't know the statistics for that.  For, uh, you
know, how, if, if by having a gun how much that really helps.  So I don't
really know, that's why I think that maybe i-, if not, maybe not just having
one will be better.  That's, that's why, I, I wouldn't know because I'm not
from the city.  So I don't, I don't see the very high crime rate.  You, on the
other hand, may have a different opinion.

B.36:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I've never had it, never had to have one in the city,
you know.  When I was in the country we used them.  And out there was a
necessity, I mean you don't --

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  -- kill a copperhead with a rock,

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  you shoot them.  #But, uh,#

A.41:  #Exactly.#  As, you know, as I'm, I'm from, uh, you know, rural.  So, I, I
go hunting a lot.

B.42:  I think there need to be stronger gun control laws that can be, that can,
uh, that, uh, what am I trying to say?  In, in cities in, urban areas.  #But,#

A.43:  #Uh-huh.#

B.44:  I don't think guns should be banned.  

A.45:  No.

B.46:  I just think it should be harder for, for a criminal to get hold of them.
And of course the black market, anyone can get one if they want one.

A.47:  Yeah.  The bad things is that, you know, when you try to make it harder for
criminals to get them, how do you know if you're selling to a criminal or not?

B.48:  Well, that, I guess that's the whole point of some of #this# --

A.49:  #Yes.#

B.50:  -- legislation.

A.51:  #Yeah.#

B.52:  #They're,# --

A.53:  I mean, #you can-,#

B.54:  -- #they're eventually going to make,#

A.55:  you can't ever really determine that.  I mean you can sell it to a
straight person and, and --

B.56:  #He turns around, yeah# --

A.57:  -- #then he becomes a truant.#  Yeah, yeah, and then you know, it's like
shit [Noise].

B.58:  -- and passes it on.  Yeah, there's no perfect answer.  But I guess, I'm,
I'm more f-,

A.59:  More #for some# --  

B.60:  #I'm more for,#

A.61:  -- kind of control, huh? 

B.62:  No, I'm actually more for less control because I think it's, it's a right
that, that I would hate to see us lose.

A.63:  Yeah.  #Well, I# --

B.64:  #And the more,#

A.65:  -- #don't want to see it,#

B.66:  #the more you give# gun control, the little bi-, the little bit of time
before long you don't have anything.  I mean, I'm sure when they started out
with taxes they didn't plan on taking thirty percent of your income.  But, uh,
[laughter],

A.67:  [Laughter] #But it sounds good to them.#  

B.68:  #They just start with a little bit,# you know.  

A.69:  Yeah, well, I think, you know, maybe some kind of con-, some ki-, I think
they should ban, uh, automatic weapons.  For, you know, only, only and
restrict them to, uh, gun clubs only.  I don't know if they've, they've
completed that action or not.

B.70:  Yeah.  I don't know what the deal is on that.  I know you can't buy them
any more.  You can't,

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  can't buy imported ones anyway.

A.73:  And, well, uh,  

B.74:  #Or is it the other way around?#

A.75:  #I mean, that doesn't really matter.#  Imported or, or, you know,
domestic machine guns, they still do the same damage.

B.76:  Right, 

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  I don't see, I don't see what the difference is myself.  You know, getting
shot #by,#

B.80:  #I# don't see any reason for anybody to have one 
unless they're --

A.81:  #Only in a gun club# --

B.82:  -- #fighting a war,# #you know.#   

A.83:  -- #or something,# r-, you know.  In a, in a gun club or, or have the wrong
reason in mind.  Those two #are the,#

B.84:  #Right.#  Right.

A.85:  that's why I think that maybe, you know, you, if you say you can't have
an automatic weapon, that's, that's also saying that you can't have a gun.  So
if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club, that, that
restricts it even further.  Doesn't, doesn't take away your right, it just
puts a restriction on your right.

B.86:  Right.

A.87:  But, I do-, you know, I think, I think restrictions are going to be needed,
but no, no bans or anything like that.  It's kind of hard though because in
different reg-, different regions like you were saying, is, uh, is different.
Like there where you're at, you wouldn't mind having a gun.  So you, you're
really,

B.88:  #Yeah,# 

A.89:  #you know,#

B.90:  I wouldn't need an Uzi though [laughter].

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  Or a U B forty.  I mean a, a pistol would be fine.  It's more for a scare
tactic than anything else.

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  I don't really want to shoot somebody, but I guess if, uh, it was me or
him, #I would have to.#

A.95:  #It's a good deterrent.#  

B.96:  Yeah.  Course you've got people that are pulling them out on the highways
down here.  It's like you cut them off, and boom, they blow you away.  So you
have to draw the line I guess [sigh].

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  I don't know.  So if we're supposed to pick a number, I'd guess I'd pick,
oh, that no gun control was, #was ten.#

A.99:  #Well,# a total ban is one.  And, uh, no ban at all is ten.

B.100:  I guess I'd have to pick about eight or something down there toward the low
end.

A.101:  Yeah. I think, I think, well, around seven or eight, restricting certain
kinds and, and leaving others out with restrictions.  But I don't know what
that, you know, like you were saying, the, uh, the seven day restriction or
seven day wait period or something like that?

B.102:  Well, supposedly in seven days they're going, they're going to look through
your background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have,

A.103:  What does that mean?  That, that really doesn't, you know, it's, just
because it gives them time to look you up, doesn't mean, I mean it, it, it may
be well-intended, but I don't know how effective it is.

B.104:  Yeah.  I don't either.  It might stop some people, but some people with a
history of something.  But, uh, you know, I guess there's a lot of information
out there on everybody.  Whether we, we believe it or not, they know
everything you've done for the last, ever since you got a social security
number, really.

A.105:  Yeah.  That's true.

B.106:  So, uh, I guess they've got some time to make sure you haven't been in
prison or don't have a history of, you know, I don't know.

A.107:  So then it's, it's, uh, up to the, the individual dealer?

B.108:  I don't know, I really don't know what the, the actual on how, how they
work that out.  I imagine with the, the way everything is computerized now, it
won't take much, you know.  A perspective buyer comes in and they throw in
your social security number on some nationally network system and it, based on
whatever criteria it's got, it says yes or no.  This guy can get a gun or he
can't.  And whoever decides those criterias, you know, that's --

A.109:  #Yeah.  But what does,# 

B.110:  -- #something the legislatures do.#  

A.111:  does the, uh, does the retailer have the opportunity to, you know,
disregard that information,

B.112:  #I really don't know# --

A.113:  #that he receives?#

B.114:  -- I don't know what the, you know, what the status of those laws are.

A.115:  Because, you know, if, if it's, if it's not against the law for the
retailer to disregard that information, that kind of defeats the whole purpose
of the seven day wait period.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  I would think if they're going to make a law, it would have to be
something, uh,

A.119:  National.

B.120:  it'd be a crime to, uh, not enforce [laughter] it.

A.121:  Right.

B.122:  And, uh,

A.123:  Oh, well, man, I guess that's about five minutes.

B.124:  All right.

A.125:  All right.  Nice talking to you, Ra-, Ralph.

B.126:  Take care.  Yeah.  

A.127:  Bye.

B.128:  Bye.
