A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Um, do you have a favorite credit card that you use?

A.3:  Um, I probably use my Discover card more than anything else.

B.4:  Because, any particular reason?

A.5:  Uh, no, I really don't use too many credit cards.  I'm not fond of them.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  I don't like using them.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  But I've just gotten to the point where I'd rather carry that instead of
cash.

B.10:  Yeah, I know what you mean.

A.11:  But the thing is, I always carry it with my checkbook.  

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  So if have, I just pay for it with my check instead of.  

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  I think I've only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times.

B.16:  Oh, really.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Wow.  Well I use, um, a credit card that's given out by U S Air.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Well, not given out, I mean, there's an annual fee.  Um, and the neat thing
about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- you get one Frequent Flyer mile.

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  And, um, my husband and I tend to charge a lot, and even things that we
wouldn't normally charge --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- now we charge, because we've racked up seriously close, in the past
couple of years, close to five or six thousand dollars, just by charging.

A.27:  Wow.

B.28:  And, um, it's really great because you can get some good discounts, um, on
U S Air, you know --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- using Frequent Flyer mileage and all that.  And the annual fee isn't
bad, I think it's maybe thirty-five dollars a year.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Um, and here, in Rochester, maybe in Pennsylvania also, but you can charge
your groceries.  Can you do that there?

A.33:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

B.34:  Which is great.

A.35:  With only certain cards, though, they don't accept all kinds of cards, like
they only accept the major cards.

B.36:  Oh, do they accept Discover or no?

A.37:  Um, I don't know they do accept the Discover, but I know they would accept
like Visa, Master Card.

B.38:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Well, I love it, and now, um, actually our mortgage company is starting I
think June first or something, is going to start allowing people to charge
their mortgage.

A.41:  Oh, my.

B.42:  And that's going to be great.  And in the beginning we were having a
problem because we would charge everything --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and then get this enormous bill and just be totally wiped out, because
one thing I hate, is paying interest.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  I refuse to pay interest. 

A.47:  Exactly.

B.48:  If I'm going to do that, I'm not going to use a credit card.

A.49:  Exactly.

B.50:  So what I do now, is a work it like a checkbook, and every time I charge
something I write it out, so I'm not fooling myself into thinking I have that
money.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  You know, I write it out, and then it's as if I paid in cash.

A.53:  Exact-, yeah.

B.54:  So you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away.

A.55:  Yes, definitely.  You see, if I'd don't have the money in my checking
account, I will not charge it, even if I have the charge.  I have to have that
money before I'll charge it.

B.56:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know what you mean.

A.57:  I refuse.  Well, I'm a college student, and I'm a finance major.

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  So [laughter],

B.60:  Well, that makes sense.

A.61:  And, um, I don't, I, oh my gosh, I prob-, I have a Discover card, I have an
A T and T card, but I don't use it, I don't even know where it is.  I put it
away,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  a few years ago, because I thought if I don't see it I won't use it.

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  Which is really good, because then I, you know, a lot of my friends have
like outrageous phone bills.

B.66:  Oh yeah.

A.67:  But I don't have it, because I don't use mine, and, um, I know I Montgomery
Wards, I have a J C Penney's.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  I have a Kaufman's, you know, I have a Fashion Book.  I have a whole bunch
of them.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And I just used my J C Penney card, and it's a year old, and that was the
first time I've ever used it.

B.72:  Really.

A.73:  Yeah.  I just, I don't think to use them all the time.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And if I do use one, I would rather use my Discover card one.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  And they're getting to the point now, too, at the end of the year --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- all the money that you've charged on --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- they'll pay you #I think,#

B.82:  #A discount.#

A.83:  it's ten percent #back.#

B.84:  #Yeah.#

A.85:  So, you know, I even got a couple dollars back.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  It's definitely worth, if you pay off your bills in full --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- then credit cards are a real good idea.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  Because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the
interest, you know, if you charge at the beginning of the month, then you're
getting a month's worth of interest --

A.91:  Exactly.

B.92:  -- on your account.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  But the second you let it go even one month, um, they had made an error on
a statement where they never posted the payment --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- but I had the cancelled check, I had everything.  And, I mean, for that
amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge.

A.97:  Oh, my gosh.

B.98:  That's like another purchase for me.

A.99:  Yeah, me too [laughter].

B.100:  (( )).

A.101:  That would definitely be for me too.

B.102:  Yeah.  But, um, one thing, one of the reasons, because I have some of those
cards that you mentioned, and I think about it, and a lot of reason I have
those cards because J C Penney offered, you know, a free gift --

A.103:  Uh, that's why I have it [laughter].

B.104:  -- if you buy it.  Or five dollars off this purchase --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- if you, you know, sign up.  And --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and, uh, as long as, because J C Penney doesn't cost you anything, I
don't think.

A.109:  No, huh-uh, no.

B.110:  Right, and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything.

A.111:  Yeah, and being a college student I get, um, applications for them all the
time.

B.112:  Oh, yeah.

A.113:  I think once a week, I have an application, and the first thing I check for
is if there's an annual fee.  If there's an annual fee I ditch it, because I
don't use them that often.

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  So it wouldn't even pay me to get it, even if it was, you know.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  And, uh, my Discover card I have no annual fee, and my mom, like I started
using mine, and I told my mom about it.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  And now she buys everything with her Discover card, and she works it the
way you do with your card.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  She writes it down --

B.122:  Oh yeah.

A.123:  -- like she would a check.  And then, you know, that way she's getting the
interest on it too.  Because at the end of the year they give her back her
interest.

B.124:  All right.

A.125:  And I think she got back like fifty some dollars last year.

B.126:  Uh wow.  That is great.

A.127:  So, I mean, she might spend three thousand, but if you get thirty of it
back, you know, that's still thirty dollars less.

B.128:  Right, and that's thirty dollars that you didn't pay any money to have it
in the first place.

A.129:  Exactly, and she, you know, my mom's like that too, she pays it off as soon
as the bill comes.

B.130:  Uh-huh.  One thing I still don't understand about credit cards is how you
can borrow money off a credit card.  I still haven't quite figured that out.

A.131:  I haven't tried it, I don't trust it [laughter].

B.132:  I know, I don't trust it either, and, um, I know you can do it with a Visa
card, but it just seems like too simple.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  And I know that there's some hidden,

A.135:  There's so, there's so much fine print --

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  -- that I don't understand that I won't even try it.

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  I just rely on my (( )) card,

B.140:  On your what?

A.141:  My (( )) card, just take it out of the bank.

B.142:  Oh, just, yeah, the machine.  One thing, um, that does scare me a little
bit about my credit card is when I am giving it over the phone.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  You know, if I, I tend to buy a lot of things from T V.

A.145:  Uh-huh.

B.146:  Not the Shopper's thing, but sometimes they'll be something good that
they're selling, a record or something like that.

A.147:  Yeah.

B.148:  And, um, after I do it, I think, God, who did I give my number to.

A.149:  Uh-huh.

B.150:  And what are they going to do with it, how can I trust them, or whatever.

A.151:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.152:  But, uh, the credit card company, I did have a charge on there once that I
had no receipt for, I had no recollection, I didn't even know the, the store.

A.153:  Uh-huh.  

B.154:  And they took it right off.

A.155:  Okay.

B.156:  No questions, I just said, this isn't my charge.  If you can prove that it
is, then great.

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  If you can't then, um, you know, just take it off.

A.159:  Yeah.  They're usually, I think they're usually pretty good about that.

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  I mean, they probably realized it was their mistake.

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  If, if they really thought that it was not their mistake I think they would
probably send you something proving that you actually --

B.164:  Oh, yeah.

A.165:  -- did have it.  So.

B.166:  Yeah, they would pursue it, definitely.

A.167:  Yeah, uh-huh.  I, I'm, I'm starting to use my credit card more.  Like I
said, I'm a college student, and the past two semesters I bought my books with
it.

B.168:  Oh, yeah.

A.169:  So, and I run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books,
so that's approximately between five and six hundred dollars that I put on it.
And I just keep thinking, oh good, I'm going to get that back --

B.170:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.171:  -- I'm going to get a little bit back [laughter].

B.172:  Right.

A.173:  Uh-huh.  

B.174:  That's true.  Before you could at least deduct, if you did pay any interest
you could at least deduct that from your taxes.  And now you can't do it, and
I know people that have racked up, they keep getting their limit extended,
because they keep exceeding it.

A.175:  I can't see that.

B.176:  And all they can do is pay the minimum balance. 

A.177:  And when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it.
They're not even paying the principal.

B.178:  No, they're not even touching it.

A.179:  I, I, uh, when I get to people like that, I wish, I think the company
should just say, uh, we're not giving you any more until you pay this off.

B.180:  I know.

A.181:  I don't, I realize that the company wants you to use it, you know, and
extend it all the time, they're making more money off you.

B.182:  Right.

A.183:  But I think they should have the consumer, the most interest, you know.

B.184:  Yeah, it's true though, because then all they end up doing is spending more
of their time making collection calls.

A.185:  It's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something.

B.186:  Oh, yeah.  Some people are, they really are.  I mean, if they, if they know
they have more on their limit --

A.187:  Uh-huh.

B.188:  -- they, I, I, I think my brother-in-law is like that actually.  But, um,
if he has a hundred left until he reaches his limit, he'll spend it.

A.189:  Oh, my God.

B.190:  He can't, because to him it's like money.  To him it's like a, a loan
almost, in a sense.  And he can't bear to,

A.191:  I can't do that, I can't do that.

B.192:  No. I can't either.

A.193:  I have, like I said, I have to, I have to know that I have that money
before I'll spend it.

B.194:  Uh-huh.

A.195:  So, I, I, I don't,

B.196:  Uh-huh.

A.197:  I don't, I don't know [laughter].

B.198:  I know.  

A.199:  Of course, my mom lives very, she was, she had twelve kids.

B.200:  Oh my God.

A.201:  And of course she, she watched her money all the time.  And that was one
good thing I did get off of her.  Uh, I don't mind spending my money as long
as it's a necessity.

B.202:  Uh-huh.

A.203:  And if it's something I really, really want.  But just to go out and start
buying, I'm not like that.

B.204:  Yeah.
