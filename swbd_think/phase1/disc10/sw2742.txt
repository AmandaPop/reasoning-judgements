============================================================================

B.1:  Well, I guess you said that you're, you're a, uh, you're engaged, so you
really don't have a, a family budget to manage right now, right?

@A.2:  Uh, I don't have a family budget but we do have a budget already
[laughter]. 

B.3:  [Laughter]  Well, that's good. 

A.4:  We're paying for our own wedding and everything. 

B.5:  Right, oh, that's good. 

A.6:  So,

B.7:  So you're really planning on, uh, how to, how to manage money from the
beginning and that's a, a good time to start. 

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  Uh, we've been married twenty-five years and, uh, we find that, uh, you
know, money management is, is really important.  We, uh, don't have a lot,

A.10:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.11:  # but # we still, you know, manage it fairly well.  We don't have a formal
budget, uh, we have just found that, uh, by trying to practice, uh, paying our
bills every month, uh, especially our credit card accounts, uh, we don't spend
more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of
that month. 

A.12:  Uh-huh. 

B.13:  Or when the bill comes.  We find that that works pretty well for the most
part [cough].  Excuse me.  Uh, are, are you planning on having a, a real budget
and, and setting up a monthly, monthly amount to spend or,

A.14:  [Breathing]  Uh, I, myself, I don't do it.  I've been paying for my own
college education also for the past four years [laughter]  --

B.15:  Uh-huh. 

A.16:  -- so, uh, and my parents also have been married for twenty-five years and
I kind of picked up what they do.  They really don't have a formal budget like
you do and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in, you know,

B.17:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.18:  # and # they just make sure they don't buy over, and I'm pretty much like
that also.  I don't buy a lot of luxury items.  I buy what I need and I buy it
when it's on sale, you know, and I, I don't go out of the way, but my fiancee,
now he has a set budget that he goes by. 

B.19:  Uh-huh. 

A.20:  And he allots so much to each thing.  And it works out good for him, but I
think whenever, like for the wedding we're doing this, you know, the wedding
money, we're doing together [breathing] And, uh, we've actually sat down and
wrote out how much everything's going to cost and, you know, making sure we
have enough for everything and, going from there.

B.21:  Well, now then, I guess that's really, you know, the, the idea of
budgeting.  We know, you know, how much money's going to be coming in and we
know what we have to spend, so we don't, uh, you know, we don't go out and
spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else.

A.22:  Uh-huh. 

B.23:  And, uh, I guess that's a budget in, in a sense.  It's, it's strange.  I'm
an, accountant and my wife manages most of the money so,

A.24:  [Laughter]. 

B.25:  You know, I manage other people's money, but, or, or you know, help them,

A.26:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.27:  # manage # their money.  So I kind of let her manage ours and then, you
know, if there's any questions come up, you know, we discuss it and work things
out, whatever needs to be worked out. 

A.28:  Uh-huh.  Well, see, uh, well, like I said, he, he does com-, he's with
computer work,

B.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.30:  # and # I'm a finance manager --

B.31:  Uh-huh. 

A.32:  -- but, uh, we decided that we would kind of share, like the books, you
know. 

B.33:  Uh-huh. 

A.34:  He, he, he doesn't like the idea that I would just do all of it.  And I
don't mind, you know, him helping with it either.  I think it's just pretty
much going to be, I think most couples, you know, it's not, it's, it's not
like one person doesn't know what's in there at any time,

B.35:  # Right.  #

A.36:  # you # know. 

B.37:  You, you have to, I think that's the, the, a good idea for both, you know,
both parties to know what the finances are,

A.38:  # Yeah.  #

B.39:  # then # there's not ever any, you know, any question about whether or not
the money can be spent,

A.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.41:  # or # whether it's being spent properly, or if one person knows that, uh,
that, if both parties know that what has to be spent, then there's not going to
be, I've already said that, no questions. 

A.42:  Uh-huh. 

B.43:  And, and then plus if there's any, uh, you know, tragedy, or anything in
the family, then both parties are prepared to, to take over control of the, of
the financial situation,

A.44:  # Yeah.  #

B.45:  # for # themselves if they have to. 

A.46:  Uh-huh. 

B.47:  It's, uh, I've seen it, uh, seen it happen where, you know, people been
married twenty, twenty-five years and [noise] one party or the other managed
the, the money and, you know, something happens and the other one was left not
knowing what was going on. 

A.48:  Uh-huh. 

B.49:  You really need both of them [noise]. 

A.50:  Yeah.  Well, he's been on his own for probably, oh, it's been four years
now.  So he is able, you know, to manage [noise] the money, uh, since we've
decided to get married and stuff, he hasn't been as carefree with his money
like he used to.

B.51:  Uh-huh. 

A.52:  He used to be really carefree with it, and, like I, well, my, my, I came
from a family, we, my mom had twelve children, and my dad didn't start out as
a, out as, with a high paying job, you know.  So she cut pennies wherever she
could.

B.53:  Yeah. 

A.54:  You know, and I, I've learned that from her and, and it's really helping
out now because in the,

B.55:  # Yeah, dis-, #

A.56:  # you know # in the, in a matter of a year and a half we've, we've been
managed to save, it's going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding. 

B.57:  Yeah, well, that's great. 

A.58:  You know, and we're talking five or six thousand dollars,

B.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.60:  # saving # in a year and a half. 

B.61:  Yeah.  That's, that's pretty good and it's, you know, it's good that you've
got that, that, uh, background of, of managing and saving as much as you can
with today's economy --

A.62:  Uh-huh. 

B.63:  -- because, you know, things are so uncertain that you really have to
watch, you know, be prepared to, you know, to cut spending when you have to.

A.64:  Yeah. 

B.65:  But, uh, you know, it's,

A.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.67:  # money # management's really an important thing, you know, with today's,
with the situation the way it is. 

A.68:  Uh-huh.  And I know a, a lot of couples starting out, uh, I don't think
they really think about saving any either.

B.69:  Right. 

A.70:  You know, and, uh, [noise]  now I know, you know as my mom and dad that's
been a big part on them and I think it will be a big part on us, also.  But I
know a lot of couples don't even think about it, or retirement --

B.71:  Right. 

A.72:  -- or, you know, or in case an accident would occur. 

B.73:  Yeah, most, most young, young couples starting out think, uh, well, I've
got, you know forty years [cough] {someone in background} before I need to
think about retirement so they, they plan on waiting [laughter], you know,
half of that time --

A.74:  Uh-huh. 

B.75:  -- and so they wind up when they, you know, twenty years later and they've
already reached that point where they're spending everything they're making,

A.76:  Yeah, and they say oh, well, we have the money we might as well spend it
now [laughter].

B.77:  Yeah.  And they, well, they, they got their, uh, their lifestyle geared to,
to spending everything and they can't cut back enough to start saving so,

A.78:  Uh-huh. 

B.79:  If you cut back to start with, you, you know, you'll find you'll be
surprised at how easy it is to, you know, if you start off saving and just
continue to do that. 

A.80:  Yeah, it is really pretty easy.  I mean, myself, I'm a college student and
I get loans, you know, I, I don't receive grants, but I do have loans,

B.81:  # Um, uh-huh.  #

A.82:  # and just # in the matter since, uh, Christmas I've managed to pay about
five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself. 

B.83:  Uh-huh. 

A.84:  You know, and it, it's amazing where you can cut your pennies and, you
know,

@@B.85:  Yeah.  So that's, that's real good.  Well, any other, anything else that
we want to talk about on budgeting?

A.86:  [Cough] {in background} No I,

B.87:  We seem to agree on everything. 

A.88:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.89:  [Laughter] That's, that's good.  Every once in a while you find somebody on
these conversations that you don't agree with everything.

A.90:  Uh-huh. 

B.91:  Have to bite your tongue, but [laughter], 

A.92:  [Laughter]  Well, I really can't think of anything else on it. 

B.93:  Okay.  Well, it's been nice talking to you. 

A.94:  It's been really nice talking to you, too. 

B.95:  Yeah, okay.  Thank you. 

A.96:  Uh-huh. 

B.97:  Bye-bye. 

A.98:  Bye-bye.
