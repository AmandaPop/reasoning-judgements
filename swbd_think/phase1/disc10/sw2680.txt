Speaker A volume was not steady, sometimes difficult to hear.  
At times, Speaker B was noticeably louder.

===========================================================================

B.1:  Hello. 

A.2:  Hello. 

B.3:  Hi. 

A.4:  Hi, I'm Sally. 

B.5:  I'm Jerry Crow. 

A.6:  Nice to meet you. 

B.7:  And, uh, I made a mistake, I went ahead and punched one, so we're on. 

A.8:  Okay, all righty. 

@B.9:  Okay.  The trial by jury. 

A.10:  Yes. 

B.11:  Uh, my thinking on the, uh, uh, unanimous decision, I think they should
only, I think they ought to change that to only in death penalties.  That it be
a --

A.12:  Uh-huh. 

B.13:  -- unam-, unanimous.  I think in the others they ought to have, not a
majority, but say three fourths or something like that. 

A.14:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.15:  Because too many times they get hung up. 

A.16:  Yes.  And then there's a mistrial, right?

B.17:  And there's a mistrial. 

A.18:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I agree with that, I really do.  I, you know, there're two
ki-, sides to everything.  And, and I, you know, I was, I've never been on a
jury.  I've been interviewed a couple of times but I never got picked.

B.19:  Yeah. 

A.20:  And, uh, I just really have mixed feelings about it.  Because I, you know,
I, I'm not sure that I'm for the death penalty.  And yet when I think if
something happened to one of the members of my family, if somebody, you know,
killed them or brutally beat them, or whatever, uh, uh, and killed them, I, I
don't know that I would be able to say that. 

B.21:  Yeah. 

A.22:  So, you know, it's, I have mixed feelings.  So if, if I were to ever serve
on a jury I would have to be honest about that.  I'm not sure that I could give
somebody the death penalty. 

B.23:  Yeah. 

A.24:  And, and so I'm not, you know, I agree with you, I think that, uh, that,
uh, a majority for, uh, you know, a less severe case would be okay.  But I
think for a death penalty, it would be, have to be everybody.

B.25:  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm not so sure that, well, uh, it would cost a lot more.
But I'm not so sure that, life in, life without parole is not the stiffer
pren-, --

A.26:  I agree. 

B.27:  -- penalty than the death penalty. 

A.28:  Uh-huh. 

B.29:  But,

A.30:  I've always said that.  I, you know, I, I think that would be the stiffer
penalty, but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that,

B.31:  Yeah, yeah.  Plus it, uh, it would cost the taxpayers quite --

A.32:  Exactly,

B.33:  -- a bit # more money.# 

A.34:  # Exactly.  And # -- 

B.35:  And, uh,

A.36:  -- and yet on the other hand, you, I feel so badly when I see people, when
I read about people in the paper that have gotten out when they've raped
somebody or beat somebody, or aggravated assault, or whatever.  And they're
out in, you know, a few weeks or a month --

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  -- or, I think that's criminal because m-, most chances are they'll do it
again.  But they have to let them out in order to make room for other people. 

B.39:  Make room for others. 

A.40:  And if you, they also mentioned about a judge, you know, doing --

B.41:  Yeah. 

A.42:  -- the verdict.  Well, I had an experience with that.  Because my, I have a
brother-in-law that was, uh, di-, made a mistake.  And he, uh, was working as
a financial pla-, planner, and they, the, the company he was working for did a
few things that was against the law.  And the Internal Revenue found, you
know,

B.43:  # Yeah.  #

A.44:  # found # out and prosecuted them.  And he ended up going to jail.  And
he's a wonderful man.  And the bottom line was that he was greedy, he, money
and all that stuff.  But when, when he went to jail, I saw the, the side that
I had never seen before, because we would go and visit him.  And the judge was
the one that was [buzz] not lenient with him.  He really throw, threw the book
at him even though he w-, he had so many character witnesses and so many
people that, that came forth for him.  And he was tough.

B.45:  Yeah. 

A.46: And so sometimes, probably the judge might be a little bit more sev-,
severe than the jury would.

B.47:  Yeah,

A.48:  # Because # --

B.49:  # I, #

A.50:  -- don't,

B.51:  That's the problem I have with the judge giving sentence, is that there's
not consistency. 

A.52:  Exactly. 

B.53:  Uh, it varies even from state to state and even within state. 

A.54:  Uh-huh. 

B.55:  Because I remember, I was watching, uh, I think it was either HARD COPY, or
CURRENT AFFAIRS,

A.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.57:  # one # of those programs --

A.58:  Uh-huh. 

B.59:  -- last night. 

A.60:  Uh-huh. 

B.61:  And this poor, uh, immigrant had bought some land and had cleared the land.
There was, uh, uh, uh, fill there.  People had use-, thrown old tires --

A.62:  Uh-huh. 

B.63:  -- and junk and everything else in the land.  And they prosecuted this guy
and fined him like, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something like
that [noise], 

A.64:  Oh. 

B.65:  for disturbing water lands. 

A.66:  Oh, my word. 

B.67:  And he cleaned it up.  It was even cleaner than when he bought it. 

A.68:  Isn't that awful?

B.69:  And it's just, you know, ridiculous.  And --

A.70:  Yeah. 

B.71:  -- uh,

A.72:  And, you know, I also feel like if a judge has, has the last say, I don't
care what job you're in, you know, what social service type job.  I'm a
teacher.  After a while, unless you really watch it, you begin, become
hardened to people's problems.  And they don't quite mean as much to you.  You
detached yourself from them.  And I think that might happen with judges too.

B.73:  Yeah. 

A.74:  I think that they, they wouldn't be too lenient with certain people,
because they're, they're so hardened to the fact that, you know, there's a
reason why all this happened.

B.75:  Yeah. 

A.76:  And they don't want to hear the story anymore.  They just want them to, you
know, go to jail or be punished. 

B.77:  Yeah. 

A.78:  So I agree with you.  I'm not too sure I would like to have a judge be the
sole, you know, delegate of, uh,

B.79:  # Right.  #

A.80:  # of # a, a sentence. 

B.81:  I just, uh, like you say, I jus-, I just hear too many cases of, of
somebody committing a small or a, a minor crime and getting a much stiffer
penal-, penalty than someone else that commits a major crime and gets off
lightly.

A.82:  Yeah.  And especially, and I hate to say this, but especially if he's a
minority or she's --

B.83:  Right. 

A.84:  -- a minority. 

B.85:  Right. 

A.86:  Uh, people have a tendency to automatically sentence people that are Black
or, or Mexican or any kind of an --

B.87:  Yeah. 

A.88:  -- immigrant before they've even heard.  And that's sad that, a sad
commentary on our times, but it happens. 

B.89:  And, uh, also they didn't say anything to talk about it, but, uh, the rich
people can hire the, the, uh, top notch lawyers. 

A.90:  Right. 

B.91:  And the poor folk is more or less at the court's mercy. 

A.92:  Exactly.  And, and the rich people get off the hook. 

B.93:  Right. 

A.94:  It's, it really is sad.  But have --

B.95:  But, I guess,

A.96:  -- you ever served on a tr-, on a jury?

B.97:  M-, ma'am?

A.98:  Have you ever served on a jury?

B.99:  I've got, uh, I got a summons before, but I never got selected.  I was like
you, I spent all day down at the courthouse --

A.100:  [Laughter]  Yeah, but --

B.101:  -- sitting there. 

A.102:  -- didn't get selected. 

B.103:  And didn't get selected. 

A.104:  Uh-huh.  Well, I always thought that it would be real interesting.  But --

B.105:  Yeah. 

A.106:  -- one, the one, one of the ones that I was, came down for was, had to do
with, uh, drunken driving.  And, uh, you know, I don't think I could be partial
in a case like that.  I ju-, I just, uh, feel like, that, that you just
shouldn't drink and drive. 

B.107:  Yeah. 

A.108:  And, and I, I could not be lenient at all.  And they asked me a couple of
questions and I think, you know, they came [laughter]  to the conclusion I
couldn't. 

B.109:  Yeah. 

A.110:  You know, I would, I'd probably throw the book at a person that, that
harmed somebody drinking and driving.  So,

B.111:  Yeah.  The only one I, I, got, uh, not selected, but as a, as a, uh,
perspective jury member was, uh, a, uh, rear end collision. 

A.112:  ((Row)). Uh-huh. 

B.113:  And of course, I guess there was probably thirty people or forty [noise] 
people there, and they called them down. 

A.114:  Uh-huh. 

B.115:  And they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up. 
And I had.  And, uh, I think they,

A.116:  # Right away they, #

B.117:  # right away they # said, Well, this guy won't, uh, give [/noise]  --

A.118:  Yeah. 

B.119:  -- a, uh, won't, won't, will be partial. 

A.120:  Yeah.  I'm sure that's true.  I'm sure that's true.  Well, and it's, the
law is, is very tricky and, and we all come from different backgrounds and we
come from different experiences.  And so we bring to that jury different
perspectives, which in a way is good.  Because if we all thought the same way,
a person that was, uh, possibly innocent or possibly not as guilty as, you
know, as,

B.121:  # Yeah.  #

A.122:  # uh, # you might think, would, you know, get the book thrown at them or
whatever because we're all, we all feel the same way but I know th-, I have
some friends that have been on jurys that have been deadlocked and it's no
fun.  I mean,

B.123:  # Yeah, #

A.124:  # because, #

B.125:  yeah.  I wouldn't want to be se-, sequestered for --

A.126:  No. 

B.127:  -- a week, and be locked up in a hotel or a motel or hotel or whatever. 

A.128:  That's right.  And especially hard on the people that are not, along, going
along with the majority. 

B.129:  Right. 

A.130:  Because the, the other jurors get so angry because they want to go on with
their life, they want to get out of there.  And if you don't truly believe what
you think and stick to your guns, it can be awful uncomfortable. 

B.131:  Right. 

A.132:  So,

B.133:  And, uh, I guess, uh, I'm fortunately in working for Texas Instruments,
should you get hung on a jury, you do get, get your normal pay. 

A.134:  Oh, is that right?

B.135:  Yeah. 

A.136:  Oh, that's good. 

B.137:  So,

A.138:  Yes, same, with, I'm a teacher, and, and we do too [beep]. 

B.139:  Yeah. 

A.140:  So, which is --

B.141:  It would be --

A.142:  -- gr-, is great. 

B.143:  -- hard on a person that, uh, if he did not get that pay to get locked up
for two or three weeks on a hung jury.  And be out the time on the jury plus
missing his pay check. 

A.144:  Oh, wouldn't that be awful?

B.145:  Yeah. 

A.146:  Yeah, that would be terrible. 

B.147:  But, I guess, I guess it's, like, like a lot of other things in, in states.
Uh, it's not perfect, but it's better than anything else is,

A.148:  # Exactly, yeah.  #

B.149:  # that's out # there. 

A.150:  You're right, you're right.  And we just kind of have to, to go along with
it and do the best job we can if we're called.  It is a duty.  A lot of people
I know try to get out of jury duty when they're s-,

B.151:  # Yeah.  #

A.152:  # you # know.  And I would never do that because I feel like, hey, we live
in a country where we have this, you know,

B.153:  # Right.  #

A.154:  # privilege.  # And I would never, that's my duty to be as a citizen of the
United States.  And if I got called, I'd do it.  But some people don't feel
that way.

B.155:  Yeah.  All you got to do is read in the paper every once in a while and see
where somebody went down to Mexico and had a car accident, and got thrown in
jail, and spent two or three years there. 

A.156:  Oh, gosh.  Isn't that awf-, that'd be awful. 

B.157:  Yeah. 

A.158:  Yeah, we're lucky to live in the United States.  There's [beep] no doubt
about it. 

B.159:  Yeah.  But, uh,

@@A.160:  But, let's see, I really don't have anything else to say about jury con,

B.161:  I, I believe I'm about, uh, exhausted [laughter], 

A.162:  Okay.  [laughter]  Well, it was good to talk to you. 

B.163:  Okay, you too. 

A.164:  All right. 

B.165:  And you have a good day. 

A.166:  You too, Bye-bye. 

B.167:  Bye-bye.
