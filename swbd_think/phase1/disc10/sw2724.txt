============================================================

B.1:   Uh, so what do you do to exercise?  

A.2:   Uh, s-, I, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day
off.  

B.3:   Uh-huh.  

A.4:   I, uh, ride bicycles, [breathing], uh, fifteen, twenty
miles, I don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week. 
I play basketball, uh, couple times a week.  I play softball one
night a week.  Uh, that's what I do.  

B.5:   Um.  

A.6:   What about yourself?  

B.7:   That's pretty impressive.  Uh, I guess I bicycle.  Uh, the
amount varies as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week.  

A.8:   Uh-huh.  

B.9:   Uh, I guess a play softball one night a week.  And I
backpack a lot over the summer.  

A.10:   Oh, really?  

B.11:   Yeah, that's, that's about the extent of it.  I mean, I
don't do any of those things particularly, you know, for
exercise.  But, uh, I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll
sort of, like, do if I feel like I need to go exercise [breathing].
Uh, but I do it mostly for fun.  

A.12:   Yeah, uh, what do you ride, uh, like, a bunch of hills or
pretty flat?  

B.13:   It, it, it varies.  Uh, out near my house is pretty hilly. 
Uh, but sometimes I bike to work which is about, uh, a fifteen
mile trip each way.  And that's mostly flat.  

A.14:   How long does that take you to get to work?   

B.15:   Uh, about forty-five, fifty minutes.  

A.16:   How d-, how does that work, work out with, uh, storing your
bike and showering and all that?  

B.17:   Yeah, it can be a pain.  Uh, basically, uh, I work on a
campus so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the,
uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there -- 

A.18:   Uh-huh.  

B.19:   -- uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that I did it
consistently one year, I would commute every day, uh, but it just
became such a pain.  I mean we're talking, you know, forty-five,
fifty minutes for biking, 

A.20:   Right.  

B.21:  uh, and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind.  And then
another half an hour, you know to cool down and take a shower and
all this kind of stuff.  It was a big hunk, hunk of the day
[breathing].  Uh, and then of course another hour to get back
home.  Uh, so I've been doing that less, and, and concentrating
more on, you know, light biking when I get home on the evening
and then, you know, some more on the weekends.  

A.22:   Yeah.  Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around
there?  

B.23:   Not so much.  Uh, I guess mostly I bike on my own.  I've got
a touring bike.  

A.24:   Uh-huh.  

B.25:   Uh, though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it. 
How about you, what kind of biking do you do?  

A.26:   Uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it and I did an,
did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in
Dallas, 

B.27:   Uh-huh.  

A.28:  the Cooper Clinic, and I learned all the health benefits of,
you know, I was a solid weight trainer, 

B.29:   Uh-huh.  

A.30:  and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise and then my
wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to
do it, so, 

B.31:   Uh-huh.  

A.32:  once I got into this, uh, internship, I learned all the
physiological ad-, advan-, advantages to it, so I began a program
couple, I don't know probably three or four weeks ago and I did
my first bike rally this Saturday.  I did, uh, forty, forty
miles, 

B.33:   Um.   

A.34:  and, uh, that's the longest I've ever ridden so far, I
usually, you know, fifteen or twenty.  

B.35:   Uh-huh.  

A.36:   And it was, it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough,
but, uh, I'm looking at, uh, doing a lot more of it because, you
know, my wife is really into it, 

B.37:   Oh, I see.  

A.38:  and I, I kind of held her back a little bit this, this
weekend.  She wanted to go, go, go, but, 

B.39:   Uh-huh.  

A.40:  you know, she wanted to stay with me [breathing].  

B.41:   It's good to have a partner.  

A.42:   Yeah it really is.  

B.43:   Are you think of doing any, like, centuries, or ... 

A.44:   Yeah, that would be cool sometime if I could, you know, work
up to that.  

B.45:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, I just wondered if you were going to do that
mostly or more like, you know, uh, [breathing] uh, touring
like from Vermont or, you know, that kind of, 

A.46:   Oh. 

B.47:  thing.  I mean people seem to get into different aspects. 
One is more of a distance, and one's more, just, you know, they
want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.  

A.48:   I've never really looked into that.  That, you know, that's,
my wife would just love that.  

B.49:   Uh-huh.  

A.50:   And I may do that sometime.  There again, I'm just kind of a
fledgling into this.  

B.51:   Uh-huh.  

A.52:   I've, it's kind of funny.  I called this number and I was
just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the
different tours coming up.  

B.53:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.54:   I mean, around Texas, you, you got about five or six, if you
live around the Dallas area, you got five or six every weekend to
choose from.  

B.55:   Oh, that's nice.  

A.56:   Because they're really into it.  

B.57:   Um.  

A.58:   Bicycling is really big here.  I didn't know that, and, you
know, until I came down here, and, 

B.59:   Wow. 

A.60:  kind of caught the fever.  

B.61:   Yeah.  

A.62:   Because I lived in Indiana all my life and, you know, you
may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, or above the age
of fifteen or something, -- 

B.63:   Uh-huh.  

A.64:   -- but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is
down here.  

B.65:   Yeah, I'm not sure why that is.  I mean, generally in the
Midwest it seems to be less, much less.  I mean, maybe it's
because of the winters.  

A.66:   Probably.  

B.67:   Uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot
more flat lands, you know, out in the West.  

A.68:   Yeah.  

B.69:   So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.

A.70:   Yeah.  It, there's a lot of bikers around here.  It's, it's
really neat. 

B.71:   Uh-huh.

A.72:   There are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines,
and stuff, little TEXAS BICYCLIST, is like a little newspaper
that comes out every month.  

B.73:   Um.  

A.74:   It's free just go to the bike shock, bi-, bike shop and pick
it up, and it's got all the rides coming up, so I guess I'm going
to be busy about every Saturday this summer, 

B.75:   Oh, that's terrific.  

A.76:  going to a different ride.  Yeah, see a little bit of Texas
I've never seen before.  

B.77:   Uh-huh.  

A.78:   So, uh, how long have you been biking?  

B.79:   Oh, I guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three
years or so [breathing].  Uh, you know, I guess last time I
did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago.   

A.80:   Yeah.  

B.81:   And, uh, yeah, I guess I just never really thought about it
much for a while, uh, until I suddenly discovered all my friends
were basically biking a lot.  And so I thought I'd try it, too.  

A.82:   Have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the
subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done recently or
since you've been biking, 

B.83:   No, I haven't, no.  

A.84:  to see if it, because it really, from what I understand, it
really improves your, uh, cholesterol -- 

B.85:   Um.  

A.86:   -- and, you know, it, uh, [breathing] it kind of knocks
down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease
which is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you
know, the cholesterol.

B.87:   Uh-huh.  

A.88:   It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls. 

B.89:   Oh, that's great.  

A.90:   Yeah, so ... 

B.91:   Yeah, I've, I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect
on my pulse rate, my resting pulse.  

A.92:   Yeah.  

B.93:   You know, it gets it down to about forty.  

A.94:   Really?  

B.95:   Yeah.  

A.96:   That's good.  

B.97:   Yeah.  

A.98:   You say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a
week?  

B.99:   Yeah.  

A.100:   Man.  That's, that's hard-core. 

B.101:   On average, yeah.

A.102:   When do you get to begin with the winters and all that? 
What time of the year do you usually embark on your, do you ride
inside if you can't ride outside?  

B.103:   No, I'm not that hard-core.  I mean there are some people,
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow.  They've
got a, uh, mountain bike, 

A.104:   [laughter].  

B.105:  you know, with the big knobby tires.  

A.106:   Yeah.  

B.107:   And, I don't do that.  I basically, I, I pretty much lay off
for the winter.  Uh, I was thinking of getting rollers for the
last winter, you know, because it will help your balance when
you're indoor training.  

A.108:   Um.  

B.109:   Uh, but I just, you know, more or less stocked, like an
exercise bike and that kind of thing.  [breathing], uh, but,
yeah, I mean winters are kind of a problem so, I'm more or less
out of shape now that I've been biking, I guess, this year for
just a couple of weeks.  

A.110:   Uh-huh. 

B.111:   Uh, but, you know, up here [laughter], it's only stopped
snowing since then.  

A.112:   Yeah.  

B.113:   Uh, [lipsmack], but, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty
good.  It's, uh, the main, the main thing, I guess, for me is
just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know,
exercise and a chore [laughter], I'll lay off it more.  

A.114:   Right.  So you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep 
a ... 

B.115:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  I try to go someplace pretty different, you
know, every week.  I rotate around, uh, about four different
routes, uh, from my house or I'll sometimes come in the school. 
It's nice coming, it's, it's nice riding to school because it's
all along a canal path [breathing], uh, because it's just,
it's along the Erie Canal up here.  

A.116:   So, what school is it?  

B.117:   Uh, University of Rochester.  

A.118:   Oh, okay.  Yeah.  

B.119:   So it's fairly picturesque.  

A.120:   Yeah.  

B.121:   And, uh, so it's, it's, it's a good ride as long as you're
not doing it every day, it's a good ride [laughter]. 

A.122:   Yeah.  That's true.  Sounds neat.  

B.123:   Yeah.  

A.124:   It's kind of, I was wondering if I was going to talk with
someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and
everything else, but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty
miles a week.  That's, uh, motivating.  

B.125:   Yeah.   

A.126:   That's really good.  Well -- 

B.127:   Oh, it was good talking to you.  

A.128:   -- good talking to you and keep up the good work.  

B.129:   Okay, you, too.  

A.130:   All right.  Take care.  

B.131:   Bye.

A.132:   Bye.
