making them difficult to understand.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Ready?

B.2:  Okay, uh, what, what, what, what exactly, we're talking about, uh,

A.3:  # Social changes.  #

B.4:  # industries, trends, # everything?

A.5:  Well, whatever, whatever I guess you want to,

B.6:  # Okay.  #

A.7:  # whether # you think's changed over the last, uh, twenty years. 

B.8:  All right, we'll start twenty years back and come forward, how's that
sound?

@A.9:  All right, good enough.  Here we go. 

B.10:  All right. 

A.11:  Well, uh, let's see, I guess, some of the, some of the things, uh, civil
rights have come a long way, I guess, in the last twenty years. 

B.12:  Well, yeah, I think they have --

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  -- I, I really do.  And it's, it's no longer the issue it once was --

A.15:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.16:  -- and I'm kind of glad, least, I, I hope that's a good sign that, uh, uh,
the times have changed, uh, mo-, to the more equitable at least. 

A.17:  Yeah.  And I guess, I guess, uh, women's rights have come with that, too, I
guess.  So that's, uh,

B.18:  Uh, yeah.  I think they have, too.  I don't think women's rights have come
as far. 

A.19:  Probably not. 

B.20:  Uh, I, I think that, uh, in general women would feel like they still sort
of getting the bum deal compared to, uh, say some of the minority groups.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.22:  Uh, I know my wife would [laughter]. 

A.23:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

B.24:  Yeah, but, uh, I don't know, uh, seems like we come, uh, a long ways in
terms of the, the economies of, of things, uh,

A.25:  [Laughter]  That's true. 

B.26:  If I recall back in the sixties, we didn't tend to run in debt a lot of
time, but we did tend to run in debt with the great society in like seventies,

A.27:  # Yeah.  #

B.28:  # and # so forth.  And then, uh, it looked like we just stayed in some sort
of a e-, e-, economic morass ever since. 

A.29:  That's right.  What's, I guess, uh, part of that was the twenty,
twenty-five years ago Japan wasn't, uh, [noise] hello?

B.30:  Hello.  We're there. 

A.31:  Okay.  That twenty, twenty-five years ago that Japan wasn't, uh, wasn't
what it is now.  So,

B.32:  # Right.  I can re-, #

A.33:  # and that's probably caused # some changes. 

B.34:  Yeah, I can remember in the late sixties, early seventies you couldn't
even, uh, hardly find a Japanese car around --

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  -- and, uh, what few there were around were very ugly looking,

A.37:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.38:  # things, must # have been,

A.39:  Like, uh, like the old Subarus and,

B.40:  Yeah, yeah,

A.41:  # And, uh, old, the old Datsuns.  #

B.42:  # they must have been pretty reliable, # though because some of them they
built up a fairly good following,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # and # it appears that's the case.  Do you own any kind of foreign car?

A.45:  Uh, no we don't, as a matter of fact. 

B.46:  I don't either.  I've always just, uh, I don't know whether you call it buy
American, it's just that I've always bought Fords, and I guess I'll just keep
buying Fords [laughter]. 

A.47:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh [noise]  but, uh,

B.48:  # Uh, but, #

A.49:  # what, what # else has changed.  Oh, I guess, uh, Watergate was in there,
so I guess pol-, politics in general has kind of, kind of gone downhill in the
last,

B.50:  # Well, #

A.51:  # because # I can remember maybe before Nixon that, uh, Presidents were
really up on a pedestal. 

B.52:  Some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone
downhill.  Certain,

A.53:  Yeah, or else we, or else we know about it.  One or the other [laughter]. 

B.54:  Yeah.  In certain respects I feel like that the, uh, uh, Reagan
administration coming right off the Carter administration did tend to bring
back a more aggressive, uh, uh, aspect to the human rights issues,

A.55:  # Yeah.  #

B.56:  # and # the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood
for.  And, and, you know, and, uh, brought it back to the limelight compared to
the sixties and seventies. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  And I think that was a positive, uh, positive thing.  But it seems like,
uh, [breathing] uh, with all that, uh, we never seem to be able to get our
house in order when it comes to the economic things.  I, I bring this back to
that at least, uh.  It seems like we still continue to run, uh, uh, heavy, uh,
in, in, in, indebted budgets and the like.

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  I don't see any real way out of it, either on my end. 

A.61:  No, no.  I, there's no easy answer, that's for sure. 

B.62:  Yeah, well,

A.63:  Or else they would have, uh, done something by now I guess. 

B.64:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.65:  But, uh,

B.66:  I think that's true. 

A.67:  And probably the only other thing I can think of in the last, uh, oh,
twenty years or so I guess is that the family structures have changed a lot.

B.68:  Yeah.  I think they have, too.  Seems like that, uh, the country's mi-,
been more, uh, migratory --

A.69:  Uh-huh, that's true. 

B.70:  -- and fam-, the, the old family structure of the mothers and the
grandmothers and the grandfathers, maybe even some great-, grandparents
occasionally, that seems to have been broken apart pretty, pretty well,

A.71:  # Yeah {faint}. #

B.72:  # including the # family structure as a unit itself. 

A.73:  Yeah, it doesn't seem the norm to have, uh, have parents and, and, uh, the,
two what, two point five kids and all that, that, uh,

B.74:  Yeah, well I hope that's not right.  I do, I do hear these statistics same
as you do,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # and, # uh, and, uh, I, I, I always felt like, at least the immediate
family unit, mother, father, and children was a cohesive structure that was
healthy and was a integral part of what made this country, I don't know, sort
of a stable,

A.77:  # True.  #

B.78:  # country # in terms of discipline, uh, uh, I don't know, some not
necessary discipline, but cert-, social order.

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  That's it. 

A.81:  But, it, it,

B.82:  # And I, I, #

A.83:  # it's sad that # we're, we're losing the grandparents and the uncles that,
that fam-, you know beyond that, families don't seem to get close anymore. 

B.84:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

A.85:  And that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the
migratory,

B.86:  Yeah, in my, my family, I know, most of us are southerners just happen to
be living up in Maryland, though, but my family, uh, we're, we sort of like
our roots,

A.87:  # Yeah.  #

B.88:  # and # like to get back and have family reunions and all that. 

A.89:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.90:  And I think that may not be the norm for s-, a lot of people.  As much as
it is for us, though, to want to do that.

A.91:  I, I think you're right.  I, I think that's, uh, very rare anymore that,
uh, definitely people aren't at family reunions on a regular basis, and, uh, a
lot of them, I guess, don't do it at all so,

B.92:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.93:  Because I know it's been a long, long time since our family ever did
anything like that so,

B.94:  I must say, too, it seems like the whole flavor of, uh, war has changed
considerably when you look at, back at the Vietnam era. 

A.95:  That's true. 

B.96:  And what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the Iraqi
situation.  It seems like, uh, we have, uh, made, uh, uh, uh, uh, a rather, uh,
major about-face in terms of the way we conduct war,

A.97:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.98:  # and # the way we, we, uh, can technologically, uh, uh, carry out a war. 

A.99:  It's, it's, it's easier to, to fight, I guess, when you can find them
[laughter]. 

B.100:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.101:  I remember the problem back then was,

B.102:  # Yeah, #

A.103:  # that # you just couldn't find them. 

B.104:  they're a little hard to hide in that desert. 

A.105:  Yeah.  I mean, uh, not, not,

B.106: Well, uh, then, too, the philosophy is changed.  I was just reading tonight
in the one of the news magazines that you can take.  You know, I, I, I take
NEWSWEEK, TIME, and U S  NEWS AND WOR-, WORLD REPORT, all three, as a
matter of fact.

A.107:  Uh-huh. 

B.108:  And, uh, I was just reading in one of the, uh, the, those news magazines
that, uh, there's a, uh, a movement among certain members of the military
establishment, the upper hierarchy, uh, uh, uh, officer staff to, uh, change
the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of, uh, instead of
meeting the me-, the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feigning and,
and, and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs,

A.109:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # and # things like that, doing more, more smart things that are very
damaging getting in, getting out, uh, making end runs, allowing more
creativity at the lower echelon levels,

A.111:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.112:  # for # people to slip in, slip out and do things, than, uh, has been the
case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the
like. 

A.113:  Uh-huh.  Overpower. 

B.114:  And I think politically we've changed a lot.  I think in the Vietnam war,
uh, we, we, Congress got too much involved in, in trying to manage the war. 

A.115:  Well, it's probably because it lasted so long. 

B.116:  Yeah,

A.117:  # You know, I guess it's, its, #

B.118:  # and that, that's absolutely the wrong # way to, to go, to conduct,

A.119:  # Yeah {faint}. #

B.120:  # a war # in my opinion.  When, when you're in a war, right or wrong you
should let the military establishment handle it.  And, and, and give them the
job that they're paid and supposedly skilled at doing,

A.121:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.122:  # and # let them get on with it instead of tying their hands, which I felt
like was not the case in the Vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the
case of the Iraqi war where they more or less gave it to Schwartzkopf and, and
the rest of the military units and just says, hey, look, handle it,

A.123:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.124:  # and # they did. 

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  And I think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it's
paid to do.  And, uh, it just goes to give me a, a, a feeling that, uh, we did
some things wrong. 

A.127:  Uh-huh. 

B.128:  I think in the Vietnam era, uh, and that, uh, Congress should have stayed
out of it,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # much # as possible [breathing].  But, uh, that I see as a change.  And
then industrially going back, uh, I, I, think, uh, uh, industrially we've
changed.  I think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so,
twenty, ten, of a, uh, a nation that was industrially oriented towards, uh,
manufacturing,

A.131:  # Yeah.  #

B.132:  # type # industries. 

A.133:  More of a,

B.134:  And I think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological
electronics age where it's information,

A.135:  # More information process.# 

B.136:  # and communication, #

A.137:  # Yeah.  #

B.138:  # and, # and computers that is really our next industrial revolution and,
uh, you know, it wouldn't surprise me the least little bit if we didn't see
the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some
degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house.  That being a
base export to third world countries and you mi-, might find even Japan and,
and, uh, uh, major powers like, uh, the, the British and the central European
economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry, uh,
because it's, uh, somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it.
Uh, I, I, I, I'm concerned that that would be the case, instead the more, uh,
advanced nations would tend to get more computerized, more telecommunication
oriented,

A.139:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.140:  # and # the like, and information is, is getting to be, uh, sort of the
thing.  I, I, I think,

A.141:  # Yeah.  #

B.142:  # I # don't know [laughter]. 

A.143:  No, that's true, that's true.  Over the last, uh, twenty years that's, uh,
that's a definite change.  And it's only going to, only going to get worse I
guess in the near future.  Going to be more rapid I guess. 

B.144:  Yeah, I, I think, I, I, I, I think we're made some mistakes, too, for, I
think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of
what's going on industrially.

A.145:  Uh-huh. 

B.146:  And, uh, I'll give you an example.  I was talking about, I've said for
years, because I, I, my background's in physics,

A.147:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.148:  # and, # uh, I've said for years that the education system in this country
has not reacted to what is the actual, uh, uh, uh, industrial evolutionary
state of the country,

A.149:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.150:  # and # by that I mean, when I was going to school, you got your basic
sciences, and, uh, that was pretty much about it. 

A.151:  Yeah. 

B.152:  And, uh, when I got out of school I had to sort of teach myself everything
I've learned, uh, about computers and programming, and, and just, you know, the
whole bit,

A.153:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.154:  # hardware # in general, relative to why you can do things with data
acquisition process and the like [breathing],  and, uh, when I was going to
school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering, or science, or
any of the other scientific fields,

A.155:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.156:  # chemistry # and biology and the like,

A.157:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.158:  # but # you never had to have computers.  And even to this date, in
colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in, in, the
engineering or the science fields,

A.159:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.160:  # unless # you're a computer scientist or,

A.161:  # Or electrical engineer, probably, yeah {faint}. #

B.162:  # or, or someone in that area # and then it is required, of course, because
it is part of the curriculum.  And, uh, just as we have to take at least a year
of English in, in, in colleges and a year of some sort of social study, I think
that it should be required in college in a, in a, uh, uh, science curriculum, I
even think in liberal arts this day and time,

A.163:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.164:  # it # should be required you have to have a year of some sort of,
