==========================================================================

B.1:  Here we go.  I guess we're on the air, huh?

@A.2:  Yep. 

B.3:  Yeah.  Well, I tell you what, this been pretty nice today, hasn't it?

A.4:  Uh, yeah, we've been, uh, real lucky here. 

B.5:  Uh-huh. 

A.6:  It was one of those days where you wish you, uh, you didn't want to have to
go back into work. 

B.7:  Yeah.  I'm, well I'm on, I'm taking some vacation this week, so it didn't
bother me.  Uh, I'm a distance runner by hobby --

A.8:  Uh-huh. 

B.9:  -- and, uh, I might say it was a little humid running out there tonight.  I
was probably wetter than I have been in some time. 

A.10:  Huh [laughter]. 

B.11:  But, uh, for, for a guy that likes to be outside as much as I do and run
like I do, this Texas is almost ideal.  Because, uh, I would say probably I run
three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty-five.  And there's
probably not more than thirty of those days that I can't wear shorts and tee
shirt. 

A.12:  Yeah. 

B.13:  I mean, I have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants. 

A.14:  Yeah. 

B.15:  And that's fine with me.  If I can wear shorts and tee shirt, I'm perfectly
happy. 

A.16:  I remember how the weather was when I was down there.  I got a sunburn in
February working on my, uh, my roof in a house in Plano. 

B.17:  [Laughter]. 

A.18:  So I, uh, I remember how it was.  Yeah, it's, it's really great. 

B.19:  Yeah {faintly}.

A.20:  Um, here on the east coast, we've, you know, we usually have the
traditional April showers.  But it has --

B.21:  Yeah. 

A.22:  -- just been so unusually wet here. 

B.23:  Yeah. 

A.24:  We've had all the rain that they should've had out in California. 

B.25:  [Laughter]  Well, what, what, what we like to do is get enough rain so not
to have to water the lawn. 

A.26:  Yeah. 

B.27:  And it's been, I've watered once in March and not any time in April
because, I figure, we figure if we go five days without rain, we need to
water.  And just about every fifth day, we're getting rain right now.

A.28:  Well, that's great. 

B.29:  So everything is pretty and green here, and we're not really, uh, and not
having to pay money to water.  And, uh, of course, of course summers, summers,
uh, I, I guess, uh, once you get climatized, and I am, I mean I kind of look
forward to the hundred degrees days, except for the air conditioning bills.  I,
I, could, I could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills
[laughter]. 

A.30:  Yeah, I remember those.  Yeah well, we moved into a new house, uh, at the
end of February. 

B.31:  Uh-huh. 

A.32:  And of course, it's a new development and there's only one house in the
whole thirty houses that are here that has grass. 

B.33:  Oh, for goodness --

A.34:  So everything --

B.35:  -- sake.  Oh, I know what that means. 

A.36:  -- everything else is mud. 

B.37:  That means mud in the road, yep [whispering]. 

A.38:  There's mud in the road, there's mud on the sidewalk, there's mud in the
house.  I mean you just can't get away from it.  And of course it's been, you
know, ideal weather for grass to grow. 

B.39:  Oh, sure. 

A.40:  And unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put, they, you know, they
were waiting until they got, I think, the other two houses on the cul-de-sac on
one done, before they're going to plant all the grass at one time.  So,

B.41:  What, what do you, do you put in up there? Do you, I mean, here we know, we
know two grasses, Saint Augustine and Bermuda. 

A.42:  Uh-huh. 

B.43:  Uh, what, what do you normally put in up there?

A.44:  You can put in any number of grasses up here.  Uh, a lot people like the
red fescue.  They like to mix red fescue in with, uh, Kentucky Blue.

B.45:  Huh. 

A.46:  Um, the, uh, my favorite is, uh, a zoysia grass. 

B.47:  Uh-huh. 

A.48:  I, when I lived in Laura, which is about sixty miles south of where I'm
living now, uh, that my neighbor had it.  And I was forever trying to get, you
know, decent grass to grow in my yard, and he talked me into trying to some
plugs of the zoysia.  And I just loved it.  Because the zoysia you can, uh, you
can quite literally just plug it around the yard, and it just spreads and it
chokes out the weeds. 

B.49:  Yeah. 

A.50:  And the weeds can't get in there, and so you don't have to weed and feed
and do all that other crazy stuff you just,

B.51:  Uh-huh. 

A.52:  You know, the only bad part about it is during the winter, the grass is
brown.  But I mean, you know,

B.53:  Oh, that happens here too. 

A.54:  Yeah. 

B.55:  But this year, of course, we got, uh, we had a very mild winter this year
with very little freeze.  Uh, so we didn't have any problem, uh, uh, with the,
uh, uh, with the grass greening up quickly.  You know, last year it was well
into May before all the bare spots got covered. 

A.56:  Uh-huh. 

B.57:  Uh, because of the, of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of
eighty-nine.  But this year it, uh, we did have some cold days, but not down
in the single digits or anything like that.  So when things started greening
up in March, they greened up, and everybody's grass is, is, is perfectly
green.  Do your homes, you say you moved into a new home? Are homes normally
built there with central air conditioning? Is that part of the, uh, the
standard for a home?

A.58:  Yes.  It's pretty much standard now. 

B.59:  Oh, okay.  I, I didn't know whether you were far enough south for that.  Of
course I'm, I'm from New England.  My parents are there, and it's, it's unheard
of there.  I guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a
window unit in [laughter]. 

A.60:  [Laughter] Well, the, uh, the thing about, uh, Maryland is, um, the last
few years, uh, since I've been back, and, uh, it was like that.  Oh, it
started this way about mid-seventies.  Um, we started having a very
abbreviated Spring.

B.61:  Um. 

A.62:  You would go from having fifty, sixty degree days right into the eighty,
eighty-five degree --

B.63:  Yeah. 

A.64:  -- days.  Which, you know, in Texas it's not bad because the humidity --

B.65:  No. 

A.66:  -- is real low.  But here when the temperature is eighty degrees, the
humidity is eighty,

B.67:  Yeah.  The humidity is eighty degrees along with it. 

A.68:  Eighty per cent and, and, and worse.  I mean I've seen days here when the
humidity is like ninety-three, a hundred per cent. 

B.69:  Uh-huh. 

A.70:  And it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world. 

B.71:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm aware of that.  Did you have a very severe winter?

A.72:  Uh, not really.  We had, uh, a couple, uh, real good snow storms. 

B.73:  Um. 

A.74:  Uh, but they were the kind that came, stayed for a couple of days, and then
melted off.  And that's the,

B.75:  # Okay.  #

A.76:  # best # kind to have around here. 

B.77:  Yeah, yeah.  We, we had zero snow here.  In fact, we haven't had any
measurable accumulation now in six or seven years. 

A.78:  Yeah, I remember the, uh, ice storm back in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight. 

B.79:  Yeah.  That was a nice one --

A.80:  Yeah. 

B.81:  -- too.  That was an ice storm there.  And, uh, uh, I remember one year,
and I can't tell you the exact year, it was probably about, uh, eighty,
seventy-nine or eighty, that we had such a severe ice storm that it, uh,
knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some, uh, four hundred
thousand homes out of electricity.

A.82:  Wow. 

B.83:  And I know it was after seventy-eight because we built our home here in
seventy-eight, and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet.  So
we had electricity, and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in
sleeping bags. 

A.84:  Jeez [laughter]. 

B.85:  And, and unfortunately when it thawed, then most everybody's houses got
filled with water too [laughter]. 

A.86:  Oh, God. 

B.87:  And, uh, but we, we were fortunate that year.  And even at that, this
development was built in seventy-eight, and even now, a-, all the utilities run
under ground. 

A.88:  Uh-huh. 

B.89:  So there's still no big trees in the development.  But the, uh, uh, all,
all the utilities, so we, we wouldn't have to look forward to that.  But we
had a, uh, we had a mild winter.  As I say, the previous year, we had three or
four days, uh, i-, it wasn't much, it was only about a week.  And I think it
was the week just prior to Christmas, when the temperature got down into the
single digits.  And as a result, a lot of the, the trees and, uh, the grass
and shrubbery was killed, uh, was killed out.  And at this time last year,
nothing looked very good.  But it, it does right now.  Uh, at this time last
year, we were under water, most of Texas --

A.90:  Yes. 

B.91:  -- was under water. 

A.92:  Yeah.  I remember that. 

B.93:  Uh, if you remember, uh, uh, downtown Dallas, you could go down and look up
in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River, and it looked like
lakes, not a river.  And, uh, Lake Texoma was up, uh, twenty feet over flood
level,

A.94:  # Wow.  #

B.95:  # uh, # at, at this time last year.  It was, it was, uh, it was pretty bad.
But, uh, I'm, I'm hoping, you know, you, you don't want anything to flood, but
you want to get normal rain.  And, uh, we're probably some where near normal
right now.

A.96:  Yeah.  I noticed, uh, tonight when I was out driving around that the, uh,
the one of the main reservoirs in the county I live in is, uh, fuller that I've
ever seen it.  I mean it's, it's up,

B.97:  # Um.  #

A.98:  # over # its banks, but it's not that far over its banks. 

B.99:  How long have you been back in Maryland, from Texas?

A.100:  Uh, moved back here in, uh, eighty-nine. 

B.101:  Eighty-nine, okay. 

A.102:  Yes, I spent two, uh, just about two years exactly in Texas. 

B.103:  Yeah.  And where did you say you lived? In Plano?

A.104:  Yeah.  I lived in Plano. 

B.105:  Uh-huh {faintly}.

A.106:  Um, worked at Spring Creek for a while and was on the moon job.  And then
when my clearance came through for A P D, I worked for D E S E G.  Uh,

B.107:  # Yeah.  #

A.108:  # worked # at North Billings for a while and then down at Love Field. 

B.109:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  That's a nice facility at Spring Creek, isn't it?

A.110:  Oh God, don't,

B.111:  That's the, that's the Taj Mahal of T I [laughter]  facilities. 

A.112:  I tell you, it spoils you rotten to work there.  You --

B.113:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.114:  -- work there and they send you any place else, it's like you've been
demoted. 

B.115:  Well, well we're in the, I don't know if you're familiar with the center
complex, uh, in, in Dallas.  It's across L B J, from the main T I site.  It's
three glass --

A.116:  Right. 

B.117:  -- buildings and that.  For someone that's been at T I thirty-two years,
this is kind of un T I like too [laughter]  And,

A.118:  [Laughter]. 

B.119:  [Laughter]. 

A.120:  I had a, uh, a, uh, an employee that I hired though, Lita Mytek.  Um, Lita
Mytek, I mean.  She, uh, she worked over in the building at Center Three I
think it was.

B.121:  Yeah. 

A.122:  And, uh, you know, she said she liked it over there. 

B.123:  Yeah.  I'm in, I'm in center one.  The big thing that I think other than
the fact that we've all got double the size offices we've ever had anywhere
else, it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop.  To me the big advantage,
and I didn't realize it when we came over here, is the covered parking.  It is
amazing in the middle of the summer when it's a hundred and ten out, to go out
and be able to get into your car and touch the,

A.124:  # [Laughter].  #

B.125:  # steering # wheel.  Which we could never do parked outside of the S C
Building or the South Building or various other places --

A.126:  Yeah. 

B.127:  -- that I've I worked.  And, and, you notice the finish on your car lasts
longer.  When you wash it, it stays clean longer. 

A.128:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

B.129:  Uh, it is, is, uh, uh, to me, to me that's, that's probably one of the
biggest advantages that we've got over there.  Plus I'm in center one and the
credit union is down on the first floor.  And it seems that I'm alway-, always
there.  I've got a daughter away from college, away at college that's always
out of money.

A.130:  [Laughter]. 

B.131:  So, [laughter] it's easy.  I can get down to the credit union quite often.
And, uh, are you looking forward to a hot summer there now?

A.132:  Um, I'd, I'd prefer it not to be that hot. 

B.133:  Uh-huh. 

A.134:  Uh, the days usually aren't, aren't that bad.  Uh, it's just when the
humidity gets up.  I mean, it's, like last week we had a day, it was, I think
it was eighty degrees --

B.135:  Uh-huh. 

A.136:  -- but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent.
And that,

B.137:  Oh, that, that's Texas like. 

A.138:  Yeah, that was a rarity for here.  And God, it was just beautiful. 

B.139:  Did you ever get out to Midland while you were here?

A.140:  No, I never did.
