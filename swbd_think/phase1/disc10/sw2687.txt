===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, have you ever been a victim of any p-, any type of crime?

B.2:  Uh, that's interesting [laughter],

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  because I've talked about this subject before, and it, it didn't come up to
either one of us to act.  Uh, n-, nothing that I would consider major.
Probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is, uh, you
know, like, you know how people throw their change like into, uh, the glove
box or the ash tray of their car?  And one time we had, you know, some kids go
up and down the street and anybody whose car was open, they kind of trashed
that stuff out.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  But they didn't do any vandalism.  And yeah, it bugged me.  But, you know,
when I think of crime and, and things that could happen, I, I guess that was
minor [laughter].

A.7:  Sounds like you've been very fortunate.  I haven't had too many --

B.8:  I have.

A.9:  -- terrible things happen to me, but my tee tops did get stolen one time
off my car.

B.10:  Ah.  That's a very popular pass time up here.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  Do you have a Vette?

A.13:  Uh, no, it's a Transam.

B.14:  A Transam.  Uh, in fact there was a ring, I know that you stop right up
here, and, uh, the police department would call T I security when they knew
they were in town, basically, and say, [laughter] you know, tell all your
folks with Vets and whatever else to be loo-, on the lookout for them.  But
that's expensive,

A.15:  It's very --

B.16:  you know?

A.17:  -- expensive, and insurance companies don't like it either.

B.18:  Yeah.  They don't want to write you.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Uh,

A.21:  Well, I, I did put an alarm on the car after that.  And, uh, I kept that
for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle
of the night for no reason.

B.22:  Oh,

A.23:  And --

B.24:  that's not good.

A.25:  -- it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so I disabled it
[laughter].

B.26:  Well, okay.  Now I, uh, I mean I've had other members of my family touched.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Um, I have had a cousin of mine that was murdered, uh, things like that,
uh, for no apparent reason, you know, it's, that was lost in the country
trying to find her folks new house up in Kansas --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- and stopped to use the phone.  And a teenage kid whose parents had lots
of money,

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  uh, killed her, so nothing was ever done to him.  But so, you know, yeah,
I, I'm not sure there's many lives that aren't affected by it somewhere.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Uh, I don't know what the answers should be, per se.

A.35:  Yeah, you stop and think about what you can do to, uh, to prevent or reduce
crime.  And in fact tonight, uh, alone, I, I got a phone call from one of the
security, uh, uh, systems, home security systems that, uh,

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  install, uh, uh, systems in your home to, uh,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  [Laughter] monitor and, uh, I guess detect, uh, it's, tha-, that type of
break ins.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  They, uh, have a certain fee that they charge each month and an
installation fee, and they're real ho-, hot about, uh, trying to get, uh,
trying to sell these systems to everybody.

B.42:  Yeah.  I, um, I would like a home, alarms, that perimeter alarm system.
I've been very impressed with the one that the Amway Corporation, uh, puts
together.  Because it's, it's as extensive as you want it to be.  You can, you
can kind of coordinate to your own home, you know, however many, uh, types of
devices you need. And it's a wireless system --

A.43:  Do you know what the? 

B.44:  -- so it's not one they can disable.

A.45:  Do you know the name brand is for that?

B.46:  The name?  Amguard.

A.47:  Oh, okay.  That's the, their own personal alarm,

B.48:  Yeah.  They make it.

A.49:  brand.  Okay.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  There are --

B.52:  And,

A.53:  -- several systems like that.  There's one that, uh, uh, employees sale
sold once upon a time, called --

B.54:  Oh.

A.55:  --  Schlage,

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  that's also modular and wireless.  And you can add as many sensors as
you need to.

B.58:  Yeah.  About, my husband, he's like one of these like I want to have
guns.  And guns kind of scare me.  Uh, not so much for me, you know, I feel
like I'm responsible, I'd learn how to use it.  And yes, I could shoot someone
if, you know, they were trying to take my kids or take my life or you
know, I'm basically a nonviolent person, but I could do that.

A.59:  Well, there's s-, some, 

B.60:  But it scares me because of so many accidents that have occurred with
children in the home that find the guns, and, uh, you know, accidentally shoot
a brother or shoot a sister or shoot themselves.  And I'm not real sold on
that yet.

A.61:  Right.  There's also a lot of people who are, end up being victimized by
their own weapons.

B.62:  By their own.

A.63:  A burglar comes in and, uh, finds a gun and ends up using it against the
owners of the house.  So [laughter],

B.64:  Yeah.  Well, are you for, uh, capital punishment?

A.65:  Oh, certainly.  Yeah, depending on the crime.  I think I discussed that at,
at another time [laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] Well, that's interesting that you say that because I am too.
My, my sadness with it occurs that it doesn't seem to be consistent.  You
know, I, I have a hard time putting one person's death for the same crime that
you send the other to jail for.

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  You know, it does to me need to be consistent, but, uh, I, I, 

A.69:  Well, it's such a waste of taxpayers' money too, to put them in prison for
life.

B.70:  For life.

A.71:  Uh, especially if there's no chance of parole.

B.72:  That's true,

A.73:  So [laughter],

B.74:  that's true.

A.75:  Uh,

B.76:  Of course my husband's of the mind that you ought to take them all out in
the back alley and shoot them.

A.77:  Sometimes that's,

B.78:  [Laughter]

A.79:  the best solution, I guess.

B.80:  I don't know, I guess I have a little bit more compassion.  I do think they
ought to have their day in court.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Only because there have been ones sent away that didn't do it.  But I know
that's few and far between.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  I, uh, I don't know the answer.  You know, I have always thought that maybe
the answer to the dope problem that, you know, generates so much of the crime
is, you know, is always, you know, shoot the dealers.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  And somebody made the, you know, take away the supply.  But somebody made a
comment to me a couple of months ago that's kind of had me thinking.  He said,
Somebody else will come up with the supply.  He said what you have to do is,
you know, shoot or make it hard on the users.  Because if the demand is gone
they won't have anybody to supply to.  Well, that makes a little bit of sense.

A.87:  Well, it makes some sense.  But, uh, the, the users end up being addicts
and they, uh, they commit --

B.88:  Sure.

A.89:  -- crimes for, for a living to make the, the cash to buy their drugs with
so, 

B.90:  Sure.

A.91:  Uh, and they have no respect or, for, for any other people anyway.

B.92:  That's true.  But where was it?  Uh, oh, several years ago, and I want to
say like Malaysia or something with an M.  Madagascar or somewhere, [laughter]
a small country, uh, you know, it's, it's a crime punishable b-, by death to
them, to be carrying anything.  And I think some British citizens had gone in,
like, uh, a lady and her son, and they had some marijuana on them.  And they
hung them.

A.93:  Oh, that was in Malaysia, and they, they were two,

B.94:  Was that Malaysia?

A.95:  two guys from Australia.

B.96:  Okay.  I knew it was something like that.  And I thought, jeez that seemed
so severe for marijuana.  But then I thought, or is that just because, uh, I
have become accustomed to other things, in hearing other things.  You know, if
I knew two of my friends got hung for carrying a little bit of marijuana, it
might make me think twice before I ever did it, if I was of the mind to, you
know?

A.97:  Right.

B.98:  So I don't know what the answers are.  But I, I do feel like, I do feel
like when they're blatant criminals and they've got records that it seems like
the system protects them more than it helps --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- the others.

A.101:  Well, we're not the only country that has a, a drug problem [laughter].

B.102:  No,  we're not.

A.103:  A lot of, a lot of countries do, especially smaller third world nations.
And their governments, uh, strictly enforce, uh,

B.104:  Death.

A.105:  policies against, uh, drug use and, uh,

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  uh, dealing and things like that.  So, yeah, the death penalty, uh, exists,
and it is put in force.

B.108:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I know that, you know, I remember growing up, and,
uh, you know, we'd leave the house open if we were in the house.  Yeah, if we
went somewhere, I grew up in a large, I grew up in San Diego.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  You know, if we went somewhere, sure, we'd lock the doors.  If it was just
down the street, we wouldn't.  {echo} Or if we were in the house, we wouldn't.
But now, you know, I come home, I lock the door.  If we open the door, I lock
the screen door.  You know,

A.111:  Right.

B.112:  I want it locked when I'm in it, every time I go somewhere.  And I, I just
almost hate that feeling.

A.113:  Well, you make a habit out of it, and it's a tolerable situation.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  Uh, I also grew up in, in a rural area, and my, a lot of my relatives are
on dairy farms.  They would leave the house unattended, unlocked, [laughter]
just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in, they would anyway,
and there wasn't much of value to take any way.  So [laughter],

B.116:  Well, that's one way to look at it, isn't it.  Where'd you grow up?

A.117:  Uh, up in, uh,  Wisconsin.

B.118:  Oh, okay.  Umm.  Excuse me.

A.119:  But I've been fortunate, I guess, in that the only things that have
happened to me are, the tee tops and hubcaps off cars.  Well,

B.120:  Yeah, that's pretty minor, when I think that some people give their lives
[laughter].

A.121:  Sure, uh-huh.

B.122:  So, I don't know the answers though.  I, I, I do wish we had a system that
was a bit more fair.

A.123:  Yeah.  And, and Plano is pretty good about it too.  They've got excellent,
uh, police force here.  And, uh, I haven't seen any, any evidence of, uh, any,
uh, mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood --

B.124:  Oh, well that's good [laughter].

A.125:  -- the suburbs.  It's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city.
Dallas is pretty bad.

B.126:  Right, I'm sure that's true.  I'm sure that's true.  I do know that our
neighbor across the street, our development is probably only eight years old.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Maybe not that long.  We've lived here six years.  Probably seven years
old.  And the, the house across the street, you know, she walked in one night
on somebody.  And of course he left.  She was fortunate.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  But things like that make it real to me and aware that it really is going
on.

A.131:  Right.

B.132:  You know, that's it not a fairy tale world here [laughter].

A.133:  That's right.  Yeah, I know people that have been victimized too, a lot
more seriously.

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  It's, uh, it's not pleasant to think about that, and, uh, you have to live
with that forever so, 

B.136:  That's true.  Well,

@@A.137:  Yeah, I enjoyed talking to you about the subject, uh,

B.138:  And I appreciate you calling.  It's Gary, right?

A.139:  Yes.

B.140:  Thank you very much.

A.141:  Okay,

B.142:  Huh.

A.143:  have a good evening.

B.144:  You too.

A.145:  Sure.

B.146:  Bye.

A.147:  Bye.
