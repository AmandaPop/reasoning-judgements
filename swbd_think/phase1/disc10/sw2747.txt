@A.1:  Okay, Jim, uh, what are they doing down in your neck of the woods for
recycling?

B.2:  We have recently, the city of Plano has started a, a situation, it's pretty
much volunteer as far as separating, oh, paper and bottles, and, you know, cans
and that sort of thing. 

A.3:  Yeah. 

B.4:  And it's not exactly curbside yet.  They've got these little igloo like
things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if
you want to.  The biggest thing that they've done is, uh, for, forever we had
been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just, uh, put in,
uh, plastic bags then set out in the alley.  But, uh, they came through with
these big green, uh, plastic dumpster kind of things, uh, where you put
everything except lawn trash.  And then they [cough],  we got these, uh, paper
sacks to put, uh, lawn debris and stuff in.  Supposedly, uh, you know, it can
all be mulched at once, the paper sack and everything.  Only problem is you
can't get anything in the paper sack [laughter]. 

A.5:  Oh, that's, they're, they're too small?

B.6:  Yeah, they're too small on the top and they're, they're smaller than most
grass catchers and that sort of thing, so.  They just started this, uh, oh,
maybe a month or two ago and, uh, they, uh, the local folks, you know, they're
just starting to use them now that the grass is starting to, you know, be cut
and everything.  We're --

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  -- getting a lot of complaints about them, but, uh, [breathing]  you know,
I, I realize the whole, the whole recycling trash thing is a, is such a problem
because the landfill and all that. 

A.9:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.10:  Uh,

A.11:  Right, uh. 

B.12:  I don't know what, are they, they're probably doing more than that up
there.  I'm, I guess you all started this sort of thing long time before we
did. 

A.13:  Yeah, well up, Massachusetts, I live in Rhode Island. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  And, you know, I travel back and forth, which isn't too far.  It's only, I
only live about, uh, about eight miles from the plant. 

B.16:  Oh. 

A.17:  So I live right up in the, uh, in the northeast corner of Rhode Island. 

B.18:  Oh. 

A.19:  And, and the plant is, is in, uh, is in the like the south, uh, southwest
section of Massachusetts.  It comes down like kind of a neck, so,

B.20:  # Yeah.  #

A.21:  # I # don't have for to travel, but I live in a rural community, and last
year we started recycling.  They made it mandatory in, in our town. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  And they gave you, uh, uh, little blue containers that you put all your,
your, uh, your bottles and cans and like the plastic milk jugs. 

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  You put those in there and they recycle those [throat_clearing],  and then
you put your newspapers in a separate, or either you put them in a, a paper bag
or, or you tie them up with string.  You put those in a separate bundle.  And
they have a special truck that comes around and they pick them up curbside. 

B.26:  Um, uh-huh. 

A.27:  And then the rest of it is just, you know, goes to the landfill, I guess,
or whatever, whatever they incinerate it maybe.

B.28:  Yeah, we, uh, we're coming to that here, you know, in the metroplex is
getting big enough that, uh, it'll happen.  I, I grew up a, uh, kind of a, a
rural area of, of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasn't a problem. 

A.29:  Oh, yeah. 

B.30:  Matter of fact, till recently we burned trash, you know, we had the big
barrels out in, in the alley. 

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  And when it's filled up you just put a match to it and burned it. 

A.33:  And that's, [throat_clearing]  right. 

B.34:  Well, course, that's, that's almost unheard of anymore. 

A.35:  That's what we used to do, too, years ago. 

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  We used to do the same thing. 

B.38:  Yeah, we used to burn leaves and burn grass, you know, and all that.  As
far as what to, uh, to do to encourage recycling, I guess a lot of states I
have noticed on, uh, on Coke bottles and, and whatnot, we went, I've got some
relatives in Iowa, and, uh, there's a big thing up there, what is it, nickel
for every bottle or,

A.39:  # Yep [throat_clearing].  #

B.40:  # some such # thing. 

A.41:  Yeah, we do the same. 

B.42:  Yeah people,

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  People actively go out and, and, uh, seek them, you know I guess that's one
way of doing it, you know is to make it worthwhile. 

A.45:  Yeah, all the states around us, Connecticut, uh, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, I think Vermont and Maine do it.  Rhode Island's the only state that
doesn't put a nickel deposit on the bottles. 

B.46:  Um. 

A.47:  But, every other state does so you don't, you don't see any trash along the
sides of the roads, people that throw bottles away, there's other people that
come along with plastic bags and they pick them up (( )).

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  And I guess they can make a, a, you know, it's like working a part-time
job. 

B.50:  Yeah. 

A.51:  Uh, it's all free.  Just takes time, and if you're retired and have nothing
to do, uh,

B.52:  Well, course there's, uh, people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down
here because it's just, uh, there's not a per can value on them, but there is
a,

A.53:  Oh, just on the metal content. 

B.54:  Just in the metal. 

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  Recycling itself, I've,

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  I, I'm not sure what it's, what a can is worth now.  It's couple cents, you
know, you've to get quite a few of them to really make it worthwhile but,

A.59:  # Make it worth it, yeah.  #

B.60:  # it turns out that, uh, # on a, a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday
night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road,

A.61:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

B.62:  # to make # it worthwhile. 

A.63:  Uh, my wife and I both graduated from the University of Rhode Island --

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  -- their, uh, master gardener program --

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  -- I guess every state has, has, uh, uh, a land grant college, uh, used to
be Brown University, now it's, uh, University of Rhode Island. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  And what we learned down there is that, uh, [throat_clearing]  fifty
percent, when you, when you mow your lawn, fifty percent of all the nutrients
are in that top section of the grass --

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  -- and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher
and they throw it away.  If you, if you mow properly and just let it lay in
there, you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base. 

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  So that's what [throat_clearing], we've been doing that for the last couple
of years and you don't have to worry about, uh, fertilizing which causes a lot
of thatch and all that kind of stuff --

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  -- so, there's more and more people, too are aware of that up here, and
they're not going out for chemicals, they're not going out for a lot of
fertilizers and stuff, so they're letting it, you know, uh,

B.76:  Our soil situation down here in this particular area, we're in a real hard
black, gooey, gummy, awful black clay situation. 

A.77:  Oh.  So,

B.78:  And, uh,

A.79:  Summertimes it cracks when it heats. 

B.80:  Oh, yeah. 

A.81:  When it gets,

B.82:  You could lose a small dog in the cracks on it sometimes [laughter]. 

A.83:  Oh, yeah [throat_clearing]. 

B.84:  So, I,

A.85:  I was watching, uh, I was watching the news this morning, uh, national news
--

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  -- and they were talking about, uh, I guess they got a, a recycling dump
for tires that caught on fire, but they were saying that, uh, California they
recycle their, their, all the tires and make, like a, a some kind of a
rubberized compound and they incorporate that with, uh, with, uh, tar and they
use it on their roads and they say the roads last,

B.88:  # Yeah.  #

A.89:  # a # lot longer. 

B.90:  There was a thing in the local news here yesterday, there's a little town
down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield, and there's some tire recycling
outfit wants a permit down there.  They say out of every tire you can get a
gal-, what amounts to a gallon of diesel fuel and, like you say, several pounds
of this, uh, carbon black and, uh, material for, for making roads, and anymore
there's a couple pounds of stainless steel in most of the,

A.91:  # Oh, for the steel belted,#

B.92:  # uh, the tires.  #

A.93:  That's right I didn't think about that. 

B.94:  Yeah, because the steel belted tires. 

A.95:  Yeah. 

B.96:  And, uh, it's, a totally gas fired operation.  They say there's no exhaust
whatsoever.  You know most people think of tire, yeah those burning tire, uh,
see, there was what, was it Massachusetts, I remember here a couple of years
ago reading about one that had been on fire for [laughter] long period of
time,

A.97:  # Yeah, yeah.  #

B.98:  # you know, # it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it. 

A.99:  There could be the one up here someplace. 

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  I'm not really sure.  Uh,

B.102:  Over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and
they had an awful time putting it out. 

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  But our big problem down here, course is, is, uh, tires laying around down
on the ground and stuff, uh, collect water and then, of course, that becomes
mosquito breeding area. 

A.105:  Oh, that's right, too.  Yeah, I didn't think of,

B.106:  And, uh,

A.107:  Yeah. 

B.108:  That can be a real (( )).

A.109:  Yeah, Connecticut was, uh, is in the process of building [throat_clearing] 
a, a plant to burn tires to generate electricity. 

B.110:  Um, yeah. 

A.111:  So, I guess that's kind of a, a, a recycling process.  The, uh, all the,
all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this, like
the recycling that we have now.  It depends on, on each individual
municipality.  Uh, we went on it quite early because the, the town fathers
said, yeah, you know, we think it's a good idea.  But the state, I think by
nineteen ninety-three, every, every town in the state has to go on this
recycling program,

B.112:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.113:  # so # it's like a forced, uh, which is good, I think. 

B.114:  Yeah.  What happens to us ((anyways)), as you can imagine in Texas you've
got urban areas that are probably as compact or as, you know, densely populated
as,

A.115:  # Yeah.  #

B.116:  # just # about any place in the country. 

A.117:  Well, you guys got,

B.118:  But, then, then you run into, uh, areas you know, they've, we've got a
statistic they like to use, you know, you can take the population of the world
and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd
have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any
people in it.

A.119:  Yeah, Houston's probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island. 

B.120:  Uh, yeah.  Uh, the panhandle, the, the, there's, well, there's several
counties in west Texas [laughter] and New Mexico, too, for that matter, that
are bigger than Rhode Island. 

A.121:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.122:  But, uh, we had a, our (( )) our government rep, I'm in D S E G here,
