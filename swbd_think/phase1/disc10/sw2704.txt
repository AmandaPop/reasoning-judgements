============================================================================

A.1:  [Hiss]  What, what's the, uh, the main way that you keep up with, uh, the
current events?

@B.2:  [Hiss] Oh, I guess mostly, uh, really, I get the, I guess the headlines on
the news, and then I read the newspaper for a little more detail.

A.3:  Right. 

B.4:  Uh, I used to take some news magazines, but I found that I just didn't have
enough time to really read them.

A.5:  Right, to get the full benefit out of them? [noise]. 

B.6:  Yeah, [laughter]  yeah.  To get my money's worth out of it. 

A.7:  Right, right. 

B.8:  You know, I'd, I'd, oh, I was taking NEWSWEEK for a long time, and I'd read
it a little bit and put it back for a while, and, you know, first thing you
know, I'm reading [laughter] a three week old news #magazine.#

A.9:  #Exactly#  [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter] That got to be kind of silly, so I,

A.11:  [Laughter]. 

B.12:  cut that out. 

A.13:  Right.  Uh,

B.14:  [Child]  But I do read the paper just, oh, just about every day. 

A.15:  That's, that's my main source also.  I, uh, usually get it when I'm going
into work.

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  And, uh, read the paper real quick. 

B.18:  Yeah [child]. 

A.19:  So that's, uh, that's usually my main source, because I, sometimes I'm, if
I'm here I'm, I'm in and out and can't really watch the news all the time. 

B.20:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm, I like to watch the news, uh, i-, if I really know that
something's going on.  Because, like I say, you, you can kind of get the
headlines --

A.21:  Right. 

B.22:  -- and a pretty quick thumbnail sketch of what's going on. 

A.23:  Right. 

B.24:  But then I, I like the paper because you do get more detail. 

A.25:  Exactly.  What do you think about the coverage? Uh,

B.26:  Oh, it, #[sigh]  I tell you,#

A.27:  #does it sort of depend on# the event,

B.28:  Yeah,

A.29:  #what's going on?#

B.30:  #I think it does.# I, I tell you it's, it's really interesting when, when
you are personally involved or, or personally see something that happened and
then gets reported on later.

A.31:  Oh,

B.32:  #It's,#

A.33:  #Okay.#

B.34:  it's, you know,

A.35:  #Yeah.#

B.36:  #I've,# I've kind of been in that situation a couple of times.  And it's,
it's interesting to see how the, how the reporters and h-, and how the other
people,

A.37:  How they, how they,

B.38:  Yeah, how they saw it,

A.39:  #Right.#

B.40:  #as# opposed to how you saw it. 

A.41:  Huh. 

B.42:  And, and sometimes it's, uh, you know, sometimes it's just like I saw it,
and then again sometimes it's not [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah.  Sometimes, I guess they do have to jazz it up just a little bit --

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  -- for it to make, uh, news for people to read it, yeah. 

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  But, uh {faint},

B.48:  But, uh, it's, I don't know.  It's, you know, the problem is you really
don't know, I think, so many times if, if the coverage is accurate,

A.49:  Accurate,

B.50:  #or fair.# 

A.51:  #right.# 

B.52:  And that's, that's the problem, I guess.  Uh,

A.53:  Well, you know, any more they can,

B.54:  [Child]. 

A.55:  they can be any where and, and, and almost talk to anyone instantly,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # it # seems like. 

B.58:  Yeah. 

A.59:  And, uh, man it seems like they can get about fifty different views, you
know, of experts,

B.60:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.61:  # uh, just # in a matter of seconds.  Uh,

B.62:  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's interesting to, [child] {faintly} to hear from the
experts, you know.

A.63:  Right. 

B.64:  The so-called experts, but I think sometimes they tend to go a little
overboard.

A.65:  Yeah.  You know, with the Persian Gulf deal, you know, it's, the first, oh,
probably the first week or so, we really watched C N N every night --

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  -- and it was really interesting.  Then after a while, I mean, it just
seemed like, uh, everybody was an expert,

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  on the,

B.70:  # Yeah.  #

A.71:  # the # topic. 

B.72:  Yeah,

A.73:  #And, uh,#

B.74:  #it's kind of# funny.  We were, we were kind of discussing that at work one
day.  And you know, the, the introduction to the expert that they have, you
know, this is Mister Jones, he's been working on this project for thirty
years, you know, he knows all there is to know about it.

A.75:  Right. 

B.76:  And we just kind of looked around at our project at T I, and you know,
we've got people that have been on the project for a long time that, you know,
don't know the first thing about --

A.77:  #Exactly.# 

B.78:  -- #what's,#

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  going on [laughter].  So, #we're kind of, uh,#

A.81:  #Exactly.# 

B.82:  quoting those guys and,

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  you know, and everybody was having a good time with it. 

A.85:  Right, right. 

B.86:  [Child] So that just, uh, you know, that's a, a little lesson on how the
experts can be.

A.87:  Exactly [breathing]. 

B.88:  But, uh,

A.89:  You know, in th-, in the, the Persian Gulf, I think that is a,

B.90:  [Child]. 

A.91:  a perfect example of, uh, the media being hungry for something to happen. 

B.92:  Oh, yeah, #yeah.# 

A.93:  #You know,# it's j-, it had been so long since there had been a,

B.94:  #Yeah.#

A.95:  #a major# event.  And [noise], 

B.96:  Yeah, the, the, the media was more mobilized than the military was, #I
think.# 

A.97:  #You know,# I think it was because, uh, and I don't know how accurate this
is, but I, I heard that, uh, you know, even Schwartzkopf and some of those guys
was, were watching C N N,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.99:  # to # try to get some of the updates. 

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  And that, that just seemed outrageous, you --

B.102:  Yeah, yeah [child]. 

A.103:  -- know, that they'd, they'd watch these reporters to,

B.104:  #Well, you know,#

A.105:  #to get updated.# 

B.106:  the, the situation the way it was there for a while, you know, you had,
uh, you had T V reports coming out of Baghdad. 

A.107:  # Exactly.  #

B.108:  # and # that's, to me, that's unheard of, you know that's, that's crazy. 
#You go,#

A.109:  #Yeah.#  You know, tha-, there's not enough money in the world for me to be
up there in, uh, in probably the highest building #in# --

B.110:  #No,# #huh-uh.# 

A.111:  -- #Baghdad while#  all these bombs are going off.  I mean,

B.112:  Yeah, because here we are at, at, at all out war with a country and, and
we've got our own people right in the heart --

A.113:  That's right. 

B.114:  -- of that country.  You know, right in area that we're trying to blow out.

A.115:  You know, I sort of have a tough time, uh, feeling sorry for those guys
when they get captured over there.

B.116:  Yeah. 

A.117:  I mean, they're just almost asking for it when they,

B.118:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.119:  # when they # sign up for these projects,

B.120:  # Well, the-,#

A.121:  # and, #

B.122:  some of them, uh, uh, you know, almost give the air of, of arrogance, you
know.

A.123:  Right. 

B.124:  Oh, you can't touch me, I'm a reporter, you know, you don't want to touch
me, I'm a reporter but --

A.125:  Right. 

B.126:  -- sometimes the crowd, [laughter] you know, or the people just don't
really respect that [laughter]. 

A.127:  Oh, yeah.  And those guys over there don't give a flip.  I mean, uh,

B.128:  # No.  Huh-uh.  #

A.129:  # wh-, wh-, # what they going to, you know, what are we going to do? Go to
war with them? We already are. 

B.130:  Yeah. 

A.131:  And, uh,

B.132:  I mean, [noise]  there's not much we can do. 

A.133:  Yeah. 

B.134:  Well, you ca-,

A.135:  So, uh,

B.136:  # [Barking]  [talking]  {in the background} you get, #

A.137:  #yeah, it# that and, and the people working over there.  If, if they've 
had plenty of warning and --

B.138:  Yeah. 

A.139:  -- and had opportunities to leave then,

B.140:  # Yeah.  #

A.141:  # uh, # you know,

B.142:  [Barking]. 

A.143:  I, I'm sure there's certain circumstances where it's, uh, you know, it's
impossible.  But man, some of those people just need to take a hint and get out
of there. 

B.144:  [/Barking] Oh, yeah, really.  Like I say, [buzz]  you know, it they've 
had enough, enough, ample time to get out and then they --

A.145:  Right. 

B.146:  -- don't.  Then, you know, that's, that's their own problem,

A.147:  #Yeah.#

B.148:  #you know.#  Whether it's,

A.149:  And, and I think it's unfortunate that we have to risk some of our 
soldiers' lives to try to get them out, you know, after it's, uh,

B.150:  # Yeah.  That's, #

A.151:  # almost too # late. 

B.152:  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly right, you know, because that's exactly what
we're doing. 

A.153:  Right. 

B.154:  They're, [laughter]  they stay over there long after they've been warned to
get out, then they expect us to come and bail them out. 

A.155:  Exactly [noise]. 

B.156:  Which, of course, we have to do, you know. 

A.157:  Right, right. 

B.158:  But, uh, no, it's, there's a lot of, [sigh]  lot of sources for news and I
guess, a lot of sources of news.  There's just, oh, you know, news people every
where,

A.159:  # Exactly.  #

B.160:  # all # over.  It's just amazing. 

A.161:  Yeah. 

B.162:  I guess the, I guess the American public probably more so than anybody else
I know, just has this, this need, this thirst for news. 

A.163:  That's right [noise]. 

B.164:  You know, I'm the same way.  I, I love to read the paper.  I like to read
the editorials.  ((I like)),

A.165:  That's right.  And you, and, you know, I like the,

B.166:  # [Throat_clearing].  #

A.167:  # the # sensational type stories, [/noise]  you know. 

B.168:  Uh-huh. 

A.169:  And, and, uh, the, man, the, just like you were saying, the me-, media of
all types just jumps,

B.170:  # Yeah.  #

A.171:  # uh, # jumps all over it. 

B.172:  Yeah, it's, it's, you know, s-, some of the stuff I don't, I don't feel the
need.  Some of the news items, I guess, is what I'm saying, I don't feel like
are really newsworthy. 

A.173:  Right. 

B.174:  The personal tragedies and that kind of thing.  #But,#

A.175:  #Exactly.# 

B.176:  you know, but, uh, oh, the big disasters and the big natural disasters
and stuff,

A.177:  #Right.#

B.178:  #yeah,# that's news but,

A.179:  Well, you know, sort of like this Kennedy deal going on where, uh,

B.180:  # Yeah, #

A.181:  # supposedly # --

B.182:  yeah.  That's,

A.183:  -- some nephew raped this girl. 

B.184:  Yeah. 

A.185:  Well, you know, that's, I think a lot of that's just, you know, the smut
news coming out, # and, and, uh, #

B.186:  # Oh, yeah.  That's # just, that's strictly, NATIONAL INQUIRER stuff,

A.187:  # Right, #

B.188:  # you # know. 

A.189:  Right. 

B.190:  And I, I don't care a thing about that.  I haven't read anything about it
or, or even watched anything.  But,

A.191:  Yeah.  And you know,

B.192:  [Child]. 

A.193:  that's just, uh, and the media has jumped all over that. 

B.194:  [Child]  Yeah, yeah [laughter]  [child]. 

@@A.195:  But, uh, well, I appreciate the conversation. 

B.196:  All right. 

A.197:  You have a good evening. 

B.198:  All right, you too.  We'll see you later. 

A.199:  Um.  Bye-bye [/hiss]. 

B.200:  Bye-bye [/hiss].
