=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I am having a hard time remembering [cough], the last movie I saw. 

B.2:  Well, I was too [laughter].  I thought I saw a lot of movies but I guess I
haven't seen any really recently. 

A.3:  Yeah, I guess, uh, I can remember seeing DANCES WITH WOLVES.  That was
good. 

B.4:  Well, I haven't seen that. 

A.5:  Well, that's, that's an excellent film. 

B.6:  That's what everybody says. 

A.7:  I highly, I highly recommend that, in fact I guess they're bringing that
back out. 

B.8:  Oh, are they?

A.9:  And, uh, they are adding fifty minutes to it or something like that. 

B.10:  [Laughter]  See, that's why I don't want to go see it because it's three
hours just to start.  I thought I can't,

A.11:  That's right. 

B.12:  I can't sit through a movie that long. 

A.13:  So, it's going to be almost four hours before it's over. 

B.14:  I know,

A.15:  Or beyond,

B.16:  I don't think I'll see it. 

A.17:  Yeah, beyond that. 

B.18:  But, I hear it's a man's movie anyway. 

A.19:  Oh, I wouldn't say that. 

B.20:  Really?

A.21:  No, because I, my wife, well my wife and I went, and I think she enjoyed it
even more than I did. 

B.22:  Oh, really?

A.23:  So, uh, unlike FIELD OF DREAMS, I guess the last Kevin Costner movie we'd
seen before that was FIELD OF DREAMS, I, I guess I'd have to admit that was
probably more of a guy's movie than a --

B.24:  Oh, was it, yeah. 

A.25:  -- than a lady's movie. 

B.26:  Well, it's kind of like, you know, STEEL MAGNOLIA to me --

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  -- was a woman's movie. 

A.29:  Yeah, that's what we,

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  we saw that and I have to agree with you, [laughter]  I think that was more
of a lady's movie, than a, than a guy's movie. 

B.32:  Yeah, uh, I was trying to think of the last movie I saw.  Oh, I saw, I saw
GHOST. 

A.33:  Oh, okay, yeah we saw that on video.  That's, that's,

B.34:  Oh, did you?

A.35:  that's, another thing I guess that, uh, that's kind of, kind of curbed, uh
--

B.36:  Yeah, going out. 

A.37:  -- us going out so much is that, uh, there was so many movies that I didn't
see when they came out beforehand, that, uh, I know are coming out on video,
that you --

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  -- that you look in the paper and you, you go, "Well, I can either see
this, or I can see this movie that I really wanted --

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  -- to see three years ago and didn't see.

B.42:  I want to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, have you seen that?

A.43:  I haven't, and, and --

B.44:  I hear it's excellent. 

A.45:  -- I hear it's excellent, and it's probably something I'd, I'd enjoy but I,
I heard that it was so, uh, kind of gruesome --

B.46:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.47:  -- in the scenes, and that was the part I probably wouldn't like. 

B.48:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.49:  But I heard that, uh, the acting was so great, and it was a really
thrilling movie.

B.50:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.51:  And, in fact, I read something in the paper here the other day that, uh,
Anthony Hopkins, I guess --

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  -- the guy that plays the, the psycho or the villain that --

B.54:  Right. 

A.55:  -- that, uh, he's getting letters from just all over, you know the world
and all that and then he suddenly become like a real screen idol,

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  or a, uh, like a, a leading man --

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  -- and he thinks it's funny, but I guess, uh, woman in particular, think
it's such a scary movie --

B.60:  Oh, yeah. 

A.61:  -- and that, uh, that, that they just identify with, not identify with him,
but they, they like his character, I wouldn't say like, like his character, but
they're so fascinated by his character --

B.62:  Yeah that's what it is. 

A.63:  -- that, uh, they write him letters and --

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  -- and say how much they liked him and things like that. 

B.66:  This guy that works with me, told me not to go see it by myself at night,
or see it by myself at night [laughter].

A.67:  [Laughter]  That's, that's probably a good idea.  Unfortunately, I, I think
I don't really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them.  So, uh. 

B.68:  I don't either, myself I like romantic comedies. 

A.69:  Yeah, yeah, I'll, I will go see a drama like, uh, when the UNTOUCHABLES
came out.

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  Which is another Kevin Costner movie, this is going to be a riot, isn't it?

B.72:  My gosh, you're, you must be another fan of his. 

A.73:  I, just so happen, I guess we just see those, but my wife actually talked
me into going to see that, and I didn't really want to go see it.

B.74:  Uh-huh. 

A.75:  I never, you know, it was kind of a, a bloody movie but, uh, it was done in
such a way, that you know, and with gangsters and guns --

B.76:  Yeah. 

A.77:  -- and all that, I mean you are not going to avoid that.  So it wasn't as,
it wasn't like they spent, you know, long shots --

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  -- relishing every drop or something like that. 

B.80:  I guess the last movie I saw was at SCENES FROM THE MALL with Woody Allen
and Bette Midler, and --

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  -- I, I guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan, which I'm not. 

A.83:  Yeah, we. 

B.84:  I think you either hate him or,

A.85:  We, we did, in fact, I think that is the last movie that we saw was SCENES
FROM THE MALL. 

B.86:  I thought it was terrible. 

A.87:  Yeah, so did we, we thought it was really lousy. 

B.88:  Yeah, I like her, but I really don't like him for some reason.  In the
first place, trying to pass him off at age forty just was almost more,

A.89:  [Laughter]. 

B.90:  than I could handle, you know. 

A.91:  Yes, he's not forty anymore, that's for sure. 

B.92:  Lord, no.  He hasn't seen forty in ten years, has he?

A.93:  Plus, there is something about seeing those two walking through a mall,
just like and nobody paying attention --

B.94:  Yes. 

A.95:  -- is just like no, no --

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like. 

B.98:  Isn't that the truth?

A.99:  This, this is real realistic and you know if I saw Woody Allen and Bette
Midler go by, and he's still carrying a yellow surfboard, I wouldn't notice
him.  I wouldn't even see him. 

B.100:  I believe I would too, but, and then the money they spent on that food,
that shrimp or --

A.101:  Oh, yeah. 

B.102:  -- or that sushi or something like. 

A.103:  It was just a,

B.104:  Hundred, I mean eleven hundred dollars, or something they ended up
spending.  Nobody spends that kind of money I don't think. 

A.105:  Yeah, and I, I just can't believe that you could use up two hours watching
two people go from store to store in the mall. 

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  You know just, uh, in fact that was the funny part of it was just sitting
there and just seeing mall shots going.  You know, I could go to North Park --

B.108:  Right. 

A.109:  -- or I could go to Collin Creek or something like that --

B.110:  Right. 

A.111:  -- and see that. 

B.112:  Right, that's terrible. 

A.113:  So, uh, it was just not really fun at all. 

B.114:  No, I came, I had asked my neighbor to go with me and she decided to, she
had to fly.  So, I thought I will go see it by myself. 

A.115:  Uh-huh. 

B.116:  And I'm glad I didn't ask her to waste her time now because. 

A.117:  [Laughter]  Or money. 

B.118:  Yeah, I mean that was a horrible movie.  I,

A.119:  We went to an early show on that one, so we. 

B.120:  In fact, I think I went to one of the early shows, I didn't have to spend a
bunch of money on it.  I think I got in for two seventy-five or something. 

A.121:  Yeah,

B.122:  I would have hated to have spent seven dollars on it. 

A.123:  Oh, gee, yeah, tell the truth.  But that,

B.124:  But, she usually plays some pretty cute movies, like that one with Nick
Nolte --

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  -- that was BEVERLY, DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS.  Did you see that?

A.127:  Yeah, I didn't get to see that.  I didn't get to see that.  But, uh, but,

B.128:  She was cute in that.  And, uh, I think, I hear she was good in BEACHES,
but I didn't see that.

A.129:  I didn't see that either.  That was something oh, probably rent a video on
one of these days but, uh. 

B.130:  I want to see that movie {pause} uh, A KISS BEFORE.  Or before,

A.131:  Oh, A KISS BEFORE DYING or something like that. 

B.132:  Yeah, something like that. 

A.133:  I have just seen it advertised, but I guess I haven't kept up on the movies
that are out right, just coming out right now. 

B.134:  I just seen it advertised on T V and it really looks like it is going to be
a thriller --

A.135:  Uh-huh. 

B.136:  -- a good thriller. 

A.137:  That sounds, sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic
comedies and then thrillers then.

B.138:  Yeah, yeah I am.  I really don't like to see thrillers by myself, but, uh,
[laughter]  --

A.139:   Yeah. Yeah. --

B.140:   I will go see them, I

A.141:  I guess, I guess the only movie we wanted to see and haven't gone to see
yet is CLASS ACTION TWO, with Gene Hackman.

B.142:  Yeah, I want to see that.  That's another good one. 

A.143:  Because, I hear he's good in it. 

B.144:  Yeah. 

A.145:  but I guess he's good in almost everything he does. 

B.146:  Yeah, I know it, I've never seen him in anything bad yet. 

A.147:  And, uh, so we, we're looking forward one of these days to, to see that. 

B.148:  And another person I used to, I really did like was Barbara Streisand, and
then I saw her in that movie NUTS, and that was a,

A.149:  I didn't see that, no. 

B.150:  Don't waste your, even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad.  Oh,

A.151:  [Laughter]  That's good, I think that's what everyone said that it was a
pretty lousy movie. 

B.152:  Oh, it was horrible and I really did like her until that. 

A.153:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.154:  But gosh not any more. 

A.155:  Well, she hasn't been in a, well, maybe that's why she hasn't been in a
movie in a long time. 

B.156:  Yeah, I don't think she's able [laughter] as a matter of the fact. 

A.157:  Yeah, I guess, I guess I don't tend to, even though it seems like we've
been to a lot of Kevin Costner's movies, I mean it's my wife's, uh, input more
than I --

B.158:  Uh-huh. 

A.159:  -- but, uh, but I guess I don't really anymore on star value, I don't
really --

B.160:  Yeah. 

A.161:  -- go see movies because just like Robert Redford was in HAVANA --

B.162:  Yeah. 

A.163:  -- and boy that looked like a bad movie just from the coming attractions. 

B.164:  I know it. 

A.165:  And I, I said, "Boy." 

B.166:  How about, did you see, uh, PRETTY WOMAN, with Richard Gere?

A.167:  I haven't seen that. 

B.168:  Oh, that's good. 

A.169:  Was that good?

B.170:  Yeah, I liked that.  That's a good movie. 

A.171:  And that, I heard that, uh, and I don't particularly like Richard Gere, I
guess the only movie that I, that I liked that he was in was OFFICER AND --

B.172:  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMEN, yeah. 

A.173:  -- a GENTLEMAN, and even then, that was kind of pushing it.  But, uh --

B.174:  Oh, I am a fan of his. 

A.175:  -- but I heard every, even if you didn't like Richard Gere you probably
would have liked that movie. 

B.176:  Yeah, he is good.  I really, I really did like that movie.  I'm a fan of
his. 

A.177:  Uh, okay. 

B.178:  Yeah, he's, uh, he's okay in my book [laughter]. 

A.179:  [Laughter]  Okay, okay. 

B.180:  And of course, Julia Roberts is cute too, but I, I didn't really know, I
hadn't heard of her too much until I saw this movie. 

A.181:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 

B.182:  Then, I saw DICK TRACY, did you see that. 

A.183:  I haven't seen that, no.  No, we didn't go see that. 

B.184:  Nah. 

A.185:  I heard it was more of a kid's movie.  And, uh. 

B.186:  Well, the kids wouldn't appreciate it because they, they have never heard
of DICK TRACY other than, you know, like I've heard of him all my life.  But,

A.187:  Yeah, when, when he was actually in the funny papers. 

B.188:  Yeah.  But they don't know him except for, uh, probably, uh, the movie, you
know. 

A.189:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.190:  So I don't think they would appreciate it as much as, as older people
would, because they, you know, grew up with him.  But --

A.191:  That's,

B.192:  -- I was kind of disappointed in it a little bit, uh,

A.193:  Yeah, I probably couldn't get my wife to go see that.  I think the last
time I got to see, or something like that was BATMAN.  It took me a, it took
me a,

B.194:  Yeah, and I didn't like that movie.  You know why I didn't like that movie,
it was so dark I couldn't see. 

A.195:  Well, that's true.  I think that was the feel that they, they were after --

B.196:  I guess. 

A.197:  -- was, everything was really dark and, and, and kind of foreboding and,

B.198:  And I don't like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on
the screen. 

A.199:  Yeah. 

B.200:  That was, that was one I, I watched on a video at home. 

A.201:  Uh-huh. 

B.202:  And I, maybe that was it, maybe that was. 

A.203:  That, that might have been something, because I think that, I don't think
that movie would have been as good on a, on a small screen. 

B.204:  No. 

A.205:  I mean you really, it really had to be on a big screen, I think, especially
for Jack Nicholson to come across. 

B.206:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.207:  Because, because I mean, what he did was so corny. 

B.208:  [Laughter]. 

A.209:  You know like, like it, it's like they, they spent a half hour setting up
that line about bats in the belfry. 

B.210:  Uh-huh. 

A.211:  You know, where Batman is climbing up to save what's her name. 

B.212:  Uh-huh. 

A.213:  And he's up there, and it's like all these things are, are falling on him,
and it's like they, they work all this time just when he gets to the top that
the Joker can say something about, "Well, looks like we got bats in the
belfry." 

B.214:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.215:  Well, I think they have been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long
time. 

B.216:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

A.217:  I hear a second BATMAN movie is getting ready to come out too. 

B.218:  Oh, is it?

A.219:  Yeah, I guess, Danny De Vito is in it. 

B.220:  Oh, that would be good.  I like him.  Oh, did you see, uh, WAR OF THE
ROSES?

A.221:  Yeah, I. 

B.222:  I loved it, but most people that I knew didn't like it. 

A.223:  I, I liked it until about a half hour from the, from the end.  It looked,
it looked like it was going to be a funny movie.

B.224:  Uh-huh. 

A.225:  And, and until about, until it got to be almost too much. 

B.226:  Oh. 

A.227:  You know when they were. 

B.228:  Well, now that was the first movie I, or the first movie in ages that I
have seen twice.  I went back to see it.

A.229:  Really?

B.230:  And when I saw it the second time, it wasn't as cute, but it was, I just
roared through it the first time, and in fact I,

A.231:  Again, I think the first hour was really, everyone was laughing and --

B.232:  Uh-huh. 

A.233:  -- and my wife and I were really enjoying it, and then I think it was when
he finally drove the car over the yard,

B.234:  [Laughter]. 

A.235:  or something like that. 

B.236:  Yeah. 

A.237:  She finally tried, uh, I mean it gets from, from little things like
throwing things at him and dropping things on him to, to where she's actually
--

B.238:  Trying to kill him. 

A.239:  -- trying to kill him,

B.240:  [Laughter]. 

A.241:  and then I almost got real furious. 

B.242:  Yeah, I know it. 

A.243:  and, and it was like a whole mood change right here, and that whole
chandelier scene at the end.  It was like,

B.244:  Oh, I know it and I was so shocked at the ending.  I didn't think they
would die.

A.245:  Yeah. 

B.246:  I really didn't.  I was so shocked. 

A.247:  And, and it was funny because we usually like Michael, uh --

B.248:  Douglas, yeah.  He plays,

A.249:  -- Douglas and Kathleen Turner.  I think we've liked everything. 

B.250:  I have too. 

A.251:  Like Diane saw JAGGED EDGE. 

B.252:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yes, that was good. 

A.253:  You know, my wife. 

B.254:  Oh, that was good. 

A.255:  And I didn't. 

B.256:  Oh, you didn't?

A.257:  But I just, you know, I mean she, she's seen a lot more Kathleen Turner
movies than I have. 

B.258:  Uh-huh. 

A.259:  And she, the only ones I ever saw were ROMANCING THE STONE and --

B.260:  Oh, okay. 

A.261:  -- and those kind of movies, but she likes them and, and she --

B.262:  She's a good actress. 

A.263:  -- I was really dis-, I think we, we were both disappointed in that for
some reason.  Although, it looked like it was going to be funny.

B.264:  Yeah, well, I did, I don't know, maybe I got a warped sense of humor,
because I, like I said I just roared through it the first time and then the
second time when I saw it, but it, see it was a month later that I saw it the
second time.  Maybe if I had waited longer and seen it the second time.
