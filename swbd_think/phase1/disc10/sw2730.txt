==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, do you have any formal programs in your area?

B.2:  Sure.  I used to cycle around the block two or three [laughter]. 

A.3:  [Laughter]  Oh no. 

B.4:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  I recycled once before.  No.  Yes, actually we do.  We
have, Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city. 

A.5:  Somehow that doesn't surprise me [laughter]. 

B.6:  Yeah, they, they go around and they give you these boxes and you, you fill
these boxes up and you take them out and they leave you know, you leave them on
the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them
up.  Problem is, you end up with these boxes in your home that, you know, get
pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and, and,
and by the time you, you manage to drag one downstairs, you know, it's, it's
work. 

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  I, I, I just, the-, the-, there, there's got to be a better way of
incorporating it, you know, somehow so that the manufacturers uh, that there's
an incentive to get it back to them.

A.9:  Yeah.  What, d-, I, I don't know.  We, we, there are some beginnings of
formal programs where we are though they're not in our town, I mean Jackie and
I, uh, recycle cans, you know, we just, we just fill up a, we have a trash can
set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and
drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours.  Uh,
I don't, it seems to me like if, if they really wanted to get serious or, you
know the government and the, uh, other private industries that could benefit
from it would make, uh, perhaps more permanent, uh, exterior fixtures which,
you know, wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to, you know, that,
that's kind of one of the thoughts that I had about it.

B.10:  Exactly.  You know wha-, what they, uh, oh another thing is that it, th-,
industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the uni-, you
know, th-, affects the environment. 

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  What they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to
take that into consideration. 

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  But like here in Berkeley, you can't buy anything from a fast-food place,
anything like that, that's in Styrofoam. 

A.15:  Yeah.  They've switched to that paperboard, the pressboard stuff. 

B.16:  And, you know, it, it's supposedly [laughter]  decomposes.  I've heard some
stories though about that, uh, the thing that lasts longest in, in, in a, in a
the, the landfills,

A.17:  [Laughter]. 

B.18:  is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but
it's the newspapers. 

A.19:  Is that right?

B.20:  Yeah and that's really strange.  You wouldn't think that but whenever you
see, you know, they're usually, uh, wrapped real tight and bundled and under
pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so,

A.21:  # Yeah.  #

B.22:  # inner # areas of them are, are protected. 

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  They don't decompose. 

A.25:  Isn't that something. 

B.26:  Isn-, that, you know, yo-, {stutters} and all those thousands of trees that
gets cut down and you think well gee, newspaper's pretty good because it will,
you know. 

A.27:  [Laughter] Yeah I saw a sign at the local Wal-Mart here back there in the
baby section talking about Wal-Mart does not buy disposable diapers because
they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the
ones that don't decompose at all [laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.29:  I thought that was interesting [laughter]. 

B.30:  [Laughter]  Indeed.  Well, you know.  There's got to be a fortune in that,
you know, I've got, all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way
to, to use these diapers in some useful product, you know, some, some, some,

A.31:  Like, like compost [laughter]. 

B.32:  [Laughter]  Yeah, or, or, or a compost brick, uh, you know. 

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  Build your next sky rise out of compost brick, you know, you'd see the
little blue things flickering through it but,

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  I think that might give it a little added touch of something, I'm not sure
what [laughter], 

A.37:  [Laughter]  Uh,

B.38:  No but, that, so they're aware of it in Texas, uh?

A.39:  They are, yeah.  They are, like I said, we've, we've just recently, I guess
in our part, we're like right in the middle of the state and you know, we're
not in some of the more metropolitan areas like Dallas or Houston or something
but, that, you, you are starting to see more big, large, uh, recycling, like
dumpsters or,

B.40:  That makes my heart sore because the last time I was in Texas was on a
hunting trip and I was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a
couple of cans.  We're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and
rolled down the window and just threw them out you know.

A.41:  Oh no! You messed with Texas [laughter]. 

B.42:  [Laughter]  Uh, I, I will have to say that the people I was there with were
Texans. 

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  I was visiting.  It was not my idea [laughter]. 

A.45:  Well, you know they have got these Adopt a Highway programs.  They have to
give the convicts something to do, you know [laughter]. 

B.46:  Well, I, I understand that and I think that, that, that he's certainly
contributed to that [laughter]. 

A.47:  # [Laughter]  Yeah, I must say I don't typically, #

B.48:  # I want you to know you've taken a # big load off my chest.  I've never
been able to, to confess that to anyone and now I've gotten to confess it. 

A.49:  [Laughter]  Well I'm, I'm happy to oblige [laughter].  Not happy that you
did it but, you know [laughter]. 

B.50:  [Laughter] Well something's got to be done.  I tell you what I was just
watching a, a show the other night on, on Antarctica, uh, and how they're
wanting to make it a, a, uh, an international park zone so that no one
country, you know, gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any
other thing.

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  And, uh, [sigh]  it just, it just amazes me, uh, you know, that, that, that
there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of
course, the only reason that, that place is left is because the damn planet is
so inhospitable that --

A.53:  Right, right. 

B.54:  -- no one can live down there you know. 

A.55:  Yeah, well, of course, [laughter]  they're, they're trying real hard to
devise ways to sustain life more comfortably down there just so they can get at
some of those resources. 

B.56:  Well, they're, they're doing it, they, you know, they're, they're learning
and --

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  -- and it's inevitably doomed and spa-, you know, all they got to do is
find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and, and,

A.59:  Well there's already oil there isn't there?

B.60:  Well they, not, uh, not absolutely for sure.  Now there is some off, off
shore. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. 

B.62:  But as far as on the continent I don't think that anyone drilled a rig on
the continent yet. 

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  But, uh, in any event,

A.65:  Huh. 

B.66:  I think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it
but you know it's like we, we have all the needs that, you know, civilized
society has and I think that it's not all our responsibility to to do that.  I
mean the manufacturers wo-, would manufacture things in ways that were
biodegradable and did not damage the, the, uh, environment, you know, I think
that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those
products.

A.67:  Oh boy, there, there's such a higher level of consciousness about that now
that, that's got to be, I mean if you could come up with something like that
just to, the, the marketing advantage would be phenomenal [laughter]. 

B.68:  And I think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind
of marketing.

A.69:  Yeah.  I, well I think we've already seen that.  I mean --

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  -- just in the, the, the few products that have, uh, plugged that is a, is
an advantage, you know.  It costs more and people have jumped on them. 

B.72:  Yeah.  Well, I, I know I'm willing I just, uh, you know it's just, I, I
have certain needs for certain things and, uh, you know, I really can't help
it how it is packaged.

A.73:  Yeah. 

B.74:  I have the need for what's there. 

A.75:  Right and then as soon as something comes along that is, that you need and
all of a sudden it's available and in a environmentally conscious package,

B.76:  Found ways and I will switch immediately and I think probably the rest of
the planet will too. 

A.77:  I, I tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that. 

@@B.78:  Well listen, it's been a pleasure talking with you.  Steve right?

A.79:  Yeah, that's right.  I sure enjoyed it. 

B.80:  All right.  Well you take care and listen, uh, the next time you run over a
beer can in the road. 

A.81:  I'll think of you [laughter]. 

B.82:  Please do. 

A.83:  Okay [laughter]. 

B.84:  All right. 

A.85:  Bye-bye. 

B.86:  Bye.
