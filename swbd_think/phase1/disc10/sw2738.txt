A.1:  Have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there?

@B.2:  Well, what I consider invasion, well maybe it's just invasion of my
private time is i-, we get a lot of those computer generated, uh, telephone
calls.

A.3:  Um. 

B.4:  Where they just, you know, go through the list, and whenever you pick up
the phone, it's a recording and there, you're supposed to hold on for a very
important phone call and I feel that if it was so important that they would,
uh, be there instead of putting me on hold.

A.5:  Oh, well that explains that.  I got one the other day, they, they did that.
Uh, it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a
dead line for, oh it must have been minutes and I said well it couldn't have
been that important and I wound up hanging up and I've always wondered what
that was.

B.6:  Yeah, we, uh, I don't know why it is, but there have been so many of those
that, um, instead of the, the sa-, usual sales calls that you get that they,
um, will just run through the list and I guess wait for someone who's going to
hang on to talk to them.  But, uh, yeah, th-, we get a lot of those.

A.7:  Um. 

B.8:  Almost sort of like these T I phone calls.  No [laughter]. 

A.9:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yo-, you don't mind them. 

B.10:  Right, right, no these, these are beneficial too, too, uh, for personal,
uh, benefit here.

A.11:  No most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me
at work.  That's about the only place they can pin me down.

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  And, uh, so about any important phone call that I have, I'm going to get it
at work, and if the phone call comes to the house, chances are it's either for
my wife or one of the girls.

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  And so I just do not answer the phone call. 

B.16:  # [Laughter].  #

A.17:  # You # know, I'll let it ring until somebody else answers it.  And if they
say, dad, it's for you, I says what are they selling [laughter]. 

B.18:  Right, right. 

A.19:  And I'd say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home, it's
somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some,

B.20:  # Swampland in Florida.  #

A.21:  # some, uh, grave # sites or something like that. 

B.22:  Yeah, we get a lot for, uh, aluminum siding. 

A.23:  Um. 

B.24:  And, uh, but yeah, wha-, do you all have, what do you consider your
invasion of privacy?

A.25:  I consider that to be the invasion of privacy.  Particularly when I'm
sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and I, I have to
answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my
dinner's getting cold.

B.26:  Right, right.  That seems to be the prime time they call. 

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  Is, is definitely, well between, uh, six and eight o'clock, I guess. 

A.29:  Well I think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and
that, that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  And so there's nobody home except maybe school kids after school. 

B.32:  Right. 

A.33:  And so they might as well not even try, you know, not even tie up people
dialing phone numbers except in the evening.

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  Fortunately they have, uh, sufficient respect that they don't call after
ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning.

B.36:  Right, I'm surprised they don't though.  Uh, I, but I'm sure if they did,
that, uh, there would be a lot more, uh, public, uh, uh, voice about it. 

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  That, uh, we wouldn't go for that. 

A.39:  Yeah, I think if I got a phone call at six o'clock in the morning, it was
somebody trying to sell me something, I would call the phone company
immediately,

B.40:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.41:  # and # list them as a nuisance call. 

B.42:  Right, and what's so bad about it is, um, and, they don't, I mean all it is
is they just go through, down a list of numbers, I mean, they don't know who
they're calling.  It didn't seem like.  Uh, it, they're just a haphazard, uh,
at it, so.  I don't know.

A.43:  Yeah {pause}. But I think that's about the biggest invasion of privacy we
have.  Uh, there are a few others but, uh, I presume that they have legitimate
purposes. 

B.44:  Right, right. 

A.45:  Yeah, the government seems to intervene quite a bit. 

B.46:  [Laughter]. 

A.47:  Uh, one of the other complaints I have is, uh, have you ever checked your
credit with the credit bureau? 

B.48:  Uh, no, not yet. 

A.49:  You ought to do that, it's interesting, tha-, to see who has inquired about
your, uh, finances.  Because, uh, they're required to keep track and for I
think about the preceding year,

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  and it's interesting to see who has, uh, called and inquire about your
credit and there's quite a few companies that, uh, want to send you credit
cards or, uh, charge cards, you know, will ask for a, uh, credit dump and then
send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card, open a charge
account with some company.

B.52:  Now we've gotten several of those letters as far as trying to, uh, sign us
up for, you know, like you, you've been, uh, approved for a pr-, you know, for
a credit card and all this.

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  And, uh, I've always wondered how and, uh, why.  Now we had a problem not
too long ago, our, uh, my brother-in-law recently moved and, uh, somehow or
another we got their new address on our credit reports, because the, uh, I
guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them
and, uh, had, uh, picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over
there.

A.55:  Um. 

B.56:  So it was like okay, now wait a second here.  So, it'll be interesting to
see how that works out, how messed up things will be. 

A.57:  Yeah, that takes some paperwork to get straightened out. 

B.58:  Yeah, so, uh, that was a mess.  But, uh, yeah, it the cre-, there was a
report not too long ago on the news here on, uh, they were going about how
easily it was to get information about anyone. 

A.59:  Yeah. 

B.60:  And, uh, you know, they got a credit history, um, you know, went through
all the moves that they made, you know, their, uh, it was just amazing the
stuff that they got.

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.62:  # And # it was so easily, you know, it was all public, uh, information it
seemed like. 

A.63:  Well there are, uh, lists that go by zip codes,

B.64:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.65:  # and, # uh, a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes,
because of, you know,

B.66:  # Right.  #

A.67:  # if # you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County
or Montgomery County in Maryland,

B.68:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.69:  # you're # a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and, uh, spend
money on foolish things. 

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # So, # uh, that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces
and things like that.

B.72:  [Laughter]  Yeah, we're in one of those counties and, uh, it, uh, you get
lots of interesting things in the mail. 

A.73:  Yeah. 

B.74:  In Fort Bend County in southwest Houston, the, seems to be the, the up
gro-, you know, the, uh, the new generation or whatever,

A.75:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.76:  # the # up and coming people are all are moving out this direction and, uh,
the new, it's funny to see how the different stores are now changing, uh, to
the, um, new demands. 

A.77:  # Yeah.  #

B.78:  # And, # uh, or trying to get the different, uh, people in.  And, so, uh,
but, yeah, I do, you know, you brought a good point about the, uh, the credit
histories, the credit reports.  That, uh, I feel is an, can be an invasion of
privacy if it's used wrong. 

A.79:  Uh-huh, well there was something on the news,

B.80:  # And, uh, should be so, #

A.81:  # just this morning that, uh, # somebody in doing their, uh, Master's
dissertation or something of that nature,

B.82:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.83:  # uh, # did a study of, uh, credit card reports, or, cr-, credit reports
and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data
in there, uh, data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the
future,

B.84:  # Um.  #

A.85:  # or, # or getting a credit advance.  And, uh, the information was
erroneous.  So, uh, I, I think everybody recommends that, uh, well they've,
they, the, uh, story this morning on this radio suggested you ought to do this
about once a year but I figure about once every five years is good enough. 

B.86:  That's right because isn't it, uh, about fifty dollars to get one?

A.87:  Uh, it's about five dollars. 

B.88:  Oh, is it? 

A.89:  Yeah, it's fairly cheap. 

B.90:  Oh, okay, I was thinking, uh, maybe I got some wrong information somewhere.

A.91:  Yeah, well I had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong
information in there. 

B.92:  Right. 

A.93:  Everything seemed to be all right. 

B.94:  But it, it's difficult to change those, or, or to correct though. 

A.95:  Apparent, apparently, not, not if you, uh, approach the people and, and
they're, they're interested in keeping their records accurate. 

B.96:  Right. 

A.97:  But, uh, it's just nice to make sure that no, uh, uh, strange records show
up. 

B.98:  Right. 

A.99:  There was one case, I think, here recently where, some fellow down in
southwestern Virginia, uh, wound up being arrested for, uh, failure to provide
child support, and he didn't have any children.  And he had a heck of a time,
convincing the authorities that he wasn't the, the party that was responsible
for failing to make child support payments [laughter]. 

B.100:  Oh [laughter],  I bet his wife was like, okay, come on, what are you not
telling me here? 

A.101:  [Laughter]. 

B.102:  Right, the second life here, oh.  Oh, well I enjoyed talking to you. 

A.103:  All right. 

B.104:  And, uh, uh, you, I guess have a nice day. 

A.105:  Thank you, bye. 

B.106:  Thank you, bye, bye.
