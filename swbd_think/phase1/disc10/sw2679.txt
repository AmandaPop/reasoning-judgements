because of unsual speech patterns, dropping the voice and running phrases
together.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Where, where are you from?

B.2:  Um, just here in Dallas. 

A.3:  Oh, okay --

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  -- because I, uh, I talked to a professor in, uh, what was it, North
Carolina, who got the, the T I system, and he gave to all his students.  So, my
daughter's even talked to, and I've talked to several people from North
Carolina.  I was just curious. 

B.6:  That's, yes, yes, that's true.  I've --

A.7:  Have you,

B.8:  -- #talked,#

A.9:  # too? #

B.10:  Uh-huh.  People from Virginia and, and all over.  Yeah. 

A.11:  Yeah.  I talked to the professor, and I asked him about it, and he said,
Oh, he says, I think I'm the guy that, actually, uh, gave it to all my
students.

B.12:  # [Laughter].  #

A.13:  # So # that's why so many people are from this college.  Go,

B.14:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.15:  # ahead, # you, you first, ((Eve)).

@B.16:  Oh, okay.  Um, well the subject we're supposed to be talking about, let's
see, is, uh, food. 

A.17:  Food. 

B.18:  What type of foods do you cook and what would you, uh, cook in, uh, uh,
let's see, if you were giving a dinner party? And the only reason why I may
know a little bit about this, is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty
soon.

A.19:  Oh, great. 

B.20:  And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, um, uh, cooking
for people.  And, uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, uh, you
don't have to do all that much work.  You know, you just, uh, slap on some food
and slap on some barbecue sauce [laughter]  and away you go. 

A.21:  Yeah.  We have them too, and I, I'm trying to think which is the, best, uh,
that I prefer.  Uh, my wife, uh, doesn't like to have all that work on the
very day that you're doing it, uh, and we haven't catered out very much, uh,
we, I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be, the man always
gets that chore, and you,

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  have to make it perfect.  Uh, I've made shish kabob, which I like.  It's
fairly easy and fast. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  Uh, where-, I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do --

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  -- for, for having, uh, uh, dinner. 

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  I do cook, but not, I'm mostly the easy cooker.  You know, the breakfasts
and,

B.30:  # Yes.  #

A.31:  # and # the steaks, uh. 

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  Although I would like to experiment with, uh, the meals my mother made, you
know. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  So to speak, and I haven't gotten around to that yet, uh,

B.36:  What kind of meals did she make that you liked?

A.37:  Well, she was Polish and, uh, she would make very economical ra-, meals.
We were very poor.

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  Different rice and ham and things that, uh, she would throw things together
--

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  -- and ((galunkies)) and all that.  And, uh, I would like to try that one
day.  And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and, and special meat balls
and everything.  And my wife,

B.42:  Huh. 

A.43:  of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too but,

B.44:  No. 

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  Sounds interesting, uh-huh. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  Yeah, that's great. 

A.49:  But dinner parties are a lot of work, uh,

B.50:  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, that's, that's why I like the, the outdoor stuff a,

A.51:  # Yeah.  #

B.52:  # a # lot better.  People can entertain themselves, I think, a great deal
more, uh, when you have a barbecue.  Especially when you have hot dogs and
hamburgers and,

A.53:  # Yeah.  #

B.54:  # uh, # you know, nothing really fancy, like your, your shish kabobs, where
you have to do a whole bunch of work. 

A.55:  Yeah.  Well, that, that, shish kabob is, uh, just because it only takes a
few minutes to cook, you know,

B.56:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.57:  # you # get it ready, you have to do a lot of work beforehand, I agree, and
buy special stuff.  But, uh, so far as getting out there and, and putting it
on, it only takes a litt-, a few minutes, uh.

B.58:  Right. 

A.59:  But anyway, I'm, I'm thinking of the easy way, rather than,

B.60:  # [Laughter].  #

A.61:  # my # guests, I guess, but, uh,

B.62:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I, I think you do, do a lot of work.  Even if people do
bring over things, you still do, uh, all the, uh,

A.63:  # Right.  #

B.64:  # housework # and get ev-, everything prepared and utensils and just, just
everything. 

A.65:  Right. 

B.66:  Uh, you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish. 

A.67:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.68:  I'm thinking about, uh, special dishes, and, uh, yeah, it was made out of
rice and consume soup, uh, and bacon and onions. 

A.69:  Oh, yeah. 

B.70:  And then you'd simmer it like all day long. 

A.71:  Right. 

B.72:  Oh it would,

A.73:  You'd get the odor of it, yeah. 

B.74:  Yeah.  And it was just, it was just wonderful.  That's, that's something
that I would really like to, uh, to try and find the recipe for.  But we used
to have that at Thanksgiving time.

A.75:  Uh-huh, yes. 

B.76:  Because you can, you can put it on top of the stove, and do this, and, and
there's so much broth and juice in there,

A.77:  # Oh, great.  #

B.78:  # that it # has to, uh, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for
it to, uh, uh, to come out fluffy and, and nice.  And that was, you know, when
you were talking about the, the Polish dishes, uh, some goulashes and things
like that.  That's, uh, that's what I thought about, was that Armenian rice
dish.

A.79:  Oh, yes, we probably ought to try this.  But it probably will never taste
as good as we remembered.

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  I guess it gets better and better as we remember it,

B.82:  # That's true.  #

A.83:  # back, as # we get older, you know.  But --

B.84:  That's true. 

A.85:  -- we probably should try it, uh, to do that.  The recipes are really
interesting, you know.  We're probably going to lose them and we'll probably
forget all about them, you know. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  Since we're trying to make everything so sim-, here I am talk about trying
to make everything easy, you know. 

B.88:  Right, right. 

A.89:  I, uh, you talked about Thanksgiving, there are interesting meals at
different times.  Uh, something, s-, my wife's from Texas, so, uh, I remember
we were first married and we were living in New Jersey.  And, uh, we were
going over to my mother's house for Christmas, you know, to have a meal.

B.90:  Uh-huh. 

A.91:  And we were on the way over, we were just married that very year, and she
said, Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey.  I said, Turkey?

B.92:  [Laughter]. 

A.93:  I said, We don't have turkey at Christmas [laughter]. 

B.94:  Oh. 

A.95:  I said, We only have turkey on Thanksgiving.  I said, We're going to have a
ham. 

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  She said, What?

B.98:  Yeah!

A.99:  I said, Yeah.  I said, No, turkey is only for Thanksgiving.  And because
she had turkey a lot, you know.

B.100:  Uh-huh. 

A.101:  And, uh, that was surprising in the, in the east, uh, we always had ham,
you know.

B.102:  Right, right. 

A.103:  A-, and, and that's one thing als-, that's another recipe, I guess, we
could talk about.  Now the hams just kind of, you know, go take it out of a
can or, uh, uh, a package, sliced, uh, the cans were cooked for hours and
hours and, and --

B.104:  Uh-huh. 

A.105:  -- were just wonderful, you know. 

B.106:  Uh-huh. 

A.107:  I, I'd like to try that too. 

B.108:  Yeah.  You know what I found was, at Sam's, uh, Wholesale --

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  -- uh, stores.  And, uh, what they have is this honey baked ham,

A.111:  Oh, yeah, I saw them. 

B.112:  They,

A.113:  # That's good.  #

B.114:  # have you # seen, have you had any of those?

A.115:  No, I, I, uh, I've, I know about Sam's.  My wife I think goes but,

B.116:  If, if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, uh,
twenty dollars, for, uh, I don't remember how many pounds it was.

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  But you cook it in the bag that they send it in. 

A.119:  Oh, really?

B.120:  And all the juices and everything are all sealed in.  And, I tell you what,
i-, it's never failed to come out tender and juicy,

A.121:  # Oh, I haven't heard # 

B.122:  -- # and just # -- 

A.123:  -- of that, yeah. 

B.124:  -- and just delicious.  Because I normally don't like ham, because it's so
salty. 

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  But with this honey bake that they have, that, that's the only one I have
been able to find there at Sam's warehouse.  It is absolutely delicious. 

A.127:  Oh, yeah.  I'll have to ask her about that. 

B.128:  And it slices great.  Uh-huh. 

A.129:  Uh, because we have a delivery guy that comes around, that sells, I'm
trying to think of his name of it.  Uh, uh, I don't know, uh.  I see a can
here, or a box here of Gourmet Choice.  Uh, he delivers, uh.  What is the name
of this thing? I got a box, (()) distributor, marked on it, it doesn't say,
{very faint} Gourmet Choices.  But he, but it's a company that has, uh, you
know, a truck that comes around.  And, and they recently had hams.  They have
steaks and,

B.130:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.131:  # and, # uh, actually, pirogies and all that stuff that, uh, I, I wish I
could tell you the name of the company, but I don't know what it is.  But, uh,
they recently had a ham, that was supposed to be, it was boneless --

B.132:  Yeah. 

A.133:  -- and we tried it.  It was real nice, and it was fully cooked and
everything.  We had it --

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  -- for breakfast a long time.  It was really great. 

B.136:  Wow! You know, that sounds like it. 

A.137:  Yeah. 

B.138:  But that's, that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly, thoroughly
enjoy. 

A.139:  I would like to try the old recipe though, of cooking it, and, and I keep
saying this, uh, to, to do the different things that we did.  But I would like
to put one in the oven, you know, the old fashioned way and put it in there
for hours and hours, and see if, because I don't think in, in my married life,
which is, uh, twenty-six years now, we've never done that, you know.

B.140:  Wow. 

A.141:  And I remember that when I was a kid, uh,

B.142:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.143:  # to # have the ham cooking.  Uh, rather than that, we just, ham is just
something you have for breakfast occasionally, you know. 

B.144:  Right [laughter]. 

A.145:  And that's it, you know. 

B.146:  [Laughter]. 

A.147:  In the old days, we had, hams were the meal, and I don't, I don't think we,

B.148:  # Right.  #

A.149:  # really # have it as a main meal. 

B.150:  That's true.  I, I don't think so anymore, not with more, becoming more
conscious of, uh, fat and cholesterol and, and all those --

A.151:  Right. 

B.152:  -- good things. 

A.153:  That's an interesting point.  How, how have you changed your, your meals
now? Have you, into that, uh,

B.154:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.155:  # looking at # those things?

B.156:  Well, my parents actually started it,

A.157:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.158:  # and, # uh, getting,

A.159:  Parents, that's unusual. 

B.160:  Well, it, it's true.  I think my parents are very unusual because, uh, we
grew up in the south, where, uh, you have all the, uh, you know, biscuits and
gravy --

A.161:  Oh, yeah. 

B.162:  -- and, oh, fried foods galore.  And then gradually they started switching
over to, uh, plain rice, uh, no gravy. 

A.163:  That's amazing. 

B.164:  It's just, it really is.  They, uh, they're actually, they actually, uh,
uh, led us through it, versus, uh, us teaching them, you know, the, uh, the
finer points.  But my mother has really high cholesterol, so it was --

A.165:  Yeah. 

B.166:  -- one of the reasons which started them off.  And they started doing this,
like in the early, or in about the middle seventies. 

A.167:  Well, that's amazing,

B.168:  # Uh, yeah.  #

A.169:  # they'd go, # that they have started.  Usually it's the younger people
doing it.  Yeah. 

B.170:  It's true, it's true.  I agree with you. 

A.171:  I, uh,

B.172:  # So, it's really neat.  #

A.173:  # my, my wife's mother # is the only grandparent left, and, uh,

B.174:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.175:  # she # has high cholesterol.  Of course, I ha-, I have too, but not like
hers. 

B.176:  Uh-huh. 

A.177:  And I always get after her about salt and everything else.  And she just
will, I mean, she's going to eat the same way she ate, you know,

B.178:  # That's right.  #

A.179:  # her whole # life.  And she just tells, more or less tells me to shut up,
you know. 

B.180:  Right [laughter]. 

A.181:  And, uh, I like to, I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the
same way. 

B.182:  Uh-huh. 

A.183:  Uh,

B.184:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.185:  # uh, # it's, it's not the (()). I listen to, uh, Larry ((Newarth)) on the
weekend.  He's a fitness expert and, uh, he talks about, you know, the chicken
and the rice --

B.186:  Uh-huh. 

A.187:  -- and everything else.  And, and, uh, throwing away peanut butter and all
the things [laughter], 

B.188:  # [Laughter].  #

A.189:  # you # know, the things not to eat, you know, ever.  I think the peanut
butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever.  And then he's got me into
making eggs without the yolk. 

B.190:  Wow!

A.191:  You know, try that sometime. 

B.192:  Uh-huh. 

A.193:  My wife says she can't stand it.  But, uh, when I make scrambled eggs now,
talking about a recipe,

B.194:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.195:  # I, # say if I have four eggs, not, not for me, but if I'm making four
eggs, uh, even for my daughter and I, I'll take out all the yolks but one. 

B.196:  Wow!

A.197:  And and it's fine.  You, you don't miss it, uh. 

B.198:  Huh. 

A.199:  In fact, when I, when I make eggs for myself, if I, if I fry them, throw
them in there, I will almost hard fry them so I can take, not eat the yolk at
all. 

B.200:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.201:  And you don't really miss it.  You get the flavor of the yolk, but, uh you
don't eat it at all, you know.  You don't, they're hard.  You get like, uh, a
bite at, at the m-, most. 

B.202:  Uh-huh. 

A.203:  And so, uh, for cholesterol, I mean, I'm trying that.  And it has worked. 
My cholesterol gone down twenty points.  So, although,

B.204:  # Wow, that's good.  #

A.205:  # I haven't gotten # on the, which, whether yu-, butter or cholest-, not
cholesterol, margarine and all that.  I don't know, know, whether any of that
is true, you know {fade out}.

B.206:  Uh-huh. 

A.207:  Whether the margarines or butter,
