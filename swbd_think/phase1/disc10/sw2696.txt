REMARKS:        Tape skips in many places.  Skipping of tape on separated 
conversations made it almost impossible to understand the individual speakers.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Do you exercise every night or not?

@B.2:  No, I do it in spurts.  

A.3:  Do you?

B.4:  Yes.  And I've, I should do it on a regular basis, but, uh, for some
reason, I think it's tough to get into a, a particular routine.

A.5:  Yeah.  I, I'm on, uh, a right now I'm on one of those jags where I, I
exercise at, well I, I run every night.

B.6:  Oh.

A.7:  And, uh, [sigh] I just, I was surprised I could run.  I didn't think I
could.  I thought well I, maybe a half a block I can run.  But --

B.8:  #Yeah.#

A.9:  -- #I# have really amazed myself.  But what I do, I walk, oh, about a half
a mile, and I walk uphill.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  And then I run all the way back down.  By the time I get down to my street,
I've worked up a pretty good momentum, and I can just keep right on running
until I get home.  And, uh, [sigh] I'm not, right now I just got through doing
it.  So I'm a little bit out of breath.  I'm really --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- not as winded as I would thought, thought I was going to be.

B.14:  A very appropriate topic then.

A.15:  Yes. #[laughter].#

B.16:  #Yeah.#  #[laughter].#

A.17:  #Fantastic.#  I think, gosh, I just got b-, got in from running, and I
thought, well, now, I'll place this call real quick.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  But I have a little dog I run with.  So, [sigh] I'm, and she's getting old.
I don't know if I, it's probably not good for her, but it's good for me.

B.20:  I think it's probably as good for her anyway.

A.21:  Yeah.  I think so.

B.22:  They're, they're natural.  I do a lot of, uh, hunting,

A.23:  Oh, do you?

B.24:  and have a bird dog.  And I enjoy watching that dog run more than I do
anything.

A.25:  Yeah.  Aren't they pretty?

B.26:  They are.  

A.27:  (( )).

B.28:  They're just beautiful.  And, and the native instinct that they have --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- is just amazing to watch.

A.31:  Is it a Pointer or?

B.32:  It's a Setter.

A.33:  Setter, 

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  yeah, I think they're the prettiest.

B.36:  Yeah, that's a good combination pet and hunting dog both.

A.37:  I had, uh, a Greyhound I was race, I was running with but, uh,

B.38:  Oh, my you are ambitious [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter] He was, I fo-, I just, I tried, uh, I finally had to give her
back to the Greyhound Association.  She was just too big for me.  She, she
weighed seventy pounds and, uh, sh-, if she would run with me, you know, and
stay with me.  But if she saw something she wanted, if she wanted to get away,
she could have.  She would have drug me and I, when I walked with her, people,
you know, would laugh because she drug me when I tried to walk.

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  And when I tried to run, I was afraid she'd really take out running and
just have, and they can run I think, uh, forty miles an hour.  And, uh, gosh,
uh, she got away from me a couple of times.  And so I'd rather run with a
little Pekingese any old day [laughter].

B.42:  Yeah [laughter].

A.43:  They're my, my, they're more my style [laughter].

B.44:  Are, so you just run in your neighborhood? 

A.45:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  I'm too chicken to get out any place else.

B.48:  I, do you belong to a health club?

A.49:  No. 

B.50:  No. I've, I've done some of that and the Y M C A,  

A.51:  Oh, have you?

B.52:  and other types of things too.  Uh, I just don't enjoy running.  I, I
enjoy walking fast,

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  and with hand weights and things like that.  But,

A.55:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well that might be my,

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  I have a walking tape I use.  I bought me a little head set, you know,

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  and a little walking tape which really helps.  But, but I wanted to run
for some reason, and you know, and I, I really didn't think I could.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Because I, I remember years ago when I tried, my side would hurt real bad
and everything.  But I, I'm on a health kick.  I've decided.  Uh, my
cholesterol is high and my triglyceride's high.  So I've, I've, uh, done that,
and I'm on, uh, I, everybody says I don't need to lose weight, but I feel I
must.  So I'm going to try to lose ten pounds.  And I've lost four of it. 
So --

B.62:  Oh good.

A.63:  -- I'm really,

B.64:  Yeah, running, there's no question that running will, will get your
attention as far as, uh, weight control.  But,

A.65:  Yeah.  And I do it every night.

B.66:  Um.

A.67:  Except for I, I do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week, so I
don't do it that night.  But the other, uh, six days a week I run.

B.68:  Do you run with anyone?

A.69:  No, just my dog.

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  I had a neighbor across the street that was going with me, but she can't
run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something.  And so I, uh,
what I do, I'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then
I run home.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  If she's home.  She's a flight attendant, so she's not home very often and
so when she's home, I run with her, but her, walk with her.  But,

B.74:  But do you, do you have that feeling of boredom sometimes in running 
or,

A.75:  I would  if I didn't have this radio on my head.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  I, I think I, in fact I haven't been using my walking tape since I've been
running.  I've been using just my radio.  And if [barking] I didn't have that
to go, but I have to, what I do is, I have to set goals for myself.  I say,
Okay, I'm going to make it to the end of that block.  And then when I get
there, I'm going, Okay, I've got to make, I just go a block at a time.

B.78:  Yeah. 

A.79:  If I didn't, I, I don't think I could make it.  And I need feel to run, you
know, three and four miles, I don't think I could do it.  I co-, you know, I,
a mile is real.  And it may not even be a mile I'm running, it feels, it looks
like a mile to me, but it may not be.

B.80:  Um.  Well, you ought to get in the car and measure it one time [laughter].

A.81:  Yeah, I think I will this weekend.  I, but I'm almost afraid to.  I'm
afraid that it's (( )) [laughter],

B.82:  [Laughter].

A.83:  Oh, all this for nothing, you know.  

B.84:  Oh.

A.85:  I could go a little bit further, but I just don't, you know.  Golly, I'm
not a spring chicken any more.  And I don't want to have to, uh.  My daughter
got after me.  She said, Now, you are taking identification with you?  And I
said, No, I'm just in the neighborhood.  She says, Well, Mother, what if a car
jumps the, the road and hits you?  Or what if you stumbled and fell and
knocked yourself out, and they wouldn't know who you were.

B.86:  Your, your daughter is wise.  #We had# -- 

A.87:  #I said,# well, she is smart, you #know.#

B.88:  -- #we# had a friend, uh, who was jogging and passed out and collapsed and
had a heart attack --

A.89:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.90:  -- #and fell# over.  And they took him to the hospital and it took a while
to, to find out --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- who he was and where,

A.93:  Yeah.  I realized she was right after that.  So now I, uh, I carry a little
I D with me that shows who I, where I live anyway.  And I put my daughter's
telephone number for emergencies.  So,

B.94:  Yeah.  You know, Nancy, I think there are a lot of, uh, people now who are
paying more attention to, uh, physical fitness.  I think --

A.95:  #Oh, I# --

B.96:  -- #and I# think it's a #good idea,#  

A.97:  -- #do too.#  And I go religiously for a check up every year.  And, uh, my
triglycerides were three hundred and sixty-five.  Now this what makes me mad.
I'm, I don't eat beef.  I don't use salt.  I watch my diet all the time.  And
I, uh, it was three sixty-five.  It's supposed to be a hundred fifty.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  My cholesterol was two hundred and thirty-five.  Well, I've gotten that
down to a hundred and ninety, and my triglycerides have come down to two
seventy-three.  But they told me that it takes about three months for
triglycerides to come down.  So, it's coming down. I, and I think this, and
exercise and really watching your diet does it.  I've been on that diet that,
what's that Tommy Lasorda thing, uh, diet?

B.100:  Oh, uh,

A.101:  Ultra Fast, Ultra --

B.102:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  

A.103:  -- Slim, yeah, Slim Fast, that's it.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  I've been doing that, and it's not too bad.  I, I don't need,

B.106:  Have you tried niacin?

A.107:  Huh? 

B.108:  Have you tried niacin?

A.109:  No, but I'll tell you what I'm doing.  I'm doing the, uh, omega fish, fish
oil,

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  calcium, leci-, lecithin, 

B.112:  Oat bran? 

A.113:  uh, vitamin B six.

B.114:  Have you tried oat bran?

A.115:  No, but I'll, that's my next step.  I'm (( )) [laughter],

B.116:  Okay. [laughter] My wife, uh, went on that on a very strict basis,

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  and it really brought everything down.

A.119:  Did it?  Well, they, they say that, the nurse at works said the, uh, the
fish oil would, uh, bring it down.  And the lecithin is supposed to bring your
cholesterol down.

B.120:  Huh.

A.121:  So, and my doctor really was more concerned with, uh, my triglycerides.
But he said, Well, my God, Nancy, no wonder you, you have high trigly-.  Look
how your weight's jumped.  And it jumped seven pounds in one year.  I'm, you'd
think I was, I'm a, a size eight.  I said, That's not fat.  I know, you know,
logically, that is not fat.

B.122:  Huh-uh.  

A.123:  But I do realize I need to, to lose some weight.  But,

B.124:  Well, I think keeping in, in physical shape helps the mental shape too.

A.125:  Oh, I do too.  Absolutely.  And I feel so much better about myself when I,
you know, get into good shape.  When I lived in Orlando, I went to Weight
Watchers.  And I, I went from a size twelve to a size six in three months.

B.126:  Yeah.  Do you play tennis or golf or anything?

A.127:  No, [sigh] I'm not real sporty.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  Years ago, I used to play tennis, but I'm so bad I ended up, you know, just
chasing the ball all the time.  I'd like to do tennis again but, uh,

B.130:  Yeah, I enjoy that.  And that, and I, I think I use that as a phase of, of
my exercise program.

A.131:  Well, that's good exercise.  

B.132:  Yeah.  

A.133:  Do you exercise, uh, do you play tennis very often?

B.134:  Uh, when it gets warm, yes. 

A.135:  Oh, do you?

B.136:  Yes.  

A.137:  Now see, I'll quit running when it gets warm, when it gets hot, I know.

B.138:  Right.

A.139:  There's no way I'll get out in that heat and run --

B.140:  Oh.

A.141:  -- or even walk.

B.142:  [Laughter].

A.143:  [Laughter] I'll probably #balloon up.#

B.144:  #Early morning# and late evening.

A.145:  Yeah.  I'll, it'll have to be, well, #you know,#

B.146:  #Early morning# is a good time.

A.147:  I know, but then you have to go to work all, uh, 

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  I shower at night.  

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  But I, I may just have to change my schedule.  I don't, yeah, early in the
morning, about five in the morning, five-thirty in the #morning when it first
gets,#

B.152:  #Oh, very, very comfortable# then.  Right.

A.153:  Isn-, yeah.  That's what I'll have to do.  And I'm really scared to go out
at night after dark.

B.154:  Oh, yes, #yes.#

A.155:  #I,# not in this day and time.  And, you know, when I grew up, it was
different.  But nowadays, y-, I wouldn't, I, I'm not foolish enough to do
that.

B.156:  Well, I see people with mace,

A.157:  [Barking] {Loudly in background}.

B.158:  and other things.

A.159:  Yeah.

@@B.160:  Is that, is that your dog calling you to go running again?

A.161:  Yeah.

B.162:  [Laughter].

A.163:  She doesn't like me on the telephone.  She's so jealous.

B.164:  Oh, okay [laughter].    

A.165:  [Laughter] So, well it's been nice talking to you and, uh,

B.166:  It certainly has and good luck.  Keep it up. 

A.167:  You too.

B.168:  Bye.

A.169:  Bye-bye [/barking].
