REMARKS:        Dog could be heard (faintly) barking in background 
throughout recording on Speaker B side of conversation.  Unusually 
easy recording to transcribe.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Texas, how you doing?

B.2:  All right. 

A.3:  Good, good, good.  Have you been participating in this, uh, program very
much? [barking]  {faintly}.

B.4:  Oh, uh, ever since they really got started. 

A.5:  Oh, okay. 

B.6:  Uh, maybe a phone call a week or something like that. 

A.7:  Yeah, yeah.  I try to get one a day, and s-, I'm leaving the country here
in the next week, and I [laughter] want to get every, I want to get as many as
I can.

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  Uh, okay, Bill, you about ready to get started?

@B.10:  I guess so.  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  [Beep]  {Telephone signal sound} Uh, Bill, what kind of a company are you
with?

B.12:  I'm with a [throat_clearing]  electronics company. 

A.13:  Oh, okay. 

B.14:  Uh, I've been an engineer all my life and, uh, that's one of the, the
issues that I have with the company.  That, uh, you know, the salary is, is
one benefit but, uh, I feel as an engineer that, uh, you know, I take pride in
my work.  And, uh, getting credit for that and recognition for the work that
you do.  And having challenging work, uh, doing challenging assignments is one
of the, one of the payments that you get for your time.

A.15:  Right.  Uh, do, do you think the benefits package is fair?

B.16:  I think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  But, uh, you know, it's, uh, sometimes quite a struggle to, uh, to do work
that's challenging and find challenging assignments. 

A.19:  Yeah. 

B.20:  I feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that, uh, you
know, engineers become what I call clerical engineers.  They spend their time
pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to, uh, to other
people. 

A.21:  Yeah.  You sound like, you sound like my own situation.  Uh, how old are
you, Bill?

B.22:  I'm, uh, fifty-four. 

A.23:  Oh, hey, I'm fifty-seven.  Sounds like the same situation here.  Uh, I'm
with T I of course,

B.24:  # Uh-huh [noise].  #

A.25:  # and our, # our benefits, it, it's interesting, uh, because that's one of
the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits.  Whether it be the health
insurance or, or the food or, [laughter]  or other things.  Uh, however,
recently, I've had a chance to sample the outside. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  And, uh, probably by industry standards, we're probably in the top seventy
percent. 

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  Uh, the, uh, uh, I've, I've really, in fact what I'm doing is, I'm, uh,
retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. 

A.31:  Uh, primarily for some of the things that you stated.  Uh, I've spent, uh,
eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia. 

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  And I've just had a real ball.  And, uh, since I've been back, part of my
job is, is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants, which is okay.  But
the other part, [laughter]  the other part's pushing paper. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. 

A.35:  And, uh, uh, which I don't like.  I got the opportunity to go with another
company.  In fact, uh, a, uh, a semiconductor, uh, uh, assembly house that
supplies us, uh, where the, uh, where the job will be a hundred percent going
into their various plants, trouble shooting. 

B.36:  Uh-huh. 

A.37:  And, and I'm going to do that beginning the first of May.  But, uh, uh,
in-, in-, interestingly enough though, uh, the, the biggest grind, I've been,
I've been with T I thirty-two years.  Uh, the biggest gripe in T I is the
benefits package.  But as I go looking at other companies as I've, I've had a
chance to do, uh, it's really not all that bad.  Uh, the, one of the biggest
gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program.

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  And I guess they've all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical
care. 

B.40:  Yes, I think so. 

A.41:  And, and I, I think that's the type of thing that, uh, uh, that it, that it
amounts to.  Uh, what kind of vacation policy, how long have you been with your
company, Bill?

B.42:  I've been there thirty-two years. 

A.43:  Thirty-two, ha, ha, sounds familiar [laughter]. 

B.44:  Yeah. 

A.45:  What kind of vacation, uh, uh, restrictions do you have? Or, or I shouldn't
say restrictions, policy?

B.46:  Well, after being there for this long, I get, uh, four weeks a year.  And I
have an option to, uh, trade salary for an extra week. 

A.47:  Oh, neat, neat, neat.  Uh, when, when did you get into the, uh, uh, when
did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks?

B.48:  Uh, let me see, how does it work? Uh, after you get two weeks up until five
years, and then you get an additional day, uh, each year thereafter, up until
ten years. 

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  And then thereafter, every other year you get an additional day. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  So by the time you've been there twenty years, you get the four weeks. 

A.53:  You get a full four weeks, yeah.  Yeah, we get two weeks after a year, uh,
uh, three, thre-, three weeks between five and fifteen, and four weeks over
fifteen. 

B.54:  Huh, okay. 

A.55:  And, uh, uh, are you allowed to, how many days are you allowed to accrue?

B.56:  None.  No carryover whatsoever. 

A.57:  Oh, so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or, or you lose
it. 

B.58:  Right. 

A.59:  Okay.  Well, we've got, we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch.  I'm not
exactly sure, uh, on a year to year basis what it is because I accrued most of
mine before they put in the restrictions. 

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  Uh, and then they, they grandfathered our old days. 

B.62:  Right. 

A.63:  Uh, but what it, what it, uh, the bottom line is that when you die, retire
or quit, the most you can get paid for is seventy days. 

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  Which is fourteen weeks. 

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  Which is, which is a pretty nice little bonus.  I think with, with retiring
here in the next three days, uh, I have eighty-five days vacation.  And, and it
would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April, but I had
so many things I had to do before I finished, I didn't get to do that.  So I'm,
in essence going to be giving those back to the company, or most of them back. 

B.68:  Um. 

A.69:  But at least I get paid for seventy days.  Which in your situation, you
don't.  I mean when you go out, you probably get just the ones you have in that
current year, right?

B.70:  That's right. 

A.71:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's inter-, interesting. 

B.72:  ((Now)) we're allowed to accrue sick leave but, uh,

A.73:  Oh, okay.  Well, see we, we don't have any, any such thing as sick leave. 
Uh, if you're exempt and you've been here over three years or four years or
something like that, you can be sick up to six months and still get paid. 

B.74:  Huh.  Okay. 

A.75:  And, and, and, uh, uh, that, uh, do you have a, uh, long and short term
disability program?

B.76:  Yes, we do. 

A.77:  Yeah.  And we get half, half pay, uh, or full pay for six months and half
pay for the remainder of the disability, I guess is how it works. 

B.78:  Huh. 

A.79:  And, uh, uh, that's interesting.  How, how many vacation days do you all
get?

B.80:  You mean, uh, mean holidays?

A.81:  Yeah.  I meant holidays, yeah. 

B.82:  Uh, I don't know the exact count.  Uh, they took away some of the minor
holidays a few years back and we get Christmas week off. 

A.83:  Oh, okay.  Okay, so it probably all adds #up#  --

B.84:  #(( )) so,#

A.85:  -- to the same. 

B.86:  Yeah.  We traded in Veterans Day and, uh, and I guess Good Friday or
something like that --

A.87:  Yeah.  It,

B.88:  -- uh, in favor of having a week off at Christmas. 

A.89:  Yeah,

B.90:  # I, #

A.91:  # yeah.  #

B.92:  I'm not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at Christmas time
because,

A.93:  No, I guess that's true.  I, I guess, see most of us and like yourself,
where you've got four weeks, you can take plenty throughout the year and still
have a week, even if it weren't a company holiday, you'd still have some time
left over at Christmas. 

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  And, uh, I, I guess what happens is, we don't have Christmas week, we have
Christmas plus a day around Christmas.  A day before or a day after as official
holidays. 

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  But there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off, so
much vacation time coming, that you will find virtually no one in the plant. 

B.98:  Well, I think that's the reason our plant went that way.  #What,#

A.99:  #Yeah.#  #Probably#  --

B.100:  #we,# 

A.101:   -- #something,# 

B.102:  # we have, # uh, a lot of government contract work --

A.103:  Yeah. 

B.104:  -- and we find that in that last, uh, couple of week of the year, all the
government people are use it or lose it situation. 

A.105:  Yeah.  So they're all gone. 

B.106:  So all [laughter]  our customers are nonexistent. 

A.107:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's what happened to us.  I think the last, the
last holiday we got was in the middle, uh, seventies.  And, uh, uh, and that
one was the, uh, Friday after Thanksgiving.  And I think the reason we got it
for a holiday was nobody worked it anyway [laughter].

B.108:  Yeah. 

A.109:  [Laughter]  It just kept us from taking a day's vacation. 

B.110:  Uh-huh. 

A.111:  Uh, we get, we get, uh, New Years Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, July
Fourth, Labor Day, uh, Thanksgiving and the day after, and then Christmas and a
day either side of it. 

B.112:  Oh, okay. 

A.113:  Which, which comes out to about nine. 

B.114:  Yeah. 

A.115:  And, uh, and, and just since I've been here, I mean, when I got here we
didn't even get Memorial Day. 

B.116:  Huh, that's strange. 

A.117:  And it, it wasn't recognized here in the deep South [laughter].  And we
got, uh, uh, and Good Friday came along, I think, uh, in about nineteen seventy
we got a chance to vote on it. 

B.118:  Huh. 

A.119:  And we had to vote on, on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because
we didn't get that day then.  And I always felt that it wasn't a religious
motive that gave us Good Friday.  The, the, the employees voted for Good
Friday.  It was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch
without a holiday, it was just nice to put one in there in the Spring
[laughter]. 

B.120:  Yeah.  We're sort of in that situation.  We do get, uh, uh, George
Washington's birthday. 

A.121:  Oh, okay.  So yo-,

B.122:  But it's still a long dry stretch from then until, uh, Memorial Day. 

A.123:  Yeah.  Are, are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance?

B.124:  Uh, I'm kind of cross with it this year.  We changed, uh, uh, managers for
the plan.  We had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield. 

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  And, uh, we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system. 
But they've gone to a managed care program.  And we had to, [static]  e-, even
though we were right in the middle of the area, we had to opt out.  Because
there're no physicians in the area that are taking patients. 

A.127:  Oh, my goodness. 

B.128:  And it's absolutely pathetic up here.  Uh, so far the insurance company
owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in.

A.129:  My goodness.  That's tough.  Uh, we had, uh, we've been with Aetna. 
Actually I think we fin-, fund our own insurance program.  Aetna just
administers paying the bills. 

B.130:  Yeah.  That's the way our company works. 

A.131:  Yeah.  And, and, and the, uh, uh, they started out with having Managed
Mental Health Care. 

B.132:  Uh-huh. 

A.133:  And then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a
network hospital.  And we just got a notice the other day, saying that, uh,
that we're going to have, uh, uh, network doctors.

B.134:  Yeah. 

A.135:  And, and they're going to, the way they're going to work into this is,
they're going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people.
And, uh, write to them all and tell them that they've got an opportunity
[laughter] to be part of this program.

B.136:  #Yeah.  Our, in our,#

A.137:  #And they, and,# 

B.138:  area they all turned it down. 

A.139:  #Yeah.# 

B.140:  #They# say forget it. 

A.141:  No kidding [/barking]. 

B.142:  Uh, if this patient {sound fading} wants to, wants to go somewhere else,
let him go there.
