quality.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Yes [laughter].  So what have you painted recently?

B.2:  All right.  Oh, recently, let me think.  Actually, recently I've just done
some, you know touch up types of painting although I'm looking at a few of the
ceilings like, uh, in the family room and, uh, I'm wondering if I should take
that project on myself and that's a little harder [breathing].  Uh,
[lipsmack], yeah you know me well [laughter] so, yeah I do most of the
painting myself.  Uh, you know, uh, outdoors, no, you know, outdoors, uh, gets
too high with, you know, have to hire a professional for that.  Uh, what about
you?

A.3:  Well, my kitchen ceiling has needed painting for, uh, four years now,
[laughter], 

B.4:  [Laughter] [breathing] [throat_clearing]. 

A.5:  and I'm, [breathing]  having painted the apartment that I left in Syracuse,
I, I really hesitate to do ceilings because I get more paint on me than on,
[breathing]  on the the ceiling.  But now that they redid the roofs, all of our
ceilings need it because it popped a lot of nails. 

B.6:  Uh-huh. 

A.7:  So, I think this summer I'm going to take on the kitchen first and then try
to do the others because I want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all
through the house. 

B.8:  Oh, okay. 

A.9:  So, I think [laughter], 

B.10:  So that, that's a lot of, uh, yeah, you've got your work laid out for you. 

A.11:  Right.  I figure by, by, doing it before I put in the carpeting, [laughter]
you know the carpet is so bad, whatever I spill, it's too bad [laughter].

B.12:  Right, well, that's, that's a good idea.  Get, get the pointing over with
and then the carpet's going to go anyway. 

A.13:  Right. 

B.14:  Right, yeah.  Well, uh, uh, I'm thinking for this summer of, uh, I'm
contemplating actually [breathing], uh, doing a lot of wallpaper I think in
the basement, you know what having a problem of the basement being finished,
but you know, with, uh, it's being used as a recreation center [talking].
It's, uh, it's con-, either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe
putting something more durable that I can wipe down and doesn't have to be
painted all the time.

A.15:  Right. 

B.16:  And, so I'm thinking of maybe, uh, [lipsmack] you know if I can find some
fairly neutral, tasteful wallpapers of maybe just papering and, and that has
seemed to work pretty well upstairs, you know, with, with kids, so it's, uh,
you know, it doesn't require that every year the house has to be repainted
which usually I guess most people must paint about every two years.

A.17:  Oh, I would hope not because it seems to me that it would get too thick,
uh, and start peeling maybe.

B.18:  Oh, really? Yeah, I, I don't know I always assumed,

A.19:  I think, it's, sh-, I don't know, my, my impression is, it's more like four
y-, four years it starts needing it and people usually get around to it at five
or six [laughter]  years. 

B.20:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I think that's true.  I mean some of the areas haven't
been touched since we moved in six years ago [breathing].  I know exterior
paints, really if it's done well, uh, two good coats and a primer, uh, I think,
uh, exterior paint probably should last somewhere around seven to ten years I
think. 

A.21:  Oh, exterior, that long? That would be,

B.22:  Uh, I, I thought so, you know, I would say no less than, definitely no less
than five.  I think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then
there's probably something going on with the wood.  Uh, [lipsmack],  I don't
know, uh, that, that's my impression. 

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  People don't do the outsides as often.  I know in this neighborhood it
seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted
and that was the, the first time,

A.25:  # But, that's just trim, right?#

B.26:  # for most people.  #

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  [Lipsmack] Uh, yeah, trim, yeah, the aluminum doesn't need to be painted --

A.29:  Right. 

B.30:  -- but, yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first
time and that was five years. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  Uh, course the f-, original coat was so bad that maybe five years even
wouldn't have been necessary if it had been done correctly the first time, you
know. 

A.33:  Right. 

B.34:  Uh, interior I don't know.  I have known people that every, about every two
years they, they redo their paint and I guess a lot of the, the drywall in
these houses soaks so much of the paint in.

A.35:  Oh, okay, okay. 

B.36:  And, uh, maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't, uh, this would be
too often.  But I think, I think with the drywall they use now, the plaster
board really seems to soak in the paint,

A.37:  # Um.  #

B.38:  # so # I'm not, I'm not sure two years would be too often.  I don't want to
do it that oft-, [laughter]. 

A.39:  I know I was going to say, what a mess [laughter]. 

B.40:  No, no I don't want to.  It's a, that's one of the things, I don't enjoy
painting that much like, yes, uh, it's okay for a while.  But I find it gets,
it gets, uh, boring or tiring pretty quickly [laughter] so,

A.41:  Right, right. 

B.42:  [Breathing]  Yeah. 

A.43:  Yeah.  Well, very good. 

B.44:  Yeah, yeah [lipsmack]. 

A.45:  But,

B.46:  So [laughter], 

A.47:  Small world [laughter]. 

B.48:  Uh, (( )) that's really [laughter]  [talking], 

A.49:  Anyway, so, uh, and then you're pleased with your, your jobs once you're
done. 

B.50:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.51:  I mean, you don't feel you should have paid somebody to do the same job,

B.52:  # No.  #

A.53:  # you # did anyway [laughter]. 

B.54:  No, no, not at all.  I, I, I think that, uh, what, uh, the, the work that
I've done, that's one reason I do it, uh, if, if I really felt that it was
going to be a sloppy job and I was sorry, you, afterward the way it looks I
wouldn't attempt to take it on.  But [breathing], uh, there are a few tricks,
you know, that you learn to use and I've found that, uh, [lipsmack] the one
sided paper type of tape that peels off is, is just excellent.  I used to, I
used to try to edge when, as I'd get up toward the ceilings, and I found
that's really impossible to do, but when you use the, the one edge paper, uh,
it, it really makes a nice neat job.  You know, you let the paint dry for
about a half an hour, an hour and peel it off and [lipsmack] it's a perfect
clean line.  And, and I've found that it can also be used, uh, well, like I've
gone back and I've painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown
moldings and things like that.  And, again, the tape really comes in handy.
You just cover up anything you don't want paint to get on and paint and take
it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape.  It just peels off like
those notepads type of thing.

A.55:  But this isn't masking tape. 

B.56:  No, it's not a masking tape.  It's, it's about, uh, you can get it in
different widths, I'd say the most narrow is about two inches and it gets about
as wide as four inches.  The glue on it is not across the whole thing.  It's
only across the top much like the,

A.57:  # Oh.  #

B.58:  # yellow # notepads,

A.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.60:  # that # you peel off [breathing] and it just comes in big rolls.  And so
if you're doing [lipsmack], you don't want to get paint on the ceiling, for
example, say you want the ceiling a different color, [breathing] you roll this
tape all along the length of the room, you paint right up against it, you can
even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry, most
interior paints seem like they're dry within a, a half an hour, an hour, you
just peel this tape off and it's enough that enough glue or whatever is on it
that it, it stays while you're painting but it doesn't do any damage to paint
or wallpaper that's,

A.61:  # Oh, great.  #

B.62:  # underneath it.  # So it's really good.  Uh, you know, I've put it up
along the, uh, well I've had borders,

A.63:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.64:  # up # near the ceiling in the living room.  I've put the tape along there
and then painted the crown molding and it did-, didn't do any damage to the,

A.65:  # Oh, great.  #

B.66:  # wallpaper.  Uh, # so that's, you know, so I think there are a few little
things, uh, different size brushes, good brushes, I guess a lot of people make
the mistake, I've found good brushes make a big difference. 

A.67:  Do you ever use these,

B.68:  # Uh, #

A.69:  # pads.  # I pad the paint on. 

B.70:  Oh, I've had, yes, I've used those,

A.71:  # Yeah.  #

B.72:  # and # I like those, actually, they cover a lot more area, and they're not
as [talking],  you don't get drips as, well, you can get drips,

A.73:  # Right.  #

B.74:  # you # have to be a little careful,

A.75:  # Yeah.  #

B.76:  # but # they hold quite a bit of paint.  So I found you're not constantly
dipping. 

A.77:  Right. 

B.78:  Like with a brush.  And, uh, it goes on very nice and evenly, like
sometimes with brushes you can sort of,

A.79:  # Yeah.  #

B.80:  # see # streaks if you get it too thick.  And you don't have splatters,

A.81:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

B.82:  # like with # a roller.  So I do, I do like those.  And sometimes I guess
if you're good at it, you could, uh, you could use it to inch up towards
ceilings and things like that.  Although I've never been [breathing] that good
at doing that.  I've found that the tape works,

A.83:  # Right.  #

B.84:  # best # for me. 

A.85:  Now even with tape I think, I was just thinking of using the pads instead
of a brush, but for ceilings I did try it and [laughter] and, uh, I got a lot
of paint on the kitchen table.  I was trying to, to just patch the, the
kitchen ceiling there.

B.86:  Oh, is that right?

A.87:  Yeah.  And so I have to learn how to use pads, but I have a friend in
Syracuse who, who paints everything with pads and she does ceilings. 

B.88:  Uh-huh. 

A.89:  So I'm going to,

B.90:  # Yeah.  #

A.91:  # have # to ask her what the trick is.  She'll probably say hire me to come
down and do it [laughter]. 

B.92:  Yeah, yeah, well, I don't, yeah that's right.  I don't, I don't know, I
guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that you have to put a
minimal amount of paint on there.  You probably [breathing]  aren't going to be
able to cover as much of,

A.93:  # Right.  #

B.94:  # a # surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips
you can just sort of smooth it all out.  [breathing]  Uh, and I haven't tried
that, but that's an idea because I find that ceilings are really difficult in
terms of how you have to be positioned to do them,

A.95:  # Right [laughter].  #

B.96:  # and your # arms are up, so [laughter],  it's tiring.  Uh,

A.97:  Right.  That's why I want to do the kitchen first.  I figure I can stand on
the kitchen table [laughter]. 

B.98:  [Laughter] yeah, that's true.  Uh, so have you been happy with the painting
that you've done or do you wish that you, you had hired a professional or,

A.99:  No, I, I'm happy with it.  But, I just don't do it very often or very much
because it's so time consuming and because I am, tend to be a perfectionist,

B.100:  # Right.  #

A.101:  # about # it.  And,

B.102:  # Yeah.  #

A.103:  # you # know,

B.104:  # Yeah.  #

A.105:  # what # I figure is first I have to scrub the walls.  And,

B.106:  # Right.  #

A.107:  # I # mean, if you hire a painter they don't do that.  Just,

B.108:  Wha-, does scrubbing is that just, is that to get smudges off so they,

A.109:  No, to,
