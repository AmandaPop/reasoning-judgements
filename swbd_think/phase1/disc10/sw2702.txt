=======================================================================

B.1:  [Clanking] {dishes} [talking] {woman and children} [music].

A.2:  Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy
convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something, I guess the next car I'll
be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door [laughter].

B.3:  [Laughter]  What kind of a car do you have now?  

A.4:  Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight, and then, uh, our, our
newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.

B.5:  Yeah.  

A.6:  And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same
style.

B.7:  Yeah.  

A.8:  That same kind of four door, hard top style.

B.9:  You got kids?

A.10:  Uh, no but we're planning for it.  

B.11:  Okay.

A.12:  So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta
Eighty-Eight but it's in pretty good sh-, in really good shape.

B.13:  Yeah.

A.14:  And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  So that's probably where the first place we'd look.

B.17:  Huh. 

A.18:  But, uh,

B.19:  Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership
[laughter].

A.22:  That'll do it.

B.23:  Yeah.  That'll do it.  Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape.  I
think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something
that can haul the kids to baseball practice --

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  -- and piano lessons, and we've got a minivan, 

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  and that's great.  And I d-, drive, uh, well I used to drive an Escort,
but it died on me.

A.28:  [Laughter].

B.29:  [Throat_clearing] So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used
to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day.

A.30:  Oh, geez.

B.31:  And, uh, and this Escort took it all.  And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I
was at ninety-four thousand miles on it, and the engine just went.

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries,

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  which has been okay.

A.36:  Really?

B.37:  I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.  

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  But it, it al-, it's an eighty-five Aries, but it only had thirty-four
thousand miles on it when I bought it.

A.40:  Oh, geez. 

B.41:  And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.  So it's just a ten minute
commute every day.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  So, uh, it [laughter] doesn't get much of, uh, I mean, it's not like I'm
putting it through its paces.

A.44:  Yeah, yeah.

B.45:  But I think, uh, and it's a four door which is nice,

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  but it's still a little cramped.  I've got three kids,

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  #so I, I,# 

A.50:  #Sounds like you,# you need at least like a Taurus size,

B.51:  Yeah, that's what,

A.52:  or something like that.

B.53:  I was thinking of, was a Taurus.  Uh,

A.54:  Yeah.  I, I know a lot of guys at work, they, uh, the ones that have, uh,
families, uh, and they still want kind of a sports car.  They've been, uh, a
lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's.  That I guess it's the
sports version --

B.55:  Oh, really? 

A.56:  -- of the Taurus?  

B.57:  Yeah [Door].

A.58:  In fact, it comes with a standard stick and, uh, 

B.59:  Ooh.

A.60:  and a lot of those.  And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like
that.  But, uh,

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  and usually they're in like black,

B.63:  [Laughter].

A.64:  and gun metal grey and those kind of colors.  You're not going to see
too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.  But, uh, 

B.67:  Yeah.  Well, my wife wants a Miata.  

A.68:  Oh, well sure [Laughter]. 

B.69:  [Laughter].   

A.70:  That's what, you know, until, until you look at the price tag and then --

B.71:  Right.

A.72:  -- you go, What?  What would I, besides tooling around and looking really
cool --

B.73:  Right, yeah.

A.74:  -- and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?

B.75:  I know, I know.  It's like I, I guess I could fit in it [laughter],

A.76:  Yeah.  I, 

B.77:  maybe [Static].

A.78:  I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college.  I had
an old car that I bought just to get to, to my j-, my first job.

B.79:  Yeah.

A.80:  And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.

B.81:  #Oh.#

A.82:  #And# I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a 
two seater, uh, sports car.

B.83:  Yeah.

A.84:  But that, that just does not make it as an only car.

B.85:  [Laughter]

A.86:  It's, uh, it's like I, I would, I bought a set of stereo speakers --

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  -- and it was one of those cash and carry deals.  I had to take them one at
a time,

B.89:  [Laughter].

A.90:  with the top down.  And it was winter, so I was in like this coat --

B.91:  Oh, no!

A.92:  -- with the top down, and the speaker in the passenger seat.

B.93:  Yeah [Laughter].

A.94:  And I drove that one home, and then I went back and got the other one and
put that in the,

B.95:  [Laughter].

A.96:  passenger seat and drove that one home.  And, uh, funny, funniest sight.
And da-, you kind of outgrow that real quick --

B.97:  Yeah.

A.98:  -- when it's your only car.

B.99:  Yeah.  Well, I, you know, it's funny.  Most people that I've talked to did
stuff like that when they were in college,

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  or, you know, or when they were single anyway.

A.102:  Yeah.

B.103:  They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.  I
never did that.  Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla.

A.104:  Oh, really?

B.105:  And, uh, because I got a good deal on it --

A.106:  Yeah.

B.107:  -- and, uh, that was a great little car.  Actually I met, that's how I met
girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I,
I had never, I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission.

A.108:  Uh-huh.

B.109:  And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this
car.

A.110:  Boy, that's a good deal.

B.111:  And, uh, in fact I married one of those people [Laughter].

A.112:  Ah, okay.  Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in --

B.113:  #And it worked.#

A.114:  -- #that situation again# [Laughter].

B.115:  Yeah, it worked all right, real good.

A.116:  Huh.  Because I, I know we've, uh, that's, that's something that, that we
definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission.  My, uh, my wife just
does-, can't, can't, uh, she really doesn't want to learn I guess,

B.117:  Yeah, yeah.

A.118:  the, uh, the standard shift.  I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh,
went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive.  We got one of these things from Lee
Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if
you'll --

B.119:  Yeah.

A.120:  -- test drive a car.  

B.121:  Yeah.

A.122:  And we went, uh, [children] we went, uh, we went to a dealership and, uh,
it, it was prev-, she, she did pretty well.  But it was one of those things
where we just went to a big parking lot --

B.123:  Yeah [Laughter].

A.124:  -- and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking, because
that was all it was.  It was, it was the funniest thing, it was like, uh,

B.125:  [Laughter].

A.126:  a big Le Baron, it was a Le Baron with everything on it,

B.127:  Wow! 

A.128:  but it had a standard shift.  It was  the --  

B.129:  That's weird!

A.130:  -- craziest thing I ever saw.

B.131:  Yeah.

A.132:  And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.

B.133:  Huh.  

A.134:  And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth.  She did
pretty well after a while.

B.135:  Yeah.

A.136:  But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.

B.137:  Well, my wife, I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.

A.138:  Uh-huh.

B.139:  And, uh, and, 

A.140:  [Breathing]. 

B.141:  in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.  In fact, the
minivan's a, has a stick shift.

A.142:  Um, okay.

B.143:  And in, this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had
anything.  You know, it's got automatic transmission, cruise control,

A.144:  Oh, geez.

B.145:  you know, electric locks.  You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car
except that it's the Dodge Aries [laughter],

A.146:  Yeah,

B.147:  you know.

A.148:  yeah.  

B.149:  So, uh, 

A.150:  Oh, well.  Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say,

B.151:  [Laughter].

A.152:  about cars [Laughter].

B.153:  Well, you, um, the, the thing about this, uh, th-, I will say this about
the minivan.

A.154:  Uh-huh.

B.155:  We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.

A.156:  Uh-huh, I would think so, yeah, 

B.157:  It, it,

A.158:  because it's so big. 

B.159:  Yeah.  And, and it was quiet, it had a stereo system.

A.160:  Oh, yeah.

B.161:  We never had it, you know, we always had the A M radio.

A.162:  Sure, sure.

B.163:  And, uh, of course this has, this (( )) that had s-, speakers that you can
control from the back seat.

A.164:  Uh-huh.

B.165:  And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat
too [Door].

A.166:  Uh-huh.

B.167:  And put s-, speaker phones in it. So.

A.168:  Now, now, now that used to be a luxury, but I bet on the next time you buy
a car, that's going to be mandatory.

B.169:  Right.

A.170:  You've got to have that now.

B.171:  That's right.  That's right.

A.172:  You're  used to it and you got to have it.

B.173:  And you've got to pay for it too.

A.174:  Yeah.  That's true [laughter]  too.

B.175:  And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when --

A.176:  It,

B.177:  -- I bought mine [Laughter].

A.178:  It probably does, it probably does.  But, uh,

B.179:  We,

@@A.180:  Oh, well.  Well, Bill it's been nice talking to you.

B.181:  Nice talking to you.

A.182:  Okay, you have a good evening.

B.183:  Thanks a lot.

A.184:  Um.  Bye-bye.

B.185:  Bye-bye  [/Clanking] [/talking] [/music].
