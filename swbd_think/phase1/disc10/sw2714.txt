REMARKS:        Speaker B had some static or background noise that floated 
in and out, and I think she also had a dog on her lap because it sounded 
like he would bark right in the phone in several places.  

=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, where are you calling from?

A.2:  From North Carolina. 

B.3:  I'm in California. 

A.4:  Yeah, that's coast to coast [laughter]. 

B.5:  [Laughter]  It sure is. 

A.6:  It's a littl-,

B.7:  # The, #

A.8:  # little # bit earlier there though. 

B.9:  Right.  It's just, uh, about twelve thirty here. 

@A.10:  But we're talking about a national topic anyway. 

B.11:  That's right and I think that anything we can do to improve the federal
budget would be [laughter], a boon to everybody no matter where they are in
the country.

A.12:  That's the truth.  And I know that we've, we've just come off a national
high with the Middle East, but now we're facing the same old problems that we
had before and that is,

B.13:  # Ye-, #

A.14:  # balancing # the budget. 

B.15:  Absolutely. 

A.16:  I don't know how California's budget is, but North Carolina's state budget
is, uh, disastrous right now too.

B.17:  Well, so is ours.  We have just been told that we're thirteen billion
dollars in the red which is more than the entire state budgets of about half a
dozen states. 

A.18:  Oh, my. 

B.19:  And they're talking about, uh, cutting, uh, aid to the schools particularly
the, uh, university systems.  And I, our local school district is going to have
to fire all it's teacher aides to balance the budget so, I thi-, things are
tough all over. 

A.20:  Oh, California has always been a leader. 

B.21:  Well [laughter],  I, I hope,

A.22:  # [Laughter].  #

B.23:  # in # this case the rest of you will be spared. 

A.24:  Oh, now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on
for,

B.25:  Oh, prop thirteen,

A.26:  # Yes.  #

B.27:  # is # the one that, uh, limits the amount that, uh, real estate taxes can
rise every year.  Property taxes can only go up a certain amount per year, uh,
until the house is sold or [barking], 

A.28:  # Right.  #

B.29:  # the # person dies,

A.30:  # Right.  #

B.31:  # and # then it's reevaluated. 

A.32:  Yeah, that, that I think was a, a smart move.  I don't know how it's worked
out, but it, it seemed very logical.  In fact, it raises one of the issues that
I've thought about, the national budget.  The budget relates to all of us,

B.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.34:  # and # so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget
process.  I've often thought that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any
new tax laws, say every four or five years instead of every year. 

B.35:  Uh-huh. 

A.36:  An individual has no opportunity, individual or corporation or any other
business entity has no opportunity to plan long range. 

B.37:  Well, that's certainly true.  We can get hit, uh, a lot of corporations at
least seem to get blindsided,

A.38:  # Oh, yeah.  #

B.39:  # by taxes # that are sometimes even retroactive,

A.40:  # To the beginning of, #

B.41:  # which I would have # thought was then unconstitutional [barking], 

A.42:  # Right.  #

B.43:  # ((but doesn't))# turn out to be. 

A.44:  Ri-, that's another thing, too, I've ofte-, often ((wondered)), seemed to
be when I was growing up I learned in Civics or Government that, uh, the House
of Representatives has to initiate all tax bills.

B.45:  Right [barking]. 

A.46:  And I don't think it's working that way, Kathleen [laughter]. 

B.47:  [Laughter] No, it's, I don't know where some of these things come from, but
they look like they're from out in left field to me.

A.48:  No, what,

B.49:  I don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting
problem but there certainly has been proposals.  Why, are you aware of the
Grace Commission proposals from a few years back?

A.50:  Uh, refresh me. 

B.51:  Well, the, W R Grace, uh, was put in charge of a commission to find
government waste. 

A.52:  Uh-huh. 

B.53:  Uh,

A.54:  # Oh, yeah.  Okay.  #

B.55:  # this is about # eight or ten years ago now,

A.56:  # Right.  #

B.57:  # and # he came out with a whole book of his group, I mean, it has his name
but he was just the administrator of it.  Of places where things like
government purchasing could be rationalized where, uh, renting of space could
be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just, you know,
incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different
government activities are redundant,

A.58:  # Oh, ((it don't)), #

B.59:  # and where and # there are billions of dollars in every years budget that
are just totally wasted,

A.60:  # Yeah.  #

B.61:  # because # nobody is running the government as if it were a business. 

A.62:  That's exactly the point.  The business,

B.63:  # And, #

A.64:  # or # personal budget either one, I've,

B.65:  Uh, we couldn't afford to do that sort of thing.  We can't, we don't have
money to throw around personally. 

A.66:  No, and when you're not responsible, and that's really what it comes down
to, because,

B.67:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.68:  # you # know, it, a government, uh, agency really doesn't care about what
the postage rate is. 

B.69:  It has no incentive to hold back on expenses.  Uh, I happened, many years
ago, to work for a state government for a while, and it absolutely boggled my
mind the way they budgeted because there was no, uh, an attempt to figure out
what it really should cost to do what we should be doing. 

A.70:  Uh-huh. 

B.71:  It was just take last year's budget add X percentage, ask for that, and if
you hadn't spent all your money by December run out and buy something,

A.72:  # Buy something,#

B.73:  # quick, #

A.74:  that's right because you,

B.75:  so that you,

A.76:  you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year. 

B.77:  That's right. 

A.78:  And,

B.79:  I can remember, uh, the entire office got new electric typewriters because
we hadn't spent all our budget money,

A.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.81:  # in # December, that was just crazy. 

A.82:  And the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people
devising the budget, uh, didn't go back to a zero based budgeting, they just
did it on the basis of ((would)) they spend,

B.83:  # That's right.  #

A.84:  # five percent # increase and, uh, go on with it. 

B.85:  We might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year,
and so no matter how foolish the expenditure, be sure we get rid of that
money.

A.86:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And, you know, grace, uh, type waste that you mentioned,
we see often how ((they did)) in the military and the defense department,

B.87:  # Absolutely.  #

A.88:  # but # it's, uh, I'm sure it's widespread to every agency. 

B.89:  I think, uh, probably if you just looked at congressional budgets,

A.90:  # [Laughter].  #

B.91:  # the # amount they waste on frivolous things, uh, with congressional
office staff is, again, mind boggling.

A.92:  Uh-huh. 

B.93:  You read about what it costs the new, uh, house ((whip)) or, uh, the, uh,
Speaker of the House to redecorate and, my God, those offices were just
redecorated a few years ago.

A.94:  Oh, yes. 

B.95:  They, it, they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.  They're spending
twenty-five thousand dollars just this year for a feasibility study to
determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs
of the Congress.

A.96:  I'm surprised it's that low, Kathleen. 

B.97:  Well, that's, that's not to build,

A.98:  # Oh, I know, #

B.99:  # one (( )) # that's just,

A.100:  I'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that [laughter]. 

B.101:  [Laughter] Well, uh, that's the kind of thing that makes me mad.  I want to
vote the whole batch of them out of office if that's the way they think they
should spend our money, and just because it's a few hundred thousand here,

A.102:  # Oh, yes.  #

B.103:  # who was # it said a, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon we're
talking about real money. 

A.104:  Yeah [laughter].  That's sad. 

B.105:  I think that was old Everett (( )).

A.106:  That's sad. 

B.107:  Somebody. 

A.108:  And people don't realize it, we've become sort of blas3e about the, uh,
amount of money because a billion if, if the government paid a dollar a second
back in the national debt, just a dollar a second, it would take thirty years
to repay a billion dollars.

B.109:  [Whistling]. 

A.110:  Now, you know, that's, that's a long time and that's a lot of money. 

B.111:  Yes, it is. 

A.112:  And when we're talking about trillions,

B.113:  And when we're talking about adding that much to a budget where it's just
already in the hole just the, think about the amount of interest,

A.114:  # Huh.  #

B.115:  # we'll # be paying on that. 

A.116:  Have you,

B.117:  We'll probably more than double it. 

A.118:  The, uh, banking crisis is another, another case.  I was reading this week
about the F D I C saying that they couldn't take on another large bank failure
without going to gove-, to Congress,

B.119:  # Huh.  #

A.120:  # and # borrowing and I started thinking, now wait a minute.  They're in
exactly the same shape, uh, that they criticized the banks that they're dealing
with (( )).

B.121:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.122:  Exactly the same shape but,

B.123:  Yeah, the only difference is the, the, uh,

A.124:  # F D I C,#

B.125:  # taxpayers.  #

A.126:  can't go broke. 

B.127:  That's right. 

A.128:  Yeah.  Because you and I will pay for it. 

B.129:  Uh-huh.  Or our children and grandchildren. 

A.130:  Right.  Right.  Have we solved anything, Kathleen?

B.131:  I doubt it. 

A.132:  [Laughter]. 

B.133:  [Laughter]  But then I doubt if we ever will just keep writing to your
congressman and telling him ((that)).

A.134:  I, I moved here from Oklahoma.  I'm originally from Virginia and moved to
Oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and Oklahoma
just passed, uh, last year a law stating that, uh, or limiting the terms of
the state representatives.

B.135:  Yeah, we did that this year too. 

A.136:  Yeah. 

B.137:  California just passed that in the last election. 

A.138:  It will be interesting to see if we have any, any impetus to go on to the
national. 

B.139:  I hope it will. 

A.140:  Yeah, I think so too. 

B.141:  I'm,

A.142:  I, I get torn thinking about some of the good people, all the people I
think are good, and having to lose,

B.143:  # Well, the thing that, #

A.144:  # them, but on the # other hand, uh, maybe they'll pay more serious
attention to the process while they're there. 

B.145:  Yeah. 

A.146:  Instead of the reelection. 

B.147:  What's funny is that everybody says they want to throw out the rascals but
nobody,

A.148:  # Nobody ((does)). #

B.149:  # wants to # throw out his own rascal. 

A.150:  That's right.  Nobody does. 

B.151:  [Laughter] Otherwise we wouldn't have ninety-eight percent of the
incumbents reelected.

@@A.152:  Right, right.  Are you working?

B.153:  Yes, I'm an editor. 

A.154:  Editor? Good. 

B.155:  At a think tank. 

A.156:  Oh, I, I would, uh, love to get into another conversation with you about
that [laughter]. 

B.157:  [Laughter]  It's a fascinating job.  I get to see all kinds of interesting
ideas and, and I do my small bit to help in, uh, at least express themselves
coherently even if I don't always agree with what they're expressing. 

A.158:  Oh, I, I can imagine. 

B.159:  [Laughter]. 

A.160:  That, that whole process is fascinating to me.  I think I'd like to observe
if not participate sometime. 

B.161:  Well, we've got some really, really interesting people.  We got fifty
different fellows every year from all-around the world. 

A.162:  Uh-huh. 

B.163:  And, uh, so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people
and sometimes we really hate to see them go we'd like to keep them for years
and years and lots of times we're not so,
