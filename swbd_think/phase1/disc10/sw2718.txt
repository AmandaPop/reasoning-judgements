A.1:  All right, well how do you use credit cards, Carol?

B.2:  ((Scarily)), very, very, very seldom.  

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Only in dire emergencies.  In fact, I leave them home.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Is that from past exper-, bad experiences in the past or, or
just, uh, the fact that you don't want to be tempted.

B.6:  I have never, uh, I've used them but never to the extent of getting in
debt like, uh, some people do.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  It's just that since my money is tight right now, I don't even give myself
a tempting.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Because, I've gotten them all paid off.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  So, now I just wait --

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  -- before I use it.   But, uh, like I'll keep one minor one like Sears in
my purse, just for identification purposes.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Because I won't use it period.

A.17:  But like if you'd take a trip or something?

B.18:  I'll use ba-, uh, Visa.

A.19:  Yeah, yeah, #do you,#

B.20:  #But otherwise,# huh-uh.

A.21:  do you order a lot of things over the phone, or credit card orders?

B.22:  Never.

A.23:  Never.

B.24:  Never.

A.25:  Huh.  So, uh, like if you go to, uh, K-, Wal-Mart or something, you always
pay in cash or with a check?

B.26:  Uh-huh, ca-, check.

A.27:  Okay, okay.

B.28:  Very seldom would I even use cash.

A.29:  Um, so your money funnels directly into your checking account, huh.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Okay.  

B.32:  How about you?

A.33:  Me, I have a Discover card and I use that when, when gas prices are the
same whether you use cash or credit, I usually use my Discover card and I can
let my money sit in the bank for an extra, because they pay, uh, our credit
union pays, at the end of the month on your balance, so I will let it sit and
then draw interest from that and then I'll pay my credit cards off in full
every month so, you know, I have no finance charges, as long as I pay off
exactly on time, which I do.  And, also Discover card gives you a little bit
of money back.  It's not much, but, you know, five or six bucks.  Uh, instead
of writing a check for a large purchase, if I'm disciplined enough I can,
like, we-, uh, like buying a suit if I spend like three hundred bucks, you
know, I'll get some of that back through the cash back program and also at the
end of the month, you know, I'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks
that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had I written a
check.  And I do that sometimes, but like when we go to th-, like, uh, I'd say
it's about fifty, fifty, writing a check or using the Discover card.  It just,
I don't know, for some reason it just depe-, if it's something small I don't
want to write a, use my credit card.  But that's the only one I have and, and
sometimes we order things through the mail like books, and, uh, which is, I
just, if they have a toll free number I'll call it up and, you know, charge it
to my credit card.  As long as, you know, I make myself pay on time, every
time, so there's no finance charge and, it's really, you know, like you said,
some people go off half wild and spend, uh, they think because they've got a
thousand dollar limit then, you know, they've got to get that limit every
month or something and, uh, they end up paying finance charges and they just,
and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then they end up,
they may have got something on sale but all the interest, you know, they end
up paying more than what they would have, had they just paid cash for it.

B.34:  See that's exactly, I didn't get in debt, but what I did was one year, oh,
I can't remember when, five, six, must be eight, nine years ago, when I paid
my taxes, I realized that I had ran up so much on my credit card that I was
paying interest that was ridiculous.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  I mean sure, it was the tax write off but there was no sense to it.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  I mean there was no sense at all to it.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  I was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth, as far as
I could tell.  So at that point there, we just stepped right on, you know,
just saving all the way in.  And I'll turn around like on my car, I'll borrow
against my insurance, which I pay five percent interest and buy my car that
way.

A.41:  Huh.

B.42:  And that works. 

A.43:  Wow.

B.44:  So, I don't have to worry about it, but I use, uh, override at, uh, Texin
Credit Union, so that I don't have to keep too much, I keep enough balance in
my checking account so that I don't have to pay, you know, a service charge.

A.45:  Wha-, yo-, override?

B.46:  And then I, yeah.

A.47:  What's that mean?

B.48:  If I write a check real large, it'll go ahead and pull it out of my
savings account --

A.49:  Oh, okay.

B.50:  -- so I don't have to, you know, worry about it one way of the other and I
just keep that minimum balance in there.

A.51:  Okay, I see.

B.52:  So it just, you know, and I pretty much budget that way, all the way
around but as I said, my money's tight,

A.53:  Yeah, is that a #free service,#

B.54:  #right now.#

A.55:  that override?

B.56:  Yeah, 

A.57:  Huh.

B.58:  there's no charge for it.  

A.59:  Huh.

B.60:  So I do it that way, but I do, as I said I keep the credit card in my
purse for identification --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- when somebody wants identification one way of the other.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  But usually I won't put anything on that card unless it's something I
really, unbelievably need, otherwise, I'd better have it somewhere else.  

A.65:  Right.

B.66:  Because I'm like you, I'm not going to have a balance on that thing,
because it's too easy.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  I know too many people that pay off that car-, well I've got this credit
card, well maybe I'd better use that one, or something like that and I'm saying
huh-uh, not me.

A.69:  [Laughter] It's just, it's just so easy when, uh, like, uh, I think a lot
of it's psychological.  You hand a piece of plastic and all you do is sign
your name, at least either with cash or with a check [throat_clearing] you
have to write out the amount so you actually see how much you're spending.

B.70:  Well it's like, um, the little piece of plastic for, uh, to get your money
out or the credit union.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  All you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other.  And
like I'll run down there, like, you know, for vacation and things like that
and I'll leave it in there in savings account until last day.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  And then I'll put the card in and pull it out what I want.  But I'll pull
it out of savings because I don't keep any balance in the checking.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  But that's still, that's easy enough as it is, but I wouldn't use the
machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it.

A.77:  Oh, yeah, no kidding.

B.78:  I won't even go that far.

A.79:  I complain every time I, I mean, we've only had to do it twice since my
wife and I've been married in nine months, is use the machine that charges and
it charges a buck.  And one time, it was because the machine at T I was broken
and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and
the other one was just this weekend when we just, we were leaving out of town
and we had to, you know, just have some cash and so we used the automatic
teller card, but, you know, I'm very chintzy with my money, I don't like to
spend, lose a dollar just because I use a machine or something,

B.80:  #Um.#

A.81:  #it's,# it's senseless.

B.82:  But I'm like you if there's something, really that I wanted, I'll write to
them before I'll put the credit card call in though.  I won't put it on the
card unless I really, I'll take write them le-, uh, check for it.

A.83:  Yeah that's,

B.84:  Because it wastes too much time on the credit card and I'm kind of, I'm
leery about things going on my card because I've had, you know, had to go back
and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  So I'm n-, having real good luck with a credit card, I mean it came off,
there's no problem but it just takes too much, you know, scares me.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  And like Tom Thumb's got, uh, credit card now they used for groceries.  

A.89:  Really.

B.90:  Yeah, over here in, in Plano.

A.91:  Their own Tom Thumb card? [breathing] [laughter].

B.92:  Uh-huh, and you can charge your groceries on it.

A.93:  That's funny.

B.94:  And, uh, you can either charge your groceries on it, you have a choice,
or you can write a check and they (( )) it that way,

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:   so you don't have to keep going and get it, you know, credit check and
things like that and they'll give you an extra twenty-five dollars, no charge
or anything else like that.  But I won't even put that on groceries.  

A.97:  Huh.

B.98:  Because hey, what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or
something like that and I don't check it.

A.99:  Yeah, #yeah.#

B.100:  #No thank# you, I don't want anything going on my ca-, you know, in my
checking account unless it's, I know about it.  

A.101:  Right.

B.102:  But do you like Discover card?  I hadn't heard too much about it. 

A.103:  Yeah, it seems, a lot more places are taking it now, which when I first
got it, it was a problem with it.  I, I said I don't want to use the credit
card and I just carried it with me like you said, for identification and
sometimes when I would take it, go on a trip, you know, it, it was good to
have a credit card, because like, if my car would break down or something,

B.104:  #Uh-huh.#

A.105:  #(( )) a# lot of states don't, because I travel from Indiana to Texas and
a lot of states won't take out of state checks, like, you know, just some gas
station out of the way.  They want cash or a major card, so I went ahead and
got that and there's no fee, no service fee for it plus they play, pay you
cash back (( )) I think I earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which
isn't very much but I had just started to use it and like I, I had some major
purchases I just was dumb and forgot to put on there.  Like, uh, I wrote a
check for my wife's wedding ring, which was a lot of money and if I would have
put it on the Discover card, the money, you know, could have sat in the
savings account, or the checking account for an extra month and it also would
have paid me, probably, you know eight or nine bucks back on, uh, the end of
the year thing, so I messed that up.  So, I, you know, I'm still not in, it's
not a good habit to use it but fortunately I'm not, uh, like some people, not
a spendthrift and I really have to think about my purchases and I know if I
have money in the checking account to cover it, then I, I'll use the Discover
card, you know, to get a little more interest, but, uh, yeah, I, I'm just very
...
