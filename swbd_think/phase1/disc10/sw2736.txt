==========================================================================

B.1:  Well, what, what kind of car, did you just buy a car or are you in the
market to buy a car or,

A.2:  Actually, I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car.

B.3:  Oh. 

A.4:  I've got, uh, a couple older cars, they're both over ten years old --

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  -- and, uh, they've served me well, but I kind of would like to get a more,
uh, gas efficient car --

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  -- and a newer model, something looks a little nicer.  

B.9:  Yeah.  

A.10:  Uh, I've got three children at home.  Two fourteen year olds and a twelve
year old, and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit,

B.11:  [Laughter].  

A.12:  all five of us into.  

B.13:  Uh-huh.  

A.14:  And if you, if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get
them to sit together for any amount of time.

B.15:  Yeah, I, I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem [laughter].

A.16:  [Laughter].  

B.17:  No, no car was big enough for that [laughter].  

A.18:  Well, uh, I've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan.  

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  Uh, now I know that, that, uh, they've gotten quite pricey in the last
couple of years, but, uh, I like the Dodge products and, uh, been, uh, couple
times I've had a opportunity to rent one --

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  -- uh, I've been really pleased with its performance and with the size and
because if you get the seven passenger version [laughter] you can put some
space between the kids.

B.23:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.24:  And, uh, I think that would, that would serve us well.  Plus it's got, uh,
good storage capacity in it for, you know, taking things along,

B.25:  Uh-huh.

A.26:  going to the store,

B.27:  Which is the one that has modular type seats?  You know which one I'm
talking about?  They have the commercial on TV where you can, you can pull
some seats out,

A.28:  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  and you can move around.  

A.30:  Exactly correct.  Yeah, if you want,

B.31:  Is that, is that the Dodge Caravan,  

A.32:  Yes.  

B.33:  that does that or, 

A.34:  Yeah it, uh, the Dodge Caravans will do that.  Uh, you can take the, uh,
uh, usually there's a, uh, a double seat behind the, uh, front buckets.

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  And then if you get the, and then there's a three seat that goes or three
person seat that goes in the back.  Now what you can do is you could take that
middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back,

B.37:  Uh-huh.  

A.38:  and the two seats up front, or you can take the, uh, three seat out and
just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to
the back.  So it's very versatile.  You can move,

B.39:  Yeah.  

A.40:  the seats all around.  About the only thing you can't do is take that
three person across seat,

B.41:  Uh-huh.  

A.42:  and move it forward.  

B.43:  Well, the one that, I can't remember one it is, if it's the, it it's the
Toyota or, or one of the other ones.  I don't know if it's one of the
Americans or the import ones where, uh, they actually have like, uh, some
bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out.  I mean they're
really easy to pull out.

A.44:  Uh-huh.  

B.45:  Uh, and you can, uh, move them around and stuff and it, it, to me, that,
that would be real good for us.  Uh, my husband and I, uh, like to go camping
and stuff,

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  and right now we have a van which is, it's an older van and we're, we're
thinking about buying another sedan, uh, probably next year.  Uh, [lipsmack]
right now motorcycles takes precedence,

A.48:  Yeah.  

B.49:  since that, that's what my husband really wants right now.  But, uh, next
year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at, uh, possibly the Honda
Accord.  Uh, that's kind of, uh, as far, as far as the interior, it's got the
luxury interior, but d-, it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a
lot of the other cars have, which is one of the things that we were looking
at.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  You know, finding something that's, that's fairly affordable, but, yet has
all the nice luxury items that we want.

A.52:  Yeah, I think that's getting to be kind of important now that, uh, the
price is becoming the driving factor,

B.53:  Yeah.  

A.54:  and then you look at, once you realize how much money you've got to
spend, then you start looking around at, at what you can buy with it, where
before I think you, you looked at the car you wanted, and then you looked to
see how well you could afford it [laughter].

B.55:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

A.56:  Or how you could afford it.  

B.57:  Well, I think it's going to be a lot easier now.  I just heard that they
lowered the prime lending rate, so I think it's going to be a lot easier to,
to be able to get a car now --

A.58:  Yeah.  

B.59:  -- and finance it.  I think banks are going to be a lot more, a little bit
more lenient.

A.60:  Yeah, I know they're trying to do everything they can to, uh, end the
recession.

B.61:  Yeah.  

A.62:  And dropping the prime is probably one of the things.  I just bought a new
house so [lipsmack] I got a, a, uh, nine and a half percent interest rate.

B.63:  Uh-huh.  

A.64:  I'm not sure I could do much better today.  But, uh, that is also effecting
buying a new car [laughter].

B.65:  Yeah.  I can imagine.  You got to kind of work, work that into your budget.

A.66:  Well, that and that,

B.67:  Balance that and the house payment, and of course, uh, is if you buy a new
car you're going to, are any of your kids driving age yet?

A.68:  Uh, two fourteen year olds will be, uh, fifteen on the fourth of July so,

B.69:  Are s-, are they twins?  

A.70:  Yeah, they're twins born on the bicentennial.

B.71:  Oh, wow.  

A.72:  You're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial, is our motto.
July fourth seventy-six [laughter].

B.73:  [Laughter].  

A.74:  So, uh, uh, I've still got another full year and three months before
they're going to be behind the wheel,

B.75:  Uh-huh.  

A.76:  of a car.  So America's safe for another fifteen m-, and, uh, after that,
[lipsmack], now I may keep the, uh, one or both of the two cars I, I currently
have, for them to drive.  You know, they're, they're, they're small enough
that a first time driver could handle it, yet big enough that I feel s-, feel
safe that,

B.77:  Uh-huh.  

A.78:  if they were in an accident they would survive.  

B.79:  Uh-huh.  

A.80:  Know what I mean.  It, I don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of
car like you talked about, the Honda.  They're just,

B.81:  Well, the, the Honda's have been, have been very safe.  

A.82:  Uh-huh.  

B.83:  In, in accidents, uh, more so that a lot of the American cars.

A.84:  Is that right?  

B.85:  ((Matter of fact)) I just heard something today on, on the news about
those, uh,

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  automatic seat belts that are attached to the door --

A.88:  Right.  

B.89:  -- uh, they're questioning the safety of those now saying that, and they
showed, uh, a simulation where there w-, they had a dummy in the car and the
door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out
on top of him.

A.90:  Jeez.  

B.91:  So they're saying they're not as safe as, they give the appearance of being
safe, but they're really not as safe as they, as they, uh, appear to be.  So,
uh, I'm kind of concerned about that as far as, you know, w-, the seat belts.

A.92:  Well,

B.93:  Uh, I don't know if Maryland has a, uh, a seat belt law, but they do have
one in Texas.

A.94:  Yes.  

B.95:  And you're, 

A.96:  Definitely.  

B.97:  you're required to wear them.

A.98:  The thing is that they're, I think it's a two part seat belt, though,
there's the, uh, door belt and then there's one,

B.99:  Exactly.

A.100:  a lap belt.  

B.101:  But, ninety, uh, probably about, well, I don't know about ninety, but
probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the
lap portion of it.  I know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car.

A.102:  Make sure you smack him around then [laughter].

B.103:  [Laughter] So, I mean, it, it kind of gives you a false sense of security.
You think, oh, I've got one portion of my seat belt on, uh, but if your door
comes open, you know, it's not going to do you any good.

A.104:  Yeah.  

B.105:  So, that, that, that's a concern of mine as far as, uh, what I'll be
looking at with buying a new car.  Uh, I'm not really sure if I would want the
seat belts attached to the door.  I think I would feel better with them
attached to the actual car.  The inside where they're normally attached to,

A.106:  Yeah.  

B.107:  like behind the door.  

A.108:  Yeah.  The, uh, the supports.  Uh, [lipsmack] a good source of information
I've found has always been these, uh, used car manuals --

B.109:  Uh-huh.  

A.110:  -- because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a
list of all the problems that the car's had in the past.

B.111:  Um.  

A.112:  And you can look at the, uh, the track record on, 

B.113:  Yeah.  

A.114:  a car over the year, and, you usually notice, uh, a lot of problems at
the beginning and then things kind of iron out,

B.115:  Yeah.  

A.116:  to where, 

B.117:  Yeah.  

A.118:  there's fewer problems.  And you get an idea on how well the, the next
car's going to be.  Now as long as they aren't changing the model, you know,
like when the, uh, Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small
car they had a lot of problems,

B.119:  Yeah.  

A.120:  with the smaller car.   As long as they aren't,

B.121:  Yeah, the, the Le Mans is like that, too.  Uh, we used to have a Le Mans
when I was in, in high school, uh, and it was a big car.  I mean it was like
the, uh, the Grand Prix,

A.122:  Uh-huh.  

B.123:  and in, I think around nineteen eighty, uh, they changed the model and
it, like, went to half the size.

A.124:  Yeah, sure.

B.125:  Literally, I mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car
anymore.  Didn't even remotely resemble the old car.

A.126:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I remember when that happened.  So unless they're really
changing the model, uh, yeah, chances are that it's probably going to have
the, the fewer mistakes than it had the year before.

B.127:  Yeah.  Well, everybody that I've talked to who's ever had a Honda --

A.128:  Uh-huh.  

B.129:  -- loves them.  And my husband had a Honda, uh, and it was a lease car and
he had to turn back in, uh, a year and a half ago.  Uh, and he had it for four
years and never had a single problem with it.  And it was great.  Uh, and the
only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel, the, at
the time the residual was like sixty-five hundred dollars and it was a four
year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a
little bit too much to pay for --

A.130:  Yeah.  

B.131:  -- uh, a four year old car [breathing].  

A.132:  Yeah, I agree.  

B.133:  So, so we ended up, just went, just went ahead and just turned the keys
back in and, and got out of the lease.  Uh, {pause} one thing that I, that I
am curious about is, uh, reading information on air bags, do, some of the vans
I think, I don't know about the Dodge Caravan, but some of the vans now have
driver side air bags.

A.134:  Uh-huh.  

B.135:  Which I think is a good idea.  

A.136:  Yeah.
