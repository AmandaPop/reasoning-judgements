==========================================================================

A.1:  I, uh,

B.2:  # Yeah.  #

A.3:  # I # have not, like I was saying, I haven'-, I have not had to make the
decision for, uh, regarding, uh, care for anyone of my family members.
However, I've had quite a few friends that have had to make that decision.

B.4:  Well, see, I don't have a relative that's made it over sixty-one. 

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  Huh-uh.  But my children's, on their father's side, have them up into the
nineties.  But,

A.7:  # Man, #

B.8:  # uh, #

A.9:  yeah. 

B.10:  the only time we came close and we started looking into it was when my
grandmother became senile.  She start senile at fifty. 

A.11:  Huh. 

B.12:  And at that time, the homes that we were looking for, when I was a kid, uh,
my mother, I can remember them arguing.  They couldn't find one that, it was
either clean enough or they took enough care or there was one thing or another
that continuously arguing about it. 

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  And they ended up keeping her from relative to relative.  And of course she
died when she was fifty-nine.  So it wasn't that long. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  But,

A.17:  # It's, #

B.18:  # the # few I've been in, they have varied tremendous. 

A.19:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

B.20:  So, uh,

A.21:  I think there's, there's so many that are, uh, that are, you know,
retirement homes that are geared toward the ambulatory pa-, you know, the
ambulatory person that is still extremely active and just wishes not to have
to live alone, you know, separate any longer.  And then there are the, uh, the
nursing homes which actually provide, you know, nursing care.  I guess it
goes, there's a wide range.

B.22:  Oh, well, we were talking about it the other day because a girl at work has
got that problem right now. 

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  And, uh, she keeps saying she's never going to put her mother in one.  And
I says, hey, look, go around, look at them.  They're totally different than
your con-, concept of what it was years ago.

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  And I says, I don't know what condition your mother's in, which I didn't --

A.27:  Uh-huh. 

B.28:  -- but you do have the choice now.  And I says, What is your mother going
to do all day long while you're out here at work?

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  I says, think about what she would like to have.  Because a lot of them,
hey, they might be bedridden, but at least they've got company and people their
own age to talk to. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. 

B.32:  To keep them home, what do you've got?

A.33:  That's right. 

B.34:  They're sitting there like they're, they vegetate,

A.35:  # That's true.  #

B.36:  # is what # happens. 

A.37:  That's, that's what I would be afraid of.  I would rather, personally, I
would rather be in a community of other people with a greater chance of having
similar interest with them.  Rather than being, stuck in a home where, I mean,
if you, if you couldn't drive, I guess, I mean, if you're no longer have the,
the freedom of driving,

B.38:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.39:  # then # it, it changes it so drastically because you can't go someplace to
do something when you want to.  You ha-, you are totally dependent on someone
else to provide all your entertainment for you.  And that would, I don't think
I would like that.  I think I would rather, if I were in that situation, I
think I would rather live in a, in a nursing home situation.

B.40:  See, you're not aware of the, the horror stories and things like that, that
I've grown up with. 

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  And I mean I'm talking about horror stories.  And they're still out there. 
I mean it's, it's not something that's e-, been eliminated. 

A.43:  No. 

B.44:  There are lots of homes out there that just literally people drop them off,
forget about them.  And they change hands.  I mean, I'm not saying they don't
investigate.  They investigate.  It's great when they're there.  But unless
they keep current with it --

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  -- and they changes hands, it goes either direction. 

A.47:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.48:  Because they're relying on a lot of people that, hey, they're like any
other business.  If you lose a lot of your customers, they get into a
financial bind.

A.49:  That's true. 

B.50:  And people say, well, you know, they're a nursing home.  But I say, hey, it
doesn't work that way, they're a business. 

A.51:  That's true and, and the, the nurses that they hire are frequently not, uh,
you know, as qualified in their field.  And, uh,

B.52:  Well, like my neighbor, she runs down here to this nursing home down here. 

A.53:  Uh-huh. 

B.54:  And she just point blank's tired of the pressure and responsibility of
working as a nurse in a hospital. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  She admits it.  She's tired of it.  So she works down here.  She's a nurse,
she's qualified --

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  -- but she's fifty, oh, she's in her fif-, early fifties somewhere.  And
working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there.  She gets good
money for it, and she enjoys the old people,

A.59:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.60:  # you # know.  It's, it's just that simple for her. 

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  But, uh, and she says it's hard.  They get cranky, they get obstinate.  But
she feels the same way I do.  I would rather, depending on the situation, I
would rather be able to put myself or anybody else in a nursing home, if I was
able to get close enough to them. 

A.63:  Right. 

B.64:  So they don't feel lost. 

A.65:  Right.  I think,

B.66:  Now see, my grandmother, she wouldn't go in a nursing home.  Besides being
scared and everybody else didn't want her, she was terrified of one.  Literally
and positively terrified. 

A.67:  Yeah. 

B.68:  Because she remembers the old stuff. 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  My great grandmother was.  And she was, she was terrified that
some day someone might try to put her in a nursing home.

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  She even wrote a song about it she used to sing.  But, I mean, she, she
died when she was ninety-six,

B.72:  # Oh.  #

A.73:  # and, # uh, from a fall [laughter].  She didn't die of natural causes, she
died from a fall.  She, uh, you know, had she been younger it would not, she
would not have died from the fall.  But she, uh, you know, and she was still,
[sigh] she was still household independent.  She was independent in the
household, you know, in the home.  You know, she couldn't drive.  But, heck,
but she never learned to drive to begin with.  So, you know, it wasn't, uh,
her age that had prevented her.  But she was, she was very afraid that someone
would try to put her in a nursing home.  And she lived with her daughter, my
grandmother, until she died.  And, uh, my grandmother still at seventy, uh,
she's seventy-nine this year, uh, is living independently.  And she drives
[laughter].

B.74:  Oh, she drives. 

A.75:  Just to church and back, [laughter] and to, and to the store.  You know,
all there right in just a block or two.  But she's still real independent.
So, I think that for so many people that, uh, the nursing home represent
obviously different, uh, different things.  And depending on the level of
function, whereas my, you know, my grandmother doesn't n-, need any extra, uh,
camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from
her friends that come by.  But, uh, I've seen a lot of people that don't live
near their family or don't have, you know, significant roots in this, in their
little community.  They've been uprooted for some reason or another, and they,
I, I think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that would
offer them, uh, oh, activities to maintain an active mind.  Because like you
say, if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long, I
mean they, they become, they vegetate [laughter].

B.76:  Oh, yeah. 

A.77:  And that's,

B.78:  They've got nothing.  Or they get on the telephone all day long. 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  But, I mean this is one area where I'd like to see Social Security or the
government step in and take people over a certain age or with handicaps or
something.  And take their Social Security away from them, I mean give them,
you know, money at a certain point.  And putting them in homes to where they
can get something fed back to them.  In other words, people talk to and become
still human beings.

A.81:  Uh-huh. 

B.82:  Because you see people down in south Dallas and every where else, sitting
in a house.  They don't know anybody.  They're scared to death of robbers.
They're scared to death of everything.

A.83:  Uh-huh {faintly}.

B.84:  They hardly have enough food to even eat on. 

A.85:  And that's not living. 

B.86:  I mean, you're not living. 

A.87:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly. 

B.88:  Yeah.  I mean, hey, I'm putting all this money out to the government, why
can't they put it out there rather than in the federal prisons? ((Um)),

A.89:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Hey. 

B.90:  But, you know, you see pictures on T V, I mean, I wish I had enough money
to go down there and do something but, you know, I don't know.  They, if
they can have day care, why can't they put elderly people, care, and put them
in a home to where it's regulated?

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  I mean it's, it's a shame that we have this to where it's, we don't think
of our older people.  We really don't.

A.93:  Oh, no.  I mean, look at the, uh, Orientals [laughter].  They protect,
respect, uh, they conserve their elderly for, for what they are.  They're a
true natural resource, and they cherish them.  And, uh, yet, I mean we as
Americans are such a throw away society that we've basically done that with
generations of people that have, so called, outlived their usefulness.  You
know, I, I think that's, uh, an atrocity.  And I'm fortunate enough that I've
had, uh, my relatives have lived very long, full lives.  And, uh, or most of
them have.  And as a result, I have, uh, {fading} I've been, you know,
