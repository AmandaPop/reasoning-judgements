============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Kate, uh, do you play golf?

B.2:  Um, I have played golf in the past.  I'm not very good at it even though
I'm pretty well sports minded.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  Um, there's something about holding that club in my hand that I want to
hold it like a baseball bat [laughter].

A.5:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.6:  So, I can putt, but I have a terrible time driving. 

A.7:  Right, that's very similar to me. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  I just, uh, haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  I just go out and try to be Joe Athlete,

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.13:  # and # think that I can just, you know, use transfer skills from like you
said, softball or baseball,

B.14:  # Sure.  #

A.15:  # and # I've got that baseball swing and I hook everything viciously,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # so # I have to aim like forty-five degrees off to the,

B.18:  # [Laughter].  #

A.19:  # to # the right and hopefully it curves back in. 

B.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.21:  # And # usually I end up, uh, going from one side of the fairway to the
other and not straight down the middle. 

B.22:  Yeah, yeah, like you're supposed to. 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  Well I even, uh, took a golf lesson, six weeks I guess worth of golf
lessons. 

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  And, and, I had a terrible time trying to remember where your hands are
supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this
way and it was extremely difficult, considering how easy it looks when the
pros do it.

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  And so, uh, I played for a while, that way, but I can go play Putt Putt
Golf really well.

A.29:  Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.30:  That's the kind of, that's the kind of stuff I can go for. 

A.31:  Do you watch golf on T V a lot?

B.32:  Um, I watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan. 

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.34:  # He, # he watches every game, he goes out every single day.  His whole
stance, the way he walks is a golfer's walk [laughter].  If there is such a
thing. 

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  And so he, uh, he's gotten me interested in it.  So I have my own putters
and, and, you know, some, some equipment.  But, um, the only thing that I would
probably watch is like things that are local like the Byron Nelson Classic
that's coming up. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  Um, and then there's another one out, let me see, off of One twenty-one
coming up pretty soon.  So I like to watch things that are close, uh, by to see
if there's any names that are familiar with Texas. 

A.39:  Oh yeah, yeah.  I, we don't have a T V so we don't watch much golf. 

B.40:  Uh-huh.  No, I can't imagine watching much golf without a T V. 

A.41:  Yeah.  So we don't go out to the local, uh, uh, golf course and watch
amateurs very often so, uh, uh. 

B.42:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.43:  # But, you # know, when I was younger, when I was into it, I'd watch it
every now and then if, if baseball or basketball or something else wasn't on,

B.44:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.45:  # an # golf was always the, uh, the, if nothing else is on I'll watch golf.

B.46:  Yeah. 

A.47:  Because I don't know, it's, it's pretty, it's neat watching, I really enjoy
watching the highlights like on E S P N Sports Center,

B.48:  # Yes, yes.  #

A.49:  # when they # show the great shots and everything. 

B.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.51:  # I # mean that's fun, but I don't, I'm not up for watching the whole game
like I do for baseball or basketball. 

B.52:  Right, right.  Yeah, well at least with, now with the, with the sports, uh,
and, and the T V is, um, they can get the camera's just at the time the people
are starting to swing,

A.53:  # Yeah.  #

B.54:  # so # it makes it a little bit faster and, um, a little bit more
interesting.  But I think it's, it's more interesting to go out and watch
them, uh, than it is on the T V.  And, and to follow like one or two people
along that golf course and then you, you almost feel like you're in, doing
exactly what they're doing.

A.55:  # Huh.  #

B.56:  # Uh, # it, it's so much more interesting, I thought than, um, uh, sitting
and watching it on T V.  I think it's kind of boring, yeah. 

A.57:  Yeah, so you've been in the gallery before?

B.58:  Uh-huh, uh, on the Byron Nelson Classics, um, was it, no it wasn't last
year, it was the year before. 

A.59:  So, who'd you follow?

B.60:  [Breathing] Uh, gosh, I can't en-, remember, you know, all those names kind
of go together [laughter],

A.61:  # Yeah.  #

B.62:  # after # a while. 

A.63:  Was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros
or something?

B.64:  Um, [ringing] {phone in background} {faintly} let me see because I followed
several and I'm trying to think who it is that I was, um, going along with.  I
don't remember now.  I mean, gee whiz, I, all I remember was we had tornadoes
about the same time and that was the big highlight.

A.65:  # [Breathing].  #

B.66:  # They # were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the,
the, the golf course. 

A.67:  # Yeah.  #

B.68:  # [Laughter] # And that's what I remember the most about that.  Uh, but I
do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there, uh, watching,
than it was to watch it on T V.

A.69:  Yeah, well, yeah, you're outdoors and, you know, it's kind of neat. 

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.71:  # That's # the only thing, that's what draws me to golf is just, you know,
being outside on a large wide open space, pretty much. 

B.72:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.73:  # And, uh, # well down here it's so expensive.  I'm from Indiana,

B.74:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.75:  # and # up there, I, I went to Purdue and you have Purdue golf course, and
if you're a student, I mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks. 

B.76:  # Oh, wow.  #

A.77:  # On a # really, you know, it's a big ten championship course. 

B.78:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.79:  # So # it's really well kept and everything else, but, you know, down here,
it's, it's incredible, I've, I've never golfed down here because it's, you
know, nine holes for ten bucks or something and,

B.80:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.81:  # and # by the time I, I, drill a, you know a half dozen balls into a pond
or something, you know, that's that's an extra five bucks right there and so,
you know,

B.82:  # [Laughter]  Yeah.  #

A.83:  # it gets # kind of expensive for the young college graduate. 

B.84:  Sure, sure.  Well I know, uh, uh, i-, since it's warmer weather down here
and you can play almost year round,

A.85:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.86:  # then, # yeah, that's the reason is there's so many people who want to get
out and go play golf.  See my parents live in Ohio and my dad, what he'll do
is, uh, he will come down here or go someplace else in the South to where it's
warm so he can continue playing golf.  I mean this is what an avid golf person
does.

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  It is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf
junk,

A.89:  # [Laughter].  #

B.90:  # you # know, the golf hat, the golf, you know clock, everything. 

A.91:  # [Laughter]  Golf clock.  #

B.92:  # Because he's, he's # just, he is, he is a freak when it comes to golfing.

A.93:  Has a subscription to GOLF MAGAZINE or something?

B.94:  Yeah, he, uh,

A.95:  # That's funny.  #

B.96:  # he's, he's # really something. 

A.97:  So, uh, has he always been like that, or just in the later years?

B.98:  [Breathing]  No, see, he, um, it's only been in about the past five years. 
And he's so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior
tournaments. 

A.99:  Yeah. 

B.100:  And he says oh, I can't get in there with Arnold Palmer and all those other
good people.  But I'm saying, well yes, you could, you know, and then that's
where you usually can make a little money and, and profit this way. 

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  Because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single
year. 

A.103:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.104:  # So, # uh, but no, he hasn't gone to do that yet, but we wish he would. 
You know, make a little megabucks and pass it along, you know, to the family
[laughter]. 

A.105:  [Laughter]  Well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with
the boys. 

B.106:  That's right, I know, get to meet all these stars, because I remember
sitting on his lap when I was a little girl watching golf.  He has loved golf
really all of his life. 

A.107:  Yeah. 

B.108:  And, but I remember watching it, golf with him, so, yeah, this is something
that, uh, he can go and see all these people he's uh, got to watch on T V for
years and years and years and years, so. 

A.109:  Well, tha-, that's neat. 

B.110:  [Sigh]  Yeah, I think so too. 

A.111:  So, uh, you don't see you, uh, taking up, you know, and charging,

B.112:  # [Laughter].  #

A.113:  # being # the avid golfer in the near future, huh?

B.114:  No, I think some of my brothers are going to do that, I'm a volleyball
person myself. 

A.115:  # Oh, volleyball.  #

B.116:  # Yeah, yeah, # I love volleyball, so I'm on a T I league,

A.117:  # Yeah.  #

B.118:  # and, # uh, play with a group of people from here at work, but I don't
even think T I has, well they may have a golfing, I don't know, they may have
a golfing club, you know, it's possible.

A.119:  I've never really, well, Sherman's a smaller plant, but I've never really
seen a golf club but,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # [Laughter]  # okay, I've seen a golf club, that's funny. 

B.122:  # [Laughter].  #

A.123:  # But, # uh, #golfing club.# 

B.124:  #Golfing club,# yeah, there you go [/laughter] [breathing].  I bet you they
do but I just, you know, I hear about things like the te-, the tennis, um,
teams and,

A.125:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.126:  # and, # uh, volleyball and baseball.  But I haven't heard of golf, but I'm
sure they probably do. 

A.127:  Yeah.  We-, I don't know, there just not that many places to play around
here, from what I hear. 

B.128:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.129:  # There's # a private club, maybe one and there's, uh, gu-. there's, uh,
the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force
base.

B.130:  Oh. 

A.131:  So, they've got the old Air Force base golf course and it's like playing on
dirt, there's no grass. 

B.132:  # Oh, no, uh-huh.  #

A.133:  # So, uh, you # know, it's not too many golfers like there are in Dallas,
probably,

B.134:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.135:  # with # more courses and more people and probably higher money, even
better kept.

B.136:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.137:  # But, # I don't know, I'm, I'm just kind of glad, my wife's kind of in to
it.  She's, she'll play about once or twice a year but that's about it. 

B.138:  Yeah, yeah, yeah me too.  It's not, uh, not something like, uh, that
obsession I think my father has [laughter]. 

A.139:  [Sigh]  Well if it's genetic, you'd better be careful. 

B.140:  I know that's true [laughter].  Well it was nice talking with you. 

A.141:  Likewise, and, uh,

B.142:  # Okay.  #

A.143:  # maybe # we'll get hooked up again sometime. 

B.144:  Okay. 

A.145:  All right take care. 

B.146:  Take care, bye-bye. 

A.147:  Bye.
