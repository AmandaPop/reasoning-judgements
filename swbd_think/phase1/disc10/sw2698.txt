REMARKS:        Background noise (computer printer??) and distortion of 
sound at the beginning of the recording on Speaker B side.  Speaker B 
stuttered, which made it difficult at times to understand and transcribe 
into print the words and sounds he used.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Hello. 

B.2:  Hello {sound distorted}.

A.3:  Hello. 

B.4:  Hi.  Hi {sound is distorted}. Uh, can you hear me? [printer]  {Sounds like
the noise from a computer in the background}

A.5:  Yeah. 

B.6:  Hi.  My name's ((Wanette)) Miller.  I'm in Berkeley, California.  Who am I
talking,

A.7:  Berkeley, California?

B.8:  Yeah?

A.9:  This is Carla in Sherman, Texas. 

B.10:  Well, hello, Carla.  How are you?

A.11:  Good.  How are you doing?

B.12:  I'm doing fine.  So, you want to talk football, uh?

A.13:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  That's what they gave us. 

B.14:  Well, I guess you better push one. 

@A.15:  Yeah.  Okay.  {beep on line} Okay. 

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  Um [noise], 

B.18:  S-, s-, so tell me,

A.19:  # Yeah? #

B.20:  # do # you like football?

A.21:  Yeah, I love football.  Football, #professional,#

B.22:  #How could#  you be from Texas and not like football, right?

A.23:  Right.  Well, I'm not really fr-, originally from Texas, but, uh,
professional football is my favorite thing to watch really.

B.24:  Yeah? So, well then, in, in that case, you're probably a devout
Forty-niners fan.

A.25:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Exactly.  I do like,

B.26:  # [Laughter].  #

A.27:  # uh, # what's his name?

B.28:  [Laughter]  Like what's his name?

A.29:  What's, who's the quarterback out there?

B.30:  Joe Montana. 

A.31:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I do #like him [noise].# 

B.32:  #Yeah, yeah.#  Well, I don't know if you know this, but do you know that,
that both Roger Craig and, uh, oh, what is that linebacker's name.  Oh! Ronnie
Lotte. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. 

B.34:  They're not coming back. 

A.35:  Oh, really?

B.36:  Yeah, they've signed with another team. 

A.37:  So, they're not going to be as good this year, huh?

B.38:  Well, I don't know.  Those are two heavy duty players. 

A.39:  Oh, yeah. 

B.40:  You know, Roger Craig and Ronnie Lotte.  I can't imagine,

A.41:  # Yeah.  #

B.42:  # you # know? So, uh [laughter], 

A.43:  # [Laughter]  [breathing].  #

B.44:  # it's just # amazing.  You know, y-, I, I, I, I hope that living there in,
uh, in, in Texas, you, you, of course, don't let anyone know that you like,

A.45:  [Noise]. 

B.46:  the Forty-niners, do you? [/printer]. 

A.47:  [Laughter] Not at all, not at all.  I'm, I'm really a, a, a bandwagon fan.
I think I like,

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  whoever is good that year. 

B.50:  Oh, yeah?

A.51:  Yeah.  #I've, you know,#

B.52:  #Well, that's all right#  too. 

A.53:  Yeah.  So I, so I liked the Forty-niners last year [laughter].  But, uh, I
like watching the Colts play because I'm from, originally from Indiana and,

B.54:  Oh, (( )). Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute [noise]  {Sounds
like paper tearing}.

A.55:  Yeah?

B.56:  If, [laughter],  the, the Co-, the Colts, I still have trouble adjusting to
that, #the Indiana,#

A.57:  The # Colts?#

B.58:  # Colts.  #

A.59:  Yeah?

B.60:  Yes.  I guess, I guess that sort of dates me.  But, uh,

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  Uh, I still think of the Colts as Baltimore. 

A.63:  Yeah.  I know.  A lot of people do. 

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  But, uh, we like Jeff George, [noise]  so it's fun to watch him play. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  Being a rookie and all last year. 

B.68:  Oh, yeah. 

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  Yeah, for sure. 

A.71:  Uh-huh. 

B.72:  But I imagine, speaking of football teams, you guys have the, what happened
to Dallas? What, whatever happened to Dallas?

A.73:  [Laughter]  Well, they did the wrong thing by, uh, releasing Landry a few
years ago. 

B.74:  I, yeah I thought they were going to,

A.75:  [Noise]. 

B.76:  lynch those people. 

A.77:  I know. 

B.78:  Really. 

A.79:  I, I liked [noise]  Tom Landry, you know.  I have no respect for the, for
the new [/noise] coaching staff since they ousted him. 

B.80:  Well, you know, how do you get rid of an institution like that and, and,
and, and justify it? I mean,

A.81:  [Noise]  Oh, not, I know.  Not at all. 

B.82:  That really was kind of sad.  ((I)) got sort of a raw deal on it.  Really,

A.83:  Yeah.  So, uh,

B.84:  You said something, you know, uh, in college teams, you guys have some,
some,

A.85:  [Noise]. 

B.86:  have you got any, {stuttering} anything promising this year as far as
college teams, like, like, uh, Texas A and M?

A.87:  [Breathing]  [laughter]  Well,

B.88:  You ((keech)) up, keep up with collegiate?

A.89:  Well, I have to admit I don't keep up with Texas.  I keep up with, uh, I'm
from Purdue. 

B.90:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely. 

A.91:  And so I keep up with what's going on up there.  They're going to have a
new coach this year from Ohio State.

B.92:  Uh-huh. 

A.93:  And, uh, they, it looks, looks to be promising for Purdue within the next
few years.  So,

B.94:  # Uh.  #

A.95:  # we're # looking forward to seeing their program turn around. 

B.96:  Yeah, well Purdue's been kind of out of it for a long time. 

A.97:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

B.98:  I, I, I didn't know Purdue, I didn't even know Purdue still had a football
team. 

A.99:  Oh, yeah!

B.100:  [Laughter]. 

A.101:  You don't hear about them much.  In fact, you don't even hear about their
basketball team much any more, but, you know, [noise]  that's how it i-, that's
how it goes, I guess. 

B.102:  Yeah.  Well, it will be interesting to see.  Especially, you know, uh, uh,

A.103:  [Noise]. 

B.104:  here, here in the, in the bay area, you know, this used to be the home also
of the, of the, of, of the Raiders and,

A.105:  # Yeah [breathing].  #

B.106:  # A lot # of people here still feel that the Raiders are, are, are, are,
you know, are in Oakland, but, uh, i-, i-, i-, i-, it's going to be real
interesting to see what happens because, uh, th-, th-, there, a lot of changes
are happening here in the bay area as far as out there.  Talking about maybe
getting a new stadium, and,

A.107:  [Noise]. 

B.108:  with those guys leaving, I mean,

A.109:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.110:  # ((Feagin)) # and, and Ronnie Lotte, I, I, I can't imagine a more
devastating blow to a team.  You know, the, i-, uh, th-, the top running back
and the top defensive player, uh, leaving is,

A.111:  Right. 

B.112:  Gee.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens. 

A.113:  What are they going to do about Bo this year?

B.114:  Uh, Bo, well I don't know what they're going to do about Bo. 

A.115:  [Laughter]  [noise]. 

B.116:  Bo is, is, is pretty much out of it. 

A.117:  Yeah? [noise]. 

B.118:  Yeah.  I think Bo is, you're talking about, speaking about Bo Jackson?

A.119:  Right. 

B.120:  Well, uh, i-, i-, it just doesn't sound like that, with what's wrong with
him, that, you know, we're going to find out what Bo's made out of. 

A.121:  Oh, yeah.  Some people think, they're predicting that he'll make a big
comeback [noise]. 

B.122:  Well, uh, I'm sure he wants to, but I would be, I'd frankly, extremely
surprised. 

A.123:  Yeah, I would be too. 

B.124:  I really would.  That kind of,

A.125:  [Breathing]. 

B.126:  you know, that kind of injury is not, not something that, well, I, I hope
he does, you know?

A.127:  # Yeah.  #

B.128:  # More # power to him.  I think that'd just absolutely wonderful.  So do
you, I, I guess, uh, uh, I, I've talked with a lot of folks from, from Texas,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.130:  # a # lot of folks from Texas, uh, on this thing.  And so it's, it's, it's,
[laughter]  I guess all you folks just kind of got into this thing, huh?

A.131:  [Breathing]  Right.  T I, uh, somehow got us on it. 

B.132:  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  I mean, it's kind of fun.  I've met some,

A.133:  # Yeah.  #

B.134:  # great # folks, I really have. 

A.135:  Yeah. 

B.136:  And had some great conversations. 

A.137:  I bet they love to talk about, uh, pro football, don't they [noise]? 

B.138:  Oh, yeah, indeed.  Definitely. 

A.139:  [Laughter]  Or any football [breathing]. 

B.140:  Yeah.  Well, I, I, I, I must admit, I, as growing up, football was really a
great part of my life.  I grew up in North Carolina and,

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  South, and, uh, played, uh, football was just, you know,

A.143:  You played football?

B.144:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I played foo-,

A.145:  For North Carolina?

B.146:  Played, played in college a little bit, but certainly didn't go in the, go
into pro.  Never, never,

@@A.147:  Wh-, where'd you go to college?

B.148:  I, I went to Arizona State. 

A.149:  Oh, did you?

B.150:  Yeah. 

A.151:  Well, great.  What year was that then? [breathing]. 

B.152:  Well, it was, n-, n-, uh, long ago.  #It was, it,#

A.153:  #Long ago, huh?#  [noise]. 

B.154:  Yes, I got out of there, undergraduate in seventy-three. 

A.155:  Uh-huh. 

B.156:  Should have left in seventy-two but,

A.157:  [Laughter]. 

B.158:  I was having too much fun. 

A.159:  Oh, yeah. 

B.160:  Those were, those were Vietnam War,

A.161:  [Noise]  {Sounds like she is slicing}.

B.162:  years, and you just didn't want to get out too early. 

A.163:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely. 

B.164:  [Laughter]. 

A.165:  I understand that. 

B.166:  You hung in there as long as you could. 

A.167:  [Laughter]. 

B.168:  [Laughter]  Anyway, well, listen, Carla, it's been a pleasure talking. 

A.169:  Yeah, you too.  And I hope the Forty-niners do well this year. 

B.170:  Thank you.  And I hope Purdue does too. 

A.171:  [Laughter]  Thanks. 

B.172:  You hang in there. 

A.173:  Okay.

A.175:  You kay, okay.  Bye-bye.
