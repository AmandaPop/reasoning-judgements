@A.1:  Okay.  So what is your latest home repair?

B.2:  Well, uh, we have done some minor repairs.  We're getting the house ready
to sell.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  And, but I mean I, really minor kinds of things, you know, like painting
the, painting the, the smudge marks and --

A.5:  Right. 

B.6:  -- uh, uh, [lipsmack].  Gosh we haven't done anything, uh, real major.  Uh,
did some gardening, did some landscaping.  I don't know that that counts as
home repair.

A.7:  Oh, yeah. 

B.8:  Uh,

A.9:  Any kind of upgrade. 

B.10:  I would guess so.  I think the last thing we really did was, was, uh, we
had some gutters put up, uh, and, uh, that made a big difference in terms of,
I mean the water was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn.  I, we
moved here f-, uh, from New England about, uh, [lipsmack] three years ago --

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  -- and, uh, we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of rains that, uh, you
can get down here. 

A.13:  Oh, yeah [breathing]. 

B.14:  And, uh, but the gutter, the, the, uh, gutters made a big difference
[lipsmack].  How about you?

A.15:  And your house didn't have it on there before?

B.16:  No, it well, we bought the house new and, uh, it was kind of the, you know,
you get what you pay for [laughter]. 

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  And, uh, we didn't invest in the gutters at the time. 

A.19:  Huh.  I figures that was something they put on all houses, I don't know. 

B.20:  No, no. 

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  Definitely not.  In fact, we still don't have them in the backyard. 

A.23:  Oh, really?

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  You kind of have to dig a trench, right?

B.26:  Right [laughter]. 

A.27:  Yeah, I remember [breathing]  I've, I've, I just got married so I've only
lived in an apartment and a duplex,

B.28:  # Oh, yeah.  #

A.29:  # so I've, # you know, have not owned a home yet --

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  -- but I remember my parents built their home and they had to, they had a
lot of, lot of work.  In fact it was fifteen years ago and they're still, uh,
[breathing],  trying to finish the basement and,

B.32:  # Yeah.  #

A.33:  # up, # you know. 

B.34:  I don't think you,

A.35:  It's a never ending process. 

B.36:  Yeah, that's it.  I don't think you ever, you're ever completely done.  Uh,
I know we had, there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here. 
Uh, we could use a shed out in the back. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. 

B.38:  And, uh, need to build, could u-, the kids could use some shelves in their
rooms.  Uh, but I don't think, you know, being a new home we wouldn't do any
kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen, or anything like that. 

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  Uh, maybe in the new, maybe in the new house [laughter]. 

A.41:  Right. 

B.42:  The next house.  Uh,

A.43:  Where are you moving to?

B.44:  Well, we're we're going to stay in the area, uh, and, uh, uh, we just, it,
it turns out that this house was much bigger and more expensive than, than we
wanted to, to invest in. 

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  And, uh, so we decided that, uh, instead of throwing all our mon-, money
into the house we'd, uh, we'd try to invest it a little better and, uh, that
way, uh, uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's just doesn't make sense to be house
poor in these economic times. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  You know what I mean?

A.49:  And it's a buyer's market now, right?

B.50:  It seems to be, yeah.  It seems to be.  Uh, the interest rates just went
down.  I don't know, I would imagine that's going to encourage more people to,
uh, to look, to buy a house. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. 

B.52:  Uh, so, uh, we'll see. 

A.53:  Have you ever bought an old house or rented an old house and then fixed it
up?

B.54:  I never had.  Uh, my wife, uh, parents did that.  They, uh, my wife's from
New Hampshire. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  And they bought this big old farm house, which, you know, didn't even have
indoor plumbing kind of thing, and, uh, they converted the barn,

A.57:  # Um.  #

B.58:  # into # a garage and built a couple of rooms above the barn, and, uh, they
did a lot of remodeling in that house.  And, of course, had plumbing put in
[laughter]. 

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  And in fact our, our first a-, well, our second apartment was, what they
did was they took a corner of the house and converted it into an apartment and
my wife's grandfather is just really handy with, uh, tools, and, and, and as a
handyman kind of thing.  In fact, he built his own house from scratch --

A.61:  Oh, cool. 

B.62:  -- and, and the funny thing about it is you, you know, you ask him, well,
where did you learn to do that, and he says well I read it in a book. 

A.63:  Oh, wow [throat_clearing]. 

B.64:  [Laughter] And so, course, course at the time that he lived that's when all
the neighbors used to pitch in and help,

A.65:  # Yeah.  #

B.66:  # with # that kind of thing and so,

A.67:  Wish it was that way now, don't you?

B.68:  I do, too.  Boy. 

A.69:  Everybody could build each other's house for dirt. 

B.70:  Right, yeah.  That would be, uh, and, and he had, it was a really nice
house.  He did a really nice job, but he, he built an apartment for us. 

A.71:  Huh. 

B.72:  Built the whole kitchen and the whole thing.  I mean we had a, a h-, whole,
uh, uh, [lipsmack]  self-contained apartment, so, uh, and it was ni-, nice. 
[breathing]  I'm going to sneeze in a second [laughter]. 

A.73:  Okay. 

B.74:  I'm going, wonder how they're going to, uh, record that.  Uh,

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  They, uh,

A.77:  I've been sneezing all day so,

B.78:  Have you? It's, uh, pollen season, I guess. 

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  But, uh, what he did was, this house is so big that, now that he's retired
and everything, what they do is they have a home in Florida and he com-, and
they, in the Summer when it's just too hot to stay in Florida, they go up to
New Hampshire and he built himself an apartment in another corner of the house
--

A.81:  Um. 

B.82:  -- and he and his, uh, wife stay up there, and then in the Winter they go
back to Florida.  And they live in a little trailer home in Florida. 

A.83:  Uh-huh.  That's always nice,

B.84:  # Yeah.  #

A.85:  # to # have, to know somebody like that [laughter]. 

B.86:  Oh, yeah. 

A.87:  That can, that's handy. 

B.88:  Yeah, of course he's, he built the shelves in the, in the garage for me
[laughter]. 

A.89:  You ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house. 

B.90:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure he'd, I'm sure he'd love to.  Uh, he, he's getting a
little impatient now, because I guess he's, uh, in his early eighties now. 

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  And, uh, he's still, you know, very active.  But, you know, the hand's just
not as steady as it used to be.  And drawing those lines, they just don't seem
to come out as straight as they used to.  And it frustrates him [breathing]. 

A.93:  Um. 

B.94:  I mean this guy, I mean, I used to think it was amazing when he was in his
sixties and seventies.  He used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and --

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  -- and, uh, I think if you didn't stop him, he'd still do it today
[laughter]. 

A.97:  [Laughter]  Oh.  I'm looking forward to owning a house or, getting a, a
small house,

B.98:  # Yeah.  #

A.99:  # that # meets our needs and then fixing it up. 

B.100:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Uh, our first house, uh, a real small house and,
uh, I, I did, you know, a lot of little things there.  I put, put up my own
gutters there.  And, uh, the, uh, being that it was in New England, uh, it was
one of these little houses that was all electric. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  And, uh, and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the
country --

A.103:  Um. 

B.104:  -- so I was, I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long,
cold Winters [breathing].  So I had a, uh, wood stove put in.  Big old wood
stove put in in the basement and I built, and I, uh, put in, uh, registers in
the floors and stuff --

A.105:  Yeah. 

B.106:  -- and it was a small house so that wood stove heated up the whole house. 

A.107:  Yeah. 

B.108:  A-,

A.109:  My parents have one of those.  They do, and they get really hot [breathing]
[noise].

B.110:  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, the nice thing about up there is, you know, you could
buy the wood pretty cheap.  In fact, what you did was during the Spring you'd
order the wood when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out, and
you could use it. 

A.111:  Uh-huh. 

B.112:  And you could get it really cheap when it was green. 

A.113:  Huh. 

B.114:  So that was the trick.  Where, where, where do you live?

A.115:  I live in Sherman now.  I'm from Indiana. 

B.116:  Oh, okay. 

A.117:  So, I've lived in Sherman three years. 

B.118:  Yeah. 

A.119:  Work for T I. 

B.120:  Yeah. 

A.121:  And, uh, [breathing]  like I said, I'm looking forward to [breathing], 
maybe buying a house while the interest rate's still cheap and --

B.122:  Right. 

A.123:  -- fixing it up. 

B.124:  Yeah, that, I think that, that's always fun and, and, you know you can save
a lot of money if you buy, buy one of these homes that need some fixing up, so
long as it doesn't have foundation problems. 

A.125:  Yeah. 

B.126:  And, uh, you can do a lot of,

A.127:  # Seems to be a lot of that.  #

B.128:  # nice stuff.  You can, uh, I mean # it can really be your home because
you've put your touch on it, you know. 

A.129:  Uh-huh. 

B.130:  That's, that's, that was the nice thing about having a house built was that
you got to pick, you know, the, the floor plan and you got to pick the color of
the carpet and, and all this kind of stuff. 

A.131:  Yeah. 

B.132:  But, uh, yeah, that's fun.  How long did you say you've been married?

A.133:  Uh, not even a year yet. 

B.134:  Oh.  Oh, those were the days.  I've got three kids now [laughter]. 

A.135:  Oh, really?

B.136:  And they're getting to the point, that's, that's, that's fun, too, you
know, talk about fixing up, they're getting to the point where they're old
enough to start pitching in and,

A.137:  # Yeah.  #

B.138:  # uh, # and helping with that kind of stuff. 

A.139:  My parents just got done fixing the house up again because, for our
wedding, you know, and then my brother's graduation, they finally finished the
basement after, like, living there fifteen years.

B.140:  Oh. 

A.141:  They had an occasion to finish it so,

B.142:  Yeah. 

A.143:  It was kind of neat to see it finally all come together. 

B.144:  Yeah.  That's nice.  I'd started to redo the basement in, uh, in our house
in New Hampshire.  I was going to make it into like a family room.  And I'd
started putting the flooring in, and stuff, but I never finished it.  The, uh,
the, uh, [lipsmack] we got transferred out here [laughter]. 

A.145:  Uh-huh. 

B.146:  Or actually got, I, I took the job out here and they moved me out here.
So, uh [noise].  Excuse the buzzer.

A.147:  I, I couldn't get used to the fact that houses down in Texas don't have
basements. 

B.148:  Oh, that was the, that's the hardest thing. 

A.149:  Because I love --

B.150:  For us, too. 

A.151:  -- like big rec rooms. 

B.152:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.153:  You know and,

B.154:  Oh, yeah.  My, my wife's house in New Hampshire had a pool table that,

A.155:  Uh-huh.
