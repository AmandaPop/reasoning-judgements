REMARKS:        Speakers A and B checking sections were broken up in some
portions of the tape. 

==========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any strong feelings about gun control?  

B.2:  I have pretty strong feelings about it, yeah.  I think that guns ought to
be controlled.

A.3:  Uh, I agree.  There should be some control, but, uh, how strong of, uh, a
control do you think there ought to be?

B.4:  Well, let's see on one to ten, I guess I vary.  I actually started out as a
member of the N R A [breathing] in my youth, [lipsmack] but having looked at
murder statistics in other countries, uh, it's so dramatic that I think that
I'm probably down to about a two or a three.

A.5:  Uh.  

B.6:  In terms of control.  

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  However, no, I'm sorry, maybe up to a nine or a ten.  

A.9:  [Laughter] Yeah, okay.  Got the scale going the other way. 

B.10:  Uh, I opened the almanac one day and it just has murders of, by, by guns
and you look, and you look at European countries, and, and it's like six,
eleven, four and you get to the U S and it's four thousand.

A.11:  Sure.  

B.12:  And that tells me something about [breathing],

A.13:  But, if you make owning a, a gun a crime, only criminals will have guns.
I've heard that before and that's probably true.

B.14:  Yeah, that [throat_clearing], that's, I mean the other problem is there's
so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be
millions and millions and millions of them.

A.15:  Sure.  

B.16:  But, uh, would, it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get
one so that every punk in [breathing] the world doesn't, doesn't pack a rod.

A.17:  Yeah, I agree with that.  I think that some states are just far too
lenient, uh, Texas and Florida are very easy on, uh, gun ownership,

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  being able to buy guns.  All it takes is a driver's license,

B.20:  [Throat_clearing].  

A.21:  [Breathing], and, uh, sign an affidavit, uh, saying that you didn't commit
any felonies.

B.22:  Right.  

A.23:  So, I think that ought to be, uh, tightened up.  I favor, uh, uh, holding,
uh, the guns say for, for seven days or whatever until, uh, you can check out
whether somebody is legitimate or not.

B.24:  [Breathing] Yeah.  

A.25:  And I think that might stop some of the, uh, impulsive crimes.  But, uh,
things that, like that are planned, uh, selling guns to New York City, things
of that nature, I don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that.
There's just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no
matter what the restrictions are.

B.26:  Yeah, I think, I think that you're right.  It would be the, pretty much the
same problem that, that prohibition is.  In fact, pretty much the same problem
that drug control is.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  If enough people want it and they're willing to pay for it, they'll get it.

A.29:  And a lot of people own guns just as a hobby.  And, uh, hunters in
particular,

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  they're, they're not, uh, buying guns to commit any crimes at all, just,
uh, uh, [breathing] pursuing their hobby.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  [Laughter] But it, it's, uh, ones, uh, say the midnight specials, uh, uh,
the semiautomatic weapons, uh, assault rifles, things like that, that, uh,
really have no place, uh, for a sportsman.

B.34:  Yeah, that's certainly true.  I mean I own a handgun myself.  I've actually
never fired the thing, but --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- [Breathing] but, uh, but I went out and bought it intending to, to learn
to use it and so on, but I never did.

A.37:  Yeah, I don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection,

B.38:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.

A.39:  but, uh, education is, is a big part of that.  People need to be educated
on how to, uh, how to, how to store their weapons, uh, so the kids can't get
at them.

B.40:  Right, right.  

A.41:  And so they're not a threat to the rest of the family.  A lot of people
don't get that type of education.  They don't have any k-, type of safeguards
on their weapons at all.

B.42:  Yeah, I mean, I certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a
box of bullets.  I suppose I could have gone and blown my own brains out or
anyone else's [laughter] who was,

A.43:  [Laughter].  

B.44:  who was nearby.  

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  Although I must say I have a healthy respect for the thing. 

A.47:  Yeah.  Uh, gun control legislation is, uh, is really tough to beat.  I mean
the N R A is so strong, and they lobby, uh, uh, a lot in Congress.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  So, uh, it's going to be really tough to, uh, add, uh, gun control type of
laws to what we already have.

B.50:  [Breathing] Yeah, it's, uh, it sort of amazes me that, that in the Gulf
War people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred
people dying.  And if a thousand people died in that war, it would have been a
mess, and if five thousand had died, it would have been considered a national
calamity,

A.51:  Yeah, 

B.52:  and yet, that many people [breathing] die, uh, from gunshot wounds.  Yeah,
I mean I think that we have our values in a in a sort of, in, in a funny
place.

A.53:  Yeah, uh, yeah, I'll have to agree with that.  It, uh, I never really
correlated, uh, those two incidences, say crime at home, uh, versus an
international war [breathing], but, uh, yeah, I guess I don't know how to, how
to place that.

B.54:  Yeah, I mean, in some, in some fields we seem to have this really profound
respect for human life and in other fields we don't.  I think guns and
automobiles are the two places where we're willing to take our licks.  You
know, we're willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year.

A.55:  Yeah, uh, that's, that's true, uh, and, uh, when it gets to the point where
it's unacceptable, where the majority of the people find it unacceptable, they
may find cause to write their Congressman,

B.56:  [Throat_clearing].  

A.57:  and lobby for some stronger controls.  

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  But, uh, yeah, we are very tol-, a very tolerant society.  And, uh, it
takes a great deal of, uh, abuse before we get our act together.

B.60:  Yeah, in some areas.  But, I think in other areas, uh, I don't know, I
guess this, this, this, this Gulf War came to mind where, where, uh, well, war
just comes to mind.  You know, couple a hundred people get, get blown up and
it's, and it really shakes the country to it's roots --

A.61:  Right.  

B.62:  -- maybe just because of the way it happens.  

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  And, uh, but, you know, we'll go all out, uh, to save, uh, a child with a
rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in
contributions and, and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is
considered so precious,

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  when it's viewed, somehow when it's viewed in, I don't know as, as a single
life, it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic, whether
it's guns or automobiles or smoking, uh, people just don't see those as
individual lives somehow, or they don't, they don't, uh, relate to them
personally.

A.67:  I think it depends on, uh, who's leading the crusade [breathing] and how
strong they feel about it.  Take, for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
That used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife.

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  And now it's a national organization.  They, they're very powerful, uh,
they collect a lot of money [laughter].

B.70:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.71:  And, uh, it, I think it's made an impact.  I mean, it, it's made a lot of
people cut down on their, their drinking and driving because the laws are
enforced stronger now.

B.72:  [Breathing] Yeah it,

A.73:  D W I  convictions are very serious.  

B.74:  Yeah, they are, and, and it's really changing the social structure of
things.  I know I went out [breathing] with a bunch of people, I don't know,
six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the
waitress [laughter] asked us which one was driving.

A.75:  Right.  

B.76:  She didn't want to, wasn't going to serve that person anything.

A.77:  Because, uh, they're liable.  Anybody who serves anything to anybody is
liable.

B.78:  Um.  

A.79:  Can be sued.

B.80:  Yeah, I didn't think about that.  I sort of thought that,

A.81:  With guns I think it ought to be the same way.  

B.82:  [Throat_clearing].  

A.83:  I think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that
happen with those weapons.

B.84:  Yeah, I thought that was the case.  I mean, if, uh, if my kid grabs my gun
and goes and shoots somebody I would really have the feeling that they're
going to come banging on my door.

A.85:  Well, I saw a talk show just the other night where, uh, there was a mother
on the show and her, uh, son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of
the neighbor's handguns,

B.86:  Um.  

A.87:  when only the other kids were at home.  They apparently had three handguns
that were, uh, in plain sight, one on top of the refrigerator, one in the, on
the bedroom dresser, and one somewhere else, but, uh,

B.88:  Um.

A.89:  just teenagers and, uh, and grade school kids at home and one of the kids
got shot by a gun, got killed.  And apparently no charges were filed against
the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer [laughter].

B.90:  Um. [laughter], I don't know what that says, it's pretty sad.

A.91:  So, it's, I guess they say accidents will happen and, uh, [laughter], uh,
you know it's just hard to say who's at fault for, uh, things like that that
happen.

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  But somebody's got to be, uh, uh, somebody's got to be held responsible,
{pause} ultimately.  So, I don't know.  I think the law should be tightened up
on, on gun ownership, but I can't see a total ban on it at all.  Uh, because
then you're still going to have criminals with guns and [laughter] it's not
going to help, uh, the situation, uh, there.  People want to break the law,
they're going to do it.

B.94:  Yeah, it's, well, it's just too late.  I mean there are countries, I've
lived in both Japan and England, where guns are not available, even criminals
don't carry them or it's so hard to get and the, and the law is so severe for
people caught using them that by and large, uh, they don't.

A.95:  Well, they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature,
too.  You can't get them through airports, uh,

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  You know, like in, uh, 

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Germany in the airports there, where there, uh, where terrorism is so much
of a threat, uh, the, uh, policemen have, uh, automatic weapons [laughter].
You know, and, uh, I don't know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle
guns into a country like that, but I imagine they're quite severe.

B.100:  Yeah.  No, I think by the, [laughter] by the, the, the year nineteen
hundred there were probably enough guns in the U S, I mean it's just always
been a way of life here.

A.101:  Right.  

B.102:  The wild, wild west.  

A.103:  Well, I've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as
much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his
brother's got a gun at home.

B.104:  [Laughter].  

A.105:  What are you going to do about that.  You got two hundred million guns here
and, [laughter] it's, uh, it's more than just an army.

B.106:  Well, yeah, that's, uh, that's a point.  Although, uh, if that's the case,
why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry, I
wonder.

A.107:  Well, there, that's your, your professional army.  Uh, that's your first
line of defense [laughter].

B.108:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.109:  Uh, that, that's for your, your mercenary forces that go acro-, overseas
and, and attack other countries, but at, at home here,

B.110:  [Laughter] Right.
