============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  I, uh, I think in general that the, the, uh, one of the biggest
change in, in, uh, the role of women in the last two generations is the fact
that because of the, uh, probably the national debt as a matter of fact but
the, uh, impossibility of, of, uh, making ends meet even in a family that
which has a two, two parent family,

B.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.3:  # that # many women work out of the home now. 

B.4:  Uh-huh. 

A.5:  And probably that is the biggest, uh, change of her role that she now has
to, uh, not only be, uh, mother, uh, nurturer, or whatever but she also has to,
to help earn the, earn the,

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # income # that comes into the home. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  And, uh, and it has,

B.10:  Oh I, I'd agree with you, I think that is one of the big,

A.11:  # Right.  #

B.12:  # big # changes. 

A.13:  It has, uh, uh, has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and
it can be very negative. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  Uh, and, uh, I think a lot of the problems that we, that we have in, in
school, in education, a lot of the problems we have in drugs, a lot of the
problems we have in, in, uh, uh, juvenile delinquency, whatever, probably can
be laid right at that door [laughter].

B.16:  Um. 

A.17:  Because, uh, uh, a child who does not have the kind of underpinnings that
you can get, uh, with, uh, with a parent in the home whether it's the father
or the mother --

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  -- uh, it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who
does. 

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  That's the kind of, uh, what would it be, uh, uh, calming influence or
[laughter]  whatever. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. 

A.23:  Uh, I think another thing, it gives them the feeling of, of, uh, the
importance of their position,

B.24:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.25:  # as # a child, you know, and, and, course, most of their problems come
from, uh, lack of ego --

B.26:  Yeah. 

A.27:  -- as opposed to too much ego.  Most of them, uh, do things because they
either want attention or because they, they feel that they're not worthy --

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  -- and so they, they do things that they're not, not what the, the norm
would like them to do,

B.30:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # so # that it is always kind of negative. 

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  Wha-, what do you feel about, how do you feel about the role of women, uh,
yo-, being a man that ma-, that gives you a different [laughter],

B.34:  Well I mean, I, I, I agree with you substantially.  I think, uh, I think
getting women because of, you know, declining standard of living, we're not
living as well as our parents did or making as much money, uh, and, uh, that
was probably to a degree true for them.  I mean it's no longer the case where,
uh, many people can afford to have one parent,

A.35:  # Right.  #

B.36:  # stay # at home and raise the kids or whatever,

A.37:  # Um.  #

B.38:  # so # a lot of people are opting not to have kids or both parents are
working and you got to rely on things like day-care,

A.39:  # That's right.  #

B.40:  # uh, to # raise the kids.  And certainly that's not going to be as stable
an environment as, uh, when you do have a #parent at home,#

A.41:  #((Yeah, I think that's proba-,))#

B.42:  taking care of them and I, I agree with you completely, I think that's,
that's certainly having a lot of effects on our society. 

A.43:  Yeah, I think so. 

B.44:  Uh. 

A.45:  Do, do you have children?

B.46:  No I don't. 

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  No, I'm #single.# 

A.49:  #Okay.# 

B.50:  Uh, but, uh, th-, I mean, I think that's one of the major things and I
think that's had a lot of side effects in the way women get treated in society
--

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  -- uh, I guess one of the things that we can concern ourselves with is, is
how things are likely to continue to change, uh, in the immediate future. 

A.53:  I, I think that's probably true.  I think one of the problems is that, that
government in their meddling [laughter]  tends to encourage that,

B.54:  # Yeah.  #

A.55:  # instead # of discourage it. 

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  Instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do,

B.58:  # Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #

A.59:  # something satisfying # in another area, you know, I, I think there are
women who need to do things other than just be a mother but I think that's
possible --

B.60:  Right. 

A.61:  -- I mean I don't think that education or anything else starts at school,
it starts in your head #and# --

B.62:  #Uh-huh,# um. 

A.63:  -- and any te-, anyplace you are you can #educate,#

B.64:  #I agree# with you. 

A.65:  be educated. 

B.66:  I agree with you. 

A.67:  And so i-, it doesn't mean they have to stop doing all the things that they
might want to do --

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  -- and, uh, and so, but, but the #environment,#

B.70:  #And I don't#  think it, I don't think it even means that all women
necessarily, have to stay home and raise kids either, you know, I mean,

A.71:  No, no, #nor,#

B.72:  #it should be optional.# 

A.73:  do they have to stay home all the time. 

B.74:  Right. 

A.75:  There are lots of ways that they, that you can do this.  But the, but the
problem is that they have so little choice. 

B.76:  Right.  Well I'd like to see, for example, more flextime in the workplace,

A.77:  # Yeah.  #

B.78:  # I # mean I think that would certainly #help things, uh,#

A.79:  #Yeah, I think that's right.  I think that would be#  good. 

B.80:  the greater acceptance of part-time jobs.  

A.81:  Right --

B.82:  Uh. 

A.83:  -- and have, and have, and, and, if, if anybody is going to help them
decide about uh, about day-care or something, maybe it needs to be something
worked out in, uh, in, uh, in, uh, uh, a workplace --

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  -- so that they can, their children can go there so that they can see them,
so that they can have this, uh, you know, during lunchtime, or whatever --

B.86:  Uh-huh. 

A.87:  -- some kind of, a better, uh, contact and more, uh, a better feeling of,
of the fact that they are the important thing in this,

B.88:  # Um, uh-huh.  #

A.89:  # household as # opposed to the work schedule being the important thing in
this household.

B.90:  Yeah.  I think there's also a lot of interesting side effects to women
having taken a more prominent position in the workplace.  I think it's changed
the workplace in, in a lot of respects. 

A.91:  Uh-huh. 

B.92:  And, uh, interestingly enough it also seems to have shortened, uh, women's
life spans, #so there's,#

A.93:  #I would#  imagine, that's right.

B.94:  there's, there's something to be said about, you know, all the stress
related,

A.95:  # That's right.  #

B.96:  # kinds of # things that, that happen when you do have a full time job.

A.97:  That's right.  It's not, and, and, and the, the problem is you see, tha-,
it isn't just the stress of the work but the-, but they had plenty of stress
before --

B.98:  Uh-huh. 

A.99:  -- now they're just doubling their stress. 

B.100:  That's right. 

A.101:  And tha-, and that's really, uh, really more than you can take sometimes.
I think that's true.  That's true.

B.102:  Uh-huh. 

A.103:  I, I think that, uh, uh, there are a lot of really positive things about
the changes, about, uh, uh, more women going for, for, uh, better educations
and, uh,

B.104:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.105:  # all # these things.  I think in, uh, in a person's life there are a lots
of,

B.106:  They have more freedom. 

A.107:  Right and there are lots of, of stages of your life where you can do things
that you didn't do --

B.108:  Uh-huh. 

A.109:  -- uh, at some other time.  Tha-, uh, if you're better prepared you're
going to be able to take advantage of those things maybe later or, or maybe
#during# --

B.110:  #Right.# 

A.111:  -- sometimes. 

B.112:  Well, I also think there's no longer sort of this predisposition that the
woman has to be the caretaker and the upbringer for the children.  I think
that's starting to dissipate.

A.113:  Right, right. 

B.114:  And I think that's good too. 

A.115:  Yeah. 

B.116:  I mean there's no reason why the father couldn't do it. 

A.117:  That's right, I think so too.  With,

B.118:  Uh, I, I agree with you that I think someone needs to do it, #that's
important.#

A.119:  #Someone needs# to do it, that's the thing.  We just, we just came from,
our son just graduated from, uh, from, in his Master's Degree, and his wife is
a nurse,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.121:  # and # he had just graduated in social services work and, uh, uh, when she
went back, they just had a, a baby in January and when she went back to work
she says okay, I'll work, I'll work five days in two weeks but it has to be
the times when he's home --

B.122:  Uh-huh. 

A.123:  -- and so that one of them is taking care of this baby all the time.  But
it's a neat thing to watch because he's as [beep] adept at it as she is.

B.124:  Uh-huh. 

A.125:  And, and equally as comfortable and I think that is a neat thing.  It,
it'll be neat for the children too if you can get a relationship like that
but, where the, where the husband is comfortable --

B.126:  Right, yeah, I th-,

A.127:  -- doing those things because children badly need more of that.  Badly need
more of that. 

B.128:  Yeah.  Well I, I think it will help the kids be better adjusted when they
grow up. 

A.129:  That's right.  Badly mo-, well hey, it's been good to talk to you. 

B.130:  Yeah.  It's been nice talking to you too. 

A.131:  Yeah.  All right, have a good day. 

B.132:  You too. 

A.133:  #Bye-bye.# 

B.134:  #Bye.#
