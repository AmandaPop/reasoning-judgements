throughout the entire conversation.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. 

A.2:  All righty.  I think one of the most significant changes that have happened
is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market. 

B.3:  Uh-huh. 

A.4:  And for several reasons.  Probably some of that is divorce and some is
they're more educated than they used to be I think. 

B.5:  Uh-huh. 

A.6:  Uh, I think sometimes, uh, leaders in government they've become more, uh,
adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time. 

B.7:  Uh-huh. 

A.8:  We have more women in government. 

B.9:  Uh-huh. 

A.10:  [Lipsmack]  And, now I'll let you say something [laughter]. 

B.11:  Well, uh, I probably a little bit older than you are, so what I see, uh,
is, the change that I see the most is, is that, uh, women have much more, many
more occupations and careers to choose from than when I w-, went to college.
When I went to college [breathing] you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or
a secretary, or, but there were very few women in business at that time.  A
few, but they were the oddity.  And,

A.12:  Very limited. 

B.13:  Yes.  And now I see and, and I see for my daughter, which is wonderful
[breathing] this, she's thirteen and I see a whole [breathing] wonderful world
out there that she can choose from,

A.14:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.15:  # so # many different jobs, which I think is terrific. 

A.16:  Yes. 

B.17:  Because I'm a teacher and, I mean, I love teaching, but, there, I think
there are a lot of other things I would have liked better. 

A.18:  Uh-huh. 

B.19:  And, uh, not that I would give the career up because it's, it's a safe
career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,

A.20:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.21:  # and # I n-, I need the income. 

A.22:  Right. 

B.23:  But, uh, and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have, have
started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must.

A.24:  I think that's right. 

B.25:  Uh, you just, it's very difficult to get along on one income unless
[breathing],  uh, the male, uh, has an extraordinarily good job. 

A.26:  Uh-huh. 

B.27:  And [talking] especially men who teach school, they don't make that much
money, and, and most all, they always either have [breathing]  they're either
moonlighting or else their, their wife works, too. 

A.28:  Right. 

B.29:  Uh, it's just an economic need now. 

A.30:  I really think women have so much more responsibility than, you know, as
far as everything.

B.31:  Oh, definitely. 

A.32:  And, like you said, uh, one, women today have so many, uh, the average
today of having a, a single family, you know, with the mother as the head,

B.33:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.34:  # you # know, it just really, uh, so commonplace,

B.35:  # Oh, yes, exactly. #

A.36:  # nowadays.  #

B.37:  We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and,

A.38:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.39:  # uh, # the majority is, uh, married couple with children, but still
there's a lot more than there used to be.  And see you never picture yourself
in a situation like this.  When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest
of my life.

A.40:  Right, right. 

B.41:  And, uh, [breathing]  but I'm all, I'm really grateful that I went to
college.  My mother always said, you know, get an education in case you need
one, a-, because my father died when we were, I have a twin sister and we were
eleven when he died and she had a nursing degree,

A.42:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.43:  # and # she was able to make it.  But, she said in j-, you never know
what's going to happen and I thank God that I did go to college [breathing]
and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise
my children.

A.44:  You know, isn't that funny, uh, because the same thing happened to us,
except I was twelve.  And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make
it in her profession,

B.45:  # Isn't that something.  #

A.46:  # and was, isn't # that funny?

B.47:  Yes. 

A.48:  Uh, but, just, that they were able to do it,

B.49:  # Yes.  #

A.50:  # you # know, and even today I think the chance for education is j-, is, is
so much, uh, better for all of our girls,

B.51:  # Oh, yes.  #

A.52:  # and, and # boys, too.  But, but the girls especially. 

B.53:  Yeah, I do, too.  But I think it needs to continue to change and I m-, I
think it, there's still not equality as far as, uh, paychecks for men and
women.  I think that the, we still have a long way to go. 

A.54:  A lot of things, yeah. 

B.55:  Uh-huh.  And I think that, uh, I think by the year two thousand it, we're
going to see some, a lot more changes, uh, hopefully, that women are, you know,
able to get the, the executive jobs,

A.56:  # Right.  #

B.57:  # and # hold positions that men, [breathing]  men do because they can do it
just as well, you know, if they want to dedicate their, most of their time to
that they, they're, they can do it. 

A.58:  Yeah.  And I also think that in the future that, uh, it's going to
continue.  We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force. 

B.59:  Uh-uh. 

A.60:  I think they're going to stay there and I think that they're going to, uh,
uh, be really responsible and, and do everything just like, what you said, you
know, make, make it the grade and, and make it so women can be the top people
in their,

B.61:  # Exactly.  #

A.62:  # in # their field. 

B.63:  Exactly.  And I think that's the way it should be.  I think it [breathing],

A.64:  Oh, I think so. 

B.65:  I mean, not that I, I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of
things that men can do that I, [breathing]  could never do strength wise and so
forth --

A.66:  Right. 

B.67:  -- but, also there's some things women can do [laughter]  like have
children,

A.68:  # [Laughter].  #

B.69:  # that # men can't do. 

A.70:  Right. 

B.71:  So, you know, it, I don't w-, I don't want to be equal but, I, I want to
be, I want to get what I deserve and I want to be able to be on the same level
with them.  If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same
pay, you know.

A.72:  Exactly. 

B.73:  And,

A.74:  Exactly. 

B.75:  And I just, I'm not a women's libber.  I really am not.  But I, I think
that [breathing] that we have just as many rights as they do.  And I feel like
if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a
man then she sh-, they should get the job with the same pay.

A.76:  That's right.  And I think that is happening more and more. 

B.77:  I do, too. 

A.78:  I think it's just going to take a little bit longer. 

B.79:  Oh, I do, too.  Definitely [talking]. 

A.80:  Well, great, okay. 

B.81:  Well, it was good to talk to you. 

A.82:  Good to talk to you, Sally. 

B.83:  All right. 

A.84:  Thanks. 

B.85:  Bye-bye. 

A.86:  Bye-bye.
