=======================================================================

A.1:  [Beep]  Um, I was thinking about the, uh, the topic, you know --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- while they were searching for a person --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

@A.5:  -- and, uh, while I was thinking about it I just flipped on my T V, and it
was funny because I thought about today how so much of, I mean, I, even my
social life, is --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- renting movies or sitting at home, and, you know, watching a rented
movie or watching a movie on --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- T V and just now it's so, I mean, ev-, everything is just so, uh, easy
that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  You know what I mean?

B.12:  I do, and like even, even little kids who watch like SESAME STREET and
everything's really fast paced and they don't have to, to sit down and
concentrate on one thing for a long time (( )).

A.13:  Yeah.  I mean, I remember when I was little, my friends, uh, my parents,
I'm sorry, would just go over people's houses and just sort of, you know, sit
and talk --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- and before T V and all that people would sit and listen to the radio,
and, and that, I mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized
and --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- um, it's really pretty incredible.

B.18:  Yeah, just the other day I, uh, some A M station or something had a, um,
like a radio show, just like the old days, you know --

A.19:  Oh, really?

B.20:  -- it was like from the old days, and I was thinking gosh, that's, I mean,
because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and --

A.21:  I know.

B.22:  -- you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it,
and it's, I mean, you know, it's just too bad that everybody has everything
fed to them.

A.23:  Uh-huh [inhaling].  And, you know, when you think about, oh, I was watching
reruns of HAPPY DAYS,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  the other day, and, um, to think that that was the social life of
teenagers to go, 

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  to, uh, you know, a, a place like Arnold's and order a soda pop --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- and, uh, you know, sit and hang out and, and, you know, just the dress
codes, the whole atmosphere, the whole attitude of teenagers and social life
was totally different then.

B.30:  Yeah, I mean, now we always have to do something new or better --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- or more exciting, can't just --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- sit around and talk for awhile, you know.

A.35:  I know.

B.36:  It's too bad.

A.37:  I know.  And also, um, I think that it's so much more dangerous for people
now.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  I mean, before you could go out and, and, you know, you didn't have all the
drunk drivers --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and you didn't have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong
crowds and this and that, and now that's really a problem --

B.42:  Yeah, #it really is.#

A.43:  -- #you know?# But what, what do you do most of the time for social
activities?

B.44:  Um, just, well, I'm fifteen, so [laughter],

A.45:  Oh, okay.

B.46:  Oh just, a lot of times we do sit around and, because like, uh, I'm really
glad that I'm in like, uh, the classes, like honors classes and so --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- it's like, what's really good about that is that you meet people who
really are interested in, in talking about things --

A.49:  Yes.

B.50:  -- and discussing world issues and --

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  -- it just, and it makes me sick to go to school and know people who just,
that's all they do is like go out and, [noise] you know try to go, find a new
guy or something --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- it's just so immature, and, #oh# --

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  -- just futile, you know.

A.57:  Yeah, I, I definitely agree.  Um, are your, you can't drive yet then, can
you?

B.58:  No, I'll be driving in a few months.

A.59:  Okay.  Oh, in a few months you said?

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  Oh, that's good.  Well, you're going to find that driving changes your
social life completely --

B.62:  Yeah [laughter].

A.63:  -- I mean, suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go, it's
amazing.  I mean, I don't know if you'll always have a car around that's --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- a different issue but, um, uh, just even being able to go to a movie
when you want and --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and not relying on somebody else, it's really pretty nice.

B.68:  Yeah, it is.

A.69:  But, um, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's just [laughter] because I
like to eat but,

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a
new restaurant --

B.72:  Yeah?

A.73:  -- and, uh, and, I don't know, just go and, I don't know, try like a, a new
ethnic restaurant --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- you know, Indian food or, or something like that, and I think so often
we do social things, like you were saying, you know, going out and picking up
guys or --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- or whatever, social things that don't really, are, that aren't really
social.  Like --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- when you go to a movie, you're not sitting and talking to anybody.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  And when you go to a bar, it's usually so loud or so crowded --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- that you even, that you can't talk to anybody --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- you know.  Um, and going out to dinner, I think, is a nice way.  You're
out, you're out of the house, um --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- I think, playing games is something that my friends and I love to do.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  We've, um, we've bought Pictionary,

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  you probably know that, and --

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- I don't know, some other games, and, um, and I know this sounds kind of
corny but,

B.94:  It was, it does sound corny, but it's so much fun.

A.95:  It really is,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  and if you get the right group of friends they --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- have a good attitude about it, then, you know, you can have a pretty
good time.

B.100:  Yeah, you really can.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  It's awesome.

A.103:  I personally think that I should have been born in the fifties because --

B.104:  Yeah [laughter].

A.105:  -- I do, I do love that era and, uh, and I really think that I could have
gotten into, I don't know, the, the music and the lifestyle and, um, things
just seemed so much easier, didn't they?

B.106:  Yeah, yeah.

A.107:  You know, it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about
[lipsmack].

B.108:  I know, everybody's, I mean, everybody's always busy and worried and so
many problems.  People don't just sit down and, you know, just talk and --

A.109:  Yeah --

B.110:  -- know everything's going to be okay.

A.111:  -- yeah, that's true.  Well, who knows.  Maybe another, maybe the, the
twenty-first century will bring a whole new #type# --

B.112:  #Yeah# --

A.113:  -- of social life.

B.114:  -- yeah, things go in cycles, you know, maybe,

A.115:  Yeah.  I get very frustrated when I go over to a friend's house and all
they want to do is sit and play computer games.

B.116:  Oh, yeah.

A.117:  You know, I, I don't know if you're familiar with any of them but,

B.118:  [Laughter]. 

A.119:  they're, they're fun, you know, and they're --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- they're, you know, not bad to like take up some time, but they just are
so, um, exclusive.  #You know# --

B.122:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.123:  -- you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and
the, the next room could be on fire,

B.124:  [Laughter].

A.125:  and they'll never know it, you know.

B.126:  Oh, that's the truth.

@@A.127:  But [inhaling].  Well, it was nice talking to you.

B.128:  Yeah, nice talking to you.

A.129:  Yeah, and gosh, I hope you guys cool off down there.

B.130:  Yeah [laughter] (( )).

A.131:  [Laughter] Okay.  

B.132:  Talk to you later.

A.133:  All righty, bye-bye.

B.134:  Bye.
