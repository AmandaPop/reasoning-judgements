============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [breathing], I will, I guess I will start and say that I keep up, uh,
with current events mostly from three or four areas,

B.2:  # Uh-huh.  #

@A.3:  # and # I'll tell you what they are and, uh, then you, uh, would you
please, uh,

B.4:  # Sure.  #

A.5:  # tell # me how you do it.  I think I keep up better with what's going on
in the world from the newspaper.  But I usually am introduced to subjects by
television.

B.6:  And then if something that struck your fancy, then you pay attention more
to that kind of topic then when you get the newspaper.

A.7:  Exactly.  In more detail. 

B.8:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.9:  I also take, uh, TIME magazine, and I enjoy that a lot and, uh, I get a lot
of, uh, I think pretty good detail there.  And, uh, I'm pretty, I'm pretty
satisfied with, I think those, and some friends who are, who are very
knowledgeable. 

B.10:  Uh-huh, yes. 

A.11:  And how, how do you?

B.12:  Well, basically the same thing.  I, I know, uh, my husband's favorite radio
station in all the world is K R L D.  He, we wakeup to K R L D, we go to sleep
at night to K R L D [breathing] and, I used to just really argue about that
and battle that, and I don't so much anymore, because I do want to keep up and
know what's going on, and, it helps [breathing].  I don't often, uh, have time
to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing, but, if I'm around
during the daytime and have a chance, I'll switch on C N N [breathing]
[cough].  Always have watched C N N ever since we got the cable.

A.13:  Yes. 

B.14: Uh, you know, coverage that provided for that, and have always enjoyed it
and, uh, am glad to see them getting a little, uh, boost these days since the,
uh, war.

A.15:  Yes. 

B.16:  Little more, uh, recognition and credibility. 

A.17:  Yes. 

B.18:  [Breathing] Uh, I, uh, have access to TIME and NEWSWEEK and THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL all which I rely on more I think than what I get over network T V,

A.19:  # Yes [static].  #

B.20:  # news.  [Lipsmack] # And, like you, you know, knowledgeable friends.  I
work for a fellow who is, uh, in the oil industry internationally and travels
a lot to third world countries and all around, and I feel like a lot of times
from what we get from his contacts is far more valid,

A.21:  # Wonderful.  #

B.22:  # than, # you know, but, that's only in a real specialized area. 

A.23:  Of course [throat_clearing]. 

B.24:  You know, it's, that's just political, it's not a medical arena, it's not
technology particularly, al-, although sometimes it overlaps [breathing] into
those kinds of things.  But, I don't think I would be satisfied if all I had
was just television.

A.25:  No. 

B.26:  You know, the, uh, the newspapers I think, {pause}, you know, they, I think
a lot of the meat of what I get out tel-, out of the t-, newspaper's not on
the front page.

A.27:  I think that's right, too.  Well, especially THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
[laughter]. 

B.28:  Yeah, yeah.  I, uh, [noise],  I have really enjoyed being able to have
access to that the last couple of years.  It, uh,

A.29:  Don't you find, though, that it's hard to find time,

B.30:  # Yes.  #

A.31:  # to, # yes, to,

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  The reading is, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, if I don't read it the day that it
comes in, then if they start piling up on me,

B.34:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.35:  # then # I have to just forget about, about it usually. 

B.36:  Well, and, you know, you just take a, uh, a newspaper just your regular
daily average big city newspaper, there's more information in one than an
entire month magazine, you know, a monthly periodical.

A.37:  Yes. 

B.38:  [Breathing]  And, a lot of times I'll just take the whole thing soon as I
get it and I take out the sections I want, trash the rest, otherwise, you, like
you say, the, the stack of paper is so large,

A.39:  Really. 

B.40:  It's unmanageable just in your home situation [laughter]. 

A.41:  It really is. 

B.42:  You know. 

A.43:  And especially if you're trying to save papers for,

B.44:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.45:  # recycling.  #

B.46:  That's right.  Yeah. 

A.47:  Just terrible job. 

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  But, uh, I think I enjoy, uh, TIME and I, I get INSIGHT, and I don't like
that magazine very much.

B.50:  I, I'm not familiar with it. 

A.51:  It looks like a little TIME. 

B.52:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

A.53:  But, it is not written as well as TIME staff, uh, writers do [breathing].
But I, I like some of those magazines because they just choose certain
subjects, I guess.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  And deal with with a, a,

B.56:  Well, I'm a non fiction oriented kind of person anyway.  Oh, I enjoy a good
novel.  But, you know, given the choice in the doctor's office when they're
all lined up, I'm much more apt to grab the TIME or NEWSWEEK or U S NEWS AND
WORLD REPORTS that I ever would PEOPLE or MCCALL'S or, although I've, you
know, I read those kinds of things, too, occasionally, and, and, and find
things that are current and,

A.57:  # Well, #

B.58:  # updated, # but I don't know, I just, just my particular predisposition.
I tend more the other way so,

A.59:  Yes. 

B.60:  I try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read. 

A.61:  Right. 

B.62:  [Breathing]  Because my reading time comes in little snatches [laughter]. 

A.63:  [Breathing]. 

B.64:  I have five kids [breathing].  So by the time I get around to actually
reading, I ha-, you know, I may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot to read
so,

A.65:  I guess. 

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  You have five children.  Well. 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  Uh. 

B.70:  Well, they're good kids. 

A.71:  Oh, well, of course. 

B.72:  And this, you know, this is another reason, though I think that [breathing]
makes me real aware and encouraging because I know there's always a, a tidbit
of information that's going to come across some-, I'm either going to read it
or I'm going to hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report.

A.73:  Exactly. 

B.74:  So, if I hear a statistic that's interesting or whatnot, even just driving
in the car, I'll make a little note, and, uh, you know, of where that came from
and the time I heard it and whatnot so that they can use that in a
bibliography. 

A.75:  Well, you are passing good information on to them aren't you [laughter]. 

B.76:  I hope so, I hope so.  I think kids tend to watch news for the
sensationalism.

A.77:  Yes. 

B.78:  My kids love to watch the news, but it's not always, you know, you wonder
if it's for the right reason [laughter].

A.79:  Right. 

B.80:  Not just the gore [laughter]. 

A.81:  They've heard it, though. 

B.82:  Yeah, yeah.  But I think it's a good habit to,

A.83:  # Sure it is.  #

B.84:  # to establish and, #

A.85:  It has been nice talking to you. 

B.86:  Thank you so much, and, uh,

A.87:  Enjoyed it a great deal. 

B.88:  I'll, uh, just be anxious to tell my daughter's friend that there's a nice
lady out there [laughter], 

A.89:  There really is [laughter]. 

B.90:  And that, there's [laughter], 

A.91:  It's beautiful. 

B.92:  She's not falling off the face of the Earth. 

A.93:  It really is beautiful.  You will en-, I know she will enjoy it. 

B.94:  Well, my daughter hopes to come visit,

A.95:  # Oh.  #

B.96:  # before # too long, so we're, uh, we're anxious to point that way
sometime. 

A.97:  Good. 

B.98:  Take care and have a good day. 

A.99:  Thank you, you too. 

B.100:  Bye-bye.
