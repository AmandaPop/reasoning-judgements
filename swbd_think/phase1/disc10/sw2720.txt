=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Michelle, um, could you give me a few ideas on what you think is
wrong with our public school system [cough]?

@B.2:  Um, I don't think that the parents back the teachers enough any more, like
with discipline and, and such, and I think that the, um, because of that, the
teachers are starting to lose, oh, I don't know, lose interest, like, you
know, before like they would really try and help you, I think, and I can see
the difference from when I was in high school, and my little brothers and
sisters are in it now, where the teachers, like they can't discipline you
whenever you are, you know, so they just don't even care any more.

A.3:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] I'm not sure if that's, if that's a condition of,
of the lack of interest of the parents or if that's a condition of the
administrators in the school systems.  Uh, [throat_clearing] I've got a
brother-in-law that was, was teaching in Connecticut, down by the navy base --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and they have a, a, a fairly a transient population, you know, they're
only stationed there for a short period of time, so most of the kids never get
to finish high school, uh, there one or two years and then they have to be,
they're shipped off some place else [throat_clearing].  And he teaches, uh, he
teaches English and he teaches, uh, shop --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and it got to a point where he said that the administrators were coming
to him just about every year having him downgrade his English exams because
too many students were failing them.

B.8:  Oh, that's not good [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  So in that particular school system, um, that was, that was one of the
problems, and I guess one of the reasons the administrators, uh, were, were
putting so much pressure on him was, uh, the parents were going to them
saying, you know, My Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that, and blah, blah,
blah, and they can't fail, and so,

B.12:  Oh, you know, and that's really bad, because that's really hurting them in
the long run, because up here at college now, um, we are so far behind the
foreign students --

A.13:  That's right [throat_clearing].

B.14:  -- they are so far more advanced than we are, and a lot of them even know
their English grammar better than I do, and they can't speak it as well, but,
I mean, to write it is probably better than the way I write it.

A.15:  Um, yeah, because they, uh, [cough] they care --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- it's something that they want to learn, um, I'm sure you're, you're
more, uh, fluent in other things, the things that you're interested in than
some other people, too.  Uh, I've been out of school for a long time, so, you
know, when I went to school, I, it was in a rural area, and they had like two
grades in the same class, so when you're, I think it was, uh,
[throat_clearing] first and second, third and fourth were in the same
classroom, so when you went through the first grade and you graduated, you
went to the second grade, you just moved to the second half of the class --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- on the other side of the room.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  I found, looking back on it now, that when I was in the second grade, I
knew just about everything that was there, I had learned it from the first
grade, and the same thing with the fourth, I had learned it.  So it's the
amount of teaching you get, I think, uh, um, you're like a sponge when you're
young.  You absorb just about everything that they can throw at you.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Um, today, well, you're, you're closer to it now than I am.  Um, did you go
to high school in Pennsylvania?

B.24:  Yes, I did.

A.25:  Okay, so that's you're, you're native then, to Pennsylvania --

B.26:  Uh-huh

A.27:  -- so, how was your high school?  Did they have with the split out, like
some people were going to college, so they took certain courses, and some
people were shop,

B.28:  Okay, yeah, we had, um, college advanced courses, and if you were going to
college you could take them, or if you didn't want to go to college you didn't
have to take them, but they were opt-, you know, they were there if anyone
wanted to take them, just because you were going, if you, if you wanted to
take them and you weren't going to college, you still could --

A.29:  Okay.

B.30:  -- they didn't limit it to just the people who wanted to college could take
them.

A.31:  Okay.

B.32:  Our math, I think we were very strong in our math.  We were taking tests
and our math was, um, placing like third and fourth in, like the nation, where
you had to send them in --

A.33:  Oh, that was good, yeah.

B.34:  -- [Throat_clearing] and our, and our, you know, for our level and stuff
like that, you know, they had the placing, we're placing third or fourth, but
our English, I feel, was way below.

A.35:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].

B.36:  I don't know if I'm just more math oriented, but like even on my S A T -s I
scored two hundred more points on my math than I did in my English, and to
have that big of a spread is unreal.

A.37:  Yeah, um, and we were just the opposite.  Up here, um, I took the same
algebra class two years in a row --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- same book, same teacher, and that's only because of our school system,
but as far as English, um, we had a professor that taught English, which was
very unusual for our school system.  So our English was probably better than
most of the other school systems in, in the state.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Um, up here now, we're finding that more and more parents of, are pulling
their children out of the school systems and they are tutoring them at home.

B.42:  Really.

A.43:  Yeah, I work with, uh, a couple of the people that I work with, you know,
share the same office, are doing that, they've pulled their children out, and
they get a much rounder education.  And why that is, I don't know, I think
it's too much administration at the top.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Also, I don't know the level of the teachers today, are they dedicated like
they used to be years ago or is it just a --

B.46:  I don't think they are.

A.47:  -- it's just a job so they can get the summers off and,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  How about college?

B.50:  I'm very disappointed with professors at college.  They're only required to
be in their office five hours out of the entire week.  Some of them only have
two or three classes, and at the most they probably spend five hours in their
classes and five hours that they're required to be in their office.  That's
ten hours a week.  They're probably making more, I know they're making more
than my father, and he, you know, he's making like forty-five thousand --

A.51:  Um.

B.52:  -- and a lot of them have like other part, like I know a lot of the
business majors and computer professors, they have other jobs.  Like some of
them may be accountants and they do accounting, you know, and this is just, to
me it seems like it's a hobby to them, and I don't, and I've even expressed to
some of my professors I don't think it's right, as I think they should be
spending more time, and too, they, they teach the same class year after year,
well, I know one professor, he comes up from Pittsburgh, you know, and he
hasn't changed his tests or even his, you know, presenting material in years.
You can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for
your midterm and final, and as long as you study those notes from two years
ago, you're still going to do fine in his class.

A.53:  That's incredible.  That's in-,

B.54:  And, I, I, I don't think it, I don't think it's right at all [laughter],
just like you're not even teaching any more.  You don't care, you're getting
paid whether we show up or not, I mean, uh, I just, I'm very disappointed with
the,

A.55:  So when he files his lesson plans for the year, he just, he just drags out
the old ones and just files them and --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- nobody even looks at them,

B.58:  Uh-huh,

A.59:  #(( )).#

B.60:  #yeah,# he just has the same outlines year after year.

A.61:  So, he's getting away with it, so is it, is it his fault, or is it his
boss, or the people that he has to respond to, report to.

B.62:  I, I don't know, because, you know, we fill out a student evaluation form.
Every semester you fill one out on your professors --

A.63:  #Including that,#

B.64:  -- #and I know,# me and along with other students, we, we have the same
complaints year after year, and nothing seems to be getting done, so, I don't
know if they even,

A.65:  Who does that go to though?  Who does that evaluation form,

B.66:  It's supposed to, one's supposed to go to the professor himself and, um,
another is supposed to go to like the administration.  I don't know if they're
just doing it to satisfy the students so they think that we're doing 
something, 

A.67:  [Laughter].

B.68:  or --

A.69:  That's what it sounds like.

B.70:  -- [Laughter] they're us-, really using it, but I know we complain about
the same thing year after year, you know.

A.71:  Do they, do they ever publish any results, um?

B.72:  No.

A.73:  How about the student newspaper?

B.74:  Um, what about it?

A.75:  Would it be wise to put an article in there say, you know we're doing these
evaluations and every year we're, we're making the same evaluations, but yet
the administration's not looking at the evaluations,

B.76:  Oh, well, you know, they've even done stuff like that.  Our teachers are
now telling us that these do, you know, apply, they, please fill them out
properly, you know, we are, really are using them.  They tell us that, but we
don't see any, you know.

A.77:  What do you think, uh, can be done?

B.78:  I have no clue what you mean, I don't know what else we can do.

A.79:  As far as, um, well, one other's things probably is, I don't know if it
happens down there, but every time the contracts, teachers' contracts come up,
it's just before school season starts, and they all go on strike, so they
close the schools down, until they get what they want.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  What's the matter with the, uh, students doing the same thing.  Say, Hey,
uh, we're, we want a quality education, and we're not getting it.  Let's go on
strike.  You know, then see what you're going to do.  It'll create a lot of
headlines that's for sure.

B.82:  Yeah, my high school had a walk out two years ago,
