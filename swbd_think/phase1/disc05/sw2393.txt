============================================================================

A.1:  [Child] All right.

B.2:  Well, um, we lived, I grew up in San Antonio, and I was used to the heat,
and I was used to what couldn't grow [laughter] down there, and we had a
small, um, farm house out in Castroville which is just, uh, to the west of San
Antonio --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4: -- and we {children in background} did a lot of gardening out
there, and, uh, mostly in raised beds so we could keep the, uh, soil
nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil, very hard
to, to grow, very hard to cultivate, and when we came up, here, uh, to
California, uh, we're in the Monterrey area, and it's very, uh, nice
sandy soil, rich soil, and the weather is perfect for growing just
about anything you want to grow --

A.5:  How fine.

B.6:  -- so we've been out here, well, really in the house since December, and
we've been uh, planting flowers that we could never plant,

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after, you know,
about three [child] good weeks of nice weather before the heat started --

A.9:  Um.

B.10:  -- and here they are supposed to last year around --

A.11:  Oh boy.

B.12:  -- so we have some really pretty flowers growing, and, uh, we're at the
edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch [child].

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  [Laughter] Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is
here just around us.

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  We got here at the end of about a four year drought.  We've had a whole lot
of rain.  Uh, it's been raining pretty much continually now, uh, off and on,
maybe one day of break, for about a month.  So,

A.17:  Oh really.

B.18:  Yeah, we're getting replenished, and so there is, when I first came here
everything was yellow, the grass was dead everywhere.  And now with all the
rain everything is just gorgeous, lush and green and beautiful, and I hope
that it holds out here after the summer.

A.19:  Wow.

B.20:  But, uh, that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,
and that's about the extent of what we've done, just a little bit on the
patio, and waiting for the rain to subside so we can [laughter] mow.  We,
after about a month, we finally got to mow this weekend.

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  But, um, we're just so happy to see green.  It's just so nice.  We haven't
[child] really done too much else other than that.

A.23:  Um.  Well we just moved to our first home, and we had lived in a
condominium before.  So we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties.  So
we're just learning the ropes here and, 

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  But when we moved in, um, our backyard has so many bi-, tall trees in it
that there jus-, there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  So we're, you know, going, talking to some of our friends that are
landscapers and things, and learning about different kinds of grass.  We
trying to go, grow grass, and it just seems so funny to me that, when I grew
up in Missouri, and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there.  It
just happened automatically.

B.28:  So do you have to get a shade tolerant grass?  Is that what you're,

A.29:  Yes.  We are.  We tried, we planted [child] some fescue last, um, fall --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and it's really, really pretty, and, um, [child] green, it stayed
pretty, pretty green throughout the winter, and it's pretty goo-, it's not as
thick and as nice, it doesn't look like it can withstand too much, you know.

B.32:  Oh.  Does that last through the summer, too?

A.33:  It's supposed to die off like in August, and then you replant it in
September and,

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  So, but we don't, the St. Augustine and all that supposedly was back there
just wasn't, like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the
backyard.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  And, um, so mostly, you know, we're not even to the point where we're
getting into flowers,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some
grass [laughter].

B.40:  Just get grass to grow.

A.41:  Let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be
worried about the dirt so much.  You know.

B.42:  Well, when we [child] had our house, um, out in Castroville, the problem
with ours is that the, uh, plots there are a third of an acre [/child].

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And [child] trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground
that big was expensive [laughter].

A.45:  Oh yeah.

B.46:  To water it and, uh, and eventually, well, especially when it was so bad
last year, well, I guess it was the year before now, uh, it was so hot that
year, that was the year that I think it started out a hundred in February.

A.47:  Oh no.

B.48:  Um, we were just watering all the time.  Finally what we did was we said,
we're going to have to let the back yard die.

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  It's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because,

A.51:  On its own,

B.52:  we can't really afford the front yard.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And so when we left, you know, the back yard had some, um, I think it was
[child] St. Augustine that we had.  It had held onto a small portion, but
primarily once the weeds [child] start in the back we were just, you know,
resigned to, well, the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you
plow it all under --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and put everything back on top of it again.  But, I don't know.  That's
the bad thing there, is, that we spent so much money, or you would spend so
much money trying to keep a large lawn alive.  That was the only thing I
didn't like about lawns, and we were sitting there wondering, there must be a
better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying
to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out.

A.57:  [Laughter] Yes.

B.58:  So.

A.59:  It's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful,
lush green lawn, and we never, there was no such thing as watering your lawns
--

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- in Missouri.  It just happened.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And, um, so it's been real fun here to see, there's a big market for the
nurseries and for the landscaping companies, and a [child] lot of people, um,
we live in north of Dallas.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And, um,

B.66:  Arlington area.

A.67:  Plano.

B.68:  Okay, Plano.  Uh-huh.

A.69:  Uh-huh, up north [child].  And so there's a lot of market up here since
it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and big market for, for yards, yard work.

B.72:  Yeah, I imagine [child].  So, well everybody, it seems like everyone is so
particular, especially in the Dallas area.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  There, there's so much money and everyone can afford, they have enough
leisure time to afford a nice lawn.  And, another thing I've noticed is that
the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do
have to look really nice.

A.77:  Yes, they do.  I noticed that they're really putting in small back yards,
because they have these, most of the houses have the alleys --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- that run behind, and, so that really cuts into your backyard space, and.
But we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as [talking] {man's
voice in background} right now, we're just, this is, we just moved in in
September, so we're just still at the point where we're talking about [child]
the necessity.

B.80:  Right, I know.  Oh, it's awful the first house.  Our house in Castroville
was the first one, too.  And we had no idea the expense that lawns and
gardening [laughter] would run into --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- and the time that it took, especially when you start mowing, and then
when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking, and then when it
comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water.  And the
one thing that I did notice is that people that have the underground
irrigation systems, the sprinkler systems, just, that was the way to go --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- if you could do it.  People that were building the new homes that put
those in, that was, that was the only way to go because it was just so
convenient.  They would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would
water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all.

A.85:  Um.

B.86:  And that was so nice.  But, we didn't have that luxury, so we were dragging
th-, the sprinkler around everywhere.

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  And so, I hope you can find, uh, I don't know what type of grass grows in
the real shady areas.  I remember the guy that was on the radio, um, [child]
they had a gardener, and he, I don't know, I had this one, well I've still got
the book.  It's, um, I think it's just called TEXAS GARDENING, and it talks
about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny
areas.

A.89:  Hm. We, 

B.90:  But there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant, but I don't
remember what it is.  But it's got like a boot, on the front of the book.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  It's just a real fancy decorated boot.  It's like TEXAS GARDENING.  And it
talks about, you know, different problems that your lawn can have and how to
recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening.  You know,
everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and
to, uh, how to prune.  But one of the things I do remember was when it talked
about the grass,

A.93:  Grass, 

B.94:  and there being the shade tolerant types of grass, and I think one of
them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used.

A.95:  Um.

B.96:  But I don't remem-, I don't remember if it was Raleigh and St. Augustine
or, or what.

A.97:  Or what it was.

B.98:  But I do remember they had used a blend.

A.99:  Well, we're going to have to do that because we have the shade, the trees,
this is an established and older home that we moved into, and, um, the trees
are just so tall and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so
that like even if its raining, you can [laughter] go out in our back yard and
not get wet [/laughter].

B.100:  Oh, but that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.  So you'll
be cool all year around, in the summer, that's great.

A.101:  Well, that's what we're looking forward to, and that's what they say the
payoff is but, 

B.102:  It makes the biggest difference,

A.103:  Well, we ha-,

B.104:  when you have the big old trees.  And the people that moved in next to
us, they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new
little trees.  They didn't have any shade [laughter].  They, any time they had
people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during
the day.

A.105:  Too hot, yes.

B.106:  So, oh, that's great that you have them.  Are they oaks?

A.107:  Well, there are all different kinds.

B.108:  Oh that's even better.

A.109:  There are some oaks, magnolias, and like plum trees, peach trees, there are
some big tall oak trees ...
