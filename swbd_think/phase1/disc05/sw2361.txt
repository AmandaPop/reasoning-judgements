==============================================================================

A.1:  Well, a large organization offers, uh, [smack] usually a good vacation time
and they offer, uh, holidays and medical and dental programs sometimes as well
as just the ability to takeoff, uh, personal leave or whatever you need.  And
one thing that I've found coming handy lately is juror duty, uh, being paid
for that or, or at least a full days pay plus whatever the, the local
government pays you.  It's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern
yourself with your job as it were, especially if you get on a case.

B.2:  That's true.

A.3:  So, uh,

B.4:  And you get sequestered or something, you know, half a month [laughter].

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  When you get sequestered and you're there for months. 

A.7:  Right.  That would be, uh,

B.8:  That's true.  

A.9:  a problem, of course, in my job I don't know who would do it while I'm
gone that long.  We're are desperately trying to find time to, uh, train
someone else to do it but I feel certainly, it would still be there if, if not
burying me but it will be there when I get back.  Flex times another benefit
that I, I like that T I -s been doing, uh, though officially, they just
started, uh, uh, relatively recently.  Uh, we were always given the privilege
with our supervisor that was there.  We were really small shop and there was
only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and he liked idea of having
someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to
handle second shift,

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  and so he allowed us to come in, basically, as we, as we upon wanted to
and as it worked out, two or three of us were there about six in the morning
and, uh, and later on, well, eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show
up.  And that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame.  And it really
worked out well.  And then, then, of course, they came long and sanctioned it
and actually, made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of
us starting before six thirty so.  Uh, it wasn't too much of a blow but, uh,

B.12:  [Laughter].  

A.13:  the people that we were interfacing facing didn't like that too well
[Laughter].

B.14:  Yeah, right. 

A.15:  They have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in
but, uh, it's, it's nice to have flex time.  Especially being able to take off
in the middle of the day and not hurt your pay if you come back and finish
your eight hours.  That's, that's a real benefit.  What have you found that
you like in a big organization?

B.16:  Well, as, as you say the, the, um, the benefits are the biggest part of it.
I think that today with costs are up for medical insurance and eyeglasses and
dental and all that, it is a bo-, a, a, a plus to have that, ev-, as far as
your, uh, salary goes, you know, along with it because it's not out of pocket
money and they also have good life insurance policies, good retirement
((decode)), the, um, jet funds, all that stuff.  I think, you know, the I R
A's, uh --

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  -- the profit sharing, the stock options.  There are, they offer a lot of
ways for you to save too, if you have any extra, you know, that, like the, uh,
code over the two for one type of thing.

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  Well, they match half, I guess it is. 

A.21:  Right. 

B.22:  And, um, [smack] I think that a lot of it's the personal recognition that
the company gives people if they do a good job.  Uh, the incentive, you know,
to want to do a good job.  and the, uh, [smack] M I R awards banquets and
things.  I think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people and
they're, uh, meetings, to keep you full informed.

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  You don't find that much in small companies because you can kind of
interface but when you get a big company like ours, I think it's great that
they take the time to, you know, give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's
going on.

A.25:  Right. 

B.26:  That type of thing, um, snacks, uh,

A.27:  Do you, 

B.28:  we interface kind of like, uh, on the tip teams and things, I think
that's a good deal.

A.29:  Right. 

B.30:  It gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the
organization and that you're heard.  And, you know, if you have ideas that
type of thing.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Do you find that your vacation time, do you manage to use it up or
do you end up in to the,

B.32:  Oh, 

A.33:  must use? 

B.34:  I use it up [laughter]. 

A.35:  Okay.  There's a number of us in our little group that end up having to
take the must used.  Five or six of us, in fact, uh, just tend not to get
around to taking it all at once and, uh, uh, by the end of the year it kind
sneaks up on us and I managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is
and, uh, I'm still doing, uh, my wife works, uh, half of, half of one day, one
day a week so,

B.36:  Do you, 

A.37:  on Thursdays,

B.38:  have a mandatory,

A.39:  Excuse me. 

B.40:  Do you have a mandatory shut down. 

A.41:  No.  We don't have, uh, we {fade out} do have (( )) vacation but in our
group it doesn't apply.  We're so busy,

B.42:  ((Oh)), 

A.43:  year round.

B.44:  ((that's why)) see,  

A.45:  Yeah. 

B.46:  you, you can, you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice.

A.47:  Right. 

B.48:  That's the, if I had to say one thing negative that would be it because I
feel like, you know, you earn your vacation time and you should be able to
take it when you want to.

A.49:  Take it when you want to, yeah. 

B.50:  But we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts
down --

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  -- you know.  And I can understand it from there point of view on the one
hand, because they have to, you know, consider the customers that their
supplying.

A.53:  Right. 

B.54:  But it makes it very hard, especially if a husband and wife work at Texas
Instruments --

A.55:  Uh-huh. 

B.56:  -- and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time, you
know, you're not in the same area --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time,
so that isn't too nice.  Uh, this year they were going to try to do something
different about that too.  They were going to try to schedule the whole site
to go down at the same time --

A.59:  Oh, boy. 

B.60:  -- to eliminate that.  And your talking about five thousand people.

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  So that's quite a feat in itself. 

A.63:  Yeah, it is.  We've got, um, if I take half a day off during the summertime
when the kids are out of school, I can manage to be home in time to, uh, take
care of the kids before the wife leaves, she works, uh, oh, it starts about
eleven or twelve o'clock, at a dentist office and works until seven thirty or
eight.

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  That's just one late night to it, to clean teeth as it were and he had a
hard time finding someone that was willing to work that, that, that seldom and
in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the busy while the kids
were growing up as they were.  And she worked that day and occasional
Saturdays.

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67: With the, with the vacation time even if I takeoff the ten or
twelve times, uh, a Thursday during the summer, I still don't eat up
all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then
having a day or two left over on top of that so.

B.68:  Well, that's great. 

A.69:  It's, it's kind of nice to be able to do both and, uh, I'll probably be
doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by
themselves.

B.70:  Yeah, really.  That's excellent. 

A.71:  So, yeah.  It's nice to have these little, little benefits that I know
wouldn't, uh, wouldn't happen in a real small company.  Several of my friends
have left, uh, the metroplex is just full of little companies, and they've
left T I to go to a little company and ended up, you know, even though they
started with some vacation time, uh, it just did, they had to schedule it
around when they could get away and it just wasn't as convenient as being able
to say, well, tomorrow I think I will, you know.

B.72:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.73: And, uh, then they don't have quite the job security, although, you know,
now there's a lot of people getting cut but still, but by enlarge the majority
of people that are still there, even in the defense industry, uh --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- if the job has got something, you know, something worth doing as far as
the contract goes if there is a contract then you're pretty secure on that
contract.

B.76:  Yeah.  Well, they're doing a lot with, um, automation specialist also.
That's what I do.  Uh, where you have to go to school --

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- to, or run the new automated equipment.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  It's all computerized and, and stuff.  And, uh, there's a lot of job
security in that because it takes so long to come up to an experience level,

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  where you're able to, you know, you have to be able to maintain them do
the maintenance, uh, diagnose what's wrong with the machine and, you know, do
whatever it takes to get it started again and things.  And interface with the
technicians in the toolroom.  So you're kind of like your own boss as far as
the machinery goes.  And, uh, it's about a two year to three year experience
before you're able to really, um, I would say payback.

A.83:  Right. 

B.84:  You know, and do the job well. 

A.85:  Well, that's,

B.86:  And you're, 

A.87:  good.  

B.88:  still learning after all that time, 

A.89:  Yeah.  It's good that you can,

B.90:  because they're very complex machines. 

A.91:  pick up something that adds to both your, your security and your
knowledge base [laughter].

B.92:  Exactly.  That's right. 

A.93:  You're getting two things at once there. 

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  Well,

B.96:  And they offer, um, a lot of, uh, opportunity to go to school.

A.97:  Uh-huh. 

B.98:  That's another good benefit that T I has and they'll pay for ninety percent
of your schooling --

A.99:  Right. 

B.100:  -- with no commitment to them.

A.101:  Right. 

B.102:  You know, like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to
sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years or, uh, to that affect.

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  And you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you
could take advantage of it.  You can't if you're, you know, signed in a
contract.

A.105:  Uh-huh. 

B.106:  Whereas, at T I they don't do that. 

A.107:  Yeah.  I've, I've looked at several, uh, courses as it were, the only
problem that we have is things that are specifically on our job, uh, that, the
courses that apply to our job other than the real basics, like just the math
and the physics and the like.  All of them are taught at colleges that are
very remote.  In other words, there,

B.108:  Oh.  

A.109:  like there's one in Washington D C,

B.110:  Oh.  

A.111:  and there's one in Oregon. 

B.112:  Oh.

A.113:  And they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training
but just keeping up on the basics, I guess, are things,

B.114:  Yeah.  

A.115:  that we could continue do but, um,

B.116:  Well, this part of the country there's no shortage of, uh, good schools.

A.117:  Well, we have, we have lots of,

B.118:  You, know like M I T and, and, uh, Boston's only an hours drive from here.

A.119:  Right.

B.120:  So a lot of the, the people can go, you know, to a good school.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  And right in Rhode Island there must be some nice colleges too, Rhode
Island (( )).

A.123:  We lots of schools they just, only, only one in the entire area offers a
course in what's called ...
