===========================================================================

A.1:  Hi. 

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  Me, I'm in favor of it.

B.4:  You are.

A.5:  Yeah.  I thought, I think if, uh, people like Charles Manson.

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  The, the heinous crimes, uh, even if it's one time offense.

B.8:  Yeah, the, the, I mean, people like that are [child_talking] crazy.  I did
a study on it, though.  When I was in high school, it was one of these things,
we had to pick a topic to, to investigate.  And at that time, I don't think
it's like that any more, but at that time, uh, it was very unfair.  Capital
punishment was a lot more [noise] common, and if you ten-, and it tended to be
that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black, or
any minority for that matter, the chances, your chances of, of, uh, getting
the death penalty were, you know, like hundreds of times greater than if you
could just communicate well.  I mean, you didn't have to be, um, you didn't
even necessarily have to be white, but if you could just communicate and you
could come across in the court room with some kind of, um, you know, sense
about you, then, even if you did the exact same crime, chances are, you
wouldn't get, you'd get life instead of the death penalty, as opposed to
somebody who couldn't communicate well.  And, at that time, it just seemed so
unfair, that, um, I, I felt like I couldn't, uh, um, that I just didn't agree
with it.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  It's gotten so, though, that there are so many, you know, there are so
many, uh, I don't know what you call it.  Uh, so many different things that
you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty, that I'm
not so sure it, it seems a lot fairer than it used to be [laughter].

A.11:  Yeah, well, I know, that, um, like they can hold it off for years --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- by, uh, I'm trying to think of the word that you were, retrials --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- and, um, I'm for-, I cannot think of that word.

B.16:  Right, I know what you're saying.  Um, but, yeah, they, there's, you know,
there's always, uh, uh, you know, and, and in a way, you know, I guess that's
good.  I mean, if you're going to, [laughter] if you're going to kill
somebody,

A.17:  You have to make sure they're guilty.

B.18:  Right, yeah.  You know, give them, give them, I mean, you should give
somebody every, every chance even, even if it seems obvious.  Um, I don't know
what the, what the law is like in Texas.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  I mean, [child_talking] I certainly haven't heard anyth-, any, anything
about somebody being executed or anything.

A.21:  Well, I think it's all, [/child_talking] uh, I don't think they have, uh,
execution here [child_talking].

B.22:  I don't, I don't either.  

A.23:  I do know (( )) it's easy to get put in jail for life.

B.24:  Yeah, well, you know, the, um, there was something on T V last night about
how one state, what, there was a newspaper in, no, it was a #T V station.#

A.25:  #T V station.#

B.26:  Yo-, did you see that?

A.27:  Yeah, he's, they're wanting to record a gas chamber.

B.28:  I thought that was disgusting.  I mean.

A.29:  Well, it might scare some people off of doing the crimes.

B.30:  Well, 

A.31:  You know,

B.32:  yeah, but, you know, there, there are so many people who just get, get
their jollies off of watching that.

A.33:  Yeah, I, yeah, I agree with you there, too.

B.34:  And that's what, that's what really bothers me.  You know, I'm all for
deterrents, but I, I think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it
into a circus.

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  And,

A.37:  Well, I'll agree with you there.  I don't agree with them showing it on
television --

B.38:  No.

A.39:  -- hard telling who would see it --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- but I, I do think that it would scare some people from doing thi-, --

B.42:  Sure.

A.43:  -- you know they'll think about this and say, Hey, I don't think so.

B.44:  Well, where I could see it being very useful is for, you know, if there's a
first time offender, part of his punishment is that he's got [laughter] to see
what, you know, what he's up against --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- you know, what, what, you know, what might happen.  But, th-, you know,
for T V sta-, you know, that T V station isn't going to want to restrict how
they use it.  And they're going to show it on the six o'-, well, probably not
the six o'clock news, but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock, eleven
o'clock news.  And I don't, you know, I've got a ten year old, and, you know,
she's, she could very well be up at that time --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- you know, when we're, and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten
year old.

A.49:  Yeah that's,

B.50:  I'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old [laughter].

A.51:  I don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody.  

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  I know I wouldn't be able to watch it.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  And I'm, I'm supposed to be an adult.

B.56:  Right.  And in fact, I think it'd be harmful if my, if, you know, my
daughter or my, any of my kids saw it.  So, that has to be brought into the
picture, too.  You know, you just can't blatantly say, Let's, let's show it
and, and the, the right people will see it, and it'll deter them from
committing a crime.  All, lot of the wrong people are going to see it, too.
And, uh,

A.57:  Yeah, well, there's more wrong people that would see it than right 
people --

B.58:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.59:  -- you know, uh.

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  But I, I, I don't know, I think I would [noise] say that if they put it
where those first time offenders of, uh, your sex crimes and murderers, uh,
show them what would happen.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  Now, my aunt had a thing when I was younger, and, you know I was working
with her, and she would say that they should, uh, for men who did sex crimes,
they should take off a piece of his body --

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  -- and the most important part to a man and,

B.66:  Yeah, my wife says that all the time [laughter].

A.67:  inch by inch [laughter].

B.68:  Yeah, well that, that would certainly do it [laughter].

A.69:  That would stop them from wanting to, no, Well, I thought it was funny
listening to her.  She's just a, she's,

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:   she's a little bit, uh, dingy when it comes to things,

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  but well, she's vicious.

B.74:  Yeah, well, you know, I, I think that if, if I felt like the, the system
was, was truly fair and, and, uh, and that they would never make a mistake
[laughter] then, you know.  But you hear, you know, you hear about people who
are, who are [child_talking] genuinely, mistakenly accused of a crime.

A.75:  Yeah, like that Lionel something or another, that black boy, of, they had a
television program about him, two hour movie.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  Can't think of his name.

B.78:  I can't, I can't think eith-,

A.79:  But he spent quite a few --

B.80:  Yeah.  Right.

A.81:  -- quite a while in jail.

B.82:  That's right, and, and it turns out he didn't do it.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  Or, you know, and, and it's easy, you know, and, and, you know, let's face
it, not all policemen are honest and,

A.85:  Well you see that on television also.

B.86:  That's right.  And, and, you know, they can, they'll take somebody who
maybe is mentally retarded and then, it's, and they're under pressure to, to
solve a crime, and some, and the circumstances, uh, may be molded to blame
somebody who didn't do it, and especially if it's, you know, somebody who's
mentally retarded, who can't defend themselves very well.  And I'd hate to see
them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them.

A.87:  Yeah, that's a problem with capital punishment, though.  Bu-, when you got
people that, you know, uh, for some reason or another, Charles Manson sticks
in my brain.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah, well he was a,

A.89:  I seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out, how many
people he was going to kill.

B.90:  Yeah, sheesh.

A.91:  And uh, that's a man that should be put to death.

B.92:  And, uh, it, it, it just doesn't seem right that our tax money, or
somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  You know, he gets three meals a day, and, and he probably,

A.95:  That's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest.

B.96:  Right, right, that's right, and he's probably living a lot better than some
people who deserve a lot more, and, uh, that does, you know, that does sort
of, you know, but how, you know, it's just so hard [laughter] it's just so
hard to, to be fair and, uh, yeah, I guess I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind if all
of a sudden he didn't exist any more.

A.97:  I, uh, I don't think anyone would miss him, either.

B.98:  No, no.  Uh, I, you know, I, I think the same thing about people like
Saddam Hussein,

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  you know, you know.  Jeez, you know, they're just, they're just the scum of
the earth, and uh, I just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support
somebody like that.

A.101:  Well, as you can tell, my two decided to come in here.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  Uh, what,

B.104:  Now where, where, where area, where are you from?

A.105:  I'm in Denison.

B.106:  Denison, oh, okay.  Every so often you get somebody who's in, in, uh,
California or, or New York.

A.107:  Yeah, I got some guy from San Francisco one night.

B.108:  Yeah, yeah.

A.109:  No, you is talking about Saddam Hussein.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  I think it would be wrong for us to kill him, for the Americans to kill
him.

B.112:  I think you're right.  I don't think we're, I think we're, we'd, we'd
overstep our bounds if we went in and did that --

A.113:  I think the,

B.114:  -- though it's awfully tempting.

A.115:  Now if one of the Kurds, I'm sure you know who they are.

B.116:  Yep.

A.117:  If they went in and got him, he wouldn't be a martyr, what's the word,
martyr?

B.118:  Martyr.

A.119:  Martyr, yeah, I could see the word in my head, I just couldn't pronounce
it.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  Uh, but if we did it, oh, man --

B.122:  Oh, yeah, the whole,

A.123:  -- they'd have him on a pedestal.

B.124:  Well, right now, we're in a delicate situation because we've got this, we-,
for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries.

A.125:  Yeah, that's what my husband keeps telling me.  See how, you know, um, I'm
just now getting into the world politics and all that.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  I guess I just too young to understand this or something.  

B.128:  Oh, sure.

A.129:  But, uh,

B.130:  It's complicated.

A.131:  Well, it's getting easier to understand.  You know, of course my husband,
he was in the Navy for ten years --

B.132:  Oh.

A.133:  -- so, uh, when it comes to the military, he kind of knows what he's
talking about.

B.134:  Right.

A.135:  I don't put every-, a hundred percent stock into what he says,

B.136:  [Laughter].

A.137:  but I listen [laughter] --

B.138:  Right,

A.139:  -- and agree with what I think sounds right.

B.140:  Right [laughter].  Yeah, there, and, you know, he's got that delicate
balance right there, and we'd just be overstepping our bounds, I think, if we
walked in and sort of took over.

A.141:  Yeah, well, I think they, uh, the people there will take care of him now.

B.142:  Yeah, I just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer, you know,
if, if they had, you know, if they could do something about it.  I mean, his
own army is going to eventually turn on him because and, and, you se-, this
has happened before in history, you know, that it just gets to a certain point
where you're just not willing,
