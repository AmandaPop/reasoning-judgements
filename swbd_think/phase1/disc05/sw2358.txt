===========================================================================

A.1:  (( )).

B.2:  Okay, I don't know about you but I hate to do yard work and I pay somebody
to do all of my yard work.

A.3:  (( )).

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  [Laughter] Really I like it.

B.6:  Do you? 

A.7:  I like, um, um, working with flowers and stuff like that.

B.8:  Oh, well, I, I, (( )) I don't mind doing like gardening or just stuff like
that, but I'm just, regular cutting the grass.

A.9:  Oh, just mowing the yard. 

B.10:  I always told my dad when I was a kid, and he made me do it, I said, I
can't wait until I'm old enough so I don't have to do this anymore.

A.11:  [Laughter] That's probably why you hate it so much.  

B.12:  Because I always had to do it, and so I just pay someone else to do it, and
they do the, they do the cutting, they fertilize, they, um, edge and, um, I
think this year I'm going to have some landscaping put in.

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  So, I don't know, I don't, I'm single, and so I don't know, I don't, if I
had a, a man around to do it, it might be different.  I don't know.

A.15:  I kind of enjoy working out in the yard. 

B.16:  Pardon me? 

A.17:  I enjoy working out in the yard,

B.18:  Do you? 

A.19:  I mean, in the summertime it's hard here because it gets so hot.

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  You have to like get up at six in the morning if you're going to mow the
yard and not faint while your doing it.

B.22:  [Laughter] Do you cut the grass and stuff? 

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  Do you live by yourself?

A.25:  No, no.  I'm married. 

B.26:  But you still do it anyway?  [laughter].

A.27:  Well, we both do.

B.28:  You both do it.

A.29:  Sometimes.

B.30:  That's nice.  Do you have, um, a lot of flowers and stuff? 

A.31:  Well, we're, we're moving to a new house, and so, we'll have to get started
over there --

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  -- decide what we're going to plant and everything.  At the old house we
had a lot of roses.

B.34:  Those are pretty.  I used to have a house that had a really, it was really
well landscaped and I enjoyed the flowers and the, and the trees the things.
This house doesn't have very much.  It has some trees, but, um, the people who
lived here before didn't put in anything --

A.35:  Yeah. 

B.36:  -- in the way of shrubs or flowers but I'm going to have that done, have
that done this year because I do enjoy looking at it, I just, I'm not, I don't
tolerate the heat well.

A.37:  [Laughter] It does get really hot here.

B.38:  I much prefer to say in the house in my air conditioning and look at it
without working in it.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  Although I have, I did try one year, um, out here in Dallas, I used to live
in San Antonio and I did try grow-, having a garden where I grew tomatoes and
vegetables, different vegetables --

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  -- and that was kind of fun -- 

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  -- to get out and work. 

A.45:  We tried that last year and, but we hadn't lived here in Dallas for, you
know, long enough to, to remember that you have to do, like, um, I have this
sister who lives in Florida, and she plants her garden in January.

B.46:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.47:  Harvest in May. 

B.48:  Uh-huh. 

A.49:  Plant again in, um, late September.

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  And then harvest like in December.  Yeah, that's right, because the
summertime you just can't grow anything, and we tried to plant in like end of
March or April and everything just toasted I mean it just ...

B.52:  Isn't that when, when, I thought that was when you were supposed to plant.

A.53:  Oh, here it gets so hot, 

B.54:  When, when are you supposed to plant? 

A.55:  I mean, this stuff just burns to a crisp.  What? 

B.56:  When are you supposed to plant then?

A.57:  Probably late January. 

B.58:  Really.

A.59:  Why, what are you, just as soon as it stops freezing.

B.60:  Um, I didn't realize that. 

A.61:  Because, you know, I mean, last summer the only way you could keep
something, keep a, keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day
long every day.

B.62:  Yeah, yeah. 

A.63:  Because it would just, it would just burn to a crisp.

B.64:  It does eat up the, um, eats up your water bill, I know that. 

A.65:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

B.66:  But, um, I don't know, I've, I, I just prefer having someone else do it, to
me, um, you know, I'd rather spend my time doing other things.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 

B.68:  And I know my dad always enjoyed it.  He loved to work in the yard.

A.69:  Why did he make you do it?

B.70:  He made us do the grunt work. 

A.71:  [Laughter] Well, so, okay, you need to get married and have kids and then
when they're big enough you can have them --

B.72:  That's  what he, I can't tell you how many times I heard that.

A.73:  -- go do the yard, and you can do what you want to do.

B.74:  My son only five so he's not old enough yet to send out to the, do the yard
work.

A.75:  [Laughter] No, but he will be.

B.76:  In about five more years maybe. 

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  But, um, I don't know, it's, it's interesting.  I don't, I don't know, part
of the reason, I think, is that I don't know anything about it.  When I had my
other house and it was already landscaped and I, you know, I didn't know what
to do and how to take care of the things and, you know, I learned a little
bit.

A.79:  Yeah. 

B.80:  But, um, I heard ros-, I heard that roses are really difficult to grow and,

A.81:  Why?

B.82:  They really take a lot of ...

A.83:  I didn't seem to have that experience, I mean, they were already there
but we just fed them and watered them.

B.84:  You, did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that?

A.85:  No. 

B.86:  That's good.  Have you, have you ever grown any vegetables? 

A.87:  Oh, well, like I said, we tried last year,

B.88:  Tomatoes? 

A.89:  but we didn't do it right. 

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  And it's going to be too late this year by the time we get moved,

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  so, we'll probably wait and maybe in the fall, we might plant a fall
garden this year,

B.94:  It's an interesting,

A.95:  but we're not going to try to do anything during the summertime because
it is just too hot.

B.96:  I think it's an interesting, you know, it's an interesting hobby if, um,
you know, to have I just have never taken the time to learn --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- to learn very much about it, and, you know, but, like I said, I don't
tolerate the heat and the ...

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  Some of it's fun, but cutting the grass, and I just don't enjoy that.

A.101:  Yeah, that's what I said, you know, sometime, during the summertime you've
got to get up at six in the morning to do it before, you know, before it gets
hot, and one time last year I remember we were planning on doing that and it
was eighty degrees even then.

B.102:  At six, yeah.

A.103:  Oh, it was just awful,

B.104:  Yeah, I know. 

A.105:  and so humid. 

B.106:  Have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet, cutting it and
stuff?

A.107:  Oh, no, because were fixing to move.

B.108:  I just had mine done for the first time last week.

A.109:  Really [laughter].

B.110:  Yeah, so it's getting to be, I usually have it done about every other week.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  And I don't know, now it's not growing real fast.

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  It will pick up.

A.115:  Oh, yeah. 

B.116:  It's just getting green.

A.117:  Uh-huh. 

B.118:  I prefer to see green than brown. 

A.119:  [Laughter].

B.120:  But, um, well, it was nice talking to you. 

A.121:  Nice talking to you too. 

B.122:  And good luck on your moving --

A.123:  Thanks. 

B.124:  -- and your garden.

A.125:  Oh, thanks.

B.126:  Bye-bye.

A.127:  Bye-bye.
