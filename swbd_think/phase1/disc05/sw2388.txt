REMARKS:  	There was some electronic trouble in this conversation
which I attribute to B's telephone connection.

===========================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, well, uh, so what do you think about golfing?  Are you a spectator,
or a player?

B.2:  Oh, I'm definitely a player.  I guess, uh, there is some question about
that when I total up the score but,

A.3:  [Laughter] Yeah, I know how you feel about that, that's true
[throat_clearing].  What's, what's, uh, what's the best part of your game, do
you think?

B.4:  Oh, I like to, uh, I think putting is probably my, uh, forte.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  What is your worst, then?  [Laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter] I guess I have the most trouble with chipping.  How about you?
[Throat_clearing].

A.7:  Well, I think, I think my best part actually is chipping, or at least it
was last year.  I haven't been out this year.  It's kind of been, uh, kind of
strange.  I hadn't been able to get out yet, but, uh, my biggest problem is
staying in the fairway [laughter] for, you know, with drives and stuff.

B.8:  Yeah, I used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slide and so
forth.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  But I think I've overcome a good deal of that.

A.11:  Yeah, I've, I've gone in the past years from, uh, having a wicked slice to
having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice, I mean,

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  it's just, uh, and I can't seem to find the middle space, you know, but
I've got a friend of mine working on it, uh, I've trying to help me out.  I've
been going to the driving range with him, and, and it seems to be doing some,
um,

B.14:  Yeah [noise], I've always threatened to take lessons, but I've never gotten
around to it.

A.15:  Yeah, well, lessons are, are okay if you do it right, I think.  I did, I
took some lessons, uh, a couple of years back, but to tell you the truth that
for a while hurt more than it helped because, I, it turned out that I couldn't
do anything right after that.

B.16:  Oh, really?

A.17:  And even, you know, like I said, my chipping, which is one of the best
things in my game, I couldn't do that, I couldn't, couldn't drive, couldn't,
you know, in fact it was, it wasn't as much at that point that I was hooking
and slicing, I just, I was topping the ball, I was, you know, I was doing a
lot of things wrong at that point, but I was trying to think of so many
different things at the same time, because, you know, it was [laughter] it's
kind of a funny story whenever I went for my first lesson.  The, uh, the
instructor takes me out there and he says, all right, well, take a swing and
let me see how you look, so he's bending down on one knee, right, so I take a
swing, and, and all of a sudden his head just goes down, and, and, then all of
a, you know, he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me, and he
says, we've got a lot of work to do [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  Built that confidence right up there, huh?

A.21:  Oh, yeah, I was feeling real good then, so he broke me down from, I mean he
started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything I
did, and, uh, uh,

B.22:  That can be bad.  I mean, you know, a lot of people say [noise] it's best
to take your lessons right at the beginning --

A.23:  Oh, yeah.

B.24:  -- before you learn the bad habits, I guess.

A.25:  Oh, that's definitely true.  In fact, if, if I ever, you know, have a son
or anything, I'm definitely going to [noise] {in background} you know, teach
him, have a lesson or something.  Is that yours, or mine?

B.26:  I think that's mine.  Let me just quick catch it and I'll be back.

A.27:  All right.

B.28:  [Noise] I'm back [noise].

A.29:  Okay.

B.30:  Yeah, they, uh, they, uh, my, uh, I have an interesting anecdote.

A.31:  What's that?

B.32:  My, uh, my, uh, son who goes up to A and M, he's had the pleasure of having
a hole in one.

A.33:  Oh, yeah?

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  You know, the only person I've ever known that had a hole in one was my
brother-in-law, but, uh, and he, he said he got his luckily, so I don't know.
But I mean,

B.36:  Yeah, well, I guess [noise] {in the background} there's a certain amount of
luck in any hole in one.

A.37:  I came so close once, just once.  I mean that's the only time I've ever
been any, anywhere near, but I mean I, it was, I used to live out in Midland,
Texas.  I don't know if you've ever been out there, but it's, you know, a real
windy place.

B.38:  Oh, thank God I've never been to Midland.

A.39:  [Laughter] But I played on a course out there, and like I said, it's a
very windy place, so it's, you know, the wind was blowing, and it was cold,
and it was like, it was about a hundred and, I don't know, a hundred and
seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three, and I, you know, the wind was
right in my face, so I just pulled out a seven wood, right, and I put that
thing, I mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off,
you know, over, over past the hole, but I mean that's as close as I've ever
been.

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  You know, because I'm not, you know {recording faded away} that's one of my
problems, is controlling my, my, my irons on a par three, so I have a lot of
trouble hitting the greens.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  So do you like watching it, though?

B.44:  Well, one of my, control and contact [noise] is a big problem, and they
still are.  One of the things I was doing wrong was too much back swing and
hurrying my back swing.

A.45:  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's exactly what my friend has, has figured out
that I do is my, I can actually see the club on my backswing.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  And he says that what I do is I'm actually crossing the plain, is what,
this is his words, his technical words for it, crossing --

B.48:  That sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me.

A.49:  -- because, because I ended up into an inverted C where the weight was on
the wrong foot or something.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  So I, I've found that I actually do, uh, I get a lot, uh, better control
and distance if I don't, you know, don't take as big a back swing.

B.52:  Yeah, if I can convince myself not to try and kill it, I sure, you always
get a lot better results.

A.53:  Yeah.  What's funny is the idea that, uh, you know, what I consider, you
know, like a three-quarter backswing, or even a half backswing, my friend says
that's, you know, that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further
than that, so I mean it's a, now it's a matter of trying to convince myself
that that's right [laughter].

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  So I don't know.  It's going to be interesting.

B.56:  You have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times.

A.57:  That's probably true.

B.58:  It's a frustrating game, golf.

A.59:  Oh, isn't it, though.  I don't know why I do it [laughter].

B.60:  It's getting more expensive, unfortunately too.

A.61:  Oh, that's, that's one of the worse things about it, it really is, but, 
uh,

B.62:  Like you, I haven't played any or not much this year.  I played a couple of
times, but --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- I went skiing in February and took a little tumble down the slopes, and
so I'm nursing a wounded wing right now.

A.65:  You know, that's it, you have to be healthy too, that's another point, I
guess.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  Well, I think that's about it.

B.68:  Yeah.  Well, I love the game.

A.69:  Yeah, I do too.

B.70:  So I enjoyed talking about it.

A.71:  Yeah.  Well, you take care.

B.72:  Okay, I enjoyed it.

A.73:  Yeah, good luck.

B.74:  Bye-bye.

A.75:  Bye.
