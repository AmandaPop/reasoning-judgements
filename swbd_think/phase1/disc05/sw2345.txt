========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I think the crime in Dallas is horrendous.

B.2:  Co-, compared to what?

A.3:  Compared now to when I came here twenty years ago.  When I came here twenty
years ago, it was not near as bad as it is now.  It's terrible now.  My house
has already been broken into once, and there was an attempt a se-, another
time.  I mean, I can't, it's horrible, I'm afraid.

B.4:  Do you live in, do you live near downtown?

A.5:  No, I live, well, I live in Oak Cliff.  But, uh, uh, uh, we never had any
problem here before.  We really did not in my neighborhood.  We're not wealthy
at all.  You know, we don't have a rich neighborhood, and when they break into
our houses they don't get anything, much, they get a little jewelry and maybe,
you know, a V C R, and it just irritates me to no end that somebody has broken
into my house and stolen my things.  You know just,

B.6:  Um.  Well, I live, I, I live in northwest Garland.  Actually about a mile
south of one ninety.  So, we're really quite far north.  And the house, we
just moved into a house that has lots of windows, and I, course I have a
Dallas policeman that lives right behind me, so, [laughter] I don't know if
that'll do any good.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Uh, it's, it's interesting, though, that you've been broken into.  You
must, you must look at this whole mess a lot different.  Did you see today,
that they, the, the police commanders got a pay raise and the regular folks
didn't.

A.9:  No, I, I hadn't heard that.  

B.10:  It was just on the news, I was just watching a little of it just before you
called.  And they cu-, and, they cutback on overtime, and they have to take
electric clocks home, and you wonder what that does to fighting crime.  If
they had an electric clock on their desk, they were supposed to take it home
to save energy.

A.11:  Are you serious?

B.12:  [Laughter] I'm serious (( )).

A.13:  [Laughter] That is the ci-,

B.14:  Doug Clark's on channel eight.  

A.15:  That sounds like the city.  I worked for the City of Dallas for a while,
and I do know that they're, they can be really strange.

B.16:  What, what, what do you think, wh-, why people breaking into your house?

A.17:  Drugs.  They want See they take what they do, they break in and they take
your jewelry and they take it and they sell it, they hock it, and then they
buy drugs.  I really think it's drugs.  They want the money for the drugs.

B.18:  Um.

A.19:  I think drugs is the root of it.

B.20:  What time of day are they breaking in?

A.21:  Well, I used to work second shift, and when they broke in, I was working at
night.  I work in payroll now, and I work days.  But uh, they broke in, they
knew my hours.  The police told me evidently they were watching me.  And they
know your hours.  See, that's what so spooky about it.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And they broke in at night.  And, since then, I've put in a security light,
and I've marked everything I, you know, that I have, I've put my driver's
license number on it.  Ugly too.  I mean, where it could be seen.  Because I
don't care, I just don't want them to get it and hock it again.

B.24:  Well, are you, uh, you said you're not in a, in a rich neighborhood, but
are there, are there obviously, um, drug people in the area?

A.25:  No, not right here.  I've, I have never even seen like, uh, what they call
a crack house or anything.  I wouldn't, no there's nothing like that here that
I know of.  Now I'm sure there are somewhere in Oak Cliff, but I've never seen
it.  We're not in a bad area, you know.  I,

B.26:  Do you think they just kind of hit your house at random, or were they going
down the street?

A.27:  Yes, they've hit my next door neighbor.  They hit the guy about two or
three houses down.  So they've hit several houses in the neighborhood, one of
them twice.

B.28:  Okay, so they're really just looking for --

A.29:  They're just looking.

B.30:  -- a nice enough house to find something to steal.

A.31:  Just something, they kicked my door in, they literal-, I had a solid wooden
door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it, and
kicked it in, molding and all.

B.32:  Oh that's scary, because --

A.33:  That's real scary.

B.34:  -- every feels you're supposed to have dead bolts.

A.35:  I have a, and I, my insurance paid to have the contractor come out, and we
put in another solid door and another dead bolt, but it doesn't hold it.

B.36:  Well, my, the front door on the house I have has, uh, glass in it.

A.37:  So does mine now.  This one does have glass in it.

B.38:  Well, I wonder, you know, you know, it's, I don't know, this is tough, but
I guess the issue is, is, if it's drug people, what's the solution.

A.39:  [Breathing] Uh, I don't think there is a solution.  I, I really, I really
don't know, I really do-, and you know the police told me, to get a gun, and
if they, if you're here and they try breaking in, shoot them.  Now I have
never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before.

B.40:  Well, that,

A.41:  But that tells you how bad the situation is.  That tells you how bad it is,
and there aren't enough police, and they, they didn't get here until six the
next morning.  I got home at eleven, called the police immediately --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- several times.  My neighbors came over immediately.  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  We didn't even know if they were still in the house.  My neighbor went
through looking.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  They advised on the phone that we'll have somebody go through and look.
Now that's terrible, and the police did not get here until seven hours later.

B.48:  Well, that, that's real scary.

A.49:  That's darn scary.

B.50:  But is the, is the solution, uh, cutting off drug supply?

A.51:  [Breathing] If it's possible, I guess.  

B.52:  Or is it,

A.53:  Or is the solution legalizing,

B.54:  Do you see that these people, you know, are they going to, if you cut
supply it's going to raise the price.  Or if you, uh,

A.55:  If you legalize it.  Well, you couldn't legalize everything, okay, I just
don't see that you could.  But, if you legalized marijuana, and then, uh,
taxed it and everything, then everybody would come out okay, I think, on that
deal.

B.56:  Well, how expensive is, um, how expensive is marijuana? It's not very
expensive.

A.57:  I don't even know, I really don't know.

B.58:  But, um, the people that are, I'd be curious to, if the people that are,
wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably --

A.59:  Hard drug users,

B.60:  -- are probably crack, that have got a pretty high, because I would think a
hundred dollars worth of marijuana, I don't know what it costs, but I should
think that would be more than, a lot more than just ordinary recreation.  It
would be interesting to see if, to, the problem is, is, is, what do you lock
them up for.  You know.

A.61:  And then, the thing is, keeping them locked up.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  You know, they pick them up, they lock them up, and then they let them go.

B.64:  But they don't have enough proof against them.

A.65:  They don't have anything to keep --

B.66:  And then we got to,

A.67:  -- and you never get your stuff back, you never get your stuff back.

B.68:  Well we had, interesting enough, we had a, long before we moved we had
some, couple little kids came by and stole our drill and our saw, and I had
them marked, and uh, we called the police, about a week later the guy caught
these kids riding a, um a motor scooter, or a go-, it was a go-cart in the
alley, and he got to talking to the kids, and we recovered the drill and the
saw, but, uh, it, it's one of those, you know, it was not, not a real
expensive neighborhood.  Uh, but it's, it's interesting that, the motivation,
and.  The question is what's the motivation not to steal.  And I guess that's
what bothers.  It's like the criminal, you know, if somebody says, well, let's
lock him up for life.  Well, how should he, you know, what bothers me is the
incentive that he's, if you, if you know you're going to be in there for life,
why should you be good.  But if you, if you say, I'm not going to let you out
until you have a skill, and we think you're reformed, well that's not how they
do it.  They let them out when there time is served.

A.69:  That's right.

B.70:  I, I guess, the problem is, is, is what it would to do that would be more
money than we, it's like the school issue, and which I guess we're not
supposed to, but anyway, the idea of how much money would it take to reform
these criminals and lock them all up.

A.71:  And they think these are probably teenagers, older teenagers that have been
doing this around here.

B.72:  Um.

A.73:  They, they weren't real profe-, well, we don't know for sure, but the hit
they took, they knew right where to go.  That's what scares me.

B.74:  In your,

A.75:  They went right to my jewelry.  They did not ransack my house.  They went
right to my jewelry box, and I had a ring that had my diamonds in it and my
grandmother's diamonds in it, that I had made, and it was worth close to two
thousand dollars.

B.76:  Oh, my.

A.77:  They, and they, I mean, they had pay dirt when they saw that, I mean.  And
I, I worked in the shop then at T I, you, you know, with machinery, and I
couldn't wear my jewelry.  I can wear it now, I wear everything.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  I don't leave anything home.  I wear everything [laughter].

B.80:  Everything (( )).

A.81:  You bet [laughter].  But, uh, they got that and a diamond necklace and
stuff, so they really hit pay dirt, and then they grabbed my V C R also, but,
they didn't just tear it out.  They very carefully unhooked everything, laid
everything out, you know, I mean, it was just unbelievable.

B.82:  Well, did they, did you take your T V?

A.83:  No, they left two T V -s, and one was small, they could have easily carried
it.  But the police said they must have been on foot, it looked like they were
on foot.  They left my silver.  My silver was sitting here in a chest.

B.84:  Yeah, but who buys silver any more?

A.85:  Well, I did [laughter].

B.86:  Well, yeah, but have you bought a place setting recen-, I have a niece
that's getting married, and, uh, she's not even, um, selecting a silver
pattern, because it's, I've forgotten what my wife was telling me what, the
cost is just incredible to, you know, a place setting is, is, I don't know,
two or three hundred dollars or something.  I mean, your silver probably is
worth a lot, but, uh, what are they going to do, walk down the street,

A.87:  Well, they could, they could,

B.88:  and tell everybody, would you like to buy (( )).

A.89:  Well, they hock it, see.  They take everything to the pawn shops and just
hock everything.  But, um, I don't know, they just hit the jewel-, well, I
guess if they knew their jewelry, they knew the-, but they did take some cubic
zirconiums, too.  I had a ring that, they look awfully real.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  And I did have a ring that wasn't real, and they took that, you know,

B.92:  Well, how would they know, I mean, they look pretty sophisticated.

A.93:  They just grabbed, but boy they sure hit pay dirt with that one ring.
Luckily my insurance, you know, reimbursed me, but, I can't replace those
diamonds,

B.94:  No, and, and, and, how to put a value on a ring that you had made.

A.95:  Or to have, and that had my grandmother's stones in it.  

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  You know, so.  Oh, I was sick.

B.98:  That is scary. 

A.99:  But I still haven't bought a gun.

B.100:  Well, that's the thing scares me about it is, um, who gets shot with the
gun.  They say that a large number of the homicides are people that know each
other, that uh, I've forgot what the, forty or fifty percent.  It's
surprisingly high, people that shoot each other know them.  I mean, it's not
like ...
