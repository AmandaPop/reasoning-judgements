REMARKS:        Much clicking and beeps at times.  Marked in the
conversation as well as I could.  Not sure what the cause of this
is, i. e., phone problem or in Speaker B's environment.

========================================================================

A.1:  Hi, how are you doing?

B.2:  Good [laughter].

@A.3:  Do you have, uh, drug testing where you are?

B.4:  Yes, yes we do, right here at the, at the very building, they have a
nurse's office.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I haven't, my name hasn't come up yet.  How about you?

A.7:  Uh, yeah, I have. Uh, what I've found out out of curiosity was my name has,
uh, has come up twice, and we've only been involved with the program say,
about a year.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  And, uh, when I, when I first heard about it I was very, uh, very
defensive.  I didn't think it was something that, that the companies ought to
be doing --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- because I felt that I was losing something or taking something away from
me.

B.12:  Yes, that's the, the major issue, I guess (( )).

A.13:  Yeah, but now, um, now that it's happening, I, I feel comfortable with it.
I, I don't feel as though I've lost anything, and that I feel, uh, secure in
that I know that everybody that works [lipsmack] around me, um, is, is drug
free.

B.14:  I have a, a similar opinion.  At first I wasn't sure, but then I thought it
was a good thing for the company, as well.

A.15:  #How abou-, how about the,#

B.16: # Uh, uh, we had couple of# people in our group who wro-, one who
wrote a huge letter to the editors --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- saying that it's a violation of my rights, and this and that, and the
tests aren't accurate, and, but I think they've got that testing down to a
real science, where, you know, they don't re-, you know, I'm, I'm sure you saw
the video on how they do the testing, and it's almost impossible, I think, to,
uh, to make a mistake.

A.19:  Well, I was involved in, uh, in the, in the initial training program,
because I had to go out and teach, or explain to other people [noise] what we
were doing, why we were doing it [/noise].  So, I, I guess I had a little, uh,
first hand knowledge --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- of, of, uh, seeing the films.  I had more of extensive training in, in,
uh, background information of the reasons why they were doing it, the cost
that, uh --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- uh, that we projected that it, that it actually cost companies by having
people, uh --

B.24:  Who were involved,

A.25:  -- be involved with drugs.

B.26:  Right, and that, that's a lot of money [laughter].

A.27:  Oh, yeah.

B.28:  #And,#

A.29:  #How# do you feel about oth-, other things like public, uh, safety, buses,
bus drivers, and, and, uh, airplane drivers or, or pilots, rather?  You,

B.30:  Oh, oh taking drug testing?

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  Oh, sure, I think that's, that's, I feel that, you know, for certain cases,
that I, that I am willing up to give up my rights to secure the rights of
others, I guess is what I'm saying.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Uh, when the public whole is at stake --

A.35:  Well,

B.36:  -- then I'm willing to gi-, you know, personally, I can't speak for others,
but for myself, I'm willing to say, okay, you know, uh, if I see this is a
right to, if to privacy, I'm willing to give up that right because I can see
that it's, uh, public good is at stake, and the company good is at stake, and,
you know, if they can get this thing under control, you know, it, it's going
to save us all money [noise] as far as benefits and everything else --

A.37:  Um.

B.38:  -- you know, insurance, and, and, everything else in this country.

A.39:  Yeah, the, uh, I've always felt that [noise] public, people who are
involved with the safety of other people, should be drug tested --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- I've never said that I didn't want that.  The problem that I had was,

B.42:  [Breathing].

A.43:  whether my co-worker is on drugs or not has, does not have an influence on
my safe well-being.

B.44:  Right.  You don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery 
or --

A.45:  No, so I had,

B.46:  -- or things like that.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  And, um, they don't have any of that up here, but you know, um, I guess
it's just the productivity, and the, the number of, uh, uh, sick days, I
guess, uh, that they, that they accrue.

A.49:  Well, I'm sure that is still going to happen [laughter].

B.50:  Right, well, well, I, I, think they would, you know, someone on drugs
probably misses more work.  I guess that's why this smoking thing came out,
too.

A.51:  Um, and I've gone to those classes. 

B.52:  Right [laughter].

A.53:  Uh, unfortunately for me, I'm a smoker, and, um, I, I saw the statistics
that came out on smokers typically have more time out of work, they're, uh,
more prone to accidents and all of those other things, and, and, uh,

B.54:  And they dri-, and that's why, why I guess the car insurance has no, non
smoker rates or whatever as well.

A.55:  For, for automobile insurance?

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  I had no idea --

B.58:  #Oh yeah.# 

A.59:  -- #that they# were doing that.  I know that they were --

B.60:  Uh.

A.61:  -- originally --

B.62:  Non,

A.63:  -- talking about health,

B.64:  At least down here in Texas they have non, non smoker, they call them
discounts --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- they give you if you're a non smoker.  I, I guess there is some kind of
studies that show that if you're smoking you're not, you're not as, you know,

A.67:  You're not as attentive.

B.68:  When you're lighting up or something, you know, your hands, both hands
aren't on the wheel --

A.69:  Um.

B.70:  -- or whatever.

A.71:  Uh, that's, uh, that's different.  I've never heard of that.  How about
the, uh, the, the smoking premium out in Texas.  I understand they're they're
started doing that.

B.72:  Yeah, I guess that takes effect in, uh when.

A.73:  June, July --

B.74:  June, July --

A.75:  -- yeah.

B.76:  -- yeah.

A.77:  That they, from what I understand, that, uh, notices went out to all of the
sites [beep].

B.78:  Right.  There was a lot of, uh, controversy about that, too.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  I'm not, I'm not a smoker myself.

A.81:  Well, that's, that's the problem, that's, you don't, how about, do you ea-,
do you like French fries?

B.82:  I do [laughter].

A.83:  [Laughter] What would you, what would you ever say if they said, anybody
who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance
[beep].

B.84:  Yeah, I'd probably get upset.

A.85:  Then you would get upset.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  It's, it's, uh --

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  -- what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece.

B.90:  Right, right.

A.91:  And, and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is --

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  -- [Beep] is less than the, the, uh, the people who do not smoke --

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  -- then they can go ahead and do that.  Um.

B.96:  Right, I, I, I, assume that they, [clicking] they [/clicking] I guess
they're saying with the cigarettes, though, that they've been able to show
[beep] that it's the number one leading cause of preventable [clicking]
preventable --

A.97:  Preventable death, not, yeah, but.

B.98:  -- death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying
with smoke relating, smoking related [clicking].

A.99:  Yeah, but isn't, isn't the, uh, the insurance also for, for, [beep] uh,
Blue Cross, [clicking] so they're not only saying preventable death [beep],
they're also saying that you'll have less likelihood of being sick --

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  -- if you don't smoke.

B.102:  Right, right.  Well, right.  Well that's all, well that's all what I always
felt, if it, if those studies were true about [beep] smokers having higher
medical costs --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- and we do have one smoker in our area, who, and he, he seems to miss a
lot of work [laughter].

A.105:  Um.

B.106:  But, um.

A.107:  Is he an older person?  [Beep].

B.108:  Um, forty --

A.109:  Well, that,

B.110:  -- eight, maybe.

A.111:  That's not too old [laughter].

B.112:  Forty-five, forty-eight. 

A.113:  Yeah, and he does miss a lot of work.

B.114:  Yeah, but then there is people you talk to and say I've never been sick a
day in my life.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  So I guess in, I guess, you know, the studies show as an average, [beep]
not specific cases.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  And, uh, I thought well, with, you know, if that's really true, then, then
I guess I agreed with the extra premium.

A.119:  [Laughter].

B.120:  If it cou-, I mean, if they can come along and prove that French fries were
the same deal --

A.121:  Well.

B.122:  -- then they have a right to charge for [beep] that, too, I guess.

A.123:  What do you mean, if they can prove it?  There, there's

B.124:  That it's a major cause of uh, early,

A.125:  Hardening of the arteries, it's, it's, uh, 

B.126:  No.

A.127:  Sure it is, high cholesterol [clicking].

B.128:  Well, it depends, if they're cooked in [laughter].

A.129:  You see, one of the things that will determine whether they are able to do
that or not is not their --

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  -- ability to prove --

B.132:  Right.

A.133:  -- that it is unhealthy, because --

B.134:  Right.

A.135:  -- we all know that French fries are not healthy for you.  It's the, it's
the capability of detecting it.  How do you prove someone --

B.136:  Right.

A.137:  -- has eaten French fries.

B.138:  It's the honor system, isn't it.

A.139:  [Laughter].

B.140:  It's the honor system, I know.  It will be an interesting experiment to see
how,

A.141:  Oh, but I think in time comes, you're going to see that happen, and you're
going to see, um, [beep] where the high risk people pay [clicking] a premium,
but --

B.142:  Right.

A.143:  -- they have to find a way to prove it.

B.144:  Right.  Well, well, I think the same way with alcohol, too.  

A.145:  Yeah, yeah.

B.146:  Personally, it, you know, that would probably be the next, the next thing
[beep].

A.147:  Uh.

B.148:  I mean, but, you know, there's a difference because, uh, they say, you
know, I guess they say tobacco is addictive, I guess they say alcohol is
addictive as well.

A.149:  Yeah, but there are more drinkers than smokers --

B.150:  Oh, yeah,

A.151:  -- if you think about it --

B.152:  There is, oh, there is.

A.153:  -- and, and drinking is still socially acceptable, [beep] where smoking is
socially unacceptable today, and --

B.154:  Right.

A.155:  -- so that there is a big difference.

B.156:  Right.

A.157:  So that, so that they really can't make a --

B.158:  Right.

A.159:  -- a change in, in policy about drinking until,

B.160:  Well, it's part of the business world, too.  When you make deals, [beep]
you know, a lot of times it's a [clicking] --

A.161:  [Laughter] Yeah,

B.162:  -- three martini lunch, or whatever they say.

A.163:  Right, right, yeah.

B.164:  [Laughter].

A.165:  So I guess you can, you can classify alcohol as a drug.  So is a cigarette
in my opinion.

B.166:  Right.

A.167:  Um, [clicking] where it's not so-, I don't think people that [/clicking]
are, that are smoking are doing it voluntarily, I think they're doing it
involuntarily [beep].  I know I am.

B.168:  Yeah.

A.169:  Um, I don't know anybody in their right mind --

B.170:  Yeah.

A.171:  -- that says that, that I'm doing it because I want to.

B.172:  Makes me feel better.

A.173:  Well, I, I, I do, I do make that statement.  I say I do it because I like
it, but I can't say I'm, I'm, I'm [clicking] doing it because I want to.  I'm
doing it because I have to --

B.174:  Right.

A.175:  -- on a broad (( )).  My desire is greater than the,

B.176:  Nicotine addiction, yeah.

A.177:  [Laughter].  

B.178:  Yeah, my in-laws are both smokers, [clicking] and uh, they've tried to quit
numerous times --

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  -- and I think the longest they've made it is about three months, and then
they go to a, [beep] a friend's house or something and there they're all
smoking, and, and they just break,

A.181:  Start up again.

B.182:  Yeah, they just can't stand it.  You know, all of a sudden, they get, it's
overwhelming, and then they break down, and then they say, I'm a failure, and
then they just give up, you know.

A.183:  I, uh, I started when I was younger, and, uh, it was prior to the time that
the, [beep] the risks were, uh, were known.

@@B.184:  Were known, yeah, yeah.  So [lipsmack].  Well, I think we've probably
talked long enough.

A.185:  Okay.  Nice talking to you.

B.186:  Well, I can tell you're from, you've got that New England accent.

A.187:  [Laughter] And you've got that Southern accent [laughter].

B.188:  Does that mean, you're, you're, you're in, uh, uh,

A.189:  I'm in the At-, 

B.190:  New Hamp-,

A.191:  Attleboro, Massachusetts plant,

B.192:  Massachusetts.  

A.193:  Yeah.

B.194:  Yeah, I have, uh, my wife's grandparents are from Boston,

A.195:  Oh, no kidding.
