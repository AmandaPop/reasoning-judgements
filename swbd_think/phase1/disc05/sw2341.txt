============================================================================

A.1:  The taxes tend to, uh, keep going up, but, uh, I don't know if it helps me
any to look at some of the other countries and say, Well, there's always
someone that's, that's worse off in what they end up paying, but, uh,

B.2:  I think,

A.3:  Go ahead,

B.4:  I think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes without
getting back necessarily everything we'd like to, but so far, I don't think
I've paid enough taxes to be too, too awfully concerned about it yet.

A.5:  Yeah, I'm still, still I'm able to survive, and, and, uh, working for a
company that reaps some benefits from the tax money, it's almost like you're
paying your own salary.  I don't work directly for the government, but, uh,
getting government contracts and being in the defense industry, as it were,
even (( )) a little slim these days --

B.6:  Yes.

A.7:  -- it's still uh, still a feeling of, you know, it's not totally wasted
dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  Uh, that helps the rationale any, but it's still angering to see the
abuses, uh, even though they're a, a relatively small percentage, they still,
they sound humongous when they're, you know, you hear, millions and sometimes
billions of dollars spent and, and even some of the arguments over the
national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area, it's still
a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government.
So, but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes.
People --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- desire that that money not be spent.  Well.

B.12:  Do you all pay state income tax?

A.13:  No, no.  Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.  That's

B.14:  Neither do we, and, and, and I agree with the yet part.  They've just
started talking about introducing a state income tax, and right now we pay an
extremely high state, uh, sales tax, almost eight percent.

A.15:  Well by the time the city gets involved, I'm not sure how many, how many
people have their hand in it, but we pay eight and a quarter cent.

B.16:  Wow.

A.17:  So, it's, it's pretty, pretty much, but I think it's divvied up pretty
much, too.  Uh, the county gets some, the city gets some and the state gets
some.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  And it's, it's quite a bit.  I think six something is the state and, and,
uh, the rest of the pie goes elsewhere.  But we're in a particular part of the
state that's pretty well off.  So, it's, it's like we get a lot of that back
as far as local taxation goes.

B.20:  Well, that's good.

A.21:  Yeah, we have a real good, you know, police department, and real good, uh,
city services, and boy, the parks are all over the place, and there's a lot
of, lot of money spent on us, but, uh, the poor rural folks, uh, barely can
get ambulance service and everything else, so it's, it's a real mixed blessing
I guess.

B.22:  That's, I think that's the biggest problem I have with the tax system is
there, there is such a disparity between, between really the haves and the
have nots, and I, I think the things that they use as a basis for distributing
back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again.

A.23:  Yeah, it'd be nice if you could find someone, oh, uninfluenced by groups
and, and honest enough to find a way that would go over, and then you'd have
to find a way to make it work.

B.24:  I know.  That would be a definite B V R, M I R [laughter].

A.25:  Yeah, yeah.  The, uh, bureaucracy seems to spend more money just trying to
administer some of these programs than the programs are worth.  Uh, it seems,
uh, an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much
paper just to get rid of so few dollars, in some of these cases.  So (( )),

B.26:  I think a lot, a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the
forest for the trees.  I, I wonder if, if they realize the magnitude of some
of the red tape you have to go through.

A.27:  Yeah.  And so much of that red tape was, was initially and is added on to
try and stop a given abuse.  You know, you discover a particular problem and
say, well, we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra
papers to say, Well, you, you deserve this welfare or whatever, and they just
keep trying to, to close all the loopholes, and stop the abuse, and all
they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and, and, uh,
decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse.

B.28:  And I don't, I don't think they're getting their money's worth, and I, I, I
definitely don't think that the added steps are, are getting the benefit that
they would like them to.  I think it's just causing most everyone else more
problems, because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws, they will find
a way --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- if they want to badly enough.  They'll either find it themselves or
they'll find someone to do it for them.

A.31:  Right.  It does seem to be the case.  I don't know whether it's worth, and
the economy has gone pretty well for a hundred years or so, with the
government doing what they do with taxes, steering investments and steering
virtually every dollar you make or spend.  It gets, uh, steered one way or the
other based on tax breaks you get and you know, housing had tax breaks for a
while, and then they slacked off on that for a while, and then just, uh,
generally wanting to be in control of, of where everything's going for the
most part, give you the best break if you go their direction.  I don't know
what, what would happen if we got rid of some of those controls and just went
to what some people would say would be simpler of just having you spend this
much, therefore you should be taxed this much.  That would only encourage
saving.  It's not a, you know, a tax your income, because now you're talking
about having to report it, and all that kind of stuff.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  But if you put the burden on the retailer, who really doesn't care if you,
you know, buy your groceries and the like.  He doesn't care who bought the
groceries, you're going to pay the tax on it.  So, most people tend to spend
what they make anyway, in our income brackets.

B.34:  Right [laughter].

A.35:  So, you know, those fifty thousand dollars, or the thirty thousand dollars
would pretty much spend the majority of it, and what they didn't save they
wouldn't, or what they could save they wouldn't get taxed on.

B.36:  And that makes sense.  But, like you said, I mean, it, it seems simple, and
I think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it.

A.37:  Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward a particular type of
savings.  You wouldn't be able to say, well, you get better tax bonds if you,
you know, avoid the capital gains tax, and if you do it this way, do this, and
you roll over your I R A -s and all that, they --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that, but
boy, if you save that much money, and it didn't have the taxation problem,
well, you might, might do all right.  I don't know.

B.40:  Yeah, even if you didn't invest in necessarily the best thing, you would
have so much more to invest --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- you would still be ahead.

A.43:  That's for sure.

B.44:  And that's something, that's something I need to learn a lot more about is,
is under the current structure, what is the best thing to be investing in for
the future, because that's a, that's a scary thought.  You always hear that
Social Security won't be around by the time we're sixty-three or sixty-five
and, and need it.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  And that's a scary thought.

A.47:  That's true.  Plus what, what there will be of it, even if it's there,
isn't quite enough anyway, so.

B.48:  No.

A.49:  You're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then
hope what you did didn't go away.  Yeah, the, uh, taxes are, are kind of
messed up, I guess, with the abuses and the things we've written into it, but,
uh, looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you
have in the world, there, it's not all that pleasant anywhere.

B.50:  We still look pretty good, don't we.

A.51:  Yeah, pretty much.  Well, I hear one of my kids doing something they
shouldn't be --

B.52:  [Laughter] Okay.

A.53:  -- so I'll, uh, let you go.

B.54:  It's been nice talking to you.

A.55:  Maybe we'll catch each other again.

B.56:  Okay, have a good evening.

A.57:  I'll try.  Bye.

B.58:  Thanks.  Bye-bye.
