============================================================

A.1:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about what the weather's been like.  Let's
see, uh, ...

@B.2:  Pretty windy. 

A.3:  Yeah.  It's been windy the past few weeks, I've noticed that. 

B.4:  Yeah.  So far. 

A.5:  Has been, hasn't been too much rain which is really nice.  Because last
week all that rain and,

B.6:  Yeah. 

A.7:  it was just bad with all the flooding.  When, uh, Trinity Mills Road
flooded over all those times,

B.8:  Oh, yeah. 

A.9:  you couldn't, I couldn't pass by it. 

B.10:  Oh, really. 

A.11:  Well, I, I didn't have to go down there but, uh, uh, driving on the freeway
was,

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  uh, made it difficult because everybody couldn't get off and they'd get
off some where else.

B.14:  Right.  Well, you know, they said that we haven't had enough rain though,
and that surprises me because seems like we've had a lot of rain this year.
But, since we've, uh, last I heard, that we hadn't met our, you know, hadn't
got up to the right level yet, that we ...

A.15:  Yeah.  The current average or whatever. 

B.16:  Right.  Well, it truly surprises me because it seems like we, seems like we
do get a lot of rain but I guess not.  I guess it doesn't accumulate too much,
[sniffing] but, um, I'm glad it's summer.

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  [laughter]. 

A.19:  I like the warm weather.  [laughter]. 

B.20:  Me too. 

A.21:  And the winter wasn't that bad.  I was really grateful that it didn't get
that bad this winter.

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  I'm not, uh, fan of cold weather.  I've lived up in, in the northern part
of the country and I never did like the cold weather that much.

B.24:  I don't either.  I want some,  you know, ski  or something,

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  You know, I'm benefitting from it. 

A.27:  Yeah. 

B.28:  I guess.  [laughter]. 

A.29:  [laughter]. 

B.30:  In a way, [laughter], I just, I really like the summer, like t-, uh, be
able to lay out or, you know, just be outside.

A.31:  Yeah.  I don't mind the heat that much.  It doesn't bother me that much.

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  Cold weather, s-, I don't know, I just can't tolerate too much but, uh, 
s-, ...

B.34:  I know, it seems like you can never get warm enough to me.  

A.35:  Yeah.  So I like Texas. 

B.36:  #I do too#.

A.37:  #It's a nice place to be#.  And so, I guess it's probably the same over
where you're at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville.

B.38:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A.39:  I would think.  I don't know.  Might be a little bit different because the
city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the
heating,

B.40:  That's true. 

A.41:  of the, of the  concrete and asphalt.

B.42:  That's true.  That's true.  It does seem t-,

A.43:  That's why they always say it's five degrees warmer in the city at night
time,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  than out in the country. 

B.46:  Uh-huh.  I do like, um, like an old, uh, warm summer, the breezes
that it gets at night, you know, you can open your windows and,

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  Oh, and that gets those nice warm breezes coming in.  And that's nice
[sniffing].

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  And that helps on utilities.  [laughter].

A.51:  [laughter].  Of course.  Who can't use that. 

B.52:  Yeah.  And that's especially in Garland.  [laughter]. 

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  It's real bad. 

A.55:  Especially in Texas, period.

B.56:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we didn't have much.  We had some good ice, but not a
lot, thank goodness, not ...

A.57:  Well,  have you lived in Texas all your life?  

B.58:  Yeah.  Sure have.  How about you? 

A.59:  No.  

B.60:  (( )).

A.61:  This is, this is the fifth state I've lived in. 

B.62:  Are you serious? 

A.63:  Yeah.  So, I've just been all over the country and, uh, some places had
really cold weather.  When I was living in Indiana, it got really cold.

B.64:  Ugh.

A.65:  I mean, one day it was like sixty below zero. 

B.66:  Um, [gasp] are you serious. 

A.67:  And, uh, uh, they said, uh, you know, stay inside. 

B.68:  Um. 

A.69:  In fact, like last year I was driving home one night and I was listening to
some station, some radio station in Iowa, and, uh, the, uh, D J was saying, uh,
tonight's going to be like eighty below.

B.70:  Gosh. 

A.71:  And he said, uh, this is serious folks, this is serious business, stay
inside.  Do not go outside at any, for any reason.  [laughter].

B.72:  Oh, that's horrible. 

A.73:  And I thought, yeah.  No kidding. 

B.74:  Oh.  I hate that.  That's horrible. 

A.75:  That, of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze, you
know, in the country.  And,

B.76:  Right, right. 

A.77:  this last winter wasn't, wasn't that bad a-, as I remember it. 

B.78:  Well, that's true.  Well, a friend of mine went home this weekend, uh, he
lives up in the Pan Handle --

A.79:  Uh-huh. 

B.80:  -- and, um, he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the
next day it was up to seventy five.  [laughter].

A.81:  Is that right? 

B.82:  Yeah.  That would be horrible.  [laughter].

A.83:  [laughter].

B.84:  I wouldn't like that.  [laughter].  Where you just can't depend on it.

A.85:  Schizophrenic weather.  [laughter]. 

B.86:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just real comfortable here where we live and that's the
way I like it.  I like being able to depend on a hot summer and --

A.87:  Yeah. 

B.88:  -- you know, it, it gets cold enough in the winter to where you --

A.89:  You realize it.  

B.90:  -- yeah.  And you can do your fires and everything,

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  and then move on.

A.93:  When I lived in California, they had, uh, what I describe as boring
weather.  It was the same virtually year-round, which I thought,

B.94:  Yeah. 

A.95:  was great, you didn't have to worry about tornadoes,

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  you didn't have to worry about, uh, too cold or too hot.  It was just,

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  nice and even and I liked that. 

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  It was, it was nice, but, uh, I don't mind the heat. 

B.102:  I don't either. 

A.103:  I don-, I don't miss the cold at all, but I don't mind the heat. 

B.104:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind some, you know, like, I guess, after awhile
in the summer when it hits, I guess about October, and you get a few cool
days.  I don't mind that because it kind of gives you some relief.

A.105:  Yeah.  

B.106:  #You know, that's nice#.

A.107:  #That's right.  It's kind of nice too#, to have that fall. 

B.108:  Yeah. 

A.109:  Spring and fall are nice times of the year. 

B.110:  Yeah.  They really are. 

A.111:  Spring, because we're getting tha-, getting rid of winter finally.
[laughter].

B.112:  Yeah.  And all the trees and plants are coming out, thank goodness,

A.113:  Yeah. 

B.114:  And grass.  [laughter]. 

A.115:  Yeah. 

B.116:  For a change, I got, I get sick of winter just looking, everything is so
dead, I hate that.

A.117:  Yeah.  No kidding.  

B.118:  So.

A.119:  That's, uh, kind of depressing to see all that.

B.120:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's just an old gray looking sky and it's
boring.

A.121:  Yeah. 

B.122:  Really.  I guess it wouldn't be bad if you, I guess up north it wouldn't be
bad to visit.  And we, we love to go skiing and, um, now it's beautiful when
it snows.  And you have all those pine trees and everything.  That is pretty,
but I sure couldn't live there.

A.123:  Yeah.  Y-, it's something you have to get used to I guess.

B.124:  Yeah. 

A.125:  I mean, I lived with that for a while and you just adapt. 

B.126:  I guess so. 

A.127:  To a certain tempe-, here.  In the summer time we go back and forth between
air-conditioned buildings and there you go back and forth warmed up,

B.128:  Warmed.  [laughter]. 

A.129:  areas.  I mean, uh, 

B.130:  I guess so.

A.131:  I remember when I was living in Indiana, I was, uh, g-, going to school
there and I used to ride my bike across campus --

B.132:  Uh.

A.133:  -- and one day it was, must have been close to ten degrees above zero,

B.134:  Gosh. 

A.135:  and, and I thought, well, if I ride my bike,

B.136:  Uh. 

A.137:  the wind chill will be close to zero,

B.138:  Uh-huh. 

A.139:  it will last seven minutes, six minutes,

B.140:  [laughter]. 

A.141:  If I walk, it will be ten degrees warmer, but it will last twenty minutes.

B.142:  [laughter].  That's right. 

A.143:  Which do I want, you know --  

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  -- colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a, for a longer
time,

B.146:  Right.

A.147:  so I took the shorter, colder option,

B.148:  I don't blame you.  [laughter].  I would too. 

A.149:  and I got down to where, to the building I was going to, and my face was
about frozen off and I thought was that such a good choice.  I wasn't quite
for sure at that point.

B.150:  [laughter].  I do hate that feeling.  Though it ... 

A.151:  Oh, yeah. 

B.152:  It ...

A.153:  Frostbite. 

B.154:  Yeah, yeah.  My fingers always get, get it real bad.  I hate that, I mean,
I bundle them up and everything and, and I, I still get it.

A.155:  Yeah. 

B.156:  I guess I can bare the cold, it's just when it does, the wind hits,

A.157:  Oh, yeah. 

B.158:  Oh, that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone. 

A.159:  It does. 

B.160:  [laughter].  It does. 

A.161:  You can feel all the way through, it's like a knife.  #Like a sw-, like a
sword#,

B.162:  #Yeah.  It hurts#. 

A.163:  sword slicing in half or whatever.  [laughter].

B.164:  Exactly, hurts.  I hate it.

@@A.165:  Yeah.  Oh, well, I don't know what else I can say about it. 

B.166:  Well, me either.  [laughter].  It's kind of a boring topic, I guess. 

A.167:  [laughter].  Well (( )) you too. 

B.168:  All right. (( )) I'm through. 

A.169:  Have a good evening. 

B.170:  You, too.  Bye-bye.

A.171:  Bye.
