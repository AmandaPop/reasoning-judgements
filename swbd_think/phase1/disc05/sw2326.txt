========================================================================

B.1:  Yeah, I just bought one, so, 

A.2:  Well, that should be interesting.  Okay you ready?  

B.3:  Yeah, guess so.  

@A.4:  Here we go [beep].  What kind of car did you buy, Ralph?  

B.5:  Uh, Mazda.  

A.6:  A Mazda.  How come you got a Mazda?  

B.7:  Uh, price basically.  

A.8:  Oh. 

B.9:  Price and, uh, what, all the things it came with for the price I couldn't
beat it.

A.10:  You could-, couldn't find an American built car?  

B.11:  Uh, I didn't really look at American cars.  Uh, had a couple bad
experiences with American cars.

A.12:  Huh.  

B.13:  Just not holding up, so.  Uh, my last car was a foreign, foreign made car
and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell
apart so --

A.14:  I'll be darned.  

B.15:  -- I just decided to go foreign.  

A.16:  I've had pretty much th-, I've had pretty much the opposite experience.

B.17:  Really.  

A.18:  Yeah.  I generally drive a, a large Ford Super cab, you know, like one
fifty or something and the one time I traded and got something different, I
got a little Datsun, uh, King cab.  It didn't last eighteen months.

B.19:  Really.  

A.20:  I had, had more trouble with that.  

B.21:  Well, it comes to trucks, though, I would probably think to go American
because everybody I know has got a American made truck.  They just seemed to
be more rugged, but, uh, the cars just seem to fall apart.

A.22:  Yeah, I, that's probably true.  I'm getting ready to, I think I'm going to
trade off the Super cab and I'm considering going with either one of those
four door S ten Blazers, a four door Explorer or four door Jeep.  But I can't
decide which one.

B.23:  Get out there and test drive.  

A.24:  Yeah, that's about the only thing to do.  I just, I, I'm looking for, uh,
fuel economy and, and durability and I've got to have some high road
clearance.  We got some property and I need to get out in the pasture a lot.
But I don't need to haul a pickup as much, haul around stuff in the pickup as
much as I used to.

B.25:  Yeah.  

A.26:  We got an old one there at the ranch we use now.  But I just got to have
something I can get out in the field and, of course that truck is only getting
like eight to ten miles a gallon, maybe twelve on a good day.

B.27:  Right.  

A.28:  And that just kills me.  Especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas.

B.29:  I don't know how much going to, how much better you're going to get with a
Blazer there.

A.30:  Well, those small ones, uh, those little bitty ones, I'm going to go with
the small one with the two wheel drive.  I don't really, I, I haven't had a
use for four wheel drive tell you the truth.  They say they're getting
eighteen to twenty in them.

B.31:  Really.  

A.32:  Yeah, I've got a friend of mine's got a, uh, he bought a four door Jeep
with the posi-track rear end instead of the four wheel drive, he's getting
sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty-two on the road.

B.33:  Oh, that's not so bad, then.  

A.34:  No, he's not really, and he's not, he said he's pretty heavy footed.  He's
clipping along at sixty-five or so around there when he can get away with it.
So I think I could probably stand, you know, twice the gas mileage.  It
wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit.

B.35:  Right.  

A.36:  I just don't know if I could stand one that small.  Because I'm fairly
large.  And I've always driven a truck or something.  I don't know,

B.37:  Yeah, I don't know, I haven't been in the now ones.  You know, they look
big on the road, some of these, uh,

A.38:  They don't look too bad, I just, you know, I, I have, have to get in one to
find out, I just don't know if I could stand, you know, being cooped up.  My
wife's got, uh, three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought.
She has thirty-nine Chevy, a fifty-three and a sixty-seven.  And anytime I
drive any of those, I just, you know, it's like being in a coffin.

B.39:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.40:  I just feel hemmed in, I've got to have something fairly large.  But I
think prob-, probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something
that will, that will blend, you know, uh, fuel economy and, and price and, uh,
durability.

B.41:  Durability, yeah, if you got to take it out in the field.  

A.42:  You know, the little, those smaller tur-, 

B.43:  Yeah, they show them jumping over those ramps, but, hey.  

A.44:  Yeah, I know.  That's, I think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay
for the repairs to it.

B.45:  Yeah.  

A.46:  But, that's what they don't show you when they get, you know, when they get
them off.  They show them jumping up and down hills and like that, but they
don't show you the repairs --

B.47:  Right.  

A.48:  -- you know, the front ends impossible to line up on mine.  Last time I
lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars.  So, I don't
know {pause}.  How you getting gas mileage in your Mazda. Have you (( )) up.

B.49:  Oh, about, uh, twenty-six, twenty-seven in the city [breathing].  It's a,
it's a four cylinder and it's kind of a sports coupe, guess a little sports
car, but --

A.50:  You do most of your driving,

B.51:  -- it does pretty good.  

A.52:  You do most of your driving in the city?  

B.53:  Huh?  

A.54:  Do you do most of your driving in the city?  

B.55:  Yeah, I haven't even had a chance, I've only had it for about three months,
I haven't had a chance to take it out on the road.  I'll probably be heading
down your way in, uh, oh, the end of May, end of April, I guess when school's
out.

A.56:  Um.  Well, watch it coming down south down when you get through, uh, round,
round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a Highway Patrol that just patrols up
and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs.

B.57:  I'll have to keep that in mind because, uh,

A.58:  He just, he just lives out there, he makes his living on the road out
there.

B.59:  Roundrock and where?   

A.60:  Georgetown.  

B.61:  Georgetown.  

A.62:  Georgetown on down through Roundrock.  He just, he just patrols up and down
through that area.  Now that's a neat little car, those little five --

B.63:  Oh, uh, 

A.64:  -- little five point O Mustangs.  The fast ones.  

B.65:  Yeah, I wanted to get a Mustang, I wanted to get a convertible, but the
convertibles, you know, they tack on an extra five, six grand.

A.66:  Oh, yeah.  

B.67:  And it's, like, I can't see paying that for a, for just being able to take
the roof down.

A.68:  You can get a sunroof a lot cheaper.  

B.69:  Yeah.  

A.70:  It's probably more functional.  I don't think, I had a convertible once in
college and it was fun when, you know, during the warm months, but God, it was
miserable during the winter.

B.71:  Yeah, it's like I got -- 

A.72:  I don't care what they say.  

B.73:  -- and plus the way crime is going around here in the city, you know, take
a knife to it, break in.

A.74:  Yeah, and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars.  I don't
know what they are now --

B.75:  Yeah, I'm sure they're,  

A.76:  -- probably, probably eight hundred by now.  

B.77:  Yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because insurance,

A.78:  And if you ever roll one, that's pretty much it.  

B.79:  Yeah.  

A.80:  You know, that, that, that and the windshield post doesn't stop much.

B.81:  I had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago.  It was a B M W.
Totaled the car.

A.82:  Um.  

B.83:  He walked out of it, though.  

A.84:  They don't give those, they don't give those B M W -s away.  Those are
expensive machines, um {pause}.  Well, think we about done our five minutes.

B.85:  All right.  I got a meeting to get to so, 

A.86:  Okay.  Good talking to you.  

B.87:  Great.  

A.88:  See you later.

B.89:  #Bye.# 

A.90:  #Bye-bye.#
