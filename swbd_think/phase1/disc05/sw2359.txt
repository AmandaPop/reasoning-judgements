===========================================================================

A.1:  Hi, Mary.

B.2:  Hi.

A.3:  have you gone visiting, uh, any new restaurants lately?

B.4:  Well, I haven't been to any new ones, but I have, uh, several that I
frequent, uh, mainly because of specialties in foods, and I have so many sp-,
so many foods that I prefer, uh, that I enjoy such as oriental foods I don't
like Japanese food, but I like all Chinese food.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  I, I tend to get stuck in, in and I find a place that I like and I
stay there.

B.6:  Yeah, sounds familiar.

A.7:  Um, [laughter] some of the things I like are atmosphere, um, food, price,
um, but mostly I think, you know, service --

B.8:  Yes.

A.9:  -- and atmosphere are the two things that, you know, I don't minds paying
little bit if, if I don't have to wait too long to eat and if the service is
good and the food is good.

B.10:  Yes.

A.11:  And I find like the places that I'm going to now, um, bec-, whenever you
find a place that's good other people have already, have already found the
same,

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  kind of a place, and so, sometimes I have to go to this place in, where I
know I have to wait at least fifteen minutes, sometimes a half hour and, um,
they have little bar there so we sit there and, um, sipping on some mixed
drinks before we get to eat.

B.14:  That sounds, uh, very much like one of our very, very best places to get
steaks.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Uh, and they open at five and if your not there at five-thirty, you'll
probably have about an hour wait.

A.17:  Wow, okay.  So this, 

B.18:  And they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be,

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  but it's, it's an ((specially)) fine restaurant and when you consider
they take no plastic or checks, strictly cash and,

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  they've been in business, oh, for at least forty years.

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  Uh, that's the,

A.25:  They must have some good food there.

B.26:  Yes, yes.  It's, their, their steaks are exquisite.  They also have, uh,
excellent, uh, liver which I happen to like.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And, um, those are the two specialties which they have, that and their
stewed tomatoes which are well known all over the Dayton area.

A.29:  Uh, I had, uh, an opportunity to visit, visit the Dallas area and, uh, I
went to some steak houses while I was out there and there was this one place
that I visited that was really unique.  The waitresses were dressed like
little cowgirls.

B.30:  Oh.

A.31:  [Throat_clearing] And the, I don't remember the name of the place but for a
menu all they had was a, it was like a wooden block.

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.33:  And, and, um, I think for food they had steak and beans [laughter].

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  And they had three different sizes of steak.  The cowboy, the cowgirl and
the,

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  I forget the, the other one, the he-man or something like this,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  and, um, and I, I, I found it, uh, to be very good.  The atmosphere was
good,

B.40:  Yes.

A.41:  it was a lot of fun.

B.42:  Right.  Well, one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here
not too very long ago called Harbor Lights,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  specializes in fish. 

A.45:  Huh.

B.46:  And, uh, the atmosphere is fantastic, and I was there with, it's a group,
um, that, uh, we were having a going away dinner for a friend, and there were
twelve of us and I, the, the food that, uh, we ordered each of us was quite
good but the service was horrendous.

A.47:  Oh, no kidding.

B.48:  And the, the waitress never once came behind me, um, um, on our side of the
table, she reached across the table.

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  She never once asked if we wanted coffee, we had to grab onto someone else.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  They didn't refill our water glasses.  Um, someone had only eaten a
portion of their food, and wanted to take it home, and asked to have it boxed,
and she just pitched it out,

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  and then, when she finally did bring something, um, to replace that she
practically threw it at the person.

A.55:  Oh, that's too bad.

B.56:  Yes and, 

A.57:  See how one, one place, one person can make a big difference on whether you
go back to the place again.

B.58:  Oh, absolutely.  What made me angry was that when there are groups such as
ours, there were twelve of us,

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  they automatically put the tip on the bill.

A.61:  Wow, okay.

B.62:  And I'll tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with
the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor
service,

A.63:  Yeah,

B.64:  but,

A.65:  that's really too bad.  I had, um, one place that I enjoyed going to but
my, my girlfriend didn't like it, and then I had asked her about it and she
said, um, that the reason why she didn't like it was that she felt that the
place wasn't cleaned well.

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  They had, um, younger kids, you know,

B.68:  Yes, right, right.

A.69:  wiping the tables down.  And they weren't very well trained, I guess.
And they didn't do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the
waitresses came, they, she just put all of the clean utensils and everything
right on top of these dirty tables.

B.70:  Oh [laughter].  Well, one thing that gets me is when you see them do,
putting out the, um, the, um, knives, forks, and what have you, and when they
put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your
mouth.

A.71:  [Laughter] Yeah, right.

B.72:  And that really up sets me when I see that.

A.73:  [Laughter] I can certainly understand that.

B.74:  Oh [laughter].

A.75:  In fact, in this same restaurant that my girlfriend doesn't like to go to
she, um, she frequently finds food struck onto the utensils,

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  where she's got to go through , uh, three or four, uh, different,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  um, utensils.  And the, the, the, waitresses are very nice they'll,
they'll keep exchanging it.

B.80:  Yes, but,

A.81:  But they don't look.

B.82: Yeah.

A.83:  You know, like, she had complained about it one time and the girl said she
was sorry.  She picked up these utensils and, and when back and grabbed some
new ones, and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse,

B.84:  Oh.

A.85:  than the ones that she took away.  So, she is not even looking, you know
and,

B.86:  No, no.  And actually, you know, those are the kind of things that should
get taken back to the management.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  Because the, the, the waitresses have no control over the, the way the
dishes are, and, cleaned in the kitchen and,

A.89:  That's true.

B.90:  if they're not cleaned off well when they go threw the dishwasher, food
just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there, and then when they
dry them, um, if they air dry them or heat dry them, it dries it right on,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  and that's terrible.

A.93:  Yeah, yeah.  I agree the management should know about it, but the waitress
should, especially if you ask them to take,

B.94:  Yes.

A.95:  something back to look at the ones that she's, um, bringing over to you
instead of just grabbing a handful [laughter] and bring them over again.

B.96:  [Laughter] I agree with that but just don't ever get a glass that has
lipstick on it.

A.97:  Oh boy [laughter].

B.98:  Oh, that is terrible.  I had that happen only once.  I don't remember
where, but it's always, one time is enough for me to be aware of the
situation, and I look at every glass that I get [laughter].

A.99:  How about fast food?  Do you enjoy, um, fast food restaurants?

B.100:  Yeah, I don't mind that.  Um, my husband never cared for fast food, so we
didn't go that often,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  but, you know, I have no problem with going to a McDonald's, or a
Wendy's, or a, or a Long John Silver's or any of those once in a while, not
often, but once in a while.

A.103:  Yeah, yeah.

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  I enjoy it once in a while but I enjoy relaxing while,

B.106:  Oh, yeah.

A.107:  I can't really do that in these fast food places. 

B.108:  That's very true.  Now, once in a while if there's a good ballgame like
there's going to be tonight [laughter] with Duke and, um, Kansas City, um,

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  Kansas, um, you see I would enjoy having a pizza and just sit and watch
the game and a have a pizza and a beer.

A.111:  Uh-huh.  At a,

B.112:  That I would enjoy.

A.113:  At a restaurant or at home?

B.114:  No, no.  At home just have it,

A.115:  At home.

B.116:  delivered.  Yeah, we,

A.117:  Oh, yeah.

B.118:  we have some of our pizza places deliver, and I assume that you have that
there also.

A.119:  We're just beginning with that.  It, um, it took one of the pizza
companies, and I think it was, um, gee, #Domino's.#

B.120:  #Domino's# was the first one to start, yes.

A.121:  Yeah, right.  After they started I guess the other, uh, businesses,

B.122:  Yes.

A.123:  lost money,

B.124:  Yes.

A.125:  and they all began doing the same thing.

B.126:  We have Domino's, we have Pizza Hut, and then we have a couple of other
smaller,

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Little Ceasars and Juan's Pizza.  They're all in the general facility
where I live and so I can,

A.129:  We have,

B.130:  And then my most favorite one doesn't deliver.

A.131:  No?  Which one is that?

B.132:  It's called Marian's Pizza,

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  but I think it is local.  And,

A.135:  Yeah, we have Popa-, did you ever here of Popaginos?

B.136:  No.

A.137:  Okay.  We have a, that's a fairly large chain in New England, we have a, a
Popaginos, um, and they had not been delivering up until the time where
Domino's,

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  began delivering and within a matter of six months, they started up there
own,

B.140:  Right.

A.141:  delivery service.

B.142:  That makes a big difference.  Well, we have a lot of businesses going out
of business, uh, in this area and I don't know whether it's necessarily
nationwide, but many of the smaller stores, grocery stores,

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  card shops, rest-, smaller restaurants, I can't compete with some of the
larger ones, and they are all going under.

A.145:  Um, it would seem to me that if, that if I owned a business the thing that
I would want to do is a, is a get little survey, uh, like we're doing with
each other and, and encourage people to, to give that information back to the
management.

B.146:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely.

A.147:  And then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive.

B.148:  Well, I, um, I've been retired from education for, uh, oh, what, eight
years, and I do I have a bunch of, had I should say, a bunch of little jobs
such as a sales associate, um, job at a women's specialty dress shop, and, um,
I was a manager part-time at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a
modeling agency and modeling.  So, the card shop just went out of business
we've been there almost a year, almost two years.

A.149:  Uh-huh.

B.150:  But, and the store was precious.  Everyone liked the store.  They liked the
kinds of cards and what have you, but the location was so poor.

A.151:  Uh-huh. 

B.152:  And it was in a shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that
took them almost four years to really get that going, and that strip filled
up, but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip, and there's still
no stores on either side,

A.153:  Uh.

B.154:  and it's been over a year and a half.

A.155:  Oh, that's too bad.  If,

B.156:  Yes, and, and it's sad because it was, it was a nice store, and she was
such a lovely young gal to work for.

A.157:  Um.

B.158:  I just feel very bad ...
