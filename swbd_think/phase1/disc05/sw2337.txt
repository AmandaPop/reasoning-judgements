========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Brian, I going to press number one and we'll go.

B.2:  Okay [beep].

A.3:  Hey, um, uh, Ronnie, I think my first introduction to the metric system
was in physics in college, and I think prior to that I didn't even realize
that another system existed.  Uh, but it makes so darn much sense to me --

B.4:  Is it,

A.5:  -- over the English system.  I, I, I have a hard time understanding why
people don't take to it.

B.6:  Well, um, you know, I, I agree with the, the ease in the use of it and, uh,
the, it certainly, it's so much easier to do your, do computations,
calculations to measure things with it, to, in every, every aspect of it is
simpler.  Except there is one big stumbling block in it, and in the United
States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has
been here for the last hundred years is in the English system.

A.7:  Yeah, I understand.

B.8:  And tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often.

A.9:  No, no.

B.10:  So I think that's the, the one place where, uh, they will have a hard time,
uh, getting people to change.

A.11:  Yeah.  And I noticed that too in, uh, in, uh, metal, stamp metal parts that
we buy.  We at one time went back through and dual, dual dimensioned them 
all --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's easy to put down point O O one inches
or one mil.  It's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- uh, in, in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around.  I
guess one of the things, I, I think metrically.  I've got a, uh, a, and it
drives my wife crazy, you know.  She'll say, How far is it from here to
somewhere she wants to go --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and I'll say, Oh, about eight kilometers.  And she'll look at me and
give me this crazy look.

B.18:  [Laughter].  

A.19:  But, my, uh, my, my, uh, hobby is distance running.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  And basically all of the races are five K --

B.22:  Sure.

A.23:  -- ten K, fifteen K.  Nobody runs in terms of miles anymore.  Uh, and I
guess that's got me thinking metrically.  Also, uh, uh, we have lived
overseas.  From nineteen eighty-one to eighty-four we lived Quadalampor,
Malaysia --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and for, in eighty-five, six and seven we lived in Baggio City {city in
the Philippines} in the Philippines.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  And I guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked
metrically --

B.28:  Exactly.

A.29:  -- and ultimately, at some point, you know it doesn't happen overnight --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- but at some point your frame of reference is metric, at least in terms
of distances.

B.32:  Right.  I, uh, lived in Brazil for four years from when I was seven to
eleven years old, and so by the time I got into high school and took some
physics there and then into college, um, where I was a physics major in
college, so I'm more than [laughter] uh, familiar with the metric system.

A.33:  Okay.

B.34:  And, uh, but I think that initial period, you know, from way, made it
familiar for me.  So I wasn't afraid of the metric system, and, and, and I
knew how much it made sense, and how much easier it was to do things that way.
So, I, I, it's too bad that more Americans can't, don't have the opportunity
to, to really use it, to, to get to a point where it, it's something other
than something that causes them fear and confusion.  Because if you just, the
ini-, in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that
ultimately will be simpler, are going to be confusing.

A.35:  Oh, yes, yes.

B.36:  And it's getting over that hurdle --

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  -- that will finally get us into it, if we ever get into it.

A.39:  Yeah.  I, I, I don't think it's going to happen in, in, in our lifetime, at
least not in mine.  Uh, I think, uh, there's a gigantic psychological barrier
which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die, uh, dimension in
English --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- and I think that the, uh, the ultimate solution will be to start
introducing it, uh, in, at, at the introduction to school.

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  [Clicking] And, uh, hang on a sec, Brian, I got to get rid of that call.

B.44:  Okay {silence}.

A.45:  Are you there?

B.46:  Yep.

A.47:  Okay.  I think the, uh, uh, the solution is to start it at the earliest,
uh, stages of schooling, and, uh, uh, make that the system to which
kindergartners and first graders are introduced.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  Uh, the drawback to that is, I don't think we have any teachers in our,
other than physics teachers, in our school system that are comfortable with
it.

B.50:  Right, [laughter] right, that may be true also.  I don't know, chemists
seem to.

A.51:  And chemists, that's what I got my first degree in, chemistry, too, and I,

B.52:  Okay.

A.53:  And, you know, we don't talk in quarts and pints --

B.54:  No.

A.55:  -- we talk in liters and milliliters,

B.56:  I mean, can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calc-, I
mean, it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics
in the English system at this point, although gosh, all those,

A.57:  Oh, yeah, I, I, I don't think we could even think English, and I'm just
thinking now, in our business, you know, we make, we make chips.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  And, uh, we assemble them, though, and it's interesting.  We are, uh, uh,
basically talking, well, we talk about a package size, yeah, we talk about it
in terms of, uh, uh, six hundred mils, or six-tenths of an inch.  I guess we
do that.  But on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes, uh, to
move a die out of a package, in other words how much, how well do we have the
die inhering --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- to the, to the base.  And we talk about that in terms of kilograms.

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  So we use it a lot.  We talk about, uh, gold ball bonds, bond strength.  We
talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the, uh,
push the ball off its substrate.  So, we, we tend to have a mixed bag, and new
concepts, uh, that have come along with the electronic age, I think just sort
of get introduced metrically, so that's the way we do it.

B.64:  Right.  

A.65:  Uh.

B.66:  It's interesting, in the, in, though, the work I'm doing, I'm, uh, the kind
of things I do is manage, uh, research and development contracts, and we do
everything from basic research all the way through, uh, we have a couple of
systems that are actually, um, places where they're producing a product.  And
what I've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy
thinking and, uh, doing the initial, uh, development of an idea, use the
metric system.  And they talk in terms of metric, uh, uh, units.  In turn
around, the people, however, that have the engineers that are actually
producing a product, do most of their, carry, conduct most of their discussion
in terms of the English units --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- which I, I find, it's interesting that, it's like the guys that are
still doing the work, that are actually making the stuff are using the English
system, but the ones that come up with the, they're doing these theoretical
analysis and the number crunching, um, are doing it in terms of the metric
system.  I, I, it kind of seems strange, but,

A.69:  Right.  You, you mentioned just a satellite here, you mentioned you lived
in Brazil.  Whereabouts?

B.70:  Sao Paulo {city in Brazil}.

A.71:  Oh, Sao Paulo.  Our plant there is in Cantinas {location in Brazil} --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and I'm there several times a year.

B.74:  No kidding, uh.

A.75:  And, uh, of course we fly into Sao Paulo and, and drive on to, uh, uh,
Cantinas,

B.76:  And do you fly into Camgonias {location in Brazil} or the other one down
there, down south.

A.77:  Uh, I use the other one, can't think of the (( )).

B.78:  Yeah, okay, the international air-, yeah,

A.79:  Yeah, the international airport, because I, I generally fly in from, uh,
well, the last two times I've come in from Mexico City via Menaus {foreign
city}.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  And, uh, before that though, it's uh, it's, uh, Miami, Rio De Janeiro, Sao
Paulo --

B.82:  Sure, sure,

A.83:  -- type flight.  And, uh, I just love it there.  I, I absolutely, uh, uh,
uh love the, I look forward to the times I go down there.  Where did you get
your, from where did you get your physics degree?

B.84:  Uh, the Air Force Academy.

A.85:  Oh, okay, okay.

B.86:  Uh, I'm one of those [laughter].

A.87:  Yeah, you like Colorado.  Are, are you a civilian employee about now or,
or, military?

B.88:  No, no, I'm, I'm still in the, I'm still a second lieutenant.

A.89:  Oh, okay.

B.90:  I just graduated in eighty-nine. 

A.91:  Oh, okay, okay.  You're, you're yo-, you're a bit younger than I thought.
Uh, back to the, the metric system.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  I've got a, uh, an automobile, an eighty-six Buick Skylark, that's got an
odometer, that's a digital odometer in both units.  In other words, I can push
a button and it's in metric, and I can push a button and it's in English,

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  And, I, I keep it in the metric --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- all the, all the time, and we were taking another couple to a ball game
last summer, and it was, uh, floating up there around a, a, a hundred, a
hundred, which is about --

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  -- is about sixty-two miles an hour.  And it was floating up there about a
hundred, and the wife of the couple looked at me.  She said, My God, slow
down, I didn't realize you were going this fast.

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  And so, we, we, you know, we have a hard time getting people, getting, uh,
uh, getting them to think metrically.

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  But, it's going to be a big psychological barrier, and I don't think that
we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to
them.

B.104:  Right,

A.105:  Because if we, if we keep doing that, it's, it's not going to work.

B.106:  (( )).

A.107:  But interestingly enough, we think it makes sense to, to think metrically
with our money.

B.108:  Oh, yeah.

A.109:  You know, ten cents makes a dime --

B.110:  Right.

A.111:  -- ten dimes makes a dollar.  Uh, which is basically thinking metrically.

B.112:  Well, the whole,

A.113:  But why twelve inches make a feet, a foot, and three feet make a yard
[laughter].

B.114:  Yeah, I don't,

A.115:  I [laughter] you know.

B.116:  Or the whole number system is digital, so, how can you have, uh, or it's,
it's base ten, rather, and so how can you have, how can you have these ...
