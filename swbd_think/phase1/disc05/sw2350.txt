========================================================================

A.1:  Hi, Debbie.  How are you?  [child]. 

B.2:  Oh, I'm just fine [child] [TV].

A.3:  What do you think of this weather?   

B.4:  Oh, it's been beautiful here lately.    

A.5:  Oh, I love it.   

B.6:  Yeah.  I was, I was glad that Easter was nice because, 

A.7:  Yeah.   

B.8:  because, sounds like you have a child, too [laughter]. 

A.9:  Yes, you can hear her, huh?  

B.10:  Yeah.  I've, I've got a two year old and, 

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice.

A.13:  Yeah, I have a four year old and a one year old.   

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  So, uh, yeah, I'm glad it was nice too.  

B.16:  #We had a,# 

A.17:  #I got a chance# to, to go outside and,  

B.18:  Yeah.   

A.19:  just have a nice day.  

B.20:  [Breathing].

A.21:  The, um, I remember last year, wasn't it raining #a lot this, yeah,#

B.22:  #It was raining last year.  ((We had)),#

A.23:  all that flooding and everything [noise] {sounds like water running}.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  I'm glad,  

B.26:  #((Wa-, i-,)),#
 
A.27:  #we don't# have that this year, so far.   

B.28:  Oh, oh, it was awfully rainy last year.  It was a, it was a very, very wet
spring.  Remember when they had all that flooding down, uh, south of downtown,

A.29:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.30:  #all# those people got flooded out.   

A.31:  We live just north of Trinity Mills and,  

B.32:  Oh.  

A.33:  it floods there,  

B.34:  #Did it?#

A.35:  #you know,# quite a lot.  Um, it's not, it doesn't usually damage any
businesses or anything, but you can't get off of thirty-five.

B.36:  Oh, really?  

A.37:  To, um, 

B.38:  I di-,

A.39:  to go to Home Depot and that's a problem [laughter].  

B.40:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Oh, gosh, yes, uh, the [laughter], a lot of people go
there [laughter] [sniffing].

A.41:  Yes [laughter]. Or Target for that matter, now.

B.42:  [Sniffing] Yeah.  I'm, I'm, we're not from Texas, we're from further, we're
from Missouri,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  so it's, it's, ev-, the weather down here is a lot different than, than
it is uh, uh, at home [laughter].

A.45:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We're not from Texas, either.  Um, we're, I grew up in
Pennsylvania, so.

B.46:  Oh, so you're really [laughter],

A.47:  Yeah, it, it's not like this in #Pennsylvania  [laughter].#

B.48:  #No.#  I like the winters, but I don't like the summers down here.  #It,#

A.49:  #It's# awfully hot.   

B.50:  it's terribly hot in the summer here.   

A.51:  Yeah. 

B.52:  I just, when we moved down here, our, we had a, our vehicle didn't have an
air conditioner [laughter].

A.53:  Oh, you're kidding.   

B.54:  I'm not, well we didn't, well, i-, we really, really don't need it very
much in Missouri where we're from.

A.55:  Sure.  

B.56:  But, um, oh, we suffered that first summer.  We traded that thing in
[laughter],

A.57:  Oh, I'm sure.

B.58:  as soon as we could, because it just, it's indispensable down here to
have air conditioning.

A.59:  I, I think you would probably, ooh [laughter].  

B.60:  It would be terrible.   

A.61:  Down here, yeah, I'd , j-, I, think it's a necessity.  We, um, we have, uh,
I guess we bought the, my car in Colorado,

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  that's where we, we moved from,  

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  and, uh, so we, we had a feeling we would be coming back this way, and
again there they don't sell all the cars with air conditioning.  It's,

B.66:  Yeah.   

A.67:  you know, it's really a, not,  

B.68:  It's,

A.69:  it's almost a luxury.   

B.70:  Oh, it is, you know, uh,

A.71:  We didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything.  

B.72:  Oh, yeah, that would be nice.  Oh, I, I get the, the, our electric bill in
here July and August is just,

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  about kills me,

A.75:  #Yes, it does.#

B.76:  #it's because it's# so hot.  Because I don't think they build them as
energy efficient down here as they do up in the north.

A.77:  No, I don't #think so either.#   

B.78:  #I just really don't.#  Th-,  

A.79:  No.   

B.80:  Because of the wi-, winter [laughter], 

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  I kind of miss winter.  Since it, it didn't do anything down here this
winter.

A.83:  Oh, no, we didn't even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms.

B.84:  No, we didn't, no, we didn't, did we? 

A.85:  No.  Isn't that surprising?  [child_yelling].

B.86:  That wa-, that is surprising.  And I, I, it was, uh, really odd.
[sniffing] But we went home to Missouri at, at, at Christmas,

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  and i-, we had, well, we ran into town and in the ice,

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot.

A.91:  Oh, my gosh.   

B.92:  [Laughter] So we got our fill, we went home at Christmas [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter] Well, you know, we lived in Colorado for four years, I guess.

B.94:  Uh-huh. 

A.95:  So and we, you know, we had a lot of snow and I,  

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  I really don't miss that.  My husband says he certainly doesn't mind sh-,
missing the shoveling, I mea-,

B.98:  Yeah.   

A.99:  we had a big sidewalk and [laughter],  

B.100:  Yeah.   

A.101:  he didn't like that at all.  But I don't know,

B.102:  I'd rather have the snow than the ice.   

A.103:  Yea-, oh, definitely.   

B.104:  Because in Missouri we have a, we have a lot of ice, 

A.105:  Uh-huh.   

B.106:  and snow, 

A.107:  [Throat_clearing].

B.108:  but, uh, but the, the ice is really bad [sniffing] because it knocks out
power lines and, and you just, you just absol-, at least when you've got snow,
just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles.

A.109:  That's right.   

B.110:  So the ice, you know, that's, that's a whole, you d-, you don't need a four
wheel drive vehicle, you sit and spin.

A.111:  It doesn't matter, right.   

B.112:  [Laughter] Uh. 

A.113:  Colorado wasn't bad for that because, um, it was so, at least in Colorado
Springs where we lived, it was so sunny most of the time,

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  that at, right after it snowed, it would almost always be a bright sunny
day,

B.116:  That's a-,

A.117:  and all of the roads would be clear.  You'd still have the snow on the
yard.

B.118:  Yeah.   

A.119:  The kids could play in it, but it would be a bright sunny day and, #you
know,#

B.120:  #That would be# nice.

A.121:  it wou-, it would melt and you could drive around and it was really #no
big deal.#

B.122:  #Did you all work# at T I, uh, T I Colorado Springs?      

A.123:  Yeah.   

B.124:  Oh, okay,  

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  we got, [sniffing] we had a lot of people from my husband's old group
that moved out there.

A.127:  Really?   

B.128:  Yeah.  And they're still, they're still out there though.  

A.129:  That's good [laughter].   

B.130:  Uh [laughter],   

A.131:  They scaled down quite a bit, #they have a lot of changes out there
lately.#

B.132:  #Did, oh, the, they are everywhere.#  They,

A.133:  That's true.  Certainly not localized [laughter].  

B.134:  [Laughter] No [laughter] [sniffing].  

A.135:  But we n-, I don't know, I, I don't really miss the snow.  I miss the
change of seasons myself.

B.136:  Yes.  Uh-huh. 

A.137:  The Fall is what I #really miss from Pennsylvania.# 

B.138:  #It just, everything just kind of gives up# and dies here [laughter].

A.139:  Yeah.  It just turns brown and makes a mess [laughter].   

B.140:  [Laughter].    

A.141:  Nothing pretty about it.   

B.142:  No, it j-, the, the trees just go to about the first of December and then
just, oh, well, it's time to die [laughter].  So it just, it's just an ugly
mess [laughter].

A.143:  My folks don't live in, uh, Pennsylvania anymore, but for a long time I
would purposely, [baby], go back and visit in October,

B.144:  Yeah.   

A.145:  just so I could see the trees and the fall and #such a pretty time.#

B.146:  #Yeah, my grand, my# grandparents took a tour of the, oh, of the northeast
this past Fall,

A.147:  Uh-huh. 

B.148:  and they really enjoyed it.  They said that the color was just fantastic
{pause} #this year.#

A.149:  #It really is# and I think you don't, I, growing up there, I just assumed
that's how #it was all over,#

B.150:  #Well, yeah.#   

A.151:  the country.  I never really realized it was such a local thing [baby] I,

B.152:  Yeah, well, the Maple tree, the Map-, Maple trees have a lot to do with it.
Maples make a lot of nice color.

A.153:  Yeah.   

B.154:  Which there are none down here.   

A.155:  Nope. 

B.156:  It's too hot for them.  We have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri, so we
have [sniffing] a lot of nice color too, but, uh, the northeast really has the
corner on that [laughter].

A.157:  Yeah.  They, they do [laughter].      

B.158:  On the, on the real nice color.  But, uh, I, I like spring, I like, I like
the reason it's, I like that spring comes quickly here [laughter].

A.159:  Yeah.  I do too.  I'm ready to get outside and get the kids outside,

B.160:  Yes, [sigh] yes. 

A.161:  and seems to j-, even my one year old, it really changes her temperament,
she can be in here all grouchy and,

B.162:  #Oh.# 

A.163:  #put# her outside and, #hey, she's fine.# 

B.164:  #Oh, definitely.#  Oh, my, m-, my two year old, she hates to be p-, in,
indoors anyway.

A.165:  Uh-huh. 

B.166:  And just, well, I think long winters would really mess up, mess her up.
[laughter] Uh.

A.167:  My, my son b-, he was born in Colorado, and when we first moved here, um,
he was three, I guess, just turned three.

B.168:  Uh-huh. 

A.169:  And for the first week we were here, it was over a hundred every single
day,

B.170:  #Oh.#   

A.171:  #it# was in July.   

B.172:  Yeah.   

A.173:  And he was lethargic.  He,  

B.174:  Yeah.   

A.175:  really, he wasn't used to the heat at all.   

B.176:  Huh-uh.   

A.177:  He would go outside and he, 

B.178:  [Sniffing].

A.179:  would turn into a zombie [laughter], and walk around like he didn't know
what was going on.

B.180:  #I know.#   

A.181:  #But he's# used to it now, I think.  He's, I mean, he certainly doesn't
like the heat, but he doesn't become lethargic anymore [laughter].

B.182:  Yeah.  Well, when we moved down here it was, it was June and, and it was
just like a shock.

A.183:  Uh-huh [laughter].   

B.184:  How, oh, being, it's just so much different, I mean, the heat.  When it
gets hot in Missouri it, it, it will get hot for a couple of days in the, in
the, in the mid to upper nineties and people think it's terrible, and then it,
i-, d-, and it always just goes away.

A.185:  Uh-huh. 

B.186:  It just, I just couldn't, it was just oppressive, the heat down here.

A.187:  [Noise] That's a good word for it [laughter].

B.188:  And I just couldn't, um, [laughter] make my family understand.  This is
hot [laughter].

A.189:  [Laughter] Really hot.   

B.190:  Uh, so,

@@A.191:  Well, it's been good talking to you.   

B.192:  Well, nice talking to you too.   

A.193:  Hopefully we'll have some more good weather but,   

B.194:  Oh yeah [laughter].   

A.195:  we'll see.      

B.196:  Okay.  Take it easy.   

A.197:  All righty.   

B.198:  #Bye-bye# [/child] [/TV].  

A.199:  #Bye-bye# [noise] [/child].
