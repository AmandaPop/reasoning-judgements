============================================================================

B.1:  Well, this is kind of ironic because I work in T I -s legal department.

A.2:  Do you? 

B.3:  And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, um,
lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time.

A.4:  Uh-huh. 

B.5:  And, uh, when was it, a couple weeks ago I was asked to go to, uh, jury
duty I, I wasn't selected but, um, for some of our cases in particular we
have, um, very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents
and such.

A.6:  Sure. 

B.7:  And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just, you
know happen to be selected in our jury, to understand what we're talking
about.

A.8:  Well, I do think that the cases like the, uh, oh, say something like Texaco
versus Pennzoil,

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  or, or the Texaco Pennzoil problem, 

B.11:  Uh-huh. 

A.12:  uh, is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand,
and,

B.13:  Right.  

A.14:  really should have some better way where people who understand both the
circumstances and the complex issues involved, should handle cases like that.

B.15:  Yeah, you know, some (( )) I don't, you always have the option, now in
criminal I guess you always have a jury, but in civil cases you have the
option of whether you want a jury or not.

A.16:  Oh, is that right?

B.17:  Yeah, and in some incidences I think they ought to, ought not to have a
jury,

A.18:  Yeah.  

B.19:  um [laughter]. 

A.20:  Okay, boy.  Or, uh, or there should be some way where it could be opted for
them not to have a jury.  Uh, I was only on one jury ever,

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  so far in my life, and, uh, it really was a pretty trivial, case and it
seemed to me all the time I was thinking of all these people in the courtroom
over the case that involved, oh, a couple thousand dollars I think,

B.23:  Uh-huh.  

A.24:  it was, it was really just, uh, uh, terrific waste of everybody's time
and money.

B.25:  Um.

A.26:  And it finally ended up that, uh, even though we had reached a verdict
before we were allowed to give it, they settled the case.

B.27:  Oh. 

A.28:  They wo-, they had settled while we were deliberating. 

B.29:  Yeah. 

A.30:  Now, the one thing I did approve of there was that we didn't have to be
unanimous because it was a civil case.

B.31:  Uh-huh. 

A.32:  And, uh, we were split, uh, ten to two so, it was, uh, a good thing that,
[laughter] it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that
trivial.

B.33:  Yeah, well, um, I've never fully served, I mean, I've been asked twice to
go down but I didn't get elected on the panel, but, I know, that, um, for a
lot of the civil cases it's rare, I mean, if your a lawyer, um, there, you
could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom [laughter],
there's a lot of attorneys like that, that never get to the courtroom.  Some,
their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom, but even in, um,
litigation which is doing lawsuits, is a lot of times that you never get to
the courtroom itself and,

A.34:  Well, I think that the trial in a sense, is kind of a threat to hold over
people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court,

B.35:  Yeah. 

A.36:  because it does cost so much money. 

B.37:  But it's a shame that, oh, it's not so bad for the court system because the
money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and
effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by
going to the court and usually it's the scare kind of, of the jury because you
really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel.

A.38:  Uh-huh. 

B.39:  You could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you're very
much right but the jury may or may not see it that way,

A.40:  Sure.  

B.41:  so you get a little antic-, you know, anxious there and go well, you
know,

A.42:  Yeah.  

B.43:  I don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because
sometimes, you know, the juries come down with a result and you go, gee
[laughter].

A.44:  Yeah, I was a witness in a case, in a criminal case. 

B.45:  Uh-huh. 

A.46:  And it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much
evidence was excluded,

B.47:  Um.

A.48:  and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the
defendant, I, on as far as I could tell, very flimsy evidence and two perjured
testimonies.

B.49:  Oh, really? 

A.50:  And I knew the people involved, both the people who d and the people who,
uh, were defendants.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  And, yeah, I think that was just a, a horrible miscarriage of justice
because of the, uh, you know, staying by the absolute strict rules and not
allowing things to be presented to the jury, that, uh, were highly irrelevant
to the case and could, I thought, have established the defendant's innocence.

B.53:  Yeah. 

A.54:  So, uh, I do, although I'm a lawyer's daughter and I have lawyer's,

B.55:  Oh ((really))?  

A.56:  and judges on both sides of the family, and uncles and cousins and things
like that, I really think that we have gotten into much, too legalistic of
society and that we, we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and
far too little on achieving justice.

B.57:  Yeah, and it seems a lot of times that, uh, especially in criminals that,
their rights are so protected but what about the rights of, you know, the rest
of society, I mean, we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the
law,

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  um, and we protect him so much, but what about the rest of the society,
you know, what are we doing for them, we're kind of, you know, forgetting
about them and, I think sometimes that a criminal should kind of, if he breaks
law, especially it he's a repeater, the law shouldn't just always cover for
him,

A.60:  #Well, and then in a lot of,# 

B.61:  #that some of his rights ((as))# should be taken. 

A.62:  Yeah, in criminal cases, uh, for instance, you can't bring up prior
convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case.  And it
seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know
somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime,

B.63:  Yeah.  

A.64:  (( )) now it's possible that he didn't commit the (( )) but [laughter],
the likelihood ((certainly)) ((tilts it)).

B.65:  Yeah. 

A.66:  With a record like that.  And,

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  (( )) that was one of the things that we're not allowed to, was not
allowed in the, uh, trial I went to, though, uh, one of the two people who
gave the perjured testimony, had a long criminal record and had been, you
know, a real sleaze bag.

B.69:  Um,

A.70:  And he came in and was presented to the court as a (( )) standing young man
who had, uh, been in seminary to become a priest, and,

B.71:  [Laughter].  

A.72:  you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow, but I
happen to know his background and I know that he would have sold out his
mother for, uh, uh, shorter sentence.

B.73:  Jeez. 

A.74:  And, you know, it's, it's really annoying when the, I asked the defense
attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been
in.  He said that, that was barred, uh, by the court.

B.75:  Um, 

A.76:  So, we do have some problems and it seems to me that, uh, maybe it's time
to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles [laughter].

B.77:  [Laughter].  

A.78:  and start over.  And then make a legal system that carefully protects
people but, uh, where you, 

B.79:  Yeah, I'd even go for, for trying to get some truth out of the witness
stand if they come up with some pretty reliable, uh, um, lie detector tests
that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the
truth.

A.80:  Yeah. 

B.81:  [Laughter]. 

A.82:  Yeah, that would be ((wrongful)). 

B.83:  [Laughter] Yeah, you know.

A.84:  Sure would. 

B.85:  Yeah, I witnessed one trial many years ago when I was first, um, studying
to be a paralegal and, uh, uh, they barred priors on this, uh, person and they
never then told us, I guess, because priors had a reason as to why these two
people were very much in hatred of each other.

A.86:  Um.

B.87:  And they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against
each other and the crime was, uh, uh, attempt to commit murder, you know,

A.88:  Um. 

B.89:  but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee,
you know, that's,

A.90:  And you think that would be relevant.

B.91:  Yeah, you know, because they, they told us in school that, you know, crime
has to be an intent, you know, has to be not just the act but you have to
intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things, you know,

A.92:  Right. 

B.93:  but they never told us why these two people, hated themselves or if one
had done something to, you know, really aggravate the other there was never
any motive,

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  given and, and I had a tough time with that and, and being a person who
saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did, because we were just
observing, you know, there in the courtroom,

A.96:  Uh-huh. 

B.97:  at the end of it all, I still didn't know [laughter]. 

A.98:  Yeah, right.

B.99:  I still have a lot of reasonable doubts and I've seen everything presented
and, you know, they just haven't done a real complete case here to my
thinking.

A.100:  Uh-huh.  

B.101:  #I don't know that I want to,#

A.102:   #I think so, and I,#  

B.103:  sit on a jury like that and you'd still, you know, I want ask some
questions here [laughter].

A.104:  Yeah, that's something I thought would be a very good idea of when juries
come in they are told just to shut up and listen.

B.105:  Uh-huh. 

A.106:  And it seems to me that you'd get a lot more, uh, information if your
questions were heard,

B.107:  Uh-huh.  

A.108:  if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things, or if, or the lawyers
things or even the judge.

B.109:  Right. 

A.110:  But particularly the witnesses. 

B.111:  Right.  Yeah, allow them to, uh, go back and, and deliberate and, uh, you
know, after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want
answered like the next day, bring those people back,

A.112:  Or if they would allow them to, uh, give broader answers, they, it's really
kind of, uh, choreographed.  It's like a script has been written when people
testify.  They aren't testifying really in their own words,

B.113:  Right. 

A.114:  Yeah, I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ...
