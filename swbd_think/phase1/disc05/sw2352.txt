===========================================================================

A.1:  The topic is how we can, h-, how, what is our --

B.2:  Community doing on recycling.

@A.3:  -- and how, and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling.

B.4:  Yeah.  Sounds like an exciting one.

A.5:  Well, it is to me, uh, because we're, our particular little household is
hot and heavy.  We have our glass bin, our tin bin, and our, uh, papers that
we accumulate and recycle an-,

B.6:  Uh, where do you live?

A.7:  Plano, Texas.

B.8:  Do they have the, uh, collection points where you,

A.9:  Yes, they certainly do.

B.10:  Oh, okay. 

A.11:  They certainly do.

B.12:  Yes.  We're, we're really behind the times here, about all we've got is
paper recycling.

A.13:  #Where are you?# 

B.14:  #And aluminum from cans.# Uh, North Carolina,

A.15:  Oh, I see.

B.16:  Uh, I b-, I keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans, I can
keep those, if I ever get them, I don't drink Cokes or anything like that so I
don't usually get any aluminum cans, but that's, that's all they've got set
up.  They've got a, uh, central collection point at the J C Park and, uh,
that's it.

A.17:  Well, our libraries and then the, uh, Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back
of them --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and when you recycle glass that seems to make a lot of difference and
you have the colored glass and the clear glass --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and the paper and the tin cans.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  So, when you get all of that going it is, it, it occupies a space in your
garage but you very quickly get use to it --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- and we do not,

B.26:  And, and you, and you also get rid of it so,

A.27:  Sure.  Well, you know, we haul it off i-, once in a while, and we also do
not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not 
fill,

B.28:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's, but I just let it sit there and let it, uh, let
it, uh, rot away and it's a good fertilizer.

A.29:  Well, this is Texas it doesn't set, it blows.

B.30:  Oh [laughter].  That's right.

A.31:  Gives,

B.32:  Surprised you even have grass there [laughter].

A.33:  Lots of grass, give it twenty-four hours and the whole things gone,

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  there's no problem.  Someone else is worrying about and we have somebody
else's but, uh, the problem that bothers me more are, uh, you know, I think,
the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local
government, you know --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- if there's, if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city
management --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- it will happen.  What upsets me, there was an article, and I'm sorry I
was reading a book at the same time, it was on our Texas beaches --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and they are s-, our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest
beaches in the United States --

B.42:  Uh.

A.43:  -- and it's not because of litter it's because of boats.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  The, if you could think of the basin, the Texas gulf coast --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- as a large swirling --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- vacuum, things that are thrown from ships --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- swirl in and,

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  swirl in to our beaches -- 

B.54:  Exactly.

A.55:  -- and it kills some of our animals.

B.56:  Uh.

A.57:  There's, there's a professor down there that has, Texas A and M, has a
nice size facility at Port Aransas --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were
killed, you know, by plastic.

B.60:  Uh.

A.61:  It's horrible.

B.62:  Yeah.  I've,

A.63:  It's a gross collection.

B.64:  seen, I've seen pictures of, uh, seals that have gotten, uh, gotten their
necks stuck,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  in those, uh, plastic, uh, oh, what do you call them, they hold --

A.67:  #Yes.#

B.68:  -- #six packs together.  Those plast-,# 

A.69:  #Whatever those, thi-, nasty things are.#

B.70:  #Yeah.# Because they, they're playful and they think this is fun we'll
stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they
can't get out and they strangle,

A.71:  That's right.  Or they starve to death because they --

B.72:  #or they starve.#

A.73:  -- #they can't swallow.# 

B.74:  because they can't eat. 

A.75:  Or drown.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  It's, that's --

A.79:  Terrific.

B.80:  -- yeah, that's, that's terrible.  I mean I like seals.

A.81:  Well, they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some, uh,
plastic --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- and it starved to death.  It couldn't,

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  it couldn't swallow.  It was pitiful.

B.86:  Yeah.  That's wh-, it bothers me the same thing about, uh, netting tuna
they, they get so many dolphins and,

A.87:  Well, they're suppose to h-, be working t-, around that.

B.88:  Well, they keep saying that but I'll tell you I, I saw a program not too
many months ago, I think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery, one of
the two, and they're talking about all these people who are making, uh, all
these boast that, you know, we're dolphin free and,

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  all that kind of stuff, and they just, they showed them to be absolute
liars.

A.91:  Oh, really.

B.92:  Yeah.  Because, you know, people like Starkist, they don't go out there and
catch the fish, they buy the fish from other people --

A.93:  Sure.  So,

B.94:  -- and, and all these people do is tell them, oh, no, no, no, no, we have,
we have these safety nets now and,

A.95:  Trust us, it's our nets.

B.96:  Sure. 

A.97:  Everything is great. 

B.98:  That's right, trust us.

A.99:  Go back sleep and don't worry. 

B.100:  Yeah.  They had some, they had some, uh, uh, undercover film of,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  these people and they, they netted, oh, I mean dozens of dolphins and
they killed probably half of them.

A.103:  Oh, that's just sickening {Background slamming noise}.

B.104:  Yeah, it is, I like dolphins, too.

A.105:  Well, and the other thing, uh, we have an endangered species turtle, a
Ridley's turtle --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- that's on the Texas Gulf Coast --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- and their, our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles
can swim through --

B.110:  Right.  Right.

A.111:  -- huge fight going on.  Uh, the shrimpers just say great.  You want us
it put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do?  This makes
sense to us, we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in
our nets.  I can see their point.  I, I guess if my family was terribly hungry
I wouldn't be as humanistic as I am because I don't have that problem.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  So, it's, it's really a hard, hard issue to say what's right and what's
not.

B.114:  Well, I think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of
shrimp farming.

A.115:  Oh, this is,

B.116:  I mean, there's, there's, I, I don't see any reason why they can't, uh, I
mean, there's a lot of places.  Japan, for instance, have shrimp farms.  I
mean they, they, they raise shrimp --

A.117:  Like they raise catfish now.

B.118:  -- jus-, just like they raise anything else.  And, and, you can did it and
the, uh, the, the collection is very easy and you don't go around killing
everything else that happens to be in the area.

A.119:  Well, part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so
little money.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  We have a lot of Vietnamese --

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  -- fisher people --

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  -- and y-, they support their whole family on less than,

B.126:  On fishing, yeah.

A.127:  than I had for lunch --

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  -- anyway.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  And of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that -- 

B.132:  Yeah.  Well, it's,

A.133:  -- and it, it all goes back to the government spending enough money, high
enough priorities, on things like that,

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  that they it would have to be government owned or s-, financed if not
controlled --

B.136:  Yeah.

A.137:  -- because the financing simply isn't there because it's one ever those
cottage industries that, uh, the --

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  -- very poor keep going but can't do anything to change.

B.140:  Yeah.  (( )) Right.  Yeah, they're, they're in it for a matter of 
survival --

A.141:  Sure.

B.142:  -- not, not environmentalist.

A.143:  Well, and, you know they could, they could be terribly sorry they're
killing the turtles, you know.

B.144:  Oh, yeah, they, they probably are.

A.145:  Probably are.  Probably are.

B.146:  Of course, I don't understand why they don't, if they're going to kill them
they might as well eat the turtles too.

A.147:  Well they may do it.

B.148:  They probably do.

A.149:  Whether they like it or not they may do it, you know.

B.150:  Oh, turtle is good.

A.151:  That's correct.  Turtle is very good, that's the other thing wrong with --

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  -- the poor turtles [laughter].

B.154:  Yeah.  Yeah, I had turtle when I was in Vietnam, didn't know
it was turtle at the time because I wouldn't have eaten it [laughter].

A.155:  Well, in my unreformed days I have had turtle soup in New Orleans and I can
tell you it's fabulous --

B.156:  Yeah. I,

A.157:  -- but, of course, a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it.

B.158:  Yeah.  That's true [laughter].

A.159:  [Laughter] Well, it's no telling what the turtle really taste like.

B.160:  Well, hopefully it's real turtle too.

A.161:  Well it, maybe it wasn't, you know, who, who knows what I had but it was
fabulous.

B.162:  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's the other thing, I mean, you never know what
they are putting in there, you know.  Oh, this is turtle soup, you know --

A.163:  Great.  Sure it is.

B.164:  -- Okay.  Sure.  Right.

A.165:  Charge fifteen. Keep moving.

B.166:  Yeah, why not.  Give it fancy name and put a high price tag on it.

A.167:  As long as it's French.

B.168:  It's probably, it's probably Campbells or something.

A.169:  [Laughter].

B.170:  [Laughter].

A.171:  Oh, dear.  Well, I don't have any, my big solutions all go back to elect
politicians that are more sensitive because I think we can't do it ourselves.

B.172:  No, I, I, no I don't think we will because you, you need some kind of
organization for it and,

A.173:  You need clout.

B.174:  Yeah, and the prob-, the problem, I mean we've got all these environmental
organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's, th-,
the end results is, is just anality, nobody is getting anything done and, and
I think there needs to be a concerted effort, you know, say, okay, here's a
problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're
going to do this and you put your resources here, something like that I mean
just,

A.175:  It'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little
branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing,
you know, like the woman down the tip of Texas that, that calls her turtles
and kisses everyone of them everyday.  She's terribly interested in her
turtles she could care less about shrimp --

B.176:  Uh-huh.

A.177:  -- and on she goes, you, this kind of thing everybody's got such a
splintered interest.

B.178:  Yeah, well that's, that's what I mean about all these groups, they're  
so,

A.179:  Yeah, that's exactly it.

B.180:  yeah, they're so, uh,

A.181:  And there's no way to, to make one group more interested or sensitive to
the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line
which means money.

B.182:  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, ideally they would all combine together and pool
there resources and, and, then they could have their agenda for all these
different problems and come up with solutions but, I mean, you know, work at
it as an organization not as a little group, (( )) they just don't get
anywhere.

A.183:  That's why I keep going back to the politicians (( )), it has to have --

B.184:  That's right.  That's right.

A.185:  -- some focal spot.  We, we need, uh, we need an environmental Ralph Nader
type.

B.186:  Uh-huh.

A.187:  Which,

B.188:  Exactly,

A.189:  [Laughter].

B.190:  Yeah, somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work.

A.191:  Right.

B.192:  I mean we, we've been at this for, for so many years now and jus-, and
just, and nothing is happening.
