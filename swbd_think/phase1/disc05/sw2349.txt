==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  All right.

@B.3:  Um, I, I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement,

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.  I think,

A.6:  Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what
young means.

B.7:  Yeah, yeah.  I think that it probably would be a, a good program.  I think
probably two years is too long.

A.8:  Yeah.

B.9:  I think maybe a year would be,

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  the longest.

A.12:  Yeah, you're prob-, probably right, two years might be a little too long.

B.13:  Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people
who have no desire to be there in the first place,

A.14:  That's right.  That,

B.15:  I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.

A.16:  that would be the problem.  Sure would.

B.17:  Yeah.  So I think it would be a good thing though, 

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a
thing.

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  to get out there and do so.

A.22:  Yeah, or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it.

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know, 

B.25:  Right.

A.26:  I'm not sure what but,

B.27:  Right.  College credit is a good idea because,

A.28:  I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know, a super do salary
of any kind. 

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  but that, that kind of takes away from public service.

B.31:  That's right [laughter].  Yeah, they probably couldn't do anything
monetary, but I think, giving,

A.32:  But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail,

B.33:  giving some kind of college credit,

A.34:  that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know
you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know.  I'm not sure that would
be a terrifically good idea.

B.35:  No, I don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on
how the public service programs are set up and I'm not that familiar with them
to know,

A.36:  I'm not either really.

B.37:  But, you know, if, a. a lot of people flat can't afford to.

A.38:  That's right.  

B.39:  You know,

A.40:  That's right.

B.41:  and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial
situations,

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  where they have to be working all the time.

A.44:  That's right.  Absolutely.  They need, you-,

B.45:  So, it's, it's a really tough question.

A.46:  young families, whatever,

B.47:  That's right.

A.48:  they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.

B.49:  Yeah,

A.50:  Oh,

B.51:  and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then
that, that postpones their college,

A.52:  That's right, uh-huh.

B.53:  for a year and that would upset a lot of people too,

A.54:  Uh-huh, it sure would.

B.55:  because they just want to get on,

A.56:  It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like
that, I would think.

B.57:  Yeah.  I, you know, I think it would be good for a lot of people to get
involved in that kind of program,

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.

A.60:  Yeah. Yeah.

B.61:  it has to be something that's voluntary.  You know, which is pretty much
the way it is now.  They might,

A.62:  That's right.  I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know,
what, what programs are out there.

B.63:  Yeah, and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it
mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better.

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs,

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  and tell them that we need your help, and, 

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  and you've a choice of where you want to go.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some
results out of it.

A.74:  Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own,
own, in their own town or city,

B.75:  Yeah, in their own community, right.

A.76:  yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way
around the world, or something.

B.77:  Yeah, that's true [laughter].  Most of them probably wouldn't do
something like that.

A.78:  That's right.

B.79:  Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from
their parents [laughter].

A.80:  Yeah, that's, that's true too.  That's true too.

B.81:  But, they would have to be supported in some way, and I'm not sure that
tho-, those programs are available to do that.

A.82:  Yeah, yeah.  Me neither.  And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality
job would they do, you know,

B.83:  Right.

A.84:  Just sit around for their year, or would they really, you know, make
a contribution of some kind.

B.85:  Right, exactly.

A.86:  Yeah, it's tough.  It's tough.

B.87:  Yeah, it is tough.  It's, and I don't know who's even proposing it,

A.88:  Yeah.

B.89:  or, or how they plan on implementing it,

A.90:  Yeah.

B.91:  if they do. 

A.92:  I, I'm not sure either.  But, I think, there would have to be a lot more,
you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, 

B.93:  Yeah.

A.94:  let's do this, you know.

B.95:  Yeah.  I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them. 

A.96:  Yeah.

B.97:  You know, it be, it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more 
time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money. 

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  They wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.

A.100:  Yeah.  That's right.

B.101:  You go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience, get them all
in the auditorium,

A.102:  Yeah.

B.103:  and  you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or
something,

A.104:  Uh-huh.

B.105:  and, I think, that they could get some results from that, 

A.106:  Right.

B.107:  because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
but they don't know where to go to, to,

A.108:  That's right.

B.109:  to do anything.

A.110:  Yeah.  That's a real waste too.  It really is.

B.111:  Yeah, it is.  It really is.

A.112:  I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you
know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,

B.113:  Right.

A.114:  that was, that was a big thing with him. 

B.115:  Yeah, yeah.

A.116:  And, I guess even back to Kennedy, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy
may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really
interested in things like that.  

B.117:  Uh-huh.

A.118:  I just don't hear much about it anymore.  Like I say, I don't even know
what programs are, are even ongoing now, you know.

B.119:  I don't either [laughter]. That's one, 

A.120:  Anyway, it's a tough question.

B.121:  Yeah, it is a tough question.

A.122:  Okay, well thanks for your time.  I enjoyed talking to you.

B.123:  Sure, same here.

A.124:  Okay, take care.

B.125:  Ta-, you too.	

A.126:  Bye-bye.

B.127:  Bye.
