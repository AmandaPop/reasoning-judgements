throughout the tape.  

============================================================

A.1:  Well, which ones are yours?

B.2:  Uh, my favorite, I watch the most, is L A LAW.  It seems to be, you know,
it's on the evening time when I have more time to watch T V, and I watch that
one and ...

A.3:  Yeah, I don't watch L A LAW much.  That's usually when I'm fighting to put
my kids to bed.

B.4:  Uh-huh, [laughter].

A.5:  Uh, I like to watch the shows that come on from seven to nine on A B C,

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  you know, everyday of the week just about.  

B.8:  What are those?

A.9:  Oh, uh, like on Monday nights that's on C B S is MAJOR DAD and, uh,

B.10:  Uh-huh.  [sniffing].  I've never seen that one.

A.11:  uh, it's about a guy that's in the Marine Corp.  

B.12:  Yeah, I know what it's about I've just never seen, you know, saw it.

A.13:  Ye-, oh, well, it's a cute show, you know.

B.14:  Is it?

A.15:  Yeah.  And WHO'S THE BOSS, that's my favorite there,

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  I just like Tony Danza for some reason. 

B.18:  Uh-huh.   

A.19:  And, uh,  

B.20:  Yeah, that one's a funny one.  

A.21:  Yeah, well, m-, you know ...  

B.22:  One show I can't stand is MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. 

A.23:  O-, I don't watch that one, I've never watched it, I ju-,

B.24:  It's on, I believe it's on Sundays,

A.25:  Yeah, i-,

B.26:  or something.  

A.27:  Well, I know it's on Fox thirty-three and ...

B.28:  Yeah, and it's kind of,

A.29:  I don't know,

B.30:  disgusting.

A.31:  I, I just, the sight of Al Bundy and the woman just kind of turn my
stomach.

B.32:  Oh, I know,   

A.33:  [laughter].

B.34:  and then they're always grinding, you know it's just not ...

A.35:  Yeah, [laughter].

B.36:  Yeah, [laughter].

A.37:  Now, uh,

B.38:  I don't care for those two but, no, I like L A LAW, it, you know, it seems
like it, [child], I guess because it continues on each time and
it keeps you interested.

A.39:  It's like a nighttime soap, isn't it?

B.40:  Yeah, almost.  About, it's about what it seems to be like, so ...

A.41:  N-, well, I, I really don't know about it I think Harry Hamlin's on it.

B.42:  Yeah, it could be, I don't know that the char-, you know, the people that,
that much, so.

A.43:  Ye-, I'm not sure, I just,  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  uh, for some reason or another that name's sticking out.  Uh,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  I do know they, see most of the shows I watch they got cute guys on them,
[laughter],

B.48:  Uh-huh, [laughter].

A.49:  you know, uh, uh, let's see, I'm trying to think of his name, uh, I, like
I say, I've never watched it.  I, you know, I see the previews and that's it.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  I like on Sundays, I like, you know, AMERICA'S FAM-, uh, FUNNIEST
VIDEOS and ...

A.51:  Oh, yeah, my son loves that.   

B.52:  Yeah, I like to watch that one.  I don't care for fu-, AMERICA'S FUNNIEST
PEOPLE, but I like the other one.

A.53:  Well, that ones the, the ho-, home videos is with, uh, what's his name?

B.54:  I can't remember the na-,  

A.55:  I know he c-,

B.56:  I'm not too much on, uh, you know, actors' names. 

A.57:  Ye-, well,

A.59:  he plays Danny Tanner on, uh,  

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  on FULL HOUSE.  Now,  

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  we watch that every Friday night.   

B.64:  Yeah, that's a good show.  

A.65:  Yeah.  My son loves Michelle, you know,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  he's about her age.  

B.68:  How old is your son?

A.69:  He's four, so,

B.70:  Oh, okay, [child].

A.71:  so, he likes Michelle.   

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  And, uh,

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  He, he likes THE SIMPSON'S too, but we don't watch them, you know, we just
got cable a while back and we didn't, you know, we didn't get any channels
except for,

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  uh, twelve and eight.   

B.78:  Well, [child_talking], see my, my husband likes, [noise], THE
SIMPSON'S and I don't care for it too much.  My kids, you know, sit there an
laugh with it when their dad laughs, but you know ...

A.79:  [/child_talking].  What's that?

B.80:  That, my, I don't care for THE SIMPSON'S too much, but my husband likes it,
so.

A.81:  W-, I don't either.  I don't, you know, uh ...

B.82:  I don't get the humor sometimes in it, so.

A.83:  Um, uh, I don't think it's for kids.  He's, he,

B.84:  No.

A.85:  he only watches it when we, uh, are flipping through channels and we
happen,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  to come across it.   

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  And the only reason he likes it is cartoons.   

B.90:  Right, because it's animated.

A.91:  Yeah,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  uh, he doesn't understand what they're saying and half the time I'm glad
of that.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  Uh, we don't, I stay away from thirty-three as often as I can.

B.96:  Yeah, I don't, we don't have cable so, um,

A.97:  Wha-,

B.98:  I don't watch too much television,  

A.99:  Well,

B.100:  you know.

A.101:  we have it, you know we're out here in Dennison.  We had to get cable
because of, uh, we only got two channels,

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  you know, and channel twelve's down here with us,  

B.104:  Uh-huh,

A.105:  and it just,  

B.106:  are you, you're in Dennison then?  

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  Okay, I'm in Garland, so.

A.109:  I have no idea where that is.

B.110:  Garland, Texas?

A.111:  Well, we just moved to Texas.

A.117:  Oh, okay.

B.118:  We're right between like Rowlett and Richardson and, and Mesquite, you
know.

A.119:  Okay, I'm sure we passed by it going to the Richardson a lot, uh, ...

B.120:  Yeah, yeah, you, you, Richard-, Garland is a little bit more to the east I
believe it would be, so.

A.121:  [noise], uh,

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  trying to think of what other shows I watch.  You like DOOGIE HOWSER?

B.124:  Uh, yeah, I do, I guess I like that one.

A.125:  [laughter], that's a cute show.

B.126:  Yeah, that's about, I, you know, I don't like too much ((T V)), you know, I
do have a few of my favorites, so.

A.127:  Uh, I know we're, we're constantly sitting in front of T V, I don't work,

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  and, uh, the way the weather was lately we've sat in front of the T V
and, uh, most of the time since we got cable, we stick with Nickelodeon.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  Uh, until the cartoons goes off and then we flip it over to, uh,
[child_talking], GENERAL HOSPITAL for an hour.

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  And, uh, that's the only soap I watch anymore.

B.134:  Yeah, well, we-, my hu-, kids like to watch,

A.135:  [noise] {Making a sh-, noise to a child}.

B.136:  you know, uh, SESAME STREET sometimes,

A.137:  U-,

B.138:  but, they, they're in more into watching their own videos, you know.

A.139:  Well, uh, my daughter likes SESAME STREET, she's two, [child_talking].

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  And sh-, she will sit down and watch SESAME STREET, but we've got BAMBI on
video,

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  and, uh, before she goes to bed she wants to watch BAMBI or MERMAID,

B.144:  Uh-huh.  Yeah,

A.145:  and then,

B.146:  that's what my kids do.  They have BAMBI, LITTLE MERMAID, you know, all,
PETER PAN, all those and then I check some out from the library, you know.

A.147:  Oh, yeah, we check them out from the library everyday.

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  O-, you know, every three days we go back and return them, and,

B.150:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.151:  get them back.  

B.152:  So that's what they like to do.  So, we seem to watch more videos for the
kids and then my husband's a T V watcher.  He's a sports nut,

A.153:  Oh,

B.154:  though.  

A.155:  I'm into sports too, so I,  

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  can't say nothing about that,

B.158:  Yeah,

A.159:  I, I, I'm,

B.160:  see my husband's one of these that will switch from game to game to catch
a little bit of every one, you know, [laughter], and so ...

A.161:  No, I like to stick to one game.

B.162:  Oh, not him, he'll watch a little bit of everything, so.  But I, you know,
and when now he starts doing that I just leave the room and go read,

A.163:  [laughter].

B.164:  or do something else because I can't handle it.  [laughter].  I'm one
that likes to sit and watch one show, so.

A.165:  Well, he got, mine got us out of that by not requesting the remote control
for the cable box.

B.166:  Uh-huh.  

A.167:  Uh, so we have to get up and flip the ch-, channels.   

B.168:  Oh, yeah, [laughter].  

A.169:  So, uh, we don't get our exercise because we don't change the channel,
[laughter].

B.170:  [laughter], well, that's one nice thing about remot-, you know, not having
a remote, you don't have to worry about your husband sw-, switching the
channels, so.  But, yeah, that's my, about my favorite, so.  [noise].

A.171:  [laughter].   

B.172:  Well, it's been nice talking to you,  

A.173:  Yeah, it was,

A.177:  Oh, how, where have you gotten them from?   

B.178:  Oh, Rochester, North Carolina, all over, so. 

A.179:  I've gotten one guy from San Francisco. 

B.180:  [child_talking].  Uh-huh.
