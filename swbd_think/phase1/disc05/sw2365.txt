A.1:  Hi. 

B.2:  [Children] [TV] [noise] {kitchen} Hi, uh, as a matter of fact
this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, uh, took on a painting
project in my bathroom and I had wallpaper up, I had to completely strip the
wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all
weekend because, uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls
down and that had to dry.  And then the spackling had to dry a day and then
the painting took another day.

A.3:  You didn't try re-, rewallpapering?  You just, uh,

B.4:  No.  I, I just painted. 

A.5:  Did you use a textured paint or,

B.6:  Uh, no.  Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth so, I just used a,
like a semigloss.

A.7:  Um. 

B.8:  And,

A.9:  Well, did you get good results? 

B.10:  Well, no, not really.  I need to, it, it looks so,

A.11:  [Noise] {Sounds like paper shuffling}.

B.12:  bad you can see where those spackling marks were.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  I need to, uh, either paper back over it or do something [sniffing].

A.15:  But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it? 

B.16:  Yeah.  It covered the spots pretty good but it didn't, excuse me, it
didn't, uh, uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.

A.17:  [/Noise] Well, we did a, uh, we moved, oh, last August and we're getting a
house, my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we
decided, we went to, ((I've forgotten)), one of the paint stores and they just
said, oh, you can get by, and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then
you can just paint right over the dark.

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  Well, more or less.  After about, uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable
but it kept, the, the dark it was, uh, just a real dark, uh, wood grain type
paneling --

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  -- and it was smooth and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on and, and
it supposedly textured it or did something to it and, but because of the b-,
dark behind it, it was really hard to cover and [noise] {sounds like
pages turning},

B.22:  Was it like a primer? 

A.23:  Yeah.  It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got
through I wished we hadn't done it because we were, you know, we were trying
to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to
do, uh, you know, make it, and it, it really was, you know, the advice they
give you is, uh, the job was considerably tougher than we thought.

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  Uh, particularly when you try to, I was talking to somebody else who, who
had a lot of wood panelling and, uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with
an estimate and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot
panelling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or
something.

B.26:  Oh, my goodness, that's an awful lot. 

A.27:  Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to
have something painted?

B.28:  Not inside.  Now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we
had a company that came out and painted it.  That was one of the requirements
from, you know, F H A --

A.29:  Yeah. 

B.30:  -- that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly
reasonable.  We have a brick house but all the trim --

A.31:  Yeah. 

B.32:  -- around the house was, uh, if I remember right, [noise] it was like five
hundred dollars.

A.33:  Oh, that's quite reasonable. 

B.34:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.35:  (( )).

B.36:  so that wasn't too bad.

A.37:  Um, problem i-, have you, have you tried matching paint lately?

B.38:  No, I haven't. 

A.39:  My wife, we, we built a shed over the ((long way)), actually, it took, this
is not on the topic but I did finish it.  But my wife went to the, uh, Home
Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick --

B.40:  Uh-huh. 

A.41:  -- and she wanted to paint the shed it's, it's a wooden shed, uh, and she
took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.

B.42:  Uh-huh. 

A.43:  And, uh, they got, and, uh, and, in fact she put some right ba-, she got,
they mixed, uh, a gallon of it and, uh, it's just remarkable how close it will
match the paint, uh, and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something,

B.44:  #Oh, so,#

A.45:  #magic.#

B.46:  they did do a good job? 

A.47:  Yeah, you know, they, but it's electronic. 

B.48:  Yeah. 

A.49:  Uh, you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it in-, and, uh,
and determines the, and it, it's really remarkable.  Uh, the problem they had
and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.

B.50:  Uh-huh. 

A.51:  And, uh, but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, um, that they could
have taken a sample --

B.52:  Uh-huh. 

A.53:  -- um, from, I forgotten, this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but
anyway.  It's, it's remarkable.  That's one of the problems though when you
start painting to try to get the, you know, you want this, you want this to
look like this and you want that to look like that and,

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  of course, if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting
into colors, have you had problems getting colors to match?

B.56:  Yeah.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is
kind of a light creamy color and a, uh, a blue and the blue, even so many
years, two years later or so it doesn't match,

A.57:  Um. 

B.58:  you know, 

A.59:  So,

B.60:  it's the very same type of paint and everything,

A.61:  Gosh. 

B.62:  So,

A.63:  So you, so what's your, what's the solution then? 

B.64:  Oh, I have no idea.  I repainted the whole thing.

A.65:  Oh, my [laughter]. 

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right? 

B.68:  Yeah. 

A.69:  You could go back and, and paint,

B.70:  Yeah. 

A.71:  the whole thing over that's, uh, this is an interesting topic that they
would bring up painting because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you
know, to go in and do, I'll just do a little bit here and ((a little there)).

B.72:  Yeah. 

A.73:  Although, the, uh, it's uh, it, we almost one day, we painted the house to,
uh, we painted, we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim.  We
thought, uh, you know, we did the one wall but the other trim, I'm trying to
think, I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh, they
don't do that in the newer houses now we don't,

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  the ((mold)),

B.76:  (( )). 

A.77:  everything is ((white)).  In a new house everything is white. 

B.78:  White, yeah.  That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.

A.79:  Oh, good luck [laughter].  We wound up selling the house. 

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  Actually, I, I don't know whether it made, actually it does, it's
interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.  One of the, in
our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has
molding, uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that --

B.82:  Uh-huh. 

A.83:  -- that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  And my wife [noise] painted those, the insides of those dark blue.

B.86:  Oh, I see. 

A.87:  And, uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller. 

B.88:  Huh.  She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim,

A.89:  The trim,

B.90:  ((what color))? 

A.91:  is still white. 

B.92:  Okay. 

A.93:  The,

B.94:  White.

A.95:  the molding --

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- but by, and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look
very attractive,

B.98:  Yeah. 

A.99:  but it makes the room look smaller which is, uh --

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  -- uh, which is, 

B.102:  [Sniffing].

A.103:  it explains why they, why they have everything white but I,

B.104:  Yeah. 

A.105:  you wouldn't think that I, well, maybe,

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but,

B.108:  Well, uh, what about the lighting?  Did it make a big difference?

A.109:  Uh, not particularly because the house has so many windows --

B.110:  Oh, uh-huh. 

A.111:  -- uh, it has the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows
and, uh, well, of course, at night but with the, we have, [laughter] we have a
soccer field --

B.112:  Uh-huh. 

A.113:  -- that's, um, oh, about a hundred yards from our house and the lights
shine right at our house.  It's kind of, we didn't know that when we bought
the house but,

B.114:  So that, uh, you get some, the color doesn't really matter for, because
you have that light. 

A.115:  Yeah.  We have a lot of light, yeah.  And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's
just, uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet and
then above that we left it white so.  Anyway, it didn't,

B.116:  ((I see)). 

A.117:  it didn't change but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up
having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't, it kind of bled
under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're --

B.118:  Uh-huh. 

A.119:  -- we're really on to that, that the masking is, you have to do that very,
very carefully.

B.120:  And it takes a long time,

A.121:  That's right.  You can work yourself to death.  Well, I'm sorry to hear
your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.

B.122:  Yeah.  Really, no kidding. 

A.123:  It's kind of frustrating. 

B.124:  It is.  A lot of work, a lot of work. 

A.125:  Well, I've got to go to a meeting.  It's been good talking to you.

B.126:  Nice talking to you. 

A.127:  Okay.  Good-bye. 

B.128:  Bye [/Children] [/TV] [/noises] {kitchen sounds in background}.
