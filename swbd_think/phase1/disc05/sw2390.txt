REMARKS:        Speaker B stumbled over her words often.  Both women had
similar accents and pitch, sometimes making it harder to tell which was 
speaking.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, do you have a credit card?

B.2:  Oh [laughter] who doesn't have credit [laughter] cards?

A.3:  I know I've got one.  I did have two, and the, I found that, um, it just
made me spend a little more, so when I paid one of them off, I got rid of 
it --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- now I have two, only have one.  Um, I don't know.  I always used to be
the person that would put something on and pay the bill right out --

B.6:  Um.

A.7:  -- and now I've, at every Christmas it seems, the last few Christmases I
used it for Christmas, and I'm still paying it off.

B.8:  Oh I know, it's, Christmas is the worst time.  I just have to leave them at
home, uh, because the impulse buying is just terrible.

A.9:  I don't know.  I consider myself pretty good, but sometimes I can go out
and I can, I can over, overspend my budget.  I guess I can afford it, but it
is, it's a pain paying it off.

B.10:  Oh yeah, uh-huh.

A.11:  I don't, I don't know, um, I had, uh, I have seven hundred dollars in mine
now, and I've saved up enough money where I'm going to bring it down to two
hundred --

B.12:  Oh yeah.

A.13:  -- and hopefully I can keep it around there.

B.14:  That's good.

A.15:  #Yeah,#

B.16:  #That's really# good.

A.17:  I know, a lot of people have, I mean fifteen hundred #dollars,#

B.18:  #Oh I know, I# know.

A.19:  two thousand dollars, but, um, I don't know.  I never, I never liked
loans a lot --

B.20:  No.

A.21:  -- so I'm not a heavy credit card user.  I have a girl friend that, she
probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards.  So,

B.22:  Oh I, I, I know, I know people that are just, uh, uh, uh, uh, are addicted
to their credit cards, and they've just gotten themselves so much in trouble
financially with, with them, it's, it, it's just unreal. I guess,

A.23:  I know it's easy to do, especially if you, if you have a job where you,

B.24:  [Breathing]. 

A.25:  have to buy nice clothes and things.

B.26:  Oh yeah [breathing].

A.27:  It, it, I think that is the biggest problem, when you,

B.28:  [Breathing]. 

A.29:  really, not, you don't, don't really need the stuff, but the,

B.30:  [Breathing].

A.31:  nicer looking clothes are the more #expensive,#

B.32:  #Oh of course.#

A.33:  nicely tailored clothes, even though you could probably get away with a
cotton dress, you got to go out and buy the rayon dress,

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  or something, you know, you got to be, they say you have to dress for
success.

B.36:  [Laughter] Yeah, plus, uh, uh, when you get, uh, uh, credit card companies
send you things in the mail all the time, uh, you know, uh, ge-, pleas-, ge-,
ge-, ge-, and you're already preapproved and all #this,#

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  other kind of stuff, you know, they just try to, uh, to, to get you to
ge-, uh, have their credit card, and um, um, uh, uh, si-, half a dozen isn't
enough [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter] How many credit cards do you have?

B.40:  Oh I have one --

A.41:  That's pretty good.  

B.42:  -- we, uh, we have one.  One Master Card.  

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Um.

A.45:  My husband won't even put his name on it.  I don't believe in those
{speaker imitates her husband's voice}.

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  It's like, but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car, you
know, he believed in it.

B.48:  Yeah [laughter].

A.49:  You've got to have #a credit,#

B.50:  #[Laughter] Yes you do,# uh-huh.

A.51:  card to rent a car.

B.52:  Yes you do. Yes you do. And tha-, tha-, uh, down here you have to have a
cre-, uh, you just can't live without it, because down here they don't take a
check unless you got credit card and driver's license identification.

A.53:  Yep, that's ri-, up here at some sto-, if it's, if you're not in your home
town you have to show them a credit card.

B.54:  Yeah, uh, it's, it's just a, another form of identification, you know, just
to,

A.55:  Well, actually, if your check bounces, I guess they could legally [noise]
take it off your credit card --

B.56:  Uh, oh yeah, they can.

A.57:  -- if that's why they're taking it --

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- I mean, I don't know how fair that is, but I don't know.  Um, yeah, I
guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent.

B.60:  Well uh, uh, ours is, ours is through our, our credit union and it's
thirteen, so it's --

A.61:  Yeah, thirteen, that's not bad.

B.62:  -- that's not, that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty-one,
which some of them are.  Uh, uh, some of them are really ex-, high, it's,
it's, uh,

A.63:  Yeah, then you have to pay your fee.  And American Express you're really,
it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- at the end of the month, but the fee for that, it's really expensive
isn't it?

B.66:  Is it?  I, I don't know.  We, do-, uh, we don't,

A.67:  I've never had one.

B.68:  My husband has one for t-, for uh, for business.  It's a company card, but
he's never had to use it so we don't get any, get --

A.69:  Oh [laughter].

B.70:  -- any, get anything, uh, for it.

A.71:  That's good [laughter].

B.72:  I mean, we would, if we used it.  We would get it and then, uh, the company
would reimburse any company expenses on it.  But so far he's never had to use
it, so we don't know anything about the billing.

A.73:  Yeah.  If he, they, they, they have you pay it right out every month.

B.74:  Do they, uh, uh, ooh [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah because it's, uh,

B.76:  That could get you in awful lot of trouble [laughter].

A.77:  I know.  Especially if your, uh, your reimbursement didn't come through
[breathing] --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- [/Breathing] from your company, because I know they, I don't know why,
but you can use American Express,

B.80:  [Breathing].

A.81:  and they give you an itemized bill.

B.82:  Yeah [breathing].

A.83:  You can use that.  I don't know why you can't use other credit cards for
business that way.

B.84:  [Breathing] I, I do-, I don't know.  I think it's, uh, just a lot of
companies prefer --

A.85:  American Express.

B.86:  -- Amer-, Ex,  yeah.  I, I don't know if it's easy for them to get or, or,
or what, but, um, but, I guess it's, it's run so much different from the other
ones.

A.87:  Yep.  This is, this is, it actually kind a boring subject of credit cards.
You really, you just know some people abuse them, but not a joke about the
person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa.

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  I bet you there are people that do that.

B.90:  Oh, I, I, I'm sure there are.  I mean, uh,

A.91:  [Laughter] People get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other.

B.92:  Oh gee, oh gee, oh gee.

A.93:  I think they charge more for cash advances so,  

B.94:  Do they, um, it's, it's, some cards y-, you can do that and some cards you
can't down here.  I think it just depends on what the banks will take.  Uh,

A.95:  Yeah, you can't get cash advances.

B.96:  Oh so-, on, on, uh, on some cards.

A.97:  Oh.

B.98:  Uh-huh. Well I (( )) through my bank.  They, they, since they have their
own card they don't like to give advances through other, for other cards.

A.99:  Oh, well, no, uh, it [laughter].  It think that's a really bad plan in your
budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another.  Oh, eventually,

B.100:  That still doesn't solve anything.

A.101:  No, it doesn't.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  Be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back.

B.104:  An-, it's still there. [Laughter] It's just some place else [laughter] now.

A.105:  I know credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's, who's got a
victim of impulse buying.

B.106:  Oh yeah,

A.107:  #Like unfair advertising,#

B.108:  #store credit cards.#

A.109:  or something.

B.110:  Store credit cards are even higher interest rate than, say Master Card or
Visa, because I had a Neiman Marcus card for a while --

A.111:  Huh-uh.

B.112:  -- and I used it once and then I cut up because the interest rate was like
almost twenty-three percent.

A.113:  Oh wow.

B.114:  So I cu-, I cut that thing up [laughter].

A.115:  Also, when you give, give someone a credit card like a normal credit card,
like a Visa or something --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- that, that um, business person loses four percent because I used to work
in a business, and #we al-,#

B.118:  #Oh really.#

A.119:  and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders.

B.120:  Ooh.

A.121:  Yeah, it's, it's the thing.  If, if a business is taking a credit card
they're real-, they sacrificing something too.  It seems the credit card
company makes money all the way around.

B.122:  Yeah I'm fixing to say, they get it from both ends.

A.123:  Because it is a four percent that they take.

B.124:  Uh, I didn't know.

A.125:  Three or four percent.  I don't know which #put,#

B.126:  #Wow.#

A.127:  you in better rating.  Yep because when I used to go to the bank
[breathing] I used to take it off the deposit.

B.128:  Oh how awful.

A.129:  Yeah you do have to take it off your deposit.  Yeah.  So it is a, a service
that they're offering.

B.130:  Yeah.  Oh, boy those people are making money hand over fist.

A.131:  I, I know.

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  Should own stock.

B.134:  [Laughter].

A.135:  There instead of these, uh,

B.136:  [/Laughter].

A.137:  Banks going that are folding but,

B.138:  But everybody's really trying to, you know, it's become a real national
problem, credit card debt, and I, um, an-, um, we #don't really have,#

A.139:  #I wonder how much# is numbers?  How many billions,

B.140:  Oh.

A.141:  of dollars, it's got to be billions of dollars.

B.142:  It, it, it is.  It is.  Uh, uh, you hear a lot about how much, uh, uh,
shaky the economy is just because of personal debt, and what they're talking
about is credit cards.

A.143:  Yeah [breathing].  That's, uh, probably true.  I mean, you have the
principal debt, the car loan, and your house loan.

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  And then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards.

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  Sheesh.

B.148:  I don't know if they count, uh, mortgages as personal debt.

A.149:  Maybe they don't.

B.150:  I don't, I'm not sure that they do.  I think, uh, what they're talking
about like, is, uh, credit cards and other junk, and loan, car loans, things
like that, because, uh, boy I know.  People who ki-, people right out of
college, the credit card people like to get you, because they spend, they use
the credit cards real easily and real freely, and then they get in real
[laughter] trouble [/laughter].

A.151:  Yeah, I know. I had a girl friend.  She just got married out of college,
and the husband had t-, confiscate her credit cards.

B.152:  Yeah.

A.153:  I mean, I don't know.  It's probably, they're always saying the women are
doing, are the spending ones.  But I haven't heard o-, uh, a single woman
taking their credit card away from the man [laughter].

B.154:  [Laughter].

A.155:  Well I don't know, I, I definitely want to get mi-, up, mine paid off month
to month like {starts with intermittent blank spots in tape} I used to.

B.156:  Yeah.

A.157:  And just as soon as I get it paid off I'll probably get laid off.

B.158:  [Laughter].

A.159:  Terrible.  Can't afford my credit card anymore.

B.160:  Oh I know, you become a slave to your plastic.
