A.1:  Okay, what kind of books do you like to read,

B.2:  Uh, mainly,

A.3:  for enjoyment? 

B.4:  the, the books I read are, uh, business related, 

A.5:  Uh-huh [music].

B.6:  or self improvement.  Um, I've got a, a, uh, small company on the side
that I, that I do things with, so, uh, a lot of the reading that I, I do has
to do with, um, how can I, uh, do better at, at my small-time business uh,
important issues such as a,

A.7:  What kind of business is it?

B.8:  you know taxes and, 

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  business expenses and all those kind things.

A.11:  Well, that sounds interest-, that sounds fun [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  What kind of business is it?

B.14:  Um, I've got a, uh, small distributorship, uh.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  I, uh, sell a, uh, healthy cookie on the side.

A.17:  Really?

B.18:  And, uh, I have a few health food stores that I send it to.  I can buy the
cookies in a larger quantity than they can,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  so I can get a deal from the, uh, from the ma-, from the supplier,

A.21:  Well, that's interesting.

B.22:  and then I distributed them and then I ca-, I get, I can sell them at a
cheaper price.  Plus I've got a, uh, drinking water system business that I've
had on the side for years that I've done.

A.23:  A what?

B.24:  A drinking water business, uh, yeah (( )),

A.25:  Oh, really?

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Well that sounds interesting [sniffing].  My mom always wants me to open a
health food store but, I'll, I'm not really into it, I don't know the infor-,
I don't know that much about it, so anyway but, well that's interesting.  I,
personally, I like mostly [lipsmack] um, if I had a book of my choice, I like
books, I go to the library a lot and it seems like I always, I never go to the
fiction section, I mean that to me is just ridiculous, it's like,

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  life is to interesting to read fiction but I always get books like, um, I
like to quilt, well I'm not into quilting but I check a lot of books out to
learn how.  I just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do
with a book, but I like to, um, can and do food preservation, and mostly
canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and
to give them as gifts and stuff, and I like to check books out like that and I
always come away with, I'm a Christian and I enjoy reading books about um,
[lipsmack] (( )) I have a real heart for people involved in cults --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and, so I have a real, you know, heart for them, and [laughter] I'm
going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that's just
where my heart is so, I read a lot of books on that and, you know Christian
books written by people about, you know to help you out and stuff (( )) and I
read the Bible.  I don't read the Bible as much as I should but but I think I
would always think that no matter what I did so, but I do enjoy reading that
[lipsmack] and, so pretty much we have different interests, I think, in
reading, [noise] {sounds like a motorcycle} but,

B.32:  [Laughter] Sounds like it.

A.33:  and I have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the
street with it and you, you can probably hear him.  (( )) [laughter] But, um,
I don't know so.  Do you enjoy reading anything like that?  Um.

B.34:  Um, I haven't really read anything like that in, in, in years.  There was a
time when I was really into the home things,

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  and I did, uh, had my own garden and I did canning, all those kind of
things.  That was when I was about, uh, ten years younger and uh, I had,

A.37:  Thirty or younger,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  Is that what you said?

B.40:  About ten years younger, yeah.

A.41:  Oh, ten years younger, oh, that's funny.

B.42:  And, uh, uh, th-, the problem that I've had in the past with, uh, my
children growing up and moving out of the house and, and still having three
left at home,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  out of the five, um, I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to
get them interested in, in reading more and, and spending more time at the
library and it, I've been moderately successful,

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  uh, with my daughter and with my son, they both have different interests
in books but, um, they, they, uh, they do read them.  Um, [lipsmack] I have
some books on, on health that I read all the time.  One's on vitamins that are
good for you and that kind of thing,

A.47:  Oh, really?

B.48:  Yeah, I, I'm,

A.49:  Yeah, ((Maureen Solomon)). I had a, a friend of mine has a book by her
right now called FOODS THAT HEAL.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  They eat a lot of it, you know, you can take your vitamins and she was
telling me to take zinc, so, [laughter] anyway I've been taking enough zinc,
you know [laughter] to kill a horse probably [laughter] I hope it doesn't hurt
me but, anyway, [laughter].  I did read one chapter of that [laughter].

B.52:  There's a, uh, a couple called, um, oh, I'm going to forgot his name now,
uh, Dirkson,

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  um, and, uh, there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS, I don't know if
you've ever heard of it,

A.55:  No, I haven't.

B.56:  Okay.  It's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS.  There's also a book called THE
LIFE EXTANS-, EXTENSION COMPANION,

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  Uh, Dirk Pearson and, oh, I forgot Sally's last name, anyway it's a couple.
I've, I've seen them on T V, and, uh, they an-, they are pretty down to earth
about uh, [lipsmack] what you can take and, and what you can't take and, 
um,

A.59:  The quantities and,

B.60:  The quantities, what are good for you, what isn't and,

A.61:  What's the name of it again?

B.62:  Um, LIFE EXTENSIONS.

A.63:  LIFE EXTENSIONS?

B.64:  Uh, yeah, he's probably about forty years old now,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  I saw him probably seven years ago, 

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  on Johnny Carson show --

A.69:  Oh, really?

B.70:  -- and, uh, I was pretty impressed.  He had a, he, before he started out on
his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the
age of each one of his organs --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- you know based on how well it was performing,

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  and then he embarked on this, uh, vitamin treatment and then every year
he had the same tests run,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  and at the age of thirty-two, I think it was, his, um, heart was that of
a fourteen year old --

A.77:  Really?

B.78:  -- and all the rest of his organs were all greatly, you know, all tested
out greatly below his actual age.  And, of course, Sally, uh, isn't a very big
woman,

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  I mean, she's, you know, she appeared to me to be very petite and um, she
took a horse shoe and, and turned it, turned it into an S,

A.81:  Oh, really?

B.82:  and, uh, it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that, that
give you the strength, and, of course, doing Isometric exercises, uh, together
they both exercised about five minutes a day,

A.83:  Really?

B.84:  doing Isometrics rather than, you know physical strenuous exercises.

A.85:  I know there's not any food that you can get, and it's grown on good soil
hardly anymore, and I know my, my husband's uncle owns di-, some acreage in,
a, Eastland, Texas, which is in West Texas, owns --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, you know --

B.88:  Yes.

A.89:  -- and, uh, we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff but, I know that,
you know, the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you, but God
still somehow makes us all be able to still live.  I think it's a miracle
we're all still alive after so many generations, well the last couple of
processed foods, you know, I mean, but, [lipsmack] I don't know.  I like
to, I like to, my, I like to be able to eat really healthy, you know, and 
(( )),

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though
because I do, don't think we're going to restore the earth to, you know, I
think [laughter] Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to
what it should be, but, uh, in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm
always looking down my plate and I think man this (( )) stuff was probably
grown in who knows what, you know, kind of environment but I do take some
vitamins on the side and, I do like reading books like that I just, I have a
hard time, a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and
we're going to restore the earth.  I just don't see that.  I think, I mean, I
think to think that is almost, it's hopeless to think that man can do anything
with the, you know what I'm saying?

B.92:  Yes.

A.93:  It's (( )) and I think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when
he wants to so sometimes I get bogged down in the, [breathing] you know, in
the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of
vitamin taking, but, you know there's a balance in it sometimes I read stuff
like that and then I just chunk off like water off your back, some of it, and,
you know, and try and do what's, what I can do out of it that's practical,

B.94:  Yeah,

A.95:  but, 

B.96:  there's,

A.97:  anyway, uh,

B.98:  I've, I've read a lot of things, um, since I got involved in the water
business back in eighty-three,

A.99:  Uh-huh [/noise].

B.100:  um, and it's amazing that the, the legislation they have, um, for food
that doesn't apply to water, they don't consider water a food --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- and, uh, the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be,
you know, they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because
it's toxic [noise].  Um, chlorine,

A.103:  Because it's what?

B.104:  It's toxic.  It's a,

A.105:  Oh.

B.106:  I don't know if your on city water, city water has chlorine in it,
chlorine,

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  causes cancer,

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  they know that, they've proven that.  Um, yet their saying well we're
putting such low doses in there, that, well,

A.111:  Uh-huh [breathing] {heavily}.

B.112:  you don't have to worry about dying from it.  The problem is that I've,
that I've read books that,

A.113:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.114:  uh, have proven that [noise] there is a link between the
ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis, which is heart attack,

A.115:  Um.

B.116:  and if you look at the history of hear attacks, heart attacks were
nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty,

A.117:  Really?

B.118:  and we started doing, um, large quantities of chlorination of water
starting around, uh, where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and
nineteen thirteen [/noise] most of the major cities had chlorinated
water.

A.119:  Really?  You know I bet that's why we have some friends that eat only, I
just took this Amish bread out of the oven, man, it's going to be good.  I had
a starter that friend of mine made, anyway, uh, I had a friend that read a
book on that and, um, I've, all my relatives my m-, you know, you probably
read BACK TO EDEN or something, I don't know, (( )) we read a lot, I know
people have read all those books but, the, um, they dr-, they drilled a well,
I don't know how many feet but it's three or four times deeper than it needed
to be,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  and so their water comes out, they live in Grand Prairie, but it's, they
live kind of in a, the planes go right over from D F W, so it's not real
developed, and so they have a,

B.122:  Yeah, I'm very familiar with the area.

A.123:  probably half an acre, and, yeah, and they drilled this well and the
water comes out at thirty-two degrees, so [laughter] it's kinds of neat.
Would that be healthier do, to do that, to drill your own fresh water well
like that?

B.124:  It depends, a lot of, uh, a lot of things were thought [breathing] that,
uh, as, you know, the farmers thought, okay, we got chemicals, we're putting
chemicals on the field, well the ground will naturally filter out the {End of
