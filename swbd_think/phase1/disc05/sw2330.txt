=============================================================================

A.1:  There we go.

B.2:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I
would expect this time of year.

A.3:  I think that's true.  The, uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March,
and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April.
So.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  So I think we're a little hea-, ahead of schedule on that.

B.6:  Yeah, I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon, and I noticed all that
grass coming up, and I thought, ooh, we've got to start this mowing bit soon
[laughter].

A.7:  That's true.  It's been a, a fun break, but the break is over.

B.8:  Yeah.  Well, um, oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately
is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray,
you know, just,

A.9:  Yeah, now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.

B.10:  Yeah.  But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray
[laughter].

A.11:  Well, yeah, but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend.

B.12:  Oh, I go for that, yeah.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here.  We have a
long weekend and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool
side.

A.15:  Yeah.  I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not.

B.16:  I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening, but it's supposed to
be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without
rain.

A.17:  Well, that's good.

B.18:  But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the
forties.  That's getting back to a little bit chillier.

A.19:  Yeah, that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year.
I think, I haven't seen the wea-, the weather on the news in the evening
lately, but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy.

B.20:  Yeah.  I'm not certain either, but you're probably right.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe
seventy-five to eighty, somewhere in there.  I don't like it when it's too
cool or too warm.  I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort
of in between temperature.

A.23:  Yeah, that's true.  Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in
the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say
ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high.

B.24:  Um.

A.25:  And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable,
that it doesn't vary very much.

B.26:  Yeah.  You're probably right.

A.27:  I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be
very warm or very cold.

B.28:  Yes, as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V and I
think it was one day this week a year ago --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather.  You know
--

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- it wasn't just a super bad storm, but it was --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late
spring time.

A.35:  Yeah.  One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time
last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm.

B.36:  Oh, wow.

A.37:  I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, and a, a lightening bolt
was almost directly overhead, and it was twenty- six degrees out.

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  And I thought, Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that
temperature.

B.40:  Yeah, that, that is pretty unusual.  And you really take notice of it, too.

A.41:  That's right.  It, uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high.  Sometimes
they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few
years ago that it never got up as high as freezing.  The air temperature at
five thousand feet was fifty degrees.

B.42:  Um.

A.43:  The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get
away.

B.44:  Wow.  I don't, don't like that super cold stuff.

A.45:  Nope.

B.46:  I just don't move very well [laughter] when it's that cold.

A.47:  Yep, I, I'm really enjoying this now.  Well, this has been interesting.

B.48:  Yeah, well.

A.49:  Not too challenging to the brain.

B.50:  [Laughter]  Not, not a real in depth topic, but --

A.51:  Nope.

B.52:  -- enjoyed talking to you.

A.53:  All right, Ellen, well you have a good day.

B.54:  Okay.

A.55:  Bye.

B.56:  Bye-bye.
