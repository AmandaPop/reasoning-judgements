=========================================================================

B.1:  [Beep] Do you have children?  

A.2:  My children are thirty-three, twenty-nine, and twenty-five.  

B.3:  Okay.  

A.4:  And I, uh, am spending more time with my twenty-five year old because at
this point he happens to be single and always has been single --

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  -- and living at home --  

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  -- uh, while he's trying to, uh, find a nice girl and get married
[laughter].

B.9:  That's a hard process, isn't it [laughter].  

A.10:  They're little [laughter] right.  They're a little hard to come by, so
anyway he's still here.  Uh, the only thing I can say about the raising of
these little things is that my sons-in-law seem to be so much more involved
than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group.

B.11:  I'm kind of at the other extreme.  I have a nine month old and one that
will be born in October.

A.12:  Oh, how wonderful.  We had --

B.13:  So,

A.14:  -- uh, an October baby --  

B.15:  Oh, really.  

A.16:  -- on the fifteenth.  May-, 

B.17:  Yeah, that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes, well you should have
it on the fifteenth.  So we'll see [laughter].

A.18:  Yeah [laughter].  Well my husband's is on the fourteenth, so we did miss
that one day,

B.19:  [Laughter].

A.20:  by a few hours there but we didn't care at that point so,

B.21:  Yeah, it's that close.  

A.22:  So, do you find your husband more involved than your father was with you?

B.23:  I, he, definitely.  I had an unusual situation w-, in my home.  My father
was, was alcoholic.

A.24:  Um.  

B.25:  But, uh, and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more
involved and we have more of a, uh, I guess a Christian based home and so we
try to make the family as important as we can.

A.26:  Uh-huh.  

B.27:  And, uh, and I guess you don't have to have a Christian based home to, to
feel that way, but that's just part of our priorities.

A.28:  Christianity doesn't hurt us any does it?  

B.29:  That's right [laughter].  

A.30:  [Laughter].  

B.31:  It certainly gives you some, some specific goals to work towards.

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  But, uh, he helps a lot with her.  He helps feeding her, changing her and
playing with her and, and I think he has to be conscious of, of, uh, needing
to spend time with her.  If not, then he gets wrapped up in the T V and the
newspaper --

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  -- and whatever else and he says, Oh, I didn't spend time with Emily.

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  But, if he forgets, I try to, to help to him -- 

A.38:  Uh-huh.  

B.39:  -- remember [laughter].  

A.40:  And perhaps Emily will when she's a little older.  

B.41:  I think so.  

A.42:  Uh-huh.  Uh, how do you find, uh, with an alcoholic father, how do you f-,
h-, what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult?

B.43:  I think, uh, I've been reading a lot lately about the alcohol-, children of
alcoholics syndrome.

A.44:  Uh-huh.  

B.45:  I don't know if you've heard of that or not -- 

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  -- but, uh, trying to relate that to me and I think because I had a strong
Christian background personally, it affected me differently than it affected
my sisters.

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  And I see myself, uh, with some of those qualities, but with not quite as
much anger --

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  -- as I see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things --

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  -- and, uh, as far as me personally, I think it made me appreciate my
husband more because he doesn't do [laughter] certain things --

A.54:  Uh-huh.  

B.55:  -- that my dad did, so I,

A.56:  The reason I'm asking is because I have a dear, dear friend whose father
was alcoholic and at fifty, she, and she was an only child.  At fifty she's
still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she
feels stems from how she was treated by her father and how she feels that she
has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from
the fact that her father was alcoholic over which, of course, she had no
control.

B.57:  Uh-huh.  I think that's, that's how I feel, too.  I feel a need to dominate
certain things, and I try real hard not to be to-, too domineering with, with
Emily.

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  Because I don't want to, my mother was also a domineering type of
personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in.

A.60:  Uh-huh.  

B.61:  And I find, you know, I think, okay I want Emily to be this way and this is
what I'm going to do to make her be that way and then I think, no you can't do
that.

A.62:  Uh-huh.  

B.63:  She has to develop her own personality and so sometimes I, I have to step
back and say, okay we want to encourage her, we want to influence her, but we
don't want to control her.

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  And so far it hasn't been too hard.  But she hasn't been making a whole lot
of decisions on her own yet.

A.66:  [Laughter].  

B.67:  And so, you know, I guess I'm, I'm just going to have to be real conscious
of that as I, as she gets older and does start making decisions.

A.68:  Uh-huh.  

B.69:  And be conscious that I need to give her options but not make the decisions
for her.

A.70:  Uh-huh.  And you don't feel that your relationship with your father has
unduly, uh, influenced your relationship with your husband, then.

B.71:  Uh, I, I look at myself and, I have three sisters, there's four daughters
in the family --

A.72:  Um.  

B.73:  -- I look at myself compared to my sisters' families and see that one of
them married an abusive husband --

A.74:  Uh-huh.  

B.75:  -- one of them married an alcoholic.  Uh, the other one married into a
pretty stable relationship, and mine is pretty stable --

A.76:  Uh-huh.  

B.77:  -- or much more stable.  I think probably than any of them, but now I
waited until I was thirty to get married and they all married at --

A.78:  Uh-huh.  

B.79:  -- eighteen.  

A.80:  Uh-huh.  

B.81:  But, uh,

A.82:  You didn't need to get away from home, then.  

B.83:  Uh, well, my dad in hi-, his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and e-,
there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost, he,
like, if he had any opinions to give, he would tell my mother and she would
tell us --

A.84:  Uh-huh.  

B.85:  -- and so we had almost no direct relationship with him.  

A.86:  Uh-huh.  

B.87:  I mean, he was there, and -- 

A.88:  Uh-huh.  

B.89:  -- and we, you know, did little things together as a family, but on the
whole there was no, no direct communication, no show of affection, no --

A.90:  Uh-huh.  

B.91:  -- even no show of anger unless it, he was, you know, really, really drunk.

A.92:  My fa-, my husband was like that but that was because he was working all
the time establishing a business --

B.93:  Oh. 

A.94:  -- and running it.  

B.95:  Uh-huh.

A.96:  Certainly he, I mean, he got off work and he came home and he ate dinner
and his work was outside and in the winter time, by the time he was warm, he
was asleep.

B.97:  Uh-huh.

A.98:  So it wasn't that he was neglectful of his children by choice, there just
was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which
started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty.

B.99:  Uh-huh.  

A.100:  Uh, you know, alcoholism wasn't a problem, resentment, whatever was, was
not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he
seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted
them.

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  He just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now, uh,
he's very, ex-, he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren
which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own.

B.103:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I see my father relating much better to the grandchildren
than he did to us.

A.104:  So he has overcome alcoholism at this point.  

B.105:  Not completely, no.  

A.106:  Oh.  

B.107:  He, he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages.  

A.108:  Uh-huh.  

B.109:  But he still, you know, he will pick up my, one of my granddaughters and
say, you know, give her a hug and say I love you --

A.110:  Oh. 

B.111:  -- and the first time he said I love you to me was when I had been away
from home for almost a year and a half.

A.112:  But he said it.  

B.113:  Yeah, it, I said I love you, dad, I miss you, and then he said, was able to
say it back --

A.114:  Uh-huh.  

B.115:  -- and, and I was twenty-four -- 

A.116:  Yeah.  

B.117:  -- and that's the first time I'd heard him say anything, you know, similar
to that.

A.118:  The first time I heard my older daughter tell, and she is our most
expressive, tell my husband that she loved him, he said, well I certainly hope
so.

B.119:  Um.

A.120:  So, he, but then he came from a background where he is so much more open
with his children than his father was with him.

B.121:  Uh-huh.

A.122:  His father was just a very quiet, withdrawn person and I assume very shy as
is my husband.

B.123:  Uh-huh.  

A.124:  Uh, he shows his feelings, but he cannot express it.  And I think that's
kind of sad in a way.  I --

B.125:  Yeah.

A.126:  -- see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons
and, we have two daughters and a son, and, uh, he just can't do that and I, I
know that he would if he could and I, I kind of feel sorry for him because I
think he misses a lot.

B.127:  Uh-huh.  

A.128:  And, as I say, our, our, sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to
their children and I wonder if it's because they're there when they d-,
they're delivered, if that,

B.129:  They went through that entire process.  

A.130:  Right.  

B.131:  Yeah.

A.132:  If that maybe starts in the delivery room with a chain that my generation
missed out on.

B.133:  Uh-huh.  I think, too, that with us, as women, being out of the home, I'm
not working now, I didn't work until about, from about the time Emily was,
about four months before she was --

A.134:  Uh-huh.  

B.135:  -- born and, but so many women are having children and returning to the
work field that, the, the dads, you know, have to, to follow through or a
third person has to come in and follow through --

A.136:  Uh-huh.  

B.137:  -- with, with the, the care and the dads are, are doing more. 

A.138:  Uh-huh.  

B.139:  And that bond is starting, you know, like you said, right at the beginning
and then developing.  It's not breaking at any point.

A.140:  Uh-huh.  

B.141:  At least it shouldn't, and, and, and, and in a good family, it isn't.
Unfortunately there's so many families where there isn't a father in the home.

A.142:  Uh-huh.  

B.143:  It's just,

A.144:  Or a mother.  Some of them the fathers are -- 

B.145:  Yeah.  

A.146:  -- raising the children.  

B.147:  That's right, yeah.  Yeah.  

A.148:  It's certainly --

B.149:  So,

A.150:  -- not a good situation, but I'm sure it's not one that the, the, the
families chose.  I mean --

B.151:  Uh-huh.

A.152:  -- I'm sure they felt they had no choice.  At our stage in life we've seen
a lot of our friends go through divorces, uh, you know, we've been married
thirty-five years --

B.153:  Uh-huh.

A.154:  -- and so that's how old our friends are and they're on their second
marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and I think, my gosh, all the
pain they've caused themselves --

B.155:  Uh-huh.

A.156:  -- and their children.  I just, you know, of course, everything wasn't
always rosy for us, but, you, we stayed together and at this point our
children are saying, gosh I'm glad you did that.

B.157:  Uh-huh.

A.158:  So, I think it makes for a more solid basis for them --

B.159:  Yeah.

A.160:  -- or I hope so, at least.  

B.161:  Yeah, they see you go through the problems and still come out okay.

A.162:  Uh-huh.  And they see --

B.163:  Working together.

A.164:  -- that with my husband's retirement a little over a year ago we're having
a wonderful time --

B.165:  Uh-huh.

A.166:  -- and I think they look at that and, and, uh, and that way I think we're
doing a lot for our grandchildren.

B.167:  Yes, yeah.  Well, that sounds good.  

A.168:  Uh-huh.

B.169:  My background is in sociology and so I see a lot of unwed mothers.

A.170:  Uh ...
