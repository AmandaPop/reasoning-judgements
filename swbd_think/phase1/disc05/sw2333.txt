==========================================================================

B.1:  All right.

A.2:  [Throat_clearing].

B.3:  So we're supposed to talk about food.

A.4:  Um.

B.5:  Maybe we'll get a call back saying, hey, you're not, you're not talking
about food.

A.6:  Oh, no, you can talk about anything you want.

B.7:  Yeah.

A.8:  These things are just suggestions.

B.9:  Oh, golly.  Well, I live in Dallas?  What, what area do you live in?

A.10:  Uh, North Carolina.

B.11:  North Carolina.  Oh, really.

A.12:  It is boring here.

B.13:  Oh really.

A.14:  Boring.

B.15:  Well, in the Carolinas they did have (( )) {whispered} [laughter].

A.16:  Um, yes.

B.17:  [Laughter].

A.18:  Yes we're,

B.19:  He's, he's not a subject of great pride.

A.20:  Oh, yes, it's, it's one of our prouder (( )), right along with Jessie
Helms.

B.21:  Oh, yeah.

A.22:  I th-, I think they were, pardon the phrase, all in bed together or
something.

B.23:  [Laughter] Twins separated at birth kind of thing.

A.24:  Yeah.  Somebody, somebody let the brains run out on the floor though.

B.25:  [Laughter] Somebody dropped that baby (( )).

A.26:  Oh, man.  Jim Bakker.

B.27:  Oh, 

A.28:  Oh, what a, what a dangerous individual.

B.29:  I, I, I know.  Uh, how, how did Jessie Helms get reelected?  That's what I
want to know

A.30:  That's a, well, that's a good question.

B.31:  What does he do?  Does he just send the people, are there just stupid
people where he lives or something.

A.32:  Yeah, basically, yeah.

B.33:  Okay.  

A.34:  Yeah, that's

B.35:  Well,

A.36:  That's, that's most of it.  And he plays very heavily on the race issue --

B.37:  Oh, yeah. 

A.38:  -- and it's still, that's still a big thing here in this backwards state.

B.39:  Yeah, that's too bad, because, I mean, I've been in the Carolinas, and you
know, there are some places in the Carolinas it's really nice there.

A.40:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, my favorite place is Ashville --

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  -- it's right over there in the mountains.  It's a beautiful place.

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  It's just that, you know, I mean, if you took all the people out of the
state, it would be a great place.

B.45:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.46:  The folks are so backwards it's just ridi-, it's pathetic.

B.47:  I, I know, I think literacy is probably the biggest problem there.

A.48:  Yeah, I, I mean, the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the
educational system.  They've been changing their standards and this, that and
the other, and claiming this is going to make everything better.

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  Uh, Durham, the county right next to us --

B.51:  Yeah.

A.52:  -- big city, had an enormous jump in the uh, in the S A T rate.

B.53:  Oh, really, 

A.54:  And everybody was,

B.55:  How'd they do that.

A.56:  Huh?

B.57:  Well, let me guess what they did?  They had classes on the S A T.

A.58:  Oh, no, it was even worse than that.  

B.59:  Oh, really.

A.60:  They falsified the data.

B.61:  Oh.  Plano, Plano started having,

A.62:  Yeah,  just, just stu-,

B.63:  Plano actually, they went out and they had,

A.64:  [Throat_clearing].

B.65:  right where I live, they had the, they had the classes on the S A T.  I've
never heard anything so preposterous in my life.

A.66:  [Laughter].

B.67:  They're preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for
the test.

A.68:  Right.

B.69:  How ridiculous.  I mean, of course, it has the highest S A T rate.  Well,
it also has the highest teen suicide rate, too.  So.

A.70:  Oh, well.

B.71:  I mean, that, and this is national [laughter].

A.72:  I don't kn-,

B.73:  I don't know where it's all going to (( )), where it's all going to go.

A.74:  I don't, I don't know what's, I mean, public education is just going down
the tubes.

B.75:  Yeah.

A.76:  I mean, throwing more and more money at it, and it just seems to be getting
worse and worse.

B.77:  But you know what's bad, I mean, like I'm going into, you know, an
education related field.  And I just, you know, it just really kills me, you
know, I mean, it's, it, it really is a shame that, you know, you know, the
United States, somehow we spend more money on each student, and the teachers
are paid so little.

A.78:  Oh, yeah.

B.79:  I mean, I mean.  How do, how do they figure that out?  

A.80:  I don't know.  That's, that's the one thing that I've, I've never been able
to figure out.  Why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers.

B.81:  Yeah.  

A.82:  Um.

B.83:  Well, the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil.  Well --

A.84:  Oh, yeah.

B.85:  -- I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say, Well, since
this is a woman dominated field, we can treat them like dirt, you know.

A.86:  Yeah, I guess,

B.87:  That, that, that must be the rationale for, for where it comes from, in the
United States.

A.88:  It must be, I bet, you know, I, I, I'm not knocking the garbage men, I
mean, they're necessary.

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  But there's a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs
as garbage men --

B.91:  Hey, that's a --

A.92:  -- for less money.

B.93:  -- hey, that's a hard job to get, really.

A.94:  [Throat_clearing] It is.

B.95:  I-, i-, in Texas, in Texas it's hard because it's almost like a father to
son thing.

A.96:  Yeah.  Well, it's, it's, it's hard in New York, too, and I mean, they get
paid twenty-eight thousand a year to start.

B.97:  Gee, that's (( )), that's ridiculous.

A.98:  And teachers only get paid twenty-four.

B.99:  Man, I'd carry garbage for twenty-eight thousand a year.

A.100:  You bet, you bet.

B.101:  Man, I worked as a welder, and, uh, you don't even get paid that much
[laughter].

A.102:  Man, I'd go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money.

B.103:  Yeah.

A.104:  Good exercise, you get outside.  Gee.

B.105:  Yeah [laughter].

A.106:  Well.

B.107:  [Laughter] (( )) the dogs are your friends [laughter].  Knock over a can
now and then and leave it open for the dogs.

A.108:  Well that's what my, that's what my garbage man does.

B.109:  [Laughter].

A.110:  I went out the other morning and my, my garbage can was sitting in the
middle of my driveway.

B.111:  [Laughter].

A.112:  Jeez, I get tired of this.  I've got a, there's a nice little wooden
platform out there for the garbage cans.

B.113:  [Laughter]  Yeah, yeah.

A.114:  And then they throw them anywhere they want to.  And sometimes they don't
even take everything.

B.115:  Oh.  

A.116:  That's the biggest kick.

B.117:  So you live in the Carolinas, huh.

A.118:  The Carolinas.  

B.119:  Have you went skiing?

A.120:  No, I'm not, I'm not a fool.

B.121:  Oh, okay.

A.122:  Uh.

B.123:  I'm, I'm not really impressed with, I mean, I lived in Germany for three
years.  I, I wa-, I'm not impressed with skiing.  Now I like, I like other,
you know, winter sports, but, I'm not real thrilled about (( )).

A.124:  I, I, it's okay to watch people go out and break their legs, but I'm not
going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick
mountain side [laughter].

B.125:  [Laughter].

A.126:  I've got better things to do with my life.

B.127:  [Laughter]. 

A.128:  [Throat_clearing] When I, uh, when I was, uh, stationed in England, I
used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot, and one of my favorite
places to go was Switzerland, and it was just great to sit out there in, uh,
Zurich or Bern, just sit in the sidewalk cafes.

B.129:  Oh, yeah, the caf-, um, my wife, her favorite, actually she was stationed
at, in Germany with me, too, and, uh, she fell in love with Salzburg, Austria.

A.130:  Yeah, Salzburg is nice.

B.131:  Uh-huh.

A.132:  Austria is nice.  Europe is nice.

B.133:  Well it's, well it's such a, it's, it's, It makes the Germans look like
slobs.

A.134:  Yeah.

B.135:  I mean,  Austria and Switzerland are (( )).

A.136:  Yeah, really.  I mean, Switzerland is so clean.  

B.137:  Oh.

A.138:  Not even a scrap of paper on the ground, you know.  

B.139:  Well, they have these there, these real, like real strict laws, you know.
They have to hose down the streets like --

A.140:  Yeah.

B.141:  -- every other day or something.  Pretty ridiculous.

A.142:  I loved it there, though.

B.143:  Yeah.

A.144:  I loved it.

B.145:  Yeah.  I did, I did like the food in Germany.  It was pretty good.

A.146:  Um.  Well, I like Europe, except for Belgium.  

B.147:  Yeah, I, I'm, I really don't know what the Belgians, I mean, they have, do
they really have an identity or, I mean, I think they have --

A.148:  No.

B.149:  -- they have an identity crisis,

A.150:  Yeah, I think I do, because,

B.151:  a lot of these countries, they, they really don't know,

A.152:  half of them are, yeah, half of them are Middle Eastern --

B.153:  Yeah.

A.154:  -- and the other half are French expatriates,

B.155:  Uh-huh.

A.156:  And, since I hate the French anyway,

B.157:  [Laughter].

A.158:  the Belgians try to act like the French.

B.159:  Yeah.

A.160:  And I, it was just miserable, I hated that place.

B.161:  [Laughter].

A.162:  I hate it almost as much as I do France.

B.163:  Oh, my wife and I, we had it, when we drove through France, we paid in
tolls to go to Spain, and we drove from Germany, like the southwestern most
part of Germany, we drove on the tolls, and we spent forty-six dollars in
tolls, one way.

A.164:  Yeah.

B.165:  Oh, and it was like uh, it was, it was about an eighteen, nineteen hour
drive.

A.166:  Sure.

B.167:  Oh, God, what a headache --

A.168:  Yeah.

B.169:  -- what a pain in the butt.  And, and the,

A.170:  [Throat_clearing].

B.171:  fuel was so expensive.  I mean, I, I just, I can't believe, I mean, when
we, when we came back, on our way back, I mean, well, my wife and I, we first,
we were in Barcelona, and we bought like, we found this really great cafe
that, it was like a delicatessen.

A.172:  Uh-huh.

B.173:  And we, like we bought, we filled a ful-, a cooler full of food, of all
this delicatessen food [laughter],

A.174:  [Laughter].

B.175:  and then we ate it all the way to the (( )), France, because the food was
so, so bad, and then when we came into Germany, I had five centime left, I
mean, that's like --

A.176:  Yeah.

B.177:  -- that's, that's five one hundredths of a franc, which is worth, probably
worth about a twentieth of a penney.

A.178:  Yeah, couldn't even use it,

B.179:  And, and I mean, I, I, I just about kissed the guard.  

A.180:  [Laughter].

B.181:  I mean, we got there, he was like, I was like, we're so happy to see you.
He's like, You're sort of new, why.

A.182:  Yeah, really.  I used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais --

B.183:  Yeah, I've done that before.

A.184:  -- and drive across France,

B.185:  Uh-huh.

A.186:  Uh, horrible.  I only did that one time.

B.187:  Well, actually, actually, I've gone, where were you stationed at in
England?

A.188:  Uh, Mildenhall.

B.189:  Oh really, I was, um, I was T D Y at Bent Waters.

A.190:  Oh, good old Bent Waters.

B.191:  Yeah, my brother, my brother was stationed at Bent Waters for a long time.

A.192:  Yeah, it's a nice place.

B.193:  Yeah.

A.194:  Bent Waters is a, is a very nice little pla-, nice little base out in the
country.

B.195:  Yeah.

A.196:  Nobody messes with them a lot.  Mildenhall was pretty, uh, well, it was
big, and it got a lot of attention.

B.197:  Yeah.

A.198:  But, uh, yeah.  Bent Waters, Upper Hafford, all those neat little places.
That's where I really wanted to be.

B.199:  Yeah.  Well my brother got stationed eventually at Oxbridge.  He, he really
enjoyed it there.

A.200:  Oh, Oxbridge, yeah.

B.201:  Well, his wife was British, so they had, they had quite a good time there.

A.202:  Yeah, Oxbridge is nice.  Oh, everywhere in England is nice.

B.203:  I mean, a lot of the people, it's funny [laughter], they just, I don't
know, the standard of living is not as high as you would think.

A.204:  But on the other hand, it's, it's, in a way it's better.

B.205:  Yeah.

A.206:  That's what I like about it, for one thing, everything was cheap.

B.207:  Yeah.  

A.208:  Um, I, I can still remember going, going to the store and getting a pint of
milk, a pound of butter, and a loaf of bread, and getting change back from my
pound.

B.209:  Yeah.

A.210:  You can't even buy a loaf of bread in this country.
