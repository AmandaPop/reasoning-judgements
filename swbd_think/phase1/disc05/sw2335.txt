===========================================================================

A.1:  So what do you think?

B.2:  Uh, the causes of crime?  [Throat_clearing].  Um, I think it was imbalance
of power in the United States.  It's causing the lower class to rebel.  That's
why there's su-, such high crime, and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people
because they don't have ro-, role models --

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  -- see too much crime on T V and they think it's the way to go.  I don't
know.  What do you think?

A.5:  What about, I agree with the upper and lower level, you know --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- because that's the lowest thing for themselves, plus there's nobody for
them to look up to.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  But I also blame some of it on parents --

B.10:  Okay.

A.11:  -- because parents aren't parents.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Because I remember even when I was growing up, I'm thirty-five 
[laughter] --

B.14:  Okay.

A.15:  -- I remember when I was growing up, and I had friends, they used to do
stuff like, you know, go over to a store and steal stuff.  My mother warned
us, it's like, I don't care what your friends do.  If you do it, then that was
it.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  And I knew that I would get in more trouble from my mother than from --

B.18:  From anybody else.

A.19:  -- from anybody else.  And I think --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- that's the basic, is they have no morals any more, so they don't care.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  So.

B.24:  Yeah, I think I can agree with that too.

A.25:  But now, as far as what they can do about it, I don't know. 

B.26:  [Throat_clearing].

A.27:  You can't make parents be parents [laughter].

B.28:  That's true.  You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing.

A.29:  You know.

B.30:  I don't know how you do that.

A.31:  I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs, that's another problem with the
United States, there's no jobs any more.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  But.

B.34:  Well, I've heard this one theory, that if, that if a kid commits a crime,
that, uh, instead of the, prosecuting the kid, they prosecute the parent.  Or
both of them.

A.35:  That would work to a point,

B.36:  Now, to put the blame on the parent.

A.37:  Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway. I don't
care what you do to them.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  You know, so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in,
you know.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  Because a, a, a child can get into anything regar-,

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I don't care how good you, they are.  

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  Eventu-, at least one time, but now if this is a repeated thing, here with
this child in juvenile, and or, to me, yeah, both of them.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do.
Because I just watched it on T V one night on one of them, um, Twenty Twenty,
Forty-eight# hours, one of them shows# --

B.48:  #Uh-huh.  Yeah.#

A.49:  -- where this boy had been stealing cars.  I don't know --

B.50:  Um. 

A.51:  -- if you seen this.  (( )) it was a little, it was a little gang of 
them --

B.52: # No, I didn't see it.#

A.53:  -- #stealing cars, you know,#

B.54:  I understand.

A.55:  And then when they caught him, you know, his mother sitting there, now they
going to take me away from you.  That meaned she was warned.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  You know, but I'm sure there's something can be done.

B.60:  Yeah.  What about with adults?  Anything do any about (( )) adult crime.

A.61:  Yeah, start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving
door on the damn court system.

B.62:  Yeah.  Well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are
overcrowded.

A.63:  Well, they should start with, the, if they would get rid of.  Seems to me,
I know there's a lot about court that people don't understand.  There's more
people in jail right now for child support, okay --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- then there are for people doing drugs.

B.66:  Um.

A.67:  You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- let them go, let them go --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- you know, give them a fine, whatever, make them do civic duty whatever,

B.72: # Yeah, I mean seriously,#

A.73: # Put them fools in there,#

B.74:  they ought to put those (( )) people to work.

A.75:  I call them all fools, idiots, whatever.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  Little rock stars, put all them in there.

B.78:  Um.

A.79:  You know, the murderers, the drug dealers, the user, put them all in 
jail --

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  -- you know, and let all the normal people go --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- you know, because, okay, if you write a bad check, you go to jail,
right.

B.84:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.85:  Let them people go.  

B.86:  Well.

A.87:  Not let them go and get out of it.

B.88:  Yeah, they, #you still have to punish them#.

A.89:  #Let them go# and pay their crime or their time doing something else --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- you know, like cleaning up the city or however they do their --

B.92:  Yeah, that's,

A.93:  -- community time, you know, whatever that is [laughter].  But pu-, don't
put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals.

B.94:  Yeah, and they're, they're still, they can provide for society, whereas
some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  So.  I don't know, some people, boy, they got, I think the United
States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else.

B.96:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's true.

A.97:  Now how they going to fix it, I don't know.  I don't think there is a ready
solution.

B.98:  No, I don't think so either.  Uh.

A.99:  Because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the
pole is getting more of the, I guess, the bulk of it.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet.

B.102:  And they keep taking more money from us --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- and people are get, and they don't have any incentive to work if we're
just going to take fifty percent of it.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  Might as well steal, then they don't have to pay taxes on it [laughter].

A.107:  That's it.

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  So, you know, they, I, I, I know that's bad, but, you know, just like Texas
now.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  They could have had a lottery.  They don't want a lottery.  Why not?  I
would rather pay for a lottery --

B.112:  They'd have a,

A.113:  -- a dollar, two, three dollars, whatever I'm paying, you know --

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  -- a week or whatever, and never see any of that money, than to have them
take a portion of my paycheck.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  Because, [laughter] you know, they take, and Uncle Sam takes his, the
Social Security which probably won't be here when I get that old --

B.118:  Um.

A.119:  -- you know.  Because we're paying for Social Security they using now.

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  Who's going to pay for mine?

B.122:  I don't know [laughter].

A.123:  [Laughter]  But it's, it's 

B.124:  I'm not counting on it.

A.125:  No, you don't count on Social Security.

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  But, it's, it's, that's what I'm saying, they need to do something else.

B.128:  Um.

A.129:  But.  Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  And it's going to get worse.

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  That's just like last night they killed them people in that store.  Where
you at?

B.134:  I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.

A.135:  Oh [laughter].  No wonder you don't know that.

B.136:  Well, where are you from?

A.137:  I'm in Dallas.  

B.138:  Okay.

A.139:  But last night, [laughter] they killed, uh, uh, four people in a chain
food.

B.140:  Oh, man.

A.141:  And killed them, well, it was two stores side by side.

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  One was a store and one was like a, a fast food place, (( )) chicken or
something, I don't know.

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  Anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women, I
mean, they just beat them.  Stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all.

B.146:  Ow.

A.147:  Why was, you know, why --

B.148:  Why did they do in the freezer?

A.149:  -- you know, why didn't they just, if they was going to lock them, just
lock them in the freezer, take the money, you know.

B.150:  Yeah.

A.151:  They didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything.

B.152:  Um.  Um.  That's awful.  Yeah, we still get some in Raleigh.  I mean, 
not --

A.153:  Uh-huh.

B.154:  -- not too often real bad ones, [talking] but.

A.155:  It's just getting really ridiculous down here.  I wish I could move
somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country.

B.156:  I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.

A.157:  Well, I think, if it's, the town is smaller --

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  -- and everybody knows everybody --

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  -- it's harder --

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  -- to come in there and do something.  Where is, and, and, and see that's
another thing.  Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more.

B.164:  Yeah.

A.165:  There's nobody is next door to you, you don't know your neighbors, and
stuff like that.

B.166:  Yeah.

A.167:  It's just, huh-uh, [laughter] you know, because I moved out some apartments
before because they were loaded with drug dealers.

B.168:  Um.

A.169:  And you didn't even, and what the manager, the manager won't even do
anything.

B.170:  He's probably a drug dealer himself [laughter].  

A.171:  Uh-huh.

B.172:  You never know.

A.173:  You don't.  And so I moved, because I moved the day probably a week after
one of the apartments blew up --

B.174:  Wow.

A.175:  -- you know, and this is like across the street.  This was a nice part of
town --

B.176:  Um.

A.177:  -- and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they
were having that, making that, um, crack stuff --

B.178:  Um.

A.179:  -- and then, the other time I saw the cops break down somebody's apartment
around the corner.  I say, See, this is it.

B.180:  Time to go.

A.181:  That's it, and I moved.

B.182:  Yeah.

A.183:  And, you know, now I live in like a fam-, a neighborhood in a town house,
but it's nice. # I don't, you know.#

B.184: # Yeah. I'm kind of# in the same, same kind of deal, town house in a
neighborhood.

A.185:  But,

B.186:  It's pretty nice.

A.187:  I don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex.
That's what happen, that's what wrong,

B.188:  [Throat_clearing].

A.189:  you know.  I don't think, don't rent to them [laughter].

B.190:  Yeah.  

A.191:  Or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers.  Put it on the
lease.

B.192:  Yeah.

A.193:  If you deal drugs, you can't live here.

B.194:  Yeah.  Most of them are too scared to do anything about it.

A.195:  Uh-huh.  That's it.

B.196:  Yeah.  All right.  Well listen, I got to go.  

A.197:  All righty.

B.198:  Nice talking to you.

A.199:  And I thank you.

B.200:  All right.

A.201:  Bye-bye.

B.202:  Bye-bye.
