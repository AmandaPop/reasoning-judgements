===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have a favorite type of music you listen to?

@B.2:  Um, most frequently I listen to contemporary Christian music, but I like
all forms.

A.3:  [Laughter] Okay.

B.4:  I, uh, we, I listen to country and rock and classical, jazz is probably my
least favorite, although I enjoy it too.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  I tend to favor, uh, rock and roll, mostly from the sixties and
seventies.

B.6:  Oh, yeah, some great sixties tunes.

A.7:  Yeah, I listen to K G P S, classic rock [laughter].

B.8:  K G P S in Dallas?

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  Oh, are you in Dallas?

A.11:  Uh, yeah, I'm in Plano.

B.12:  Uh, well, probably around the corner [laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  Um, yeah, that's a good station.  I listen to it every once in a while,
too.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  Do you play any instruments?

B.16:  No I don't.

A.17:  Never have?

B.18:  I'm not musically gifted at all.

A.19:  Well, I took piano lessons in fourth grade once for,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  one semester.  I'll never forget Mrs. Burkhalter.

B.22:  Ms. Burkhalter.

A.23:  She had that Nazi mentality [laughter].

B.24:  [Laughter] Uh, uh, where'd you grow up?

A.25:  Uh, in Milwaukee.

B.26:  Oh, okay.  

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  The, uh, yeah, the only thing how to play on the piano is that two handed
thing, or the two person thing.

A.29:  Chopsticks.

B.30:  No, it's not chopsticks.  It's the other one that has the, um, oh, I don't
even, I don't, I don't know enough about music to do it.  But, you, the bottom
person uses two hands and the top person just uses one hand, and it's this
little melody.

A.31:  Okay.

B.32:  It may have been a girl thing.

A.33:  Well, I have no idea what that is [laughter].

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  I just know I hated it, but I took up trumpet after that, and ended up
playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band.

B.36:  Oh, really.

A.37:  Which was fun.

B.38:  Yeah, I went to, I went to, uh, Rice, and we had the marching owl band --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- which is quite a, it's not known for its musical abilities, more so its,
um, comedy abilities.

A.41:  Oh, we had a great time in the band.  My, uh, director was heavy into the
big bands.  So we played a lot of tunes by Glen Miller --

B.42:  Oh yeah,

A.43:  -- Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and people like that.

B.44:  Well, that, that was fun.

A.45:  Well, it was a lot of fun, plus I got to get to go to all the athletic
events free [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter] Yeah, that has its plusses for sure.

A.47:  Well, which, uh, sixties, uh, rock bands do you like the best?

B.48:  Oh, well, Beatles --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- (( )) Clearwater Revival, uh, Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was
still all four.

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  Um, there, uh, Black Sabbath did a few albums that I really like
[laughter].

A.53:  Is that right?

B.54:  Yeah --

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  -- they, I know, it's kind of strange.  Um, Elton John is more seventies.

A.57:  Yeah, certainly, but, uh, 

B.58:  Yellow Brick Road.

A.59:  Right, uh-huh.

B.60:  I love that album.

A.61:  Yeah, I think I've got all those [laughter].

B.62:  Yeah, I had Yellow Brick Road and something happened to it.  It escaped 
me --

A.63:  Um.

B.64:  -- it was sometime in college and, never have seen it again.

A.65:  Oh, I started my, uh, music collection in college when I started winning
radio contests.

B.66:  How'd you win radio contests?

A.67:  Well, they would, uh, tell you to call in and be caller number nine and
win.  So I had a touch tone telephone in college, and, uh, I just started
calling in and winning all kinds of contests.  I had forty record albums
before I even had a stereo to play them on, to play them on.

B.68:  [Laughter] That's great.

A.69:  I ended up winning about, uh, two hundred and thirty radio contests in two
school years.  So I accumulated my record collection mostly from that.

B.70:  That's incredible.  I've never won, not one thing, from a radio station.  I
haven't tried --

A.71:  It was,

B.72:  -- I probably haven't tried two hundred and thirty times.

A.73:  Yeah, well, that was in Madison.  I, I won about four times a week.  It
doesn't have near the population that Dallas has.  The contests here are a lot
more competitive.

B.74:  Yeah. Have you ever won in Dallas?

A.75:  Um, yeah, but not the same type of contests.  They have contests on the
radio in the morning, and I think I won one of the movie mystery contests one
time.

B.76:  Um.

A.77:  They sent me a small flag in the mail that, whi-, which had postage due
[laughter].

B.78:  You're kidding me.

A.79:  No, it was a,

B.80:  Oh, it's not, it's probably not quite the same.  

A.81:  It wasn't much of a victory.  Actually I did win tickets to the, to a
Chicago and a Beach Boys concert.

B.82:  I saw the-, I went to a Beach Boys concert.  I like them, too.  Um, I've
never been to a Chicago concert.  Bet it was great.

A.83:  Uh, yeah, they were, uh, they were very good.  I was impressed.

B.84:  Yeah, Chicago was great, too.

A.85:  Every now and then I'll go ahead and make another tape, and, uh, record a
bunch of, uh, old tunes, like the Loving Spoonful, Grateful Dead, something
from the Birds, Rolling Stones.  I enjoy listening to those old tunes.  They
don't play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more.  You have to pick the
right station.

B.86:  Yeah, I use my scan button a lot.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  Whole lot [laughter].  I enjoy mainly the old, the older rock and roll
tunes, rather than.  A lot of the new stuff, the lyrics are so repetitive --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- that I just kind of get lost in it.

A.91:  I, uh, yeah, I haven't made any kind of effort to keep up on recent music,
especially in rock and roll.  There's not just too much, uh, new stuff that's,
well, it's not as creative.

B.92:  It doesn't seem to be.

A.93:  And the lyrics aren't as, uh, inspiring [laughter] if you want to call it
that.

B.94:  Yeah, yeah, some of the tunes, used to, you know, you felt like you needed
to go out and do something about it.

A.95:  Yeah, lot of pop music out that just isn't very thrilling.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  Course the head bangers, I stay away from those entirely.

B.98:  [Laughter] Is there still that type of music available?

A.99:  Certainly is.  Just turn on M T V any night.

B.100:  Oh, no.  I've got small children [laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  [Laughter] I don't trust M T V.  

A.103:  Probably playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or groups like that.

B.104:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I, uh, I tried when, um, I guess I was in junior high,
high school, when, uh, Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody, I tried to,
you know, really go the whole way, and I couldn't go with even, with most of
Led Zeppelin's music, I didn't enjoy it.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  And some of the stuff, you know, the classics, they were fine.  But some of
it was just too heavy even then.

A.107:  I always like the easier listening rock, the Crosby Stills Nash and 
Young --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- Eagles --

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  -- uh, in more recent, Billy Joel, very talented.  

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Z Z Top is different, very creative.  They really, uh, made, uh, quite a
transition.  They used to be almost a country band.

B.114:  Uh-huh,

A.115:  uh, playing such 

B.116:  yeah they play, they play some, they get some play time on the country
stations even.

A.117:  Yeah, such classics as La Grange, and Touche.  

B.118:  Yeah -- 

A.119:  And [laughter],

B.120:  -- I've still got my Fandango album.

A.121:  Right.

B.122:  That one didn't get lost in college.

A.123:  But, uh, they, they really did change.  

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  All of a sudden they became a top forty type group --

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  -- appealing to the younger crowd.

B.128:  Yeah, they've got, they've, now they've got some good videos.

A.129:  Uh, very good videos, yeah, I'm kind of impressed [laughter].

B.130:  [Laughter].

A.131:  Quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd.

B.132:  Yeah.

A.133:  To the pop audience, I guess you'd call it that.

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  Robert Palmer's got some pretty creative vid-, videos out too.

B.136:  I, I was thinking that.  Yeah, he's, his videos are pretty wild.  I like
his music, too.

A.137:  Oh, yeah.  And there are some that are, that get artsy to a point, like
Steve Winwood.

B.138:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  (( )) a little bit [laughter].  I know a little bit about
other groups.  I, uh, like I said, I listen to primarily contemporary
Christian.

A.139:  Uh-huh.

B.140:  And, uh, but I spend enough time on scan that I hear what i-, what is still
on the radio.

A.141:  Well, who's, uh, who's, who's popular now with the, uh, contemporary
Christian music?

B.142:  Oh --

A.143:  I don't listen too much,

B.144:  -- probably Amy Grant --

A.145:  Right, yeah, I've heard of her.

B.146:  -- is the biggest one.  Yeah, she's even, she's got a song right now that
playing on a few of the other stations.

A.147:  Uh-huh.

B.148:  It's called Baby, Baby.  It's, it's neat when you think about how she wrote
it and stuff --

A.149:  Yeah.

B.150:  -- otherwise the lyrics are kind of, it's just like Oh I love you, and I,
you know, this that and the other.

A.151:  [Laughter].

B.152:  But she write, she wrote when she was talking to her baby, and if you've
got a baby, I mean, it's kind of neat, thinking about it talking up, to your
baby.

A.153:  Right, that's interesting,

B.154:  And to, to an infant.  So, it makes it neater.

A.155:  Well, I don't think I'd ever make a song writer [laughter].

B.156:  [Laughter] My secretary has tried to be a song writer.  She's waiting for
her big time.

A.157:  Yeah, well, some people get lucky, and --

B.158:  Yeah,

A.159:  -- I guess if you're persistent enough, sometimes it works out.

B.160:  Well, I hope that it does for her.  She deserves it.  She's a nice person.

A.161:  Uh-huh.

B.162:  So, I, uh,

A.163:  Well, what station plays that type of music?

B.164:  Uh, ninety-four point one --

A.165:  Okay.

B.166:  -- is K L T Y.

A.167:  All right.

B.168:  And, uh, then there's ninety point one, is K C B I.  They do more, uh, they
spend a lot of time with, uh, oh this preaching kind of stuff.

A.169:  Right, uh-huh.

B.170:  So, I like music, I like listening to music, so I don't usually listen to K
C B I.  And then there's another one called Journey that's somewhere in
between the two of those.  It's in between ninety and ninety-four.

A.171:  Right.

B.172:  I think it's ninety-two.

A.173:  Maybe I'll tune in to one of those some time.

B.174:  Ninety-four point one is fine.

A.175:  All right.

B.176:  I mean, it's, it's, it's mainly, um, just family oriented stuff.  I mean,
yeah, it's ve-, its definitely Christian, but it's not, it's not hymns
[laughter].

A.177:  Right, okay [laughter].

B.178:  [Laughter] You know, it's not Amazing Grace every other time.

A.179:  Okay, yeah, I still feel like every time, if I ever feel like reminiscing
over the old stuff, I'll go ahead and throw on a sixties tape.

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  Get something from the Guess Who, or [laughter] ...
