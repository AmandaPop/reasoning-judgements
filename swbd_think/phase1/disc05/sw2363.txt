=============================================================================

A.1:  I li-, I like our benefits.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  I'm pretty satisfied with them.  Um, [sigh] the only thing that I think I
would change is the network, the hospital networking.  I have Aetna Insurance.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  You know, the company insurance and,

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  and wou-, I just think I shou-, would like to go to my own hospital where
my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list.  That's the,

B.8:  Well [breathing], 

A.9:  only thing I have against it [rattling].

B.10:  I, I can seeing both sides of that issue and I think that, uh, it's just
a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to.

A.11:  What if that, what if, because of, because of expense is that,

B.12:  The, uh, cost are just going out of sight and, and, uh, you know, it's
either increase the premiums or try to, uh, everybody work together to try to
curtail the cost that's the way I see it.

A.13:  Yeah.  Do you, do you use Aetna?

B.14:  Yes, I do.

A.15:  Yeah.  You know it's pretty good.  They're really fast on paying.  Uh, all
my claims, you know, I don't use it that much to be real honest with you.  I'm
alone and, and, you know, it's hard for me.  I don't go to the doctor unless
I'm really sick [laughter],

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  and I don't get sick that much, so, you know, sometimes I don't even come
up with the deductible in a year [breathing]. 

B.18:  We've used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but, uh, I
don't use it that much either, uh, of course, I'm using it right now
[laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter] (( )).

B.20:  I had a little skiing accident here in this last month and [laughter],

A.21:  Oh, no.  Are you [laughter],

B.22:  so I'm taking advantage of it right now. 

A.23:  Did you break something?

B.24:  Yeah, I cracked a collarbone,

A.25:  [Breathing]. 

B.26:  separated the shoulder a little bit.

A.27:  Oh, my God.

B.28:  Nothing too major [laughter].

A.29:  Oh, did you, are you on L O A?

B.30:  No.  No, I didn't even miss work,

A.31:  You didn't?  [laughter].

B.32:  Just stick it in a sling and go on [laughter].

A.33:  Oh, my gosh.  Well, some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing
accident.  Somebody up here, he's head of [lipsmack] oh, wel-, not welfare
but probations or something on, I can't think of what he's the head of, he
skied into a tree --

B.34:  Huh-uh.

A.35:  -- and killed himself.  Forty-one years old.

B.36:  Um.

A.37:  So.

B.38:  I tell you, getting back to the benefits [laughter] --

A.39:  Okay.

B.40:  -- I was just thinking about, uh, something, uh, uh, kind of close to one
of our guys in H R D, there, personnel and they, uh, he's been talking about
this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and, uh, I think that's a
interesting concept.  Have you ever heard of that?

A.41:  Huh-uh.

B.42:  [Throat_clearing] Be kind of like smorgasbord of benefits where you could,
uh, tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth.  In
other words, if you were, uh, interested in having more vacation you could do
that and then take, cutback a little bit on some, uh, other area --

A.43:  Huh.

B.44:  -- or, you know, increase your hospital benefits if you were in, had a lot
kids or something like that,

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  there.  Or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little
bit and,

A.47:  Have more vacation [laughter].

B.48:  Yeah.  Whatever, I mean it's, uh, you know, across the board.

A.49:  Huh.  I hadn't heard of that.

B.50:  I guess, yeah, it's something they talked about for several years now.  I
don't know if that he are getting any closer.  The problem is that some people
might go a little bit overboard [laughter] in picking out what they want and
leave themselves to short in other areas, I guess.

A.51:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, I think T I has good (( )) benefits (( )).

B.52:  Well, in most cases I'd have to agree with you.  I think,

A.53:  I think we have,

B.54:  the, uh, profit sharing is a little uh, [laughter] a little lacking right
now.

A.55:  Oh, yeah.  Well,

B.56:  And for the past few years.

A.57:  Yeah. 

B.58:  But like they always say, you know, got a good profit sharing plan, just no
profit.

A.59:  But no profits right now.

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  I think when we, when we start showing profit, which I hope we do pretty
soon [laughter] --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- um, that you know, because at one time they had good profit sharing from
what,

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  I understand.  I, I didn't get in on it unfortunately but, 

B.66:  Well, I've had a few good years but not too many in the fifteen I've been
here.

A.67:  See I've only been here four.

B.68:  Um.

A.69:  So, I'm just trying to hang on to my job [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  ((The way)) all these cutbacks and stuff this is pretty scary.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  But, but I really like working for the, T I,

B.74:  Yeah.  It's a good company.

A.75:  I think.  

B.76:  I don't know what division your in but we, uh, 

A.77:  Uh, I hate to tell you, I'm in payroll.

B.78:  Oh, really?  [laughter].

A.79:  [Laughter] But, uh, I, 

B.80:  I got a, I got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program.

A.81:  I love it. You don't like it?

B.82:  Well, I think it's a great concept but I think you've, uh, you've left too
many, uh, I'm a supervisor and, I (( )), I (( )) the thing,

A.83:  [Laughter].

B.84:  it, it just doesn't make logical sense, you know.  In other words, it
always keep jumping back up to the person, you know, where you enter your own
I D number?

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  The logical thing would have been had to go, had it go to the, the employee
number so that's the one you're going to do the next action on the change, you
know.  And there's a lot of little things like that in there but [sniffing] it,
it could probably be corrected easily.  I don't know if anybody has griped
about it [laughter] or not.

A.87:  Oh, we get gripes but, all in all, it, it works pretty good for everybody,

B.88:  Yeah,

A.89:  You know.

B.90:  I think the concept's great, you know. 

A.91:  And, and I'm sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they'll
work them out.  It, it's been a tough year to get this all done and get,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  everybody on it.

B.94:  I'll bet.  Yeah.

A.95:  It's, uh, but it's showing it's rewards now I think.  Uh, the stop pays and
people coming off of L O A, and everything.  People are really getting the
hang of it now.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  And boy in the beginning, what division are you in?

B.98:  Fourteen.

A.99:  Oh, fourteen.  Well, okay, division one was worse [laughter].

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  Because that's the biggest division.

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  And boy when we put them on, oh, my God, the phone.  You'd hang up and it
would ring [laughter].  It was just bad.

B.104:  They must have kept you hopping there,

A.105:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's, it's doing pretty well now.  I think everybody has
got,

B.106:  Oh, yeah.  I think it's, uh, definitely got good, definitely got a right
idea.

A.107:  See, I don't have to go in and approve time okay.  So I,

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  I really don't know what you all are going through to be honest with you.
To sit there in option one and approve everybody's time.  I didn't do it
before and I don't do it now so I don't have anything to compare that with.
For us in communicating with peo-, with everybody --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- and, and being able to see what you are doing and everything.  It's
really been a, a, a godsend.  It's been wonderful.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Getting everybody on the same system has been great and an easy system that
everybody seems to be able to learn.  You know,

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  it's been really good.

B.116:  Well, that's, that's one of the benefits that I, uh,

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  you know, question.

A.119:  That's a T I benefit too [laughter].

B.120:  [Laughter] Well, you know, knowing a little bit about programming and a
little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything, I
just could see where he could made it so much better, you know, just by a few
little more [noise] I don't know what you'd say.  (( )) to the right detail
and stuff.

A.121:  I don't know who planned it all or how, I don't even know how they came
about, uh, agreeing on what all to do and with, I know they're were
programmers involved and I know the manager and, the two managers and, uh,
payroll were involved in supervisors and all but, uh, I came in last year out
of one of the shops, so, uh, it was all new to me.  I had to learn the old
system and the new system.

B.122:  Um.  Uh-huh.

A.123:  [Laughter] That was fun.

B.124:  Um.

A.125:  That was fun [laughter].  And then after I had finally got it all down,
they said now forget the old system.  Oh, yeah, sure [laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter] Uh, too bad [talking].

A.127:  Thanks a lot.  So, so for me the new system really was, was easier, you
know, it really, it really was, is easier to work,

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  I think.  So, but that's just from my point of view.  Like I said I don't
have to sit down and depending on how many work rooms you have and everything,
you know, it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody.

B.130:  Well, they made it, uh, extremely, uh, easy for the employee, uh, I can
just, especially if it's standard week, they can just, don't even have to get
in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their
employee number and away it goes.

A.131:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you have to go in and, and individually,

B.132:  Yeah,

A.133:  check everybody [noise].

B.134:  it's, um, you can see some areas that could be improved.

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  I think they must have worked on it because I've noticed one correction
come through already it looks like.

A.137:  They're several things that have, uh, changed already on it.  And now
you're going to ask me what and I can't tell you offhand.  I just know,

B.138:  That's all right.

A.139:  we've had several changes [laughter].

B.140:  No, I'm not (( )).  I only worry with it one time a week when I'm, well,
twice really [laughter],

A.141:  [Laughter].

B.142:  When I'm (( )) and then,

A.143:  Yeah.  So well, 

B.144:  I've had a chance to, I had a chance to terminate and, uh, L O A and back
to L O A.

A.145:  That, I think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on
was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and
it's easy.  And it's so easy that people go,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  was that all I have to do and,

B.148:  Yeah, right.

A.149:  and you know, [laughter] there's got to be something else I have to do
and I'm, no, it's just really easy.  And setting up your own cost, your own,
uh, work groups now too.  Where as we had to do it before,

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number --

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  -- and you got it, you know.  So, uh, just put people in, pick a number and
put people in it and it's a work group.  So, you know, I think, uh, it's
really a lot simpler than the old one.

B.154:  Speaking of, uh, let's see big corporate benefits, I wonder if, uh, I
wonder if they loo-, have you ever heard of this administaff type thing, this
staff leasing that a lot of companies do?  [sniffing].

A.155:  Huh-uh.

B.156:  They, uh, that's kind of a new thing that come along and, uh, benefit,
well, they, uh, what they do is, uh, ((small)) I guess it's basically for
smaller companies that don't want to have all the payroll hassle and
everything.

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  You fire all your people and they, uh,

A.159:  [Laughter].

B.160:  they hire them then they lease them back to you and they do
all the paperwork and provide the benefit.  Of course, they have ...
