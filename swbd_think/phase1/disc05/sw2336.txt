======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what kind of car are you thinking about getting?

@B.2:  Well, none at the moment [laughter].

A.3:  Well, when you decide to.

B.4:  [Laughter]  No, no, no.  I currently drive a, a Ford Taurus.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And I would ima-, I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car,
a new car, I will go with the Taurus or something similar, uh, in that regard.

A.7:  So you like the Ford?

B.8:  Absolutely.  I have had it for about two years now --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and it's uh, [inhaling] it's everything it's supposed to be.  Uh, I
haven't had a minutes trouble with it --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and, uh, the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus, but I
still feel a little, even after two years, I still feel uncomfortable driving
it, because I had a Honda before that --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and so it's a little bit larger.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  But that's the only, the only difference that I see, really.  But I would,
my, my criteria would be, at the moment it would be, uh, American, uh,
personally, an-,

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's the, this, the car I had before this one was a
Thunderbird --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- as a matter of fact, and, uh, I loved it, I really did.  But, uh, um, I
finally decided to go check out what the, uh, what the, uh, foreign cars were.
So I bought myself a, a, a Nissan --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- a two forty S X.  But even though I love the car I've got now, I think
my next car will probably be American again --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American, I always have,
up until now.  I just for one time decided to go outside.  So.

B.24:  Well, my wife drives a, still has a, a Honda --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- Accord, and it's a very, it's an excellent automobile.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And, uh, but, you know, price and so forth, I'm not a real car fan.  So, I,
I, I do not, uh, opt for, uh, something that would be, [breathing] you know,
expensive --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- you know, I want, I want something that's serviceable, serviceable,
something that I can use --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and, uh, and I, and with the Taurus, I have a Taurus, uh, L X, and it's,
you know, you're talking when you think about price, it's several thousand
dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those
lines.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And as I said, as far I'm concerned, it, it has been extremely, uh, uh,
serviceable and everything I wanted.

A.35:  Well, Ford's done a real good job in the last, uh, say, ten years --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- or at least the last five to te-, six years, so, of really turning
around their, um, quality, I think, um.

B.38:  Oh, I think so too.  Now, I, you know, in travel and renting automobiles --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- uh, in, I've driven, you know, Chevrolet automobiles and so for-, and
Dodge, and I, if it's Chevrolet, I just will not touch it.

A.41:  Um.

B.42:  Uh, I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus.  I purchased a,
[breathing] a Chevy, um, Citation.

A.43:  Oh, yeah, those were not good cars.

B.44:  And, uh, I was ready to get rid of it [laughter] two months after I bought
it,

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And, uh, so I, I shopped around, and I would, I probably, if I had thought
I, uh, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, uh,
uh, an Accord --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- or even a, a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan --

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  -- or Toyota, and, uh, but it was just, I had, I have a friend who, uh, has
a, uh, an auto shop, and he purchased one of the first Sables that was, uh,
manufactured for his wife, a Sable station wagon, and he just absolutely swore
by it.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, you know, comparable,
comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A
M F M radio, and all these other things --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- uh, it was just, there was no, there was no comparison.  Uh, the only
thing that I find, you know, if I would have anything against it is that it
still has that soft American ride.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  Uh, not, uh, that's about the only thing I find, you know, disadvantageous
to it.  But, my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something
that's serviceable, and I, you know, I drive around a lot, but, uh, and it's,
you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.  I can drive for, you know,
ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  But those are my criteria, and I, I probably in another six months to a
year or something will probably start looking around again, and if there's
something out there that, uh, is comparable to what I have now, I'll go ahead
and get it.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  You know, the only thing I'm looking,

B.60:  [Throat_clearing].

A.61:  at right now, um, I just, I just bought, you know, the Nissan that I've
got about, uh, say, nine months ago, I guess it was [throat_clearing].  So the
only thing that, that would get me to change cars right now would be if, see,
at the moment I'm single, and if I were to get married and have a family that
would have to have something to do with it.  But, uh, I don't have any plans
for probably another two, three years of even looking, you know.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  Uh, cars are too expensive right now to, uh --

B.64:  [Laughter] I, yeah.

A.65:  -- to even think about buying new cars every couple of years, you know it's

B.66:  In our parking lots, uh, two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda
sports cars.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  Uh, I, I can't remember what the name is.  It's the thirty-five or forty
thousand dollar one, whatever it is, and it looked, it resembled a Mazaratti
{name of car} --

A.69:  Um.

B.70:  -- very, very closely.  And [throat_clearing] it's an absolutely beautiful
automobile --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and well appointed and so forth, but to pay that much money for an
automobile, uh, is just, I can't, I can't conceive of doing that [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah, that's, uh, I went to a, a car show down here about, uh, about two
weeks ago, and, um, you know, of course they had the normal, the Ford, the,
the Chevrolet, that stuff.  But then you started looking at the, uh, uh, they
had Ferrari there, they had, uh, B M W and all these other kinds of cars.  And
Ferrari didn't even let you near the car, I mean, they were, that's how
expensive they were.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And then you saw, uh, hundred thousand dollar cars, you saw eighty thousand
dollar cars, and even, even though I, I, I do enjoy cars, I enjoy, um, driving
them, I enjoy, uh, riding in them and everything, but, I can't see buying, or
paying more for a car than I would for a house, you know.

B.76:  That's true.  Well,

A.77:  That doesn't seem likely.

B.78:  The difference there is, too, uh, is between us is that I am not really
crazy about driving.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  I never have been, since, you know, my parents had to force me to get my
driver's license when I was young --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- when I was sixteen.  So I've never really cared.  Now, what I was, you
know, before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do
little sports car racing.  I never, it was never my own car --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- it was always someone else's.  And that sort of thing I enjoy, but to go
out and drive, uh, never has really been, had any appeal to me --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

@@B.86:  -- in that regard.  So [inhaling].  Well I guess we've discussed that
enough don't you think.

A.87:  I think so.

B.88:  We won't, we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, uh, system to shut us
off, uh, tonight.  That's happened to me almost every time I've,

A.89:  That's happened to me once,

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  So, uh,

B.92:  Well, it's very easy when you get a top-, you get on a topic that, you
know, you enjoy.

A.93:  Yeah, like, uh, I think the one time I did it was on Sau-, the Mid, the Mid
East, the crisis out there.

B.94:  Oh, yeah.

A.95:  That was, had a great conversation, but, uh, then they came off and
[laughter] told us we couldn't do it any more.  So.

B.96:  Well I was talking to a lady last evening, and we were talking about
fishing, and, uh, we were cut off, well, we were told to quit.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Okay.  Well, you have a pleasant evening.

A.99:  You too.

B.100:  Take care.

A.101:  Bye-bye.

B.102:  Good-bye.
