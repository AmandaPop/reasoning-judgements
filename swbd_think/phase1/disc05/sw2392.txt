REMARKS:        Speaker B, the man, was very difficult to understand; very
muffled, as if maybe he were pressing the telephone up against his mouth.
Radio or television in background.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, we don't do much eating out.

@B.2:  Oh well [laughter] you wonder how these topics get chosen.  Where was the
last place you went out to eat?

A.3:  [Laughter] Billy's.

B.4:  [Laughter] Well, last place we went was, uh, uh, oh, we went to Popeye's
Fried Chicken.  Actually, it was a drive through.

A.5:  Yeah, well, uh, ours usually consists of McDonald's.  I've got two young
kids, and they love McDonald's.

B.6:  Well, our, our kids are a little older.  Actually we got a seventeen year
old and a fourteen year old, but but we still wind up, I still, I like fast
food reasonably well.

A.7:  Yeah, well, I know, it put on some weight for us.  So we stayed away them,
or tried to, but I love to take the kids.  They say what do you look for to
bring by to look at to come back to --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- I was talking to my husband while I was listening to, they was trying to
find a (( )), and I said it's the toy, uh, uh, the play yard out in the front
yard [laughter] that McDonald's has.

B.10:  Well, how old are your kids?

A.11:  Four and two.

B.12:  Oh, so they really like that sort of stuff.

A.13:  Yeah, the-, they'd rather go out there and play in the yard than eat.

B.14:  I can remember many times, though, uh, uh, it's interesting though that,
that, you know particularly when you're traveling and you go some place, you
stop at a McDonald's with the big playground, when th-, you know, when the
kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while.

A.15:  Yeah, well, we've took a, we was living out in Memphis, and we used to
drive back and forth to Louisville.  That's where we usually from, Louisville,
Kentucky.  And, you know, we'd stop at the fast foods there.  Uh, usually I
like to go just to get the kids out, have them in a confined space where I
can, uh, sit down and relax and be able to watch them too.

B.16:  Yeah, that's, that's really nice that they started doing that, because
it's, the problem is you take them to some place nice and you know, the, even
a place where they have to sit down, even if they are really good kids, they
get, they get bored in a hurry.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  And uh, yeah, you know, we, now we're a little older we can go to.  I, I
still like, um, I like buffets.

A.19:  Yeah, they got a couple all you can eat down here, and, uh, we haven't went
to them yet, but I've been threatening my husband that we'll go.

B.20:  Yeah, well, have you been in the area very long?

A.21:  No, we've only, well, we've been in Texas for two years, a little under two
years.

B.22:  Huh.

A.23:  So uh, not really, I don't know it too well.

B.24:  You say you in Denison?

A.25:  Yes.

B.26:  Oh okay, so we were, I was in Sherman, um, um, last month or the, I took
a, I sponsored a youth group up there, and it was funny, we went to a, uh, oh
we must have had thirty of us, and we went into a Pizza Hut, and you wander
into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd, and they sort of hate to see you
coming.  They get the business, but with a crowd of people, it's, uh, it, it
it's kind of funny.  And we went in first and then it was so crowded and we
went, and I'm trying to think, it's right off, anyway, I don't know if it's
Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn.  Anyway we went to another one and, uh, they, the
rates there are fairly reasonable but, you know, even those places are
starting to have, you know, video games and things for kids.  Your kids play
video games?

A.27:  Oh my son does.  He's the four year old.  I've got a Nintendo that he plays
with.

B.28:  Oh gives him something to amuse him while there, uh,

A.29:  Well he likes those crane games, you know, where you try to win a toy.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  He likes, every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy.

B.32:  Well, do you have, do you have any like Chucky Cheese?

A.33:  Well, I remember Chucky Cheese was down in Lewisville.  Uh, I haven't seen
one here.

B.34:  Well, got one in Richardson, pardon me, I try and think, there, there,
there's a couple of those that they combined and it's a combination pizza
parlor and all kinds of,

A.35:  Game room and toy room.

B.36:  Yeah, and they have the room full of balls and,

A.37:  Yeah, Show Biz Pizza.

B.38:  Yeah, yeah, Show Biz, that's the name of it.

A.39:  That's what it is, Show Biz, yeah.

B.40:  You like the pizza at Show Biz?

A.41:  Yeah, it's alright.  I haven't seen one down here.  I think where there was
one in Memphis when we was there --

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  -- uh, and it was great.  Stev-, The only thing that Steven didn't like,
that's my son, was uh, you know, they had those dancing bears and stuff --

B.44:  Yeah, yeah.

A.45:  -- it scared him to death.

B.46:  Well, you know, they're so large.  

A.47:  Yeah --

B.48:  They animated it.

A.49:  -- I think that's what it was.  But he'd rather go and ride on the rides.
You know, they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff,

B.50:  Yeah --

A.51:  and,

B.52:  -- that's really, uh, yeah we were, until the kids got older we'd go there
and you know it was, um, I'll date myself a little bit, but it's remarkable
the number of those things that they make.  I guess, I think Show Biz and
Chucky Cheese, and all those, I think they merged or something, but it still,
it's still quite popular.  I have to, I'm not sure, the pizza was okay, I
mean.

A.53:  Well, we went one time, uh, one of my ex boyfriends had taken me.  This was
years and years ago.  And I had taken my younger brother.  He's about twelve
years younger than I am.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And, uh, I remember eating their pizza, and they had put anchovies and all
this on it, I mean, they piled it up --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and it was the nastiest tasting pizza,

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  I've ever tasted [laughter].

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  Do you ever go to Mast-, Mister Gatti's, or there's a Godfather's down in,
uh, Memphis, and that was a good pizza.  I've never tasted a better pizza.

B.62:  Uh, Well, do you ever go out to eat at a higher, higher end type, more
expensive places?

A.63:  No.  The last expensive place I went to, it was a Shoney's.  Huh, and we
went there every Tuesday night, 'n, or Saturday night when we was playing,
when I was playing softball --

B.64:  Huh.

A.65:  -- with a softball league down in Memphis.

B.66:  Huh.

A.67:  We went, and that's the most expensive place we went to.

B.68:  Well, we got a lot of barbecue places around, around the Dallas area.
Spring Creek Barbecue, that's right in Richardson, and it, uh, I like the
barbecue there, and it-, uh, it's fairly reasonable.  You can get, uh, it, if,
I mean, if, you know, you go through the line and pick up your food.

A.69:  Well it's kind of hard to take two kids at certain nice place.

B.70:  Yeah, it is.

A.71:  Number one they bug all the other people, and, uh, or so we think they do,
and, uh-huh --

B.72:  They're probably just being normal, though.

A.73:  -- yeah, but, I don't know, I, every time I set up a baby-sitter to go out
and do something, my husband, uh, nixes it and says we'll stay home this day
and,

B.74:  Well, when, it's funny, when the-, when the-, when the kids get a lot
older, though, you can do as you please.  Our son graduates this year and
we're kind of looking forward to,

A.75:  Yeah, well I can't, well, you know, I say I can't wait for my kids to grow
up, but I believe I'm going to miss this age when they're gone.

B.76:  Yeah, yeah, they're,

A.77:  I, but I do want my freedom back.  I'm sure my husband does too.

@@B.78:  You know, it's kind of like wanting to talk, and you know, but you, but
then they learned to say no.

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  It's kind of funny, uh, th-, th-, and now they get older our son's a senior
in high school, will talk to us, but you know, you know, it's mostly,

A.81:  Not really anything really important in his life.

B.82:  No, No, no, it's sort of, I guess it's a little disappointing, but I
suppose it's just the way life is.

A.83:  Yeah, I, I can-, you know, I can't relate to that just yet.  Uh, now, I
mean, my daughter, she doesn't know the word yes, it's no every time you turn
around --

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  -- you know, and my son, I can't describe him, it's, I don't know, why, or
[laughter] you know. I can't relate to a seventeen year old yet.

B.86:  [Laughter] Well, you know, everybody says you'd be surprised how quickly it
comes, but it, it uh, we moved here in seventy-six, daughter was six weeks old
and hard to believe in nearly fifteen years.

A.87:  Uh, you sound like you got a Louisiana accent.

B.88:  No, I, I, I grew up in, uh, in Alabama.

A.89:  Alabama.  Okay.  Alright.  I guess, close to the Louisiana border?

B.90:  Well no, actually I was, until I was eight I lived in, in, in south, uh,
western Georgia, and then we moved over into central part of Alabama.

A.91:  Oh, okay.

B.92:  But I've been away from there for, goodness, I haven't lived in Alabama
since nineteen sixty-five, that's been a long time ago.  I lived several
places, Europe, and Asia and,

A.93:  Military?

B.94:  Yeah, I spent,

A.95:  My husband was in the Navy.

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  What were you in?

B.98:  I was in the Air Force.

A.99:  Air Force, uh, I, he tried to get in there.  They wouldn't take him
[laughter].

B.100:  [Laughter] Yeah, I was, I went in in nineteen and sixty-five when they
were drafting people, in fact my father was on the draft board.  So,

A.101:  Well, uh, I was born in sixty-five, so I can't say that.  My husband was
only five years old then, too [laughter].

B.102:  Yeah, well, it, things are different when everybody, in fact, that was
Vietnam era.  It was, in fact, I went to Vietnam myself.

A.103:  Well, uh,

B.104:  It was, it's a different world.

A.105:  Yeah, well, I know uh, ju-, just out of curiosity, how do you feel about
these guys getting a welcome home that you all didn't get.

B.106:  Well, see, I never had a hard time coming home.  It didn't uh, you know,
there all these people who spit on them and all these kinds of things.  I came
home and got married and I, I never, uh, uh, uh, I could, now, but I didn't,
and I mentioned that to my wife, and she said, well you never wore your
uniform when you were off duty.  But I didn't, I flew into Los Angeles, but I
had um, when I was in Vietnam, but by then, when we landed, actually went into
Field (( )) and I changed out of my uniform, in civilian clothes.  And I
never, course I stayed, I stayed in the Air Force a number of years, but I
never had any problems, um, and all this, all this.  Of course I wasn't in
combat either, I was a staff weenie.
