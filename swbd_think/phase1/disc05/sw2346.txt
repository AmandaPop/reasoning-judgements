============================================================================

A.1:  [Hum] {sounds like a signal being done in the middle of the hum} Do you
have any pets?

B.2:  [Talking] {voices in background} Uh, right now I have, um, uh, two
longhair miniature dachshunds.  I also raise, uh, peacocks, ducks.  I have
three different kinds of ducks and I raise geese and rabbits.  But the, uh,
uh, the dogs and the peacocks are pets.  The rest of them, we, we do those for
food.

A.3:  You must have a little farm, then.    

B.4:  Yeah.  Yeah, we live out in the country.  So.  What do you have?

A.5:  Well, I'm a, I'm a sort of a city dweller and I got a bunch of kids so
they've got to have their pets.  And, uh, we've, uh, lost a few this year, but
we've still got a dog and a bird left [noise].

B.6:  Uh-huh.    

A.7:  And uh, the, the kids maul the dog something awful.  They pull his tail,
and bend his ears and, uh, have a good time playing with him and the dog is
pretty, uh, tolerant of them.

B.8:  Yeah.  That's, that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can
play with like that. How old are the kids?

A.9:  Well, they're, uh, seven, eight, and, uh, ten.  And,

B.10:  Huh.  You said your from D C?  #I have t-,# 

A.11:  #Yes. Well, right# outside in, uh, Falls Church, Virginia.  

B.12:  Oh, okay.  I have a, m-, my, I have a daughter, I think she's in Spring
Field.  I'm not sure.  She's around there somewhere.  She just got her a new
apartment.

A.13:  Yeah.    

B.14:  And my other daughter and son-in-law live in Germantown.   

A.15:  Uh-huh.    

B.16:  So there,    

A.17:  Well, you've got part of your family up here then.    

B.18:  Yeah, yeah.  So it's, it's interesting to talk to somebody from that
general vicinity.

A.19:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I just got a new bird for, uh, little Deb at, uh,
Christmas time, and we're still in the process of, uh, getting him tamed.
He's a little parakeet.  Yellow one.

B.20:  Yeah.    

A.21:  And, uh, we let him fly around the house and the dog being a Golden
Retriever, he, he pays close attention whenever that bird is flying around
[ringing] {phone}.

B.22:  I wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him, though. 

A.23:  Well, the, the previous bird, he, uh, got a hold of it, uh, two or three
times.  And, uh, I found that, uh, well, one occasion, I, I heard a little
noise and I saw the dog walking away, and I looked over and I see some
feathers sticking out of his mouth.

B.24:  Uh, oh.    

A.25:  [Laughter] and I grabbed the dog by the tail real quick, and I discovered
if you yank a dog's tail real hard, he lets go of a bird.  #[laughter] Uh,#

B.26:  #[Laughter] Next# time you'll have to try a bigger bird.   

A.27:  Yeah.  (( )) a bigger bird or a larger cat to take care of the dog
[laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter] We have some friends that, in fact, the ones that we bought one
of the dogs from, they also raise birds and they have, uh, uh,

A.29:  [Ringing] {phone}.

B.30:  two or three different kinds of, of parrots and then they raise finches and
parakeets and they show.  And h-, and he was showing me his parakeets and, and
he calls them an English parakeet.  And he said their marking is a little
different.

A.31:  Uh-huh.    

B.32:  Have, d-, did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets?

A.33:  Well, there is a, a neighbor of mine used to, uh, uh, know quite a bit
about, uh, raising parakeets, and she had, uh, a lot of connections when it
came to getting good birds.  So, she was knowledgeable in all the different
breeds and colorations and so forth,

B.34:  Yeah.    

A.35:  and knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet.  Uh, I
had a parakeet many years ago that, uh, she got for me, and it lived to be a,
a pretty old bird.  And was extremely friendly.  Uh, I, I couldn't keep him in
his own cage.  He just, uh, flew lose in the house all the time.  Uh, but uh,
more recent years they moved away

B.36:  [Noise]. 

A.37:  and I've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop, and they don't seem
to be as healthy as, uh, one's you get from, uh, breeders.

B.38:  You might check, uh, some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an
aviary that you might be able to buy from there.

A.39:  Yeah.    

B.40:  That seems to be an up and coming business.  I know out there where we are
there's, there's, uh, a person on each side of our county that now have
aviaries.

A.41:  Uh-huh.    

B.42:  One of them is right out there close to us.  They're in the process of
building it up right now.  #I know,#

A.43:  #Well, we# found in general when you, you look for breeders, you don't find
them in the, uh, metropolitan areas.  They, you wind up going many miles out
of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for.

B.44:  Uh-huh.    

A.45:  We went looking for, uh, rabbits and we had to go all the way out to
Leesburg to find, uh, a rabbitry a few years back.  [ringing] {phone} Uh,
there weren't any, uh, rabbits available in this area, except little bunnies
available at the, uh, pet shops and we looked at them and decided they
weren't, uh, too healthy looking.

B.46:  Yeah.  That's the problem with buying them through the pet shops.  We have
that same problem here, too.  Yeah, but we've used it, we just have two
rabbits right now.  We have one doe and one buck,

A.47:  Uh-huh [ringing] {phone}.

B.48:  and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter.
We just got her.

A.49:  Yeah.    

B.50:  The, uh, we go-, we had, uh, one doe that we'd had her, let's see, it was
her second litter I guess, the first litter she had, she lost all but three,
uh, babies, and we raised those and then her second litter she wound up
killing all of them.

A.51:  Huh.    

B.52:  And it took her like three days, I guess, before she killed all of them, so
we've, we had to get rid of her.

A.53:  Yeah.    

B.54:  So, I, I wouldn't tolerate that.    

A.55:  That's pretty unusual because wh-, I've generally found that rabbits have
been very, uh, very good parents.

B.56:  [Door] Yeah, well this is the first time we've ever had one like that.  We
had been down, we had gone from having one buck and, and three does down to
one buck and just one doe.

A.57:  Uh-huh.    

B.58:  But that didn't work out too well so now we're, we're trying to build it
back up.

A.59:  Yeah, we had a rabbit 

B.60:  [Door]. 

A.61:  up until, uh, last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost
interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits.  Uh, I,
uh, w-, we had a tough time deciding on a name so I named him, uh, Mr. Tibbar.
And they wanted to know how I figured out that name and I said, well, it's
rabbit spelled backwards.

B.62:  [Laughter].  

A.63:  [Laughter] So, uh, one of my other daughters got a, uh, gerbil and they
came to me for a name and I said, well, name him Libreg.  And they said, well,
how did you get that name, I said, well, that's gerbil spelled backwards
[laughter] {faint}.

B.64:  [Laughter]  Now that's a good idea.    

A.65:  Well, they wouldn't let me name the dog.    

B.66:  No, that one would, might get you in trouble.  Yeah.  

A.67:  [Laughter].    

B.68:  Unless you called it Dog.    

A.69:  Well,

B.70:  We have been known to do that in the past.  We've, we've got a couple of
wild cats out there in our general vicinity and, you know, they're, they're
tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them, but they're not tame
enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything, so, you know,
those are just Big Cat and Little Cat.

A.71:  Yeah.  Well, we had, uh, I lived on a farm when I was [static] growing up,
and when we bought the farm there was, uh,

B.72:  [Door]. 

A.73:  couple of farm cats on the property and they were sort of tame.  Every now
and then they'd let you pet them.  But, uh, one of the cats, which we named
Bug Eyes, she had a litter of kittens

B.74:  [Noise]. 

A.75:  and she kept them away from the, uh, the house until they were pretty good
size kittens.  And they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them.  And one day
I went over to, I found them sleeping, and I went over and picked one of them
up, and it, boy, it was like picking up a buzz saw [laughter].

B.76:  Huh.  [noise] I bet it was.  Tha-, they do that, you know, they, they have
kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn, and the first time you try
to get around the kittens, you know, it's, you'd have to catch them with a,
uh, a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick.

A.77:  Yeah.  But I tried again a few weeks later but this time I put on some
leather gloves and my father still wondered what happened to those leather
gloves [laughter].

B.78:  [Laughter]  Did you in.    

@@A.79:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.    

B.80:  Well, it's been very nice talking to you.  

A.81:  (( )).

B.82:  I appreciate having the call.  And, uh, maybe we'll speak again on this
little test that they're trying to do.

A.83:  [Laughter] All right.    

B.84:  Okay.  Thank you.    

A.85:  Bye [/hum]. 

B.86:  Bye-bye  [/talking].
