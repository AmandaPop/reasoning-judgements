===========================================================================

B.1:  All right, well what kind of, uh restaurants, what type restaurants you
like to go to?

A.2:  Um,  casual ones, but with class, you know?  

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  Not too fancy but, uh, I, I won't go to a fast food place [laughter].  I
really can't stand those,

B.5:  Yeah.  

A.6:  uh,

B.7:  Um, do you like, I mean, what is it about, uh, the, the kind of restaurants
you go to that you like.  I mean, what makes you like I said what makes you
want come back?

A.8:  Um, quality of the food [laughter].  

B.9:  Is it?  Well, see, uh, qualities one thing but to me the, uh, not
necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real
important,

A.10:  Yeah. 

B.11:  To me.  Uh, I will go back to a place where, uh, I smile during the meal.
You know, and just, not just,

A.12:  Yeah.  

B.13:  because of the food but, I mean because either the waiter or the
waitresses ...

A.14:  You had a good time there. 

B.15:  yeah, exactly.  Uh that's real important to me.  I, I can't stand going to
a stuffy place,

A.16:  Yeah.  

B.17:  I mean it's just, that's not me.  Um, in your, you know, like you said
fast food restaurants aren't any good either,

A.18:  Uh-huh.  

B.19:  but, uh, you know I don't necess-, uh, you know there's a place here, uh,
it's, um, it's goo-, it's a barbecue place,

A.20:  Okay.  

B.21:  and it's, uh, you know, you go through a line and, and get your stuff.
But they make it fun,

A.22:  Um.  

B.23:  you know, they, they, they, the people behind the counter are, are
laughing and joking with you all the time,

A.24:  Yeah.  

B.25:  and I, you know that's one reason why I like to go back,

A.26:  Yeah.  

B.27:  you know the food is excellent obviously that, that is, like I said, that
is important,

A.28:  Yeah.  

B.29:  but um, you know, if, I don't know that I would go back as often if it
wasn't for the idea that I have fun there.

A.30:  Yeah, that's true.  There's some places though that I go to they don't
have the best
service or they're not the friendliest but, I'll, I'll tolerate it just
because I know that's the kind of food I want to eat.

B.31:  Uh-huh.  

A.32:  And there's other places but, like you said, the, the food doesn't matter,
it's, you have such a good time there.

B.33:  Have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or, or, uh, things like that?

A.34:  Yeah, I have not in, not in a good while, but ... 

B.35:  Well, see I'm, uh, I've been to dinner theaters but, the, every time I go
it's, you know, on the nonmeal show ty-, you know, type thing, so I've, it's,

A.36:  Just to see the show.  

B.37:  been awhile since I've been to one.  Uh?  

A.38:  Just to see the show, right.  

B.39:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, normally its comedy.  I, I enjoy comedy, 

A.40:  Uh-huh.  

B.41:  although there's one that I'm, I'm really looking forward to going to in
the next couple of weeks.  It's a, I just found out that, well I'm sure
they've, they've had them for a along time, but it's, uh, it's like a mystery,
uh, theater,

A.42:  Um.  

B.43:  uh, that you, you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're,
they're doing this act and they, they get, supposedly get the audience
involved in it and everything,

A.44:  Um.  

B.45:  and that, that sounds like that would be hilarious,

A.46:  Yeah,  

B.47:  you know ca- 

A.48:  that sounds pretty wild. 

B.49:  cause I love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and I love figuring 'em out before they do you know, 

A.50:  Yeah. 

B.51:  'course that's probably a lot easier on T V to figure it out than it is in other things, because T V they have a tendency to do a lot of things, uh, that aren't,  you know what I mean, um...       

A.52:  Predictable.  

B.53:  predictable, exactly, 

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  but, I mean, you know, the, the dinner, a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild, I don't know,

A.56:  Yeah, that does sound like a pretty neat idea.  

B.57:  Yeah.  So, um, I mean is there anything else about a restaurant that
would make you go back, though?

A.58:  Well, there's this, uh, there's this type, kind of restaurant called a brew
pub, are you familiar with those?

B.59:  No hadn't heard of them. 

A.60:  Where they, they brew their own beer there.  

B.61:  Oh, yeah?  

A.62:  Yeah and there's, I used to live in Colorado, 

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  and there was a lot of them there and there's actually, there's two in
the Raleigh area, [lipsmack] and, uh, I'm a, I'm a home brewer myself so I
just, am [breathing] envious of these people and you go there [/breathing] and
a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler,

B.65:  Uh-huh.  

A.66:  and, and while you're eating your meal, and usually their food is good too,
they they bring out six different kinds of beer that, they brewed on the
premises, and you just test, it's like uh, beer tasting,

B.67:  Um. 

A.68:  thing while you're eating your meal and it's really neat.

B.69:  Yeah, that sounds kind of neat.  Uh, is location at all important to you,
like,

A.70:  Um, 

B.71:  you know how far it is from your house or whatever?  

A.72:  yeah, I usually don't [laughter] go somewhere that's too far away,

B.73:  Well yeah, I,

A.74:  but, uh, 

B.75:  I guess that's.  Yeah, I, I think my favorite restaurant is always been
the one closest [laughter],

A.76:  Yeah.  

B.77:  you know the clos-, as long as it's, it meets the minimum criteria,

A.78:  Yeah, 

B.79:  you know, of good food. 

A.80:  well I guess for like lunch places that's really important because you
usually that much time or,

B.81:  No kidding [laughter],  

A.82:  or whatever.  

B.83:  working for T I that's pretty, 

A.84:  oh,  

B.85:  important [laughter]. 

A.86:  so that's why we're getting all these Dallas people, 

B.87:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.88:  that's what I figured, but ... 

B.89:  [Laughter] so yeah, that ... 

A.90:  I didn't, I don't want to assume that, that's what I figured.  No I'm a
col-, I'm a university student so, uh,

B.91:  Oh, okay.  

A.92:  that also has a, has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices
you have,

B.93:  Oh, yeah, 

A.94:  when you're flat broke all the time [laughter].  

B.95:  money does [laughter].  Yeah I can see that,  

A.96:  But, uh,  

B.97:  so,

A.98: I'm going to be starting working full time this summer, so,

B.99:  So you grad-,

A.100:  maybe,  

B.101:  are graduating? 

A.102:  maybe my restaurants will change.  

B.103:  Yeah, well, maybe I don't know, I'd, uh, I really haven't changed that much
since I was in sch-, in school, um,

A.104:  Yeah.  

B.105:  of course, you know, I'm not sure you ever get out of school to tell you
the truth and, uh, depending on what industry you get into or whatever, like,
uh, you know, T I being electronics,

A.106:  Um-hum.  

B.107:  Uh, you never get out of school, 

A.108:  No, 

B.109:  so,

A.110:  well actually I graduated with a B S in double E in in eighty-eight [sniffing] and I've been in school ever since then [laughter] I took one semester off and and I've been taking a cla- at least one class every semester. 

B.111:  Yeah.  Well, like I said though my, my ch-, my taste in, in food really
hadn't changed all that much in, in restaurants,

A.112:  Uh-huh.  

B.113:  I mean a little bit, yeah, 

A.114:  Yeah.  

B.115:  uh, especially in, you know I didn't have the money to go to these dinner
theaters and stuff before,

A.116:  Right. 

B.117:  whereas I, you know, I have gone to a couple of these things bef-, you
know lately,

A.118:  Uh-huh.  

B.119:  and, you know, it's like I said, I missed the din-, dinner part of it
but,

A.120:  Yeah.  

B.121:  I've gone to the theater.  Uh, but, I, you know, like I said that's,
that's probably, so price really, I guess, does have a lot to do with it, I
hadn't even really considered,

A.122:  Um.  

B.123:  that before.  

A.124:  I've become a lot more health conscious and that's why,  

B.125:  Um. 

A.126:  I stopped eating fast food,

B.127:  Yeah.  

A.128:  and places like that.  

B.129:  Yeah, well that's probably true to so ... 

A.130:  I used to love hamburger joints, 

B.131:  Uh-huh.  

A.132:  and I don't go to them, I don't eat hamburgers anymore but ...

B.133:  [Laughter] Well unfortunately I'm not as good about that as you are,

A.134:  [Laughter].

B.135:  I still go every once one in awhile.

A.136:  I used to just, I, I used be a connoisseur of hamburger places
[laughter].

B.137:  [Laughter].  

A.138:  Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger.  

B.139:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, it's like I said, you know, the different, there
are different reasons for different things,

A.140:  Yeah.  

B.141:  like that, and, you know, hey you're right health is one thing that just
...

A.142:  Now I go for the best place to get, uh, tofu or whatever [laughter].  Not
quite that bad, but, uh,

B.143:  I was wondering, yeah [laughter].  Well, all right, well, I think that
should just about do it.

A.144:  Yeah, good talking to you. 

B.145:  Yeah, take care,

A.146:  we'll see you later.  

B.147:  Uh-huh, bye. 

A.148:  Bye-bye.
