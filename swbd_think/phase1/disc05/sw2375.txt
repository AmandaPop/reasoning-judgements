==========================================================================

A.1:  Good morning.  Do you have a comp-, a personal computer? 

B.2:  Yes, I do.  I have, uh, uh, fifty megabyte hard disc (( )) I got a, you
know, lot of room for information.  [Noise] {like television}.  I'm a,
[throat_clearing] I'm a programmer at work.

A.3:  Oh. 

B.4:  So, uh, but I, I do all of my programming on the mainframe. 

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  And I, uh, don't have a lot of opportunity to work on the P C,
except at home. 

A.7:  Uh-huh. 

B.8:  So I find it very interesting, how about you? 

A.9:  Um, I have one, uh, a Wang or a, sorry, a Compaq portable that my
son picked up at one point. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  Uh, without documentation, so it was very cheap it's a two
eighty-six.

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  So it has no hard drive. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  Uh, so that's limiting.

B.16:  [Noise].

A.17:  I tend to use it to log into the, the mainframe at work.

B.18:  [Noise] Oh, that's great. 

A.19:  And then I have a Mac that I use for graphics, and,

B.20:  Do you like the Mac real well? 

A.21:  Um, I don't, there's something about the Mac, a lot of things
about the Mac, I don't like.  I don't like the size of the screen.
I have an old, uh,  

B.22:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.23:  #Plus.#  I don't like the keyboard, but it's extremely easy to
use. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  And it's very good for, for graphics and actually, I, I,

B.26:  [Noise].

A.27:  mean, it's to the point where programs are, e-, readily available and
inexpensive, so I did my income tax on it.

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  I have uh, uh, it's not really a budget package,

B.30:  [Noise] {dog}.

A.31:  but a, a financial tracking package, you know, for my checkbook and stuff
like that.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  I've, I've heard a lot of wonderful things about
the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  Uh-huh {Very faintly}.

A.35:  And I mean you can, you can buy an extra screen [laughter].

B.36:  [Laughter] That's true.  That's very true. 

A.37:  Bu-, but, uh, it's somehow because the screen comes with it, it, it
always looks awkward to have the two screens. 

B.38:  Uh-huh. 

A.39:  And I found, uh, my son is, um, uh, second year college
student.  And he in high school had no interest in the computer
at all and so he, when teachers said, you know, you have to
type your papers, at least with a Mac,

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  he was willing to sit down and,

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  [Laughter] type his paper.  

B.44:  Uh-huh. 

A.45:  And, um, [lipsmack] now he does play with, with the, you know, I B M clone.

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  But, um, and has learned quite a bit about it.  And tends to use it instead
of, instead of, instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff
he, he seems to have switched.

B.48:  Is he interested in computers then?  Did this give him an interest in it,
other than, you know using it more as or less like a wor-, a word processing
#machine?#

A.49:  #No.#  I mean he sees it as a tool, much #as I do.# 

B.50:  #As a tool.#  Uh-huh, okay. 

A.51:  And, uh, he no, he's in International Studies. 

B.52:  Oh, that sounds interesting, too. 

A.53:  So he's basically, you know, whatever the computer can do for you, fine,

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  I'll learn enough to, to make it work well for me, but I'm not going to be
a guru [laughter].

B.56:  Uh-huh.  I understand that.  You have to have a certain, I mean
either you like them or you don't, I think. 

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  A lot of the people are afraid of them, uh, they're
intimidated by them. 

A.59:  #Right.# 

B.60:  #I guess# more than anything.  Until they get to learn what they
can do and, and how it can work.  

A.61:  But I think that,

B.62:  So, 

A.63:  is, it is very frustrating because, you know, you're sure you did x,

B.64:  Uh-huh. 

A.65:  and it just doesn't work and so you tell somebody who knows
about computers and they say, no, you obviously didn't do that
because,

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  the computer doesn't, doesn't balk [laughter].

B.68:  That's right.   And e-, even using it as much as I do, you know,
you'd, you'd, oh, w-, I did that I know I did that. 

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  You know and then the results come back and no you didn't [laughter]. 

A.71:  [Laughter]. 

B.72:  They catch you every time [laughter]. 

A.73:  [Laughter]. 

B.74:  So any way, I guess you have to have a sense of humor too
[throat_clearing],

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  when you're working with them. 

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  So, 

A.79:  And talk to them.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  [Laughter] Yell at them [laughter].

B.82:  Yell at them and like to choke them so many times.  I want to
choke mine.  Say you're not doing what I want you to do. 

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  But, uh, I, I have one, mainly I bought it because I'm in, uh,
taking a lot of courses along with work.  And it's very useful in
that respect.  But I hope to do something more with it. 

A.85:  Basically you're using it as a word processor (( )).

B.86:  Right.  Exactly.  And it seems a shame to have all that
equipment but, uh, not do anything with it but, uh, one day I hope to
do more. 

A.87:  And what would you do? 

B.88:  I don't know. 

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter] I know there must be something more I can do with
it [laughter]. 

A.91:  [Laughter]. 

B.92:  But, uh, in my spare time some day, I, I hope to do something more with it.
I have a lot of [sniffing] ideas but putting them into work is another story.

A.93:  Right.  Right. 

B.94:  So, [sniffing] anyway. 

A.95:  Well it's been very interesting. 

B.96:  Well thank you very much for calling. 

A.97:  Okay. 

B.98:  Okay have a good day. 

A.99:  You too. 

B.100:  #Bye-bye.  [/Noise] {like television}.#

A.101:  #Bye-bye.#
