==========================================================================

B.1:  Well, in the norman-, in a normal route of way we do things, how about
the ladies go first?

A.2:  All righty [laughter].  Um, well, I, uh, have a four year old who will
just be entering public school next year, so I'm really just starting to get
involved in, uh, in what's out there and how they do things.  Um, as far as
the system as a whole, I really don't see a problem with it.  I do see a
problem with graduating people that, that can't read and are not, you know,
productive in society or productive to themselves and, uh, I think that's the
main problem at this point.  How about yourself?

B.3:  All right.  I'm, live in Plano, Texas and, uh,

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  uh, today we're not even suppose to be in school because the, uh, the way
the taxation and all that crap is, there really legally isn't any funding for
the school systems in Texas today.

A.6:  Right. 

B.7:  So, uh, I mean, when you, when you take, uh, uh, professionals and put them
in situations, they have to make decisions based on money to fund public
education, and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to, to
get that major subject in line, something's wrong.  So, I think here in Texas
mainly that the, the, they're not serious, they're more serious about what the
salary should be for senators than they are for what, how the level of
education should be for children.  I have a one year old so I'm not, I'm more
opinionated about the observations than, than the true facts, but,

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  it's just a shame to me that, that the, our firemen, our policemen, and
school teachers are the three least paid utilities, um, that have the biggest
impact to our well-being.

A.10:  That's true. 

B.11:  I have, I have a real issue with that.  Um, I think that if from every year
when they, when they pull in the, the, the, uh, test that the last three
years, you know, ten, eleven, twelve year, uh, graders take, and, and then you
see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states.
They're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in
Texas, I have a real concern about that, um, as a matter of fact I'm very
content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia,

A.12:  Uh-huh.  

B.13:  uh, verses having her go down here and not learn anything, and then, uh,
so I'm, (( )) my opinion I think there's a big concern hope, hopefully the
new, uh, education, secretary of education will do something to fix the
problem but, uh, I don't know, they've got to quit worrying about, uh, the,
uh, religious, uh, overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the
product.

A.14:  Yeah, I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people,
you know, special interest groups can blow up,

B.15:  Uh-huh.  

A.16:  and, uh, and not really get down to teaching what's important.  Teaching
these kids, you know, how (( )) really the basics is what it comes down to.

B.17:  Exactly.  I was astonished to find out that, that across the United States
in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed.

A.18:  Is that right?

B.19:  Ha-, they don't even, a lot of the school systems don't even, uh, the kids
nowadays don't even know what, what the president's fitness education program
is all about,

A.20:  Huh.  

B.21:  they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do
when we were going to school.

A.22:  I remember. 

B.23:  And, yeah, and, uh, I talked to a thirteen year old last night who's, uh,
goes to, uh, one of the Plano high schools or junior highs, I guess, and she
said that she had a choice, she could either have taken tennis, or weight
lifting so she choice to take weight lifting,

A.24:  [Laughter].  

B.25:  over the regular gym, I mean, give me a break, I mean, the kids sit there
and they, and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for, for lunch and,

A.26:  And talk, yeah. 

B.27:  then go out there and lift weights and don't learn anything, it's just a
real, I have a real problem with the whole system.

A.28:  Huh. 

B.29:  They need to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let
them be able to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline.

A.30:  Yeah, then it comes down to what you said before though about them being
some of the lowest paid public, you know, public service,

B.31:  Uh-huh.  

A.32:  employees that there are,

B.33:  I used to,

A.34:  and yet they're so important. 

B.35:  I used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level.

A.36:  Uh-huh. 

B.37:  I mean, I was absolutely flabbergasted at what, they wo-, what she was
paid.  True, she was young, you know, but still it's the principle.

A.38:  Right. 

B.39:  Of course, if she got her Masters degree it would all be different.  But,
uh,

A.40:  Well, you know, it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and,

B.41:  Oh, taxes Lord forbi-, 

A.42:  that's a bad word [laughter]. 

B.43:  Lord forbid, taxes.  Goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our
expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads,
((we'd)) cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem
[laughter].

A.44:  [Laughter] There's an idea. 

B.45:  Maybe I should run for office, huh?  [laughter]. 

A.46:  Run on that then, no income taxes in Texas, huh?  

B.47:  That's true.

A.48:  I'm in Texas too, so,

B.49:  That's funny, that's funny.  Well, that's about all I have here.

A.50:  Well me, too, I, uh, I think we both agree there's some problems there
but,

B.51:  Yes, ma'am. 

A.52:  we'll, maybe do our small part to fix them up. 

B.53:  Surely.  I've enjoyed it. 

@@A.54:  All right, you too. 

B.55:  #Bye, bye.# 

A.56:  #Bye.#
