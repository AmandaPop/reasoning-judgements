REMARKS:       It was a little more difficult because both speakers
were very disjointed.  Some static on B, but I think it was his call 
waiting on his telephone line.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Here we go Jay.  

B.2:  All right.  

@A.3:  Uh, can you give me your ideas on, uh, what you think about the budget.

B.4:  Well, on the budget I'm not for sure I wouldn't, um, start off first of
all by putting a limit on the members of congress, and then maybe we could get
some new people in there to work on it.  But other than the budget, I think
they just have to, uh, I don't know, I think they have to just have, uh,
maybe, uh, uh, almost a, like a constitutional convention and get sharp people
from all over the country to come together and try to decide what we're going
to cut.  I think we cut the wrong areas and, and just maybe start all over
again.  Almost like family, sometimes I have to do this, call time out and
then,

A.5:  Yeah.  I guess some of the states have, had st-, started out like, uh,
California.  I th-, I think they had --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- is it proposition ((two and a half)) they had out there? 

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  And Massachusetts had the same type of, of, uh, legislation.  You know they
only can raise taxes so much there, there's a cap on it.

B.10:  Right.  

A.11:  Uh, 

B.12:  See down here in Texas they just, they don't s-, they, we don't have a
state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the
fees.  They just call them fees, and there's a fee for everything.

A.13:  You don't have a state income tax?   

B.14:  We don't have a state income tax, and, uh,

A.15:  Is that right?  

B.16:  there's no, uh, the sales tax isn't on food or anything like that.  So
we,

A.17:  Yeah, our sales tax isn't either.  Uh,

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  it's a, 

B.20:  So we're not taxed very much, uh, but the fees are pretty ridiculous.  But
I think we just may need to have, uh, you know, get sharp people from all over
the country into some sort of a, like a constitutional convention and then to
say what's working in one place, why wouldn't it work someplace else.  I
noticed Bridgeport, Connecticut's declared bankruptcy.

A.21:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  Isn't that something?   

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Uh, yeah, 

B.26:  So,

A.27:  it was just in the paper the last day or two.  

B.28:  Yeah.  And it happened, I think Michigan way back in the late sixties when
((Soapie Williams)) was governor, they declared bankruptcy.  The whole state
of Michigan.  So it's,

A.29:  Yeah, it's just, they're just running, um, I don't know about, about Texas
but I know up around here as soon as, uh, like Massachusetts, well, Rhode
Island too, it doesn't make any difference which state.  When things get tight
they always threaten they're going to cut, uh, police, fire,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  uh, they're going to layoff teachers.  

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  But they, it's the rank and file.  They never talk about cutting at the
top.  You know,

B.34:  Oh, absol-, 

A.35:  the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant.

B.36:  That's ab-, absolutely.

A.37:  And I think the federal government is the same way that it's, it's just
gotten so huge that I don't think anyone has got a handle on it anymore.

B.38:  No.  By leaving,

A.39:  There's no,

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  huh?  

B.42:  Yeah, by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions, it's
not going to change.  So somebody has to get it to where that it's just a rank
and file citizens around the country and, and the, [noise] and like a --

A.43:  That's right.  That's true.  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- like a huge convention.  You know, if they'd send, uh, so many people
from each [/noise] uh, uh, they could do them, they could do them in the state
by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at,
uh, uh, political conventions.

A.45:  Um, yeah.  

B.46:  But you'd, what, what it would end up, it would be the same old people
going so,

A.47:  That's, probably there should be, uh, uh, a mandatory limit on, on how long
you can serve like maybe only two terms.

B.48:  Yeah.  That's, 

A.49:  And that's if, w-, you know,

B.50:  I've always thought that.  

A.51:  because some of these old boys have been in there for,

B.52:  Get in,

A.53:  a thousand years. 

B.54:  get in there forever and then that seniority system and then the [noise] --

A.55:  Yep.

B.56:  -- some creep in there and, uh,

A.57:  Yep.  

B.58:  So, uh,

A.59:  Yeah, it's probably going to have to start there.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  And get some new blood in there and then, um, maybe they can look at it and
they can, you know, each one of them that's in there now have got their own
favorite projects and all, you know, they're, they're cronies and, um, but I
don't think you can do anything.  I don't think they're, I think the budget's
out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and I'm
talking about right through from top to bottom.

B.62:  Right I think, uh, well, even at the beginning of the country Alexander
Hamilton wanted to put a limit on, uh, the President was only supposed to
serve seven years and they didn't, uh, they didn't follow through on that.
But I've, I've thought about a twelve year cap for [static] congressmen and
senators and maybe go back to a seven year term for the President.  Sort of,
you know [static],

A.63:  It, so it would run, 

B.64:  Could you hold one second?  Just a second, Ray.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  Hello. 

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  That's all right, my wife's a psychologist and I thought that might be
somebody calling in for her.

A.69:  Oh, I see.  

B.70:  How are things in Massachusetts after Dukakis then?  

A.71:  Um, Massachusetts is in, is in terrible, terrible shape.  

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  They're, uh, uh, they're still talking about, uh, uh, laying off a lot of
people, you know, cut, cutting a lot of services.

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  Um, the state is not funding any of the, any of the cities and towns.

B.76:  {Very faint} Yeah.

A.77:  So, the cities and towns now are, are forced to go out and, uh, raise
capital.  Uh, it's, it's, uh,

B.78:  Yeah, this is,

A.79:  it's just a bad situation.  And, 

B.80:  Texas is trying,

A.81:  it's not only there but Rhode Island is the same, it's just, isn't there,
you know, it's in the same boat.

B.82:  Oh, that's crazy because Texas, uh, it looks like it's trying to bounce
back a little bit, but it's, we've still got a ways to go.  It's, uh, I teach
in a college and I, and I'm in a, I'm in pretty good shape but some of these,
uh, there's just a lot of people out of work and a lot of homeless.  And the
budget is just I don't, we've got a new governor do-, democratic governor,
female and, uh, she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and
that's the problem is that you, if you come in too fast, you can't get
reelected.

A.83:  Yeah.  You know, um, there's an awful lot of people, uh, in this country
that are idle.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  Uh, when you say like the homeless, 

B.86:  Yes.  

A.87:  and there's the prison population is skyrocketing -- 

B.88:  Absolutely.  

A.89:  -- uh, I think they should probably go back and borrow some of, uh,
Roosevelt's ideas, you know, uh, set up some of these C C C camps like they
had way back.

B.90:  Yes.  Yes.  

A.91:  Um, that, 

B.92:  But you know, give people a little, uh, dignity because I know a lot of
these people would like to work, they just don't know how, uh, to go out and
get, find a job or they're not skilled or, or something.  And it,
[throat_clearing] it doesn't take a lot of skill to rake leaves or do some of
those things like those [throat_clearing],

A.93:  That's right they could, they could, uh, they could build roads, uh,

B.94:  Right.  

A.95:  bridges, uh, 

B.96:  Right.    

A.97:  uh, canals.  Uh, there's, there's a ton of things they can do.  We can
take in, uh, they could stop, start, uh, a rapid transit movement,

B.98:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].

A.99:  like when they, when they first broke into, uh, uh, the interstate
highways.

B.100:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.101:  Uh, we don't have a rapid transit system in this country though,

B.102:  No, we don't.  We don't.  

A.103:  worth a, worth a damn. 

B.104:  [Throat_clearing] The, uh, we, uh, you mentioned the pri-, prison
population.  Another thing you can do in the budget, we've got a lot of people
who don't need to be in prison.  I mean there's,

A.105:  That's true.  Right.

B.106:  some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you don't need to put them
away.  Put them in some work program.

A.107:  Yep.

B.108:  You know a minimum very minimum security and this, they've got a job and
you, you work, uh, you know, work this long.  Some of them may find that they,
they like it and want to take it permanently.  Then you could just switch them
over in another branch of that and pay them, uh, a decent wage.  You, you'd,
whatever you'd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or
having them out on the street.

A.109:  That's right because I don't know what, what it costs per year per inmate
but,

B.110:  It's a, it's a lot.  

A.111:  if they just, 

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful,
