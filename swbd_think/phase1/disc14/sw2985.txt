===========================================================================

@A.1:  [Music] {radio} [hiss] Okay, can you, uh, give me your thoughts on what
women's roles are, or how they've changed?

B.2:  [Hiss] Well, um, I'm in my, I, I, I've seen the changes, I think, in my
generation most of all, because I'm a early baby boomer, and, uh, I was
brought up, uh, to sort of get married and raise children, and, uh, be very
domestic, and uh, when I went to college, or went to high school, I did very
well, I was urged to become a secretary or a teacher because those are typical
roles.  And, uh, things have changed, and, uh, m-, I, I've ventured off in all
sorts of areas, and so have most of the other women in my generation.  And
we're all in business, or the professions, and, uh, and, uh, heavens, we're
s-, we're, uh, astronauts and things like that.  Who knew-, who would,
wouldn't have been imagined in nineteen sixty-eight or something.  How about
you?

A.3:  [Lipsmack] Yeah.  Well, I was kind of, same thing, it's, you know, I was, I
was brought up in a small town and, and women tended to just get married and
take care of the house.  Um, but as, as times changed, um, the price of
things, I guess, started rising, and it took more than one income,

B.4:  Yes.

A.5:  so, m-, um, more and more of [lipsmack], of young women were staying in
school.  They were getting a better education, and they were going out into
the work force.

B.6:  Yes.  A-, another thing that happened that I found is that, you know, when
I got married I didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced.  Or, or when I
was younger, I didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  In this day and age, people are as likely to get divorced as to stay
married, and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living.
And, uh, so there's an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down
a good job.

A.9:  Yeah, I think perhaps, uh, um, years ago, it was a stigma on a family to
have a divorce in it.

B.10:  Yes.

A.11:  And, whether it was warranted or not, people just stayed together because
of what the family thought [talking].  Uh, people are a little bit smarter
today than that.  They, uh, uh, yes [/talking] there's a family unit, it's,
and it's very difficult if there, uh, are children, especially young children.
But in a lot of cases, it's probably, it would probably more difficult if they
stayed together.  But, uh, I think women are taking a, uh, a more active role
in politics.  I, I think that, uh, [lipsmack] within the next ten or fifteen
years, you'll probably see a woman vice-president or a woman president, and
you'll also see a lot more, uh, congressmen and senators, uh, women [children].

B.12:  I, I agree with that, and I also think that they're taking a lead in, in
the arts and in business too, and, uh, a-, as the years go by, they run
surveys to see how many women are C E O -s or on the boards of major
companies, and the number is creeping up very slowly, but it's definitely
increasing, so that probably ten years from now,

A.13:  [Static] Is that right?  You think they, you think that's the case?

B.14:  Yes, it is.  I mean, t-, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago there were no
women on the boards, or, or, or C E O -s of major corporations, unless they
inherited the firm from their father.  You know, that sort of thing.  #But# --

A.15:  #Oh,# yeah, if it was, if it was a family owned business, you mean?
[static].

B.16:  -- Right, if it was a family owned business.  But now, they're, they're in
the board room and they're trying to get ahead and make it in the business
world, and of course, to some extent the laws are helping them.  But, uh, uh,
you know, there's no, no, no holding back their ambition.  On the other hand,
what it does to the fabric of society and the family, remains to be seen.

A.17:  [/Children] Yeah.  I st-, I still think it's, it's a, it's a two tiered
system.  I, uh, I know of, of, uh, women engineers and, and, uh, [lipsmack]
supervisors that are, uh, they have to work twice as hard, it seems like, to
achieve the same levels that a male does.  Uh, I don't know if that's just my
imagination or not but it seems to be.  It's, uh, the ones that are up
there, uh, seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts
[laughter].

B.18:  I, I, I [laughter].

A.19:  If there was, if it was up to me, I think I would have, uh, more females,
because it seems like they try harder.

B.20:  Well, I think that in a way they're, they're being tested right now.  We're
going through a testing period where capability is, is everything and if they
succeed, then the, the, the generation of girls that are growing up now will
have it much easier.  Because there will be a precedent, they'll have had role
models, whereas, #you know, the generation that grew up in the sixties and
seventies,#

A.21:  #Right.  They'll have role models, they'll have protectors.#

B.22:  Sorry?

A.23:  [Lipsmack] They'll have protectors.  

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  Uh, there'll be more and more women that are up higher and higher.

B.26:  Yes.

A.27:  Um, [lipsmack] and also they say that the bulk of the wealth is controlled
by women now, uh, just through, I guess, uh, uh, the men dying off and just
leaving their, uh, fortunes to women.  So, that's going to have a big impact,
uh.  If you've got money and brains, you can s-, you can wield a lot of power.

B.28:  Um.  I guess just by virtue of living longer in a way you're right, because
they do, it d-, does come to them, but they've got to be young enough to enjoy
it.  I mean, if they're just old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to
come, it doesn't do them much good [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah. It must be, the culture's different, uh, down
there, than up here also.  Um, they're kind of, uh, the old Yankees,

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  you know, it, it takes, uh, uh, it takes a stick of dynamite to get them
moving off center in a lot of cases, where, [noise] uh, uh, the Midwest, I
think, is a little bit more aggressive because they're closer to the west
coast, where they're, uh, highly aggressive.  You know, uh, ideas, and, or it
seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east.  I
don't know if you've found that to be true [talking].

B.32:  Well, I'm in the middle of the country, and, and it seems to me it c-, they
start their, from, start from both coasts and work their ways inward.  Uh, one
of the, one of the things that, that I'm finding is that, um, I've lived in
Texas, I've lived in New York and, uh, I have, I've done a lot of visiting out
in California, and I know that we're lagging behind here, and yet I really do
see, uh, women's roles have increased, and they're gaining new respect.  In
fact, I believe that the mayor of the top five major Texas cities are all
women.

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  And that goes back to your original point about politics.

A.35:  Yeah.  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  #So, uh,# uh, you know, it's going to get to a point, I, some men are going
to wonder if they're falling behind [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah [laughter].  The, uh, I think the only problem there is the men that,
themselves that feel threatened by, by a woman [/talking].

B.38:  Yes.

A.39:  Uh, by her intelligence, probably, uh, those are the ones that you're going
to have problems with, I think, uh, a lot of the, at least my kids, they seem
to have a, a more open mind today than, uh, like when I was growing up.

B.40:  I think the young people today do have an open mind, it's just not as much,
uh, type casting by s-, by gender.  Uh, you know, uh, a little girl can say I
want to be an astronaut or I want to be a fireman,

A.41:  Right [/music] [/hiss].

B.42:  or a policeman, or, or a Rhodes scholar, which was impossible when I was
going to college (( )) [/hiss].
