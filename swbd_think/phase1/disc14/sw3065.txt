==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you, uh, think we should go metric?

B.2:  Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.  It's kind of a tricky question, because I
think it's, it's a practical system,

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens and things make
sense.  Um, it's, it's a switch.  The problem would just be the switch over.

A.5:  Yeah.  I think that the, I think what, I mean, I don't know what happened
last time.  I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or
something and,

B.6:  Right.  That's when I was in the elementary school years and we all,

A.7:  Yeah, me too.

B.8:  We all learned that metric and they were ready, we were going to be metric
and,

A.9:  Right, and, and I don't quite know why it failed.  Um, I would bet the
push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to
use it, so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have
both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out
so,

B.12:  So I think that's what they did at first,

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  was that they had metric and, and I mean, and there's things that we've
gone metric.  We have metric cola now,

A.15:  Right, I was just thinking,

B.16:  you can buy that and you can,

A.17:  two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.  You don't buy
quarts and gallons anymore of soda.

B.18:  So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric, but no
one talks about, you know, uh, you buy nine by twelve frames, you don't buy
[laughter] centimeter length frames,

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  and cooking pans.

A.21:  And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers, you don't say,
I went,

B.22:  ((Uh-huh)).

A.23:  a hundred kilometers.

B.24:  [Laughter]  Right, 

A.25:  You know.

B.26:  fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.

A.27:  Yeah.  I would, I would be total loss.

B.28:  Yeah.  That's,

A.29:  I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government
incentive program or something --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- people would begin to switch over, you know, and I think there would be
the hard core older people who would get really pissed and, pardon my
expression there, but, uh,

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all
cranky and stuff.  But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier 
for --

B.34:  Yeah, it really would.

A.35:  -- ((people)) coming up.

B.36:  It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they
started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, [breathing] you know,
get that in our minds, so that we could ch-, I mean because I think our
generation could make a change.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  It would be difficult, but it would not be as difficult for people, say,
fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system
other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  That's [breathing],

A.41:  Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be,
this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was (( )) in
elementary school.

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  And if they kept it up, so let's say, imagine they had kept going, you'd
have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar
with the metric system.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  Not like could use it comfortably right now, but I could convert, you know,
I could carry around a little conversion card or something and,

B.46:  Right [laughter].

A.47:  I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn, and
I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using
it.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  And now I think there are enough people, you know, sort of as we get older,
I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll
be able to make the switch, and we're not going to start going crazy and
yelling and saying,

B.50:  [Breathing].

A.51:  what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.  We'll say oh, it's a pain
in the neck, but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.

B.52:  That's true.  That makes sense.

A.53:  I don't know.  I, I, I would hope it would, uh, it seems like it's a
reasonable system.  I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.

B.54:  Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,
and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.

A.55:  Right [breathing].

B.56:  When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be [breathing] a
hundred and seventy centimeters,

A.57:  Centimeters.

B.58:  and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- in pounds.

A.61:  But I wonder if, if,

B.62:  So all the dieters would be happy [laughter].

A.63:  ((But yeah)) right [laughter].

B.64:  I only weigh sixteen today.  That's,

A.65:  Yeah.  But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they
have to change immediately.  They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,
so start, you know, from now, like from now on all licenses would have that,

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses
as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something.

B.68:  And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven
eleven that,

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  [Breathing] tells you how tall the robbers are when they,

A.71:  That's right.

B.72:  to hold it up.  

A.73:  [Laughter] I know the, and, oh, yeah, I know, though, at the, uh, at the
amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two,

B.74:  [Breathing].

A.75:  inches or something.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  You can't walk in here.

B.78:  [Laughter].

A.79:  You have to be under.  Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that
case, they, uh, see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're
not taller than this line.

B.80:  Right.  (( )) this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.

A.81:  That's right.  

B.82:  [Laughter] Just so you'll know, but that would be good.  That, I don't
know.

A.83:  It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think,
you know.

B.84:  Right.  Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?  I know
England is not metric.

A.85:  But I don't know. 

B.86:  I,

A.87:  Eng-, Eng-, England is not?

B.88:  I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in
England,

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  all that began back there, and I think they're the only part of the
continent that hasn't changed over to metric.

A.91:  Yeah, but I mean, but, but virtually the rest of the world is.  I mean, it
seems like --

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  -- like, like, like sort of stupid.  I mean, we are, of course, we are
Americans and we're supposed to be, you know,

B.94:  We're the trend setters in the world.  I don't know why we,

A.95:  That's right, and, and now we're backwards.

B.96:  We haven't changed to the sensible system.

A.97:  [Cough].

B.98:  {Faint} I don't know.

A.99:  No, I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a
base twelve system --

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  -- makes a lot more sense.

B.102:  Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything, is it?  It, 

A.103:  No, actually, no.  Um, let's see, it's,

B.104:  Well, pounds, I don't even know what that,

A.105:  [Cough] I don't know.  Oh, yeah, I, I always forget.  I don't even know
how many ounces are in a pound.  I just sort of make it up.

B.106:  See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.  It's, I mean,
I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current
[laughter] measuring system that would [laughter],

A.107:  Right [laughter].  

B.108:  prevent me from,

A.109:  Those, those (( )) wouldn't be a problem.

B.110:  It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.  A lot of stuff,

A.111:  Let's see, how many cups equal that?

B.112:  [Laughter].

A.113:  I, I have no idea.  I just, uh, I know things like, you know, a pint is a
pound the world around or something.

B.114:  Right [laughter].  I don't,

A.115:  That's all I know.

B.116:  I didn't even know that [laughter].

A.117:  I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine, I, I had two friends, and,
I had more friends than that, but two friends of mine in college,

B.118:  [Laughter].

A.119:  I had a lot more than two, I promise.

B.120:  Well, that's good.

A.121:  Um, we opened a jelly bean business.

B.122:  Oh.

A.123:  And we sold jelly beans, and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know, we, we
didn't bo-, we didn't bother buying a scale.

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different
flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x
amount per pound or quarter pound or something.

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  And we, we didn't bother buying a scale, and one of my friends was a
physics, one of these guys was a physics major and he said, well, just
remember a pint is a pound the world around, and ((he got)) the measuring cup
and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.

B.128:  Did you ever check it to see if it really was,

A.129:  Gee, I think, wh-,

B.130:  a pint?

A.131:  I think he (( )) the calculation at home, and it turns out that he was
actually pretty close.

B.132:  Um.

A.133:  If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.

B.134:  Right.

A.135:  So, so we were giving them a little too much, but that was our general
tendency anyway.

B.136:  Well, that's, you all are (( )) nice business [laughter].

A.137:  Yeah, well, we were, you know, we were in, it was, it was almost like we
did it for the hell of it in school, we really didn't,

B.138:  Right.

A.139:  make, you know, I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each
profit at the end of the year.

B.140:  Right [laughter].

A.141:  You know, after, after an entire semester, but we had a hell of a lot of
fun doing it.

B.142:  Probably ate all your merchandise too.

A.143:  Yeah, we, we, we tended to eat a lot, and our friends would just sort of
walk by and just put their hands in it, and we had another friend, um, the
physics major again, he wasn't --

B.144:  Uh-huh.

A.145:  -- he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess, and he got into a
snowball fight,

B.146:  [Laughter].

A.147:  with the jelly beans nearby, and he just, and, and some snow fell into
one of the cartons.

B.148:  Oh.

A.149:  So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off [breathing].

B.150:  [Laughter].

A.151:  And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.

B.152:  Yeah, it's a little problem.  What's inside the jelly bean?

A.153:  Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same, they're like an outer coating,
and there's just sort of th-, this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like
glorified sugar.  I don't know.

B.154:  Uh, oh.

A.155:  But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,
