===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Where have you been on vacation lately?

B.2:  Um, well the last vacation I went was to Cozumel,

A.3:  Oh yeah.

B.4:  and that was last, uh, March and April.

A.5:  Have you got another one planned?

B.6:  Not at this point.

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  Although if we take another vacation I think we might like to go to Cancun
this time.  Have you been there?

A.9:  Yeah, yeah we went there, well actually I went there before I got married.
I haven't been back with Kyle yet but [laughter] he is very much wanting to go
there and since I have some free tickets with some frequent flyer stuff,
that's where he wants to go.  But, um, also since my paren-, my in-laws just
moved to Utah, we're kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and
I've never been snow skiing so I'm not really into that.  I would rather do
the beach scene.

B.10:  I agree.  I mean if I'm going to go on vacation, I want to lay out in the
sun and relax,

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  drink top-, tropical drinks,

A.13:  Definitely do that [laughter].

B.14:  and someplace I'd like to go is like to the other side of the Caribbean,

A.15:  Oh really?

B.16:  as, you know, as opposed to the Mexican side. I want drink, rum drinks
and, uh, lay on those beaches over there.

A.17:  Like in the, in the Virgin Islands?

B.18:  That sounds good.  Another place that I heard is really pretty is, uh, the
Cayman Islands.

A.19:  Oh yeah.

B.20:  Although I hear they're expensive.

A.21:  Yeah, that's definitely true.  Well I got a magazine the other day called
CARIBBEAN LIFE and it had, um, different charter boats in there where like  
three couples, could, could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but,
uh, you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer 
rates so like if you do it before September or October or something like that
you really save a ton of money and I would love to do that.

B.22:  Well our tenth anniversary is coming up #in October,#

A.23:  #Oh really,#

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  #I# didn't know that.

B.26:  Yeah.  And, uh, [sigh] I'd like to, yo-, even if we just get away for three
or four days, I think it would be kind of neat.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Just to do something.  Originally, a couple years ago, we were hoping
to do a trip to Greece,

A.29:  Um.

B.30:  but, uh, I don't think that's going to be possible now.

A.31:  Um, that would be fun.

B.32:  Now that is probably the number one place on earth that I would like to go.

A.33:  Really?

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Wow.  Well all the pictures I've ever seen of it has just been gorgeous
but I don't know.  I think, I think I'd, there's other places that I would
rather go first I think maybe.

B.36:  Like where?

A.37:  Um, Australia and down in there.  I mean the, the pictures I've seen of
that, even, um, oh I had a, [laughter] when I was in school, I had a nun that
was from, um, oh I can't even think of the island now but she told us just
wonderful stories of the island and, and the pictures she showed us and all
that.  I can't think of the place now.  It's a pretty big one, oh, Venezuela
[laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] I don't think that's an island but that's okay.

A.39:  Well, uh, I, wherever she, wherever she was, she was out, you know, on the
edge.  But anyway she, uh, had some great pictures and I always thought that
would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too.

B.40:  Well the main place that Nick would like to go is, uh, Rio.

A.41:  Oh, really?

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  He's been talking about that for years.

A.45:  Hey, that would be fun.  Yeah, when I was little I always heard how
romantic Rio was, but I would like to go to Tahiti too.  That would be fun.
But even just like in the States it was fun when we went to Mackinac Island,
that was pretty cool.

B.46:  That's, uh, up in Michigan?

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Yeah, we talked about doing one of those drive around trips.  You know,
you drive around, I guess Lake Michigan, and then you take the ferry over to
the other side and,

A.49:  Oh really?

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  Huh.

B.52:  But I'd only want to do that in the summer.

A.53:  Yeah.  Because it, I was there at the end of July and it was still pretty
cool.  So, yeah, I'm not, not a cold weather person at all.

B.54:  No, neither am I.

A.55:  [Laughter] Well um, um, um, I think that, uh, once we get the house
refinanced we're going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go
to Cancun or do the little, uh, trip to Ca-, Southern California and then on
up to Utah.  So, I don't know, we'll see.

B.56:  Well Nick just got back from San Diego last night,

A.57:  Oh really?

B.58:  and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and I haven't been there since, I
guess it was seventy-three and, uh, I would love to go back. That was just one
of the prettiest places on earth I have ever seen.

A.59:  Yeah.  I think I'm going to, uh, work in a business trip and go to San
Diego. 

B.60:  How do you work in a business trip? [laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter] You'll have to ask Bill how my business trips work [laughter].

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  They work very well [laughter].

B.64:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.65:  And I have definitely needed a business trip lately [laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] Well since you already set up the office out in Southern
California, there's nothing left for me.

A.67:  Well that's true.  Hadn't thought about that.

B.68:  And it doesn't appear we're going to be opening any new offices.

A.69:  Well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you
could have to go train.  

B.70:  That would be all right.

A.71:  Yeah.  Tell them to do that.  

B.72:  I guess we're straying from the, uh,

A.73:  Yes [laughter].

B.74:  the vacation part of it [laughter].

A.75:  Tha-, I mean a trip is a trip [laughter] so,

B.76:  [Laughter] That's right.  I'll go anywhere.

A.77:  Oh, I would too.  In a drop of a hat.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  Fortunately we aren't tied down with, uh, any other little two legged
responsibilities, we could go.

B.80:  You can do that [laughter]. Yeah.

A.81:  Yeah.  Makes, makes a big difference.

B.82:  As a matter of fact, I was offered a free ticket, air ticket, today if I
want one.

A.83:  Well take it.

B.84:  Well [sigh] eventually I might but Archie offered me a ticket.

A.85:  Oh really?

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  Well good.

B.88:  And, uh, I thought we'd, you know, I wouldn't want to just take it but he
has American and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- and I, Nick's going to New Orleans in January, #I think, next year.#

A.91:  #Ooh, I love New Orleans.#

B.92:  I haven't been there for so long.

A.93:  Oh yeah.  Such good food.  

B.94:  And drinks.

A.95:  Oh yeah! [laughter].

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  Well and even just to go sit in the bars and listen to the jazz, that's #so
much fun.#

B.98:  #Yeah or watch# the people.

A.99:  Oh yeah.

B.100:  Or the hookers go up and #down the street [laughter].#

A.101:  #Oh God!#  Yeah, that's the first time I ever saw an actual transvestite I
think, was in New Orleans.

B.102:  [Laughter] Oh I saw one in, uh, San Diego.

A.103:  Really?

B.104:  I went to a shor-, a show.  You know, one of those transvestite shows.

A.105:  Oh yeah, yeah.

B.106:  That was something.

A.107:  [Laughter] Well, I guess I'll go take my shower.  I've been working out so
I'll do that.

B.108:  Okay.

A.109:  Well I'll talk to you later [laughter].

B.110:  Okay.  Now do you push the buttons now?

A.111:  No we just hang up [laughter].

B.112:  [Laughter] Okay talk to you later.

A.113:  Bye.

B.114:  Bye.
