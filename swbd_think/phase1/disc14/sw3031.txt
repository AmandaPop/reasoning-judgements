then they got back on it.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  What do you cook?  

B.2:  Well, [throat_clearing] I have dinner parties quite often,

A.3:  Oh, really?  

B.4:  and so we, we rea-, I really enjoy cooking.  Um, I like desserts and, uh,

A.5:  Oh, definitely [laughter].

B.6:  main dishes [laughter].  I'm a ((chocaholic)) [laughter]. 

A.7:  Oh, yeah.  Well, see I consider baking different than cooking though.

B.8:  Do you?  

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.11:  I can, I can bake [laughter]. 

B.12:  [Laughter] Well, you know, the best recipes that I have come from SOUTHERN
LIVING.

A.13:  Oh, yeah.  

B.14:  Um, do you get that magazine?  

A.15:  No, but my mother-in-law tells me [noise] and gets it and just loves,

B.16:  Oh, it's wonderful.  

A.17:  to get the recipes.  

B.18:  You know I've never had a recipe fail that I've gotten out of SOUTHERN
LIVING, and I've had dinner guests come over for dinner and, you know, say, I
don't know what this is [laughter] going to taste like [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  I got it out of SOUTHERN LIVING.  It's a brand new recipe, and I've never
tried it before, and, and I've never had them fail.

A.21:  Wow. that's great.  

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Yeah, my mother used to like pick out a magazine and show us the pictures
and say, okay, this is what we're going to have, and we're,

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  like, oh, God no [laughter]. 

B.26:  I w-, well, that's what I do too.  And it has a, it's been wonderful,
right?

A.27:  Yeah.  She did really goo-, ((did)), she did really well, but, I mean like,
her four basic food groups were kind of like mine.  They're frozen, can, box,
and take home,

B.28:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.29:  and I'm, I'm a very picky eater so that's another part of my problem.
When I look at a recipe there's ingredients that I don't like,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  or won't taste, 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  and so it's kind of difficult [laughter]. 

B.34:  Yeah, yeah.  Where you from originally?    

A.35:  I'm from Oklahoma and then, 

B.36:  Oklahoma.  

A.37:  I've been in Texas for a long time.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  But, uh, 

B.40:  So you've had, yo-, you know, Tex-Mex, 

A.41:  Oh, yeah, 

B.42:  and that kind of thing?

A.43:  definitely.  

B.44:  I, 

A.45:  Now see I love stuff like that, but, and a lot of it I will eat but there's
ingredients sometimes that I'm just like, I don't even know what that is
[laughter].

B.46:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I had never had chili in my whole life until I
moved down to Texas.  And I had,

A.47:  Where you from?   

B.48:  Connecticut.  

A.49:  Oh, wow.  

B.50:  And I had never even tasted chili.  

A.51:  [Laughter]. 

B.52:  And I moved down here and it's hysterical because my kids have to have a
refried bean fix at least,

A.53:  Oh, yeah.  

B.54:  once a week.  

A.55:  [Laughter].   

B.56:  [Laughter] You know.  And it's like a week has gone by and we haven't had
fajitas or,

A.57:  Oh, yeah.  

B.58:  or something and, and I just laugh and laugh.  My family would die if
they knew,

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  all these things [laughter] my kids are eating [laughter].  

A.61:  [Laughter] How funny.  

B.62:  That is funny.  That is funny.

A.63:  Yeah, we've always, always had southern foods, but, uh, mother, my mother
is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and
stuff.

B.64:  Oh, really?  

A.65:  And I couldn't do that [laughter]. 

B.66:  No, no, no.  I don't think I would, I would care for that.  

A.67:  No.  

B.68:  But you know what I recently discovered?  There's something, um, at the
grocery store, it's called Cajun Magic.

A.69:  Oh, really?  

B.70:  [Throat_clearing] And it's like in the gourmet section of the,

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  grocery store.  It's on the bottom shelf, and, and it's, um, uh, like red
beans and rice with all the spices already in it.  And,

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  all you have to do is add water and, and cook it, [whispering] and it is
so good.

A.75:  That does sound good.

B.76:  It is good.  It is good, and it's called Cajun Magic.   

A.77:  Okay.  

B.78:  And I'm sure, 

A.79:  I'll have to look for that.  

B.80:  you could probably sh-, you know.  I buy, I buy it at Albertson's.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  And, uh, that's wonderful.  

A.83:  Huh.  And it's in the gourmet section?  

B.84:  Well, [throat_clearing] you know where they have those kind of hard to find
items --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- you know the, the real funny mustards, 

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  and, and that, spices and things like that.  And that's, that's where
they have it at Albertson's and it's,

A.89:  Huh.

B.90:  really good.  I like, 

A.91:  They, your kids,

B.92:  Easy,

A.93:  aren't picky eaters?  

B.94:  I have a daughter who will eat everything.  

A.95:  [Laughter]. 

B.96:  And a son who will eat nothing, so [laughter]. 

A.97:  Oh.  

B.98:  As a matter of fact she's baby-sitting tonight, and she called and she
said, [whispering] Mom, they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger
Helper [laughter].

A.99:  [Laughter]. 

B.100:  And it's delicious [laughter]. 

A.101:  [Laughter] How funny.  

B.102:  And I laughed.  

A.103:  Well, that's what, when I got married, um, both my husband and I had been
living separately so my girlfriend wanted to give me, uh, a wine shower where
people brought recipes.

B.104:  What a neat idea.  

A.105:  Yeah, it was really neat because they brought the bottle of wine and then
they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine.

B.106:  Oh, how nice.  

A.107:  And one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had
written down the number to Domino's Pizza [laughter].

B.108:  [Breathing] I love it.  I love it.  When I worked one time we had a thing
where, we had, uh, uh, luncheon.  And everybody had to bring a dish.

A.109:  Oh, yeah.  

B.110:  And [laughter] somebody gave directions to a, to a bakery, [laughter] you
know.

A.111:  [Laughter].

B.112:  Turn left on Campbell Road and right on, you know [laughter]. 

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  And that was cute.  

A.115:  Well, 

B.116:  That was cute.     

A.117:  desserts are definitely a weakness.  But, uh, 

B.118:  Do you like desserts?  

A.119:  Oh, I love them.  And I'm definitely a ((chocaholic)), but I found
something.  It's a white chocolate mousse cake --

B.120:  Oh.  

A.121:  -- that is just heaven [laughter]. 

B.122:  Is it wonderful?  

A.123:  Yeah, but I wouldn't even know how to begin to make it.  

B.124:  Oh.  Oh.  

A.125:  But I need to definitely find the recipe and at least attempt it because
it, it's so good.

B.126:  Oh, I would love that.  

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  I, I like, I'm not crazy about sweets, but I really have a passion for
cakes.

A.129:  Huh.  

B.130:  Any kind of cake.  

A.131:  Yeah.  

B.132:  I, I really like chocolate cake and, uh, apple cake.  

A.133:  Oh, I've never had, 

B.134:  Love apple, 

A.135:  apple cake.  

B.136:  cake.  Oh, I love apple cake or spice cake something like that.

A.137:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.138:  Yeah, yeah, I really like that.  

A.139:  Especially in the morning that's really good then.  

B.140:  Uh-huh.   

A.141:  Huh.  

B.142:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  

A.143:  Well, I'm getting hungry now [laughter]. 

B.144:  [Laughter] And I just got done with dinner, so [laughter].

A.145:  Oh, really?  What did you fix?  

B.146:  Um, we had beef ribs, 

A.147:  Huh. 

B.148:  and a potato casserole.  And,

A.149:  Goll, 

B.150:  a salad.

A.151:  you really are a cook.  

B.152:  Yeah, I do.  I, well, you know it was so funny when I was, when I was
reading the things and they said, you know, checkoff different categories that
you could talk about.  I thought food. I could talk about food [laughter].

A.153:  [Laughter].  

B.154:  Have you not eaten yet tonight?  

A.155:  Well, I, I did.  I went to the doctor the other day and my cholesterol is
really high.

B.156:  Oh.  

A.157:  And so he's putting me on a special diet on Tuesday, and that's what when
the category came up tonight, I thought, oh, God I'm so glad this is tonight
and not next week because --

B.158:  Oh.   

A.159:  -- um, he's putting me on a liquid protein diet, 

B.160:  Oh, rea-, was your, 

A.161:  and so, 

B.162:  was your cholesterol that high?  

A.163:  It was two forty and I'm only twenty-nine years old.  

B.164:  Huh.  

A.165:  So, he said, let's bring that down.  So he's putting me on some liquid
protein, and I'm not doing to be able to eat for two weeks.

B.166:  Really?  

A.167:  Yeah, so [laughter], 

B.168:  Really, wow.  

A.169:  Yeah, I kept telling my husband, well, goll, 

B.170:  Is two forty really that high though?  

A.171:  It is for, for me and my age bracket.  

B.172:  Yeah,  

A.173:  Uh, so, 

B.174:  yeah.  

A.175:  I think it's supposed to be one eighty, and he thought two forty was a
little bit high for me.

B.176:  You know, what?  I just recently got, um, a cookbook it's, it's the, oh,
what's the name of it?  Uh, LOVE YOUR HEART --

A.177:  Oh, really?  

B.178:  -- cookbook.  It's a low cholesterol cookbook and then I got the American
Heart Association cookbook.

A.179:  Huh.  

B.180:  Now, this is not SOUTHERN LIVING.  

A.181:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.182:  [Laughter] You know, lots of yogurt and stuff like that.  

A.183:  Yeah.  

B.184:  But if you go to like the Bookstop, do you have one of those, 

A.185:  Uh-huh.  

B.186:  in Carrollton?  

A.187:  Yeah.  

B.188:  Um, they have lots and lots of, of, uh, cookbooks --

A.189:  Huh.  

B.190:  -- with low cholesterol recipes.  

A.191:  Yeah.  

B.192:  And, uh, I, every once in a while I get real ambitious, and I think okay,
I'm going to do all this wonderful,

A.193:  [Laughter].  

B.194:  stuff [laughter] and then that lasts for about a week [laughter].

A.195:  Yeah.  

B.196:  And then I'm like, give me the blue cheese dressing.

A.197:  [Laughter] I want a burrito [laughter]. 

B.198:  Yeah, yeah.  Give me some more refried beans.  

A.199:  Well, it's like, 

B.200:  Have you, have you tried,

A.201:  like Oprah Winfrey says, every once in a while you've just got to have
ribs [laughter].

B.202:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Have you tried the, the no fat, no
cholesterol dressings like the,

A.203:  Yeah.  I, I've tried, 

B.204:  Kraft?  The Italian is,

A.205:  them, 

B.206:  the Italian is not bad.  

A.207:  Well, see that, that's part of my problem though.  It goes back to being
such a picky eater.  The only one I like is Ranch.

B.208:  Oh.  

A.209:  Which is like [laughter] the worst as far as cholesterol goes [breathing].
So,

B.210:  Yeah, and does it take, have you tried that?  Is it terrible?

A.211:  Um, I haven't tried the new ones that Heart Smart or not,

B.212:  Heartwise, 

A.213:  Yeah.

B.214:  or Heart,

A.215:  Whatever.

B.216:  Yeah.  

A.217:  I haven't tried the, the newest one yet.  So what I've been trying to do
is just cutback because I just recently even started eating dressing.  And the
only one I like, like I said, is Ra-,
