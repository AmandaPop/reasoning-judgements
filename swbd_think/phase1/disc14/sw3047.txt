B.1:  Do you have children?

A.2:  Uh, yes, yes, I have a daughter.

B.3:  Do you.  

A.4:  Yeah.

B.5:  How old is she?

A.6:  She's only about, uh, uh, a little less than two years old.

B.7:  Uh, [laughter] I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to,
uh, promote a college or anything, huh.

A.8:  No.

B.9:  [Laughter] I've got one that's seven and one that's three, so, we, uh, we
started saving, but that's all.

A.10:  Yeah [laughter].

B.11:  So, do you, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to
go to a particular school?

A.12:  [Sigh] Uh, [sigh], no, uh, um, no particular school.  Uh, I think that's
really a decision th-, #that,# 

B.13:  #That# you are going to let them make.

A.14:  They, well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are, they are
--

B.15:  Right.

A.16:  -- wanting to do.  

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and,

B.19:  Yeah, yeah.

A.20:  You know what, not only what you can afford, but what, what's going to be
best for them --

B.21:  Right.

A.22:  -- in terms of what their career goals are.

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  So, uh, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is
you want to do.

B.25:  Yeah.  Where did you go to school?

A.26:  Uh, University of Mississippi.

B.27:  Oh.  Was that local or, uh,

A.28:  Uh, well, it was, [sigh] well, it was within the state.

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  But it, it was not necessarily local, it was,

B.31:  Yeah.  But I, I mean, so what's, (( )),

A.32:  What's the criterion for choosing to go there?

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  Uh, well, at the time, I was, uh, thinking of going pre med --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med. uh, curriculum for the,
uh, state institutions.

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  It was choice between there and, uh, a private college --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- that, uh, was a bit more expensive.

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  At the time, [sigh] we really could not afford it so --

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  -- I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me.  It,
uh, I enjoyed it.

B.45:  So you, did you commute everyday then or,

A.46:  No.

B.47:  Oh, okay.

A.48:  No, no, it was a six hour drive.

B.49:  Oh, okay, when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it
that meant you had to drive like an hour or,

A.50:  (( )) (( )) I was, uh, it was like another world.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  Basically, it was a, no it was a, did not get home that often, you know,
and at that age --

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  -- it's, uh, it's kind of, kind of difficult sometimes.

B.55:  Yeah.

A.56:  Especially, if you have not been away a lot --

B.57:  Yeah.

A.58:  -- that extended [sigh].

B.59:  So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school?

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  Yeah.  Uh, see I did not get my degree until later on, so I just finished
mine a couple of years ago.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  And, uh, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it
makes, makes your choices a lot easier but,

A.64:  Uh, that's true.  Yeah, that, that's like, you know, when I went on to get
my, my masters --

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  -- I, uh, basically was, you know, it was where I was at the time.

B.67:  Right.

A.68:  You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else --

B.69:  Right, right.

A.70:  -- because I was pretty much settled and I was trying to work.  But, uh, so
when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being
able to --

B.71:  Exactly.

A.72:  -- have some latitude in choosing the place to go.

B.73:  Yeah.  Wh-, which group do you work in in T I?

A.74:  Um, uh, the computer science center.

B.75:  Oh, uh, where is that at?

A.76:  Uh, north building.

B.77:  I see.  How long do you work for T I?

A.78:  Uh, about three years.

B.79:  Did you work somewhere else, like sounds like you got your masters before
here or,

A.80:  Uh, yeah, I have, uh, uh, no actually, I mean I came straight from school
to here.

B.81:  I see.

A.82:  So, cause this was the first, first real job after getting my degree.

B.83:  Uh-huh.  After your masters or after your,

A.84:  After my masters.  

B.85:  I see.

A.86:  My undergraduate degree was not in, not in what my masters was.

B.87:  I see.

A.88:  So I made a career change --

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  -- basically.

B.91:  I see.  Well, let's see [laughter] I, have not (( )) you know, there's a
lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said.
Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford,
different things like that, so I, I have not --

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  -- really made up my mind, you know, whether to encourage them to go
different places or,

A.94:  ((One day)) I would like to, uh, you know, the, uh, I, I like the school
where I went.

B.95:  Uh-huh.

A.96:  I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there --

B.97:  Right.

A.98:  -- there if she wanted to.

B.99:  Right.

A.100:  Or the school where I got my masters at, which, which was a different
school.

B.101:  Right.

A.102:  And, uh, I liked it almost as well.

B.103:  Uh-huh.

A.104:  Uh, but, uh, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that --

B.105:  Right.

A.106:  -- just because I went there.  I, you know, think that's [sigh] --

B.107:  Yeah.

A.108:  -- If they want to, that's fine, but --

B.109:  Yeah.

A.110:  -- otherwise not.  [sigh] Although I ca-, uh, would get quite a break on,
on tuition [laughter].

B.111:  Um, because you went there.

A.112:  Yeah, because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of
state students --

B.113:  Um.

A.114:  -- who children of alumnae.

B.115:  I didn't know that.

A.116:  Well certain schools do it. 

B.117:  Yeah.

A.118:  This school does.  So, uh,

B.119:  Huh.

A.120:  It's, it (( )), I, I was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh,
here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year [sigh].

B.121:  Uh-huh.

A.122:  Uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to [sigh] to, trying to
get people interested in your school, you know.

B.123:  Uh-huh.

A.124:  And they were, this was a college night at a, at a high school in
Richardson. And it was,

B.125:  Uh-huh.

A.126:  And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.  There
were a hundred schools, probably there --

B.127:  Uh-huh.

A.128:  -- all competing for the same kids.

B.129:  Uh-huh.

A.130:  It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, you know, your,

B.131:  Yeah, your #own school,# 

A.132:  #school# And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and
had heard of, you know, our school.

B.133:  Uh-huh.

A.134:  And, and  were interested in it.

B.135:  Um.

A.136:  Uh, you know, we, uh, (( )) situations like that, you don't realize, you
know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of (( )) advantages you
school may have over others.

B.137:  Uh-huh.

A.138:  And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that.  That worked out so well.

B.139:  Yeah.  So did you drum up any interest ((then)) or,

A.140:  I think so.  

B.141:  Well, that's good.

A.142:  I don't know offhand but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few --

B.143:  Uh-huh.

A.144:  -- kids that were definitely interested in going there. [sigh] #So, there,#

B.145:  #And that,#

A.146:  There was one mother who, uh, came by right, even, before we started, who,
who obviously was, uh, very interested in getting her, her daughter in or, or
having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more
information.  But she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, ma-, ma-, dru-, a
majorette or something.

B.147:  Uh-huh.

A.148:  You know, a baton twirler or something --

B.149:  Uh-huh.

A.150:  -- and she was [laughter] she was, letting us know she, (( )) how, how good
her daughter was.

B.151:  [Laughter].

A.152:  She had cards printed up, actually --

B.153:  Oh, really.

A.154:  -- describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you
know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all #this,#

B.155:  #Uh-huh.#

A.156:  and she was, had these business cards she was passing out and it was [sigh]
quite a production.  [laughter] I think some parents go a little bit
overboard.

B.157:   Yeah it sounds like it.

A.158:   [breathing] Yes. [exhaling]

B.159:   Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places
that would definitely
