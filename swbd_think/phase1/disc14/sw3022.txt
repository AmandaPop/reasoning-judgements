==============================================================================

A.1:  Um, I personally have a lot of feelings about the way our judicial system
is run but, um, 

B.2:  Really. 

A.3:  Yeah.  I do not know, I just, uh, I do not know, I.  Have you ever been
for, called for jury duty?

B.4:  No, I have not, have you?

A.5:  No, I have not and.  Oh, is that you?

B.6:  I am still here. 

A.7:  Oh, okay.  Uh, a friend of mine was just called before and, uh, it's
amazing the, that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a
jury for this one case.

B.8:  Good grief. 

A.9:  Because, um, there was, everybody seemed to have some sort of bias, you
know.  Um,

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  It's very hard to find, um, you know, extremely, um, um --

B.12:  Impartial. 

A.13:  -- yeah, impartial people.  But, anyway, I think it would be interesting,
but, uh.  How do you, what do you think --

B.14:  Well,

A.15:  -- about the way it's run?

B.16:  Well, the, you know, on the suggested topic was to talk about whether, uh,
verdicts had to be unanimous decision. 

A.17:  Right. 

B.18:  And I thought that was, that really got me to thinking, you know, and I
think we really need them to be unanimous, be-,

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.20:  # I # would hate to think that, that, you know, if, if I was charged with
something that I was not guilty of, that I got convicted on a, you know, seven
to five,

A.21:  # Yeah.  #

B.22:  # verdict # [laughter]. 

A.23:  [Laughter] That's true, that's a good point. 

B.24:  You know. 

A.25:  Um, aren't they supposed to be unanimous, though now, isn't,

B.26:  # Yeah, they are.  #

A.27:  # that the way # it is? Okay. 

B.28:  I think, I think they need to stay that way. 

A.29:  Yes, I agree.  I do, although, I do not know, I think the judge should be
involved.  [noise]  At this point, I am not sure how it works, but, let's say
that a jury decides somebody is guilty --

B.30:  Yeah. 

A.31:  -- and the judge disagrees, it's not the judges final decision, right, it's
the jury. 

B.32:  Right.  It's absolutely up to the jury. 

A.33:  See, and my feeling is, this judge knows a whole, I do not know, I mean
that's his job, you know that,

B.34:  # I know it.  #

A.35:  # and it seems # like all he is, is a medi-, medi-, mediator, of the whole
thing. 

B.36:  But then if, if you give him too much power, you know, who knows, I mean,
we got crooked cops, 

A.37:  Well, that's true,

B.38:  # [Laughter].  #

A.39:  # yep, # you are right there's crooked everybody. 

B.40:  I know it. 

A.41:  It's really,

B.42:  # So, #

A.43:  # scary because, # you know, you see, I do not know if you ever watch, saw
the movie PRESUMED INNOCENT.  Did you,

B.44:  # No, I did not.  #

A.45:  # see that? Oh, my # god, it's fabulous, if you ever,

B.46:  # Is it? #

A.47:  # can rent # it or something. 

B.48:  I have been trying to and it's just never there. 

A.49:  Really. 

B.50:  Yes. 

A.51:  It's just great, and it, it's scary, because it's just about that, there
are crooked cops and the whole case points to this one guy and you know he is
innocent and, um, 

B.52:  That, that kind of stuff ought to scar us to death. 

A.53:  Yeah, it does. 

B.54:  # I mean, #

A.55:  # And then you # watch this guy go to jail for, um, I should not be telling
you because you are going to want to see it. 

B.56:  Well, I know that he goes (( )) for the murder, right. 

A.57:  Yeah.  And he goes to jail, um,

B.58:  # I just, #

A.59:  # oh, it's really # scary. 

B.60:  That would be awful. 

A.61:  Yeah.  But, but then I also see, um, oh I do not know, this one case here
in Rochester where, um, we had a serial killer and they finally caught him.
And, it (( )) here he, the guy had basically admitted to killing twelve girls.

B.62:  Good grief. 

A.63:  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  And, uh, yet it was, it was almost a type of thing
where he almost was not guilty because they had this little flaw,

B.64:  # That's, #

A.65:  # in # one piece of evidence. 

B.66:  that's what bothers me,

A.67:  # Oh, uh, uh, #

B.68:  # the technicalities.  #

A.69:  Yeah,

B.70:  And, that's where I think the judge maybe ought to have more say. 

A.71:  Right. 

B.72:  You know. 

A.73:  I agree. 

B.74:  Because I can not believe that, that we can let the people off that we are
letting off, because you did not tell them this one statement,

A.75:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.76:  # before # you took them to jail,

A.77:  # Right.  #

B.78:  # you # know [laughter]. 

A.79:  Oh, right.  Or the whole, the Marion Berry thing, you know,

B.80:  # Yeah.  #

A.81:  # the # ((good)) governor.  Uh, how they determined that he was, um, oh, I
do not know, it was set up or something. 

B.82:  # It's just, #

A.83:  # I mean, # (( )) this guy is,

B.84:  I am sorry. 

A.85:  selling drugs, it's not set up, he was just doing it. 

B.86:  He was doing it,

A.87:  # Yeah.  #

B.88:  # I # mean, entrapment,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.90:  # I # am sorry, you know. 

A.91:  I would love to be on a jury, because I, I do think it's fascinating, I,
uh, I, I think it, it's, it's a hard system, I mean, you are never going to
get a right and a wrong.  You know,

B.92:  # No.  #

A.93:  # it's # just,

B.94:  There's no blacks and whites,

A.95:  # Tha-, that's right.  #

B.96:  # it, it's shades # of grey. 

A.97:  Yep. 

B.98:  And I think I am like you, I think it would be really fascinating, I do not
think I would want to be on a highly publicized case though.  I do not think I
would like that [laughter] at all. 

A.99:  Me either, because it is tense for the jurors that were on this serial
killing, uh, they could not read the newspaper,

B.100:  # I am sure.  #

A.101:  # they could not # watch T V, they could not talk about it, and this went
on for like six months.

B.102:  Well, you know, they had, uh, a big drug trial in Roanoke, Virginia --

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  -- a couple of years ago, and my, my husband was called for,

A.105:  # [Inhaling]  Really.  #

B.106:  # jury duty # on that.  And he said that they had guards, armed, you know,
guards posted everywhere, and he was really glad that he was not called,
because he,

A.107:  # Wow.  #

B.108:  # said # that this would have been too much. 

A.109:  Yeah. 

B.110:  So,

A.111:  Oh, my goodness. 

B.112:  I would not like that at all. 

A.113:  I like Judge Wopner type of thing [laughter]. 

B.114:  Yeah.  a real simple uncomplicated thing. 

A.115:  Right,

B.116:  # Yeah.  #

A.117:  # like # my dog bit the neighbor or something [/laughter]. 

B.118:  We could start out small and work our way up. 

A.119:  Yeah, exactly. 

B.120:  So,

A.121:  But it's just, it's scary, because, um, the-, there's just so much that can
go wrong that could let an innocent person be convicted or a guilty person have
them let go. 

B.122:  Absolutely, the,

A.123:  # And,  #

B.124:  # the nuances.  #

A.125:  Yeah, and, um, I do not know, I guess it's, it, I do not know a lot about
the terms, but a hung jury, is that when [inhaling], 

B.126:  # [Inhaling]  That, #

A.127:  # it's not completely # unanimous. 

B.128:  Yeah, you know, it would be split one way or another and, and that ends in
a mistrial.

A.129:  Oh, so what happens, nothing. 

B.130:  So, they have to retry them. 

A.131:  Oh. 

B.132:  They have to bring in a whole new jury, they have to absolutely start over
again. 

A.133:  Oh, my god. 

B.134:  So, and I do not know how many times you can have a hung jury. 

A.135:  Uh-huh. 

B.136:  I do not know if they,

A.137:  # Uh [noise], #

B.138:  # the-, I do # not guess they have to go back to trial.  I guess, you know,
they could drop the charges,

A.139:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.140:  # if # they did not think they would ever,

A.141:  # [Inhaling].  #

B.142:  # convict # him. 

A.143:  Did you see SIXTY MINUTES, by any chance, on, um, I guess it was this past
Sunday night. 

B.144:  No, I did not. 

A.145:  [Inhaling]  They showed a guy who, uh, he's a lawyer,

B.146:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.147:  # and # what he's like known for now, is getting men, um, off of charges of
killing their wives,

B.148:  # Oh, that's nice.  #

A.149:  # or their ex-wife.  # Yeah, isn't that lovely.  So, there's this guy, um,
I forget what his name is and he is a lawyer, someplace, and he's gotten, so
far, about four or five men, um, free of the charge.  One guy went in, stabbed
his ex-wife to death, because she was sleeping with another guy,

B.150:  # Oh, my gosh.  #

A.151:  # I mean, ex-wife, # you know, we are talking,

B.152:  # Yeah, we are (( )), #

A.153:  # and, um, he got him off # on the basis that he was, he went temporally
insane. 

B.154:  Yeah, I will bet he did. 

A.155:  Right, temporally insane, that she provoked this in him, because he was so
madly in love with her,

B.156:  # [Inhaling]  Oh, for, #

A.157:  # that seeing, you know, # this other man with her just drove him crazy. 

B.158:  And it was her fault that he killed her. 

A.159:  Yeah, exactly, it was her fault. 

B.160:  # Sure.  #

A.161:  # Her, # uh, they interviewed her parents, it was crazy.  So now he has to
serve like six months in a rehab center.  And,

B.162:  And get psychiatric treatment. 

A.163:  Exactly,
