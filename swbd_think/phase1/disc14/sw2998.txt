other quite a bit.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Um, what do you think [laughter] the major cause of air pollution or at
least in the Boston areas,

@B.2:  Well, the, the, the major cause it seems up here is exc-, I live right on
the ocean so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if I lived in
some of the valleys inland,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  but the major cause here, and we always seem to, and it seems to be
validated by the press, is the car pollution.  We don't have too much
industrial pollution.

A.5:  Yeah, yeah.

B.6:  Uh, car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that, that I can
really put my finger on here.

A.7:  Um, that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any
major, um, industry except for, uh, government and services.  And the, the
transportation situation is such that, uh, all the car pollution is, is
absolutely awful.  Um, also the ((worth)) of the hub of three airports in this
general area there is, uh, National, Dulles, and then, uh, Baltimore,
Washington.  And it, interestingly some of the information I've been reading
indicates that the amount of air pollution from, uh, uh, airplanes is
extraordinary.

B.8:  Is that so?  

A.9:  Yeah, 

B.10:  I didn't know that.  

A.11:  and that's ((always)) something that, you know, you just don't real, you
don't think about.

B.12:  Well, most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than
the air pollution.

A.13:  But the, uh, apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered
right up in high altitudes --

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- is a very significant factor.  

B.16:  I would think so.  You know, uh, i-, I guess it talked about all types of
pollution.  I happen to r-, just read something the other day at least in the
Boston paper there were three things that, that come to note.  One, is that
the carbon fluorides that are, [breathing] uh, being released into the
atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the
ozone layer and again and now they've located another one or la-, rather an
expanding one in the northern hemisphere.  So car-, so I'm quite concerned.  I
don't think it's involved any longer with, with, uh, hair sprays or those 
th-,

A.17:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

B.18:  No, I think it's now, is what, uh, from what I understand it's
air conditioning units and, and,

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  we certainly turned into an air conditioned -- 

A.21:  Society [laughter],

B.22:  -- [Laughter] society.  

A.23:  has especially recently [laughter].  

B.24:  Yeah, I know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned,
and I do quite a bit of business in Washington.  And,

A.25:  I mean you know what it's like here.  

B.26:  Oh, yeah, it's quite, is, is the un-, it's really out of the norm not to
find something that isn't air conditioned.  And,

A.27:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

B.28:  and #I guess refrigerators,# 

A.29:  #We just had the,# 

B.30:  are the same way.  They release that.  

A.31:  That's right.  So, solutions to this, 

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  would be I, I, 

B.34:  Well,

A.35:  you know, improved.  Well, I guess the fur-, the, to me the first thing
is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get, getting people
upset about animal rights.

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  I mean this is so, so basic.  It's human rights in the sense, but, uh, in
terms of demanding, it's just not caused but demanding that, uh, we can spend
so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward,
um, improvement of polluting vehicles, and not just cars but also buses, um,
planes.  That something can be done.  I me-, I can't imagine that ((well)),

B.38:  Well, I, I th-,

A.39:  if we can't send people to the moon, 

B.40:  Yeah. 

A.41:  that we can't improve these things.  

B.42:  No, I think that it can be done simply because, uh, uh, we've, we've, every
car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what
they call a catalytic converter.

A.43:  Converter, yeah, uh-huh.  

B.44:  And no lead gas was, came to the pumps.  And, and that's been done.
There's the lead pollution has, that problem, essentially I guess because it
was at crisis proportions was,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  was licked.  And I think that there are th-, there are solutions,

A.47:  And #that (( )) for buses,# 

B.48:  #certainly we don't even need a,# need a research anymore.  It's just a
matter of passing the law, and passing the law depends on how heavy the car
industry, the automobile lobby is.

A.49:  That's right.  Well, and also to make it economically feasible.

B.50:  That's right.  That's right.  

A.51:  Uh, and per-, ti-, also in buses.  I don't know if you ever got caught in a
traffic jam behind a bus,

B.52:  Oh, yeah, well,

A.53:  That, you know,

B.54:  That, that, the, the smell is awful and but, you know, I was reading the
other day not to go on with this but that,

A.55:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.   

B.56:  diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes.

A.57:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.58:  So, I guess you're [laughter] better off sitting behind a bus than a car
although I can never, I could never, uh, really a-, a-, rationalize that while
I was sitting there [laughter].

A.59:  Yeah, but even, of course, in the longer term just to get away from fossil
fuels.

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  I mean, I'm, I'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we,
we've taken the intermediate step but I don't think,

B.62:  Well, we, you know -- 

A.63:  fossil fuels are the answer.

B.64:  -- up here in New England, uh, where I've, right close to where I live is
the ((Seabrook)) Nucleus site which is,

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  practically a, you know, guerilla war up here, 

A.67:  Yes I me-,

B.68:  went on for years.  Uh, my daughters marched in the, uh, uh, against the
((Seabrook)) and I kind of, uh,

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  my feelings were that we needed this bridge to, 

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  to, uh, to m-, m-, jump from whatever it was going to be, from fossil
fuel to whatever it was going to be.

A.73:  Yeah, you don't throw the baby out with the bath water, 

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  and condemning nuclear use.

B.76:  Un-, unfortunately though I think the oil companies have lied to us for
years [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah, yeah.

B.78:  So we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there
isn't, and, uh, and, uh,

A.79:  But with the pollution issue, uh, fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway.

B.80:  No.  

A.81:  Uh, so you've, to lo-, you've got to look elsewhere.  

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  So, uh, but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact, well,
I, within our family we have said, my husband, I have two sons, uh, well, one
is already in college in New England,

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  and the other will be going in September, and we just feel that when we
leave, uh, this area, w-, we're going north, not south.

B.86:  Yes.  

A.87:  Uh, I like the mentality north, and I also like the fresher air up there.

B.88:  That's right.  

A.89:  So, I mean that's the way we will be going.  

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  But, um, so, I, i-, I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also
from the far west on this issue to see how they, their attitudes are.

B.92:  Well, since, since Texas and Louisiana and, uh, California that, in that
ranking order, the worst pollutants in America.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  I mean, I read that the other day.  I mean Louisi-, Louisiana for a small
state w-, it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution I should imagine.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  And California seems to be taking steps, I mean, you, you read about the,
the ((fairly)),

A.97:  The smog and, yeah.

B.98:  fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're, they're enforcing.

A.99:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.100:  But, uh, again, uh, that didn't occur without a crisis.  Nothing will
occur, I guess, without a crisis.

A.101:  I mean, ((even)) California was notorious for its smog #years ago,#

B.102:  #Yeah, exactly.#  

A.103:  before it even was an issue,

B.104:  Exactly. 

A.105:  out here.  

B.106:  Well, the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of
years as far as I'm concerned, is the no smoking rules,

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  on airplanes and in restaurants.  And it, it really is a pleasure for me,
although, I guess smokers don't [laughter] think that.  #But that,#

A.109:  #Well, that,# that's, 

B.110:  to me was pollution (( )),

A.111:  that's person-, that's personal air pollution [laughter].  

B.112:  that was its most personal, 

A.113:  Yes, yes.  

B.114:  personal, uh, pollution that I can think of.  

@@A.115:  Yeah, well, I, I, d-, definitely advance that.  Well, listen I enjoyed
speaking with you.

B.116:  Surely.  

A.117:  And let's hope some, there are other people that feel the same way
[laughter].

B.118:  (( )) something happen.  Right on, thank you.  

A.119:  You're welcome.   

B.120:  #Bye-bye.#  

A.121:  #Bye-bye.#
