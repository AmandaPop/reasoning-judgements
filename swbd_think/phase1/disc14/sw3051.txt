REMARKS:        Speaker A pretty much dominated the conversation.  There
was considerable noise in the background of A; children, TV and other 
talking and yelling.

======================================================================

B.1:  There you go. First question, do you own your house?

A.2:  Uh, right, well, we try. [laughter] I mean it's a big mortgage in the sky
and someday, maybe, we might even own it, but, um, for all practical purposes,
I guess we hold the mortgage  [laughter].

B.3:  Our name is on the till,

A.4:  Yeah, right.  

B.5:  so that implies ownership.

A.6:  No one else has offered to pay for it.

B.7:  That's right.  I would not object if anybody did.

A.8:  Yeah, really they could move right into the spare room [laughter].

B.9:  Yeah.  Well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.  Before that
we lived in Garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park.  It's a, uh, I don't
know if you have been up here, but it is a residential homeowners,

A.12:  Right, yeah,

B.13:  association.  So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses
and common land.  [sigh] But, uh, we thought we were buying at the bottom of
the market, you know, it could not possibly have gone [child_talking] any
lower and so we were wrong [laughter].

A.14:  Oh, five years ago.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  Yeah, 

B.17:  I think, what, it bottom out about a ye-, year later.

A.18:  Yeah, it, well, I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two
years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out.

B.19:  Oddly enough, two years, you know, I, uh, I think that,

A.20:  But, maybe not in your area, see, it was just different areas,

B.21:  not in, in, uh, this area.  Cause this is about like the,

A.22:  That's a really nice area.

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  Besides, it's, you know, [noise] it's not, it's not Richardson.  Is it?
It's still considered Garland.

B.25:  No, it's, it's Richardson.

A.26:  Oh, ok, yeah.

B.27:  It's, Richardson and, hold on a second. [/child_talking] {Speaking to
someone in room} Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well, I don't want
to hear you.  You are being rude.  Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the
phone, the answer is no.  Do you understand?  {Back to talking on phone} How
does that sound?

A.28:  There you go.  #Write that one down.#  

B.29:  #Yeah, there I go.#

A.30:  It sounded good to me [laughter].

B.31:  Yeah, well, I hate to say how long that will last too.  [laughter] No, this
area up here is, uh, all custom homes, and,

A.32:  Right.

B.33:  it's, I don't think that many by the builder that built this house.  And,
we were not the first people, the first owners, I think we are the third
owners.

A.34:  Uh, okay.

B.35:  It was built by the architect for himself, [sigh] who never moved into it.
Who sold it to a couple who had [sigh] no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.

A.36:  [Laughter] Oh, no.

B.37:  [Throat_clearing] Oh, yeah, caulking windows was a great mystery to them.

A.38:  Oh, gee.

B.39:  So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet.  [sigh] But, it's a
Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything, it did not really mean anything
to me #except,# 

A.40:  #I, I,#

B.41:  I liked it.

A.42:  kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere,
so,

B.43:  He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now.  I think he got out of
the lower end market.

A.44:  Uh.

B.45:  And decided, but, the houses here in, in this class of housing never
dropped below two hundred.

A.46:  Oh, wow.

B.47:  Yeah, well [laughter] but, still I know that this one was built for two
ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it.

A.48:  Right.

B.49:  And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot,
[children_talking] heavily wooded off the golf course.

A.50:  Oh, great.

B.51:  Yeah, and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said, uh,
well, he did comparables that it's about [noise] eighty dollars, let's see
what, I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot
[children_yelling],

A.52:  ((Well))

B.53:  off the creek and eighty on the creek,

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  or, if it was eighty and a hundred.

A.56:  Probably #eighty.# 

B.57:  #I think# it was sixty, eighty.

A.58:  Sixty, eighty.

B.59:  I think.  

A.60:  [Noise] Well because, I know our, our little house over here stuck in the
middle of, you know, the subdivision is, I think fifty five, so, I think the
high end is definitely, {speaking fades} you know somewhere there [Children_yelling].

B.61:  Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot [talking].
No, it could not be, because this house has around thirty four hundred square
feet, and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.

A.62:  Yeah.

B.63:  Just never.

A.64:  Well [TV].

B.65:  Now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for,
uh, brand new, or that's pretty much what it was built for.  It's got an awful
lot of nice things in it but, you know, I don't think, I think it's going to
be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and
all the other additional amenities [sigh] are really, [sigh] uh, desirable.
It's seems like people go for square footage only now --

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- and, uh, [Noise] cause.  Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back
here?

A.68:  Um, [noise] the ones that look like brick houses [laughter]?

B.69:  The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.

A.70:  Right. [laughter] Yeah, I think those are awful. [laughter] I'm sorry, I
just don't see the designer's, I just see him as trying to squish as much
space, you know, as much house into the space as possible.

B.71:  They are huge when you are inside them.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  They are very spacious.  They are, you know, I was, (( )) I was in one
today.  It was forty two hundred square feet.

A.74:  Uh.

B.75:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.76:  Well see that's, the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I,
because there's just the two of us and the two cats, um, can yell at each
other from one end to the other and be heard.  And we thought that was
important instead of getting [laughter] swallowed up in something that you
know.

B.77:  See, when you have kids, you like to be able to,

A.78:  Yeah, that's true.

B.79:  send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them.  But, I
have been watching these houses go up and I, I don't, well, somebody was
telling me, I know somebody who lives back there, I have always questioned the
quality [noise] of construction and I, I don't think they exceed more than
twelve nails per house.

A.80:  Oh.

B.81:  When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over.

A.82:  {Very faint} Yeah.

B.83:  And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house.

A.84:  Oh, that's amazing.  Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a
deck put on in back, and these guys are phenomenal.  They just, they, they are
doing such a terrific job back there, I mean, you know, you pay for it too,
but it's, it's like, really worth it.  They are putting in a deck, 

B.85:  Uh-huh.

A.86:  a redwood deck, and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job.

B.87:  We have got --

A.88:  I'm really excited about it,

B.89:  -- three different levels of decking, because,

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  this lot slopes way back down and, uh, the house is built around the
trees.

A.92:  Great.

B.93:  And with these decking that a corporation and a large (( )) area for the
trees to come up so, it's real, real shady.  [child_talking] But, that's one
of the few things that really, uh, immediately pays back on return.  But, what
I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there,

A.94:  Yeah.

B.95:  [Laughter] when the people from M C I come down and they are, you know,
they are used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C.

A.96:  Uh.

B.97:  My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial
look #what the,# 

A.98:  #Looks like# the George Town brownstone [laughter].

B.99:  Right,

A.100:  Yeah.

B.101:  And, uh, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square
feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars,

A.102:  #Must be a dream.#

B.103:  #which is probably# about what their equity is, that they got out of
selling their house.

A.104:  Yeah.

B.105:  ((Because)) those things are selling like hot cakes.  But, one of the
people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air
conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred
#dollars# -- 

A.106:  #Oh.#

B.107:  -- a month.  And I thought,

A.108:  I can't #(( )),#

B.109:  #(( ))# and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here.
And I was thinking, well, you know, I know why your God damn bill is so high,

A.110:  #He has no insulation, probably.#

B.111:  #it's because there's not a# there's no insulation, [noise] insulation in
those things.

A.112:  Oh, my.

B.113:  Yeah.

A.114:  Gosh.  What a trap.  Huh.

B.115:  Any yet, you know, they, they show very well un-, they show very well
unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area,

A.116:  And you ask the right questions and can research, yeah.

B.117:  or looked at a lot of houses around here.

A.118:  Yeah.

B.119:  And I think that makes a big difference.  But, I like, I like this area and
everything that I #have been saying,#

A.120:  #Oh, I do too.#

B.121:  says that it's, I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to
breaking even  [child_crying].

A.122:  But, still, um, it's worth it for the area and for the school and things
like that {very faint}.

B.123:  You're in, you're in the,
