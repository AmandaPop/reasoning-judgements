time.

==========================================================================
 
A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right well, I'll just start by saying that we, we spend our time, you
know, having a formal dinner on, on the weekend.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  And that's when we try and get together, it might be breakfast it might be,
and we try and talk about things and we tr-, we have dinner every night too
but not everybody is always there.

A.5:  How old are they?  

B.6:  Our daughters are fifteen, seventeen, and twenty.  

A.7:  Oh, wow.  

B.8:  And, um,

A.9:  Are they all living at home?  

B.10:  They are at home, um, our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at S M U.

A.11:  Oh, wow.  

B.12:  So she's home for summer school and living at home, um, right now.

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  And we, we, but we very rarely do things as a whole family.  

A.15:  Well, when they were little though you did, didn't you?  

B.16:  Yes.  Yes.  We used to like,

A.17:  Yeah, because they're all close enough in age that you would have had to
take them all [laughter].

B.18:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we, we used to like to go to, oh, parades, the circus, um,
you know, we used to like to take them to the park.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  Um, we had a, we have a swimming pool at our house which we've had since
they were very small.

A.21:  Oh, that's nice.  

B.22:  So we, we have many memories of swimming, uh, together in the afternoons.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  You know and by the pool and the girls, uh, learned to swim when they were
real little, you know, three and,

A.25:  And then they had their parties there and all that. 

B.26:  Yes, they had their, their pool parties, um, so that was one of the things
we did together was the most, uh, I guess the most often was swim by th-, swim
in the pool.  That's,

A.27:  Yeah.  Well, see, I mean, you know, since we haven't had our children yet
but, um, the thing that my husband and I do could very easily be incorporated
with children because we like to go camping and we like to, we have a boat so
we go in the boat all the time,

B.28:  Oh, that's great,

A.29:  and so,

B.30:  if you like to do those two things. 

A.31:  Yeah, and so, you know, those things shou-, children could very easily go,
you know,

B.32:  Very easily, yes. 

A.33:  and just go with the flow.  

B.34:  Yes, I think you will enjoy that.  I, we never camped and we, we aren't, we
aren't into boating either.

A.35:  Oh.  

B.36:  Uh, mainly because my husband doesn't like boats that much and he, uh, it's
mainly what I, you know, what he wanted to do.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  And, and he's a swimmer, he's a golfer, so, uh,

A.39:  Did he teach them how to play golf?  

B.40:  Well, he has taken them out on the golf course but he hasn't, and they've
never showed any, an-, any real interest.

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  It's got not enough action,  

A.43:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.44:  for, for the children, you know, so, um, but we, we like to, um, but now,
you know, now next weekend we're taking them to a show.  We're taking them
down to Fair Park to see CHORUS LINE.

A.45:  Oh, really?

B.46:  And that's kind of their reward for a school year, 

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  successful school year.  

A.49:  Well, that's a great one.  

B.50:  So we're, we're doing that.  

A.51:  Well, that will be fun.  

B.52:  But, um, but I, you know as far as having a family it sounds like you've
got some good ideas.

A.53:  Yeah, it's,  

B.54:  How about your families, are they close by your immed-, your, um,

A.55:  Uh, my parents are in Oklahoma, 

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  and I have my oldest sister lives there with her two kids, and these are
the only grandchildren at this point so they're getting tons of attention but,
uh, they're a lot of fun and my nephew's in to tee ball,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  and so they spend a lot of time but they're in this little bitty small
hole in the road town so, you know, they have a lot of time that they can
spend with their kids.

B.60:  Yes, that's nice.

A.61:  And that's you know, that was another question that my husband and I had is
that wha-, we have four dogs and we barely have time to play with them
[laughter].

B.62:  [Laughter] Four dogs, well, that's,

A.63:  Yeah, yeah.  Those are my children right now [laughter].  

B.64:  Yeah, I think that's, I think that's a bridge that everybody uses,

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  to get used to taking the responsibility of caring for something and 
then,

A.67:  Well, it was real funny because we were walking out of a store one morning
and he turned to me and he said, did you feed the kids this morning?  And I
said, no, didn't you?  And this lady looked at us like we were child abusers,

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  and [laughter] so we had to explain to her we were talking about our dog
[laughter].

B.70:  That's great.  Yeah, that's cute because I know our dog I didn't think he
got fed this morning but our, our daughter fed him.

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  Because we have, we have two daughters that are away right now.  They're at
a camp.

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  Uh, uh, not a camp they're on a choir tour,  

A.75:  Oh.  

B.76:  that's (( )) were they are, so they're, they're gone so it's just me and
our older daughter,

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  here this week but, um, but you will, um, I, I think that's neat that
you're going to start a family and, and, um,

A.79:  Yeah.  It,

B.80:  And, and I know everybody around you your family will be very supportive
and very anxious too I'm sure.

A.81:  Oh, yeah.  They, they,

B.82:  I, I have to tell you that, um, grandparents are very important to have
close by I think.

A.83:  Oh, I know.  

B.84:  And ours were never close by.  

A.85:  Really?  Well, see mine, since like I said my fami-, my, my parents started
out so late having us my grandparents all but one was already dead even when
before I was born so I didn't get to have that but,

B.86:  That's interesting.

A.87:  I had aunts and uncles that were so close to me that, you know,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  replaced grandparents I think in every way.  

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  So, 

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  it's really neat,

B.94:  So how old is your l-,

A.95:  that I can do that now with my niece and nephew.   

B.96:  Well, how old are your parents now then?  

A.97:  Um, my mother's seventy-five and my dad's seventy-three, 

B.98:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.99:  so,

B.100:  Well, that's exactly how old my parents are.  

A.101:  Oh, really?  

B.102:  Yeah, and, uh, but, but they are the, reversed.  My dad's seventy-five,

A.103:  Oh.  

B.104:  my mom's seventy.  Well, actually my mom's seventy-two, my dad,

A.105:  Well, they're a lot of fun now [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure they are.  

A.107:  But also it was neat too because, um, there was so much age difference
between my sisters and me that I was kind of like the only child and,

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  so mother and I did tons of things together.  We I mean she didn't drive
but she'd load me up on a bus and we'd go across country and just had the best
time.

B.110:  Isn't that wonderful.

A.111:  Yeah, it was really neat.  So we were really close but (( )),

B.112:  Oh, you must have such great memories of that.  

A.113:  Oh, I do.  It's really neat.  

B.114:  That is so good.  

A.115:  Yeah, because it was real funny because in high school all my friends were
fighting with their mothers [laughter] and I wasn't.  I was having a ball.  I
mean,

B.116:  Isn't that, 

A.117:  on spring break that, 

B.118:  That's really interesting.  

A.119:  Yeah, on spring break I'd go with mother to the horse races and all my
friends would go to Padre Island [laughter].

B.120:  Oh, that is great.  I, because that's very, that's rare.  

A.121:  Oh, yeah.  It was so much fun.  

B.122:  Yeah, because I was the, I'm the oldest of four.  

A.123:  Oh, really?  

B.124:  And we had a, we have a very close knit family.  And I, I just, I am just
very blessed.

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  But being the oldest I had, you know, the responsibility of --

A.127:  Uh-huh.   

B.128:  -- of doing a lot.  I have two younger brothers and a sist-, a younger
sister so, um,

A.129:  Oh.  Well, see that's another thing that scares me about having kids
because I was the baby so I haven't even really been around kids.

B.130:  Yes.  Yes.  Well, you'll, well, you have your niece, your nephew and --

A.131:  Yeah.  

B.132:  -- to, to look at that and, and learn from that.  

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  And you can read lots of good books.  

A.135:  Oh, yeah [laughter]. 

B.136:  But, um, but that's real fun.  So, and you're in Carrollton? 

A.137:  Uh-huh.  

B.138:  Yeah, and where what, what church do you go to?  Do you,

A.139:  We're Methodist.  

B.140:  Oh, good.  

A.141:  Yeah.  

B.142:  Yeah.  So are we.  

A.143:  Yeah.  So,

B.144:  Yeah, we've been in Plano for thirteen years. 

A.145:  Oh, really?  

B.146:  And, uh, our kids have grown up here.  

A.147:  Yeah.  

B.148:  And I think, I think Plano, I think the fact that you have the boating and
the camping is a good,

A.149:  Oh, yeah.   

B.150:  good thing.  I think it's hard for parents to find things to do with
their kids.

A.151:  Yeah.

B.152:  Once the sports aren't there.  

A.153:  Well, 

B.154:  You know, anymore like we have, we always have the baseball games to go to
that the kids are in and the,

A.155:  Uh-huh.  

B.156:  you know, tee ball, soccer, stuff like that.  

A.157:  Yeah.  

B.158:  But, uh, after th-, as they get older it's harder to find things to do
together.

A.159:  Yeah.  Well, we have all I mean (( )) and I both have camped since we were
little with our parents and so I think it's very natural and I'm sure that's
the way it will be.

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  And, we've already looked in the catalog to, to find a little baby ski
jacket [laughter].

B.162:  Oh, [laughter] oh, that's great.  Well, where do you go camping?

A.163:  Um, we go to Lake Whitney a lot, 

B.164:  Oh, yeah.

A.165:  which is, it's a beautiful lake.  And then we go, 

B.166:  Well I was just down near there.  

A.167:  to Arkansas.  

B.168:  I, I had to drive to Austin --

A.169:  Oh, really?   

B.170:  -- last week and on Thursd-, last Thursday as a matter of fact my, I saw
the sign.

A.171:  Oh, yeah.  

B.172:  And, uh, I didn't know, it was pretty I just I,

A.173:  Oh, it's a very pretty lake.  

B.174:  Well, that's good.  

A.175:  Yeah, it's, it's real clear which is kind of unusual for Texas lakes.

B.176:  Yeah, and they have campgrounds and,

A.177:  Oh, yeah, they have some great campva-, grounds and then we like to go to
Arkansas too because that's where I camped when I was little.

B.178:  Yeah.  

@@A.179:  And there's some beautiful lakes there.  

B.180:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.181:  So, um,  

B.182:  Well, that's interesting.  I am not timing this conversation because I
guess you're supposed to be in control it says.

A.183:  Well, yeah.  

B.184:  And,

A.185:  But I just kind of keep talking until we quit [laughter]. 

B.186:  [Laughter].  Well, this is my first call so, um,

A.187:  Oh, really?  

B.188:  Yeah,

A.189:  Yeah.  

B.190:  yeah, I, I enjoy, uh, this is really going to be a neat thing I think.

A.191:  Yeah.  I do too.

B.192:  But, um, I, it's, it's, I think I'm going to need a pencil, you know,

A.193:  [Laughter]. 

B.194:  to, to jot down what they say in the beginning and that because it's
hard, they're, it's like ...
