B.1:  Okay.  

A.2:  Okay.  

B.3:  Uh, well, what's your favorite T V program?

@A.4:  Well, I tape one soap opera everyday and I watch that.  I've been watching
that since I was in college, and we made our class schedules around it so we
could watch DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  And then, um, pretty much I like the thirty minute sitcoms in the evenings.
I mean I don't, I don't get to watch them a lot but I do watch MURPHY BROWN
and DESIGNING WOMEN.

B.7:  Huh.  

A.8:  So, what do you watch?  

B.9:  Uh, well, to the, to the great chagrin of my husband I, I love all forms of
entertainment, and so I, I watch ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT with regularity
[laughter].

A.10:  Oh, yeah.  I love it, but it comes on so late.  

B.11:  I tape it and watch it the next day [laughter].

A.12:  Oh, you do?  [laughter]

B.13:  [Laughter]  Yes.

A.14:  Well, that's a good ide-, yeah, because I was real disappointed because on
Sundays I used to especially try to watch it and because they kind of cut you
up during the week,

B.15:  Right.  

A.16:  and, uh, then they put on some other goofy show after tha- ...

B.17:  Well, they've been doing it Saturday nights now.  

A.18:  Oh, really?  

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  What at the, at ten thirty?  

B.21:  Ten thirty.  

A.22:  Oh, I'll have to watch that then.  

B.23:  Um, for an hour {very faint} I mean.  

A.24:  Yeah, I'm sure my husband doesn't care too much for that either
[laughter].

B.25:  No, [laughter] that just, what can I say it's just [lipsmack] a matter of
taste,

A.26:  Yeah.  

B.27:  and the rest of the time, right now there's not a T V series that I'm
particularly glued to.

A.28:  Yeah.  

B.29:  Uh, I watch some of the anthologies if they've got something interesting on
like MASTERPIECE THEATER or mystery or something like that.

A.30:  Oh, really?  

B.31:  #Yeah.#

A.32:  #Yeah,# um, channel thirteen had on a, a thing about astronomy that was
really neat,

B.33:  Yes.  

A.34:  but I didn't get to see all the parts.  

B.35:  We saw, we saw several of those not all of them.  

A.36:  Huh.  

B.37:  And, uh, so we're, we're, we're pretty (( )) watchers.  We've, I've been
introduced to the joys of STAR TREK so we watch that with,

A.38:  [Laughter]. 

B.39:  [Laughter] with,

A.40:  The old ones or the new ones?  

B.41:  total, total devotion.  

A.42:  [Laughter]  Do you watch the new ones too?  

B.43:  Uh, ye-, only the new one.  

A.44:  Oh.  

B.45:  I, I, I, I never really was interested in the old one,  

A.46:  Yeah.  

B.47:  and, uh, and so but I, I like the cast of the new one so, uh, that's what
we watch.

A.48:  Well, that's pretty neat.  Yeah, I don't even know when that comes on
anymore.

B.49:  Uh, Saturdays.  

A.50:  Oh, really?  Um, well, we go to the lake a lot so, when I don't get to see
it that much T V in the summertime --

B.51:  Uh-huh.  

A.52:  -- and plus everything is in reruns anyway so I guess it works out.

B.53:  True, that's true.  Uh, I, I'm a very selective watcher.  I, I look at the
T V section and decide what I'm going to watch and watch it.

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  But as a rule I don't sort of stroll around the dial and, 

A.56:  Yeah, without, 

B.57:  let things catch my eye.

A.58:  with the old remote control in hand [laughter]. 

B.59:  Yes.  Unlike certain parties [laughter].

A.60:  [Laughter] Yeah, I've got my niece and nephew coming this summer so I
thought, well, I ought to get the Disney channel because there's some fun
stuff on there,

B.61:  Oh, yes.  

A.62:  even for me to watch.  

B.63:  Oh, yes, and also I don't know how old they are but there's Nickelodeon.

A.64:  Oh, yeah, I love Nickelodeon, but they get that.  But where they live they
live out in the boondocks of Oklahoma, and they don't get the Disney channel.

B.65:  Oh, well, 

A.66:  So, 

B.67:  they would enjoy that.  

A.68:  Yeah, I think I might have to do that.  But I mean, just some of the movies
that they have on there I would love to see.

B.69:  Uh-huh.  

A.70:  So, I might, 

B.71:  So would I.  

A.72:  have to do that.  

B.73:  I wouldn't admit it to anybody (( )).  

A.74:  [Laughter] Yeah, I like the older movies better I think.  Uh, channel
twenty-one or somebody played, uh, HELLO DOLLY last night.

B.75:  Oh, well, [throat_clearing] yes, you hit upon a, a weak spot of mine.

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  I wo-, I, I have a thing for the actor who played Cornelius ((Hackel)).

A.78:  Oh, really?  

B.79:  Yes.  

A.80:  Yeah, it was neat.  

B.81:  N-, I mean, forty, I'm here twenty years later (( )) [laughter].

A.82:  [Laughter]. 

B.83:  That's because he's, uh, he plays the PHANTOM OF THE OPERA now and ...

A.84:  Oh, I didn't realize that.  

B.85:  Oh, yes.  And m-, his voice is somewhat developed.  

A.86:  Yeah.  

B.87:  To put it mildly.  

A.88:  Yeah.  

B.89:  And so, uh, b-, but I've already got that on tape so we didn't tape it
[laughter].

A.90:  [Laughter]. 

B.91:  I like old movies.  I love musicals.  

A.92:  Oh, I do too.  I mean I've got, um, HIGH SOCIETY on tape that I taped and,

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  uh, you know, all the older ones.  

B.95:  Uh-huh.  

A.96:  They were, 

B.97:  Right.  

A.98:  fun to watch.  They're real good on rainy days and there's nothing else
on.

B.99:  Oh, I know.  

A.100:  Sit back and watch the old musicals.  

B.101:  I know I keep a little, a little, a little library and if I get stuck I can
resort to my little library,

A.102:  Oh, yeah.  

B.103:  in all sorts of things.  

@@A.104:  Yeah, because that does happen a lot.  There is nothing on anywhere on
cable or anything.

B.105:  It's surprising with all the choice we have sometimes there's no choice.

A.106:  Yeah.  [laughter] It's strange.  [laughter] Well, um, did I catch you in
the middle of something?

B.107:  Not really but, uh, you know, I'm, luckily I wo-, had, I hadn't started
dinner yet.

A.108:  Oh.  Yeah, I've, I've already finished mine.  I haven't done my dishes yet.
My husband is on his way home,

B.109:  Huh.  

A.110:  so.  [lipsmack]  Well, I, do we have a time limit?  

B.111:  I don't know.  I got kicked off the other day because they said the lines
were busy.

A.112:  Um.  

B.113:  But I think, I, uh, I don-, I think that's unusual.  

A.114:  Yeah.  

B.115:  I don't think that's typical.  

A.116:  Um.  Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.  

B.117:  Me too.  Me too, and, uh, you k-, you keep on watching for those old
movies.

A.118:  Oh, I will.  

B.119:  All right.

A.120:  Got to tape them [breathing].

B.121:  All right.  

A.122:  Thanks.  

B.123:  Bye-bye.  

A.124:  Bye.
