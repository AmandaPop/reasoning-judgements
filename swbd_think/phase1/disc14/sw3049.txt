==========================================================================

A.1:  What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, actually?

B.2:  Oh, I gue-, I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN --

A.3:  Uh. 

B.4:  -- a couple weeks, months ago. 

A.5:  Right.  The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I
have actually watched videos at home.  I've, uh,

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.7:  # uh, # become available to come and go more often, so I said "hey, it's
worth it, I'll just go at the matinee hour and I can see what I please." 

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  It's no more costly than renting one.  The last, see I went about two or
three weeks ago and saw F X TWO and that is a really good movie, if you like
special effects, kind of gory and lots of, you know --

B.10:  Uh-huh. 

A.11:  -- action. 

B.12:  I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. 

A.13:  Um, [laughter]  do you know that I don't follow performers,

B.14:  # Oh.  #

A.15:  # I # don't follow actors.  [laughter]  Some I know,

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # some # I don't. 

B.18:  Yeah. 

A.19:  Uh, and he was the guy, the guy that played in it, he was not the star, but
the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, uh, [sigh] 
oh, the one about the old people. 

B.20:  COCOON?

A.21:  COCOON, uh-huh. 

B.22:  Okay. 

A.23:  He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON. 

B.24:  Oh, okay. 

A.25:  I don't, I don't know what his name is. 

B.26:  Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though. 

A.27:  Yeah.  At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND.  That was with
Richard Dreyfuss. 

B.28:  Okay. 

A.29:  And, that one was just a very poignant story, it, it, it had people, it
was, it was [noise] you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny
movie, but it was,

B.30:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.31:  # a # very, it was a poignant humor and there was, it was like, uh, uh,
STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  The characters played very well off one another.

B.32:  Uh-huh. 

A.33:  And there was humor involved, but the story was a very dramatic story, and
I enjoyed it very much.  What are some others that you have seen lately?

B.34:  Oh, I'm trying to think, uh, just the other night on H B O we watched THE
HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,

A.35:  # Oh, whoa, yes.  #

B.36:  # again and that's # one that,

A.37:  That's one I can watch,

B.38:  # Yeah.  #

A.39:  # over # and over and over again. 

B.40:  I was going to read while it was on, but then when it started, I just
couldn't, you know, read.  That was a really good movie. 

A.41:  It sure was.  And, you know, the second time you see it, you understand
more subtleties in it.  There are a number of good movies like that.

B.42:  Yeah, there's quite a few, uh, movies out now that I would like to go see. 
My husband,

A.43:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.44:  # is # not a real big movie goer,

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.46:  # and # I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go. 

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  Plus, by the time you get a baby-sitter, and then pay to go to the movies
--

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  -- it just gets pretty expensive. 

A.51:  [Laughter]  Right.  You don't work?

B.52:  No, I stay at home. 

A.53:  Okay.  Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him
call in sick one day. 

B.54:  Yeah.  [laughter]  Go during the day, that's right. 

A.55:  That's right.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Go in the early hours,
it's a matinee, it's not crowded and the price is as reasonable as renting a
video.

B.56:  Yeah. 

A.57:  And that's the way I do it and I go quite frequently. 

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  If you are going to be planning on doing that, now I was WARLOCK too, which
is supposed to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that is, you know, magically
shot into the present time. 

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very
well persuaded to walk out.  Very well persuaded, there was more gore than I
was interested in seeing.

B.62:  Uh-huh. 

A.63:  But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, I can't really
that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.  But,

B.64:  # Yeah.  #

A.65:  # uh, # the action was comfortable and, of course, I enjoyed those good
guy, bad guy type conflicts things.  So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first
few minutes of gore.  And there were some others, but they were done a little
more tastefully.

B.66:  Yeah. 

A.67:  But, uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because
he wanted the ring and then --

B.68:  Uh. 

A.69:  -- bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and I could not handle
that.  I said "whoa, [laughter]  I'm glad I have not had dinner". Then, uh, I
saw AWAKENING, that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De
Niro.  I, uh, I, uh,

B.70:  Robert De Niro?

A.71:  Robert De Niro, what did I say, Peter?

B.72:  I think you said Peter. 

A.73:  I said Robert De Niro. 

B.74:  Yeah. 

A.75:  And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, uh, disabled
person. 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

A.77:  And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you
can't help but enjoy what he is doing.  [sigh]  Even when he's sad, you know,
you great faith that he will get happy again. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. 

A.79:  And then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go
see before they go into videos.  I guess, I can wait another month and they
will be videos.

B.80:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.81:  One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  I've heard a lot about that one.  They say if
you really want to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to
see.  And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about
two weeks ago on television.  Uh. 

B.82:  Well, you know, I think I read about that too. 

A.83:  Uh-huh.  And then THELMA AND LOUISE, I think it's time we had a lady abuse
the guys movie.  [laughter] It's about time for one of those.  I want to go
see that.

B.84:  Yeah. 

A.85:  And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES. 

B.86:  Oh, you haven't, I've heard that is wonderful. 

A.87:  Uh-huh, I've heard it's wonderful too, but I, it's just that they are both
very long --

B.88:  Yeah. 

A.89:  -- uh, movies, and the matinee starts before I can get away from work. 

B.90:  Oh. 

A.91:  And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to --

B.92:  Yeah. 

A.93:  -- don't want to go back. 

B.94:  Yeah, I've heard that's, we, uh, we, uh, rented the other one, I was trying
to think of the other one that we had rented lately, uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT,
with, uh, [sigh]  Harrison Ford, I guess he's in there. 

A.95:  Uh-huh. 

B.96:  And, I thought that was really good. 

A.97:  You know, I saw that and I really [laughter]  I cannot remember too much
about it. 

B.98:  It was the one where he was a defense, uh, not defense, he was a prosecu-,
-cuter. 

A.99:  Uh-huh. 

B.100:  And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A -'s
office. 

A.101:  Uh-huh. 

B.102:  And then he ended up being accused of it. 

A.103:  Oh, that's right, I remember now.  Yeah, I remember. 

B.104:  Yeah, so, I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found
out who it was [laughter].

A.105:  Uh-huh.  Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything
since the Indiana Jones movies.  I think he ought to stay [laughter] Indiana
Jones.  [laughter] I realize that he would like his career to develop, but I
don't want to see him in other things.  [laughter] But, uh, I tell you, Sean
Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I, I never did care for him as, in the
James Bond movies.  ((I don't know he was too)).

B.106:  I was never into those movies, either. 

A.107:  Yeah, I didn't care for the type of movie, but he was always slick, and
greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and
[laughter]  I didn't like him.  But, he has really developed into a marvelous
character actor as he has come older. 

B.108:  Yeah, I thought he looked real good with a beard, too. 

A.109:  Oh, yeah, yeah, he does and there is just a, there's a, I don't know, uh, I
think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or
not. 

B.110:  Yeah. 

A.111:  And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in
mischief all time.  [laughter]  And, I enjoy those, and I enjoy some of the
Michael J.  Fox movies.  I didn't care too much for the last one either.  It
just was not enough to it. 

B.112:  What was the last one? I'm trying to think. 

A.113:  Uh. 

B.114:  Uh, the last, like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then ((was the last one)).

A.115:  No, no, no, it was called, uh, [noise]  HARD WAY, where he was an actor,
trying to portray --

B.116:  Oh, okay, trying to (( )),

A.117:  -- trying to portray, portray a policeman. 

B.118:  Yeah. 

A.119:  And that,
