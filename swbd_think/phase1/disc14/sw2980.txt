==========================================================================

A.1:  Are you a computer professional?

B.2:  Uh, well, I would like to call myself that, yes.  But I'm sure there's
always something new to learn, because we have a growing, [laughter] growing,
uh, computer world out there.

A.3:  And are you working at the Texas Instruments, or are you at home?

B.4:  No, I'm at, uh, Texas Instruments.

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Uh, what's, what's your application for P C -s?

B.8:  Oh golly, numerous application presentations, uh, memos, uh, uh,
spreadsheets, um, just all kinds of things.

A.9:  Oh, okay.

B.10:  I don't do any plotting, though, I don't do any, you know, I don't do any,
uh, device creations or anything like that --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- like in Autocad, I don't do those.  But we have that capability here.

A.13:  Oh, okay.  Well, I got involved in, uh, computers because I have an
interest in speech recognition.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Which is probably why I got involved in the T I switchboard project.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  That's been ongoing for quite a while now, is the speech
recognition.  It's, uh, I don't know how old it is, but I know they've been
pursuing it for a long time.

A.17:  And will probably pursuing it for a long time to come [laughter].

B.18:  That's right, yes, a lot of, uh, glitches to get out of it --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- to work out of it, uh-huh.

A.21:  Well, I bought a, uh, P C, oh, well I bought a series of personal computers
of one kind or another, but the latest one I bought for the children to use,
uh, for their educational games and for entertainment games, and I soon
discovered that it was running faster than the I B M P C A T that I had
purchased to do my, uh, uh, postgraduate studies.

B.22:  Oh, that's interesting, isn't it.

A.23:  So, I've, uh, I've taken over the children's computer [laughter] --

B.24:  Oh, my word.

A.25:  -- and, uh, enhanced with, uh, the Texas Instrument D S P board --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and I'm using it for speech recognition research at this point.

B.28:  Well, that's wonderful.  How are you advancing on your, uh, endeavors?

A.29:  Well, I've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a
sentence that I speak into the microphone.

B.30:  Well, great, that sounds good.

A.31:  And, uh, it's, it's just now up and running in that mode --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and I've got to make a lot of improvements and improve my models, and
adjust coefficients and try to improve performance a little bit --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- but the first results look promising.

B.36:  Well, that's wonderful, that's wonderful.  Now if we can get everybody
together that has got all these, uh, uh, new inputs that they're doing for
speech and if they could get them together and compare notes they probably
[laughter] would do well to jump a couple of hundred feet in that area.

A.37:  I think we're getting to the point now where there's a lot of people who've
done research in a lot of individual areas --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and we're sort of entering the phase now where I think we're starting to
pull some of these results together,

B.40:  Well, that's good, do you have,

A.41:  and getting them to work together.

B.42:  do you have a group that, uh, you can interface with each other, like,
uh, who's interested in speech,

A.43:  Well, not really, uh,

B.44:  That wouldn't be a bad idea, though, do you think that,

A.45:  Well, my company has, has expressed an interest, and they've asked me to do
a lot of research so --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- I've been [horn] travelling around the company, country [/horn] talking
to, uh, different groups.  I spent, uh, three or four days in Boston earlier
this year --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- talking to M I T and Bobrank {phonetic spelling} and them and, and a
place named Sonotek {phonetic spelling}, just to find out what their state of
the art is, and I see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the
problem.  And I think the focus of my dissertation is to, uh, to look at four
different, uh, technologies that have already been researched and see if I
can't make them work together --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- in synergy to, to get a step ahead --

B.52:  Uh-huh [horn], uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and, uh, so I think [/horn] that's probably the way things will go in
the future, to, they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech
recognition.  I would say that there will be, well, there'll certainly be a
lot of commercial products on the market --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- in the next five years --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the
turn of the century.

B.58:  So, it's that, that soon.

A.59:  Yeah.  Uh, there'll probably be some, you know, reasonable breakthroughs in
terms of, uh, bringing products to market.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  It's going to be interesting to, uh, uh, look at.  I'm not
involved in it myself, you know, but, uh, just hearing what is going on at T I
is very fascinating, and I don't know that much about it.  I know that, um, in
the group that I was working in there was an area that was really focused on
speech recognition.  However, I'm not in that, uh, organization any more.
Within T I.  I'm in, uh, a different area of T I now, working on something
totally different.  So, uh, my interest was spurred, and then it was
[laughter] taken away because I, I, um, was moved out of that area.

A.61:  Yeah.  I think it's an interesting field and,

B.62:  Oh, it's definitely very fascinating.  

A.63:  My primary interest is in speech understanding --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- uh, so once we get the, the basic word recognition or something
resembling word recognition --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing man
machine dialogue type operations.  Like intelligent tutoring systems that, uh,
the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows
or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly --

B.68:  Oh, that's wonderful.

A.69:  -- and, uh, getting the interactive speech is a key part of that. But,

B.70:  That's like almost giving them a, um, evaluation --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- and going into the direction where they're gifted in. 

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  That's wonderful.

A.75:  Well, it's, it's sort of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use
during the day.  They, they're teaching a grade stool, grade school student to
add and subtract.  They, they pose problems for them and they see where they
make their mistakes --

B.76:  Um, uh-huh.

A.77:  -- in carrying or, uh, in borrowing or something like that --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and they then pose problems which will, you know, point out the proper
procedure and then test them again to see that they've learned that fact.  And
so that's, that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is in developing
that kind of an art in a machine.

B.80:  Well, you're, you sound like you're very current with all that information.
Uh, I know, because you have children, too, and you're also interested in the,
uh, voice recognition.  It's been so long since [laughter] my chil-, my
grandchildren are in school now, but I won't [laughter] have to worry about
them any more.  Just worry about your children, and, uh, let, let the, let the
parents worry about the, about their babies.

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  But you just know that their doing well.  So, but I don't have any idea
what's going on in the schools today.  I'm not active in any school other than
paying my school taxes [laughter].
