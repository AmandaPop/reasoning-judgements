===========================================================================

A.1:  Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns
around the place and, uh,

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  I'm, uh, not for gun control,

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  in the strictest sense of the, uh, word.

B.6:  I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  You know, I have quite a collection myself and, you know, I'm a good
hunter and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.  [talking]
Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes and,

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely but I don't want
them to completely turn loose of their controls either so,

A.11:  Yeah.  Well I, I feel that its, uh, I think the what was National Rifle
Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you
outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns then.

B.12:  I believe that.

A.13:  And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to,

B.14:  [/Talking].

A.15:  commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a gu-, a gun, a
knife, a, a rock,

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about
use of guns, uh, we can handle it but there's an element that can't.

B.20:  Yeah and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our
police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic
weapons because everybody that's in drug trafet-, trafficking has got them.

A.21:  They have got them outgunned.

B.22:  You know.  Yeah.  #So.#

A.23:  #There was a# an article in the paper just this week where I think it's,
uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten
metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I --

B.24:  Um.

A.25:  -- which would give them additional firepower.  It had, held like a fifteen
shot clip,

B.26:  Yeah [sniffing].

A.27:  which, uh, would be able, th-, they would be able to put down anything
that came at them,

B.28:  Yeah, #that would be,#

A.29:  #but you# figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi
machine gun, uh,

B.30:  Yeah, that's,

A.31:  a thirty-eight, uh, Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much
good. 

B.32:  No it's sure not.  Huh-uh.

A.33:  Yeah.  I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time and they, they passed a,
uh, it wasn't really gun control but it was, you had to register as a gun
owner, you didn't have to list your guns,

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  but you had to have this card, it was like a driver's license card that
you had to have it in order to buy ammunition --

B.36:  Um.

A.37:  -- and that was the first, uh, this was twenty years ago.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit
#in that respect.#

B.40:  #See in California they,#

A.41:  Pardon?

B.42:  In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.

A.43:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

B.44:  You have to sign a, you know, they take your name and driver's license
number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff,

A.45:  Yeah. 

B.46:  before you can buy any big ammunition.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  [Talking] Especially for handguns, 

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  now rifles aren't too bad, but, you know, any kind of handgun at all,

A.51:  [Throat_clearing].

B.52:  if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it,

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  or sign up for it, so.

A.55:  We lived in Tennessee for awhile and I bought a pistol there and there was
a fifteen day waiting period.  You had to fill out an application and,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted and,

B.58:  Gee.

A.59:  then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind
of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.

B.60:  Gee, that's not a bad idea.

A.61:  No, I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh, 

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen
that's going to comply with that.

B.64:  Yeah, yeah it is.

A.65:  So there's, #I don't,# 

B.66:  #No.#

A.67:  think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is
concerned because,

B.68:  Th-, the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the
penalties on anybody using a gun.

A.69:  Right, right.

B.70:  You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course, i-,
I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway, I think if somebody shoots
somebody, they ought to be shot.

A.71:  Yeah, I'm,

B.72:  So.

A.73:  [Laughter] We, we're getting into capital punishment now [laughter].

B.74:  Yeah, [laughter] but, you know.

A.75:  But I, I agree with you there that, uh,

B.76:  It would definitely be gun control [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah.  The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it
is being used --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- is what the purpose should be. 

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific
purpose, legal purpose --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his
hands but,

B.86:  Myself.

A.87:  the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there
is the criminal element.  

B.88:  Yeah.  Well and the-, they're actually a necessity in life, #you know.#

A.89:  #Oh yes.#

B.90:  They're not, you know, not everybody needs a gun but sooner or later I need
one.  You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know, I'm never had to protect
my life or,

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street so I don't
really need one in the, in the ((aspects)),

A.93:  [Talking] You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh,

B.94:  No, huh-uh.

A.95:  [Laughter] or your pocket all the time.  Yeah.

B.96:  No.  So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  I don't, and I enjoyed my guns.  

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  I have a good time with them so, 

A.101:  Well I know what, uh, I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot
a gun.  My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we
have no-, not that I have an arsenal or anything,

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  but we have several guns around the house [breathing] one of these days my
grandkids probably.

B.104:  Probably.  Yeah.

A.105:  But I think it's, uh, you got to have, have the pl-, living in Dallas
there's not that many places to go shoot but,

B.106:  No, huh-uh.

A.107:  uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not
just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh,
they get back up.  If someone gets shot with a,

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  real gun they don't get back up.

B.110:  Yeah.  I had to explain that to my, I've got a six year old now and he, you
know, I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well they understand
now.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  You know I've taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know
and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go
out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,

A.113:  Yeah.

B.114:  so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of
windows and I took it away from him, I said now,

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  you know, so he's learning the hard way but at least it was a B B gun  
not a twenty-two or a four ten or something so, 

A.117:  I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and,
uh, showed me.  This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle, this was a
gentleman in his sixties,

B.118:  Um.

A.119:  and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  and taught me how to shoot.   We went squirrel hunting and,

B.122:  All right.

A.123:  and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two and,
I was probably about twelve at the time,

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  and I thought that was the neatest thing and,

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him and he let me
shoot and showed me how.

B.128:  All right. I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun
owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how
to use one.

A.129:  Right.

B.130:  You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow
me away, so.

A.131:  Oh, [laughter] yeah.  [sniffing] Well that's about all I, we agreed pretty
well on this I think.

B.132:  Yeah, I think so.

A.133:  Okay.  Well it's been real nice talking with you.

B.134:  All right, #have a good one.# 

A.135:  #Okay, bye.#

B.136:  Bye-bye [/talking].
