REMARKS:       Speaker A had background noise.  Both speakers strayed 
from the subject a little.

=======================================================================

@A.1: Okay.  I hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where they're
going [laughter] than I do beca-, 

B.2:  Oh, I know a little bit about it.  I'm not a die-hard fan but I, I enjoy
the, I like the Boston Red Sox myself.

A.3:  Well, I, of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball
the best.  However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years, but I have
kept, uh, my eye on the Rangers.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  You know and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point, and then
they kind of fell on their face [laughter].

B.6:  Well, with, uh, their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the
rest of the team lately, so.

A.7:  Correct, right.  They've got a one man show going there.  

B.8:  Right [laughter].  

A.9:  [Laughter] Which is interesting, you know.  Um, 

B.10:  Oh, it's amazing.

A.11:  I guess he can, I guess he can really ((call down)) a salary [laughter].
They're so astronomical I can't even imagine --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- [Laughter] that kind of money.  You know it's just, uh, phenomenal
[lipsmack].

B.14:  Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week,
were in first place and doing quite well.

A.15:  Well, good.  

B.16:  Um, I've been really busy at work this past week and normally on my way
into work I'll pick up a newspaper and, uh, i-, so every day I'll have a
newspaper at work, and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.
But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop [laughter].

A.17:  I understand.  I understand.

B.18:  But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.

A.19:  Okay.  Uh, you are involved with T I -s, uh, speech, um, recognition?

B.20:  Well, not really.  I, um --

A.21:  How did you find out about it?  

B.22:  -- I work at (( )) laboratory.  

A.23:  Oh, okay.  

B.24:  From, uh, I'm an officer in the Air Force, 

A.25:  I see.  

B.26:  and, uh, 

A.27:  Interesting.  

B.28:  they have a speech lab across the hall from us.  

A.29:  Oh, great.   

B.30:  And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I, 

A.31:  I see.  

B.32:  at, uh, not in my office but, uh, in my division they do, 

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  quite a bit of speech work.  

A.35:  Well, that's good.  Well, that's interesting.  And the topics are
interesting, uh, they run a whole ((gamut)) of, of, uh, subjects, and, uh, I
think we can address every topic, but the depth of knowledge is quite
different.

B.36:  Sure.  Sure.  

A.37:  So, uh, when they chose baseball, I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand
baseball, you know, I don't understand football.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  Um, you know, uh, it's such a rugged game that it, uh, uh, it seems to be
too physical for my, uh, interest [laughter].

B.40:  [Laughter] Oh, I prefer to, I, I like, I never used to really like
watching football that much but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a
football game, but I've always liked baseball.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  I, I prefer to watch, um, I guess I'm one of the few people that also
prefers baseball to football.  And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game
than to a football game.

A.43:  Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.  But I
can't relate to football because I've never,

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  played football and, and don't, and have any interest, and I said if I
ever had a son, he would not play football.  And, uh, I had four daughters
[laughter] so that wasn't a question, but now I have a grandson that i-, you
know, is gung ho for, uh, football.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And, uh, that doesn't please Grandma too much.

B.48:  Well,

A.49:  I'm always af-, because the injuries are, uh, can be very, very
devastating.

B.50:  Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.  

A.51:  I understand that,

B.52:  I'd, I,

A.53:  but I think the, they happen more in football.  I think the odds are cut
down.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.  The bat is a very
heavy object, can do a lot of damage but, uh, I think that they have a, a
lower ((racial)) of injuries,

B.56:  Uh, 

A.57:  ratio of injuries in baseball.

B.58:  baseball, it's true.  I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the
less,

A.59:  Because the-,

B.60:  troublesome sports, 

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  but, uh, for some people it's just, uh, uh,

A.63:  A love for them.   

B.64:  Well, that, not so much that but, uh, even in baseball you can, like when I
played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing
the ball because I wa-, very, I was always very strong and I could-, th-, when
I was young I could throw harder,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.

A.67:  I see.

B.68:  And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  having trouble.  I, and I was a catcher so I was constantly throwing back
to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and k-, that kind of
stuff.  So I, that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant
throwing, so.

A.71:  Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?

B.72:  No, I did that wrestling [laughter]. 

A.73:  Oh.  Oh, okay.  

B.74:  No, I'd, well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different
things and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.
But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like, now I won't play
football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,

@@A.75:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.76:  so.  Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling, but it, as long as
I let it heal, it never really bothered me then playing football this fall,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  I, it was just flag football too.  I separated it again and it seemed to
be,

A.79:  Oh, boy.

B.80:  like the straw that broke the camels back, so.  

A.81:  Uh-huh.  Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was
three.  It was never set right.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.  And, uh,
one of the men that was in our rel-, on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know,
uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.  And he says, let me show you
how to use your arm to your advantage.  And so he brought me up from like a
hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.

B.84:  My God.   

A.85:  [Laughter] So, uh, yeah [throat_clearing].  Um, it was really funny, you
know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how
to, uh, follow through with my, uh, ((addressing that)), to put the ball,

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  the, uh, pins.  So that was interesting.  So I really, um, I got a lot
of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  I'm not sure where all my pins came from, but it's, but that was quite
awhile ago but I, and I never pursued it.  And a lot of people said, well, you
should have turned pro.  And I thought, no, not m-, m-, I don't, my love
wasn't there for the game.  I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment
and I, uh,

B.90:  Sure.  

A.91:  fellowship but outside of that, no.  I didn't.  And I, and I still, I
like to bowl, but, uh, [lipsmack] I don't have, uh, Jack [laughter] standing
behind me to tell me what to do [laughter].

B.92:  Are you on, you on any leagues now?

A.93:  No, I'm not.  

B.94:  Oh.

A.95:  No.  No, uh, at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement and,
uh, it's true bowling and I've never, uh, shared that with them.  I would have
to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, uh, win a lot of money for
the junior achievement,

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  uh, organization.  But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be
(( )) to do.

B.98:  Right.  Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty,
forty years.  I don't know,

A.99:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.100:  a long time. 

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  And she still, she's got to be,

A.103:  Still carries a good lim-, uh, average?

B.104:  Well, no, she does-,
