===========================================================================

A.1:  [Throat_clearing] Well crime's not very bad out there.

B.2:  No, as a matter of fact, I understand we have one of the lowest crime rates
in the area --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- but then we aren't, we're only a city of five thousand.

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  How's Richardson doing?

A.7:  [Throat_clearing] It's been a lot worse this year.  Um, they have a lot
of drug dealers over on, you know where Spring Valley is and Coit?

B.8:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.9:  It's real bad there.  Has been for a few years.  Especially on the Dallas
side.

B.10:  Um.

A.11:  Dallas is just across the street, and, and, uh, they've closed down a bunch
of apartment complexes and, uh, you know, like that, and they're having to
crime sweep.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  Well, I wonder why it effects certain,

A.13:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.14:  areas, because I, I, I've lived in the Dallas area perhaps for about
thirteen years now, and I used to live in that, not in that particular area,
but on that side of, of Dallas.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And that was always a, a fairly good area in there, if I remember
correctly.

A.17:  Yeah, it used to be.

B.18:  But, um, I guess it moves in different uh, areas at different times.  Um,
the only problem that we have here are, are, you know, just very minute sort
of crime.  We have neighborhood crime watch programs, and then the city police
patrol the areas at least one a day, and when you're not at home, you're to
notify your neighbors, of course, that, you know, you're going out of time, et
cetera, et cetera, and not do the things that are so obvious to, uh,
potential,

A.19:  Right, get someone to pick up your papers and your mail --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- set your lights on timers, and,

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  But, um, other than that, that's about the only thing we're doing in
Sachse.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  The murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas,
well, especially Dallas.  Last year in Fort Worth, this year,

B.26:  I think I saw on T V just this evening, that there was a pregnant woman,
and, and some members of her family killed.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Was that over in Fort Worth?

A.29:  Yeah, this morning, uh-huh.

B.30:  Um.

A.31:  And apparently they already, they already caught him, or they're talking
about somebody else.  They're talking about two million dollar bond for
somebody.

B.32:  Is that right?

A.33:  Yeah.  I never, I never heard all of the story about that.  I just heard it
from people at work, and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- on the radio, uh, a little bit.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  Oh.

A.37:  It's really been [throat_clearing] Fort Worth has really been bad, because
of the kidnappings and all the armed robberies.

B.38:  I wonder why over there.  I mean, I'm glad it's not over here, if you have
to have it, but, I don't understand why cert-,

A.39:  I, I think, I think that, um, they're just getting, well, they had that
crazy person that [music] kidnapped the, the woman and took her all they way
to Saint Louis before they were caught --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- you know, and she called the F B I.

B.42:  Was it over in that area last year that they had the man, um, that was in
the mall and this other man shot his wife in, in the mall area, [/music] she,
and she was screaming and heading towards the entrance to the mall and they
shot her, and then there was a man in the, um, parking lot and he pulled out a
gun that he had in his car and he shot the, the guy,

A.43:  Oh, I --

B.44:  Was that over in,

A.45:  -- I think that was Redbird.

B.46:  Oh, oh, that was Redbird.

A.47:  Yeah, it's real bad, too.

B.48:  Um.

A.49:  Everywhere there's a mall there's bad crime, though.

B.50:  As a matter of fact, this summer,

A.51:  [Sniffing].

B.52:  ear-, ear-, actually earlier this spring I had gone to Collin Creek mall,
and my hubcaps were stolen --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- and the police officer told me that, um, th-, the malls are a very good
area where these people like to go and steal the hubcaps.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  They just steal one side.

A.57:  Yeah, exactly, uh-huh.

B.58:  And, and, take off,

A.59:  They stole the emblem off of one of mine.

B.60:  Did they?  [Laughter].

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  We-, I don't know whether that's a faddish thing or what.

A.63:  Apparently,

B.64:  And then it costs us so much to, uh, replace those things.

A.65:  From the insurance, yeah,

B.66:  Uh-huh, yeah, surely.

A.67:  They also, they tear off the hood ornaments, too.

B.68:  Uh-huh.
 
A.69:  And one of them costs thirty dollars.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  So.

B.72:  And your deductible, of course, doesn't meet that.  It's under that --

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  -- normally,

A.75:  That's right.

B.76:  Yeah.  I don't know.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  Um, I really don't know what else to say {silence}.  Does that about cover
it?

A.79:  Yeah, I think so [laughter].

B.80:  Okay [laughter].

A.81:  I mean, and they said, take what steps, and we already discussed that.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  About the only thing you do is, is to provide the protection in
your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night, if you go out
at night, and, um, certainly that's about the best thing we can do.

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  And, uh, they have any laws against that sort of thing.

A.85:  Yeah, I work at Valley View and they have horse patrols, and um, and they
have the mall security that, that drives around --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes, at night
especially --

B.88:  Oh, really.

A.89:  -- because they have so many stolen cars.  And they've had, um, three,
three armed robberies of jewelry stores.

B.90:  Um. 

A.91:  And, uh, and they've all been in the middle of the day --

B.92:  Um.

A.93:  -- you know, and one of them was three hundred thousand dollars.

B.94:  That's quite a lot of money, isn't it.

A.95:  Yeah, really is.

B.96:  And it gives other, I imagine, other, uh, potential crime people, uh,
ideas, too.

A.97:  But I've seen, they've stepped up security quite a bit.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  And the police are around a lot more now, so,

B.100:  I imagine they're going to need more police officers, too --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- if they do that.

A.103:  Then they us-, they use undercover, too.

B.104:  Yeah, I guess that's true.

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  Well, even here in Sachse we have one undercover police car.

A.107:  Right, uh-huh.

B.108:  And actually if we had to call him a few times, and they're usually on the
spot in about five minutes.

A.109:  Oh, yeah.

B.110:  Course, as I say, we're a small town.

A.111:  Small town, but --

B.112:  Yeah,

A.113:  -- still, you know.

B.114:  Yeah, at least they're there.

A.115:  Right.

B.116:  So.  Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.

A.117:  Yeah, it's nice talking to you.

B.118:  Okay, have a good evening.

A.119:  You, too.

B.120:  Bye-bye.

A.121:  Bye-bye.
