=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay so, 

B.2:  First how much television watching do you do?

A.3:  I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone
during the day,

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  and I like it just for the noise [laughter].

B.6:  That's right, but do you actually watch it, 

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  pay attention to it or is it more of a company?

A.9:  Um, it just depends on what it is.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  I mean, I have my favorite things that I do,

B.12:  Uh-huh, okay.

A.13:  and then some fun thing to do sometime.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  Um, what about you?

B.16:  Well, actually, I work full time and when I am not working I am running and
I do not watch a lot of television and I am very selective in what I watch.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and
watch it and then turn it off.  I probably watch television four hours a week,
max.

A.19:  Well see that's great, yeah.

B.20:  And, and, uh,

A.21:  Well,

B.22:  if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to
watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.  I would rather listen to music.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the
kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and I think that if we
are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us
and we do not know where that influence came from.

A.25:  Well, I think that, well, part, I think that's partially true, too.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  I think you have to have the will and the, and, uh, anyway, I think it,

B.28:  Uh, right, right, right.

A.29:  you are, you would be susceptible to stuff. 

B.30:  Of course, I, uh, 

A.31:  And it has to be reinforced at another level too.  But,

B.32:  That's right.

A.33:  anyway, what would you watch, if you had, you know, this week to watch?

B.34:  I, uh, 

A.35:  Do you like specials?

B.36:  Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched
UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.  Those are fascinating to me.

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  If I have the opportunity, I watch it.  Unfortunately, I was with someone
else who was flipping channels.

A.39:  Oh [laughter].

B.40:  I hate that.  [laughter] I do not care a whole lot for some of the
contemporary humor.

A.41:  Oh, right, yeah.

B.42:  In our comedy programs, although, [inhaling] nobody can appreciate comedy
any more than I can, but I would prefer to find, [inhaling] a good comedian on
one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians.

A.43:  Well, we have cable also,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  and sometimes you can, um, get the H B O specials,

B.46:  That's right,

A.47:  and sometimes those are really,

B.48:  and some of those are fine programs.

A.49:  pretty hysterical.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  So, I, I like to watch comedy, I mean,

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  and that's something.  But,

B.54:  I, I enjoy comedy.

A.55:  I am not,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  real up to date on what's going on now, 

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  I, I guess I have my old favorites, but I am,

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  hooked on, you know like Bob Newhart is still on.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  I watch him.

B.64:  I enjoy that, uh-huh.

A.65:  And, uh, you know, something on that level, 

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  I, I also enjoy, uh, I do not know, Sunday mornings, it's Channel
Thirteen, I watch a lot,

B.68:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.69:  of Thirteen, uh, THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP, and I,

B.70:  That's right.

A.71:  I just laugh, I mean, I think that's so hysterical,

B.72:  Uh-huh  [laughter].

A.73:  these guys.  It's just so much fun.  It's just, it's just a lot of fun,

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  watching that.  I mean, I do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the,
they say, [laughter] but it's fun.

B.76:  Right.  Right.

A.77:  You know, so, yeah,

B.78:  Well [sigh],

A.79:  I like to be entertained, I really do [laughter].

B.80:  Yeah.  I watch it for entertainment, but I also watch it for, uh, cultural
impact.  I do a lot of channel thirteen, channel three, some of the
educational channels, and I watch for special programs that have special, a
special play, a special concert, uh, I recently watched a tribute to three of
the finest opera stars.

A.81:  Oh, now that was fabulous,

B.82:  Uh, and it was fabulous.

A.83:  and that, you know,

B.84:  I was just absolutely, 

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  you just held you breath,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  in some of those.  ((  )) and, uh, 

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  oh, I was just, it makes chills all,

A.91:  I know.

B.92:  over you.  #So,#

A.93:  #So,#

B.94:  I, I may or may not even look at the T V guide, but if I have time I may
flip through and say hey this looks good if I finish this task I can watch
that in an hour. [inhaling] Uh, if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to
watch it, so what.

A.95:  You know, well, there's certain thin-, I mean,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  I have got, um, my T V in the kitchen here and, 

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  uh, you know, if there's something like cooking shows.  I love to watch
cooking shows.  I, I really do.

B.100:  [Noise] [swallowing] {sounds like she is drinking something} I do too, it
makes me want to cook,

A.101:  I know [laughter],

B.102:  and then I eat,

A.103:  [Laughter].

B.104:  and then I get fat, so, I just let other people watch [laughter]

A.105:  I, I, yeah.

B.106:  then I eat what they cook [/laughter].

A.107:  And, and there's some, um, in fact, one of the water color shows, I know,
has inspired me to take water color lessons, you know.

B.108:  Oh, I think that's,

A.109:  So,

B.110:  marvelous.

A.111:  you know, 

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  things like that, you get,

B.114:  Oh, yeah, I took #a lot of my,#

A.115:  #a whole lot of exposure.#

B.116:  college courses, I took some of my,

A.117:  (( ))

B.118:  college courses on television, 

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  so that, it's very successful for some of,

A.121:  Oh.

B.122:  those things, but I think [inhaling] I really got stung very badly about
having influence in your life, or at least I saw a very bad example of having
television influence your life, uh, [sigh] my husband had an aunt who was
addicted to soaps,

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous,
contrary old [laughter] woman [laughter] ever walked.

A.125:  [Laughter] She got you a (( )) [laughter].

B.126:  Absolutely, 

A.127:  [Laughter].

B.128:  I do not know who she thought she was, but she just got to the point
where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in
her voice,

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  and that attitude being demonstrated.  [inhaling] And for her to miss a
soap, it was a big withdrawal.

A.131:  Oh, well, see that's,

B.132:  And,

A.133:  But she was probably depressed to begin with.

B.134:  Well, I do not know.

A.135:  You know what I mean?

B.136:  Well, she was grumpy to begin with.

A.137:  Yeah, grumpy to begin with. [laughter] Yeah.

B.138:  There's no doubt about that, but, uh, but you could clearly see those
influences,

A.139:  Uh-huh.

B.140:  and in my youngsters, I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were
watching THE THREE STOOGES, and I always thought that was just casual slap
stick,

A.141:  I hate that show [laughter].

B.142:  comedy, but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I
decided that was not funny,

A.143:  Yeah.

B.144:  any more.  

A.145:  I, I,

B.146:  And, I really, 

A.147:  Good.

B.148:  I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW.  I think that is,
the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.

A.149:  [Laughter].

B.150:  And I just, I do not like it.

A.151:  Is not that amazing.  How old are your kids?

B.152:  [Clinking] [swallowing] {sounds like ice against a glass, then drinking
something} Mine are grown, but I have grandchildren.

A.153:  Oh, okay, so that's, 

B.154:  And, young children around,

A.155:  Yeah.

B.156:  and, uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic
[laughter].

A.157:  I had forgotten about that, see, it's just my husband and I and,

B.158:  Uh-huh.

A.159:  so I do not have that, you know, I, that constant influence,

B.160:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.161:  of the kids shows and all that,

B.162:  Yeah, yeah.

A.163:  but, uh, um, I don't know.

B.164:  Well, I was very careful even when my kids were,

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  kids were at home.  And when they were young I was, really did, uh, watch
what they watched.  I was cau-, I sat down with them and I watched it, and if
I did not like it, I changed the channel for them.  You know,

A.167:  [Laughter] Right.

B.168:  I, you know, I distracted them, changed their interest.

A.169:  Right.

B.170:  Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos.  I
just wou-, 

A.171:  And, and you know we get it at school, too, anyway, so you might as well
not,

B.172:  Sure.

A.173:  reinforce it [laughter], 

B.174:  That's right, that's right.  

A.175:  you know.

B.176:  Gosh, they got, they are mouthy enough anyway.  

A.177:  I know, I remember going to sch-, my parents were a lot like, too and of
course,

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  we did not have any of the variety, you know, kids have,

B.180:  Uh-huh.

A.181:  but, all the watch RAWHIDE and all those shows.

B.182:  Uh-huh.

A.183:  And, my parents never let me watch anything like that.  I could watch YOGI
BEAR, you know,

B.184:  Uh-huh.

A.185:  what kind of culture was that [laughter]?

B.186:  Yeah well,

A.187:  And, I remember going to school the next day and everybody would be asking,
oh, did you see that,

B.188:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.189:  did you see how he did that and did you see, and I could never
participate.

B.190:  Uh-huh.

A.191:  And it always made me feel a little bit, you know, a loner like I, you 
know, 

B.192:  [Noise] Sure, I can,

A.193:  But, uh, 

B.194:  understand how that would happen.

A.195:  But see, then my parents, I think then you have to replace it with other
things.

B.196:  Absolutely, well, I did,

A.197:  You know, to, uh,

B.198:  I ran my kids to death [laughter].

A.199:  [Laughter].  

B.200:  I said, hey, I think that's enough television for awhile,

A.201:  Really.

B.202:  maybe we need to go outside,

A.203:  Yeah.

B.204:  and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company.  So I would go out
with them, now see there's the problem, parents do not do that.  They,

A.205:  That's true.

B.206:  say, you go outside and play,

A.207:  Or, you go rent a video up at,

B.208:  Yeah.  I said, but,

A.209:  the store and come home and sit down and watch it.  

B.210:  but, we went on field trips and we did other things.  And I think that
was,

A.211:  Well that's, you know, that's something people do not do, well, here we are
talking on that subject, but that's, that's an interesting concept I have got
to stick in my (( )), uh,

B.212:  Of course,

A.213:  You know work with kids (( )) but, uh,.
