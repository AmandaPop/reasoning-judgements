A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  So tell me about CHINA CRY.

B.4:  Okay, CHINA CRY was basically the, the true story written by this, this
lady who had, uh, [lipsmack] was a native, a native Chinese, uh, uh, who was
raised by Christian parents.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.

A.7:  I see.  

B.8:  Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any
of the other, uh, Christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance,
baptisms, et cetera, et cetera.  She had always felt a very strong, uh,
leaning in this direction.  And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen
forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their, all the
clergy and so forth were killed or, or imprisoned or, and the property
confiscated, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined
the, the Christian movement.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  [Breathing] So [lipsmack], anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity,
her parents, well, her dad was a doctor and, and he was rather well, you know,
rather well to do in the old regime and the, the Chin-, the commu-, the
communist Chinese didn't like this at all.  You know, the bourgeoisie was,
was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.

A.11:  Right.  

B.12:  Everybody was back to a commonality of one.  And so they kept picking at
him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started picking on
her.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  And getting her to, you know, they were starting to, uh, accuse her of, of,
of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her
write her own story over and over and over.  Uh, [breathing] and the, uh, the
major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this
Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court.  Now, I
think I'm leaving out a portion.  She gr-, she went through college and
graduated very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an
instructor and they had her teaching, or were starting to have her teach
history for the soldiers.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  When the, they decided that, that she needed to start recanting of all of
her pre, uh, [breathing] regime crimes as it were.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  [Throat_clearing] Being a child, you know.  So, they kept on and on at,
at her, and in the meantime, she and her husband, uh, were ex-, ex-, were
expecting a child, their own child.  And, uh, the, the people kept harassing
her over, you know, over a period of months and finally they, uh, carried her,
uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through
the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing
her by firing squad.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  And, uh, the Lord just said no, this is not going to happen even though
this lady has not really, you know, she's, she's one of mine, she is not going
to die and, uh, the, the soldiers were blinded when they shot.

A.21:  Huh.  

B.22:  And she, her life was spared.  And this, this frightened the, the, uh, the
commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the
labor camp.

A.23:  Huh.  

B.24:  Well, uh, and, course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child
dragging rocks around.

A.25:  Huh.  

B.26:  Well she, she put in for going, going to, uh, and her husband had escaped
to Hong Kong, uh, and then she put in to go see him.  And over time she, uh,
uh, finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough
different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureauc-,
bureaucracy that they finally let her go.

A.27:  Huh.  

B.28:  And, of course, she had to walk.  You know, they, they stripped her of
everything, practically besides the, the clothes on her back.  And, uh, so
she, so she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child
that they'd already had --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- uh, to freedom.

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  And they knew that she wasn't going to come back, but yeah, she did, years
later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- liberalization of China happened, and, uh, she was not persecuted or
anything else like that.

A.35:  Huh.  Interesting story.

B.36:  Yes, it was.  Uh, very moving, too.

A.37:  I, uh, I don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably
here and gone fairly quickly.

B.38:  Well, it was within, oh, ninety days.

A.39:  Oh. That recent.

B.40:  Yeah.  No, I mean it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about
ninety days.

A.41:  Oh, I see what you mean.

B.42:  But it wasn't, uh, they didn't have it in, uh, too awfully many movie
houses, but it was, it was, in the, it had large, uh, uh, uh, [lipsmack] press
release.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  Well, uh, I guess what I, what I saw most recently and luckily I
saw it only a week ago [laughter] so I'd remember --

B.44:  Okay.

A.45:  -- remember it well was, uh, sort of light by comparison.  

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  Uh, my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy and, and, uh,
we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.

B.48:  GREEN CARD?  

A.49:  GREEN CARD.  

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  And, uh, he chose it and, uh, it's got this wonderful French actor who's,
it was his, like, his, and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor
who we've enjoyed for years, but he's never made an American film.  This was
his American film debut --

B.52:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- and he speaks very broken English.  And basically he played, uh, a
Frenchman who married an American girl, uh, in a marriage of convenience --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- so that he could get his green card, which is what an alien needs to
work in this country.

B.56:  Right, uh-huh.  

A.57:  And, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an
apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a
garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  So she was a horticulturist, and that was sort of her dream. 

B.60:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.  

A.61:  Of course, you know, they got married and they never saw each other again.

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  Except, except fate through them together and the Immigration and
national-, Naturalization Service, uh, started investigating.  So they had to
get back together and get their stories straight,

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  [Laughter] and, and she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New
Yorker --

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  -- and he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets
and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,
but there was no proof whatsoever [noise] that he really was.

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.  

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  [Lipsmack] And, uh, they had to learn all about each other basically --

B.72:  Just then.

A.73:  -- in a, in a weekend.  And, uh, it was, you knew what was going to happen,
of course.

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  That they would fall in love.  Well, they fell into like, at any rate 
and --

B.76:  Right, uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever, uh,
[lipsmack] they did perfectly and then he said something, because his English
was so poor on, for the most part, he, he was so proud of himself for giving
ex-, all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, I never
remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a
series of answers.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  So, uh,
