============================================================================

B.1:  #Okay, so.#

A.2:  #Okay,# we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.

B.3:  Right. What --

A.4:  Okay --

B.5:  -- what,

A.6:  -- um, where do you work at or --

B.7:  Uh. 

A.8:  -- do you, you wish to discuss that?

B.9:  No, I, I'm in, uh, well I live in, uh, Richardson, 

A.10:  Oh, #okay.#

B.11:  #Texas,# and, uh,

A.12:  Yeah, we're neighbors.

B.13:  Yeah.

A.14:  Okay [laughter].

B.15:  And, uh, but grew up in, uh, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different
philosophy in terms of [laughter] lawn and garden --

A.16:  Hi [talking] {talking to someone in background}.

B.17:  -- work.  Uh, and uh, 

A.18:  Can you hang on just a minute?

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  Thank you [talking] {Talking to someone else in background}.  I have no
idea.  He didn't broadcast.  Thank you.  Uh-huh.  I'm sorry.

B.21:  No.

A.22:  Go ahead.

@B.23:  So, uh, [lipsmack] uh, not, not growing up familiar with here, uh, uh,
when I get a chance I listen to that Neil #Sperry and do that [laughter].#

A.24:  #[Noise] Oh, I do all the time.#  #I do all the time.#

B.25:  #And, uh,# 

A.26:  I get a lot of good tips from him.

B.27:  Yeah.  #Uh,# 

A.28:  #I have his book,# too.

B.29:  Yeah?

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  Don't do any, uh,

A.32:  [Swallowing].

B.33:  any gardening in the sense of, uh, vegetable gardening but, uh,

A.34:  Not in #Texas.#

B.35:  #Tr-, tr-,# tried some, tried some different, 

A.36:  [Laughter].

B.37:  flowers, and, and, uh, bushes and stuff,

A.38:  [Noise]. 

B.39:  and, uh, uh, have a, have a lawn service.  There was one when,

A.40:  [Swallowing].

B.41:  we, when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long
time and then switched to a different one, but in terms of the fertilizing
and, uh, 

A.42:  [Noise] {Paper shuffling}.

B.43:  weed control,

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  mainly leave that up to them.  What about you?

A.46:  Well, no, I had a lawn service one year, and I thought phooey, I'm going to
do it myself because I figured up the cost and I said, #huh-uh [noise],#

B.47:  #Yeah.#

A.48:  I can do it much #cheaper and better.#

B.49:  #Yeah.#

A.50:  And so what I did, I switched to liquid, and I do it with an applicator
with my hose, and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and
#walking all over# --

B.51:  #[Noise] Yeah.# 

A.52:  -- the territory.

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  I was surprised how easy it was.

B.55:  Well [noise] {Sounds like eating something}.

A.56:  And, i-, I thought, well, I'm going to do this all the time.

B.57:  Well, good.

A.58:  So I found, you know, and I've got some problems with, uh, two trees in my
front yard, and I took them to a certified, uh, nurseryman the other day,

B.59:  #Yeah.#

A.60:  #and do# you know what he told me I h-, needed to do?  

B.61:  #No.#

A.62:  #Which is,# a-, [laughter] it's just unreal.  He said I needed to pull
every leave off the tree, and the tree is fifteen feet high, and it probably
has about ten thousand leaves on it and he told me I needed to pull every leaf
off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase.

B.63:  [Laughter].

A.64:  And I thought, uh-huh, [laughter] this is, this is unreal, this is
#unreal.#

B.65:  #Yeah.#

A.66:  So, uh, I think I'll get my son-in-law [laughter] to do that for me, if he
will.

B.67:  Yeah [laughter].  What, what, what kind of a, is this some sort of a
disease, or is #it a pest?#

A.68:  #Yes,# it's a disease that it's got, and I don't know,

B.69:  What,

A.70:  what happened to it, uh, and #then it# --

B.71:  #Well, what kind# --

A.72:  -- it, um [lipsmack],

B.73:  -- what kind of trees are they?

A.74:  Well, one is a  maple, one is, um [lipsmack],

B.75:  Huh.

A.76:  a maple, but I would much prefer, I think it's not a native Texan tree.

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  And, uh, the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are
on the city property, and they don't,

B.79:  [Laughter].

A.80:  get any care, 

B.81:  #Uh-huh.#

A.82:  #and they're# cedar elm, and they're just beautiful.

B.83:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.84:  So I mean, it, it's, you know, these things that you pamper, some people
have really a green thumb, and, you know,

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  and, um, although I don't have too serious a problem, but, I don't know if
it was from the, the, the late freezes that were, or the early freezes we had,
that caused this tree damage, and you know, Sperry said, you know, that's what
happened to the Crepe Myrtles,

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  the last two years that, you, we are looking at all the freeze damage from
the prior two years.

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  So, I kind of think that maybe that, uh, happened to these large trees that
I have.

B.91:  Yeah.

A.92:  And I really hate to lose them, but, um, [lipsmack] that's one of the
hazards I guess of, uh, having a, a yard.

B.93:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.94:  #Because I,# 

B.95:  Well, that's, that's one thing that we a-, we've had very poor luck with,
with, is, in, in our yard is, is trees --

A.96:  #Uh-huh.#

B.97:  -- #but# the, uh, [noise] what, what trees were, were there when we moved
in,

A.98:  [Noise] {sounds like a train whistle}.

B.99:  uh, uh, were, had been put in by the developer when he built the house, and
he just put in whatever was cheapest [noise] that he could #claim was a tree I
think.#

A.100:  #Right, the quick growing, yeah, and they, and he,#

B.101:  And, uh, figured [noise] up last night, at, there were seven different
trees of, of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in, and we got
one left at this point, but, [sigh] uh, a couple of them we've lost to, [sigh]
the, w-, weren't too good trees, we've lost to wind, #uh, uh.#

A.102:  #Uh, uh-huh# [breathing].

B.103:  Three we, three we've lost to, to, uh, freezes between, uh, eighty-three
and uh, and then, uh, a year ago we lost, uh, #another one.#

A.104:  #[Lipsmack] Can I pick your brain# about how you got rid of those trees?
Did, are they still there, did you cut them down at the, at the ground level,
or did you pull them,

B.105:  [Breathing].

A.106:  up by the roots, or how did you get rid of them? #Because if I# --

B.107:  #Well, d-,# 

A.108:  -- I, I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a
circumference of about ten inches, #and,#

B.109:  #Yeah,# we-, we didn't ha-, we didn't have any that were that,

A.110:  Oh.

B.111:  that big when they, uh, went. two o-, two of them, uh, [laughter] the wind,
the wind blew over [lipsmack] --

A.112:  Uh.

B.113:  -- uh, in, in terms of getting them down.

A.114:  Uh-huh.

B.115:  Uh [lipsmack] --

A.116:  Because I don't #want# --

B.117:  -- #the,#

A.118:  -- stubs in my lawn.  #Because# --

B.119:  #Yeah.#

A.120:  -- #you still have to [music],#

B.121:  #Yeah.# Now th-, the one that, the one that we lost, the last one that we
lost a, a year ago --

A.122:  #Uh-huh.#

B.123:  -- #uh,# u-, up until then, they do-, hadn't been big enough but what I
just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, at,

A.124:  #The base?#

B.125:  #as close,# 

A.126:  #To the ground?#

B.127:  #close to ground# level as I could,

A.128:  Uh-huh.

B.129:  and then, uh, #got s-,#

A.130:  #Bore?#

B.131:  got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps [noise],

A.132:  I see --

B.133:  #helps rot the,#

A.134:  -- #tr-, uh,# a stump killer.

B.135:  stump ki-, yeah,

A.136:  Yeah.

B.137:  stump killer, and stump, stump rotter,

A.138:  Uh-huh.

B.139:  But, uh, this last one had a fair sized root and some guy was doing a job
in the neighborhood, uh, and, and saw it and stopped in and asked,

A.140:  [Swallowing].

B.141:  if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks, and I
said fine.  He had, he had a trailer with a machine on it that was
specifically for that, #and it# --

A.142:  #Yeah,# and they get that saw, and I think it's a, k-, some kind of a s-, a
screwing thing that #just rips it right out.#

B.143:  -- #yeah, and it, it just,# it just ripped it --

A.144:  Right out, yeah.

B.145:  -- right out, and, uh, I [lipsmack] took the, i-, it left the, it left, he
left the chips, and I #put them up# --

A.146:  #Used those for,# uh, #mulch, sure.#

B.147:  -- #mulch ar-, around,# around the other shrubs, 

A.148:  Sure.

B.149:  and, uh, uh, had, had a pile of dirt from various things, uh, back by the
garage that I filled in with and,

A.150:  Uh-huh.

B.151:  and it's filling in with, with grass, uh, nicely this year, so that, that
was, that was worth it but, uh,

A.152:  A blessing in disguise.  

B.153:  Yeah.

A.154:  I mean, y-, two fold purpose.  Yeah.

B.155:  Yeah but, uh, [sigh].  Yeah, well y-, do you do your own, uh, 

A.156:  #Lawn? Yes, Uh-huh.#

B.157:  #lawn in terms of,# uh, mowing?

A.158:  Yes, I have a, I have a self-propelled, uh, Snapper.

B.159:  Yeah.

A.160:  [Beep] Because I'm sitting on a hill, and it, uh,

B.161:  Oh, yeah.

A.162:  and it's very difficult to address.

B.163:  Yeah, I, uh, yeah, I, I, I, we just got a, a old push, uh, uh, Sears mower.
I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it,
and I keep waiting for it to die, but, every year it just seems to hang on,
and, uh, [lipsmack] and, uh, I do it #my, do it myself.#

A.164:  #Well, that's good [laughter].#  They're very expensive.

B.165:  But, uh, yeah, we-, [laughter], a year, a year ago I took into,

A.166:  [Noise] {Paper shuffling}.

B.167:  took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said, no,
it's, it's too old, we won't even work on it.  

A.168:  Oh, ((booey)) yeah.

B.169:  And I took it back home, and it's, [laughter] #can't, kept, plugs along.
But, uh,#

A.170:  #Yeah, they always try to give you a song and dance.#

B.171:  But, my son's, uh, o-, one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year
have {voices fade},
