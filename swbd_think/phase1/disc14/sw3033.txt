=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, good morning and, uh, I guess the topic here is going to be
hobbies,

B.2:  Right.  

A.3:  and if you have any just tell me what they are.  

@B.4:  Well, right now the main thing that I've been doing craft wise anyway is,
uh, I make earrings out of paper and buttons and I do sweatshirts and, um,

A.5:  Really?

B.6:  Yes.  How about you?  

A.7:  Oh, that sounds fascinating.  Um, well, I'm, I'm pretty traditional.  I've,
I've been doing, um, a little bit of quilting, and, uh, I made my first quilt
ever.  I mean it's wonderful, it's beautiful.  I don't know if there will be a
second one,

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  but the first one is, you know, hand pieced and hand sewn, and it took
months upon months to do this.  Anyway, um, there's that and then, uh, now I,
I've developed an interest in watercolor.  So I'm taking some classes over at
Michael's, and I'm trying to, uh, make it look good [laughter].

B.10:  That sounds really interesting.  My husband does, uh, painting he's been
doing in acrylics, and he wanted to do some things in watercolor.  I hear
that's one of the hardest mediums to work in however.

A.11:  I don't know that.  I just, someone gave me some paints for Christmas one
year and I said, okay, I'll try this [laughter].

B.12:  Are you pretty artistic?  

A.13:  I guess I am.  I'm, I've, I've been sort of painting stuff and people say,
why don't you let me hang that in my room, you know.  So I've got stuff
hanging in people's houses that I look at now and I go, oh, I can do so much
better than that.

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  So I guess I've, you know, developed somewhere along the line, but, um, you
know, it's, it's an interesting thing and I really do like it.  It's real
peaceful.  It's real quiet, you know [laughter].

B.16:  Well, to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be the hardest to
stick with because it is so time-consuming.

A.17:  It is.  It's amazing.  The results are incredible.  

B.18:  Have you thought about selling them?  

A.19:  Um, no, because I can't get beyond making this first quilt. 

B.20:  Oh [laughter].

A.21:  I'm afraid [laughter] if I make another one, I'm keeping it, you know
[laughter].  The watercolor I can dash off in twenty minutes and that's, you
know, it's finished.  But, um, yeah, the quilting, forget it.  Um, I would
even join a quilting group maybe to help somebody else finish their quilt sort
of thing.

B.22:  Well, you know, what I've kind of been looking for, I sew, not as much as I
used to but, uh, I have scraps of fabric and I thought it be nice if I could
find, you know, maybe, uh, in a senior citizens home or something to give the
pieces to maybe these people could use a lit-, bits of, uh, you know --

A.23:  You're right.  

B.24:  -- leftover fabric.  

A.25:  Yeah.  They love that.  That would be good.  Really, and, uh,

B.26:  All you have to do is figure out how to get ahold of some of these people.

A.27:  Yeah.  I, yeah, I'm finding out that, um, there, there are an awful lot of
quilters out there and, and it's not just traditional quilting either.  People
hav-, you know, are using it for making clothes.

B.28:  Huh.  

A.29:  They have, they make, they call them crazy quilts.  

B.30:  Like the vests or something?

A.31:  The vests and things like that, and they make whole outfits out of, you
know, scraps of this and that.  And that's getting to be a real art form what
you wear on your back, so [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  You know [laughter].  Maybe you'd like to try it [laughter].  Um, but I
think it's great that we have the availability here to, you know, um, like
Michael's.  And, and be able to be trained and, and do some things like that.
So that's a lot of fun.  I,

B.34:  Well, I was looking into, uh, I wanted to take a flower arranging class,

A.35:  Oh.   

B.36:  and I called, I think I called Michael's and Zak's both.  And as it
turned out the month that I called, they didn't have anything.  And then I
didn't call back.

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  But I think it be nice to learn how to arrange silk flowers and, uh,

A.39:  Oh, sure.  

B.40:  save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements. 

A.41:  Oh, absolutely.  And I just, I love flowers.  I, [laughter] you know, I got
to have flowers around me,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  you know, kind of thing.  Um, but the button thing, now that sounds
really interesting.  You make earrings.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Some of them I'll just, uh, well, years ago when I was sewing
quite a bit, I found a place that you could buy bags of buttons.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  You know, assorted buttons.  And, oh, sometimes you got ten of a kind
sometimes you got one of a kind, but anyway I decided when I started making
paper earrings maybe I'd branch out a little bit, and I got out my button
collection and there were a lot of things in there that I could make
particularly the metal ones.  You know, I could just put backs on them.

A.47:  Oh, right.  

B.48:  Um, I'd have to clip off the, uh, shanks and all.  But then some of them
after I ran out of that I just started painting them with my, uh, sweatshirt
paints.  And, you know, making things to match my outfits.

A.49:  Oh, how clever.  

B.50:  So I've been having a good time with that.  

A.51:  Right.  My, my sister-in-law up, uh, in Illinois she was, well, in a real
rural area and she's starting to collect antique buttons, and she makes ((big
cage)) pins out of them.  And these big wooden buttons --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- are just k-, um, you know, they're all sort of layered and put together
and glued in back and everything, but they are just incredible.  They're so
pretty.

B.54:  Well, a friend of mine s-, uh, had a pin that was made out of antique
buttons,

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  and the thing was just gorgeous.  

A.57:  And it's, they're all wooden buttons.  It's really neat.  And she says
everybody up there wears buttons on their socks.

B.58:  Oh, really?  

A.59:  Yeah, they just, you know, um, do some artistic thing with the buttons and
I don't know if they hot glue them on or whatever but,

B.60:  I guess that hasn't hit in Dallas yet.  I haven't seen any of that
[laughter].

A.61:  Yeah, I know [laughter].  This is, this is mid-state Illinois I don't know
how long it will take if it ever gets here, [laughter] you know.  But that's
what they're doing with buttons down, or up there.  But that's really neat.
I, I, uh, [lipsmack] and, and you do the painting on the T-shirts too,

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  the sweatshirts?  

B.64:  Well, that's what we did for Christmas as a matter of fact for all our
friends and family.  We gave them the hand painted sweatshirts and thank
goodness my husband helped me with it.

A.65:  Oh.  

B.66:  Because I think I had about fourteen to do.  

A.67:  Oh, there [laughter] you are.  

B.68:  And, uh, ((I got)), I'll, I'll either be working on this constantly or I'm
never going to have these finished by Christmas.  But they really did turn out
pretty.  I was really pleased with them.

A.69:  What kind of medium do you use on them?  Or do you like glitter and
painting scenes and,

B.70:  Uh, I usually use a transfer.  We've done some southwest things and, uh,
I've done some flowers, but I haven't gotten so far as to do, oh, you know,
some of the little pin on,

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  uh, bows and everything.  It's strictly been painting so far, 

A.73:  Oh, ((well, sure)).  

B.74:  but I'll use, um, I did use some glitter paint on a Christmas one.  And
some in-, some of the metallic paints.

A.75:  Oh.

B.76:  And you know each time I do one, I try something a little bit different.

A.77:  Oh, well, see that's, that's really neat.  That's a great outlet.

B.78:  The only problem is I've done so many I don't know when I want to touch
another sweatshirt again [laughter].

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  Well, Christmas is only six months away now [laughter].

B.82:  Oh, I know I better get started, right?  [Laughter].

A.83:  Right.  I, [laughter] the year goes so fast it's, 

B.84:  [Laughter]. 

A.85:  [Laughter] an incredible thing.  Well, I'm sure we enjoyed talking to you
today, and,

B.86:  Well, thanks for calling.

A.87:  uh, I think this is great and keep on with those sweatshirts [laughter].

B.88:  Well, it's fun.  You get other people's ideas on things too.

A.89:  Really, that's true.  Well,

B.90:  Have a good weekend.  

A.91:  You too.  #Bye-bye, now.# 

B.92:  #Bye-bye.#
