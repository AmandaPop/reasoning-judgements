REMARKS:        B laughed a lot all through the conversation.  Frequently
the words were difficult to distinguish because both speakers were
laughing so much.

=========================================================================

@A.1:  So what magazines do you subscribe to?

B.2:  Uh, ((the only one)) I subscribe to.  Well, I did subscribe to two, I
subscribe to INC at the office.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And then I get COSMOPOLITAN at home [laughter].

A.5:  Oh, that's kind of fun [/laughter].

B.6:  Yeah, it gives me a little variety anyway.

A.7:  Yeah (( )) well that's kind of fun.  Well we have like every magazine in
the world.  My dad is kind of a chronic magazine subscriber.

B.8:  Oh, really.

A.9:  He gets, uh, oh gosh, BIRD WATCHER DIGEST, and,

B.10:  Wow.

A.11:  I mean, just almost anything, any interest he ever has, for like a week
he will subscribe to the magazine of it.

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  So we have got every magazine that that there is.  And then I get, uh, NEW
YORKER, because I like the, the literature in it.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  And, uh, uh, I read NEWSWEEK and U S NEWS.  

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I like NEWSWEEK.

B.18:  Yeah, they are always real interesting.  I remember even in high school,
that was one of our assignments to read, NEWSWEEK.  And I,

A.19:  Oh [laughter].

B.20:  kind of got hooked on it.  Then,

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  and then, through college then, I kind of had too many other things going
on.

A.23:  Yeah, I understand.

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  When I first got in college, my dad set up subscriptions for all these
magazines, cause he could get them at the student cheap rate.

B.26:  Oh wow.

A.27:  We had tons of magazines [laughter].

B.28:  That's neat, well do you spend a lot of time reading them, or do you just
pick out what you want.

A.29:  I, uh, pick out what I want, usually.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  Read a-, [laughter] read those cartoons in the NEW YORKER,

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  read the little synopsis, find out who died in NEWSWEEK,

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  and look at like, celebrity pictures.  And I'm not the best informed
person, I guess (( )).

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  Uh, you know, if there is a news name that you don't know, you can flip
through the NEWSWEEK and try to find who it is.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  That is a little bit helpful.

B.40:  Oh, that's neat.  Well, um, I read the INC magazine mainly for my company.
My company is not my company personally, #obviously,#

A.41:  #Uh-huh.#

B.42:  but, uh, we have been selected as INC's top five-hundred for the last two,

A.43:  Oh, that's,

B.44:  years.

A.45:  great.

B.46:  Yeah, so it's really, it's exciting to see your name in print and,

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  then they do. Um, the other things that I read are kind of, they are all
computer related, because that's what my company is about.

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  But, uh, [sigh] they are not really magazines.  They are periodicals, but I
do not know if they would really qualify as magazines.  I guess so, because
they have advertising and news,

A.51:  Right, are they like,

B.52:  print.

A.53:  P C WORLD or,

B.54:  Yeah, that, stuff.

A.55:  beyond that.

B.56:  And MAINFRAME JOURNAL, and,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  COMPUTER WORLD, all that boring stuff.

A.59:  Right, I know.

B.60:  But it's stuff you got to keep up with or else you,

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  you start falling behind.

A.63:  That sounds good.

B.64:  Yeah, it's real funny because my husband, um, gives me trouble still
[noise] about getting COSMOPOLITAN, and,

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  because that's mainly, or not mainly, but I think he thinks as it as more
of a single girl's magazine type of thing.  And I am like, well, I am going to
get this until I start getting, like, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS [Laughter].

A.67:  Really, until you start getting those old magazines (( )) --

B.68:  Yeah, I can not see that.

A.69:  -- RETIREMENT DIGEST.

B.70:  Yeah [laughter].

A.71:  ((I said)) I'll keep subscribing to a magazine until I started wanting to
get READER'S DIGEST,

B.72:  Yeah, #that.#

A.73:  #And then at# that point, if you just cut it off.

B.74:  And PARENTHOOD and [laughter],

A.75:  Really, and GOLF DIGEST (( )) [laughter].

B.76:  [Laughter] Yeah, really.

A.77:  These are the bad signs.

B.78:  I can not see any of those.

A.79:  So, I do not know, we, I do not what we do all the magazines.  We just
probably #(( )),#

B.80:  #Recycle them.#

A.81:  Well, we do, we take them to the library and --

B.82:  Oh, really.

A.83:  -- they sell them there.  You can not recycle the shiny,

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  paper of the magazine.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  So we recycle everything but the paper of the magazines go back to the
library and they resell them.  Which I can not imagine who would want, like
back issue of NEWSWEEK, but --

B.88:  Well.

A.89:  -- I guess there are maybe people in the world.

B.90:  All those people doing all that research.

A.91:  That's right, people can get them and their children do craft projects.

B.92:  [Laughter]. 

A.93:  Cut the pictures out and,

B.94:  Well, when I, was doing some research for a ((product)) I was doing at the
office and I went to the library and read the magazines on the microfiche,
which,

A.95:  Oh.

B.96:  was really pretty neat.

A.97:  Which is ((bad,)) I do not like those microfiche, I, I, we had, this last
year of school I, my last paper of college and I am writing, [laughter] this
paper on Bette Midler, I ((was)) decided I was not going to be very academic,

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  finally, and, uh, you had to look through all these old periodicals and
use microfiche and I just got seasick, the little,

B.100:  Oh yeah.

A.101:  things zipping by your face.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  I just thought I was going to throw up,

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  right there in the library.

B.106:  [/Laughter].

A.107:  It was not a good day.

B.108:  Well --

A.109:  So,

B.110:  -- I guess I went slow enough that it did not make me nauseous [laughter].

A.111:  Yeah, well they have, like ((the, the)) automated machines now you just
press the button and the,

B.112:  Oh, and it #moves.#

A.113:  #words# just go zipping by and ...

B.114:  Oh, yeah, I do not think I could deal with that.

A.115:  It, it's bad ((huh)).

B.116:  But it was really neat, cause I was doing this project I had to the
AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS which, you know, I had never even knew that magazine
existed.

A.117:  Right. 

B.118:  But, it had some really neat stuff in it.

A.119:  Yeah, that's, um, we get a lot of demographics stuff at school (( )).

B.120:  Huh.  I was amazed, I did not know that kind of magazine was even out
there.

A.121:  I know, it's something you never thought you would care about.  ((There is
perhaps a)) magazine for every interest,

B.122:  Yeah.  #Cause even,#

A.123:  #in the world.#

B.124:  like in the grocery store, you know, I do not ever go over and look at the
magazines, but I was getting some pictures developed at the grocery store,

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  and it was taking longer so [noise] I was hanging out over there and
[sigh] I was amazed at the different kinds.

A.127:  Yeah, there is ((it's)) a lot out there.  We have MODERN MATURITY, that was
the worse.

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  Mom and dad, dad turned fifty, so we got MODERN MATURITY, [sigh] like this
is not good. [/laughter] It has, like, these health tips and,

B.130:  Oh, really.

A.131:  ways to fix prunes,

B.132:  Oh, god [laughter].

A.133:  [Laughter] what a good magazine [laughter].

B.134:  [Laughter]  Oh, that would be awful.

A.135:  So, yeah, and so we are, 

B.136:  I do not know what my parents get, I think my dad is retired, Army, so I
know that they get something along those lines.

A.137:  Right.

B.138:  But, and he is real big into genealogy, but I don't know if there is any
genealogy magazines.

A.139:  Oh, no doubt there is. I am sure,

B.140:  #Really. Yeah [laughter],# 

A.141:  #I am sure of it.#

B.142:  well that is probably true.  I had not thought about that.

A.143:  ((Yes)) I never knew all the specific things,

B.144:  [Laughter].

A.145:  they had in magazines.

B.146:  Yeah, they are fun though, I mean, at least it kills time while you are at
the doctor's office [laughter].

A.147:  Oh, really.  [laughter] (( )) [/laughter] the word find in ((HIGH LIGHT))
magazine.

B.148:  Oh, yeah.  I was real surprised though my doctor carries tons of magazines.
I mean, he has like TENNIS WORLD, and I mean, that's it normally, I mean,
doctor's usually have U S NEWS or ((WORLD)) REPORT and PEOPLE MAGAZINE and
that is about it.

A.149:  My doctors have the worst magazines.

B.150:  Really.

A.151:  ((I have)) to change doctors.

B.152:  Do you want my doctor's name? [laughter].

A.153:  ((Remind me to get that)) [/laughter]

B.154:  Well, I mean, if you get many at home you probably would not #want.#

A.155:  #I know# and we are not at any loss for reading material here,

B.156:  [Laughter].

A.157:  you, pretty much you can read like table of contents before the next one
comes.

B.158:  Yeah.

A.159:  And then, 

B.160:  Yeah, I bet you are, 

A.161:  There is like a big pile.  These are the magazines we are going to read,

B.162:  [Laughter].

A.163:  sometime.  

B.164:  [Laughter]. 

A.165:  And so it's,

B.166:  Yeah, your mailman is probably not real happy with you all, huh.

A.167:  No, I, uh, no.

B.168:  [Laughter].

A.169:  But, (( )) we have this jumbo truck that comes by our house to,

B.170:  [Sigh] Uh.

A.171:  drop off the mail.

B.172:  Oh, wow.

A.173:  It's a mess.

B.174:  [Laughter].

A.175:  That's okay, we keep the [noise] magazine publishers in business.

B.176:  Yeah, really.

A.177:  In the midst of the recession we are,

B.178:  [Laughter].

A.179:  supporting America's publishing,

B.180:  Yeah.

A.181:  economy.

B.182:  One time a friend of mine, um, was getting the WALL STREET JOURNAL and she
was not taking the time to read it so she just had this huge pile and we were
like,

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  what are you doing, saving up for a puppy [laughter].

A.185:  (( )) [/laughter] line a bunch of bird cages --

B.186:  Yeah, really. 

A.187:  -- with that.

B.188:  Well. 

A.189:  Well, I guess that's about all on magazines.

B.190:  Okay.

A.191:  Nice talking with you.

B.192:  ((With)) you too.

A.193:  Have a good evening.

B.194:  Thanks, you too.
