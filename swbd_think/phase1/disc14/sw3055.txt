=========================================================================

A.1:  And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner
party, if we wanted to do something like that or,

B.2:  Yes, uh-huh. sure.

A.3:  share recipes or something, um.

B.4:  Right,

@A.5:  Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?

B.6:  No.

A.7:  No, nor am I. 

B.8:  [Laughter] I avoid them with all [laughter], 

A.9:  They are a lot of work, that is for sure.

B.10:  Yeah, they are, I mean I do them,

A.11:  Yes.

B.12:  but they are a lot of work.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  I usually have them when I, [sigh] there is a special event in our lives
and I,

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  I make a big deal out of it for them.

A.17:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.18:  And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  familiar foods that I know are successful.

A.21:  Right, yes.

B.22:  You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust and,

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  you know, I can make my pies from scratch, I do not need a recipe to
follow.  And, uh,

A.25:  Oh, that's great.  You sound like my mother who has been, well I bake pies
too, but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and [sigh]
she has the same, the same technique, I mean, I guess after many years of
doing it, you just,

B.26:  Yeah, #you just know from heart.#

A.27:  #kind of do it second nature.#

B.28:  I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she
said make me one, and I made her one.

A.29:  Uh.

B.30:  And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this
with anybody".  [laughter] And I thought whoa, [laughter] that was a big pie.

A.31:  She enjoyed it, huh [laughter].

B.32:  Yes [laughter].

A.33:  Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple
pies,

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  and, uh, we had a, a, [throat_clearing] an auction one time at the church
[throat_clearing] excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty
dollars [laughter].

B.36:  My word, 

A.37:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.38:  she must have a great pie recipe then.

A.39:  Well, I think I, I have had it once and it has been a few years ago, but I
do recall that it was quite good, so, uh,

B.40:  Wonderful.

A.41:  Yeah.  So, that is her specialty, uh, I like to bake, uh, also, I do not
bake so much now that my children are grown, but I do enjoy baking and I guess
I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that, that was
more my specialty,

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.43:  I suppose.  And they seem to last longer than pies around here [laughter]
pies would go practically,

B.44:  Yeah you,

A.45:  in a day's time [/laughter].

B.46:  That's right, yeah they are meant for the, that evening's,

A.47:  Yes.

B.48:  dessert and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you
know, the leftovers.

A.49:  Right [laughter]. 

B.50:  Puts about two more inches on his waistline and then #he is [laughter]
chastising,#

A.51:  #And (( )),#

B.52:  himself afterward [/laughter].

A.53:  Well, it is interesting that, yesterday, I had lunch with a friend and she
was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend,

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  for friends of hers.  For, um, uh, one of her acquaintances, one of her
old friends, I guess, had been in town and, uh, they invited two other couples
over and so there were seven of them that, uh, I said "well, what did you
have" and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food, but, you know, she
had, uh, uh, guacamole and, uh, I cannot remember all she had.  But she also
had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.  Have you ever made
that or had it?

B.56:  No, I have not, huh-uh.

A.57:  It's, uh, it's, um, I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba,
who would make it,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  uh, it's just a wonderful dessert.  It's like, uh, an egg custard in a
caramelized sugar,

B.60:  Oh, okay.

A.61:  with on top of it.  And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to
make, but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs
that are in it.

B.62:  Sure, yeah.

A.63:  But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a
couple years ago.  And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that
you get,

B.64:  Like apple pie in America, right.

A.65:  there. Yeah, uh-huh.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  Wow, uh-huh.

A.67:  It's just very customary to get flan.  So if you ever run into that
[laughter] you will sort,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  of be aware of what that is all about.  But, uh, I would never have
thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner, but, you know,
sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do
something like that.  But [throat_clearing],

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  flan is something you can,

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  make ahead and have just, you know, have ready but, uh.  Well, I would,
have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon, but I
tell you it, th-, I ((my)) it's one of those things where it does require some
real, uh, planning and,

B.74:  Yes, (( )) uh-huh.

A.75:  it's, you know, you don't just make the dinner, you have the house to
clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.

B.76:  Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the,

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  [Laughter] house clean [laughter].  

A.79:  Probably a good way to do it. [laughter] Oh, the house needs cleaning, I
guess I had better have a dinner party [laughter].

B.80:  Yeah, yeah, we are catering a wedding, uh, um, in August and,

A.81:  Oh.

B.82:  uh, this lady that is, it at, it's at her house, she is not a good
housekeeper.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  So she has got to hire this crew,

A.85:  Oh.

B.86:  of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.

A.87:  Good heavens [laughter].

B.88:  Yes, 

A.89:  [Laughter]. 

B.90:  and there, you know, she is, she must have found some jewels,

A.91:  Uh.

B.92:  because they start in the corner and work out.

A.93:  Oh, wow.  

B.94:  Yeah, so,

A.95:  That is such a nice thing, it's,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  [Sigh] I, you know, until, well we have, my husband and I have been
married twenty six years, and until last year I had never had another person
clean my house, and,

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going
to let myself have every now and then".  And so, I had a woman come in, uh,
once a month, and you know, it was ((not)) just very often, but for me it was
wonderful [laughter].

B.100:  Sure, yeah that is nice, you know, to have that, that's a,

A.101:  Well,

B.102:  luxury, today.

A.103:  it is, and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner
party, #I guess.#

B.104:  #That's# right, yeah, yeah.

A.105:  So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned, 

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  but, [sigh] well, uh, I,

B.108:  I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique,

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  that has vinegar and egg in it,

A.111:  I have heard about that.

B.112:  Have you?

A.113:  but I have never tried it.  

B.114:  (( )).

A.115:  No, well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it, I do not
know that it has egg in it.

B.116:  Egg and sugar.

A.117:  #uh-huh.#

B.118:  #Uh-huh.#

A.119:  Do you have it right on the top of you head? [laughter].

B.120:  Uh, I, no, I think it would be too hazy, because, um, the, I, uh, no.

A.121:  You do not have it, yeah.  ((I would)),

B.122:  Well, it, like the liquid is like,

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of
vinegar,

A.125:  Right.

B.126:  and you mix that together and then you, [sigh] you know, your, see it
makes, it makes, uh, five pie crusts at once.

A.127:  Uh, quite large, yeah.

B.128:  So, that, it's quite a volume of,

A.129:  Right.

B.130:  I think it's four cups of floor,

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  and, like, uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and,

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  and you combine your dry ingredients and then you, uh, put in your
liquid.

A.135:  Yeah.  Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes,

B.136:  It just,

A.137:  the crust better.

B.138:  it just makes it very pliable and,

A.139:  Uh.

B.140:  and very flaky,

A.141:  Interesting.

B.142:  and, [sigh] you can really treat it rough and you are still going to have
a flaky pie crust.

A.143:  Yeah, yeah, boy, that, that's the real secret.

B.144:  Like, uh, it's not mine, it was from the, one of the magazines, probably,
[sigh] twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step
on it and,

A.145:  [Laughter]. 

B.146:  it will still be flaky.  I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to
make.

A.147:  Oh, th-, it makes me think of years ago, uh, when I was visiting my
mother-in-law in, uh, Michigan, she lived very near an apple orchard and we
just had, we could take as many apples as we wanted from it.  Accor-, you
know, according to the owners, and so [sigh] I decided to bake about four pies
ahead, you know,

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  and freeze them, 

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be
tough. [laughter] Those were the toughest apple crust, or apple, uh, pie
crust,

B.152:  Oh, wow.

A.153:  I have ever, ever made.

B.154:  Wow.

A.155:  It was terrible.  I, I could have used that recipe, it sounds like.

@@B.156:  [Laughter] Well, I am from Michigan.

A.157:  Where about?

B.158:  Detroit, uh-huh.

A.159:  Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years, uh,

B.160:  Oh yeah, that's real close.

A.161:  Yeah.  In fact, I, we were there from, uh, seventy three to seventy seven
and,

B.162:  Uh-huh.

A.163:  I was, I worked for the little, the weekly newspaper there, the,

B.164:  Oh, how neat.

A.165:  the Plymouth, oh what was it called, CRIER.  [sigh] And, uh, my husband
is from the upper peninsula, so he was born and,

B.166:  Oh, okay.

A.167:  raised up there.

B.168:  Uh-huh.

A.169:  That is where my mother-in-law still lives, so, uh.  Are you originally
from Michigan or,

B.170:  Oh, yes.

A.171:  Uh-huh.

B.172:  Born in Detroit.

A.173:  I will be darn.
