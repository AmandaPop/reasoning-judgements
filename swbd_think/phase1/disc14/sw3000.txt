========================================================================

A.1:  Well let's see, um, I, I like to go out to eat, I really do, but being from
Dallas, um, I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open
and close every we-, month and we ave-, we have a really high turn over rate.

B.2:  Oh, really?

A.3:  Oh yeah and, and this is, I mean there are streets just called restaurant
rows and, uh, you can get everything here from, um, a very spicy Indian meal
to, you know, the favorite barbecue and, and, uh, just anything your little
hearts desires around here, so, here they have to entertain us to make us come
back.

B.4:  # Uh.  #

A.5:  # And # I guess it's all one big game because you, you just never run out
of places to go, you really don't.

B.6:  That's good. 

A.7:  Yeah. 

B.8:  I never really thought about that, but, uh, a good turn over would be sort
of nice.  Course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else
likes it, it would be sort of sad to see it go under. 

A.9:  Really and, and we go to, you know, like an older part of town and we just
notice how many, oh well that restaurant's changed, and oh, gee, there, they've
changed and, oh, we've got to go try that one, you know, and it's, it's really,
you have the pick of the, you know, the crop here. 

B.10:  Are they big into am-, ambiance down there or is it more like,

A.11:  Oh!

B.12:  uh, Texas to me makes it seems like it would be portions would be the big
thing. 

A.13:  [Laughter]  You know, your, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and
stuff. 

B.14:  Yeah, right, uh-huh. 

A.15:  Um, you can get that too.  No, they've got everything here from the, uh,
French Room which is ultra, ultra to, um, um, Dean ((Ferrings)), uh, uh,
restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek.  I mean we've got beautiful
places to go.  You can get as dressed up or, a-, you know just going to the
local barbecue and just doing take out. 

B.16:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.17:  # So, # you know [laughter].  I guess, uh, some of the foods that we really
enjoy though are the, um, um, like Chinese,

B.18:  # Um [sniffing].  #

A.19:  # and we're # always searching around for Chinese.  And now, of course,
they've added the Taiwanese, and, and, um, uh, various, you know, any, any
part of the country you want to hit, they have got it.  I mean, Vietnamese
restaurant we went to, you know, last week.  It's great, it's good stuff, you
kno-,

B.20:  Uh-huh. 

A.21:  But, uh, it's, so it's very, very mixed and, uh, you know, I think if you
like food like we do, I, I don't know if that happened before or after we moved
here but, um,

B.22:  # Yeah.  #

A.23:  # you # know, you get a lot of, uh, great variety of things here, so.  But
if you were going to a restaurant, say, um, where would you go?

B.24:  Oh, well we had, uh, we have a lot of favorites here, uh, in Northern
Virginia and of course we've got D C to call on, you know,

A.25:  # Right.  #

B.26:  # and # there's all sorts of things down there.  One thing about D C is
that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where, you know, it's, the guy
used to be the cook for the Capitol and so he stays in the same restaurant for
twenty years, you know,

A.27:  # Oh, okay.  #

B.28:  # and he's # got a big clientele and, um, so there are, there are some hang
outs where you can go if you want to see people.  You know, it's, it's sort of
like Hollywood in a way because there's, there's favorite haunts for
Southerners and things like that.

A.29:  Oh. 

B.30:  Um, we don't hang around with them, because usually it's, you know, ninety
dollars a plate or something silly like that. 

A.31:  Yeah, right [laughter]. 

B.32:  So, uh, but, uh, my wife has a, a friend that w-, runs one of the
restaurants down there and we've been down there and had French cuisine, and,
uh, I don't know, I don't particularly care for that sort of thing, just th-,
the type of food, just because I do like, uh, you know, getting a meal. 

A.33:  # I see.  #

B.34:  # And, uh, # most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason. 

A.35:  # [Laughter].  #

B.36:  # I, # I don't know what they say about Chinese, I'm always hungry after a
French meal, uh. 

A.37:  That's true too. 

B.38:  And, uh, but the, the atmosphere is just wonderful.  You do feel like
you've gone out, you know, and done something,

A.39:  # To another place, yeah.  #

B.40:  # when you go to # a French restaurant, or a restaurant downtown.  Well as
out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied, it's
not so much a, an event, you know, out in the suburbs when you go to a local
restaurant.

A.41:  Yeah, well. 

B.42:  And there's, they're starting to get a little bit different, um, they're,
they're realizing that more of the, the people with the money are coming out
and living in the suburbs, getting away from the city and so there are a
couple jazz houses, you know, that have jazz bands playing while you're eating
and stuff like that,

A.43:  # Oh, there you go, yeah.  #

B.44:  # which is kind of nice, # because,

A.45:  Oh, we're sort of in the middle of, uh, the extension of the Cajun country
too, so we have, um, a lot of ambiance provided by, you know, the, the bands
and everyth-, you know, like you said jazz bands and things like that.  You
know,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.47:  # you # go out and you eat your crawfish and --

B.48:  Yeah right. 

A.49:  -- jambalaya and stuff.  You know, I, I really don't like that stuff but my
husband does.  He loves to cook it so,

B.50:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.51:  # he # and a friend of his get together and they cook, I mean, you know,
like for a bunch of people and, and, uh, it's really, in fact, we do a lot more
entertaining I think at home than we do going out.  So when we do go out we
really, you know, want to be wowed by, um, the presentation, so to speak. 

B.52:  Right. 

A.53:  And, uh, you know, but, but there are little places, um, and like I said,
some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants, just to,

B.54:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.55:  # and # we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around,

B.56:  # Yeah.  #

A.57:  # and # it's the fastest thing to do, and so we sort of enjoy the, you
know, both parts because,

B.58:  We have two, uh, two very special places in Northern Virginia that people
go to.  Uh, one's called Captain Pell's --

A.59:  Uh-huh. 

B.60:  -- which is a crab house,

A.61:  # Oh.  #

B.62:  # you # know, being so close to Maryland. 

A.63:  # Right.  #

B.64:  # Maryland # is, you know, a big place for crabs with the, with the bay
pretty much taking over most of Maryland. 

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  And, um, Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside,

A.67:  # [Laughter].  #

B.68:  # and # people just go in there and just pig out and everything.  And then,
um, the other place is called the Vienna Inn which is, uh, uh, Vienna is a
suburb of D C also in Virginia and, uh, that place is known for the, the rudest
waitresses in the country, are, are at the Vienna Inn. 

A.69:  # [Laughter].  #

B.70:  # And, # uh, people go there to be abused.  I mean,

A.71:  Just to be abused, by the meanest waitress [laughter]. 

B.72:  you actually go in there to be abused by the, by the waitresses and the
bartenders and stuff. 

A.73:  Oh, that's a talent. 

B.74:  And people come all over the country amazed at, um, the abuse they were
seized. 

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  And then it's on the honor system.  You pay totally on the honor system. 

A.77:  Um. 

B.78:  And so, you know, you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or
whatever and they figure out the bill for you and you're lucky if you get
change.  Usually they, they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in
your hand and say thanks, you know. 

A.79:  # [Laughter].  #

B.80:  # Because, # uh, they,

A.81:  Got to carry through with the abuse, huh. 

B.82:  Yeah, carry on with the abuse, they say you need n-, mints, here guy, you
don't get any change, you know. 

A.83:  Oh, gee.  Well that's funny, I, we just went to an Italian restaurant this,
um, just wonderful and they, I mean it's like being in It-, I mean I've never
been to Italy, okay, but it's just this big beautiful Italian restaurant.
Very, um, low key in terms of the people are from California, you know, so
they have their own adaptation of what Italian is.  I mean, but it's, it was a
wonderful, wonderful experience.  You know they have, uh, women there going to
S M U, going to, uh, Southern Methodist University and, and graduating in
opera or something like that and they are all singing arias to you and,

B.84:  # Oh, wow.  #

A.85:  # and just # walking around the restaurant singing and they make the food
right there so it's display cooking and, and, uh, then they have wine casks all
over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place and you just
take a drink of wine and, you know, they don't count that really, they just,
