============================================================================

A.1:  Um, I guess my music taste, musical tastes, uh, run pretty much the gambit.
I listen to a little bit of everything.

B.2:  Oh, well, that's good.

A.3:  Yeah, uh, I, I grew up in East Texas listening to mostly country type 
music --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- country and western type stuff --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- uh, and of course, uh, grew up also with rock and roll, so I'm, that's
pretty much ingrained.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Uh, right now, most of my musical, uh, experiences are with radio.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  We listen to one of the local (( )) what's usually the number one local
rock type station.

B.12:  Um.

A.13:  Adult contemporary, soft rock --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- Ron Chapman,

B.16:  Oh yeah.

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  Is that K V I L or ?

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  And, uh, so we, we listen to that, uh, pretty much all the time.

B.22:  Huh.  Well I grew up around here, I grew up in Fort Worth --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and, uh, it's funny, because K V I L back when I was, uh, a teenager was
an A M station, I think --

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  -- yeah, and, uh, it used to have like the top twenty, top forty all the
time --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- you know.  And I, course I was listening to rock music.  But what I
called rock music when I was a teenager [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  Now, the music is so different than what I used to listen to that I don't
know if I could consider it the same, but,

A.31:  Well, it's, I, I was just thinking, uh, you know, we, we say, or K V I L
says I think they call theirs adult contemporary --

B.32:  Yeah, yeah.

A.33:  -- uh, which means soft rock --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- or early type rock music --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- and that's really what I --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- what I consider rock and roll,

B.40:  Yeah, well,

A.41:  it's, uh, (( )) rock.

B.42:  my husband and I are both that way.  We, we both really like the Beatles
a lot.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  Well, it's, that's funny because I even, when I first heard the
Beatles I couldn't stand them --

B.44:  Oh, really. 

A.45:  -- you know, it took a, a while before I really liked the Beatles.

B.46:  That's funny.  Well, I'm probably older than you then [laughter].

A.47:  Well, I doubt that [laughter].

B.48:  But, I, uh, I always thought the Beatles were great.

A.49:  Yeah, I, I might have been too old for the Beatles --

B.50:  Oh [laughter].

A.51:  -- that's probably what it was.

B.52:  Oh, that's funny [laughter].

A.53:  I was past that point --

B.54:  Oh [laughter].

A.55:  -- when they came along.  Uh, but, uh, I, I grew up, uh, listening to 
Elvis --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- you know, be-, even before the Beatles, so.

B.58:  Yeah, see, I liked Elvis a lot --

A.59:  Right, yeah.

B.60:  -- and he was like my hero --

A.61:  But, uh,

B.62:  -- and now my little girl thinks it's real funny --

A.63:  But, uh.

B.64:  -- because, uh, she'll see him, she'll go, Oh you mean you really thought
he was neat [laughter].

A.65:  But, uh, my, uh, like I said, my, my tastes run the range.  We listen to,
uh, you know, even listen to a little bit of classical type stuff.  My, my
wife, uh, plays the piano --

B.66:  Um.

A.67:  -- and she plays a little bit of that --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- and so, we, you know, we listen to that.  She plays, you know, what-,
what she can, what she --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- wants to.

B.72:  Well, that's good.

A.73:  Um, you know, but, uh, I guess, musicians or singers in particular, uh,
Willie Nelson's one of my favorites,

B.74:  I like Willie Nelson, too.

A.75:  (( )) in the country and western ran-, thing, and I really, I'm enjoying
quite a bit of the country music now.

B.76:  Yeah.  Well, see, I, the reason I said my taste was probably different is I
have always liked country music --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and my husband has always been just total rock --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- and so, uh, we never could agree on what we were going to listen to
after we got married, because I'd want to hear country, and he'd want to hear
rock, and we couldn't get along, because his rock was too rock for me.

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  I like soft rock, but I don't like some of the heavy metal stuff --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- he was listening to.  And, um, so both of us, we're real strong members
of a church, and, uh, we decided we'd start listening to contemporary
Christian music.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  So we started listening to one of the stations around here that we both
really like.  It plays just Christian music all the time --

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  -- and we've gotten now where that's pretty much all we listen to, and, uh,
there're some really, really talented artists that's --

A.89:  Yes, I,

B.90:  -- you know, song writers and singers, that do just Christian music.

A.91:  Right.

B.92:  So, of course, you know Amy Grant and people like that --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- are pretty well known.  There's a guy named [throat_clearing] Bruce
Carroll --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- and he's my favorite because he has a country sound --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- but it's Christian lyrics, and he's a wonderful song writer.  He won a,
an, an, is it Emmy or, what does it --

A.99:  (( )) let's see, the,

B.100:  -- Grammy, it's the Grammy awards -- 

A.101:  The Grammy, yeah.

B.102:  -- they give for music, yeah.  He won a Grammy for inspirational song of
the year last year.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  So.

A.105:  Well, our daughter listens to, uh, to quite a bit to one of those, I don't
know which station it is she listens to.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  Our, our son is into heavy metal, and our daughter's into, the, the
Christian type music.

B.108:  Yeah, well, that's neat.

A.109:  (( )) went to a, went to the concert down at Reunion last week.

B.110:  Oh, Sandy Patty,

A.111:  Sandy Patty.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Right.  

B.114:  Well that's pretty neat.  

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  Well, see, I'm excited that kids these days are liking decent music and --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- uh, I mean, all the songs, of course, on, on this station have real
good, good lyrics and good ideas --

A.119:  Right, yeah.

B.120:  -- [Laughter] that kind of thing.  So, I really encourage my daughter to
listen to that.

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  She, right now, she loves it.  I don't know --

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  -- if it'll stick with her.  She's still young, in elementary school.  So.

A.125:  Oh, yeah, well, that's.  Our daughter's an adult, so --

B.126:  Yeah --

A.127:  -- but, uh, so she's,

B.128:  -- well that's, that's good that she still chooses that.  But --

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  -- you know, I like the country sound.  There are sev-, I like Willie
Nelson.  I always like Don Williams.

A.131:  Oh, yeah,

B.132:  My dad thought I was crazy, but --

A.133:  I love his,

B.134:  -- he's always been one of my favorites.

A.135:  Yeah. 

B.136:  And, um, then my husband, on the other hand, he, I guess, when he was like
in his early twenties really got into the heavy metal kind of stuff --

A.137:  Uh-huh

B.138:  -- before we got married.

A.139:  Yeah.

B.140:  So then he'd want to play that stuff, and I was like --

A.141:  Uh,

B.142:  -- oh, that's giving me a headache [laughter].

A.143:  That's, uh, our son goes, you know, goes off into his room and turns his
on.  He's, he's not around much, eith-, either --

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  -- very much, but he'd go into his room and turn it up, you know, and we'd
do our best to, to live with it or get him to turn it down [laughter].

B.146:  That's ri-, [laughter],

A.147:  And, uh, but, uh --

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  -- you know, it's, I'm not, uh, I don't, uh, I don't find too much of the
heavy metal stuff that I want to listen to.

B.150:  Yeah, yeah, well I still, whenever they, um, have these advertisements on T
V for, um, records that have like all the songs from the seventies, I was in
high school like from the early seventies --

A.151:  Uh-huh.

B.152:  -- and, uh, so all that music brings back a lot of memories, you know, and
I'm always thinking, oh, I'd like to have one of those albums, but since we
made this agreement that we're going to listen to Christian music, I think I
will.  I'll probably set it on the shelf and --

A.153:  Yeah, yeah.

B.154:  -- would never, you know, play it.

A.155:  So, instead, you buy Sandy Patty --

B.156:  Yeah [laughter].

A.157:  -- and Amy Grant,

B.158:  [Laughter] That's right, we buy things that we know the whole family can
listen to.

A.159:  Uh, I was trying to think, there's some, uh, we go to the First Baptist
Church over here in Richardson --

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  -- and, uh, there some, some of the musicians, some of the young people
from there that have become --

B.162:  Oh, that's neat.

A.163:  -- semi pro, I guess, musicians.  

B.164:  Uh-huh.

A.165:  Our daughter's gone, uh, gone on a couple of choir tour things with the,
with the young peoples' choir.

B.166:  Oh, that's good, yeah.

A.167:  And, uh, and she, she really gets into, into that singing with that group,
you know.

B.168:  Yeah, well, see, I'm an interesting person because I go to the Church of
Christ --

A.169:  Uh-huh. 

B.170:  -- and there's a lot of people --

A.171:  Now that's, 

B.172:  -- at Church of Christ that think, uh,

A.173:  You don't have music in the Church of Christ [laughter].

B.174:  That's right, and, and I think my personal opinion is they're missing out
on a lot, and I love, um, this, you know, that K L T Y, that's what I listen
to all the time --

A.175:  Oh, yeah.

B.176:  -- and I, I love all the music that they play on there, but I have a lot of
people that go to church with me that kind of criticize that, and think that,
uh, it's wrong, and all this, so.  Uh,

A.177:  Yeah, well, I guess, uh, you know, there are ways to express your feelings
and your beliefs --

B.178:  Yeah.

A.179:  -- and uh, music is one of the ways of expression --

B.180:  Yeah, yeah.

A.181:  -- and you know, it's not, uh,

B.182:  Well, I told my husband, the one thing I like about it is, uh, you know,
you kind of think about whatever you listen to --

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  -- I mean, you may just, you may not realize you're doing it but you do.
And, uh, when I listen to Christian music then I'm list-, I'm thinking about
something good, you know, and --

A.185:  Right.

B.186:  -- I'll be washing dishes or something, and I'll think about a song, and
it'll bring back, you know, some ideas, and --

A.187:  Yeah.

B.188:  -- so to me it's just a good influence --

A.189:  Right.

B.190:  -- but, there's still a whole lot of other music I, you know, really enjoy
listening to.  My husband and I both kind of really got into ...
