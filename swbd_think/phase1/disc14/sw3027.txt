============================================================================

A.1:  The space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag, funding
wise anyway.  They've decided the space station's not, may not be worth it
and, uh, they're going to fight over that for a few years it seems.

B.2:  [Breathing].

A.3:  And, uh, just the idea of flight, uh, the shuttle system and what they
thought they could do and what they're ending up doing and the complexity and
the seeming, uh, number of errors and breakdowns and problems they're having
with it.  Uh, it may not be common thing all too soon.  And, even if they
ever do get it common, uh, or get it to where,

B.4:  [Throat_clearing].

A.5:  you know, the, uh, a large percentage or even a, uh, a one to two percent
of a, of a given nation ends up in space for some reason or another.  Uh, they
haven't solved, and I don't know if they can solve, the problem that
weightlessness has, extended weightlessness has, on the human body.  I 
mean --

B.6:  [Noise] Right.

A.7:  -- I mean we can do all we want as far as technology goes, but if a human
can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station, that,
for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay [sigh].

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  So, I don't know if, uh, if all the monies [sigh] that are being spent on
it, uh, really should be spent with the idea of, or with the goal of, of the
space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space.
I don't mind spending the money from the standpoint of, uh, basically
government funded, uh, research and development and, you know, it's tend to
create jobs.  Our, our economy [sigh] tends to be, uh, based on a lot of, a
lot of that lately.  Of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when
the government decides to shut down things like bases and, and, uh, like, uh,
Carswell and things of that nature.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  So what do you think about the, the, uh, whole space program, as it were?

B.12:  [Sigh] Uh, well I'm, I'm kind of with you.  They've, they've definitely run
into some problems and I think it's, it's some, it's, it's due to their own
shortsightedness, uh, perhaps, the, trying to do too much too quickly.  Uh.
and, you know, they take, they take some, I think that they thought they were
going to get a lot more done more quickly than they, then they really did.
They didn't think out all of the, the variables that, uh, that might crop up
and th-, they've been hit with a lot of those.  Uh, a lot of, I think they've
had a lot of poorer, poor management here in the past several years.  No, no
clearly defined goals, uh, uh, um, and, and goals are, that were obtainable,
you know.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  They, they needed to look at the long, long range picture.  I think that,
that, uh, Soviets have, have done a better job of that.  You know, they were
very, uh, they were limited so much in their technology and, but they, because
of that, they, they tended to say what we're going to do, what we do and
continue to do it and do it over the long haul and so that's what they've
done.  And they've, they've, uh, you know, they, they've had a man in, in
space for, you know, a, quite a long time.  You know, in, in, in the different
space stations that they've had, and, uh --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- so that, tha-, you know, that's been good for them.  They've learned a
lot and they've, they've made some achievements in that respect.  But, they've
been doing it very slowly and very long range, you know --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and we haven't done that.  We tend to, to look at a big, uh, a big
project that we like to, to have done, you know, you know, do the shuttle
thing and, and, and, have it as a, you know, a space transport system, you
know, up in the next ten years and you can't do that.  You know, I mean it's
just not, not feasible, but, you know, you know, the Americans, the American
public doesn't like to sit back and wait ten years for something to get
developed and, and put up, whe-, when, and especially with funding the way it
is (( )).

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  Uh, I, uh, I think there are definite benefits from, from, th-, from the
process of, of creating space projects.  Y-, you know we've seen that, in
terms of computers and, [breathing] and the, uh, myriad of different, uh,
technological advances, but, uh, like you say, you have to kind of weigh that
as to what is it worth, in the long, you know, for the, for the overall, uh,
picture, uh, how much we are willing to, to put out for, to have teflon on our,
on our, on our cooking pans and [laughter] (( )).

A.21:  Right.  [laughter] You know we really don't want the economy, to, or the
space program to become a too large percentage of the economy so that when
something catas-, some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed,
you don't gut the economy, 

B.22:  [Breathing].

A.23:  sort of the, like, the defense industry problem has, has occurred --

B.24:  R-, right.

A.25:  -- uh, as, as needs changed in the defense world then you go and cut back
on your spending and it cripples whole sections of the nation, as it were with
the lack of jobs and lack of whatever else. [sigh] You do that with the space
program and now as complex and as many different directions,

B.26:  [Breathing].

A.27:  as they are being tugged with technology, uh, they want to be so big that
if we ever did allow that, um, we're liable to be in the same boat and once
these contracts are finished or if the space pr-, platform disintegrated for
whatever reason, [noise] [breathing] uh, maybe there would be that many
thousands of jobs that were supplying, prats-, you know #parts# --

B.28:  #Right.# 

A.29:  -- that weren't there any #more# --  

B.30:  #Right.#

A.31:  -- you know, and you'd have to go back to the jobs that needed to, uh, be
there when it was being created instead of being sustained.  And, you, know,
you can't have, uh, a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up
there.  So, i-, it gets kind of complicated when you start talk-, getting that
big.  Plus you get so many different directions, uh, not being limited by
technology here in the U S but being limited by the whims of changing funding.
Uh, it needs even that much more or better management from, uh, the NASA
people to keep a clear goal and a relatively, a reasonable one in sight, as it
were.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  [Sigh] So, I don't know, it's a, it's a complex issue but, 

B.34:  You know, I, I mean I would love to see, you know, big things, like
that happen.  I me-, I mean, you know, you know I went through the entire, and
I grew up in that early sixties, you know, big, big boom --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- of, uh, all those Mercury and Gemini and, uh, Apollo [noise] shots and,
and, and, and was real caught up in that and would love to see something big
happen, you know, I'd like to see that, that occur but, yo-, you, like you
say, it's, it's a, it, it, it is a drain and you don't, it would cost an
enormous amount of money to put that up, yeah, put something up like a space
station that would work and, and, really, really be beneficial for us.  And,
uh, [sigh] I don't, I don't know if, if it's worth it.

A.37:  Well they keep talking about, uh, the space station.  The biggest thing
they want to do up there is, is test out, different manufacturing techniques,
uh --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- weightlessness.  But are these, I never could quite figure out whether
these techniques were something that [breathing] could be done, uh, [talking]
simulated, or we learn enough about it to do it down here on earth.  Or, are
we talking about having to build some sort of a station that is going to
produce these products.  And, how much could you really produce in a lab up
there, uh, I don't, I don't really guess I understand what they're going to do
{conversation begins to fade} unless they're going to [/talking] turn out
product from that,
