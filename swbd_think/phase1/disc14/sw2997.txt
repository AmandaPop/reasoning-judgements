===========================================================================

A.1:  All right, uh, well that's an interesting topic.

B.2:  Yes, it is, do you have young people?

A.3:  Yeah,

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  I've got three small children.  

B.6:  Three small ones. 

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  Okay.  Would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced
life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform
some kind of public service?

A.9:  Well I, basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public
service, no matter what career path they take, unless they are just absolute
dropouts.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And, uh, part of my reaction is that, uh, some people, [phone_ringing] 
{faintly} particularly those that are gifted and talented, uh, and highly
motivated, uh, ought to get on with their lives and, uh, and do the thing that
they do best.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  You know, if somebody wants to become a doctor or a, uh, dedicated
professional and they're serious about it, uh, I hate to see their, their
lives put on hold for year or two while they, uh, uh, they do something
that's, uh, not down their alley.

B.14:  Well you're looking at it from a perspective of something equivalent to
the draft.  Where you take two years out of your life and, and serve as, as a,
a milita-, in the military.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  However, they didn't say that it would be required to be two consecutive
years.  What about the option of requiring these young people to have two
years of public service in association perhaps with their education and that
they get, [phone_ringing] you know how we have, uh, life credits in
college,

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  experience credits.  Why could those not apply in exactly that way.  You
actually are using that as a part of your college education and it's a quote
public service course.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  I think, uh, I hate to see things mandated for people,

B.20:  [/Phone_ringing] Uh-huh.

A.21:  because I like to see people have their choice.  Freedom of choice,
let's not get into that subject.  Uh, 

B.22:  Well it would be like an elective.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  It would be the equivalent of an elective.  Do you want to serve in the
Peace Corps, or do you want serve, uh, i-, you know, on a, on a some sort of a
social agency where you do volunteer work or perhaps you'd like to do reading
for the blind for a couple of years in your spare time.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And it might be three hours a week.  That's what a class is.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Three or four hours a week.  Then they have a balanced view, I think, of
what is out there.  I know that a lot of young people are raised in a very
protected environment, mom and dad don't want them exposed to the kind of
things that they had to endure, or they had to go through.  They want a better
life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon and
then when they get out in the real world and life does give them a good smack,
they go to their knees.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Because they haven't had the experience in helping people.  Therefore they
don't have experience in seeking help, or, in being helped gracefully. 

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Uh, I myself have done a lot of volunteer work, but I am very apprehensive
about accepting help.  I'm very independent and I don't care much for that.
And I raised my children to be very independent and yet they did their share
of volunteer work.  We went to the nursing homes and carried Christmas gifts
and we visited sick people.  Those are all good community service behaviors
and activities.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And they don't require a big bite of your life.

A.35:  Yeah, I think one of the reactions I had was, when I graduated from
college I was all set to, uh, go into military service and, and do my part.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  And, uh, when it, at the end of my four years, and I got my degree,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  and I started talking to, uh, some of the recruiters for different
companies,

B.40:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.41:  And, uh, one of them sat me down and he said hey, you know, what are you
going to do in two years in the military.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Uh, where are you going to go and, and what's going to happen to you.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  And they persuaded me that, uh, I could serve my country better,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  by going to work for one of the, uh,

B.48:  Defense.

A.49:  military industrial companies.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  In direct support of, uh, military operations.  And so that's where I've
been ever since.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  And so I don't regret, uh, not going into military service.

B.54:  Right, but, you did serve --

A.55:  Yeah, but, 

B.56:  -- in, in a different respect and that's what I'm saying.  You don't have
to go into the Peace Corps in order to be of, of service to the community.  

A.57:  Yeah.  And, uh, everybody has there, uh, soapbox.  I have a lot of people
come around to the house, uh, uh, trying to solicit funds for some
environmental action or preserve some form of wildlife -- 

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and I turn them down.  Uh, because I, I choose to contribute directly,

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  in terms of energy.  And I've been involved in research diving on several
occasions to, uh, y-, uh, gain information about the environment,

B.62:  [Beep] Uh-huh.

A.63:  and it contributes to the, uh, body of knowledge.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  So I'd rather put my money in that form directly.  And I think a lot of
people do things like that, that, uh, 

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  they have their own applications #that get them involved in the public.#

B.68:  #Oh, yeah, I do a great deal of,# you know, I would rather expend the
personal energy than just shell out a few bucks and let my conscience rest.  

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  I feel like that you, I don't know, the, the benefit to you is much, of
greater value if you are physically or emotionally involved in what you're
doing.  It's no big deal to be emotionally involved in writing a check.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  I mean, you know, you don't really get involved and you don't really
comprehend what you're accomplishing.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  And I think that's important.  And that's the reason that I think there,
there should be some provision, even if it's not mandatory.  

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  At least, provide the avenue through which young people can do volunteer
work even if it is not a two year stint in the Peace Corps.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  Uh.

A.79:  Well, I think an awful lot is available at the present time.  I have a
niece who's with me for the summer --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- and, uh, she had done volunteer work for the Sierra Club --

B.82:  Uh-huh,

A.83:  -- in, uh, years past.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  And she currently has a summer job with them, so she's,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  she's getting paid for what she used to do as a volunteer but she's
getting more, more actively involved with the, uh, Sierra Club.

B.88:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

A.89:  But that's, that's the thing that she wants to do.

B.90:  You've got to remember though the nature of the person we're inve-, when,
we're involved with here.  You, you can expect someone like that, perhaps, to
be willing to volunteer to get, expend the energy to go out and find,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  the area where they match very well.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  But it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like
they do the screening system in the military service.  Okay, you know, what
are your interests and what are your aptitudes.  Let's see if we can match you
to a job that you prefer.  

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  Particularly with, you have the education to deal with it.  I don't know,
that may or may not be, uh, a useful choice, but I do know that there are a
great deal of young people out there who would say, why do I want to go, you
know, out and get mosquito bit and s-, sleep on a hard ground when I can sit
here in this cushy bed and not go out and, and, uh, I can have my music and
drive my cars and have fun through the summer.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  And there are a lot of them who just do not have that sense of
consciousness and I think maybe something in place might build that ...
