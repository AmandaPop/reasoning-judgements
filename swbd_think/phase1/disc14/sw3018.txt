REMARKS: 	There's a lot of breathing noise by Speaker B.  It's
too frequent to note every time.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, what are your favorite things to watch?

B.2:  Oh, uh, [noise]  let's see, I, uh, I have enjoyed, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING --

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  -- in the past, uh, now that it has gone off [laughter]. 

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  Uh, [noise]  some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,

A.7:  # Yeah.  #

B.8:  # but, # what, what are your, what is,

A.9:  We do not watch a lot of T V, we try to watch it on Thursday nights, we
usually watch L A LAW, I like that real well. 

B.10:  Yeah. 

A.11:  And CHEERS --

B.12:  Yeah. 

A.13:  -- we like to watch that.  Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW.  Uh, do you
ever watch that?

B.14:  Yeah, uh, (( )) yeah, yeah, we, we wa-, we try to catch that most, most
nights. 

A.15:  Yeah [inhaling].  And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last
couple seasons.  I was sort of sorry to see it go --

B.16:  Yeah. 

A.17:  -- too. 

B.18:  It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh,
the kind of whining or whatever on it.  I, I really did not think it, it was,

A.19:  # Yeah.  #

B.20:  # that # way.  I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it
presented. 

A.21:  Yeah, I thought a lot of the, like the problems that Michael and Hope had
in their marriage and stuff, [laughter] I can relate to some of those things.

B.22:  Yeah. 

A.23:  Just the dynamics of it and everything. 

B.24:  Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,
but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes
as,

A.25:  # Oh, really.  #

B.26:  # as examples # of things that were going on and, and uh, yo-, you know,
that they ((called)) interaction between people and ((sort of)) to use as, uh,
as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,

A.27:  # Yeah.  #

B.28:  # and # that sort of thing [inhaling].  Uh, we [throat_clearing]  kind of,
uh, (( )) our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our
[inhaling]  our daughter came along, so, uh,

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.30:  # that, # that tends to, uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the
time you get through [noise]  getting her ready for bed and everything, uh,
[inhaling]  it's, uh, very little T V time left. 

A.31:  Yeah, you are too tired [laughter]  --

B.32:  Yeah. 

A.33:  -- to do anything.  Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think
though, than glued in front of the T V anyway. 

B.34:  [Sniffing] Yeah, that's right. 

A.35:  Probably more worthwhile.  I just don't, I don't think there's as many good
things to watch as there used to be, really. 

B.36:  No, I, I can not, uh, I don't think there were, Uh, I have not, I have not,
uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to
watch as much as I used to [inhaling].  I, uh, you know, ther-, I, uh, I used
to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my
time to watch, but, uh, I ((uh, you know)) very seldom like to watch ((you
know)) those, there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.  I like, uh,
home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,

A.37:  # Right, yeah.  #

B.38:  # it's, I # notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE, ((yeah)) but it's,
uh, it's on instead of being on pub-, P B S it's on regular T V. 

A.39:  Oh. 

B.40:  But, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
and, 

A.41:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I have seen parts of that before, it is interesting. 

B.42:  Yeah, so I like to watch that and [inhaling] uh, some, some things on P B S
I like to watch but, uh.

A.43:  Do you watch sports much on T V?

B.44:  [Inhaling] Yeah, if it's someb-, if it's a team or something that I am
really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to
be watching it or,

A.45:  # Yeah.  #

B.46:  # or # I am not a big basketball or baseball fan, if it, unless it's
baseball, if it's some, if it's a team I really like, I may watch but, uh,
[inhaling]  baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V,

A.47:  # Yeah.  #

B.48:  # for # an extended period. 

A.49:  It's slow. 

B.50:  Yeah, it's so slow that you just get bored, you know, I, I will switch
between [inhaling] something else and, and a baseball game going back and
forth, you know watching it.  But, I usually, if, if, if it's a football team
I really like, (( )) a college team or, or pro team [inhaling] that I am fond
of, I usually will sit and watch that.  But, uh, that's the [inhaling],

A.51:  Yeah, we are like that and occasionally we will, like on, if we do not have
anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or
something,

B.52:  # [Inhaling].  #

A.53:  # we # will watch a little bit of a golf tournament.  But, uh,

B.54:  # Yeah.  #

A.55:  # you # can not take a whole lot of that either, it's pretty slow. 

B.56:  Yeah, it's kind of like,

A.57:  # Yeah.  #

B.58:  # like # baseball [laughter]. 

A.59:  Do you wa-, we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home,
because there's just,

B.60:  # [Inhaling].  #

A.61:  # on # Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on and,

B.62:  Right.  I think that that's what more people are doing and I think that's,
you know, as, as T V, I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot
of people to do, to do that, uh, you know, get more movies and watch. 

A.63:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.64:  # I # know we, [inhaling] we have done that too in the past, uh, we do not
do it quite as much now, cause [laughter] our baby will not let us watch them.

A.65:  Yeah. 

B.66:  But, uh, you know, we usually will, we used to rent, uh, two or three
movies on a weekend and, and try to watch.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Do you have cable T V?

B.68:  No, uh,

A.69:  We do #not either.# 

B.70:  # we live in, #

A.71:  I thought we were the only ones [laughter], 

B.72:  # No.  #

A.73:  # who # did not have it. 

B.74:  No, we, uh, the, uh, development we moved into was, they have it on one
si-, like right across the street from us,

A.75:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.76:  # but # when they built our section they did not, did not put it in and
[sigh]  we have been there about two years now. 

A.77:  # Gosh.  #

B.78:  # and # they are still, still do not have it so [inhaling], 

A.79:  # Yeah.  #

B.80:  # I # am hoping that, that soon they will, they will, I have contacted them
about this and they say that well, it's, it's, they look, they, every year they
look at, uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, uh, the most
houses will be,

A.81:  # Uh-huh.  #

B.82:  # and # so they, uh, they look and they, when they, when we reach a certain
number of people in that area they will put one in, put,

A.83:  # Huh.  #

B.84:  # some # in, or they will at,

A.85:  # Yeah.  #

B.86:  # least # consider it, so. 

A.87:  Yeah.  Well, we had it for awhile and it just seemed like we never watched
it ((any)) we did not have the movie channels, we just had all the normal ones,

B.88:  # Yeah.  #

A.89:  # that # come and we just never watched any of them, we kept a log for a
month of every time we watched it and it seemed like we did not watch even half
an hour,

B.90:  # Um.  Yeah.  #

A.91:  # so we # decided to just cancel it.  It does improve the reception a
little bit though, that's the only thing.

B.92:  [Sigh] Yeah.  I have, I put some, put in some, uh, an antenna, a really
good antenna and, uh, it's really helped, you know, ours and it's not been too
bad.  I have not really missed it that much, there's certain things that I
have, that I want to see, you know, occasionally, like a football game, a
college game or something that happens to be on cable, [sigh] or some old
movie, but the, uh, I, I have not been bothered by it too much.

A.93:  Yeah. 

B.94:  So,

A.95:  Well, I can not, [laughter]  uh, think of too much else to say. 

B.96:  Right. 

A.97:  Since we are not big watchers. 

B.98:  Okay. 

A.99:  Well, it was nice talking to you. 

B.100:  Alright, bye. 

A.101:  Bye.
