=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so, uh, what do you do with your lawn?  

B.2:  Oh, I just, I just mow the lawn that's about all I ever do.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Do you put any fertilizer or anything like that?  

B.4:  Um, not really to speak of.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Um, when I was little we used to use, uh, like a chicken manure and cover
the whole lawn with it.  And then, uh, plant, uh, bermuda mostly.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  And how about, uh, like landscaping or the, you know, bushes or
flowers or anything?

B.8:  Um, we had monkey grass.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  And a wax leaf ligustrums.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  And do you like take care of those in any way as far as, uh,
feeding them or,

B.12:  Well, the free-, it's really bad here because the last couple of years the
freeze has been real bad.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  So I had to hack them off a little bit.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  And, um, [throat_clearing] and it left most of them dead.  

A.17:  Oh, did it?  

B.18:  In a lot of places it, they, just killed them right off.  

A.19:  Right, right.

B.20:  Yeah. 

A.21:  Well, we have, we just moved in and we're, uh, trying to, our yard has been
left ((untended)) mostly for about six years so there's a lot of clover
growing in it and everything.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  And, uh, so we're trying to do is, k-, to, to kill back all the weeds and
the clover and let so the grass can grow and a number of the bushes, uh,
there's a lot of boxwood bushes and all that were overgrown so we had to trim
those all back, you know, to, to nice and round because they were kind of
sticking out all over the sidewalk and everything.  And there was some, I saw
a juniper that was, uh, absolutely huge covering up half the driveway just
about, so we had to cut it all back so you can park the two cars in it.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  And, uh, mostly what we're doing since we got a yard service to, or lawn
service to help fertilize, uh, seed, aerate the lawns, uh, so that, uh, you
know, we can get it back up to speed and t-, and, and to get, get it all green
again.  And I was going wa-, what I was going to do is watch them throughout
the year and see what kind of fertilizer they use and, uh, then I'd just
repeat it from then on myself.
 
B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  And, uh, we're also kind of looking at, uh, a little bit of landscaping as
far as putting some, uh, azaleas in with, uh, you know, different white
azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas, you know, to give a little color
into the, into the landscape there.  And, uh, you know, put a couple plants
around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing
plants, uh, to give a little color and everything.  Uh, do you do anything
like that or,

B.28:  Um, [throat_clearing] not very much.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  Um, just, um, I had some hanging, uh, flowers in the, on the porch.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And, uh, and a few plants on the inside.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  That's about it.   

A.35:  You know some of the things that I've seen around here too is that a lot of
people, uh, there's kind of two ways to, to, that I've seen to cheaply
fertilize your yard.  And one was to, uh, I guess the big thing around is
called a ((composter)).

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  You know, where you, have you heard of that?  

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  Oh, yeah, whether you, you know, you put your whatever, different grass
clippings and all that in and, and you let it sit there for a while and it
kind of cooks or something and, as it decomposes.  And we sort of have one I
guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using
some of that to spread around, you know, the, the, the bush beds and flower
beds and stuff.  But another thing that, uh, one of my neighbors is doing and
it, it has, ours looks really good is that he's not using any of the, he's not
collecting any of the, uh, uh, the, the, uh, grass that he mows up at all.  He
just let's it sit right back into the grass, you know, doesn't collect it in a
bag or anything.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  And by doing that I guess it sort of acts like it's own fertilizer.

B.42:  Right.  

A.43:  And, uh, it just makes the grass real thick and, and green and everything
and it doesn't cost anything.

B.44:  Yeah, they have a, they have a mulching blade now it cuts the, cuts the
grass up real fine and you don't have to, you don't, you can't even see it
when it falls into the grass.  It, it just penetrates right through to the
ground.

A.45:  Oh, you mean so that's a separate blade?

B.46:  Well, I don't know exactly what it does but it cuts, 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  the grass a lot finer than, than, uh, the old mowers used to do.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  Do you think that that's like, uh, a blade that you can put on any
mower,

B.50:  [Throat_clearing].

A.51:  or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing?  

B.52:  Uh, it's a special blade.  

A.53:  Oh, really?  Huh?

B.54:  I mean they have mulching mowers but then they have a mulc-, uh, mulching
attachment too that you can put on other mowers.

A.55:  Oh, I'll have to look for that.  I didn't know it was a separate blade.

B.56:  I think, I think it's double-edged.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And it cuts it back and forth.  

A.59:  Oh, okay.  Uh, I'll have to look for that because that, that would sure
help us.  And I thought it was, I thought it was just, I don't know something
special on the engine too as well or something.

B.60:  Huh.

@@A.61:  Huh.  Have to look for that.  Well, is there anything else you'd like to
say?

B.62:  Uh, no, that's about it.  

A.63:  Okay, [laughter] well, it was very nice talking to you.  

B.64:  Nice talking to you.  

A.65:  Okay, take care.   

B.66:  Bye.  

A.67:  Bye.
