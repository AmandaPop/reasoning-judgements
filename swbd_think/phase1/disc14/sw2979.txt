=============================================================================

A.1:  Some of the, the more recent, uh, changes that I've noticed in society is,
I guess, over the last ten to twenty years are maybe the technological
advances.  You know, ten to twenty years ago there wasn't a V C R in every
home, and there wasn't, uh, some of the,

B.2:  I know, remote control was a great big box,

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  that was connected to the back of the T V.  

A.5:  Uh, that's true, yeah, and the old remote controls that were all by sound
and you could drop a coin or clang some dishes and turn off the T V or change
channels, and all the things that have changed over the years.

B.6:  [Throat_clearing].

A.7:  But along with that I, unfortunately I guess, there's been a down side to a
lot of that stuff, I mean, another three or four years, you're going to have a
land fill full of V C R -s that, and the parts and things that don't work --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and a lot of those things just don't go away.  And, uh, I guess the
[throat_clearing] environmentalists have done their jobs.  Ten to twenty years
ago I didn't think of it that much.  I knew about all the, the, uh,
organizations that tried to do that for a living, you know, let you know what,
what environmental impact was, but, just kind of recently, uh, the world's
waking up to that.  So that's a change that's come along.

B.10:  Yes, you got to, well, let's see, you, I guess you grew up in the, you were
a teenager in the seventies, right?

A.11:  Yeah, yeah.

B.12:  Okay, did you go to like Woodstock and all that?

A.13:  No, no, never got around, as it were, but I, uh, I paid attention to it all
being there.  So that, that has changed.  People are, uh, I think the, the
outspoken people, people who make a difference and make a change, that age has
come down.  It seems like, uh, you can make a difference at a younger age
these days.  You don't have to be a, an older part of the establishment to
make waves [laughter].

B.14:  You know, like that one little girl that wrote, who did she write, uh, they
showed her in some kind of airplane crash.  Seems like it was an eleven year
old girl wrote Gorbachev, or Noriega {spelled phonetically} or someone.

A.15:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

B.16:  (( )).

A.17:  It's true, they can, uh, they can make quite a difference at no matter what
the age nowadays, plus there seems to be, uh, there's a few negative changes
that have come along.  I was just thinking last night how different, uh, my
kids' childhood is from, uh, when I grew up I, I was allowed pretty much a
free rein around my house to ride my bike, uh, you know, several blocks 
away --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- even at the age of ten or eleven years old, I could ride a couple of
miles away.  I'd ride to school, you know, and it was right at two miles away
from the house.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  But it's just not safe anymore.

A.21:  Whereas here, yeah, I won't let them go, you know, more than a block out of
my sight there.  I'm just a little too paranoid these days with what's going
on, and, uh, we get, you know, reports from the police will give us warnings
about this neighborhood and some activity that's occurring there, and then,
you know, occasionally it works its way around to our neighborhood and we have
to keep a real close rein on them, won't even let them go out of our sight --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- for a while, and then after they catch that guy, you know, you can let
him go out for a while, but, it's, uh, it's kind of sad.

B.24:  Well, how old are your kids?

A.25:  I've got a nine year old and a seven year old --

B.26:  Okay,

A.27:  -- and, uh, they both like to ride their bikes off into never, never land
and, you know, be,

B.28:  Right, well we used to ride around, well I guess it would be a city block.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  My mom didn't mind.  I wouldn't dream of letting my little boy take off.

A.31:  Yeah, I used to, uh, I grew up in kind of a good combination of between the
country and the city --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- uh, in East Texas, and I had, while we were in town, we'd ride several
miles away, like to school and the like, but when we were in the country we
would ride ten, twelve miles away.  We'd spend a whole day just two or three
of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and
come back.  And, you know, as long as we told the parents what roads we were
going to be on --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and if there any trouble was they could come find us, but, uh, can't do
that now [laughter].

B.36:  Huh-uh.

A.37:  Just no safe place to let your kid go that long and, of course, it probably
wasn't that good of an idea back then, either, it just, uh,

B.38:  Well, no, but back even when I was growing up it wasn't, drugs wasn't as,
now drugs was pretty bad, but they weren't near as bad as they are now.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And this child abuse wasn't as bad as it is now, either.

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  And there's so many missing kids.

A.43:  You know, they're saying that the, uh, education is going to be enough, or
at least a major part of the drug deterrent, and I remember when I was in
school, they had a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the
science classes, and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff, but
that was nothing compared to the, you know, campaigns that are going on now,
but I guess it's just the, the class of people or the area that we're in, but,
I, I'm not in contact with any kids that think it's, it's a positive thing to
do.  I mean, it is --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- it is really looked down upon, even to the point of smoking.  I mean, my
kids are so ingrained that they look down on, we have to tell them, you know,
don't say anything in public to a stranger about his smoking [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  You know, not quite, that's not quite accepted, yet.  Now, if he's --

B.48:  [/Laughter]  Well,

A.49:  -- in a nonsmoking area, you might want to say something, but, they,
they're so outspoken on the topic that, uh, [throat_clearing] it's an
interesting change in attitudes,

B.50:  Yeah, that is because,

A.51:  coming, coming along with the education.

B.52:  even in my time smoking was just cool.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  All the cool people did it.

A.55:  Yep.

B.56:  Went outside, but.  My stepdaughter's getting like that, and that's pretty
hard, because her granny smokes, and we smoke, so [laughter],

A.57:  Uh, it won't take but a committed generation or so before it, uh, it is no
longer is a cool thing to do.  I don't know.

B.58:  Oh, yeah,

A.59:  Hopefully, hopefully, 

B.60:  have a smoke free, 

A.61:  we can get away from it. Yeah.

B.62:  Really.

A.63:  It's quite an expense too, now, they keep deciding that's the thing to tax
[laughter].

B.64:  Yeah, they do, what, about two dollars a pack now.

A.65:  Yeah, it keeps going up and up.  Well, I guess there's, uh, I don't know of
any other major changes other than the political environment.  Course the
things are no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on in
that realm, and Russia's no longer the major enemy and,

B.66:  Well, who is the major enemy now?

A.67:  I don't know if there is one, one easy one to, uh, to pick, that's part of
the problem.

B.68:  I don't know, when I was growing up I was scared of Red China.

A.69:  Yeah, yeah.

B.70:  Now, everybody told me that they had the biggest Army in the world, which I
guess they still do because,

A.71:  They probably still do as far as humans go.

B.72:  Yeah, because China's real densely populated.

A.73:  Of course, there, you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them, but I
don't that they'd be able to go anywhere and attack us [laughter].

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  They can't get all those people across the sea.  They don't have the ships
to get them anywhere.  So, they may have a huge army, but it's going to stay
put.

B.76:  Um.

A.77:  Uh, it's kind of an interesting, uh, interesting problem, not having any
one enemy to focus on as a society tends to, uh, let that go out of the mind.
You're no longer concerned with the, the weapon systems and the, the defense
area.  So, now that Russia is gone as a major focused on enemy, uh, that whole
defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives.  So, that's
an, an interesting social change I guess.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  Course it'll surprise them some day, when, when all the hostilities start
back up, and some people aren't prepared for it.

B.80:  Oh, I don't think anybody was prepared for this last,
