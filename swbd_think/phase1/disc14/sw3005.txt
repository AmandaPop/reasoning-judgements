REMARKS:        Speaker A had a little light static the second time around.  
Both speakers were hard to transcribe because they were stuttering so much.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, could you give me your thoughts on, uh, on any trends.

B.2:  Well, uh, longer term trends I think that, uh, like past oh, ten or
fifteen years, uh, the-, the-, there seems to be a, a trend and maybe it's
longer than that of, of politics is, is strictly a what can I get for me or
what can I get for my group and not what's best for the whole, uh, kind of a
thing, uh.  Does that make any sense or,

A.3:  Yeah, um, you're talking about the, uh,

B.4:  I mean the,

A.5:  political action committees and, 

B.6:  Yeah, political action committees,

A.7:  uh, sp-, 

B.8:  that, and I think it, I think it ties in with the, the budget deficit
that, uh, the Congress an-, and the [breathing] is, i-, they g-, they get
reelected by what they do for their districts, uh,

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  in terms of bringing in, and bringing in money and, and, uh, in order to
bring in money for their district they've got to vote to spend it in other
districts and, and, uh, the heck with the overall, uh, deficit.  And i-,
districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms
of, of, uh, whether it's Social Security or, or anything that, that, uh, wh-,
it's what, what you get for your constituents one way or another not what,
what's necessarily good overall.

A.11:  Yeah, we're, uh, w-, we feel it up here in New England because we're small
states so we don't have the represent and, representatives that,

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  that the larger states have, 

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  you know, like, like Texas #and California.#

B.16:  #Like Texas,# yeah.

A.17:  Um, but we've got, we have political clout only because of the tenure of
the people that are in there.  Like for, uh,

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  uh, the sub building, you know, Groton, and they're building down in
Newport now.

B.20:  Yeah.  Okay.

A.21:  But once,

B.22:  But yo-,

A.23:  ((uh)), somebody's got to do it.  Somebody's got to build the subs and I
guess Virginia can do it also.  In fact, I've got a,

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  the latest contract that was awarded.  Virginia sued or has got a lawsuit
against, uh, ((gratin)) to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained,

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  or something like that, [laughter] you know [breathing].

B.28:  Yeah, and, uh, yeah, but let's see you, you do have, uh, long time, uh,
long time power people there in terms of, I mean,

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  well, the other ones got, uh, ((Powell and)) (( )), 

A.31:  ((This, Powell)).  Yep.  Yep.

B.32:  a-, been in the senate forever.   

A.33:  Yep.

B.34:  And, uh,

A.35:  But when those, when those people leave, uh, the power is going to go,

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  um, there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough.
So the economy is going to, going to suffer I think,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  because the, the, the base that New England always had, the textile base
the, uh, the, uh, costume jewelry base, most of that now has moved out here
though to sell overseas or down south.

B.40:  Yep, Yep.

A.41:  So we're prone to, um, [lipsmack] uh, recessions like the rest of the
country where before we were kind of stable.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Uh, the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it.  At least
I think up,

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  up in this neck of the woods.  

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  But there's too many now, um, political action committees and where the
money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries
that can afford to contribute to those.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  So, those are going to get, uh, (( )) the squeaky wheel gets the oil,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  they're going to, they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it.
Somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wherever they
happen it to be, you know, you've, you've only got a few plane factories 
or,

B.52:  Well, I guess, I guess I'm a little more cynical than that.  I'm not, I'm
not sure that it, that all of it has to be done even.  But, uh,

A.53:  Well, I, I think they should be outlawed myself.  

B.54:  But well, in i-, 

A.55:  The, the, the packs, I don't think they should be ...

B.56:  Well, i-, but I mean in terms of, of not necessarily all the planes that
the government buys they really need or not necessarily.  Well,

A.57:  True.   

B.58:  i-, i-, in, in particular, uh, planes and I, you know, I see this here in,
in Texas that, that, uh, got, uh, [breathing] oh, I can't even remember which
of the companies it is.  But they've, they've got a, they've got a tilt rotor,
uh, plane that they've developed and they want to se-, but #developed for
the,#

A.59:  #Oh, like the, yeah.#  

B.60:  defensive depar-, department.  And defense department is saying, well,
no, we, we don't, we don't really need it.  It's going to be too expensive and
it's not,

A.61:  Yep.

B.62:  going to do what we need.  

A.63:  Yep.  

B.64:  And the, the Texas people are fighting to have it built for just to, just
to keep and create jobs,

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  here rather than, 

A.67:  ((Yep)). 

B.68:  because it's, uh, you know, they, they, they certainly use the words,
well it's needed,

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  but, but, uh,  

A.71:  Look at, look at the tanks now.  Look at that new ((Abram's)) tank.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  And I have no idea what the cost is, uh, five million, ten million --

B.74:  ((No)).

A.75:  -- for each one.  Now you can make, you can make a, a missile or, or a hand
held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively.

B.76:  Yep.  

A.77:  What do we need all the tanks for?  

B.78:  Right.  

A.79:  I mean you can make, you mak-, you can make probably a thousand rockets for
each tank.

B.80:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.81:  And you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively unin-, unin-,
untrained, uh, person and he can take, he can take one of those tanks out.

B.82:  Yep.  

A.83:  But yet I'm not sure who, is it Chrysler that makes the tanks or #one of
the, one of the,# 

B.84:  #I th-, I, I think# maybe so and I think that or ...

A.85:  And I don't think we really need all that hardware, 

B.86:  Yeah, yeah.

A.87:  and, and again like the Stealth bombers and, and some of these things,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  they, they put on their (( )) and they never fly or they never, they
never run right.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  Um, is it because of, of political clout,

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  rather than need?  I think in a lot of cases, yes.  

B.94:  Yeah, yeah.

A.95:  But we don't have a watchdog agency to, the military overlooks their own
testing --

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  -- which is good for us, I mean, it creates, you know, we generate a lot of
income at T I because of the military contacts.

B.98:  Right.  Right.  Right.  You know, that's true too.  But do you see any
other trends or particularly interesting events that come to your mind?

A.99:  Um, [lipsmack] the savings and loans crisis.  

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  The political trends there are, are, um, most of these people are lawyers
that are now in, in, uh, the government whether it's state or local.  Most of
them I guess you've been reading about the problems we've had in Rhode Island
where the governor closed down a lot of the, the, uh, credit unions and banks.

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  Because of, uh, it was privately insured but, 

B.104:  Well, it certainly d-,

A.105:  (( )) stated.

B.106:  certainly did when he first did it, but I haven't heard about it for a
while.  I was at, are th-,

A.107:  Yeah, there's still a lot of people that still can't get their money out.

B.108:  Can't, yeah.  

A.109:  Um, they still have to pay their, their bills, like their mortgages and
things.  They slip them under the door to the bank and but yet they can't get
any of their savings.

B.110:  Huh.  

A.111:  So it's, it's a little bit difficult but most of the people there, the
trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were
closed, they were state legislators.

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  So they had a conflict of interests -- 

B.114:  Yep.  

A.115:  -- because they tried to get through, uh, a bill stating that they had to
have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed.

B.116:  Yeah.
