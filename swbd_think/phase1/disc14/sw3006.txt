=============================================================================

A.1:  What would you serve at a dinner party?  

B.2:  Well, that would have to depend on the number of the people and the nature
of the party.

A.3:  Okay.  

B.4:  Fairly small parties with people that I know I tend to be a little bit more
casual, and I would tend to, [breathing] to, uh, serve things that were buffet
style.  Perhaps we'd have, uh, oh, I like those little, little cocktail
sausages in barbecue sauce,

A.5:  Uh-huh.   

B.6:  or, or maybe a sausage ball, uh, crackers and dips and chips maybe.  Uh,
probably have some kind of a, of a salad, uh, that's easy to pick up and
spread.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  Fresh veggies, probably, uh, possibly, uh, bo-, of cheese and chunks of,
uh, deli meat.  [breathing] Have to include some fruit of some kind.  I prefer
berries, uh, like sugared grapes and things that are very attractive to set
out on a,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  on a table.  A little bit more formal dinner party you might have just a
little bit more formal setting.  I don't have a lot of formal dinner parties
so I can't tell you a whole lot about that.

A.11:  ((Right)). 

B.12:  But I tend to be very lazy,

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  and want to do what is easy but looks and tastes good.  

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  So,

A.17:  Ours would lean more toward, uh, I guess monetary concerns rather than the
formality of the deal.  If, if we were having a bunch of friends over,

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  if there were six to ten coming over, we'd end up serving anything with
chicken, t-, you know, its cheapness [breathing].

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And, uh, [breathing] oh, you can run a, a, a regular spaghetti or even a
chicken spaghetti type casseroles.  Anything that they can be spread over a
large number of people for a few number of dollars.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  And, uh, [breathing] oh, if it's smaller and, and for a given occasion, my
wife will, will end up cooking a variety of, of, uh, (( )) more fancy foods as
it were.  But [breathing] I grew up in a, [breathing] in a family that, that
had a, a few formal things but, uh, my mother was deaf and, and hung around
the house a lot so she developed a, uh, a cooking habit that was just
unmatched by most of her peers,

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  and we ate some very good food and then large quantities of it.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  And even to this day with the two of them, uh, retired and, and none of the
kids at home and they still keep a large refrigerator totally full.  I, I,

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  just can't imagine.  I mean even our refrigerator with a family of four
does not have the food content that they manage to do.

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  [Breathing] So she still likes to, to cook a large, uh, variety of foods.
Um, my wife on the other hand comes out of the military type family and, and
they were always on the go, and they never really had a, a formal setting as
it were, and so she tends to cook a little more, uh, informal type things.
And when we have friends over, it's usually just for a, uh, a light, pretty
much what we would eat anyway, a light, informal meal and they usually bring
something, a desert or a salad or whatever.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  And, uh, I do like the, uh, [laughter] my wife's motto, when she finds
something she wants to experiment on, she'll experiment on company because
usually they're polite enough to eat it anyway [laughter],

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  instead of the family, you know, so.  

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  So we do get some weird concoctions on occasion, 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  that she'll, she'll experiment on things.  She has a real, uh, nice
repertoire of, uh, desserts.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  And, uh, [lipsmack] I like to, 

B.42:  Well,

A.43:  like to eat desserts.  

B.44:  In recent years I have become far more conscience of, conscious of
balancing the diet and having healthy foods.

A.45:  Um.  

B.46:  If I were having people over, I would want healthy food to be one of the
considerations.  Most of my friends really would prefer a bowl of fruit as
opposed to a big gooey cake.

A.47:  Um, interesting.  

B.48:  Uh, they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips.
Although there are some hard crust,

A.49:  [Laughter]. 

B.50:  chips and dippers.  #Uh,# 

A.51:  #Yeah.# 

B.52:  and I, I'd like to have a little bit of nutrition content in the foods.
I'll be careful but for example about the kind of cracker that I pick to go
under a spread.

A.53:  Um.  

B.54:  I may be concerned about the number of calories that are going into the
spread.  I know I watch my weight and I'm sure that most of my friends do too.
And I appreciate somebody being conscious of that when I go visit.  So, I do
try to cook more healthy than I did even five years ago.

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  Five years ago I let my palate dictate.  Uh, now I'm more conscious along
with everybody else.

A.57:  Yeah, that's in-, that's an interesting, 

B.58:  ((About the kind of)) (( )), uh-huh.

A.59:  discipline.  I haven't, uh, I, I probably should pay attention to that,

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  I'm, now that I think about it, i-, it does seem to be a bit of a change
in what I've been served at different houses over the years.

B.62:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.63:  Uh,

B.64:  Well, there was a time, for example, that I always made a big gooey, creamy
pie for dessert.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  Now, now I may use an angle food cake with fruit and a light whipped
topping.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Um.

B.68:  Far fewer calories and far less cholesterol.  Uh,

A.69:  And just as edible [laughter]. 

B.70:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, and,

A.71:  Very, balanced very #good, yes.# 

B.72:  #just as palatable.#  I love, 

A.73:  Yes.  

B.74:  peaches and strawberries, and I sure take advantage of them,

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  in season.  

A.77:  That's, that's a good deal.  

B.78:  And, uh, as far as the, the party snacks, uh, I may fix a trail mix --

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  -- or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to, what, pure peanuts.

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  Yeah.  Or, or something else that, that really is loaded with empty nutri-,
with empty calories, no nutrition.

A.83:  Yeah, popcorn has got to be one of the, 

B.84:  Oh, yeah, it's a favorite.  

A.85:  the most filling and least,

B.86:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.87:  uh, you know, bad for you,

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  as it were, 

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  and it seems to be good in all those categories,

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  that they're rating these days.  

B.94:  That's right.  

A.95:  Few calories and few, well, if you don't drench it in butter I guess.

B.96:  Uh-huh.   

A.97:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.98:  Well, I tend to, I, I, well nearly everything I try to balance.

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  Uh, you can take everything to an extreme.

A.101:  Right.  

B.102:  Everything to an extreme.  And I'm not going to take the flavor and the
pleasure out of the food in order to make it quote, healthy.

A.103:  Right.  

B.104:  I'd rather die than eat --  

A.105:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.106:  -- terrible tasting food.  

A.107:  Pure oats.  

B.108:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there are, you know, yo-, people whose systems are
accustom to that kind of discipline can actually tolerate it much better than
those who are not.  I know that when I began to add bran to my diet [laughter]
I had a terrible bellyache --

A.109:  Um.   

B.110:  -- [Laughter] until I, until my system became accustom to it.

A.111:  Interesting.  

B.112:  And, uh, by the same token when my husband and I first married, he was
accustomed to a, a greasy diet, lots of fried foods,

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  and I nearly died then [laughter] because I was accustomed to fresh
vegetables and baked meats.

A.115:  Um.  

B.116:  Or broiled meats.  Or grilled meats.  I prefer my meat grilled to fried
anytime.  I may do a little stir-fry or a little wok or something like that
but I do not fry my foods that much anymore.  Used to but I don't anymore.

A.117:  Yeah.  

B.118:  Two reasons.  One, it's just not that healthy and I, makes my stomach
upset.  Second, it's a big mess to clean up.

A.119:  I'll say.  

B.120:  [Laughter] I'm not interested in cleaning up a mess [breathing].

A.121:  Yeah, it's been a couple years we got rid of our deep fryer.  We used to
have,

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  one of those little bitty baby fryers, 

B.124:  Oh, yeah.  

A.125:  and we'd, uh, do everything from,

B.126:  Uh.

A.127:  uh, fondues to [breathing] some, 

B.128:  Uh-huh.  

A.129:  other little, uh, meats.  Even the, uh, french bread we used to actually
do in, in, uh, french toast as it were --

B.130:  Uh-huh.  

A.131:  -- in the oils but, uh, now it's just more like a grilled piece of, uh --

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  -- bread.   

B.134:  Uh-huh.  

A.135:  An-, a-, that's interesting.  I hadn't, I hadn't really thought about the
changes that have occurred.  I guess the, whatever entity is moving us toward
healthy foods is doing well.  The whole nation,

B.136:  Uh-huh.  

A.137:  seems to be moving slowly that way.  

B.138:  [Breathing] Well, of course, now we're going to find out two years down
the road that we've done something terrible and our body is going to,
