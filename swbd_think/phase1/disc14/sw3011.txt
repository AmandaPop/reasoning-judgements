every now and then making it hard to understand her.

===========================================================================

B.1:  All right so, uh, you live in Dallas?  

A.2:  Yes, I live in Dallas.  

B.3:  Now I understand that, um, the, the real estate market out there has
really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.

A.4:  Yeah, I think right now it's, it's kind of bad [baby].  Uh, I don't live in
a house, I live in an apartment [laughter].

B.5:  Oh.  

A.6:  Are, are you in a house?  

B.7:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.8:  Okay.

B.9:  Yeah, we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of
Washington.

A.10:  Uh-huh.  Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, uh, compare apartments
[laughter].

B.11:  [Laughter].  

A.12:  ((If it can)) compare the one that I have now, 

B.13:  [Sniffing]. 

A.14:  with the one that I had the last time, the one that I have now, uh, has a
lot more amenities, I guess is the right word, than the one that I moved out
of.  Uh, this one, you know, gave us free cable and, uh, ceiling fans and, uh,
it was practically new when I moved in here and the carpet was new and, 

B.15:  Huh.  Do you live in the high-rise?  

A.16:  No, it's not a high-rise.  It's just a, a two story building.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  Uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings but it's
just two stories.  Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.  On the first floor, um, where I
am, there's a patio.

B.19:  Oh, okay.  So, so you just, you have one floor all to yourself?

A.20:  Yeah.  

B.21:  Oh, okay.   

A.22:  The rooms are nice and large and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms.
And, uh, (( )), 

B.23:  Oh, that's nice.  Do you get your own washer, dryer?  

A.24:  Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area and I, I did buy the washer and
dryer, but they didn't provide it.

B.25:  Oh.  

A.26:  The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them, and
that's one of the reasons that I did move.

B.27:  Yeah.  That is nice.  

A.28:  Yeah.  

B.29:  [Sniffing]. 

A.30:  Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat [laughter].

B.31:  Yeah.  

A.32:  So, tell me ab-,

B.33:  Yeah, I've always, uh, been pretty lucky.  The real estate out here's been
pretty good.  It, uh, the, the prices of, well, the prices came down last
year.  We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome [laughter].

A.34:  Yeah.  

B.35:  The past, uh, uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally
new for northern Virginia.

A.36:  Uh-huh.  ((It just)),

B.37:  It just never happened before.  

A.38:  ((It's a real good)),

B.39:  So it's really surprising everybody.  [sniffing] All the developers don't
know what to do [laughter].

A.40:  Yeah, it's a good time to buy,

B.41:  Yeah, 

A.42:  if you're in the market.

B.43:  unfortunate-, we're, uh, we actually have our house on the market because
we have two kids --

A.44:  Uh-huh.  

B.45:  -- and we have a three bedroom house.  And it's pretty much filled up right
now.

A.46:  Oh, so you want a bigger one.

B.47:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Get an extra bedroom or a basement.  Right now it's just a,
a single level rambler.

A.48:  Uh-huh.  One thing about the houses in, uh, in Dallas, they don't, uh,
utilize basements the way they did in New York.

B.49:  [Sniffing]. 

A.50:  My parents in New York had, uh, a, uh, three family house.  

B.51:  Uh-huh.  

A.52:  Actual [noise] (( )) a,

B.53:  [Laughter]. 

A.54:  two family house where the, the, um, the downstairs and the second floor
they had, and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you
know.

B.55:  Oh.  

A.56:  And, uh, they had a basement, 

B.57:  [Sniffing]. 

A.58:  and they, you know, they finished the basement, and they were able to
rent that out also.  But, uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen
basements in houses.

B.59:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.60:  And I've looked at a lot of them, {very faint} ((you know)).

B.61:  Yeah, a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there, and that's
what he said was that, you know, it just wasn't something that people had down
there.

A.62:  No, it's a-,

B.63:  They put pools and garages on, 

A.64:  Right.  

B.65:  but, uh, no basements [laughter]. 

A.66:  I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.

B.67:  Huh.  

A.68:  And, uh, 

B.69:  Maybe it's all the sand.  Is there a lot of sand in, I always think it's
like a desert, I don't know.  [laughter] [sniffing] (( )) Dallas always, 

A.70:  Well, no.  [laughter] No, no, no, you know, I don't see that kind of sand
here.  Um, there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with,
uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit --

B.71:  Uh-huh.  

A.72:  -- into the, to the, uh, [lipsmack] or the foundation is sinking or
something.  You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.
But you, you have to know the right spot,

B.73:  [Sniffing]. 

A.74:  to, to pick where that doesn't happen.  

B.75:  Yeah.  

A.76:  And, {very faint} ((uh)),  

B.77:  Well, out here we, um, we live in what used to be, uh, like a prairie or
whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.

A.78:  Uh-huh.  

B.79:  And, uh, they, it's just, you go down four inches and you get to sands-,
well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone.

A.80:  Yeah.  

B.81:  And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
[laughter].

A.82:  I see.

B.83:  It's just solid sandstone.  

A.84:  Huh.  Where did you say you're at, Colorado?  

B.85:  No, Virginia.  

A.86:  Virginia, Virginia.  ((That's right)).

B.87:  Yeah, it's sort of unusual really.  Most of Virginia is clay.

A.88:  Anywhere near, uh, Virginia Beach?  

B.89:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.  [sniffing] Yeah.  My, uh, my folks used to live there.
Back before I was born,

A.90:  {Very faint}  Oh.

B.91:  they lived there.  

A.92:  Uh-huh.  Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind, in, uh, in
Texas I'll say because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.

B.93:  Uh-huh.  

A.94:  And, uh, in the, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't
see that.

B.95:  Yeah, well, uh, Texas is a big state so I imagine the, the type of houses
and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area [laughter].

A.96:  Yeah, well,  

B.97:  But, uh, [sniffing] that's the same way out here because, um, well, we, for
example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds 
Washington --

A.98:  Uh-huh.  

B.99:  -- and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty
thousand dollars more expensive.

A.100:  Yeah.  

B.101:  So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house
inside the beltway.  That's why we came out here.  This is called the, the,
the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C,
twenty-five --

A.102:  Huh.  

B.103:  -- from the city.  But, um, it's considered the country since it's, uh, you
know, that far out.

A.104:  Well (( )),   

B.105:  But, um, yeah, we live out by Dulles Airport.  

A.106:  I see.  

B.107:  Yeah, and, uh, [sniffing] that's one of the few places still in northern
Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
and, you know, it's, it's still pretty rural.

A.108:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

B.109:  Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.  Land has
gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like
that.

A.110:  So, is your house in an area by itself?  I mean, 

B.111:  No, we're in a development.  

A.112:  it's not connected to another one?  

B.113:  There's, uh, yeah, there's another one half an acre away,

A.114:  Oh.

B.115:  or a quarter acre away rather.  

A.116:  But it's not, they're not connected are they?  

B.117:  Oh, no.  Huh-uh.  You have to, uh, ((stay in one)) single family home.  I
sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up.

A.118:  Yeah.  

B.119:  Uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids but, um,
for the most part i-, they, they always had, you know, and Pennsylvania always
had a single family home and so,

A.120:  Uh-huh.

B.121:  you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home, and that's
all I ever knew growing up,

A.122:  Uh-huh.  

B.123:  so.  I stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up
enough money to, to get a,
