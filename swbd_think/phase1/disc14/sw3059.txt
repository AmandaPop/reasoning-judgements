==========================================================================

A.1:  [Tone] Okay.  Um, the last movie that I have seen, it's been, it's been a
couple of months.  I saw, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY --

B.2:  Yes, I saw that one.

A.3:  -- and FLATLINERS.  Those were the last two that I've seen.

B.4:  What was the second one?

A.5:  FLATLINERS.

B.6:  I didn't see that one.

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  Did you see those because of, uh, Julia Roberts, or [breathing] for, uh,
the subject matter of the two?

A.9:  Oh, it was just, well, someone had, I had seen the advertisement for
FLATLINERS on T V, and I thought I'd like it, and then, uh, one of my friends
who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, and she told me to go.  It was good.
So that's why I saw that one.

B.10:  Uh-huh [noise].  Well, I've, uh, [breathing] I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
and I, um, I've seen, uh, [breathing] ((well)), just recently, um, WHAT ABOUT
BOB?

A.11:  No, I haven't gotten to see an-, you know, any real recent ones.

B.12:  Well, that one is, uh, it's cute but kind of far out comedy.

A.13:  [Laughter] I like comedies better than I do dramas.

B.14:  Yeah, I, uh, am not one for the, uh, I don't need the suspense movies or
the,

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] the movies with lots of, uh, the horror movies with, uh,
trying to shake you out of your chair.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?

B.18:  Um, [breathing] I'm not sure [laughter].  I, uh, I saw it and, uh, because
my wife wanted to see it.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh, but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise, and
having gone, uh, well, it really wasn't on a theme that I was, uh, uh, that
into, or, as I say, th-, I prefer the light movies that, uh, my style of
entertainment is, is comedy, uh, primarily --

A.21:  Uh-huh --

B.22:  -- and then into action films.

A.23:  -- well, I didn't care for the movie myself.

B.24:  What?

A.25:  I didn't really care for the movie either.

B.26:  Yeah, you kind of have to like to be, uh, drawn to this point where you
aren't sure what's going to happen.

A.27:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, okay, on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN?

B.28:  Uh, yes.

A.29:  Do you enjoy that one?

B.30:  Uh, it was interesting, but I felt that one was a bit farfetched.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Uh, in that, well, I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the
one on, um, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.

A.33:  Oh, I haven't even heard of that one.

B.34:  Well, that was one where, uh, it's kind of like, to me it's somewhat like
PRETTY WOMAN.  The, the story line, um, if you accept a few of the basic
starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.  Uh, it was hard to accept
that, uh, this, uh, multimillionaire wheeler dealer would, uh, would, you
know, find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.

A.35:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, I really liked PRETTY WOMAN.  You know, I just, well,
you just kind of went with it.  Like you said, you had to accept the beginning
of it and just kind of go.

B.36:  Yeah.  It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.

A.37:  Yeah.  But, um, FLATLINERS, now, it's a drama, and I don't usually like
them, and I really enjoyed it.  I, um, I don't know, it was kind of, it made
you think a lot --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- I think.  Did you see GHOST?

B.40:  Yes.

A.41:  Okay, now, did you care for that one?

B.42:  Uh, that was, I enjoyed that one.  I, in that I, I guess I, I hate to be
too surprised in a movie, and in that one you could, you could pretty well
guess where it was,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  going to end up.  You weren't sure exactly how it would get there, but
you knew where it would end up.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  See, now, I didn't, I thought it was an okay movie, but it wasn't
something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  I didn't think so, um, I really didn't care for the ending of it.  I
thought it was just of like [laughter] you didn't know this was going to
happen, when, you know, but, um, I don't know, you know.  Well, of course, uh,
a bunch of girls had told me and warned me, and they said, "Oh, it's a real
tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da.  Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and
said well, when are you, when are you supposed to start crying, you know
[laughter].

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  I didn't really,

B.50:  Well, whenever she starts crying [laughter].

A.51:  Uh, I didn't really find it to be a tearjerker [laughter].

B.52:  Well, do you go to many movies more than once?

A.53:  Um, if I see them more than once, I see them on video.  I never pay to see
one more than once.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  You know.  But like you said, I, I enjoy the comedies a lot better.  In
fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Well, these days it's, uh,

A.57:  You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.

B.58:  Well, if you don't, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within
the first four weeks, the movie may have, uh, left town, never to show up
again until it comes back in video.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  So, uh, unless a movie is popular and stays around, uh, you probably will
see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.

A.61:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.62:  So we have, um, well, I think just most people have V C R -s now and we
probably watch twice as many movies at home --

A.63:  Oh, yeah.

B.64:  -- as we do at movie theaters.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  No, I saw one, it was a drama also, and I can't think of the name
of it now, that, um, it was a book before it came out in a movie, and it was,
it w-, it was a drama.  It wasn't a comedy.  Uh,

B.66:  Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES?

A.67:  No.  I wanted to see that.  I didn't get to.

B.68:  I, at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in
a, in a longer version --

A.69:  Oh, really?

B.70:  -- even though it was a long movie.  It's sort of the uncut version.  At
least that was some of the rumors.  We'll have to see, because it's, uh, there
was some talk about that.  I, maybe it will come out this fall.  There, we're
sort of in the middle of the summer, um, season of a lot of new movies coming
out, but then there's these, um, periods like early fall before Christmas or
early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something
out again, it, uh, will increase the revenues from the movie.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  Well, um, what movies are showing down there now?

B.72:  Oh, I, I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.  My approach to movies is
I kind of hear about them, uh, I keep track of them a little, but, you know,
ask me to name the ten that are out there right now, and I'd have to say, uh,
I, uh, I don't know.  I, I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go
and, 

A.73:  Yeah, that's pretty much what I do.  I, I know for sure that that one
about, what was that one about Bob?

B.74:  Uh, it's kind of,

A.75:  I think it's just,

B.76:  WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB?

A.77:  Yeah, I think it's just playing now up here.

B.78:  Yeah.  Because some of them, they, uh, they'll start in one area of the
country, and if they it's,
