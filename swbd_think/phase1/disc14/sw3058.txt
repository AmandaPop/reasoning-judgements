REMARKS:        A was a little hard to hear.

==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [lipsmack].  So, what books do you like to read?

B.2:  Well, all kinds, to tell you the truth.  Uh, [throat_clearing] mostly I
like, uh, [lipsmack], um, science fiction, science fantasy type books.

A.3:  Like, what, what authors?

B.4:  Uh, well, let me see, uh, well, the most, my favorite ones are kind of an
old author, Edgar Rice Burroughs.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And he had a, uh, series of, called JOHN CARTER OF MARS.  I don't know if
you're familiar with it or not.

A.7:  No, I'm not.

B.8:  But, uh, he's the one that wrote TARZAN OF THE APES,

A.9:  Okay.

B.10:  and all that too,

A.11:  Yeah, I heard of that [laughter]. 

B.12:  and, uh, and, uh, he, uh, he had one where this guy was a Civil War
soldier and, and, uh, made some trips to Mars and stuff.  I thought it was
really interesting.

A.13:  Oh, that's interesting.

B.14:  [Noise]  Plus I, I liked Pierce Anthony, uh, the one about, uh, ((Zanth)).
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

A.15:  No.  I re-, I have never, really never, never read science fiction much.

B.16:  And, well, that was more fantasy, I guess.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  And, uh, because it's kind of neat, because it has a lot of puns and stuff,
you know, in it,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  and so it's kind of funny too.  And then, uh, [breathing] then I like,
uh, what else do I have there?  Oh, it's a series of another fantasy but it's
Fred Sabber-, Sabberhagen, and it's the, it's, uh, THE SWORD SERIES.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Which I liked, and uh, GORE, I like too, it's another fantasy one.  And,
uh, starting, I think I'm going to start pick up a few, uh, more science
fiction as far as, well, as Isaac Asimov, I have a number of his books too.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  And H G Wells.

A.25:  That's older stuff.

B.26:  Yeah.  Uh, bu-, but I think they're pretty good.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  And, uh, and then I'm, I think I'm going to start picking up some of the
newer STAR TREKS, because I hear they're pretty good too.

A.29:  Yeah.  I had a professor at school whose sister wrote a STAR TREK epi-,
wrote one of those novels.

B.30:  Oh, really?

A.31:  That, yeah, as, under this fake name she wrote it in, since she's a
professor at another university, and it was kind of a hush hush thing that
she'd written this book, so we all had to read it for a sociology class.

B.32:  Do you know which, which one was it?

A.33:  So, um, no, I don't.  The author was like Madge Larson,

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  or something like that.  It was a kind of feminist STAR TREK, people on a
[breathing] it's, the woman had been a P O W in Vietnam,

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  who wrote it, and so she, she's one of the first female P O W -s,

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  and so she had, um, kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version
of it.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And it was ((kind of)) it was interesting, I don't know if it was
interesting just because I knew the person who had written it, or if it was
actually a good book.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  But I've never really read a lot of science fiction.  It's,

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Well, I sort of read mostly in high school and, uh, you know, and
I, and I like it, you know, as, as ki-, as the light reading and everything.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  And, uh, I recently, uh, completed graduate school, and I've really kind of
got interested through a number, a couple of classes that I took there on, on
history and stuff, and I've gotten,

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  a number of history books, but I haven't read any yet.

A.49:  Oh [laughter].

B.50:  You know, uh,

A.51:  But you've got them, so that,

B.52:  Yeah, but I've got them, and they're ready to go [laughter].

A.53:  Halfway there.

B.54:  That's right.

A.55:  That's good.

B.56:  But, uh, I was kind of getting into, you know, like, uh, you know, like
medieval times and stuff like that,

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  and just as to, just to do some reading about what went on and everything.

A.59:  Yeah.  I've, I've read a lot of medieval lit this year in school --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- a lot of, like took a class in Chaucer, so we were reading in the Middle
English and all that,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  and that was a lot of fun.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  Kind of weird but [laughter],

B.66:  Yeah, and what, what, which ones do you like?

A.67:  Um, well, I'm, uh, I like a lot of contemporary short stories.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  Um, au-, authors like Bobbi Ann Mason.

B.70:  {Faint}  Um.

A.71:  She's from Kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism
sort of stuff.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Um, John Barthelme, who wrote, he just died a few years ago, and he wrote
kind of weird avant-garde short fiction, and then, like in the sixties through
the late eighties --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- and he was kind of responsible for turning around the short story
movement, so that was [breathing] kind of neat.  Um, if I'm reading kind of
trashy stuff I like, um, I guess kind of mystery books, and then stuff that's
funny,

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  I like pretty much any humor book.  And [lipsmack] gosh,

B.78:  Well, I've got those, as far as humor, I've got a couple of Irma Bombecks
too.

A.79:  Oh, that's fun.

B.80:  Yeah, and then also there, there's another one, I don't know, you might
have read it, THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Yeah, there's a series, well, it was a trilogy with four books [laughter].

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  And, uh, have you read those?

A.85:  No, I, I, I have one of them sitting on my bookshelf,

B.86:  Do you?

A.87:  and I just never picked it up [laughter].

B.88:  Yeah, they're, they're pretty funny, because it's really kind of
interesting.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  And, uh, uh, those, those are kind of neat too.  And I've read, uh, I like
Steve, well, I like some of Stephen King.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  I, I'm not,

A.93:  I, I like him.

B.94:  really too, I don't really like his endings so much.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  But, uh, I think some of his books are pretty good.  And then there,

A.97:  Yeah, I used to,

B.98:  the other one that I've read a little bit is, uh [lipsmack] um, oh, God,
let me go look at his name here.  It's the one that wrote, uh, um, I can't
even think of his, let's see, (( )) here.  Oh, Clive Barker.

A.99:  Oh.  What have you read by him?

B.100:  Uh, THE BOOKS OF BLOOD and, uh, CABLE, CABLE, I guess how you say.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  Just, you know, some paperbacks and stuff.

A.103:  Oh, I've never read anything, I got a book of his out of the library just
the other day.

B.104:  Oh, did you?

A.105:  To try it out.  I'd been to England and thought, you know, he's like the
British Stephen King so,

B.106:  Uh-huh.  Well, I like him better,

A.107:  {Faint} Oh.

B.108:  than Stephen King.

A.109:  Really?

B.110:  Yeah,  

A.111:  {Faint} I'll have to,

B.112:  he, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good [laughter].

A.113:  Oh.  Well, he's next on my list to read,

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I'm reading a little private eye book now.

B.116:  And then, of course, I've read the, uh, Clancy books.

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  You know, uh, HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and,

A.119:  Oh, those are --

B.120:  RED STORM RIDING, RISING.

A.121:  -- the ones my dad keeps trying to get me to read, but I [laughter],

B.122:  Well, actually, you know, RED STORM, I haven't, I've started RED STORM
RISING, but, uh, I really recommend HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,

A.123:  #Uh-huh.#

B.124:  #because# it really, it's good and, and it keeps going pretty quick,

A.125:  Well, that's good.

B.126:  but the RED STORM RISING, I've heard, and then it's been apparent the
first, you know, few pages or whatever, it's kind of slow in starting and
everything.

A.127:  Right.

B.128:  But it's not a bad book at all.

A.129:  Well, that's interesting.  I read, I like MOBY DICK.  That's a [laughter],

B.130:  Yeah, yeah, actually,

A.131:  that's my big book that I like.

B.132:  I, I, I got an old copy of MOBY DICK that I like too, I read a while
back.

A.133:  That's one I just, my very, very favorite book, so,

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  if I had to go read something again, I'd probably read MOBY DICK or
SCARLET LETTER.

B.136:  Yeah.  

A.137:  I always like,

B.138:  Oh, probably liked STAR TREK TWO, didn't you?  [Laughter].

A.139:  No, I actually have never seen any of the STAR TREK movies.

B.140:  Oh, you hadn't?  

A.141:  Was that,

B.142:  TWO was really good because he quoted a lot from Moby Dick.

A.143:  Oh, well, that's interesting.  I had a roommate in school who did a, did
you ever see the movie HEATHERS?

B.144:  No, I didn't.

A.145:  Oh, it's, it's kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this, these
kids in high school who are not real popular, and they kill all the popular
kids,

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  in the class.  It's, it's kind of bleak, but it's sort of fun,

B.148:  Uh-huh.

A.149:  and they do a lot of MOBY DICK.  I had a roommate who wrote a whole paper
on MOBY DICK and HEATHERS and,

B.150:  {Faint}  Wow.

A.151:  I [laughter] I thought it was a little much, but it was kind of fun.

B.152:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

A.153:  I like John Irving.  That's,

B.154:  John Irving, yeah, uh-huh.

A.155:  He hasn't written much in a while, but when he does, I'm pretty happy with
it [laughter].

B.156:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 

A.157:  Yeah.

B.158:  That's good.

A.159:  I'm trying to think what else I've read that I've really just loved.  I
don't know how I, it's hard to read when you're in school,

B.160:  Yeah, yeah.

A.161:  it's like you just read those textbooks and that's it.

B.162:  [Laughter] I know, and that will have to do.

A.163:  But I guess maybe in the real world too, you just don't have time to read
but,

B.164:  Yeah, that's pretty much the way it is.  Usually I try to, I have some, a
book or two by the bed, and then maybe like I get to read for twenty minutes
before I go to sleep or something.

A.165:  Uh-huh, and then you fall asleep and have to reread it,

B.166:  Yep [laughter].

A.167:  the next night because you forgot what you've read.

B.168:  [Laughter] That's right.

A.169:  Yeah, I, I do that too.

B.170:  Yeah.

A.171:  Oh, I like Larry McMurtry.  He's good.

B.172:  Uh-huh.

A.173:  And like LONESOME DOVE was, it was a long book, but it was really good.

B.174:  [Throat_clearing] Well, I understand that Peter Benchley is coming out
with a new one.

A.175:  Really?

B.176:  Yeah.  I just read an article the other day, you know, uh, because I have
this JAWS book here,

A.177:  Uh-huh.

B.178:  and I think he's going to call it THE BEAST or something like that.  It's
about a squid.

A.179:  Oh [laughter].

B.180:  [Laughter]  So, you know, whether or not it will be as good as, you know,
JAWS was, I don't,

A.181:  I liked JAWS,

B.182:  I don't know.

A.183:  and THE DEEP and THE ISLAND, 

B.184:  Uh-huh.

A.185:  those were pretty good, so I would read that.

B.186:  Yeah.  JAWS actually, ha-, have you read the first one?

A.187:  Yeah.

B.188:  The book?
