===============================================================================

A.1:  Hi you want to start first [laughter]?

B.2:  Of course. We are talking about the elderly and,

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  uh, whether or not we wo-, we like nursing homes and,

@A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  as a matter of fact, I can tell you something about that. 

A.7:  You apparently have somebody there, in one.

B.8:  No, actually, my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years
and her mother,

A.9:  Oh, you are kidding?

B.10:  No, she did. 

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  for years.  

A.15:  I will be darned.

B.16:  And then, uh, went on back to school and became the director of nurses at
a nursing home [sigh].

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  And, uh, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.

A.19:  Oh, for heaven's sake.

B.20:  So, I do know something [laughter] about that.

A.21:  You are very, very much aware of what goes on.  

B.22:  Absolutely.  

A.23:  [Laughter] That is great.

B.24:  Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business,

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  was that her mother was very old,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  and couldn't seem to find companions.

A.29:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.30:  She was lonely.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  And she needed company,

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started
with eight ladies.

A.35:  I will be darned.

B.36:  And then, uh, it, it grew into a,

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.38:  very prosperous business from that point.  Uh, then they,

A.39:  Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.

B.44:  Well, that is not really true, either, uh, I think that is a stigma and an
I,

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences.  You see,
those who had bad experiences talk about them.

A.47:  Uh, right, right.

B.48:  And those who do not may write,

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  a letter to the nursing home and say you did good,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  but they do not talk a whole lot about that.

A.53:  That is true.  But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home,

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  when you are still able to have good,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  relationships with,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  maybe other friends --

B.60:  Sure.  Well now,

A.61:  -- they wait until they are, you know, unable.

B.62:  That is right.  Well, that is because they wait until the children make
those choices,

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  they choose to not make those,

A.65:  Right, right.

B.66:  choices themselves.  However, my daughter-in-law [sigh] also is a nurse
in a nursing home.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And, uh, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement
village than it is a nursing home.  And these, these,

A.69:  Uh, uh-huh.

B.70:  I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her.
"Well I am going for my,

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  tennis lessons.

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  And, uh, would yo-, would you, you know, call down and have the van come
around and take,

A.75:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.76:  us for our tennis lessons."  And they are very active and very enthusiastic
and they have,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  some excellent programs right there on site.

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  [Sigh] Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.

A.81:  Yeah.  That is great.

B.82:  Or, or one of the lovely cafeterias.  And they have, you know, pink linen
napkins for their dinners.

A.83:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.84:  And, [sigh] a well equipped library.  

A.85:  Yeah, that sounds great.

B.86:  Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home and I think when the, the
parent gets old enough,

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping
house,

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  and with taking care of themselves,

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  anymore.  That is a wonderful alternative.  

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  It is expensive.  It is costly.

A.95:  See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it
is,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  you, know.

B.98:  Well, now my daddy's mother, uh, lived in a, a retirement village and she
and her sister had side by side duplexes,

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  one bedroom duplex.  [sigh] She still had her individuality,

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  but they were there close and they did have, uh, you know, the button
that you could push the central office if you got into problems and,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  there were lights that you could flip on and so forth.  And they (( ))
have security.

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  No, I am very much in favor, I have heard horror stories,

A.107:  Oh, well you have that with anything.

B.108:  I know that the elderly can easily be abused,

A.109:  Oh ((yeah)).

B.110:  but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home
than are, they are in,

A.111:  In the homes, yeah.

B.112:  homes of their own children.

A.113:  Well, 

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  we used our nursing home as, uh, like when my sister was real bad before
she died --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- uh, we took her the last month and a half,

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  into a nursing home.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  And they were super with her.

B.122:  Absolutely.

A.123:  They were, uh, 

B.124:  Well now, my grandmother, of course all of my folks lived to be very old --

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  -- and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease,

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  when she was in her late eighties,

A.129:  Uh-huh.

B.130:  uh, late seventies, I mean.

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  [Sigh] She went to the doctor, she had surgery, she got the treatments and
during,

A.133:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.134:  the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a
nursing home.

A.135:  Uh-huh.

B.136:  She got better, she got well, she got out and went dancing again.

A.137:  Well, a lot of people do that.  ((They)),

B.138:  Uh-huh.

A.139:  ((left them)) temporally maybe they had a,

B.140:  That is right.

A.141:  broken hip or something or,

B.142:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I think it is a wonderful interim place,

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital,

A.145:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.146:  problems [sigh] and yet it is not, you know, you have,

A.147:  And it can become home to them. 

B.148:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.149:  It,

B.150:  It certainly is.

A.151:  It depends upon the individual.

B.152:  It certainly does, but, you see, we have had excellent experience with
that.  And, uh, I, I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became
ill, but,

A.153:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.154:  I would not object to going to one.  I might,

A.155:  Uh-huh.

B.156:  I might like to be, [sigh] uh, coherent enough to make my own choice.

A.157:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.158:  [Sigh] Uh, I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say,
"well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and,

A.159:  This is (( )) and,

B.160:  then dump me there.

A.161:  [Laughter].

B.162:  But, I would #like,#

A.163:  #There has to be#  consideration taken on everything.

B.164:  That is right. Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And I think you would shop for a nursing
home, just like you would shop for a church,

A.165:  Yeah.

B.166:  or a doctor or anything else.

A.167:  That is right, you would look into it thoroughly and,

B.168:  Uh-huh, sure.

A.169:  do, do the best job you could in choosing one.

B.170:  Uh-huh.  When you get to the point where you are in trouble,

A.171:  Uh-huh.

B.172:  and you have got to have that help, you are in no position to make those
choices.

A.173:  No and you do not have the time to look, that is what,

B.174:  That is right.

A.175:  I am saying, 

B.176:  Uh-huh.

A.177:  most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.

B.178:  Absolutely.  I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families
to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day,

A.179:  Uh-huh.

B.180:  and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with
community service.  Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft
programs, perhaps, work on some [sigh] music programs, #whatever their talents
are.#

A.181:  #Whatever their talents,# yeah.

B.182:  And work with,

A.183:  Uh-huh.

B.184:  those senior citizens.

A.185:  Yeah, I have a cousin who is, uh, she had a son that was epileptic from
birth, and he did fine,

B.186:  Uh-huh.

A.187:  at home, they lived on a farm, 

B.188:  Uh-huh.

A.189:  but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone,

B.190:  Uh-huh.

A.191:  she did not want her, her children, --

B.192:  Uh-huh.

A.193:  -- her other children burdened with his care.

B.194:  That is right.

A.195:  So he, they, she has made arrangements that when she, she was gone, that he
would go into the nursing home.

B.196:  Uh-huh.

A.197:  And he has, I would say, he adjusted very well and, uh, he, he, he has been
there quite a long time.

B.198:  Uh-huh.

A.199:  And, uh, he don't know me usually [laughter].

B.200:  Yeah.

A.201:  So, he goes wheeling down, uh, the hall to bingo.  Somebody else, ((is
helping)) him out,

B.202:  That is right.

A.203:  you know, 

B.204:  Uh.

A.205:  and, uh, he has adjusted very well.

B.206:  Well, one of the things, I think that is most desirable for the elderly
and that is routine.

A.207:  Uh-huh, oh yes.  Yes.

B.208:  Routine and, 

A.209:  Uh-huh.

B.210:  uh, constancy.  

A.211:  Uh-huh, uh-huh (( )).

B.212:  Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff
turns over. [laughter] I do not think they pay,

A.213:  [Laughter].

B.214:  the nursing home staff sufficiently,

A.215:  uh-huh.

B.216:  to, to get the dedication [sigh], 

A.217:  To keep them there, uh-huh.

B.218:  that they have in some other profession,

A.219:  True.

B.220:  and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the
most critical,

A.221:  Yes.  But (( )),

B.222:  And, uh,

A.223:  for some reason people resist, uh, the fact that they should be paid as
well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.

B.224:  That is right.

A.225:  It seems to be a resistance.

B.226:  Care for the elderly and care for the children, 

A.227:  Uh-huh.

B.228:  I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, 

A.229:  Uh-huh.

B.230:  a more, uh, better area to invest,

A.231:  Right, right.

B.232:  your money.

A.233:  #But there seems to be a resistance.#

B.234:  #You are# preserving your heritage and your future there.  

A.235:  Yeah, yeah.

B.236:  [Sniffing]. 

A.237:  So, uh, 

B.238:  And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's
programs in nursing homes.

A.239:  Well, around here, we have some, you know, the churches,

B.240:  Uh-huh.

A.241:  take your, the children and,

B.242:  Uh-huh.

A.243:  I know our kids thoroughly, the children thoroughly enjoy,
