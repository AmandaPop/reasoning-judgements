=======================================================================

A.1:  Are you ready to start?  

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Okay [throat_clearing]. 

@B.4:  Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?  

A.5:  Well, I just found out that my car {talks like an old woman} was thirty
months old, and it doesn't [laughter] seem like it's that old.

B.6:  Oh.  

A.7:  Seems like I just bought it.  

B.8:  Oh, wow.  

A.9:  It's an eighty-nine and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight so, yeah.

B.10:  Well, I really, I-, the last car we got was a, was a used car.  I really
don't prefer buying a new car.  I like to let somebody else pay for that
[laughter].

A.11:  I know, I really will do that the next time, 

B.12:  But, uh --

A.13:  I buy it too.

B.14:  -- mine was a year old,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  and we bought it for very functional purposes,

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  and that was we bought a station wagon.  We wanted an economical car --

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- to operate, but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.  So,
we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  And I've never been sorry, 

A.23:  Oh, that's wonderful.   

B.24:  however the need for that --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- kind of car has changed now, 

A.27:  Oh, okay.  

B.28:  and, uh, while it is still good,

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  and it's quite serviceable,

A.31:  Huh.

B.32:  and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.  

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  And probably then some [laughter]. 

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.

A.37:  Sure.  

B.38:  I think that I would like to, if I-, you know, we all say, if I could have
the car I always wanted --

A.39:  Right.  

B.40:  -- I would either buy a Nissan Maxima, uh, I'm sold on Nissans.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  I a or, or foreign cars actually.  Uh,

A.43:  But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American
abilities?

B.44:  Uh, 

A.45:  Is that how you, I have never,

B.46:  its reliability.  

A.47:  Its re-,

B.48:  Its reliability.  And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS
and things, and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars.
If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.

A.49:  Isn't that a shame.  

B.50:  But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed ((taps)) the day we
got it.

A.51:  My word isn't that sorry.  That's sorry.

B.52:  Uh, you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.  

A.53:  My word.  

B.54:  And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.

A.55:  Oh, mercy.  

B.56:  So, 

A.57:  You,

B.58:  and that was just trying to hold us, getting out of that was a used car.

A.59:  Huh.

B.60:  And it was an older car,

A.61:  Huh.

B.62:  but, you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record --

A.63:  Huh.  

B.64:  -- as far as sales.  

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  But it's just, it just was not deliv-, and you get stung a time or two,

A.67:  Sure.  

B.68:  and you say, no thanks.  

A.69:  No thanks.  That's right.  

B.70:  So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, 

A.71:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.72:  uh, reports inst-, had my son who knows a lot about that, study them
thoroughly, and he gave me four choices of cars to buy [laughter].

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  An Escort definitely was not among them.  In fact, there wasn't an American
car in there.

A.75:  Wow.  

B.76:  Uh, the Nissan came and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes
not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  But it served our needs.  Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he
studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the
area-, in the class that we were looking for.  And that, and I'd rather have a
Maxima than a Cadillac.  I really would.  It's not necessarily prestige,

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  but it's comfort.  Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are
desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car.  Uh,

A.81:  Who makes that car?  

B.82:  Nissan.  M-,

A.83:  I mean but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is
it, uh, Asian or is it European or who,

B.84:  No.  No, no.  Nissan is Japanese.  

A.85:  Oh, it is Japanese.

B.86:  Uh-huh, uh-huh,  

A.87:  Okay, 

B.88:  uh-huh.  

A.89:  I didn't know.  

B.90:  Yeah.  And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima -- 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- then I'd buy me a fancy little red ((C R X)) sports car [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter] Okay [laughter].

B.94:  I mean, you know, every othe-, every one of us have two sides [laughter].

A.95:  Yeah, I guess so that's true.  #Yeah.# 

B.96:  #Yeah.# Now what about you, if you could have the car that you wanted --

A.97:  If, if,

B.98:  -- what would you get and why?  

A.99:  if I had the car I wanted.  Gee.  

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
[laughter].

B.102:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah.  #See there,# 

A.103:  #But I,# I don't know the performance of it.  That's a, 

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  Ford product, 

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  and, you know, 

B.108:  Uh-huh.   

A.109:  I would get hung up by my boot straps if I ra-, 

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family.  

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  [Laughter]. 

B.114:  I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best,

A.115:  Yeah, 

B.116:  that was made.  

A.117:  yeah.  

B.118:  Really was.  

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  And, uh, I, I really have not seen, now a lot of the American cars actually
are, are, parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice
versa.

A.121:  Can I put you on hold for one minute?  

B.122:  Of course.   

A.123:  Thank you.  {pause} Well, that was one minute.  They hung up.

B.124:  Okay [laughter]. 

A.125:  [Laughter].  

B.126:  Uh, at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features
that you would be looking for?

A.127:  Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car.

B.128:  Uh-huh.  

A.129:  Um, and the luxuries of a large car.  

B.130:  Uh-huh.  

A.131:  Uh, now color preferences, I think I would opt to go with a bronze.

B.132:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.133:  Which is probably closest to gold that you can get [laughter].

B.134:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  [laughter] We like the stuff that glitters [laughter].

A.135:  [Laughter]  Yeah.   

B.136:  Good.  

A.137:  [Laughter].

B.138:  There's nothing wrong with that.  Actually I think probably if I were going
to get a-, if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be,

A.139:  Right, well, #practical yes that's,# 

B.140:  #I would prefer# white.  

A.141:  Uh-huh.  

B.142:  Because, simply because it's more visible at night.  

A.143:  Right and it's cooler I believe, 

B.144:  And,

A.145:  too, 

B.146:  Uh-huh.  

A.147:  when you're driving in,

B.148:  Uh-huh.  Now the interior, okay, I don't care about the interior just as
long as it's not black or red.

A.149:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.150:  [Laughter]  But if I had the little red ((C R X)), 

A.151:  [Laughter]. 

B.152:  I guess the interior would have to be black leather and I'd have to live
with that.

A.153:  [Laughter]. 

B.154:  And if I got the ((C R X)) it would have to have a real good sound system
in it because I'd want that too.

A.155:  Oh.  

B.156:  I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to
the wind [laughter].

A.157:  Um, can you, uh, hang on again hon-,

B.158:  Uh-huh.  

A.159:  Thanks {pause}.  I've got the phones for lunch hour.  

B.160:  Uh-huh.   

A.161:  [Laughter]  So.  

B.162:  [Laughter].

A.163:  Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.  

B.164:  That's okay.  

A.165:  Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music, or do, is it talk shows.

B.166:  No, no, no.  I generally would p-, uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, I
listen to K C B I a lot but I will listen to the news and the, and the traffic
and those things at work.

A.167:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.168:  But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time,

A.169:  Uh-huh.

B.170:  I want some real good classical music.   

A.171:  Uh-huh.  

B.172:  I love classical music, and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a
good sound system to produce all the,

A.173:  All the, yeah.

B.174:  all the characteristics of the instruments.  

A.175:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  

B.176:  So I do love classical music or it li-, or, or, uh, 

A.177:  Do you listen t-,

B.178:  contemporary classical.  

A.179:  Do you lik-, listen to W R R?  

B.180:  Uh-huh.  

A.181:  Huh.

B.182:  Sure do.  

A.183:  Yeah.

B.184:  W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to,

A.185:  Uh-huh.

B.186:  more than anything else.  

A.187:  Uh-huh.

B.188:  And I do like them.  And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car.
That would be,

A.189:  #Those are nice, aren't they?#

B.190:  #something that I would really like.#  

A.191:  #Yes, those are nice.#  

B.192:  #Those compact discs,#

A.193:  Uh-huh.

B.194:  really are good for cars because they don't melt, they don't warp.

A.195:  Uh-huh.  

B.196:  You know, [laughter] there's nothing in there that can wrap around the,
the, uh, rollers or anything.  It seems like a really good answer to portable
music,

A.197:  Huh.

@@B.198:  that you can choose.
