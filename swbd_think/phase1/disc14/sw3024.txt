===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, do you have a large house or do you live in an apartment or, or
like,

B.2:  Well, we live in, uh, it's a single family home,

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  and, I guess it's, uh, it's kind of, well, sort of big for the area, um,
and it's got four bedrooms and two and a half baths and, uh, it's on a
cul-de-sac.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  How about yours?  

A.7:  Uh, well, we have a pretty large home and, uh, it's larger than the average
house, you know, in the area.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  But, um, we need a large home cause there's twelve kids in my family.

B.10:  Wow.

A.11:  So, uh, we have five bedrooms, uh, two kitchens, two full kitchens, uh, we
have two and a half baths, also, you know.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, plus we have a full basement that's in a, into a game room that's
wall to wall carpeting.

B.14:  Wow.

A.15:  You know, um, we have, uh, it would be like a, I do not know, I guess it
would be like a family room, other than from the playroom, the playroom is
where we watch all our T V and stuff,

B.16:  Huh.

A.17:  but we have another room, you know, kind of like for company and stuff.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  Uh, gee, let me think {very faint} that's about all, but it's all split
level.

B.20:  Split level house.

A.21:  Yes.

B.22:  Okay.  Well, ours is a ranch style and, uh,

A.23:  Oh I like ranch style houses.

B.24:  we, we had a townhouse here, we still have a townhouse which we are
renting out, so this is our first, uh, I guess, single family home.  And so,
we find that we have, uh, a lot to do, uh, to fix it up to the way we like it.
A lot of remodeling and all.

A.25:  Uh-huh. 

B.26:  Mostly cosmetic, and we had a, a deck put in in the back, so it looks, you
know, that's real nice,

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  to go out in now, and then a fence around the yard so that the kids can
stay in the yard [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And not run around in the neighborhood.

A.31:  Well, how much, uh, land did you get with it?

B.32:  How much what?

A.33:  Land.

B.34:  Uh, I think it was a quarter acre.

A.35:  Is it?

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  We have almost an acre.

B.38:  Really.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  Well that's a pretty big area.

A.41:  It, it's funny, because we have, uh, a, a two stall garage right beside our
house, but you can fit four cars in it, it's long enough, you know, you can
fit four in.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And some people that do not know us, ask which house we live in [laughter]
and it's like, oh, ((they must be)) (( )) car garage.

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  [Inhaling] Then, uh, we have a front porch and a back porch on our house.
Our back porch, we enclosed.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  But, that's kind of like another room on itself.

B.48:  Uh, okay.  Well, what we have, our family room and, we bought it, we
noticed that it was really dark, and one of the things that it has in it is,
uh, real dark paneling, wooden paneling.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  And, uh, it also has brown carpet, and just kind of, uh, two small windows.
So, what we are thinking of doing is, uh, uh, changing the carpet to a lighter
color, and then we have heard, that with the paneling, you can wallpaper over
it --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- or paint it.  And so, that's what we are planning to do is to put a
chair rail across the family room, paint or wallpaper from the chair rail up
and then, uh, paint the chair rail on down in, like a light blue color sort
of, I guess.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Uh, Williamsburg blue, we are calling it, but whether there's a color like
that or not, since we are near Williamsburg.  But, uh, we are hoping
[inhaling] that will lighten up the room a lot, and make it, give it, you
know, give it a bigger appearance.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  It has a fireplace in it, too.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And if that does not work, we, uh, our next door neighbor is a roofer, and
he said he would help me put in a skylight, so --

A.59:  Oh, yeah.  

B.60:  -- we will try that last resort if, uh, if the painting does not help.

A.61:  Yeah, well all our walls are light, you know, well they are plaster --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- except for our, you know, in the basement, the playroom, and we have,
um, it's a real light brown, you know, kind of like a tan.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And, uh, the carpet is pretty light, too, so it's, it's, it is a pretty
large, you know, playroom.  And th-, the lighter colors do help, makes it look
much bigger than what it really is.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  What kind of carpeting do you have?

A.67:  Um, it, it has different colors in it, but when you first look at it, it
just kind of looks like a brownish color.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  You know, it has like browns and yellows in it.

B.70:  Oh, okay.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  Is it, uh, is it a real short or a thick carpet.

A.73:  Real short.

B.74:  Real short.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Okay.  Because we were looking at something people are, we have seen
advertised called, I guess, it's Berber or something, or Berbar or something.
And, uh, and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family
room, cause it's, you know, it wears really well, and all that.

A.77:  Yeah.  See, well, because we have so many, with a real thick carpet, with
so many of us, it gets worn down too fast.

B.78:  Right, right.

A.79:  So, uh, most of the carpet in our house is the short carpet.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  (( )), well we just got our, uh, like where, where we have company and
stuff,

B.82:  (( )).

A.83:  we just got that recarpeted and we think it's, uh, bigger carpet,
[children] you know, the longer thicker stuff.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  But, uh, [child_talking] as the little ones were starting to move out and
stuff so, you know, there's not as many of us here now.

B.86:  Right.

A.87:  [Child_talking] Uh-huh.

B.88:  The other thing we are learning a lot about is, uh, we have a craw space,

A.89:  [Child_talking].

B.90:  under the house.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  And, we are learning a lot about moisture free and, uh,

A.93:  [Child_talking].

B.94:  everything like that.

A.95:  [Child_talking] Uh-huh.

B.96:  So, uh, as far as, uh, keeping the vents open and closed, you [child] know,
this is all new to us, not having a house that had this before and, uh,
keeping the vents open, you know, during when it's warm, and the summer, and
all that, and I guess spring, summer, fall and I guess in the winter you close
the vents and, uh, and making sure that the rain, the rain gutters from,

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  you know the roof,

A.99:  [Laughter].

B.100:  and all, empty out into the yard instead of right near the house.

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  And things like that.

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  So, we are,

A.105:  Well we have a wood burner in our house and --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- you know, it heats a lot of it, because (( )) it is a larger house, it
would be too much to heat with just electric.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  But, uh, we have,

B.110:  A wood, a wood burning stove.

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  Is it in the middle of the room or against the wall?

A.113:  It's against the wall.

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  Uh, it's down in the basement, and it's kind of like in and enclosed little
room by itself.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  My dad enclosed it off, so you kind of go into another room to it.  Uh, but
we had to learn to keep, like al-, all the bedrooms are two floors above it,

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  and we had to learn to keep all the, [child] the rooms were shut on the
first floor for the hot air to get up to the bedrooms,

B.120:  Uh, okay.

A.121:  for like in the winter and stuff.

B.122:  Right.

A.123:  Yeah [baby].

B.124:  ((Wow,)) that's pretty neat.

A.125:  [Baby] But, uh, [baby] I guess, do you have much mowing to do with yours
then?

B.126:  Much mowing.

A.127:  Yes.

B.128:  Yeah, well, actually it's a lot bigger than we thought it was [laughter],

A.129:  [Laughter].

B.130:  when we first saw it.

A.131:  [Laughter].

B.132:  When you actually have to mow it, it seems to get bigger.

A.133:  [Laughter].

B.134:  But, uh, the mo-, the way ours is, it's kind of a pie shaped, uh, you know,
boundaries or whatever, and we are sitting against the pointy end of the pie,
the house sits back and it, uh,

A.135:  Oh.

B.136:  so our front yard is actually the bigger yard.

A.137:  Uh-huh.

B.138:  And, uh, and when we first got here, you know, there's it, it, I guess a
long time ago it, uh, you know, we were talking to our neighbors and they said
the yard was one of the bet-, or the best yard in the neighborhood, because ((
)) really kept it up and over the years, uh, just people were just renting it
out and all that, they, a lot of weeds and all that have grown up.

A.139:  Oh yeah.

B.140:  And so we have decided to get somebody for one year of service to help
control the weeds and get it green again, and then I will take over from
there.

A.141:  Uh-huh.

B.142:  And so, but I have to mow it at least once a week or else it looks bad.

A.143:  Yeah, well,

B.144:  So,

A.145:  uh, it, well we have just an acre, we, uh,

B.146:  Use a rider.

A.147:  Yeah  [laughter].  

B.148:  [Laughter].  

A.149:  Yeah, definitely.

B.150:  [Laughter].

A.151:  And, uh, well my mom hates dandelions so we had stuff on our yard, you
know.

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  But it's, uh, it's pretty green, she likes a niche green yard,
