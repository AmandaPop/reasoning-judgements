===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do you like to listen to music?

B.2:  Oh, I like to listen to music.  I just am not a very educated person when
it comes to music.

A.3:  Well, I'm not either, as far as Bach and Beethoven and all that [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter]  Wh-, what do you like to listen to?

A.5:  Well, it's really strange.  I like country music, and my husband likes the
older rock and roll stuff, so,

B.6:  Okay.

A.7:  we've had to kind of educate each other [laughter].

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  That's been kind of strange.

B.10:  Oh, I'm sure.

A.11:  Yeah, but being in, from, from Austin, you'd think you get a lot of good
country music.

B.12:  Well, I'm not originally from Austin,

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  I'm from Minnesota, so,

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  it took me moving to Texas to start liking country music [laughter].

A.17:  Yeah, that's true.

B.18:  And now I really do.  I'm, I'm really, becoming Texanized.

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Well, have you ever gone to AUSTIN CITY LIMITS?

B.22:  [Lipsmack] I haven't, but I watch it on, I watch it on, um, television
sometimes,

A.23:  Uh-huh. 

B.24:  and, and, uh, I've taken country western dance lessons.

A.25:  Oh, you have?

B.26:  Oh, yeah.

A.27:  Did you like that?

B.28:  I love it,

A.29:  Oh, yeah.

B.30:  I absolutely love it.

A.31:  Yeah.  I took that in college one time as an easy course [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter]  And, uh, oh, yes, I definitely am, am much more into country.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Um, so, you, you, which, uh, singers do you like?  I mean, I can actually
name singers, I'm,

A.35:  Oh, really?

B.36:  I'm not too bad.

A.37:  Well, naturally, I, I like George Strait,

B.38:  George Strait.

A.39:  and, uh, and Garth Brooks went to the same college that I went to, and he
used to play in a little dive there in town [laughter] when --

B.40:  So you know him from,

A.41:  -- when he was a nobody.  No, I don't know him personally, but I do
remember going to see him when he was a nobody.

B.42:  Well, that's great.

A.43:  Yeah.  But I went to see George Strait when George Strait was a nobody too.

B.44:  Wow.

A.45:  So, yeah, I've kind of followed them.

B.46:  Well, who are you going to go see now?  I mean, who do you see now that's
going to be somebody someday?

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  Well, I really like, um, what's his name?  Jackson.  What's his first name?

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  I can't think of his first name.  He's a blond guy and he sings, um,
[lipsmack] Alan Jackson.

B.52:  Oh, Alan Jackson.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  Um.

A.55:  He has some kind of fun country tunes.  But, you know, it's really funny,
because country music has changed so much from when, like I remember in
driver's ed in high school, that, that my teacher always liked to listen to
country music as we were driving, and I thought oh, God, this stuff is
horrible [laughter].

B.56:  Well, okay.  Well, maybe it just has changed and maybe,

A.57:  It really has.  I mean --

B.58:  it's more accepted all over.

A.59:  -- country music is a lot easier for people to break into, as opposed to
other fields of music, so I think a lot of people start out in country and,

B.60:  Right,

A.61:  then try to,

B.62:  and then you, you know, you kind of think of ALABAMA,

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  you know, that kind of brought everyone into a more country and,

A.65:  Yeah, definitely. 

B.66:  and, you know,

A.67:  Yeah, I used to go see them.  They weren't nobodies then, but I did go see
them before they got to be major big stars,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  so it was fun.  But,

B.70:  Kenny, Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country and kind of rock, you know.

A.71:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember, because when I was taking driver's ed is right
when YOU PICKED A FINE TIME TO LEAVE ME, LUCILLE came out,

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  and it seemed like every other song on the radio was that song [laughter].

B.74:  Had to listen to that one again [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  But it's fun.  I really, I, I enjoy listening to it.  I, I keep my radio on
at the office, but I don't, you know, I don't have it turned up real loud,

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  unless it's a really good song [laughter].

B.80:  And then you ju-, you, you pump up the volume, yeah.

A.81:  Yeah, just a little.  See, it's real funny, because the guy that I work
with is from, um, New Jersey, and he is trying to learn now about country
music.  He's gotten to where he really likes it, but he doesn't know any of
the names of the people or,

B.82:  From New Jersey.

A.83:  Yeah [laughter] just,

B.84:  ((Yeah)) that's great.

A.85:  Yeah.  I was so amazed.

B.86:  That's like about the farthest call from country music,

A.87:  Yeah [laughter].

B.88:  you can get.  Oh.

A.89:  But he's got, he's real funny, because his office is across from mine, and
so he'll turn up the radio real loud and say, "Who's this singing?"
[laughter].

B.90:  Oh, that's great.  Where do you work?

A.91:  I work for a computer company.

B.92:  Oh, that's super.

A.93:  Yeah.  It's, it's fun because it's small enough that we can do stuff like
that,

B.94:  So you can do things like that,

A.95:  and get away with it so, 

B.96:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm, I'm being envious.

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  One thing that I did in music that, I mean was a big extravagance for me,
but I have two daughters that are eleven and fourteen and,

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  Whitney Houston just came to town,

A.101:  Oh, really?

B.102:  and she was coming to town the same day that my daughter was getting her
braces off,

A.103:  Oh, wow.

B.104:  so I, and I really like her, so I thought well, [lipsmack] we'll, we'll
go buy tickets, and this is how we'll celebrate getting braces,

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  off teeth.  And she really, she really, I, I wouldn't say it was the, a
great concert.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Not that I've had that many, but I know it wasn't a great concert, you
know.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  But it wasn't a bad one either.  And the one thing that I really
appreciated in going to hear her sing in person is,

A.111:  [Noise]. 

B.112:  her extreme volume for that tiny little body,

A.113:  Oh, really?

B.114:  you know, and she really does have to work to get it all out [laughter].

A.115:  Oh, yeah.

B.116:  And you'd, you wouldn't catch that, you know, off of a [lipsmack], a C D
or a,

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  cassette, you know.   

A.119:  Well, did you happen to see her, um, welcome home show on the H B O for the
troops?

B.120:  I did not, no.

A.121:  She had so much energy.  I mean, she danced and danced and danced
[laughter].

B.122:  Yes.

A.123:  And I thought golly, that's like a two hour aerobic class [laughter].

B.124:  I know, I know.  So that, that was really, really fun.

A.125:  Yeah, that would be neat. 

B.126:  {Faint}  Uh-huh.

A.127:  I didn't know she was going to be in Austin.

B.128:  Yeah.  That was just last week.

A.129:  Wow.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  Huh.  Well, that's neat.

B.132:  So we had a good time.

A.133:  Yeah.  Well, are you familiar with Don Henley at all?

B.134:  I'm not.  

A.135:  He, um, used to play with THE EAGLES.  Have you, do you know anything about
him?

B.136:  I know EAGLES, uh-huh.

A.137:  Okay.  Well, he was one of the original EAGLES, and he's broken off now and
gone solo, and he was in Dallas Saturday night and put on a wonderful concert.
He sang,

B.138:  Wow.

A.139:  for like three hours, and he sang a lot of old stuff, and a lot of his
new stuff, so it was really exciting.

B.140:  Well, you know, now that you mention it, I probably ha-, would know, you
know, know,

A.141:  Yeah.

B.142:  a song of his.

A.143:  I'm sure your daughters do [laughter].

B.144:  Oh, yes.  I, well, they're, you know, they know everything, and then they
always ask me if I know,

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  sport figures too, so I'm a real flunky [laughter].

A.147:  [Laughter] Well, I, in fact, I had older singers so, or older, older
singers, older sisters,

B.148:  Oh, so they kind of,

A.149:  so I got to li-, I got to listen to HERMAN'S HERMITS and all that stuff,

B.150:  [Laughter].

A.151:  so that was fun.  And it's, but it's really funny now because I'll, I'm
going to be thirty in August, and it's sad because I listen to the oldies'
station and I know all the songs [laughter].

B.152:  I know.  I know [laughter].

A.153:  It's kind of depressing [laughter].

B.154:  It is.  It's, it's sad when you reach that age.

A.155:  I know [laughter].

B.156:  But you're not doing bad.  I have a, a good friend that, I mean, she's much
older than I am.  She's, I think probably fifty-eight, and she's really up on
all the new music,

A.157:  Oh, really?

B.158:  even better than I am.  And, and I mean, she just likes music,

A.159:  Yeah.

B.160:  and she's just a person that's really with it.  So maybe you'll be like
she is.

A.161:  Well, I hope.  It's really funny, though, because I'll be at the club
working out and I'll hear the aerobics music going and I'll think God, that's
a remake of an old song [laughter].

B.162:  Right, right.  [breathing] And it really gets bad when you can remember
what you (( )) oh, I remember,

A.163:  I know, remember there is an old [laughter].

B.164:  That's right [laughter].  Oh, and we're, we're just getting to that age,
where we date ourselves all over the place.

A.165:  Oh, I know.  It's pretty sad.  But it's real funny with my husband too,
because he really likes older rock and roll so, 

B.166:  Did he really like BEATLES?

A.167:  Yeah, he, I mean, he's got BEATLES and CROSBY, STILL AND NASH,

B.168:  Uh-huh.

A.169:  and, you know, all those songs that, that my sisters no-, I mean, my
sisters listen to BEATLES, but not any of the other ones.  I mean, like he
likes SANTANA and some kind of off the wall ones, so,

B.170:  [Laughter].

A.171:  I'm getting indoctrinated to a new, a new, uh, line of music.

B.172:  You're picking up some new stuff.

A.173:  Yeah.  It's fun, though.  We have a good time because,

B.174:  Oh, it is.
