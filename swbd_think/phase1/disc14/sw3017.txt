REMARKS:       Both speakers bleed through.  There was a little bit of 
line noise on Speaker B in the third conversation.  It was a little tough 
now and then due to the fact that both speakers overlapped each other, 
but I was still able to hear what was said in the separate conversations.  
They strayed a little off the topic towards the end.

==========================================================================


@A.1:  Okay.  Well, I worked out today [laughter]. 

B.2:  Well, I didn't [laughter]. 

A.3:  You didn't?  Do you, do you ever?  

B.4:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.5:  A lot?  

B.6:  I end up being, uh, we're fixing to go on vacation so, 

A.7:  Oh.  

B.8:  I'm running here and there and everywhere and ...

A.9:  Yeah.  Well, that's a workout in itself getting ready to go.  So, huh.

B.10:  Yeah, it, th-, the recorder came on I went, oh, boy, d-, how do I miss
today because I thought if I'd be there right now [laughter],

A.11:  [Laughter]. 

B.12:  I couldn't have taken this call [laughter]. 

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  So, my guilt feelings come rushing through.  But,

A.15:  Do you go every day?   

B.16:  Uh, usually, yeah, I try to.  

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Um, go to, I have a membership at Fit-, Fitness and Figure World here.

A.19:  Oh, really?  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  Is that, is that male and female?  

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Yeah, mine is just female.  I'm too big of a wimp to go to the male and
female [laughter].

B.24:  Well, it's, it's, it's kind of like, oh, your split-level house.

A.25:  Oh, really?  

B.26:  Its got the male stuff on one side, uh, and then it has a Nautilus
equipment that male or female can use.  And then it's got your aerobics room
which is coed, and then it's got the female side which has all their Nautilus,

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  that they can use by ((theirselves)) and their own sauna.  

A.29:  Do a lot of the guys do the aerobics?  

B.30:  Uh, no.  Not, 

A.31:  Just mostly female?   

B.32:  most of them, most, it's mostly female.  

A.33:  Have they been, have you done the bench, bench aerobics yet? 

B.34:  Oh, yeah, the steps.

A.35:  Do you like it?  

B.36:  I'm still not sure about it yet.  

A.37:  Yeah.  I've a, 

B.38:  Um, I, yeah, I'm too busy concentrating if I'm going to twist my ankles or
something.

A.39:  [Laughter].  Fall off the bench.  

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  Yeah.  Because I have broken both my ankles, 

A.43:  Oh, no.  

B.44:  so I'm real leery about, you know, 

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  stepping and looking and,

A.47:  Well, I, I read an article that it's really not that good on your knees.

B.48:  Well, I didn't, I don't know how it could be.  

A.49:  Yeah.  So, 

B.50:  Um,

A.51:  I haven't, I haven't ventured with that yet.  

B.52:  I'm, I'm thinking it may be just a fad,

A.53:  Yeah.   

B.54:  and will pass with everything else.  

A.55:  But in our classes there's a ton of people that do it.  

B.56:  Oh, yeah.  

A.57:  And they do it, I think they only have it like three times a week because I
think that's what they pretty much recommend.  But still, uh, I think that
would be so hard on your knees.

B.58:  Yeah.  Uh, 

A.59:  So.  

B.60:  [barking] and, you know, the boxes get pretty tall.  

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  And I, um, I don't know I haven't got to the tallest one yet and it hasn't,
[barking] the, I did, uh, when I first started it bothered my knees behind my
knees.

A.63:  Huh, that's strange.  

B.64:  That's the only place I was sore, and I thought, well, I must not be doing
them right or,

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  or something because that I have no need for that muscle back there
[laughter].

A.67:  Yeah, really.  I can't ever think of when you would,

B.68:  So.  

A.69:  use that.  Huh.  

B.70:  So, I'm, you know, I can see where it, because it effected my knees.

A.71:  Wow.  

B.72:  And I did regular aerobics like last night with, without the boxes,

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  and I got more of a workout -- 

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  -- and it was a no bounce class.  

A.77:  Oh, really?  

B.78:  And I still got more of a workout as far as in, you know, stamina,
etcetera.

A.79:  Huh.  Well, I was a cheerleader for a long, long time so I don't get into
the aerobics at all because it's too much like cheerleading, so I mostly just
ride the bike,

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  and do the weights on the machines.  But I do, they have aquacise which I
like that quite a bit.

B.82:  ((Now I've been to that)).  I haven't been to that yet, uh, I've, I've it
jus-, it just doesn't move fast enough for me I don't think.

A.83:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you know, 

B.84:  I've got to have something hyper.

A.85:  it varies from instructor to instructor, but if you get a good one, you
can get a pretty good workout.

B.86:  Really?

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  I've never tried it so I guess I've, I ought to try it before I think it's
not fast enough.

A.89:  Well, yeah, you'd think with broken ankles that would be a good way to go
because you don't get that friction when you land.

B.90:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.91:  Huh [lipsmack].  Well,

B.92:  I've never,

A.93:  [Laughter]. 

B.94:  I guess I ought to try.  I don't know, it just never appealed to me,

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  as much as, as, as, uh, just for real hard aerobics does for some reason.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  And, and then the weights and I'm really, um, like in the, the step
machines.

A.99:  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Do y-, is it a Stairmaster?  

B.100:  Uh, I'm not sure what it is.

A.101:  Because see the one that we have isn't Stairmaster so it's not quite as
good I don't think.  But, um, it's, it's real good for you, but, boy, they say
that you're supposed to go twenty minutes and I can't do that.

B.102:  No.  

A.103:  I've been trying to work up to it but I can't.  

B.104:  Oh.  When they first started me, I had a girl who was training me, and
she'd only been there three weeks.  And she says, well, you just push this
button and you turn the dial and you just go.  And I'm like one side would go
down and then the other side and I thought i-, and these guys on each side of
me are just pumping it like, you know.

A.105:  [Laughter]. 

B.106:  And I'm going there's got to be something wrong here and the guy looks over
and ((says he's)) got you started on ten [laughter].

A.107:  Oh, no.  

B.108:  So let's turn it down.  

A.109:  [Laughter]. 

B.110:  And then I was keeping up with him, you know, but it was funny because I
thought I am like in slow motion compared to everybody around me,

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  what i-, and I felt like way out of shape.  

A.113:  [Laughter]. 

B.114:  And it just happened to be the dial was wrong but ...

A.115:  [Laughter].  You must ((go in the)) evenings?  

B.116:  Yes.  

A.117:  Yeah.  

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  I attempted going in the mornings, and it was really good because then it
was out of the way and, you know, and nothing interfered, but it's just so
much harder to get up that much earlier.

B.120:  Yeah.  I am more, I used to do, I used to run in the mornings.

A.121:  Oh, I hate running.  

B.122:  And in, I'm just much more stretched out by the evening -- 

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  -- from work and everything, 

A.125:  Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.  

B.126:  because I was really having, uh, backaches and stuff, 

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  when I'd get halfway through the day I couldn't figure out why.

@@A.129:  Huh.  I hadn't thought about that.  Well, my other problem was I'd get to
the club and I'd be getting ready to go to work and I'd realize I didn't have
my blouse or something [laughter].

B.130:  Oh, yeah.  

A.131:  So that was always kind of traumatic.  

B.132:  Yeah, it could be.  Of course, I don't know it could be great for business.

A.133:  Yeah, I wo-, I did.  I literally went in one day in my linen skirt and a
sweatshirt [laughter].

B.134:  Oh, my gosh.  #So,#

A.135:  #So# anyway.  Well, enjoy your vacation.  

B.136:  Well, I'm looking forward to it.  

A.137:  Where you going?  

B.138:  Uh, we're going to San Diego.  

A.139:  Oh, that will be fun.  

B.140:  Yeah, I have family that lives out there so.   

A.141:  Oh, well, have a good time.

B.142:  Well, thanks.  

A.143:  I'm sure you'll look fine in your bathing suit.  

B.144:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.145:  [Laughter]. 

B.146:  Oh, we have a lake party this weekend so, 

A.147:  Oh, really?  

B.148:  I'm really kind of going, ugh,

A.149:  Yeah.  

B.150:  But, 

A.151:  Well, it was for, one thing I haven't, we've, we've been in the water a
lot.  We have a boat and we skied a lot, but I just haven't brought myself to
ski yet this year so,

B.152:  Yeah.  I've, 

A.153:  maybe, 

B.154:  I've,

A.155:  maybe this weekend.  

B.156:  Yeah, if it's good.  We've, we've been out a couple times and gotten into
the swing of it so we're, {very faint} we're ready.

A.157:  Which lake do you go to?  

B.158:  We go to L-, we stay here, ski here Lake ((Beltin)).  

A.159:  Oh.  Huh.  Well, I'm, is it a big one?  

B.160:  Yeah.  

A.161:  We might have to check that out, 

B.162:  Yeah.
