===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you use your credit cards very often?

B.2:  Um, no, not really, we use gas cards --

A.3:  Okay --

B.4:  -- more than anything,

A.5:  -- is that just out of habit or convenience?

B.6:  Uh, basically convenience --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- uh, which led to habit, I guess.

A.9:  Okay, I don't use gasoline credit cards.  I used to have one, but I didn't
use it, uh, I used it so seldom that I'd get letters from Mobil, uh, reminding
me that I had a credit card to use.

B.10:  Oh, really.

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  Yeah, we don't, we don't ever, we don't carry a whole lot of cash with us,
so we use the, the gas cards because our families are both out of town, and
like when we travel and stuff, we use the gas cards.

A.13:  Right.  So you basically use them as an alternative to carrying cash.

B.14:  Yeah, yeah.  And then we have, uh, an American Express that's through T I
that Steve uses just for T I stuff.

A.15:  Are you, uh, solicited a lot, uh, for other, uh, credit cards?

B.16:  Yes, yes, a lot.

A.17:  What, uh, criteria do you consider on whether or not you'll accept a
particular card?

B.18:  Probably the, uh, uh, if there's a premium each year, and the, uh, the A P
R.

A.19:  Yeah, I won't get a card if there's an annual fee.

B.20:  And there's, it's, it's kind of hard to beat T I. 

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  And so, you know, usually we just trash it, tear it up and trash it and --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- most of the time it goes unopened.  We just,

A.25:  I, I think that Texins is charging thirteen point nine percent --

B.26:  Yeah, if, if that much --

A.27:  -- uh, interest.

B.28:  -- they're thirteen something, but I'm not sure if it's, I think it's a
flat thirteen right now.

A.29:  It could be, could be.  I don't, uh, use them often enough to even keep
tabs on them.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  But most of them charge between eighteen and twenty-one percent per year.

B.32:  Yeah --

A.33:  I think that's,

B.34:  -- and then you're, then you're, if you're that lucky, you get to pay them
another twenty-five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty-one
percent a year [laughter].

A.35:  Right, right.  And I look for a grace period too, so that they don't charge
interest on --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- from, from the day of purchase.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  And of course, no annual fee.

B.40:  Yeah, that would, that would help a lot.  I, I'm not even sure why, I mean,
the purpose of an annual fee.  I'm not really,

A.41:  Well, I, I think it just generates revenue for the companies that, uh, for
the banks that sponsor the credit cards.

B.42:  Well, I guess so, because it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it,
as far as getting another card where you don't --

A.43:  No.

B.44:  -- you know.

A.45:  Uh, I get, uh, applications for cards from, oh, different places for
various reasons.  Uh, I got an application from Home Depot for their card --

B.46:  Oh, really.

A.47:  -- and, uh, the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on
your first purchase with that credit card.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  So I got that card just so I could, uh,

B.50:  Have ten percent off,

A.51:  make a major purchase.

B.52:  if you got to use that credit card.

A.53:  Right, and get a discount on it.

B.54:  Yeah, that,

A.55:  I did the same thing with, uh, Foley's.  They, uh, uh, had a fifteen
percent discount --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- on a purchase if you just apply for a card.

B.58:  Right.  I did that with my husband, uh, he was off working at T I in Austin
one day, and so I went out to the mall to kind of look around, and hit
Mervyn's and found some stuff after Christmas on sale, and ended up getting
fifteen percent off --

A.59:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.60:  -- already off of it already whatever it was lower, and I think that's the
only card I have that's, you know, recently, is gotten a Mervyn's card and --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- I used it for, I think, for the first time when I was in Houston this
weekend, and I have, I've had it for months.

A.63:  Yeah, I always maintain a zero balance, uh, don't like owing anybody
anything [laughter].

B.64:  Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't like it a whole lot either.  Uh.

A.65:  If you want to borrow money, there're better ways to do it, uh, I think you
can get a loan through the credit union for about, uh, oh, I don't know, nine
or ten percent now, I guess.

B.66:  Yeah, yeah.

A.67:  And uh, keeping a credit cards, uh, charged up is just not a very good way
to, uh, to make use of borrowing money.

B.68:  Yeah, I never understood how people could, I mean, there are some people
who say well, I can't charge it, it's at it's limit.  And I thought, gol, how
can you charge a credit card to its limit.  It just, it just, I guess it's
that, that, you know, lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that
says pay later, you know.

A.69:  Yeah, it's the buy now, pay later plan, and, uh --

B.70:  Yeah, and I just, it's the,

A.71:  -- live for today.

B.72:  Yeah, it just bo-, worry about it tomorrow.  

A.73:  Nobody bothers saving any money.

B.74:  Yeah, and it just, I don't, I don't really go for them.  And I, in fact, I
had my own before we got married --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that T I had lower rates.

A.77:  Sure.

B.78:  You know, and decided, and, I mean, when I tried to close with Chase
Manhattan, it was just like pulling teeth.

A.79:  Oh, yeah.

B.80:  I mean, I couldn't close, they'd send me a statement every little, this is
your new, you know, balance with bonus points or whatever,

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  you know, and it's like, Look, I closed this months ago --

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  -- and I don't want any more of your letters, I don't want anything, and
Well, you have a credit balance.  Well send me a check [laughter] --

A.85:  Yeah, well, there's a --

B.86:  -- you know. 

A.87:  -- a basic problem, too, with not using credit cards that they are good
credit references.  When I closed on my house mortgage, uh, the mortgage
company was looking for, uh, references, credit references --

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  -- and I didn't have any credit cards charged up at all.  

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  I keep the balance paid off, so they make lousy credit reference then.

B.92:  Yeah, yeah, they do.  But, we, we were in, in that same boat a couple of
years ago, and they had said, well, just list your major ones and the balance
still owed on it --

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  -- you know, or give it a balance still owed on it.  And that's all we did.

A.95:  When the balance is zero, it doesn't help much.

B.96:  Right, right.

A.97:  I get a lot of, uh, preapproved applications from various organizations
and,

B.98:  Yeah, and it's like, 

A.99:  I throw all those out.

B.100:  well, who are you to approve [laughter] something for me without my
permission anyway.

A.101:  Right.

B.102:  But I think, um, I think what you can do as far as, I don't think as many
companies, when you are a good customer, I don't think they report that as
much as they should their delinquent customers.

A.103:  Right, uh-huh.

B.104:  Because a lot of times you have to write and ask them to report it to the
credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit, as far as, you know,
paying off, you know, your cards early, or on time, or whatever.

A.105:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

B.106:  That usually doesn't happen unless, I've heard people say, well, you have
to write to ask that, and I say well, you know, if someone's so quick to turn
you over because you're thirty days late --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- I think they, they should do, do that more often.

A.109:  Yeah, I think you're right.  Uh, (( )),

B.110:  What do you think about that, uh, Discover card?

A.111:  Well, uh, [laughter] funny thing about the Discover card is I just pulled
a, uh, one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired, uh,

B.112:  [Laughter].

A.113:  last month.  I didn't cash it.  Uh, they, they sent me a dollar, uh,
refund from last year's purchase.  I, I used it one time --

B.114:  Oh, really.

A.115:  -- and, uh, I got a dollar credit, a dollar check, but I didn't, uh, cash
the check, and the check expired, but on my last statement I noticed that they
credited my account with a dollar credit.

B.116:  The dollar you didn't cash.

A.117:  Could very well be.

B.118:  Oh, oh, well, I was wondering how that, that worked, because it's like, you
know, we'll pay you for, I'm going wait a minute, you know.

A.119:  I've got so many, uh, well, I don't have a lot of cards, but I've got a lot
that I never use.  I stick basically with, uh, the Texins MasterCard, and, uh,
very seldom use the American Express card.

B.120:  Yeah, we don't, we wouldn't even have one if it wasn't for T I and Steve's
traveling --

A.121:  Sure, corporate card.

B.122:  -- we just, you know.

A.123:  I would never pay thirty-five dollars or more a year for, uh, use of a
card.

B.124:  No, and, uh, we basically just have the, we, you know, we cut up a lot of
cards when we, you know, like it's just as easy, just to use two, you know,
instead of paying so much ...
