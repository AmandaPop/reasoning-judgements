============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [noise] wow, I don't know what that was.

B.2:  What was that?

A.3:  I don't know [laughter].

B.4:  And, uh, to, uh, [throat_clearing] the Brazos River --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- near Dinosaur Valley State Park.

A.7:  Oh, yes.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  Uh-huh, uh, we have not camped in any of those places, in fact it has been
a number of years since we have camped, but we used to go to Tyler State Park
and, uh, Daingerfield and in Texas that is where we camp basically.  Uh,

B.10:  What are they like?

A.11:  They are very nice.  Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.  It has
a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful, uh, sights that are in
the wooded areas.  Uh, the facilities are quite nice and our children liked,
liked it quite well.  Uh, the kids are, well they are quite a bit younger
than, and you know they, we felt real safe with their being able to do what
they would like to do there in the area.  And, uh, it was just, it was just a
really nice place to camp.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, now Daingerfield is, let's see, I think that's a little bit mor-, more
east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.
No, I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.  At any
rate it was, it was very nice as well.  But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled
with, I think.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But, uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, uh, had done a
lot of camping in Michigan, I think the upper peninsula of Michigan,
especially, and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the
mountains, so, uh, my parents were real avid campers (( )) and my husband's
parents were really avid campers as well.  So I guess we just kind of came by
it naturally [laughter].

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  Do you have a large tent or,   

B.18:  [Sigh] [noise] Yeah, it was a nine by twelve.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  And how many does it sleep, uh, comfortably?

B.22:  Well, there, well supposedly, they always say it sleeps more than it does.

A.23:  Right [laughter].

B.24:  But th-, they, it would have slept three adults anyway.

A.25:  Yeah, 

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger,
uh, we invested in some stacking, uh, cots, you know, that were like bunk,
bunk beds, but they were cots, fold up cots.  That really gave us a lot more
space, um, floor space and, [sigh] so, you did not have to be constantly
getting things off the floor in order to walk around and,

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day so that was real nice.
But, uh, we, uh, like, my in-laws also had a camper, or, uh, a pop up tent, you
know, one of those trailer tops and those are really nice too.  A little more,
uh, luxurious, so to speak, [laughter] but not much [laughter].

B.30:  Di-, do they have a kitchen in them?

A.31:  Yes, uh-huh.  It's really nice, in fact, it even had, had a little
refrigerator, uh, and the whole business.  It was quite nice in that respect.
[sigh] Uh, and everything was very convenient and you did not have to, to be
hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,

B.32:  Trunk #of your car all time, right.#

A.33:  #and that was nice.# [sigh] So, uh, do you have plans for, for any other
camping trips in the near future?

B.34:  Uh, maybe, uh, maybe back to Caddo, or,

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  Uh, Purdis Creek.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  Or, I like Bob Sandlin too, it's a new park.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And there is, uh, not really camping, but, [throat_clearing] uh, what is it
called, Cedar Hill.

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  Lake Joe Pool.

A.43:  Oh, yes.

B.44:  And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.

A.45:  Yes, yes, I have been in that area.  That is a really pretty state park.
Uh, just, we did not camp there, but we drove through it just one time when we
were in that area and it's real lovely.  It's close to the lake and close to,
I think it's close to the dam up there so it's, it's really quite pretty.  Uh,
are you, um, let's see what was, I was going to ask you something else.  Oh,
do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?

B.46:  Oh, fr-, from those three, just, just, uh, from when I have been an adult,
I like Caddo the best.

A.47:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in
the State of Texas?

B.48:  Yeah, that's right.

A.49:  I, I would, I have never been there and I would love to see what it looks
like [laughter].

B.50:  It's not, it's not very deep.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And they did build a dam on it, but it was there before they built the dam.
It has been there for a hundred years.

A.53:  Oh, I see.

B.54:  Apparently, an earth quake caused it.

A.55:  How interesting.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  I guess I never heard the history of that.  Huh, well, that might be some
place where my husband and I can go.  We are talking about starting camping
again in the fall.  Um, our children are both grown and, and so, it's just
pretty much the two of us who do things.  And so, uh, we thought we might take
some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see
what it looks like.

B.58:  Yeah, it's really nice.

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.

B.60:  And I, I don't know, probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere
#in Texas.#

A.61:  #Is it?# Uh, yeah, I think so.  Especially with, uh, uh, when the trees
start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  especially in East Texas, it's really nice.  So, uh, [sigh] well, I, um,
I have enjoyed talking with you.

B.64:  It was nice talking to you.

A.65:  And, um, have, uh, some happy camping trips [laughter].

B.66:  (( )).

A.67:  Hope you get to those places you have talked about.

B.68:  Yeah, you too.

A.69:  Well, okay, thanks.

B.70:  Bye,

A.71:  Uh-huh, bye-bye.
