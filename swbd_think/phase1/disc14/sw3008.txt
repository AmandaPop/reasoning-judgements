REMARKS:        Both speakers tended to ramble on every now and then.

=========================================================================

@A.1:  Uh, fringe benefits are very important in the comp-, in the company I
think to provide the employee with a sense of security.

B.2:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  Do you agree with that or [laughter], 

B.4:  Oh, absolutely on-, oh, you talk about benefits I can't think of one more
important than, than the, you know, the medical.

A.5:  Yes, at the rising cost of, 

B.6:  Insurance, right.  

A.7:  health, uh, care now it's, uh, if you have to go out and buy your company
coverage you probably have to spend three, four hundred dollars a month,

B.8:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

A.9:  to get anything that even came close to it.  

B.10:  That's right.  And, uh, even have dental, dental insurance now which is
really good.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  So, uh,

A.13:  We, uh, we've just got dental insurance after the first of the year.  It's
been, I think, probably, oh, about eight or nine years since we had dental
coverage, and it, it sure makes a difference [lipsmack].

B.14:  It, it really does.  And, uh, uh, well, let's see, insurance, I, I guess
that would be one of the real biggies,

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  you know, #to a consideration.# 

A.17:  #I think, the,# in the insurance area one of the things that we also got
that we didn't have befo-, what we haven't had in about eight years is the
card for prescriptions.  Where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for
prescriptions.  And, uh, we have some that are fairly expensive, sixty,
seventy dollars.  Well now we pay eight dollars for them.

B.18:  But with, um, paying twenty percent?

A.19:  Uh, no that's just all prescriptions, uh,

B.20:  I know, well, see, if you had a seventy dollar, a, okay, that would save
you.

A.21:  Yeah.  And it's a, I think it's five dollars on generic drugs and eight
dollars on a name brand drug so no matter what they are, in fact, you have to
pay the certain basic cost.

B.22:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.

A.23:  For them you don't have to meet any deductible or anything. 

B.24:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  But, uh, 

B.26:  How about paid time off?  

A.27:  Uh, yeah, that's, uh, just vacation and some sick leave.  Not very much
though [laughter].

B.28:  Do, uh, do you have a certain number of sick leave t-, you know, days that
are available to you or, or is it,

A.29:  W-, we-,

B.30:  pretty much just depends on your supervisor?

A.31:  Uh, really depending, uh, on what you need kind of.  It's a case that
there, if you need more than a couple weeks or eight days or whatever it may
be then they, they will consider it.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  So, that's been with the companies I've been with generally at a, a
executive position they're a little more liberal.  Even though they're not
supposed to b-, supposed to treat everyone the same still (( )) rule more
liberal with time off due to the, all the extra hours executives put in.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  But, uh, the, uh, I think pension costs are making it more and more
difficult for them to provide ((print)) pension benefits too.  It's, uh,

B.36:  Oh, that's right.

A.37:  Yes, because it just keeps going an up, up and up there too.  But, uh,
there's,

B.38:  Yeah, we-, d-, as you get closer to that time you start, #you know, you
start becoming,#

A.39:  #Yeah, the older you get,# the more you start thinking about,

B.40:  all excited.  You know ((I can't)),

A.41:  the polic-, [laughter] pension.  

B.42:  remember when that, who cares [laughter], 

A.43:  Right, righ-,

B.44:  so.  Now I think, oh, wait, what's, 

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  what's, maybe we better start getting serious about that.  

A.47:  Yeah.  Uh, my son has worked for a company for about six year, he graduated
from college, what, in eighty-six, so five years this fall.  And he started
out with, they had a four O one K plan, and he asked me if he should get into
it, and I said, well, very small amount, uh, you can put in there and you keep
adding to it and they're going to match it or so.  And [breathing],

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  all of a sudden at the end of last year he had a sizable amount saved up
in his four O one K plan.  Just with the matching funds that the company is
putting in and any earnings on investments.  So,

B.50:  But, he can't touch that though,

A.51:  No, no, he can't,

B.52:  right?  

A.53:  but he's only, uh, twenty-seven years old, and he's already got a good
start.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  Even if he changes companies he can, you know, roll that over,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  into another plan.  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  You know, we had, I had that too there's a certain percentage of
your salary and the company matches it fifty percent not ha-, not, not
half-and-half.

A.59:  {Very faint} Yeah.

B.60:  I meant, they don't match it exactly,

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  but fifty, fifty percent which is good.  

A.63:  Um, I wish I had a company that did that [laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  But there's, oh, there's various intangibles also like, uh, you know,
taking pride in the company you work for.  Being able to say I work for such
and such company, or I hold such and such position with this company.  And
that's one of the intangible fringe benefits, I guess, a certain ego level
there.

B.66:  Your company has a lot of prestige?

A.67:  Well, it,

B.68:  ((But)),

A.69:  not the one I'm working for now, but one I did in the past did,

B.70:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.71:  so I, I just felt, you know, at a, I need to find a company like that
again [laughter].

B.72:  Well, another thing our company does is as far as, uh, like, uh, taking
classes either within the company,

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  or them offering classes to us or, or, or external.  You know, they pay,
qui-,

A.75:  {Very faint} Uh-huh, pay tuition and books,

B.76:  Pay, yeah.

A.77:  or a portion thereof.  

B.78:  And, uh, check, they, we, I think w-, we have a mandatory, we spend at
least ten days a year not or not, well, yeah, about something like that, uh,
in taking classes and they're offered within T I but you have, we have
((training)) plans.

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  Everybody does.  So, I mean they really, you know, I, I think, uh, our
company really has a lot of good, really good benefits.

A.81:  Oh, what you can find there is so many of these things like, uh, working
for a company some of the things they really enhance your experience in case
you do have to change companies.

B.82:  Oh, really.

A.83:  Yeah, I mean, it's a, just makes you that much more salable shall we say
[laughter].

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  If you do have to go and search for another position.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  Everything you, everything you learn you, it's
yours.

A.87:  It's right.  That's right.  

B.88:  And you, it goes with you wherever you go,

A.89:  {Very faint}  Yeah.

B.90:  so the more you learn, 

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  the, the better off you are.  

A.93:  The company I used to be with also took care of things like professional
dues and subscriptions to like the WALL STREET and other professional
((man's)) magazines in the financial areas so it, uh,

B.94:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.   

A.95:  There are, there are more than just insurance and pension.  There's lots of
other things that come up.

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  Back in the heyday of the economy before this recession, then, of course,
there were other things available to other people.  I never even took
advantage of them of, uh, like memberships and clubs the people that, uh, have
to entertain and such.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  So there's all sorts of fringe benefits [laughter]. 

B.100:  That's true.  So salar-, salary is,

A.101:  {Very faint}  Yeah [breathing].

B.102:  salary is what we do work for and #have to have.#

A.103:  #Ye-, that's right.#  

B.104:  That's our initial, 

A.105:  It keeps your mortgage,

B.106:  motivation.  

A.107:  holder happy [laughter].

B.108:  Huh?  

A.109:  It keeps your mortgage holder happy.  Ye-,

B.110:  That's right.  That's right.  

A.111:  Having to, salary, an-, again be, uh, uh, being able to acquire the, the
nicer things that you want.  Not just have to live at a, a certain level.
Being able to do things or purchase things --

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  -- that you want that aren't really necessary.  

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

@@A.115:  So, um, that's about all I have.  

B.116:  Well, I guess that, I guess we've pretty well exhausted that.

A.117:  Okay, fine.  

B.118:  Well, nice talking --

A.119:  Been nice talking with you.  

B.120:  -- nice talking to you.  

A.121:  Good-bye.

B.122:  Bye [beep].
