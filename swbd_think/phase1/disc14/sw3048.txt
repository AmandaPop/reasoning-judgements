=============================================================================

A.1:  The, uh, Vietnam War was, uh, certainly expensive, not only in, in cost
but, in, uh, the long term effects as far as lives go.  Uh, when I was, oh,
seven or eight years old and just into, uh, first or second grade or so, I was
sitting there wondering whether this war would ever stop and whether it would
last another five or six years and I would end up in it.  And, uh, I, I kept a
little bit of an eye on it.  I had older sisters that was not, was not worried
about going in to it, but, they had boy friends and the like that were
concerned and so, it struck home a little bit from that standpoint.  We didn't
have any service people in Vietnam, there, in the immediate family so, uh,
just the whole idea, though, of, of what we were over there for and, uh, the
very unpopular problems that occurred here, the riots and the protests.  And,
uh, it just didn't seem to go over well with the general public like the last
one did.  Uh, it, it raised it to the forefront of, of a lot of our thinking
back then.  So, uh, I, I would tend to say that it was not worth it.  But,
then it's easier looking back at, at the fact that we virtually lost, if you
want to call it that.  It's easy to say "well yeah, it was not worth it"
considering the results.  Now, had we won, and it had been quick, uh, maybe it
would have been different.  But,

B.2:  I don't think so [laughter].

A.3:  I'm not really all that familiar, I never was a Vietnam buff.  I'm not all
that familiar with the beginning of it.

B.4:  Well, my father, my father was in Nam.  My brother was in Nam.  You, you
know, I had a lot of friends in Nam.  So, it's like, it hit, it hit pretty
close.

A.5:  Well, do you think the reasons are any different than, than what they did
in,

B.6:  The reasons that they did it now and the reasons that they did it then are
still the same.  There is it's --

A.7:  Uh, just somebody invaded and they decided to go help, huh.

B.8:  -- it's, yeah.  The only difference is, is the people here, the people now
is going to back there, but, see they, you can't take, like the, you know,
they, they are acknowledging the Vietnam vets now but, that's not going to
work.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  Because, they are, they were already misused when they came back and they
are not going to forget that.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  So, you know, and I know my brother won't, he spent a lot of time, so he
came back totally screwed up.

A.13:  Um.

B.14:  So, you know, I, I blame a lot on Uncle Sam because of the fact, you know,
they had it in your living room, and,

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  stuff like that.  And I don't, I didn't like that at all.  Because, it
makes you worry more.

A.17:  Yeah, and I never thought about that.  The news coverage might be worse
than it, you would be better off not knowing, I guess.

B.18:  In a way, it is because, then you don't have to really worry (( )).  That,
or if you see something and you, you think it's your child or you think it's
somebody,

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  you know and they are dead and then, you know, you done went haywire for
nothing.

A.21:  Right, right.

B.22:  So, it's just, it's, I think the war then was just as useless as it is now.

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  But, you know, should I, it, it's not really useless, I guess really
Saddam, if they were going to do it, I think they should have just kept going.

A.25:  That's true.

B.26:  Instead of half doing the job.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Because, the people still over there is in trouble.

A.29:  Yeah, it makes you wonder if, if they had had the same mentality in Nam if
they would have been able to, to just wipe out the thing, you know, go all
out, if it were,

B.30:  Instead of doing all this political stuff, that's half the problem,

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  it's too much politi-, politics involved in a war.  You know, they tell
you "you can't do this", but, you know what, everybody else does not do like
the United States.  People don't listen.

A.33:  That's right.

B.34:  They say we could not do certain things to them, but they could do
everything to us.

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  You know, and that's what makes it bad.  

A.37:  The business about not going into Cambodia was, that's bad news [laughter].

B.38:  Yeah, but they did, you know.

A.39:  That's right.

B.40:  So, you know, it's like uh-huh, sure.  Great, whatever you say.

A.41:  So, just blow up any part of the country that they are occupying,
regardless of the boundaries.

B.42:  Just like Storming Norman, they should have let that man loose.

A.43:  Yep.

B.44:  They should have just let him loose in the city.  He would have just
cleaned house. I think he would have done better,

A.45:  Um.  Well, that's, uh, 

B.46:  So. 

A.47:  I wonder what the, I have not even looked at the cost, I wonder if the cost
was anywhere comparable as far as what they spent per day, or what they spent
per month, in Nam versus what they spent here.  It's almost like we moved an
entire organization, the cities and all.  All the support team, all the,

B.48:  Oh, yeah.

A.49:  everything over there, whereas in Nam, it was kind of a little at a time,
but it was so protracted, I, I guess the average cost of a month was probably
less back in Nam than it was,

B.50:  Yeah, it was,

A.51:  this time.

B.52:  ((plus)), it was less, but still, 

A.53:  I don't know what the,

B.54:  if you take it back then and do the, do the, do the, uh, what do y- call
it, 

A.55:  Cost of living adjusting, yeah.

B.56:  the average, the cost of living there and do it now and do the cost of living, it
still gonna cost you money.  It uh  cost you about the same.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  So.

A.59:  I just did not know how much support they gave them, uh, they did not have,
well, like in this one, they did not have a whole lot of U S O type stuff 
(( )) put up or, build buildings for.  It was all temporary.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  But, there there were bases that had permanent installation, as far as,
entertainment and services went.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  So, I guess that cost a bit.

B.64:  So, you know, see the ships, people don't realize it, but the ships and all
that scuff, that's still over there.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  And then you think about it Vietnam is how old and they still have
prisoners of war.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  See, I don't think that is right.  I think the United States should,
((but)) they put down and go over there and be and just go through it, period.
You know, find out where they are, some people know, the government knows.

A.69:  Yeah, they certainly should not --

B.70:  That's the bad part.

A.71:  -- continue to deal with them as far as monies go.

B.72:  No, but here we are, you know, Saddam would not have been so bad if we had
not gave him half the stuff he's got.

A.73:  [Laughter] Yeah, there is already talks of, you know, dealing with the
again, it won't be long.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  Yeah, I guess it's,

B.76:  Well, he will be back.

A.77:  I don't know whether it's better to know what your enemy has or [laughter]
or, you know, fight against something you know is there or not let him have
anything.  I think I would rather not let him have anything.

B.78:  Why give him the same advantage that you have.

A.79:  Yeah, certainly sell him,

B.80:  Okay.

A.81:  lesser equipment.

B.82:  Yeah, but nothing new.  But, he had modern equipment, scud launchers, I
mean, let's get real here,

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  those are ((mile long)) missal launchers.

A.85:  They do make a mess.

B.86:  And then United States is not going to use them.  Yeah, right,
uh-huh [laughter].

A.87:  That's true.

B.88:  So, you know, it's like, what do you want to do first.

A.89:  Well, we certainly made a, a mess out of the areas that we bombed in the
latest war.  Too bad they could not do that kind of concentration on, uh, in
Nam.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  They just were not allowed.  It took years before they would even allow the
bombing.  That is kind of political.  [laughter] I have no other words for it.

B.92:  Nope, there's nothing else you can do about it.  It is just, you know, I
think they should have done more than what they did over there, and I still
think they should have done more than what they did over in, uh, Saudi Arabia.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  Because, to me, the United States went both these places and they made it
worse for the people that is there.

A.95:  Um, that's true, that's true.

B.96:  So, it depends on if you there you can see it, if not, then you will never
know, cause in the United States, people never know what's going on.  They
just take whatever they get told.

A.97:  Take whatever they are fed on the news and --

B.98:  That's right.

@@A.99:  -- and go on.  Well, I've got Mr. Carruthers waiting for my attention, so
I had better let you go.

B.100:  Mr. who?

A.101:  John Carruthers from Plano.

B.102:  Oh.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  Tell him hi.

A.105:  All right, will do.

B.106:  Okeydokey.

A.107:  Bye.

B.108:  Bye.
