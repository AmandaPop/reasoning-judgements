=============================================================================

A.1:  Arch, how are you doing tonight? 

B.2:  Good.  And yourself? 

A.3:  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  Kind of tired. 

B.4:  Yeah.  Me too. 

A.5:  Where am I calling? 

B.6:  Pardon me? 

A.7:  Where are you? 

B.8:  I'm in Lewisville.

A.9:  Lewisville.  Okay, I'm in Garland.  [lipsmack] Um, have you read
anything about how they propose to, uh, come up with the taxes to increase the
funding for schools?

@B.10:  A little bit. 

A.11:  What do you think about it, equalization of funding?  [TV] {in
background} [breathing] {heavy}.

B.12:  That's a hard issue to decide, um, on the one hand, you don't want to have
to take away.  But, on the other hand, you don't want, uh, the poorer school
districts to go under either.  And, uh, here in Lewisville, they had a thing
on the ballot that they wanted to, uh, rollback the taxes on everybody's
houses,

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  and everybody would save, uh, twenty dollars a year, or whatever but it
would cut back to one million dollars in, to the schools.  And, I happened to
know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it
because that would just take away all, all their money.

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  And, as far as I'm concerned, you know, hey, twenty bucks a year is not too
much too me, and they could raise a few more dollars and get better, uh,
things for the schools.  That's what we need.  Because we got,

A.17:  [Breathing] {heavy}.

B.18:  you know, Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because
we got little kids and we're, uh, not too pleased about that.

A.19:  But we're not funding them like other states either, though. you know it?

B.20:  Pardon me? 

A.21:  We're not funding our schools like other states either.

B.22:  That's true. 

A.23:  That's right.  But just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean
that's going to solve the problem.

B.24:  Yeah, I know, 

A.25:  I mean, I think there's a lot {loud breathing},

B.26:  that's, that's only part of the problem.

A.27:  of waste in, in schools.

B.28:  I think we're going s-,

A.29:  I'm a teacher [laughter]. I feel that,

B.30:  Are you? 

A.31:  Yes.  I def-,

B.32:  Okay.

A.33:  definitely feel that way.  All this,

B.34:  #I think were going to see a day com-,#

A.35:  #money that's being paid for it's administrators.#

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  Huh-uh.  I can,

B.38:  I think, I think we're just going to see a day when s-, uh, grade schools
are going to be charging tuition, just like colleges are.  Uh, and it will
only be to those who are having kids going to school, that's probably the most
fair way.  But, you know, uh, that way old people don't have to have, have
money going into their schools because they don't have little kids going to
schools.  But, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few
years, uh, that sort of thing happening.  And, uh,

A.39:  Well,

B.40:  we'll see what happens. 

A.41:  they're already talking about freedom of choice, you know, for schools,

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  that's an idea. 

B.44:  Yes.  Um, I don't know.  That, I think, has pluses and minuses, because,
uh, those that are economically disadvantage won't have the ability to make a
choice [laughter].

A.45:  That's true. 

B.46:  The choice will be thrust upon them.  And so where is the freedom of
choice?  No, freedom of choice in that case and that's,

A.47:  But like in Garland [child_yelling] you can choose [child_yelling] the
school that you're going to.  [laughter] Can you tell this is past bedtime?
[laughter] Um, like in Garland, they get to choose the schools that they are
going to go to, but they got to have the transportation to them if it's out of
their district, you know, out of their area, I mean.

B.48:  Yes. 

A.49:  So, and I like that,

B.50:  Yes. 

A.51:  because you can find out the good schools in your area.

B.52:  I think the only way they're going to really get to the problem and solve
it is to have equal funding for every school in the state, whether you, it's
in a poor tax district or a high tax district, and, uh, that's the only way
that I can see it's going to be resolved, is there are going to be people in
the rich district that are going to fight that and, and it's going to be a
real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem.

A.53:  So, just distribute it equally,

B.54:  Yes. 

A.55:  and not raise taxes?

B.56:  And they said give every teacher a, a hundred percent raise.  Tha-, that's
the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a
good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay
enough.  I mean, when I was in college, I did a lot of teaching, uh, for my
degree, and, uh, I got a lot of good out of that and I liked teaching, but I
really couldn't go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for
me to do so.

A.57:  Yeah.  What do you do? 

B.58:  I'm a mathematician. 

A.59:  Oh, so you picked a good field then.

B.60:  Pardon me. 

A.61:  You picked a good field. 

B.62:  Oh, I don't know. 

A.63:  Well.

B.64:  There are better fields to pick. 

A.65:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  

B.66:  I mean,

A.67:  But that's not a bad one. 

B.68:  Yeah, where I, you know, the kind of stuff I do, I, I use my education
quite a bit, but where I was before I wasn't using it hardly at all.  So it
all depends.  I mean, it depends on where you wind up, I guess.  But I really
enjoyed teaching it.  You know I, I wouldn't mind getting back into it
someday, but, who knows what will happen in the future.  The way people are
being laid off right and left, it's all a matter of, uh, what happens next.

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  But, uh, ba-, back to the taxes, though.  I mean, uh, it's, uh, a difficult
issue.  No one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand, you got to do
something.

A.71:  What do you think about a state income tax? 

B.72:  I can see that there might be a reason for one, but I would hate to do that
because, uh, that would be very difficult for my family, financially, to, to
afford a state income tax.  Um, most states have it, I know, and I've lived in
states that have had it.  But, way, way financing is now, if we had a state
income tax, I'd, uh, have a very hard time financing my house again.  You
know, paying off my mortgage each month.  That's, so that's the problem.  Um,
which just matter of we'll see what happens.  I'd rather have that, I guess,
than have a state lottery.  Because when you bring,

A.73:  But didn't they pass that thing that we were going to have a lottery or
not?

B.74:  No.  It didn't. 

A.75:  Oh.

B.76:  Which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax,
even though good old taxes (( )) my favorite, uh, decided that during the
campaign, she said, we weren't going to have a state income tax.  And now
she's going to renege on that, which I expected her to do anyway.  Uh, we'll
see what happens.  I don't know.  At any rate, uh,

A.77:  So what about your income tax?  Think they're hitting you too hard?

B.78:  Actually, no.

A.79:  No?

B.80:  Um, I'm surprised that m-, uh, my income taxes are as low as they are.  We
just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back
this year which is, which is nicer than having to pay out, uh, which is a
matter of, uh, uh, I, I'm surprised it's, well, considering the national
budget, I think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars for the
national budget.  And for a family of four like what I got that comes out to
over twenty-two thousand dollars that we, it, it's our share to pay in.  But
I'm not paying that much income tax.

A.81:  Huh-uh.

B.82:  And you're going to think, well, wait now.  Where's the other eighteen
thousand dollars, or whatever, coming in?  Wh-, how, how is that coming from
me?  I guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot.  But, it's
interesting, I don't know.  I can't imagine.  I guess that's why we're going
into debt so deeply.  They bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one
point four and then the rest goes to, to the national debt.

A.83:  This just keeps accumulating.  [breathing] {heavy} I don't know.  What else
do you think about them, let's see, state?

B.84:  That's about it, I guess. 

A.85:  And the city tax, the sale tax.  They used to, you really didn't even think
anything about it when you bought something.

B.86:  Yeah. 

A.87:  But now you do [laughter]. 

B.88:  Yeah, Yeah.

A.89:  (( )) What is it, seven point?

B.90:  Seven percent, or something.  It depends on where you're at.  Some places
in Dallas, I guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville is
a lot closer to seven.

A.91:  I don't even know how they figure it, really. 

B.92:  Huh-uh. 

A.93:  I'm glad I don't work in a store. 

B.94:  How's that? 

A.95:  Because I wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something
percent, I guess they got a little table though and it's all written out.

B.96:  Oh, yeah.  That's the way to do it. 

A.97:  All right.  So you think federal taxes, okay.  State tax, you can see the
logic of it but you don't think it would be economically feasible for your
family.

B.98:  No. 

A.99:  And ours, see, both of us are teachers and we got four in our family, too.

B.100:  Yeah. 

A.101:  We don't need,

B.102:  So when you start,

A.103:  anymore.

B.104:  taking, talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state
income tax, uh,

A.105:  But we can do this tax sheltered annuity, that's the only thing that's
saving us.

B.106:  Yeah.  I think what we ne-, what, uh, the government, the state government
needs to do is get in there and cut spending.  Because when they got all this
fraud and waste going on, they need to just get in there and, and get out the
garbage that's in there right now.  I mean, I once heard that, uh, for the,
for the federal government release that if they, uh, uh, will, like fe-, on
the welfare system,

A.107:  [Laughter] [breathing].

B.108:  if they gave all that money directly to the people, every welfare recipient
would be making like forty-five thousand dollars a year.  And you know they're
not making that much money.  They're making probably more like five or six,

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  on the welfare.  So, where is the other ninety percent going?  Well, it's
going to the, some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all
day doing nothing but filling out papers.

A.111:  Lots and lots of people. 

B.112:  Lots of people. 

A.113:  Before they get it.

B.114:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.115:  But still, I work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from p-,
poor, you know, socioeconomic areas, homes, and it's just like, they always
have money.  They, they always are dressed nice, you know, most of them are,
fairly nice.  Not like you would think a, a poor person would be.

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  And, I mean, they've always got dessert money, or they've always got, you
know, dollars on them and everything.  And I'm thinking, you know, this isn't
right because my children don't have that.

B.118:  Yeah.  Well I don't have that [laughter].  A lot of times if I've got a
dollar in my wallet, it's like, boy, where do I gr-, where do I find that?

A.119:  Yeah.  And you give them, you know, they get their free lunch and they
throw most of it away.  But, then, they have their money to go buy desert and
that they eat.

B.120:  Wow.

A.121:  You know, it's just, you see garbage pans, I mean, pails, just filled and
we pay people to haul them off.  Right?

B.122:  Yeah.  Right. 

A.123:  [Laughter] And then like, a guy does it and he has his own pigs.

B.124:  Quite -- 

A.125:  That he,

B.126:  -- quite a world we live in.

A.127:  Yeah, it is. 

B.128:  Oh, well. 

@@A.129:  Oh, well. Is that, you got anything else to say?  I don't think I do. 

B.130:  Yeah.  That's all I have to say. 

A.131:  Okay, well. 

B.132:  Thank you. 

A.133:  Ta-, talk to you later then. 

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  #Bye.# 

B.136:  #Bye.#
