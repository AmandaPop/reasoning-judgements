=======================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  We just bought our first home --

B.3:  Oh.

A.4:  -- after being in school and so, we're just first time homeowners.  We've
only been living here about six months.

B.5:  Okay, uh, well, I've lived in the, in the Dallas and Richardson area for
about, uh, twenty-five and a half years, twenty-six years.

A.6:  Oh, boy.

B.7:  And we're in our second home now.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  We've been in it for, uh, about thirteen, fourteen years, I think now, in
Richardson [clicking] {from phone}.

A.10:  Oh, so, you're an old pro then.

B.11:  We've lived in the Richardson for that, you know, for the full time.

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  Uh.

A.14:  Well what do you find it having to be like out there.  I've always
heard that it was expensive.

B.15:  Well, it's, it's not really all that bad.  Uh, I think you live in
Plano, so, uh, the, the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are, are
about the same,

A.16:  Oh really.

B.17:   price wise, I would think.

A.18:  Uh, well we, uh, when we graduated from school in Houston, uh, my husband
went to school at Rice and got his P h d. so that, that's what brought
us here and, um, we had, um, heard a lot about Richardson being a good
area,

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  and the homes there being really nice, and, but we kind of just got the
impression that it was out of our price range.

B.21:  Yeah, well, um, well I, I think that there some areas in, you know,
in, uh, Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced, but, uh, of course,
it, like I said, it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a
house so [laughter],

A.22:  [Laughter].

B.23:  so I'm not sure what the prices are like now.  Uh, I know that
our price, that the, the value of our house went up, you know,
considerably over a, uh, you know, oh, an eight or ten year period but
then for the last several years, it's pretty well stabilized, uh,
perhaps even dropped back some from what it was, so.

A.24:  Really, um.

B.25:  But, uh, we've done, uh, you know, in order to maintain ours, we've done
some remodeling and stuff, you know, just to, to kind of change, do some, some
little changes occasionally, so, uh.

A.26:  Yeah, well that makes sense.

B.27:  But, uh, I guess, I, I'm a little encouraged with home prices.
I, I'm a C P A and I was just talking to one of my clients, uh,
yesterday, or uh, you know, over the last couple of days and they have
sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one, you know, that
was, was more reasonably priced.

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  It's in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District.

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  And, the, the lady is very pleased, you know, she says it's got
everything she wa-, you know, thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was
several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so,

A.32:  Oh that's good.

B.33:  so, I, I suppose that the housing market is, uh, you know, it is on
the, on the down side right now.

A.34:  Uh-huh.  Well do you have a lot of homes out there that have, uh,
foundation problems.  That seems to be the, pretty much the rule out here.

B.35:  Well, I'm not really aware of those, I do know that, that our
house, uh, we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom
replaced twice because, uh, apparently the foundation shifts a little bit
under that.  But that was a design problem, because we put, and we
designed the house, so it's our fault, 

A.36:  [Laughter].

B.37:  but we had them put the shower on a corner, uh, uh, like our
house is built in a U shape and in, inside that U but on one of the
corners, uh, is where that shower is, and so,

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  any shifting in the foundation, of course, or, or, you know, I
guess I feel that way, anyway, that, that shifting would cause some
problems in that, in that area of the house.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  And of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of, uh, of metal
or plastic, whichever it is anyway, so.

A.42:  So did it looked cracked to you, I mean that's how you knew it was
broken.

B.43:  No, it, uh, it started leaking through the, you know, out through
the pan and out on to the floor and soaking up in the sheet rock, and 
things (( )).

A.44:  Oh, so that's, that's how you knew. 

B.45:  Right.

A.46:  Well, since like I say, we're first time homeowners, I'm still
scared about everything like that, 

B.47:  Yeah, uh,

A.48:  going wrong, and how do you know it's going to happen and all.

B.49:  but, uh, yeah, but I think, uh, you know I think so far as, uh, as
the location, Richardson Plano are probably comparable.  The school
districts are, you know, are about the same, uh, you know, quality wise.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  We really like our school out here.  

B.51:  Yeah so,  

A.52:  But we, um, we were scared to buy hou-, a house in our neighborhood
because all of the homes did have these foundation problems,

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  and we didn't know, uh, you know, if we were afraid, that we'd be
living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and
split open or something.

B.55:  [Laughter] Yeah, but, uh, well, our house, and I'm not sure how all of
them, you know, how most of the builders do, but ours is what they
call, uh, post tensioned, which means that there are iron bars, you
know, that run through the foundation,

A.56:  Uh.

B.57:  and once they get the foundation poured, then they, they apply
tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete and makes it
more, uh, more stable and, and puts more strength into it.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  So, uh, you know, it [clicking], it, uh, potentially that's
supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the, you
know, when the, the earth itself shifts around, so.

A.60:  Well that's good, well that's really good.

B.61:  Yeah so,

A.62:  Well our house is older, it's like a nineteen sixty-three house
that we bought, 

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  so, I'm not, it doesn't seem like it, uh, I know so much has changed in
their technology in the last few years.

B.65:  Yeah, right, now is yours a, is it a slab foundation or a pier and beam.

A.66:  It's slab.

B.67:  Yeah, so that's, and that's what ours is.  Our, the house we had
before was over, we live on the east side of Richardson now and the
other one was over on the west side and it was, uh, a pier and beam
house and, uh, I just drove by there this morning and it still looks
just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago, so.

A.68:  Well that's good.

B.69:  Yeah, so, you know, I think houses, uh, I think they hold up pretty
well if you've got a, if you have a good builder [throat_clearing].

A.70:  Yes, my grandfather was a builder and so, my parents always lived
in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good
deal.  So, well I, uh, appreciate that information about Richardson.

B.71:  Okay.

A.72:  I know it was, um, it's got a really good reputation and,

B.73:  Yeah, so, well it, uh, you know, I think it's, uh, a good place to live, of
course, if I didn't think that way, we wouldn't still be living here
[laughter]

A.74:  Fourteen years that's pretty good.

B.75:  Right definitely.

A.76:  Well, thank you.

B.77:  Okay, thank you, uh.

A.78:  And well, uh, you, go-, good luck with this program then.

B.79:  Okay, thank you, you too.

A.80:  Bye-bye.

B.81:  Uh-huh.
