=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay, I don't know, which end do we push but okay,

@A.2:  Okay, well, um, let's see, I, I think there's a lot of people that don't
vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be
heard and, you know, there's such a small voice and such a huge number of
people in the United States and that, you know, their, yo-, votes not going to
make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other
person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in, and that person is
going to have a lot of, uh, since there's so many issues, this one person can
believe a lot of different ways on,

B.3:  Right, yeah.   

A.4:  all of them so, it would be really difficult to have that one pers-,
perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.

B.5:  That's true, you know, a lot of people, uh, uh, I think the, that it ends
up the people that, uh, vote every time, uh, elections come around are more
the, the polly, uh, the party type followers, the guys that, uh, you know,
follow the party lines, you know, and,

A.6:  Yeah.  

B.7:  they, you know, just go in and if they're Republican they vo-, vote
Republican every year, you know, and, uh, the people that are independent, you
know, are the ones that don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year
because they can't seem to, to decide which are the good aspects and which are
the bad aspects of a candidate.

A.8:  Right, yeah, 

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  that's good. 

B.11:  Ye-, I always thought it was back when Anderson was running, I was hoping
that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics
would start going down the tubes, but, um [baby_crying],

A.12:  Yeah.  

B.13:  that didn't work. 

A.14:  Yeah, there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you
know, the real, uh, far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now and to
where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the Democrat party being
liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of, it would be
the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like,
uh, moral standings and those kinds of things.

B.15:  Uh-huh. 

A.16:  But,

B.17:  Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, and then, and then people always get upset about
it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the
ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,

A.18:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.19:  they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more
votes, huh?

A.20:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.21:  I'm always amazed at that, that each candidate thinks it's going to be the
people that come out that will vote for him, you know.

A.22:  Yeah.  That's, that's true.  I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections,
I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody,
this time.

B.23:  Yeah, well, that, uh, (( )) I know that there's certain issues that can
really motivate people because we live in a pr-, pr-, predominately Catholic
type area,

A.24:  Oh, really?  

B.25:  and when things start, uh, when, when abortion comes on the issues and
people just get all insp-, inspired, you know,

A.26:  Right.  

B.27:  and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh, this particular
community is a Catholic community but, uh, uh, down in D C where, where
things are a little bit different, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and
the, and that sort of movement, and so it's, uh, quite the opposite, so
elections start getting very, uh, the elections where they have that topic
seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones.

A.28:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.29:  But, uh,

A.30:  Yeah, that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know,
different issues would be a lot more important than ((say in)) another place.

B.31:  [Baby_talking] Yeah, I can understand why, why some of the, the rural
areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the
lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the, the Midwest,

A.32:  Uh-huh {very faint}.   

B.33:  and, uh, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall
subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put,

A.34:  Right.  Yeah, and it's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one
thing,

B.35:  [Baby_talking].

A.36:  to get elected, and then once they do get elected, they don't have the
power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they
promised, you know, beforehand.

B.37:  Right. 

A.38:  You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you
know, like the no new taxes thing.  You know, that's, uh, with the economy
going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous --

B.39:  Yeah [baby_talking].

A.40:  -- thing to, even try to do. 

B.41:  Yeah.  Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next
year.  I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.

A.42:  Right [laughter].  

B.43:  Uh,

A.44:  Right, after the war. 

B.45:  Uh-huh. 

A.46:  That really, uh,

B.47:  Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, ((
)) even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so
they won't even bother turning out.

A.48:  Uh, that's true, yeah. 

B.49:  They'll just say, oh, well, you know, the Republicans have this election
we'll see you in four years.

A.50:  Right.  Yeah. 

B.51:  (( )) hope some of the local, well that's what they, they keep saying that
it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't
turning out at the, at the booths, they, they say that these older voters
that, uh, you know, they, they feel like the kids are running the, the country
so they, they don't come out, turn out to vote and they're the ones that, uh,
you know, really know what's going on, have the experience and seen, you know,
how politicians can, you know, screwup or what ever.

A.52:  Uh-huh. 

B.53:  But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years. 

A.54:  Right, that's, you know, neither has mine as a matter of fact.  And, uh,
[barking], that's true, they, I think they look at it as, well everybody,
the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true,

B.55:  [Baby_talking].

A.56:  because, you know, that's what the media says.  Well, the majority believes
this way so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their,
uh, opinions.  So that's, that's true.

@@B.57:  Yeah, wonder if they're going to take into account (( )) this
computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in
your knee,

A.58:  [Laughter].  

B.59:  the whole time your talking [laughter].

A.60:  Yeah.  Do you hear the dogs in the background here? 

B.61:  No, I can't hear them. 

A.62:  Okay, they're, the children [barking] next door just opened the fence
and they went off.

B.63:  Oh, yeah? 

A.64:  Yeah.  But anyway, that's, I guess we've, uh, talked long enough and, uh,

B.65:  Yeah [/Baby_talking].

A.66:  that was sort of interesting.  What part of the country are you from?

B.67:  Uh, Washington, D C,

A.68:  Are you really? 

B.69:  Uh-huh. 

A.70:  Wow.  This is, I'm in, from, this is Dallas where I'm at. 

B.71:  Oh, okay.

A.72:  The outskirts of Dallas.

B.73:  Well, I figured ((with Texas Instruments)) they'd probably have a few,
uh, Texans on the line now and then.

A.74:  Yeah, do, do you work for T I in any way? 

B.75:  No, huh-uh. 

A.76:  Wow, how did you, how did they get you? 

B.77:  Um, they (( )), they went through engineering companies,

A.78:  Oh.  

B.79:  and, uh, we're communications.  I, I work in a communications company.

A.80:  Oh, okay, right.  I work for T I so, we saw it on the, uh, T News one day
and I thought, wow, that might be interesting.

B.81:  Yeah. (( )) sort of different. 

A.82:  Yeah.     

B.83:  They called me at, uh, ten o'clock one night, that was very strange.

A.84:  Yeah. 

B.85:  I guess they were doing (( )) Eastern Standard Time.  I was like, I don't
know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes.

A.86:  [Barking] Yeah, Central Standard Time is what they're doing it by. 

B.87:  Yeah. 

A.88:  Yeah.  I still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day
is which yet but,

B.89:  [Laughter].  

A.90:  I didn't study it that hard so maybe I'll figure it out. 

B.91:  Uh-huh. 

A.92:  But, anyway, it was nice to talk to you and, uh, sort of meet you, and,

B.93:  Okay.  

A.94:  that was an interesting topic. 

B.95:  Yeah.  Okay, well, if your ever in, uh, D C, come look up Wayne
((Sherman)), you'll say oh, yeah, talked to that guy.

A.96:  Okay.  I'm, I'm Kyle Hunt,

B.97:  (( )) Oh.  

A.98:  too, if you ever come to, to Dallas area. 

B.99:  Okay. 

A.100:  We live right by the airport. 

B.101:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, so do we. 

A.102:  Oh, okay. 

B.103:  Yeah, right next to Dulles. 

A.104:  Yeah. 

B.105:  All right, I'll talk to you later [baby_crying]. 

A.106:  Okay.   

B.107:  Bye-bye. 

A.108:  Bye.
