=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so we've got to talk about music.

@B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  And, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind?

B.4:  Oh, I guess the stuff [baby_crying] that was done more in the seventies,
because that's,

A.5:  No, not a seventies baby.

B.6:  Well, no that's really when I grew up, so that's really what I like better,
is that kind of music [laughter], I mean,

A.7:  Is it disco, or is it like,

B.8:  No, no, no, not that kind of music [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter] but,

B.10:  No, more like, uh, rock, um, you know, like Led Zepplin type [laughter].

A.11:  Oh, okay.  So, so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin.

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  Yeah, that's cool.

B.14:  Right.
				      
A.15:  And, how about the Rolling Stones?

B.16:  Oh, sure, sure I went to their concert last year when they were here.

A.17:  Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured. How about, um, Pink Floyd?

B.18:  Sure, yeah, I like them.

A.19:  Okay.  So, so then we got, we got some same things because,  

B.20:  Okay, well, I just didn't know that much about music and I wasn't sure what
kind of music.

A.21:  No, it's very hard because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd
rather listen, you know, I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.

B.22:  What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about?  What,

A.23:  We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.

B.24:  Okay, like, give me some examples.

A.25:  Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company, what,

B.26:  Oh, well, Bad Cam-, Company's not bad, that's not,

A.27:  well, they're like, for example, A C D C.

B.28:  [Laughter] Yeah, A C D C [laughter].

A.29:  Why, have you heard of them?

B.30:  Yes [laughter].

A.31:  Okay.  And, stuff like that.  That's, that's,

B.32:  Well, okay.

A.33:  that's not really hard rock.

B.34:  Okay, I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.

A.35:  Okay.

B.36:  I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like
Cinderella, you know.

A.37:  Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal.

B.38:  Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella [laughter].  But, I like A C
D C's okay.

A.39:  But, see, for example, they have, see what, but other bands consider it
like really hard rock.  It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they
have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar, and the guitar is set like,
really low,

B.40:  Yeah.  No, I don't really care for that too much, I guess.

A.41:  and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music
and then they start dancing around,

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  and they just bump into each other,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  and, then, you knock people down, and what you do is, you also try to get
up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.

B.48:  [Laughter] Is that the kind of music that you like?

A.49:  No, I don't like that music.

B.50:  Oh, okay.

A.51:  But, that's, that's what they do.  That's, that's what some people call
like really heavy metal.

B.52:  Oh, okay.

A.53:  And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is
that the lyrics also.  Like really, like heavy metal, wo-, is considered, like
the words heavy metal and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide.  And
killing people and stuff like that.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And, just hard rock has, they, they don't talk about that, they just talk
about, like, life in general.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.

B.58:  Oh, sure.  Of course.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Que-, you, you're talking Queen, is that what you said?

A.61:  Okay, well, no.  I said Queen's Reich, but,

B.62:  Oh, oh, oh, okay,

A.63:  but, oh, but you got to like Queen also.

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  So because,

B.66:  Well sure, because Queen was real popular when I was growing up.

A.67:  Yeah, especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera?  Don't they
have a, no let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in
the background.

B.68:  Oh!  Um, uh,

A.69:  Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.

B.70:  Right, right, yeah, yeah.

A.71:  Yeah, that, that was great.  I heard that the other day on the radio and I
pumped it up.

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  Because, I mean, I just love that song.

B.74:  Yeah, that, that was a real good one.

A.75:  Yeah, but they had, that, that whole record was pretty good.  But then,
they started going downhill like everybody else.

B.76:  Well, that's true.  They came up with some pretty weird stuff after 
that.

A.77:  Yeah, they're, they're still around, they've got a ne-, new C D out, but I,
I wouldn't buy it.  Because see, what happens is, the old, see whe-, I like, I
like the old Rolling Stones.  I don't like the new stuff.

B.78:  Of the Stones?

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  Yeah.  I agree.  That's the ne-, the older stuff is the best of it.  The,
the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I,

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  don't really care for today's rock and roll too much.

A.83:  Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  An old, Genesis?

B.86:  Yes, definitely.  I agree.

A.87:  And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make
money, a lot of money doing this, and then he came out with, uh, see, for
example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  That was good, but it was on his way of going downhill, because he said, I
can make a lot of money just singing alone, and then he came out with the
Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis and that really, like now, I hate Phil
Collins, I can't stand him.

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  Because, I look at him and I say, you know, you were singing at this time,
and with these people, and you were great, and now you're singing all this
stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record, it's
still going to be a number one hit.  And so, that's, that's what gets me mad.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie?

B.94:  No, not yet.  I guess I've been, con-, kind of considering it.  Have you
seen it yet?

A.95:  Yeah.  I saw it when it opened.

B.96:  Was it really good?

A.97:  Yeah.  Well, it, it's, you know, it's like, I was watching Siskel and
Ebert,

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  you know, like those guys that criticize movies?

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  And, they both loved the movie, right? 

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  They said the music's great, it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like
that.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  And then, one of them said, well, everything is great, but I'm going to
give it thumbs down.  And they go, but why?  Because it's like, the end is,
like, really depressing.  And so,

B.106:  Oh.

A.107:  But it, but it's like the movie is so well made, and the music that goes
with it just picks you up, see, I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred
sixty-nine.

B.108:  Oh, okay.  

A.109:  So, I mean, so for me,

B.110:  So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then.

A.111:  No, but you learn to.  I mean it's just that, like the, the sixties music's
got a lot to say.

B.112:  Right.

A.113:  I, I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too.  You know,
I was like,

B.114:  Well no, now, well seventies music, I mean, I'm, like I said, yo-, disco, I
don't like disco, I've never liked disco.

A.115:  Hey, but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants,

B.116:  [Laughter]  Well, that's true [laughter].

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  That's true.  But, I was more in the late seven-, well, I shou-, like mid
to late seventies, like between seventy-five and,

A.119:  Yeah, yeah.

B.120:  and, seventy-nine, was more my era.

A.121:  Did, did you go to college?

B.122:  Well, no.  I'm going right now [laughter].

A.123:  Oh, that's cool.

B.124:  But uh, no I didn't go then.  But see, I graduated high school in
seventy-eight,

A.125:  Okay.

B.126:  so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really
heavy, you know, and real, um,

A.127:  Yeah, yeah.

B.128:  I don't know, disco was pretty much dead by then.

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  So, so that's what I mean, disco wasn't really my time.

A.131:  Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in
progression, ever in history.  So,

B.132:  About music?

A.133:  No, about everything.

B.134:  Oh.  Okay.

A.135:  So, it's like, nothing happened during the seventies.  Everything happened
during the sixties, the seventies I don't know what they're called, you know,
it's like, like the, the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or
the, or, you know, like the technology years,

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  because of all the computers and stuff.  But the seventies got nothing.
I mean, nobody cared to name it [laughter].

B.138:  That's kind of funny [laughter].

A.139:  So.

B.140:  You're right.  I never thought of that.  The disco years, that's what
they're calling them,

A.141:  Yeah, I know.

B.142:  are gone.

A.143:  [Laughter] Can you imagine the, like a big picture of John Travolta, ta-da,
what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?  Him just standing there.

B.144:  Yeah, right.

A.145:  Yeah, that's a good example to look for in history.  Well, from now on
we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first
step on the moon, to nineteen eighties.  Okay, what happened in the middle?
Don't worry, don't worry, you're not, you're not missing anything, you know,
so,

B.146:  [Laughter] That's true.  Well, except for Vietnam.

A.147:  Yeah, really.  And, that's, 

B.148:  You know with,

A.149:  that's why I guess, everybody, yeah, it's like they don't want to talk
about that, so they just, don't name it.  I mean, it was, it was, I guess it
was pretty bad times.

B.150:  Yeah.  Well, that's very true [laughter].  But,

A.151:  Oh, well, let's see, yeah, okay, we've been talking for seven minutes, so,

B.152:  Oh, good.  I haven't even been keeping track.

@@A.153:  Okay, all right, so um, I'm going to leave you alone.  Uh what, what are
you doing?  Do you have a family?

B.154:  Uh, yeah. 

A.155:  Okay.

B.156:  We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper, but it's not a big
deal,

A.157:  Oh, I'm sorry.

B.158:  I just left it.  No, it's okay, because see I didn't, see somebody tried
to call me last night but I didn't have my number yet, I just got it today.

A.159:  Oh, okay.

B.160:  And so, you know, it's okay.  I, I told them I'd be available during this
time, so,

A.161:  Okay.  All right.

B.162:  anyway.

A.163:  So then, uh, have fun doing this.  It is not,

B.164:  Okay, thanks.

A.165:  #that bad.  Bye, bye.#

B.166:  #Great, Bye.#
