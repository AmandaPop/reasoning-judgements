===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um.

B.2:  So you're a woodworker, uh?

A.3:  Well, yeah, I like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and
stuff, I just bought a home two years ago that's about sixty-five year's old
and we've done a little work on it and, uh, I,

B.4:  What do you know about timber framing?

A.5:  Pardon me?

B.6:  What do you know about timber framing?

A.7:  Timber framing, okay well, other than, you talking about like post and beam
construction?

B.8:  Right, right.

A.9:  That type?

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  Well, not very much other than what I read.  We don't use much of that up
here, although I understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit.  But, um, up
here we generally use, uh, uh, frame construction work or wood frame
construction with wooden siding, and, and, you know most of your homes down
south, I guess, are brick but here they're pretty much wood frame
construction on a two by four's, and, and, uh, one by twelve boarding on the
outside, or sheet plywood and then some kind of a insulation material and
covered with clapboards or shingles.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  That's a typical New England home, I guess.

B.14:  Yeah.  The reason I asked is because we're embarking on a little adventure
here in that we're going to use, uh, some timber framing techniques to build a,
a truss for a home.

A.15:  Uh.

B.16:  And it's a, it's a, you know what a mansard roof is?

A.17:  Sure.

B.18:  Like a barn, yeah.

A.19:  Uh-huh

B.20:  And they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing so the
whole area is like a cathedral up there for the second floor.

A.21:  Oh, okay.  That's unique.  We do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are,
they're again, they're, they're truss construction but, they're well braced.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  You know, cross braced inside, held together by steel cleats and stuff.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Uh, mansard roofs are, are in bond building, I guess, are, they do a lot of
that, I understand, by laminating the series of, of beams of planks together
and, and with,

B.26:  Yeah tha-, that's done some where they're actually create a, a single piece
that is the truss.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But, uh, what I want to do is, I want to make four identical components and
uh, cut the joints so that the, the more pressure you put on it the stronger
it gets,

A.29:  Well that's something.

B.30:  And it involves interleaving and, uh, using, uh, you know locking wedges.

A.31:  Sure, sure something like the way you'd do, uh, um, bricks around a window,
around a large window,

B.32:  Yeah, similar to that, yeah.

A.33:  type thing, the center, the center brick is the key brick which locks
everything together.  That's a pretty neat idea.  Are you building, are  
you,

B.34:  Well, if I do that and then cover it with, uh, two by six tongue and
groove,

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  it will be pretty sturdy because we have to, we, we got what we call
Santa Ana wind down here,

A.37:  Okay.

B.38:  it comes up out of Mexico at about a hundred miles an hour.

A.39:  Where are you located?

B.40:  We're at a the cor-, at the Northwest of Denton, Texas,

A.41:  Okay.

B.42:  right on the Red River.

A.43:  Yeah, okay.  I lived in Abilene for about ten years.

B.44:  Well, then you know about that wind.

A.45:  Oh, yeah a little bit [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  It gets a little dusty there.  Lubbock blows by there about once a month,
if I remember [laughter].

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  I worked for the T I plant in Abilene and, and I sure enjoyed the
Southwest, it was really neat.

B.50:  Uh-huh {Very faint}.

A.51:  But, uh, that, that's an interesting concept, uh, uh, is this going to be
your, your permanent home or,

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Okay.

B.54:  Yeah, we, we bought this land out here we're going, we're going to retire
on it maybe in twenty-five, thirty years from now but, you know, we're, we're
still fairly young.

A.55:  I saw a log cabin built down there that I was really impressed with and it
sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have
where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- but the rest of the center portion of the cabin, which was a huge, huge
house, was all open and the thing I really liked about it was it had a porch
on all four sides of the house, all the way around the house.

B.58:  Well we're only going to have a porch on north and south end.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  And, uh, we'll have so-, uh, Anderson window walls is what they are.

A.61:  Yeah, yeah.

B.62:  So the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  ((because)) on the piece of property we have it's the second highest
pointed in the county and we can see Oklahoma to the north, the lights of
Gainesville to the east and the lights of Wichita Falls to the west,

A.65:  Wow.  Boy, that's quite a distance.

B.66:  And that's a it's, it's we're just right on the southern rim of the Red
River Valley.

A.67:  Yeah, yeah.  I have a, a pretty good idea where it is.  Of course, I know
Wichita Falls pretty well.

B.68:  You know where Nocona is?

A.69:  Pardon me?

B.70:  Nocona?

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  Okay, that's about as far north as we can see just, you know, right on the
other side of the river there.

A.73:  Uh-huh, well that's really interesting.

B.74:  And, boy, it's really nice, it's about an hour drive to work though.

A.75:  Yeah, well out, out that way it shouldn't be to bad I guess your traffic
doesn't get too heavy until you head in toward, uh, toward Dallas a little
bit, but you should spread out pretty good out there I know.

B.76:  We don't have any traffic.

A.77:  Yeah, out in West Texas there was hardly any at all in Abilene but, well
that's a little different here in New England we sure got some around Boston
here and New York I'll tell you [laughter].

B.78:  I used to live in, uh, Springfield, well actually Chicopee Falls.

A.79:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, I live about, I live just over the line of south of
Attleboro, Massachusetts into Rhode Island, and it's just north of the City of
Providence so about forty miles from Boston but the traffic on the interstate
every day back and forth to work [laughter], it, it's an eye opener,

B.80:  ((That's)) unbelievable.

A.81:  [Laughter] but it moves pretty well, so, well ((Roy)) it's sure been nice
talking with you and, uh, uh, hopefully we'll have another conversation
probably another way down the road, good luck with your new home.

B.82:  Yeah, it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand.

A.83:  Is that right?

B.84:  Yeah, the first floor's going to be underground.

A.85:  Okay, and, and,

B.86:  Of course it will be open on the south and north end.

A.87:  Sure.

B.88:  And east and, well, see we have a little knoll on our property --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up, so we'll nestle the
house right up next to it.

A.91:  Are you going to take advantage of the, the ground thermal action and,

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  and, and, uh, use for your heat and cooling?

B.94:  Cooling,

A.95:  For cooling especially, yeah,

B.96:  we don't have to worry about heat, I mean.

A.97:  yeah, yeah, well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes
but,

B.98:  Yeah, but they're very short.

@@A.99:  Yeah, that's for sure [laughter].  Uh, well we're still in our winter up
here right now the temperature is eighteen degrees [laughter].

B.100:  Well, the temperature [static] Tuesday was ninety-six.

A.101:  [Static] Yeah, uh.

B.102:  [Laughter] It was tough.

A.103:  I can stand that.

B.104:  Today was cold, in the seventies.

A.105:  Yeah, well it's been cold up here, the mornings have been cold.  The winds
blowing about forty miles an hour right now, so, it's really, really cold
outside.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  We've been real fortunate we haven't had much snow and stuff, so.

B.108:  It went from thirty-eight to ninety-six on Tuesday.

A.109:  Is that right [/static]?

B.110:  [/Static] That's a pretty good temperature swing.

A.111:  Yeah, that's, that's a little too much though then a lot of folks catch
colds and stuff like that, you know.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  The, the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a
little more gradual, I think.

B.114:  Well, if you don't like the weather in Texas just wait a minute.

A.115:  Yeah, yeah I hear you [laughter].  Okay, sir.

B.116:  Well, you have a good day.

A.117:  Yeah, and thank you much, I will talk to you again.

B.118:  All right.

A.119:  Bye-bye.
