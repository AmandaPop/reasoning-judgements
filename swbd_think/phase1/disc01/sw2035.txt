A.1:  Hi Diana.

B.2:  Hi  [baby_crying].

A.3:  Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?

B.4:  Pardon me.

A.5:  Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all
of you.

B.6:  Oh, yes, we've, uh, been, um, we've gone other, you know, all kinds of
places, we go out to dinner,

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  we take the kids to the park, and, uh, you know, [baby_crying] whenever
we, he, my husband has time off or something, we take them to the zoo, or we,
you know, we do everything we can possibly as a family.

A.9:  Do you work outside the home?

B.10:  No, I don't.

A.11:  Yeah, I don't either, it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.

B.12:  Yeah, it does, an, an then, uh, you know, my husband enjoys spending time
with the kids, you know, he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  So he, they can have time with him an.

A.15:  So you have a break too.

B.16:  Right, so and we, uh, we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home,
you know, we have, we try to spend like Monday nights, we call it family home
evening,

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  and, have our kids, uh, you know, have little lessons with them, and, you
know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, you know,
teach them about their grandparents or something like that.  Bring out
pictures of them so they get to know them and, we just do all kinds of fun
things like that an.

A.19:  Yeah, we have family that's far away.  It sounds like you might too.

B.20:  Yeah, we do, so they, 

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  you know, the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures.  And,
uh, 

A.23:  Right, and phone calls that's about, [laughter] about it.

B.24:  Yeah, right and, uh, you know, they, we, you know, we go to the park or we
go in the backyard and sit down an,

A.25:  That's wha-, yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things. 

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Especially since my youngest one is [sneezing], excuse me, only fourteen
months.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  and likes to go places.

B.32:  Yeah, and with, you know, me being at home and just having the one income,
you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, you
know, extra things.

A.33:  That's right.

B.34:  So, you, you make more fun than, you know.  You know the kids just think
it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or,

A.35:  Oh that's a big thrill for them.

B.36:  yeah, or, uh, you know, go get a bag of M and M's or something like that,
they, they think that's a lot of fun.  So we just, we try to spend as much
time as we can.  We, you know our, our whole weekends are divi-, are devoted
to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or
something, 

A.37: Yeah.

B.38:  but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids and they come,
go to church with us and so.

A.39:  Yeah, that's true.

B.40:  Yeah, so.

A.41:  Have, um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?

B.42:  Yes, yes, that's what.

A.43:  We ju-, we haven't lived here too long and we went there a couple of
weeks ago and, uh, [throat_clearing].

B.44:  Uh-huh, the kids thought that was wonderful.

A.45:  Oh, yeah, we, I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two.
We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.

B.46:  I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into, it was about a year or so ago,
when we went.

A.47:  The one we went in had, uh, the thing that sticks out most in my mind is
that, like a kids place area.

B.48:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.49:  That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.

B.50:  Yeah, yeah they had a lot of fun in there and, uh, there's, uh, there's
some petting, you know, like, uh, uh, I think it's Owens Country Farms has a
free petting, you know, like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet
animals and stuff.

A.51:  Where's that.

B.52:  That's on Plano Road, uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,
it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road [children_talking].  

A.53:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.54:  And that's a lot of fun.  

A.55:  Oh yeah.

B.56:  They have tours going through there and, uh, the kids think that was a
lot of fun, too.

A.57:  Oh, that does sound like fun. It's a little bit of a ways,

B.58:  We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it's
wonderful just to go to McDonalds, you know, they don't go for the food they
go for the, to play around and,

A.59:  That's right.

B.60:  There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business,

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  and it's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for
kids.

A.63:  That's sounds fun too.

B.64:  And parents get in free and it's like, during the week, it's like five
dollars admission per child, all day.

A.65:  And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,

B.66:  The petting farm, yeah.

A.67:  [Throat_clearing]  That sounds fun I think maybe we'll try to do that.

B.68:  Yeah, yeah and the one in Mesquite is, uh, Scyene exit.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  And it's, it's, uh, the kids just had a wonderful time there, they, you
know, you just pay that admission, and then all the, the, the rides are free.
You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those
little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that but,

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  they thought that was lot of fun.  You can have birthday parties there
an, I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for
them to do.

A.73:  Because they can just do, you don't have to have tokens for everything.

B.74:  Yeah, right.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  So they had a lot of fun.

A.77:  That does sound like fun.  Well I've gotten some good ideas from you
[laughter].

B.78:  Yeah.  I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know,
inexpensively as possible, so.

A.79:  Definitely.  Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes but I'm
sure that will be good.

B.80:  Yeah, that will be good, yeah.

A.81:  It was good talking to you.

B.82:  #Well it was good talking to you.#

A.83:  #I really appreciate your suggestions.#

B.84:  Oh, no problem.  Well, take #care.#

A.85:  #Okay,# bye-bye,

B.86:  Bye-bye.
