A.1:  Hi, Cynthia.  What did you wear to work today?

B.2:  Um, let's see.  What did I wear to work today?  Um, actually I wore
corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.

A.3:  So, can you dress pretty casually? 

B.4:  Um, on occasion. 

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  On occasion.  Um, I do vary.  Um, you know, I wear suits, I wear skirts
and sweaters.  On occasion I can wear jeans.  Um, how about you?

A.7:  Well, I, um, run a business out of my home. 

B.8:  Uh-huh. 

A.9:  So I tend to get up in the morning, put on,

B.10:  Yes. 

A.11:  sweats, um,

B.12:  Uh-huh. 

A.13:  do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting
with a client, I'll put a suit on.

B.14:  Uh-huh. 

A.15:  And then come home and get back into regular clothes again [laughter].

B.16:  Uh-huh.  Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.
Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.  I, um, don't like
to wear heels, that really tires me out.  I work in a big building.

A.17:  Yeah. 

B.18:  So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.  Um, you know, in the winter I wear
sweaters, in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves,
things like that.

A.19:  I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits
together that I can interchange, the,

B.20:  Right. 

A.21:  jackets and the blouses and all that a lot. 

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  That's helped me a lot with having, I can only have a, a limited wardrobe,
since I'm only,

B.24:  Uh-huh. 

A.25:  working part-time right now. 

B.26:  Uh-huh. 

A.27:  Um, but still, it gives it some variety. 

B.28:  Uh-huh. 

A.29:  Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.

B.30:  Right, right, accessories, uh-huh. 

A.31:  What about your casual wear?  Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?

B.32:  Um, yeah mostly.  I mean, at home I predominantly wear {speaker laughs
while saying remainder of statement} sweatpants and things like that,

A.33:  Yeah. 

B.34:  also.  

A.35:  It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so
hot.

B.36:  Yeah, well, they're, um, you know, they're like Ber-, 

A.37:  Dress shorts. 

B.38:  yeah, they're like black corduroy Ber-, Bermuda shorts. 

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  And sometimes I wear a blazer with them, and I get really a lot of
compliments on them.  Um, where I work is predominantly male.

A.41:  Yeah. 

B.42:  So, you know, they, their attire is always the same, you know.  Suits or
slacks,

A.43:  [Laughter].  

B.44:  you know, jeans, whatever.  

A.45:  ((Yeah, but)), 

B.46:  And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
but seems to work for me [breathing] [laughter].

A.47:  [Laughter]  ((Yeah, but)).  

B.48:  In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,
it's one of those skorts, you know, th-, it's shorts but it looks like a
skirt.

A.49:  Uh-huh. 

B.50:  So, I think that'll be good for work, too. 

A.51:  Oh, yeah.  It'll be comfortable. 

B.52:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So,

A.53:  I guess down here, uh, we just recently moved to Texas, so my wardrobe has
changed quite a bit.

B.54:  Uh-huh. 

A.55:  Um, we moved from Colorado where, and I have a closet full of sweaters.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  That,

B.58:  Well, see, I live in Virginia.

A.59:  You live in Virginia, now? 

B.60:  Uh-huh. 

A.61:  Oh, that's interesting. 

B.62:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I'm, you know, like right now, today was in about, you
know, the fifties.

A.63:  Uh-huh. 

B.64:  But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater
dresses.

A.65:  Yeah.  I'd like to be able to wear those here.  Today it's eighty-eight
degrees.

B.66:  Oh, my [laughter].

A.67:  So [laughter], 

B.68:  Uh-huh. 

A.69:  Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while
now [laughter].

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here. 

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.74:  Yeah, we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes
here.

A.75:  This is pretty un-, unseasonal, but, uh, at least, we, you know, it, it, it
feels good, it gets, uh, everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.  It's nice
to get,

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  out and about. 

@@B.78:  Uh-huh.  I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing
[laughter].

A.79:  Okay. 

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  Sounds good. 

B.82:  Okay? 

A.83:  It was nice talking to you. 

B.84:  Okay, it was nice talking to you, also. 

A.85:  Bye-bye. 

B.86:  Bye-bye.
