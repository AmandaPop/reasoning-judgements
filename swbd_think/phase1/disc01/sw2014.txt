=======================================================================

A.1:  How do you feel about gun control?

@B.2:  Uh, on the scale they gave, one to ten, I'd say I'm probably a four.  I'm
not totally, I'm not one of these people that believes that we should not be
able to buy guns, but I don't think we should be carrying Uzis either
[laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  You know what I mean.

A.5:  Some people do, I know.

B.6:  Yeah, I know, I mean I don't think machine guns, automatic weapons, I
don't believe in things like that but I think that everyone should have the
right to have a hand gun in their house, if they so choose.

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  An, but I think there should be some restrictions when you buy one, you
know, they should do more background search on you, they should, I think it
should be harder to buy one. 

A.9:  Yeah, there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a
gun,

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into
those stores.

B.12:  No, they don't, they don't ask anything except how old you are, I don't
think.  That's kind of scary.

A.13:  I'm from California, uh, my mo-, the last time I was like purchased a
gun, my, my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted, like an
antique one and they, he had to fill out some forms, but I guess California
might be tougher, I don't know. 

B.14:  Yeah, they might be, you know how we are here in Texas, it's like
everybody is a hunter so [laughter],

A.15:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.16:  I'm not much of a hunter, but, I've never even bought a gun myself.  My
dad's given it to me, or someone's given me one, so I'm probably real illegal.
[laughter]  I'm carrying guns that aren't even mine.

A.17:  [Laughter]  Yeah, it's, it's a hard decision to make.

B.18:  It really is, uh, the only problem I have with gun control is that they,
the radicals want to ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people
carrying guns are going to be, be the people who are going to kill you anyway.

A.19:  Like the bumper sticker [laughter]. 

B.20:  Yeah, exactly. 

A.21:  It's true.  Yeah.

B.22:  Right, it really is, because they're going to get them one way or another.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  They will always have a way, look at drugs.  They always have a way to
get that, so,

A.25:  Right, right.

B.26:  and they're illegal [laughter]. 

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  I don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together.

A.29:  No, I, yeah, I, I, I agree that it would be like people in, people that
are criminals are the ones that are going to get them and then you have no
defense against these people when they do,

B.30:  That's true.

A.31:  come into your house, or something.

B.32:  I think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too, how to take care
of one, how to act around one when they buy them.

A.33:  Yeah, have, have gun, have, have gun management one o one [laughter]. 

B.34:  Yeah exactly [laughter].  You can not take the gun home until you have
taken this course, sign up here [laughter]. 

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  Something like that.

A.37:  Yeah, or, req-, required for every college student [laughter]. 

B.38:  Right exactly, [laughter] before graduation. 

A.39:  Uh, gun control,

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  It's it's such a heated topic in the, and people get so emotional about
it.

B.42:  Oh yeah, they do.  They get real emotional about it.  All the, I've worked
with a lot of people that hunt, and they just, they, they don't see any sense
in at all.  They think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control, but
then of course, they're hunters, they know what they're doing.  They don't
realize there are a bunch of crazy people out there that, don't use it for
that.

A.43:  Some of them are crazy too [laughter]. 

B.44:  Well, yeah that's true.  [laughter]  #They shoot each other thinking
they're a deer.#

A.45:  #Yeah, yeah, they go out there and get# drunk and start shooting
[laughter].

B.46:  Yeah, darn, I thought you were a deer, Bob, sorry, my mistake [laughter]. 

A.47:  [Laughter]. 

B.48:  Looked like antlers, I don't know.

A.49:  Yeah Marge, I don't know what happened to your husband, he just never came
back.

B.50:  [Laughter] Yeah, that happens a lot too.

A.51:  Yeah, oh.

B.52:  But, I guess that's it, my opinion on it.

A.53:  [Laughter]. 

@@B.54:  So what now?

A.55:  I'm not sure.

B.56:  Uh, uh.

A.57:  Let's see.

B.58:  I think we just hang up.

A.59:  Yeah, we just say good-bye and hang up.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  #Okay.#

B.62:  #Okay, thanks.#

A.63:  #Okay thanks, bye, bye.#

B.64:  #Bye.#
