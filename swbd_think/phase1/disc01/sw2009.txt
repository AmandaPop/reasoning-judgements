===========================================================================

B.1:  Have you done a lot of camping recently?

A.2:  No, I haven't been camping since I was about sixteen.

B.3:  Oh, okay.

A.4:  But uh, my family used to have a pop-up trailer.

B.5:  Oh, yeah.

A.6:  And, we'd go camping to a lot of different places.  We spent two weeks in
Bastrop, Texas once.

B.7:  Oh, oh where's that [laughter]?

A.8:  It's near Austin.

B.9:  Oh, okay.  I'm not that much familiar with Texas.  We've been, my family
has been everywhere, but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else.

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  We've had, oh gosh, we've, I've camped in a, in a, in a back of a van, the
we got a pop-up camper, and then we got a trailer, now they've got, now
they've got a big motor home.  So, they, they still do a whole lot of camping.

A.12:  Have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks? 

B.13:  Oh, gosh, yes, uh, oh, Yellowstone about four years ago, four or five years
ago, and um, oh, we di-, my family, when I was younger, we went, that was
just, you know, what we did in the summer, go from (()) national park to
national park.  We had a lot of fun.

A.14:  When I go camping, I don't, I don't like to rough it.  I like to have a
little bit of el-, electricity, and,

B.15:  Yes.

A.16:  a little bit of running water.

B.17:  Me too [laughter].

A.18:  I'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with
nothing.

B.19:  Oh, no.  No! [laughter] I've done it but it's not fun [laughter].  You
don't want to do it for like three weeks at a time, that's for sure
[laughter].

A.20:  I have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer.
They are both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they
go to New Mexico.  And, they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks
and,

B.21:  Ugh, no.

A.22:  It doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me.  

B.23:  No.

A.24:  My friend said that the last time they went, uh, she just got tired of the
tent, and it was cold at night, and,

B.25:  Oh, yeah.

A.26:  she got tired of eating out of cans, and so, they stayed in a hotel one
night,

B.27:  [Laughter].

A.28:  just for fun.

B.29:  Shaking the scorpions out of their shoes [laughter].

A.30:  No kidding, no kidding.  Gosh, this way, the, the bugs, I don't like the
bugs.

B.31:  Oh, me neither, me neither.  Th-, the mosquitoes just keep you up all
night.

A.32:  Yeah.  The one nice thing I remember about camping with my parents is they
had a big hammock.  And, they would always find a couple, a campsite with a
couple of good trees that,

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  to hang it in between, and I could just lay in the hammock for hours.

B.35:  Yeah, yeah, that's nice.

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  Well like, when fam-, when my family camps, we're, the only time you're at
the camper is when you want to sleep [laughter],

A.38:  Oh.

B.39:  otherwise you're just going constantly. You know, in all the, in all the
National Parks and stuff [sniffing].  We camped at the, let's see, we camped
down at, at Galveston two or three years ago and that, that was, that was fun
except that they, uh, were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the
shore and they were, and the, and the smell of, that was kind of gross but
[laughter],

A.40:  We stayed in Galveston Island State Park once.  But, if, a storm blew in,
and it was just horrible, and the sand was blowing up our camp,

B.41:  Oh, how awful.

A.42:  the little camping area was pretty near the shore,

B.43:  Uh-huh, oh yeah.

A.44:  and there were some pretty big dunes before the, the camping area, and
the sand was all blowing up, and you couldn't even go out of the camper, the
wind was blowing so hard, because you'd get sand in your eyes.

B.45:  Oh, that's miserable.

A.46:  Yeah, it was pretty bad, pretty bad.

B.47:  Yeah.  I ha-,

A.48:  But we had a good time in our camper.  We usua-, we usually took box games
and things to do in case it rained,

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  and my parents always let us take a couple of friends, so we always had a
good time.

B.51:  Yeah.  If, if you always, when there's kids you've always got to have other
stuff to do cause it's always going to rain sometime [laughter].

A.52:  Yeah.

B.53:  And, then your par-, par-, they drive the parents nuts [laughter]. 

A.54:  Yeah, well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature.

B.55:  Oh, I know.  Wish I, I wish I had appreciated it more,

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  when I was, when we were camping so extensively, when we were younger.
Now I wish I could go back to those places. [laughter] The time, I've got,
I've got a child and another one on the way, so I,

A.58:  Oh God, makes it a little,

B.59:  I wish I had time.  My, our pop-up camper just sits in the garage and
collects dust, unfortunately.

A.60:  My fianc3ee and I, one day, would like to own a big motor home.  Mainly
because he's a football, he's a college football coach,

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  and we're going to have to travel a lot,

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  and, it would be nice if we had a big old motor home and that way I could
load up the rest of the wives,

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  and go to wherever the football game is, and have someplace to sleep
without spending big money for a hotel and,

B.67:  That's true.

A.68:  and, park it outside of the stadium, and have a good old time.

B.69:  Plus it's nice to have your own stuff there.

A.70:  Um, um.  Uh-huh.

B.71:  Yeah.  Plus you get, eating out is, is so expensive.

A.72:  No kidding.  It really is.

B.73:  So, it, it's a, it can be really handy to have a camper.  Just cause, my,
our family lives in Missouri and, uh, when we take trips home we take our
pop-up with us in good weather, and stay overnight at a state park or
something, so we don't have to rent a hotel room and,

A.74:  Oh yeah.

B.75:  and, that's, that's nice.  You know, paying five or six dollars instead
of forty [laughter].

A.76:  Yeah.  No kidding.

B.77:  Yeah.  Well [sigh], what else?  [laughter] Well, I think that's just pretty
much it, we've been on here awhile [barking].

A.78:  Okay.

B.79:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.

A.80:  Nice talking to you too.

B.81:  Bye.

A.82:  Bye, bye.
