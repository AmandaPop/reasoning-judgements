===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I haven't, uh, I've benefit working in my own home for just, um,
about the last three years, bu-, so I can just wear whatever I want [laughter].

B.2:  Oh, now that's nice.

A.3:  around the house.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  But before then, I taught at the, the University of Houston and, um, so I
tried to wear things that were comfortable, but still tried to look, you know,
(( )).

B.6:  So what, business attire?

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  Yeah. 

A.9:  It wasn't quite business, but to give the students, um, and, made you feel
like you were the authority. I felt like,

B.10:  Right. 

A.11:  if I came in just in jeans or,

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  or tattered clothes, that I didn't have as good control over the class.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  And if I tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike,

B.16:  Exactly.  Well I, I work, uh, I'm a financial analyst.  

A.17:  Uh-huh. 

B.18:  And, uh, um, in my group, uh, nearly everyone wears a, a, sports coat and
tie.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh, but, that does change in the summer, uh, they, they get a little more
lenient and we can wear like, uh, an open collar or, um, a lot of times in the
summer, I'll try to, uh, like on a Friday, I'll try to take off half a day and
maybe go play some golf.

A.21:  Oh, that's nice.  

B.22:  So, uh, I'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and, uh, um, and that, that's
okay. That's appropriate.

A.23:  Well, do you, um, meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way
for the clients or,

B.24:  Not really, it's, uh, it's just, uh, in our small group we, uh, we, have a
controller and, uh, we support a senior vice president.

A.25:  Huh-uh. 

B.26:  And, uh, the senior vice president is, uh, is big on business attire, and
so, um, um, he sort of funnels that down to, uh, to the people that work in
his group.  So, um, I, I, I enjoy it. I think it makes a nice environment and,
um, I don't know, gives it a little more business type atmosphere.

A.27:  Well, I have noticed with my own children, for example, that they will,
depending on what they're wearing, it, it makes a big difference on how they
act.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  And so that could be, the same can be said for the business office, too.

B.30:  See, I think that's exactly right, you know if, your, uh, if your dressed
in a, a suit and to me it ma-, helps me feel sort of like, what you were
saying, a lot more confident in myself.

A.31:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

B.32:  And, uh, if I do have to approach, the, uh, the controller or the vice
president, I feel, I just have that little extra confidence in myself, being
dressed that way.

A.33:  Well, and I noticed in my teaching experience that, since a lot of the
people were my own age or older, even, um, that, because I taught English as a
second language, so I didn't have your average freshman,

B.34:  Oh, I see. 

A.35:  and, um, so I, I had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit
off their level.  You want to be friends with the students, but you don't
quite want to be their equal.

B.36:  Exactly.

A.37:  And so, for me to dress in businesslike clothes, my, uh, you know, um, I, I
preferred slacks because we had to wa-, park pretty far [laughter].

B.38:  ((Oh, well, that and)) Houston, it would be so hot. 

A.39:  Yes.  And you wouldn't want to have to walk, uh, you know, in high heels,
it's hard to walk a long way,

B.40:  Right. 

A.41:  and the campus is pretty large,

B.42:  I see. 

A.43:  so I preferred slacks, and, um, you know, kind of dressy shirts and
things but,

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  so that I would look a little bit different and I would come in and I
would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did
and,

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  that helped with their discipline and,

B.48:  I see.

A.49:  didn't make me have to much trouble and,

B.50:  Right, right.

A.51:  with the students. 

B.52:  And I think clothing you know, is just, uh, it does, like you were saying
the way you dress, makes you feel different ways.

A.53:  Huh-uh.

B.54:  Um, if you, like when you go out at night, uh, you may just want to have a
casual evening or something, so you sort of dress down, but if your going to
a, uh, uh, social type party then you dress up, and that, I think, it just has
a change on your attitude.

A.55:  Well, I noticed since we moved down here to Texas, my husband is originally
from Texas, but, uh, I'm not,

B.56:  I see.

A.57:  And, since you don't have to have, uh, such a wide variety of seasonal
clothes that you do up north,

B.58:  I'm, I'm sure that is true, yeah. 

A.59:  You have a totally different wardrobe with different fabrics, 

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  you know, heavier wools and,

B.62:  Yeah, see the winter season is just not that long to, to invest a whole lot
of money in, in, uh, the heavier, heavier materials.

A.63:  No, and you don't, um, you know, if, you usually can wear pretty close to
the same types of things, just with a jacket or sweater or,

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  or something, rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe
[laughter].

B.66:  Exactly, exactly.

A.67:  Different shoes, you know, we always had, like, um, higher shoes, higher
tops on them,

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  rather than just the lower skim, skimmers. I think they call them that,
you would wear day-to-day but,

B.70:  See I think ladies clothing, um, uh, is a lot more varied than, than, than
men's clothing.  Because, uh, men, or at least in my situation, you can, uh, I
can wear the same slacks and sports coats nearly all year-round.

A.71:  Huh-uh. 

B.72:  And, uh, ladies you know, uh, uh, I don't know if that's marketing or what,
but they, they definitely have a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and
then a summer.

A.73:  That is really true.  A lot of it is, um, the color, certain colors seem to
be,

B.74:  True.

A.75:  acceptable. You know, if you wear, um, pastels, it needs to be warm
weather [laughter].

B.76:  Right. 

A.77:  And otherwise, you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason
and so, I guess part of that is, um, just the physics of it.  That, in, what,
isn't dark colors attract the sun,

B.78:  Right.   

A.79:  and light colors repeal themselves?

B.80:  Exactly.  Plus the social attitude, you know, if you, you walk into a place
and, and, uh, I know in our office, um, our secretary gives everyone, uh, all
the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes.  I think it's, uh, is it
after Labor Day or something, I don't know,

A.81:  Huh-uh.

B.82:  and, um, so you know the, the social attitude has a little bit to do
with, I think the way we dress.

A.83:  That's true, there's some rule that's like between Labor Day, uh, no, is it
Labor Day or Memorial Day?

B.84:  I'm not for sure, it's, that one in September is when you need to quit.

A.85:  Huh-uh, right. 

B.86:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.87:  And the one that's like in May.   

B.88:  Right. 

A.89:  You can only wear, and supposedly, we don't have an opportunity, my
husband and I, we don't go to a lot of like where he as to wear [lipsmack]
a white dinner jacket or something [laughter].

B.90:  I see, right. 

A.91:  And so, you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those,

B.92:  Exactly, exactly.

A.93:  two holidays. 

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  That is pretty funny. It's funny that we have, as a society, go to so much
trouble, when we have so many other things we could be spending our time
thinking about [laughter].

B.96:  Exact-, a lot more, uh, that's right, a lot more helpful ideas,

A.97:  Huh-uh.

B.98:  that we could be spending time and effort on,

A.99:  Huh-uh.

B.100:  rather than our appearance.

A.101:  I noticed, uh, when we moved to Plano that um, the mall here, Collin Creek,

B.102:  Right. 

A.103:  I don't know where you are, but um,

B.104:  I live here in Plano. 

A.105:  Oh, you do. 

B.106:  Yeah. 

A.107:  that there, there is a pretty, um, I wouldn't say snobish [laughter].

B.108:  [Laughter].

A.109:  it kind of borders on that if I, depending on what I'm wearing, I get
better service at the mall.

B.110:  Oh, really. 

A.111:  I felt since,

B.112:  Huh-uh.

A.113:  uh, since, where, you know, where I've lived in Houston that,

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  you have to, in order to get the attention, you might need help --

B.116:  Right.

A.117:  -- you need to be, you can't just come in off the street. 

B.118:  Exactly.

A.119:  is what I'm trying to say. 

B.120:  And I think that's, you know, a North Dallas type attitude. 

A.121:  Oh, is it? 

B.122:  And, uh, because I noticed that, um, like even going to church and, um,
seems like people really dress up a lot more here in North Dallas going to
church and, um, now that's, that's, uh, because uh, uh, I went to school at,
uh, Texas Tech in Lubbock.

A.123:  Huh-uh.

B.124:  And, uh, church was a lot more casual, uh, rather than, uh, you know here
it's like going to a fashion show almost.

A.125:  Yes, I think, I think your right.  I've noticed that too. It's very
different, but I've, I think it's kind of sad when you have to make, have to
dress up when you go somewhere.  I mean, just to the (( )).

B.126:  Right, to try to keep up with the Joneses almost. 

A.127:  Yeah. 

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  And you have to be sure that your, everything coordinates and,

B.130:  Right.

A.131:  and everything, everything is freshly pressed and everything.

B.132:  You can't just wear your sweats and an old tee-shirt. 

A.133:  No, [laughter] you can't. 

B.134:  [Laughter].

@@A.135:  Well, I appreciate the conversation we have had about clothing. I know
I've, it's interesting to hear a man's point of view.  It's usually my
husband, he's got a pretty good deal.  I go out and buy all his clothes
[laughter].

B.136:  [Laughter] and now that is.

A.137:  [Laughter].

B.138:  That is, so, uh, well that is great.  I appreciate the call.

A.139:  Well, thank you, you have a good day.

B.140:  You to.

A.141:  Okay.  Bye-bye.

B.142:  Bye.
