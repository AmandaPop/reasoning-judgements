B.1:  Hello.

A.2:  Hello, 

B.3:  Hi.

A.4:  Hello this is Lois.

B.5:  Hi, hi, this is Lisa.

A.6:  And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling
Instructions.

B.7:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I got a call yesterday too.  This is a different subject
though.

A.8:  Yeah, this is about changes in the women in the, 

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.

B.11:  Yeah [laughter].

A.12:  I think there really is.

B.13:  It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.

A.14:  Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.

B.15:  Yeah, uh, I think you have to push one and then we can start recording it.

A.16:  Okay [tone].  All right.

@B.17:  Okay.

A.18:  Are you ready now?

B.19:  Yes.

A.20:  Okay, like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as
changes in the generations.

B.21:  Yes, I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into
the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess, she's in
her late forties.  You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids
and I've never faced that at all.

A.22:  Uh, no, I think no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old,

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  you know, and you stay there.  And I feel like the next generation,
you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.

B.25:  Yeah, uh-huh, I think it's definitely gotten better.

A.26:  Oh, I do to, much.  And it's just going to get better.

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  It really is.

B.29:  Because women are in every field now, I mean I can't think of a field that
they're not involved in.

A.30:  Oh, I can't either, not a one.

B.31:  And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out
with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since
women have gotten into the doctor field.

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.

A.34:  Yeah, even in Washington, you know,

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  there seems to be a lot more women involved. 

B.37:  Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue, I mean people
will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman, 

A.38:  Yeah, yeah.

B.39:  I think that would be the best goal.

A.40:   Oh, I do too, just your qualifications and that would be it.

B.41:  Uh-huh, exactly, not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or
female.  That would be wonderful, ((I guess)) it's kind of an ideal world
though, huh [laughter].

A.42:  Yeah, I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social
security numbers, you know,

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female,
female over a male, you know,

B.45:  Exactly, or the way you look, or the way you, you know,

A.46:  Yeah, yeah.

B.47:  your age or anything. I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.

A.48:  I do to just go by your social security number and then look at you
qualifications that, you know, that you have. 

B.49:  Uh-huh, and then,

A.50:  And then if you get it, you know then,  

B.51:  Uh-huh, also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more
options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job,

A.54:  Oh, yeah.

B.55:  or,  

A.56:  As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.

B.57:  Is it.

A.58:  Uh-huh, it sure is.

B.59:  That would be great.

A.60:  It sure is.

B.61:  Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she
went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house
and she, you know, we could send her messages, and, and she kept in touch like
that,

A.62:  Oh.

B.63:  and basically, just worked out of her house.  I would just take her
the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two, and that worked out great
too.

A.64:  Yeah, yeah that is.

B.65:  And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for
it.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  All it was, was, you know, I mean, she just used a phone modem and she
was like she was sitting in the office, so I think that's real nice too, to
come up with different options.   Do you like the job sharing?

A.68:  Oh, I do, 

B.69:  Do you?

A.70:  I really do, I think it's great. 

B.71:  Do you work like half days, or half weeks or, 

A.72:  Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two and the
next week, you know, I'll work three and she'll work two,

B.73:  Oh, oh that's great,

A.74:  and we just share off like that.

B.75:  Uh-huh.  Do you get the full benefits?

A.76:  Uh-huh, yeah we get the full benefits.

B.77:  Oh, that's wonderful.

A.78:  But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.

B.79:  Yeah, especially with children, and so many things going on,

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  that would be great.

A.82:  It really is, and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you
know,

B.83:  Either way,

A.84:  of (( )) children, uh-huh.

B.85:  yeah, you have your career and your home life, and that would be a nice
way, especially if you have young children.

A.86:  Oh, it is, it is, well both of ours is school age, but we don't want to
miss any of those  P T A -s and, you know, all of that.

B.87:  Uh-huh, oh, no, I think, yeah.  My son's just in day-care but even that
they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that
you're involved in that.

A.88:  Uh-huh.  I think it's great, I really,

B.89:  Yeah,

A.90:  and I look for more of that in the next generation.

B.91:  I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on
those decision making, you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,
that would be wonderful.

A.92:  Yes, oh, I do too. 

B.93:  Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two
days off that you can do everything, so you don't have to, you know, unless
you're just really sick, or the child's sick.

A.94:  Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend, or just forget
it.

B.95:  Uh-huh, oh yeah, I have to plan way in advance, because, or, what I've
done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours.

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  That's been real helpful too, like my doctor stays open til nine in the
evening.  So that's real helpful, so you don't, you know, have to do it
during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.  I don't know how many times
I've done that to do something,

A.98:  To do, yeah.

B.99:  post office or the bank or any kind of errand, so.

A.100:  Uh-huh.  Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,

B.101:  Uh-huh, I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just, it's
always been that way.

A.102:  Uh-huh.

B.103:  But I know,

A.104:  Yeah, but I can rem-, remember back growing up, my mother, I mean it was
she always worked, but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.

B.105:  Oh no, I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of
was sick, and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know,
compared to the work that she did. 

A.106:  Oh yeah.

B.107:  I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men
and women work in the same job, I think men get paid more,

A.108:  Oh, I do too.

B.109:  but I think that's improving.  It's such a slow process it's frustrating,
but,

A.110:  Yes, yes.

B.111:  you can see that it's wrong and you just want to make it right, but at
least the wheels are moving forward.

A.112:  They really are.

B.113:  Yeah, I think it's getting better, not worse.  Well, I should probably
get back to my job [laughter].

A.114:  I  know, [laughter] I know the feeling.

B.115:  Call again.

A.116:  Okay, I sure will.  Bye-bye.

B.117:  Okay, bye-bye.
