A.1:  Hi Gary. 

B.2:  Hello. 

A.3:  Hi. Today is, uh, Saturday.  Have you found spare time to do any hobbies?

@B.4:  Uh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, I went to, uh, one of the nurseries and,
uh, bought myself another cactus plant.

A.5:  Is that right? 

B.6:  I've got many, uh, shrubs inside the house. 

A.7:  Inside your house? 

B.8:  Inside, yeah, uh-huh. 

A.9:  Like cactus gardens and,

B.10:  Uh, yeah, in, in the south window in the bathroom I've got, uh, quite a
few.

A.11:  That's nice. 

B.12:  Uh, along with all the other, uh, uh, plants I've got in the house, a lot
of different types.

A.13:  We do the same kind of things, though.  We've been concentrating on outside
lately, trying to do some gardening and, uh, planting a lot of trees and
flowers.

B.14:  Yeah, I, I'm assessing the damage outside right now.  I've got couple of, a
few shrubs I need to replace outside.

A.15:  From the winter?

B.16:  Yeah.  They didn't, uh, 

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  survive the freeze.

A.19:  We have a couple of those too.  We, uh, we haven't planted a garden yet.
We mo-, moved here from Colorado not too long ago where we had a really big
garden, [barking] but here, I, I don't know, I, I hear, I hear that the
growing is a little bit different.  Have you had a garden?

B.20:  Uh, yeah, well I've got, uh, oh, several shrubs outside,  

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  uh, out there, uh, #depending on,# 

A.23:  #Have you# ever tried any vegetables? 

B.24:  No, I never have, uh, 

A.25:  Yeah. 

B.26:  No vegetable gardens.  Uh, I used to have that when I lived with my folks
up in Wisconsin.  They always grew a lot of vegetables but,

A.27:  That's what we had, yeah, #we just,#

B.28:  #no vegetables# here, a lot of evergreens. 

A.29:  It gets so hot, I just wonder, you know, what, what vegetables can really
take that heat.  #We'll see.#

B.30:  #Well,# there, there's quite a few that can handle that, um, any local
nursery will be able to help you with, with something like that.

A.31:  That's true. 

B.32:  Um, besides, uh, gardening what other, uh, types of things are you
interested in?

A.33:  Well, I do some, oh, some needle craft things, hobbies sometimes, some
cross stitch, um, no, no sewing or knitting, any of that.  Um, little things,
some cross stitch, you know, some gifts that I make for friends and families,

B.34:  Okay.

A.35:  that kind of thing.  Anything else you, you do in your #spare time?#

B.36:  #Oh, yeah, I# play softball a couple of times a year. 

A.37:  Yeah. 

B.38:  It's, there getting ready to start up the, the season again. 

A.39:  I have two small children, so I started to, you know, have them enrolled
like in soccer and things like that.  I tend to be more of a spectator these
days than participating.

B.40:  On a day like today, it's so nice outside you like to get out there and do
something, uh,

A.41:  Yeah, it's beautiful. 

B.42:  We need to break out the bicycle, too, and get that down and start to ride
around.

A.43:  Mine has got a flat tire, so I'm going to have to do something about that.

B.44:  [Laughter] Uh-huh. 

A.45:  Well, I don't, uh, have too much else I do in my spare time, how about you?

B.46:  Well, um, I'm not, uh, much, uh, of a woodworker myself, but my dad owns a
shop, and he, uh, makes quite a few, uh, arts and crafts type things out of
wood.

A.47:  Is that right? 

B.48:  #And,# 

A.49:  #Did# he sell them at craft shows and,

B.50:  Yeah, they go to arts and crafts fairs,

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  and, uh, they have their, uh, stand that they set up and display all
their, uh, all their products,

A.53:  Oh, that's neat.

B.54:  lots of vases and plates and bowls,

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  things of that nature.  I'm probably the best customer. 

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  I've got the house stocked with, uh, a lot of their stuff.

A.59:  Is it pottery or is it #wood?# 

B.60:  #No,# it's, it's wood turning. 

A.61:  Oh, that's #beautiful.# 

B.62:  #He's got,# got a lathe and all kinds, he's got a shop full of equipment --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and they, uh, he turns, turns out bowls and vases of all different types
of exotic woods.

A.65:  Oh, that sounds neat.  How about like big salad bowls and those kind of
things?

B.66:  Uh, yeah, yeah, some, some like that.  Uh, uh, lots of, uh, different types
of vases.  Uh, ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on
tables, and, uh, he's been doing a lot of, uh, a lot of decorative type plates
lately [barking].

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Boy they sound nice.  Well, I don't think I've ever seen wooden
plates at any of the craft shows.

B.68:  Okay.  Uh, well, there are shops around here that have, uh, items like
that.

A.69:  Uh-huh. 

B.70:  Uh, not too many with the style that he uses though.   

A.71:  That sounds like a unique item. 

B.72:  Yeah, they're, they're, uh, quite unique, and, uh, it's, well he's retired,
so it,

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  it's something to do in the spare time.  They've got a lot of time to, to
work on that now.

A.75:  Well, that's good.  Keeps them active, I'm sure [laughter]. 

B.76:  Uh-huh. 

@@A.77:  Well, it was good talking to you. 

B.78:  Okay.  

A.79:  All right.

B.80:  is that, uh, that's [laughter],

A.81:  Good luck with your indoor gardening there. 

B.82:  All right.
