===========================================================================

A.1:  So, let me tell you a little bit about the weather here.  Last Sunday night
we had an ice storm which took down all of our trees, all the power lines, all
the phone lines, it was, it was incredible.  It, um, it occurred about two
thirty at night, or in the morning actually.  Um, for the past six days we've
been out heat, without power, um, without a phone.  We've basically been
living out of suitcases, at friend's house that happened to have power. It's
really been horrible.

B.2:  Where do you live?

A.3:  Well, um, living in Rochester, New York.

B.4:  Oh.

A.5:  So, we normally, you know, this time of year it's very cold and we have a
lot of snow and all that and this has just been something we've, we've never
seen an ice storm like this before.

B.6:  Oh.

A.7:  And people that were actually were staying home, um, without any heat.
They were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the
house without any heat.

B.8:  Oh, my word.

A.9:  It's really been crazy.

B.10:  Yeah.  Well, we've had unseasonably warm weather here in Texas.  We,

A.11:  Uh.

B.12:  Um, last week, it was, I believe, um, I believe it was Monday or Tuesday we
had, had ninety-four degrees.

A.13:  Are you serious?

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Do, are you someone that likes the heat?

B.16:  Um, I grew up in Wyoming so I, you know, we had, I didn't mind the heat
then.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Um, the summertime, the summer's here get heat real hot,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  and I have a hard time with those but I get use to them.  You just kind of
stay indoors.

A.21:  What is it normally like there,

B.22:  Um,

A.23:  this time of year?

B.24:  this time of year sixties and, you know, stuff like that so.  Today,

A.25:  So would it,

B.26:  I think it's about sixty-five today, here, something like that.  So,

A.27:  Today, it sixty-five?

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  Oh, that's great.

B.30:  Yeah.  It's,

A.31:  You must be feeling like it's, uh,

B.32:  Yeah, my husband's outside in a short sleeve shirt right now working in
the garden and we've planted our garden and,

A.33:  Oh, that's so nice.

B.34:  Yeah, we've been, you know, we've been working in the yard and our peach
tree's blooming so we have very warm weather here right now,

A.35:  Uh-huh. 

B.36:  compared to what you're having.

A.37:  Yeah [laughter] ((considerably)).

B.38:  I grew up in, you know, I grew in Wyoming. I remember ice storms and,

A.39:  Yeah. 

B.40:  we get ice storms here but we haven't had one in, you know, in a long time.
But,

A.41:  So, what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there?

B.42:  Um, the lowest temperature that it gets here, um, in the wintertime, this
winter we had, um, some temperatures get below zero and,

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was,

A.45:  ((That is so wild)).

B.46:  It was, you know, it doesn't, you know it was real unusual.

A.47:  This past Thursday we had winds and, and snow to the point where if you
walked outside and if you're walking against the wind you almost couldn't move
because,

B.48:  Um.

A.49:  the wind wouldn't let you walk.  It was strong.  It was really something.

B.50:  Um.  Are people going to work around there in this?

A.51:  Well, on, on Monday, all the businesses were closed,

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  and then on Tuesday, I would say about half of the businesses were closed.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  Um, they finally opened up again, I don't even say as normal because
nothing was really normal this week.  People were [throat_clearing] faced with
trees, through there cars, you know, trees had fallen right on top of their
cars.  Um, other people had trees go right through there rooftops.

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  It's just, it-, as a matter of fact, um, Governor Cuomo, the Governor of
New York,

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  is supposedly asking Bush, now, to declare Rochester, um, a disaster area
and,

B.60:  Uh.

A.61:  obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  But it's really, you know, and besides just the inconvenience of it all
it's, it's pretty sad because Rochester has some nice parks,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  and some really beautiful tree lined streets and there all just, just
destroyed.  They were all torn down, um, the ice it was really just a
crippling thing for,

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  the whole city. 

B.68:  You know, when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city.

A.69:  I can imagination that be-,

B.70:  Yeah, because nobody knows how to drive in it so,

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  when you get, I mean, here they start even to forecast the weather, you
know, it's going to be an ice storm tomorrow, they'll come, before the ten
clock news they've already got schools calling in saying they've canceled.

A.73:  Really?

B.74:  Yeah, they don't even wait around here to see if they canceled it
[laughter] they call them,

A.75:  Oh, that's funny.

B.76:  the night before and [noise].  And we've had, you know, say that they're
going to be, get this real bad ice storm and,

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  um, it's beautiful the next day.

A.79:  Oh [laughter].

B.80:  The weather here is so unpredictable, you know, I don't even put much stock
in the weather reports,

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  because they're hardly ever accurate. 

A.83:  Well, I grew up in Boston and in Boston, um, we get our share of snow, but
it is always very, very well cleaned up.

B.84:  Uh-huh. 

A.85:  They would be, the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and
sand and, you know, it would, the next morning it would be fine.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  And in Rochester they, I guess they feel that they get so much snow that
they don't clean it up just for a little bit,

B.88:  Uh-huh. 

A.89:  so even for three or four inches your just driving right on it.  The
streets haven't been plowed,

B.90:  Uh.

A.91:  there's no salt on the ground.  Nothing.  They wait until they get a major
storm.

B.92:  Yeah they wait a little bit of rain here and they a it's going to freeze
and the sand trucks are out.

A.93:  Oh, really.

B.94:  Yeah, we have, you know, it gets, even in a rainstorm here that roads get
so slick,

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  you know, not even cold weather but just rain because the roads get so
oily,

A.97:  Oh.

B.98:  that, uh, we've had, you know, twelve car pile ups [noise], 

A.99:  [Laughter]  Really. 

B.100:  on the free ways because,

A.101:  Oh, my gosh. 

B.102:  they don't slow down for nothing around here.

A.103:  Uh-huh. 

B.104:  So,

A.105:  That's crazy. 

B.106:  {Talking to someone else in room}.

A.107:  Sure. 

B.108:  Oh, no, no I'm talking to my daughter.

A.109:  Oh.

B.110:  She wanted her shoe off.

A.111:  Oh [laughter]. 

B.112:  I'm sorry.

A.113:  I thought were saying, can you hold on?

B.114:  No, no.

A.115:  [Laughter] Oh, okay. 

B.116:  I was talking.  My little girl wanted her shoes off.  

A.117:  [Laughter] Well, I just came back from getting our new clothes for day and,

B.118:  Uh.

A.119:  we, we stayed all last week with one set of friends.  And, um, they,
they're having company this weekend, so we had to move,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  and you just feel your imposing on people.  You know?

B.122:  You don't even have power back to your house yet? 

A.123:  Oh, no.  They're averaging, um, well, there estimating that next, by next
Thursday, everybody should have there power back.

B.124:  My word.

A.125:  The schools were all closed this week and, there still thinking of closing
them on Monday because for little kids it's, it's still kind ever dangerous
on,

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  to be on the side walks because they might be some live wires,

B.128:  Oh.

A.129:  hanging down and, and they're a lot of streets that are just closed
because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort
of thing.  But one thing that was very funny was that on Monday, um, almost
every single store in Rochester has been sold out of batteries.

B.130:  Oh.

A.131:  Because people are needing batteries, for portable radios and flashlights
and,

B.132:  You need to stock up to batteries then.

A.133:  Really.  And we had, you know, a refrigerator full of food,

B.134:  Uh-huh. 

A.135:  a freezer full of food, and that's all been,

B.136:  Destroyed.

A.137:  just, you know, you can't use it.  It's, it's just gone bad.  So, this
storm really, it's, uh, it's been incredible.

B.138:  Yeah, you have to have some food to eat because the grocery probably ran
out real fast.

A.139:  Right.  Exactly.  As a matter of fact, we made on to, I don't know if you
ever watch Dan Rather,

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  the C B S news.  He mentioned, um, I guess it was Monday night or Tuesday
night, he mentioned the state of emergency and we all felt like finally we
made national news.

B.142:  Uh-huh

A.143:  But, I don't know. I would,

B.144:  Oh, well.

A.145:  much rather be in the warm (( )).

B.146:  Yeah.

A.147:  ((Um)).

B.148:  Yeah, because it's beautiful here today, I haven't gone outside been too
busy working inside,

A.149:  Uh-huh. 

B.150:  but it's beautiful here.

A.151:  Well, throughout all of this I called my in-laws who live in Florida,

B.152:  Oh.

A.153:  and they just finished putting in a pool, so, hun, this city freezing and a
pay phone outside of our house, um, they were sitting by the pool sipping, you
know, a glass of wine and,

B.154:  Oh.

A.155:  Oh, was really, it was horrible.

B.156:  Yeah,

A.157:  But,

B.158:  It's amazing how it can be so different in one part of country.

A.159:  It really is. 

B.160:  Because I have family in Boston, too. 

A.161:  Oh, you do? 

B.162:  Uh-huh. 

A.163:  Oh. I remember the earthquake last year and,

B.164:  Uh-huh. 

A.165:  I, you know, I guess, you-, your, like the earthquake was in San Francisco?

B.166:  Uh-huh.

A.167:  Remember that?  And, you know, you can hear about it on T V and you just,

B.168:  But going through it is so much different.  Yeah. 

A.169:  Yeah.  Exactly.  You just never think it could happen to you.

B.170:  Uh-huh. 

A.171:  Right. 

B.172:  Yeah, because his family, my husband's family, lives in, um, Anaheim,
California, you know, just a couple, you know, miles from Disneyland and,

A.173:  Uh-huh. 

B.174:  So, it's amazing how it, you know, it can be cold here and beautiful there.

A.175:  Yeah, that's true. 

B.176:  Yeah {while yawning}. 

A.177:  Well, the rest of New York is suppose to be use to this kind of weather,

B.178:  Uh-huh.

A.179:  but right now people, uh, the cool that (( )),

B.180:  You could never get use to that kind of weather.

A.181:  No, that's true.  But there is some people that just love it.  I mean
they are people that even if it gets to, uh, sixty degrees they feel that's
too hot,

B.182:  Uh-huh.

A.183:  And they just, they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and, and that's
why they live here, I guess,

B.184:  Uh-huh. 

A.185:  But you, for the month between basically November and April if you don't
like the snow and the cold then you might as well pack your bags and leave,

B.186:  Uh-huh. Right.

A.187:  because that's all that's all there is here.

B.188:  That's how it was in Wyoming too, you just, you know it was always cold and
then, you can, you only had, um, two or three months that you could plant a
garden,

A.189:  Oh, really. 

B.190:  and here we can get three gardens in a year. 

A.191:  Uh-huh.

B.192:  We can replant three times a year and get stuff.

A.193:  That is great.  What do you plant this time of year?

B.194:  Um, we've got onions and potatoes and, um, broccoli and all that kinds of
stuff like that but,

A.195:  [Breathing] And what?
