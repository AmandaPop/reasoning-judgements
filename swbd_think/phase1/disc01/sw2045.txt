===========================================================================

A.1:  All right, I play volleyball and softball and ceramics. 

B.2:  Ceramics sounds interesting, uh, I do computer programming, kind of a ho-,
on the side, and I also like to, uh, do gardening, and also like to workout.

A.3:  I didn't think of working out as a hobby [laughter], 

B.4:  Yeah. 

A.5:  or playing with the computer,

B.6:  Yeah,

A.7:  I do both at home. 

B.8:  yeah, well, I, I, uh, I work with computers at work and then I come home
and, and I have, uh, a little lap top at home that I just like to play with.

A.9:  Uh, we've gotten a little Atari computer.  My husband describes it as a, a
computer with training wheels.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  #Uh.#

B.12:  #Yeah.#  Well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of, uh, a lot
of vases and things or, 

A.13:  [Child] No, I, I do ceramics I, I, you know the pieces are made from a mold
and I paint them.

B.14:  Oh.       

A.15:  Uh, you know you get them, you clean them up, you know, get the, uh, mold
line off --

B.16:  Uh-huh. 

A.17:  -- you know, you scrape that off and, uh, make it as smooth as possible,
uh, then you, uh, put it in a kiln and fire it.  You know, it's like a big
ov-, oven --

B.18:  Uh-huh. 

A.19:  -- and, uh, when you pull it out it's called bisque, uh, it started it off
with greenware when you first start off then it goes to bisque and that's when
you can paint it.

B.20:  Do you have your own kiln or do you,

A.21:  No, I've, uh, y-, you can rent people's kiln they, they, uh,

B.22:  Oh.

A.23:  you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and, uh, pay
them. There's one woman that charged ten dollars a month for fire, all that I
wanted.

B.24:  Oh, 

A.25:  [Baby_crying].

B.26:  well, that, that doesn't sound like it's too expensive a hobby does, uh,
does the, uh, clay and, and the paints and things are they expensive?

A.27:  The paints and stuff can get expensive, the greenware it depends on what
you buy.  Now I bought a, a chess set for my husband and painted it for him
and I'd say the greenware for, you know, twenty-four pieces, I think is what
they're, no, no, thirty-two pieces.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  is a, was, co-, cost me about eight dollars.

B.30:  Well, that doesn't sound very expensive to me.

A.31:  No, I liked it I had fun with it. But, uh, you know, uh, I'm a little shaky
when it comes to detail work --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- so, I couldn't get the fine pieces, so, you know, I had, uh, get parts
that had big spaces in them.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  Uh, couldn't do the fine tailed, fine detail on it. 

B.36:  Um.

A.37:  But, uh, you know, I made my son his, uh, Donald Duck and, you know, the
Disney characters.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Painted them for him in real bright colors. 

B.40:  Huh.

A.41:  And, uh, he enjoyed them until he was about two and then he, uh, had fun
throwing them and broke them.

B.42:  Oh, no, [laughter].  Well.

A.43:  That was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just
kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them.

B.44:  Well children will tend to do that.

A.45:  Yeah, well, I didn't get mad at the kid, I got mad at my husband for giving
them to him.

B.46:  Well, well, I, I enjoy working out when I, I get home from work just to,
just to have something to do that, that I know isn't going, that's, that's
good for me, #something to do other than,#

A.47:  #I workout with that, uh, E S P N.#

B.48:  Excuse me?

A.49:  The people on the E S P N?

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  I workout with them, or try to.

B.52:  Occasionally I'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while
I'm at work and I'll do them when I get home.

A.53:  Um, I don't work,

B.54:  Um.

A.55:  #so,#

B.56:  #Yeah, well I really,#

A.57:  I, I do it in the mornings.

B.58:  I enjoy doing that. 

A.59:  I haven't worked out in quite awhile.  I play volleyball, I guess that's
good enough workout.

B.60:  That is, that can be a, a w-, big workout.

A.61:  Yeah, it's fun.

B.62:  Do you play volleyball a lot? 

A.63:  At least once a week, uh, sometimes we play two ni-, games a night, you
know, consist of, uh, fifteen point game and you play two games, and, you
know, the best, uh, person that wins two games wins.

B.64:  Um. 

A.65:  And, uh, a few times we've had a tie breaker so I played three games and,
uh, then we'll get a half hour break, or so, and then I'll go and play another
set with somebody else, you know.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  It's fun.

B.68:  Yeah, I, I enjoy volleyball, I'm just not very good at it,

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  and I end up [static] killing my knees. 

A.71:  Yeah, well, uh, I've torn mine up, uh, you know we play with a church team
so we're not competitive we're just having fun,

B.72:  [/Static] Uh-huh.

A.73:  And, uh, when I played softball, it was with the church [child] team, it
was just for fun.  Although, the church team we made it to the nationals, we
were ranked fifteenth in the nation,

B.74:  Wow.

A.75:  so, I, you know, I'm proud of that.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  But, that was a, for anoth-, you know, I was in another state then.

B.78:  Um [static].

A.79:  So, I'm not with the same softball team.  But they're starting up soon so
I'll be playing again.

B.80:  Um, I have several friends that play softball.  They play softball in
different church leagues,

A.81:  It's,

B.82:  around town. 

A.83:  it's a good way to get out with people,

B.84:  [/Static]. 

A.85:  and you don't have to, uh, uh, let's see what's the word, to have fun
without doing the drinking and all that.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  And, uh,

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  you know, you don't hear a lot of angry words.  

B.90:  Uh-huh [static].  

A.91:  I'll, you know, be nice and, uh, you know, it's going out to have fun.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  Because, it, you know, it's a, it's a hobby you do not want to be stressed
out after playing.

B.94:  No kidding, hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable.  They're not supposed to
be difficult, or, or, they're not supposed to make [\static] you less relaxed
than when you began.

A.95:  Yeah, well, uh, get back to computer programming of yours, --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- uh, [laughter] I've been, uh, trying to program some, uh, disc or some,
uh, what do you call them, putting some programs into the, on the disc, and,
uh, I'll get to about fifteen, sixteen lines and I'd mess up and it just says
you have entered a error,

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  in line, and I don't see how people do that, that drives me batty.

B.100:  [Laughter] Well I, uh, I have a, a, Computer Information Systems degree
from school, and I've been at it awhile, so,

A.101:  Yeah. 

B.102:  you know, you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and, and move
on [static].

A.103:  [Laughter] The closest I come to, uh, a having a, uh, program work on me
was the, the Atari, toot toot,

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  [Laughter] and you know, that was just a couple lines and you push a button
and you hear a train and then the, the toot toot [laughter],

B.106:  Uh, yeah.

A.107:  the kids like it, though.  They think it's a hilarious.

B.108:  Yeah.  {pause}  Well I need to run, I enjoyed talking to you. 

A.109:  All right, thank you. 

B.110:  Sure bye-bye [/static].

A.111:  Bye-bye.
