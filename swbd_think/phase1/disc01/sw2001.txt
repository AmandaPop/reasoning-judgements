B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Hi.

B.3:  Hi.

A.4:  Um, yeah, I would like to talk about how you dress for work, and, and, um,
what do you normally, what type of outfit do you normally have to wear?

B.5:  Well, I work in, uh, Corporate Control, so we have to dress kind of nice,
so I usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time, slacks, I guess.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  And in the summer, just dresses.  We can't even, well, we're not even
really supposed to wear jeans very often, so,

A.8:  And is,

B.9:  It really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is
kind of, you know, always the same temperature.

A.10:  Right, right.  Is there, is there, um, a-, is there a, like a code of dress
where you work?  Do they ask,

B.11:  Not formally, 

A.12:  Right.

B.13:  but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit
nice.  A lot of times we have to go over to, uh, like Jerry Junkins' office
and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff,

A.14:  Right.

B.15:  and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin, and Bill, so we have to dress a
little bit nice. We're not,

A.16:  Right, right.  And does it, does it change?  I guess, um, you can, can you
judge like, uh, depending on what you think you'll be doing that day?

B.17:  Yes, now, you know, if, if every-, like in August when everybody is on
vacation or something, we can dress a little more casual,

A.18:  Right.

B.19:  or, ice storms, of course, you know, we all came in in our tennis shoes
but, 

A.20:  Yes [laughter].

B.21:  [Laughter] I guess that would have to do with the weather.

A.22:  Yeah, #yeah, well i-, it's,#

B.23:  #But, um,#

A.24:  that's right.  #And it,#

B.25:  #unless# it's an ex-, you know, an unusual day,

A.26:  Yeah, and it was usually, uh, also, uh, where I was, it was, um, i-, in
engineering, and,

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  and it was, it was a casual office, there was no formal dress code, but,
um, uh, usually engineers are expected to, to dress, you know, a little more
professionally, it,

B.29:  Yeah.

A.30:  just in case things would come up during the day, 

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and would want to
see you,

B.33:  Right.

A.34:  uh, other times it could be very casual.  If you knew you would be at a
desk all day and nobody could see you,

B.35:  Yeah, or, uh-huh.

A.36:  Um.

B.37:  What area do you work in?

A.38:  Uh, well, I was, I was in a, uh, private consulting firm, 

B.39:  Um.

A.40:  so, um, and, uh,

B.41:  Okay.

A.42:  and, uh, anyway, um, right now I-, I'm not, I'm not there but [laughter],

B.43:  [Laughter].

A.44:  but, anyway, um, and seas-, really same, season to season, um, uh, it
changes with the,

B.45:  it, with the,

A.46:  weather, you know,

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  wear light clothing I guess, if it's hot out, but, um,

B.49:  But then usually in the summer, it's cold in the offices because the air
conditioner,

A.50:  that's --

B.51:  is doing it's job so well.

A.52:  -- that's true, and, and I think also that, um, the women actually have a,
c-, you have a little bit more variety, m-, maybe lighter cotton clothing in
the summer,

B.53:  Oh, yeah.

A.54:  and woolens in the winter, where as the, the men often,

B.55:  It,

A.56:  have to wear shirt and tie [laughter] no matter,

B.57:  Uh-huh, just suits.

A.58:  Right, right. #What time of, what time of the year.#

B.59:  #There's not a whole lot of fabric variance there.#

A.60:  That's right.

B.61:  Uh, they can't have a rayon suit.

A.62:  Tha-, [laughter] That's, that's true, so, um,

B.63:  So,

A.64:  do they, were, were there, um, are you allowed to, um, be casual, like if
it was summer, were, were you allowed to wear sandals, and those, tha-, not
real,

B.65:  Not really, I think, I mean it's kind of unwritten, but I think we're
supposed to wear hose and, and shoes,

A.66:  Right.

B.67:  you know?  Most of the people do, anyway, and most of the women wear, um,
m-, actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else.

A.68:  Oh, I see, uh-huh.

B.69:  But, I'm not in that professional of a position, so,

A.70:  Okay, and, and --

B.71:  I don't, I'm not expected to do that.

A.72:  -- and also, like the, um, also the, the, all the supporting kind of stuff,
secretaries, and clerks and things, are they also,

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  they have same, similar?

B.75:  Yes, pretty much,

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  I'm a secretary.  Yeah.

A.78:  Yeah, ours were, ours were different.  I guess it seemed like th-, they
were much, there was much more casual dress, although I don't think everybody
looked at that, you know as a good thing.

B.79:  Yeah, but there's really no written rule, 

A.80:  Right.

B.81:  I guess they couldn't write that down, that might be discrimination, or
something, I don't know [laughter].

A.82:  That's, [laughter] that's right.

B.83:  I mean, I've never been told what to wear or what not to wear.  It's just,
you know, judging from what everyone else wears,

A.84:  Yeah.

B.85:  is how I determine,

A.86:  Yeah and,

B.87:  you know, what I feel a, comfortable in.  

A.88:  That's right.

B.89:  You don't want to stand out too much.

A.90:  Yeah, that's true.  And, um, um.  ((Well, let's see)),

B.91:  Well, that pretty much covers the topic [laughter].

A.92:  Yeah. [laughter] I don't know what el-, what more we could say about that,
that,

B.93:  Well, thanks for calling me.

A.94:  I was, yeah, nice talking to you, and I guess we just hang up, huh?

B.95:  Yep.

A.96:  #Okay, alright.#

B.97:  #That's all.  Good-bye.#  

A.98:  Nice talking to you.  Bye-bye.

B.99:  Okay, bye.
