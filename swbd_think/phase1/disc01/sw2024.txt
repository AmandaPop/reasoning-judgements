=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Wonderful touch tone telephone there.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?

B.4:  Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies, therefore, my, my
reading pleasures are quite wide.  Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS
HIGHWAY,

A.5:  Oh.

B.6:  which is, uh, very colorful, and, uh, not being a native of Texas, but
being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the
different areas of the co-, of the, of the state by reading it.

A.7:  Right, I've read that one too.  I only had a subscription once, but my
mother always gave me hers and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little
things that you find out about Texas.  

B.8:  Oh yeah, it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken
out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.  It's
pretty, pretty neat. [talking] {background} Um, oh, I like photography,
um, magazines.  I don't take a subscription or anything like that.  Um, things,
oh, being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building
magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different
ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an
engineering manual or something laying around the house and then I'll sit up
and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it, but, uh.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  How about yourself?

A.13:  Well, um, I have an interest in art, so I, frequently purchase and read,
uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.

B.14:  Oh, that's great.

A.15:  And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh,
type books.  Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the
Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  That's fairly interesting.

B.18:  I bet that would be, rather interesting.  Uh, that's, uh, self
improvement, that's, that's alwa-, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self
improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.

A.19:  Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
How about you?

B.20:  Um, well I hate to, yes, I do [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes and, and
they give you books and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT
AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl ((Albrecht)).  It talks about, uh, who the customer
is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture
here at Texas Instruments.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  Uh, one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you
better be serving someone who is.  

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer
is and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.  Your my
customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the
car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking
about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and
these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  Which all, you know, betters yourself.

A.31:  Yeah, yeah, well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I
don't think of in terms of self improvement.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I mean they are but I don't label it as such.

B.34:  [Laughter] Like what for example.

A.35:  Well, I don't know, um, I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some
tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they
sometimes have manuals and things, but, uh, they would be things on like how
to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.  You know ge-, getting your,
yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do
what you really want to do.

B.36:  Sure.

A.37:  Convincing you that you need to get on with it.

B.38:  Sure.  How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a
big, okay.

A.39:  Yes.

B.40:  So those are self improvements.  

A.41:  Sure.

B.42:  Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY
SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.

A.43:  Um.

B.44:  By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L {spells it out} and it's a
very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.
And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is
how to manage engineers [laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  So it's, it's ver-, it's interesting, here again it's, it's casual reading
and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, ((mechanical)) stuff and it's really
excellent fast reading and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's
difficult to, to know if it's, you know, I think if somebody would say hey,
read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be
turned off to them.

A.47:  Yeah, yeah.

B.48:  If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book
and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.

A.49:  [Laughter] I don't know, I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen
King.  That's a little, little heavy for me.

B.50:  Yeah, they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so
interesting and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the
movies, but, uh, 

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.  I
have a hard time finishing books.

A.53:  Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality
improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot
at work.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything
that comes across the, the, the airways (( )).

A.55:  Oh, yeah, you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
but, uh,

B.56:  Exactly, exactly right.

A.57:  I think sometimes the word is a little over used but,

B.58:  Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and
don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.  I think it's just
focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and, and all that kind of rolls
in together there,

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.

A.61:  Okay, well, any other comments.

@@B.62:  Uh, not that I can think of.  Um, I think I'm under my quota a little
bit.  I need to probably make a phone call or two [laughter].

A.63:  Well we just started, right.

B.64:  Uh, this is true.  I've enjoyed it.

A.65:  Well you too, and uh, good-bye.

B.66:  Have a good day.

A.67:  Good-bye.

B.68:  Bye-bye [/talking].
