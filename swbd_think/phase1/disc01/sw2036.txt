===========================================================================

A.1:  So what do you think, uh, do you know any people from Puerto Rico?

B.2:  Uh, yes, I, I used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when I worked for
Hewlett-Packard.

A.3:  Oh really.

B.4:  And, uh, he was a native and had gone to school there,

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  and got transferred to Colorado where I was living.  Uh, and, he had
some interesting times getting used to it, um, used to the United States, the,
the language was a little bit different, although he did speak English.  It
was just some of the phr-,

A.7:  Yeah, have you ever been there?

B.8:  Excuse me.

A.9:  Have you ever been there?

B.10:  I've never been there, my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a
chemical plant down there.  I almost moved there when I was in high school.
 
A.11: Really.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  No, I've never been there either.  I've not known but just a few people
from there. 

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  One, uh, there was a girl in, in  my flight in, in, uh, Air Force basic
training, actually who was from there.

B.16:  Uh-huh, okay.  Uh, my dad flew down there for about a year.  He was down
there about once a month, one week per month.  

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  And, uh, I wanted to move there.  It sounded like, uh, a neat place to
live, an island in the sun, you know.

A.19:  Oh, yeah. [laughter] It always sounds more,

B.20:  And, uh, it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't
want to go, because she didn't play golf or tennis and [laughter] [breathing]
there wasn't really a job for her there.

A.21:  Oh, its, I think, I think everything always sounds more glamorous than it
really is.  

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  Ever-, e-, because I spent five years in Europe,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  and everybody goes, oh, you're so lucky and I'm like, well yeah, sort of,
you know,

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  it's, but, having lived there it's not, it's not anything like you
picture it, 

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  you know, it's not, it's like I still have the fantasies about Hawaii,
and all that stuff but,

B.30:  Yeah, I lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same
thing to me, oh, it must have been great.

A.31:  And your just like, yeah well, sort of, right [laughter]. 

B.32:  I go, oh, it was just a place to live, yeah, I was,

A.33:  But, um, what do you think about, about, um, their situation, should
they, should they become a state?

B.34:  I, I think the status quo seems to be working.  I don't think, um, from
talking to Jerry, my friend that lived there, 

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  that they don't seem, um, upset about it or anything and I think it would
upset more people if they tried to change it.

A.37:  Really.  I, I think, I'm not opposed to it but when its, when the time is
right it will probably just kind of happen, you know.

B.38:  Yeah,  I don't know fifty-one stars on this flag wouldn't look too
good [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter] Where are they going to put the other one.

B.40:  Yeah, if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty-two might
be able to, uh, be arranged better, I don't know.

A.41:  Well, where, where are we going to get another state.

B.42:  Yeah, I don't know, cut California in half or something.

A.43:  [Laughter] Or Texas.  No that's not a good idea.

B.44:  But, um, I know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because
they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the
stuff.

A.45:  Oh, yeah.

B.46:  Um, and they make, I guess it's no income tax there, or fed-, no federal
income tax, something like that.

A.47:  Oh yeah, because it's just a territory.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Or, is that what it's called, a territory?

B.50:  Um, yeah I think it's a territory. 

A.51:  Okay.

B.52:  That makes sense.  I mean there's, uh, lots of tiny islands in the South
Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like, Guam or,
uh,

A.53:  Is that a U S territory though?

B.54:  Yeah, it's a U S territory, and it's just we own it or, 

A.55:  That would be kind of bizarre. 

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  That's kind of far.

B.58:  Well Hawaii is pretty far too, think about it.

A.59:  Well that's true, but there is not a whole lot between here and there.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  Where you, you start dealing with Guam, it's like, you know, flying over
all these other places to get there.

B.62:  Yeah, it's definitely a way out of the way, where Pu-, where as,

A.63:  My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two, though.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  Which, I don't know.

A.67:  Of course you could annex Cuba, but they wouldn't like that a bit
[laughter].

B.68:  [Laughter]  No, I don't think they would.

A.69:  I don't think they'd go for that.

B.70:  Yeah, but actually, I knew another guy from Puerto Rico that I went to
school with and he was coming, he came to, America to, to go to school. 

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And I think he was going to go back, be an engineer out there.

A.73:  Oh, yeah, he thinks,

B.74:  He was really funny.  Both of the ones I met have been really funny guys.

A.75:  [Laughter].

B.76:  I don't know if that's, uh, if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not,
but the ones I met have been pretty, pretty funny.

A.77:  No, I have no idea, but, uh, so you think that mostly they're, they're
pretty much satisfied with things the way they are.

B.78:  Yeah, I don't, I didn't hear any major complaints about it.  Um, I
definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say, okay you're a
state now or you're your own country, or whatever.

A.79:  Yeah, exactly.

B.80:  But, um, let them decide.

A.81:  Really.  That's why I said, you know, when it, when, when their time is
right, when they're ready for it, you know, that it will come about.

B.82:  Yeah, yeah, I think that makes the most sense.

A.83:  Okay, well Rick, it's been good talking to you.

@@B.84:  Okay, ha-, have we been on for a long enough time?

A.85:  I think so, I think its, they want like five minutes or something, don't
they.

B.86:  Okay, yeah, this is, this is actually the first time I've, I've had
someone call me so --

A.87:  Oh, okay.

B.88:  -- but, uh, it went fine.

A.89:  #Okay, bye-bye.#

B.90:  #All right, well# it was good talking to you Becky.  Bye-bye.
