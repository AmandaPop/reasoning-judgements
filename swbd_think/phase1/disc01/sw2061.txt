REMARKS:         Speakers talk over each other a lot.  Especially A.  A talks
very rapidly and so is hard to understand.

============================================================

A.1:  [Music] Hello.

B.2:  Hello.

A.3:  Hey, how you doing?

B.4:  Not bad, not bad.  What's your name?

A.5:  Fernando.

B.6:  Fernando.  My name is Nick.

A.7:  Wait.  Let me turn off my stereo here [/music].

B.8:  Sure [cough].

A.9:  Because I've been, like, waiting, like, for about ten minutes to get
connected to somebody.

B.10:  Really?

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Phew {almost like a whistling sound}.  #Man, I'm,# 

A.13:  #Yeah.#  What time is it over th-, are you, are you in Dallas?

B.14:  No, no.  I'm in Detroit.  Or not Detroit.  I'm in, uh, California.

A.15:  Are you?

B.16:  Yeah.  #((I)).#

A.17:  #Because# every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas.  

B.18:  Really?

A.19:  Yeah.  I'm in North Carolina.

B.20:  Oh.  Well, you're on the, uh, let's see,

A.21:  On the other coast [laughter].

B.22:  Yeah, twenty-one {sounds like he is talking to someone other than speaker}.
Yeah.  Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost?

A.23:  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.

B.24:  Yeah, [laughter] okay.  All right.  Well I guess we're supposed to talk,
what about credit #card?#

A.25:  #W-,# wait.  Wh-, what did, how, how did you get to know about the T I
thing?

B.26:  Oh, one of my instructors, uh, said that they were doing something like
this and.

A.27:  Wha-, what are you working on [breathing]?

B.28:  A, a Masters in, uh, information systems.

A.29:  Really.  I'm doing my Masters in, in computer science and computer
engineering.

B.30:  Yeah?  Where at?

A.31:  At North Carolina State University.

B.32:  Hey.  How do you like it out there [clicking]?

A.33:  Uh, I don't.  Because, uh, I come from a lot, a bigger city than this one
and --

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  -- #I, I'm# in Raleigh #and,# 

B.36:  #Oh.#  Raleigh Durham.  Yeah.

A.37:  Yeah.  That area.  And it's really small.  All, all you have is like towns
built around universities.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Like Chapel Hill?

B.40:  Yeah.  So it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway.  Kind of quaint
little towns #but they# --

A.41:  #Yeah.#

B.42:  -- don't have a whole lot there.

A.43:  Where you at?

B.44:  Uh, well, I'm in Monterey, California right now [barking].  Yeah.

A.45:  Oh, okay.  So, so I mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two
hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it.

B.46:  Two hundred fifty?

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Okay.  It, it's, it's a lot bigger than Monterey is.  But we're just, uh,
just south of, uh, San Jose and San Francisco.

A.49:  Oh, okay.

B.50:  And it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a, you know, to a
large city.

A.51:  So, so where do you go?  Do you go to Berkeley?

B.52:  No, no.  I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here.

A.53:  Oh, okay.  Because, uh, I was looking at, at the,

B.54:  [Cough].

A.55:  doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley [sigh].

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or
#something# --

B.58:  #[Thumping] Uh-huh.#

A.59:  -- like that.  And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like
ninety-nine percentile and #this and that.#

B.60:  #Yeah.#

A.61:  And it's like,

B.62:  Well, that's what they look for.  Whether or not they get it is hard to say
[noise] {sounds like a chair is drug across the floor}.

A.63:  [Swallowing] Yeah, I know.  That's why, that's why I didn't apply.  I mean,
it was like --

B.64:  Yeah [talking].

A.65:  -- for me, it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety
and,

B.66:  [Talking].

A.67:  ninety-nine percentile on the, on the #verbal part.#

B.68:  #Yeah.  It's# pretty tough.  It's pretty tough [/talking].  I, uh, let's
face it, you know.  And, you know, I, you know, did the, you know, as far as,
I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know, the school
only takes you so far, you know.  It's what you do.

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  You know.  So, uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.  

A.71:  So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?

B.72:  Probably not.  See I'm in the Navy.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  And, uh, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until
I, if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy.

A.75:  When do you get out?

B.76:  Oh, probably be another twelve years.

A.77:  Oh, okay [laughter].

B.78:  Oh, you know I like what #I'm doing right now.#

A.79:  #But, uh, but what if# they pay for it?

B.80:  Excuse me?

A.81:  [Swallowing] What if they pay for?

B.82:  If they pay for a P H D?

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Nah, they won't pay for it.  They've, I think they have maybe two people a
year go get, ((get)) their #P H D.#

A.85:  #Because# I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, uh,
[inhaling] the Army.  #Uh,# 

B.86:  #Yeah.#  They civilians or, uh, military?

A.87:  I think, I think they're military.  #But, I# --

B.88:  #Uh-huh [popping].#

A.89:  -- mean, the guy is still in.

B.90:  #Uh-huh.#

A.91:  #And,# uh, h-, uh, he works over in Maryland [swallowing].  

B.92:  Uh-huh [talking].

A.93:  And so he's doing his Masters here.  They gave him like a scholarship like
for a year.

B.94:  #Yeah.#

A.95:  #And# he's doing it in like, in a year and a summer.  

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  And so he's getting that and, uh --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- they said like they got a lot of benefits and that.  That's why you want
to join.

B.100:  #Uh-huh.#

A.101:  #But, uh,# this guy, I mean you can earn a lot more money so you say, I go
why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your,
your, your Masters.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so.

B.104:  Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money
[barking] that keeps pe-, that keeps people #((in)).#

A.105:  #Yeah.#

B.106:  They, they like what they're doing.  They, you know, they feel good about
what they're doing.  #That type of thing.  It's more [popping],# 

A.107:  #But I mean, I mean, you, the,# once you get your Masters, you can be
earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a
year.

B.108:  Uh-huh [barking].

A.109:  And --

B.110:  Oh, easily, #I'm sure.#

A.111:  -- #and that's# not what they're paying.

B.112:  No.  Well, it depends on what rank you are, #of course [/barking].# 

A.113:  #Yeah.#  Yeah, I know [laughter].

B.114:  I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper
level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to
seventy grand a year.

A.115:  Yeah.  But that's, uh,

B.116:  Yeah.  Those are few and far between #though.#

A.117:  #Yeah.#  #It's like,#

B.118:  #[Laughter].#

A.119:  it's like, uh, in I B M.  In I B M, you can get certain points --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- and, uh, everyone's a manager.  But nobody can get one more point to
become, you know, like whatever you need to earn #so much money.#

B.122:  #Yeah.  Since# I imagine it's fairly #competitive.#

A.123:  #Yeah.# It's like, no I, I mean, I B M is like, there's a joke about I B M
which says, you know, it's like, uh, all, all the major companies get into a,
a boating race, right?

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.  

B.126:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.127:  And then they come in last and they have this whole team, you know,
analyze why they came in last right.  Because the ((person)) asked for it.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  Saying, he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying
row, row, row and one person rowing, right.

B.130:  #[Laughter].#

A.131:  #So he goes,# have you come up with a -lution, uh, have you come up with a
solution?  They go, yeah, change the rower #[laughter].  You know, it's like
everyone's a,#

B.132:  #[Laughter].#

A.133:  manager but, you know, #it's like# --

B.134:  #Yeah.#

A.135:  -- only use like one person does the work so.

B.136:  Too many chiefs and #not enough Indians.#

A.137:  #Yeah. So.#

B.138:  Yeah.  I don't know, that can be, that, that can really slow you down.  

A.139:  Yeah.  Well, that's the way it works.  I mean, that's, that's why they're
having problems.  I mean, everyone's a manager and,

B.140:  I didn't realize that.

A.141:  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work
there --

B.142:  Uh-huh.

A.143:  -- are, uh, very few.  And then the other people just plan it, you know.
It's like, #it's like have you, have# --

B.144:  #(( )) push paper around.#

A.145:  -- have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the,
with, uh, the think tank?

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  You know, like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just
going, you know, like what shall we do?  Has anybody thought of anything?

B.148:  [Cough].

A.149:  No.  And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.  They go
what's that?  This track which it's going around the world and they can tell
you where your package is anywhere, any time.

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  And so it's like the same thing with I B M.  You know, so they have this
think tank.  And they got to come up with ideas.  But, see, uh, the, the thing
is, that I B M is so stabilized that #everybody will buy their stuff.#

B.152:  #[Popping] Yeah.# Oh, yeah.  They've got a, they've got basically a, uh,
you know, a lock on a lot of the market.

A.153:  Yeah.

B.154:  And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they
provide, you know, people generally go with that because they figure that the,
you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.  Where's if
you try something different, they'll --

A.155:  And it fails and #you're dead.#

B.156:  -- #they'll say# yeah, why didn't you buy, #why didn't you try something
more mainline.#

A.157:  #Yeah.  Well I B M# doesn't fire anybody.  #Because# --

B.158:  #[Throat_clearing] No.#

A.159:  -- uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job.

B.160:  Uh-huh.

A.161:  Which y-, you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.  So you
quit.

B.162:  Uh.

A.163:  I mean that's their policy.  They never fire anybody unless you're caught
doing something illegally.

B.164:  Illegal or something #like that, yeah.#

A.165:  #Yeah, like# if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
[swallowing].

B.166:  Uh-huh.

A.167:  But they won't let you off.  What they'll do is like [sigh] suppose, you
know, like you're a manager.  So they'll #put# --

B.168:  #Uh-huh.#

A.169:  -- you into keeping up the paper, you know.  It's like how much paper is
going in?  And then #you# --

B.170:  #Uh-huh.#

A.171:  -- say that's not my job, so you quit.

B.172:  So, in other words, that's the way they #force# --

A.173:  #Right.#

B.174:  -- people out [cough].  That's why they can say, you know, there's #no
layoff# --

A.175:  #Right.#

B.176:  -- policy.  But it does-, they don't really say that, you know, you're,
you're always going to have great #career# --

A.177:  #Right.#

B.178:  -- conditions.  He-, hey, that's kind #of sad.#  

A.179:  #No, but# I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different
policy.  I don't know.  My dad works for them but it's like I B M like never
in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.  It's
like --

B.180:  No.

A.181:  -- they won't say,

B.182:  Well, they're the standard right now.  Or as far as that goes, you know,
people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.  And the 
main,

A.183:  Yeah.  Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.

B.184:  [Cough].

A.185:  And anybody can fix it.  

B.186:  Uh-huh.

A.187:  And so that's what you're going to go for.  

B.188:  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big #thing.#

A.189:  #And,# and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge.  Have you
ever heard of Leading Edge?

B.190:  Yeah.  They are out of Korea right.

A.191:  What?

B.192:  Leading Edge.  Don't they pro-, 

A.193:  They, they made like, uh, small personal computers.

B.194:  Yeah.  Small P C -s.  (( )) they're out of Korea right?

A.195:  I don't know.  I don't know.  But what they do is, what they did, I don't
know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away.

B.196:  Uh-huh.

A.197:  And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.

B.198:  #Oh, yeah [laughter].#

A.199:  #Yeah.#  

B.200:  [Cough].

A.201:  (( )) for example, you test a chip.  It can't last seven years but it can
last five.  I B M says let's throw it away.  Leading Edge will say we'll buy
it from you.

B.202:  Okay.

A.203:  And so that's, I mean, they're still around I think.

B.204:  Yeah.  I've seen, well I've seen them around #anyway. You know (( )).#

A.205:  #[Clicking] [swallowing] So, that's what they do.# They buy all, all the
things that I B M throws away and they (( )), and that's why they're so
compatible.

B.206:  Uh-huh.

A.207:  Because I mean and by the time you have computer for five years, you're
going to throw it away anyway.  #You know.#

B.208:  #Most people do.#  Or they have to anyway.

A.209:  Well, I mean, there's like, well in a way you realize, I mean, one t-, one
of my teachers got this computer which, you know, it's like, uh, voice, uh,
synthesizing stuff.

B.210:  Uh-huh.

A.211:  And he got that.  He said, you know, it's like, uh, [swallowing] I was
testing it and it was wonderful.  And then when you tried to erase and
correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.

B.212:  #Wow.#

A.213:  #And I want more,# you know.  And it's like Jesus Christ, you know, it's
like why do you want more.  Because it's like one second of recording.  I mean
you put into Wave --

B.214:  Uh-huh.

A.215:  -- and you want to correct the errors into Wave, it takes so much, I mean,
it's like, of course it does.  I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by
mark off model and you put it in there, and you want to correct those.  And
then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth so you can
approximately, of course it's going to take a lot.  #Imagine, imagine# --

B.216:  #It's amazing.  Yeah.#

A.217:  -- what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.  It's like,
[laughter] Jesus Christ.

B.218:  Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the
more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory
they're going to #require.#

A.219:  #Yeah.#  Yeah.

B.220:  Yeah.  Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know, #standard# --

A.221:  #Yeah.#

B.222:  -- memory or disk mem-, #disk base, so.#

A.223:  #Well, like# they say, like nobody can get enough, you know.  It's like
once you have #something, ((and it's like))# --

B.224:  #Oh, yeah.  You find out more,# 

A.225:  -- I was watching this program on T V yesterday.  In nineteen 
seventy-six --

B.226:  Yeah.

A.227:  -- NASA came up with Three D graphics.  Right.

B.228:  Uh-huh.

A.229:  And they were showing this like Three D g-, Three D graphics view of 
like,

B.230:  Like the (( )) deal?

A.231:  What?  #No, no, no.#

B.232:  #Like a hologram?#

A.233:  This is like, #this is like# --

B.234:  #With just graphics on, on a,# 

A.235:  -- video game stuff.  #Okay?#

B.236:  #Okay [cough].#

A.237:  But the only thing was, that it was just lines, okay.  Like if you
[/breathing],
