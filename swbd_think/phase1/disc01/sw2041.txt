REMARKS:	The conversation was difficult to transcribe because the
callers kept interrupting each other and talking at the same time.
Caller B held phone very close to mouth and breathed loudly through out!

==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes?
[Breathing] [laughter].

B.2:  We, uh, well, uh, my, my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  He's an aerobics instructor.  And, um, is going to be, uh, entering
[breathing] North Texas [breathing] for uh, a Kinesiology program there.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And, um, [breathing] the, the how I met him was through, uh, the aerobics
class that he used to teach.

A.7:  Uh-huh. You're a student?

B.8:  Yeah, so.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, [breathing] uh, person and just very, very
athletic.  Enjoying a th-, you know, uh, anything dealing with sports.

A.11:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.12:  So, and how do you feel about it? [Laughter].

A.13:  Uh, I'm, I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise.  I, 

B.14:  [Breathing].

A.15:  I don't feel like I, I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise.
I don't feel well unless I am exercising and I try to do things that involve
exercise, but, I very rarely do things like, um, I've never done aerobics or
any sort of structured, this is my exercise time --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- but, I do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know,
mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that, and I spend a lot of
time and I probably get more exercise than your average person.  But, it's not
a, a structured sort of thing, and I have to admit I have a certain resistance
to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or
something like that.

B.20:  Yeah, well I, I've, my, that's the way my mother stands on it.  She feels
like if it's something that you have to do, you know,

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  if you look at it as if you have to do it, 

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  then it becomes, it becomes a chore,

A.25:  Yes, #yes.#

B.26:  #and,# and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.  So, um, and I feel
that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the
idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something, you know, to,

A.27:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.28:  you're a calcu-, you know calculated down and do your calisthenics,

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  you know, three times a week or,

A.31:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.32:  but, but I do try and, um, I do try and regulate how much exercise I
get a week.

A.33:  Yeah, yeah.  Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're
not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, 

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  it makes it less of a chore?

B.36:  And, it's got, and I've always enjoyed dance.  

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  So it involves, you know, I, I can't get out to dance all the time and, 

A.39:  Yeah, would that we could [laughter]. 

B.40:  Yeah, [laughter] and it's, and it's more regulated, I mean you're, you're
using different parts of the body.

A.41:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.42:  So, it, it is like dance, an-, and it's structured like that, but you have
the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting,

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  so, it makes it easier for me.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's
move that way,

A.47:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.48:  instead of me having to think about it so much.

A.49:  Right.  You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all
you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.

B.50:  Yeah, yeah.  But, I'm like you, I also, um, like to participate in, uh,
things like, well, we just went to the, uh, Myererson Symphony Run this past
weekend, and, and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people,

A.51:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.52:  and, um, just get out, you know,

A.53:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.54:  out and about, and it's, it, it's something you can all, like our, we did
it as a family, so,

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  it was, it was quite a lot of fun.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  and, biking and I, I, I love to swim, so I love it when, you know, it's
swimming weather,

A.59:  Um.

B.60:  and, uh,

A.61:  Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming
weather [laughter].

B.62:  Oh, I didn't realize that.

A.63:  Uh [laughter].

B.64:  I'm sorry.  

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  Well, I'm in Texas.  I, I just assumed that I had, this is the first call
I've done,

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  and, I didn't realize that they ha-, were going to reach out to people
from,

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  all over the country.  

A.71:  [Laughter].  

B.72:  You wouldn't know that [laughter].  Oh, I, 

A.73:  So, it's the, it's, it's the, the act-, well it's actually, it's
interesting, because there are re-, real regional differences.  Um, in
California there's, uh, almost an assumption,

B.74:  [Breathing].

A.75:  um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something,
you know, in your sixties, or something like that, I'm, I'm, I'm not.  Uh,
there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and,
and, at least in urban California.  And, maybe not, I don't know about rural
California too well.  But, in urban California it's just, you know, for all I
know aerobics started out here.  I don't know where they actually started, but
they, you know, the craze really picked up big here and before that there was
the running craze.  And, they, California gets, you know, tends to be a bit
faddish, but,

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere.  So, there
must be something to some of them.  And, uh,

B.78:  Well, I think people are, are more inc-, um, um, people from California
seem to be more health motivated all around.  I mean, as far as the diet, and
everything.  Uh, the diet and, uh, just your health consciousness, and, I mean,
it just,

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  seems like, uh, a lot of those ideas generate out of California.  Not
just exercise, but,

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  health, health related ideas.  And, I, it's curious, I don't know why,
don't know if it's, do you, does California have a,

A.83:  Well, there's a sense of it being a package, 

B.84:  [Breathing].

A.85:  I think.  There, there is a sense of, you know, whole, there's a lot of,
you know, you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or
whatever.  And, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, University of California at Berkeley
puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER.  Which is, uh, turned into a fairly well
subscribed to, uh, newsletter,

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and, and, it
doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or
anything.  It, it's on fairly so-, solid scientific ground.  Uh, it's just
dispensed with these distinctions.  It says ever-, all sorts of factors go
into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so
that they, they combined them all together.  And, uh, so it's had that
orientation for quite some time.  Um, there's been some progressive medical
schools out here,

B.88:  Uh-huh [breathing].

A.89:  that have taken that approach.  And, um, 

B.90:  Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole
health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or
that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that
into their program.

A.91:  #Boy,#

B.92:  #Do you# think the program came #first or the,#

A.93:  #yeah, that,# there's a, I, I can say there's a correlation, but I
couldn't say which, which caused the other.  They sort of, dev-, you know,
each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and
develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.

B.94:  Yeah, the more money they put into it.

A.95:  Yeah.  And, 

B.96:  I can see that.  And, cause, I, knowing from institutes of learning like
that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere, and somebody's
got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it, so,

A.97:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  And, part of it is California, 

B.98:  [Breathing].

A.99:  you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements and
some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them,
um, had an impact on the society around here.  And one of the ones that had an
impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices, ((I'm not
sure)) if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is
similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved
medicine.  Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things
out here.  And, and you could have them around long enough and more and more
people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other
things,

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this
whole package of, of health, of health care and options --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.  The irony
is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented
towards doing the exercise.  And, I guess because they spend all day in back
of their desks.  The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally,
now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything --

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  -- but at least traditionally, #the laborers, last thing,# 

B.106:  #Or they're older.#

A.107:  Pardon me.

B.108:  Well, don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-.  I, I
sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in
the city.

A.109:  Oh, #like everything else.#

B.110:  #I live in a rural area,# so,

A.111:  #Yeah, yeah. The rat race to exercise [laughter].#

B.112:  #you know, I see that.# It's, yeah, it's, it's like it's frantic, to,

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  you know, to, uh, achieve, something that, that a person in a rural area,
uh, almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree, but stays, you know,
almost healthier, you know,

A.115:  Yeah, well I, 

B.116:  as a fit person [breathing].

A.117:  I think so.  I mean you, you've, if you look at cert-, if you look at other
cultures, like I know a little bit about people who were considered very
healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all.  But,
they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise, and they combine
it with a, you know, meditation or whatever.  Some sort of relaxation --

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  -- and, they seem pretty, you know, they don't have the hard body.  They
don't have that perfect look, and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image
conscious.  But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some
[laughter], you know,

B.120:  Yeah,

A.121:  And, that, that's,

B.122:  Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?

A.123:  and, a lot of that is diet.  That's true.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  Yeah, I mean, they eat, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat.

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  Um, for economical reasons, not for preference.  Um,

B.128:  Yeah and as we can see.  Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian so, uh,
I've read a lot of information, #knowing that to be true,# 

A.129:  #Yeah am I actually.#

B.130:  What's that?

A.131:  I, as am I.

B.132:  Oh, are you also [laughter],

A.133:  Yes [laughter].

B.134:  [Laughter] Well that's, that's good as far as the cal-, is that, is that,
um, pretty predominant as far as California do-, doe-,

A.135:  It is in the urban areas, yes.

B.136:  In the urban areas?

A.137:  Most, for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little
vegetarian section now.

B.138:  Uh-huh.  Oh that's wonderful.

A.139:  Well most, most, mo-, sort of modern looking restaurants will, 

B.140:  Yeah.

A.141:  you can, 

B.142:  That's great, I mean, we, uh, it's such a chor-, it's such a trouble here.
I mean, you just have to eat at home basically.

A.143:  I was wondering that, because I was actually applying for a job in Texas,
and, and, and, uh,

B.144:  #Well of course in the cities,#

A.145:  #it occurred to me,#

B.146:  yeah, well, in the cities, we live close to Dallas, 

A.147:  Uh-huh.

B.148:  so, uh, which, you know, you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from
all over the country, so,

A.149:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.150:  you're going to have a lot of di-, more choices, but, 

A.151:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.152:  but, in urban areas it's, you know, steak places, an,

A.153:  Yeah.

B.154:  and it's not a, you know, it's, uh, it's definitely, it, it's, it's
changing to a degree, but, um, it's very frustrating.

A.155:  Yeah.

B.156:  And, even, even with health food stores and stores where you can buy
natural products or, uh, organic, you know, materials,

A.157:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.158:  and foods and things. You don't really have that, I mean, you would
think.
