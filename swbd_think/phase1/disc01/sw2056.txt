=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  All right.  Do you have any kids?

B.3:  No.

A.4:  I've got two and it is hard to find day-care for them.

B.5:  What, um, what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those?
{pause}.

A.6:  [Breathing] [laughter] Oh [baby].

B.7:  What would you like to see in one?

A.8:  Well, I, I've seen the bad side in most of them.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  I took my son to a day-care one time when he was, ju-, ri-, you know, just,
uh, not even three month old and, uh, you know, it was a desperate thing, and,
um, when my husband went to pick him up, she, he said that the baby had been
crying a-, the whole time.  He was a sleep but, you know, how they cry in
their sleep?

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  And, uh, you know, this, uh, couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep,
and that turned me off of day-cares.

B.13:  I bet.

A.14:  And then, when I took, uh, I've seen these kids that, uh, it's a church
volleyball, they have a day-care set up there for people playing volleyball,

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  and, uh, one of the girls was real mean to the kid. 

B.17:  Um.

A.18:  And that was, you know, he, she'd just, she had treated him like family
does.

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  You know.  And, um, you know, it, uh, I know most of the girls up there and
the ones that keeps my kids are real good.  Uh, my son doesn't like people too
much,

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  but, uh, when, when we leave there he's, uh, gives the girl a hug and
tells her, I'll miss you, so,

B.23:  Oh, well that's good.

A.24:  you know, so, I know they treat him good.

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  Uh [child_talking].

B.27:  Is it, I don't know, maybe would you think a better student to teacher
ratio.  Do they have too many kids in most day-cares for the,

A.28:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.29:  people they have?

A.30:  Uh, I, I don't know much about day-cares itself, you know,

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  uh, you know, this is more of just the nursery for three and under and,
uh, there's only, there's two people taking care of about five kids, uh, where
I'm f-, where I'm taking my two.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  And, but, uh, in most places, yeah, they got forty-five kids, at bes-, I
guess --

B.35:  Oh, my goodness.

A.36:  -- you know, and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids.

B.37:  Yeah.  Um,

A.38:  Uh.

B.39:  we don't, yeah, we don't have any but we have, you know, plenty of
sisters and brothers that, that have them and I, I'm not sure that there is a
solution to that, as far as, uh, th-, th-, d-, you know, everybody has in
their mind the kind of day-care that they want, but it seems, you know, that
there's not really the perfect one out there.

A.40:  No, there's not.  Nobody can take care of your kids better than you.

B.41:  Right.  And that's not even possible anymore, [barking] I don't think, to
be able to take care of your own kids without, you know, with everybody
working these days.

A.42:  Well, I had to quit my job because of, um, m-, my two.  You know, um,
day-care-wise, baby-sitting-wise and stuff [noise], um, because, you know, my
sister was keeping them, uh, uh,

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  we just lucked out and she, uh, met a military man who lived down here
and we came down here for T I, and, uh, so I had her baby sitting but she was
six months pregnant and it was,

B.45:  Oh, yeah. 

A.46:  getting too much for her.  So, I just quit.  I'd rather quit and take
care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them.

B.47:  Yeah, that seems probably the best way to do it.

A.48:  Well, you know they're getting raised right.

B.49:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I haven't really, the only day-cares that I have been
familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem
to, from my experience be the best at what they're doing,

A.50:  Yes.

B.51:  just because of what they're based on.

A.52:  Yeah.  If, um, I, I know one church that, uh, there was some problems with
but that was just, uh, basically a personal problem between,

B.53:  [Cough].

A.54:  the mother and the, uh, person that was ta-,

B.55:  Oh.

A.56:  in charge.  But, uh, the church, uh, day-care that my kids, they don't go
to a day-care, you know, it's, uh, during Sunday school and stuff.  Uh,

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  the people there are really nice.

B.59:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thi-, I think that's, that's important.

A.60:  Yeah.  Well, they, I think it's one of the important things.

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  If, uh, because if they don't like it, uh, you can't get them, that
separation thing,

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  and I need, tha-, my kids I need to cut the strings on them, they're not
very old but,

B.65:  How old are they?

A.66:  Three and, uh, four and two.

B.67:  Oh.

A.68:  So, you know, they're, they're good kids.

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  You know, they do bad things but they're good kids.

B.71:  Well, you know, kids, kids [laughter].

A.72:  [Laughter].

B.73:  do those.

A.74:  Yeah. Uh, but, I don't like the punishment the day-care does.  You know, I
don't know exactly what they,

B.75:  Uh-huh.

A.76:  do but I don't want no one punishing my kids but myself,

B.77:  Right.

A.78:  and that's another problem with day-care because you're not there so you
don't what they're doing.

B.79:  Right.  Right.

A.80:  And if,

B.81:  Yeah.  They're probably, I would think, needs to be, I don't know if they
have any type of, uh, formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of
agencies, you know, people checking up on, like they do nursing homes, you
know.  They drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law
and, and I think they need to do that with day-cares and just see what's going
on.

A.82:  Yeah, that's, that's, that's something that should be brought up with these
people.

B.83:  So, but I'm not really sure.

A.84:  I don't know if they do it either to be truthful.

B.85:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
[laughter] worry about those things.

A.86:  Well, uh, with me I just decided not to face it,

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  and you know, in most, in, in so many words, you know, in one way or the
other I just decided not to face that issue and I just keep them with me.

B.89:  Uh-huh.  Well, I don't know what we've done to solve any of this [laughter]
but I've enjoyed talking with you.

A.90:  [Laughter] Yeah, so have I.  ((Well)).

B.91:  And welcome to Texas.

A.92:  Y-, well, thanks and I guess I, we-, we've been on long enough so you have
a good day.

B.93:  Thank you.

A.94:  All right.  Bye-bye.

B.95:  Bye-bye.
