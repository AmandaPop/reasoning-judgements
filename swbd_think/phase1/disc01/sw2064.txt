=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I am new to Texas, so I don't even know what the law is,

B.2:  Uh-huh?

A.3:  in the state, do you? 

B.4:  Well, yes, of course, we do have capital punishment.  And we've, you 
know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.

A.5:  Oh, that's right, I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the
paper.

B.6:  Yes. 

A.7:  Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes?  Or
just,

B.8:  Yes, it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape,

A.9:  Uh-huh. 

B.10:  this sort of thing. 

A.11:  Um.  Well. 

B.12:  It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get 
into the system.

A.13:  Yes, I know, the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I
recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been
there, [throat_clearing] are going to be killed.  Um, there's people that 
come to the prisons and they're very violent and, they want, I mean they're 
anxious for someone to be killed [child]. 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  Yes.  

A.15:  I just, I can't see that. 

B.16:  That happens on occasion, it sure does, 

A.17:  [Throat_clearing].

B.18:  maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  has affected you personally.  You know, I don't know, or a person
personally.

A.21:  No.

B.22:  I think I would be, you know, I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I
guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death
penalty, I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.  I don't know that it
is.  I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or
not.

A.23:  Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee-,

B.24:  Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah, it goes on for years and years, and costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.

A.25:  Ye-, it's really sad. 

B.26:  Yeah. 

A.27:  I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could
be better than, than, um, expecting,

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  the feeling that it (( )) with, someone is calling for someone else to
be killed, you know.

B.30:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.31:  Is really kind of bad [child].   

B.32:  Yes it is.  It's a tough, tough question.  It really is.

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know,
one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might
be by it.

A.35:  That's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,

B.36:  Oh, absolutely. 

A.37:  repeat, (( )) and never have any chance for,

B.38:  Tha-, that's right.

A.39:  (( )) Oh, I don't know, is it, do you feel at all like, it's a religious
issue?

B.40:  Not with me personally.  It is with a lot of other people. 

A.41:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh. 

B.42:  It's not, not to me personally, no.

A.43:  Um.

B.44:  No.

A.45:  I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things.  I
don't know how I would feel about it.  But like you say, if it hit you
personally,

B.46:  Uh-huh. 

A.47:  closer at home you would feel, 

B.48:  Yes.

A.49:  feel differently. 

B.50:  That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.

A.51:  Do you think most states have that or? [child].

B.52:  Yes, I think most states do have capital punishment.  Yes.

A.53:  Uh-huh, huh.  

B.54:  But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.

A.55:  That still does it, that's right.

B.56:  Yes, they're only, I was reading something about it the other day, I
(( ))think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have
capital punishment still.

A.57:  Uh-huh. 

B.58:  A lot of them had to have el-, elected not to do so.  Now I don't know,
what they do in place of it.  You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you
know, something, I don-, I don't know how they handle it bu-, I was
surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.

A.59:  Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really,
I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row.

B.60:  Oh, yes. 

A.61:  But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.

B.62:  Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through 
appeals.

B.64:  Yes. 

A.65:  Because I know they do frequently, I mean they cover, cover it pretty
heavily on television and the newspaper.

B.66:  Uh-huh. Yes. 

A.67:  If it finally gets to that point. 

B.68:  Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years
just right off the bat.

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, [sniffing] things
that happen cause a person not to,

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  have to go through the whole thing.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  So is it, uh, are we doing lethal injection now?

B.74:  Yes, uh-huh.  That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but
fairly recent, in the state of Texas.  Before that, it was, uh, death by
electrocution.

A.75:  Uh-huh, wh-, which seems so awful. 

B.76:  Yes, it certainly does. 

A.77:  So, it's a little bit more humane, I guess, it is,

B.78:  Yes, it would almost have to be, I suppose.  If you, if you had to chose, 
I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.

A.79:  [Laughter] Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.  

B.80:  Yes, absolutely. 

A.81:  Um.

B.82:  It's a, it's a tough question.  It really is.  I guess, if I had to say yes
or no, I would say, you know, yes.  I, I would have to lean toward capital
punishment, you know, for certain crimes.

A.83:  Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's
not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?

B.84:  No, I don't think it's a monetary thing. 

A.85:  Uh-huh. 

B.86:  I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent
or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like
that.

A.87:  Um.

B.88:  Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.  This
may seem to be the best way out.  I don't know.

A.89:  Yes. 

B.90:  Easiest way out maybe.  No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.

A.91:  Um.  Well, um, and I notice that the crime ((rate)) was  up in the 
Dallas area [throat_clearing]. It's,

B.92:  Yes, especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy. 

A.93:  It's kind of been scary,

B.94:  Yes. 

A.95:  to think about it and,

B.96:  Absolutely. 

A.97:  And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that. 

B.98:  Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does. 

A.99:  You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the,

B.100:  Yes, it's nothing to be proud of, 

A.101:  in statistics, 

B.102:  certainly not. 

A.103:  But I, you know, we have been really fortunate our family,

B.104:  Yes. 

A.105:  hasn't had any crime. 

B.106:  Yes,  so have we been very, very fortunate. 

A.107:  And, so we don't, it's harder to think about the poor people that have 
suffered that way.

B.108:  That's right.  Absolutely.

A.109:  And how they would expect, 

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  how they would hope, I mean you, you hear of people who have, um,
committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the
same thing again.  

B.112:  Absolutely.

A.113:  And you wonder why they can't just stop it.

B.114:  Uh-huh.  That's right. 

A.115:  So, maybe you would, 

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.

B.118:  So would I, I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance, I hope I
never am, like, like everybody else.

A.119:  No, [laughter] I know when, um, we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I
got a summons, jury summons,

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  just like constantly, it seemed like, 

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.

B.124:  Right.

A.125:  And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the
jury, 

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  it's just that, I didn't, I hate having to be in charge of someone
else's life.

B.128:  Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is. 

A.129:  And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case,

B.130:  Yes.

A.131:  involving a violent crime or anything. 

B.132:  So would I. 

A.133:  That would be really awful. 

B.134:  Yes.  Absolutely. 

A.135:  Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this.  
Although it has been difficult but, uh.

B.136:  It is, it's a tough subject, it really is. 

A.137:  I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important,

B.138:  Right.

A.139:  that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.

B.140:  That's right. 

A.141:  Anyway, well, you have a good day.           

B.142:  Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.

A.143:  Thank you, bye-bye. 

B.144:  Uh-huh.  Bye-bye.
