REMARKS:        During speaker A, itself, you could her speaker B breathing 
from the beginning of the conversation to the finishing of the document.
It was difficult to tell whether background rattling noises were on A or B.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Did it click?

@B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  Okay.  Um, well, how do you feel about food and cooking?

B.4:  Oh, I love food and I love to cook.  I really love to cook.  I'm not a
really gourmet cook.  I'm just a normal everyday cook.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  What about you?

A.7:  Well, we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for, I, I just
became a vegetarian over the past, uh, year and a half and it's a real
challenge to find foods, {rattling noise in background} proper foods to eat,
and it's a real challenge not to become, like what they call a junk food
junkie where your menu is composed of, uh, [breathing] things that you want to
eat that aren't, veg-, you know, that aren't, don't contain meat products or
don't contain animal products but maybe aren't, you know, uh, balanced meal,
so to speak.  So, but we, we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians.

B.8:  Don't you, do you miss meat at all?

A.9:  I did at first but, um, not really, no, not, I, I can't imagine eating
meat.  Um, the reason I tranged, uh, changed to become a vegetarian was for
ethical reasons, so, the idea of me eating meet would be like eating
something, you know, I, I think of it as something alive, you know.  So, it, I
can't do it.  You know, f-, for me,

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  it's, it just, but I do, sometimes when I smell meat, you know, when I
smell particularly, uh, say steak or something, you know, that, I, I do admit
that I, you know, s-, wish, you know, that I could have that flavor but
[laughter],

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  but I know what it, I know what it is so I, you know, I don't want it
but,

B.14:  So wa-, if you have, if you have people over would you fix all vegetables
or, you know, when you cook for company, do you fix just all vegetables?

A.15:  Yeah.  Yeah, you, you'd be surprised the things, I mean, you could, like
tonight we're having, uh, nature burgers which are like a grain burger and you
can, it's, really pretty good, I, I, the people I serve it to, like my sister
and family members, well, my family members are vegetarians now basically, I
mean they're not, they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat
other, you know, meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals.  And,
uh, you can ma-, you know, make, uh, pasta meals and different things that
people are use to eating --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- that wouldn't offend, you know, that they wouldn't be offended that
there wasn't a meat there, you know, at the, at the table, or even pizzas, you
can make a pizza that's not, that doesn't have any animal produ-, animal, you
know.  You don't have animal products,

B.18:  Yes, but that's,

A.19:  it would have cheese but, you know, but, you know, not meat.

B.20:  Do you eat cheese?  Do you eat li-, eggs an,

A.21:  Yeah.  We do eat, I, I had become, for about three or four months I was
vegan, which is a person that eats, um, no animal products, no cheeses, no
eggs, and that's even more difficult.  It's really hard to find the products
and it's hard, that's even harder to keep yourself from eating because it, it
adds so much to meals, you know, when you put cheese on something or,

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  you know, it really makes a difference [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Or eggs.  Yeah, eggs.  My mother just said eggs.  It's hard to find
substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  So, although you can, I mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it.
It's a lot more expensive too.  I think, you know, the the, the market is just
not made for a vegan.  So, but, um, 

B.28:  But it's becoming more that way I think it's probably easier now to find
things.

A.29:  Yeah.  It, if, well, it really is because t-, just today we were in the
grocery store and they had lentils and I, you know, I wasn't really sure
whether they would have lentils in the grocery store.  We've been living in
Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a, um, {click with mouth} a health food store
that really had a lot of good stuff and where we're living now is a small town
that really doesn't, you know, just having that kind health food store that
caters to those kind of needs.  And you just have to hope that the grocery
store will, {rattling noise} you know, the bigger grocery stores.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like
that, you know, which, 

B.32:  I don't think I even know what a lentil is.

A.33:  Yeah, see that, lot of people don't and that's,

B.34:  I've heard, I've heard of a lentil.

A.35:  Yeah, like lentil soup or something.

B.36:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.37:  People don't and that's such a good source of protein, or like soybeans,
you know, people think, ugh, they think it's something really horrible but
there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to
begin with that you don't even know where in there.  So, um, [breathing] it's,
it's just a matter of learning, #you had to know.#

B.38:  #You had to learn,# I was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to
cook.

A.39:  Yeah.  So, but it,

B.40:  Oh, no way.  But I bet it's really, I bet it is healthy because a couple
of times last week I went without meat, um, I had pasta and salad for two
days,

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  just because I just, wa-, you know, oh, no particular reason, I just didn't
feel like eating meat and, uh, I think even after two days I felt different.

A.43:  Yeah.  Well, think of it, i-, think of it like this, takes a long time for
meat to digest and, you know, if you've got that sitting in your stomach, I
mean, even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting.  So, you, you
kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so
hard to digest all that meat,

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  you know, because it takes longer than some products, some other foods in
your stomach to digest that meat.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  So.

B.48:  So, when you prepare a meal, like say on Thanksgiving, what do you?

A.49:  [Laughter] Um, you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of
different casseroles and things.  So,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  you just make, you ju-, 

B.52:  Everything but the turkey.

A.53:  No.  Yeah.  You just, you just.  Well,

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  see at ours, uh, we're living with my family, my folks now, so, you know,
they, they have the turkey, you know, they do, they ca-, they, you can't stop,
you know, everyone's life.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  But, um, I think if in our own house we didn't, we would have things like a
casserole, things like that, that centered more on the vegetables, as far as,
we might have one special dish, one special casserole that was our one special
thing, like the turkey,

B.58:  [Noise].

A.59:  you know, with the main meal kind of thing.  And, and I suppose, because
it's for me ethical, we'd just play up the fact that Thanksgiving's, you know,
is a time for everyone to give thanks [laughter] even turkey, you know.

B.60:  [Laughter]  Even for the turkey.  Yeah,

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  that's true.

A.63:  So, um, but it, it's interesting finding different recipes.  Although, my
mother is the one that cooks.  Um, which,

B.64:  Well, do they have special cookbooks out for, for just vegetarian meals,
you know, special books that you,

A.65:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lots of them.  Lots of them and, uh, I have this one in
front of me right now, as a matter of fact, it's called SUNDAYS AT THE 
MOOSEWOOD RESTAURANT, and, uh, it's out of New York, it's a pretty famous
restaurant out of New York, and almost every single recipe in there is, um,
vegetarian.  There are some fish recipes, I think, in it but a few of those
but not anything,

B.66:  But you don't eat fish either, do you?

A.67:  No, we don't eat fish either.  But it, the majority of the book is, um,
vegetarian with no meats, so, or, you know, of any, any kind of animal. So,

B.68:  I have a,

A.69:  there's quite a few out there.

B.70:  I have a hard time with vegetables.  I, I, when I was a kid I didn't like
them very much and I never really learned how to cook them right, I guess.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  I don't know.  Um, I'll eat a little bit of broccoli and I'll steam it and
I like carrots, just certain things, you know, but, uh, I'm not really good
with them and I'll go sometimes and not even fix them, I mean, I'll have
everything else and no vegetable.  That's strange isn't it?

A.73:  Yeah.  It's strange because, well, it, it's not strange because I use to be
the same way and I'm, even to this day, you know, some vegetables really turn
me off, but when you read so much,

B.74:  [Noise].

A.75:  information that says this is a healthier way to go, you know, and this
is what your body wants, this is what your body really needs, and when you
think about what, what's the real reason your eating.  I know, I know it's for
taste because I'm, boy, am I a taste person [laughter],

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  But, but r-, the main reason is for fuel, you know, and, and, y-, when 
you read so much information that tells you that meats and different animal
products, you know, are causing, uh, can cause, uh, different kinds of
diseases, you know, lo-, like h-, heart diseases and different diabetes and
things like that, different kinds of diseases, it's like, uh, is it really
worth it?  And, the people, I, I really think in general, people in the United
States just don't eat enough vegetables, you know, because you can talk grain
all you want as far as, you know, cleaning your system out so to speak, but
you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and, and
the, the, the kind that you can't get from a [noise] little pill,

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  because your body doesn't, doesn't syn-, synthesis in the same way that
it does when it gets it in raw food, you know,

B.80:  But now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins. 

A.81:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  So, you, it's, it's all important, you
know, it's an all important thing you,

B.82:  And I'm terribly overweight.  I'm obese, probably is the word, I've never
used that word on myself before, but I am very large and probably if I could
give up the meat products and just get on vegetables I would probably look a
lot better.

A.83:  I think you'd feel probably a lot healthier.  Um, my, almost everyone in my
family is, is obese.

B.84:  {Speaker B speaks to someone else in the room}.

A.85:  Yeah, I, I would say, you know, th-, almost everyone.  And, uh, exc-,
[talking] except me, except myself and, you know, my husband, but, um, and,
uh, yeah, I, I, I don't know that my mother and father have seen any
improvements since we've been here as far as them switching to meat. {Speaker
B speaks to someone else in the room} Sh-, my mother says she feels healthier.
