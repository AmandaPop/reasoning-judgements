===========================================================================

A.1:  Have you had to put anyone in a nursing home?

B.2:  No, but my husband's mother was in a nursing home.

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  And she was in there, she had (( )), and they put her in a nursing home,
because you couldn't, we couldn't afford a nurse, you know, a all day nurse --

A.5:  Yeah, twenty-four hours.

B.6:  -- yeah, well, at least, as they told us, uh, two shifts --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- you know, that's sixteen hours, because one would come in the morning
and one would be at night, I mean, in the afternoon --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- and then that night, it wouldn't need one, you know, because she would
be sleeping, so I would be here then.

A.11:  Yeah, that would seem like that would be more expensive than a, uh, nursing
home, wouldn't it.

B.12:  Well, the nursing home is covered by, uh, social security, see.

A.13:  Oh, and the nurse at home isn't.

B.14:  And the nurses aren't, no.  

A.15:  Oh, okay, I got you.

B.16:  See, you have to pay that.

A.17:  Yeah, I didn't know that.

B.18:  Oh, yeah, if you put, nursing home (( )) you know, you got to find a good
nursing home is very hard to find, because the people don't [child_talking]
care, most of them don't care, some of them do care.  The work, that, you
know, the nurse aide, that what the problem is.  I think it's the nurses'
aide, they don't pay them enough to keep him there and to do the things that
they need to do.

A.19:  Now, well, my brother in law was working with, uh, in one for a little bit
and, he just, he couldn't handle the things he had to do --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- you know, cleaning up after, by men and women using the [child_talking]
restroom and stuff, he, he, he couldn't handle it.

B.22:  Oh, yeah it's gets bad, some of them, and then depends on the nursing home
and how bad it is, you know, because they have some nursing home that don't
have anybody that's not walking, you know.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  And it just depends on how bad that person is.

A.25:  Well seems to me if a person gets into that area, they, I don't know, it
seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it,
because you do have to go to school on some of it.

B.26:  Yeah --

A.27:  Uh --

B.28:  -- you ought to do your job --

A.29:  -- yeah, and, um,

B.30:  -- and if you can't, if you can't, I think they should get out of it
instead of mistreating the people.

A.31:  Yeah, I've heard a lot of bad things about, um, mistreating people, and,
uh --

B.32:  Well --

A.33:  -- I've even heard of some people being sexually abused.  

B.34:  -- they, yeah that, and they steal,

A.35:  Now, they steal from them?

B.36:  Oh, yeah --

A.37:  I didn't, 

B.38:  -- I used to take, uh, every week, you know, I have to threaten, which it
doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten a people did their
work there.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  You know, like I bring her, I bought her a blanket.  This girl
[child_talking] hand crocheted her a lap blanket, you know, because she sits
in a wheel chair, but she can walk, they just sit them in wheel chairs, and I
told her, I came up there the following week, and it was gone.  I said, where
is it?  She said, in the washer.  I said, I tell you what, when I come back it
better be here, because they went to the washer, we didn't find it.  I said,
You all better find it.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  And you know her bedspread.  I took her a bedspread because sh-, a
comforter, because she was always cold.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  And so, uh, you know, then.  I had to put, write the name on the whole
bedspread.  I'm talking like it's,

A.45:  In each square [laughter] --

B.46:  almost [laughter] --

A.47:  -- all over,

B.48:  -- you know, on both sides, so that they can't turn it over and put it on
somebody else's bed.

A.49:  That's not right.

B.50:  Huh-uh.

A.51:  I've, I've only known two people in a nursing home, and you know, it was my
grandmother and grandfather on my father's side, and I just heard through my
father what was going on --

B.52:  Yeah --

A.53:  -- and, uh,

B.54:  -- well, see, this one I, I is more or less first hand.  You know, she just
died, um, we buried her February, but she had been in there at least, I know,
seven years, eight years.  And he didn't want to put her in there, but he
can't afford it.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  And that's another thing, you know.

A.57:  Say on something, I guess you get forced to do, make decisions.

B.58:  But you don't, it depends on when, didn't you, you have a choice, the only
thing I can say, is you have a choice of where they go, sometimes.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Sometimes you don't.  And then you have to check out the nursing home, and
the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them
in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people.

A.61:  What time you going to come in, just come in, uh.

B.62:  Yeah.  You have to do one of them, you know, spontaneous things, like maybe
three o'clock in the afternoon, or one o'clock in the afternoon, and stuff
like that, because they're not expecting you.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  You know, they expect you like on Saturdays, Friday, you know, Saturdays
and Sundays and Friday and stuff, but not during the week.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  Huh-uh.  It's get bad, it is, nursing home I think is sometimes I think
some people put them in there and then they just die.  That's about what it's
for.  And it's really not.  Some people don't need to be in there.

A.67:  You know, that's what I've heard too.  You know, I heard that they just put
them in there because they don't want to mess with them.

B.68:  That's right, and I don't think that's right.  I think they should have a
place to, some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with
nurses, they need to have a place for them, like a retirement home.

A.69:  Well, yeah, I've heard some things, you know, uh, I don't where I heard it
from.  It might have been a movie or something, where they made a apartment
complex into a, what you're saying --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- for people who can take care of themselves, but --

B.72:  Don't. 

A.73:  -- they, they, uh, need a little help in doing it.

B.74:  Yeah.  You see, that would be okay.  You could have somebody check on each
[noise] {sounds like furniture on the floor} one of them every day, you know,
go by and see what they need.

A.75:  Yeah, each of them have their own little apartment or little,

B.76:  Little place to live, you know, even just a little room or whatever.

A.77:  Well, do they share rooms in nursing homes?

B.78:  Sometimes, yeah, it depends on the patient, and, and I guess sometimes the
availability of that, of the room, and how they done built the hospitals,
because I know one lady, like she had a roommate, but the woman across the
hall didn't have one.

A.79:  Um.

B.80:  Get my purse {speaking to someone off the phone}.  But it, it, it, you
know, it just to me, nursing homes are, um --

A.81:  Bad news,

B.82:  -- bad news unless you can find a really good one, and those are rare.  But
there are some good ones and there are some bad ones, I mean [laughter].

A.83:  I'll, I'll say something I said in the last conversation, I hope I'm never
in that position where I have to be put in one.  Um, from all I've heard about
it, it just (( )) I've heard,

B.84:  I told my husband, well, is this weird, because, see, what people don't
understand is even the people that work in the nursing home, they will get old
one day, and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them.
That's the way I feel, yeah,

A.85:  Well, you know, uh,

B.86:  Or maybe that won't not make it that far in life --

A.87:  Yeah, well,

B.88:  -- for what they did to somebody but,

A.89:  I have my beliefs in the hereafter, and I believe that God, God will take
care of them.

B.90:  That's the whole, that's what I think.  I think God will definitely get,
you know, there's two people that I know you should not mess, uh, abuse, and
that's a child and a person that's elderly.  You shouldn't abuse anybody.

A.91:  True.

B.92:  But, but, they don't worry, them people, them two people are the most
helpless people, you see what I'm saying.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  You know, they can't really defend themselves like somebody, uh, say my
age, yeah, yeah,

A.95:  Or mine.  Yeah, I got you there.

B.96:  Because I can tell somebody to go leave me alone.  But they so old,

A.97:  Or you can force them to do it, if, you know,

B.98:  Yeah, you can force their hand, more or less.  But see, somebody that old,
they don't know.

A.99:  Yeah, uh,

B.100:  And then what they, what are they going to do, and if they tell anybody,
people always say, Oh, they're just senile.  You know.  Huh-uh [laughter].
And that ain't right neither.

A.101:  No, it's not.

B.102:  [Noise] {furniture on floor}.  So.  It, it, it gets bad, you know, it just
depends on, like I said, the nursing home, now my grandmother was in a nursing
home in California before she died, but it was a nice nursing home, for, you
know, it was one of the nice ones.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  But now my mom and them had to pay for that, too.

A.105:  Yeah, I was going to say, you have to pay something like three and four
times more.

B.106:  You have to pay more, you know, social security covers so much, and then,
uh, you have to pay some more, and she chose to pay some more --

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  -- if she, you know, since it was like my, my grandmother had thirteen
kids, so they all, you know paid a month, which was better.  But see, my
husband's a only child [laughter].

A.109:  Yeah, and he'd have to pay it all.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  Yeah.  I know what big families are like, and how they can get together if
you, if they're really cooperative,

B.112:  If, yeah, see,

A.113:  and wanting the best,

B.114:  Yeah, yeah, and, and then there's another thing she told me, is, you have
to make sure everybody cooperates because, like, by her, her being there, if
some one, if one of her brothers didn't send in their check, she would have to
pay it --

A.115:  Yeah. 

B.116:  -- you know, and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it [laughter] --

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  -- you know.

A.119:  Well, I know my mom from a family of at least sixteen, I've lost count, uh,
and my grandmother just died sometime last, well about two years ago --

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  -- and, uh, they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the,
uh, hospital costs and stuff, and, uh, you know, there's some of my family
that's not exactly in the homeless level, but, you know, darn close --

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  -- and, uh, then there's others who is, uh-huh, 

B.124:  Just pretty,

A.125:  lots better off --

B.126:  Oh, yeah --

A.127:  -- and,

B.128:  -- see that's what, that's what gets me, like, well, just like my brother,
he has got his five bedroom house in California with the swimming pool, and
here I am renting a house, barely making it.

A.129:  Yeah, well, in California, too, I've got a friend that lives out there,
and, uh, she's got a little two, three bedroom house with a gara-, a double
car garage, and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  California is high.

B.132:  Yeah, and, then, you know, it's like I tell him, You make more money than I
do, than I could ever really think about.  If I made as much money as my
brother, I would be just like, set for life.

A.133:  That's what we keep saying [laughter].

B.134:  You know [laughter].  But not him, he's never happy, and I think that's,
that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps driving for more,

A.135:  Uh, well, that's

B.136:  Which I probably if I got what I wanted I'd be okay.

A.137:  Well, that's a good initiative, I guess, if but,
