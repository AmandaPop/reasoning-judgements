=========================================================================

A.1:  So what do you think about it?  How are we doing in recycling?  Are we,

B.2:  Well, I think we need to do more.  I mean, I know I need to do more.  They
have programs around where you can reach the, uh, they come and pick up your
newspapers if you have them bundled up.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  But I have a hard time of being able, of separating, you know, having a
place, separating my trash, and get all the --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- cans from the paper, and, you know, I just haven't gotten that dedicated
yet [laughter].  So.

A.7:  I do a lot of work with the boy scouts, and we try to do a lot --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- but there's still a lot more we can do.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  You know, I don't recycle my newspapers myself, but I noticed in one of the
sales catalogs this weekend they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of
thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in
there --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- tie them all up and bundle them up, so I figured I might get me one of
those --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- because we don't always read the newspaper.  Sometimes it just sits
around for a while, and then we just chuck it.

B.16:  Yeah, well, I don't, I don't get the paper every day, but, you know, I get
it on, I try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know,
the Sunday edition.  So.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know,
the front walk ev-, --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that
up, but that's the extent of what I've done.  I'd like to be able to do more.
The problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a
while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know --

A.21:  Yeah see, and,

B.22:  -- it's not always convenient to do it.

A.23:  Yeah, see, and here in Lubbock everything's so close.  I can imagine what
it's like up there.

B.24:  Yeah, I'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is, but, you
know, sometimes it's just so, seems so much easier just to take it and throw
it in the trash, and have --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to
have them.

A.27:  See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter
of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the
wall --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and then I put me a little five gallon bucket, and it's just outside the
garage door --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop
it into the bucket.

B.32:  Do those can crushers work good?

A.33:  Yeah, I got one from Payless Cashways, and it's actually metal --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- it's not plastic.  I didn't want to buy a plastic one.

B.36:  Yeah because those things I think would just snap --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- you know.

A.39:  But Payless Cashways has them and they're metal, and I don't know what
affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there, but it was only like seven
dollars, not too bad.

B.40:  Oh.  I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't
drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know, but, um --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- you know, occasionally we have some around, but, you know, for other
kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't
they.

A.43:  Yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't think it would crush steel cans, it's pretty
tough.

B.44:  Yeah, so.  I don't know, I don't think you have to crush the other ones for
them to get to take that, but,

A.45:  No, you could probably just, you know,

B.46:  I need to look into it more, you know, it's, you know, it, sometimes, even
with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you
know, they won't take --

A.47:  Yeah --

B.48:  -- paper that's shiny,

A.49:  -- they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper or, see, I work at
T I.

B.50:  Yeah, so does my husband, yeah.

A.51:  We do a lot of recycling out there.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard, but that's just
now come on board.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  You know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years, and we're
just now getting on board to recycling --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know.

B.58:  Yeah, I don't know what, you know, I haven't, I'm sure they're probably
doing that here some.

A.59:  Yeah, I'm sure they are.  T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide, I'm
sure.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  I think it's necessary, I, I like it, you know, it makes, I think
it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal, they're now
starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper, and,

A.61:  Oh, yeah.

B.62:  And I've bought, you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of
recycled paper, and I think they're just fine.

A.63:  Yeah, I bought a, I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there
at work, it's his birthday, we're pretty good friends, and what it is is a
recycled paper bag --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it, and a cute little
phrase inside, and it's just a paper bag --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- you know, and it's really cute.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  But, I think we're doing better and better all the time,

B.70:  Yeah --

A.71:  (( )) still don't,

B.72:  -- I think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't
stick everything in landfills any more.  So.

A.73:  No, there's not going to be any room, shortly.

B.74:  No, no, the office,

A.75:  I don't know what New York does about theirs.  I guess they still ship it
out on barges somewhere.

B.76:  Yeah, it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah, so.  But I think we're getting better at it --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- I think there's quite a bit more we could do.

B.80:  {Talking to someone in the room}  Girls, put that away.  Now.

A.81:  But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what
it would be worth.

B.82:  Yeah, I just wish it was a little more conv-, convenient --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- to do, you know, seems like you're so busy anyway, and then that's just
one more thing to have to worry about.  So.

A.85:  Yeah, it sure is.

B.86:  I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more
programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier.  So.

A.87:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they'll get at it sooner.  I guess the schools will get
into it, too, sooner or later.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah, get the kids --

A.89:  You know they have,

B.90:  -- interested in it too.

A.91:  We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have, and
we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure
they'll save them for us, there's no problem there.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  But what do you do with them in the meantime?

B.96:  That's right.

A.97:  Now I don't want a can, a garage full of cans [laughter].

B.98:  That's right, who does.  You know --

A.99:  You know.

B.100:  -- people don't have room for that kind of stuff.  

A.101:  No, they're just not, they're not prepared for it.

B.102:  No, and in Texas, they're just get, things like that, they just get bugs in
them.  So.

A.103:  Yeah, yeah, they do.

B.104:  So, you don't,

A.105:  You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,
that's for sure.

B.106:  That's right, so.

A.107:  So.

B.108:  I'm pretty lazy about it right now.  Everything goes into one thing and
goes out to the [laughter].

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  You know, pick it up. So.

A.111:  Yeah, myself.  About the only thing I really recycle around here is
aluminum cans.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  So.

B.114:  Well, I need to get, get better at it.  So.

A.115:  Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.

B.116:  Yeah, that's right, that's right.

A.117:  If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then --

B.118:  That's true.

A.119:  -- we'll get there.

B.120:  That's right.

@@A.121:  Well --

B.122:  Huh.

A.123:  -- thank you for talking to me.

B.124:  Well, thank you for calling.  I,

A.125:  Sure, no problem,

B.126:  Okay, take care.

A.127:  All right,

B.128:  Bye-bye.

A.129:  Bye-bye.
