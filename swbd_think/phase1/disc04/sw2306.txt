A.1:  So what is your favorite T V program?

@B.2:  Well probably my favorite T V program is MURDER SHE WROTE.  I happen to be
a mystery fan, and, uh, programs such as PERRY MASON and IRONSIDE and MURDER
SHE WROTE and COLUMBO, all of those are my favorite kinds of programs.

A.3:  Yeah, uh, um, I've watched MURDER SHE WROTE a couple of times but,

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Um, I like mysteries, and I do like COLUMBO, but there, what is opposite
MURDER SHE WROTE?  There is something else that I watch.  I think it's that
fa-, home video show --

B.6:  Well.

A.7:  -- that FAMOUS HOME VIDEOS is what's opposite it here.  I don't know it
there.

B.8:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.9:  But, um, I like that because it, it really makes me laugh.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  People send in, have you ever watched that, where they,

B.12:  No, I don't think we get it here.

A.13:  Oh, they send in, they do videos of funny things that happen at home --

B.14:  Oh.

A.15:  -- you know, and then send it in and show it on T V, and, oh boy, I tell
you what, it's, it's hysterical.

B.16:  Oh, what kinds of things do they, uh, show?

A.17:  Oh gosh, well, uh, one that comes to mind is a lady, I don't know what the
heck she was doing in her dishwasher, but she was in her dish-, her head was
in her dishwasher and her hair got caught.

B.18:  Oh, my word.

A.19:  And she couldn't get out, and her hair, it was, and she was heavy --

B.20:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.21:  -- kind of like me [laughter] and so what you could see was this big bottom
sticking out of her, of her dishwasher, and her husband was say-, he was
videotaping this thing, you know.  There she is, caught in the dishwasher, you
know.

B.22:  Oh, my word.

A.23:  Oh, it was hysterical, and just real funny things, you know,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  people skiing and doing funny things on --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- in the water, and you know, just rea-, it's, it's really a good program.
I really enjoy that.

B.28:  Probably things that, that they happen every day, and we don't even notice
them until someone videotapes them.

A.29:  I know it, and then some, the winner, the one that's voted the best wins
ten thousand dollars.  So you know.

B.30:  Is that right?

A.31:  I often think, Gee, I wish I had a video camera, because I could sure use
[laughter] ten thousand dollars.

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  So, but I like things like EVENING SHADE, with Burt Reynolds, I really
enjoy that.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  And, uh,

B.36:  Yeah, I saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening.

A.37:  I really like that --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- that's a good show, and I like ROSEANNE.  Now I know not many people
probably like Roseanne, but,

B.40:  Yeah, I have never seen her show, but after hearing her sing the stuff the
Star Spangled Banner,

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  anthem I will never watch her show.

A.43:  Oh well, she doesn't sing on her show.  But I, I do enjoy seeing that.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  And, uh, so I like a lot of comedy stuff --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- I guess, you know.  But then I like the police things, too.  Cops, you
know, we have,

B.48:  Oh, yeah right,

A.49:  And I like that --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- you know, so, I don't know, I guess I just like a variety of things.
And every day I tape --

B.52:  Do you?

A.53:  -- Regis and Cathy Lee.

B.54:  Oh, yes, that's a good program.

A.55:  Do you like them?

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  I watch them every day.  I tape them.  Well, not this week, because it's,
because they're on vacation and so it's just old tapes.  But,

B.58:  Oh, okay.

A.59:  But, every, I run my V C R while I'm at work, and I tape that, and I watch
it every evening when I come home.

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  And I don't know what it is about that show that's different about other
talk shows.

B.62:  Well, I think that they, uh, they seem like they are friends with one
another and with all of their guests, rather than just interviewing.

A.63:  Yeah, and she's so cute.

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  And her and Frank and the baby.  

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  I don't know, I just, you know they took it off down here --

B.68:  Did they?

A.69:  -- for a while, uh, oh gosh, for about a year, year and a hal-, well, yeah,
I guess about a year.  And so I missed her pregnancy --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and everything, you know, and when they took it off, I have never called
a station before or complained or anything.  When they took it off the air
here, I called the station and complained.

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  I said, You took my favorite [laughter] program off the air, and do you, do
you think it'll ever be back.  And they said, No, we don't think it will be.
Well that was channel eleven, and now it's on channel four.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  So, I'm really thrilled at, you know --

B.76:  Well, great.

A.77:  -- that they, you, that they have it here.  So.

B.78:  Of course, I have to admit I, I love, uh, when the fall comes.  I love, uh,
football.

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  And I watch all the football games.  Monday night, Thursday night, and
Sunday afternoon [laughter].

A.81:  My mother does, too [/laughter].  I'm not a big, I used to be a football
fan.  I don't know what happened.  I'm just not a football fan any more.

B.82:  Well, and not everybody is.

A.83:  Yeah, but my mother does not miss a game, and you just don't know.  She
lives in California, and I do not call her on Sunday in foot-, during football
season.

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  I just don't do it.  You know, she might call me during a halftime, or
after the game or something, but I just don't call her.  And now, they're
starting up with new football.

B.86:  Yeah, but, uh, I can't get too enthused about it yet.  It seems to me I
have to feel that the fall --

A.87:  It's, 

B.88:  -- weather to really do something, uh, with regard to football.

A.89:  You think it's seasonal, you think it goes with the season.

B.90:  Yeah, I, of course I always hate to see it end in January.  I'd like to see
it go on for a couple of months.  But football to me, uh, in real, real hot
weather, it just doesn't, uh, doesn't click.  Now I enjoy going to baseball
games, but I don't enjoy watching them on television, and I don't enjoy
watching basketball on television.  They're, they're both, well baseball's so
slow.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  And, uh, basketball seems like all that you can really see is run and
shoot, run and shoot, run and shoot  [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter]

B.94:  And, uh, because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire
floor to see a play get, uh, de-, develop.  And so, uh, uh, I don't usually
watch them.  I'll listen to baseball, and I'll listen to, uh, like the
Indianapolis Five Hundred.  I would not go and face all those crowds for
anything in the world.

A.95:  But you watch it.

B.96:  But, uh, but, no I won't watch it.  I'll listen to it on the radio --

A.97:  Oh, listen to it.

B.98:  -- yeah, while I'm doing something else.

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  But I won't sit still long enough to watch them go around and around and
around.  To me, that is very boring.

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  But I, I don't watch, I don't sit and watch for long periods of time
anyhow.

@@A.103:  Now see, in Ohio, you really have four seasons don't you?

B.104:  Yes, we certainly do.

A.105:  Well, we kind of do, but ours,

B.106:  [Laughter].

A.107:  [Laughter] our, its hot here.  I'm in shorts.

B.108:  Are you?

A.109:  And, we've had our air conditioners on already.  It has been hot and humid
here.  And so, but our summers sometimes start in June and they don't end til
like November.  I mean, it's hot.  So, we watch football in the heat here.

B.110:  Sure, right.  I guess so.

A.111:  So I, it might not matter.  Texans are real football minded people.

B.112:  Oh, with the Dallas Cowboys, although they haven't,
 
A.113:  [Sigh].

B.114:  done very well the last couple of years.

A.115:  Yeah, I know.

B.116:  But, uh, they'll be back up there.

A.117:  I think so, I think they did better this last year.

B.118:  Yeah, they-, they'll climb back up again, and that Texas Stadium, I've been
there.  That is a phenomenal place.

A.119:  Yeah, people say they wish they had a roof on it though.  

B.120:  [Laughter].

A.121:  It doesn't look finished.

B.122:  Well, and I think that's maybe what I like about it --

A.123:  But, it,

B.124:  -- in that so many of them are totally enclosed.

A.125:  I've never been in an enclosed one.

B.126:  Oh, I, well I have, and they're very noisy, and, uh, then of course, I've
been up to Cleveland, Ohio, where the Cleveland Browns play, and that's just a
wide open stadium, and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable.
Oh.  But, um, now you go down to Cincinnati, and they have a nice stadium down
there.  But it's, it's all open also.

A.127:  Yeah, yeah.  So Ohio has how many football teams, two.

B.128:  Two, yeah.

A.129:  Well so does Texas.

B.130:  Yeah, and then of course Indianapolis, which is only a hundred miles away
from us, has the Colts.  Yeah.

A.131:  That's right, they have the Colts now, like,

B.132:  So, they (( )) got a lot of sports going on around here.

A.133:  Yeah, I went one time to, um, okay, Minneapolis --

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  -- to the, uh, Vikings.  I went to a Viking Bear game one year, oh many
years ago now.  My gosh, it's probably been twenty years, and that was a real
experience --

B.136:  Oh, yes.

A.137:  -- because there are some fans there.

B.138:  Oh, yes.

A.139:  And I guess that's a big game.

B.140:  Well, I, uh, I'm retired from education.  I worked thirty-four years as a
teacher and administrator in the Dayton here, this, the Dayton school system,
and, uh, some of my players, uh, players, some of my former students, uh, play
with Minnesota Vikings.

A.141:  Oh [tone] {long drawn out sound}.

B.142:  And then with the Cleveland Browns.

A.143:  Oh, how neat.

B.144:  Yeah, it was, it was fun because, uh, they would call, when they were with
the Browns, they would call and say, We left tickets at the gate for you all.
Come on up.  So we would hop in the car --

A.145:  Oh.

B.146:  -- the next morning and drive up and we had tickets waiting for us.  Yeah.

A.147:  On that's wonder-, --

B.148:  Yeah.

A.149:  -- oh, that's, what an experience to see your students, you know, grown up
and playing football.

B.150:  Oh, sure.  One of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here.

A.151:  Well, that must be,

B.152:  [Laughter].  

A.153:  neat to see what happens to them like that.

B.154:  Yeah.  Right.  When you see the ones who are successful, and there are many
of them around, and, uh, makes me feel good to know I played one small part in
their rearing.

A.155:  Yeah, you sure did.  What grade did you teach?

B.156:  Well, I, I, uh, when I first started out teaching it was at college level.
And then, uh, after we moved here to Dayton, then I went to the high school
level, and I really enjoyed that more.  And so, then I taught the physical
education actually, with the, I was the specialist in water safety.

A.157:  Oh my gosh.

B.158:  And, so I taught, uh, the [throat_clearing] the physical education and
swimming, um, on the high school level, and then they just kept pushing me
into administration.  And, and I wound up as an assistant principal, and then
I went down to the central office and was part of a team to, to, to develop a
program to evaluate schools and to, uh, try to resolve problems within
schools.

A.159:  So no wonder you like sports, though.  You were a physical --

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  -- education teacher.

B.162:  Sure, I was also a gymnast when I was very small in a Czechoslovakian
Turner Society.

A.163:  Oh, that's wonderful.

B.164:  Yeah, and had the opportunity of, uh, competing nationally, and they had
things that were similar to the Olympics, uh, the Czechoslovakian Turner
Society did.  So, it was, it was exciting.  We competed on the rings and
balance beam,
