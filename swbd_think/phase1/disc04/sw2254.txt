======================================================================

@A.1:  So, what type of restaurant do you like?  

B.2:  Basically, well, I'm a vegetarian.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Um, and my husband is kosher.  So, if, do you know what that means, kosher?

A.5:  Uh-huh, yeah.   

B.6:  Okay.  So, a, a lot of the restaurants we select are, um, based on the
variety of food.  I don't particularly like to sort of American, you know,
meat and potatoes type,

A.7:  Uh-huh, yeah.   

B.8:  of restaurants.  Um, I, I love ethnic foods.  I love, um, Chinese,
Indian, ((Tai)),

A.9:  Yeah, now, do e-, are Indian foods kosher?  

B.10:  Well, as long as you're not eating meat, 

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  um, it's, to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher.  

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  And, um, most Indian places don't have a rabbi, ((the)) places ((to eat)),
[laughter].

A.15:  I was about to say, I didn't think so.  

B.16:  Right.  So, um,

A.17:  But most of the, most of the (( )) the vegetarian Indian meals.

B.18:  Yeah, exactly.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Vegetables and, and the same with, you know, a lot of people wonder do yo-,
you know, do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and,

A.21:  Uh-huh.   

B.22:  and even, if, like, you know, you could go to a Chinese restaurant and,
((eat)) the,

A.23:  Oh, definitely Chinese would.  

B.24:  Right.  Um, Italian, 

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  you know that, 

A.27:  Uh-huh, yeah, because pastas and the, and the different types of sauces and
things.

B.28:  Right.  

A.29:  Sure.  Yeah.  

B.30:  Yeah, and even, um, one of my favorites is El Torito's, I don't know if you
have that.

A.31:  Which is ((of right)) now, we don't have one. 

B.32:  It's Mexican. 

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  It's like a ((Chi-Chi's)).

A.35:  You know, my wife and you would probably love to go eat together.

B.36:  Really?  

A.37:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  

B.38:  Why?  

A.39:  Well, everyt-, when we go someplace, they have to have good french fries.

B.40:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

A.41:  If they don't have good french fries, ((you know)), if it's one of, if it's
a place that has other things,

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  if it's not that, then we go to Chinese food, you know,

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  I order, you know, a beef and broccoli or,

B.46:  Oh, really [laughter].   

A.47:  chick-, or chicken and broccoli or something like that, you know, chicken
and cashews.

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  And she orders, um, bean curd, 

B.50:  Oh, tofu.   

A.51:  and, and vegetables, right [laughter].  

B.52:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.53:  You know, so, um, you two would probably eat real well together.

B.54:  We certainly would.  

A.55:  Yeah, she, 

B.56:  If,

A.57:  she normally picks all of our restaurants though.

B.58:  Oh, does she?   

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  Now, do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more,

A.61:  Well, we really ca-, we really don't do that that often.  Um,

B.62:  ((Uh-huh)).  

A.63:  I, I guess recently we did, um, I get, when we got engaged last summer,

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  um, we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating.

B.66:  Right.  

A.67:  And we went to the Annapolis area which is, um, Annapolis, Maryland it,
it's, uh, state capital but it's also on the water,

B.68:  Oh.  

A.69:  so there's a lot of restaurants there it's, uh, it's a, uh, very,

B.70:  ((Just that it's)),  

A.71:  trendy, resort type town, but the, my wife lived in Annapolis for a short
time and, uh,

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  she really liked this one restaurant, it was, it's French.

B.74:  Oh.  

A.75:  ((But)) it was really good.  Everything ((in it)) was very garlicky.

B.76:  Uh-huh.   

A.77:  And their big specials are things like, um, very fancy omelets or very
fancy crepes.

B.78:  Crepes, yeah.  

A.79:  And then they also have a lot of other, uh, French oriented, uh, meals, and
I normally get something that's crepe and very American and then,

B.80:  Yeah, [laughter].   

A.81:  she gets something French, yeah.  But, um, ((yeah, but)),

B.82:  So, she's the daring one in the family as ((far as she goes)) [laughter].

A.83:  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely, yeah.  But most of the time when we go out,
um, we either go Mexican because,

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  uh, uh, she just has a, a need for either some type of Mexican chips or
Mexican pizza,

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  or something like that, 

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  or french fries.  You have to, you have to have french fries with just
about every meal unless you're eating something other, you know, some other,
uh,

B.90:  [Laughter] Unless you're eating like a baked potato or something
[laughter].

A.91:  Right, yeah.  In fact, um, since (( )) Balti-, Baltimore's on the water and
wha-,

B.92:  Yeah, I was, I was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish. 

A.93:  Um, yes.

B.94:  Um,

A.95:  Yeah, we just had salmon,

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  last night for dinner.  Uh,

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  but also the spices here, um, ((old bay)) is a spice.  I don't know if
you're even aware of it.  It's what they used on the,

B.100:  No.

A.101:  uh, if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs,

B.102:  Sure, yeah.  I have heard of that.  

A.103:  Okay, well, ((old bay)) is the spice they put on the steamed crabs.

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  Well, true male, Maryl-, Marylander's have, 

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  have ((old bay)) on just about everything.

B.108:  Oh, really?  

A.109:  They put it on their french fries, they'll put it in their potato salad,

B.110:  [Laughter].  

A.111:  they'll, um, they'll, they'll put it with just, my wife loves ((old bay))
with everything.  So, if we have french fries they have to hav-, they have to
have ((old bay)) on them.

B.112:  I see.  It's sort of like some people and ketchup.  

A.113:  Right.  Yeah.  

B.114:  Yeah.  

A.115:  Yeah, well, see I, I grew up in Pittsburgh.  Uh, where, 

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  Heinz ketchup is,

B.118:  Oh, really?   

A.119:  and my ((fan was big)) ketchup.  

B.120:  Oh, wow.  

A.121:  Yeah.  

B.122:  Well, you know, I have a problem because I tend to find a restaurant,

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  and being on a, on a tighter budget,

A.125:  Right.  

B.126:  you know, we don't go out to eat that much.  

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  So, once I find a restaurant, I only want to go there.  

A.129:  Uh-huh.  

B.130:  And I'll go there for, you know, two months straight, 

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  we won't go anyplace else.  

A.133:  Yeah, we do the same.  

B.134:  And then, you know, I finally get sick of that one and then I'll find
another restaurant.

A.135:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

B.136:  I love salad bar restaurants.  Because, um, I find that when you order a
salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad.

A.137:  No, you get a couple,

B.138:  You get like lettuce, 

A.139:  ye-, cou-, yeah.   

B.140:  and, you know what I mean, and the croutons.

A.141:  It's not a real meal.  

B.142:  Exactly. 

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  But a salad bar, that's, that's my favorite, I mean, if, because I just
feel like I can make my own meal, and there's usually a lot of fun stuff, and
obviously, it's a lot of vegetables.

A.145:  Yeah.  

B.146:  But, um,  

A.147:  Yeah, we're the same because I'm in graduate school and we're living off
her salary,

B.148:  Uh-huh, yeah, 

A.149:  and my, 

B.150:  I know what that's like.  

A.151:  and my part-time work, you know, it's not,

B.152:  Uh-huh.  

A.153:  Our, the restaurant, our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where
actually we live, you know, where my, where I'll return to my job or whatever.

B.154:  Uh-huh.  

A.155:  We can normally eat out for, um, under fourteen dollars.  

B.156:  Oh, that's good.   

A.157:  And that's, you know, that's the two of us having, 

B.158:  That's very good.

A.159:  un-, unlimited french fries, 

B.160:  [Laughter].  

A.161:  and, uh, it may be a Mexican pizza, sometimes both, 

B.162:  Uh-huh.  

A.163:  together, 

B.164:  Uh-huh.  

A.165:  um, along with and see it, i-, which is really funny too, you know,
normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having french
fries.

B.166:  Oh, really?  

A.167:  Then I-, I'll order like a vegetable soup or something, you know, but
she'll just have the french fries, you know.

B.168:  Now, is she, does she like, um, McDonald's french fries? 

A.169:  No. 

B.170:  Oh, okay.

A.171:  No, in fact, i-, we're very environmental so we very rarely,

B.172:  Oh.  

A.173:  eat at any of the fast-food restaurants.  

B.174:  Uh-huh.  

A.175:  Uh, just because of the, um, the Styrofoam, 

B.176:  Uh-huh.  

A.177:  and the plastic waste,

B.178:  Yeah.  

A.179:  and whatever.  We very rarely will eat at a, uh, a fast-food restaurant.
I will,

B.180:  Well, that's great. 

A.181:  I'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the
road more, but,

B.182:  It, just more, yeah.  

A.183:  um, yeah, but she w-, 

B.184:  I know what you mean.

A.185:  she almost refuses, you know, to do that, in fact, we're at a point now
where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store,

B.186:  Yeah.  

A.187:  we save the same plastic container, 

B.188:  Oh, do you?  (( )).

A.189:  and we, yeah, we take it with us back to the store,

B.190:  Uh-huh.  

A.191:  and bring it home, yeah.  And we take, yeah,

B.192:  Well, you know, it's funny that you say that because, um, our grocery
store, uh, I, personally I think the grocery stores in Rochester are very,
they'll allow you to bring your own like, um, Tupperware thing.

A.193:  Uh-huh.  

B.194:  Like your own container, 

A.195:  Yeah.  

B.196:  to fill it up.  I think that's great, and you weigh your container,

A.197:  Uh-huh.  

B.198:  you know, and then you weigh your salad after that.  

A.199:  Well, that's a really good idea.  

B.200:  It really is.  

A.201:  Yeah.  

B.202:  I was very happy about that because I, you know, I feel the same,

A.203:  Uh-huh.  

B.204:  way you do.  

A.205:  Yeah, we, we've used the same, uh, you know, tin bottom with plastic top,

B.206:  Uh-huh.  

A.207:  probably for the past, oh, I don't know, six months.  

B.208:  Oh, that's great.  

A.209:  Yeah, so, 

B.210:  That really is g-,

A.211:  so we're very, you know, we try to be very environmental and,

B.212:  Uh-huh.  

A.213:  in fact, it's terrible now because, um, I guess we've donated money to a
number of organizations and, you know, we're in school, I'm in school and
we're just barely surviving here, and,

B.214:  Yeah.   

A.215:  and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation, 

B.216:  Oh, jeez.  

A.217:  like demanding a hundred dollars.  

B.218:  Oh, ((man)).  

A.219:  Yeah, and when you say but we're in c-, uh, we're in graduate school we
can't afford that, you know, they, they say, well, how about twenty-seven,

B.220:  Right.   

A.221:  how about ten.  

B.222:  ((How to)) say no.  

A.223:  You know, yeah so, 

B.224:  And your like, you'll do your own part, you know,

A.225:  Uh-huh.  

B.226:  you can do without necessarily (( )).

A.227:  Yeah, we do all we can now, 

B.228:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.229:  but that, it, you know, I think that also goes along, uh, the reason why
we pick the restaurants that we go to.

B.230:  Yep.  

A.231:  You know, 

B.232:  Yep.  

A.233:  we, we really hav-, we really look at restaurants now, there's one other
little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is, um, sandwiches and chips
and a pickle, you know.

B.234:  Uh-huh.  

A.235:  But you still, and that's five fifty, but if you go to a fast-food
restaurant you're going to spend four fifty,

B.236:  Yep.  

A.237:  and you're going to produce a lot of Styrofoam, 

B.238:  A lot more waste, yeah.  

A.239:  and a lot of plastic, 

B.240:  Uh-huh, true.

A.241:  so, we, you know, we'll go there instead of, you know, just going to a
fast-food place.

B.242:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, I don't usually resort to fast food.  

A.243:  Uh-huh.  

B.244:  Um, if I do, I feel like it's a salad or something at McDonald's,

A.245:  Yeah.  

B.246:  but I do rely on pizza a lot.  

A.247:  I do too.  

B.248:  Um, I mean, to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or
something,

A.249:  Uh-huh.  

B.250:  is like gourmet [laughter], I mean, I just,

A.251:  Yeah, I [laughter], I agree.   

B.252:  you know, what I mean, 

A.253:  Yeah, yeah.

B.254:  it's just (( )) and it's convenient, um, uh, the, uh, I don't know if
you've ever heard of Pizza Inn (( )).

A.255:  No, no.  

B.256:  Okay.  Well, they just, they'll do everything with pizzas.  As a matter of
fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called
((spinoccoli)),

A.257:  Oh.  

B.258:  and what it is, is, um, normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli.

A.259:  Oh.  

B.260:  And it's really, really good.  

A.261:  ((Jeez)), I'll tell La-, 

B.262:  And I feel like,

A.263:  I'll tell Laura about that.  

B.264:  Yeah, tell her about that. 

A.265:  Uh-huh.

B.266:  Um, and I feel like I'm getting a little bit more health,

A.267:  Uh-huh.  

B.268:  out of that pizza then maybe just, well, I wouldn't eat pepperoni but,
you know, sausage or,

A.269:  Uh-huh.  

B.270:  something like that.  But, um,

A.271:  Yeah, that's because m-,

B.272:  so I, 

A.273:  that's really, see, because a lot of times we'll order a pizza we'll just
get a regular cheese pizza,

B.274:  Uh-huh.  

A.275:  or, um, uh, for-, we just recently got married so my wife got a, uh, a
heavy-duty mixer like a,

B.276:  Uh-huh.  

A.277:  KitchenAid or something like that it's called.  

B.278:  Uh-huh.  

A.279:  So, she's make, she makes dough, pizza dough and freezes it,

B.280:  Oh, yeah.  

A.281:  and then takes it out before I get home ((for the weekend)) because
pizza's probably one of my favor-, most favorite food.

B.282:  Really?  

A.283:  Yeah, and she'll make that for the weekend and she'll make, you know, we'll
have two pizzas.  Mine will be regular tomatoes and, um, mozzarella and
((Monterrey)) Jack cheese, you know, sprinkled, on it.

B.284:  Uh-huh.  

A.285:  And ((hoselebee)), you know, something, uh, more gourmet but more, you
know, with,

B.286:  (( )) or something like that. 

A.287:  yeah, more with what you like and I-, 

B.288:  Right.  

A.289:  she loves broccoli and spinach and I think, uh, 

B.290:  Uh-huh.  

A.291:  she, I don't think she's ever probably thought of that.  

B.292:  Well, ((spinoccoli)), 

A.293:  Uh-huh.  

B.294:  she can't patent the idea though because Pizza Inn, you know, already has
it but,

A.295:  Yeah, so it's, 

B.296:  it's a, it's very good.

A.297:  it's just regular, it's just tomatoes, 

B.298:  Well, they put it, they,

A.299:  Uh-huh.

B.300:  I guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then ...
