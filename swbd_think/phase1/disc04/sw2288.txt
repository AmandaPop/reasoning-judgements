A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Well, budgeting is a sore subject in this family [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah, me too.  I know exactly what [laughter].

B.4:  We've actually, uh, uh, tried, uh, budgeting is very important to us.  We,
we try it every month, and, um, I think it's good, I mean, it gives us a sense
of, uh, uh, of, of staying in some semblance of control, but, uh, we, we do
have, uh, we never seem to be able to stick with it.

A.5:  No, it's really hard to do that.  I mean, it's [laughter] I don't know, I
guess, um, we do kind of have a budget, um, but it's kind of funny, what we,
what we do, I guess, is, we try to proportion, uh, who pays what according to
the salary that we make.  Do you kn-, understand what I'm saying?

B.6:  No.

A.7:  We, we pay a percentage, um, which is kind of strange, [laughter] --

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  -- a lot of people don't do that [laughter] but we find that it works, you
know.

B.10:  Now, I'm sorry, what is, what is this again?  [Laughter].

A.11:  Well, okay.  Um, like I pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the
bills --

B.12:  Oh, okay, oh, I see.

A.13:  -- and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck.

B.14:  Oh, sure.

A.15:  Do you understand?  [Laughter].

B.16:  Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense [laughter].

A.17:  Okay, I guess I didn't really explain that too well [laughter].

B.18:  Yeah, well, yeah, uh, we, ours is actually very detailed.  Um, we, we've
got categories for everything, and, uh, we, we figure out how much income the
both of us are going to have in a month.  And we take every penny of that and
we allocate it under all these different categories.  Unfortunately, there's a
big category called miscellaneous.

A.19:  Oh, [laughter] --

B.20:  And, uh,

A.21:  -- that one gets used up quick, is that it?

B.22:  That's the one that kills us every time.  Miscellaneous is never what we
figure it's going to be.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  It's never what it was last month, and, uh, and, uh, you know, it's the one
that's always the killer, um --

A.25:  That's [laughter]

B.26:  -- but, I, uh, you know, it's, uh, in fact when, uh, we pay our check, when
we, when we, you know, write our checks, we even categorize our payments, and,
I mean, we even get into that kind of detail, um.

A.27:  Oh, wow, that's really, that is pretty detailed.

B.28:  So we, I mean, we do, uh, when, you know, whenever we go through the
process of paying the bills, we know exactly what category we're paying it
for, and, uh, we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going.  We
don't have any control over it --

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  -- but we have a real good sense of where it's going.

A.31:  Well, but you know, that's good, too, because I've been in the situation in
the past where I didn't know where my money was going, and that, that's 
hard --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- to, you know, you can't keep up with it, and it really gets you in
trouble [laughter] --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- you know, and,

B.36:  We're, we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things
right now, and, uh, like my wife's going back to school, and I'm going to
school, and we're, our kid-, we've got the kids who are at the stage where
they need to take piano lessons, and, uh, you know, play baseball and --

A.37:  Oh, yeah,

B.38:  -- and do all those fun things, and, uh, I think, I think we'd be totally
bankrupt [laughter] --

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  -- if we didn't do something, um, and, and what we've proven to ourselv-,
what we prove to ourselves every month, is that we're spending more than we
make [laughter] --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- so it's, it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white,
 
A.43:  That's easy to do --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- it's very easy to do, and, it's, I don't, it, do you find it easier to,
I mean, do, with a budget, do you feel like you're, you do, I mean, I know you
said you have better control but --

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  -- do you feel like you're really saving anything, I mean,

B.48:  Um, well, no, I, I, I think, um, I don't think we're saving anything.  I, I
think what we're doing [noise] {loud mid pitch hum} is we're, we're, we're
making it possible to, to, well, and the fact of it is, is it's making it
possible to live beyond our [/noise] means --

A.49:  Oh [laughter], well that's

B.50:  -- because, you know, if we didn't track it, we'd, we'd totally blow it, I
think is what it would end up, um, um, so, you know, we, we do know that we
can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to, uh, hold
back on something.  Uh, we can, we can see a cash flow that says, this, you
know, we can't do this right now because the money's just not there.  We, we,
we're going to have to put it off for a week --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- or a month, or whatever the case.  So, so, yeah, it, you know, it's, um,
we, you know, we're not going to get, this budget isn't going to make us rich,
but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty.

A.53:  Yeah,

B.54:  Uh,

A.55:  which is easy to do.

B.56:  but, yeah, uh-huh, but we look at it sort of as an investment in the
future, too.  You know, I'm going back to school, my wife's going back to
school too, our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so fina-,
the, these financial problems won't be problems in the future --

A.57:  Yeah,

B.58:  -- and, uh, so, we've, that's, that's the, we're look-, we look it as, as,
yeah, we're living like this now, but it's a short term investment for, for a
better lifestyle later on.

A.59:  Right, well, that's good [laughter].

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  I know what you mean about the school, because that's what I'm trying to
do, also.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  And we're trying to build it enough so that I can go to school full-time,
because right now I'm going to school part time.

B.64:  We're going, we're going through the exact same thing. 

A.65:  Yeah [laughter] --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- So, you know, trying to budget is again, you know, at this point, we're
trying to budget enough so we can save more, um, you know, so I can go to
school full-time --

B.68:  Sure.

A.69:  -- you know.  It's, it's not easy to do [laughter].

B.70:  No, I, I don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point, but, uh,
um, but it's something to work for [laughter].

A.71:  Oh, oh, it definitely is, and I tell you what, if you work hard enough,
it'll happen, because [laughter] --

B.72:  Yeah, yeah.

A.73:  -- because I can, we can see it.  You know, I think it's going to be a
couple of years before --

B.74:  Sure --

A.75:  -- I can do that --

B.76:  -- that's, I think we're probably --

A.77:  -- but --

B.78:  -- in the same position.

A.79:  -- but, you know, but at least I can see a little bit of light just from,
you know, doing this, you know, budgeting --

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  -- and stuff, it really helps.

B.82:  Right, right, yeah.

A.83:  But, 

B.84:  Yeah, um, and, and, and it also makes it possible, you, I think before we
did any kind of budgeting, we, we were in a constant state of saying we can't
afford anything.

A.85:  Right.

B.86:  You know, we can't do anything, we can't afford anything, and now we can at
least say, Well, we can fit this in.  It doesn't really work very well, but we
can fit this expense in, and so, by being a little organized, we can, we can
allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before.

A.87:  Yeah, it really makes a world of difference, doesn't it.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  It really does.  I know, I've been in, like I said, the same situation, you
know, where I've, I've been in a situation where I didn't budget anything,
just spent money and spent money and spent money [laughter] --

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  -- and it doesn't work [laughter].

B.92:  That's right, that's right.

A.93:  It does-, it really doesn't, uh, makes a big difference.

B.94:  Yeah, I, we, I think that, uh, part of the, the reason we, we, we got so
almost fanatical about budgeting, is that, that there were those years where
we lived that way --

A.95:  Yes.

B.96:  -- and we're still paying for it [laughter].

A.97:  Oh, definitely [laughter].

B.98:  And so, the only way to get out from under that is to, is to do some kind
of budgeting.

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  Uh, yeah, you don't want to, especially when it comes time when the kids
are grown up and they, they want to do things like go to college --

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  -- uh, you don't want to say, we'll still paying for the mistake we made --

A.103:  Right, yeah.

B.104:  -- twenty years ago, you know, and,

A.105:  Well, that's a big, that's really important, because I do have a college
fund set aside for my kids --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- you know, and my oldest one is, um, alm-, going on nine --

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  -- so yeah, it's not that many years --

B.110:  That's right, that's right.

A.111:  -- you know, [laughter] before she's going to be going.

B.112:  I know.

A.113:  So, I hope that, you know, I can continue the college fund, because, it's
important that they go to college when they get out of high school [laughter].

B.114:  Right, [laughter] well, you know, I, we're, we're, we're trying to put
money away for that, too, and, uh, um, you know, you just can't count on them
being totally brilliant, though, though they are --

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  -- but you can't count on them totally brilliant --

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  -- uh, so that they can get scholarships and, and things like that.

A.119:  Right.

B.120:  Uh, it's, you know --

A.121:  No, that's true, I mean,

B.122:  -- it doesn't always work that way --

A.123:  You hope, you hope that they can, 

B.124:  -- right, right --

A.125:  but, [laughter] you know you can't plan,

B.126:  -- or at least loans --

A.127:  Right [laughter] yeah, 

B.128:  -- that they pay on [laughter].

A.129:  Right, right, [laughter] That's the way you have to do it, right.  No
[laughter].

B.130:  Yeah, yeah, well.

A.131:  No that's, that's an important thing to me, and that's why it was very
important for me, because I didn't go to college out of high school, it was
important for me to --

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  -- budget in --

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  -- a, um, college fund for them --

B.136:  Sure.

A.137:  -- because it was just so important, I said, I don't want them to go
through what I went through --

B.138:  Right.

A.139:  -- they have to have a college fund [laughter].

B.140:  Well, you know, the, the, I'm I'm also hoping that this budget process will
rub off on them --

A.141:  Right.

B.142:  -- because, uh, when I grew up I had no --

A.143:  Exactly.

B.144:  -- no involvement in finances whatsoever --

A.145:  Yeah.

B.146:  -- you know, and so, when I became an adult, and I was responsible for, for
the money, I had no skills --

A.147:  Right.

B.148:  -- and no background, and no tools, and, and, uh, so we had to learn it the
hard way.

A.149:  Yes, I know, exactly. I was the same way,

B.150:  So we, we're trying to get the kids involved with, that, that, you know,
when they get an allowance, uh, part of that's supposed to go to savings, for
instance.

A.151:  Very good, yeah.

B.152:  And, uh, um --

A.153:  Uh-huh, you're

B.154:  -- they understand the, our, the, our process.

A.155:  That's, that's, that's strange, because ours, all of their money goes into
savings.  If they need something, we buy it for them --

B.156:  Oh, yeah.

A.157:  -- and all their money has to go in their savings account.  

B.158:  Oh.

A.159:  You know, which maybe I'm being a little bit too harsh, [laughter] --

B.160:  Yeah.

A.161:  -- but, if they need something, I buy it for them --

B.162:  Yeah.

A.163:  -- you know, I mean, if it's an absolute need --

B.164:  Sure.

A.165:  -- you know, I mean, if they want something occasionally --

B.166:  Right.

A.167:  -- but most of the time, if it's a need I get it
