@A.1:  Um, I think, uh, I like to listen to a program called FOCUS ON THE FAMILY,

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  with Doctor James ((Dodson)).  

B.4:  Okay.  

A.5:  And from what I understand it's, it's a new ((thing)) good about families
these days, uh, especially spending time with one another.  I know if, if I
were to have children, I would have trouble,

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  because I work, and, uh, I have my dogs and I have a hard enough time,

B.8:  [Laughter].  

A.9:  spending time with them, you know. 

B.10:  Yeah, I, I'm, I'm pretty busy myself, I'm in graduate school,

A.11:  Uh-huh. 

B.12:  at (( )) and I, I can't see even having time for a pet let alone
children,

A.13:  Yeah, right.  

B.14:  but, um,

A.15:  There's a lot of single parents, too, #that are trying,#

B.16:  #Yeah, I think day care# seems to be, uh, 

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  a real big issue.  

A.19:  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm not sure or I just wonder when we'll know what the
effects,

B.20:  Yeah, 

A.21:  of day care,

B.22:  well, actually there's been some studies that say it has some positive
effects that the stu-, the, the kids get, you know, exposure to other kids
their age at an earlier time.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  So, they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group, although, they
don't have real good, uh, role models.

A.25:  Yeah, I've heard that they, they call them, uh, that they say that they're
more, um, creative that they're really just (( )),

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  from the day care.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Because, uh, the people don't have the time to give that one-on-one
attention.

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  And, and I just wonder if maybe day, uh, the home schooling is going to
come into more and more, uh, homes.

B.32:  I can, I can see that happening.  

A.33:  Yeah, because you really, if you have a good curriculum,

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  do you really need to have that certification, 

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  of a teacher?  I t-, I taught school for a year and it was like, whoops,
you know, it's not for me.

B.38:  No.  

A.39:  Because I, I just don't have that discipline with children, 

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  that, uh, you need for them to learn.  

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And, uh, I, one day I was, I like found myself, uh, telling them to write
their spelling words a hundred times each, and I just heard this comedian say
that, you know, something that, that's how you know you're a bad teacher.
[laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter] Huh.

A.45:  [Throat_clearing] And I was doing it just keep them occupied.

B.46:  Yeah, I think another problem with the families, uh, is, is the role of
television.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Um, I don't know it seems they're using it as a baby-sitter instead of a
learning tool.  That really,

A.49:  Yeah.   

B.50:  that really annoys me because I think, I don't know I think, my parents
probably did that to me a little bit.  [laughter], um,

A.51:  Tha-, using it as a baby-, a baby-sitter?

B.52:  Yeah, 

A.53:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

B.54:  it's just, go watch T V, you know, [laughter].  Leave us alone.

A.55:  Yeah, or ((run)) you out.  

B.56:  Which,

A.57:  Well, I've, I've heard some, uh, there's a book out now called, THE
SATURDAY MORNING MIND CONTROL.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  And, uh, he raises some serious questions about, why do they have these
really, a lot of money goes into the advertising for children's programs.

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  

A.61:  And yet, uh, children can't buy, uh, what's the deal?  

B.62:  Yeah, but they can, they can whine and squeal and complain.

A.63:  Right [laughter].

B.64:  {Tries to sound like a kid}.  ((I'm watching)) NINJA TURTLES.

A.65:  I know it.   

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  And, boy, the price of toys these days is ridiculous.  

B.68:  Yeah, ((I could be)), 

A.69:  And they all have to have the same one, you know.  And,

B.70: [Laughter] I can see how them kids and not letting them watch T V and
making them toys out of wood [laughter],

A.71:  [Laughter] yeah.

B.72:  here kid, this is, this is all you're getting [laughter].  

A.73:  [Laughter]  I wonder how long that would last.  

B.74:  Well, I, I used to baby-sit for this family that didn't have a T V, and
their, their kids turned out fine.

A.75:  They didn't have a T V at all?  

B.76:  They, they had no T V.  

A.77:  Were they Pentecostal?  [laughter].  

B.78:  No.  I mean, they had a nice stereo.  They listened to stereo.

A.79:  Yeah, they just,

B.80:  They were into Michael Jackson [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter] yeah.

B.82:  They just didn't watch ((him)) on T V.  

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Which I thought was pretty neat.  

A.85:  Yeah, it is.  It's very good.  I think T V has really had some bad effects
on all of us.

B.86:  Especially, 

A.87:  I've,

B.88:  the violence on it.  

A.89:  Yeah, yeah.  And you can't control it, you, you know, it's, the cable
channels sometimes you can, but,

B.90:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

A.91:  boy, the cable T V, they'll just show anything.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  And that's coming right into your homes.

B.94:  Yeah.  I think T V can be good if, if the family watches it together on,

A.95:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

B.96:  they're watching good shows.  

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  P B S or whatever.  I mean, even some regular network T V is okay.  If the
parents there and, you know, helps the students or help the, the kids
understand that, yeah, this, that happened in the T V show but probably
doesn't happen in real life.  So,

A.99:  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a lot greater instance of, uh, children committing
murders too, isn't there?

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  Killing their parents and so forth, they don't, they see these things
happening with no consequences,

B.102:  {Very faint}, huh.  

A.103:  you know.  

B.104:  Yeah, you see it on T V.  The guy gets up and lives afterwards.

A.105:  Yeah, yeah, like double O seven, 

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  he's supposed to do it.  And it's okay.  

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  So I,

B.110:  You going to have kids in the future?  

A.111:  Huh?  

B.112:  You going to have kids in the future?  

A.113:  No, huh-uh, because I'm like forty-three.  

B.114:  Okay.  

A.115:  And so it's, uh, it's too late, 

B.116:  Yeah.  

A.117:  you know.  I wond-, sometimes wonder if I'll ever, if I will regret it
when I'm old,

B.118:  Uh-huh.  

A.119:  but, uh, I just can't see myself as a parent,

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  you know it's,  

B.122:  I'm still pretty young, I'm twenty-five, but I don't know, I don't see it
for, for at least a few years [laughter].

A.123:  Really?  Are you married?  

B.124:  No, I'm single right now, and I'm, you know, sorting things out which way
I'm going to go with my life before I,

A.125:  {Very faint} Yeah.  

B.126:  have kids, you know.  Career, to, to much into my career, you know
[laughter].

@@A.127:  Yeah.  Well, I wish you the best.
