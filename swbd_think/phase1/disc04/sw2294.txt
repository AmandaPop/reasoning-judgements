=============================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, Jim, can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital
punishment.

B.2:  Uh, the bottom line, after four years of working with the state prison
system, I've come to the conclusion, if you're going to give the man the death
sentence, go ahead and fulfill the sentence.  Understandably the Supreme Court
says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody, they get a, one
appeal.  Once that appeal fails, within thirty days, execute sentence.  If
you're going to give the man the death sentence, don't keep the guy on death
row for eight, nine, ten years, and make him worry about it.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Plus costing the taxpayers twenty-five thousand dollars a year just to keep
the guy locked up.

A.5:  Well, you've, you've got a point there, but, um, do you think one appeal
is, is too stringent?

B.6:  No.  I do not think, one appeal, everybody's entitled to one appeal.

A.7:  Okay.  Now, um, what do you think about, about the death penalty itself.
Do you think that we should have a death penalty?

B.8:  Absolutely, and I wish they would exercise it more thoroughly.  Let the
punishment fit the crime.  In this state we've got a very weird situation
going on.  We're under federal supervision.  And, I agree, to a point I agree
with how the system works in some respects.  Other ways I don't.  For first
time offenders, everybody's entitled to screw up once.  We'll give them the
early release credits.  We'll give them the good time credits.  We'll give
them the early parole.  Second trip down, whether it's for the same crime or
totally separate one, you serve your sentence day for day.  Third trip down,
this is where my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states.  Third
trip down, if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one.  This
individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of
society.  So you kill him, period, end of story.

A.9:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, I kind of think we're too mean, number one.  Now I
work in Massachusetts but I live in Rhode Island.  So the legislature just
come out and said that because of what with treating the prisoners so-called
brutally because, uh, the state prison's overcrowded, we have to release them.
So they took the offenders with the, the minor crimes, and they let them go.
They didn't have to serve the rest of their term, and, which is absolutely
incredible.  Um, I think, number one, my opinion is that the judges are too
lenient.  But yet, you get some of the jury trials, and it comes down to the
nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person, they always kind of
forgive him a little bit.  Nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say,
well, that's it, you know, we're going to kill you.  So it's got to be up to
the judges, I think, we need, we have to put into place judges that are
stricter than the ones that are in there now.  And the other thing is, I'm not
sure about Texas, but like in Rhode Island, if someone breaks into your home,
you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with
that person.  You can't shoot him, you can't do anything with him.  I'm not
sure what Texas',

B.10:  Uh, Texas has got it rigged to where I can't shoot, the guy can enter my
property, and I can't shoot him, but once he's physically inside my house, uh,
the law reads to where you can defend yourself --

A.11:  Yeah, tha-,

B.12:  -- if you feel your life is being threatened.

A.13:  Yeah and ours,

B.14:  Yeah, at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room, I feel
real threatened, so I'm going to come out with guns blazing.

A.15:  Yeah, and see in our case, it's, you have to, you have to exit, you have to
leave, and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual,
that's what you should do.  So, what choice have you got, you know, as far as,
as far as, our laws go, up here.

B.16:  Well, the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures
they've swung so far away from --

A.17:  Yeah, you're fa-, --

B.18:  -- there, there is no such thing as justice in this country any more,

A.19:  -- you're fading away Jim.

B.20:  (( )) situation ethics.

A.21:  Huh.

B.22:  I said, yeah, the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner, but
he was under the influence of narcotics.

A.23:  That doesn't make any,

B.24:  That should make zero difference.  You shot the guy, you get the death
penalty, period.

A.25:  Right, right.  And so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time
when, when the act was, was performed, but he knows he's going to go back and
do the same thing over again.  You know, when he's straight, so, so-called.
So people like that, any one, I believe, you, if you murder someone, I believe
in an eye for an eye.  And I think probably, uh, uh, maybe the majority of the
people do.  At least the people that, uh, that I talk to.  You go out there
and you kill somebody, you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot
somebody, you deserve to be killed also.

B.26:  That should be automatic death penalty,

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  No, ifs, ands or buts.

A.29:  Right.  Um, you're subject to one appeal.  I, I kind of don't agree with
you on that.  I think probably you should have at least two appeals.

B.30:  But that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now.  They've appealed
everything to where, if they've got one typographical error where in their, in
one line instead of spelling, they've got one word misspelled.  I mean, it's a
very minor clerical error.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  They couldn't tell, they, they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just
throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal.

A.33:  That's, yeah, right, common sense has to, has to set in some place.  It's
just like, uh, [throat_clearing] uh, organized crime.  Now they know all these
people, they know that, the, the, the leaders of organized crime and all that.
Why can't they do something about it?  Because they can't, if they, if they
take something they can't, they can't bring it into the court as, as evidence?
And they know, they just had this, uh, I don't know if it's been in your
newspapers, but, um, the guy that got out of prison here, to go to a mafia,
um, swearing in ceremony, and they got, uh, uh, somebody, and I'm not sure
who, who it was, what organi-, what law enforcement agency, they got a movable
bug, a, a, a court order for a movable bug, which means that you can take it
any place --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and put it any where, and now they're contesting that movable bug
because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular
home where this meeting took place.  So there's a technicality there.  But
they know outright that these people are murderers and whatever else you got
there, and yet they're not going to let that evidence in, you know, as
admissible evidence in court.  So that has to be looked at, too.  Um, I don't
know who they're protecting.  They're not protecting the innocent --

B.36:  No.

A.37:  -- that's for sure.

B.38:  The people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and
technicalities, take a look at your congressmen and senators.  You'll find
that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers.

A.39:  That's true.  That's true.  Um, self-preservation of the species, I guess,
right?

B.40:  That's it.  What they don't realize is that the time is coming, and I see
it coming over the horizon, that the majority of American people are getting
fed up with their B S and are deman-, are going to demand real justice instead
of this --

A.41:  Well.

B.42:  -- in Texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year
sentence, he's going to serve fifteen months, and he's out.

A.43:  You're kidding.

B.44:  One month for one year actually assigned.

A.45:  Because of, because of what, because of overcrowding or,

B.46:  Overcrowding, overcrowding.

A.47:  Huh.  Now the pendulum's going to swing.  More and more people,

B.48:  We've gone too far to the left, it's fixing to come back hard right.

A.49:  Yeah, because, you look at the statistics now, and I'm sure it's in your,
your newspapers just like it is in ours, that every major city now, the
increase of crime is escalating.  I mean, there are more, look at the, look at
the people out there being shot now.  I mean, every day there's, there's
dozens of dozens people across the nation.  They just get blown away for no
reason.  Stray bullets, or California they were going out there and they were
shooting, and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them.  So I
kind of, I kind of agree with you.  I'm kind of.  You still in the, uh, prison
system?

@@B.50:  Yeah, I've been with them for about four years now.

A.51:  How do you like it?  Well,

B.52:  All things considered, I'd rather be a cop on the street, because once I
walk inside the gate, the inmates have more rights than I do.  Say an inmate
swings at me, or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me.  I've got to
let him hit me before I can hit him back, to be justified, and have it called,
what they call a justified use of force.

A.53:  That's incredible.

B.54:  Thank, uh, federal judge named William Wayne Justice.

A.55:  Do you, uh, you carry a fire arm in, when you're in there?

B.56:  No, in, inside the gate I do not carry any weapon at all.

A.57:  Nothing.

B.58:  Nothing.

A.59:  Not even a, a billy club or.  Huh.  What's the purpose of that, so they
can't take it?

B.60:  So they can't take it away from you.

A.61:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  So you going to make a career out of it?

B.62:  I seriously doubt it [laughter].

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  It all boiled down to when the opening for this came up, it was the best
deal going, it was paying so much more money than what I was making before, I
couldn't turn it down.

A.65:  Oh, okay.  Is it, uh, is it, uh, civil service?

B.66:  Uh, actually,
