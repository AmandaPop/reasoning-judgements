@@A.1:  Okay, it says what kind of car would you buy next.  What kind of car
would you buy next [laughter]?

B.2:  Well, we've been thinking about buying a van because it would be nice to
pack the kids and the dog in and, 

A.3:  Yeah, a lot of people, you going to buy one of those mini vans or you going
to buy a full size.

B.4:  Well, I don't know, uh, a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van
last year.  We took a trip across, cross country and it was really nice.  Uh,
but they are hard to drive because they're so much bigger.

A.5:  Was the gas mileage decent or,

B.6:  We got about eighteen miles a gallon.

A.7:  Oh, that's not bad.

B.8:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, it wasn't that bad.  And, uh, but they are big and they're
kind of hard to drive.

A.9:  Well,

B.10:  Uh, definitely next car we'll get will be a used car because we can't
afford a new car they're so expensive.

A.11:  Oh, I've never, I've really never had a new car.  I mean, I'm pretty young,
so, but a lot of people, they go out and buy new cars --

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- you know, I've, I've been -ployed for ten years so I, I have enough
money to go out and buy a new one, but instead I go out and buy toys and
things.

B.14:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.15:  [Laughter] Oh, uh, but, see my situation's really different because I
always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into
business and he only worked on one kind of car.

B.16:  Is that right?  

A.17:  Yeah, and what happened is, he, his, he had a business and they, and they
bought a lot of cars, a lot of the same kind of cars, what ended up he
eventually had his own private junkyard, which is terrible to look at,

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  very illegal, but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because
pretty much everyone in the family, and there's seven of us kids, would have
one.  I mean, me and my husband have the same kind of car.  My brother and his
wife drive the same kind of car. My sister has the same kind of car.  And my
father has the same kind so it's, you know, when we get together and go places
--

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- and we meet places, it's like, gee, you guys don't like one kind of car,
do you.

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  It's a very strange car.  I don't know, y-, if you have them down there,
but it's a Saab.

B.24:  Oh, yes, I've seen them.  
 
A.25:  Yeah, they're not that popular down south.  I don't, I, maybe it's
something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in
snow.

B.26:  That might be, I don't know.  

A.27:  But they're very popular up here in Vermont.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  And a lot of people used to bring his car, their cars to him to get them
fixed because he was, he was really good at it and, uh --

B.30:  That's the way to go.  

A.31:  -- he, he didn't charge as much as the dealer, so, and he also was really
nice to people and he'd help them out a lot.  If they were broke down he'd try
to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  So that saved them a lot of money.

B.34:  Yeah.  One thing I like to do is go to a police auction and get a car
because I've heard you can get pretty good deals, but you have to be kind of
patient because you can't always just go in and get something right away.  L-,
l-, like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning
from, like, nine to twelve.

A.35:  Yeah, I've heard that, that's a really good way to get cars.  Up here they
only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction,
but, but they don't, uh, they don't [lipsmack] repossess that many cars up
here, k-, figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of, uh, where
they repo-, they, uh, take their cars for illegal activities --

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  -- you know.  

B.38:  because --

A.39:  It,

B.40:  -- Dallas is a pretty big area.  We got, I don't know, million people or
million and a half people, or something.

A.41:  Can imagine you have a good, you have, you could have a good, uh, choice of
cars, but then, of course, there is more people interested in them, too.

B.42:  That's true [laughter].  

A.43:  I don't know.  But I know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars
that have been wrecked or, uh, salvaged.  They p-, they might have been stolen
and --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- and the insurance company buys them and they sell them and I've known
people who have got really nice late model cars for cheap --

B.46:  Is that right?  

A.47:  -- but, but they have a dubious background.  They have salvage stamped on
their title.  There's --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- there, one of my friends got one that the, the whole underneath of the
car, the frame was twisted.

B.50:  Um.  

A.51:  And they didn't really know.  It was a real nice late model car, real
pretty on the outside, but they couldn't keep tires on it.  It kept eating the
tires.

B.52:  Yeah, but if you get a good deal.  You know, if you can save five thousand
dollars --

A.53:  Yep.  

B.54:  -- five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires.

A.55:  I know a lot of people who have boughten other cars the same way and, and
have done very well.

B.56:  Yeah.  One thing about,

A.57:  I mean I, the, my car that I drive came out of, uh, a salvage yard, but,
see, it wasn't, uh, [lipsmack] wasn't in an accident.  It had burned.  The
whole inside of it burned.  The --

B.58:  Oh, boy.  

A.59:  -- wire and cable burned. 

B.60:  Huh.

A.61:  And, of course, my brother being the clever person he was had an identical
car, but it had been in an accident --

B.62:  Huh.  

A.63:  -- so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission
and everything else and we put it into the, the, the shell that was burned.
We had the shell all sandblasted and painted.  And he pretty much built me a
car so,

B.64:  That's a pretty good deal.  

A.65:  Yeah, I was, I was pretty happy.  I got what I pretty much wanted.  I could
have it any color I wanted.

B.66:  I think the next car we get, too, might also be one of those, uh, import
kinds because I don't trust American made cars now.  I don't think they have
the quality.  And that's, that's too bad because, I mean I could keep the
money in the country, but on the other hand, it's my money I'm spending.  I
want to get something that's worth my money.

A.67:  That's true.  But, you know, I always thought American cars weren't any
good, but I, uh, rented a car.  I rented a Ford Taurus --

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  -- and I was impressed.  I really liked it.  

B.70:  Is that right?  

A.71:  Yeah.  And, uh, I was talking to my older sister the other day and, uh, she
said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big
enough, she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot --

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon.  She says they're
not very pretty, but like she was really impressed but I like them a lot
because they resembled the Saab when I got inside, the door was big, you know,
it wasn't, it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit.

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  You know, I -- 

B.76:  That's right.  

A.77:  -- I mean, it had a full size door handle on it and it
was, the interior was very plush and padded, and it --

B.78:  Oh, that's nice.  

A.79:  -- it was just, I liked the car a lot and when you shut the door, it made a
real solid [laughter] sound.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  And the performance, it, you know, it, it, you could make it do anything on
the interstate you wanted.

B.82:  That's nice.  

A.83:  So I was really impressed.  Because if I, if I didn't have, if I didn't
buy, uh, used Saabs, you know, if I didn't have a father and a brother that
help me out, I would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus, as
opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  But that's one thing about cars.  My husband wants a Toyota pick up truck.

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  And I can't talk him into a Dodge pick up truck -- 

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  -- or a chevy pick up truck.  He wants a Toyota pick up truck.  And they
are, they're very popular and I guess they run, they, they, you, they just
keep running and running and running.  They have a really good track record.

B.90:  Yeah, I knew a guy here had a, a Nissan pick up truck and he had like a
hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil.  Never
had a problem with it.

A.91:  Yeah.  I know this, this person, they go, they have this old Toyota truck
and he goes yep, I says, you know, this thing's been running for me for two
years, he goes, boy, I wish I had the money to treat it right.  I'm, uh, what
do you s-, you mean, he s-, oh, I haven't tuned it up in two years and I
change the oil about every four months because he can't afford to, uh, change
the oil as often as he would like and he can't afford to tune it up.

B.92:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.93:  So, it, it's amazing, even when you abuse them.  

B.94:  [Laughter] Yeah, my wife's brother had a, he lives in California, and he
had a Honda Accord, I think, and he had like a hundred fifty thousand miles on
it.  And he sold it and, uh, never had a problem with it, whereas I got a
Chevette, and it's, the car's al-, almost twelve years old and I got
seventy-one thousand miles on it is all and I've had problems with it, just
all the time.

A.95:  All the time.  

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  Well, I, I have problems with my car.  I'm not saying, it's not perfect or
anything, but I wouldn't trade my Saab for anything [laughter].

B.98:  I bet. 

A.99:  I,

B.100:  Now, isn't that, isn't that a Swedish car?  

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  Or Norwegian or something.  

A.103:  It's a Swedish car.  I'm just being stupid and sentimental, it's just
because, it's about the only kind of car I've ever had.  I had a Volvo once,
you know, it's like if I had to go out, if I, to buy a truck, I could, I could
go out and easily buy a truck, but I'd have a hard time going out and buying
another car --

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  -- if it wasn't a Saab.  I don't know.  

B.106:  How did you like your Volvo?  

A.107:  Uh, it was, it was fine, but it was an old one.  And -- 

B.108:  Huh.  

A.109:  -- uh, it was pretty much, it, or, was something that I bought to resell
because it was really, uh, it was a nice old Volvo and at that time I was
going to college, and I liked to go camping and Bajaing and going up dirt
roads and I was ruining the car, so I sold it,

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  and I saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that -- 

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  -- I could beat around.  

B.114:  [Laughter].  

A.115:  So, it worked out pretty well.  I've never had problems really getting,
getting cars.  It's, it's refusing them because, uh, people always come to my
father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know
that they deal and sell them [laughter].  So,

B.116:  That's, that's a pretty good deal. 

A.117:  Yes, my father's very shrewd with them [laughter].  

B.118:  I always told to my wife, that if I had to do it over again, I would, uh,
have my own car dealership and used car dealership and, uh, she'd be, be a
travel agent.  That way, if I needed another car, I just go get it and
whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good
discount and take off.

A.119:  Yeah, that's a good way to do it.  Uh, the thing about it is, you got to,
you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic --

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  -- if you want to be involved and that's a hard job.  

B.122:  Yeah, it is.  

A.123:  Well, I, you know, I always dream of buying a new car, but I don-, just the
money --

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  -- just isn't worth that, that shininess. 

B.126:  Who can afford twenty thousand.  

A.127:  Yeah, they're very expensive.  I mean ...
