=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, um, so, um, do you have any favorite teams?

A.2:  Well, I kind of like them all.  I played for about eighteen years, all the
way through college, and then, uh, kind of hung them up after college, but,
[laughter].

B.3:  Oh, I was going to say, you played pro ball, right? 

A.4:  No, not quite.

B.5:  Not quite, huh.

A.6:  Made it, yeah, made it all the way through four years of college playing
ball, but,

B.7:  Oh.

A.8:  Anyway.  Uh, being in Rochester, you probably like the Mets.

B.9:  Yes, I'm actually a Met, I'm, I'm one of these people who's actually a die
hard Mets fan,

A.10:  [Laughter].

B.11:  and an avid Yankee hater.

A.12:  Oh, boy, it, I think it's like one or the other, isn't it.  I mean,

B.13:  Yeah, it's, it's, I, I, I find it very strange.  Um, more people, you know,
real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets
for some reason.

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  I never fou-, I never quite found a New York fan.

A.16:  [Laughter].

B.17:  I always found a fan, you know, of either one or the other, and so, that of
course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the
Red Sox --

A.18:  Oh, okay,

B.19:  -- by default, because I went to college also in Boston.

A.20:  I see, yeah, I like the, uh, huh, I guess if I had to pick a favorite team,
any more, as well as, I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia.

B.21:  Oh.

A.22:  I'm from New Jersey originally.

B.23:  Yeah, so that, so that's sort of close enough.

A.24:  Yeah, well, we were thirty miles south of them, so.

B.25:  Oh, so you were pretty close.

A.26:  Yeah, right down the river, but, uh, so what are the Mets going to do this
year without Strawberry?

B.27:  Well, I don't know. Um, there's, there's a part of me that says that, you
know, um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away.

A.28:  [Laughter].

B.29:  You know, when, when he sort of went away, I started thinking, yeah, well,
he was performing fairly well, but he really wasn't worth the baggage, you
know.

A.30:  Yeah.

B.31:  Um, I think they're okay, I think they're, you know, I think they have
enough people who are, who are, who are still in their prime, you know.

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  Um, I mean, certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, you know,
um, eight years ago or something, they're --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- they're, they're, they're, you know, they're sort of in, in good
standing, whereas, you know, um, [noise] {knocking sound} I think, I certainly
don't think they're the eighty-six team any more.

A.36:  Well, I was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team [laughter].

B.37:  Yeah, I,

A.38:  That was, that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings, right.

B.39:  Right, they (( )) beat Houston in extra innings, and then they actually won
the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route, um, against Boston --

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  -- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner (( )).

A.42:  [Laughter].

B.43:  I felt real bad about that, but hey, what can you do.

A.44:  Hey, the guy's making millions, he ought to be able to perform, right.

B.45:  That's right, well, actually, he, he, he was supposedly, um, there was,
there was something wrong with him at the time, and I,

A.46:  Well, his knees were bothering him, yeah.

B.47:  Right, and I, and I understand that, and I say, Hey if the guy can't play,
you don't blame that, uh, hit it to him, you blame the team, you know, for
putting him in,

A.48:  Yeah, for having him out there.

B.49:  That's right, so.

A.50:  Sure.

B.51:  So, I, I, I was, uh, I was also, I was in school at Boston at the time.

A.52:  Oh, boy.

B.53:  So, I, it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met
fans and, um, half Sox fans.

A.54:  Yeah, I think we were all pretty much, uh, Astros fans, in the National
League Championship Series --

B.55:  Oh.

A.56:  -- but there's like two fellows from, uh, Brooklyn,

B.57:  [Laughter].

A.58:  and they, they were, you know, they were pretty much without having to
say, they were pretty much Mets fans [laughter].

B.59:  Yeah, yeah, well I guess they were, uh, I guess they must have been scared
[laughter] after the, uh,

A.60:  No, not really, they were pretty much thugs, they weren't scared very much,
you know [laughter].

B.61:  Well, that's good, well, they're Brooklyn boys, I guess.

A.62:  Yeah [laughter].

B.63:  You don't expect them to be, uh, much of anything but thugs.  I know.  I
was born there.  Um.

A.64:  Really.

B.65:  Yeah, I, I was, I was also born in Brooklyn, so I can call myself a
Brooklyn thug, although I'm really not.

A.66:  Okay, okay.  Well, I'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs,
but these two were definitely thugs, and they were from Brooklyn [laughter].

B.67:  [Laughter].

A.68:  So I'm kind of hoping, I, I, I guess, uh, any more I pretty much pull for
the Rangers though.  They're, uh, they're, they're they, they have, I think
they have the best facilities in the major leagues.

B.69:  Yeah.

A.70:  I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium.  It's great.

B.71:  [Laughter] Well, that, that's actually, I think I make something, because
I think, and, and, and in as much as sort of fan support helps.

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  You know, it's good to have, um,

A.74:  The only problem is it's not large enough.  It only holds about, I think
they, when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player, they squeezed about
forty thousand people in there.

B.75:  Yes, it is kind of small.

A.76:  Yeah, so they're, they, they have plans, I mean, the owner tried to move
them to Florida --

B.77:  Right.

A.78:  -- but, uh, they ended up sticking around in Arlington, and they're going
to build a new stadium in Arlington, as a matter of fact, not even in Dallas,

B.79:  Oh, that's great. So,

A.80:  So that's, that's something that we're looking forward to.

B.81:  Yeah, that'll be nice, I mean, that, that, I think, tends to keep, I think
stadiums (( )) work tend to keep people happy.

A.82:  Oh, case in point, Toronto.

B.83:  Yeah, exactly.

A.84:  Yeah, have you seen a game up there?  

B.85:  Uh, I haven't been to any Toronto games yet.  But, um,

A.86:  Oh, boy, I saw it, I was up there on business, uh, last June and watched a
game in the sky dome.  It was just phenomenal.  That's, that's probably the
pattern for the future of stadiums, I think.

B.87:  Of stadiums, yeah, well, I, I mean to get up there.  I mean, the, the best
I've been up here so far, you know, up, in up state New York --

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  -- is, uh, is, um, Rochester Red Wings game.

A.90:  Now is Rochester, where, where is Cornell University.  

B.91:  Oh, Cornell is in Ithaca.

A.92:  Ithaca.

B.93:  Uh, yeah, so Cornell is about, um, somewhere, uh, about two and a half
hours south of, south and east of us.

A.94:  Okay.

B.95:  So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of.

A.96:  Yeah, well Rochester is like right on the shores, isn't it?

B.97:  Yeah, we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario.  

A.98:  Yeah, okay.

B.99:  Actually whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion,

A.100:  [Laughter].

B.101:  because they built it, they built it far enough from the city that it
actually couldn't be a port city.

A.102:  Oh, 

B.103:  Um, but they,

A.104:  Well, they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the
lights of Rochester on a clear night.

B.105:  Oh, really, I ne-, I hadn't actually known that.

A.106:  Yeah.

B.107:  Well, um, but we have our own, um, our own triple A team here --

A.108:  Yeah.

B.109:  -- the Redwings, which are --

A.110:  Yeah, okay.

B.111:  -- they're a farm team for the Orioles.

A.112:  Yeah.

B.113:  So everybody hopes that, uh, they go all the way around here.  There's the,
they're the big team in Rochester.

A.114:  Those games are fun to watch.  You, you, you watch those games?

B.115:  Oh, yeah, I actually, we, we, we make a point of going to a bunch of them
every year because they're fun.

A.116:  Yeah.

B.117:  Lots of really big, you know, lots of local fans, you know, small stadium,
you know, um, and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes, you
know --

A.118:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.119:  -- um, especially, you know, I'll make a day game or something.

A.120:  Yeah.

B.121:  But they really seem to, uh, people really get into it.  I mean, I can't,
I, I, again, I can't make any predictions about them, but I suspect they'll
go, uh, they'll go fly.

A.122:  [Laughter] Yeah, we used to like watching, my, my folks lived down in
Beaumont, and, uh, on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the
Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres, I think, but,
uh, they, they were fun games to watch.

B.123:  Yeah.  Those are, those are, uh, I think those are more fun than major
league games sometimes.

A.124:  Someti-, well, there's definitely a lot more hitting [laughter].

B.125:  Yes, it's true.

A.126:  [Laughter].

B.127:  One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are --

A.128:  Yeah.

B.129:  -- uh, uh, you know, I guess, I guess when you start pitching real well,
well, move them up.  Bam (( )).

A.130:  Yeah.

B.131:  Yeah, but um.

A.132:  So as far as the major league teams, [barking] I don't know, the Rangers
have been, you know, every year they always knock on the door early, and then
just go into their skid about, you know, the end of June.

B.133:  [Laughter].

A.134:  But they, they've got so much young, raw talent, it's just amazing, and
then they just haven't been able to put anything together.

B.135:  Well, the way I, the way I see it, is, I mean, um, you know, I can use a
Met analogy here.

A.136:  Uh-huh.

B.137:  If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort
of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of,
well trained --

A.138:  Yeah.

B.139:  -- you know, back to, you know, maybe eighty, eighty-four or 
eighty-three --

A.140:  Uh-huh.

B.141:  -- or eighty-five, you know, when they were first, when they weren't quite
the eighty-six team that, that, that they were.

A.142:  Right.

B.143:  I, I, that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next
year, I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself
up.

A.144:  Yeah, I mean, they've been, they've been young for a while, and they're
almo-, almost starting to age a little bit here, I just, um.

B.145:  [Laughter].

A.146:  Yeah, yeah, they, they really hurting pitching wise.  I mean, they've got
Ryan, but, you know, who knows what he'll be able to do.  He's been, last year
he started having some nagging injuries, and --

B.147:  Right, but.

A.148:  -- but, it'll, it'll be interesting to watch.  I hope to get up there.  We,
we usually try to get to opening day game.  There's several guys from our
church try to go up there.

B.149:  Oh, that must be nice.

A.150:  Yeah, well, I, I guess we're probably, oh, maybe a hundred fifty miles
south of Dallas.

B.151:  Well, that isn't too bad.  Just a couple of hours.

A.152:  No, not too bad, but it takes about two hours, two and a half hours to get
there.

B.153:  Yeah, well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium.

A.154:  [Laughter].

B.155:  So, I don't know.

A.156:  That's probably because of the roads.  You just don't have, we, we've just
got a freeway.  We just get right on the freeway and just go north.

B.157:  Yeah, well, actually, we can, we can, I can take a highway the whole way
down, but it's still, it's some --

A.158:  Well, it's so crowded up there.

B.159:  -- it's, it's almost four hundred hou-, I mean, I mean, it's almost four
hundred, you know, barring traffic, it's four hundred hours, I mean, four
hundred mil-, four hundred hours, right, [laughter] four hundred miles --

A.160:  Golly.

B.161:  -- barring traffic, so, it's, um, it's, it's, you know, it's a heck of a
drive.  We are substantially north of New York enough that, uh --

A.162:  Yeah.

B.163:  -- we don't get to go play --

A.164:  Um.

B.165:  -- too often.

A.166:  Well, yeah, you're, you're like a boat ride from, how far is it across the
lake to Canada?

B.167:  Toronto.

A.168:  Toronto?

B.169:  Oh Toronto's only about two hours, yeah.

A.170:  Yeah.

B.171:  Toronto, I mean, I want to go see.

A.172:  Do, do you drive there, or do you take the ferry, or what?

B.173:  Um, I can, I've actually I've driven, but I've heard about the ferry as
well.

A.174:  Yeah.

B.175:  Haven't taken it yet, though.  Have you taken it?

A.176:  Yeah, it's a, it's a beautiful city.

B.177:  Yeah, um, I, I really love, I think that's one of the most, uh, enjoyable
things about being up here.  I'm only up here for school.

A.178:  Uh-huh.  So, and then, I mean, you go back to New York after school?

B.179:  Uh, no, probably south, maybe Texas [laughter].

A.180:  Oh, really.

B.181:  Some place south, and warm, I don't, I'm not a big, uh, I'm not a big, uh,
cold fan.

A.182:  Well, what kind of weather are you having right now?

B.183:  Uh, right now we're actually having, uh, it's getting nice.  I mean, it was
in the high fifties today, but three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm
[laughter].

A.184:  Oh, boy, yeah, we've been up in the, oh, seventies, eighties, even up in
the nineties a couple of weeks ago.

B.185:  Oh, that's great.  You know, about that same time branches were falling off
everywhere, and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks.

A.186:  Golly.  Because of the ice?

B.187:  Because it, didn't make the nat-, national news too much, which I find
really weird --

A.188:  Um.

B.189:  -- but, um, we were, I mean, um, you know, all schools were closed for
almost, for over, for a week.

A.190:  Golly.

B.191:  There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive.

A.192:  Huh, illegal,

B.193:  Yeah, because they had so many power lines down --

A.194:  Oh, yeah.

B.195:  -- and so many, uh, things like that, so they were ...
