REMARKS:        Both subjects deviated from the topic. 

======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  The topic said to discuss the weather.  What is it like where you
are?  And how's that different from normal [laughter].

@B.2:  Well, I tell you what it is.  It's warm where I'm at [laughter].  

A.3:  [Laughter]  Well, let's see if you're in Plano, and I'm in Plano, are you
in east Plano or west Plano?

B.4:  Uh, west Plano.  

A.5:  Okay, well, I'm in east Plano.  I'm out in Las Rios, so it's bound to be
different over here.

B.6:  Okay [laughter].  Good deal.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Well, I tell you what, uh, yesterday I went out and played a little golf
and, uh, I paid the price.  My neck got --

A.9:  Oh.

B.10:  -- got burned to a crisp. 

A.11:  Got a little sunburn.

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  But, uh, it was --

A.15:  (( )).

B.16:  -- it was beautiful out.  

A.17:  I worked around in the yard a little bit and I've, got sunburned a few
years ago and, you know, got one of those, what, second or third degree burns
and the doctor looked at it --

B.18:  Oh, Lord.  

A.19:  -- and said don't ever, 

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  don't ever let that area get sunburned again.  

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  And, uh, it's got the, you know, the kind of the black freckled things on
it --

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  -- that the doctor looks at every once in awhile for that, what melanoma
business (( )).

B.26:  Exactly.  

A.27:  So, I am super, well, if we go down to Galveston to the beach or something
like that, you know, I look kind of stupid.  I'm out there in a t-shirt and
everything (( )).

B.28:  [Laughter] All covered up. 

A.29:  Pretty much covered up, but, uh, you know, I'm never going to let my
shoulders and back get sunburned again.

B.30:  Well, I tell you. I'm the same way. I tell you.  I, I knew better, I should
have put some sunscreen on --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- uh, yesterday.  But, I don't know, it felt so #nice out.#   

A.33:  #Well, it is# March after all.  You know, you're not supposed to worry 
about --

B.34:  Well, that's right.

A.35:  -- #sunburn in March,#

B.36:  #That's right.#  They shouldn't even be selling suntan lotion, yet.

A.37:  That's right.

B.38:  But, uh, hopefully, uh, you know, it's going to stay warm for this weekend,
and, uh.

A.39:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I hope so.  Yeah, we're going to go to Lubbock.  They'll
probably have another sandstorm out there, you know.

B.40:  [Laughter] So you're going to go to the big city of Lubbock, huh?

A.41:  Big Lubbock, yeah.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  Are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or,

B.44:  No.  I just been, uh, up here in Plano, for about, uh, I guess close to
three years #now, and, uh.#

A.45: # Okay, well.#  Well, where were you from originally?

B.46:  I grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and, uh, I went to
school at Tech, there in Lubbock.

A.47:  Oh, well, I'm a Tech graduate, so.   

B.48:  Are you?  

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  Okay.  

A.51:  I grew up over in New Mexico, at Roswell.  

B.52:  I see.  

A.53:  And my wife is from Plains, if you know where Plains is.   

B.54:  I've heard of Plains, #yeah.#

A.55:  #It's on the,# it's on the road, when you go, well, you go south out of
Lubbock down to Brownfield --

B.56:  Right.  

A.57:  -- and then you, like you're headed over toward Roswell.  Plains is right
there, uh, about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line.

B.58:  I see, okay.  

A.59:  So, yeah, you talk of little towns in west Texas, yeah, I'm [laughter],

B.60:  Well, see I'm from a town named Panhandle.  

A.61:  Okay.  Yeah, I know where #Panhandle is.#  

B.62:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.63:  That's north up there isn't it?  

B.64:  Right.  Right.  Right up there by Amarillo.   

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  So, uh,

A.67:  Yeah.  I had a friend who lived in Dumas.  

B.68:  Okay. Yeah.  On the other side of Amarillo.  Yeah.

A.69:  Yeah, so anyway, yeah, we're kind of familiar with that part of the world.
Now there's where the weather's interesting.  I think it's kind of dull around
here compared to.

B.70:  Well, that's right because one day it will be eighty and the next day it
will be about thirty below.  I tell you what, and, uh.

A.71:  Yeah.  My mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day
and they said Friday they ha-, or Thursday or Friday, they had, you know, one
of the world-class sandstorms out there that happens every once in awhile.

B.72:  Oh, Lord.  

A.73:  Hadn't had one like that in a couple of years.  

B.74:  [Laughter] That's one thing I do not miss about, uh, being in Lubbock.  I
tell you.  Because, one, I'll never forget, uh, one spring we had a real big
dust storm come in and it started raining, 

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  and, uh, it was like raining mud out there, you know.  

A.77:  Yeah.  I recall a snirtstorm out there one day where, about this time of
year --

B.78:  (( )).

A.79:  -- that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in
the air and then it snowed a little bit,

B.80:  Oh, Lord [laughter].  

A.81:  And, uh, I can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than I could in
Lubbock, but still,

B.82:  Right.  

A.83:  Anywhere out there, it could happen.  

B.84:  That's exactly right.  

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  I tell you.  

A.87:  Yeah, I, we, like I said, I grew up in New Mexico.  We lived in
Albuquerque, Karen and I both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and
then I went to work for T I here --

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  -- and I came here in sixty-nine.  And then in seventy-two they opened, or
seventy-three, they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and, uh, man,
that was like going home.

B.90:  [Laughter].  

A.91:  And so went out there and were there for about ten years until that all
folded up out there.

B.92:  I see.  

A.93:  Ended up coming back, but, uh, yeah, the weather out there was, uh-huh.  It
could get a little bit, a little bit interesting now and again.

B.94:  Oh, it sure can because of the, the, you never just, you can just never
tell what it's going to do.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  And, uh, it's just hard to plan anything.  

A.97:  Well, if you've been here for three years.  You didn't get here the year
that had the big freeze and stuff here, did you?  #What was that, eighty# --

B.98:  #Uh, I did, this,#

A.99:  -- eighty-four.  

B.100:  Okay.

A.101:  Oh, wow, that would have been six or seven years ago.  

B.102:  Yeah.  Uh, my first year down here, uh, uh, that first winter I remembered
T I was closed one, one day.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  Uh.

A.105:  With the ice, yeah.

B.106:  Yeah, with the ice.  But that, uh, that's about the worst, worst winter
I've been, been through down here.

A.107:  Well, the, uh, was it, I guess it was three years ago, that they had the
real, right before, was it right before Christmas, or?  Yeah.

B.108:  #Yeah, where it got just real, real cold.#  

A.109:  #Yeah, got down to around# zero somewhere.  

B.110:  Yeah.  

A.111:  Warmed backup and killed everything off.  

B.112:  Right [laughter].  

A.113:  That was, that was bad news.  We're still try-, I set out a whole bunch of
Crepe Myrtles and stuff and, of course, it killed them.

B.114:  Oh, Lord.  

A.115:  Well, they all come back from, from the bottom.  

B.116:  Right.  

A.117:  So, I'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally
here, there's no sense in planting it --

B.118:  #That's right, because the weather's going to get it.#

A.119:  -- #because eventually you're going to lose it.#

B.120:  Exactly.  

A.121:  And you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now.
The native trees [laughter], they're, they --

B.122:  #They still don't have leaves on them, yet.#

A.123:  -- #they know better, they know better.  Yeah.#

B.124:  That's right.  That's exactly right.  And, uh, my wife and I are going
through that process now.  We just bought a house --

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  -- and we're trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping.  And
we still have to put a yard in.

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  And, uh, I'm still trying to decide when, when the best time's going to be
to do that.

A.129:  Yeah. 

B.130:  So, uh.

A.131:  Well, you're just about there.  

B.132:  That's, that's right, you know.  I'd, I'd like to get the yard in before
all the rain start.

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  And, uh, you know, if we could get it up a little bit, then the rain would
really just help it.

A.135:  Well, we moved into this house it was a year old, and the landscaping was
semi-in, but there was still a lot more to do --

B.136:  I see.  

A.137:  -- and one of the things that, uh, well, they were really selling everybody
on back then was this Indian Hawthorne.  Boy, you know, that's the best stuff
in the world.

B.138:  Right.  

A.139:  Well, I am somewhat less than enthused about that, 

B.140:  [Laughter].  

A.141:  I've got some out here that's five, six years old now and still doesn't
look a whole lot different than the day I put it in.

B.142:  Oh, is that right.  

A.143:  I noticed that a lot of the garden, well, you know, that Indian Hawthorne,
that didn't work out quite as well as we thought,

B.144:  Right.  

A.145:  #So now they're pushing something else.#

B.146:  #Well Neil Sperry hasn't been# --

A.147:  #Yeah.#  

B.148:  -- #pushing that# real hard and heavy here lately.    

A.149:  Yeah.  Well, anyway, uh, like I said, if it doesn't grow out in the woods
here somewhere, I'm not sure [laughter],

B.150:  #That it's worth planting, huh.#

A.151:  #that it's worth planting, yeah.#

B.152:  That's exactly right.  

A.153:  This, uh, Photinia, the red tipped bush --

B.154:  The red tipped bush, yeah. 

A.155:  -- it seems to do pretty good.  We've got some here that's really taken
off.

B.156:  Well, yeah.  I, I, I know everybody in our neighborhood has, has those
bushes.  And, uh, like I say, really seem to, to do well.

A.157:  That and, uh, the little Dwarf Yaupon --

B.158:  Right.  

A.159:  -- hollies, you know --

B.160:  Ho-, yeah.  

A.161:  -- they seem to or just Yaupons, period, seem to do all right.

B.162:  Right.  

A.163:  And we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and, of course,
they're, they weren't native to this particular spot, but they seem to have
done pretty good.

B.164:  They sure have.  

A.165:  And, uh, 

B.166:  That's a good tree.  It sort of stays green most of the year --

A.167:  Yeah.  

B.168:  -- you know, and.

A.169:  It's a strange one, it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's
doing.  Because right now is when it's dropping it's leaves,

B.170:  Right.  

A.171:  And you go out there and you look at your tree after a good windstorm and
the thing is bare and you think, oh, know.

B.172:  [Laughter]  The thing's died.  

A.173:  Look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come
out --

B.174:  Right.  

A.175:  -- so, it holds it's leaves all winter, then loses them in the spring.

B.176:  Yeah.  

A.177:  That and that red, what is it, Red Oak? 

B.178:  Red Oak, yeah.  

A.179:  We're thinking about putting one of those in.  

B.180:  Only thing is those things grow pretty slow --

A.181:  Uh-huh.

B.182:  -- you have to.

A.183:  Well, you know I heard something about that here, whether Neil, uh, here
again, it may have been Neil Sperry.  They say, you know, everybody looks at
these oaks and says, yeah, they grow slow and all that --

B.184:  Right.  

A.185:  -- but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow, because
they don't get the water, they don't get the (( )) --

B.186:  #Oh, is that right?#

A.187:  -- #so that they're# growing under bad conditions.  

B.188:  Yeah.  

A.189:  And, uh, if you bring one in --

B.190:  So if you were to fertilize it and.

A.191:  -- or (( )) under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree.

B.192:  Huh, well that's surprising.  

A.193:  Yeah.  

B.194:  That's good to know.  

A.195:  Anyway, that's, that was, I guess he was talking about some of the other
kinds of oaks, I don't know --

B.196:  Right.  Right.  

A.197:  -- whether the Live, the Live Oak's is not really an oak, I guess, it's
something,

B.198:  I think it's just by name, yeah.

A.199:  Yeah.  It just got the, the name of being an oak, because it's got a kind
of an acorn kind of thing on it.

B.200:  Right, right.

A.201:  But, uh, I think the real honest to gosh oaks, like the, what, Bur Oaks and
Pin Oaks, and Red Oaks and all that sort of thing, they, they'll grow a lot
faster.

B.202:  Yeah.  Huh.

@@A.203:  Well I guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but 
that's,

B.204:  [Laughter].  

A.205:  [Laughter].

B.206:  At least, we had a good conversation, anyway.

A.207:  Yeah.  

B.208:  Yeah, but, uh.

A.209:  Well, are you, you with T I? 

B.210:  Yes, I am.  

A.211:  Yeah.  

B.212:  Yeah.  

A.213:  How many, have you gotten very many of these calls at home?

B.214:  Um, probably about three, I guess.  

A.215:  Okay.  Well, I got the first one this evening that I had gotten at home, I,

B.216:  I see.  

A.217:  I had made a couple at work, you know --

B.218:  Right.  

A.219:  -- Ma-, made several from work, but I'd never, uh, I'd never gotten one
yet, and I was just,

B.220:  Gotten one at home, uh.  

A.221:  Yeah.

B.222:  Yeah, I've gotten about three, I  guess.  

A.223:  Yeah.  

B.224:  So.  

A.225:  Well [laughter].  You know, you'd think that this crazy system, if you're
going to talk about something about the weather, they'd have tried to --

B.226:  #Split it up a little bit.#

A.227:  -- #plug you in with,# plug you in to somebody, like, you know,

B.228:  Like New York or somewhere, yeah.

A.229:  New York or something, yeah.

B.230:  That's right.  

A.231:  Yeah.  

B.232:  But, uh,

A.233:  Weather difference between east and west Plano.  

B.234:  Exactly [laughter].  

A.235:  [Laughter].  

B.236:  Clear across town.  

A.237:  Clear across town [laughter].   

B.238:  But, uh,

A.239:  Well, when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference
there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights.

B.240:  Right.

A.241:  You know, it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be
shining and it would be hot down in the, 

B.242:  [Laughter].  

A.243:  downtown, but, uh,
