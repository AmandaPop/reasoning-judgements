===========================================================================

A.1:  Want me to press the one button.

B.2:  I'm ready whenever you are.

A.3:  Okay, sir.  Uh, Jack do you have any pets?

B.4:  Jim,

A.5:  Jim.  Sorry about that.  Do you have any pets?

@B.6:  [Laughter] No, no, I do not.  I, uh, I live in an apartment.

A.7:  Okay, well that would kind of preclude --

B.8:  Well,

A.9:  -- having a pet.

B.10:  Well, not really.  Most of my neighbors --

A.11:  Um.

B.12:  -- have pets, dogs --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- of course.

A.15:  Well, we've got, we've got a cat, and this is a very, very special cat
because, uh, we lived in the Philippines for thirty months.  We worked for T I
in (( )) {foreign name} City, in the Philippines.  And, uh, as you know, uh,
the Filipinos are quite poor.  And, and, uh, they don't, uh, generally they
eat their pets.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  Well, not generally, but dogs they do.  Uh, so having a pet is, is a luxury
most of them don't have, and we, uh, were able to find one that was born in a
store, and the, uh, a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away,
and we took him home with us when he was about three weeks old, and, uh,
ultimately my family moved back to Dallas, and I had to stay on in the
Philippines ten months after they went back, and, uh, eventually I shipped him
home by air, and you know, you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred
and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean.

B.18:  I agree, and how, they, you know, the uh, the, uh, health officials let him
in the country?

A.19:  Yeah, there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our
neighborhood, and we had all the proper paperwork, and, and I shipped him, uh,
uh, by air, and, uh, let my family know when he was going to be in, and they
went out to the freight claiming area out at, uh, D F W airport and claimed
him.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  It was, it was, it was, it was pretty interesting.  Uh, did you have any
pets when you were growing up?

B.22:  I always had pets when I grew up.

A.23:  Oh, okay.  What did you have?

B.24:  Oh, I had, uh, I started with a cat --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- an old, you know, alley cat --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- an old Tom, but I had dogs, primarily --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and, uh, mostly purebreds.

A.31:  Oh, yeah.

B.32:  But, uh, we had a large yard --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- and, uh, we did not have the pets in the house.  Uh, they all, they were
always outdoors [laughter].

A.35:  They, they, they lived outdoors.  And you know,

B.36:  But I had a cat, I have a, I had a cat, uh, uh, when I was living in, in,
uh, Pensacola, Florida.  Uh, we had a, uh, cat that I got from, again from a
friend.  It was born in a barn.  Uh, it was, they had a, a small farm.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  So there were lots of cats around.  So I picked out one, and got it for my
daughter, and, uh, had it, uh, spayed and declawed, and we did keep it in the
house, restricted to the, uh, first floor.

A.39:  Oh, yeah.

B.40:  And it was, uh, not a bad experience, but for the most part I'm, I'm
reluctant to have animals in the house.  I just, I just don-, do not feel
that, particularly dogs, uh, I do not feel that they fare well --

A.41:  Yeah, if they're,

B.42:  -- uh, in the, in the house.

A.43:  And it's amazing how they, how they adapt to the outside.  I was raised in
New England, and we had an Eskimo Spitz, and he was never in the house a day
in his life.  And I can, you know, I remember like, this like sounds like old
grandfather stories,

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  but I can remember thirty-five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the
ground.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And,

B.48:  Well, I, yeah, I had a malamute --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- at one time, and, uh, stayed outside. 

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  I was raised in Southern West Virginia.

A.53:  Oh, okay.

B.54:  So the winters would get fairly cold.  The only problem with it is that the
bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night
[laughter].

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter] And the, it's, uh, wolf origins, uh, came to the fore,
particularly during the full moon,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] and, but I always [noise] had, uh, dogs, I had a terrier
first, and then I had a, [/noise] uh, let's see, I had a terrier, then I had a
cocker spaniel, then a, then the, uh, malamute, and then the last dog I had
was a, uh, basset hound.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  But they all stayed outside.

A.61:  Oh, for goodness sakes.  Yeah.  Uh, the only dog we ever had, we lived,
prior to living in the Philippines with T I, we lived in Malaysia, and we were
told when we got there that it would be good to get a dog because, uh, there
were a lot of, uh, breaking and entering and robberies --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- and the native Malays by religion are scared of dogs.  In fact, the lick
of a dog is supposed to be something very, very bad, something very evil.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  So what happened, uh, was anybody that had a dog, at least the native
Malays made up fifty percent of the population.  If you had a dog, uh, you
wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay.  Uh, the other fifty percent was pa-, some
Chinese, some Indians, and they (( )).  They didn't have qu-, any qualms about
dogs.

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  So we went down to the local S P C A, uh, the American association in (( ))
{foreign city name}, uh, actually had, uh, uh, an S P C A there, and we went
down and picked us up a little old female mongrel, and, uh, and brought her
home, and she made an excellent pet.

B.68:  Um.

A.69:  Except the only problem is, we played badminton in the yard a lot,

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the
yard at night before we went to play badminton [laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter] Right [laughter].

A.73:  But, I'm, I'm a runner by, by hobby, and she used to love to get outside
the gate, and I'd put her leash on and take her running with me --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- and it was only years later I read that you shouldn't do it,
particularly in the tropical climates where we were.  And when she came back
she'd drink about three panfuls of water [laughter].

B.76:  Yeah, I bet.

A.77:  But anywa-, it wasn't, it wasn't in the heat of the day.  I'd always go
running about seven o'clock in the evening or something like that.  But, boy
she was ready.  I'd get that leash and she'd come over and start jumping all
over me to get ready to go, and, and.

B.78:  You know, the, you know, the last one we had, the, uh, my, uh, my father
owned a plumbing and heating business, and my brother and I frequently worked
for him during the summer when my brother was in college and I was in high
school.  And so, uh, this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the
automobile.

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  And so, we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job, pack
it a lunch, and it would, you know, get out of the car and find a nice cool
spot to rest, and my brother and I would go work, and we'd come, uh, break for
lunch, and, and the, uh, unpack the dog's lunch, and so forth, and the other
workers, the carpenters and so forth, used to get just a hell of a charge out
of it.  Because, you know, here are these two guys, you know, walked in with
clean clothes, you know, every day [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  My, my, of course my mother wouldn't let us leave the house without clean
clothes.

A.83:  Oh, yeah.

B.84:  You know, with a dog,

A.85:  [Laughter].

B.86:  bringing a dog on the job,

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  and they didn't realize we were working for my father.  So [laughter] that,
uh --

A.89:  Oh for goodness sake.

B.90:  -- it was, uh, but the people around here, they're, you know, as I mention
them, the, uh, the neighbors, a lot of the neighbors have, uh, pets.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  Of course, they, you see them out walking every evening, but --

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  -- they range, you know, the couple upstairs that, above me, has a long
hair dachshund.  Uh, the lady is German.  But, uh, there are some huge dogs
around here.  It's really phenomenal.  I cannot see, I mean, I've seen
everything from, you know, Great Danes and German Shepherds, and just really
huge animals.  And how they keep them confined, uh, the apartments are fine --

A.95:  I'm sure.

B.96:  -- they are relatively large, but to stay there all day is fan-, you know,
fantastic.

A.97:  Well, we, we, we live in a, in a, in a residential neighborhood, and the
animals pretty well run, a lot of people have fences in their backyards, and,
and dogs are kept inside fences.  Uh, ca-, cats are pretty well on the run.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  Fortunately people are responsible and they've all been spayed or neutered,
so we don't have gigantic litters of kittens running around here.  But, they,
uh, it's interesting, the lady across from us has always taken in strays, and
she's got six or seven cats, and one of her cats, somehow or other must have
get into our house accidentally, uh, when the door was open, and found where
our cat's food dish is, and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers,

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  and when I pull my car up in the evening, I can hear him, she leaves her
garage door open, most of them sleep in the garage at night, and no matter
what time of night it is, he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's
forcing his head in the door when I open the door, and I go in, he goes in, he
gets a great big mouthful of food cause he knows I'm going to pick him up
right off and put him back out again.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  And some days, he'll follow me up the front walk, so I'll run around the
back of the house and try to go in the back door, and he'll, he'll go around
and beat me there.  So, I've got so that now, I fake him, I make a move toward
the back, so he runs around the back, then I go in the front door.

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  So, I, I can, I can get in without him, but he's, he's he's fat,

B.106:  It's amaz-, you know, it's amazing how they get conditioned,

A.107:  Yeah, he's, he's, he's

B.108:  and, it really is.

A.109: he's fat as a little pig.  And she took him to the vet, and the vet said,
You got to stop feeding him so much or he's going to die of a heart attack.
And, so she said, to me, You've got to stop feeding.  And I said, I don't do
it intentionally, I, and if I'm in the house already.  Sometimes I can keep
him out if I'm trying to come in the house and he's trying to come it too.  I
just kind of put my foot out, uh, against his neck while I'm, I'm trying to,
uh, get in the door, and that works.  But other times I'll forget that he's
out there at the door, and as soon as I open it to go out, he's by me like a
shot,

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  and by the time I can get him he's got a great big gigantic mouthful of
food.

B.112:  Well, he might be canvassing the neighborhood.  You just might be the last
stop on his, uh,

A.113:  No, I, I think, I, I, I think

B.114:  on his route during the day.

A.115:  he likes our food best.

B.116:  [Laughter].

A.117:  Uh, somehow or other our cat has become a house cat, and he, uh, he sleeps
with us.  He sleeps with my wife and I, and (( )) he sleeps across the foot of
the bed on top of either my feet or her feet above the covers.  And, uh,
except when it's extremely cold, and we don't get many days like that here in
Texas ...
