======================================================================

B.1:  Okay, well personally, I don't have any children.  I'm twenty-two and I'm
doing my Master's at N C State --

A.2:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.3:  -- so, uh, uh, children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now.

A.4:  Well, no, [laughter] would they, no.

B.5:  So what, what, how do you spend the time with your children?

A.6:  Well both of mine are boys.  They're --

B.7:  Um.

A.8:  -- eight and eleven --

B.9:  Okay, #and did,#

A.10:  --# and they're# into sports --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
[laughter].

B.13:  What, what are you doing?

A.14:  Baseball has started.

B.15:  Oh, okay.  Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play
baseball?

A.16:  Oh, oh, yes, we start here at, uh, five.

B.17:  Okay, and, and in, in his league do they have like a pitcher, or do they
have a standing ball or a machine, or what?

A.18:  Up until, it's coach pitch, until you get nine --

B.19:  Okay.

A.20:  -- which my little boy will be nine in May.  So he's going to be with, uh,
regular pitching --

B.21:  Oh, okay.

A.22:  -- and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching.

B.23:  Yeah.  I, I used to play soccer when I was that age --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- up in New York, so.

A.26:  But yes, we're into baseball, and it seems like soon as that over with we
get into basketball.  We even have peewee basketball here.

B.27:  [Laughter].

A.28:  So there's always something.

B.29:  Yeah, and how about, how about like on the weekends.  Do you do sports or
do you go out?

A.30:  Both.  If we're not doing sports we go somewhere.

B.31:  Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a
week #or something when they have school off?#

A.32: # Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.#

B.33:  In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now?

A.34:  No, usually in the summer time.

B.35:  And where do you go?

A.36:  Different places every year.  We,

B.37:  Have, have you been out of the country?

A.38:  No [laughter].

B.39:  Oh, okay, well, first, they always say, get to know your country first
before you leave,# I mean --#

A.40: # Uh-huh.#

B.41:  -- I, I lived in places, like when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D
C, I never went to the Washington Memorial, and then when I went back to
visit, I went to the Washington Memorial.

A.42:  You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington
quite often, and that must be the thing.  They really hadn't either.  They
went to the Memorial, you know, when they go, it's on business --

B.43:  Right.

A.44:  -- it's not really just to getting to sight see.

B.45:  Right.  Well, it's, it's a beautiful city.

A.46:  Oh, I #bet it is, too.#

B.47: # But, the problem is#, like first time I went out of here, and they took me
to Las Vegas --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- and that was the most boring place on earth.

A.50:  Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places.  But our child-, but when
we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.

B.51:  Yeah.  Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?

A.52:  Oh,# yes, yes, yes.#

B.53: # Oh, okay.  So,# but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was
eleven I went also to the Caribbean.

A.54: # Oh.#

B.55: # That,# that was fun.  That was, and, uh, then after that, I, my sister lives
in Turkey, so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.

A.56:  Oh,

B.57:  And this Christmas, I went to Turkey.  But basically, it's a, for the past
couple of years, I, since my parents are, are, well, I'm from Argentina, and
my parents live down there.  So, all the traveling I do is alone.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  And, uh, we were never much of, uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know,
made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  That was, uh, that was a lot of fun.

A.62:  Yes.

B.63:  But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a
family [laughter] family thing.  You know, one of those hell family vacations.

A.64:  Oh, yes, but we try, you know, I try, my husband also, we're involved in
everything our kids does --

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  -- because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old --

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  -- so I always just had a mother.  So I always thought, when I have kids,
you know, I really want to be involved with them.

B.69:  Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, so he could
buy us material things.

A.70:  Material things, yes, that is, yes,

B.71:  And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, but I still feel,
you know, it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- and the way I was brought up, and he wants me now, he, like he, you
know, like he wants to be best friends now --

A.74:  Best friends, now.

B.75:  -- and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be
twenty years old, and it's always the same man --

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  -- and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best
friends --

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  -- but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much,
because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family
taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to
the next and say, I'm sorry, you know.  It's like, you know, I love you and
let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know --

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  -- and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like I've
seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together, and you
know, his kids are, you know, when his little girl was five years old and
everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach, and she could go to sleep at
two in the morning --

A.82:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.83:  -- you know --

A.84:  Yeah.

B.85:  -- and, uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you
have, just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can
stay up --

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  -- you know, but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his
work from his house.

A.88:  Yeah, you have to --

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  -- I mean, you honestly do.  Now I have friends that I love to death, but,
and they have children, but their children does anything, we have to take
them, and, you know --

B.91:  Yeah.

A.92:  -- to do it.  And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, #you know.#

B.93: # Yeah,# yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my
theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do,
well, what I'll do is, you know, like, I mean, you might have problems, but
it's not your kids problems --

A.94:  Yeah, oh, yeah.

B.95:  -- you know, and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to,
you know, like, thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever
happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable
coming to me and saying, I got a problem --

A.96:  Problem, uh-huh

B.97:  -- you know, and, uh --

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  -- and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you
know, first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the
problem, you know, and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, because
once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot
better.

A.100:  Uh-huh, yeah, I agree with you very much so.  Now, we waited several years
before we started having children because we was still in college, and we knew
time wise, or, and money wise, too --

B.101:  Yeah.

A.102:  -- would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.

B.103:  Yeah, my, my father was raising four ki-, oh well, three kids before he had
me, so it was, uh, you know, you're trying, to support, uh, four kids, and
it's pretty hard --

A.104:  Yeah.

B.105:  -- you know, and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if
you would have only had two kids.

A.106:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.107:  He says yeah, but then I wouldn't have you, I go, yeah, but then you would
have a lot of money [laughter].

A.108:  That's right, but you can't take this money with us, though --

B.109:  Yeah.

A.110:  -- that's how I keep looking at it.

B.111:  But, you know, like, four, I mean fou-, four children is expensive,
especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of
state tuition.  I'm paying, you know, three thousand, no, what is it, two
thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.

A.112:  Oh.

B.113:  And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college,
but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, it's like,
what does it, what does it cost.  It costs five hundred dollars a semester
suppose.  Now they go to a state college and they live at home --

A.114:  Uh-huh.

B.115:  -- you know, and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, but you
know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they
planned ahead, you know, like --

A.116:  Oh, yeah, if you cou-, if you can, yeah.

B.117:  -- I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up
seven hundred dollars --

A.118:  Yeah.

B.119:  -- you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to
college, you know.

A.120:  What are you learning to be?

B.121:  Oh, oh, excuse me?

A.122:  What degree, I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of
college?

B.123:  Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.

A.124:  Oh, that's, my husband's into, uh, computers.

B.125:  Yeah, and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back
home --

A.126:  Uh-huh.

B.127:  -- because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to
--

A.128:  Yeah.

B.129:  -- Argentina.  Well, my dad wants me to go back.  So.

A.130:  And you don't want to?

B.131:  No.

A.132:  No, no.

B.133:  No, because if you go back there, then you can never get out.

A.134:  Oh.

B.135:  Like you don't have any money to, to, get out.

A.136:  Oh.

B.137:  So, uh, and, uh, I was thinking, you know, like, Oh my God, you know, I go
back there, and then, and I get married there, and now I have kids there, and
then I'll never leave the place, you know.

A.138:  Then you'll never leave.

B.139:  Yeah, I know, and that's, that's what happened to my brother.  He came to
school up here, and then when he went down there, he was just so bad off, you
know --

A.140:  Oh.

B.141:  -- from not being able to stay up here that --

A.142:  Uh-huh.

B.143:  -- his life just went down the drain.  So.

A.144:  Well maybe something will open up for you.  

B.145:  Yeah, I've been calling a lot of companies.  There, some of them are
interested.  Well, at least for a year and a half --

A.146:  Uh-huh.

B.147:  -- I can work, so.

A.148:  Well, may-, well I've enjoyed talking to you.

B.149:  All right, same here.

A.150:  Okay,# bye-bye.#

B.151:  #Bye-bye.#
