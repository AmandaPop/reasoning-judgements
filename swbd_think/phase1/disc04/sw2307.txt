============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well now, I'm from Dallas.

B.2:  Oh, okay.

A.3:  Well, actually, I'm living in Dallas.  I'm not from Dallas.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  I, uh, was living in West Texas before this --

B.6:  Okay.

A.7:  -- which is a very dry, arid, well obviously it's kind of a desert area.

B.8:  Right.  Getting, uh, close to Mexico, or,

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Real close.

B.10:  All right.  And,

A.11:  New Mexico, anyway.

B.12:  And not the humidity.  I usually think of the South as being very humid.

A.13:  Well, he-, Dallas is.

B.14:  Dallas is.

A.15:  (( )) since I've moved up here now so I'm beginning to get a little bit of
this.  But, I'll tell you, uh, considering, well, okay, I've, uh, mostly
throughout my life I've lived in, in the smaller parts of, of Texas.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And so moving to Dallas I was a little worried about the traffic, um, the
differences in terrain, because, uh, you know, Dallas is, is a lot more hilly
than it is where I, I was living.

B.18:  I see.

A.19:  And I had just bought a new car.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  And it had, uh, had st-, standard on, you know, standard --

B.22:  Oh [laughter].

A.23:  -- and I had never had a standard car before.

B.24:  You have to get used to hills [laughter].

A.25:  Right.  So I mean, I was real worried --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- about having a lot of ice and things like that.  We just had a wonderful
winter.

B.28:  Oh, that's good.

A.29:  I mean, there was one or two days of ice the entire winter.  I mean, we had
cold weather.  We had a little bit of snow here and there, but I mean, I
couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car
at the same time.  I mean, it just worked out great.

B.30:  Oh, that's good.  And what, what is, uh, what is the temperature like down
there now?

A.31:  Oh well, today it was probably in the eighties.  Um.

B.32:  Oh, that's pretty warm already.

A.33:  Well, yeah.  We've had, uh, we've had several days in the eighties.  In
fact, I'll tell you what.  Last night I came real close to turning on the air
conditioning.  I didn't do it.

B.34:  Oh, is that right?

A.35:  I didn't do it, but I came close [laughter].

B.36:  Actually last year, uh, um, about a week ago at the same time last year, um
--

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- we had hit the, actually, uh, nineties for about four days, which is
very unusual for this area --

A.39:  I would imagine, yes.

B.40:  -- at this time of year.  Um, what we're having right now is a lot of
overcast --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- you know, a lot of days with, uh, drizzle, or, uh, actually we've had a
thunderstorm.  But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds
here, and it's a very windy month.

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  Um, but right now we're in about the sixties --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- which is, is fairly comfortable.

A.47:  Well, I heard the, uh, that, um, Washington, D C has actually got the
cherry blossoms blooming, so,

B.48:  Yes, we do.  They peak on Friday [laughter].

A.49:  So that's,

B.50:  So if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere around there,
that's, that's the best time to see them, and they don't last too long,
[laughter] you know.

A.51:  Well, yeah, it's, I heard that.

B.52:  Yeah, and, uh, then after, after this month it'll quickly get, get hot, you
know, I mean, Mar-, April, May, it has a lot of rain.  Uh, May has quite a bit
of rain, and, uh, by May we're hitting in the eighties, sometimes even low
nineties.  Uh, but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and
August.  Those are our worst months.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Well that's, that's sort of what happens here, except, uh, we may start a
little earlier and end a little later, but, uh.

B.56:  Right, right.  So is everything in, uh, bloom down there now?  Is it warm
enough?  I guess all the trees are,

A.57:  [Inhaling] Yeah, they've been, they've actually been [breathing] going at
it for a good, you know, four weeks now, I would think.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  You know, in fact it's kind of funny.  Uh, you know, you're watching the
newscast, I don't know about way up they are up there --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- but the weather cast down here, one of the things that they like to do
is to tell you what's all in the air.  You know, the fungus and --

B.62:  Oh, right.

A.63:  -- the trees, you know, what the,

B.64:  Air quality index, yeah.

A.65:  Yeah, well, but mostly it's, you know, allergy type index.  And it's been
like, like I said, about four weeks now that they've had, um, multiple pages
of things and, you know, of, of names of things in the air.

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  And, uh, you know, so that's a real good sign that, that the trees are in
bloom and the flowers are in bloom --

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  -- and stuff like that.

B.70:  Is that like a pollen, sort of,

A.71:  Pollen count, yeah.  Exactly.

B.72:  Sort of a pollen count, yeah, yeah.  Well, we're just starting now.  Like I
said, the cherry blossoms are out, forsythias are out, uh, no tulips yet.  So
we're probably a few weeks behind --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- uh, you know, dow-, that area, being that south, you know.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  And, uh, that lasts, everything's in bloo-, you know, everything's green
here til about October, and then we lose it all.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  But I always wondered about the south.  I figured there couldn't be too
many months that [laughter] trees were, were bare because it's, it's hot most
of the time.

A.79:  Well, it's, it's, um, it depends on what part of the south.  I think the
farther east you go --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- you know, from, from here on east, uh, you do have a limited winter.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Um, now south of here --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- uh, like in Houston, I did, even though I said I lived mostly in the
small towns, I lived a short time in Houston.  It was winter.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  And, you know, the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties,
you know [laughter].

B.88:  I see.

A.89:  When it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter] Okay, here it's sixties, and we're celebrating.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  Okay, so there's, that's the difference. 

A.93:  Yeah, the,

B.94:  I remember being in Louisiana a few times --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- and, and it was, uh, I think it was in December one time, and it was
probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather, but in the fifties.  And I
was shocked to see people all bundled up,

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  with scarves and hats as though [laughter] it were, you know --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- in the twenties, because here in the fifties people have sweaters.  So,
you know, I guess it's what you become acclimated [laughter].

A.101:  Oh, yes, it's a big difference.

B.102:  [Laughter]  Yes.

A.103:  I have a, one of my friends is from Kansas City.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  And, uh, he has lived down here for like eleven years, but he refuses to
get to, to where everybody else is.  I mean, he will not wear long sleeve
shirts.  He will not wear, you know, jackets and things like that.

B.106:  Right.

A.107:  I mean, he's the only person I know that in thirty degree weather still has
a short sleeve shirt on, you know.

B.108:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.109:  Um, but it, you know, it's still not cold cold here --

B.110:  Yes, yes.

A.111:  -- compared to what he's used to.

B.112:  Right, right.  So, uh, yeah, I, I, I like it better here.  I'm, I'm, uh,
formerly a Pennsylvanian, and I have to say that I enjoy it much better here.
A lot more sunshine and a lot less cold, you know.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  But I don't know about ever going that far south to live.  You know, I
guess you, after a while, whatever you get used to --

A.115:  Well, I think that's true, yeah.

B.116:  -- what you enjoy.  That's right.

A.117:  Although there's, you know, there's, you don't ever want to get too much
different to wha-, I mean, uh, I grew up with a lot of trees around --

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  -- and then I lived out, like I said, in West Texas where it's desert and
there's not a lot of trees.

B.120:  Oh, right.

A.121:  And that's the main reason I moved up here, was that I did not, I mean, I
hated seeing, you know, no trees.  I mean, it's just, you could stand on a
rooftop and see for miles and miles.

B.122:  Yeah, I can understand that.  Sure, yeah.  I mean, no, I wouldn't want to,
I wouldn't want to, uh, go to a desert [laughter] type of area, either.  You
know, you get, once you're in greenery you get spoiled by that, you know.

A.123:  Well, now, that's, that's not necessarily true. 

B.124:  No?

A.125:  There are people that are born out there that can't stand it here.

B.126:  Oh, is that right?

A.127:  They, they feel claustrophobic --

B.128:  Oh, that's interesting.

A.129:  -- around trees.  I thought that was hilarious --

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  -- when I first heard it, but, I mean, I heard it from more than one
person.  So it's got to be somewhat true.

B.132:  Yeah, yeah.  So I guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces, huh
--

A.133:  Exactly.

B.134:  -- that yeah, that's, that's interesting.  So.

A.135:  Yeah, see, I wouldn't have thought from the beginning.  But I've talked to
so many people about it that it makes sense now, I guess.

B.136:  Yeah, I think I'll take the area with trees.

A.137:  I agree, I agree.

B.138:  Yeah, yeah.

A.139:  But I wouldn't mind having an area with ocean, but we won't get involved in
that,

B.140:  Right [laughter].  Why, am I too nice?

A.141:  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

B.142:  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Oh, but anyway.  Well, I, that's that's about
all, you know, I have right here on, on this area.

A.143:  Uh-huh.

B.144:  So.

A.145:  Okay.  Well.

B.146:  Okay, well, nice talking to you.

A.147:  It was nice talking to you too.

B.148:  All right.

A.149:  Bye-bye.

B.150:  Bye-bye.
