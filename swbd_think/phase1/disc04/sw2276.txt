REMARKS:        The speakers often spoke at the same time; this seemed
to happen even during the monologue section and not all words could be
understood.

===========================================================================

@A.1:  Where do you get most of your current events?

B.2:  Oh, well, when the war was on I was watching the T V a lot --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- but, um, [sniffing] I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed
down.

A.5:  Yeah, yeah, I was, I was, uh, we don't have cable, so we were watching C N
N a lot, and then --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- trying to switch, thank goodness for remote control.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  We were switching from one station to another, and in between keeping the
radio on.

B.10:  Yeah, C N N coverage was really good.

A.11:  It was extraordinary, yeah --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- we, um, um, and then, you know, couldn't wait for the newspaper.
Reminded me of when I was younger, the, uh, the time of Watergate, and just
couldn't get enough of it.

B.14:  Yeah --

A.15:  But,

B.16:  -- kind of get wrapped up in it.

A.17:  Yeah, um, I, it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V
late into the evening.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  And you just wanted to get the latest news, what was happening --

B.20:  Kind of like watching the Olympics.

A.21:  -- Huh?

B.22:  Kind of like watching the Olympics.

A.23:  Yeah, yeah, you just couldn't, you couldn't put it do-, you couldn't put it
down.

B.24:  Yeah, after a while, though, it started getting a little repetitive.

A.25:  It did, yeah.

B.26:  It ran out of news (( )),

A.27:  It was like, you know,

B.28:  [Sniffing].

A.29:  that, what was it, two steps forward, one step back --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- and, uh, but occasionally, you know, you'd stay in tune just long enough
to get the latest different tidbit --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- or a different angle --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- and, uh, you really became addicted to it for a while.

B.36:  Do you, uh, normally read the newspaper every day?

A.37:  I try to, um, the newspaper comes, uh, in the morning, and I leave for --

B.38:  The what, the POST?

A.39:  -- work at seven,  huh, yeah, yeah,

B.40:  (( )) newspaper,

A.41:  And I usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And at that point I try-, at least try to get through most, most the front
section and maybe, you know --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- one or two other sections.

B.46:  I don't, I don't regularly watch news or a newspaper.  I would say I get
probably most of it from my friends, you know, they finally told me, Hey,
there's a war going on.  Oh, okay [laughter].

A.47:  Where do-, what, what newspaper do you get, uh, there?

B.48:  Uh, just the Raleigh local paper.

A.49:  How does it, how does it compare, can you com-, like how does it compare to
the POST?

B.50:  Uh, it's, it's, it's not even a comparison [laughter].

A.51:  Yeah, that's funny, because every once in a while if my husband and I have
traveled or something, um, and we pick up a local paper, we're really shocked,
even in a major city --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- at how local it is.  

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  It's really provincial.

B.56:  The News is the same way.  The local news here is kind of lousy.

A.57:  Is it really?  I mean,

B.58:  It's not much different than when I lived in Roanoke, Virginia, which is
really small town.

A.59:  That's, that's maybe because we get so, you know, we're so jaded with the
post, uh --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- which is really international, and, and I keeps reminding me, you know,
that this, we're, we're really in an, in an isol-, different situation here,
and I keep saying, no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in
the country vote the way they do --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- I mean, but, uh,

B.64:  That explains it.

A.65:  I probably do watch more T V because I get home, and in between say,
cooking dinner or something --

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  -- if I can catch a five or six o'clock news --

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  -- I watch that usually, uh, before we settle down --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- uh, depending what time we get to bed, we'll usually watch the ten or
the eleven o'clock news.

B.72:  Um.

A.73:  We have a ten o'clock news here at night, and that's ideal --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- because by ten thirty I start to fade.

B.76:  [Laughter].  

A.77:  So, uh.

B.78:  I'm in graduate school, so I have a really weird schedule, and --

A.79:  What are you studying?

B.80:  -- I don't know, I really don't have time for T V and newspaper, just --

A.81:  Yeah, I remember when I was in school.

B.82:  -- I wouldn't have time to read it, so, I'm --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most, uh,
time effective.

A.85:  Yeah, yeah.  No, I can remember way back, back in those days when I was in
school, the, I think the only time we only really watched the news, and this
tells you how old I was, was during the Cuban missile crisis.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Uh, I, we could just, we were all centered around that television.

B.88:  What's neat is seeing history happen, you know.

A.89:  That's exactly right (( )).

B.90:  I guess that's it.

A.91:  Yeah, although I do worry that, how easy this one was might be a bad lesson
--

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- uh, to, to the younger people, um, you know, than there is the other
generation,

B.94:  Um, (( )) in North Carolina, there was a lot, lot of service men from here,
you know, and --

A.95:  Oh, that's true, yeah,

B.96:  -- People really (( )) it, saw it first hand,

A.97:  That was probably the best part of the news, was the, uh, some of the
pers-, human interest stories.

B.98:  Yeah, some of it got a little, I, I don't know, I thought it was a little
too personal.  That they were digging each life --

A.99:  Yeah, yeah.

B.100:  -- little too much, maybe.

A.101:  Does it, does it bother you that, uh, at this point in your life that
you're not getting more direct news or,

B.102:  [Sniffing]  Uh, no, not really.

A.103:  What are you studying?

B.104:  I'm in computer science.

A.105:  Okay, yeah.  Um, I guess,

B.106:  I see it as information age [laughter].

A.107:  How old are you?

B.108:  I'm twenty-five.

A.109:  Okay, then I'm, see I'm about twenty years older.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  I really do, I do rely, I do miss it, I do rely on the news, and, uh, I, I
guess I regret I don't get enough loc-, really local.  We get some local
papers --

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  -- but I guess I'm more interested in the national or international news.

B.114:  It's almost getting to the point where there is, there's too much that --

A.115:  Over-, news overload,

B.116:  -- yeah, you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff, I mean, I don't
know.

A.117:  Yeah, but,

B.118:  It's a little near sighted, but, uh.

A.119:  Well, it's har-, I'll, I'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote.
I mean, there are so many issues and there're so many people running --

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  -- that you know, unless you have some way of evaluating it --

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  -- and I guess the news does help.  Well, it was really nice talking,
talking to you.  Okay,

B.124:  Okay, did it work out your first time all right?

A.125:  I hope so.

B.126:  Okay.

A.127:  Take care.

B.128:  Bye-bye.

A.129:  Bye-bye.
