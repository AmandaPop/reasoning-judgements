======================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I guess being here in Dallas, are you familiar with the Rangers?

B.2:  Uh, somewhat.  

A.3:  Okay.  

B.4:  They're not my favorite team.  

A.5:  [Laughter].  

B.6:  I am, uh, somewhat familiar with them.  

A.7:  I see.  What team do you follow?  

B.8:  I follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly.  

A.9:  I see.  

B.10:  Basically, be-, because that's where I came from and, uh, grew up following
them as a kid.

A.11:  Okay, okay.  That's interesting.  I guess really, though, I'm a native
Texan so that, really about the only team I've ever, uh, followed has been the
Rangers.

B.12:  Okay.  

A.13:  And, uh, uh, what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year?

B.14:  Well, uh, [laughter] I don't think they're going to challenge for the lead
in the east.

A.15:  Is that right?  

B.16:  Uh, they, they've got a lot of, uh, rebuilding to do.  They traded for a
lot of new players, uh, in the off season and it looks like it might help
them, but, uh, I think this is going to be a year for pulling together --

A.17:  Sort of a building seas-, season.  

B.18:  -- and looking for the future.  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.19:  Yeah.  Shoot, the Rangers, I don't know what the, there's no telling what
they'll do.  They'll play, uh, they won't do anything until the all star break
and then, uh, then they'll pick up a little bit and that seems to be their,
uh, their average pace.  But,

B.20:  Well, there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia.

A.21:  Yeah, uh, I heard that, but I heard on, uh, uh, the radio this morning
that, that, uh, you know, old Bobby Valentine said that there was no, no, uh,
truth to that, but you never can tell.

B.22:  [Laughter] Okay.  They might just be fishing to see what they can get for
him.

A.23:  That's right.  And, I don't know, personally I'd like to get rid of him.  I
think he's sort of a showboat and --

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  -- really hadn't produced, you know, a whole lot.  But, uh, 

B.26:  Yeah, I agree.  They're paying him too much money and, uh, f-, for the kind
of money they're paying him right now, I think it's one point six million
dollars --

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  -- they can get a pretty good quality outfielder.  

A.29:  Yeah.  Then, they're going to have to spend some money and, I think, build
up their pitching staff.  Uh,

B.30:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch.  

A.31:  Yeah --

B.32:  But, uh,

A.33:  -- it would be interesting to see how he does this year.  

B.34:  I think the rest of the staff is, uh, a little weak.  

A.35:  Yeah, I heard, uh, just I guess last night they got beat.  Uh, and Bobby
Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be, uh, you know, their, their hot
guy.

B.36:  Right.  

A.37:  And, uh, sounded like he got pounded pretty hard.  

B.38:  He's hot and cold.  

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  He'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled.

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  So [laughter],

A.43:  And, and that's really what the Rangers need some, some consistency, you
know, outer starter and, uh, uh, I don't know, it's going to be interesting.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  Uh, my, at work, my boss got season tickets this year so, uh, hopefully if
I'm real nice to him he's going, 

B.46:  [Laughter].  

A.47:  throw a couple of those my way -- 

B.48:  I see.  

A.49:  -- every now and then, so it will be fun to go out there and watch them.

B.50:  I guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season.

A.51:  That's what they said --

B.52:  He claims to be out there to play ball.

A.53:  -- that, uh, he really worked out, you know, hard in, uh, off season and,
uh, maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year.

B.54:  Yeah, they say he's really been hustling.  

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  Ever-,

A.57:  God he need to, I mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes
around to, to hitting the baseball --

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- but, uh, I mean, you got to be a total player when you're in the pros.

B.60:  Well, I felt a little guilty but not much when, uh, Robin Yount won the M V
P instead of Sierra.

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  The other year.  

A.63:  Yeah, but, I don't know. 

B.64:  But, uh, Yount has been a, he's a player, uh, year in, year out and always,
uh, is leading the team in, uh, most of, most of their offensive categories.

A.65:  Is that right.  

B.66:  He really is a team player.  

A.67:  Well, that's what it takes -- 

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  -- to, uh, because, uh,

B.70:  Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet.  

A.71:  Right, to, to actually be a leader, uh, a team leader and, uh, you know the
Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that, uh, I think the
other players look up to.  Because Incaviglia I don't think, you know, uh, he
stands out to be a, a real leader.

B.72:  Yeah, and he hasn't really shown the, the talent, uh, or the promise that
they saw when he was at Oklahoma State.

A.73:  Right.  Right.  Sounds like they have a young guy, that they're putting a
lot of weight into.  Uh, that Juan --

B.74:  Juan Gonzalez.  

A.75:  -- Gonzalez, yeah.  

B.76:  Yeah, he looks to be a, a up and coming, uh, performer.  

A.77:  Yeah, so it will be interesting to see, you know, I think and make him
progress and, uh, get him on board.

B.78:  Well, given the Rangers' history, they'll probably trade him [laughter].
And then he'll,

A.79:  [Laughter] And then he'll become an all star.  

B.80:  Right, somewhere else.  

A.81:  [Laughter] That's right.  

B.82:  That, that seems to be the way the Rangers operate.  

A.83:  That's exactly right.  But, uh, well, I'll tell you what it will be
interesting to, to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns
out.

B.84:  How do you think Oakland's going to do?  

A.85:  I don't know, I tell you what they've, uh, they've got a big enough
payroll.  They need to, uh, uh --

B.86:  For what they're -- 

A.87:  -- go back.  

B.88:  -- paying, they ought to get, they ought to get the performance out of
those guys, uh,

A.89:  That's exactly right.  

B.90:  Canseco's making five million a year.  

A.91:  Yeah, and I, I just don't see, uh, you know, a baseball player being worth
that.

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  Or any, really any po-, pro athlete because we look at that compared to
what, uh, normal people make I mean it's just totally outrageous.

B.94:  Yeah, I, I agree.  

A.95:  And, uh,

B.96:  I think it is, and when, when the players themselves are turning down
contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million
dollars a year --

A.97:  Yeah, that, that's -- 

B.98:  -- looking for more money yet.  

A.99:  -- what ticks me off about old, uh, Henderson, you know, wanting to rene-,
renegotiate his contract because, uh, uh, he's not the highest paid player
anymore.

B.100:  Sure.  

A.101:  Well, man, that's, that's just ridiculous.  

B.102:  Well, it's, it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity
contest between sports --

A.103:  Right.  

B.104:  -- to see who can get the biggest, uh, paycheck.  

A.105:  Exactly, and -- 

B.106:  Because baseball,

A.107:  -- you know, ultimately the, the consumer and the, uh, fan are the people
that have to pay for it.

B.108:  That's true.  

A.109:  Through the,

B.110:  They keep raising the ticket prices every year.  

A.111:  Right, and through advertisements, you know, on T V, uh, because a T V
contract is really where they rake in the money and,

B.112:  Yeah, and with what those guys get paid then they go out, uh, besides
baseball and, and advertise products, or they, they charge ten or fifteen
dollars for a autograph.

A.113:  Right.  

B.114:  [Laughter]. 

A.115:  That's right.  

B.116:  They've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't making
enough already as, uh, stars of the sport.

A.117:  Exactly.  And, uh, you know, so, I, I don't know personally, uh, you know,
I'll pay, keep paying whatever the ticket prices are, but and, uh, it really
does irk me to see those guys out there, uh, you know, making that much 
money --

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  -- and, uh, and then the, the public, you know, just continues to, you
know, help support and funnel the funds into, uh, to make it happen, whatever
it costs.

B.120:  Sure.  Yeah, I might get to maybe one game out of the year, uh, in 
person --

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  -- uh, but, uh, having cable T V and H S E [laughter].  

A.123:  Well, that's right, you can get your, your fill just about.  

B.124:  Yeah, I'll watch quite a few games on T V.  

A.125:  Right.  

B.126:  Especially to somebody like Nolan pitch.  

A.127:  Right, right.  So, uh,

B.128:  Brewers always have such hard luck.  Teddy Higuera is hurt again.

A.129:  Oh, really.  

B.130:  He was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando
Valenzuela --

A.131:  Oh, yeah.  

B.132:  -- and, uh, he had a torn rotator cup.  

A.133:  Oh, jeez.  

B.134:  So, he's out for at least, uh, oh, I don't know how many weeks or months
they said.

A.135:  Golly.  

B.136:  But, he may not pitch this season, again.  

A.137:  Oh, man that's ridiculous.  

B.138:  But he's the star of that, uh, team.  Their pitching staff and when he sits
out, they fizzle.

A.139:  [Laughter]. 

B.140:  That seems typical because most of their other stars, uh, Paul Molitor's
usually out half the season with injuries himself.

A.141:  Oh, man, that makes it tough on the, the whole club.  The management all
the way down the rest of the players.

B.142:  Yeah, they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit, uh, more
inexperienced players into those roles --

A.143:  Yeah.  

B.144:  -- and they just don't have the leadership, don't have the skills to carry
a team.

A.145:  Right, right.  Well, it will be interesting.  

B.146:  Well, I think it will be fun.  I'm ready for baseball season to start.

A.147:  I sort of am, too.  Uh, I enjoy going out to a couple of the games and,
and, uh, [door] I really don't get that involved until the playoffs, though.
Uh,

B.148:  Yeah, I agree with that.  

A.149:  You know, the season's just so long.  

B.150:  Right, well the pre-season really doesn't mean anything either.

A.151:  Right.  

B.152:  Because the play-, the teams, uh, usually play in split squads and they're
either playing their rookies or their, uh,

A.153:  That's right.

B.154:  Uh,

A.155:  Depending on what night it is and where they're at.  

B.156:  Yeah.  

A.157:  Uh, on whose playing.  And, uh,

B.158:  So, once the season gets underway, you know they're out there to be serious
about what they're doing, trying to win games --

A.159:  Right.  

B.160:  -- and, uh, [laughter] I take it from there.  

A.161:  Right, right.  Well, I tell you what, I appreciate the conversation and,
uh, we'll just have to watch and see how it goes, comes about.

B.162:  Okay, well, good luck to the Rangers this season [laughter]. 

A.163:  All righty.  W-,

B.164:  See if they can pull one out.  

A.165:  We'll talk to you later.  

B.166:  All right, sure. 

A.167:  Bye-bye.  

B.168:  Thanks, bye.
