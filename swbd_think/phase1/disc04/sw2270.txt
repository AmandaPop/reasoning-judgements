REMARKS:        Speaker B was hard to understand at times; he spoke very
quickly and ran words together.

=============================================================================

A.1:  [Beep] Okay, I guess that's it.  

B.2:  Yeah.  

A.3:  Uh, I was just thinking about what movies I've seen lately.  Mostly, uh,
[throat_clearing] we go to, uh, the second or third run movies I guess what,
the ones that we call the dol-, used to call the dollar movies.

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  Uh, so we see, uh, the ones that have been out for a while.  I was trying
to think what the last movie that we went to see was, probably RUSSIA HOUSE
with, uh, Sean Connery.

B.6:  Yeah, yeah, sure.  

A.7:  And, uh, found it quite enjoyable myself.  Uh, uh, had also seen the HUNT
FOR RED OCTOBER, you know, with him in that.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  God, I don't have to say.  Kind of caught me off, I'm more of a,
[breathing] looks good in the paper, commercials look great on TV --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- uh, I did see RED OCTOBER.  

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  [Laughter] Uh, this is going to be, I've seen a lot of video, lot of, lot
of video, V C R stuff.

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  Uh, man, oh, man I have to say, uh, Chevy Chase, uh, CHRISTMAS, you know,
the VACATION, CHRISTMAS --

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- thing was one here recently we saw.  At Christmas time, uh, God I
haven't been in a movie since [laughter],

A.17:  [Laughter]  Well that's,  

B.18:  Maybe, SUPERMAN, BATMAN --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- maybe BATMAN might have been one.  

A.21:  Yeah, w-, well, I didn't even see BATMAN so that's, uh, that's pretty good.

B.22:  It's been,

A.23:  Or, no, let's see, uh, DICK TRACY I did, we did see DICK TRACY, so that's,

B.24:  I haven't seen any of that stuff.  

A.25:  Yeah.  Uh, so you, so then you're not a, uh, uh, not a frequent movie goer
either.

B.26:  Well, I love it.  We, uh, got a new baby in the house -- 

A.27:  Oh, yeah.  

B.28:  -- and, and, and she just turned a year old, so it just kind of put the --

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- clamp on things.  Uh, 

A.31:  So you watch a lot of videos.  

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  Then, uh,

B.34:  Stop by and get them at, you know, for ninety-nine cents, and bring them
home but, 

A.35:  Yeah, that's right.  What, uh, what do you find, uh, that you're looking at
most in those.  Uh, the, I mean are they, are they the comedies and, uh, that
kind of stuff.

B.36:  Comedies and the P G -'s and the no skin -- 

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- uh, we're, uh, know, like we saw SALLY, and, uh, well Billy Crystals in
it --

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  -- we saw that one and --

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  -- which was video.  That's, that's probably the last movie I went to see.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  We s-,

B.44:  Yeah, that's probably the last one.  

A.45:  We saw that one, uh, we find that, uh, that, uh, if you can get into those
dollar movies, you know, uh, they're a dollar and a h-, what is it, dollar and
a quarter --

B.46:  Quarter.

A.47:  -- dollar and a half now -- 

B.48:  Promenade, yeah.  

A.49:  -- and, uh, at the Promenade, yeah, and, uh, you know, we, we find those
pretty good.  They're not, uh, it's not so far, you know, from when they were
first run --

B.50:  Sure.  

A.51:  -- that you don't enjoy them.  Occasionally you'll find one that's, you
know, some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that
you'd seen them so you could talk about them sooner, but, uh,

B.52:  I mean, fifteen bucks to go see a movie with -- 

A.53:  Yeah that's -- 

B.54:  -- with t-, with a couple's a little ridiculous.  

A.55:  -- that's a little bit too much, so,

B.56:  Yeah.  And some of them that turned to flops, we saw other, other, other
night we saw, uh, LADY IN RED --

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- okay, which is not that old but, you know --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- it was bounced around --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- the V C R cabinet there and, uh, [lipsmack] but, yeah, we, I used to,
really, you know, I'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple, you
know, three or four movies a month --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- but no, we haven't, I haven't been to a movie in, it's been four or five
months.

A.65:  Yeah, we, we find even, uh, you know, even looking at the dollar movies
which are, you'd think those are the ones that, uh, are coming back around
because they were good the first time --

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  -- and we don't find a lot of those, uh, you know, they'll be running, uh,
four to six of those on a weekend --

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  -- and, you know, two weekends, three weekends out of four maybe, two or
th-, two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we
want to go see --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- and, uh, so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while
so we, we still get a chance to see, you know, one of them that we want to
see.

B.72:  [Laughter].  

A.73:  But, uh, we saw AVALON -- 

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  -- and, uh, I think we went in to see AVALON because we couldn't get in to,
maybe we wanted to go see GHOST --

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- and couldn't get into GHOST because the line, you know, they sold out --

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  -- we went to see AVALON, and, uh, I really was not that impressed with
AVALON.

B.80:  Really?  

A.81:  It, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's one of these, uh, more, I don't know,
melodramatic and, and, I don't know, uh, not satirical, wasn't funny at all,
but it was --

B.82:  Kind of drab. 

A.83:  -- I don't know, had a, had a lot of hidden meanings in it I suppose, but,
uh,

B.84:  Yeah --

A.85:  You know.

B.86:  -- it's got to be something fun -- 

A.87:  Yeah, and, uh,

B.88:  -- you don't have to think, yeah, sure.  

A.89:  Right.  But, I really enjoy, uh, the espionage type, uh, movies, the --

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  -- the, uh, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and RUSSIA HOUSE, I had read, uh, the
RUSSIA HOUSE book --

B.92:  Is it a good movie?  

A.93:  -- before so I, I, I thought it was a real good movie.  

B.94:  Great.  

A.95:  Uh, I enjoyed the book quite a bit, too, so that's, that made it, made it
more interesting to me.

B.96:  Let's see {faint}.

A.97:  Uh, a lot of it, the dialogue was, uh, a little difficult to understand
because, uh, Michelle Pfeiffer, had a, was speaking with her Russian accent,
you know, the, the actress Russian accents, so --

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- it was, part of that was a little hard to understand.  

B.100:  Probably overcompensated a little bit.  

A.101:  Right.  And, uh, so if you knew what was going on, you could kind of
anticipate what was going to be said so I, I had a little bit advantage there
over my wife.  She had not read the book.

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  But, uh,

B.104:  [Lipsmack] I think the, now it's all coming back to me.  What was the one,
not THE DEEP, but THE ABYSS --

A.105:  Uh, yeah.  

B.106:  -- last year --

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  -- I think [talking].  

A.109:  We didn't see that one.  I'm not, uh, I don't see, don't go see too many
in, well, I would, but my wife doesn't like the, the, uh, the science fiction,
semi-horror type stuff, you know.

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  Things that, uh, get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for
her.

B.112:  Yeah, I'm not much of a ROTOCOP man, ROBOCOP -- 

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  -- you know, myself.  This one, it wasn't heavy hi-sci, you know, hi-fi,
because it was, a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had, of
course, the breathing apparatus which was liquid and, and then all a sudden,
you know, when you actually met this thing and, and that, that was, you know,
towards like the last third of the movie --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- only really got strange.  But it was, uh, you know, it was cold in the
theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just, it was, it was
comfortable.  It was easy to go in, you didn't have to think a lot, and, and,
uh,

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  you know, there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you
have to follow a hidden plot --

A.119:  Yeah.  

B.120:  -- and it, and then you leave the movie, like, with your brain, you got a
headache [laughter] --

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  -- trying to follow this damn movie.  

A.123:  Well, it's, it's bad enough that, you know, if you got a little back
problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around
--

B.124:  Yep.

A.125:  -- and usually come out with your back hurting anyway.  

B.126:  Specially those intermission movies, yep.  

A.127:  Right.  

B.128:  Course, those, those do-, dollar and quarter movies you might catch a
spring, too, [laughter] so you --

A.129:  Yeah.  That's right.  

B.130:  -- got to be careful [laughter]. Great.

A.131:  Well, anyway, I guess if, uh, if you're don't have anything else to talk
about, I guess I, we can hang up on this one.

B.132:  Okay.  

A.133:  Okay I appreciate it.  Thanks.

B.134:  Thank you, sir.  

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  Bye.
