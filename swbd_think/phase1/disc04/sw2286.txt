========================================================================

A.1:  Anyway, uh, uh,

B.2:  Do you work for a large corpo-, corporation?

A.3:  Well I did.  Uh, and I'm currently, uh, consulting now so I'm with this,
you know, a smaller organization, um, so my benefits are pretty basic.  Uh,
medical, I don't get any profit sharing and stuff like that so,

B.4:  I, uh, I work with a medium size company and we don't have profit sharing
but I would enjoy it since we, uh, it's a service based organization so --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- it would be nice, but.

A.7:  Yeah, what, uh, the current climate is, I saw a little flyer and, uh, I
thought it was interesting, uh, is they are now offering, you know, flexible
benefits where you have more control and allocate.  Uh, like you can, uh, pay
for, uh, vacation time.  If you want to take more vacation you can just buy
them out or something like that so I can, can do other things and, uh --

B.8:  That would be nice.

A.9:  -- they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can
manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits.
So it sounds like they're going to get ver-, more flexible to meet individual
needs which I think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite
a few different #objectives.#

B.10:  #Well people# with families have different objectives than single people --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- or,

A.13:  Are you single?

B.14:  No.  No, I've got a family, two children.

A.15:  Okay, uh.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  But,

B.18:  Do you have children?

A.19:  No I, I'm, uh, #single.#

B.20:  #Are you single?#

A.21:  Right.  Never been married.

B.22:  [Laughter] You are?

A.23:  No, I said I've never been married.

B.24:  Oh, you never have?

A.25:  I'm only twenty-six.

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  That's,

A.27:  So #I've still got a few years.#

B.28:  #A whole lot of time for that.#

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  I had already been married and had one child by that time, but, uh, we, uh,
we've just kind of started young in life [laughter].  But, uh, uh, we, uh, my
husband's still with the same company for ten years and as a result, it has
worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package but, uh, it's, uh, it's
nice to be with a big company for that reason I guess.

A.31:  So what are the most important benefits to you? 

B.32:  Oh, the hospitalization, uh, is (( )) the hospitalization medical care
benefits is what we like the best, uh, because it's a good (( )) program, it's
you know, just eighty percent and then, uh, the deductible's reasonable, I
think it's three fifty a year for the family.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Whereas, with my company, they pay fifty percent and the deductible's, I
think, five hundred a year and it costs a lot more, I'm with a smaller company
though, so.

A.35:  The, but the medical stuff itself, the, the health plan you're with, (( ))
it only covers fifty percent?

B.36:  That's right.

A.37:  Ouch.

B.38:  [Laughter].  

A.39:  That's the worst I've ever heard.

B.40:  Yeah, it's not very #good.#

A.41:  #It's usually# the eight-,  basic eighty twenty --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- besides your initial deductible, that's what varies the most I guess.

B.44:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.45:  Uh,

B.46:  Or you can go with a H M O, you know, Health Maintenance Organization where
you pay a certain amount a month and then five dollars every time that you go
in or #two dollars.#

A.47:  #Yeah. Co-payments# type stuff.

B.48:  Yeah, co-payments, that's what they are.

A.49:  Yeah.  Well I think uh, obviously, I think the, the medical is the most
expensive or it's the most important coverage --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- uh, of the, you know, you may not even go in to the doctor for a long
time but, you know, if something came up obviously, to get covered is
important.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  ((Well if)) we, one of our children is just, just turned two and
her first eighteen months of life [laughter] God, well she had one operation,
she's been to the emergency room a couple of times, I mean, [laughter] she's
just expensive.  The other one wasn't nearly that expensive.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  But the, but the baby just one of those kind of sickly kids that has a lot
of accidents [laughter].

A.55:  Uh-huh.  How about any matching programs?  Have you ever, you know what I
mean?

B.56:  No.

A.57:  Where they con-, con-, contribute --

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  -- like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a Four O
One K?

B.60:  Yeah, yeah, my husband's got that available.

A.61:  Is it, is it --

B.62:  That's great.

A.63:  -- is it a hundred percent, or is it fifty percent,

B.64:  [Breathing] I think it's fifty percent --

A.65:  Okay,

B.66:  -- up to four percent.  Or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent,

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  I'm not exactly sure.  

A.69:  But that's a nice, I think that's an important benefit.  

B.70:  Yeah, that's great.

A.71:  Uh, I don't get that option.  I, I, I was at a company that had that, and I
didn't make enough to be able to put anything in it.  So I had to leave
[laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  So, but, uh,

B.74:  It's nice, we, uh, we do a lot of our savings in that manner, and then the
rest of it through a universal life policy, which is money that you can touch,
but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get
in C D -s,

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  And gets, life, it's a term life policy also --

A.77:  With an annuity, yeah,

B.78:  -- yeah, yeah, yeah that's what it is.  You know about insurance.

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  I didn't know anything about insurance until I had children.

A.81:  The only reason I know a little bit about that is when I was in school
still --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- I was down in Florida working, and, uh, dur-, during the summer.
Somewhere I got a hold of, involved in a marketing organization that marketed,
uh, replacing those whole life policies, which aren't very good insurance
policies.  People are losing, you know, they --

B.84:  Really,

A.85:  -- losing money or not doing as well as they could, and uh, the whole
organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life
with annu-, an annuity, and, uh, they would, you know, analyze a person's
current policy and get a computerized, you know, statement of, of what would
happen, you know, at this age, this age, this age, you know --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- what your benefits would be, and, uh, the difference between, you know,
the term life with annuity and the whole life, was, you know, there's fairly
big dis-, discrepancies, you know, so they could try to replace those.  So I
got involved, uh, on that end, and picked it up, but I never did tell anyone
back at school, and I never, I never, uh, did anything with it, but, uh, so I
know a little about, right now I just do a little basic life thing on my
benefits, but you know, I don't know, what I get out, maybe twenty thou-, or
something, just to cover me, and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out
that I know, you know,

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  some family, that, but, uh, I'm not worried about that.  I don't have
anybody to,

B.90:  Until you get your dependents,

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  it just doesn't matter.

A.93:  I like the idea of having that chunk of money to help anybody cover my end,
you know.

B.94:  Yeah, right.

A.95:  You don't want to be a burden to anybody else.

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  And, uh, 

B.98:  But, as far as --

A.99:  So, I think,

B.100:  -- being able to really leave anything,

A.101:  Yeah, I mean, I'm not looking to leave anything, there may be a certain
amount, and, you know, that's fine, but, uh, you know, to get that coverage
and know that I'll get, you know, uh, you know, flown to wherever I need, you
know, already, I need to go, I guess I haven't made any decisions like that.
I guess, you know, my family and father would do that, but, uh, see I've,
I've,

B.102:  Where are your fam-,

A.103:  kind of moved around from my home originally.

B.104:  Oh.

A.105:  And, um, and, my family's out in Florida now, most of my family, and I'm
out here in Phoenix,

B.106:  [Laughter].

A.107:  so, but, uh, anyway, as far as benefits, um, what else is important, uh,
obviously I think, uh profit sharing is, is, uh, is, a, important benefit.

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  Especially in the long run, for the long term.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  Um, 

B.112:  I've, my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing, but my
company doesn't, and I'd really like it if my company did [laughter].  They
turn quite a profit, at times, but, it's not part of, uh, what's available.

A.113:  Yeah, smaller companies, it's either the smaller company you're, you're,
you're in, into the, consulting side and they'll, you'll finish up a project
and you'll get the little bonus.  That type of thing.

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  Um, I guess you could technically consider that profit sharing.  Um, but
uh, most, you know, most medium or small probably don't do that much profit
sharing, and while I was at this other corporation they never had any profit,
so.

B.116:  [Laughter] It didn't help any to share.

A.117:  Yeah, [laughter] they couldn't share any.  And I guess they had a little
bit one year, but I wasn't qualified for my first year, something, you know --

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  -- have to, so.

B.120:  So.  Have you been, just been out of school, what,

A.121:  Little over three years now.

B.122:  I guess, four years.  Yeah, yeah.  It, uh, quite a different world isn't
it [laughter].

A.123:  Versus what.

B.124:  Versus life before real world, life in,
