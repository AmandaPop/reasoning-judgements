REMARKS:        A little echo on Speaker B in the joint conversation.
He was also very hard to understand in several places.  I couldn't make
out what he was saying.

========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East?

B.2:  I don't think we have any choice.  

A.3:  Oh, I don't think we did really either.  

B.4:  As long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam.

A.5:  Well, that's, that's true, yeah.  

B.6:  Except jack around with it.  

A.7:  The, uh, the, the biggest difference, I got to agree, was the idea that we
were allowed to go and get it done rather than, than set up a, a line and say
we're not going to let you cross this, this point anymore, and that really
hurt the, uh, the peop-, uh, the Vietnam experience, uh, I got to admit that
one.

B.8:  I think, uh, basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has
made the, made the stand is what we'll have to continue to, uh, stickup for
our foreign policy.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  If we don't, then what's going to happen is that ((everybody, well)), it's
just a onetime shot, they're not going to do anything.

A.11:  Well, do you think that, um, by, uh, going over there and doing what we did
that, uh, it's going to give us a chance for peace over there?

B.12:  I don't think there's ever going to be peace in, in the Middle East.

A.13:  Yeah.  That kind of,

B.14:  Mostly it, it just, that, that region never had, had peace,

A.15:  Well that's,

B.16:  even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful. 

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  You know, the Arabs just don't like the Jews, and the Jews don't like the
Arabs, and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs.

A.19:  But is, I mean, is that any different than, uh, the way it is in even our
country, I mean, uh, back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like
the whites, the whites didn't like the blacks, but we're getting to the point
where we get along pretty good.  I mean, isn't it logical that just any of
the, that you can solve differences like that?

B.20:  No, because you, I, I don't think the Mideast has the educational
background.  I, I don't think they're later,

A.21:  So you,

B.22:  they're rate of literacy is so low,  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  that they're still, they still have a trouble mentality.  

A.25:  So, you think it comes down to education or, or something like that.

B.26:  Well, well, you don't find many intelligent people starting wars.

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  You know.

A.29:  I suppose that's probably true.  

B.30:  You know, uh, basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight
one,

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  uh, because they've already been there.  All you have to do is go fight
one and find out it's not much fun.

A.33:  No.

B.34:  I've spent, uh, over twenty-eight months in Vietnam.  

A.35:  Oh.  

B.36:  So, and ((I mean)), it's not, it's not a lot of fun.  

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  Uh, it's, as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty-eight
years ago, you know.

A.39:  Yeah, because, 

B.40:  But, uh,

A.41:  yeah, I guess the, uh, you kind of think about the good things and not
about the bad.

B.42:  And you forget some of the smells and stuff, 

A.43:  Uh-huh.   

B.44:  like that.  But I think, you know, ((probably the, probably)) the Middle
East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  not only the Mideast but also in, in the what they call the emergency
((African nations)) the third world.

A.47:  Right, right.  

B.48:  Uh, [throat_clearing] As soon as one tribe gets the power, they just knock
off they're old ancestral enemies.  And it's pretty, you know, it's pretty
much that way over the Mideast.  And you have the Palestinian question and
there hasn't been a ((Palestine)) over there for, God, since, you know, two
hundred years, three hundred years before Christ was born.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  And but, but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork,
going, oh, yes, we want a Palestine nation, but there hasn't been one for, you
know, well over two thousand years.  But you have this troubled mentality,
they all, you know, like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever.

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  But it's basically all, all based on the, a, a tribal network.

A.53:  Well, isn't it also though based on religion?  I mean, isn't that a, a real
powerful,

B.54:  ((Out of some)) degree, yeah.  To some degree but, uh, religion is a factor
over there, but, uh, I think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  Well, d-, don't you think though that, uh, because of religion it
just enhances the differences, uh, of the tribes and makes it so that it's
that much harder to get along?

B.56:  Well, they have the same problem we do, yeah, I mean, you know, everybody,
there's Christianity and then you, then we have subdivided Baptists and
Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  and stuff.  It's basically all the same, uh, but, but the Muslims are not
as liberal in their interpretation of, of the (( )) as we are in our
interpretation of the Bible.

A.59:  Right, right.  

B.60:  And you get the more, the more, I guess you call the more militant (( )) of
the Shiites who, you know, if you're not a Muslim, and, and you don't ad-,
adhere strictly to it, then you're nothing.  And you're just, you're, you're
just getting lip service much like, uh, the Ayatollah Khomeini.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  He's a, he's a prime example.  Oh, I'd, ((I, I will, but)) seriously doubt
that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war
infections that are, they can't even agree on which facet of, of, uh, Muslim
they want to follow.

A.63:  [Laughter] That's true.  Well, since there's not going to be peace over
there, don't you think like getting involved as we have that that's going to
mean that we're going to be involved from now on, and so any war that breaks
out, we're going to have to be in the middle of it.

B.64:  Well, we ((only)), we have two choices.  We can be involved or not
involved.  If we're not involved, then we're going to be sitting over here
freezing in the dark.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  Uh, we probably could, with ultimate fuel supplies and, uh, some relaxation
of our own, uh, policies here survive, but we're not going to do that.

A.67:  It doesn't seem that way, does it?  

B.68:  No, there's, there hasn't been any ((real)), you know, ((alternating))
energy sit-, situations or sources played out.  Nobody wants to do it.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  Somebody has to make the hard decision, and whoever does that will be a
one term president.

A.71:  [Laughter] Yeah, I know.   

B.72:  Yeah.  It's kind of like, uh, Texas income tax whoever, you know, whoever
puts that up is going to service one term, that's going to be it because your
going to be gone. ((They may pass)), uh, state income taxes ((that will be the
last thing they do)).

A.73:  Yeah, that's probably true.  

B.74:  And then nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions, 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  (( )) has to do is basically what we're doing now is pick some of the
moderate, uh, Arabs or, you know, Muslims that is were, and, uh, support them.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Because they're, because they will have more, uh, encounter with this as
far as the educational and sociological economic background does.

A.79:  Huh.  

B.80:  If you look over there you're not going to, you don't see any Arabs
driving, uh, racing cars.  They want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns.

A.81:  True.  They want the, the gas guzzlers ((and)),  

B.82:  Yeah, so, you know, who's, who produces those?  The U S  produces those.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  And I think after the war, no, that we're not going to see a bunch of the
Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten
blown out of the sky,

A.85:  ((Didn't)) it though?  

B.86:  or off the ground.

A.87:  Yeah, I got to agree with you there.  I think that does get a lot, a lot of
good there.

B.88:  And, uh, we, we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  And where did they get the, where, where does the ((expertise)) come for
for bringing a whole lot of ground and it doesn't come from Russia and it
doesn't come from Europe (( )) the United States.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  Who's going to put out ((their)) oil fires.

A.93:  Huh, United States, right.  

B.94:  We had the technology when we had the people and we go do it.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  And I think we're going to, I think we're going to be president in a, a
presence in the Mideast from now on of the,

A.97:  Let's say, I'd have to say overall that the, the war was, was beneficial to
the United States with, with the change in attitudes and all that, you know,
all that stuff.  I mean, it's, people think better about, uh, the U S now.
And that's really going to, I think, eventually come back and, and help with
overall business standards.  I mean, people are going m-, take more pride in
their work and things like that.  I think it's going to really help out
overall.

B.98:  I, I agree a hundred percent on that.  

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  After, after all, you know, I mean, everything Bush said (( )) deadline if,
if it wasn't meant to be (( )).

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  And that's the way you're supposed to do it, 

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did, you know, say, well, ((you know
I'm just)) getting out of the olympics and I'm going to give you back Panama.

A.105:  [Laughter].  

B.106:  You know, I mean,

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  you either make your stand or you don't.  If you can't back it up, just
don't say anything.

A.109:  That's right.  

B.110:  And everything Bush said, he backed up.

A.111:  Uh-huh.   

B.112:  Of course, he (( )), he had some real good help.

A.113:  Oh, yeah, he had some excellent military people.  

B.114:  {Very faint}, yeah.  (( )) and like (( )) and the rest and, uh, yeah, Dick
Cheney.  Those people were real smart,

A.115:  Yeah I was,  

B.116:  they're a lot smarter (( )) is, better for.

A.117:  The person I was impressed with most, I mean, I, I really, you know, Colin
Powell and, and General Schwartzkopf, they're military people, but I really
didn't know that Cheney was as military minded as he is.  I mean,

B.118:  Cheney's hard core.  You don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a
wimp.

A.119:  That's right, I, well, he was what, uh, uh, Senator from Utah or something
like that I can't remember where.

B.120:  But he's served in the military.  

A.121:  Yeah, and see, I don't know that.  And it w-, you know, I was real
impressed with his handling of this, ((I know that)).

B.122:  Oh, yeah, the whole, I mean, the whole thing was done well. 

A.123:  Oh, yeah.  

B.124:  It was just, you know.  It was, uh, of course, he had to fight that (( ))
microscope anyway.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  But I hesitate to call it a war since, I mean, it was, I guess it was, I'm
not used to having them over in six days, you know.

A.127:  [Laughter] I don't think very many people are.  

B.128:  [Laughter] Just kind of, gosh, we just got started good.  

A.129:  Yeah.  

B.130:  I guess the Israelis might be over it, you know, you know, because they had
a seven day war at one time.

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  But, uh, although I, I wish instead of turning south, you know, taking a
right turn and going down Kuwait City, I wished we just turned left and gone
toward Bagdad.

A.133:  Yeah, there was, uh, there was a lot of talk about the idea that the, even
the, uh, Iraqis themselves, the people, wished we would have done that.  Uh,

B.134:  I think we should have because, because we're goin-, if we don't do it now,
we're going to have to do it shortly.

A.135:  Yeah.  Well, unless they finally do take care of it themselves, but, you
know, you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with, uh,
you know, depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or, uh, or the Kurds
((empower)) but, uh, you know, w-,

B.136:  The only thing that will save that is we won't get the credit for, or the
blame for the massacre.

A.137:  Well, that's true too.  Yeah.

B.138:  And, and then if we do have to, to go back in, it will be because, you
know, someone asked us to.

A.139:  Uh-huh.   

B.140:  And of course, now's the time to do it because ((since)) we have the army
over there.

A.141:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  

B.142:  I'd sure hate to, you know, spend eight months pulling them out, and then
turn right around send them back over again.

A.143:  Yeah, especially the cost of that and, and, uh, uh, the attitudes of the
soldiers.  I mean, they're there ((they)) think they could handle it better,
but if they came back and then had to turn around and go, the attitudes would
be just horrible.

B.144:  Yeah.  They shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet.

A.145:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's probably true.  

B.146:  They just, you know, just, just level the whole place and let it go.  But
we're going to have to be over there and we're, and our ((presence)) is going
to have to be (( )) and they've got to be strong presidents presence,

A.147:  Uh-huh.  

B.148:  uh, if, if we don't, then I think that we're going to be back there, you
know, in the Jimmy Car-, uh, Carter era, you know wringing your hands and
going trust me, trust me.

A.149:  [Laughter] So, do you think it's, you do think it's a good idea for us
to have, uh ...
