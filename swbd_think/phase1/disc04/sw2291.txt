=======================================================================

A.1:  Uh, interestingly enough in my younger days I taught school for two years
while my husband was getting his business established --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and I find the changes, uh, in the school system, I think a lot of them
very positive.  Uh, since his retirement the first of January, in nineteen
ninety, I've gone back to subbing, and of course subbing is a very different
endeavor than teaching.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  It's very difficult, and I've, after almost two years I've become a little
bit disillusioned, and I'm not real sure that I'm going to go back to it
because, uh, of discipline.  Uh, although I've never had a problem with it, I
guess I've just gotten a little tired of fighting.

B.6:  Yeah, what, what do, you said you think there're some improvements.  What
do you think the improvements have been?

A.7:  I think, uh, the quality of education in the high school system here is
better.  I think the teachers that we have now are more professional, and I
think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  I think the problems that I see in the system, uh, are, I, I tend
to see more in, uh, large inner city school districts that, uh, and I've, I've
noticed that, uh, suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems
at least what I, from what I hear --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- than, than, than the inside the city school districts.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And so I think the problem isn't so much the school system as in the things
that go on around it,

A.13:  In the community itself --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- that spill over so to speak.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  Well, my, my personal opinion is that so many parents, especially
those parents who are in a lower income and have to spend more of their energy
on work, they say, Well, I don't have to teach my kids anything.  The school's
going to do it for me.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  And I think the school can't do that.  The school can only exist as
something to help the parents out.  Not something to take the parents' place.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  I find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the
parents use the school as an excuse, however.

B.20:  Um, that, that can be, yeah.

A.21:  We're in, uh, as I said, a small town in Indiana, and it's a WASP community
with a student body of five hundred in the high school.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  So the setting is very different than it would be in Dallas or Chicago or
even Indianapolis, which is a couple hours south of us.  Uh, but to me, the,
the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning
than they were, they're more into the school system than they were twenty
years ago.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And, I find the Say No to Drugs campaign here to be, I think, very
effective, unless I have my head in the sand.

B.26:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Um, that, you know, kind of goes along, it's, it's a small
enough school where people can know each other and, and they work together to
thwart off problems.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  When you've got a high school with, you know, three, four thousand
students, um, there's just no, it's, it's very difficult to keep track of them
all.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  Oh sure, there are high schools as large as our community, which
makes a totally different situation.  I've, I've never felt that pouring more
tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- or most of the school problems.

B.32:  Yeah, the, I, I find that, I, I haven't seen any cases where that's been
very effective, and that seems to be what people want to do, is just, you
know, put more money into it.  And I just don't have a whole lot of confidence
in that.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  I also, you know, I consider for example the, the teachers, the National
Education Association.  You know, they, I would like to see them be more of a
professional organization rather than a union, because we, you know, we, we
need to, uh, instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries, I
think we need to worry about, uh, how well the job's getting done.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Isn't that the way with most groups, though.  They become a
self-protection thing --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- uh, of saving jobs or getting more salary. 

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  Uh, I do, I do find that the ma-, the majority of teachers in our group are
very professional, but then of course, we're a stable community, and many of
them have been in the system for twenty years --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- which I just can't think you'd find that in a large city school.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  Uh, but, you know, back to the idea of parents.  My personal
feeling is that parents need to be taking more responsibility.  I think, the
way I like to look at it, you know, a lot of people look at it is, Well, whose
job is it to teach the kids --

A.43:  Uh-huh, 

B.44:  -- well, it's the school's job.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  I think, Whose job is it to teach the kids, well primarily it's the parents
job, because the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at
school --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and the school is just there to help the parents --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- so I think the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents,
and, and we need to get to the idea, Well if the kids are, are doing poorly in
school, then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and take
some sort of action, instead of just complaining about what the school is
doing or not doing.  And sometimes, if the parents don't like the way the
school is being run, the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that
kid out of that school and put him in a different school.

A.51:  Except we don't have another school.

B.52:  Yeah, that's, in small communities that's a --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- difficult choice, but then the small communities are the ones with fewer
problems.

A.55:  Because they have fewer students.

B.56:  Yeah, it's, it's the big cities that have these kind of problems, and there
I like to see the parents be able --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- to have a choice saying, I don't like the way this school is being run.
I want to send my child to some place where they'll be properly, uh, properly
taught, and properly, uh, trained.

A.59:  You don't find that parents are getting more involved in your area?

B.60:  Some parents are, but some parents don't have the opportunity to do that --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- as easily, you know.  People that are working two jobs --

A.63:  Uh-huh

B.64:  -- or single parents --

A.65:  Uh-huh

B.66:  -- uh, that sort of thing.

A.67:  I think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school
systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day
--

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- if, if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're
not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest, and the
student's out at three.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  I think really the school does have more of that student's time because
eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to
be sleeping, and certainly the parent needs some social life --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- besides, uh,

B.74:  And you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work.
You, you want to rest for a little while, and maybe the children, uh, don't
want you to rest.

A.75:  They might need to be dealt with --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- you know.

B.78:  And it's, it's a difficult problem, and it's one that, basically, I think,
in large measure, it's, it's, it's up to the parents to take the
responsibility for what's happening to their children's --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- education, I think.  

A.81:  Uh-huh.  And we did have, we did recently have a, a group here formed
called Students for Academic Excellence, that was formed by concerned parents,
and they see that these, these kids are getting honor jackets, and they're
getting certificates, and they're getting, uh, more access to scholarships,
uh, on a par with the athletes --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- which, uh, this was formed I think, probably in the last three years,
and that's been a very positive thing for education itself, because so often
the emphasis is on baseball, basketball and football --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- and it gets away from what the school is established for originally.

B.86:  Yeah.  And here, in Texas, if you don't like football,

A.87:  [Laughter]

B.88:  you're considered a heretic.

A.89:  Well, this is basketball in Indiana so.

B.90:  Yes that was going to be my guess.

A.91:  Uh-huh.  We do all have our sport.  In fact, we've been on a real high here
because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the
history of the school.  So sport is, has been really first and foremost here
in the last month.  But we hope that education is first and foremost for the
year.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  Nice talking to you.

B.94:  All right.  Well, thank you for the call.

A.95:  Uh-huh. Bye.

B.96:  Bye.
