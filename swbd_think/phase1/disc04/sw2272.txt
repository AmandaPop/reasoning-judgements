A.1:  Okay. 

B.2:  So, regarding this proposal, uh, personally I guess my, my initial feeling
is that it, it would be a great experience for kids.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, I, I don't think that they really get that sort of experience working
with the community through school, through college.  I just don't think people
have that opportunity anymore.

A.5:  Yeah, probably not as much so.  

B.6:  I think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that, you know, they,
they don't get on the wrong track.  Uh, you know, so that they, they have
someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing.  Uh, I mean
who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate
in something like this.

A.7:  Right.  I guess my, I, you know, I come out, am sitting on the fence --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- but I have some concerns about, uh, you know, if you require someone to
do this for a year or two --

B.10:  Uh-huh.   

A.11:  -- that's a big chunk out of someone's life -- 

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- uh, certainly, you know, there could be advantages and things to be
learned [laughter] --

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- but on the other hand, you know, how do you enforce it or what if they
are just totally against it.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Then does it really benefit anybody -- 

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- you know.  

B.20:  That's true.  

A.21:  So,

B.22:  That's true.  I mean it might turn people more off than on if they're
forced to do something that they don't want to do.

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  I guess a year is a long time.  Maybe six months might be a little bit more
reasonable.

A.25:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.26:  But, I can see a lot of benefits in that it might, uh, interest some people
that had never thought of maybe going into social work or --

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  -- or that sort of thing, uh, and, gosh, we all know that there's a need
for that.

A.29:  Or might teach them a little more empathy -- 

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- towards those who, you know, have problems and need help with things.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  

A.33:  Well, I was thinking, too, uh, we usually think of the Peace Corps as going
overseas to do something, but if they required this where you stay in the U S
and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- you know, benefit the people here and perhaps, too, the fact that we
have more elderly people now --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- uh, you know, it could be an advantage --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- to them.  

B.40:  I would think it would be nice if they could almost give it as course
credit.

A.41:  Um.  

B.42:  You know --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- uh, have it be just like real life teaching in a sense.  And maybe then,
uh, [lipsmack] people are feeling like they're getting something out of it,
too, but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them
participating and, and, I mean I, I even think that that sort of experience is
worth a lot more than reading a textbook --

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  -- sometimes.  

A.47:  Yeah.  Well, and probably, too, even those who might initially be opposed,
once they got into it then, they, you know, would see that, hey this, this is
giving me some benefit --

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- as well.  I mean, they, they might not express it in words --

B.50:  Right.  

A.51:  -- so much, but just sort of get in step with, with, uh, what's going on --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- and, and really enjoy it.  

B.54:  Yeah.  When I was in college I worked, uh, with a group and I actually ran
a Big Brother, Big Sister program --

A.55:  Um.  

B.56:  -- and besides just, you know, having this extracurricular thing, I really
noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment.  You know, they learned
that they need to, if they make a, a, if they have a responsibility,
especially if it's dealing with another person, you know, someone else might
be relying on them for something, uh, you know, depending on them to either be
somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that --

A.57:  Yeah {faint}.

B.58:  -- you know, that that, you really learn to, to be dependable.  You know,
you learn that when someone's relying on you, you need to be there.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  I think a lot of our young people need to learn that [laughter].

B.60:  Oh, it's really, it's true.  

A.61:  Older ones, too.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  I know of few of those.  

B.64:  Well, I work at, in a personnel agency, and, uh, I've just found the work
ethics of people to be disgusting.

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  I mean, you know, I'll, someone might not show up for work and you'll call
them and, oh, they overslept, or, oh, they just --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- didn't feel like going to work, and so I lose my job, I'll get another
one.

A.69:  Yeah, I don't understand that, either.  That's -- 

B.70:  I, I know.

A.71:  -- that's tough.

B.72:  I wish I was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know.

A.73:  [Laughter]. 

B.74:  But, uh, I mean perhaps with this sort of training early in life before
people develop bad habits --

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  -- might not be such a bad idea, but, [lipsmack], but, you know, it is, it
is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else
just as constructive.

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  And we're making them do that.  

A.79:  Well, another thing, too, is, if you have, uh, some young people who are
really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the, uh, math and science --

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  -- and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of --

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  -- taking them away from that which they are centered on might, you know,
be a, a bad thing.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  To take a couple years out of -- 

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- beginning, you know, their life in that respect -- 

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  -- they might, you know, get off on some other track, but --

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  -- you know, it's hard to say.  

B.92:  Yeah, it is.  I don't know, I think it's a very interesting, uh,
discussion, you know --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  -- and, and there's certainly lots of pros and cons around it.  Uh, I, I
wish I had that sort of choice.  I mean maybe, maybe it could end up being a
choice.  And things that, uh, you know, the problem is that now it's seen as
almost a punishment.  Like when somebody, uh, [lipsmack] I don't know,
remember, wasn't it Zsa Zsa Gabor --

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  -- that had to do community service work -- 

A.97:  Oh, yeah, and she didn't -- 

B.98:  -- for like a year.  

A.99:  -- get around to it [laughter] very much.  

B.100:  Yeah, ((or something like that)).  And a lot of, uh, felonies, felony
people, you know, have to do this sort of --

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- community service.  And I think it's getting the wrong sort of, uh,
[lipsmack] connotation with it.

A.103:  Right.  

B.104:  It shouldn't be looked at as a punishment.  It shouldn't be looked at
something to do to make up for other things that you did.

A.105:  Yeah.  

B.106:  I, I think it needs to be, community service needs to have more of a
positive, uh, light towards it [lipsmack] and have it look as something, you
know, that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits
out of it and not as something that, you know, oh, you, you did it instead of
going to jail for,

A.107:  [Laughter]. 

B.108:  three months or something like that.  I mean that's, that's a feeling I
get now and --

A.109:  Yeah.  

B.110:  -- I, I wouldn't, wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to be one of those
people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it
to get out of a sentence or, or --

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  -- you know, because they were bad in some other way.  

A.113:  Yeah.  But I guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've, you know,
you've done something that's not too terrible, but --

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  -- they want to #slap your hand a little bit [laughter].#  

B.116:  #But bad enough, right.#  That's true.  

A.117:  Better than just sitting in jail all day not doing anything.

B.118:  Yeah.  Right.

A.119:  But, but, yeah, I agree with your point.  

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  It, it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to
be there.

B.122:  Really important, yeah.  

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  That's true. [lipsmack] Well -- 

A.125:  Well.  

B.126:  -- this has been interesting.  

A.127:  Yeah, enjoyed talking to you.  

B.128:  You, too.  

A.129:  All right.  

B.130:  Take care.  

A.131:  Bye-bye.  

B.132:  Bye-bye.
