============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, you want to go first.

B.2:  Well, uh, topic being the banking crisis, uh, that's a real hot topic
[laughter].

A.3:  Yeah, sure is.

@B.4:  Real, real mess, I guess you must say.

A.5:  Yeah, it is.  Course, you, you've, you've had your fair share of that down
your way too.

B.6:  Oh, yeah, think, uh, probably, I guess it's pretty well wide spread nation
wide, but I think Texas probably suffered and or caused the, uh, [laughter]
major, or a good portion of it.

A.7:  No argument here.  Yeah, I, I think that, uh, now I'm, I'm no financial
expert, but from what I've read and heard --

B.8:  That makes two of us,

A.9:  -- yeah, I think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that
allowed savings and loans to make, uh, riskier, uh, investments.  And, of
course, uh, oil was one of the main things that were invested in, oil and real
estate, and of course when oi-, when oil went south, real estate went with it.
People were speculating in the future that, without anything to fall back on,
when prices on both of those went, went, uh, down.

B.10:  Yeah, I understood that shaky, uh, real estate loans was probably the, the
major culprit.

A.11:  Well, also,

B.12:  in the oil crisis.

A.13:  in-, in-, investments in oil ventures as well --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- because it was predic-, predicated on, uh, a certain price per barrel to
recover the costs of the loan, and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel
to twelve dollars a barrel, then that just wasn't any way to break even.

B.16:  Yeah, I guess that was the immediate cause.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Uh, shoot, I don't, uh, I tell you one thing as far as the way they're
handling it, I, uh, feel pretty strongly about this, and that's, I think
they're over reacting as far as the actions taken against their, the little
guy, the depositor, the customers --

A.19:  Yeah, yeah.

B.20:  -- they went way to far the other way in the spectrum, and --

A.21:  Yep.

B.22:  -- on the other hand I don't know whether they're doing enough in the way
of, uh, redressing the situation and bringing the, uh, the real, you know, the
presidents of the banks and those people that are, uh, really responsible to
justice on that.

A.23:  Didn't, didn't they just, uh, put another, another thirty billion dollar
band aid on the problem last week, or something.

B.24:  [Laughter] (( )).

A.25:  The President approved some more money to bail them out.

B.26:  Yeah, it's going to be, uh, it's your and my money that's doing that, you
know --

A.27:  Well, that's true.

B.28:  -- unfortunately.  But,

A.29:  Of course it just adds to the, to the annual deficit which adds to the
overall debt of the nation, and, uh --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- at some point in time it's either going to be repaid or just completely
blown off.  I'm not sure which, which one is which.  I really think our whole
financial institution is a house of cards, waiting to collapse.

B.32:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, I guess the hope is that, uh, they can find some
way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to, uh, to help, uh, get
them out of it.

A.33:  Yeah, now, I, I'm a staunch Republican, but, uh, you know, for the last
nine years I've heard that, that we would grow our way out of, uh,

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  out of debt, and after the longest sustained economic recovery in I
don't know how many decades, it didn't happen, and, uh, I don't know what
it's, what it's going to take to turn that around.

B.36:  That's a good point, they, uh, [laughter] they got a little hesitation in
the recovery here, and, uh, hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly
short period of time.

A.37:  Yeah, I think ending the, the Gulf war quickly was beneficial.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Definitely.

B.40:  Uh, let's see, what were some of the other, other points she mentioned
topic wise.

A.41:  Do we think enough is being done to address it?  I, I guess it had some
blue ribbon panels look into it.  I don't remember what their findings and
recommendations were.

B.42:  It seems to me like they really haven't, uh, at least they haven't, if
they're doing anything, it's still pretty much, uh, uh, not out in the open --

A.43:  Right, right.

B.44:  -- it's, uh, you know, behind the scenes --

A.45:  Sure.

B.46:  -- panels, or whatever, you know, committees or investigations, nothing,
nothing that makes headlines that much as been done really, I don't think.

A.47:  That's true, although of course the last six months the headlines have been
pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Maybe now that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to address
this in more depth.

B.50:  Does tend to, uh, push that out of the front page [laughter].

@@A.51:  Well, hey it's been real good talking with you.

B.52:  Yeah, this will be a first, I, uh, usually end up getting, uh, told I got
three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds, or something like that.

A.53:  Oh, do they come on, does something, body come on the line and tell you to
do that?

B.54:  Yeah, I think one time it was ten minutes was the maximum --

A.55:  Oh.

B.56:  -- and another time it was ended by --

A.57:  Wh-, what's the,

B.58:  -- capacity was --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- short that day or something.

A.61:  What's the minimum, is that like three minutes?

B.62:  I don't think there is a, I don't know if there is a minimum.

A.63:  Oh, okay.  

B.64:  So, I'm, uh, satisfied we covered the topic on this end.

A.65:  I think so too.

B.66:  Nice talking with you.

A.67:  You bet.

B.68:  Bye-bye.

A.69:  Bye-bye.
