REMARKS:        Speaker B could not be heard sometimes while saying uh-huh
during real conversation, therefore when A was dubbed out totally, B's 
uh-huh's could not be put in properly at times.

============================================================================

A.1:  Camping, uh, is a pretty vague term.  It seems to encounter, or cover a lot
of different kinds of, of, uh, shall we say over night trips, or sometimes not
even over night --

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- uh, anything from no provisions, to, uh, going with what you can carry
on a backpack, uh, maybe even a tent, go up to state parks with six shelters
and little screened in areas, and then travel trailers, and all the way up to
conference center type campings that have, uh, you know, air conditioning like
hotels with,

B.4:  [Laughter].  

A.5:  uh, ski boats, and whatever else may be around.  Some people may, may
still call that a camp, so I guess you could go camping and do archery, and
riflery, and all the things that kids do at those camps, but then go to their
little ho-, air conditioning room at night.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  So, uh, I've been through most all of that.  I've not done much of the no
provision survival type, but I've done backpacking in tents, and state park
shelters, and travel trailers, and, uh, camping, camping with nice air
conditioned rooms, and I guess of all the, all the ones, I kind of prefer the,
air conditioned ones, and the, the not so roughing ones [laughter] with more
entertainment than, uh, survival in mind.

B.8:  Huh.

A.9:  Uh, one of the times that we were at a, uh, state park, we went up into
Oklahoma, and went to a place called Broken Bow, and, rented a few canoes with
a church group we were with, bunch of college age kids [smack] and we
took these canoes into a river that would feed it, that would bring us back
down toward, drove up, up stream, and then worked our way back down toward the
campsite that we were at --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- and you just never can time those things right with the water, the way
you would like them to be, uh, we got there and the water was really low, we,
we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and, at one point, even though,
I know your not supposed to do this, I stood up in the canoe and reached my
paddle up as high as I could, and I could not even touch the branches that
were over the, the, la-, uh, river part there --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been
a couple of weeks prior --

B.14:  Huh.  

A.15:  -- so, it was, you know, ten or so feet higher, uh, just a few weeks ago,
in fact, uh, a few weeks prior to when we got there, and the, camp, the people
at the campgrounds told us that, uh, asked where we were from, and we said
Dallas, and they said, oh, well, we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that
rage of water,

B.16:  Huh.

A.17:  well, that's encouraging, but they said, oh you have nothing to worry
about, you'll have the opposite problem, you may die of carrying your canoe,
and sure enough, it, uh, it was a little bit ((laborious)) instead of a, a six
to eight hours worth of canoeing, we ended up only surviving about, uh, half
the trip, and it took us, us about ten hours, so, we, we got in our car half
way, and, and went and got the rest of the vehicles, and brought them up
stream, and loaded it all back up, and went back to the campsite exhausted --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- but, uh, I have had better camping, canoeing trips, uh, as it were, uh,
like the Guadalupe down in South Texas, it's got some real nice, uh, canoeing,
uh, water in it --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- have you been camping much?  

B.22:  I mostly do, uh, back packing, uh, as opposed to any of the other sorts.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  Uh, though I guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion
for you if you like the air condition type.

A.25:  [Laughter] That's true.  

B.26:  Uh-huh.  The, uh, yeah, I've done things, uh, I guess mostly, up state
Michigan, (( )) White Mountains, ((Appellation Trail)) kind of things, uh, I
prefer going out either with one other person or by myself, for about a week,
and, I guess I just look at it as I time I can get away from it all, and,

A.27:  Huh.   

B.28:  kind of rely on my own resources a bit, although I guess I haven't gone
survival camping ((where I scrape together all my food)) I've always carried
it with me.  But, uh --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- still, it's you know, nice to get away from civilization every once in a
while and --

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  -- enjoy the wildlife.  

A.33:  I wonder if, uh, being from, uh, [smack] Dallas area, I wonder, if,
if, it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping, I, I,
seems like back packing goes well with mountain, and, sc-, sceneries worth
seeing,

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  by foot.  Where as here, your looking as, you know, you can go two
hundred miles, and your probably in the same kind of environment [laughter]
you were in when you left, so --

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  -- uh, unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a good
considerable amount of woods, or if you go, uh, extreme south part where
there's some, some things worth seeing by foot --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- uh, the majority of, of camping experiences around here seem to be
geared toward entertainment, where your, your looking at the state parks, all
seem to have something of a, a either a like that you'd go canoeing, or
skiing, or whatever kind of sailing, boating you want to do --

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- uh, but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks,

B.42:  Huh.  

A.43:  there are in more of the, the Eastern part of the state where there's
woods worth, worth seeing, but, uh, [smack] that's interesting, I
hadn't, all the people that I know that do back packing, usually go up to
Colorado or go up somewhere, and you know, get away from the state to actually
do that kind of, uh, camping.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I end up, well, yeah, I mean, I do a lot of, like even
weekender kind of things, I go out for just one or two nights, uh, it's not
my favorite thing, but I can do it a lot more often, so like over at the, uh,
particularly in the, uh, the fall and spring, when the insects haven't come
out yet, uh, where they're already gone, uh, (( )) them almost every weekend
up in the mountains, and I guess I live about five hours away, from some place
to go hiking, where I am now,

A.45:  That's not too bad.  

B.46:  uh.  Pardon me,

A.47:  that's not too bad at all.  

B.48:  no.  No, it's not bad, and, uh, yeah, I mean, if it's, if you can find
somebody who's, uh, you know, willing to go out for several days, you know,
and can handle that sort of thing.  [breathing] Uh, which isn't everybody
you run across,

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  obviously who's willing to, you know, put seventy, or ninety pounds on
their back,

A.51:  [Laughter].  

B.52:  and go hiking.  Uh, [laughter] but, uh, it can be a lot of fun, and, uh,
I there's certainly other people who go out, uh, canoeing, I mean, there's
usually, lots and lots of ponds, particularly (( )) uh, for canoeing, and, you
know, there are places you can drive in and park, and they have got the usual
kinds of campgrounds and stuff.  But, uh, you can also just, you know,
bush-wack, or go on semitrailed areas, and just get three days from any place
that's civilization --

A.53:  Huh.  

B.54:  -- and that's kind of fun.  

A.55:  Yeah.  That would be.  One of my very first experiences of, uh, tent
camping, if it were, with a group of people --

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- we went up to a state park, that was, oh the campsites were, uh, not
perfect, but they were, you know, basic rail road ties and laid in sand, so it
wasn't just the,

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  actual ((train)) and it had a somewhat level,

B.60:  [Throat_clearing].

A.61:  and it had a place to stick your tent, and so,

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  you could, uh, drive a stake in fairly easy, and, and, get the thing
nailed down, but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge, and, uh, the
very first time we went up there with this group of people, we all set up
these tents, most of which were borrowed, and we were having to figure out,
you know, how this particular one works, and how this one works, and it's
eleven o'clock at night, and it's,

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  you know, (( )) by the head lights of the cars, and, and about, uh, oh a
little after midnight, we got all these tents set up, and I laid down inside
one of them, and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the
tent said, uh, asked if I was doing all right, and I said, huh, yeah, yeah,
doing just fine, you know, it's a little windy, but I'm doing all right, and
and they suggested that I come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't
fallen down yet, and sure enough, after I got out of there a little bit, it
blew down, and,

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  the winds were just terrible, and, uh, then it started to rain, so, we
didn't get too wet, but, uh, it rained just for a little bit, then went on,
and so after all that was over, we put them all back up and, woke up a little
late the next morning, but, uh, when we finally got back from that, that
outing, one of the, uh, parents of one of the kids, had asked how it went, and
said that he was listening to the, it is radio, and they clocked a
ninety-seven mile an hour winds on the damn,

B.68:  (( )).

A.69:  right in front of that lake, and there's really nothing to stop it, it's,
uh, thirty or forty miles wide.  It's a huge, uh, lake right on the border of
Texas and Oklahoma there, and --

B.70:  Huh.

A.71:  -- and it had a, the little, little part that we were on was the peninsula
with no trees --

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  -- so we were just stuck out in the water, with, uh, nothing blocking us
from this wind.  It's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that, but, uh,
I'm sure that was just a, a top speed of the wind, but it, it did manage to
take all our tents out.

B.74:  Yeah.  It's funny when you talk about, you know, this it sort of reminds me
that every time I'm telling somebody about like a camping trip, and I've, I've
done quite a few, say with my sister, is the stuff that you remember isn't,
you know, really so much the, uh, the normal every day,

A.75:  [Laughter].  

B.76:  oh this is a nice scene or something like this, it's, it's remember when
are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we got [laughter]
sliding down to the bottom of the tent, or you know, when the tent's blowing
down, or when you wake up in the middle of the night and there's a hurricane,
and you know, it's, we can laugh about it, I mean your not laughing about it
then too much,

A.77:  [Laughter].  

B.78:  I mean, you know, afterwards it's, it's, it's kind of a nice memory to,
think gee, I survived that [laughter].

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  We'll always need the, uh, feather bed as it were.  

A.81:  That's true.  On that same lake there's another portion of it that's, uh,
real, uh, carved out, the, the, the shoreline is, uh, up against rock and
it's, it's pretty far cliff, I'd say shirt or forty feet worth, and the
campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the
little rail road ties again, will try to, stop the erosion on the path, and
little stair steps all the way down to this beach --

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  -- and that, was, uh, a, that particular campout ...
