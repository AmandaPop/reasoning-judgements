============================================================================

A.1:  So what T V shows do you like?  Do you like comedies, or,

@B.2:  I like comedies, and I like sitcoms.  I like to watch T V for escape.
I'm not much [whistling] interested in,

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Do you like, uh, do you like CHEERS?

B.4:  Yeah, I like that, and I like L A LAW and I like THIRTY SOMETHING.

A.5:  NIGHT COURT?

B.6:  I like NIGHT COURT.  In fact it's on right now [laughter].

A.7:  Yeah, I, I think that's pretty much what I like, is, my favorite T V show
is CHEERS, and then after that is, uh, NIGHT COURT, but I also, I also like
STAR TREK, and that's kind of an adventure I guess you would call it.

B.8:  Yeah, I never really got involved in STAR TREK, and I don't really care to
watch movies because it's committing too much time, I think.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  You know, you never know what's going to come up.  You know, if you commit
thirty minutes or an hour to watch some T V shows, it's a little different
than --

A.11:  Yeah, that's true.

B.12:  -- you know, two hours for a movie, especially you know, things that are, I
hate things that (( )) continue.

A.13:  Yeah, especially like that, have you guys seen the movie, uh, DANCES WITH
WOLVES?

B.14:  No, I haven't.

A.15:  You don't want to see it.  It's like three hours long and it just --

B.16:  That's what I've heard.

A.17:  -- drags on forever.

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  Well, I like, I mean, I like, you know, things that are funny and, and,
all, you know, like, like, CHEERS, you know, is really funny, it, it makes you
laugh, or, you know, so it's not like, uh, uh a show that goes on forever,
even though it's only half an hour.

B.20:  Yeah, and it's a, just a nice escape, and you know, it's something to laugh
at and enjoy.

A.21:  Yeah, something to remove, you know, something to remove me from reality --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- for a little while --

B.24:  Exactly,

A.25:  -- get away from real life.

B.26:  Exactly.  That's what I like.

A.27:  Cause I, I mean, I don't know, it's just something, I think, something we
need [laughter] as you know as human beings something to remove you from
reality to relieve the stress.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  And CHEERS does it, I don't know, I like the way, I like the way the people
act in CHEERS, it's, it's pretty funny, it's, it's kind of, you know, the
extremes of certain characters,

B.30:  Yeah, yeah, you're right about (( )) Yeah, I watch it, it's on, it's on
here like, um, three or four times a night on various cable channels
[laughter].

A.31:  Yeah, the syndicate,

B.32:  I've probably seen every episode about thirty-five times [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, they, when they'll show one, one episode in one channel and like the
next day they'll show it on another one.

B.34:  Well, yeah, but (( )) here they've got it at like six or six thirty, and
then they have it again at ten and ten thirty, you know, on a different
channel,

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  And so, you know,

A.37:  Where, where I, where I, where I'm at right now is in a dorm, and we don't
have the uh, we don't have cable --

B.38:  Oh, okay.

A.39:  -- so I just get regular T V, but we see it, uh, every day at six o'clock.

B.40:  Uh-huh, the older one.

A.41:  Yeah, right, and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays.

B.42:  Yeah, I'm trying to think what other shows I like.  There, there's just
television has changed so much, and, uh,

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  There's just not as many really good shows on, I think, as there used to
be.  I guess a lot of people think that the shows that I watch are kind of
stupid and most of my friends and the people I know don't,

A.45:  Well, how about the WONDER YEARS.  Do you like the WONDER YEARS?

B.46:  Yeah I like that.

A.47:  That's pretty good, I mean, it's, it's not something you see every day so
it's, I guess it, that, that keeps the quality a little higher.

B.48:  Well, yeah, and what I like about that show is that the time, the time
period that that takes place in is exactly the age I was during that time
period.

A.49:  Uh-huh, so it's even closer to you.

B.50:  Yeah, it's kind of funny to, you know, sit back and remember.  It brings
back a lot of memories.  [talking] Um, I don't know, I (( )) I don't know if
you're, you would know like BARNEY MILLER.  Do you ever watch that?  Or the
old BOB NEWHART SHOW.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  I never ever really got into Bob Newhart.  

B.52:  Never got into that.  I'm talking about the old one, when he was a
psychologist.

A.53:  Oh, I don't, I don't, I never --

B.54:  Don't remember those.

A.55:  -- never saw that,

B.56:  I don't know, my friends don't like my [laughter] choice in T V, they think
it's trashy, but uh, (( )),

A.57:  I kind of, I kind of stayed away from the T V for a couple of years when I
first came up here, so I, you know, there's a gap in my T V viewing, but
recently --

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- that's basically what I watch is CHEERS and, and, uh, and NIGHT COURT,
because they're, they show them back to back.

B.60:  Back to back.  When I was in college, you know, we didn't have T V -s, and
so I remember somebody happened to have one in their room.  It was a really
big deal, and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch T V,
but, I hate that (( )) you have to give up a lot of T V when you have
[laughter], 

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  lot of things you have to give up when you're going to school.

A.63:  Yeah.  Well.

B.64:  Sounds like we have real similar (( )) tastes, I mean as far as the sitcoms
go.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  What about the, do you like L A LAW, or,

A.67:  No, no, I don't, I don't particularly get into those shows because they
don't keep my interest.  I've seen, um, L A LAW I think, once or twice --

B.68:  Is that all?

A.69:  -- and the episode wasn't that great, so I just, I figured they were all
like that so I don't waste my time --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- looking at that, and, you know, and if it's, if it's funny or if it
keeps my interest, if it's exciting I'll watch it, if not I don't, and times
that I saw that, or pieces of that it wasn't any, it wasn't great.  Thirty
Something I watched a few times because there was a few good episodes, and
then after that, it, it, I just lost interest in it.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  I guess it's because it's not aimed for an audience of my age.

B.74:  Yeah, probably not.

A.75:  No, I'm, I'm in my twenties, my early twenties, and so, I guess THIRTY
SOMETHING --

B.76:  About ten years [laughter].

A.77:  -- is not, is definitely not for me.

B.78:  Yeah, ten years down the road for you.  But um, those are really the only
two drama shows that I like.  And I tell everybody, don't call me (( ))
[laughter].

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  But other than that, you know I like, I, um, I'm recovering from surgery,
and so I read and watch a lot of television [laughter].

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  So I get to see about everything [laughter].

A.83:  Yeah, well, that, that way you'll, you'll get to see all the shows and you
get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is
really,

B.84:  Yeah, but who cares about my opinion.  [laughter] (( )) I don't know, it
seems like some of the best shows they take off the air.  One of my favorite
shows was WISE GUY, and they took that off the air.

A.85:  What was WISE GUY?

B.86:  It was a cop show.

A.87:  Oh, I mean, I heard of it before, but I never, I never seen it.

B.88:  Yeah, I have to stay up (( )), I have to stay up til eleven thirty and then
it's all re runs, and the guy that was, started out in it, isn't in it
anymore.

A.89:  Did you, have you ever seen that, that show, they, I mean, they, they
trashed it before it ever got started, but it was like I think they showed a
couple of shows of, uh, what is it, a COP ROCKS, or something like that,

B.90:  I heard a lot about it, but I never saw it.

A.91:  I heard, I heard it really sucked,

B.92:  Did it.

A.93:  Because, uh, it was supposed to be something like a sho-, uh, singing and
like, like a musical, but,

B.94:  Oh, really,

A.95:  Yeah, like a musical, like right in the middle of acting they would sing
songs, or something.

B.96:  You're kidding,

A.97:  No.

B.98:  Maybe I should have [laughter] (( )) would have been pretty funny, I don't
know.

A.99:  I can see why it crashed,

B.100:  I don't think it was supposed to be funny though [laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter]  Well, it was nice talking to you.

B.102:  Nice talking to you.  I guess you'll get to watch all of NIGHT COURT.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  I've missed the first ten minutes [laughter].

A.105:  Oh, well, I'll get off the phone and let you watch it then.

B.106:  I'm sorry.  I'm just teasing.

A.107:  And good luck on your recovery.

B.108:  Thanks.

A.109:  All right.  

B.110:  Bye-bye.

A.111:  Bye.
