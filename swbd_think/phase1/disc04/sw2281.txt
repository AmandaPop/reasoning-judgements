=========================================================================

A.1:  I kind of like mysteries, like Agatha Christie and that kind of stuff.

B.2:  Oh, Agatha Christie, how about John Mc-, John B. McDonald.  You ever read
him?

A.3:  No.  (( )) I'm not familiar with him.  What is he?  Is he an American
novelist?

B.4:  Oh, yeah, he's ve-, he, uh, course he, he's dead now.  Seems like most of
the good ones are.

A.5:  Uh-huh, yeah, I know, they don't write anything like they used to.  The
classics,

B.6:  But uh, he, he was, he does quite involved mysteries, John B.  McDonald.

A.7:  And, have you been reading him a long time, or,

B.8:  Oh, yes.  Since, well way back in high school.

A.9:  That long [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  We don't talk about that.

B.12:  Yeah (( )).

A.13:  Yeah,

B.14:  Matter of fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is, uh, reading.

A.15:  Uh, that's one of mine, my husband's a little more inclined toward that,
but I'm not real interested in self-improvement books at all.  I think
everything's too topical nowadays.

B.16:  Yep, for, when I read I read for enjoyment or escapism.

A.17:  Yeah, and I like a lot of things that are, uh, have to do with politics and
history.  There was one a few years ago called the (( )) PALACE about what
goes on at the Pentagon.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.

A.19:  Did you rea-, are you interested in stuff like that or,

B.20:  Well, I, I've been in the military, so I'm well aware of the (( )) palace.

A.21:  Oh, is it [laughter].

B.22:  Yes [laughter].

A.23:  And you probably know even more than I do.

B.24:  Yeah, it was quite, it was quite amusing.  I used to, I was in Viet Nam for
a couple of years, plus extension.  And, uh,

A.25:  Yeah, I don't know, have there been any good books published on that.  I
know World War two my dad was a, uh, paratrooper, in Airborne hundred and 
one --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- um, but I don't think they have done anything good on Viet Nam.

B.28:  They've got several out.  Uh, there's one called EMBASSY HOUSE by, uh --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- (( )) that's quite good.  I was involved with the Phoenix program and
stuff of that, that nature.

A.31:  And is it true, I mean, is it, um,

B.32:  It's fairly facts.  Whoever he talked to knew what the, had been in the
program.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Uh, (( )) who's calling factual he's kind of overdone a lot of it, but, 
um --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but you have to do that to make the book.

A.37:  I find that one of my interests is, um, I've been, I'm interested more in,
I'm just got a book for Christmas called LAW AND ORDER.  It's the history of
the justice system --

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  -- and tracks, um, the history of, uh, crimes and, uh, things that have
impacted just, the, the, you know, evolution of, um, how we punish people and
why things are judged the way they are.

B.40:  Um.  I hadn't heard that one.  I hadn't, uh, got too heavy into law and
order deal.  Most of mine I'm afraid I go either mysteries or, uh, action
adventure stuff.

A.41:  Oh, action adventure.  I probably, you're not talking your Danielle Steele
female by any means.

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  But on the other hand, I won't, uh, (( )) Sidney Sheldon's does come off
the shelf [laughter] for light reading.

B.44:  I read those.  Actually, I think my favorite author really right now, is,
uh, William Johnstone.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  He writes the (( )) action series.

A.47:  Uh-huh, I've heard, again, I'm not familiar with reading him, but I've
heard of him.

B.48:  He's got about twelve out now, and it starts out with, uh, you know, after
the big war and everything's blown up, and he's kind of,

A.49:  A real positive,

B.50:  Yeah, it's kind of, it follows his, his travels throughout the world.

A.51:  There's one, a book I just got, I got it as a gift and I just started.
It's a little bit heavy, but it was kind of interesting.  It, um was on the
Best Seller list for a while there.  It's called THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN
MIND.

B.52:  Oh, yeah.

A.53:  A little bit heavy about political philosophy.

B.54:  Those I-, those I can read for a while, but I got to stop and go, you know,
walk around, something.

A.55:  That's kind of what's hap-, it kind of does happen, yeah.  Uh, I'm trying
to think of any self-improvement books I've read [laughter].

B.56:  I've tried to do some of those.  Uh, uh, after I read them a while, I
thought maybe I don't need improvement that bad after all.

A.57:  Yeah, that's exactly right.  It's kind of like all the talk shows,

B.58:  They kind of drag on.,

A.59:  I think, I got to get,

B.60:  Did you read that one, uh, let's see, uh, that the Arab guy wrote that the
Abdul is going to come, uh,

A.61:  Oh, um, no, I didn't, but I, I, I have it and I haven't read it.

B.62:  Yeah, we got at T I to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the
time they were doing it.

A.63:  That's exactly what happened to us.  We were living, um, in Minneapolis at
the time, and we were getting ready to come back to Texas, um, and I went into
a Waldon's and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like.  But I haven't
read it.  There is a good one out, though, that we've had for a few years,
that I've actually read more than once.  It's called THE KINGDOM OF (( )).

B.64:  Oh, yeah, good.

A.65:  It is really good about the Saudis and just tracking their families and the
Arabian culture.

B.66:  I've read that. 

A.67:  It's well written actually.

B.68:  I got, uh, I got the, interested in when Saddam Hussein came to power.  I
got interested in him and started reading some of his, some of the books on
him.

A.69:  And I think there're going to be more, huh?

B.70:  Oh, yes, the man is probably totally insane.

A.71:  That's too bad that's not the topic, I know [laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  Self-improvement I think is the only one I got something like that, when I
got, I'd been out of school for quite a while, I think, um, back, when it was
again real topical, um, women my age about then were maybe having trouble with
parents or mothers, and a friend of mine bought me something called MY MOTHER,
MYSELF.  And I tried to read it, and I went, This is, I did the same thing, I
went, This isn't anything [laughter].

B.74:  Have you read Tom Clancy?

A.75:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  In fact I just started her, a friend, a friend of ours
turned me on to that.  I always, I always looked at spy novels, and I went Eh.
Military stuff just never really did anything to me, unless it was history.

B.76:  Which one did you get?

A.77:  The, um, China, the Red, the, the, I think it was the Red Author, you'll
have to help me out here.

B.78:  HUNT, HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.

A.79:  HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, the one I went to see the movie for.

B.80:  Yeah, that was good.  Uh, he's got,

A.81:  I was a little bit bored with it compared to some of the other stuff that
I've heard he's done.

B.82:  He's, uh, that's one of the better ones.  Uh --

A.83:  Uh-huh

B.84:  -- uh, I think my favorite that he's done is A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.

A.85:  Yes, that one I've, we actually have that one.  My husband's read that.
It, that one seems like it might be a little more interesting.

B.86:  It's pretty factual.  He's got one out, I'm trying to remember what it's
called.  It has to do with, with airplanes.

A.87:  Uh, boy.

B.88:  I started in reading it.  A friend of mine whose a pilot gave it to me.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  So, he said, It's a wonderful book, you'll love it.  I started reading it,
anyway, of course he goes into such great detail, you know, and I,

A.91:  That's what, I, I was impressed with how much documenting he does.

B.92:  It lost me.

A.93:  How much, how much, um, he's so much like Michener.  He's not as bad, in
terms of going into so much depth, but, he, he's, I like the way he rights.
And if it's not something that moves with me in the first two or three
chapters, something like that, I just won't keep it, you know.

B.94:  I can't, uh, I can't stay with it too long either.  But, that (( )) that I,
I read about fifty pages, and I just said, I can't take it.

A.95:  [Laughter] That's,

B.96:  I can't keep all these but-, you know, knobs, and dials and gauges that are
supposed to mean anything.  I don't want to, I can't understand them.

A.97:  And his action anecdotes weren't very good at all.  He, he, had, he jumps
around, in that particular book.  I don't know how his other ones are, but in
that one he jumped around a little bit --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- in terms of subways and just, just the general transition, and I mean
it, I didn't, you know, I really, you have to be interested in the subject
too.  I think that was part of my problem.

B.100:  There was just too much detail there for the, for the neophyte.

A.101:  Anything to be real interesting, yeah.  Well, it's good to talk to
somebody.  I don't read as much as I used to, um.  My husband's a T I -er, and
I'm in journalism, so I do a lot of writing.  But during the normal course of
my job, and it's kind of, um, sad when you find out the, you know, I thought I
would get more toward reading than I'm getting around (( )).

B.102:  Well, there's so many authors out now, though.  Of course, I've got several
favorites that I collect.  Eric van Lust-, Lustbader.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  he's got several out that I like, and, uh,

A.105:  Well what line does he write under, what title does he.

B.106:  He's got, he's kind of a mystic oriental.  Oh, he has one called THE 
NINJA --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and then, then MICHAEL, THE SIREN, BLACK HEART, 

A.109:  Ooh, that might be kind of interesting.  Is it,

B.110:  Yeah I think, uh, I think you'll enjoy him.  Uh, THE NINJA is of course,
THE NINJA and the MICHAEL are, you know, one and two of the volumes.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  And then he went off and wrote THE GEM, ZERO, THE FRENCH KISS, and several
others.  And THE WHITE NINJA has just hit paperback I understand.

A.113:  And does he, in terms of th-, in terms of their practices and, and their
culture, I mean, does he document it --

B.114:  Oh, yeah.

A.115:  -- or is it strictly,

B.116:  No, he's, no he's heavy into Japanese culture.

A.117:  Oh, okay.

B.118:  He's heavy into Japanese culture along with, uh, THE NINJA, THE ARTS OF
NINJA, and all the various, uh, marshal arts.

A.119:  Does he tell it in narrative form, or in third person.  How does he present
it?

B.120:  Uh, it fluctuates, you kind of get, uh, you get some flashbacks --

A.121:  Uh-huh.

B.122:  -- but you can really tell it's a flashback because the print goes to
italic.

A.123:  Oh, then you still get information too.

B.124:  And then you get information too, and it's kind of in a flashback, and it's
told, uh, more or less third person singular.

A.125:  Well, what's his name again?

B.126:  Eric van Lustbader,

A.127:  Van Lustbader,

B.128:  Yeah,

A.129:  Okay.

B.130:  Spelled as you would expect.

A.131:  Yeah, van Lust-,

B.132:  You know, van and then Lustbader, B A D E R,

A.133:  Lustbader, I'm going to write that one down, yeah, because.

B.134:  He's very interesting, I think you'll enjoy him.

A.135:  Looking for something different. Yeah, it's, you know, you walk into a
store and you just, like you said, you're overwhelmed by how much there is,
and you just, I don't know if you're like me.  You, you, you're much more
voracious in terms of how much reading you're doing, obviously, but I go in,
and I like, to me it's like being in a bakery, but then I just don't find
anything I like, I pick up like eighteen things, and then I'm not sure as I
walk out.

B.136:  Do you like, do you like kind of like the historical western (( ))?

A.137:  Uh, no, that's more, no that's not.  I do, actually I like Asian cultures,
that why I was surprised when you mentioned.

B.138:  uh, you'll, then you'll like O'Leary.  He's, he's quite good at it.  I've
got into one that I didn't think I would.  It's a, I'm not, it's a kind of a
historical Indian novel --

A.139:  Uh-huh.

B.140:  -- by Donald Colesmith called THE TRAIL OF THE SPANISH BIT, and it's called
THE SPANISH BIT SAGA.

A.141:  I thought that was, do you like Michener at all?

B.142:  Yeah.

A.143:  He's good, did you ever read, he wrote TEXAS a few years ago.

B.144:  Yeah, I read that one.

A.145:  That was good, and POLAND --

B.146:  Uh-huh.

A.147:  -- yeah, and I've done some of those.  Yeah, I like, I like things that
are, there's a few of the ones I can take of his.  I like it when they
actually are giving you information in a novel format, I guess would be th-,

B.148:  Try Colesmith, try and find his, uh, SPANISH BIT SAGA, it's called THE
TRAIL OF THE SPANISH BIT is the first,

A.149:  TRAIL OF THE SPANISH BIT.  Okay.

B.150:  Yeah.  By Donald Colesmith.

A.151:  Yeah.

B.152:  He's a, he's a professor of, of English in Emporia, Kansas --

A.153:  Uh-huh.

B.154:  -- and he's been a doctor and a gunsmith, and --

A.155:  Oh, my.

B.156:  -- all kinds of stuff.  And, uh, he, he writes, it's history from the
Indians point of view --

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  -- starting back when they first got the horse, when they first captured
the Spaniards, and it just kind of follows forward.  And I got hooked on it,
and there's like about sixteen or eighteen ...
