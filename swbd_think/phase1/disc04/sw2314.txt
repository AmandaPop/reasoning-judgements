============================================================

A.1:   [beep] Well, I, I don't think that it's, it's wrong for a
company to require drug testing for certain types of positions. 
For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things
like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their
own life and other people's lives.  

B.2:   Uh, I agree with that.  People that are, uh, driving --

A.3:   Uh-huh.

B.4:   -- like, uh, truck driver's and things like that.  I
definitely think they should be tested.  And I'm not, I'm not
opposed to any testing.  I mean because I know I certainly wouldn't
want to, to, uh, you know, be endangered by somebody in a company
that accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because
he was on drugs while he was there.  

A.5:   Yeah.  

B.6:   [lipsmack] Uh ...  

A.7:   Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug
testing prior to hiring?  

B.8:   Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company.  I think it's
kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states and, because I
don't know of any other countries that are doing this -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- and I, I feel like it's really just within the United
States.  It's, uh, it's okay.  I think your record should stand for
itself.  That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies
and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see
what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense --

A.11:   Uh-huh.

B.12:   -- of testing you over and over and over.  And once you've
established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if
your personality proves that you're not.  I think they could, uh,
save money by not doing that.  You know, every time, say if you
change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at
your other work place.  

A.13:   Well, what about random testing, though.  

B.14:   Oh. 

A.15:   Do you feel like that's an in-, invasion of certain people's
rights if not everyone is tested?  

B.16:   Uh, not if it's done fairly.  And that's probably my question
is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.  

A.17:   I don't know that you do.  If it's random, then it's 
random -- 

B.18:   Yeah.  

A.19:   -- and that's not necessarily fair.  

B.20:   Well, they might tell you it's random.  

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery.  Somebody
in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person
doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries.  

A.23:   Yeah.  

B.24:   You know.   

A.25:   Well, I ha-, I know that, for instance, in the N C double A,
they drug test and it's not random.  

B.26:   Oh, I see.  How'd, how did they, how do they pick their
people?  

A.27:   Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial
drug test at a certain point prior to the season -- 

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   -- and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have
something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the
coach's part of each in-, individu-, individual institution to
identify the ones that have the problem.  

B.30:   Oh, I see.  So, do you ... 

A.31:   And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a
certain period of time.  

B.32:   Right.  Well, do you think that should be implemented in the
work place.  You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or
has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should
have the right to send them --  

A.33:   Well, not being a --

B.34:   -- to be tested.

A.35:   -- drug user I don't have a problem with that personally -- 

B.36:   Right.  

A.37:   -- but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. 
If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's
causing them to h-, behave differently -- 

B.38:   Right.  

A.39:   -- and their manager assumes they have a drug problem -- 

B.40:   [laughter].  

A.41:   -- I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.  

B.42:   Right, right.  Yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, 
uh ... 

A.43:   It's an accusation, and, and it's -- 

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   -- and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how
a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal,
uh, you know.  

B.46:   And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up
negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using
drugs.  

A.47:   Right, exactly.  I, I don't, the, I think almost the only way
that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board
from, from the janitors to the executive management.  

B.48:   Right.  I agree with that.  Because I know personally myself,
I've been in the same job for three years, it will be three years
in August and I've already been drug tested three times.  

A.49:   What type of job do you have?  

B.50:   Well, I'm an environmental engineer -- 

A.51:   Uh-huh.  

B.52:   -- and I've been drug tested three times and I know many
people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the
company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus.  So see I, for
some reason, I've come up three times.  That's pretty high
statistics.  

A.53:   Well, does your r-, does your job require you to drive company
equipment or to ap-, operate any type of machinery that might --

B.54:   No.  

A.55:   -- endanger someone?  

B.56:   No, not at all.  

A.57:   Well, that doesn't, I mean I ... 

B.58:   It's a legal job, you know -- 

A.59:   Uh-huh.  

B.60:   -- so, see it's really strange.  

A.61:   That is odd.  I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have
now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the
job I had before, that, well, the job I have, have now, requested
my, uh, uh, [lipsmack] my, uh, medical record from my old
company -- 

B.62:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or
because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because
I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.  

B.64:   Right.  Well, does your, the company say, for instance, does
the company you worked for bef-, before have the right or do they
have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she
came up negative.  

A.65:   Well, no, I don't think they can, they can force another
company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I -- 

B.66:   Yeah.  

A.67:   -- didn't, I mean, they don't know that I don't use drugs. 
They just tested me once.  

B.68:   Right, right.  

A.69:   But, I used to work for a power company, so it was very
important that they make sure their employees, especially 
linemen -- 

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   -- uh, were clean.  

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I
guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly.
But I know they test most of the service people fairly 
regularly -- 

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   -- reg-, uh, just across the board.  

B.76:   Yeah.  And are they tested random?  

A.77:   No, they're, all of them are tested -- 

B.78:   They're  ... 

A.79:   -- once every three mo-, it's a rotation.  

B.80:   Oh, okay.  I see.  

A.81:   But it, but again, it depends on what job you're in.  

B.82:   Yeah.  

A.83:   The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
and the men that drive the trucks -- 

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   -- with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested
as much.  

B.86:   Uh-huh.  

A.87:   But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those
guys -- 

B.88:   Oh, I see.  

A.89:   -- what, what the drug testing schedule is.  They say we,
we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months
thereafter while you work here.  

B.90:   Uh-huh.  Okay, so they know that.  And that's ...  

A.91:   Yeah, it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.  

B.92:   Uh-huh.  Okay.  Well ... 

A.93:   Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?  

B.94:   Yeah -- 

A.95:   Okay.  

B.96:   -- I think so.  Yeah, seven twenty-five.  

A.97:   Okay.  

B.98:   Okay, nice speaking to you.  

A.99:   Nice talking to you.  Bye-bye 

B.100:   Bye.
