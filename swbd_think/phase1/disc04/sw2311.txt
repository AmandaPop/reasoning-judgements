==========================================================================

A.1:  This is like one of the worst topics I've had because I'm a terrible
dresser.

B.2:  Oh, really [laughter].

A.3:  I'm really not that bad of a dresser, but, um, where I work, um, it's very
casual dressing.

B.4:  Oh.

A.5:  So, I can wear jeans and, um, pretty much a sweater or even a T shirt to
work.

B.6:  Gee.  That's great.

A.7:  Yeah, well, we, I work in a manufacturing plant.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  So, we don-, I don't have to deal with customers or anything, but,

B.10:  Uh-huh.  Do you work during the day?

A.11:  No, actually I'm at work right now.  I work at night.

B.12:  Oh [sniffing].

A.13:  And I'm using this phone as one of my, you have to have two phones.  I'm
using one of these.

B.14:  Oh, I, that's a good idea.

A.15:  Yeah, well I sit here.  I'm taking a course, and I study when I star-, when
I read my course --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- while I'm trying to get through, so,

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  I just make a couple a night, though.

B.20:  Oh, so that's good.  Well, I, um, I work actually in a different sort of
environment.  I work in a, uh, personnel agency, [sniffing] a temporary
agency.  And so, for me, I'm always out with customers or with, uh, employees,
and I practically have to wear a suit every day.

A.21:  Oh, you see, that's, I almost wish I had a job like that so it would force
me to dress nice.

B.22:  Oh, really?

A.23:  Yeah --

B.24:  Well,

A.25:  -- because I can slough off, and then when it comes things out, or I go out
to dinner or something --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- or, or not, not so much going out to dinner, I have like three or four
dresses that I can wear.  Something like business interview.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I went for another job in a different company --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and it's like, I go right over to my [laughter] sister's house.  What do
you got to wear?

B.32:  Oh, well at least there's, you know, does she wear the same size.

A.33:  Yeah, and, it's, it's really convenient.  We're twins, too,

B.34: Oh no.

A.35: and so it works out [laughter].

B.36: that's great [sniffing].  Well,

A.37:  Yeah, she just had to change her whole wardrobe because she's going up,
like a management ladder.  And even though she still has to work, I mean, do
some, lot of physical work and adjust her machines --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- um, she still has to dress for success, as they say.

B.40:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.41:  So she went out and she changed her whole, her whole wardrobe.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  The, the thing that kills me is that we have dress down days
sometimes at work, you know --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- where can throw on jeans.  And I sor-, I can sleep an extra half an hour
if I don't have to get up and put on panty hose and fix the skirt and button
shirts and,

A.45:  That's true.  You know,

B.46:  You know, I just, I love it when I can get up and throw on sweats or just
throw on jeans and tie sneakers and, [sniffing] and I'm fine.

A.47:  I know, because, you know, even like, I ironed a shirt to come to work
tonight, you know, just a nice blouse, and if I had to wear it with a suit or
something --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- I would have had done a, a ten times better job.

B.50:  Right, plus ironing the suit on top of that, you know.

A.51:  Yeah, and it's, it's got to be more expensive [laughter].

B.52:  Yeah, right, that's true [sniffing] that's true.

A.53:  Yeah, but that's what's so hard when you, you have to deal with the public
or deal with the customers.

B.54:  Yeah, exactly.

A.55:  Like that, that business sui-, suit,

B.56:  When it comes to winter though, my, my goal is to stay warm,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  and I don't even care how I look.  I mean, I, I'll have a turtle neck
and then a sweater on top of that, and then a jacket [laughter] on top of
that.  I mean, I just, I get cold very, very easily, and so, um, I, I mean, I
don't even touch shoes when I'm outdoors.  I just wear #boots.#

A.59:  #Boots.#

B.60:  And like two pairs of socks, and,

A.61:  Do you have to, do you find that, you, you can, ar-, are you happy with
wearing dress slacks instead of dresses, because I know a lot of people dress
it's --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- dresses, dresses, they har-, hardly don't wear dress pants or anything,

B.64:  Right, well, I'll only do that on Fridays. 

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  Fridays are, you know, a little bit more relaxed day.

A.67:  All the girls that I know, I know a couple girls that work in insurance
offices --

B.68:  Yes.

A.69:  -- and that's all they wear, are dresses.  They hardly ever wear pants.

B.70:  Yes.

A.71:  Then on the weekends, you know, they wear their jeans --

B.72:  Oh, yeah.

A.73:  -- and their sweats.

B.74:  Me, too.

A.75:  But, they, uh, the pants just aren't dressy enough.  But in the wintertime
--

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- I think I would,

B.78:  Oh, it's really horrible.  Um, it, it got, Rochester gets so cold, that
sometimes I'll just have to wear like leggings until I get to work --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- and take them off, because it really, really does get cold.  But, um, I
would love a job where I didn't, I wouldn't be casual all the time, but I
didn't have to be dressy all the time, and I could wear more fun clothes.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  You know what I mean.

A.83:  Yeah, even, even here the secretaries, they usually dress nice.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  But it's not strange to seem them in jeans and a sweater.

B.86:  Oh, really?  [sniffing].

A.87:  So, and, you know, sometimes it is on Fridays --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- but in the summertime, if their going to, like I know a couple of the
girls, and this one lady goes camping a lot, and like every Friday she's --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- you know, she still does her same function and everything, but, uh,
normally she's dressed to the T, she's just perfect.

B.92:  And in the summer it's hard cause it's so hot, 

A.93:  Yeah well, 

B.94:  You just.

A.95:  we're fortunate here cause the building's, um, very, um, climate
controlled.

B.96:  Oh, that's great.

A.97:  But we work in an electronics field, and we, 

B.98:  [Sniffing]. 

A.99:  have to wear polyester smocks.

B.100:  Oh.

A.101:  So it's usually, um, a tank top in the summer --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to
being dressy, and polyester's terrible on me and I wear my silk under this
polyester, uh, smock and you just get so hot -- 

B.104:  I know.

A.105:  -- even though it's a nice temperature in here.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  So you really, in the summer time have to, we have to dress extra light
because we have to wear these smocks [laughter].

B.108:  Right, which is like adding another layer.

A.109:  Yeah, and in the winter time, pretty much just, uh, um even a turtleneck's
all right, because you have to wear these smocks.  A turtleneck and a sweater
and the smock would be too much.  It gets really hot.

B.110:  Uh-huh.  I know.

A.111:  So it's kind of weird.  When it's really cold, we, we come in, pretty much
we take our coat off and then we take our outside sweater off.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Trucking through the parking lot.

B.114:  Yeah, I know.

A.115:  [Laughter].

B.116:  Oh, gee.  Well, you know, it doesn't seem fair for, because guys, I mean, I
feel like all they have to do is change a tie --

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  -- and they've got a whole new outfit.

A.119:  But they still, they have to keep the pants really just,

B.120:  Well, that's true.  

A.121:  But.

B.122:  Yeah, they have to keep looking sort of clean and pressed.

A.123:  Yeah and their shirts have to be pressed --

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  -- so they still have the same thing here.  If they could dress casually,
it would take them less time, too, but,

B.126:  Yeah.  That's true.

A.127:  I know, it's great, I mean, just putting on a pair of panty hose can take
you an extra five minutes [laughter].

B.128:  I know, and then, you know, if you run one --

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  -- forget it.  You not only los-, you know, spend another four bucks, but,
you know, take that extra time, and, I mean, another thing that kills me is I
walk in heels all day, and I wear out the bottom of my shoes so quickly on the
pavement and, and I'm spending like, you know, instead of buying new shoes,
I'm always repairing them, and again, that's like four dollars each time to
bring in a pair of shoes and get new heels put on.

A.131:  Right, I know, um, even my dress shoes, I don't wear them a lot, I notice
the wear on the bottom of them.

B.132:  Uh-huh.  The nails start showing through and that sort of thing.

A.133:  And there's no way I could wear them all days.  

B.134:  Yeah.

A.135:  I would be one of the women in flats [laughter].

B.136:  [Laughter]  Well, I'm too short to wear flats.  If I wore,

A.137:  Well, I'm pretty short, but I have a very bad knee.  I couldn't --

B.138:  Oh.

A.139:  -- couldn't walk in heels all day.  When I go dancing, I (( )) stay on the
ball of my foot, hope that I --

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  -- don't slip on my heel, because if my, if I, if I came down on my heel
too much, my knee doesn't catch, and,

B.142:  Oh, jeez.  Oh, it must be painful.

A.143:  It's bad.

B.144:  Yeah.

A.145:  Well it's,

B.146:  Do you stand all day at your job, or,

A.147:  No we don't at all.  Um, we used to be a lot busier so, um, it used to be
important what you wore, if you're comfortable, because you knew you were
going to spend a lot of time working, and now it's very slow, and I pretty
much, I've taken a couple of courses and now, I sit at my desk, and I, and I
read, read my courses --

B.148:  Uh-huh.  That's great.

A.149:  -- I'm a technician, so I've taken a couple of technical courses plus I'm
going to take a couple of college courses.

B.150:  Uh-huh.

A.151:  Like, I've taken, um, some business courses --

B.152:  Uh-huh.

A.153:  -- just to, it gets boring to stay here [laughter].  Technical courses, 
learning about (( )) in computers,

B.154:  Good for you.

A.155:  Yeah.

B.156:  That's great.

A.157:  Yeah, this,

B.158:  Well, I'll be thinking of you dressing casually [laughter] at night when I
go to work.

@@A.159:  Okay, so do you think it's been five minutes?  See, I never time these.

B.160:  Oh, yeah.  It's, I, I was timing it because I came in, uh, it's been about
seven minutes.

A.161:  Oh, okay --

B.162:  Okay?

A.163:  -- so we can end our call?

B.164:  Yeah.

A.165:  Okay,

B.166:  Well, Linda, take care. It was really nice talking to you.

A.167:  Who knows, did, did you, have you ever gotten duplicate people?

B.168:  No, have you?

A.169:  No.  I, (( )) I'm almost afraid to get duplicate people.

B.170:  Oh, 

A.171:  I don't know why.

B.172:  That would be fun though.

A.173:  Okay.

B.174:  Pick up where you left off.

A.175:  Yeah.

B.176:  Alrighty --

A.177:  Okay, bye.

B.178:  -- take care.

A.179:  Yeah, you, too.

B.180:  Bye-bye.
