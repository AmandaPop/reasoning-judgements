========================================================================

A.1:  First and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two
percent straight across-the-board cut in federal spending in all departments.

B.2:  Now dealing on the federal level, 

A.3:  Yes.  

B.4:  two percent is a good choice, but as far as to increase tax revenues
coming in, you know, need to, redesigning of the entire tax structure itself.
Corporate America is getting away with bloody murder.  Where as people out
here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salary
into taxes.  The corporations are getting off easy, because they're actually
paying in less than five percent of their gross national product.

A.5:  Gross national product or profits?  

B.6:  Profit. Right.  

A.7:  Okay.  I'm not knowledgeable in that area.  So I can only agree with what
you're saying.

B.8:  If they made a straight across-the-board, everybody pay five percent, if
their gross national profit was say a million dollars then, pay five percent
of that.

A.9:  Huh-uh.  Seems fair to me [laughter].  Also individual level.

B.10:  But, the, um, overall it just seems like they've modified the tax laws so
bad, just the last five years, the rich, it's a definite case that the rich
are getting richer and the working people, middle class and, you know, the
lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire
burden.

A.11:  Huh-uh.  Well, I am awfully bored with, uh, every, every tax change, uh,
supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor, because I think we
have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor.  So
much graft and so much misspending that, that money doesn't necessarily go
where it's supposed to go.  Uh, I know you don't ever cutout greed and
corruption, but I think the management of the welfare dollar needs to come
back to the local levels, because the local people know exactly who needs
money and who doesn't need that money.  When it's directed from afar, I think
the chance for misspending is greater.  I, I suppose I'm thinking more in
terms, I'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes, I'm just thinking for a
quick fix, a cut in federal spending is, I guess, my solution.

B.12:  As long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks from
these different companies that are getting awarded for the ((defense
contracts)), that's never going to happen.

A.13:  I know [laughter].  Well, maybe that's what I'm saying.  As long as greed
and corruption is in there, how do we get away from that, though?

B.14:  The one thing that I had thought about to help correct that problem.
You've got career politicians that spend thirty, forty years in Washington.
That's all they have ever done.

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  After they've been there that long, they're so deep rooted with their, the
old boy network,

A.17:  Huh-uh.  

B.18:  I think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or
senator can hold, whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the
national level,

A.19:  Huh-uh.  

B.20:  limiting the two terms and then they have to sit out one.  

A.21:  I think that's wonderful.  When do we first, then start giving them their
lifetime income as a retired politician?

B.22:  I don't think we should ever give them a lifetime income, 

A.23:  But we do don't we?  

B.24:  Unfortunately. 

A.25:  Yes [laughter].  I know many people have said, well, if you throw
everyone out and start over, but then you, the amount of them who would be on
lifetime income is so stupendous, there, they have locked their benefits in to
the point that, once they've served two terms, they're on gravy train, anyway.
Yes.  I think your right.  I don't ever think we should give them a lifetime
thing.

B.26:  And they're the ones that have screamed so much about, that don't want to
increase taxes and they don't want to do this, but every year they vote
themselves in a very healthy pay raise.

A.27:  It, they speak with forked tongue, don't they.  

B.28:  [Laughter].  

A.29:  At least we're in agreement on that, aren't we [laughter].  I'm afraid I
have no other thoughts on fixes and I'm not sure that they would accept our
suggestions, anyhow.

B.30:  Eventually, it's going get to the point where there's going to be a
majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's finally come
to.  We're getting so far down to where you're being taxed, so far down where
you can't, even afford to change your mind.

A.31:  Huh-uh.  

B.32:  It's going to come to a point where the average American citizen is going
to say, we've had enough.

A.33:  How do they react then?  We're prosecuted if we simply do not pay our
taxes.  So I'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there will
be an overthrow.  We know communism doesn't work, what do we do next?

B.34:  Well, in the form of capitalism that we've got, apparently, that's not
working real good either.

A.35:  Uh, I heard someone, uh, supposedly an authority speaking on T V saying
that the interest rate, as we have known it in the past, will never be that
high again and he was speaking senior citizens living on their income from
interest , C D interest and that sort of interest.  I think the ((voting))
block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block, too, but every voting
block is slapped toward their own special interest.  And I think that makes it
doubly difficult to make a change.  I guess, I'm saying we're all selfish.

B.36:  Maybe not a case of everybody being selfish.  Everyman carry their own fair
burden, but not somebody else's.

A.37:  Yes.  That's true.  It doesn't seem to workout that way, though does it
[laughter].  I think the lobbyist it's, um, are so protecting what they have
in the budget, that it doesn't seem to work.  That everyman has to pay his own
fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're
doing because of the kickbacks and et cetera.  I'm a bit of a pessimist.  I
don't see a change in my lifetime, I'm a afraid.  You're younger perhaps you
can foresee one.

B.38:  I never put anything beyond, as far as, when it will happen, that I'm not
real sure of.

A.39:  Huh-uh.  

B.40:  If it will happen, I have no doubt.  

A.41:  Huh-uh.  Yes, I think you're right.  I'm just saying I don't think the
American people are, at this point, rebellious enough that it will happen in
my lifetime.  Yes, I think eventually the system will change.  I still think
we have the best system with the elected officials.  I, I'm not sure that, uh,
it's working right now though.

B.42:  It's the best system that's right now, but it does need some fine tuning at
this point.

A.43:  Absolutely.  Nice talk to go you.  

B.44:  Okay nice talk to you, too.  Bye.
