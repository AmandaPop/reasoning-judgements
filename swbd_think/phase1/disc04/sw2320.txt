=============================================================================

A.1:  Well Bonny,

B.2:  Yeah.  

@A.3:  How do you do your budget?  

B.4:  Well, we take the rent first, you know, we need to have a roof over our
head --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- and then we take the car, you know, we need a car to get back and forth
to work --

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- and then it's the utilities and then the food, uh, and then, uh, the
regular bills.  You know, your credit cards and your, uh --

A.9:  Utilities and stuff like that.  

B.10:  -- yeah.  

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  Uh, I, I'm, trying to think what else, phone, the pho-, utilities come
last, or, uh, before, let's see, the utilities come before the food and the
bills.  The, uh, credit card, you know, the, credit cards and what else is
there that we pay, you know, we got loans --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- things like that, they come before the, uh, uh, they come after
everything else.

A.15:  Huh.  

B.16:  They are last on it because, you know, uh, they-, they're never late, but,
they're the least, uh, b-, uh, bothersome to us.  You know, uh, we need a roof
and all that before we need anything else.

A.17:  Yeah, I kind of think you ought to make, make them wait until the last
possible minute for it.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  We do ours, uh, fairly similar.  Course, uh, we both have married before
and so what, what we do is kind of divide up the bills --

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- based on who makes the most money and whoever makes the most money,
course, takes the most, you know, the biggest part of the bills.

B.22:  Yeah, well, I'm a homemaker myself  -- 

A.23:  Uh.  

B.24:  -- so he, he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the
way it should be and, or the way, whatever way we can.   

A.25:  I wish we could do that.  Unfortunately, between two divorces, it kind of,
it kind of taps you out pretty good.

B.26:  I can imagine.  I, uh, you know, I haven't gone through a divorce myself.
I've only been married once, but, uh, I know a lot of people that have and a
lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that.

A.27:  Oh, yeah.  It, that takes a big hunk out of your budget.  

B.28:  Yeah, I bet.  

A.29:  It costs me about, uh, three thousand dollars a year for child support.
Which is after, I mean, that's net.  That's right after I pay the taxes and
stuff on it.

B.30:  Well, that's better than having them living with you.  

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  Because they are more expensive right there day in and day out.

A.33:  That's what I hear, although, although I kind of miss some of that stuff.

B.34:  Yeah, I bet you do.  

A.35:  Yeah, but, you know, you know, bills wise, uh, we kind of divide everything
up and I take, I take the bigger portion of it and, uh, my wife takes some of
hers, and we have an agreement that, uh, if we're going to charge anything
over, like, seventy-five or eighty dollars, then we, uh, we talk about it.

B.36:  Yeah, oh, well, me and my hu-,

A.37:  Unless, of course, it's, uh, it's like for a present or whatever.

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  And we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here.  

B.40:  [Laughter] I love it when my husband decides to say, fudge with the budget,
and, uh, sneak a big gift in.

A.41:  Yeah, I, uh, I was trying to finagle our budget around because, uh, my wife
wanted, she really wanted a little small five inch T V she could carry around
the house or, you know, back in her sewing room whenever she's watching --

B.42:  I've got one of them.  

A.43:  -- television, and she wanted one so bad, and we were just kind of short on
money.  And so all through the year I, I was putting, you know, five or ten
dollars back, fifteen, twenty, whatever I could spare, I was putting back in a
little envelope in there.  I was hanging onto it.  I thought, God, you know,
come Christmas time, we're going to have that television set come hell or high
water --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- and sure enough we got it.  

B.46:  Well, uh, my mother-in-law gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago.  I
don't think it's five inches.  I think it's a little bit bigger than that, but
it runs on, uh, car batteries and --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- you know, stick it in the lighter -- 

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  -- and runs on regular batteries and electricity.  So, it's a neat little
thing to have.

A.51:  How, how do you, d-, uh, you just divide up your, uh, the money just, you
just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there, huh.

B.52:  Uh, well, they, we have direct deposit.  That helps a lot.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Uh, and, uh, [noise] first thing he does is we get out our clipboard, we
got everything on a clipboard --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- from now for three months ahead and, uh, you know, he makes the same
amount every week, uh, he's not, it's not salary, he gets paid by the hour,
but we know exactly --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then
it's, uh, you know, that's extra, uh, but, he's got us situated to where we
pay, uh, pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and
then all the little ones at the middle of the month.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  And, uh, none of them's ever been late, you know, the ones that come in the
middle of the month are early, you know, we pay them like two weeks ahead of
time --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- and, uh, it works out real well.  Uh, most problem we had was when, uh,
let's see, when was it, something like we had a three p-, uh, weekends, uh,
you know, it was a late, uh, uh, the long pay period --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- and, uh, we was close to being, uh, oh, shoot, I'm trying to think, it's
been so long.  Uh, it was when he was in the military and, uh, it was
something like four weeks in between pay periods, and it really blew
everything away.  Uh, we was close to being late on a lot of stuff.  And so
that was pretty bad, but, I don't know, I like that he's got it mapped out in
the, uh, on the clipboard.

A.65:  [Laughter] He's got a stable schedule, then.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  Everything kind of works out well.  

B.68:  Yeah, pretty much.  Uh, with the direct deposit, that's what helps, you
know, because he doesn't have the money in hand.

A.69:  Yeah, if, if, if you don't have to go down to the bank for something, you
can kind of put it in there.  If you have the tendency to go to the bank, you
kind of, well, I'll take five or ten dollars here.

B.70:  Oh, well he's, he's, we got that A T M machine and that, and his bank is
right there at his work.

A.71:  Oh. 

B.72:  And that's hard, you know, uh, I'm sure you're k-, familiar with T I up
here.

A.73:  Oh, yeah.  

B.74:  And, you know, how they got the Tex-, uh --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- that Texins Credit Union.  

A.77:  Tex Tower, yeah.  

B.78:  Right there, he, uh, he's good at, uh, getting into that, but, he's g-,
he's, you know, we never, in my, I-, I've been married to him for seven years,
and we've never had a check bounce.

A.79:  That's good.  

B.80:  And, uh, well, no, I take that back.  One time we did.  Uh, it didn't
bounce, but it came close.  We called our landlord and asked her to hold off
on check-, cashing the check for three days.  [laughter] We was overdrawn six
dollars.

A.81:  That's not too bad.  That -- 

B.82:  So,

A.83:  -- that's cutting it pretty close, though.  

B.84:  Yeah [noise], but, uh, it was, I don't know, we've never, he, we've had
problems meeting our bills before, but, uh, we've met them.

A.85:  Well, I think everybody has problems meeting bills now.  Not too much you
can do about it.  Between the taxes and everything else, everything goes up
faster than the salary does.

B.86:  Yeah, that's what's going to hurt us in April, uh, we owe on our taxes and
that will hurt.

A.87:  Oh, yeah, so do we.  

B.88:  And, yeah that's taking money that we didn't have, you know, that we had
set aside --

A.89:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.90:  -- for, uh, a bill or two, and we're trying to finagle now getting ready
for it because we got to pay them by April.

A.91:  Yeah, they want their money real quick.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  That's the bad part.  We got the same problem.  However, I guess it, uh,
beats the alternative.  Just not having anything to start out with.

B.94:  Yeah.  Well, I know how it is to start out with nothing.  Uh, you know.

A.95:  Oh, yeah.  

B.96:  And, uh, I'm, we're up to where, close to where we want to be but we're not
quite there yet.

A.97:  Well you get, if you just keep trying, pretty soon you make it.

B.98:  Yeah, I just k-, I just think that I, it would help a lot if I got a job,
but then I'd rather be with my kids.

A.99:  Well, you know, kids are important.  You got, you have to stay home with
the kids.

B.100:  Yeah, well, you know, I've got a two year old and a four year old, and, 
uh,

A.101:  Well, soon as they get to school, it won't be so bad.  

B.102:  Yeah.  But, I know it would help with the bills.  

A.103:  Well, Bonny, it sounds like a pretty good idea.  

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  Tell you what, uh, I think we about done our about five minutes.

B.106:  Okay.  Well, it was nice talking to you.  

A.107:  Okay, we'll check you later.  

B.108:  All right, bye-bye.  

A.109:  Bye-bye.
