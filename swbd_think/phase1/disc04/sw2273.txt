A.1:  Hi Phil.   

B.2:  How you doing?

A.3:  Pretty good.  How many children did you say you had?   

B.4:  I have three.  I didn't say, I,   

A.5:  Wow.   

B.6:  I have three of them. 

A.7:  You have three children?   

B.8:  Yeah, two, uh, 

A.9:  Boys?  Girls?   

B.10:  I have, the girl is the oldest and then two boys.   

A.11:  I have, uh, three as well, uh.  Mine are, uh, uh, twenty-five, twenty-four,
and twenty-one.  The numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember
[laughter].

B.12:  Yeah.  Well you're doing a lot better than I can.  I can't rattle them off
like that.

A.13:  [Laughter].   

B.14:  I know my youngest is eighteen.  He's, uh, as I said in, a senior in high
school and I have a, uh, my oldest son, he's, uh, out seeing the world right
now.  He's in Australia --

A.15:  Wow.   

B.16:  -- at the present time [laughter].  

A.17:  So you don't get a chance to, to spend much time with him, then, until when
he comes home.

B.18:  Well, he's, yeah, he's been gone for about seven months now.  We're
expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer.

A.19:  Wow.   

B.20:  Hopefully.   

A.21:  I, uh, unfortunately didn't spend e-, enough time with my children.  Uh,
where I, I had a lot of things that I thought that I needed to do that were
more important than, than spending time with my children.  In fact, when they
were younger --

B.22:  Ouch. 

A.23:  -- uh, I was attending school -- 

B.24:  Yeah. 

A.25:  -- and then I found myself short of cash, so I, uh, also went in for a
part-time job, so by the time that I got home after my second job --

B.26:  Um.   

A.27:  -- [Lipsmack] children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed
[breathing] and the only time that I got to see them was on weekends and on
weekends I had to do my homework, so [laughter] --

B.28:  Yeah.   

A.29:  -- it, uh, it, you know, it took away a lot of, of time from them.

B.30:  Uh. 

A.31:  We did go out to, you know, to the places that you typically take children
to and we had a lot of fun, but it seems as though the time went by so fast
that, that I, I didn't really enjoy it as much as I could have if I worked at
it a little harder.

B.32:  I'll bet that story's all too common.  I, uh,  

A.33:  It's, it's unbelievable how fast, you know, when, when you get to the point
where even your kid's age, they don't want to spend time with you anymore.

B.34:  Yeah, they sure --  

A.35:  And, you know, I, I --  

B.36:  -- develop their own interests [laughter].   

A.37:  -- can, I can remember when my children used to beg me to go with, you
know, even to take them to the store or take them someplace and, and it just
gradually goes away until you have to ask them, do you want to come with me
and then they start saying, no, so [laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] It can be pretty sudden, too.   

A.39:  [Laughter]  Well, I, it's not sudden, it's just that it probably doesn't
hit the average person, uh, until it hits them over the head.

B.40:  Yeah, maybe so.   

A.41:  Because you ex-, --  

B.42:  Uh [laughter].   

A.43:  -- because even, even my oldest, uh, child when he comes, uh, comes to the
house, he's still, he's still my, my, my, child and, and I don't think of him
as an adult yet and --

B.44:  Yeah.   

A.45:  -- uh, that, that's one of his complaints.   

B.46:  I don't think I, uh, I would have to say I probably didn't get to spend as
much time as I would have liked to, either.  Uh, however I didn't, you know,
uh, early on I was in the retail business and I worked late hours, so --

A.47:  Uh-huh.   

B.48:  -- I saw less of them then, but then when I changed over and got into
electronics industry, I, uh, I did have more time and I tried to spend some
more time with them.  And, uh, you know, we did things as a family, we went
camping quite a bit and we, uh, you know, took trips, went to see my folks in
Florida and some of those kind of things.

A.49:  So you had a bunch of kids in the car.   

B.50:  Yeah.   

A.51:  That must have been, [laughter] that must have been fun [laughter].

B.52:  We did, we did quite a bit of that.  Just traveling and we had several
Volkswagen buses there for a period of time in our later years then we did,
when we were camping and stuff and that made it a little easier.

A.53:  Well, camping -- 

B.54:  Or a station wagon. 

A.55:  -- is one thing that I, I could never get used to.  Uh, I, I used to take
the kids to go fishing and things like that --

B.56:  Uh-huh. 

A.57:  -- but I never went, uh, never went camping.   

B.58:  That may be the difference in our part of the country we live in.  It's a
lot easier to get out, outside all year round, uh, well, pretty near all year
round out here.

A.59:  Yeah.  Yeah, up in, uh, New England it's, uh, uh, you know, three or four
or five months tops.  After that, you're in the house [laughter],

B.60:  [Laughter]. 

A.61:  because it becomes so cold out here that -- 

B.62:  Yeah. 

A.63:  -- uh, and sometimes the weather gets to you, so you don't want to go
outside and drive around.

B.64:  I guess, uh, I can think of a, uh, things I would like to have done
differently on, uh, on the kids, though.

A.65:  Well, I can think of, of some enjoyable things that, that I did with the
kids.  Like we used to go up to, uh, New Hampshire quite a bit, and go to the,
uh, uh, the White Mountains area and, and visit all the, you know, the nature
trails and things like that.

B.66:  Uh-huh. 

A.67:  But I wouldn't sleep on the ground.  I went into a hotel [laughter].

B.68:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.69:  But I used to take the kids to, uh, [lipsmack] you know, the things like,
uh, places where there are animals --

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  -- and you go in and, and feed the animals and things like that --

B.72:  Oh, yeah.   

A.73:  -- and, uh,  

B.74:  Petting zoos and things.   

A.75:  Yeah.  Hey, you know, and the, and the kids used to enjoy that as well and
I like children.  In fact, uh, one of the things that I notice a dramatic
change was that, that, uh, like if I'd be in a supermarket and I'd see a cute
little kid [throat_clearing] I wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on
the head.

B.76:  Uh-huh.   

A.77:  Well, as time grew by, and I think I had my daughter with me one time and
she went strolling away and I saw this kid and I patted her on the head and
the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away, you know,
[laughter] pulled the kid,

B.78:  [Laughter].  

A.79:  and I, and I turned around and I realized my daughter wasn't there
anymore so all she saw was a --

B.80:  Oh, yeah.   

A.81:  -- an adult standing there patting her kid on the head --  

B.82:  Oh oh.   

A.83:  -- so I, I [laughter], I didn't realize it until after, uh, you know, after
it all happened what, what the, uh, ((sort of person)) uh.  It was, uh, really
something.

B.84:  Our kids played, uh, ball.  It wasn't, it was like, you know, Little 
League --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- and, uh, it was Dads, Oaks Dads Club.  Which was a, like a Little
League.

A.87:  You attend a lot of the games?

B.88:  Yeah, we used to go to the games and we had, uh, I never did actually
coach.  I'd go do some of the sideline stuff --

A.89:  Uh-huh.   

B.90:  -- and like that, but I never did actually coach.  But they tried to get me
to do that.  I, but we'd go, you know, and watch them practice and, and, uh,
pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing.

A.91:  Did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons?

B.92:  [Lipsmack] Uh, I personally don't believe I did, no.  For one reason
being, like I mentioned, I was in retail when she was younger --

A.93:  Uh-huh.   

B.94:  -- and then, you know, she, being a girl, I guess she probably, uh, spent a
lot of time with her mother, more so than with me.

A.95:  Yeah, I, I, uh, I felt that, myself, as I, as I grew older, my child grew
older that I realized that I didn't spend half as much time with my daughter
as I did my sons because [breathing], uh, I'd want to do the things that I
thought that they would like to do --

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- and it would always be the things that I wanted to do.  Without
realizing it, you know --

B.98:  Oh, yeah.   

A.99:  -- things like, uh, you know, fishing and, and doing out-, things outside
and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more
time with her mother than --

B.100:  Yeah.   

A.101:  -- uh, than with myself and I think, uh, she's closer to her mother today
than, than she is to me because of that.

B.102:  Yeah.  That's probably the same case in our family, too.   

A.103:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's unfortunate because, you know, e-, even though you, you
think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them
without even realizing it.

B.104:  Yeah.  A lot of cases, daughters get, get real close to their dads, too,
you know, and, uh,

A.105:  Yeah, well, she was close, but, yet whenever I wanted to do something,
[laughter] it was always something, some --

B.106:  Yeah.   

A.107:  -- thing different than what she wanted to do.   

B.108:  Yeah.   

A.109:  Uh, I spent a lot of time with her when I was home.  Uh, she'd always be
the one, you know, sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys
would be off, uh, uh, playing someplace.  But it seems like whenever I wanted
to do something like go out [throat_clearing] for the kids and, uh, she'd
always say, well, I want to go to my girlfriend's house or I want to stay home
and do this or she had, like, little projects she was working on at home and
things like that.  So I, I kind of missed that.  Uh, I, my daughter
especially.  Uh, being with her.

B.110:  Is your daughter the, uh, oldest?   

A.111:  No, she's the, the second oldest.   

B.112:  Oh.  

A.113:  She's, uh --  

B.114:  Middle child.   

A.115:  -- twenty, twenty-three now.   

B.116:  You, uh, you, have you ever heard much about that theory about the, uh, you
know, how their different, their, their position in the family relates to
their, uh, char-, you know, some of their --

A.117:  Personality traits, and things like that.   

B.118:  -- mannerisms and personality, yeah.   

A.119:  Uh, no, I can't say that I have.   

B.120:  Yeah, I believe it's true.  It's my experiences, uh, what I know about it
and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's
children, too, it's, uh, you know, the older kid is, uh, is more, always more
prone to be more, like responsible --

A.121:  Uh-huh.   

B.122:  -- and that kind of thing.   

A.123:  Yeah, I think you force it on them [laughter].   

B.124:  [Laughter] Yeah, it is a natural development.  I think it, 

A.125:  And, and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled.

B.126:  Yeah, and, uh, in our case, he's real sensitive and real, uh, thoughtful
and, uh,

A.127:  The youngest one is more sensitive?   

B.128:  Yes.   

A.129:  That's, same with my family.   

B.130:  I don't know if,  

A.131:  And it's --  

B.132:  Yeah.   

A.133:  -- it's strange.   

B.134:  I don't know if that relates to that or not but,    

A.135:  [Laughter].  

B.136:  [Laughter].  

A.137:  Well, it just so happens that my youngest is, uh, extremely sensitive, uh,
where my oldest one, uh, you know, I can scream at him and yell at him and --

B.138:  My oldest.   

A.139:  -- he'll look at me with, with,  

B.140:  Yeah, my oldest daughter is hard headed,   

A.141:  [Laughter].  

B.142:  as can be.  

A.143:  But, if I say the wrong thing to my youngest son, he, he will, he won't cry
anymore, because he's too old, but he gets hurt.  He bruises --

B.144:  Yeah. 

A.145:  -- very easily  --  

B.146:  Right, uh-huh.   

A.147:  -- and, and I can feel that [laughter].  

B.148:  That's Matthew.  He's, it's, boy, uh, he was always, he just, he'd keep it
to himself a lot of times --

A.149:  Yep.   

B.150:  -- but, he'd really kind of well up and be ready to cry over there.

A.151:  [Laughter].   

B.152:  He's gotten now to where he can take it better.  He'll dish it back a
little bit.

A.153:  I remember when I first took my kids out, uh, fishing, and, again, I was
with my two sons and not with my daughter, but, uh, no, I was with my oldest
son.  Uh, my youngest son wasn't old enough or I didn't think he was old
enough to take out, and, uh, uh, we caught this fish.  It was, uh, it was a
fairly large size fish and he was very, very proud it of.  He put it on the
back seat on the floor and it was waggling around and we, we came home and he,
uh, he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and
he wanted to put it in the bathtub so,

B.154:  [Laughter]. 

A.155:  [Laughter] She told him no he couldn't do it,

B.156:  [Laughter]. 

A.157:  but he did it anyway.   

B.158:  Um. 

A.159:  Fill the water, filled the bathtub full of water and, uh, uh, put the fish
in it.  Now after the fish died from being handled so much --

B.160:  Uh-huh.   

A.161:  -- uh, we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool
[laughter].

B.162:  [Laughter].  

A.163:  So after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back, uh, to life again,
we went out there and they buried it --

B.164:  Uh-huh.   

A.165:  -- and, uh, you know, we did it together --  

B.166:  Yeah.   

A.167:  -- and, I, I come in the house and I wash my hands and I turn around and I
did something and I saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and
I went out there, said, what are you doing.  He said I wanted to show my
friend the fish that I caught [laughter].

B.168:  [Laughter].   

A.169:  So he's out there digging it up [laughter].   

B.170:  Yeah, that was, I'm sure it was a powerful experience for him.

A.171:  Yeah, well, it was his first fish.   

B.172:  It's something he'll remember.   

A.173:  He didn't, he didn't want to hide it.  He wanted everybody,
