========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.   

B.2:  Oh, (( )).  Oh, it's, I think it's almost as bad as religion, talking to
somebody about gun control.

A.3:  [Laughter].  

B.4:  (( )) everybody has such ideas on it.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  What do you feel about it?  

A.7:  Um, I think there should be some control, but on the same hand, I think you
should be able to, like, and some places I think you should be allowed to
carry guns.

B.8:  Really.  Are you from a big city?  

A.9:  No.  I'm not.  Well, I'm kind of, I'm like two hours north of Pittsburgh,

B.10:  Oh.  

A.11:  And there's, sometimes I won't go down there at night, you know,

B.12:  Oh, ((no kidding)).  

A.13:  No.  And my fiancee is about an hour from D C, 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  and you wouldn't catch me, 

B.16:  Oh, no.  

A.17:  dead down there.   

B.18:  No.  No.  

A.19:  No.  

B.20:  I tend to agree with you there.  {Voice is muffled}. I, I think, I think
automatic weapons, is, it's kind of ridiculous if there's not some kind of
control on those,

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  because there's no reason to have automatic,

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  I mean, I mean deer hunters do not use automatic weapons.  

A.25:  Exactly.  

B.26:  You can't tell me, 

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  That they're good for anything,  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  but, but for killing people.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  But, um, you can't take gun, you can't put total control because the
government, the law abiding citizens won't turn, will turn them in and the
criminals won't [laughter].

A.33:  Exactly.  Yeah.  

B.34:  So it's a real messy subject.   

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36: It, it, there just doesn't seem to be any good solution.  Even though I do
think that the, uh, the, what is it, seven day waiting period to checkup on
you, (( )) for buying a handgun begun is a really good idea. , that they're
trying to push through Congress right now, but I, I don't think they'll ever
get it done.

A.37:  [Laughter].  

B.38:  I, I just really don't think they will.  You know, what, what, what is
going to hurt a waiting period.  So, you know, for an F B I checkup to see if
your not a mass murderer or something.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  I don't think that's going to hurt anything.

A.41:  No.  

B.42:  No, but, but I agree with you.  Um, because I live just north of Dallas.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  And this place in Dallas is a mess.  We moved out of Dallas last year.  My
husband was transferred up here, north of Dallas, and to uh, McKinney is a
much smaller town.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And it's about, oh, forty-five minutes north.  And, uh, Dallas is a mess.
I mean it just, it's one of the top crime, I mean, it may be.  It was the
number one crime.

A.47:  Oh, really.  

B.48:  Yes.  Last year.  

A.49:  Oh.  I didn't even know that.  

B.50:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's bad.  And, and well, in certain parts of town it's
bad [laughter].

A.51:  Yeah.  Well, that's the way it is, I think, anywhere.  

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  Because like this in D C, like my fiancee said, like, um, he went to the
doctors one time, and it was located in D C,

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  and he had to park his car.  And his car was like two blocks away from
the clinic,

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  and the clinic had someone escort him to his car.  

B.58:  Oh.  

A.59:  because it got dark.  It was after sunset.  

B.60:  Oh, my.  Now, that's frightening.  

A.61:  Yeah. That's, that's just ridiculous, you know [laughter]. 

B.62:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.63:  I mean, that's just down right ridiculous.  And I know driving through
Pittsburgh, we got lost down there one time, and we were trying to come home
and, um, we went through this one section and there were, you know, all the
people standing on the corner and stuff,

B.64:  Oh, yeah. {There is a lot of noise in the background}. 

A.65:  and I was just like, wind up my window, 

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  lock my door [laughter].  

B.68: [Laughter].

A.69:  You know, I mean, it was like, don't you dare stop [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter].  

A.71:  I don't care if there's a red light.  

B.72:  [Laughter] (( )).  {Speaker is laughing and talking at the same time}.
There's a saying down here, all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost
[laughter].

A.73:  [Laughter].  

B.74:  It seems like when you first you're trying to find your way around, you
seem to end up in the bad part of town no matter what direction your going.
[laughter].  But, it's, sirens are just going on all the time.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  You just, people in the, every once in awhile you here (( )), was that a
gun, was that a gun.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  I hope not, but it sure did sound like it.  

A.79:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Like I would call my fiancee and, well, he moved now so
he's in a much nicer area,

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  but he lived like twenty minutes out of downtown D C,  

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  and I would be talking to him on the phone and I could hear sirens and I
could hear yelling and screaming and I'm like, what's going on and he'd go to
the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk.

B.84:  [Laughter].  

A.85:  And I'm like, 

B.86:  Oh, gosh.  

A.87:  And the thing was, he lived on the ground floor of the apartment
building.  And I was just like would you please move.

B.88:  Oh, oh.  

A.89:  [Laughter] Just get out of there.  Please.  I mean, I just don't think it's
safe.

B.90:  Yeah.  We, we don't own any guns.  

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  But, uh, the temptation has been there, you know, 

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  to go out and get something for protection, because as many break-ins and
stuff as there are, I mean, and they just don't stop with breaking in, usually
they will kill you,

A.95:  Uh-huh.   

B.96:  for, for twenty dollars.  

A.97:  Exactly.  Yeah.  

B.98:  So it's, it's a frightening situation.  

A.99:  Yeah.  Well, um, I come from a large family, 

B.100:  Do you.  

A.101:  and all my brothers hunt, so we have hunting guns.  

B.102:  Oh, yeah.  

A.103:  but they're always locked up at all times.  

B.104:  Oh, yes.  

A.105:  Other than when they're being used and even like whenever, you know, like,
like if three of them are out hunting and there's still three guns left, it's
still locked.  You know,

B.106:  Uh-huh.  Oh. 

A.107:  it's locked all the time.  But, as far as having anything else to protect
ourselves, we don't have anything.  You know,

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  other than maybe a butcher knife,  

B.110:  [Laughter].  

A.111:  that's up on the wall.  You know, 

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  And what's your chances of getting to it, or something, 

B.114:  Yeah, and in a situation like that, you know, your reflexes aren't good,
your senses aren't good.  {There is a lot of noise in the background},

A.115:  Uh-huh.  

B.116:  I'd be, you just don't know what you'd do.  

A.117:  Yeah.  But, I know, my, um, roommate, she's from (( )) and that's right out
of Pittsburgh,

B.118:  Uh-huh.  

A.119:  and her father is a state policeman and she has mace, 

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  you know, even to carry like, I'm, I'm at college so,

B.122:  Yeah.  

A.123:  Even for her, when she goes out at night, if her and I are out, like, if we
walk to another building or something, we always take the mace with us.

B.124:  Oh, yeah.  

A.125:  You know, just because, you know, two girls walking.  But, her mom sells
real state,

B.126:   Uh-huh.  

A.127:  so her mom has a gun in her purse, 

B.128:  Oh, my.  

A.129:  ((at all times)), because she has to pick up strangers, you know,

B.130:  That's true.  

A.131:  that, you know, people that you've never met and take them to these
houses and they're in her car.  So, she, he taught, he has three daughters, he
taught all three daughters and his wife how to shoot.

B.132:  Yeah.  

A.133:  And I can very well see his point.  

B.134:  Yeah.  Being close, as close as to it, to a situation as he is,

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  I can, I can see why he would.  And anybody ought to know how, how to
shoot a gun.

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  And, and, you know, just in case.  I never have, but, um, my husband's
family has always had guns, hunting guns,

A.139:  Uh-huh.  

B.140:  and antique weapons.  (( )) he can shoot a muzzle loader real good.

A.141:  [Laughter]. 

B.142:  But, um, that, um, but I have a two year old and one on the way, and that,
that, it bothers, it would make me really nervous to have a gun in the house.

A.143:  Uh-huh.  

B.144:  I'd rather, even if it was locked up, it would really make me nervous.

A.145:  Uh-huh.  

B.146:  Oh.

A.147:  (( )), you know, and some, you know, I think that like when, whenever I
graduate, I'll be moving to where my fiancee is,

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  and I'll definitely want to have something if were a half-hour away from
D C.

B.150:  Oh, yeah.  

A.151:  You know. 

B.152:  I would, too.  

A.153:  But then again, you know, you would always keep it locked up or something.
Then, you know, what is the sense of keeping it locked up because, then, if
something would happen, are you going to have time to actually go and unlock
it,

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  you know.  And you, you hate keeping something laid out like that.

B.156:  I know.  I had a college professor that went, I went to school in Missouri,
that's where we're from.  And he went to D. C.  on a conference, a big
conference.  He's a political science professor and he got kidnapped outside
of a deli and was taken to, taken to another part of down and stabbed and left
for dead.

A.157:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.158:  But he recovered, and, I mean, in an amazing amounts time.  He was stabbed.
(( )) the semester was over and he was,

A.159:  Oh, my God.  I just don't, people are sick for doing that. 

B.160:  Yeah.  They robbed him, it was a robbery.  

A.161:  They just wanted his money.  

B.162:  They just wanted money because he was a college professor.  He looked, you
know, like he had money and, oh, they really did, worked on him.

A.163:  Uh-huh.  

B.164:  It was sad.  

A.165:  Yeah.  

B.166:  I mean, it was, was horrible.  

A.167:  (( )) iffy situation.  I think people should be allowed to protect
themselves.

B.168:  Yeah.  

A.169:  But then, you know, or, you know, so many families, you don't want to let a
gun out, because accidents do happen.

B.170:  Oh, oh, yes.  And it's always children, 

A.171:  Uh-huh.  

B.172:  that it happens seems like.  

A.173:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Like I had a neighbor and he got shot in the stomach with a
gun.  And to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded.

B.174:  [Laughter].  

A.175:  And I just cannot get that. Now, obviously, the gun was loaded.

B.176:  Yes, obviously [laughter].  

A.177:  You know.  But to this day, they swear the gun was not loaded.

B.178:  Well, 

A.179:  I'm just like, well (( )),   

B.180:  Well, what's their explanation, then.  

A.181:  I'm just like, well, then, where did his stomach go, you know,

B.182:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.183:  [Laughter] I mean, he survived, you know, but he was wacky and that's all
there was to it.

B.184:  Yeah.  Yes, very wacky.  

A.185:  Uh-huh.  I, I just think it was an iffy situation.  

B.186:  It's because, um, you can't, you need,

A.187:  Uh-huh.
