===========================================================================

A.1:  All Right.  Ladies, first.  

B.2:  Oh, no.  Well, I don't find a lot of time to watch T V.  And a lot of time,
I find it during the day when, when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep, so I
watch a lot of reruns, old shows,

A.3:  (( )). 

B.4:  Like DICK VAN DYKE, all those old crazy shows.  

A.5:  Barney Fife, I guess.  

B.6:  Yeah [laughter].  I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. 

A.7:  Well, some-, so your a homemaker?  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  I guess, that's, the right term nowadays.  

B.10:  Yeah.  I guess so.  Yeah, I am.  I stay home with two kids. 

A.11:  Yeah.  My wife, we have a new one in the house and she stays home, too,
also.

B.12:  Huh-uh.  

A.13:  Um, I guess, I have a wide variety.  I like watching the T V for things
that are interesting, not so much the bor-, things that aren't, for example,
like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time,

B.14:  Huh-uh.  

A.15:  and DIFFERENT STROKES.  But I like SIXTY MINUTES, 

B.16:  Huh-uh.  

A.17:  PRIME TIME LIVE.  Of course, I have to watch cartoons on Saturday
morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES.  I like the old-timey ones,

B.18:  [Laughter].  

A.19:  TOM AND JERRY.  

B.20:  Yeah.  You sound like my husband.  

A.21:  There you go.  

B.22:  He likes TOM AND JERRY and, uh, BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS.

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  And all those guys.  

A.25:  JOHNNIE QUEST.  (( )) the good ones.  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Um, now if I'm ever home during the, during the day on a vacation day, I
have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually,

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  because he's just, he's one of my idles.   

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  And then, uh, but I don't know, it seems like nowadays everything is so
electronic, you know, magnified and animated,

B.32:  Huh-uh. 

A.33:  that you can grab from the old style movies and old style 
shows a little bit more insight to family groupings.  

B.34:  Huh-uh.  

A.35:  And so, uh, now ((I do,)) with the COSBY SHOW, I have seen it a couple of
times and, I do, I like the show.  I just don't watch it.

B.36:  Yeah. 

A.37:  Because of the timing, but, uh, some of the crap that's on T V nowadays,

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  it's ((about)).  I do watch the special shows that they come out with,
the NOVA stuff.  And, and,

B.40:  Yeah.   

A.41:  the nature shows.  

B.42:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.43:  But, I think there's enough out there to pick from.  I'm not, we don't have
cable to the point of, of the H B O or any of that stuff.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  Yeah.  But, uh, 

B.46:  Well, I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for
children.  Because,

A.47:  Huh-uh.  

B.48:  with two kids and, you know, I don't want them watching something that I
don't think they should watch or, 

A.49:  Sure.  

B.50:  I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN, 

A.51:  Oh. me.  

B.52:  [Laughter] And I watched that for like, oh, ten or fifteen straight years,

A.53:  Oh, no.

B.54:  and then I had, well, you know, I'd eat like at work, we'd have a T V  or
whatever.  And then, um, as my kids got older and started, you know,
recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good
[laughter].

A.55:  [Laughter].  

B.56:  So I gave it up.  

A.57:  Ouch.  Fifteen years.  

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  Bet they hated that.  

B.60:  I watched, I had watched it since it started.  So,

A.61:  Oh, goodness.  

B.62:  Uh, now I, I don't know who the characters are, and, um, I'll turn it on
every once in awhile and I don't recognize anybody, so I guess that's a good
sign [laughter].

A.63:  Yeah.  Really.  I used to watch, uh, I can recall, this might age me, date
me here, uh, I can remember staying home, when I was five and six,

B.64:  Huh-uh.  

A.65:  and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT.  

B.66:  Oh, yeah.  Well, see, you're probably about the same age as me because my
mom watched the SECRET STORM,

A.67:  SECRET STORM.  

B.68:  and the EDGE OF NIGHT.  

A.69:  Well, I think they were back to back,  

B.70:  Huh-uh.  

A.71:  and black and white.  

B.72:  Huh-uh.  

A.73:  ((I was)) just a youngster and I was like, oh, my gosh.  

B.74:  Yeah, we used to, my mother watched all that stuff, too.  And AS THE WORLD
TURNS.  I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may,

A.75:  Still be on.  

B.76:  still on or not.   It was not too long ago. 

A.77:  Yeah.  Now they got a lot of other crap involved.  And so,

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  You're right.  I think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is
questionable,

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  And that could be, uh, I have to agree with you.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  You know keep them on the channel eleven, channel twenty one. 

B.84:  Right.  

A.85:  The nature stuff, you know [laughter].  

B.86:  Yeah.  We do, and it's real interesting, too, the difference in my kids,
like um, my oldest loved SESAME STREET,

A.87:  Huh-uh.  

B.88:  And those kind of shows.  My younger one doesn't.  She's more into WALT
DISNEY kind, you know, we watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C, on
tapes,

A.89:  Huh-uh.  

B.90:  and stuff.  She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter
liked puppets and that kind of thing so, 

A.91:  Huh-uh.  

B.92:  But, um, we do a lot of kid watching.  

A.93:  Well, sounds like you got your hands full there, and I do appreciate
speaking with you.

B.94:  Sure.  It was fun. 

A.95:  Have you gotten your catalog yet?

B.96:  No, I don't think so.  

A.97:  Yeah.  I just spoke with Jim.  I just got my in the mail and it inspired me
to make more phone calls [laughter].

B.98:  Oh, well, see I don't really.  I've had a few people call me, but, I've
never made one.

A.99:  Oh, really.  

B.100:  Yeah.  I need to get brave [laughter].  

A.101:  Yeah.  ((Give them)) your pen number.  

B.102:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I need to do.  

A.103:  Have a good day.  

B.104:  Thanks. 

A.105:  Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
