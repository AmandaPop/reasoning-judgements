===========================================================================

A.1:  So, do you have any credit cards?

@B.2:  Yes, I do.  I keep, uh, I have an American Express, and a Visa card that I
keep, you know, kind of for emergency purposes, and I have, you know, I use a
gasoline credit card which I, you know, pay off --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- every, every month.

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  But I've, I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, you know, that I
possibly could, and my balances are practically zero on the ones that I have.
Especially since, you know, it's no longer after this year, or after tax year
nineteen ninety, there's no deductions for, you know, credit card interest
that you pay.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So it's a, you know, gosh, credit cards run, what, anywhere from, up to
eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  It's just a bad deal.  Course, there are emergencies, you know, that you,
you know, probably need to have a card.

A.11:  Yeah, I have one card.

B.12:  Uh-huh, that's, that's probably enough.

A.13:  And I try not to use it, but --

B.14:  Absolutely.

A.15:  -- right now, it's maxed out [laughter].

B.16:  It's, it's very easy to, you know, to do that or, you know, to abuse it, it
really is.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  It's so easy to pull out the plastic, but we're trying our best not to, not
to add any, you know, credit card debt to our structure here.

A.19:  Yeah.  Um, I have, uh, the thing that bothers me worse than the credit
cards, I think, is, uh, you mentioned the gasoline credit card.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  I don't have that, but I've got, you know, one of the tex-, the, the
instant teller cards --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- that you can use for point of sale purchases.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And we use that usually to buy gasoline, and it's just --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- it's really amazing how quickly that goes.  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  I'm sure you're right.  I don't, I don't, I don't participate in
that, but, you know, a lot of folks do.

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  Yeah, at least with the, uh, [throat_clearing] gasoline company credit
cards you have, you know, up to thirty, twenty-five, thirty days, you know,
interest free for it.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  But, you know, the instant thing may be, may, may be the way of the future
to, you know, to replace checks and every other thing.

A.33:  Yeah, that's what they've, they've talked about it.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  Course it eliminates any waiting period.

B.36:  It certainly does.

A.37:  God help those people who have to float checks occasionally --

B.38:  Absolutely.

A.39:  -- because you won't be able to with that.

B.40:  That's right.  Do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like
that?

A.41:  No.

B.42:  I see.

A.43:  Oh, it was, well, they consider it to be the same as cash --

B.44:  I see, I see.

A.45:  -- well, cause it actually is.

B.46:  It certainly is, yeah.

A.47:  Yeah.  It's better than cash [laughter].

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  They don't even have to deposit it, it just goes straight in there.

B.50:  That's right.  No returned checks or anything.

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  Yeah.  No, I, I understand it's becoming, you know, the popular thing to
do.  We're not participating in that particular program at the moment, and I
don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to.

A.53:  Uh-huh [dishes].

B.54:  But, uh, I have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit
cards.  It's just, you know, too easy to do.

A.55:  Yeah, but I'm so glad he told me that when, that they, they got to such a
point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they
were afraid sometime they might actually need them.

B.56:  That's right.

A.57:  They paid them off, and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze
them.

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  She said at least [laughter] before she could use them she'd have to thaw
them out.  I mean, that's funny.

B.60:  Well, that's a novel idea.  Yeah, that would cause you think a little
while, wouldn't it.

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  That may not be a bad idea.

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter] [dishes].  But I'm kind of getting a little more leery of
credit cards, you know, as time goes by.  Unless you just absolutely have to.
Now, there are times when you'd --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- at least think you do, anyway.

A.67:  Yeah.  I, I want to still have just one --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- just in case. But, I'd --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- sure want to get the, get it paid down and --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- not use it for a while [dishes].

B.74:  That's right.  My wife and I really, I guess are fortunate.  We're really
not compulsive shoppers, you know.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  We, we plan purchases, you know, pretty well, you know, watch for the best
buys, things like that.  But, uh, some people have a real problem with it.

A.77:  Yeah.  Well, our, our limit is, you know, fairly low --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and, uh, so that's, that's one thing that's good.

B.80:  Sure.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

A.81:  [Click] Oh, I've got another call.

B.82:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was nice talking to you.

A.83:  Okay.

B.84:  Take care.

A.85:  All right.  #Bye-bye.#

B.86:  #Bye-bye.#
