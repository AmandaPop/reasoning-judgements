========================================================================

A.1:  So, um, well, I'll tell you, my situation is, uh, I have an elderly
grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home.  And, um, her
son, which is my father is also elderly, and this is one of the reasons why
she had to go to the nursing home, is that she was literally driving him nuts
in his later years.  Now my father's almost eighty.  My grandmother's almost
ninety-seven.

B.2:  Jeez.

A.3:  So, um, it's strange, because it, it so, hit so close to home that um, my
father's an only child, and really me and my sister are the only ones that
will deal with my grandmother.  She had many sisters, and a couple of them
took care of her.  And then one, her last sister died, and it was probably
seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home.  Because I
was pretty much giving up my life, my sister was, and plus she was driving my
father crazy.  She went through three housekeepers, live-in housekeepers.  So,
she's kind of cranky to get along with.  There's nothing physically wrong with
her, except she's very, very old, but her personality is, is very grating.
[laughter] I mean, I hope I don't get like that when I get old.  So.

B.4:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm, I have some great concerns about, uh, my parents and my
relatives reaching that age.  Um, around here, where I live in Maryland in the
Washington area, there's, there's, and, uh, I used to live down in Dallas,
there was just so many stories about, uh, rest homes where the people are
being abused, where the people are being kept in filthy conditions.  In fact,
here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all
the people out of them because they were so, uh, bug infested and
rat infested.  And, uh, I, it really concerns me, that, um, first of all, that
anyone could let someone live like that, but if you have to, you know, how do
you make sure, I mean, I'm sure when you make your appointment and go by,
everybody puts on a happy face, um, you know, how are you sure that the home
is really as good as it is, because once you put someone into there, you know,
they may not like the fact that they've been put in there, and they might
complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the
whole world they could be, just because they want to make you feel guilty for
putting them in there, and, you know.

A.5:  Yeah, you don't know if their complaints are legitimate.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Um, we don't have that problem up here.  We might maybe in a rural, uh,
maybe there's a bad, uh, a bad home in a rural area, but it would be a very
small one.  Um, the one my grandmother's in is very, um, hospital like.  There
were some really nice ones here.  All the, a lot of the nursing homes around
here have very good reputations.  Um, this one is more or less for someone
who's poor and can't go there, and my father's, is, he's no by no means
wealthy, but he's quite well off.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And he could easily have put her into a nicer, um, home, but up here
there's waiting lists.  And that was the first one that opened.  And I
suggested to him, Why don't you change.  Um, he said, Well, these people here
are, they are very nice to her.  And he was saying his excuses, if you move
her some place else, the people might not be so nice.  So, the, the
professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing,
because it's a really trying job.  I mean, I go up twice a week to see my
grandmother, and I know the staff very well.  So they couldn't, they can't
hide anything on you or anything like that.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  But I have heard of really awful conditions, especially down the southern
part of the st-, the country [clicking] which is.

B.12:  Yes, uh, that's true.  My, uh, my grandmother's, um, last time my mother
went down there to visit the, the place where my grandmother was staying at
was so overrun with roaches that, uh, she even ha-, you know, they went in and
she had roaches crawling on her.  There were roaches even in her alarm clock.
Um,

A.13:  Oh, that's terrible.

B.14:  Yes, it was absolutely horrible.  They took her immediately out of there,
and they just threw everything away that, that she had from there.  I mean,
they wouldn't even take the, uh, the, uh, the dresser that she had that was
her own dresser, because it was just, you know, full of bugs.  They just left
everything.  And, uh, bought her all brand new stuff, and they, they had
called a home where they, you know, where they were on a waiting list to get
into there and explained to the person that was in charge, you know, what had
happened, and that they had ta-, they had to take her out of the home because
of the conditions.  And amazingly enough, the very next day they had an
opening, and they put her into that opening.

A.15:  Well, that's good.  So is your grandmother, um, impaired?  Is she of
Alzheimer's or something like that?

B.16:  I'm not sure, um, what exactly is wrong with her.  Up until nineteen
eighty-two, uh, actually, I'm sorry, not until, yeah, I guess it was around
eighty-two, eighty-three, I found out I had a grandmother.

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  Prior to that I was told that she was dead, and, um, apparently what had
happened was that I had a grandfather who, um, put her into a mental
institution.

A.19:  Oh, that does happen.  Yeah.

B.20:  And, uh, you know, it was a real hush-hush thing --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- and then, I was wondering why my mother always referred to, you know,
his second wife as that hussy.  [laughter]

A.23:  You know, my neighbors across the street, their mother was sick at times,
and they, they couldn't handle her.  So they put her in a home, and then, uh,
the old Frenchman, he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids, Oh, you
still need your mother.  I guess I'll look after here.  And that happens a lot
when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants, they end up being
put in homes, and it's like, oh, well.

B.24:  [Clicking]  Yeah.

A.25:  But that's, it's, it's, I'm really glad that I come from an area where, um,
that there's good people in the homes.  But it's just as, it doesn't matter if
it is, like you say, the best place, they still don't want to go to these
homes.  And my grandmother's real, there, I mean, she cries every day.  This
has been over a year, and she tries to make me feel really guilty.  But I have
to, you know, I have to put my foot down, where, where my life begins.  I
mean, if that was my mother, I would really feel a lot more responsible.  I
would probably take care of my mother.  I don't really, um, when my father,
when something, if anything happens to him, I don't want him put in a nursing
home just for the fact I don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing
home.  And hopefully that he can, uh, get along with, uh, in-house help.  So,
he's going to probably, hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay
someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day, because
I think that's the best situation, is when you're, you get that old and you've
been independent your whole life, you don't want to go into a home, because,
like I say, my father's eighty, and he's really active.  He still has his
driver's license here, I mean, you wouldn't believe what he does.  He actually
tows cars.  [laughter]

B.26:  [Laughter]

A.27:  And, as the years go on, the tow trucks got better, more easier, and he
went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much
work.

B.28:  [Laughter]

A.29:  So someone like that, they, I really don't want to see them go in a home.
He's got two dogs that are his constant companions, and he always replaces
them.  You know, I've had like, over the past thirty years I've had, you know,
about seven or eight different dogs all the time.  And it's like, you know,
it's oops, Dad's got these two and the old dies and the young one goes for a
while, and he gets another one.  So I can't see him with-, without his
animals.  Even though it's very expensive to stay at home --

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  -- mentally it's just the best thing for you.

B.32:  I know.

A.33:  I mean, when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have,
and I'm thinking when I get older, I, I, I think if brought all my precious
belongings with me, I think I could live in a home.  I don't want to be a
selfish, you know, a burden on anyone.  That's what I think, because I see
what my grandmother puts me through, and I'm saying that when I get older I
could probably make the best of this place, I mean.  And of course, it's
institutional food, and everybody hates it, and it's so ironic is that they go
in there and they lose weight.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  It's really, it's a bad thing, but when they go into the homes they lose
weight, and, lik-, because of the institutional food, you know.  I think it's
fine, but, you know, my taste buds are pretty, uh, flexible, and here they
are, they're always used to these old fashioned foods.  They're very set in
their ways and used to have what they could get at home, and now they're
feeding them, um, quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Just, they don't feed them the old people food, the chicken and biscuits,
and things like that.  That's, that's the thing my grandmother really misses,
I mean, really growls about.

B.38:  Yeah, my mother has made similar statements, that she doesn't want to
become a burden to the family.  You know, Just put me out to pasture, or shoot
me, or something, you know.  [laughter]

A.39:  [Laughter]

B.40:  (( )) are the lines that come from her.  And, uh --

A.41:  Oh.

B.42:  -- and I tell her, you know, No problem, Mom, always got a place for you.
But, uh,

A.43:  Yeah, I know, if, if, if people would think ahead of time and do things
like that, like build the in-law apartment --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and have it on, you know, one floor and really easy access.  Well,
that's what I'm telling my father now.  He needs a new floor in his bathroom,
and I says, Now is the time.  Redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and
out ...
