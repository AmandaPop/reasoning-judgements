========================================================================

A.1:  An interesting, uh, point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away
with a jury.  I don't know if I'd be willing to accept the, um, abuses that
would come along with that and that the, ((it would be)) relatively easy to
get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of
bribery but,

B.2:  Yeah.   

A.3:  or even if he just, through years of being on the bench, just becomes,
uh, out of touch with, uh, the population and he only sees the bad side of
life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions.  However, the
complexity of some of these, uh, cases it's just, they spend more time
educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision,

B.4:  Uh-huh.   

A.5:  then it would take, if the judge just made the decision especially when
it is purely, um, noncriminal, uh, litigation type, uh, whatever you want to
call it the term, civil, uh, suits as it were or even some corporate, uh, law.
When there's not any individual involved, and some of those are solved without
a, a jury but, uh, some, some do choose to go before it.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.   

A.7:  Um, what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury?  When they do
have a jury must all six or twelve, uh, agree before the, the topic be final
or, or the verdict be final?

B.8:  Yeah, that, that is, uh, a tough situation I mean, because you know, I
mean, some, sometimes I feel like maybe some of them are just kind of
pressured or not really into, you know, and, and you, people (( )) jury duty
is always like, you know, kind of whining about it all [laughter].  Seems
like if people were, were really, you know, into the subject and, uh, I don't
know, I mean, I guess, if there, if there was more people it would be better
if it was just like, you know, the majority.  But I guess the smaller number
of that more like six or twelve which there usually are so.  Um, and I guess
unanimous, uh, yeah, I kind of agree with that.

A.9:  Okay, if, it, the only thing that I was thinking about as far as having, if
you had one holdout out of say twelve,

B.10:  Yeah.   

A.11:  then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be
some reason for that person to be holding out, and obviously, the other eleven
or five cannot convince this person,

B.12:  Uh-huh.   

A.13:  that, uh, they should vote it one way or the other.  So, maybe it is
worth having that extra little or going to the, the very farthest, uh,
safeguard that can be done and, uh,

B.14:  Yeah.   

A.15:  trying not to get a wrong decision.   

B.16:  Yeah, I can see that. 

A.17:  The, uh, system as it stands now I think if, if the juries were done away
with, the judge could render a decision much quicker, uh, and you'd, you'd
feed more people through the courts as it were, don't know where we'd put them
once we got them through your courts but, uh,

B.18:  [Laughter] Yeah. 

A.19:  I think the rate of processing is just about, uh, reached the rate of
housing anyway so,

B.20:  Yeah.   

A.21:  keep the, keep the norm as it is.  Can't upset the system very much.

B.22:  Yeah, I heard about, um, is, is there true that there's a if a lawyer takes
a, a case to court and it's, what do they call it, um, frivolous?  Is that, is
there still a frivolous law?

A.23:  Probably,  

B.24:  That they can,

A.25:  yeah, I would imagine the judge could throw it out.

B.26:  Yeah, but do you think he would fine the lawyer?   

A.27:  I would imagine that's left up to the judge I, I would assume he could
consider it a contempt of court and,

B.28:  Oh. 

A.29:  and, uh, but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of
court.

B.30:  Yeah, I never I didn't realize until recently that there was actually a
fine they could, pretty interesting though.

A.31:  Certainly makes sense because,  

B.32:  Yeah [laughter].   

A.33:  some of this stuff is, you know, y-, you're just doing this to do this,
you know [laughter].

B.34:  [Laughter].   

A.35:  Just doesn't make sense.   

B.36:  Yeah.   

A.37:  So, that's pretty bad.  A friend of mine is a, is a judge here in the oh,
(( )) actually of McKinney because we're in Collin County.

B.38:  Uh-huh.   

A.39:  And he is, uh, just recently changed from hearing all the, the D W I type
stuff,

B.40:  Oh, really?   

A.41:  to, uh, doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go
listen to all the divorces so,

B.42:  Oh, really [laughter].

A.43:  it wasn't much of a step up as it were.  Um, it's really tough he says in
a lot of cases where he has to make the decision, so I guess in a lot of those
cases it's, it's all up to him as oppose,

B.44:  Oh.   

A.45:  to a jury.

B.46:  Gosh.    

A.47:  And there's just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or,

B.48:  Yeah.   

A.49:  And, of course, there, 

B.50:  Oh, that would be really tough.

A.51:  couples get kind of spiteful at times and,   

B.52:  [Laughter].   

A.53:  and you hear it all through the worst side of people,  

B.54:  Yeah, you really do.

A.55:  throughout the whole time.  Well, let me think here.  Um, as far as the
judge making the decision,

B.56:  Yeah, I mean because seems like I don't know, I mean, there's so many
different, different types of cases that come in I mean it seems like just
general people, I mean, who are, live in the community and do different
things, you know, you have different opinions kind of,

A.57:  Uh-huh.   

B.58:  just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would,
would get it, start thinking a certain way and go, go nuts [laughter].

A.59:  Yeah, that's true.  But then look at the group that tends to accept jury
duty.

B.60:  [Laughter].   

A.61:  You, you either have the person who, who is, uh, the type of individual who
can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them, you know, let
them go.

B.62:  Yeah.   

A.63:  And, and those are, shall we say, blue collar that, that your, work the
assembly line type or technician,

B.64:  Yeah.   

A.65:  some engineering, uh, you may not have the, the self-employed businessman
willing to go because he, though he may be current on all, you know, several
social issues and have opinions on things like that,

B.66:  Yeah.   

A.67:  he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he
probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some,

B.68:  Yeah.   

A.69:  counties.  So, it, I don't know whether it would be wiser to have an
educated judge even though he may get, uh, out of touch after a while or
whether it would be, uh,

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there. 

B.72:  That is hard to say.   

A.73:  Though I have had a judge, fact this very judge friend of mine, say that
he, uh, does not like to have people on the jury that are from, uh, the
electronics industry.

B.74:  Uh-huh.   

A.75:  And I said well, me being from the electronics industry I'll bite, why?

B.76:  [Laughter].   

A.77:  Why don't you like it.  And he said, well, he said the majority of them,
uh, tend to dive into their little world of, of electronics and be very
technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is, and they
usually don't, um, read outside their field.  They don't read social type, uh,
papers.  They don't, they're not up-to-date on various, uh, current affairs as
it were.

B.78:  Oh, I had never thought of that really.   

A.79:  And I said well, that, that's quite possible I said I've discussed,

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  some topics with people even over this situation and, and discovered some
views that I hadn't thought of in a while, I just wondered if I got out of my
little realm, uh,

B.82:  [Laughter].   

A.83:  if I wouldn't run into people with some more diverse views.

B.84:  Yeah.   

A.85:  But, uh, my realm is pretty well technical, and those who, you know,
friends I have are, usually we discuss technical items and we don't, uh, try
to follow the world's problems.

B.86:  Yeah.   

A.87:  I guess it's too frustrating [laughter]. 

B.88:  Yeah, it does.  

A.89:  So,

B.90:  So,  

@@A.91:  Well, I think we've managed to kill a little time on the topic and,

B.92:  Yeah.   

A.93:  we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe.   

B.94:  All right well, groovy, it's been cool talking to you.   

A.95:  Okay.   

B.96:  See you around.   

A.97:  Bye.   

B.98:  Bye.
