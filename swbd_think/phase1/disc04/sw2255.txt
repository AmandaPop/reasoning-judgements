@A.1:  Do you have a favorite basketball team?  

B.2:  Lakers [laughter].  

A.3:  Lakers, L A.  

B.4:  Yes, I'm from L A.  

A.5:  Okay.  

B.6:  [Laughter].  

A.7:  Uh, how they doing this year, I'm not, I haven't even been following them
very much.

B.8:  They're okay.  They're not, uh, out of anything yet.  They're still hanging
in there.

A.9:  I know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee.  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  That's, that's where I'm from [laughter].  

B.12:  [Laughter].  

A.13:  So.  

B.14:  Yeah.  That's about the, I like the Lakers and, uh, Mavericks are okay, but
they, they got a lot of problems.

A.15:  Mavericks do have problems.  Without Roy Tarpley, they're not going
anywhere.

B.16:  And see, I don't think they should build up on one person like Chicago
with, you know, with Michael Air Jordan and,

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  that's not good.  Lakers got so many different players.  

A.19:  They do.  They always seem to get the talent there.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  Well, they, I think,

B.22:  I guess that's why I like them.  

A.23:  Yeah.  I think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game.

B.24:  Yeah.  Yep.  I'm not too much of a basketball fan, but, you know, I watch
a, I watch different games,

A.25:  Uh-huh.   

B.26:  like, playoff games and stuff like that.  

A.27:  Do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year? 

B.28:  No.  

A.29:  [Laughter].  

B.30:  [Laughter] Not since they're coach is ((gone)).  

A.31:  You don't like Mike ((Dunleavy))?

B.32:  No.  

A.33:  Yeah, he didn't, they didn't let him have quite the, the flair that, uh,
Mike Riley had.

B.34:  Huh-uh.  Mike Riley was it.  And that's,

A.35:  Well, ((Dunleavy's)) a good coach though.  He ((is)),

B.36:  He's good, it's just he's not, he's not Riley, and I think that's the
biggest problem is,

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and
catch on to each other.

A.39:  Wh-, he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude. 

B.40:  Huh-uh [laughter].  

A.41:  I'm pretty, 

B.42:  Would, uh,

A.43:  familiar with, with ((Dunleavy)) because he was an assistant at
Milwaukee.

B.44:  Oh, was he?  

A.45:  Uh, yeah, and he, uh, wh-, when they had, uh, injury problems with some of
their major players, he actually put on a uniform and went out and played.

B.46:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.47:  They, they signed him to a ten day contract and, uh, he became a player.
Even though ((he's)),

B.48:  ((Huh, huh)). 

A.49:  assistant coach.  

B.50:  That's all right then.  

A.51:  The guy knows basketball.  

B.52:  Huh?  

A.53:  I think he'll do all right for the Lakers.  

B.54:  Oh, you-, you like basketball though, don't you?  

A.55:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  It's fun.  I'm watching the,

B.56:  ((Hey)). 

A.57:  I'm, I'm busy watching the N C double A tournament, uh, the past couple
weeks.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  And the N I T semifinals are on tonight.  

B.60:  Yeah, see, now I watch the, the Final Four, 

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  once it gets down to like,

A.63:  Yeah, right.  

B.64:  the Final Four.  

A.65:  So, are any of those teams of interest to you?  

B.66:  U N L V, I like them.  

A.67:  Oh, yeah, well, [laughter], they're, they're just,

B.68:  I guess because, well, that guy is from Dallas, that's probably about the
only thing,

A.69:  Larry Johnson.  

B.70:  Yeah, that's it, that's the only reason why.  I don't know anybody else.

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  [Laughter].  

A.73:  Well, they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year.

B.74:  Are they really?  

A.75:  Oh, yeah, they're, they're so much better than anybody else it's, uh, that
they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games.

B.76:  But then, you know, just like that man said in this fin-, in these, in the
N C A, whatever it is, the little playoff games,

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  they play so many sometimes I do think it's going to be more, it's luck
and ((ambition)), you know.

A.79:  Well, it's, it's just unbelievable how many games they play in, in college
now.  Arkansas,

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  played thirty-four games this year.  That's almost half,

B.82:  ((See, that's)),    

A.83:  of a pro season.  

B.84:  That's too many games.  

A.85:  It's too many for students.  

B.86:  You know, and, and then they supposed to be studying.  

A.87:  Right.  

B.88:  You know,

A.89:  They're talking tonight about this N I T game with Stanford and
Massachusetts.

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  That the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were
on the road playing basketball.

B.92:  Are you serious?  

A.93:  They have an honor system there where they wer-, they had, uh, three hours
to take their exams, they sent them in by, uh, by F A X.

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  And, uh, I guess, b-, they used laptop computers to, uh, try to get their
exams finished.  Sent them,

B.96:  Huh.  

A.97:  out by Federal Express and F A X machine.  

B.98:  I don't think that's good.

A.99:  It's incredible that, uh, that they have to do that.  I mean some of the,
the schools give you a break, they give the students a break where they can
take their exams when they get back from, from a tournament,

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  but, uh, these guys were actually on the road, uh, two thousand miles
fr-, from home when they had to file their, uh, their final exams and send
them in [laughter].

B.102:  Yeah.  I don't think that's, I don't think that's good.  

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  That and then, you know, the laptop, that's how, I guess, they really stuck
it on a disk.  The teacher, you know, with no answers,

A.105:  [Laughter].  

B.106:  and they could take it like that, and then just print it out in ((F A X))
and it would be okay.

A.107:  Yeah.  

B.108:  Because you can put it on a, you know, on diskette.  

A.109:  Yeah.  

B.110:  And just have them take it, but then, who's helping them?  

A.111:  I don't know.  

B.112:  See (( )), 

A.113:  ((See)), you think, uh, you think Vegas is going to win the finals then?

B.114:  Yep.  

A.115:  I think so too.  They play Duke and, uh, Duke has a lot to, uh, to atone
for, here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points.

B.116:  In that the other one that up-, that was an upset was Kansas last night.

A.117:  Kansas is a real surprise.  I didn't, 

B.118:  When they,

A.119:  expect them to get that far.  

B.120:  Yeah, I didn't think they was going to beat that team.  I don't remember
the team, but they shouldn't have beat them.

A.121:  Uh, they beat, 

B.122:  ((I didn't)),

A.123:  Arkansas.  Yeah.  

B.124:  Yeah.  That, that I like, I like Arkansas.  

A.125:  Arkansas just, uh, they had a rough second half.  

B.126:  Yeah.  

A.127:  They came out, uh, real hot in the first half, Todd Davis hitting his three
pointers.

B.128:  And it was like they just died or something, you know.  

A.129:  Yeah, uh, somebody took the fire out from under them.  

B.130:  [Laughter].  

A.131:  They, they weren't getting their shots anymore.  

B.132:  Huh-uh and, 

A.133:  And Kansas just crept up on them and, uh, a-, it was, 

B.134:  That's it.   

A.135:  unbelievable because they, they did that a few years ago too when they
were seated a lot lower and they won th-, the championship.

B.136:  Uh-huh.  

A.137:  But I don't think they,

B.138:  See, now, that's the, that's the thing now.  Everybody's waiting for U N L
V.

A.139:  Yeah, well, they, they are just that much better.  

B.140:  And see if Kansas, if Kan-,

A.141:  They've got so many stars.  

B.142:  Yeah, but then, you know, it could be, what if they're not hitting that
night, or they're low or anything and see I, I feel like the college, you
know, it's a, it's still kids.

A.143:  Well, sure.  I think anybody can, 

B.144:  So.  

A.145:  can win on a given night, but they have so, 

B.146:  Yeah.  

A.147:  much talents, and the average age on that team is, 

B.148:  They just take them out.  

A.149:  twenty-two years old.  

B.150:  Take that,

A.151:  They've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing.  

B.152:  That be all right.  

A.153:  Guys that are playing for long time.  

B.154:  Uh-huh.  

A.155:  Uh, they're playing Duke, uh, this weekend.  Uh, the average age on Duke's
team is nineteen years old.

B.156:  Uh-huh.  

A.157:  Vegas, the average age is over twenty-two.  So, they've got just so much
more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now.  But they're
going to lose all those guys at the end of the season.  They're going to all
turn pro, I think.

B.158:  Yeah.   

A.159:  Stacy ((Augmon's)) a senior, and Larry Johnson.  I don't think, I think
he's, uh, is he a senior or junior?  I'm not,

B.160:  Who?  

A.161:  Larry Johnson, I think he's coming,

B.162:  He's,

A.163:  out this year.  

B.164:  Yeah, he's coming out in the ((pros)) this year. 

A.165:  Uh-huh.  And Anderson Hunt, all their, uh, their best players, I think, are
graduating.

B.166:  Uh-huh.  

A.167:  Well, maybe not graduating but at least [laughter] they'll be entering
the, the pro draft.

B.168:  I don't, I think, I think he's going to move, I think he'll probably go,
he, now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros.

A.169:  Oh, yeah, for sure.  Yeah.

B.170:  And, uh, there's some more that I don't, I can't think of their names, god,
my girlfriend, she, she gets me because I can describe them, go, you know that
guy, you know, and she'll name them for me [laughter].

A.171:  George ((Akals)) and Stacy ((Augmon)).  

B.172:  Yeah, now, they'll come out, 

A.173:  [Doorbell] Anderson Hunt.  

B.174:  in the pros.  They'll come out.  

A.175:  Uh-huh.  

B.176:  They're, half they're team is going to be gone now.  And see, that's
another thing for next year.  With U N L V, they're not going to have no team.

A.177:  Uh, well, I wouldn't say that, I, I think,

B.178:  Well, I mean as far as the, the top players, you know, 

A.179:  Yeah.  

B.180:  like the ones they have this year, you know.  

A.181:  Their coach may not be there.  I think Jerry ((Tarkenyon)) may be headed
for the pros.

B.182:  Yeah, he's ni-,   

A.183:  There's some talk that he may be, uh, coaching for the L A Clippers next
year.

B.184:  Uh, the Clippers ((that are)), that's another team ((and)) I don't think
they've ever done anything.

A.185:  They have a great amount of talent but, 

B.186:  But (( )) no coaching.

A.187:  they just have poor coaching, I think [Doorbell].  

B.188:  Yeah, that's all right.

A.189:  They've got some great players on that team.  

B.190:  That be all right.  

A.191:  I just think that,

B.192:  Between them and,

A.193:  Yeah.  

B.194:  Then there's that, uh, let's see, I like the Lakers, Milwaukee, Atlanta
Hawks, I like them too.

A.195:  Uh-huh.  

B.196:  I like probably, uh, the Houston Rockets shocked me.  The-, I think it was
last year when they, uh, was it last year, they beat L A last year.

A.197:  Uh-huh, well, Houston's playing really well lately.  

B.198:  Yeah.  

A.199:  Last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem,

B.200: Because I know my sister's in L A, see, and she calls me up and tells me,
well, L A -s going to come down there and beat up on Texas, you know,

A.201:  Uh-huh.  

B.202:  and I said, yeah, and so when they came down (( )) so what happened.  It
took them a long time, they beat them, but it was like four out of the
((thirty-seven)) games, they had to play the seven games for the, for the
thing, you know, just to beat them so it was like one game over.

A.203:  Sure.  

B.204:  [Laughter].  

A.205:  I think Houston's playing really good ball lately.  

B.206:  Uh-huh.  

A.207:  Ever since Akeem changed his, uh, first name to Hakeem. 

B.208:  [Laughter].  

A.209:  [Laughter] He added the H to the front.

B.210:  His attitude [laughter].  I don't know, I don't know them people.

A.211:  Well, ((hey)), I can understand that, it's, uh, [laughter], I don't know
why he dropped it in the first place, but, uh, 

B.212:  I don't either.  If it was his name, he should have just
kept it, 

A.213:  Sure.  

B.214:  I, you know, that's your name, that's your name [laughter].

A.215:  So, who do you think's going to win the N B A this year?

B.216:  Hopefully, I don't think the Lakers are going to win, but I think, uh, uh,
what's his,

A.217:  Port-, Portland's looking awful good.  

B.218:  No, not Portland.  What's that team with the little guy in, the, no, Isiah.

A.219:  Isiah Thomas, Detroit?  

B.220:  Yeah.  

A.221:  Detroit Pistons, they're not as good as they were last year. 

B.222:  I don't know.  I think they'll go, I think they'll, they're good but
they're not great, but I think they'll,

A.223:  They'll have to pick it up in the, in the tournament then.  

B.224:  But I think that's what usually happens to them.  

A.225:  Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan.  

B.226:  Uh-huh.  

A.227:  And I think they finally put things together.

B.228:  Yeah, they did good last night.  Last night they had like a hundred and
something ((to eighty)).  So they, they was playing real good last night.

A.229:  Yeah.  Well, Chicago, they, they've been struggling last couple of years
and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael
Jordan, but they never did seem to make an impact on the playoffs.

B.230:  Yeah.  

A.231:  I think this year they're going to really, uh, 

B.232:  I think,  

A.233:  show some talent.  

B.234:  also because they done took some of the pressure off of him. 

A.235:  Oh, yeah.  

B.236:  You know, they, because they always think it's all him and see there's not,
you know,

A.237:  It's not true.  They have a good supporting cast.  

B.238:  That's not good.  But I mean everybody's always looking at him.  That's
just like Larry Bird and, um, uh, god, Larry Bird, what team does he play for,

A.239:  Boston,   

B.240:  the Celtics.  

A.241:  Celtics.  Right.  

B.242:  Yeah.  See, because they put a lot on Larry Bird.  Uh-huh.  

A.243:  Yeah, I don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes
to win the N B A this year.

B.244:  Huh-uh.  

A.245:  They've got good individual players but some are getting old.  Robert
((Parish)) is thirty-seven years old.

B.246:  Yep.  

A.247:  He's still playing center.  

B.248:  [Laughter].  

A.249:  And, uh, Larry Bird's talking about retirement here, 

B.250:  Well, he's out, 

A.251:  I guess, in another year.

B.252:  I mean he's hurt this year.  

A.253:  Yeah.  

B.254:  So, you know, you never know.  

A.255:  But they're bringing in some good young players too.  

B.256:  Yeah.  

A.257:  Which is good.  

B.258:  Uh-huh.  

A.259:  I'm, I've always favored Milwaukee being from that area, and they've made
some good moves in personnel, but I don't see them as having the, the type of
talent that will win the N B A this year.

B.260:  Yeah.  

A.261:  They have to get by Detroit and Chicago [laughter], and I think either one
of them is a real tough challenge for them.

B.262:  Yep.  If they get by Detroit, I think they can get by b-, uh, Atlanta.

A.263:  I-, yeah, I don't think Atlanta would be much, as much a problem as
Chicago.

B.264:  Well, that's what I meant, yeah, they get by Chicago, 

A.265:  Uh-huh.  

B.266:  they can get by Atlanta.  It would, it, if you can beat
Chicago, Atlanta shouldn't be that much different.  

A.267:  Right.   

B.268:  You just slow down Isiah Thomas.  And Atlanta is, um, they got one ...
