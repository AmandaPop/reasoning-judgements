============================================================================

B.1:  Okay, well, uh, I guess, uh, you're pretty aware that it's, uh, been a
little warm for this time of year.

A.2:  Oh, yeah.

B.3:  It, uh, the humidity's a little higher.

A.4:  It is, this is muggy today like it wants to rain, but it don't know what it
wants, you know, for this time of year.

B.5:  Uh-huh, you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad, but, uh,
--

A.6:  No.

B.7:  -- boy, for the end of March, this is, uh,

A.8:  Really bad.

B.9:  this is funny.

A.10:  Yeah, funny weather, but bad, because that means, it either means one or
two things.  It's going to be a bad summer [laughter].

B.11:  Oh, gee.

A.12:  Or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year.

B.13:  [Laughter]  Well, that's a good way to look at it.

A.14:  I always do that.  I got to do something like that with the weather.

B.15:  Well, if you do that, then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably, if
it's anything but that.

A.16:  That's right.

B.17:  That's, uh, but, uh, I, I guess the win-, the winter wasn't that bad down
here really.

A.18:  No.  See that's, it was a mild winter.  That's why I keep saying, oh, no.

B.19:  Looking, looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer.

A.20:  Yeah, I think it's going to be really hot this year. 

B.21:  Well, hopefully, you know, if it's humid now, maybe it'll, I remember last
year it rained an awful lot --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- [Talking] for the last couple of years it's rained an awful lot, and
maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- and if, uh, if it rains a lot.  But, uh, 

A.26:  If it rains, if it rains any more and gets really hot, then we have this
problem with mosquitos.

B.27:  Oh, yeah, you're right.  

A.28:  See.

B.29:  Yeah, yeah, I used to live in, up north, up in the upper midwest, and, uh,
and we had, had mosquito problems, that's for sure.

A.30:  Well, see I would prefer the cold.  I'm from southern California.

B.31:  Oh, really.

A.32:  But see, the heat out here ain't nothing.

B.33:  Well, you know, it's, it's, that easy to say, but boy, when it's forty
below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's, uh,

A.34:  No, I don't want to get that cold now [laughter].

B.35:  [Laughter] That's just the bad thing, you either, you either have to take
the, take this kind of weather, or, uh, or take the really, really cold
weather.

A.36:  I don't think, no, I don't want to go no where up north, no where.  Huh-uh.

B.37:  (( )) any where north of the Red River.

A.38:  I don't even want to go anywhere, yeah, that's about it [laughter].

B.39:  That's, uh, I, that's what I've heard people say, is they'll never go north
of the Red River again.

A.40:  That's right, it's too cold up there.

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  And then last year, that's when they really had that cold spell.

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  You know, it was like, um, record breaking below temperatures and stuff in
Alaska where your gas-, your car was freezing while it was running.  You know,
the oil or the gas would turn to slush.  Huh-uh.  See, I can't handle that
[laughter].

B.45:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, I know what you mean, because, uh, because you got to
have like little heaters where they plug in the, uh, plug in --

A.46:  Uh-huh --

B.47:  -- in your car --

A.48:  -- yeah,

B.49:  -- and that's not, that's not good at all.

A.50:  No, something happened then what?

B.51:  Well, I guess, the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that
it gets this year.

A.52:  Yeah, it's not that bad right now.  I just hope it don't get any worse.

B.53:  Yeah, or if it, if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long.

A.54:  That's about it.  I'm just waiting, because see, it's tornado season.

B.55:  Oh, that's right, that's right.

A.56:  Yes, it is, it's tornado season.

B.57:  Already, already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon.

A.58:  Uh-huh, you see, this is, this is tornado weather, boy, people don't know
it, but when it gets hot like this --

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  -- and, you know, like they're predicting the weather to be cold.

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  Well, when it gets cold real fast --

B.63:  Uh-huh, get a norther in through here.

A.64:  -- there's your tornados, that's right.

B.65:  That's right.

A.66:  And so they're predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty
degrees, they'll say, huh-uh, that ain't right.

B.67:  No.

A.68:  [Laughter].

B.69:  No, it's,

A.70:  But that's, that's tornado season.

B.71:  Yeah.  And I guess, I guess that's shows what they say about Dallas.  If
you don't like the weather, just, just wait a day --

A.72:  Wait a while, it'll change.

B.73:  -- yeah, it'll change on you.

A.74:  That's right.  That's about like it is, too.

B.75:  Uh-huh.

A.76:  Because yesterday was really nice --

B.77:  Uh-huh.

A.78:  -- and the wind was blowing, but today is muggy, but the wind is still
blowing, but, you know.  I don't know.

B.79:  Well, anyway, I guess that's about all I got to say about the, uh, the
weather.

A.80:  That's about it.  That's about all you can say about it [laughter].

B.81:  Talk about it but can't do anything about it.

A.82:  That's right.

B.83:  Okay.

A.84:  All righty.

B.85:  All right.  Bye-bye.

A.86:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.
