=======================================================================

A.1:  does tend to get [throat_clearing] talked about a lot and one of the things
that I like to bring up when taxation comes about, or the how they're
collected is, uh, the government wants to control and, and rightfully so in
some instances, what we do with our money.  It does enable them and those who
have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving
you a tax break if you invest properly.  You know, things like that I can
understand, especially for people who are [breathing], uh, young and getting
into a knowledge of the economy and, and,

B.2:  But, do we get a tax break for correct investments?  We get --

A.3:  Well,  

B.4:  -- taxed on whatever we make on our investments.  

A.5:  I think years ago, I think it used to.  I think the concept was good and I
think that, that those kind of things are all right.  I,

B.6:  But, we don't have that anymore, do we?  

A.7:  No, not, not near to the extent that it was.  

B.8:  I didn't think so.  They've even cut, you know, who can have an I R A.

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  That was to encourage you to save for the future and to, you know, save for
your retirement and now they've cut out, you know, the amount that you can
have in it and that seems unfair.

A.11:  Right.  I usually use that as a preface to, you know, it's okay that the
government used to do that or should do that as far as the good, good
incentive, but since they're not doing it as well now, I would be more in
favor of, uh, not taxing anything directly.  In other, just do straight
purchases.  In other words, if, if you want to put a tax on what you buy, then
revenues can be generated that way.  People,

B.12:  But they already tax us, I mean, where we live [barking], it's eight --

A.13:  Well,  

B.14:  -- almost eight and a half percent tax.  

A.15:  Right.  But couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the
other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there.  And
the, the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases, if you notice
[barking], most people tend to spend what they make.

B.16:  Oh, and then some.  

A.17:  And then some [barking].  

B.18:  [Laughter] And then some.  

A.19:  So then you'd have a tendency to be taxing [barking], uh, pretty much
across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year, you'd
probably only spend X amount of that, you know, a small portion of that on
taxable goods.  You know, you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still, you
know, decide whether you want to tax housing.

B.20:  Are you talking about doing away with income tax?  

A.21:  Doing away with everything except for, yeah, all, all forms of it --

B.22:  I don't think,  

A.23:  -- including,  

B.24:  Well, we're already doing a tax on, you know, a sales tax.  I don't think
that would generate enough money.

A.25:  Well, you'd have to up it to whatever, fifteen percent.  

B.26:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  

A.27:  Yeah, so -- 

B.28:  What do you -- 

A.29:  -- if you took the money out of one,

B.30:  -- think of just about a, a straight percentage, uh, off of the income with
no deductions and, and no, no loopholes and no gimmes and everybody pays, say,
five percent, period.

A.31:  Well, your problem in there is how do you get, I mean, you get people that
don't report income now, so, if they don't report income then, you wouldn't
get that percentage.  If,

B.32:  Well, if they're not reporting the income now, they're still not paying it,
so what's the point?

A.33:  Well, if, if it's left in the hands of the grocer, he doesn't care whether,
you know, this guy giving him the money, you know, pays taxes or not.  But
he's going to have to pay that percentage.  See what I'm saying?

B.34:  No.  

A.35:  Well, when a guy comes in to, you know, he's got a hundred thousand dollars
and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- he pays fifteen percent tax, let's say.  

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  And if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries,
he pays fifteen percent tax.

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  So, both guys paid it because the grocer was, in essence, collecting it.

B.42:  Right.  

A.43:  And, the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he
purchased, because the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him.  Whereas the
hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty
thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong.

B.44:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  But if we -- 

A.45:  See, so I'm saying there's,  

B.46:  -- had to have an income tax, which they're never going to get rid of, what
about, instead of this graduated, the more you make the more you pay, what
about having a straight across the line income tax.  Just a flat thing and do
away with all the deductions.  I realize all the C P A -s and --

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  -- H And R Blocks -- 

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  -- would be out of [laughter], of a job -- 

A.51:  So you, you tax,  

B.52:  -- but, uh,  

A.53:  Yeah, you tax per body and, and then if you -- 

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  -- made more, you got to keep more.  Yeah, that's a rational way to do it.

B.56:  I never have understood why they don't do that.  

A.57:  Yeah, it, it does seem,  

B.58:  And no one can explain it to me [laughter].  

A.59:  It does seem fair.  It does take away all their ability to control, which,
you know [barking] initially they, they had some good ideas, but they don't
seem to be following them anymore.

B.60:  No, no.  

A.61:  So,  

B.62:  I don't know.  I, I guess there's never a, an answer.  Nobody ever asks
[laughter].

A.63:  That's true, that's true.  Not being an economy major, I guess they'd never
ask me anyway [laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter] They don't ask me at all.  

A.65:  Oh. 

B.66:  I always thought a straight percentage, though, would make a whole lot more
sense.  Because some of the people who make the most, they have so many,
quote, deductions by the time they get through with their deductions, they
don't pay anything.

A.67:   Right.  

B.68:   And I question their, I, I, I just think that they've made it,
