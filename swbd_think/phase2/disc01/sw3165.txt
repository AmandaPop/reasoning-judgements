==========================================================================

B.1:  I'm doing fine.  

A.2:  Uh, my name's Jim.  I'm from, uh, New York.  

B.3:  What,  

A.4:  Where you from?  

B.5:  What was your name?  

A.6:  Uh, Brad ((LeMeaux)).  

B.7:  Oh, I'm Nola and I'm in Plano, Texas.  

A.8:  Nola in Texas.  I, I talked to someone from Texas yesterday.  Where in
Texas did you say?

B.9:  It's Plano.  It's just north of Dallas.  

A.10:  Okay.  You have pets?  {Pause}.  Do -- 

B.11:  Uh, oh,  

A.12:  -- you have pets?  

B.13:  Pets?  Yes.  

A.14:  Yeah, that's what the topic's supposed to be.  

B.15:  Yeah, I didn't quite understand what you said.  I'm sorry.  

A.16:  I got my New York accent.  

B.17:  We don't have, I grew up in New Jersey, but it's been a long time since I
lived there.  Did you already push the one?

@A.18:  Yes.  

B.19:  Okay, uh, yeah we have fish.  That's it [laughter].

A.20:  [Laughter] That's pretty easy.  

B.21:  Yeah.  It's, uh, neither my husband or I really wanted to take care of cats
or dogs or anything like that, so, and the girls kind of wanted something.  We
have, uh, well, now we have four girls.  When we got the fish to start with,
we had two or three.  But, uh [breathing] --

A.22:  What,  

B.23:  -- for some reason, I just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten
gallon fish tank, and it started with a, s-, we had a real hard time getting
it established.  Tried the goldfish [noise] and they were just filthy.  Could
not keep the tank clean.  Uh, eventually I took them back to the store and
started all over again and [lipsmack] I had another couple of kinds that ate
each other, so that,

A.24:  [Laughter].  

B.25:  batch didn't work either [laughter].  

A.26:  What type were they, like ((sicklets)), and stuff like that? 

B.27:  Uh, there were some neons and a couple of other kind.  I can't remember
what they were but,

A.28:  I remember,  

B.29:  But they didn't get along very well, whatever they were [laughter].

A.30:  I, I had fish that were like, they were called ((sicklets)), a type of
family.  This is when I was a kid.  They, they had, uh, [lipsmack] what do you
call, like oscars and, uh, I forgot the different names that they had.

B.31:  Yeah.  

A.32:  But they would eat, they, actually they ate, when they got big enough they
would eat goldfish.

B.33:  Huh.  

A.34:  We would buy goldfish and feed them to them.  

B.35:  Well, these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that, but they
were.

A.36:  [Laughter].

B.37:  And, uh, I could see them picking on each other [laughter].  

A.38:  Yeah, I, I agree with that.  I, I, I, uh, [lipsmack], I don't really want
to deal with any other pets except for stuff like fish.  I --

B.39:  Yeah.  

A.40:  -- I thought a-, I've often thought about getting a fish tank.  But even
that's too much work [laughter] for me.

B.41:  Yeah.  Anyway, I finally got rid of, those all killed each other off and I
cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again, and established and I
got about half a dozen guppies from a friend and they just bred and bred and
bred, and they're r-, there must have been a hundred guppies in that tank.
And I h-, I too-, I must have taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to
the store two or three different times.

A.42:  [Laughter]. 

B.43:  [Laughter] Because there were so many of them I couldn't keep them down
[breathing].  But,

A.44:  And what did they do?  They, they just took them back?

B.45:  They took them back --

A.46:  Yeah?

B.47:  -- and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time.  

A.48:  Really?  

B.49:  So I, yeah.  

A.50:  Yeah.  That's, 

B.51:  Helped to buy fish food and filters [laughter].  

A.52:  Yeah, that's what my friend used to do with his other fish.  He used to
sell them back to the store --

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  -- and just, they'd buy them, but, uh, that's cool.  That's, 

B.55:  But, uh, then I, I went for a while where, uh, while I was pregnant with
our new little baby we, uh, I just kept forgetting to clean the tank and it
was really dirty for a long time.  But those fish still lived in there.  And,
uh, [breathing] finally, I cleaned the tank out [talking] and most of them had
disappeared [laughter].  Uh, and I don't think I've got any males in there
anymore, so they're not multiplying anymore.

A.56:  That's easier [laughter].  

B.57:  Yeah, yeah.  I need to get a new, uh, algae eater, though.  

A.58:  Do you do you still, you still have guppies.  

B.59:  Yeah.  

A.60:  So, you stayed with the guppies.

B.61:  They're still, there's about a dozen guppies in there right now [noise].

A.62:  Great, great.  Yeah.  

B.63:  So, 

A.64:  Fish are fun {faintly}.

B.65:  But that's the only thing we've got [talking].  Yes, you may.  I know
{speaking to someone else in the room}.  Sorry.  And, so you have fish, or do
you have,

A.66:  No, I, I used to have fish when I was a kid.  

B.67:  But you don't have anything right now.  

A.68:  But I don't have anything now.  I, I guess when I moved out of my parents'
house, I, uh, gave my fish to my friends and fish tank, I think I gave to
someone else.  Uh, but I thought a few years ago of getting one, but I've
moved around so much recently.

B.69:  Yeah.  It's kind of a problem moving them.  

A.70:  Yeah, they're not that easy, but, although living in New York City there's
definitely no other pet that you would want.  I mean p-, some people, a lot of
people have cats, some people have dogs.  I mean, I've, I've even seen big,
big dogs in small apartments and I don't really see that.

B.71:  You feel sorry for them.  

A.72:  Yeah, someday if I move out into the country [noise], and I get like a, you
know, like a Labrador or something like that.  Some, you know, bigger dog that
could kind of run around outside and stuff.

B.73:  Yeah.  

A.74:  But, yeah, you see these big, I mean, I see this guy in my building with
some, I think it's like a Golden Retriever, or something like that --

B.75:  Uh-huh.  

A.76:  -- and he, he's good, though, he takes him out all the time, or her out all
the time.

B.77:  You'd have to do it an awful lot, though.  

A.78:  Yeah.  This guy, he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog, so
he probably gets enough exercise.

B.79:  Yeah.
