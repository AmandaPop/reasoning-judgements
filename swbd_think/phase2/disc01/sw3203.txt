=========================================================================

A.1:  All righty.

B.2:  Okay.  

@A.3:  What type of home do you have in Dallas?  

B.4:  We have a, uh, four bedroom split brick home in, in Richardson actually.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, uh, we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three.  So, we've seen
it go up in value wise real well [laughter].

A.7:  Oh, good [laughter].

B.8:  Yes [laughter].

A.9:  And it's probably typical of your neighborhood.  

B.10:  Yes, yes.  It, it looks like all the others.  It's, uh,

A.11:  I'm in Plano just, you know, north of where you live.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  And, uh, we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that
just has gone in about two years ago.

B.14:  Oh, I know where that is.  Yeah.  

A.15:  So, my home is typical.  It's a, a brick home.  A two story brick home, and
it's typical of t-, of the other homes in our neighborhood too.

B.16:  Yes, you're in the, the styles that they have started building in the last
couple years with the real high ceilings,

A.17:  Yes.  

B.18:  and, uh-huh.  Thou-, those are lovely.  

A.19:  Yes.  The, the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living
room ceiling, we're from the north and we just couldn't stand the wasted
space, so we had them, we have a high entry hall and then we had them level
off our living room and dining room ceiling to, um, nine feet so we could get
bedrooms above.

B.20:  Oh.  Oh, nice.  

A.21:  So, that way we, we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the
area but we don't have so much wasted space.

B.22:  Yes.  

A.23:  And we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way.   

B.24:  Have you, um, found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are
quite a bit higher with those high ceilings?

A.25:  Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood.  

B.26:  Are they?  

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  Well, I would expect so.  I have wondered about the cooling and
the heating.

A.29:  Yes.  

B.30:  Especially the cooling.   

A.31:  Right, I know.  Our air conditioner, during the summer we, it's over three
fifty a month.

B.32:  Wow.  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  Yeah, just to air-condition it, so.  

B.34:  Well, how many bedrooms do you have in your home?  

A.35:  I have, uh, a master bedroom and a den on the main floor, and then upstairs
I have three bedrooms and I have, I'm a writer and I work in my home so,

B.36:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.37:  above the garage area I have a studio.  

B.38:  Oh, how nice.  Huh.

A.39:  So, it's not really a bedroom.  It doesn't have a closet and it,

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  and it's the size of a three car garage.  

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  So, that's where I work.  

B.44:  That's a pretty good size room.  

A.45:  Yes, yes.  

B.46:  That's neat.  

A.47:  So we, this is our dream home, and we just absolutely,  

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  love it.  I,

B.50:  Well, it sounds like a real nice one.  

A.51:  Yeah, we're, we're really proud of it.  I just hope we never have to move
again.  This is al-, [laughter],

B.52:  Right.  Where did you move from?  

A.53:  Uh, Detroit this last time.  

B.54:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.55:  We were there two years and,

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Do you like the Dallas area?  

A.57:  Oh, we love it.  

B.58:  And I would imagine that you have found that the homes ((down here)) are,
uh, a much better value down here,

A.59:  Yes, and they're much,

B.60:  aren't they, than they are,

A.61:  much better constructed down south than they are up north too. 

B.62:  Oh, really?  

A.63:  The,

B.64:  Now that's interesting.  

A.65:  Uh-huh.  The quality of the workmanship, we noticed a tremendous
difference.  Up north they just kind of throw them together.  Because we had
homes built in, in Detroit also,

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  and they just didn't care.  If the trim work didn't line up it's just,
that's just what you get [laughter].

B.68:  That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that
they don't feel like the quality of the homes, you know, are that good down
here.

A.69:  Oh.  

B.70:  And, uh, so that's interesting.  

A.71:  Yes.  Well, the carpenter and painter and, you know, everybody the marble
man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as
it was being built, and they'd say just look at this, and you know,

B.72:  [Laughter]. 

A.73:  [Static] they seemed so proud of everything they did.  

B.74:  Well, that's good.  

A.75:  And it really made a difference [static] to us.

B.76:  Well, I know as I, as I said our house is about seventeen years old and,
uh, we've been very pleased with it.  We've had no major problems with it.
Knock on wood [laughter].

A.77:  Yes.  

B.78:  And, uh, you know, it is with, uh, with the, you know, two children growing
up and now three grandsons roaming through it,

A.79:  Oh.  

B.80:  all the time.  So, and we like our neighborhood.  It, it, 

A.81:  Yes.  

B.82:  has, has grown and the majority of the people, you know, keep up the
neighborhood.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  That's important too.

B.84:  And that's very important and, and as I said it, it has ris-, risen in
value.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  But we bought back when housing was so low, 

A.87:  Oh.  

B.88:  and, you know, and now i-, you know, i-, then it started jumping by leaps
and bounds.

A.89:  Yes.

B.90:  It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit,

A.91:  Yeah, 

B.92:  but we're still fine.

A.93:  ours is pretty much level in the two years [static], 

B.94:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.95:  that we've been there.  We're hoping it takes off again, but --

B.96:  Yes [laughter].

A.97:  -- I don't know with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in
up on Legacy, we're hoping that brings in [/static] more people.

B.98:  It should bring up your property values a little bit.

A.99:  That's what we're hoping because,

B.100:  Your pricing.  

A.101:  we're, we're just real close to, to where that is.  

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  So,  

B.104:  I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area -- 

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- improves, I think the housing will go up.  

A.107:  I hope so too.   

B.108:  You know.  Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people
having lost their jobs,

A.109:  Yes.  

B.110:  and everything so that's, you know, that keeps prices down --

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  -- and value down and I'm sure the ((packs)), uh, or (( )) would like for
it to go up.

A.113:  Yes, I'm sure [laughter].

B.114:  [Laughter]. 

A.115:  For that reason it can stay the same,

B.116:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.117:  but [laughter],

B.118:  That's right [laughter].

A.119:  But we love being where we are.
