A.1:  [Sniffing]  Anyway.

B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  So I'm, so like, what did you eat the last time you went to a
dinner party?

B.4:  Well, the last time I went to a dinner party was down at the
lake --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and, uh, golly, it was a dish, uh, from, uh, down in
Panama --

A.7:  Wow.

B.8:  -- and, uh, it, I think the name of it was Paella and, uh, it 
was a delicious meal.

A.9:  What was it, what was the dish?

B.10:  Well, the dish was, was composed of, uh, steak and chicken
and shrimp all cut up, you know --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, into, uh, bite size portions --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and it had rice in it, and tomatoes and vegetables and,
uh, onions and green peppers --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and what you do is prepare this, uh, in a large, uh, oh it
looks like a large, uh, uh, garbage can, uh --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- uh, lid, you know --

A.19:  [Sniffing]  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- only turned upside down --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, this particular par-, this particular person that
cooked this, uh, cooked it over a burner, propane burner --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- course down in Panama they cook it right out, right over,
right over an open flame --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and,

A.27:  It's, it's Paella is what it is --

B.28:  Yeah, Paella --

A.29:  -- because I've --

B.30:  -- how'd you know?

A.31:  -- I've had that before.

B.32:  Oh, you have?

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  I'll be darned.

A.35:  I have friends who are Cu-, who, well, they're Cuban, and,
uh, I was in Miami one time, and they fixed that dish, and they
used squid in it, it, it had --

B.36:  Yeah, well --

A.37:  -- all kinds of meats and,

B.38:  -- right, and they omitted the squid --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and there's one other item, too, that they omitted --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I can't, I can't recall what that was but, uh, we don't --

A.43:  It's sort of like the, a ver-, --

B.44:  -- no, we don't like squid, it's too rubbery.

A.45:  -- it's sort of like a version of gumbo [laughter] --

B.46:  Yeah [laughter].

A.47:  -- it's sort of like Latin American gumbo or something.

B.48:  But all this was cooked together, they did serve French
bread, buttered, uh, bread, and, uh, and, uh, it was delicious.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  We had that in fact, uh, Saturday night of this last week --

A.51:  Wow.

B.52:  -- down at Caney City.

A.53:  [Sniffing]  Where's that?

B.54:  Oh, it's about sixty miles this side of Tyler and, uh, and,
uh, oh, about a hundred, uh, let's see, about seventy-five miles
from Dallas --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- in between Tyler and us.

A.57:  Oh, like near Canton, or,

B.58:  Yeah, is, Canton is north, uh, uh north of us.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  {Speaking with hand over phone}  What's the name of that lake
(( )).  {Back to phone} Yeah, it's on Cedar Creek.

A.61:  Oh, okay --

B.62:  We have --

A.63:  -- well I know where that it.

B.64:  -- we have a lake house down there --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- jointly owned with another couple here in the
neighborhood --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- so we're always having parties, and this particular time
we had, uh, what we call our, uh, our, our group here in, uh, in
Richardson, the, uh, what we're in, we gather together and go out
and eat at some restaurant or something of that nature --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- or go to some event.

A.71:  Well, I'm having friends over this weekend.  I'm from South
Alabama originally --

B.72:  South, huh.

A.73:  -- South Alabama, way down there.

B.74:  What town?

A.75:  Uh, close to Mobile.

B.76:  Mobile, uh-huh.

A.77:  Yeah, Foley, uh, and anyway, so what I, one thing I like to
do is I like to cook real Southern food, and so my friends, um,
whenever I cook, they usually like for me to really like cook
Southern food, so this weekend we're, I'm doing like fried
chicken, I'm going to fry chicken and have turnip greens --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and like a black-eyed pea salad, and, uh, uh, corn bread. 
So I mean.

B.80:  Turnip greens, with the greens too.

A.81:  Yeah, actually just the, with the greens, not much of the
turnips, 

B.82:  {Hand over phone} [cough].

A.83:  I don't like the turnip parts --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- but, so I mean it's kind of, you know, weird because you
think all your Yuppie friends wouldn't necessarily want to eat
like that, but they do.

B.86:  Do you like highly seasoned, uh, highly season it?

A.87:  The turnip greens?

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Oh, sometimes, like with pepper sauce, you mean?

B.90:  Yeah, I like to eat those green peppers just, uh, uh, whole,
you know --

A.91:  Well, I, I --

B.92:  -- with turnip greens.

A.93:  -- yeah, I, I like seasoned food, but I can, it can get too
much pretty quickly for me --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- I think, but.

@@B.96:  Well, did you go to Auburn down there,

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  just off the subject?

A.99:  Yes --  

B.100:  Well, good --

A.101:  -- I did.

B.102:  -- did you know a Spivey down there?

A.103:  A Spivey in Auburn?

B.104:  Yeah, that went to Auburn.

A.105:  [Sniffing] No, we had neighbors whose names were Spivey --

B.106:  Uh.  Wha-,

A.107:  -- Aubrey Spivey.

B.108:  No.

A.109:  They were neighbors of ours.  My parents live, now live in
Auburn --

B.110:  Auburn,

A.111:  -- my whole family, my sister, everyone lives in Auburn.

B.112:  I have a niece and nephew that graduated from, uh, from
Auburn --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

in the bowl down there at El Paso --

A.115:  Oh, goodness.

B.116:  -- Sun Bowl --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

from --

B.120:  I'll be darned.

A.121:  -- but anyway.
