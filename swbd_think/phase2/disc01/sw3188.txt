=======================================================================

A.1:  So have you done any painting projects lately?

B.2:  Yeah, this is a great topic for me,

A.3:  [Laughter].

@B.4:  because I just did my first two painting projects ever.

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  Was not, not a big deal --

A.7:  What kind of --

B.8:  -- two little deals,

A.9:  -- painting was it?

B.10:  The first one, um, I helped someone repaint an apartment, and
it was very easy.

A.11:  Uh-huh, it, was it?

B.12:  Yeah, and I've never painted anyth-, I always thought it
would be, so, you know, you'd have to hire someone if you needed
to paint inside your house or something --

A.13:  Yeah, 

B.14:  -- but I know I can do it.

A.15:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.16:  And the second one was I bought some toys at a, um, at a
craft fair.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little
girl for Christmas, and so I decided to paint them, and that
wasn't as easy as painting the apartment [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter] Oh, well, what kind of paint did you use for the,
um, bookends?

B.20:  Well, it's, uh, it, that's half the problem right there is
that it wasn't, it was a oil base, so I had to get, and when I
painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine
or paint thinner or anything in the house.  So I had it, had it
all over my hands.  At first I didn't realize, you know, I had
never painted anything, so I didn't realize --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- that I needed that.  I mean, I kind of knew, in the back
of my mind,

A.23:  So you can't use oil on wood?

B.24:  Well, no, you can use it on wood, but I just had it all over
my hands, and I went to wash the brushes out, and, uh, wash my
hands, and you can't wash it off with water.  You have to get
the, uh, a solution and,

A.25:  Oh, [laughter] so you had to go around with paint all over
you,

B.26:  Yeah, I had to drive to the store --

A.27:  #temporarily, anyway.#

B.28:  -- # yeah, I had to drive# to the store with paper towels all
over my hands to go buy --

A.29:  Oh, [laughter].

B.30:  -- some paint thinner, and (( )) and everything like that,
and then, um, downstairs in the apartment, I just us-, we just
used a latex base, and so you can drip it on, you know if you
dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real
easy to clean.

A.31:  Oh, is, is that what you usually use in the house, is latex?

B.32:  Yeah, and, and --

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  -- it, it just like the same with the toys, it's just
important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it, you know,
it says Safe for Children, and all that.

A.35:  [Inhaling]  Uh-huh, yeah, I heard about that.  I guess a
friend of mine had a, uh, well, she, she just started up a day
care center, and uh, the, one of the real strict, uh,
restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of
paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good
stuff --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- so, uh, she had that done.  But, uh,

B.38:  Have you painted anything recently.

A.39:  Well, um, so to speak, I had to paint this, uh, the inside of
this warehouse thing --

B.40:  Wow, was it huge?

A.41:  -- that you keep some, um, farm equipment in --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and, um, what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with
a sealer, and, uh, I had this big five gallon jug, and it was
like paint thinner.  I mean I, you know, it looked just like, it
was the viscosity of paint thinner --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- but, uh, you just took a roller and put it on there, and,
uh, if you saw that the wood was getting wet, you know, that was,
that was all you needed.  So.

B.46:  Wow.

A.47:  Yeah, it was, it used all of it.  I guess it was about three
hundred yards worth.  So.  Well, I guess it worked out.  It was
pretty easy, actually.

B.48:  Yeah, I think though, um, we're lucky that we didn't have to
do any detail work, because I don't know if I could, you know, I
don't know,

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  I don't know, must be difficult,

A.51:  Well what about the trim in your house?  Did you have to do
that?

B.52:  No, it was j-, it was really easy, I just, like, what, we had
a couple of different size brushes --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- you know, real easy, I went around the trim, and if it,
and there was wall paper, like I was do, just doing just the trim
outs that, around the doors and windows and there was wall paper
and --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- [Throat_clearing] if we got it on the wall paper a little
bit, we just wipe it right away before it dried, it came right
off --

A.57:  Oh, yeah,

B.58:  -- so there was no major mistakes, there was,

A.59:  Did you have, uh, one coat or two?

B.60:  Uh, two, actually --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- um, and it, there was, um, you know, around the windows,
if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after
that but that,

A.63:  Yeah, that would be really time, uh, a time saver.

B.64:  Well, yeah, if you just, you know we didn't tape anything,

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  we weren't that careful, but it wasn't, you know, I don't
know, it's, it's funny, it's like, if you just go slow, you don't
get, or at least I didn't get that many mistakes --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- I didn't make that many mistakes,

A.69:  Oh, me, I would have had to have taped the whole thing, and
then brushed around the edges, and, and then I'd have probably
rolled it on.  I'd, it would have taken me forever.

B.70:  Why?  Just because you'd be afraid to do it, or have you done
it before.

A.71:  Yeah, well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me
forever, so [laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter] Well, it wasn't, if it was my own I would have,
but my friend said, oh just go ahead, you just go ahead,

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  it's easy.  I said, Okay, it's your place,

A.75:  Well, how long did it take you all?

B.76:  Well, a couple of week ends we would go down --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- two or three hours on the weekends, and,

A.79:  So there was two of you all?

B.80:  No, there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs, and
there was, I was just painting because I don't know how to do
anything else [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter] Well, that's easy enough.

B.82:  So, there's a whole bunch of people. 

A.83:  Um.

B.84:  So now I feel like if I ever buy a house, I can probably
paint, if nothing else.

A.85:  I think I could probably do it --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- uh, as long as the hardware store told me what to buy,
then I could do it.

B.88:  But you know, I went in to a hardware store to get paint for
those toys, and the guy said, Oh, get this, it's a nice shiny
gloss, which was true,

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  but I didn't realize what, you know, pain it is to clean
the brushes and everything, if you don't have latex I don't if
it's worth the shine,

A.91:  Uh-huh.
