=======================================================================

B.1:  You like to eat.

A.2:  Well, I know,

B.3:  [Laughter]  We, we can even discuss restaurants.

A.4:  Oh, I tell you, I thought, uh, this is a great topic for me because I love
to eat out.  My husband says I'd eat out every meal if I could [laughter].

@B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  Um, I like, well my favorite restaurant --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- in the whole, uh, Dallas area is, uh, Siciliano's --

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  -- A Taste of Italy --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- I love Italian food, and they have wonderful garlic rolls and --

B.13:  Um.

A.14:  -- all of their entrees are wonderful.  Have you ever heard of that place?

B.15:  Where is it?

A.16:  There's one on Arapaho --

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  -- right at the intersection of Arapaho and Jupiter --

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  -- and then there's one, I live in Garland --

B.21:  Yeah, I was going to say that.

A.22:  -- yeah, there's another one over here real close to my house at Walnut and
Shiloh, but they've built some more.  There's one over in the Hurst area of
Fort Worth and,

B.23:  I know I've seen it somewhere.

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  What is it, is it, what's it like, just good food?

A.26:  Yeah, it is.  The atmosphere is okay, I mean, it's kind of dark and has
candle lit tables and that kind of thing, but it's not a real fancy place, you
know, it's just the food is just really exceptional.  And they give you real
big quantities --

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls
you can eat, and so by the time you get your food, you're already full.

B.29:  Value and taste.

A.30:  Yes.

B.31:  I, uh, I am not a, as much an Italian food fan except for garlic bread --

A.32:  Oh.

B.33:  -- and I could eat my weight in garlic bread.

A.34:  Oh.  Well, you could go there, what I do sometimes for lunch --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- is, uh, just, just get like soup and salad --

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  -- and eat their garlic bread [laughter] because it's so delicious,

B.39:  I would love that, I mean --

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  -- but, uh, you know, that's what, except for the type of food, that's kind
of what I like.

A.42:  Yeah, well, um, what's your favorite place?

B.43:  Um, my, I, any Mexican restaurant [laughter] --

A.44:  Oh, you like Mexican?  I like that, too.

B.45:  -- and, um, and, and I work, uh, downtown and so --

A.46:  Oh.

B.47:  -- there are a lot around here --

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  -- um, and, and, in, oh, you know, like the Knox central, you know, On the
Border I like for one kind of food, and then there's the holes in the wall I
like for another --

A.50:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.51:  -- another type, uh, and, uh --

A.52:  Well, that's neat.

B.53:  -- but what I look for is cost --

A.54:  Yeah, well, that's my main thing too.

B.55:  -- Yeah, well, I don't, I don't know.  I don't like noisy restaurants
either --

A.56:  Yeah, yeah.

B.57:  -- that's why I don't go to On the Border that much.

A.58:  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a real noisy place.

B.59:  Yep, and,

A.60:  I've only been there a couple of times, but the, the times I was there I
felt like my head was echoing [laughter] --

B.61:  And --

A.62:  -- and I was trying to talk.

B.63:  -- I mean, it's just, I don't know, it's a cavern, you know, it's just --

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  -- because it's so big and tall and a big room of full of lots of people,
or --

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- or what.

A.68:  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  Well, we have a, a restaurant down
here, a lot of people won't even eat there, but we like it, it's Pancho's --

B.69:  Yes --

A.70:  -- have you ever been there, Mexican buffet?

B.71:  -- the all you can eat --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- buffet.  My husband goes there for lunch --

A.74:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.75:  -- and he just, I mean, he thinks it's, uh, Mexican food's Mexican food,
you know it's, 

A.76:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, well they have a chili relleno --

B.77:  Really --

A.78:  -- or chili relleno, uh-huh.

B.79:  -- I've heard they're good.

A.80:  They're really good, and they, uh, the plates, the thing I like about this
place is they bring you all the chips and stuff you can eat --

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  -- plus they bring sopapillas, as many as you want --

B.83:  Oh, yeah.

A.84:  -- so, you know, a lot of places you have to order that separately.

B.85:  Extras, and, oh,

A.86:  Yeah, oh, it's really nice, and the children eat free.  We have two kids,
and one of them eats free, the other one's up above that age, but she still
gets a, you know, reduced price --

B.87:  So it's good, yeah.

A.88:  -- yeah.  So it's a real good deal for a family to go, and, you can just
really get full [laughter].

B.89:  That's, uh, that's what I like --

A.90:  Yeah.

B.91:  -- cheap, and then, but I li-, but do you like to go out or do you eat at
McDonalds a lot or stuff like that.

A.92:  [Sniffing] Well, I like, I really prefer to go, you know, some place where
I sit down and someone waits on me [laughter].

B.93:  Or, yeah.

A.94:  But, uh, my kids, of course, both love McDonalds, and, uh, Mc-, Burger
King, anything that's got a place to play [sniffing] --
 
B.95:  Right.

A.96:  -- so I spend time at those places, too, because I know how much they
enjoy, we go to Show Biz a lot.

B.97:  Yeah.

A.98:  Do you have children?

B.99:  No, I don't, but, uh,

A.100:  Oh, Show Biz is the noisiest place you can imagine.

B.101:  So you kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you.

A.102:  Right, that's right.  It, they have a wonderful area to play, you know,
they have big balls and --

B.103:  Yeah.

A.104:  -- games and rides and I mean, all kinds of stuff.  It's like a little
bitty amusement park in there [sniffing] --

B.105:  Oh.

A.106:  -- and it's really fun.  They have these, uh, puppets that get up and sing
and dance --

B.107:  Yeah [laughter].

A.108:  -- you know, [laughter] so it's real entertaining for the kids.  And the
food is good.  They have real good pizza there.

B.109:  Good pizza.  I love pizza, but I usually order that, pizza is what I
usually order, you know, at the house --

B.115:  I like their politics [laughter].

A.116:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I've just never cared for, for their pizza at all.  We
have a Little Caesar's down here --
 
B.117:  Oh, that's wonderful I've had their food  --

A.118:  -- yeah --

B.119:  -- before.

A.120:  -- yeah, it's really good, and very, uh, you get a good quality for the
money you pay [sniffing].  So.

B.121:  Do you, we get lots of coupons on our doors --

A.122:  Yeah.

B.123:  --  and that's [laughter] --

A.124:  Yeah.

B.125:  -- and I end up ordering from those --

A.126:  Yeah.

B.127:  -- like, Spinners or Winnsers or --

A.128:  Uh-huh.
