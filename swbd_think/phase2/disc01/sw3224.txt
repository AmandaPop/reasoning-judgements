@A.1:  Hobbies do you have?

B.2:  Uh, I, I do, I play tennis and softball, and I do a little
bit of woodworking around the house --

A.3:  Uh.

B.4:  -- furniture stripping and stuff like that.

A.5:  Do you do antiques?

B.6:  Uh, well, I have this, uh, huge kitchen cabinet, that I, it
was like an old cabinet, buildings from, it was built in nineteen
oh four --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- So I have this cabinet that had about eight layers of paint
on it, and I stripped it down, and I'm still working on it for
about, it's been about a year that I've been working on it --

A.9:  Oh, my.

B.10:  -- it's beautiful moldings and a beautiful cabinet, and as
soon as I'm done with it, it should be good.

A.11:  Uh.

B.12:  We use like the heat gun to strip it, and then, uh, chemicals
to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like
that.

A.13:  Do you do all this in your house?

B.14:  Yeah --

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  -- yeah.  It's, it's, it's, uh, it's probably movable, the
cabinet, but it would be tough to move.  I was able to take some
of the pieces apart --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- it's like a kitchen pantry, basically --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- I was able to take some of the pieces apart, like some of
the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff,

A.21:  Boy, that's an ambitious project.

B.22:  Yeah, a little too ambitious [laughter]. 

A.23:  [Laughter] Had you ever done any refinishing before?

B.24:  No, I'd done nothing like it before, but --

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  -- a neighbor of ours had done this, and it looked, uh,
looked nice, so, we figured we'd try it ourselves.

A.27:  So the neighbor was able to give you guidance.

B.28:  Um, a little bit.  She didn't tell us, she did say it was
going to be hard work [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah [laughter], and she was right.

B.30:  She was right, she was right.

A.31:  Yes.

B.32:  So, uh, what kind of work do you do?  You do any (( )) you do
anything like that or, what are your hobbies?

A.33:  Well, uh, I do a lot of needlework, and I also do puzzles for
magazines.  I get paid for this.  I've written two puzzle
books --

B.34:  Really.

A.35:  -- uh-huh.  And so, in my free time, even though it's not a
hobby and that I do get paid for it, I'm always developing new
puzzles and activities and, and word games, mind benders, that
type of thing.

B.36:  Cro-, you do crossword puzzles mostly or,

A.37:  No, they're, they're variety type puzzles.  Not crosswords,
just all different kinds.  Find the hidden word --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- and, um, you know, anagram type puzzles, acrostic,
cryptograms, uh, mostly for children, but some of them go up
through grade twelve.  So, and I've developed a lot of my own
type of puzzles like word snakes and grid graphs and things like
that.  So that's what published.  So if I have free time, I'm
usually sitting down with, uh, graph paper, doing some puzzles.

B.40:  Is that what you do for a living, or you do other things?

A.41:  I'm a writer for a living --

B.42:  Huh, (( )).

A.43:  -- I writer other things.  I'm a free lance writer --

B.44:  Fantastic,

A.45:  -- and, uh, I was a teacher for fourteen years, and I'm not
teaching because we've had to move around so much.

B.46:  Are you from Texas?

A.47:  No.

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  I, I live in Texas now, but I'm from Southern Ohio
originally --

B.50:  Oh, okay.

A.51:  -- and, uh, we've lived in Michigan, and it seems like
wherever I go I need to take forty hours of college in order to
update my teaching credentials --

B.52:  Right [laughter].

A.53:  -- so I decided I didn't want that to be my hobby any more,
after paying thousands and then moving the next year, so, um, now
I'm, I'm just writing at home.

B.54:  Well, you have, yeah, you have a good career for that --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- crossword puzzles and writing, you don't have to go out. 
My wife's, my wife's an editor, and we just had our first
child --

A.57:  Oh.

B.58:  -- so she's,

A.59:  What does she edit?

B.60:  Uh, magazines.  She worked for a dance magazine --

A.61:  Oh.

B.62:  -- and American, oh, you probably know the American
Booksellers Association --

A.63:  Right, A B A,

B.64:  -- right, she's worked for them for about the last year or
so --

A.65:  Oh.

B.66:  -- and they just had their convention in New York --

A.67:  Uh-huh, that's right --

B.68:  -- and, uh --

A.69:  -- I knew some people going up there.

B.70:  -- she worked on the show daily doing the, um, you know, the,
the daily, uh, magazine that they print out --

A.71:  Oh, well that's,

B.72:  -- so, that's good, and they've, now that she's possibly,
probably not going to go back to work, at least for a few years,
um, she's gotten free lance work from people --

A.73:  Oh, great.

@@B.74:  -- so, she gets to, uh, do her hot stuff.  I don't know if
they care what topics we talk about anyway, right [laughter].

A.75:  No, I don't think so, 

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  so does she take in manuscripts, like fiction, to edit --

B.78:  Um, yes, she would anything like that.

A.79:  -- because I'm in a large writers group here in Dallas called
Dallas Area Romance Authors.  Do you live in the Dallas area?

B.80:  No, uh, we're from New York.

A.81:  Oh, you're from New York.

B.82:  Yes.

A.83:  Well, there's a large group there, too.  It's a national
thing, Romance Writers of America --

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  -- and they're always looking for free lance editors.

B.86:  Oh let me, let me give you, let me give you, uh, our address.

A.87:  Okay, I can send her some information about it, because I
know they mail manuscripts, and for a compl-, well I think it's
three chapters and a synopsis, which would be around sixty pages,
the average price is around a hundred and fifty dollars for an
editorial service.

B.88:  Great, sounds good.

A.89:  So, okay, I'll write this down.

B.90:  She loves to read.  That's really the type of work that she
would like to do --

A.91:  Oh, good.

B.92:  -- even though she never did that professionally.

A.93:  Yeah,

B.94:  Yeah, she's started in other fashions, but not, not, not
specifically reading novels and editing them and, and
proofreading them and stuff.  So I think she would like that,

A.95:  Okay, let me take down the information --

B.96:  Great,

A.97:  -- and I'll send her who to, who to --

B.98:  Great,

A.99:  -- send her credentials to.

B.100:  The name's Mary C Murphy.

A.101:  Okay.

B.102:  And her address is two twenty-five --

A.103:  Two twenty-five

B.104:  -- Weston Avenue,
