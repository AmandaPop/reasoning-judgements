REMARKS:       Speaker A had a radio on in the background.  It was
hard to understand Speaker B several times.

======================================================================

A.1:  I'm Doug.  

B.2:  Hi.  How you doing Doug?  My name's Brad.  Where, where you from?

A.3:  From Pennsylvania.  

B.4:  Oh, okay.  

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  I'm from New York.  

A.7:  Okay.  So, anyway, now we're talking about drug testing, 

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  and all that.  

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  And, you ready?  

B.12:  Yep.  Okay.

@A.13:  Okay [beep].  So what do you think about it?  

B.14:  Oh, I definitely, I think it shouldn't be, it, it may be the only
exception is when there's public safety involved, you know, bus drivers, uh,
train, train, ((load them in)) stuff like that.  You know.

A.15:  Right.  I agree with you, basically, so it might be a boring conversation,

B.16:  Right [laughter].

A.17:  but, um, but anyway I agree that, um, only when there's any question of
safety does the employer have a right because otherwise I feel that the
measure of whether someone should stay employed or not it is just performance.
Whether you're able to do the job up to par and that, and if that can be done
it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life.

B.18:  Yeah, um, you're right it's [laughter] (( )) a hundred percent.

A.19:  Okay.  

B.20:  Uh, you know, but I, I, I think that, uh, I mean people think that they
have an interest in, in finding things like this out about their employers
because it's probably and, and maybe it's true,

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  that, that if, if you, if you tested people and if they were drug users
probably, I mean, I might even agree with you that they're probably going to
be less productive employees.

A.23:  Yeah, that,

B.24:  Um, I'm not sure about that but I would say that, that, that may be, that
might be a good indication.

A.25:  Well, probably at least on the average,

B.26:  But, but you could also, 

A.27:  Uh-huh.   

B.28:  you might be able to tell by a person's, uh, you know, whether they're
overweight or underweight.  Uh, you know, you might make certain ((true))
value judgments about that.  You can make value judgments probably ab-, about
a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's
private ability.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  You know, part, you know, part of an interest so, you know, I'm trying
looking for a word.  In other words,

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  you know, maybe, maybe, uh, heavier people, um, tend to not be as good
workers.  You know, or maybe, maybe extra, uh, uh, ultra thin people tend to
not be as good workers.  Maybe people that smoke cigarettes aren't as good
workers.  Uh, you know,

A.33:  Right.  Certainly.  And certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a
lot,

B.34:  Sure.  

A.35:  are probably not as good workers. I think that most drug testing programs
don't include that.  They're,

B.36:  Yeah, yeah.

A.37:  really interested in looking for illegal drugs.  It seems to be more for
the purpose of law enforcement than for the purpose of the employer's best
interest for,

B.38:  That's true.

A.39:  the job.  

@@B.40:  That's true.   

A.41:  Yeah.  Um [laughter].

B.42:  So, [laughter] we could talk about pets.  That was my last subject, you
know.

A.43:  Oh [laughter]. 

B.44:  [Laughter]. 

A.45:  Gee [laughter].  Um, well, we're supposed, 

B.46:  What's that music in the background?  

A.47:  Uh, that's Miles Davis.  

B.48:  Oh, okay.  

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  A little tribute to him or [laughter], 

A.51:  Uh, right.  Exactly.  It's on the radio.  Um, so, anything,

B.52:  Oh [laughter].  A tribute background for this conversation. 

A.53:  [Laughter] Right.  

B.54:  [Laughter] All right, ((well, anyway)) nice talking to you. 

A.55:  Okay.  

B.56:  I, I don't think we have to stay on the whole time.  

A.57:  Yeah, I guess not and,

B.58:  And we've, we've agreed too much.

A.59:  I think we've said about what we have [laughter] to say.  

B.60:  Okay.  Take care.  

A.61:  Sure thing.  Bye.

B.62:  Have a good day.  Bye-bye.  

A.63:  Bye.
