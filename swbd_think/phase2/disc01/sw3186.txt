=======================================================================

A.1:  All right, this is easy for me since I,

B.2:  And me too, because I eat out a lot.

@A.3:  Yeah, well I travel, I do about forty percent of my time is on the road.

B.4:  So you eat all your meals out.

A.5:  I eat a lot of meals out, well I'm also married and my wife is an A one
cook, but she enjoys eating out, so I have to share it with her.  And, uh,
actually it's very easy for me, because I, I have a prac-, make it a practice
when I am out, I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here.

B.6:  Sure.

A.7:  So, I look for just about anything, and it's, it's, uh, it's a lot of fun.
I don't have to worry, really worry too much about price considerations
because I, you know,

B.8:  I was going to ask you, could you go to, you know, nice places, and,

A.9:  Oh, sure, yeah, and it's, it's really great.  I, I,

B.10:  [Sniffing].

A.11:  I like different types of food.

B.12:  So where are your, what are the places, you know, memorable places you've
eaten?

A.13:  Uh, oh you na-, okay you name it.  Let's see, you've got one down in, uh,
down near, uh, Addison, uh, there's two restaurants that I particularly like
that I, every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta, Georgia, I make
sure I go, and that's Houston's.

B.14:  Oh, Houston's, uh-huh.

A.15:  Yep, okay.

B.16:  It's a great place.

A.17:  It's, it's great.  There's a, a restaurant in, um, right outside of
Reading, Pennsylvania, it's called Alfredo's --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to
recommend to a lot of people.  But it is fab-, fantastic.  Uh, there's a
restaurant, and I don't recall the name of it, uh, in, uh, Panama City.  Of
course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama City, uh, Panama, the
country, uh, Panama.

B.20:  Oh, okay, because I was thinking, well, I, I grew up in Panama City.

A.21:  No this is the country --

B.22:  I get it.

A.23:  -- this is the country Panama, all right?

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  And, uh, but I have gotten to quite a few.  And I go to Canada and get
quite a few restaurants up there.  I, you know, and I know the locations, and
I know the places, but I, lot of times I don't remember the names.  I'd have
to go back through some expense reports.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  But particularly, down in your area, I'm looking for some, some more
restaurants.  So, I, you know, I don't know what's, what's down there,

B.28:  #Do you like Mexican?#

A.29:  #the ones out in Addison.#

B.30:  Do you like Mexican food.

A.31:  Not particularly --

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  -- that's one of the few, why, which one were you going to recommend?

B.34:  Well, I mean, there's so many places here, you know, there's just, it's
just lots of good Mexican restaurants here.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  But in the Addison, well about everything that you could want in Dallas is
in the Addison area, anyway.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  I mean, now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi --

A.39:  Okay, I have a,

B.40:  -- that has a great, I've not been there, but it has a great reputation as
one of the best restaurants in Dallas, and now there's one in Addison.

A.41:  Okay, let, I'm, I'm writing it down [laughter].

B.42:  It's F, S it's S F U Z I.

A.43:  Okay.

B.44:  And it's on, it's in Addison, and it's a great place.  Also a great place
that they have like Cajun food is Copelands.

A.45:  I've been there.

B.46:  Now I really like Copelands.

A.47:  Okay, I've been there.  Um, one down there is the, uh, I think it's an old
schoolhouse.

B.48:  Oh, the, yeah, the, I know, no, I don't like that place.

A.49:  Well, I like the food, but I don't care for the clowning around.

B.50:  See, uh, uh, yeah, I, I, 

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  when I went, I thought the food was not good.

A.53:  Oh, really?  Oh I've had,

B.54:  Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of,

A.55:  That's it, that's it.  I've had excellent food there.

B.56:  See, I, when I went, I thought, the people drove me crazy --

A.57:  True.

B.58:  -- first of all --

A.59:  True.

B.60:  -- but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, all right, well, that's great.  Uh, no, Italian is fine.  I
make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there
in Ad-,

B.62:  Do you like, like Southwestern?

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  

B.64:  Well, now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill --

A.65:  All right.

B.66:  -- that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact.

A.67:  Really?

B.68:  And, um, it's great, I mean, their, they have, I think, sometimes I've been
when I thought, Well, it wasn't as good, but I went there recently, and I
thought, Well, this really is good.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  So that's, that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.

A.71:  Good.

B.72:  And, um,

A.73:  Well, this is great.  This is going to give me --

B.74:  A whole new,

A.75:  -- #some more places to go.#

B.76:  #dining experience.#

@@A.77:  [Laughter] Okay, fine.  I guess our time's about up, so.

B.78:  Well, they haven't beeped us, have they?

A.79:  Uh, well, they don't always.

B.80:  Oh, I thought sometimes they say, you know --

A.81:  Yeah, I --

B.82:  -- this is three minutes or whatever.

A.83:  -- they've been doing that when, uh, the circuits are busy --

B.84:  Oh, okay.

A.85:  -- and other than that, they, you know, leave you go about five minutes,
and then, that, that's about it.  I guess that's what they need for their
machines to get everything down pat, so.

B.86:  Okay,

A.87:  It was a pleasure talking to you.

B.88:  Well, thanks for calling --

A.89:  Okay.

B.90:  -- for helping us out.

A.91:  You bet,

B.92:  Bye-bye.

A.93:  Bye-bye.
