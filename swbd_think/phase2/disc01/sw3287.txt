=======================================================================

A.1:   ((I punched)) it.  

B.2:   Yes, I do.  

A.3:   Do you really?  

@B.4:  But not as much as I used to  [sniffing].

A.5:   What do you do?  

B.6:   [Lipsmack]  Well, I go, you know, the Y is right across from
the church.  

A.7:   Oh, yeah.

B.8:   So I go to the Y M C A and I do Nautilus.  I, I lift weights. 

A.9:   Oh, okay.  

B.10:   [Sniffing]  And I do it, basically really, I do it three f-,
three times a week.  

A.11:   Well, that's great.  And you don't do everything that's
aerobic?  

B.12:   Well, I did up until like [throat_clearing] when my allergies
got, until like August.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   And my allergies got so bad -- 

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   -- because I walked, and, uh, I needed like, you know, they
have Stairmaster at the Y but I just can't seem to get myself on
the Stairmaster.  

A.17:   Oh, I know it.  That's pretty boring really.  

B.18:   And I don't like exercising at all.  

A.19:   [Laughter]  Your in, 

B.20:   I mean, now, you know #now you are,# 

A.21:   #you and Doug.#  

B.22:   Huh?  

A.23:   You and Doug.  

B.24:   I hate it [groan].

A.25:   [Laughter]. 

B.26:   And you know, thank goodness the Y is right there.  I mean if
it took any of more effort at all -- 

A.27:   Oh, that is great that you have it right there.

B.28:   -- I would never do it.  

A.29:   Well, I love getting outside so, that's, I mean it's real
relaxing to me to, just to get out and walk or whatever.  

B.30:   [Noise]. 

A.31:   Most of the time I walk.  

B.32:   Yeah, I was going to ask you what you do.  

A.33:   Yeah, that's, I walk and, uh, usually with a neighbor.  

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   And, uh, 

B.36:   [Sniffing]. 

A.37:  and we walk about two and a half miles.  

B.38:   Uh-huh.

A.39:   So, um, [lipsmack], 

B.40:   Oh, I like to walk too, and I like to walk outside.  I don't
like to walk inside.  

A.41:   Yeah, right.  

B.42:   [Sniffing].

A.43:   And that, oh, oh, I don't either.  I, I, I like to walk, if I
have to walk inside, I don't mind going to, um, the oh, is it,

B.44:   To the,

A.45:   Plano Center or whatever.  

B.46:   Yeah.  The parks and rec place  [sniffing].

A.47:   Right, uh-huh.  Now that's nice but,

B.48:   It's nice but still it's inside.  

A.49:   It's not like being outside.  I agree.  And, um, [lipsmack]
so I d-, only did that in the wintertime.  

B.50:   Uh-huh.  

A.51:   But, um, anyway I'm, I'm just thankful to get to do it when I
get to do it I tell you.  Um, sometimes I'll get home, you know, at
least a couple a days a week and be able to on the, during the
weekdays, 

B.52:   [Sniffing]  Uh-huh.   

A.53:  and try to on the week, weekends too.  Well, how long do we
have to talk?  

B.54:   We have to talk three minutes I think.  

A.55:   Have we talked three minutes?  

B.56:   [Sniffing]  But anyway,

A.57:   [Laughter]  I know.  We're not supposed to talk but,

B.58:   That's about all I would have to say about exercising anyway. 

A.59:   [Laughter]. 

B.60:   I do it but I don't like it.  

A.61:   Oh.

B.62:   And I've decided that exercise has nothing whatsoever to do
with my weight, it's what I eat.  

A.63:   [Lipsmack]  Oh, I agree.  

B.64:   Because,

A.65:   And because I have done wh-, but now I have to say though that
if I didn't exercise, I'd weigh more.  

B.66:   Yeah.  I don't know that that's true for me because I lost all
that weight that I lost, 

A.67:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.68:  without ever exercising.  I had not started exercising, 

A.69:   Uh-huh.  

B.70:  and I lost thirty pounds.  But when I started exercising, then
I started eating more, 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:  because I thought, oh, well, you know, now that I'm exercising
and, 

A.73:   Uh-huh, you can.  

B.74:  it just doesn't work.  

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   You know, I feel better from exercising but it doesn't, 

A.77:   Weight #wise.#  

B.78:   #really# control my weight  [sniffing].

A.79:   Yeah, oh, I, I really do think the eating makes [laughter]
the, the big difference, but,

B.80:   Yeah, it does.  

A.81:  um, and you have to exercise, I think, for a long period of
time.  That's what Doug had, always gives up too soon before it
really starts feeling the real benefits from it.  

B.82:   Well, they s-, you know, like forty minutes basically.  

A.83:   But no, I meant, uh, months.  

B.84:   Like months?  

A.85:   Yeah.  

B.86:   Yeah.  

A.87:   I mean regularly for months because, 

B.88:   [Sniffing]  Yeah.  

A.89:   um, 

B.90:   That's true [sniffing].

A.91:  uh, the first time I started run-, I used to run and I ran for six months
with these friends.  And after that I sta-, I really saw the difference.  I, I
only did it before then because it was just fun to meet them and go run.  And,
uh, but after that I, I mean I changed sizes.  I didn't lose much weight but I
changed sizes.

B.92:   Uh-huh [sniffing].

A.93:   And, um, and I really could see a difference.  I could see a
difference when I played tennis and that kind of thing.  You know,
just had much more stamina and, and all that but,

B.94:   Yeah, and I did too.  Like when I was walking, you know, the
most and I have had a real good program going -- 

A.95:   Uh-huh.  

B.96:   -- I had much more energy.  

A.97:   Uh-huh.  

B.98:   And I literally would go walk and be a, be just a little tired
at first, but then I would have a lot of energy even right after I
walked.  

A.99:   Yeah, when you get back, 

B.100:   Right.  

A.101:  yo-, I, I know that helps me a lot coming i-, 

B.102:   [Sniffing].

A.103:  in from school to go out, 

B.104:   #Because I'm sure you are exhausted too.#

A.105:   #because I don't think I can possibly do it,# 

B.106:   I know.  

A.107:  and then I do it and I, I feel better.  

B.108:   Yeah.  

A.109:   Because then otherwise I'd come in and sit down and then I
feel like I can't get up.  

B.110:   Well, and it clears your mind and,

A.111:   Uh-huh.  

B.112:  you know I'm sure you are real stressed out,

A.113:   Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.114:  and [sniffing] tired and,

A.115:   Oh, I really am.  In fact, um, I'd, the last two weeks I'd, I
was, uh, I talked to Lynn yesterday afternoon because I had to talk
to her about something else, and I was telling her I said, gosh, I,
[breathing] I just don't know if I should sing in this thing, 

B.116:   [Cough].

A.117:  or not because I missed the last two weeks, and so if I come
Wednesday night [breathing] and Saturday, do you think I can do it?

B.118:   Oh, yeah.  If you do both, if you are at both of them.  

A.119:   And I have the tape, I've been trying to and earnestly listen
to it better later but, um, I had a program on Thursday night
before the one two weeks ago and just had a horrendous week, and I
was just so stressed it wasn't even funny.  And I just could not
possibly make it that, that Wednesday and then this last Wednesday,
Doug had a T I event, you know, a, where the wives went, 

B.120:   Uh-huh.  

A.121:  and then I, I really needed to go with him.  Not many things
like that happen that we have to go to like, you know, where the
wives have to go and so [breathing],

B.122:   Uh-huh.  

A.123:  and it was good that I went but, um, anyway I hated missing
two times.

B.124:   Well, if you are there, you know,
