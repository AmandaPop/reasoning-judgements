A.1:  Budget seems to be, oh, on a number of people's minds and often times when
people talk about cutting budget or wishing that government didn't spend
money here and there I hear them talk about, uh, cutting what they call aid to
some foreign countries.  And if you all don't understand why we give a million
here or a billion there and, and whether they like it or not or whether they
understand it or not, the government just simply develops dependencies on us.
Uh, start giving a country an X amount of dollars for so many years and their
whole economy and their whole, uh, system is, uh, used to it and then you
threaten with whatever you wish.  You know, you say, well you're not acting
right, we're going to withhold it or you're not doing this, that or the other,
or we want our base here or we want whatever and the government's been doing
that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and I'm not
sure if the general public, uh, thinks about it that way when they start
saying, why did we give money here or money there and, but there are some
things, even when we, what we spend in-, inside the U S it seems a little
far fetched and not necessarily for the common good, uh, lot of the money for
the arts seems to benefit only a few and usually those who are, uh, rich
anyway, or have a, have enough money to attend those kind of functions.  So
it, that's a, a controversy.  Course, there's only a hundred and seventy
million going to the N E A, but a hundred and seventy million's a bit and it's
something, so, what would you do or cut or change in the budget?

B.2:  Well, [throat_clearing] [lipsmack], uh, I agree with you on the
international aid, and, uh, I don't think a lot of people realize, too, on, we
can't live isolated.  Our world is such an international economy now and, uh,
[lipsmack] uh, especially with the problems in eastern Europe and Russia.
Uh, I know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so
many economic problems and, and I agree that we do, but, uh, it's also in our
country's interest, uh, to have a balanced world economy.  Uh, sometimes it
does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, and I have to admit sometimes I have wondered if, uh, we run into
problems, which is, is certainly a possibility if anyone would come [laughter]
to lend us a hand.  But,

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  Uh, I do think, uh, [lipsmack] this is a hard area, I mean there's some
areas that I feel, uh, need a lot of work, uh, [lipsmack] and improvement,
and education comes to mind.  I know they are working on trimming defense.
Uh, this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that
we're in.  But unless they start working on it, uh, it really, it, it already
is, is close to uncontrollable.

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:  But, I'm not sure exactly what practical steps could be, uh, I wish I had
some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage.  Uh, I do think
one step, one, something you touched on in talking about the arts is that, as
far as percentages go, I think, uh, money should go that benefits the most.
Uh, I th-, I believe in, uh, education, and not necessarily the [breathing]
federal, uh, it can be done on, on different levels, too, because I think
that's our future.  If we, uh, if our education system falls behind that of,
say, Germany and Japan and, uh, [lipsmack] some of the other countries we need
to be able to be competitive, uh,

A.9:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.10:  It's, that's an area I would not want cut.  There are a lot of areas I
think that money could be better spent.  I think sometimes the money they
spend on studies to decide on things is [breathing] way out of proportion.
And, and, of course, everyone's heard the stories of the several thousand
dollar hammer and, uh, you know, somewhere along the line, uh, there have been
some gross errors [breathing].

A.11:  Most of the, uh, national or the federal dollars that go toward any
project, uh, people tend to want accountability, but they don't want the
so-called bigger government, so that, they want,
