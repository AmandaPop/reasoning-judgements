============================================================================

B.1:  Well, let's see.  

A.2:  So what,  

B.3:  #As far as I'm#,  

A.4:  #So what# gets you?  

B.5:  Well, the thing I think that annoys me the most is, I have, I have young
children, a baby in the house and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep,
someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something.

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  And I think that, that is probably the most aggravating [laughter].

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  Uh, you know, it invades my time.  I'm the one that pays for the phone.
Uh, if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative and, and go find it,
you know.  And that just really does [breathing] aggravate me.  Uh, what do
you think?

A.10:   Well, I mean I, that's exactly the kind of thing I would have
said.  Although in my case it's my wife and I both work, we come
home and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner -- 

B.11:  [Laughter]. 

A.12:  -- the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and, you know.

B.13:  #Your time is, is #-- 

A.14:  #Yeah, it's, it's# -- 

B.15:  -- valuable, and,   

A.16:  -- like you say, very annoying and, uh, why, why do we let this happen.

B.17:  Oh, I, that's, that's interesting.  I the, the market seems to just be
growing, too.  I, I guess enough people are not speaking out.  I'm not
speaking out, that's for sure.  I just get aggravated about it.  And,

A.18:  Would, would you, I mean if you could legislate something, what would you
legislate?

B.19:  [Breathing] I really don't know.  I'm, I'm not into [breathing], uh, heavy
government legislate-, legislating of a lot of different areas, but I
[breathing], I don't know.  I just, I do particularly find it annoying.  Uh,
[noise] [lipsmack] I'm really not sure.  I haven't given that a lot of thought
if, if it should, should go, you know --

A.20:  Yeah.  

B.21:  -- to be,  

A.22:  It, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate
with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that.

B.23:  Well, that, #yeah, that might,#  

A.24:  #And the people# making these calls would be obliged to c-, compare --

B.25:  Identify themselves, yeah.  

A.26:  -- the, their lists -- 

B.27:  Right.  

A.28:  -- that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to
be called.

B.29:  Well, that would be a good --  

A.30:  Uh,  

B.31:  -- an interesting way, yeah.  

A.32:  And, that, that way, those who want it can have it and those who don't want
it, don't have to have it.

B.33:  Right.  

A.34:  Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of
enlisting yourself.

B.35:  #Right, you're,#   

A.36:  #Except even# unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these
things just sort of dial through all the numbers.

B.37:  Oh, is that right?  Oh, that's interesting.  

A.38:  Uh, automatically and,   

B.39:  And they just get everybody.  

A.40:  Right.  

B.41:  Oh, boy.  Well, I, I do wish that it would stop on my end --

A.42:  Yeah.

B.43:  -- because it, it seems to happen at the worst possible moments.  And I, I
guess the next one is, is door-to-door --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- solicitors.  I don't mind the children when they're selling things for
school.  I have kids and, you know, that's just kind [breathing] of --

A.46:  Yeah {faint}.  

B.47:  -- part of it but when it's adults selling a variety of things and
especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  -- uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe --

A.50:  Yes.  

B.51:  -- and, it's annoying as well.  

A.52:  And these, and these people may in fact be just looking to s-, find an
unoccupied house to rob.

B.53:  Right, you just, you really don't know, so I, I find myself being a l-, a
bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than [breathing] than I might normally be --

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  -- but, I do feel like it's a, an invasion of my space.  

A.56:  Yeah.  

B.57:  And, uh,  

A.58:  What about these telephone callers.  Sometimes they're door-to-door but
usually they're telephone callers who, who want you to basically help them
fill out a questionnaire.

B.59:  I've never quite understood the purpose of that.  Yeah, I, uh,

A.60:  Well, I think these people were hired by, from, from different sources.

B.61:  #Just be-,#  

A.62:  #Uh, with,# you know, and so, therefore, there's no one answer.  But, but,
yeah sometimes it's a market sur-, basically it's a market survey --

B.63:  Just a survey.  

A.64:  -- but they never say who, who they're really working for or what
[throat_clearing], you know, what --

B.65:  Yeah.  

A.66:  -- what, what questions are, you know,  

B.67:  There have been a couple of times when the, the, uh, whatever the subject
was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it and then there have
been several times when I just said, well, I just really don't have the time,
you know --

A.68:  Yeah {faint}.

B.69:  -- to deal with it at that moment.  

A.70:  Yeah.  

B.71:  But, uh, I don't get too many of those.  

A.72:  Yeah {faint}.

B.73:  I've had just a few.  

A.74:  Yeah {faint}.

B.75:  Uh, generally someone's trying to sell me something or,

A.76:  Right, well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales
pitch --

B.77:  Right, right.  

A.78:  -- too.  Other times [baby_crying] it's, you know, wasting your time -- 

B.79:  [Laughter]. 

A.80:  -- to collect the data they want for their [laughter] --

B.81:  Right.

A.82:  -- marketing purpose.  For which, if they would just pay me enough money --

B.83:  Yeah.  

A.84:  -- I would be willing to consider.  

B.85:  That's right.  

A.86:  But, but a dollar isn't it, you know, it's,

B.87:  [Laughter] Oh.   

A.88:  Uh, and I also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway
personal information.  Uh, when, [baby_crying] when the call comes and, and
they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know, somebody is asking me my
opinion on all of these things, and so I start answering and then you, you
know, you go down a path --

B.89:  Right.  

A.90:  -- uh, and you don't know where it's going to end.  

B.91:  Yeah.  

A.92:  Uh,  

B.93:  Well, we,  

A.94:  In fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality
of what you've revealed and, you know,

B.95:  That's true.  

A.96:  This isn't, you know, prob-, most likely not to, going to be used against
you, but it could and,

B.97:  Yeah, you just never know, I guess.  

A.98:  And that seems to be something that should, should really be outlawed.

B.99:  That, yeah, I, I,  

A.100:  Because it's subject to abuse and it,  

B.101:  Asking for information is, is, I can't really see that, I think they ought
to, if, if nothing else, they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and,
you know, when it arrives at your house, oh, I,
