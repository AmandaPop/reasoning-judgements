===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, basically I can tell you that I like just about every music there is
except for, uh, uh, real hard, hard rock,

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  I really can't get into that but --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- I go from classical all the way to, uh, jazz and country and --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- uh, soft pop, uh, so I pretty much have a, a wide range of, uh, what I
like, and --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- just, there isn't any particular music that I enjoy more than just
listening to all kinds --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- so that's about it.

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  I can even take the (( )) now, it's, it's pretty neat music --

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  -- that they came out with, so.

B.16:  [Laughter] I'm pretty much the same way, but there's like certain types
of country western I can't handle --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- that twangy stuff,

A.19:  Uh-huh,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  sure, the old, old stuff that came out, I think it was, was it, oh,
jeez, came out with some of that, Hank Williams, you talk about twangy.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  [Laughter] My in-laws listen to the kind of music I hate [laughter].

A.25:  Oh, yeah, the old, old country,

B.26:  The old, real old, yeah.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  But other than that, I like pretty much everything.

A.29:  Yeah, yeah, that's the way I am, too, so, other than, uh, as far as
instruments, I can go from piano to the saxophone.  Lately, you know, with the
new music that has come out, some of the really good, uh, music --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- they have the saxophone playing, and it's so funny, because you can take
an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself.

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.33:  {Talking to daughter} Oops, are you okay, Tiana, come here honey.  {Resumes
talking to caller} Oh, my daughter just fell.

B.34:  [Laughter] Do you like Kenny G?

A.35:  Uh, yeah, a little bit.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  I can, I can pretty much, {talking to daughter} Oh, it's all wet, Tiana.
{Resumes talking to caller} I just wiped, uh, did the floor, and she slipped.

B.38:  On, no.

A.39:  Anyway, but, uh, um, yeah, I can take all kinds of music pretty much --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- except for when you get, like I said, into the real hard rock,

B.42:  Yeah, the heavy metal,

A.43:  Yeah,

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  I have no interest in that, I, I don't have interest of losing my ears,
let's just put it that way,

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  hearing, anyway,

B.48:  Yeah, I saw Peter Townsend on T V last night, and he said he's lost most of
his hearing --

A.49:  Uh-huh, sure.

B.50:  -- [Laughter] and I thought, no wonder [laughter] so.

A.51:  Uh-huh, exactly.

B.52:  Um.

@@A.53:  [Child_talking] Okay, well it was good talking to you then.

B.54:  Well, same here.

A.55:  Okay.

B.56:  You all have a good day.

A.57:  You, too.

B.58:  Bye-bye.

A.59:  Bye now.
