REMARKS:        Women sounded very much alike at times.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, some of the things I like to do are, I like to knit.  I knit
sometimes, and I sew --

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- and, uh, I like to sew sometimes for my kids.  I, I sew clothes for them
every once in a while.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  [Lipsmack]  And I make quilts.  

B.6:  Oh, wow, that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do.  I do mostly
hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery and I'm, I'm beginning
to get a little bored with cross stitch.  I was thinking maybe need to learn
to quilt.

A.7:  After a while, cross stitch, I th-, I [laughter] don't know.  I have --

B.8:  It gets boring.  

A.9:  -- to put it away and then I have to bring it back.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  You know.  And, and, uh, I don't know why that is.  I don't know if it's
looking at the little th-, [laughter] things every time.

B.12:  Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I
think.

A.13:  Yeah, that might be it.  

B.14:  But I do --

A.15:  That might {faint}, and yet, there's,

B.16:  -- a lot of it in the car.  We,  

A.17:  Oh, do you?  

B.18:  Yeah, we commute from Plano to Dallas -- 

A.19:  Oh. 

B.20:  -- so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work
done and --

A.21:  Oh, I bet.  

B.22:  -- I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car. 

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  I don't know that I could even think about quilting.  You have to have a
pretty good frame, don't you, to --

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  -- do any kind of quilting work?  

A.27:  Yeah.  Uh, I've not really done any, too much challenging, uh, stuff.  I, I
can do it with a, a needle and thread --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- you know, but, uh, and get about five small stitches in, which is pretty
good, but it's very long.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a
quilt in a long time [laughter].

B.32:  Oh, I bet.  

A.33:  So, uh,  

B.34:  But, it's such a lost art.  

A.35:  So, uh, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.  

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  That's so much easier.  

B.38:  Yes.  

A.39:  But, uh, the other ones are very pretty.  They're, uh, we have a quilt on
our bed that's, instead of, like, yarn --

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- they tied, uh, ribbon into it.  

B.42:  [Lipsmack] Oh. 

A.43:  And it's real pretty.  

B.44:  I bet.  

A.45:  It's real pretty.

B.46:  There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.  She had
crocheted a full bedspread.  It's kind of a hobnail --

A.47:  Oh, wow.  

B.48:  -- looking thing.  And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long
time --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- I think oh, why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because
she could crochet and --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people
just don't know how to do.

A.53:  Now did you say you could knit?  

B.54:  No.  

A.55:  Oh. 

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Haven't tried that either.  

A.57:  Well, I was going to say because,  

B.58:  I want to learn to crochet.  I, 

A.59:  Because if you could knit, you could crochet.  

B.60:  Really?  

A.61:  It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the,
the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  And then you just use your right hand with the hook.  

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  And that's not, it's really not too difficult.  You could learn that, I'm
sure --

B.66:  Yeah.   

A.67:  -- and pick that up.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  It's not too difficult.  

B.72:  It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by
hand with a needle.

A.73:  Yeah {faint}.

B.74:  But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine.  I never
learned, and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is
relaxing to me.

A.75:  Isn't that interesting.

B.76:  But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew. 

A.77:  I think that's really interesting.  

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  Huh.  And yet, you know, I think about, you know, you said you do a lot of
needlework and, and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns --

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  -- that people do.  And I, I just think that, uh, that's one of, one of the
arts that I think are really pretty.  And a lot of people don't do that
either.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  You know, and so,  

B.84:  Well, it's hard to find the time.  I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car
time ability probably --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- just not sitting down at all [laughter].  

A.89:  [Laughter] That's true.  You know, and, and I always think, well, I can do
this and watch T V or something --

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  -- you know.  And, uh, it seems like I always get my mind carried away to
something else and then it doesn't --

B.92:  Well, it,   

A.93:  -- quite work or,  

B.94:  I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary.  It's so I
find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do
needlework and I get frustrated doing that so [laughter].  Just give it up.

A.95:  And, you know, I like to sketch.  I can, I can sketch something, like if I
see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that --

B.96:  Ooh.  

A.97:  -- and that's nice and everything, but, you know, it's funny, I can't
[laughter], I can't draw it out of my own head --

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- kind of thing.  I wish I could.  And, and yet I can't do, you know,
like, like, uh, craft, uh, on wood.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  I can't do that painting thing.  

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  And yet,  

B.104:  I'm the same way.  If I see something, I can copy it, but I certainly can't
create.  I admire people that have that in their minds already.

A.105:  Yeah, me, too.  Me, too.  I know a woman who's just wonderful at that.

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  And I look at it and, you know, you look at those things and you wish so
badly that you could do them.  I guess, if you wanted to, you could take
classes and learn.  I guess that's the only way I could do it.

B.108:  Well, sometimes, even with that.  I, I think you have to have some,
