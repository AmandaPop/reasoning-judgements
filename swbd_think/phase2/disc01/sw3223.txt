======================================================================

A.1:  Well, I almost forgot the topic, I was waiting so long for,
uh, for it to find somebody.  Um,

B.2:  It's on your favorite T V shows and why.

@A.3:  Right, well, so what is your favorite T V show?

B.4:  Uh, MAJOR DAD.

A.5:  Oh, you like that one?

B.6:  I, I love it, I think it promotes good family values, and
it's funny.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Uh, I've never really watched that one.  You know,
it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch
certain shows --

B.8:  That's ri-, yeah.

A.9:  -- and, uh, you know, there's, so there's only a few that I,
that I like to watch routinely.

B.10:  What kind do you like to watch?

A.11:  Probably my favorite is, um, oh, well, I like shows like
GROWING PAINS and, uh, what's the other one now, they moved from
Tuesday night to Wednesday night, so I don't get to watch it very
much.

B.12:  WONDER YEARS?

A.13:  WONDER YEARS, yeah, that's my favorite.  Uh,

B.14:  I like both of those real much also.  I, I think basically,
they pr-, same thing, they promote family values.

A.15:  Yeah.  WONDER YEARS, I, I guess that is supposed to be put
out at a time when I was growing up or whatever.  I guess I can
really relate to it, and, uh, it's just a real cute show [sniffing].
Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, uh, 
I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.

B.16:  [Inhaling] I do, too.  I, I don't like it, uh, lot of the
shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, uh, oh, GOLDEN
GIRLS and, some of them tend to get so risque, and when you --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- have children --

A.19:  Yeah,

B.20:  -- uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother
me --

A.21:  Right, right.

B.22:  -- and, uh, that's one of the reasons, I mean, if you want to
go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE
ON THE PRAIRIE --

A.23:  Uh-huh, yeah, my wife really likes that show,

B.24:  -- yeah, which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- uh, and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are
just, um --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- uh, they, they go after, well, they, like I said, the
risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to
watch.

A.29:  Yeah, well, there was, but there's a sense of ho-, I guess,
purity in the show, like one of my favorite shows used to be
HAPPY DAYS --

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  -- but, uh, you know, Richie always used to be so, you know,
just so honest and pure --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- I guess, and when he left the show, you know, that, it
seemed to be missing that part of it --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and I never did like it after that --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- so, I don't know, I, I say, see the same thing in like
WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch.  There
always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.

B.38:  Yeah, I, I agree.  Uh, do you like the sports programming?

A.39:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.40:  Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain
extent.  I'm, our whole house is baseball fans --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and, uh, we enjoy that, and, uh --

A.43:  So you're going to watch a game tonight?

B.44:  -- oh yeah, oh, yeah [laughter].

A.45:  So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything?

B.46:  Uh, probably the Pirates, but only because of Steve Bushel, I
guess --

A.47:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.48:  -- otherwise I really don't care that much, but, uh, you
know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him, and, uh,
I'd like to see him do well, like all the way to the bank --

A.49:  Yes.

B.50:  -- I guess [laughter].

A.51:  Yeah, he's a nice guy.

B.52:  [Laughter].

A.53:  I take it you live in the Dallas area.

B.54:  Pardon?

A.55:  Do you live in the Dallas area?

B.56:  Live in, live in Plano.

A.57:  Uh-huh, yeah, I live in Garland, and, yeah, I, I like Steve
Bushel, but I don't really like the Pirates.  I'm a big Saint
Louis Cardinals fan --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- so, uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves
over all, they, you know, they --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- they've come from so far down, I really would like to see
them do well.

B.62:  Well, yeah, yeah, it's, uh, so I keep hoping the Rangers are
going to do [laughter].

A.63:  Yeah, one, one year they, maybe they'll make it, I don't
know --

B.64:  [Laughter] Right.

A.65:  -- so, but, uh, yeah, I like sports programming quite a bit,
but, uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the, and, you know,
that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true,
we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago, and her
daughter was talking about birth control, you know --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time,
and, you know, she's only seven years old, so,

B.68:  Well, it's, so many of them now, um, you know, it just seems
like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in, and --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- and, uh, you know, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm an adult --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- and I have adult tastes now, but I don't need that --

A.73:  Yeah, yeah.

B.74:  -- uh, I, I like things that, uh, are, are wholesome, I
guess.

A.75:  Yeah, well that, that seems to be more our values, too, like
the WONDER YEARS, I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe
for teenagers, you know, or, and you can kind of relate to it --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- you know, I don't know, that's, I enjoy that a lot --

B.78:  Yes, yes.

A.79:  -- but, uh, you know, I agree with you, the, and it's funny
because the shows, like a lot of them that used to be considered
risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they
maintained, people would watch them because there was that, uh,
you know, there was really the period that was going on there, I
mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls, but
everybody perceived him that way, and stuff --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another
girl, the show just died --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are
that way,
