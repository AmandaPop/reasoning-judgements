========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, (( )) I missed a part of it.  We're to talk about what,
lawns and gardens?

A.2:  Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work
you do.  I'm, I'm a putterer.  I chose that topic because I
really like gardening --

@B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  -- as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty
yard.

B.5:  Uh-huh.  I, well, it's, it's, it's very [laughter] str-,
strange that I got this call because my wife just called me.  I
was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn --

A.6:  [Laughter]  Oh.

B.7:  -- and, you know, mowing the lawn and removing some old
petunias out of the garden, this type of thing is working right
in to start planting fall, fall bulbs.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  Uh.

A.10:  We've had a late fall it seems like, the weather, in fact
today it's really warm, and so many of the summer flowers are
still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up, but you know
you need to pretty soon.

B.11:  Well, that's the way this was.  The, the petunias were really
great.  Our mums are, are beautiful,

A.12:  Oh.

B.13:  Uh, I don't know if we, I don't think we've had a frost up
here.  I've been, I was down in (( )) for a week, so I don't know
what happened last week --

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  -- uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, I don't know if it's
late.  I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer so I can get a lot
of stuff down out here.

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  Uh, I, I enjoy it.  We came here, we just moved into this,
well, we moved in in November and put all, all the landscaping in
this, this year.  We came from nine years in a condo, uh, and
working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- you know, unless you really wanted to, so --

A.20:  So now --

B.21:  -- (( )).

A.22:  -- you have the chance to really create and, and spread out.

B.23:  Right.  You know, I can't, this is my third, third house I
think, I've owned, um, but, uh, it's interesting, you know, the
only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling, and it sort
of gets away from me --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- if you're not with it.  So, but, uh, I, I enjoy most of
it, and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a
little old, and I start looking forward to, you know, having
other things to do with my --

A.26:  The grass --

B.27:  -- (( )).

A.28:  -- not growing so fast [laughter].

B.29:  Well, it is, it is for me because I've been doing a lot of
fertilizing.  We had a terrible summer, we had a drought --

A.30:  Oh.

B.31:  -- and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,
and now it's really growing and I'm trying to establish a good
root, root growth --

A.32:  Um --

B.33:  -- you know, for the winter.

A.34:  -- ours seems to have slowed down here.  We're not having to
mow every week religiously --

B.35:  Really.

A.36:  -- but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of
the, the summer flowers out --

B.37:  Uh.

A.38:  -- I still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a
surprise this late in the year.

B.39:  Oh, really?

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  Um.

A.42:  But like today, it's eighty-five degrees --

B.43:  Oh, yeah --

A.44:  -- it's really strange,

B.45:  -- yeah, I hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in Plano,

A.46:  But that'll change --

B.47:  Yeah [laughter].

A.48:  -- real quick [laughter].

B.49:  Well, he always --

A.50:  We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.

B.51:  -- [Laughter] he waits until it gets about seventeen below up
here and then he calls us,

A.52:  Oh, my gosh.

B.53:  yeah it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.  So [laughter].

A.54:  Well, Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as
plants, because our summers are so terribly hot --

B.55:  (( )).

A.56:  -- and we have ice storms every year.  And there just aren't
that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- extremes.  Some of the things that used to be hardy are
getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.

B.59:  Yeah, that is, I was, you know, I was like conditioned to
it --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- they, they have to be hardened to it that's, that's
strange with me.  You know, you think, Dallas, you know, almost
semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of
problem, but,

A.62:  Well, for the most part we don't, but we have usually just a
pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.  Well, the summers
have gotten where they're a lot hotter --

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  -- but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the,
the plants that we have around.  We've noticed that crepe myrtles
don't do as well as they used to --

B.65:  Really, oh do they.

A.66:  -- and, uh, pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we 
could plant all the time --

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  -- you, you --

B.69:  I love,

A.70:  -- really take a chance with them freezing,

B.71:  Yeah, I love the, uh, the landscaping, like I say, my 
brother-in-law (( )).  I get to Carrollton quite a bit.

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  I go there on business, and I really enjoy getting around and
seeing the different areas with different gardens, and Texas is,
D-, Dallas is very nice.  I really enjoy it there.  The
landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- very enjoyable gardens, and my wife and I,

A.76:  Except for the lack of trees, out where we are #[laughter].# 

B.77:  #Well.#

A.78:  It was all cotton fields, and when we get to other parts of the
country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.

B.79:  Yeah, that we have, you know --

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  -- Ohio's a very pretty state.  We moved, in seventy-six we
moved to Chicago, we lived there for five years, and I remember
the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt, uh, we were
coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window
and she said, she said, (( )) there's no trees down there.

A.82:  [Laughter].

B.83:  (( )) this is Illinois, you're not.  And, when we got out to
the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house,
there were no trees --

A.84:  Um.

B.85:  -- because the farmers had cleared all the land --

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  -- and now all of a sudden it was being developed, and the
first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees,
