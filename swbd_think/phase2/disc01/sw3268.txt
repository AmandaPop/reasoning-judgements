======================================================================

A.1:   Well, the types of vacations that I usually take, I usually
come back more tired after my vacation, 

@B.2:   [Laughter]. 

A.3:   then I do, you know, before I take it.  Um, I need to
definitely take a vacation where all, all I do is rest.  And I
guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home.  

B.4:   Oh [laughter]. 

A.5:   But, um, the vacation spots that I like to go to are places
like the Bahamas and Florida.  I enjoy the beach.  

B.6:   Oh, [laughter] I am, after our last summer's vacation I am
antibeach.  

A.7:   [Laughter] Antibeach.  

B.8:   Uh-huh.  We went to, uh, Cape Hatteras.

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   Well, we, we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland,
and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days.  

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   And, uh, uh, the, the waves were huge.  I've never quite seen
waves like this one --

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   -- and, uh, I was standing in water not more than, in barely
above my ankles --

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   -- and, uh, you know when the waves go in the waves go out they
kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.  

A.17:   Right.  

B.18:   And I was standing there talking to my daughter and this
really big wave came and totally threw me, and one foot did not
come out of the sand, [laughter] and it tore the ligaments in my
knee [laughter]. 

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   So I'm never going to another beach again, [laughter] ever. 
I'm ma-, 

A.21:   [Laughter]  You might be like I am.  I enjoy, I enjoy going to
the beach and to beach areas, but I really don't like to get in the
water, the ocean.  I prefer a swimming pool [laughter]. 

B.22:   Well, I, I love to go and play around.  At least I always did
but although actually, [breathing] my, I like the mountains.  I,
uh, [breathing] --

A.23:   Uh-huh.   

B.24:   -- I don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about
living here.  

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   And I basically, [breathing] don't want to go to a hot place
[laughter] on vacation [laughter].

A.27:   Right.  I can understand that.  

B.28:   Oh.  I, my dream vacation is Alaska.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.

B.30:   This is -- 

A.31:   That would be nice.  

B.32:   -- just someplace I've always wanted to go and someday I hope
we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation [laughter] up
there.

A.33:   Uh-huh.  I know I've taken several vacations to Colorado, and
I used to live in Colorado, oh, sometime ago for a couple of years,
and I really enjoyed that.  

B.34:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'd, I'd like that.  Uh, I haven't been to
Yellowstone for a long, long time --

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   -- and I would, uh, we've been talking about going there next
summer [breathing].  Uh, I don't know we'll have to, to,  

A.37:   Yeah.  I've never been up to the Yellowstone area.  So,  

B.38:   It's been a long time.  But you know, it seems when your
family is, is different places, a lot of trips involved [laughter]
going to visit [laughter]. 

A.39:   That's right.  That's right.  You got that.  

B.40:   Oh, I'm, we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year -- 

A.41:   Uh-huh.  

B.42:   -- because this is where my husband and I are both from.  And my
mother and his mother [breathing] live up there feeling -- 

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   -- lost and alone because we moved down here [breathing]. 

A.45:   Uh-huh.  

B.46:   And, uh, [breathing] we've got one of our, our kids lives out
on the east coast and so we have to, you know, go to those.

A.47:   Well, you have, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to
[laughter] then.  

B.48:   Well, I know but I'm tired of them [laughter]. 

A.49:   [Laughter] Right.  

B.50:   I want [laughter] to go someplace different [laughter] up
there.  

A.51:   That's right.  

B.52:   Uh, my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to
begin with, uh, [breathing] money be no object.  

A.53:   Right.  

B.54:   You know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where
I want to, rent a car if I want to.  

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   Uh, you know, just the, really the nicest hotels [laughter]
and stuff like that and -- 

A.57:   Uh-huh.   

B.58:   -- and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little
side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, um,
[breathing] you know, [laughter] again we, we ((fit)) that in there
or not.

A.59:   Right.  Uh-huh.  

B.60:   And, uh, that, that's what I, um, you know, that's what I
would like to do.  I have no interest, for example, in taking a
cruise.  

A.61:   Uh-huh.

B.62:   To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a
few days is [laughter] mind boggling.  

A.63:   It would be sort of, I feel like it would be confining.  

B.64:   Yeah.  

A.65:   You know I would rather much rather get on a plane and get
there --

B.66:   Uh-huh [noise].

A.67:   -- and then enjoy myself.  

B.68:   Yeah, I just, uh, that, that does absolutely nothing for me. 

A.69:   Uh-huh.   

B.70:   [Noise]  But, uh, I don't know I can say that I think my, my
favorite spots are still to go, to go where there's mountains and,
and a lot of trees and, and wildlife to view and, and, uh, [/noise]
I like that kind of stuff.  I could just sit there all day and look
at the scenery [laughter]. 

A.71:   Yes.  

B.72:   [Laughter]. 

A.73:   I, I agree.  I can, I can do that too, and, uh, you know, I
think if I had, if I had the money, I would probably go to Europe
every year.  

B.74:   [Noise].

A.75:   Because, you know, I think that they have, they have it all
over there in just a few tiny,

B.76:   [Noise]. 

A.77:   ((two, two)) miles.  

B.78:   Uh-huh.  

A.79:   You know, there's mountains and there's beaches and [laughter]
it's all right there.  So,

B.80:   Yeah.  Uh, I, I guess I've never really thought about it that
way.  Our, uh, [laughter] we have [breathing] a daughter who's
almost thirteen but she's, uh --

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   -- a very picky eater and our, our standard excuse for not going
someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death
if we, [laughter] you know, we took her --

A.83:   [Laughter] Oh.

B.84:   -- [Laughter] ((into the)) country so [laughter].

A.85:   Right.  

B.86:   So, [laughter] but I, I would like if, you know it was
anywhere in the world to go, I guess, even though it's hot, I would
like to go to Africa.
