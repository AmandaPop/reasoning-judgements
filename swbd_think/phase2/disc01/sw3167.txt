=======================================================================

A.1:   They suggested some sort of a recipe, uh, for, uh, [lipsmack]
company, for entertaining.  Did you have anything in mind that, uh, 
you'd like to share?  

B.2:   Well, I, uh, just had a Christmas Around The World party --

A.3:   Ooh.

B.4:   -- the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres.  

A.5:   Oh. 

B.6:   And I fixed, uh, a crab meat spread that is real good and real
easy. 

A.7:   Ooh, that sounds good.  What,   

B.8:   It's, uh, it's like, uh, eight ounces of cream cheese -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- softened, and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice
and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and
mix it and spread it out onto a plate.  And,  

A.11:   One tablespoon of worcester?  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   Okay.  

B.14:   And then you take and, uh, [lipsmack] cover that with
drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce
and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers.  

A.15:   Oh, that,   

B.16:   And that always goes over real well and it's real easy.  

A.17:   How much chili sauce did you say?  

B.18:   It's one of the small bottles.  

A.19:   Like eight, 

B.20:   I don't think, uh,  

A.21:   Not eight ounces.  That would be a lot.  

B.22:   [Lipsmack] Well, it's about eight ounces.  

A.23:   Is it?  

B.24:   It, it, uh-huh.  

A.25:   Okay, this would make a lot, right?  

B.26:   Yeah, it would probably make, well, it doesn't make quite as
much as you think, but, yeah, spread it out because you keep the
cream cheese kind of thin.  

A.27:   And how much crab meat did you use?  

B.28:   One tin.  

A.29:   One,  

B.30:   Of the flake.  Uh-huh.  And drain it real good.  

A.31:   One can of flake.  

B.32:   Uh-huh.  

A.33:   Oh, okay.  Have you ever used the, uh, imitation, yet?  

B.34:   Yes, I have.  I used it, uh, last Christmastime.  Uh, what did
I put it in?  I think I just served it by itself.  There's like a
little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff.  

A.35:   Ooh, that sounds, I've tried it and then I have it here on
hand for about a week and then all of a sudden it dawned on me,
wait, is this totally imitation and then I found out, I went back
to the store and they said it is a fish product.  

B.36:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.37:   So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you
know -- 

B.38:   Right.  

A.39:   -- once you buy it.  

B.40:   Right.  

A.41:   I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on
some of these new things they're making that you really don't know
what the shelf life is.  

B.42:   That's very true.  

A.43:   You know.  

B.44:   Very true.  I had bought a cheesecake, uh, and they very
nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen, which I felt was
real nice.  

A.45:   Oh, that's a good idea.  

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   Whose was that?  

B.48:   It, uh, was, uh, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's.  

A.49:   (( )),  

B.50:   And I got it, do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up
there?  It's real,  

A.51:   Uh, Sam's, right, right.  

B.52:   Yeah, okay, that's where I picked it up.  It comes out of
Chicago and they're very good  -- 

A.53:   Oh. 

B.54:   -- cheesecakes.  

A.55:   Oh, that sounds good -- 

B.56:   Yeah.  

A.57:   -- because that's great.  That must be the ones that look like
they're packaged for a restaurant.  

B.58:   Yes, yes.  

A.59:   Okay, I, I've,  

B.60:   And they have, and they have the little papers between them. 

A.61:   Right.  Oh, hey, that sounds,  

B.62:   And I think they're, what, about nine dollars and something. 

A.63:   Right.  And it's something good to have on hand, too.  It's
frozen -- 

B.64:   Yes.  

A.65:   -- in the first --

B.66:   Yes.

A.67:   -- place, right?  

B.68:   Yes.  

A.69:   So, you can, uh, it is frozen, isn't it?  

B.70:   Yes, it is frozen.  

A.71:   And then you can re freeze.  

B.72:   And I thaw it and then you can re freeze it.  And, 

A.73:   Hey, that sounds great.  

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   That s-, 

B.76:   It was, they're very good, very good.  And that's the one
thing that I hate to make is desserts.  

A.77:   Oh, do you?  And that's my favorite.  

B.78:   Is it?  

A.79:   And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one
piece of it.  

B.80:   Oh, I love to eat it, but I don't like to make it.  It takes
time and you have to rack your brain,  

A.81:   [Laughter]. 

B.82:   and, time I don't have anymore [laughter].  

A.83:   That's the, that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is
thinking of what I'm going to serve.  

B.84:   Uh-huh.  It is.  

A.85:   I, I said I can make it no time.  It's trying to think, and
then we just, uh, built a new home and I have one of these kitchens
that's the center of the house -- 

B.86:   Uh-huh.  

A.87:   -- and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you
cooking.  

B.88:   That's right.  

A.89:   Which is funny.  

B.90:   And your mess [laughter].  

A.91:   This, [laughter] well, this is what everyone has said.  They
said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen.  

B.92:   [Laughter]. 

A.93:   [Laughter] And I said, yes, I decided it looks better in
BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality.  

B.94:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.95:   But, uh, what I have learned in the, uh, ten months we've
lived here, is it that when I entertain, I have to have my foods
all prepared and in the oven with all the, [laughter] everything
through, ready -- 

B.96:   Right.  

A.97:   -- to serve.  

B.98:   Right.  

A.99:   Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your
dining room seeing your mess, like you said.  

B.100:   That's, that's right.  

A.101:   So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right
out of the magazine.  

B.102:   Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want
to, I want to party, too.  I don't want to sit in the kitchen and
be putting an olive on something [laughter].  

A.103:   You're right.  

B.104:   You know.  

A.105:   And you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large
kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to
come, you know, they'll come in the kitchen and I said, out, we
have the chairs on the other side [laughter] of the counter
[laughter] -- 

B.106:   Correct [laughter].  

A.107:   -- for guests.  You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen
[laughter].  

B.108:   [Laughter]  Sounds, 

A.109:   And it, it has worked out.  But at our point of life we know
many  of the people we're entertaining -- 

B.110:   Right.  

A.111:  -- uh, well enough that they know, you know, it's very much at
home type situation.  

B.112:   Well, a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples,
again, that we've known a long time like you, they, uh, we all
bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier.  

A.113:   Well, we even -- 

B.114:   Anymore.  

A.115:   -- have a better one.  Now we decided [laughter] that we all
meet, we have it worked,
