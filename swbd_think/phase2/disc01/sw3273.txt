========================================================================

A.1:   Uh, how do you feel about this topic?  

@B.2:  Um, I think [laughter] it's just fine [laughter].  But, um,
I just worry about some things that show up as drugs that aren't. 
Like I've heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium.  I think
they're in the same family.  

A.3:   Right.  

B.4:   And just little things like that, that, um, [sniffing] you
might get in big trouble for and just because you ate a roll with
poppy seeds on it, you know.  

A.5:   Right.  I understand completely.  

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   You know I, I feel the same way [swallowing].  You know, I,
I believe in drug testing.

B.8:   Uh-huh.  

A.9:   You know there's nothing wrong with that because something
like that if you work in some, some types of, some type of
situations that makes it, um, makes you unmanageable or --

B.10:   Uh-huh.   

A.11:   -- something like that that you could either hurt yourself or
somebody else.  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   Uh, I might really agree with it, you know, if they tell you
before you come into employment --

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   -- like when you're going to get hired.  

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   You know, I don't see anything wrong with them telling you
that you might have to go through one and, and then sometimes I
have a hard time understanding the random.  

B.18:   Um.  

A.19:   You know, the I'll pick you out and I'll pick you out,

B.20:   [Sniffing].

A.21:   and I'll pick you out --

B.22:   Well, random -- 

A.23:   -- and you go through the drug test.  

B.24:   -- random I heard was to make it fair so they wouldn't think
you're just picking on somebody.  

A.25:   What's that now?  

B.26:   I've just heard that the random testing -- 

A.27:   Uh-huh.  

B.28:   -- like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever -- 

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   -- is just so they can't be accused of, you know, picking on
someone in particular that they're suspicious about, you know.

A.31:   Yeah, that's true.  {Very faint} That's true.

B.32:   But, um, because I work at a school and they were thinking
about doing that.  

A.33:   Were they?  

B.34:   Yeah, but even though they were I mean who's to say it's
random or not, you know [sniffing].

A.35:   Right --

B.36:   They could just,

A.37:   -- and who's to say if it's for sure.  

B.38:   Uh-huh.  They could be saying it's random and they could be
not random.  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   So, [laughter] -- 

A.41:   Yeah, where I,  

B.42:   -- you can't prove that.    

A.43:   Yeah, where I was hired they made us sign something saying
that we could be, um, put through one at any time.   

B.44:   Huh.  

A.45:   And we were like, oh, okay [laughter]. 

B.46:   Uh-huh.

A.47:   But we did have to sign that.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   But, um,

B.50:   Well, I just worry, uh, you know, I don't care so much about,
well, I mean they ca-, they'll get fired whether they do their job
or not, you know, if the drugs --

A.51:   Right.  

B.52:   -- affect their job that much, but, um, I just worry about people
that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and --

A.53:   Right.  

B.54:   -- stuff like that [laughter]. 

A.55:   Or air traffic controllers [laughter]. 

B.56:   Yeah, exactly.  Or pilots or [sniffing],

A.57:   Right.  Or even somebody on a line, you know --

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- that could run machinery or something --

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- like that.  Yeah, that's how I feel too.  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   I don't know.  Have you been in Dallas a long time or,  

B.64:   Uh-huh, about twelve years.  

A.65:   About twelve years?  

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   I just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom -- 

B.68:   Huh.  

A.69:   -- that you see a drug test.  

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   But,

B.72:   I think like if you work in defense like I know people have
had to have drug tests for that and --

A.73:   Uh-huh.  

B.74:   -- but then they have like a secret clearance -- 

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   -- [Sniffing] but, um, then I know people that work at, um,
you know, normal companies and -- 

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   -- some do and some don't require drug testing.  You know if
it affected the work they might, you know, wonder but it's not
required.  

A.79:   Because I was really surprised because I, I go into, my major
is in accounting.  

B.80:   Uh-huh.  

A.81:   And I've looked at ((an)) accounting positions.  

B.82:   Uh-huh.  

A.83:   And definitely a pli-, a position I've applied for has either
come up -- 

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   -- or, you know, they won't make you go through one.  

B.86:   Huh.  

A.87:   Which was a real surprise.

B.88:   Even to change position?  

A.89:   What's that?  

B.90:   To change positions?  

A.91:   No, to get a position.  I just moved --

B.92:   Oh.  

A.93:   -- here in June.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  

A.95:   And, uh, from South Dakota, and I was real, you know, shocked
to here how many that did.  

B.96:   Uh-huh.  

A.97:   You know from where I'm from it's not, 

B.98:   [Sniffing]. 

A.99:   that popular or that much (( )).

B.100:   Huh, so a lot more here?  

A.101:   Yeah.  

B.102:   I guess because it's a big, big city or, 

A.103:   Yeah.  You know like Dallas has got more people than the whole
state of South Dakota.  

B.104:   And we're closer to Mexico.  

A.105:   Yes [laughter].

B.106:   [Laughter]. 

A.107:   That's very true.   

B.108:   Uh-huh.  

A.109:   And, uh, you know I guess I never was awakened to it.  You
know I knew it was out there, but I knew, you know, I didn't know
it was to a-, an extent.  

B.110:   Uh-huh [sniffing].

A.111:   And, uh, I'm glad it's there.  

B.112:   Uh-huh.  

A.113:   You know but, um, it was just something that I come across
that I wasn't really, you know, used to.  But, you know -- 

B.114:   Uh-huh.  

A.115:   -- I, I feel fine with it.  You know, that's not a problem.  

B.116:   Uh-huh, me neither [sniffing].

A.117:   Yeah, (( )).

B.118:   But I'm, there's some people that, I think there's a
cheerleader that's suing a school --

A.119:   Uh-huh.

B.120:   -- for wanting to drug test her [sniffing].  And I haven't heard
if she's going to win or not but, um, like a high school.  But
because,

A.121:   Can he-, can a high school do that?  

B.122:   Huh?  

A.123:   Can a high school do that?  

B.124:   Um, I think because it, she's in the extracurricular -- 

A.125:   Uh-huh.  

B.126:   -- thing, cheerleading.  

A.127:   Uh-huh.  

B.128:   They, they said they could but, um, I think she's going to try
and use like the constitution against them -- 

A.129:   Uh-huh.  

B.130:   -- saying it's an invasion of her privacy or something like
that.

A.131:   Uh-huh.

B.132:   And, [sniffing] and I don't know she might win.  I'm not sure. 
I haven't heard.  

A.133:   Yeah, I've never heard of a high school asking a student to do
that --

B.134:   Uh-huh [sniffing].

A.135:   -- I guess.  Huh.  

B.136:   Uh-huh.  

A.137:   Is that in Dallas or,

B.138:   Uh-huh.  

A.139:   That's in Dallas?  

B.140:   Oh, the high school --

A.141:   Yeah.  

B.142:   -- that she's from?  

A.143:   Uh-huh.  

B.144:   Um, no, I think it's out further west.  Maybe California or --

A.145:   Oh, really?  

B.146:  -- something.  Uh-huh.  

A.147:   Huh.  

B.148:   I was like, see I teach so I thought you meant where I teach. 

A.149:   Oh, you do teach?

B.150:   Uh-huh.  In Richard-, in Richardson.  

A.151:   Oh, really?  

B.152:   Uh-huh.  

@@A.153:   Um, my brother is the Admissions Director at U T D.  

B.154:   He's the what?  

A.155:   The Admissions Director --

B.156:   Oh.  

A.157:   -- for U T D.  

B.158:   Uh-huh.  

A.159:   So I kind of know something about Richardson but,

B.160:   Uh-huh.  

A.161:   Yeah.

B.162:   How neat.  So he's, um, (( )) ((with the students)),
