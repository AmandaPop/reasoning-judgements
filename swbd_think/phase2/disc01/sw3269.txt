======================================================================

A.1:   Real excited when I heard this.  So far I've been trying to
call all day because [laughter] I keep getting these subjects like
capital punishment so --

B.2:   Oh, yes.  

A.3:   -- football, I love this.  This is great.  Well, we're from
Colorado so we're Bronco fans [baby_crying].  And, um, we just
moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we
first moved here and they lost again.  That was pretty pitiful, but
they seem to be doing pretty good this year.  

@B.4:   Well, I was from Illinois originally, and I grew up a Bear
fan.  And, uh, then we moved here even when we knew we were being
transferred here we became Cowboy fans.  

A.5:   Oh.  

B.6:   And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger
((Staubach)). 

A.7:   [/Baby_crying].  

B.8:   And we kind of got spoiled.  

A.9:   Yeah.  

B.10:   We expected it to continue forever.  I think they're doing
pretty well this year though.  

A.11:   Well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game
this year?  

B.12:   I think two.  

A.13:   Two.  

B.14:   I know they lost, yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia.  

A.15:   Yeah.  But they're not doing bad.  People are pretty surprised
that they, I mean they beat the Giants.  

B.16:   Yeah, and wasn't that fun.  I went to the balloon festival in
Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, 

A.17:   [Laughter]. 

B.18:   and I must say I attracted a lot of attention.  

A.19:   I bet [laughter] [baby_crying].

B.20:   People running up saying, oh, what's the score, what's the
score?  

A.21:   Oh, boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were
just right on it [laughter].

B.22:   That's right and that's exactly what they said, {trying to
sound like a man} my wife dragged me away from the television.  

A.23:   Yep.  

B.24:   You know, but I wasn't, I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't
have been there.  

A.25:   Yeah.  Yeah, well, I am, I'm a big football fan.  I never 
wou-, my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to
have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just
hated it.  And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time
watching football on Sundays.  

B.26:   Yeah.   

A.27:   And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football
and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend.  I couldn't
see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I
didn't, 

B.28:   [Noise]. 

A.29:   like football.  So, 

B.30:   That's exactly where both of the wives [/noise] came from I
think.    

A.31:   Yep.  

B.32:   It was, uh, you know, it's easier to join them than fight
them.  

A.33:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.34:   And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy
football.  

A.35:   Yeah.   

B.36:   And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh yo-,
did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited
[laughter] about, 

A.37:   [Laughter]. 

B.38:   these games.  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  Well, I do.  I just, I love it.  It's such, I just
think it's such a fun sport.  And, uh, I'm just hoping that the
Broncos can get back on their feet.  We're not convinced that we're
going to be Cowboy fans yet.  But, uh,

B.40:   Well, it takes a little brainwashing first.  

A.41:   [Laughter] Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to
the idea that we're staying here [laughter]. 

B.42:   Yeah.  

A.43:   That's even harder.  But,

B.44:   Are you, uh, transit usually?  I mean do you stay not in one
place too long?  

A.45:   No, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. 
We've only been married for five and a half years.  And, uh, we
have two small children, and he had a, uh, just got transferred
here to E-Systems, [lipsmack] so.  

B.46:   Well, it will take you a little while but you'll probably
always have a soft spot in your heart though for --

A.47:   Oh.  

B.48:   -- for Denver.  

A.49:  Well, I tell you this, the weather here and there's no mountains or
anything, you know, and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, you
know, there's snow and it's an adventure [laughter].  And here, yeah --

B.50:   Oh, I know.  

A.51:   -- you've just got to drive down [laughter] to the, to the
stadium and, uh, 

B.52:   Well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both
worlds then --

A.53:   Yes.  

B.54:   -- as they're talking about doing.  But, uh, Dan Reeves is a
pretty neat guy anyway.  

A.55:   Well, he's from here.  

B.56:   Yeah, that's right, you know --

A.57:   So,

B.58:   -- he was one of ours, one of our boys.  

A.59:   Yeah [laughter].  That's what I hear.

B.60:   So we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're
playing the Cowboys.  

A.61:   Which is rare.  

B.62:   Yeah.  

A.63:   Which is good.  Yeah.  But, uh, I, you know, it's funny in, in
Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the
last, I don't know, five [barking] or six years whatever it's been.
Um, they have these songs on the radio.  They take moder-, popular
songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the Broncos and stuff.  

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   And they had, I was just thinking about one the other day. 
Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at
school, um, but they did the Johnny Angel.  They did Johnny Elway
to that.

B.66:   [Laughter] Johnny Elway.

A.67:   And, and I was trying to get my son to sing that.  My husband
was just having a fit {trying to sound like her husband} don't
have him sing that song [laughter].  But, they, they do a lot of
fun things.  I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport
that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it.  Because you
know there's just, 

B.68:   Well, there is so much about it --

A.69:   It's exciting.

B.70:   -- to like.  You know --

A.71:   Yeah.  

B.72:   -- it's so exciting.  And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl
here, of course, they put together some real cute songs, and we all
ran out and bought the records, and now we feel like they're kind
of a collector's item.  

A.73:   Yeah.  Yeah, they probabl-, I, I wish I would have bought the
tape when I was in, uh, Te-, in Colorado.  Because, uh, I, I think
about that a lot.  But, you know, when I first moved here was when
they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. 
This interstate seventy-five song.  

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it
done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.  That was kind of a
funny song but they sure do, it seems to me like they really love
their Cowboys here.  Even when they were losing pitifully, you
know, people still support them.  We drive by some houses everyday
that have big signs, we love the Cowbo-,
