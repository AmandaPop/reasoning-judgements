=====================================================================

A.1:   Well, course, my favorite team is the Texas Rangers, so I
watch them all the time.  And who do you watch?  

B.2:   Uh, the Mets.

A.3:   The Mets.

B.4:   But I don't do that anymore.  Because, uh, they're doing lousy
[laughter].  I don't know.

A.5:   [Laughter] This isn't their best season, is it?  

B.6:   No, no.  

A.7:   Well, the Rangers are a few games behind Minnesota, but if we
could win the next, oh, I guess we'd win, have to win most all of
them.  We could still go to, to the race, to do the,

B.8:   I think you're, uh, definitely an avid fan [laughter]. 

A.9:   [Laughter] Well, I watched the two games, the last two
nights.  

B.10:   I gave up on the Mets around August, you know, so,

A.11:   Oh, is that right?  

B.12:   How many games out is Texas?  

A.13:   Pardon?  

B.14:   How many games out are they?  

A.15:   I think they're out six.  And so they have to still win almost
every single game that they have to play to the end now.  

B.16:   Right, right.  

A.17:   Or else,

B.18:   Yeah, I think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or, or
Texas has to lose three games or some -- 

A.19:   Yeah.  

B.20:   -- combination -- 

A.21:   Yeah.  

B.22:   -- of that.  Uh, maybe -- 

A.23:   I don't know -- 

B.24:   -- next year.  

A.25:   -- Minnesota's won a good game.  They're, they're doing a good
job this year.  I don't know.  

B.26:   Yeah, they are.  They are.  

A.27:   They really, but I'm going to watch tonight because Nolan
Ryan's going to pitch, so, I always like to watch him pitch.  

B.28:   Yeah who's, who's, he used to be on the Mets -- 

A.29:   Yeah.  

B.30:   -- a long time ago.  

A.31:   Uh-huh.  

B.32:   But who's, who's, who else is like Texas' big players that,
that, uh,

A.33:   Well, uh, we just traded Buechele and I really liked him,
but, he's gone now.  So I, I guess, uh, Sierra, I like to watch 
him -- 

B.34:   Uh, Ru-,   

A.35:   -- bat.  

B.36:   Right, he's supposed to be good.  

A.37:   Yeah, he's, he's really good.  Franco's good except that, uh,
he's got injuries right now.  His hamstrings down in the bottom of
his legs.  He can't run very well.  But he usually hits [laughter]
a home run, then he just trots around the bases, it's okay.  And,
uh [lipsmack],

B.38:   He's the shortstop, though, right?  

A.39:   Yeah.  

B.40:   Franco.  

A.41:   Well, they've moved him now, since he can't move that quickly,
since it hurts him.  

B.42:   Right.  

A.43:   They moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into
that area in, that runs now in between the shortstop area.  And he
takes second base.  

B.44:   And Sierra's an outfielder?  

A.45:   Uh, Sierra, let's see.  Yeah, Sierra's into the, see, middle
field or left field.  He's not in left field, he must be center
field.  

B.46:   Yeah, I don't, see I don't know the American League that well. 
Once in a while I watch the Yankees.  

A.47:   Do you?  

B.48:   Uh, but rarely, and, uh, but this guy that I'm, I work with is
in this rotisserie league -- 

A.49:   Oh. 

B.50:   -- where they, they choose,

A.51:   Now, what's that?  I don't know what that is.  

B.52:   Well, you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and
everything like that so he's always talking to me about the
American League.  

A.53:   Oh. 

B.54:   Like he gets points for every time, uh, I think he has Ruben
Sierra on his team and every time he gets a home run or steals a
base or gets a hit -- 

A.55:   Oh.  

B.56:   -- he gets a certain amount of points and then you get to
pictures and stuff like that.  

A.57:   Oh {very faint}.  

B.58:   So he's always talking about the American League which is,
like I said, because I watch the Mets, I don't really know that
much about -- 

A.59:   Yeah.  

B.60:   -- the American League.  

A.61:   That's right.  

B.62:   You're not an Astro fan?  

A.63:   Uh, no, not too [laughter], not too much.  

B.64:   [Laughter]. 

A.65:   I, I guess I just don't watch them that much.  Uh, I like to
watch the Oakland A's play.  They have a lot of good players, too,
but I haven't watched them for a while, so I don't know how they're
doing too well this season.  

B.66:   No, they're not, they, they were doing well for a while, but
then they kind of fell off.  Do you get all the games out there? 
I mean, you get, you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like
that?  

A.67:   Uh, once every so often.  Mostly Rangers games come on.  

B.68:   Right.  

A.69:   Because that's our area, but, uh, [lipsmack] every once in
a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a, another league on,
you know.  

B.70:   Right.  

A.71:   But it's, it just depends how the, you know, how they fill the
time sometimes.  Anyway, I, uh, we got,

@@B.72:   This is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments
thing.  

A.73:   What?  

B.74:   This is the first time I've done one of these conversations. 

A.75:   Oh, is it?  

B.76:   Yeah.  

A.77:   Oh. 

B.78:   So -- 

A.79:   Well, it's kind of fun.  

B.80:   -- I didn't even expect it.  I just, I happened to have the,
uh, I didn't even know what my, uh, my personal identification
number was.  

A.81:   [Laughter]. 

B.82:   I just happened to have the folder right in front of me.  I'm
glad I brought it into work, just,   

A.83:   Yeah.  Uh, isn't, it's a fun thing.  I think you'll like it. 
It's a, it's a ((new)) thing to do.  And, uh, [lipsmack] anyway,
we just, uh, if you get run out of things to say, then you say
good-bye [laughter]. 

B.84:   [Laughter]  Okay.  Well, it was nice talking to you.  

A.85:   It was nice talking -- 

B.86:   And, uh -- 

A.87:   -- to you, too.  

B.88:   -- be good.  Thank you.  

A.89:   And have a good day.  

B.90:   Okay, bye-bye.  

A.91:   Um, bye-bye.
