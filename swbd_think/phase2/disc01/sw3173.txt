========================================================================

A.1:  All right, why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd
look for in your next.

B.2:  I think our next car, I would like something like a, an economy car that
gets really good mileage and, uh, one that's really reliable.  I would, I
think probably not a, a brand new car, but maybe something like a Nissan
Sentra.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Or something like that, uh, something my husband,  

A.5:  And, of course, it has to have air-conditioning [laughter].  

B.6:  Oh, absolutely, air-conditioning and a radio, uh, A M, F M and a cassette
player and, uh, what else do I want [breathing].

A.7:  Does it have to be a special color?  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  Uh, I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice.  

A.9:  [Laughter].  

B.10:  You know, a, a navy blue or a,

A.11:  It sounds like something your husband would drive, right?  [Laughter].

B.12:  Yeah, that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to
work.

A.13:  Yes.  Well, I don't think we're looking for another car right now because
we just bought one, but when we were looking we were looking for something
that had enough seat belts, of course, and we wanted air-conditioning and a
five speed and that was kind of iffy, but that made it better economically, 
so,

B.14:  I think that's something we might want, too, is some kind of standard
transmission --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- at least rather than automatic.  

A.17:  We'll probably have to look for another second car sometime and we'd look
for about what you're looking for.  S-, but probably real cheap, too.  It
[laughter] wouldn't be a used, used car, so, but, no [breathing].

B.18:  I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or
whatever that it would still be nice enough that, uh, you could take someone
in it and not be embarrassed [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.  Would you like four doors or doesn't really matter.

B.20:  Prob-, well probably, probably that would be a good idea, yeah.

A.21:  Yeah, it, it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes.

B.22:  That's right.  So if we wanted it to take people out it's, that's a good
thought.

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  I, that hadn't crossed my mind.  

A.25:  It would be fun just to win one, wouldn't it [laughter]?  

B.26:  Yes, I would go for that.  

A.27:  That would be great.  All right, well, I think that's all that we need to
say.

B.28:  Well, thank you for calling.  

A.29:  All right, we'll talk to you later.  

B.30:  All right.  

A.31:  Bye-bye.  

B.32:  Bye.
