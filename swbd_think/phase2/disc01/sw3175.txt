B.1:   Hello.  

A.2:   Hi, uh, [lipsmack] basically, I wear pants.  I'm a real
pants person and, uh, like when I'm at home since, and I'll say,
I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, uh, I wear a pantsuit
most of the time.  Not a pantsuit, I guess pants and a shirt and,
uh, in the summertime I wear cotton tops.  Cotton top shirts and in
the winter I wear, uh, like sweaters.  I like sweaters a lot.  And
so I do that.  But when I go out for meetings [lipsmack], uh,
then I will wear sh-, either, uh, skirts or, uh, a dress and I have
a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time, but,
that's basically what I do.  

B.3:   Well, I think our tastes are fairly sim-, similar, although I
am I government worker, I do tend to, I'm, uh, a scientist.  

A.4:   Oh. 

B.5:   So that technically, I suppose, I could get away with, with
extremely casual clothes, but, for the most port, part I don't.  I
wear fairly respectable looking shoes and -- 

A.6:   Right.  

B.7:   -- and a pantsuit of one sort or another and, uh, I guess
dress it up with a, with a, a very nice black jacket when I have,
have visitors or have to give talks.  

A.8:   Well, that sounds nice.  

B.9:   Right.

A.10:   Uh, it said the seasons, do, do you change much through the
season or,   

B.11:   [Laughter] No, actually I guess this summer I, I wore some
fairly nice jeans -- 

A.12:   Uh-huh.  

B.13:   -- uh, more than I have in previous seasons.  But, uh, no, I
tend to, to use the same things because actually our offices are
very cold in summer.  I don't know whether they think by, you know,
freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during
the day or something.  

A.14:   Maybe.  

B.15:   [Laughter] But --

A.16:   [Laughter] No.  

B.17:   -- but, you know, you wear a [laughter] heavy sweater in your
office,  

A.18:   [Laughter]. 

B.19:   [Laughter] all summer.  So, right, uh, yeah, I don't, I
don't, I, you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some
of my friends.  

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of, of
secretaries was, you know, overdress, over kill, sort of -- 

A.22:   Yeah.  

B.23:   -- and -- 

A.24:   Yeah.  

B.25:   -- in a s-, in a sense, the people I know who spend the most
on clothes are secretaries.  Although the fact that most of the
ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the
public -- 

A.26:   Right.  

B.27:   -- it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities
would, would be to spend this money here [breathing].  You
know,   

A.28:   Uh-huh.  

B.29:   I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and
meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake --

A.30:   Then may-, {faint}.

B.31:   -- perhaps you would have to dress up.  

A.32:   Uh, well, I don't have the resources to just go out and buy,
buy, buy anyway [lipsmack] and so my don't change dramatically
over the years.  If I need something new, I will go and buy it. 
But, basically I'm a, a pretty much the same in the summertime I
wear the light cotton and in the wintertime I change to the
sweaters.  

B.33:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.34:   And, so, it's not a whole lot of, of change for me either.  
And, uh, especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses
I, I, I enjoy that, but it just wouldn't be, uh, smart for me to do
that in my home with my children.  

B.35:   Uh-huh.  

A.36:   So, I have to, uh, [lipsmack] think about things like that,
too.  I have given seminars before in, in creative writing and
things like that.  Now, I don't know if they consider that a job. 
I don't really get paid for that, uh, often, but, uh, when I do
that then I, I think I become more businesslike.  Uh, but it
doesn't really change my clothing style.  

B.37:   Exactly.  I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a pant-,
the same pant suit you would, you know -- 

A.38:   Yeah.  

B.39:   -- wear for other things.  Yeah, I'm, I'm really glad about
that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the
synthetics.  

A.40:   Oh. 

B.41:   And so I used to have a problem when, when I was working in a
restaurant while I was in college -- 

A.42:   Uh-huh.  

B.43:   -- and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would
just give me a terrible rash.  

A.44:   Oh, dear.  

B.45:   [Laughter] So,  

A.46:   That's not helpful.  

B.47:   Right, right.  But otherwise, now, I'm, I guess we're both
pretty practical [laughter].  

A.48:   Yeah, I guess so [laughter].  Well, it's been great talking to
you.   

B.49:   Okay.  

A.50:   #Have a great day.#  

B.51:   #Well, have a good day.# 

A.52:   Bye.  

B.53:   Bye-bye.
