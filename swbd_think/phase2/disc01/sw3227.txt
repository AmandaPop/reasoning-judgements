A.1:  Okay, well, um,

B.2:  What kind of music do you like?

A.3:  I, um, I was thinking about it for a long time, and I like basically almost
every form of music and type of music.  Um, I don't have a whole lot of
dislikes.  I, um, like jazz, um, especially the blues, and, uh, I like, uh, a
lot of the, uh, of course the classics, um, everything back from Bach and, and
Beethoven and Chopin and, um, just in general everything.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Um, I enjoy, uh, a lot of the, the modern forms, um, uh,

B.6:  Do you like, like rock and those kind of things --

A.7:  Right, right.

B.8:  -- punk even.

A.9:  Uh, well,

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  that gets, some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was,
uh, one of the big things, was punk music, and, uh, a lot of it is, has a lot
to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do, but
the, the actual,

B.12:  I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even [laughter].

A.13:  Uh, well, it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of
the people who enjoy the music --

B.14:  Yeah, I guess.

A.15:  -- um, but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of
art to it [laughter].

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Um.

B.18:  Do you like rap?

A.19:  Um, some of it, um, it depends.  I like, uh, the rap, the two types of rap
I like, or I enjoy to listen to, and one is the, the rap that is just funny,
um, and they usually do a lot of satire --

B.20:  Yeah --

A.21:  -- um.

B.22:  -- that kind I kind of like.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  Some of it is kind of --

A.25:  Right, the monotonous --

B.26:  -- pointless, yeah.

A.27:  -- the monotonous, no that's not, I don't enjoy that at all --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah,
blah, blah.  I don't like --

B.30:  Yeah, yeah.

A.31:  -- that.  I like the funny, satire, and then some of it is, some of it
actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- urban society.  It really does.  It talks about, um, race relations and
police relations and, um, that, that --

B.34:  -- I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once
in a while some of the funny --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- more satire kind some times.  Um, I'm, with you though, I like 
classical --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the
time, anyway.  I like easy listening, just kind of, you know, I guess I don't
care much for rock and roll any more.  I used to like it all right, but I
don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.  Um, let's see.
Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that.  Some of it's okay, uh --

A.39:  Yeah, that's, that's about my opinion of that [laughter].

B.40:  -- yeah [laughter].

A.41:  It's, it's okay, um, 

B.42:  Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess, so [laughter].

A.43:  Um.  The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem
to be any imagination behind it --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- the, one country and western song sounds like every other,

B.46:  a lot of them,

A.47:  country and western --

B.48:  sound, uh, really similar, yeah.

A.49:  -- and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music.
They just play a certain number of chords --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- the drummer plays a certain beat, and you have a country and western
song --

B.52:  Um.

A.53:  -- and,

B.54:  Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I
guess.  They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the
other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the
instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are --

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  -- you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- which probably is just as well on some [laughter] of them, too.

A.59:  [Laughter] Yeah.  And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the
very, very --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- modern, uh, rock and roll, but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the
fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies --

B.62:  Yeah --

A.63:  -- rock and roll --

B.64:  -- earlier things.

A.65:  -- and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ...
