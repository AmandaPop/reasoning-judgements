=========================================================================

A.1:  Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be
assigned to [laughter].

B.2:  No [laughter].

@A.3:  One that kind of comes up when you've lost it, the others, 
[laughter] other subjects.  Um, as I was sitting there, I
thought, the weather's been perfect.  I don't know much to say
about it.  It's, uh, it's, you know, for the balloon festival
here in Plano it was just gorgeous.

B.4:  I'm from Plano also.

A.5:  Are you?  It couldn't have been better.

B.6:  That's right.

A.7:  I mean, it didn't foul one launch, and that's kind of
unusual, and it's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up
warm, but by,

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  That's the only thing wrong I can find with it.

B.10:  I just got back from Dayton.  I spent the weekend in Ohio
with my family --

A.11:  Oh, how fun.

B.12:  -- and the trees are changing color there.

A.13:  I miss that, yeah.

B.14:  So, that, as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.  Of
course it wasn't sunny like it is here.  It was real gray --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw
all those trees, it just really made me realize how much I miss
the fall.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also
thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning, 

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  and the high was only fifty, and it was supposed to drop
and get sleet in the afternoon --

A.21:  Ooh.

B.22:  -- so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the
seventies.

A.23:  I guess you have to take some things and leave some things.

B.24:  That's right.

A.25:  Yeah, I'm from Utah area, and they, you know, they have tons
of canyons where the leaves change and they're gorgeous --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- you could spend every weekend of the [laughter] fall going
to a different area.

B.28:  We did that when we lived up in Michigan.  We went up to the
upper peninsula, and they actually printed out maps of routes you
could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure.

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  And then on leaf weekends it was, which is this time of the
year, it's bumper to bumper traffic, people as whoever was
driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves,
because they had to keep watching the road.

A.31:  Yeah, it's kind of hazardous for driving [laughter] --

B.32:  Yes.

A.33:  -- that's for sure.  But I can't complain.  I don't know if
I've been spoiled.  I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner
than normal.  We've only lived here a couple of years.

B.34:  I think it is, and my family said that in Ohio there was just
an article on, at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of
schedule --

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  -- as far as the coldness of the temperatures and, uh, the
first frost, everything just happened three weeks early this
year.

A.37:  We'll have to see how it goes, a couple of weeks ago we were
cooler than normal, but then we're back to being warmer than
normal this week, or last week, so.

B.38:  Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms --

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  -- in the spring.

A.41:  I don't have to live through many, any of those really, a
bad, I mean, nothing comparable, I guess, to what you've had
before.

B.42:  Well, I've only been here just a short time, too, so I
haven't been through -- 

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  -- any of those either, so.  I have in Michigan, but in
Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on.

A.45:  You're right.

B.46:  So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll
call off schools and, and close businesses.

A.47:  Well, they get ice, and no one can drive on ice.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  I mean, we used to think they were pansies, but then when you
decided what ice was [laughter].

B.50:  Right, the real definition of ice [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter] So, well, I think we've discussed it good enough
today.

B.52:  I think so.

A.53:  It was,

B.54:  It was nice talking with you.

A.55:  It was good talking to you.  Maybe we'll get the next time.

B.56:  Okay.

A.57:  Take care.

B.58:  Okay.

A.59:  Bye-bye.

B.60:  Bye.
