=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what kind of car would you, uh, buy next?  

B.2:  Well, that's a good question.  

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  We just got in from looking at cars, and we've probably been looking at
them for a couple months [laughter].

A.5:  Oh, you have?  Okay.  

B.6:  And we haven't bought one yet [laughter]. 

A.7:  Oh, and you haven't?  

B.8:  So that almost answers the question.  How about you?  

A.9:  Um, we just bought one.  

B.10:  Oh.  

A.11:  Um, we bought one about a month ago.  It was a ninety-one Ford Thunderbird.
Um, we really liked it because, um, we just moved here from South Dakota, and
we have, we do som-, quite a bit of traveling, and that was a nice car to
travel in.  But we have also a Ford Probe --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- and that one is better to get around town in --  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- because the Thunderbird takes a lot of gas.  

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  But, um, the reason we're stuck on Fords, I guess, is because I used to
sell Fords.  And so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a car but I really
like, um, that kind of car myself but,

B.18:  Well, we, we've been looking at [noise] just about everything I guess
because we really don't need a car we just sort of [laughter] want the luxury
of buying a new car.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  And, uh, I don't know we were, today we were looking at Lexuses, and we
keep going back to Cadillacs.

A.21:  Oh, do you?  

B.22:  And looking at those and then you don't know if you want to spend thirty
thousand dollars and buy a new car --

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  -- or whether you want to buy, uh, like a ninety-one Cadillac, a ninety or
ninety-one for, you know --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- twenty or nineteen or fifteen.  

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  You can get them fairly cheap compared to buying a --

A.29:  A Lexus.

B.30:  -- brand new one.  

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  [Lipsmack]  And the new Lexus that, that they have that you, you pay
sticker price for those.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  And isn't that neat though?  That is a neat car, don't you think?

B.34:  Yes, yes.  

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  We, we were, [laughter] we were all in them today --

A.37:  Were you?  

B.38:  -- but, you know, when it comes to, ((whoops)), you know, do you want to
spend about thirty thousand dollars --

A.39:  Right.  

B.40:  -- and, uh, it will probably be a little over that with the tax. 

A.41:  Oh, I know.  

B.42:  So that's, that's really where, where we are.  Or should we just buy, you
know, a little Volkswagen [laughter].  We,

A.43:  Yeah, [laughter] and get around town [laughter]. 

B.44:  [Laughter]  Right, we, you know, the, one of those Cabriolets I guess
they're called.  Uh, it's a convertible.  It's sort of like, you know, square
in the back.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  [Lipsmack] But --

A.47:  Yeah, I like those.  

B.48:  -- the, the selling point I guess that, that I, or it has to pass my test.
I'm, I'm short and I need to sit in the seat, see if I can get the seat high
enough to see over the steering wheel like I like to see.

A.49:  Are you shorter?  

B.50:  Yeah, I'm about five two.  

A.51:  Are you?  Oh, then that's, yeah.  

B.52:  And to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes
really over the shoulder and not up around your neck, so.

A.53:  It's got to be a comfortable car.

B.54:  Right.  Well, it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts
are going to work that way.

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  Nor can I get all the seats up high enough --

A.57:  Uh-huh.   

B.58:  -- to do that.  So, uh, so on those we just, we just forget about
[laughter],

A.59:  Yeah, that certainly helps.  

B.60:  And we've been looking at cars with other seats.  

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  But, uh,

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  [Lipsmack] I know this is a new experience for us [noise] just t-, mainly
because my, uh, my mother died which meant that we were coming into some money
that we could splurge and buy car [laughter] with.

A.65:  Oh, and isn't that nice.  

B.66:  But yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  So that's why [laughter] we're, we're out, uh, [lipsmack] sort of doing
this and, uh,

A.69:  Yeah, buying a car is hard.  

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  Because you never know for sure if you're getting a good deal. 

B.72:  Well, we've always bought used cars before, and they haven't been very
expensive.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  Um, so this is just, just a new, [noise] a new thing.  You know, we've had
vans.  We've had a new van and, you know, some other another new car --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- that, that wasn't used, but the prices are what you used to buy a house
for [lipsmack].

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  [Laughter]. 

A.79:  Oh, I know because we came down here, you know, and well, you know, from
((down here)) and it, but price of housing is a lot different.

B.80:  Uh-huh, I bet.  

A.81:  But the, but the price of our house up in Aberdeen was as much as some
cars.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  And it's like, you know, oh, my goodness [laughter].

B.84:  Right.  It's hard to adjust to it and, and you just don't want to really.

A.85:  No, because it's like this thing it moves and could be wrecked --

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- and that's like we, you know --

B.88:  That's ri-,

A.89:  -- could get a house for this.  

B.90:  Uh-huh.  

A.91:  And, uh, it just blows our mind.  Um, but, 

B.92:  Well, I hope you enjoy your car.   

A.93:  Oh, yeah.   

B.94:  Uh, we, we looked at Thunderbirds --

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- uh, I guess maybe about a couple weeks ago.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  We seem to do this every, [breathing] every weekend we've been out looking
for [laughter] for, we still haven't bought yet --

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  -- so I guess every, every month we don't buy we save more money than we
[laughter],

A.101:  That's right, interest [laughter].

B.102:  We're just shopping and shopping is free until you buy.  

A.103:  Yeah, well, that's great, you know, because you might as well get what you
want --

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  -- you know.  

B.106:  But it would, it would be nice.  Our son works for E D S and --

A.107:  Oh, really?  

B.108:  -- and we could use his, uh, discount that he gets through General Motors.

A.109:  Yes, that's right.  

B.110:  Except, uh, we were only [laughter] out looking at General Motors cars
except Cadillac and we're not looking at the, at the new ones anyway.

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  And in the Cadillacs and they're not using, they're not getting, uh,
discounts on the new [sniffing] Cadillacs that we're lookin-, wou-, would be
looking at to begin with, so.

A.113:  Uh-huh.  Are you in Dallas?  

B.114:  Yes, Plano.  

A.115:  Yeah, so am I [laughter]. 

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  Are you looking at the Crest or, 

B.118:  Yeah, we were just, got back from there.  

A.119:  You did?

B.120:  Yeah, that was our last stop, abo-, you know, about eight thirty.  I said
we can always swing around Crest so --

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  -- there we go and we're swinging around ((yes)).

A.123:  And we got our, I,

B.124:  We've gotten two cars, two used cars from Crest.  

A.125:  Oh, you, and good,
