========================================================================

B.1:   I'm ready.  Okay.  

A.2:   Do you have an opinion about civil stuff?  

@B.3:   Well, [breathing] you know, when, to me, when you're
talking about juries, there's, there's two types of juries.  You've
got the civil juries and then you've got the criminal -- 

A.4:   Right.  

B.5:   -- juries.  Now the criminal juries, my understanding of those
where a person has done some crime and you're trying to determine
that they need to go to jail or not.  

A.6:   Uh-huh.  

B.7:   And then if he does, for how long.  The civil jury is a matter
of, you owe me some money or you think that I owe you some money
and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask,
we're going to ask that jury to, uh -- 

A.8:   Yes.  

B.9:   -- make a decision as to who owes who and for how much.  I'm
sorry.  I have a problem with that.  

A.10:   Well, I do, too.  

B.11:   Because, first of all, [lipsmack] I'm a working person and
I need to get paid for my day of work.  And if the, our juries only
pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work.  I
think it's wrong that two people have a dispute and they had a
little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred
dollars or a thousand dollars, whatnot, and they're going to call
me away from work for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a
decision as to who owes who and how much.  

A.12:   Okay.  You're, 

B.13:   To me, that is what we pay our judges to do. 

A.14:   You're, you're self-employed, so you're not -- 

B.15:   I am self-employed, that's right. 

A.16:   -- reimbursed by anyone.  

B.17:   I'm not going to be reimbursed by no one.  

A.18:   Okay.  Uh, yeah, that's, that's an interesting point.  I, I,
I'm not an enthusiast for juries particularly, and I think
especially in, in civil cases I doubt, doubt the effectiveness of
it.  I hadn't thought about it from terms of the cost point of view
to providing the jury.  I think we may be the only major country
today that still uses juries in civil trials.  

B.19:   You know, that one I've never heard of, but that, you may be
right.  I was, I [laughter] I, you know, I've, I've never heard
that before.  

A.20:   I'm pretty sure Britain has, has, uh, given up juries in civil
cases.  

B.21:   But, I mean, i-, isn't that what we have the elected officials
who supposedly is unbiased who, can't, aren't they supposed to have
a head on their shoulders to make these decisions?  

A.22:   Well, probably judges would be the people, you mean the
decision about whether to use juries or decision,

B.23:   No, decision as to whether or not as far as civil is concerned.

A.24:   I, I, I think it would be better to have them, have judges
trained professionals deciding such things.  

B.25:   True.  

A.26:   Uh, I don't know there's any const-, way to do that other than
to change the Constitution.  

B.27:   [Breathing] You're probably right, but it, that's still my,
as far as I'm concerned, I just think it's wrong to use a jury for
the civil matters.  Now, you can talk about criminal matters, uh,
I've got no problem with that one, because you know, here you're
talking about, uh, has a person fit into society, has he followed
the rules of society.  I've, I've got no problem at all with using
your peers, quote, quote, and helping to make decisions.  Although
we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that, uh, jury. 
I think some of the, the [breathing] manipulative rules that they
use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury, but
all the poor or (( )) can be, you know.  It d-, it doesn't make
sense.  

A.28:   Uh, no, I don't ((th-,)), I guess different states have
different rules on that.  I, 

B.29:   Well, it, it would amount to, if you're, if you're rich, if
you got money and you're really high in society, somehow or another
you're going to come up with a, one of these excuses that the, the,
the judge is going to say, yeah, you're excused, you don't have to
be here.  But if you are some poor old, uh, blue collar worker who,
you know, uh, just trying to eke out a living and, and, uh, I work
from eight to five and, for some reason he's not going to find an
excuse to get out.  And so we typically find our juries made up of
some of the dumbest people -- 

A.30:   This is be-, -- 

B.31:   -- rather than smarter.  

A.32:   -- because of not who initially comes in, but who's selected
out of the panel?  

B.33:   Right.  

A.34:   Uh, okay, certainly both sides pick criteria by which they
want to, uh, judge jurors and,  

B.35:   [Sneezing]. 

A.36:   and, uh, veto lots of those and I suspect [breathing]
that, uh, well, see, likely get off that way, although it, it will
vary.  

B.37:   True.  

A.38:   Uh, I mean, I guess traditionally juries are supposed to do
findings of fact as opposed to findings of law and deciding,   

B.39:   But then they, but then they also have to make the decision
as to how long that person should serve.  

A.40:   Well, that, that varies by state and locality --  

B.41:   Okay.  

A.42:   -- as to whether the,  

B.43:   And there, most juries don't even know what the hell they even
talking about.  

A.44:   [Lipsmack] Uh, there's little basis for comparison.  

B.45:   And then when you get someone who says, okay, this person
should be convicted for thirty years, two years later they're on
probation because the jury doesn't know, and in the state of Texas,
I don't think are you allowed, uh, the jury's not allowed to be
told how soon that person would be off on probation.  Only thing
that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail,
not knowing what the rest of the rule is.  Which I think is unfair.

A.46:   Well, I guess I feel much more comfortable with, with
judges,
