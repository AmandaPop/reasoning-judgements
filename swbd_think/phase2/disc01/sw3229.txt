=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of
a couple of menus, so I decided it had to be in it, informal or
not.  You know --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- if it's informal I'd probably choose something, I mean,
just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year
where it's so nice out.

B.6:  Yes.

A.7:  Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a
chicken breast or lasagna or something.  I'm not [laughter] I'm
not into formal dinner parties, but --

B.8:  I see.

A.9:  -- I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic
bread.

B.10:  So what do you use for cookbooks?

A.11:  [Breathing] Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was
married, but, it's kind of the bible of cooking --

B.12:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.13:  -- for me.  Then I have some from like church that are more
family recipes that are more useful [laughter].  

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  You know, budget cookbooks, but --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did, of course I've
added several --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- different recipes, but, what you serve or what would you
[laughter], 

B.22:  Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds,
uh, so the,

A.23:  Well, that's good [laughter].

B.24:  I, I, I, so, it diff-, you know, have different perspectives
that you are.  I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably
useful book --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- to, to fall back on, because it has almost everything in
it.  But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh, it's a
good reference when you need to dig something up.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY
MINUTE COOKBOOK, I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs --

A.29:  Huh.

B.30:  -- uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared
in thirty minutes, you know, the whole meal --

A.31:  Yeah --

B.32:  -- and so she's --

A.33:  -- that would be wonderful in these times [laughter].

B.34:  -- yeah, now, now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food,
and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty
minutes. 

A.35:  Yeah, either they're really fast or [laughter],

B.36:  But they're, but they're, but they're interesting --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you
wouldn't have, nobody thought of.  

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Um.

A.41:  What's one of your favorites?

B.42:  Um, gee, the one I had most recently was, was one that, was,
ha-, she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, um, summer menu,
or something, and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes
that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and
probably some yogurt was in there.

A.45:  Wow, sounds too good.

B.46:  Uh, and that, and that was, you know, that's, that, that's
certain you can do in thirty minutes.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  But there are a whole lot of, you know, I mean, I, I would
recommend you look at that book --

A.49:  Yeah, that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.

B.50:  -- if you're a busy person.  THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.

A.51:  That sounds fun.  I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't
know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange
ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and I have young children, and our budget's set, you know,
at this time, but I want to use simple recipes that --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- I have things on hand, I don't have to run to the store to
buy or look for something I haven't heard of [laughter].

B.56:  Yes, yes.

A.57:  That's why sometimes I shy away from, uh, more of a
traditional cookbook --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:   -- but, [inhaling] well, it was interesting talking to you. 
It's a fun subject.  Food is one of my favorite things too.

B.60:  Yes.

A.61:  Anything else you wanted to add?

B.62:  Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know, what would I
put together for a formal dinner.  We, we had some friends over
as recently as Saturday night --

A.63:  Oh, wow.

B.64:  -- and, and, um, put, here, here the inspiration was a
combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate
mousse recipe --

A.65:  Uh-huh, that's good.

B.66:  -- and a sort of (( )) cookbook which has a recipe for a
thing called chicken marabella --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, um,
basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um,
having marinated it first and, my wife did this part so I don't
remember all the details --

A.69:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked
with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh, there's a little
bit of brown sugar in there, and it bakes up and it's a delicious
thing, and it's easy --

A.71:  That sounds good.

B.72:  -- comparatively.  So.

A.73:  That sounds really good.

B.74:  Um.  I'm sorry, I just love [laughter],

A.75:  [Laughter] It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet
than I am, I'm pretty simple right now, but.

B.76:  Well, maybe a little more leisure time --

A.77:  Yes --

B.78:  -- to do it.  I don't know,

A.79:  -- that's probably, that's true, I have little ones and we,
and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods --

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  -- right now.

B.82:  I found my kids were very frustrating when they were
little --

A.83:  [Laughter]  Yes.

B.84:  -- in terms of their tastes.  

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Well, there again, sometimes it was easy, they'd, you know,
canned ravioli was,

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  one of their favorites, and so it was easy to --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- open a can of ravioli.

A.91:  Spaghetti's a pretty [laughter] staple every other week or so 
[laughter] --

B.92:  Yes.

A.93:  -- and it goes a long ways too.  So.

B.94:  Well, nice talking to you Cheryl.

A.95:  All righty.

B.96:  Okay.

A.97:  Talk to you later maybe.

B.98:  Bye.
