=========================================================================

A.1:   Something that I guess some people abuse a lot.  They tend to
get, let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out
there on them.  We didn't, uh, get too much built up on it that we
didn't know it was out there, but, we used them through a period of
time that we needed to and then, uh, consolidated all of it and
brought it into a single controllable [noise], uh, line of credit
at our credit union and, uh, used that as a, when the interest rate
dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off.  Uh, 

B.2:   Which [throat_clearing], which now almost any source of money
is lower than a, a interest rate on a credit card.  

A.3:   Right.  Yeah it's, it's strange that, that I guess to draw new
customers I've seen a few banks in this area have, uh, oh, I guess
it was like thirteen point nine or so, or some of them were even
twelve nine.  I can't imagine how they made that up, made that
difference up unless they had a, quite a fee on it or some sort of
restrictions, or every transactions fees or something because that
was back when, you know, eighteen and nineteen and twenty-one was
prevalent.  

B.4:   Yeah, but if you think about it now with what, what, what
interest rates are doing, I mean they are so low and yet the
majority of the credit card companies still have [breathing],
you know, eighteen percent, some of them even higher.  

A.5:   Right.  

B.6:   And, uh, uh, you know, it, it's some of them are almost, uh,
usurious.  So,  

A.7:   The last card I got, in the last week I got an application for
one that was similar to the Discover, only it was a gold Visa that
offered one percent of y-, all your purchases back.  But they had
a, uh, a user's fee of like, oh, it was thirty-five or forty-five
dollars a year and there was, one of the other things they said was
so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee if you
use it at a, uh, a different teller than the ones that are at the
bank that issues it.  

B.8:   Right.  

A.9:   Which, of course, is an out of state one, so that would have
been kind of, all of mine would have been.  But, the credit union,
uh, that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside
their's, but that's, there's so many of theirs that it doesn't
matter.  I, I hardly, I never have that I know of.  

B.10:   Yeah, it's like my, uh, A T M card, [sniffing] [throat_clearing], 
if I use it at, at my bank which, uh, I bank at my office and it's 
down in the lobby, I've got a, these automatic teller machines -- 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- then it's very convenient.  I do probably ninety, ninety-five 
percent of my, uh, cash withdrawals there.  But, uh, as of my last, 
uh, uh, bank statement I had gotten some cash, uh, from another 
location and they charged me two dollars -- 

A.13:   Yep.  

B.14:   -- [Laughter] {faint} for that transaction which I thought,
gosh.  

A.15:   And if you happen to check your balance at the same time, it
would be two more dollars.  At least -- 

B.16:   Yeah.  

A.17:   -- that's, that's something, huh.  

B.18:   Yeah.  

A.19:   [Breathing] The, uh, [breathing] the way the Metroplex
is laid out, I drive by nine other sites before I get to the one I
work at and so there's, there's several opportunities to use the,
uh, card there and I happen to be less than a mile from one site
and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash.  Fact, it's
the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be
the one that, uh, I'm with, so that's nice to have those around. 
And I only drive ten miles to work, so [breathing] it's kind of
a, uh, one of those situations where they're, they're all around
me, as it were.  I just happen to be in the right straight line
between them.  

B.20:   Yeah, [throat_clearing] do you have, uh, do you ever use your
credit cards for cash?  

A.21:   I have done that once and I did it, uh, [breathing] gosh,
I forget why.  I, I guess I, I don't know whether I was trying to
consolidate something at that time, or, some reason I took out a
thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad.  It wasn't but, uh, one
percent or so.  It was one of the Mastercards I had.  

B.22:   Yeah, th-, well, that's, that's not a bad deal.  I t-, I had,
uh, a card one time that [breathing] when, you know, one of
these things without my asking, they, uh, [breathing] sent me a,
a package, you know, notifying me that I was such a value-, a
valued customer that they had, uh, uh, put forth this line of
credit for me.  

A.23:   Huh.  

B.24:   And, uh, [lipsmack], uh, you know, without reading the
small print I found out it was some pretty expensive money
[laughter] before it was all over with.  Because whenever you
accessed it through the card, uh, they tacked on a, a charge each
time.  Whereas, you know, I think I only used it [breathing] a
hundred or two hundred at the time, if I had gone ahead and gotten
a larger amount each time, it wouldn't have been, uh, quite so
expensive.  

A.25:   Yeah.  I guess that's the way they planned on doing it.  I
can't imagine what I, [breathing] it's been several years.  I
can't imagine what I did to, uh, I do seem to recall, uh, oh, I, I
know what it was.  There was something I needed to do, something I
needed to buy, either a, a, gosh, I don't know what it, I don't
think it was a thousand now that I think about it.  It must have
been less than that, but something I needed and all the other pla-,
places were closed.  It was after hours, as it were, and the, there
was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind
our housing development, uh, they were open,
