@A.1:  So do you have any recycling programs there?  

B.2:  Um, I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, we're a pretty small town and, uh, the closest thing we have are bins
like out in front of Wal-Mart --

A.5:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- that show, you know, plastics, paper -- 

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- liter bottles, et cetera, et cetera.  

A.9:  We've progressed a little bit farther than that.  

B.10:  [Lipsmack]  Yeah.  

A.11:  Um, actually they have, uh, parts of town, it may have even spread all over
the whole town, and, um, they will have these green bins --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- and it's just as standard as a, a regular trash can that they come by
and pick up and dump.

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  And, uh, just along with a trash can you have this, this green plastic bin,
and you put your bottles in it and paper and, uh, you know, all those things
that wh-, aluminum.  You know, anything that can be recycled you just put in
that bin.

B.16:  Oh.  

A.17:  And, uh, I guess you can al-, and a lot of the restaurants -- 

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  -- they just have, uh, places where you can throw away, especially beer
places, where you can throw away green bottles,

B.20:  Huh.  

A.21:  and then the brown bottles.  And, uh, oh, I don't know, I guess they're,
you know, clear bottles.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  So, um, you know a lot of people do have those separated.  And, of course,
they have the, um, dumpsters, uh, the, the igloos.

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  Uh, and they have those strateg-, strategically placed around the city.

B.26:  Oh.  

A.27:  And, uh, they're, they're actually going to extend it, I think, one of
these days maybe to apartment complexes and, uh,

B.28:  Oh, that would be good.  

A.29:  Yeah, things of that nature.  So, I guess when you live in a bigger city
it, it really becomes, uh,

B.30:  Yeah, see, 

A.31:  necessary.

B.32:  it's not anywhere near that.  Uh, we, you know, as far as our little
pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans.

A.33:  Oh, yeah.

B.34:  But that's as far as we go because I take them to a girl at work, and she
goes and cashes them in because, you know, I just --

A.35:  Uh-huh.   

B.36:  -- I can do that for her and -- 

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  -- and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do
it.

A.39:  Oh, really?  

B.40:  Yeah, 

A.41:  Huh.   

B.42:  see we don't have anything here in Belton.  It's, it's a pretty small
little town.

A.43:  Yeah, I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the
road and pick up beer cans.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  And, uh,

B.46:  So, you know, that's about all the, that we're doing here.  Uh, they're,
uh, getting a little bit more on, they need ((to a lot a)) more community
awareness of just what ((is it)) mean to recycle, and what can you recycle and
what you can't.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  Because, you know, not a lot of people do really know what, you know, what
it's for.

A.49:  Yeah, they're doing a real good job of, uh, separating it here.  And, of
course, there you know you have a specific place to put your paper.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  And, uh, they try to get you to go ahead and separate it, but they actually
have the door to door pickup.  Um, and it's, uh, I think it started out to be,
um, just kind of a test, a pilot project.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  And it went over so well that they just extended it.  And it's almost, uh,
I don't know if it's done by a private company or not.  It may be.  But, uh,
they just go around to each, uh, door and pick it up.

B.54:  Wow, that's excellent.  

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  That's good.  

A.57:  Let's see.  Oh, and every year, of course, the phone books -- 

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- um, they tell everybody across the city to, uh, put all their phone
books in, uh, the, uh, recycle bins.

B.60:  Oh.  

A.61:  Because, you know, phone books are pretty, well, for a bigger city they're
pretty thick.

B.62:  Yeah, ((they are)).  

A.63:  And sometimes you might have two or three.  

B.64:  Exactly.  

A.65:  So, uh, that's, that's a big savings right there in itself.

B.66:  Yeah, see ours just goes in the regular trash.  

A.67:  Yeah, 

B.68:  It just, 

A.69:  huh.  

B.70:  you know, there's not a whole lot.  And there are, you know, some places
that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  But usually it's, it, it hasn't caught on yet.  I'm hoping it will soon.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  Well, the thing about newspapers and paper, recycled paper is
actually very expensive.

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  So, when you see something that's on recycled paper, they've actually gone
to a lot of expense to do that.  It's, uh, they're not coming out ahead at
all.  It's, uh, it's really a cost.

B.76:  Huh.  I wasn't totally aware of that.  

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  So.  

A.79:  I mean it, it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost
incurred when you do recycle something.  Now, aluminum I don't know.  They may
be coming out ahead.  But I know,

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  for a fact that the paper, uh, on that end they're not, [laughter] you
know.  It's just good to recycle but it's, uh, not to their advantage.

B.82:  Yeah.

@@A.83:  And it costs less.  

B.84:  Huh.  Well, 

A.85:  I can't think of anything else.  

B.86:  I can't either.  

A.87:  [Laughter]  Okay.  

B.88:  Because we're, we're at a very, you know, beginning stages, so.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  We look forward to it to get better (( )).

A.91:  Well, I hope you all, um, uh, come along a little farther in the future.

B.92:  Yeah, me too.  

A.93:  It was nice talking to you.  

B.94:  You too.    

A.95:  #Bye-bye.#

B.96:  #Bye.#
