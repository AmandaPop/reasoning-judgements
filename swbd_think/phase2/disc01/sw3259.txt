========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, I'll just go with you first.  What kind of --

B.2:   Okay.  

A.3:   -- eating out do you enjoy?  

@B.4:  Well, I like dining out.  Of course, it means that I don't
have to cook.  

A.5:   Right [laughter].

B.6:   But, um, I'm a divorced woman.  I have one child --

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   -- and, you know, when, when we dine out we go to like medium
priced restaurants.  

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   I don't, I don't particularly, I think it's sort of a waste of
money to go real, to a real high priced restaurant.  

A.11:   Do you go like home cooking, like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind
of thing or --  

B.12:   [Lipsmack] Um, e-, n-,

A.13:   -- cafeteria?  

B.14:   Not really.  We go wh-, more for the, uh, Chinese --

A.15:   Me too [laughter].

B.16:   -- and Italian --

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   -- and stuff like that.  Mexican, stuff --

A.19:   Mexican, uh-huh.  

B.20:   -- that I can't cook [laughter].

A.21:   Uh, we do too.  We do the same.  

B.22:   Yeah.  

A.23:   What are your favorite places?  

B.24:   Um, well, I like Chinese food.

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   Um, there's a little place down on, what is that?  Coit Road,
um, ((Chinese Pavilion)) or something.  

A.27:   Uh-huh.  

B.28:   That is really good and I like it.  And, um, I do, I do like
Chinese buffets.  

A.29:   Oh, yeah.  Well, we go, we've gone to August Moon and we think
that was real good --

B.30:   Uh-huh.  

A.31:   -- but our favorite when you have a little more to spend, is to
go to Taiwan or May Dragon.  

B.32:   Uh-huh.  

A.33:   And those are excellent.  They're really a nice place you
could take someone to eat.  

B.34:   Right.  

A.35:   It's not the, the rinky Chinese decorations --

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- but it's a very elegant nice place to eat.  

B.38:   Uh-huh.  

A.39:   We go, very, very often we go out for fajitas.  That's my
husband has just gotten stuck.  

B.40:   Oh [laughter]. 

A.41:   And we go to On the Border.  

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   And lots of places that have, uh, I think (( )) and some of
those and get fajitas, and he'll just eat chips until we've got
three or four baskets coming back.  

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   And then, uh, last weekend we went out for Italian also, and
for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat
lasagna and garlic bread [laughter].

B.46:   Right, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.47:   So, we went to El Sorrento.

B.48:   Ha-, yeah, have you ever, um --

A.49:   It was fun.  

B.50:   -- tried Pappasito's?

A.51:   You know, what?  This is, that's real funny you said that
because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob
pointed to it and he said, "I keep hearing good things about that
place, we're going to have to go."  

B.52:   Oh, it is delicious.  

A.53:   That's what he, tha-, in fact, you're about the third or
fourth person in the last month that said that.  

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   So I guess we'll have to do it.  

B.56:   It's, you always stand in line when you go --

A.57:   That's what it, that's what --

B.58:   -- but it's worth the wait.  

A.59:   -- D MAGAZINE said that.  It said there was always a line.  

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   But that's probably, I mean that's a good, that's a good sign. 

B.62:   Uh-huh.  And have you ever tried, um, the Macaroni Grill up 
on, 

A.63:   Yes, we did.  Now, my kids didn't like it because they just
wanted to get plain old spaghetti -- 

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   -- [Throat_clearing] or lasagna, and most of those things were
a little more northern Italy.  

B.66:   Right.  

A.67:   And they like just the traditional.  They're not very, 

B.68:   Tha-, th-, they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type.  

A.69:   Yes, they are.  

B.70:   [Laughter].   

A.71:   Exactly [laughter].  Exactly.   

B.72:   [Laughter] Right.  

A.73:   The place of the seventies [laughter]. 

B.74:   Yeah, yeah, but my little girl likes, uh, Spaghetti Warehouse --

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   -- real well [laughter].

A.77:   Yeah, most kids do.  

B.78:   It's real entertaining for her.  

A.79:   W-, do you ever go for steak?  Just a steak and potato and
salad bar, that kind of thing.

B.80:   Um, not really.  That's, a steak is something that I cook at
home.  

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   You know, tha-, that you grill out --

A.83:   Yeah.  

B.84:   -- and I really don't particularly, um, 

A.85:   Well, I'm, I'm real curious to try this one that has such 
(( )) commercials.  The uh, that Del Lincoln and, oh, what is that
guy's name?  They do those real corny commercials.  

B.86:   Huh.  

A.87:   It's, uh, over, there's one over there in Addison.  I can't
remember his name.  Anyhow it's some,

B.88:   Steak.   

A.89:   Yeah, it's some famous steak place over in Addison.  There's
a, there's a second one downtown, and they have these really corny
radio commercials -- 

B.90:   Uh-huh.  

A.91:   -- but the-, but they're steak is supposed to be wonderful.  So,
I ha-, I had not tried that.  My husband was saying that up north
they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or
after the movie.  

B.92:   Uh-huh.  

A.93:   And it seems like I've been, w-, we found those one time and
then they discontinued.  It was over in Addison.  

B.94:   Huh.  

A.95:   And then they, uh, closed up [throat_clearing].

B.96:   Yes.  

A.97:   So most of these places are pretty much just, uh, theme
restaurants --

B.98:   Right.  I think that's what --

A.99:   -- around here.

B.100:   -- goes, you know, really goes right now in the, in the Dallas
area.  

A.101:   Uh-huh.  

B.102:   Of course, you know, down, next to downtown up around McKinney
and everything --

A.103:   Uh-huh.  

B.104:   -- you know, there's just a, there's a different class -- 

A.105:   Well, that's exactly true [laughter].

B.106:   -- of restaurants up there -- 

A.107:   That's right.  

B.108:   -- that I can't even touch.  

A.109:   That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  

B.110:   You know, it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go
in and --

A.111:   That's e-, [laughter] yeah, that's right.

B.112:   -- [Laughter] have one meal --

A.113:   Uh-huh.

B.114:   -- up there but, um,

A.115:   I had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown --

B.116:   Uh-huh.  

A.117:   -- for prime rib and I haven't been.  We usually don't go for
beef really anymore.  

B.118:   Uh-huh.  

A.119:   Where, we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at
home that that's, that's usually the way we'll go --

B.120:   Right.  Uh-huh.

A.121:   -- if we're not going lasagna.  

B.122:   Yeah, when, when I go out, it's, it's normally to get, um,
some specialty type of food --

A.123:   Uh-huh.  

B.124:   -- besides, you know, because y-, chicken and --

A.125:   Uh-huh.  

B.126:   -- steaks and everything I grill at home.  

A.127:   I know.  Well, I understand.  

B.128:   And, and really it's, they're a lot better than what I get in
the restaurant [laughter]. 

A.129:   [Laughter] That's right, and save you some money too [laughter].

B.130:   That's right.  

A.131:   Well --

B.132:   Saves you a little bit money.  

A.133:   -- now what is your, what's your child's favorite place to eat? 

B.134:   Um, favorite place, uh, she has a lot, Taco Bell [laughter]. 

A.135:   Oh, yeah [laughter]. 

B.136:   [Laughter]. 

A.137:   They're easy [laughter].

B.138:   Yeah, that's right.  

A.139:   Yeah [laughter].

B.140:   That's right.  

A.141:   Well, mine enjoy that too.  They like to go pretty much where
we like to go and they'll --

B.142:   Uh-huh.  

A.143:   -- and then our favorite thing on Fridays, we generally order
pizza in so -- 

B.144:   Right.  

A.145:   -- not Pizza Inn, but pizza to our house.  

@@B.146:  Right, uh-huh.  

A.147:   So ((we've)) done.  Well, um, is there anything else you'd like 
to discuss about it?  

B.148:   No, not that I know of.  

A.149:   I think we've, I think it's come to an ((eye)) conclusion so
I'll talk with you later.  Thank you.  

B.150:   Uh-huh, thank you.  

A.151:   #Bye-bye.#  

B.152:   #Bye-bye.#
