REMARKS:        Speaker B was breathing heavily.

===========================================================================
 
A.1:  Okay.  Um, I don't know if you want to start first.

B.2:  You can start.  

@A.3:  Okay.  Basically, um, we're not in the city, we're out in the country.
And, uh, we were living in the city and I think, uh, crime has escalated quite
a bit.  Just from the, uh, short time we were in the city their crime and
murders alone, this is in, uh, the city of Minneapolis.  And that's quite a
ways from, uh, you know, uh, other cities like New York and, uh, Detroit and
all of that but,

B.4:  Sure.

A.5:  just in particular crime has escalated quite a bit in murders, I mean,
with guns and teenagers.  Not so much, um, with people that are in their later
twenties or thirties or whatever.  It's basically people that are, uh,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, nineteen years old killing each other,
um, and there's like,

B.6:  [Breathing].

A.7:  one a day.  So, that kind of gets to the point that you, uh, from the
years before it wasn't quite as much, so.

B.8:  So, I think it's more than that actually.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  I think, uh, I, I, it's funny you mentioned New York (( )), 

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  because that's where I live -- 

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- uh, in New York City.  Um, I think they had two thousand murders last
year.

A.15:  Oh, wow.  

B.16:  So that's like, uh, six a day.  

A.17:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely for you guys.  Sure.  And like I said in Minneapolis
it was basically, uh, one a day.  Every night you were hearing about a murder
whether it was, uh, between gang related murders or, uh, somebody in the wrong
spot at the wrong time.  That kind of thing.  And, uh, teenagers killing each
other or random shootings just basically shooting a gun into somebody's house
as they drive by or shooting somebody on the street just because they didn't
even know them.  But I think what's happening is, um, at least in Minneapolis,
uh, the, I think that people are getting fed up with it, and just this morning
was, uh, reading, uh, or watching a T V program on women carrying guns to
protect themselves against, uh, crime.  And I'm all for it.  I mean, when it
comes to somebody is going to do crime against me, they're going to, uh, you
know.  If, if I have a gun, I'll shoot them.  I won't even think twice about
it just simply because my safety comes first and that person that's, uh, doing
something against me would, uh, get shot.  But I'm an old country girl that,

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  a long time ago learned how to shoot a gun and I'm not afraid of a gun.
And I gues-,

B.20:  It's a little different in the city sometimes.  You know that's,

A.21:  Yeah, it's hard like with, uh, in our home we have a gun in the home but I
don't go out and carry it around with me in my purse.  But it comes down to I
think a lot of New York women do.  From what I've been hearing is that New
York and, uh, other cities that have such a high crime rate in the subways and
that are starting to carry guns, so.

B.22:  I mean that, yes.  It's a problem ((though anywhere that, you know, it's
at)) (( )) I, I mean that guy a few years ago that shot someone in the 
subway --

A.23:  Sure.

B.24:  -- could have hit someone that was just sitting there.  

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Sure.

B.26:  You know h-,

A.27:  Well, he did it,

B.28:  that, that's the problem with guns in, in New York and, 

A.29:  out of a ((pure)) and vengeance and I think, 

B.30:  Sure.  

A.31:  he murdered just purely because of his, but if you're, uh, up against a
gang of boys or teenagers,

B.32:  Well, that's, that's what happened with him.

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  But then he ended up shooting the guy in the back.  

A.35:  Right, exactly.  

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  If he had shot them and, uh, shot them or wounded them or even shot just
basically straight clear on onto their face or whatever, if he felt that he
was, uh, that much of a victim, I think, uh, the court system would have
looked at it a little bit differently.  But he bluntly just shot them even
after they were s-, I think, down on the ground,

B.38:  Sure, yeah.  

A.39:  not moving.  Uh, or whatever.  But, uh, I think there's a justification
of where people say, um, most of the people are fed up with crime so when
you're going to get juries, you're going to get juries of people saying, well,
you know, this guy asked for it.  Or this person asked for it or whatever.
And I think you're going to find less and less juries, uh, saying, well, the,
the victim should be put on trial for it.  Um, uh, when there's a crime being
produced you've got people like Jeff ((Dollmeyer)) that was [laughter],

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  bringing people into his apartment and killing them.  Uh,

B.42:  That's right.  That was in Minneapolis, wasn't it?  

A.43:  No.  No, that was, 

B.44:  Oh.  

A.45:  in, uh, Wisconsin.  

B.46:  Oh.

A.47:  That was in Milwaukee, 

B.48:  Milwaukee.  

A.49:  area.  

B.50:  Okay.  

A.51:  Yeah.  So, you know, you've got things like that if maybe those guys would
have carried a gun, they could have shot him right then and there before he,
[laughter] the guy, um, got them.  But i-, it's just the idea that I think
people are,

B.52:  [Breathing]. 

A.53:  more aware of crime, so.  I don't know.  

B.54:  Sure.

A.55:  I think people, I don't know what's going to happen in the future either.
People are going to be going back to the old west and carrying a gun,

B.56:  [Breathing]. 

A.57:  ((slinged)) [laughter] you know, on their hip or hidden or whatever but,
uh, unless something happens.  Maybe laws change, maybe some of these people
that have had two, three crimes against them never released from prison, um,
then you've got to pay for them in prison though, so.  I don't know.

B.58:  Sure.  It's, um, it's, it's weird.  See it, crime is a, a weird thing (( ))
as far as like the people that perceive it as a problem,

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  and the actuality of it because, 

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  like I live in New York City, 

A.63:  Uh-huh.   

B.64:  and,
