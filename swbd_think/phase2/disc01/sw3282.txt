of B or else B was doing something in the background.  It was hard
to distinguish what it was.

=====================================================================

A.1:   All right,  ((Carolyn,  When do)) you, are you reading the
papers about the, the Middle East summit?  

B.2:   Uh, some.  

A.3:   Yes.  I'm just a little bit too.  I think, um, I think I was
worn o-, worn out from Middle East after the war.  

B.4:   Yeah.  I think it kind of, uh, it didn't really take over the
first page quite as much as it did I think during the war.  

A.5:   Uh-huh.  

B.6:   But, um, we definitely need something there with all the
hostages and --

A.7:   [Lipsmack] Yeah, yeah.  Wha-,

B.8:   -- what all.  

A.9:   That's I think, uh, I don't know in the short run it would be
really nice to get the hostages all back.  

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   I think that's really, uh, really important.  I, I, 

B.12:   [Noise]. 

A.13:   I, I guess we grew up in such a different world I could never
even imagine taking hostages.  

B.14:   Yeah.  

A.15:   But I think they just have a whole different world than we do
so, [lipsmack] I don't know.  But I don't know what do you think
some of the long term repercussions might be?  

B.16:   [Lipsmack]  Oh, [noise] well, you know, I just see this
Middle East situation with, with Russia and everything there that's
happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down, and I
see the Middle East as being, you know -- 

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   -- the real [noise] hot spot of the future so to speak.  

A.19:   Yeah.  

B.20:   So, I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as --

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   -- trying to negotiate, trying to wind down some of the tensions
and everything that are there.  

A.23:   Yeah, I think, um, I don't know I have, uh, I just have this,
this civil rights mentality I, I guess.  You know should we or, or
you know, sho-, should we, uh, those, I wish those countries could
have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do.  

B.24:   Uh-huh.  

A.25:   I guess that's what I, I hope for them.  But some of them
don't want those freedoms I think.  Their, their religious beliefs
may, um, may not, you know, they may not want it as a whole so I
think that's something that has to be considered too.  

B.26:   Yeah.  

A.27:   But I think that's a, that's really a long term type thing. 
I know that the, the, it said think about long term repercussions
and I was just thinking, well, peace is peace --

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   -- you know, and that really is the nicest thing.  

B.30:   I guess the question in my mind somewhat and, and it depends
on the country, you know, I think some are more peaceful than
others.  

A.31:   Uh-huh, yeah. 

B.32:   If you look at, um, Iraq for example --

A.33:   Yeah.

B.34:   -- and you know the recent thing with the U N going in there --

A.35:   Uh-huh.

B.36:   -- and the, the bomb development and all this kind of stuff, you
know.  Gosh.  I think, you know, we should have got him while we
[laughter] could --

A.37:   [Laughter] Yeah.  Yeah.  

B.38:   -- or whatever.  

A.39:   I, I think so.  I think, um,

B.40:   And I think there's a certain mentality --

A.41:   And,

B.42:   -- to that that's in the Middle East, you know, the, the constant
fighting, you know and, 

A.43:   Right.  I think, I think they realized we would probably never
push him out and, uh, I think the other, probably all of the other
Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him
out.  

B.44:   Yeah, I think they, they look at force as a way of --

A.45:   Uh-huh.  

B.46:   -- you know, their, their means to their ends.  

A.47:   Yeah, yep.  

B.48:   And, uh, so I, you know, I don't know so much if these peace
talks are going to, I don't know how much they'll stay to them.  

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   You know, if, if we, even if we say that we're going to do
stuff, I don't know how they'll stick to that [noise].

A.51:   Yeah.  I, I think the, the thing is though I, I guess the, the
Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any i-,
ideas that, that coincide with the, the U S ideas or whatever used
to probably receive money from the Soviet Union.  

B.52:   Uh-huh.  

A.53:   And I guess that's all gone.  I think that's really, uh,
probably what started the whole process.  

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   [Laughter]  I,

B.56:   Well, that's probably a bonus on our part.  

A.57:   Yeah.  

B.58:   Yes, it is.  

A.59:   I think, I think that they're s-, they're so much more
vulnerable now because they don't receive support --

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- from the Soviet Union so I guess they're saying, well, you
know, we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these
countries two ways.  We can either act like we're going to be
pro-communist or act like we're going to be pro, uh, pro-democracy
and whatever gets us the most ((honor)) that's what we'll act like
we're going to do, but we really won't change in the long run.  

B.62:   Yeah.  

A.63:   I think that's the way I sort of see them all working, you
know.

B.64:   I tend to agree with you.  

A.65:   Yeah.  

B.66:   You know, I think they have in mind what they want to do and
I think a lot of times their (( )) ((might make right)).  

A.67:   Uh-huh.  

B.68:   And, you know it, kind of the forceful, you know, I don't
know.  But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds
[laughter].

A.69:   Yeah.  It's, it's really funny as an American and always being
an ally with the Israelis.  I always find it very hard in my heart
to a-, to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as
bad as the Arabs, [lipsmack] you know.

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   But then again they have to live in that environment.  They
have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings,

B.72:   [Noise].

A.73:   and terrorist attacks and whatever.  

B.74:   Yeah.  

A.75:   Then they have to negotiate almost everything and then you
think to yourself, well, you know in your heart you don't want to
be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else, but
if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in,
then you have to sort of like, I don't know, logically,
