=========================================================================

A.1:  This is an eas-, easy subject.  I, I guess I watch too much T V but
[laughter],

B.2:  Yeah, I watch a lot of television myself here, lately.  I'm out of a job
right now, so {pause} [breathing], I watch a lot of, lot of JEOPARDY and
cartoons [laughter].

A.3:  Do you?  Afternoon shows, mainly, then?  

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  Yeah, my kids love to watch cartoons and I have to come in the other
bedroom to watch JEOPARDY and [laughter], and, but, what are some of your
favorite sitcoms or whatever, at night?

B.6:  Uh, I like, uh, the FRESH PRINCE OF BELLAIRE.  

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  And --

A.9:  Pretty good.

B.10:  -- uh, generally the, the channel eight stuff that comes on, DOOGIE HOWSER,
ROSEANNE, and --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- stuff like that.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  You don't have a real favorite or,   

B.14:  A real favorite.  

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  {Pause} Probably FRESH PRINCE or MARRIED WITH CHILDREN [laughter].

A.17:  They're your favorites, huh.  They're pretty good.  Oh, it surprises me
that yours aren't the same as mine, and I thought I formed mine, kind of with
my husband, so [laughter].  We've been MCGYVER fans forever.  I don't know if
you ever watch that.

B.18:  [Yawning].

A.19:  It's on Monday night.  

B.20:  Uh,  

A.21:  We --

B.22:  Excuse me.  

A.23:  -- we enjoy it mainly because it, I think it has, it's full of adventure
[laughter] and stuff like that.

B.24:  Yeah, I, I watch that when I can.  Usually I, I go out right around then,
so I'm not home then.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And [throat_clearing] we used to like COSBY real well, but it, it's kind of
slacked off a little bit.

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  It's not one of our, MURPHY BROWN always is good for several laughs.

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  [Laughter] We like that.  We watch DOOGIE quite often, too
[throat_clearing].  But, the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch
with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty bad [laughter], too, so
[breathing],

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  But, uh, we, we watch, and L A LAW is another one we probably watch
if we can.

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  And QUANTUM LEAP.  We have our, our favorites, of course.  I don't know
what channel they're all on.  Probably different ones.  That's kind of fun to
watch, too [throat_clearing].  Are you watching the WORLD SERIES right now, 

B.36:  [Cough]. 

A.37:  too or,

B.38:  Uh, yes, I am, actually.  I, it's the first year I've really been
interest-, interested in baseball, but I just decided to pay attention here to
the, the WORLD SERIES.

A.39:  I have a brother that lives in Minnesota so this kind of has been fun to
watch.  They tried to get, get tickets, but, man, the scalpers that were out
[breathing] --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket.  

B.42:  That's, getting tickets for something like that, it's like trying to, 

A.43:  [Laughter]. 

B.44:  [Breathing] I don't know, enter Fort Knox [laughter].

A.45:  Yeah [laughter].  I just read in today's paper where the DYNASTY sequel,
uh, out rated the WORLD SERIES.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  That surprised me.  I didn't think,

B.48:  That's kind of strange.  

A.49:  I didn't care to watch that DYNASTY [laughter] at all.  

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  I guess it depends on if you're a DYNASTY fan or not.  

B.52:  And, and now DYNASTY is on tonight and the WORLD SERIES is back on again
tonight.

A.53:  It will be interesting to see how many keep with it.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  See if it was really that good [laughter] or not but,   

B.56:  I think what it is, is everybody [yawning],

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  [Noise] {whining} excuse me, everybody was looking to see the, the 
fight --

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  -- between the, the two women.  

A.61:  Yeah, they look, that, that's pretty good [throat_clearing]. 

B.62:  That's, a, a friend of mine was taping it just so he could see this one
fight.

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  And he taped the wrong day, because it wasn't on the first day.

A.65:  Oh, gee [laughter].  Oh, well.  

B.66:  [Breathing]  So now he's got to tape, tape it again today when it comes,
comes back on.

A.67:  I think I'll stick with the WORLD SERIES.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  [Laughter] Let them fight it out, I don't,    

B.70:  I, I never was much of a DYNASTY fan.  

A.71:  No, I, I watched DALLAS when it first came on and then I lost interest in
it, too.

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  And DYNASTY, I just never did get into, so [laughter], but, well, I think
that's all we need to discuss.  We [breathing] have a few similar, not too
many, and --

B.74:  Okay.  

A.75:  -- I'll have to watch one of yours and see if I like it [laughter] so, 

B.76:  Okay.  

A.77:  All right, it was good talking to you.  

B.78:  Thank you.  

A.79:  Bye-bye.  

B.80:  Bye.
