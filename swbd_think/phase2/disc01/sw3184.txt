=========================================================================

A.1:   Well, basically, uh, did you want to go first, then?  

B.2:   Uh, well, I can.  I, I don't own my home.  

A.3:   Okay, right.  

B.4:   Uh, [laughter] I mean I, I live in a nice area and I rent my
home and -- 

A.5:   Uh-huh.  

B.6:   -- uh, we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because
we don't know if we're going to be staying here.  

A.7:   Sure, uh-huh.  

B.8:   In, uh, Texas, so,  

A.9:   Yeah.  I think as far as, like, our home, it's, uh, in a small
residential area.  We're out of the cities quite a ways, so it's
kind of more of a country setting and, uh, [baby_crying] it's just
a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home.  It's, it's nothing, you
know, [baby_crying] elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or,
you know.  It's, it's --

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   -- just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story
type home.  Uh, and I think as far as if it's, for put it into
standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be
just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes
are.  Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate
homes and yet there's, where we can view the river from that
distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know,
pretty typical of what our home is, so -- 

B.12:   Uh-huh 

A.13:   -- it's, uh, pretty much that, uh, type of, uh, home so,

B.14:   Yeah.  Well, our ho-, -- 

A.15:   Uh,  

B.16:   -- our house, we, we're renting it from an individual who
bought it and he lives in Korea.  

A.17:   Uh-huh, oh, really?  

B.18:   And, uh, [baby_crying] he's recently moved here and he's owns
eight or nine properties -- 

A.19:   Sure.  

B.20:   -- uh, near here -- 

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   -- and, uh, so,  

A.23:   Yeah.  

B.24:   But the houses around here, there's five, five houses on my
street for sale right now.  

A.25:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  

B.26:   Which is just, uh, in trouble -- 

A.27:   Yeah.  

B.28:   -- [Breathing] to me.  And they're not very expensive
either.  It just seems like, we have a three bedroom house.  Ours
is one level only.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   Uh, but we,  

A.31:   So it's the rambler style.  

B.32:   Yeah, we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a
big kitchen and,

A.33:   Uh-huh.  

B.34:   The bedrooms are a little bit small except the master
bedroom's a little bigger.  

A.35:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.36:   So,  

A.37:   It's kind of like what ours is.  Uh, one of our bedrooms is
really small and we've made that into a den because we only have
one child, so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small
bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller.  It
seems like they get incredibly small [laughter].  

B.38:   Yeah.  

A.39:   Uh, but, uh, anyway, but, [lipsmack] okay.  So that sounds
great, and, uh, I don't know if we need to talk any more or
whatever.  

@@B.40:  Have you d-, have you done this before?  

A.41:   The T I?  

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   Uh, yes, uh, about three times before.  

B.44:   Oh, have you?  

A.45:   I'm fairly new to it, but [breathing] it seems to be going
okay.  

B.46:   Yeah.  Are you in Texas?  

A.47:   No, huh-uh.  

B.48:   No, yeah,  

A.49:   No, I'm out of state.  I'm in Wisconsin, so,  

B.50:   Oh, really?  

A.51:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.52:   Oh. 

A.53:   So it's,  

B.54:   Sounds interesting.  

A.55:   [Breathing] Uh, other than that, sure, yeah.  Is this your
first time?  

B.56:   No, huh-uh.  I've, well, I've gotten several calls.  

A.57:   Uh-huh.  

B.58:   Uh, but, uh,  

A.59:   I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of
like it because it's like I can get it done with [laughter].  

B.60:   Yeah.  

A.61:   I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I
have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of
calls, you know, so, sooner or later.  

B.62:   Yeah, yeah, well, they've, I've talked to some people from
Cleveland and I did talk to someone --

A.63:   Uh-, 

B.64:   -- else who lives here --  

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   -- in the same city I do, so -- 

A.67:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.68:   -- that was kind of interesting [laughter].  

A.69:   Yeah, sure.  

B.70:   They're, they're sure getting their people out, so, well -- 

A.71:   Yeah.  

B.72:   -- it was nice to talk to you, anyway and,    

A.73:   Okay, well, you take it easy, Gail.  

B.74:   Okay, thanks.  

A.75:   Bye, now.  

B.76:   Bye-bye.
