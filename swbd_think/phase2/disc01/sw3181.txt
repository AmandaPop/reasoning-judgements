==========================================================================


A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  All right, well, I'm not a big exerciser, but I kind of had to start after
I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.  

A.5:  I am, too.  

B.6:  Are you?  

A.7:  Yes.  

B.8:  I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where
they kind of move their hips, you know, and --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- keep their arms up.  I don't do that.  I mostly just take a, a walk
around the block or with my baby or, you know, and I have to do that at least
once a day.  If it,

A.11:  Oh, that's good.  

B.12:  If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did
before.  I can't neglect that because of the baby either.

A.13:  And how old is your baby?  

B.14:  She just, uh, well, she was premature, so she's about nine months now,
though.  Goll-, times goes fast.

A.15:  Yes. 

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.  

B.18:  Oh, that's great.  

A.19:  My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- and he lost sixty-two pounds --

B.22:  [Breathing].

A.23:  -- and I lost twenty-one.  

B.24:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.25:  [Lipsmack].  So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this
exercise walking program and we walk our dog every night --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- and go up around the elementary school.  We have a little path that we
do.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold -- 

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- which it hasn't been --

B.32:  Exactly.

A.33:  -- we try to get out, uh, every, every night.  

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  And he plays racquetball twice a week, but I'm not into that, so --

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  -- I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.

B.38:  Well, I think that is just wonderful.  Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have
several other children and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to
other things, it's kind of a task.

A.39:  Yes.  

B.40:  You know.  Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go,
oh, this is wonderful, let's go [laughter].

A.41:  Right [laughter], that's right.  I know my kids are into sports and a lot
of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine
thirty so we will just go out after that.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I
go out and walk.

B.44:  Yeah.  Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?  

A.45:  Yes.  

B.46:  Oh, see, now that's really nice.  

A.47:  Yes.  

B.48:  Because mine's at meetings sometimes and, and he's not really into it so --

A.49:  No -- 

B.50:  -- I have to,  

A.51:  -- my husband never was either until he lost the weight.  

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  That was his decision.  He had arthritis in his hips and his doctor said he
needed to lose weight and exercise.

B.54:  I think that is so wonderful.  

A.55:  So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.  And our dog
has lost a little weight.  He walks every night, too [laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking
shoes.

B.58:  I bet.  I think that's really, really good.  And, and, you know, I think
this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be
a routine.

A.59:  Yes.  

B.60:  It's not, like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest
thing was --

A.61:  Making time for it.  

B.62:  -- to get ready and get out there.  But now if I haven't done it in a day
or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a 
[laughter] ...

A.63:  Yes.

B.64:  You know.  And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me
and sometimes they don't.  And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know,
how fun it can be when they come.  So, uh, I like to have somebody come with
me.

A.65:  I know, I do, too.  

B.66:  Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I
could go to a home --

A.67:  Right.  

B.68:  -- around this block area.  So it, it's not real dangerous, but still, I
don't like to go alone.

A.69:  No.

B.70:  So {faint}.

A.71:  I never do either.  Even if I have my dog with me.  

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  You know, it's nice to have another person there, but ...  

B.74:  Yeah.  You know,  

A.75:  Mostly, it's my husband and sometimes it's my kids.  

B.76:  Well, I think that's great.  I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids
to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do.  I
was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type
thing.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me.  

A.79:  Me, too.  I did the dance step when I lived up in --

B.80:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.81:  -- Michigan and it just wore me out.  I would leave totally exhausted.  I
never lost any weight, and I got to the point I dreaded going in.

B.82:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.83:  So walking seems to be a good solution for me and it doesn't cost anything
[laughter].

B.84:  Right [laughter], right.  And it gives me time to think.  So I think, not
only does it help my body, but I think it helps my mind --

A.85:  Yes.

B.86:  -- too.  So I like that.  

A.87:  That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk --

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  -- without having the kids jump in and ...  

B.90:  Yeah, need something and,  

A.91:  Yep.  

B.92:  They can wait until you get back home.   

A.93:  Yep.  

B.94:  Well, I think that's great [lipsmack].  Well, that's what I do for
[laughter],

A.95:  Yep, that's all I do, too.  

B.96:  Okay.  

A.97:  Okay.
