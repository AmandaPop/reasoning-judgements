=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so you're into microwave cooking.

B.2:  Yeah, it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know, and it's,
uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop
something into the microwave and it be ready in just a few
minutes [laughter].

A.3:  (( )), yes, and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,
something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the
weekends so that I have leftovers all week.

B.6:  All week.  Well, we've done that, too.  There's just my
husband and I, and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot o-, uh, pot
of spaghetti --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half, and
I kind of get sick of it after he (( )) [laughter].

A.9:  I know.  I try not to make too much.  It's just my husband
and I, too --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that
week [laughter] --

B.12:  Yeah [laughter].

A.13:  -- but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or
soup or chili or, you know, something like that --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- or sometimes a roast, but,

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner
party?

B.18:  Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken
enchiladas --

A.19:  Oh, oh.

B.20:  -- it's, it's really good, I got it from a friend of mine
that I used to work with --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves
it.

A.23:  Ooh, that sounds delicious.

B.24:  So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  What about you?

A.27:  We-, I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian
chicken, because it's so easy --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and, uh, it go-, you have to cook very little to go with
it, just some rice and some salad and that's about it, you know.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  Well, what do you put in it?

A.31:  Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts and
then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian
dressing, one bottle of that --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and three ounces of apricot preserves --

B.36:  Ooh, that sounds good.

A.37:  -- and you mix it up, and you just put it on the top of the
chicken, and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the
oven for about an hour --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and then I take the foil off and let it brown --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- takes about another twenty minutes --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and it's delicious --

B.44:  Ooh, that sounds good.

A.45:  -- and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in
the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business, and by
the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's re-,
chicken's done.

B.46:  Is done, right.

A.47:  So that's a real easy thing for me.

B.48:  Yeah, that sounds good, too.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.

A.51:  Oh, really.

B.52:  I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING, but (( )) --

A.53:  No, I don't, my mom gets that, but,

B.54:  -- they have one, if you like to cook, they have, every
recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one --

A.55:  Really.

B.56:  -- and, um, you know, every month they've got all different
kinds of recipes, but, [lipsmack] I got one in there about a
year or so ago on cheese cake, and it's just a regular cheese
cake, and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon
peel and orange peel --

A.59:  Um.

B.60:  -- and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when,
when you're eating the cheese cake, and it is wonderful, but it
takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five
minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the
oven for another forty-five minutes --

A.61:  Um.

B.62:  -- and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for
another [laughter] forty-five minutes --

A.63:  Oh, my goodness.

B.64:  -- and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room
temperature --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the
topping on the next day, but it's, it's very good.

A.67:  Well, I love cheese cake.  I have never been, I don't know,
the ones I have made I have not done that well with.  

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  I like a baked cheese cake, you know, I don't, I have had a
recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just
mix cream cheese and stuff --

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  -- and refrigerate it, you know --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- but that's not the same as a, a New York style --

B.74:  No [laughter], it's not.

A.75:  -- cheese cake.  And, uh, the recipes that I've used,
everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple, and then I make it,
and it's, it's really not very good --

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  -- but yours sounds good.  I bet that lemon and orange peel
gives it a little bit of tartness.

B.78:  It does, and it, it, it is really good.

A.79:  Um.  Well, that sounds interesting, so there's your good
dessert for your dinner party.

B.80:  Right [laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter]  Are you into serving wines with your dinner
party?

B.82:  Oh, sometimes, but I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any
means.

A.83:  Me, either.  I wish I knew more about it.

B.84:  I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa
Valley --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- but, um, you know, and I learned a little bit about them
then, but --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- you know what would be fun, they have some of those
classes you can take --

A.89:  They would be, if you just had time to do it.

B.90:  -- yeah, and then there's places, um, do you live in
Dallas --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- okay, there's places here that, um, offer, I think it's
like once a month, you can go and, to a particular restaurant or
whatever, and you can kind of take a cooking class --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- and then you get to eat everything afterwards, and then
they also go into the wines, you know --

A.95:  Well, how neat.

B.96:  -- to serve with, you know, different types of --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- of meals and that kind of thing, and it sounds like it's a
lot of fun.  We have some friends who've done that, and they've
really enjoyed it.

A.99:  Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.  I
guess I,

B.100:  Yeah, this place is called like Medina's or --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- Messina's Kitchen or something like that.

A.103:  Oh, well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.

B.104:  Yeah, it, it sounds like, like it,
