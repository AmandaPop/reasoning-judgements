==========================================================================

A.1:   I guess that's all I do [barking].  

B.2:   Is that it?  

A.3:   Yeah.  

@B.4:  Okay, start them off.  

A.5:   Uh, well, I was thinking [barking] how the government has
changed over in, uh, Europe and Russia. 

B.6:   Oh, yeah.  

A.7:   You know, all those countries becoming democratic, for one
thing.  

B.8:   Well, uh, I don't know what your age is, but I know when I was
growing up -- 

A.9:   Uh-uh.  Twenty-seven. 

B.10:   -- that, uh, communism, course, the big threat of communism --

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- McCarthyism back in the fifties and, and everything there,
we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to
get us and now [laughter] communism is no more.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   So that makes a huge difference to us.  

A.15:   Uh-huh.  And then I was thinking about how, uh, women's roles
have changed.  

B.16:   Uh.  

A.17:   Uh, I'm twenty-seven, by the way [laughter].  

B.18:   Pardon me?  

A.19:   I was born in sixty-four.  

B.20:   You were born in sixty-four?  

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   Okay, I'm older than that.  

A.23:   Okay.  

B.24:   I'm forty-four [laughter].  

A.25:   Okay.  

B.26:   I was born in forty-seven, so I've got a couple years on 
you --

A.27:   Uh-huh {faint}.

B.28:   -- and I can tell you that things, things have changed -- 

A.29:   Uh-huh.   

B.30:   -- a tremendous amount for women in the world -- 

A.31:   Uh-huh.  

B.32:   -- since I, you know, first started.  I'm not sure I, I'm not
sure they're better [laughter].  

A.33:   Uh-huh, that's true.  Because we might be liberated, but, now
we all have to work and [laughter] support ourselves [laughter]
and,   

B.34:   That's true.  

A.35:   But, uh, it has it's pluses and minuses, I guess.  

B.36:   Yeah, I feel sorry for women who truly do wish to kind of
follow the, the older tradition and stay home and -- 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   -- raise their family, take care of the kids and people say,
what, you don't work.  

A.39:   It's like a luxury now.  

B.40:   Well, yes, I work all day long.  

A.41:   Uh-huh.

B.42:   Thank you very much.  

A.43:   Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It's hard work, but it's like you have to have
a husband that makes very good money in order to do that, I guess. 

B.44:   Yeah, the cost, the cost of living has gone, just sky
rocketed.  

A.45:   Uh-huh.  That's true.  

B.46:   What do you think as far as the social mores, the morals of
people today as opposed to,

A.47:   Well, like, uh, my sister's younger than I am, and I think
that, uh, [laughter], like, they're all, uh, well, of course,
there's AIDS, and I don't have to guess why, you know, because,
because her generation, will just, like, jump in bed with anybody
[laughter], you know.  

B.48:   I, I, I really do, I feel, you know, I look back, and I have
two children, I have a daughter who's fifteen -- 

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   -- and my son is twenty.  

A.51:   Uh-huh.  It's scary,  

B.52:   And, I mean, it's very scary --

A.53:   Uh-huh {faint}.

B.54:   -- because they are living in a totally different time with
totally different fears -- 

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   -- than I grew up in.  

A.57:   Uh-huh.  

B.58:   You know, five years ago -- 

A.59:   Uh-huh.  

B.60:   -- even ten years ago, before the threat of AIDS entered -- 

A.61:   Uh-huh.  

B.62:   -- uh, I think things were, people were even possibly more
promiscuous -- 

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   -- because, you know, well, it was live and let live and
everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the
consequences.  

A.65:   Yeah, I guess, like in the sixties and the seventies.  I
was,  

B.66:   I think the seventies.

A.67:   Uh-huh.

B.68:   Maybe even the, well, in the eighties we started getting a, a
taste of it [breathing].  

A.69:   Uh-huh.  

B.70:   Uh, and people started saying, whoa, wait a minute [laughter]. 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   And, I don't know, I think there may even be a turnabout in
the nineties.  Not immediately -- 

A.73:   Uh-huh.  

B.74:   -- but as people become more and more [noise] terrified -- 

A.75:   Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.76:   -- of the AIDS virus -- 

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   -- uh, I think they're going to pull back sexually [ringing].

A.79:   Uh-huh.  

B.80:   I think they're going to pull back and we may find the
pendulum swings, you know -- 

A.81:   The other way.  

B.82:   -- back the other way somewhat.  

A.83:   Uh-huh.  I think you're right.  

B.84:   I, I think we, it has to.  

A.85:   Uh-huh.  

B.86:   Or our, uh, we, we won't survive.  

A.87:   Unless -- 

B.88:   Our, our world -- 

A.89:   -- they get a cure.  

B.90:   -- won't survive.  

A.91:   Unless they find a cure [laughter] real soon for AIDS.  

B.92:   Do you have children?  

A.93:   No, I'm single.  

B.94:   You're single.  

A.95:   Uh-huh.  

B.96:   Then you are in the midst of this.  

A.97:   Yeah [laughter].  I guess that's why I thought of it
[laughter].

B.98:   Yeah.  

A.99:   And, uh,  

B.100:   It, it's a different world for us.  

@@A.101:   Uh-huh.  Can you think of any other social issues?  

B.102:   No.  

A.103:   Government?  Uh, do you have any idea how long we have to
talk?  

B.104:   Just three minutes.  

A.105:  Oh, I didn't even look at the clock, did you?  

B.106:   Oh, yeah, it's been three minutes, dear.  

A.107:   Okay.  

B.108:   Okay, I've enjoyed talking to you.  

A.109:   Same here.  

B.110:   Okay, bye.  

A.111:   Nice, nice meeting you, bye-bye.  

B.112:   Uh-huh, bye-bye.
