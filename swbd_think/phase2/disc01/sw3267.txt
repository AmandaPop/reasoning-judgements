REMARKS:        There was a TV on or a radio on in the background
of Speaker A.  It was pretty loud.  Almost as loud as the speaker. 

=====================================================================

@A.1:   Wondering how you keep up on the news.   

B.2:   Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   I listen to the radio but not, um, not like I did when I was
working.  I am recently retired [noise] to that means I have a lot
of time to watch the news on T V.  How do you gain your news?  

A.5:   I guess the, I get the WASHINGTON POST --

B.6:   {Very faint}  Okay.

A.7:   -- and that is a pretty big newspaper and I think that's almost
exclusive me, -ly my ((first of the)) news.  Though I have the radio
on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits,
[laughter] because I'm not going right on the hour.  

B.8:   Oh, I see.  

A.9:   You know.

B.10:   Well, that's, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and,
and radio.  If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then
you lose out on an awful lot.  Well, what is your newspaper?  That
is the WASHINGTON POST --

A.11:   Right.  

B.12:   -- is that correct?  I have read that when we were in that area,
and it is a splendid newspaper.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

@@B.14:   So, what more do we need to discuss [laughter],

A.15:   [Laughter]. 

B.16:   tonight?  That seems like a very short one.  

A.17:   Right.  I think that, you know, we, we've resolved the issue
and that's what we were asked to do.  

B.18:   Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have, but, uh,
I feel that that's not part of our --

A.19:   Right.  

B.20:   -- responsibility.  

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:   So thank you for calling.  

A.23:   Oh, okay.  Well, thanks for discussing it.  

B.24:   All right.   

A.25:   #Bye-bye.#

B.26:   #Good-bye.#
