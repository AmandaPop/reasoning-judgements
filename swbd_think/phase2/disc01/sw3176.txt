A.1:  Okay, did, uh, all I, the scale is from one to ten, I think, one being, uh,
no.  Or, I'm sorry is a-, total control?

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  And then ten as being no control.  Is that what it was?  

B.4:  Oh, where would I be.  I would be somewhere around, um, seven or eight, I
think for control.

A.5:  Okay, so that would be like less control?  

B.6:  Oh, no, uh,  

A.7:  I, I'm confused, but I don't #really think it matters.#  

B.8:  #More on the, uh,# higher end.  

A.9:  Okay.  More control?  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  [Sniffing] Okay.  And why is that?  

B.12:  Uh, well, for one, I think criminals --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- uh, they, uh, I mean I'm all for people, you know, hunting and doing
their thing.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  Although I don't hunt personally.  

A.17:  Uh-huh, I don't either.  

B.18:  I don't, uh, I don't own any guns, but, uh, you know, I mean I've, I've
shot guns, plenty of guns, uh, target practice.

A.19:  Huh.  

B.20:  And, uh, well, I mean, I've kind of gone out hunting a little bit, you 
know --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- with boyfriends, but, uh,  

A.23:  Gosh, I've never done that [laughter].  

B.24:  [Laughter] It's, it's fun, but you really have to have respect for the
weapon.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And, uh, but the thing I'm concerned about is, you know, those people, you
know, like a seven day delay is not going to hurt those people.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  It's no big thing.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  Uh, you know, because it's, it's, you know, recreation.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Whereas the people who are going out to, uh, you know, for crime --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- you know, to rob somebody, now, I think that's good that they have
enough time to check their record --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- you know, and it, fr-,  

A.37:  Where it's a, like, cool down if they're just, like, in the (( )).

B.38:  Hey, yeah, it's for everybody's safety.  

A.39:  Uh-huh [sniffing].  I agree.  Uh, that's why I'm, I guess I'm like five.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  In the middle.  

B.42:  Yeah, I mean -- 

A.43:  Because,  

B.44:  -- I could be five, too.  

A.45:  Because, like, if I, like let's say if someone tried to break into my house
today, I would want to get a gun that day.

B.46:  Oh, well -- 

A.47:  You know.  

B.48:  -- I didn't think about that.   

A.49:  So I'd be protected tomorrow.  

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Or whatever, that night.  But, I wouldn't want some crazy nut that, you
know, gets mad at somebody else and says I'm going to kill them to be able to
get a gun that fast.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  So it's like a [laughter] double-edged sword, I guess.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  So,  

B.56:  Yeah, it definitely is.  I didn't think about the other side, huh.

A.57:  But I've never, I don't know if I've ever shot a gun.  

B.58:  Huh.  

A.59:  I,  

B.60:  Well, I served in the service -- 

A.61:  Oh. 

B.62:  -- so #you have to,#   

A.63:  #You have to# [laughter].  

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  That's neat.  

B.66:  You have to, uh, shoot a weapon and qualify -- 

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- otherwise you don't pass --  

A.69:  Huh.  

B.70:  -- so to speak, and, uh, we had to zero it, you know, to your own eye.
Each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- and how you look at the sights.  

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  And, uh,  

A.75:  Who, but, you wanted like slightly more rules.  Like, uh, like you're
towards the conservative end?

B.76:  Uh, well, I'm kind of fifty, fifty, you know.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  You know, hearing your argument, it g-, I'm just right smack in the middle.

A.79:  I was just wondering because, like, since I've never shot one, maybe it's
different if you've actually shot one or --

B.80:  Uh, well you,

A.81:  -- like you said, hunted, or, you know, maybe if I [laughter],

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  you know, had ever shot one.  

B.84:  Well, you definitely need to, you know, have the, uh, respect for it and --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something. 

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  You know, you might be within, let's say a foot range.  

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  I mean, uh, [laughter] I don't know, half a foot to a foot off, uh, just
because of your sights --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- and how you look through a sight as compared to somebody else.

A.93:  Huh.  What kind of hunting have you done?  

B.94:  Oh, uh, that was, uh, I think it was just for small, it was quail, I think.

A.95:  Huh.  

B.96:  I mean, yeah, that was just nothing.  Not, not anything like deer or
rabbits or squirrels.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  But, uh,  

A.99:  Huh {faint}.  Because, like, I have friends that hunt [sniffing] --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and, uh, but they're like real careful.  They kill the animal with like
one shot so they don't have like an injured animal running around.

B.102:  Oh, well, here, uh, actually about thirty minutes away, there was a guy
that fired, and the bullet actually went through the deer --

A.103:  Huh.  

B.104:  -- and then hit somebody and killed them.  

A.105:  Oh, my God.  

B.106:  So it hit two different targets, uh, in,  

A.107:  Does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or
some real super gun or,

B.108:  Oh, no.  It's, I'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something,
it, uh, it, it compresses.

A.109:  Huh.

B.110:  You know, it loses it's shape.  

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  But, uh, evidently they had bone fragments of both.  

A.113:  Oh, my Gosh.  

B.114:  So, uh, yeah, it killed and, and they've had several instances right here
in Raleigh and it was national news.

A.115:  Huh.  

B.116:  And it was a real big thing.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  But, uh, had several, uh, one woman was out in her backyard --

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  -- and she had a white glove on, she was taking her laundry down --

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  -- and the guy thought it was the tail of the, uh, deer.  

A.123:  Oh, my God.  

B.124:  And shot her [breathing].  

A.125:  Did she die, or,  

B.126:  Uh, I think so.  Yeah, there was two or three killings like right,

A.127:  Huh.  

B.128:  One was a schoolteacher and, of course, all the s-, kids, uh, were upset
about it --

A.129:  Uh-huh.  

B.130:  -- and it made the news.  

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  So, uh, 

A.133:  Huh.

B.134:  You know it's, it hit pretty close to home, I guess.  

A.135:  Gosh, I wouldn't want to live near a forest [laughter].  

B.136:  I know [laughter].  I wouldn't even want to go hiking, you know, with
people out there hunting [laughter].

A.137:  Uh-huh, really.  Are you still in the service, or,
