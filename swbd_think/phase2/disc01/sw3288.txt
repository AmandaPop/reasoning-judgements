A.1:   Hi.  So, uh, what was the last car repair you had?  

B.2:   [Laughter] Just recently I was kind of laughing when I, when
I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, I
had to have my, uh, radiator flushed -- 

@A.3:   Oh.  

B.4:   -- and it was getting rusty.  And the thing that they forgot
to do was to, um, to also look at the hose, and I had gone about
oh, two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst.  So
I was stranded out on the highway [laughter]. 

A.5:   Oh, no.  Did you crack the block or what?  

B.6:   No, I, I didn't do that thank goodness, but, uh, there seemed
to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that but it
cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after
they said they were going to, they had repaired it.  So that was,
that was a horrible experience --

A.7:   Yeah, I see.

B.8:   -- just recently.  

A.9:   You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.  

B.10:   Yes, yes.  

A.11:   That can be pretty serious.  

B.12:   I know.  I know.  What about you?  

A.13:   Oh, I guess it's been awhile for me.  I'd sa-, it's been about
a year.  

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   Yeah, I had the, uh, the water pump break on my car.  

B.16:   Oh.  

A.17:   Yeah, I was traveling, uh, I was going on my way home from
Thanksgiving -- 

B.18:   Uh-huh.  

A.19:   -- and it broke like in the middle of nowhere.  

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   So, I had to get it towed and then fixed and --

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   -- big pain.  

B.24:   Oh, oh, I know.  I know.  Especially when you're out on the
highway.  

A.25:   Yeah, that's where I was.  Luckily someone came by and gave me
a ride.  

B.26:   Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I know, well, you know, uh, living in
Dallas, you know we've got, uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of
traffic and, uh, that was, that was horrible.  

A.27:   Yeah [laughter]. 

B.28:   You know to have the, you know, your car is ((fuming)) and
everything.  It's already a hundred degrees you [laughter] don't
need that too.  

A.29:   [Laughter]. 

B.30:   Oh, shoot [lipsmack].  But my car is getting old.  See it's
about six years old now, so.  

A.31:   Yeah, so is mine [laughter].

B.32:   Yeah, so I got it right out of college and so it's, uh, it's
starting to show the wear and tear now.  

A.33:   Yeah, I'm hoping mine gets me through.  I got until May until
I'm out.  ((So when I cross)) that one I'll be okay.  

B.34:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, that, uh, that was my graduation
present to myself, so.

A.35:   Oh, that's nice [laughter].

B.36:   Yeah.  Yeah, I know so but gosh, it's really starting to, to
wear so I've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a
car.  

A.37:   Yeah.  

B.38:   Go-, because I can't, uh, I don't know if I want to, you know,
pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's
starting to breakdown.  

A.39:   Yeah, I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be
worth more than the car is and it's not worth it [laughter].

B.40:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  I agree with you there. 

A.41:   Yeah.  

B.42:   So I don't know, uh, because I, I need to have it tuned, you
know, tuned up and I don't know, replace some of the belts.  And I
was looking at the, uh, tires need to be replaced and so I was
thinking just a lot of money I'm, might as well buy me a new car
for that.  

A.43:   Yeah, I got new tires last winter too so I'm like, well,
that's the last major purchase for this thing.  It's not worth it. 

B.44:   Uh-huh.  Well, you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy, [noise] you
have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?  

A.45:   Yeah.  

B.46:   Uh-huh [noise].

A.47:   Yeah, we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.  

B.48:   Oh, really?  

A.49:   Yeah.  

B.50:   Oh, okay.  So,

A.51:   Lot of snow and a lot of cold.  

B.52:   Uh-huh.  Well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt
on the ground?  

A.53:   Yeah, at times there's a lot of it.  

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the
time when you get a chance.

B.56:   Yeah.  Yeah, well, rust and the, and the body too, huh?  

A.57:   Yeah, I haven't had a big problem with that though.  

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   So I've been pretty lucky there.  

B.60:   [Lipsmack]  Well, I think they get the new ((Z-bart)) stuff
and everything to where you can, um, 

A.61:   Yeah, that's usually pretty good.  You just rinse it off after
the winter is over and --

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- done with it.  

B.64:   Yeah, and go like that so.  

A.65:   Yeah.  I usually like to do most repairs on my own though.  

B.66:   Do you?  

A.67:   Yeah, just because that way I know what's wrong with my car
and what it needs and what it really doesn't.  

B.68:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.69:   Yeah.  Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.  

B.70:   [Laughter].  

A.71:   [Laughter].

B.72:   Well, I, I think I'm getting too old for all that.  My, uh, I
had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car,
and stuff so I can, I can do all that stuff but I, I think I'd much
prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to, to go have it done now
so I can get my hands dirty.  

A.73:   [Laughter]. 

B.74:   So, yeah.  I'm just getting, getting to that age I guess.  You
just don't have, your time becomes very precious so working on the
car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on
anymore [laughter]. 

A.75:   [Laughter] More fun things to do.  

B.76:   Absolutely, absolutely.  So, 

A.77:   [Laughter]. 

B.78:   yeah, I'm trying to, you know, I just need one, I had two cars
there for a while so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was
going to run.  

A.79:   Well, that's nice.  

B.80:   And yeah, so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and
maintain both of them.  

A.81:   Yeah.  

B.82:   And yeah, so that,

A.83:   One is bad enough [laughter]. 

B.84:   Yes, one was bad enough.  But I think I got rid of the wrong
one [laughter]. 

A.85:   [Laughter]. 

B.86:   I soon, I need a lot of repairs done on, on this one so yeah, 

A.87:   [Laughter]. 

@@B.88:   that was, uh, that was something else {pause}.  Well, are our
five minutes up?  [Laughter]. 

A.89:   [Laughter] Yeah, I was just wondering that [laughter].

B.90:   [Laughter] I, I didn't, I didn't set the time or anything to,
uh,

A.91:   Yeah, I didn't either.  

B.92:   Yeah, ((put)),

A.93:   Yeah, this must be a, a hard category.  

B.94:   Well, yeah, I guess.  Um, you know, unless you're, um, you
know, big do-it-yourselfer.  Um, to, you know, fix up your own cars
and, and things like that.  So, but I guess they were talking about
experiences.  You know, I, uh, uh, I did, my parents live in Ohio
so I, I do know something about the, you know, the really cold
weather.  And, uh, I've always lived down here in the south, and,
oh, I took my car up there to their house and, um, I guess I had a
crack in the block, and when I got up there the car,
