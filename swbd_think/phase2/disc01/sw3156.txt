============================================================================

A.1:   -ing seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take
about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a
generation to two [laughter].  And we may have to do it out of
necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.  Uh, it does seem
to be a lot of habits to break.  I, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on
it, but my kids are and so they, they tended to want to grab the
aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do, and we
were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out [breathing]
and they weren't worth anything anymore.  

B.2:   Uh-huh.  

A.3:   And we [breathing], it took us, [lipsmack] almost a year
to get a garbage sack full.  We just don't drink that many.  So as
far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a
while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something and, and
by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh,
at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,
and we came out with about a dollar [laughter], it just really
wasn't worth it.  

B.4:   And a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying, 

A.5:   Yeah.  

B.6:   Yeah.  

A.7:   So, they, they realized, you know, well, of course to them a
dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.  That wasn't, uh,
that was a big deal, but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
and then, uh, T I started keeping up with, uh, cans there, so
occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or
the like and throw them in there.  Least it gets back into the
system, but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, I haven't started
on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up. 
Have you all got the individual containers yet?  

B.8:   [Lipsmack] No, I read in the paper this week where maybe,
I don't know if it w-, was, I guess maybe this week someone may
start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in
time.  

A.9:   Um.  

B.10:   But, it, it should be starting, I would stay probably in the
next month if, if everything goes that [breathing], I'm not sure
all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate
containers, I really don't understand that part on what they've
told you to separate everything.  

A.11:   Right.  Yeah, it seemed like, uh, if, if I recall, it's been
a long time.  They're way behind schedule on that particular part
of it.  They were fine on the green, big green containers -- 

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   -- but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have
a bin and all different types would go in there and then that they
would sort it as -- 

B.14:   Oh. 

A.15:   -- as needed.  It, it seemed that there was, at the time
anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting
sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where
everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that
kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those
are okay to have the general public doing the sorting.  But when it
comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh,
the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,
so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it
real quick was better than, than -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh. 

A.17:   -- having a household try it.  But I, I don't know, that
sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth
of trash for a house.  

B.18:   Well, it would get messy, too.  

A.19:   Yeah, yeah,  

B.20:   I, I, I know other places when they recycle, they have to,
like, wash out their glass jars and -- 

A.21:   Right.  

B.22:   -- whatnot.  And, uh, which we're not in the habit of doing.

A.23:   That's true.

B.24:   I was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they
didn't even have cans.  They had bottles and you'd return them to
the -- 

A.25:   Right.  

B.26:   -- the grocery store and you'd get our money back and that,
that was all well and good.  They don't seem to still be doing
that.  If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass, but, I
guess this day and age -- 

A.27:   Yeah.  

B.28:   -- they don't.  

A.29:   [Lipsmack] They don't do that.  We live next to a set of
railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people
driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles
at the tracks and try to crash, you know -- 

B.30:   Uh-huh.  

A.31:   -- break them, but, uh, they weren't that successful, so there
were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half
a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we
wanted --

B.32:   Uh-huh.

A.33:   -- for the day [laughter] and,  

B.34:   Yeah, and they, uh, p-, I, I think kids don't appreciate,
maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,
they can get more somewhere else.  

A.35:   Yeah, just a little bit of begging will [laughter],   

B.36:   Uh, for a good, right.  They're, the nickels, the dimes or
what, I [laughter] suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces
in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem
to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.  

A.37:   Right.  Well, I wonder,  

B.38:   But, we, we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and
when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents, so I
would say --

A.39:   Yeah.

B.40:   -- in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more
cans than ever before.  Uh, it was just easier [breathing] to do
that than to open a large [breathing] liter bottle and then have
it go flat.  

A.41:   Right, yeah.  

B.42:   [Lipsmack] So that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are
into cans [laughter] at this point rather than the liter bottles
[laughter].  

A.43:   Where do you take your cans?  

B.44:   Well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up.  Since
we've had the crusher all summer, we [breathing], I guess we
just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-, oh, I think the
kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a,
a recycling place, probably at one of the li-,
