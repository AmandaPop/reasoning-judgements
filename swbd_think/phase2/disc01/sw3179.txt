very quickly, running words together often.

=========================================================================

A.1:   T V show?  

B.2:   Uh, probably L A LAW.  

A.3:   Huh.  Why?  

B.4:   Uh, [noise] I don't know, I like all the court cases and, uh,
the romance between everybody.  

A.5:   Uh-huh.  

B.6:   And what about you?  

A.7:   [Laughter] I like silly ones compared to [laughter] that.  I
like, uh, PERFECT STRANGERS.  

B.8:   Oh, okay.  

A.9:   You seen that?  

B.10:   My fiancee likes that.  

A.11:   Who, oh, your fiance?  

B.12:   Yeah.  

A.13:   And, uh, I like that show with ((Erkyl)).  I forget,  

B.14:   Yeah, she likes that, too.  

A.15:   Uh-huh.  All those,  

B.16:   We always have to tape all those on Fridays.  

A.17:   Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And, uh, I like those, all those video shows
they have now.  

B.18:   Oh, yeah, AMERICA'S FAVORITE HOME VIDEOS.  

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   Yeah.  ((That's my)).

A.21:   Anything like that I like. #What else do you like?#

B.22:   #Yeah, that's all right.#  I like THE PRICE IS RIGHT, too.  

A.23:   [Laughter] Oh. 

B.24:   But I never get a chance to watch it [laughter].  

A.25:   You don't get to watch it?  

B.26:   No, huh-uh.  

A.27:   Uh-huh.  

B.28:   Yeah, I'm always gone at eleven.  

A.29:   So you have to tape it or something?  

B.30:   Yeah, or I just miss it.  

A.31:   Huh.  

B.32:   Yeah, I used to watch it all the time, though.  I never missed
it.  

A.33:   Huh [beep].  Do you ever watch, uh, SUNDAY COMICS?  

B.34:   No, I never heard of that.  

A.35:   Oh. 

B.36:   Oh, wait is that on like at, nine or ten -- 

A.37:   I think it's on Fox.  

B.38:   -- or something.  Yeah.  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   Yeah, I've watched that before.  It's all right.  

A.41:   Uh-huh.  It's funny.  This is, uh, black comedian George
Wallace that makes a joke about THE PRICE IS RIGHT, you know.  

B.42:   Oh, okay.  I've never seen that.  

A.43:   Uh, I don't know if you've ever heard that joke [laughter].
He's like, uh, he said that show is prejudice because they have
like the dumbest, hugest black women on that show and they run down
and they're like [yelling].  And (( )).  You just have to see him
because it's like grabbing himself and,

B.44:   Oh, so I'll have to watch it tonight.  

A.45:   Uh-huh.  It's funny.  

B.46:   [Laughter]. 

A.47:   And, uh, I, I guess I just like funny shows mostly.  

B.48:   Yeah, I usually have the T V just for background noise all the
time.  

A.49:   Uh-huh, me, too.  

B.50:   Yeah, I don't, I don't think it's ever off.  

A.51:   Uh-huh.  I have it on right now [laughter].  

B.52:   [Laughter]. 

A.53:   CHIPS is on, who.  

B.54:   Yeah, I just turned it off when the phone rang.  

A.55:   Oh. 

B.56:   [Laughter]. 

A.57:   Uh, [throat_clearing] uh, you like soap operas at all or,   

B.58:   No, I can't stand those.  

A.59:   Uh-huh, me neither.  

B.60:   D-, oh, wow, that's, that's odd.  

A.61:   Uh-huh.

B.62:   Two people actually don't like them [laughter].  

A.63:   Huh.  

B.64:   Yeah, I think they're the stupidest shows.  

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.67:   And, uh, I guess I like, like TWENTY TWENTY and -- 

B.68:   Yeah --

A.69:   -- any kind of, 

B.70:   -- that's all right.  SIXTY MINUTES is okay.  

A.71:   Uh-huh.  Documentaries, because I teach.  

B.72:   Oh, really?  

A.73:   And lots of times I can tape them and use them for school.  

B.74:   Oh, that's a good idea.

A.75:   Uh-huh {faint}.

B.76:   So television's actually useful.  

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   [Laughter] Yeah, it seems like, we have cable, and there's
never anything on.  We just have more of nothing.  

A.79:   I can't afford cable [laughter].  

B.80:   Oh, it comes with our apartment.  

A.81:   Huh.  

B.82:   [Laughter] So you're not, 

A.83:   So, do you live in Dallas, or,  

B.84:   Huh?  

A.85:   Are you from Dallas?  

B.86:   No, huh-uh.  

A.87:   Where you are from?  

B.88:   I'm in Pennsylvania.  

A.89:   Okay, because yesterday I got somebody in North Carolina.  

B.90:   Oh. 

A.91:   And, uh, before then, I think everybody was in Dallas.  

B.92:   Huh.  

A.93:   So, huh.  

B.94:   No, we asked to have cable clear up in the mountains and you
can't get anything.  

A.95:   Oh. 

B.96:   And,  

A.97:   Huh, that's interesting.  

B.98:   But there's nothing on T V ever hardly.  

A.99:   Huh.  Because we have about a zillion channels here, in
Dallas.  

B.100:   Oh, we, we can't get anything.  We can get like one -- 

A.101:   Huh.  

B.102:   -- without it.  

A.103:   Oh, that stinks.  It is like a rip off or cable or not, not,
is it reasonable or,

B.104:   It's all right.  I don't think it's that bad.  

A.105:   Huh.  

B.106:   But there's never anything on.  

A.107:   Uh-huh.  

B.108:   It's just background noise again.  

A.109:   Huh.  My mom's from Pennsylvania.  

B.110:   Oh. 

A.111:   What part?  

B.112:   Right in the middle.  

A.113:   Can you, uh-huh.  

B.114:   Yeah, Center County.  

A.115:   Huh {pause}.  So,  

B.116:   Yeah, we don't have any T V stations in this city, so they're
all from other cities.  

A.117:   Uh-huh.  

B.118:   [Breathing]. 

A.119:   Huh {pause}.  Well,  

B.120:   Yeah, I guess we watch a lot of C N N, too.  

A.121:   Huh.  That's a news station?  

B.122:   Yeah, but it always repeats, like every half-hour so we watch
the same thing -- 

A.123:   Uh-huh.  

B.124:   -- every half-hour [laughter]. 

A.125:   That's like GOOD MORNING AMERICA.  

B.126:   Yeah.  

A.127:   I think, if you watch it long enough, I think they repeat, at
least like the headlines [breathing].  And, 

B.128:   Yeah.  

A.129:   So,  

B.130:   Yeah, after like an hour or so, you just watch everything
again and again and again [laughter].  

A.131:   Uh-huh.  Well, at least you know the news real well.  

B.132:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.133:   And people think, are impressed by, wow [laughter].  

B.134:   [Laughter].

A.135:   How do you know all this stuff [laughter].  

B.136:   Yeah, then you get sick of watching.  Like, man, not this
story again.  

A.137:   Huh.  

B.138:   You don't pay attention to anything.  

A.139:   Uh-huh.  Huh.  Uh, trying to think of some other shows.  Do
you like [laughter] THE THREE STOOGES?  

B.140:   [Laughter] No, I like LAUREL AND HARDY, though.  

A.141:   Really, because a lot of guys like THE THREE STOOGES and they
drive me crazy [laughter].  

B.142:   [Laughter] Yeah, I never got into them much [laughter].  

A.143:   Huh.  I know, how about cartoons?  Do you like to watch
cartoons?  

B.144:   Yeah.  

A.145:   Uh-huh.  

B.146:   I like the ROAD RUNNER cartoons.  

A.147:   Uh-huh.  

B.148:   Yeah [laughter]. 

A.149:   My sister loves anything like that BUGS BUNNY or,

B.150:   Yeah, they're not on that often, though.  

A.151:   Huh {pause}.  And, uh,  

B.152:   Least not around here.  

A.153:   Huh.  I like, uh, I used to like PEE WEE HERMAN before they
took it off.  

B.154:   [Laughter]. 

A.155:   PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE.  

B.156:   Yeah, I guess no one will be watching that anymore.  

A.157:   Uh-huh.  Well, they said he might do something else now, like
branch off a different way, like maybe more adult humor or
something.  

B.158:   Yeah, that's what he started doing anyway.  

A.159:   Yeah, uh-huh, I like that stuff.  I mean he was always a
pervert, you know.  

B.160:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.161:   It didn't surprise me when he got caught, you know,  

B.162:   [Laughter]. 

A.163:   doing that. 

B.164:   Yeah, I wasn't too surprised either.  Didn't look like him,
though.  

A.165:   Uh-huh.  

B.166:   All the pictures.  

A.167:   Yep.  

B.168:   Yeah, I've seen that show twice and it was the same one both
times.   

A.169:   Huh.  

B.170:   I guess I never will see it anymore.  

A.171:   Yeah, because they're repeats now.  Or they were repeats,
