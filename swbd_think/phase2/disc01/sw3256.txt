=====================================================================

A.1:  Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time.  Was that
you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt?

B.2:  Yes, Yes, 

@A.3:  And it said that what, what do we, do we think that cri-,
certain crimes should fit certain punishments, and, uh, I was
thinking about it after I got off the phone, that, that I really,
you know, wish that there was some way to, uh, send a message to
people, you know, about, um, child abuse and things like that --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- that, uh, those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe
punishment.  Too often I feel that people get off, uh,

B.6:  [Inhaling].

A.7:  without,

B.8:  Yeah, I, I agree with you, although I will say, I'm not
sure, you know, I sometimes have a problem with some of the,
especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling
out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have, you
know, was, was because they were abused a-, abused as children. 
And the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute, we didn't do
anything like that --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- you know, and, and, and I guess before I'd like to see
that severe of a punishment for it [noise] it has to be a, an
absolute certainty --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- you know, like, uh, [breathing] caught at it, or
something --

A.13:  Right, right,

B.14:  -- you know, or if they, they, uh, you know, severely beat up
on a child, or, you know, I would have absolutely no problem at
all --

A.15:  Yeah,

B.16:  -- you know, with, with, I don't buy the routine, oh they're
just sick, or they were abused when they were little --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- well, you know, forget that.

A.19:  Yeah, well, sometimes they even wonder when, when, uh,
criminals plead temporary insanity for, for punish-, for crimes
that are so severe --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and then, you know, they get sent to a mental institution
and they play loony for a while, and then they're back out in
public.

B.22:  Well, but I can't see that either.  I don't feel that that
should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag-, uh, you know --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- reason to not use capital punishment.

A.25:  Yeah, oh, I agree, I agree, because we,

B.26:  I think, uh, [noise] I think if I wanted to badly enough, I
could convince somebody, uh, I was crazy [laughter],

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  so, my family may say that on occasion, who knows
[laughter],

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  you know, uh, I, I don't think it's that hard to do --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- you know, to, to convince somebody that, uh, Gee, you just
had no control over what you were doing,

A.33:  Yeah, yeah, well, and too, you know, they can always be
blaming the other person, well, she looked like my mother who
abused me when I was a child, or --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- something, which I think is, unfortunate for that
person --

B.36:  Uh-huh,

A.37:  -- and yet shouldn't be an excuse.  I guess, you know, a lot
of, and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store
that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and,

B.38:  That's the new one.

A.39:  Is that the new, I just happened to see the headline on it,
and I didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the
father or what, but I thought, uh, you know, if these things, if
children are being abused, I, I'm wondering how our school system
is failing, that they're not even seeing this, you know, if it
was that severe that when they're later in life adults, that it's
all of a sudden affecting them in this way, that it wasn't shown
up at all when they were younger, and that kind of, that kind of
worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you
know, to, to deal with that yet, but still.

B.40:  Well, you, you're right, uh, and yet, I mean, did you ever in
your life when you were little know [laughter] anybody or hear
anything of anything like this? 

A.41:  Never --

B.42:  No, 

A.43:  -- and I lived in California --

B.44:  (( )) [laughter].

A.45:  -- which I feel like California, you know, anything can go on
in California.  

B.46:  Ye-, well, yes, I, but I was from conservative Wisconsin
[laughter],

A.47:  [Laughter]. 

B.48:  and, uh, you know, there was, there was, nothing on it,
which makes me wonder, you know, if it's as, uh, prevalent as, as
some of them claim.  

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  It, uh, it, it, it's, you just don't know, and it all, unless
they're caught in the act or the-, the-, the child is very badly,
you know, beaten up, it comes down to a one word against the
other --

A.51:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.52:  -- that type thing.  Now, Texas, is capital punishment for,
it used to be just capital murder, and now the-, they added mass
murder.  Are those the only two things that we, uh --

A.53:  I really would have no idea.  I, um, I don't, don't really
know.

B.54:  -- uh, you know, because I have a feeling it is, and I, I
think there ought to be more things added to it.

A.55:  Uh-huh --

B.56:  Uh,

A.57:  -- that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.

B.58:  [Breathing] Yeah, I, I think that's, I, you know, uh,
killing a child, or kidnapping, uh, and possibly not, well, I
guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt, you
know, if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't
deserve the death penalty,

A.59:  Yeah, that's, that, or like when, uh, I've heard when I,
