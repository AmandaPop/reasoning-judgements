======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, do you have children of your own?

B.2:  Yeah, I've got, uh, four.

A.3:  Oh, you do.  What ages are they?

B.4:  Uh, let's see, uh, fourteen, twelve, five and one and a half.

A.5:  Oh, my --

B.6:  Kind of st-,

A.7:  -- sound like a busy parent.

B.8:  Yeah, how about you?

A.9:  I have two, a seven year old and three and a half.  Mine are
both girls.

B.10:  Seven year old, okay.  

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Okay, I've got one boy, the oldest one's a boy and the three
others are girls.

A.13:  Oh.  Do you and your wife both work?

B.14:  No, huh-uh, no, she, um, my wife stays home.

A.15:  Well, that's nice.

B.16:  Yeah --

A.17:  I --

B.18:  -- how about yo-, how about yourself?

A.19:  -- I stay home, too [laughter].

B.20:  Do you?

A.21:  Yeah --

B.22:  Huh.

A.23:  -- to me that's the ideal situation --

B.24:  Yeah,

A.25:  -- but I did work part time when I had, 

B.26:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.27:  just one child --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and, uh, I'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care,
I --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- I don't care too much for day care centers and preschool,
well, you know, schools where the children stay all day long --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and so I, I think the thing that I would think was most
important is if they're getting the individual attention that
they need from an adult --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- and I don't think they get enough of it [laughter].

B.36:  So what would you, what, is there a certain ratio that would
scare you off, or --

A.37:  Yeah --

B.38:  -- of teachers to kids.

A.39:  -- mine's pretty low, too.  Uh, the lady that I left my
daughter with only kept, only had two other children besides my
daughter, so --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- three to one I felt comfortable with --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- I think if it got much more than that, 

B.44:  [Sniffing].

A.45:  I would start feeling like someone was going to be left
out.

B.46:  So you're talking, you're pretty well limited to, to home
care then, someone --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- someone taking your, your, your kid into their home.

A.49:  Right.  I don't thin-, well, I think once my, uh, child got
to be maybe four years old, I might feel a little better about a
larger group setting, but up until that time, 

B.50:  [Throat_clearing].

A.51:  both of my girls had such passive personalities --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- that if they had been around a whole lot of other children
I really think they would have been, you know, taken for granted
[laughter] --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- some of the other kids would have pushed them around, and,
um, probably taken advantage of them a little bit.

B.56:  Uh-huh [sniffing].

A.57:  What do you think?

B.58:  [Throat_clearing] Um, [sniffing] I guess I-, ideally, um, uh, I
would, if I, if my wife had to go to work, we'd probably look for
a home where the ratio of, of, uh, um, adults to children was,
was, you know, low --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- and I don't think, you won't find that in a, in a --

A.61:  No.

B.62:  -- commercially run day care,

A.63:  No.

B.64:  What was that beep?

A.65:  Oh, I didn't even hear one.

B.66:  You didn't?

A.67:  No, it might have been, I have call waiting --

B.68:  So do I.

A.69:  -- but if so, I'll just try later [laughter].

B.70:  Okay.

A.71:  That's fine,

B.72:  Um, [throat_clearing] what, so what, what were we saying,
that, um, 

A.73:  Yeah, you said that, uh, you would like, if your wife had to
go back to work, you probably --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- would prefer that they stayed in a home,

B.76:  Yeah, because how can you, um [sniffing], you know, did you see
the, did you see the, um, I think it was on, it was either TWENTY
TWENTY or SIXTY MINUTES about that, the day care in Louisiana --

A.77:  Oh, yeah,

B.78:  -- and it looked, when the parents visited it looked like,
um, that everything looked fine --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and, and --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- that appeared to be what, what the case when they were
there, but then --

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  -- then, uh, it turned out that, uh, so how do you protect
yourself against that, I wonder?

A.85:  Yeah, I don't know, see I feel real sorry for couples where
both people are, you know, have to work to make ends meet --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- because you're kind of, you know, stuck there [laughter]. 
I, I know that, um, if I had to go to work right now, I would
really have a hard time finding someone because I, 

B.88:  [Sniffing].

A.89:  baby sitters are just really hard to come by, an-,
especially real good ones and, you know, ones that, uh, don't
keep that many children and give them the individual attention
that I think they need, and that kind of thing --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- so I would really be hard pressed to find something that I
felt like was quality child care. 

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  So, I don't know, I feel real sorry for, you know, working
moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job
with their kids.  I'm just thankful I'm able to stay home [laughter].

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  It makes the choice a lot easier.

B.96:  Well, we've been, my wife has stayed home, uh, fourteen years
now --

A.97:  Wow --

B.98:  -- and it's --

A.99:  -- that's great,

B.100:  -- yeah, it's not always been easy --

A.101:  Oh, I know.

B.102:  -- um, to do, because --

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  -- there are many times when another salary would be --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- real helpful.

A.107:  Oh, yeah.  We feel that way.  I mean, even now, it's really
hard to make ends meet even with two children --

B.108:  Yeah,

A.109:  -- so I can imagine with four --

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  -- but you learn how to m-, to stretch money [laughter] --

B.112:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.113:  -- how to use hand me downs and that kind of thing --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- really makes a big difference too.  But I don't know, I,
uh, I worked at a little preschool.  It was a private one, you
know, like a church sponsored type thing --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- where it was only two days a week, Tuesday and Thursday
from like nine until two --

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  -- and even that I was not totally satisfied with the way the
kids were treated --

B.120:  Yeah --

A.121:  -- uh,

B.122:  -- my wife worked worked, has worked at a couple of those
too --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- and she's never, never been, uh, um, satisfied with, with,
uh, with what the children were getting, and --

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  -- and then she worked, um, not too long ago for, just
filling in, she filled in at a real large commercial,
commercially run where there were like, I don't know how many
kids there were, but it was --

A.127:  Oh.

B.128:  -- twenty kids in a room and I don't know how many adults
they had, but --

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  -- um, so,
