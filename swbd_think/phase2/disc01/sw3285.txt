============================================================

A.1:  Uh, so what have you seen recently?  

B.2:  Well, let's see.  Why don't you start?  I'm trying [laughter] to remember.

A.3:  Okay.  I've seen, uh, oh, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS.  That was filmed in Denton.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  Uh, have you seen that one?  

B.6:  No.  

A.7:  It's pretty good.  I really enjoyed that one.  

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  Um, let's see.  I just rented, um, we watched, um, let's see.

B.10:  Uh, let's see.  I guess one of the last ones I saw that I really enjoyed
was GHOST.

A.11:  Yes.  Wasn't that a good movie?  

B.12:  That was great.  

A.13:  I really liked that one.  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  But I like, um, oh, who's the lead in that?  Swayze.  I think he's a good
actor.

B.16:  Swayze?  Yeah.  

A.17:  Yeah.  Patrick Swayze.  

B.18:  Yeah, we have a personal acquaintance with -- 

A.19:  Oh, you do?  

B.20:  -- his mother.  

A.21:  Oh, really?  

B.22:  She's a dance instructor over here, and not an instructor so much.  She
choreographed a, some of his movies.

A.23:  Oh, really?  Um, wou-, that would be wonderful.  

B.24:  Patrick Swayze.  Yeah [breathing] [noise].

A.25:  Uh-huh.  And, uh, he, that one he has out recently that POINT BREAK, I
haven't seen it but they said it's really good.

B.26:  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  

A.27:  I haven't seen it.  We rented, um, oh, what was that movie?  About the rock
star, and I can't remember what it was now.

B.28:  Huh.  {Yells at someone in the background}  Hey, Gayle!

A.29:  Um, boy, and I can't remember now.  

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  Um,

B.32:  {Asks someone in the background} What was one of Patrick Swayze's last
movies?  {Person replies but inaudible} {Talks to person in the background
again} No, the one with the rock star?  {Person replies but inaudible} Getting
a little help here [laughter].

A.33:  [Laughter] I can't remember what that one is, um, but, uh, THE DOORS.

B.34:  {Person in the background is still talking}  POINT BREAK?

A.35:  Oh, yeah, that's the one he's in now.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  And that's suppose to be great.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  And then, uh, but I've also rented THE DOORS with, um, that story about the
Morrison,

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, uh --

B.42:  I didn't see that or hear any of that.

A.43:  -- that is weird.  I mean, I, I couldn't understand it,

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  I guess.  [laughter]  It was real tough to understand.

B.46:  Well, I, let's see.  I just, uh, feel obliged to make a comment that the,
uh, I think the movies have too much violence in them these days.

A.47:  I do too.  I do too.  Um, they're unreal.  I mean, it's, it's almost too
much and,

B.48:  And they wonder, oh, gee, I wonder where all this crime is coming from.

A.49:  Yeah, and it's like, no, we're not provoking it.  No [laughter].

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  And, and it's even what, what kills me even more is what we've allowed to
go over the television.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  You know movies are one thing where there is some type of rating --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- but T V is out of control,

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  as far as I'm concerned.

B.58:  It seems that way.

A.59:  Yeah.  You know, i-, pretty soon we're going to use every word in the
English language [laughter],

B.60:  [Laughter]. 

A.61:  on the television and everything else, 

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  but.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Um, one of the movies, I'm, I
just moved here from South Dakota.  

B.64:  Oh, really?  

A.65:  And, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed out, by where I,

B.66:  That's one of the, just the one I was just fixing to say was DANCES WITH
WOLVES.

A.67: Yeah, and that's where we lived.  Yeah, in Pierre.  And, uh,

B.68:  ((Yeah,)) you liked that I suppose.

A.69:  Yeah  [laughter].

B.70:  That would be one I would expect you would like.  Yeah.  

A.71:  But, um, my father-in-law flies, and he flew us over the, like the buffalo
ranch and everything where they, you know, took them ((heat)).  There is a
herd of buffalo,

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  that they used for that and, um,

B.74:  [Laughter]. 

A.75:  that was quite a long movie, 

B.76:  {Very faint}  Yeah.

A.77:  but it was good.  

B.78:  Yeah, it was.  

A.79:  {Very faint} It really was.

B.80:  That was, uh, [sniffing] [throat_clearing] interesting from the historical
standpoint.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, the, the hardest part with that is that it was very, you
know, good from a historical part of it, but to, you know, for now there was a
lot of, um, discrimination feelings coming back out.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  You know living up there with, you know, the tribes and things like that.
It started to come back, it started to surface again --

B.84:  Yeah, you heard about them,

A.85:  -- which was kind of a,

B.86:  going to rename or, uh, talking about renaming, the, that park
up there where the, uh, Little Big Horn was fought.  

A.87:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, they were going to rename that to, oh, now I
can't remember.  

B.88:  It was Custer's.  

A.89:  Custer.  Yep.  And now, 

B.90:  And now,

A.91:  they're going to rename it Little Big Horn.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  That's a good idea.  

A.95:  Yeah.  That whole thing kind of did that.  And then, of course, I always
watch Julia Roberts' movies [laughter].

B.96:  Pardon?  

A.97:  I always watch the Julia Roberts' movies.  

B.98:  Julia Roberts.  Huh.

A.99:  Yeah, like PRETTY WOMAN and,

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  I think FLATLINERS I really enjoyed.  

B.102:  I don't think I s-, see, did I, no, my wife was watching that.  [laughter]
I saw,

A.103:  Yeah I,

B.104:  little glimpses of it.  

A.105:  [Laughter]  That was really good.  That was, that was weird, 

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  you know, for to, to see if, you know, the person's
description of that.  

B.108:  Yeah.  Oh, that was where they, uh, these like researchers were,

A.109:  Yeah, they were,

B.110:  trying to see if they could put them to death and then bring
them back.  

A.111:  Right, they were like five medical students.  

B.112:  Yeah, right.  

A.113:  And he, they would put them into death for thirty seconds or whatever and
they'd come back out and see how close they could get.

B.114:  Uh-huh.  

A.115:  And when they'd come back out, they'd bring their sins with them.  And they
had to,

B.116:  Oh, I never did see that part, I just saw the first part.

A.117:  and they had to settle their sins, 

B.118:  [Laughter]. 

A.119:  because they brought them back with them.  It was really weird.  [laughter]
But it was,
