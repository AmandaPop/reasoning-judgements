REMARKS:        It sounded like speaker B had call waiting on her
telephone.  It kept making a long beep every now and then.

=======================================================================

A.1:   Okay, Diane.  And a very good afternoon to you.   

B.2:   And aft-, good afternoon to you.  

@A.3:  Do you, uh, do most of your cooking at home or do you, uh,
have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?  

B.4:   [Throat_clearing]  Um, no.  I do most of my cooking at home
and, um, I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner
party.  

A.5:   Uh-huh.  My goodness [laughter]. 

B.6:   [Laughter]. 

A.7:   Well, what would you, uh, like to cook?  What's, what, what's,
what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to 
have --  

B.8:   Um,

A.9:   -- for a dinner party?  Now you're in Dallas, is it?  

B.10:   Right, I'm in Dallas.  

A.11:   Okay.

B.12:   Of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out
to be more things like barbecues [laughter].  And,

A.13:   I was, I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost,

B.14:   Uh-huh, yes.  

A.15:   Tex-, Tex-Mex.

B.16:   Yeah, uh, Tex-Mex, uh, Mexican food, um -- 

A.17:   Uh-huh.   

B.18:   -- probably a little bit different than what you serve up in
Pennsylvania for a dinner party.  

A.19:   Well, that's a very interesting food though and when I go out
to eat dinner sometimes -- 

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   -- that's the type of foods I like to find.  

B.22:   Right.  

A.23:   We have, uh, I think som-, Chico's or, or in these different
restaurants --

B.24:   Uh-huh.  

A.25:   -- in this area that, uh, have all this fine Mexican foods.  But,
um, if I were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard
to you but, uh, actually I never get too much fried chicken.  

B.26:   [Laughter] Fried chicken.  

A.27:   But I would have fried chicken, uh, with reasonably hot sauce
on it.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   Almost a Mexican type thing.  And I love twice cooked
potatoes.  Have you ever had twice cooked potatoes?  

B.30:   [Throat_clearing]  Oh, yes, I have.  

A.31:   With, with a cream made of the, the sour cream and cream
cheese and, uh, a little oleo and I use, uh, oregano and --

B.32:   Uh-huh.   

A.33:   -- maybe dill weed, uh, mixed in with it.  

B.34:   Right.  

A.35:   And, uh, I like broccoli casseroles --  

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill
weed --

B.38:   Uh-huh.    

A.39:   -- and some medium hot peppers.  As you can see, I'm inclined
towards the Mexican type of a meal [laughter].

B.40:   Right [laughter]. 

A.41:   And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion
rings mixed in there with it too.  

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   So, uh, how would you improve upon that?  

B.44:   Oh, [gasp] improve upon that?  Let's see.  I'd probably put a
bunch of fresh vegetables in.  And some,

A.45:   More fresh vegetables?  

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   Included to that?  

B.48:   Uh, green beans and, uh --

A.49:   Uh-huh.

B.50:   -- carrots and things like that.  

A.51:   How do you cook your green beans?  

B.52:   My green beans?  

A.53:   Uh-huh.  

B.54:   Um, I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and
snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about
ten minutes.  

A.55:   So you h-,

B.56:   And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them.  

A.57:   All right that's what I was wondering about.  What, what you
use and, and --

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- in herbs and so forth.  

B.60:   Right, uh-huh.  Um, I like to just put a ((tablespoon)) or so
of Mrs Dash in there.  

A.61:   Uh-huh.  

B.62:   And it makes them pretty tasty.  

A.63:   Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans?  

B.64:   The Chinese type.  Are they the real,

A.65:   We use soy sauce,

B.66:   No, I haven't ever used that.  

A.67:   Well, you might, uh, be interested in that.  Have, it gives a
very delicious taste.  You, you have a soy sauce taste and you also
have a little cream sauce in there because you -- 

B.68:   Uh-huh.  

A.69:   -- you would use the, uh, water and, uh, [lipsmack] golly. 
What's this white powder that, that, uh, that you mix with water --

B.70:   A white powder. 

A.71:   -- and gives a thick sauce?  I can't even think of the name of
that right at the moment.  

B.72:   Um, gosh.  

A.73:   Anyhow [laughter], 

B.74:   [Laughter]. 

A.75:   sorry about my mind.  

B.76:   That's okay.  

A.77:   But, uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green
beans --

B.78:   Uh-huh.  

A.79:   --  and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few
onions in there with it.  If it does --

B.80:   Uh-huh.  

A.81:   -- it, it brings out such a, so much different things in, uh --

B.82:   Yeah.  

A.83:   -- in the string beans.  I, I like it to try them differently. 
I hardly ever cook them the same way twice.  

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   Just so I can enjoy them.  So you might, uh, think about that. 

B.86:   Yeah, I might try that.  

A.87:   Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to
them.  

B.88:   Oh, yes.  I love Chinese.  

A.89:   And, uh, north African cooking is good --

B.90:   North African?  

A.91:   -- when you use something called couscous.  

B.92:   Uh-huh.  

A.93:   And that's, uh, made from, uh, (( )) I think they call it,
beans.  And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with
it this couscous, uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put
in it where that makes a very delicious dish.  You probably have to
buy that from specialty stores.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  

A.95:   C o u s, c o u s.  And that's a, a north African dish.  They
eat it one to two meals everyday --

B.96:   Huh.   

A.97:   -- in north Africa.  And it is very very flexible.  You can do a
lot of things with it.  It makes a fantastic, uh, uh, salad with
cucumbers and,  

B.98:   [Throat_clearing].  

A.99:   olive oil and onions and,

B.100:   Uh-huh.  

@@A.101:  Oh, boy, real tasty.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, and
I hope I've --

B.102:   Well, I've enjoyed --

A.103:   -- given you some ideas --

B.104:   -- talking with you.  

A.105:   -- and, uh, that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food. 

B.106:   Oh, yes.  

A.107:   [Laughter] Well, thank you very much Miss Diane.  

B.108:   Okay, thank you.   

A.109:   Bye-bye.  

B.110:   Bye-bye.
