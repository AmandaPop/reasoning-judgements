A.1:  Do you or your husband work for T I, or

B.2:  I'm a contract person at T I --

A.3:  Oh, are you,

B.4:  -- in fact involved with, uh, Data Switchboard --

A.5:  Oh, I see.  Well, that's neat.

B.6:  -- and, uh, do you work for T I?

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now,
I guess.

B.10:  Oh, you sound very young --

A.11:  [Laughter] Right, I try to,

B.12:  -- [Laughter] like just out of college [laughter].

@A.13:  I try to think of myself as young, but, uh, well, have you
seen any movies recently?

B.14:  Uh, I'm trying to think, we saw, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES --

A.15:  Oh, did you?

B.16:  -- and, uh, have you seen that one?

A.17:  No, I haven't, I --

B.18:  That was excellent.

A.19:  -- have, have a hard time with movies that are real long.  I
don't know.

B.20:  Well, so oddly enough, I do too, I get tired of sitting
there, and --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- so does my husband, but we both just thoroughly, you
know --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- enjoyed it, just really liked it --

A.25:  Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.

B.26:  -- and, uh, I'm trying to think, we went to see a, uh, a real
funny one, I can't think now what the name of it was --

A.27:  Was it,

B.28:  -- I've gone blank.

A.29:  Uh, we, my wife and I went and saw a couple of funny ones. 
We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF --

B.30:  Oh, we have not seen that, we want to see that one.

A.31:  -- and that was, that was pretty funny, and then we saw, what
was the spoof on TOP GUN, it's --

B.32:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.

A.33:   -- oh, I can't think of what that was called.  We saw that
too, tha-, I was pretty disappointed in that one.

B.34:  Were you.

A.35:  [Printer] Yeah, but, uh, so, you know, through the summer, we
have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've
seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.

B.36:  My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them, he
likes to rent them --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- as they come out, and, uh,

A.41:  Have you seen GHOSTS yet?

B.42:  Yes, yes.

A.43:  I really, I enjoyed that movie,

B.44:  Did you?  Now I, I was real disappointed --

A.45:  Really.

B.46:  -- I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and, uh, I was really disappointed in it, it was-, one, I
don't think it was as funny as what I was an-, anticipating, and
I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny --

A.49:  Oh, yeah, well,

B.50:  -- and, uh, and it wasn't --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- you know, at all, it was, it was [/printer] more of a love
story --

A.53:  Yeah,

B.54:  -- and, uh, so I was really disappointed in that because I
like him --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- real well.  We just got through watching one with, uh, uh,
is it Claude Van Damme --

A.57:  Uh, Van Damme, yeah, I think,

B.58:  -- yeah, and, uh, enjoyed it, I can't think what the name of
it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- you know, kicking, fighting --

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  -- lots of blood [laughter] and guts and all that --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- [Laughter] type movie, and, and we enjoyed that, and, uh,
the, uh, uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?

A.65:  Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?

B.66:  Yes.

A.67:  Yes, I did.

B.68:  Wasn't that excellent?

A.69:  Yeah, I really enjoyed that a lot.

B.70:  Yeah, that was one that, that stayed with me --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- you know, for a month, I just, I kept thinking about it,
you know,

A.73:  Yeah, well, it's amazing, but really, I mean, when you stop
and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role
in the movie --

B.74:  No.

A.75:  -- and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,

B.76:  Oh, it was excellent, and, and, of course, he's such a, uh,
very good actor anyway --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- and, I think he made the movie,

A.79:  Yeah, I do too, I really did --

B.80:  Yeah,

A.81:  -- you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think
Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie, I
agree with you.

B.82:  Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?

A.83:  Oh, Hopkins, I'm sorry --

B.84:  Hopkins, uh-huh.

A.85:  -- Hopkins, yeah.  I always get those --

B.86:  I know --

A.87:  -- (( )) mixed up.

B.88:  -- I know.  It, uh, well, I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,
but I thought she was good in that.

A.89:  Well, I agr-, well, I haven't been, I'm, I saw her in THE
KEYS, and I thought that was a pretty good movie, but I thought
she,

B.90:  Now, I didn't see that one.

A.91:  That was, that was pretty interesting movie, and, uh, but,
you know, I, I did, I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, that
was really intriguing, and it, it didn't scare me all that much,
you know, and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,
that's not why I go --

B.92:  No, no --

A.93:  -- so,

B.94:  -- I like a good suspenseful --

A.95:  Right, and that one was.

B.96:  -- story, and that one very definitely kept you on the edge
of the seats, in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out
for my husband to see, because, he didn't --

A.97:  Oh, he didn't see it?

B.98:  -- he won't go see that, no, --

A.99:  Oh.

B.100:  -- I went with, uh, our daughter --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- and, uh, so, you know, saw it with her, and, uh, enjoyed
it.  My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.  

A.103:  Oh, really?

B.104:  Did you see it?

A.105:  Yeah, I've seen it.

B.106:  Oh, I've seen it, you know, we saw it at the movies, and then
we've rented it several times --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- and, we just love it, in fact we have a ten year old
grandson that, he and my husband and I, we just sit there and
cackle --

A.109:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I've seen that.  

B.110:  -- [Laughter] you know, just get hysterical.

A.111:  It's pretty, it's pretty cute.  I guess, you know, as far as
comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.

B.112:  Uh, yes, yes,

A.113:  I love that movie,

B.114:  My husband liked that --

A.115:  Yeah, so,

B.116:  -- uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan,

A.117:  Yeah, well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me, but I'm
a big, uh, Mel Brooks fan --

B.118:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.119:  -- all his movies, I really, really (( )).

B.120:  He has a new one out.

A.121:  He does?

B.122:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Uh, I have seen it advertised. I don't know
what the name of it is.

A.123:  Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in?

B.124:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.125:  Oh, yeah, that came out, like early in the summer or
something like that.

B.126:  Yes, yes.

A.127:  Yeah, I haven't seen that one either.

B.128:  Yeah, my husband wants to see that one, and, uh, did you see
that one that he made years and years ago about the, uh, the
sheriff --

A.129:  Oh, BLAZING SADDLES.

B.130:  -- BLAZING SADDLES.

A.131:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.132:  Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.

A.133:  Oh, uh-huh.  I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG
FRANKENSTEIN was better.

B.134:  Did you?

A.135:  Yeah, that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things
throughout the whole movie, 

B.136:  [Laughter].  

A.137:  I just really enjoyed it, and, uh, um, I'm trying to
think, because we saw another one that we thought was really
good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.  I'm
trying to remember what it was, because it, you know, it's,
