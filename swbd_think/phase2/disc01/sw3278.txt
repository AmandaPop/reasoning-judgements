REMARKS:        Both speakers got off of the subject in the middle
of the conversation and then back on it again.  It sounded like
Speaker A had people talking on and off in the background, and
Speaker B sounded like he had the radio or television on.

========================================================================

B.1:   Well, let's see.  We're supposed to talk about movies.  

@A.2:  Yes.  Have you seen any recently or, 

B.3:   I don't, uh, I'm trying just to think.  I have not gone out to
a movie.  We rent a few, but I haven't rente-, rented one real
lately.  So you name a few that you've seen and see if I've seen
them.  

A.4:   {Very faint} Okay.  Um, we just went out to one about a
couple weeks ago.  It was NECESSARY ROUGHNESS --

B.5:   I have not seen it.  

A.6:   -- the one that was filmed in Denton.  

B.7:   I have not seen it, but I've heard a little bit about it.  

A.8:   Yeah, it, it was pretty good but I, I don't know if, if you
saw this and you weren't in Dallas or around Texas, if you'd
understand some of it.  

B.9:   Oh, is that right?  

A.10:   Yeah.  So I don't know if it would be good if you were outside
of Texas.  But,

B.11:   Well, I, I was just reading about it though and it's, uh, it's
been a sleeper hit.  It's already grossed like forty million
dollars.  

A.12:   Oh, really?  

B.13:   So it's, it's actually becoming a pretty good hit across the
United States.  

A.14:   Well, that's good.  I-, i-,

B.15:   So they are liking it.  

A.16:   Yeah, that's good.  

B.17:   And, uh --

A.18:   Um, let's see.  

B.19:   -- it's just, I think, just a silly entertaining movi-, movie
from what the articles I've read about it.  

A.20:   Yeah, that's what it is.  

B.21:   Which, you know, you go just to be entertained and --

A.22:   Uh-huh.   

B.23:   -- and people are liking it for that.  

A.24:   Yeah, and, and that's good.  Oh, and that's pretty much what
it was about it was just, uh, you know, a, a comedy.  

B.25:   Uh-huh.  

A.26:   You know, just a, a football team that was bad and come up --

B.27:   Uh-huh.  

A.28:   -- you know.  

B.29:   Yeah.  

A.30:   And, uh, we just moved here from South Dakota.  

B.31:   Did you?  

A.32:   And, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed up there when we were
there. 

B.33:   Right.  

A.34:   {Very faint} Uh-huh.  And we saw that where they f-, they
filmed it in Pierre, South Dakota and that's where we went to see
it.  

B.35:   Oh, oh, you went out and watched them film?  

A.36:   Um, yeah, they, the buffalo and all that an the ranch.  Um, my
father-in-law owns a plane and he, um, took us to the buffalo ranch
and -- 

B.37:   Uh-huh.  

A.38:   -- where they, you know, use the buffalo to film and -- 

B.39:   Uh-huh.  

A.40:   -- and, uh, took us out there, and you never knew that there
was so much land that was not developed --

B.41:   I bet that's true.   

A.42:   -- you know, until you go, you know, and see that.

B.43:   A lot of wide open spaces out there.  

A.44:   Yes.  But, um,

B.45:   I've never been up that direction.  I'd like to.  

A.46:   Yeah, it's nice.  

B.47:   The main thing I think about is that it gets so cold in the
winter up there.  

A.48:   It is.  It's like thirty now.  

B.49:   Wow.  

A.50:   You know it's between thirty and forty and we, we've just
moved here and we call people back there and they just can't
believe that we're still wearing shorts, 

B.51:   [Laughter]. 

A.52:   and going out and [laughter], 

B.53:   And, and will occasionally up until Thanksgiving probably.  

A.54:   D-, is that when it starts changing?   

B.55:   Well, we'll, we'll have some cold days, you know --

A.56:   Uh-huh.  

B.57:   -- like, uh, in, in, uh, October and September, you know, we had
some pretty cold nights.  

A.58:   Uh-huh.  

B.59:   But, uh, but, uh, up until Thanksgiving really, uh, well, we
usually get our first frost middle of November.  

A.60:   Okay.  

B.61:   Somewhere,

A.62:   Yeah, they've had two already.  Two freezes.  

B.63:   Uh-huh.  

A.64:   So.   

B.65:   ((Do you have them ta-,)),

A.66:   And so, and that was a really good movie and it lasted three
hours.  

B.67:   Three hours.  

A.68:   {Very faint} Yeah.

B.69:   That's the only complaint I've heard about that it's so long. 

A.70:   It-, it's really long but I don't kno-, it didn't feel like it
was that long.  

B.71:   Uh-huh.  

A.72:   But after you got out and thought --

B.73:   Passes fast, huh?  

A.74:   -- oh, wow [laughter].  

B.75:   Jeez.

A.76:   It was longer but, um, Kevin Costner was really good in that. 

B.77:   Oh, I like him.  

A.78:   Oh, I think he's great.  

B.79:   Everything I've seen him in I've liked real well.  

A.80:   Uh-huh.  He's, you know, done, uh, I can't remember now but
the baseball show.  Um, 

B.81:   Yeah, uh, FIELD OF DREAMS.  

A.82:   Yes, FIELD OF DREAMS.  

B.83:   Yeah.  That was good.  I saw that.  

A.84:   And have you seen ROBIN HOOD with him in it or,  

B.85:   No, I haven't.  

A.86:   I haven't either and I've heard that was just great.  

B.87:   I bet it i-, it is.  

A.88:   Uh-huh.  

B.89:   Uh, I've not even, I don't think I've even read a, I usually
read the, uh, critics in, uh, TIME and PEOPLE.  

A.90:   Uh-huh.  

B.91:   And I pretty well agree with their thinking on most movies.  

A.92:   Uh-huh.  

B.93:   And, uh, but I, I don't believe I've read one about ROBIN HOOD
yet.  It's already, it's just released, isn't it?  

A.94:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's probably been out for, you know, like a
month now.  

B.95:   Yeah.  

A.96:   Yeah.  

B.97:   Maybe that's why.  They'll get to it shortly.  

A.98:   Yeah.  

B.99:   But, uh, is it on the video yet?  

A.100:   Um, no.  Huh-uh.  I don't think it's out on video yet.  I
still think it's at the theaters.  

B.101:   Uh-huh.  

A.102:   But, um,

B.103:   I need to get that DANCES WITH WOLVES.  I would sort of like
it.  At first I thought, uh, I don't know, you know. 

A.104:   Uh-huh.  

B.105:   I'm -- 

A.106:   Well,

B.107:   -- tired of having these Indians everybody pushed down our
throats how we mistreated them so and all that.

A.108:   Oh, and see that's how we've, you know, we come out of it
going --

B.109:   I'm sick of all that.  

A.110:   -- yeah, we come out of it going, you know, it's, it's hard, you
know, for us, you know, it was a good movie.  It interpreted what
happened then.  

B.111:   Uh-huh.  

A.112:   But it brought out a lot that isn't going on now --

B.113:   Right.  

A.114:   -- that they again felt that they were, you know, being so
mistreated and, and,

B.115:   Pushing a little too far, yeah.

A.116:   Yes.  

B.117:   Yeah, that's --

A.118:   And it was not what we mean now, you know.  

B.119:   -- that's the very reason I have not even rented it from the
video.  I --

A.120:   Uh-huh.

B.121:   -- I, ever-, every one that I talked to said, yes, you'll love
it, you'll love it, and I'm sure I will.  

A.122:   Uh-huh.  

B.123:   But, uh, and I'm sure I'll see it before too long.  

A.124:   {Very faint} Yeah, because that's quite a deal, you know,
being up in there --

B.125:   I bet it is.  

A.126:   -- in South Dakota where we have to pay the government funds to
them --

B.127:   Uh-huh.  

A.128:   -- and keep the tribes going --

B.129:   Uh-huh.  

A.130:   -- and, and you know, it, it hurts me because, you know, I have
to keep paying this but yet I don't feel that I did anything to
them.  

B.131:   That's true.  

A.132:   But, you know, we have to keep doing this and --

B.133:   That's true.  

A.134:   -- you know.  

B.135:   You know, uh, just because our ancestors did certain things --

A.136:   Right.  

B.137:   -- they did it, I think, as a matter of survival and not to
be --

A.138:   Uh-huh, and how they lived m-,

B.139:   -- ((brutish)) to un-, to some other people --

A.140:   Right.  

B.141:   -- you know.  

A.142:   And, and how they lived is very different from what we try to
do now and --

B.143:   Yeah.  

A.144:   -- and I feel that we're not working with territory or things
like that now --

B.145:   Uh-huh.  

A.146:   -- that were overpowering somebody's territory -- 

B.147:   Uh-huh.   

A.148:   -- or something like that now.  

B.149:   Yes.  

A.150:   But, but, um, you know, I've, I've seen a lot of Julia Roberts
movies.  

B.151:   I like Julia.  

A.152:   I do too [laughter].

B.153:   I like her.  I, uh, I'm trying to think what, my favorite with
her was, uh, oh, what is it,
