=======================================================================

@A.1:   Okay, do you subscribe to magazines yourself?  

B.2:   I don't, uh, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we
get so many at work that, uh, I need to read that, uh, I just don't
take any at home.  

A.3:   Oh, I see.  I get, uh, MCCALL'S.  Of course, anything that
appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.  

B.4:   Uh-huh.  

A.5:   And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or
something and -- 

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   -- realize why I don't want to re-, go back to work
[laughter].  

B.8:   [Laughter].

A.9:   What I enjoy about staying home.  

B.10:   Right.  

A.11:   And, uh, I read magazines mainly because they're fast and if
I want to relax while I watch T V, [beep] of course, I'm
one of those that does two things at once, and, uh, I read GOOD
HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S.  And I like them
because they're kind of short and to the subject.  

B.12:   Right.  I u-, I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING
and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at
home.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  And then you stopped them all.  

B.14:   But, yeah, the subscriptions ran out and I never renewed them. 
And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to
read them.  

A.15:   I find that, uh, about two years is probably my max -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- on subscribing to one in particular and then I kind of get
turned off by it.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.

A.19:   Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.  GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one
that kind of sets around for when, uh, when I'm really have time
and I really want to read something, you know.  

B.20:   Uh-huh.

A.21:   I don't get into books too often because I have so many things
that I stay occupied with -- 

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   -- uh, on a general basis, and we travel a lot so I enjoy
reading parts on travel in the various --

B.24:   Uh-huh.

A.25:   -- you know, different ones.  

B.26:   Right.  

A.27:   And I get into, uh, newspapers, so I guess that kind of tells
you what kind of person I am.  I'm, re-, read it fast and put it
down [laughter].  

B.28:   Right.  Uh-huh.  When, when I had my magazines at home, I
would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the
pictures, you know, and -- 

A.29:   Right.  

B.30:   -- if something caught my eye, then I might read something,
but otherwise than that, you know, they were, [breathing] uh,
you know, not too useful to me.  You know -- 

A.31:   Well,  

B.32:   -- I got some good recipes from them sometimes, but 
[laughter],

A.33:   That's what I do.  You clip recipes and you save them forever
and you never really --

B.34:   Uh-huh.

A.35:   -- [Laughter] use them. 

B.36:   That's right, that's right.  

A.37:   And then every so often you weed through them and you think,
where did I ever put that recipe.  

B.38:   Right.  

A.39:   But, uh, that's mainly my, uh, whole idea on -- 

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   -- you know, short subject, uh, reading and things like this. 
I, I subscribe, like I said, to a few and once in a while I buy
that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands -- 

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   -- or something like that.  But I kind of stay with my own
subject matter what, uh, pertains to my daily life -- 

B.44:   Right.  

A.45:   -- at the present time.  

B.46:   [Throat_clearing] Well, since I work with computers during my
work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and
software and everything.  And I have to read the magazines, you
know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of
these, [breathing], uh, magazines such as that, so I really,
[breathing] you know, just, {pause} I can see that it will be a
very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at
home.  

A.47:   Right.  Well, sometimes, if, you know, if you're in
transportation, in public transportation -- 

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   -- I know that people will read them on something like that. 

B.50:   Right.  

A.51:   But I think, and the idea is to, is and good, I can just dump
them at the other end [laughter], and I don't have to carry them
back with me.  

B.52:   That's right.  

A.53:   I do that when we travel.  I always have my head with a
magazine somewhere as we -- 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   -- drive or wherever we, no matter what it is, air travel or
anything and I,

B.56:   Uh-huh.  Right.  If I, if I go on an airplane ride or
something, I'll stop in and pick up a, you know, a COSMOPOLITAN or
something -- 

A.57:   Right, al-, although now, 

B.58:   -- to read on the airplane.  But, uh, you know, that's
basically just about [breathing], I'll buy a crossword puzzle
magazine every now and then [laughter].  

A.59:   [Laughter] That's when you really have time.  Now see your
computer ones, I got into computer work somewhat, uh, we have our
own computer system at home -- 

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- and I tried, uh, reading the magazines hoping I would get
more from it and it was just above my head without having someone
there to give me the advice as I went along.  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   It was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what I
needed, so I never did get into them.  I [breathing], when I
bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some
unknown reason, through the mail.  I think they all that-, thought,
well, we have a live one [laughter].  She'll subscribe [laughter].  

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   But they were wrong.  I never got into them.  But, but,  

B.66:   Right.  

A.67:   Okay?  All right, I guess we might as well end our
conversation at this point.  

B.68:   Okay.  

A.69:   It was nice talking with you.  

B.70:   It was nice to talk with you, too.  

A.71:   Okay.  

B.72:   Thank you.  

A.73:   Uh-huh.  Bye, now.  

B.74:   Bye-bye.
