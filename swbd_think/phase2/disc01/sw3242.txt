======================================================================

A.1:  Well, how did you like that topic?

B.2:  Uh, I don't know, I've got mixed feelings about the topic.

@A.3:  Do you?  I don't.

B.4:  No. Okay.

A.5:  No, I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well
know.  I agree with it.  I think, uh, I think a company should be able to test
at, any, any employee any time they see fit.

B.6:  Well,

A.7:  I just, I just don't think there's a place in our environment, you know in
the work force for drugs, or alcohol either.

B.8:  Well, I don't believe in drugs or alcohol, but if you'll remember when the
teachers had to take the T CAT --

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  -- they were talking about drug testing us --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove
we could read and write with a specimen of urine --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and we found it belittling.

A.15:  You did?

B.16:  Yeah,

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Well, I can sort of understand that, uh, but not being a teacher,
as you are, you know, I, I was not quite as sympathetic as, you know, as I
probably would have been if, if Kay were a teacher or something.

B.18:  That's true.

A.19:  But, uh,

B.20:  But then, you know, at the same token, I'm not against because I look at
airline pilots --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- bus drivers --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- you know, people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands --

A.25:  That's right.

B.26:  -- truck drivers --

A.27:  That's right.

B.28:  -- it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs --

A.29:  Uh, that's right --

B.30:  -- and alcohol,

A.31:  -- and I think it is a big problem with them using drugs --

B.32:  And,

A.33:  -- from what you read, you know, but, uh,

B.34:  You know, in those areas I really, you know, do believe that maybe we
should clean up our, you know --

A.35:  Yeah, I think so --

B.36:  -- house.

A.37:  -- too, I, I agree with it.  Uh, I know Kay's company, you know, they
started it couple of years ago, and so many of the people, even the
professional people were, boy, they were so against them doing that, you know,
and I thought, Jeez, to me it's quite simple, uh, you either need a job or you
don't.  The, the job is what provides all of your needs, and, uh, if they say,
Hey, you can't do this work, I'd say, Hey, I agree, I don't, I won't do that.
And I think most of them have agreed to that now, although they didn't like it
at first.

B.38:  Yeah, I think it's just like anything else, a new concept, you know, as I
said, if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted,

A.39:  Yeah, it is, I can see where you would think, Yeah, that is belittling, you
know, I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that.

B.40:  But at the same token, in education we can't do drug, random drug testing
on kids --

A.41:  Yeah, that's true,

B.42:  -- you know, I mean, their rights are protected.

A.43:  You bet.  Oh, gosh, they, they would really raise a stink if that was to --

B.44:  What --

A.45:  -- happen.

B.46:  -- well, but why, if you're going to do teachers or professionals, why not
do the kids, 

A.47:  [Breathing].

B.48:  when we see them and they're, you know, under the influence.

A.49:  Right, yes, I agree with that.  I, I, I wouldn't be opposed to it at all,
it's just our bleeding heart [inhaling] liberals that would fight it to-,
tooth and nail, you know --

B.50:  That's true.

A.51:  -- but, uh, well, Lynn, I've enjoyed talking with you.  I don't know how
long we're supposed to carry on a conversation, do you?

B.52:  It's three minutes, and the clicker comes in when it's time to,

A.53:  Oh, well, we'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Have you heard it?

B.56:  No.

A.57:  Anyway, we both sort of agree on it, don't we --

B.58:  Well --

A.59:  -- about random testing.

B.60:  -- do we agree, or unless it's not me [laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter]  Well, listen,

B.62:  You know, here we go again, I mean --

A.63:  Yeah, yeah.

B.64:  -- yeah, you know --

A.65:  If you agree that, uh,

B.66:  -- I believe that truck drivers and people that have, even though teachers
have other kids lives in their hands, and if they come in stoned or they come
in drunk --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- and there was an incident in my children's high school, where a teacher
stayed drunk,

A.69:  Is that right?

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  You just don't think of that happening with teachers --

B.72:  And he,

A.73:  -- I really don't, when I think of drug testing, I'm thinking of the, you
know, outside of education.

B.74:  Uh, well, no, you know, we are as susceptible a society --

A.75:  Sure -- 

B.76:  -- as anybody else --

A.77:  -- sure, I know that, but, uh --

B.78:  -- and, uh --

A.79:  -- you don't think of that first hand, normally.

B.80:  -- Yeah, well, did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was
up for child molestation. 

A.81:  Isn't that, 

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

A.83:  isn't that --

B.84:  It was on the news tonight.

A.85:  -- mind boggling, goodness, it, it is, it's mind bog-, you know, well, you
know, I agree with you, I know teachers are just like everybody else, same
problems --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- the same, uh, good qualities as anybody else.

B.88:  Then, I think, you know, if if it came, push came to shove, I'd probably be
drug tested --

A.89:  Yeah, yeah.

B.90:  -- you know, because it does, you know,

A.91:  You, you think the benefit would be greater than the,

B.92:  Yeah, because, you know, as I say, I'm sitting there fussing and fussing,
and yet, I know of, you know, one teacher who was an alcoholic --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- in school as well as, you know, I presume out,

A.95:  And that was in your children's high school,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  Isn't that amazing,

B.98:  And, you know, my children brought it to my attention.  I never --

A.99:  If it, if it's --

B.100:  -- was there to see it.

A.101:  -- if it was true there, I'm sure it's true with just about probably to
some degree every school there is --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- you know, because they represent a pretty good,

B.104:  And that's not giving a good example to students.

A.105:  No, certainly not, certainly not, they don't need that example but,
