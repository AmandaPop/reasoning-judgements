A.1:  Okay, my name is Karen. 

B.2:  Okay, my name is Terry.

@A.3:  Okay, and this, uh, they said about magazines.  We, I've probably
personally take I think just two --

B.4:  Okay.

A.5:  --  but that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they
print and gives them to me,

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  a month later [laughter], so.  So I get all of them.  Uh,
the one that I really especially enjoy, and you may be familiar
with it from Wisconsin, is called COUNTRY.

B.8:  Oh, yes, uh, there's COUNTRY LIVING, there's COUNTRY, and,
uh,

A.9:  Well, this, yeah, this one is the one they have all the
pictures of scenery from places we wished we live, like --

B.10:  Oh, yeah.

A.11:  -- Wisconsin [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains
and things.

B.14:  Sure.

A.15:  And I get that, it has recipes in it, and that's my very
favorite.

B.16:  Oh, that's great.

A.17:  What do you take?

B.18:  Well, I actually take COUNTRY LIVING, it's a --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- country magazine on HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, because I like, um --

A.21:  Yeah, decorating.

B.22:  -- that kind of stuff.  Decorating --

A.23:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and, uh, getting ideas for a garden.  In fact, uh, right
before you called, I was planning my tulips --

A.25:  Are you?

B.26:  -- and, uh, putting them on blue print on where I'm going to
put them, so --

A.27:  Oh.

B.28:  -- I'm really into that, but, uh, so, I really get into
magazines that are kind of basically into, um, housing type
things, where the, be --

A.29:  And decorating and how to do things.

B.30:  -- decorating and gardening --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and recipes, that kind of stuff.  So I'm pretty much in
the same category as what --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- you're looking at.  

A.35:  Well, we, we tried for a while to take a news magazine.  We
took NEWSWEEK --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and I think we took it especially just during the war to
kind of catch up on everything and --

B.38:  Sure.

A.39:  -- have it be digested.  But we've kind of discontinued that
right now  --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- and we've, we're going to start taking that, uh, U S NEWS,
uh, newspaper.  U S A TODAY, I think it.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah, I've had TIME before.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  I think with that what happens --

A.45:  [Throat_clearing].

B.46:  -- is, uh, it's interesting to read --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never
read it again --

A.49:  That's right.

B.50:  -- unless there's some big article in there that you're going
to keep for your kids, but,

A.51:  That's exactly right.  I did the same thing.  We saved the
ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and one
from the earthquake.

B.52:  Yeah, exactly --

A.53:  [Cough]  And then --

B.54:  -- it sounds exactly like what we did --

A.55:  -- [Cough] and,

B.56:  -- we just saved everything we could --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- for our daughter but, uh --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- that's pretty similar, but I find that with these COUNTRY
magazines, I keep going back to them, getting ideas, looking back
and saying, Jeez, there was a flower garden in there that I
(( )),

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  that I would like to have some ideas, you know --

A.63:  Well, you sound like you,

B.64:  -- I get a lot of ideas from them.

A.65:  That's the thing, you sound like you have the facilities to
do that.

B.66:  Yes, we do.  We're out in the country --

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  -- we're right across from a river, and uh, you're right, the
leaves are beautiful, and they are falling now, so.

A.69:  Oh.

B.70:  Uh, it just peaked, uh, last week, and it was just gorgeous
out here, but.

A.71:  I bet it is gorgeous.

B.72:  Yeah, it's beautiful.  The other thing about magazines, the
only thing I don't like, is they really get heavily into
advertising --

A.73:  I agree,

B.74:  -- and, 

A.75:  [Gasp].

B.76:  you know, it's, it's, it's fine, I'd rather almost have --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- I know that part, probably half their money comes from
these people that are saying, uh, Put my ad in your paper --

A.79:  Yeah, right.

B.80:  -- and I'll pay you or whatever, but, uh, there's been some
magazines I've looked at, and it's a real turn off to see
every --

A.81:  Every page.

B.82:  -- other page,

A.83:  I #do the same thing,#

B.84:  #some kind of ad,#

A.85:  I, I think I opened VOGUE the other day or something --

B.86:  Yeah, VOGUE is,

A.87:  -- # and it was just nothing, uh-huh.#

B.88:  #heavily into that.#

A.89:  And I thought, Why buy this?

B.90:  Yeah, exactly, it's almost --

A.91:  You know, what's the point?

B.92:  -- I mean, you could go into a store and get bombarded --

A.93:  That's right.

B.94:  -- the same way, but, uh.

A.95:  And my number one pet peeve in a magazine, is when they put
the perfume in it --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- because, uh, real often, I don't like very heavy
perfumes --

B.98:  Yeah, exactly.

A.99:  -- and very often, like, you know, in my bills, also,
magazines and bills, and they'll, 

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  come out just stinking [laughter], the whole thing.

B.102:  [Laughter] Exactly, yeah, they're really getting into that
so,

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  But pretty much like I said, the magazines I've had,
BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN, and now I need a switch, and I'm going
back to GOURMET COOKING,  because, um, I've had --

A.105:  Oh.

B.106:  -- the magazine before, back in nineteen, uh, eighty-six, and
I thought, Well, I'll give it a try again, because you get tired
of one magazine, and you need to try a --

A.107:  I understand.

B.108:  -- change.

A.109:  Well, do you (( )), do you tear out of your magazines, your
recipes or do you keep it?

B.110:  Uh, yes, I do, and sometimes, most of the time --

A.111:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.112:  -- I tear them out.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  A lot of times, if, uh, you know, if I got a chance to sit
down at my typewriter, I'll go ahead and type out recipes, but --

A.115:  Type it out, uh-huh.

B.116:  -- what I usually do is I'll try it out in the magazine
first, and, without tearing it out, and then give it a,

A.117:  See how the family liked it [child_talking].

B.118:  Yeah, and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe
collection, but, uh.

A.119:  Oh, that's a good idea.  Well, I'm going to pay attention
more when I'm in the store to that COUNTRY LIVING, I remember --

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  -- seeing the cover.  Back when I decorated the house with a
lot of the little country, uh, primitive things, the little, the
little pigs and the jeez, and the --

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  -- ducks, and that, we had, that was the big rage here,
couple of years ago.  And I bought a lot of the country
magazines --

B.124:  Sure, sure.

A.125:  -- and then it seems like when I put some of that away, I quit
buying it, but I had forgotten the recipes --

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  -- and I'm going to, I'll have to check that out,

B.128:  Yeah, it, it, that's what I, I just went through, uh --

A.129:  [Throat_clearing].

B.130:  -- we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin.  

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  I went through all this, I had this huge stack of HOUSE
BEAUTIFUL --

A.133:  [Laughter].

B.134:  -- I had COLONIAL TIMES, I had GOURMET --

A.135:  And you don't want to part with any of them because
there's --

B.136:  -- yeah.

A.137:  -- one thing in each one [laughter].

B.138:  It was hard, but I ended up, uh, reducing them down to like
fifteen magazines out of, uh --

A.139:  Oh, that's good.

B.140:  -- hundreds.  And I just said, Okay, there's one picture in
there that, it really doesn't, you know --

A.141:  Uh-huh. 

B.142:  -- it's got to have more than that --

A.143:  right.

B.144:  -- it's got to have some good ideas --

A.145:  Right.

B.146:  -- it's got to have everything.  So I just kind of went
through, and I find that most of the magazines I really like is
around Christmas time because,

A.147:  I, I know,
