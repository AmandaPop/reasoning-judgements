=====================================================================

B.1:   How are you doing?  

A.2:   Well, good.  

B.3:   Oh, okay.  Well, 

A.4:   Doing great.  I had a while to think about it so why don't I
start and you can chip in when you feel like it [laughter].

B.5:   Go right ahead.  

@A.6:  Uh, when we were first married we didn't think we needed a
budget, and, and I think it was fine with the two of us.  We just
kind of spent as we wanted.  And seemed like we got paid off enough
that it would cover [laughter]. 

B.7:   [Laughter] Now, now how long ago was it that you got married? 

A.8:   Oh, it's been about nine years, so.

B.9:   Nine years, okay.  

A.10:   Then when we actually got out of school and employed and
[laughter] we only started getting paid once a month, and we found
that you really had to budget [laughter] things or by the last week
or two you were broke, so.  

B.11:   [Laughter]. 

A.12:   That's probably when we started budgeting and ever since we
just, you know. 

B.13:   What kind of a budget do you have?  

A.14:   Oh, I don't know [laughter]. 

B.15:   No, I mean, I mean, how d-, how do you keep, do you actually
look to see what you have spent each month or do you plan on what
you're going to spend for the month or I mean how do you do your
budget?  

A.16:   [Throat_clearing] I probably plan what we're going to spend
each month.  I mean we get paid and I deduct all that we're going
to, you know all the bills at first, and then I set aside so much
for utilities that we need and so much for this and --

B.17:   Okay.  

A.18:   -- then we have a certain amount each week to work with for
groceries.  And, and lots of times I go over that amount but
[laughter],  

B.19:   Well, see, now for myself, I'm a C P A.  

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   So needless to say my budget is probably, 

A.22:   [Laughter]. 

B.23:   extremely well fine tuned.  Uh, I've been married now for
nineteen years -- 

A.24:   Uh-huh.  

B.25:   -- and every month since the day that I was married, I have
had a budget.  I take all the checks that I write and all the
deposits I make and I put into my computer, and it spits out a
beautiful financial statement.  And from the financial statement I
can see each month exactly what I have spent to see what I have
made and see if there's any profit of leftovers.  So I can tell if
on a month by month basis if I'm spending too much, and if I am, I
just simply go to the wife and say, okay [laughter],  

A.26:   [Laughter]. 

B.27:   time to cut it off, you know. 

A.28:   This is how much you spent on this.  You'd better not do it
anymore [laughter]. 

B.29:   Well, uh, ((it's just)) you know, our budget's so much and you
can just, you can look at it and you can see, hey, that on clothing
we have spent on this particular month so much more than the
average. 

A.30:   Right.

B.31:   I mean it was just way out of proportion.  

A.32:   And that's usually about schooltime [laughter]. 

B.33:   [Laughter] For us ((it)) always seems to be Christmas time
and, 

A.34:   Oh, yeah.  

B.35:   Yeah, Christmas and summer.  

A.36:   Yeah.  

B.37:   Uh, so I have these financial statements and I look at them
month by month by month, and I can tell you to the penny how much
we have spent in groceries, how much we spend in utilities, how
much we spend on entertainment, vacations, c-, --

A.38:   That's great.  

B.39:   -- car expenses, whatnot.  And we know what we should be
spending.  And, uh, now for my wife, she's a schoolteacher.

A.40:   Uh-huh.

B.41:   Her income is fixed.  

A.42:   Right.   

B.43:   For, for myself I own my own C P A practice so we have a, uh,
uh, a floating, you know, my income --

A.44:   Right.

B.45:   -- is not fixed.  It can go up, it can go down.  But if you've
got the generalities, you know what it's, about it's going to be. 

A.46:   Yeah.  

B.47:   And so what we look at is to see (( )), now I do not plan in
advance.  I can not tell you what we're going to be spending money
on in the month of November.  

A.48:   Uh-huh.  

B.49:   I, I don't know.  But I can tell you what we did spend in
September and as I see that ((I think that's)) okay.  Here we are
in October, uh, so then, you know, we're, we're a little bit short
this, you know, last month we, we spent way too much and we need to
hold back.  Let's not spend anything this month or next month.  

A.50:   Yeah.  

B.51:   So that's how I do my budget.  

A.52:   Yeah.  

B.53:   Um,

A.54:   That's great.  I, I break mine down quite a bit.  I keep
what's called a non balanced checkbook, but I put all, like, fifty
dollars away for clothes for the month or fifty dollars for savings
bonds.  And, you know, and then when I feel like it, I deduct that
or [laughter] but it's kind of a different way to do it.  But,

B.55:   There was a time when I remember I always wanted to put fifty
dollars into my savings account but now it shouldn't matter.  I
want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that I have, you know. 

A.56:   [Laughter] Yeah.

B.57:   But, uh, I, I, I will not allow myself to have a credit card
that I,  

A.58:   We do and that,

B.59:   Now, I, I do have a credit card --

A.60:   Uh-huh.   

B.61:   -- but I don't ever pay or have a balance of more than I can, uh,
payoff.  

A.62:   No.  We don't either.  We never, we use it to float mainly.  

B.63:   Yes.  I use it to float extremely.  

A.64:   Especially on big purchases there around Christmas and, 

B.65:   Yes.  I, I enjoy that forty-five day float very, very much.  

A.66:   Yes [laughter]. 

B.67:   But, uh, I, I have not paid an interest, a penny of interest
in the last ten years.  

A.68:   {Very faint} Yeah.  We, I bet we haven't for two or three
years or, you know, once in a while you, you have something come up
that is more than you can handle or, or you thought you could
handle and you have to leave a little balance.  We haven't for ages
either.    

B.69:   Curiosity, only because I'm a C P A.  Uh, how do you budget
for the April fifteenth, or do you all always have a refund or,  

A.70:   So far we've always had refunds.  We, you know, have, we have
three children and that seems to really help, and we probably don't
make enough right now [laughter]. 

B.71:   [Laughter]. 

A.72:   So, [laughter] but [throat_clearing],

B.73:   Yeah.  I assume that you own a house?

A.74:   Yes.  

B.75:   Well, good.  

A.76:   I think if we did see that we were starting,
