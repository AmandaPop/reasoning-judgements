@A.1:  How would you go about organizing a family reunion?  

B.2:  Well, a-, for, I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.  So whenever
I think of family reunions, my family, like, got together almost every week.

A.3:  Oh, gee.  

B.4:  And there would be like thirty people.  So people talk about, you know, big
family reunions and I think, like I have a friend who just went to, like,
Wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred

A.5:  Oh, my.

bring things and --

A.13:  Oh.  

B.14:  -- my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.  And i-,

A.15:  Well, I come from a very small family.  And we planned a family reunion
this spring.  Uh, where we are from Texas and my family is from Ohio and we
met in Florida.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.  So
that's all the family, so planning our family reunio-, reunion was very easy
[laughter], ((you know)).

B.18:  Yeah, I guess so.  It really sounds like it was fun.  

A.19:  Yeah, well, we had a wonderful tim-,
