==========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, what kind of fishing do you do?  

B.2:   Well, mostly, uh, a, a little fresh water fish, but mostly
lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in
Utah.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   But, uh, down here I haven't fished much in Texas.  

A.5:   That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow
trout.  

B.6:   Oh, they're really not, I think they're good to eat.  

A.7:   What, what kind of bait do you use to catch them?  

B.8:   Oh, just, usually worms, night crawlers.  Sometimes fish 
eggs.  

A.9:   Oh, really?  

B.10:   Sometimes {faint}.

A.11:   Fish eggs?  

B.12:   Yeah.  

A.13:   Oh, I didn't know that.  Huh. 

B.14:   Just little, just little fish eggs.  

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   And, uh, [lipsmack] there's this one kind of cheese that
you can put on the end of a hook and it will stay relatively well
[breathing].  

A.17:   Oh, I didn't know that.  

B.18:   Yeah -- 

A.19:   That's a great way.  

B.20:   -- and, and they really like that.  

A.21:   I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,
also.  

B.22:   Now I have never caught catfish.  

A.23:   Oh, look, catfish, uh, personally I like to catch large mouth
bass -- 

B.24:   Uh-huh.  

A.25:   -- and catfish because they fight the best [laughter].  

B.26:   Because [breathing] they fight the best {mumbling}
[laughter]. 

A.27:   But a, [laughter] a catfish will really just tear into
anything like that, like liver -- 

B.28:   Oh, is that right?  

A.29:   -- or, uh, cheese or anything that smells terrible [laughter].  

B.30:   Now in Amarillo did you fish any ((of this))?  

A.31:   Uh, no.  Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in
Oklahoma --

B.32:   Um.

A.33:   -- and they have the, uh, Lake Texoma right next to them.  

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   So the, we used to catch some, uh, sand bass off Lake, there's
a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to
the bottom and crank up, you know -- 

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- turns on the -- 

B.38:   Right.  

A.39:   -- reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be
sitting at different levels.  

B.40:   Oh, how about that.  

A.41:   So, yeah, you just leave it at that level and in no time
something would hit it and you could pull them up two and three
times in a row, but you had to find out what level, how many cranks
they were off the bottom.  And if you left it on the bottom, there
was a good chance that you'd catch catfish.  

B.42:   Oh. 

A.43:   And, of course, depending on how big your bait was, uh, you
know, would be depending on what you caught.  

B.44:   Oh, I think that is really interesting.  

A.45:   Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  My grandfather used to do that
and we used to have a light at the top of the water.  

B.46:   Uh-huh.  

A.47:   He'd really spoiled me in that respect.  

B.48:   I think they're, see, and I wish I could go fishing here
because I don't really know much about the fishing here.  I guess
it would, if you did it like you were just, uh, saying, that's
pretty much like rainbow trout.  

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   You bait the hook, you throw it in, you troll it -- 

A.51:   Uh-huh.  

B.52:   -- a little bit and then you wait -- 

A.53:   Yeah.  

B.54:   -- and they troll it a little bit.

A.55:   Well, if you, do you have any friends with ponds?  

B.56:   No.  I don't {faint}.  

A.57:   I, uh, well, if you can fi-, well, or even a lake.  If, uh,
seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do
is throw it out just as far as they can -- 

B.58:   Yeah.  

A.59:   -- and, uh, bring it in to you.  But it's the opposite when
you're fishing from a boat.  You, you want to l-, make it land
right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm -- 

B.60:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- and just have it come into the water like a, a regular
animal or, or fish -- 

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- uh, well, you know, something coming off from the bank like
they usually do [breathing].  So you don't have to really get,
uh, fish from a boat, you know, because they're actually right
there at the shore.  

B.64:   Huh.  

A.65:   But, I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms, but, uh, if,
I am now [laughter].  

B.66:   You are [laughter] now.  

A.67:   Oh, yeah [breathing].  

B.68:   I've never used those.  That's really interesting. 

A.69:   Yeah.  It just, uh, just a slow reel and then let it sit on
the bottom, but the key is to always have your line tight.  

B.70:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.71:   And that way you can feel when they're hitting it, and believe
me you'll know the difference.  

B.72:   Uh, what kind of fish do you like the best to eat?  

A.73:   Oh, crappie actually.  

B.74:   Oh, do you [laughter]?  

A.75:   Yeah [laughter].  I've been fishing in the, the ocean.  We're
about three hours from the ocean.  And I also like Spanish
mackerel.  

B.76:   Um.  

A.77:   And you catch blues and, uh, that's a different kind of
fishing off the pier, too.  Have you ever fished off the pier?  

B.78:   Yes, I've done fishing like that but, but, uh, tell me what,
uh, [lipsmack] where you'd catch crappie.  My, my neighbor has
gone before -- 

A.79:   Uh-huh.  

B.80:   -- and, and done that, but,  

A.81:   Oh, the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits
and, and jigs.  Uh, they have like yellow, uh, fuzz on a hook, you
know, that kind of comes out.  

B.82:   Oh, oh, I know.  

A.83:   Yeah.  

B.84:   Uh, they're sort of like, well, I want to say flies, but not
exactly like,

A.85:   Yeah, get, but they're a little heavier and they're bigger.  

B.86:   Yeah.  

A.87:   Get the yellow ones.  

B.88:   The yellow.  

A.89:   Those are the ticket [laughter]. 

B.90:   Okay [laughter]. 

A.91:   [Breathing] And let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a,
a kind of a slow reel.  You don't even have to have a good rod or
anything.  Just, just even a regular line -- 

B.92:   Uh-huh.  

A.93:   -- and you throw it out and, uh, the, the other thing that's
real good is small, uh, it's a real small ((rapalla)).  It's about
an inch and a half long and they're pure sil-, all silver,
something real shiny about that long.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  

A.95:   They'll go after that in a heartbeat also.  Just anything that
really shines or spins.  

B.96:   Yeah, my mom, she just loves to fish and she has a lot of
those, those little, uh, they almost look neon.  You know, they're
just real color-, colorful -- 

A.97:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  

B.98:   -- things on, onto her end.  

A.99:   That's it.  

B.100:   Yeah.  And she d-, she's really a good fisher woman.  

A.101:   Oh, really?  

B.102:   Yeah.  

A.103:   That's neat.  

B.104:   Well, you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too.
