A.1:  Hi.

B.2:  Hi.

A.3:  I'm wondering what, what camping means to you.

@B.4:  When I think of camping I think of, of bugs [laughter], and
sleeping bags and, and tents, uh, like along the Appalachian
Trail.

A.5:  Oh, very good.  That's sort of the same thing that, that I
do.  I don't think of, um, trailers and campers and all this
stuff.

B.6:  No.

A.7:  Um, do you do much camping?

B.8:  I have never been camping [laughter].

A.9:  Oh, you've never been camping.  Oh, gee.

B.10:  No.  Do you do much?

A.11:  Well, um, yes and no, and, the, uh, I haven't done much
recently, but, um, up until, gee, maybe five or six years ago, I
did a lot of it [throat_clearing] --

B.12:  Really,

A.13:  -- and, you know I've,

B.14:  Where you live now, or,

A.15:  Say?

B.16:  Did you camp up in Maryland, or,

A.17:  No, um, I used to live abroad, and so, I, I camped a lot in,
um, the Middle East --

B.18:  Oh, okay.

A.19:  -- and I was able to camp right in ruins, which was always
very exciting --

B.20:  Oh, I bet.

A.21:  -- [Laughter] and, a bit exotic [laughter], 

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  for those who love bugs, but, [laughter],

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  um, and then when I used to come back to the states in
summer we'd often go up, um, to the lake country in New York --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- with my brother's family and, and do camping there.

B.28:  Oh, okay.  Well, my cou-, uh, husband and, and his uncle
especially, uh, grew up camping together, and, uh, they, they
just love it, and they're planning a trip, uh, into Canada this,
I guess in about a year, and they're going to spend about a week
and a half camping up there,

A.29:  And you're not going?

B.30:  No, this is, this is a, a man's trip [laughter].

A.31:  Oh, that's too bad,

B.32:  So they're really looking forward to that --

A.33:  Oh, gee.

B.34:  -- so.

A.35:  I guess it makes a difference.  I grew up camping, being in
Girl Scouts and things like that, so.

B.36:  And see I was, I was never exposed to it --

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.38:  -- so,

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  I, I feel like I'm a little bit too, uh, much of a city, city
mouse to try doing it [laughter].

A.41:  Oh, that's too bad.  I think the-, you know, there's
certainly a lot of aspects you would like, but maybe not the,
yo-, you know the Canada men's trip, but some other, you know, a
nice tent on the, the shore of a lake, and,

B.42:  What's the best part about it to, to you, the, the quiet, the
getting away?

A.43:  Right, the, the, the no telephone, the, gee whiz, you go to
bed when it gets dark,

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  and you get up when it gets light [laughter].

B.46:  Wow.

A.47:  Yeah, and, um, I guess just, just the change,

B.48:  [Cough].

A.49:  from the rat race.

B.50:  Now, do you usually, like do you usually go and there's lots
of other people around, or is it pretty much isolated. 

A.51:  No, it's, uh, it's pretty isolated, um, and to me, I like
that, I guess, too, although there are people, I mean, you know,
it's really hard to get away --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- [Throat_clearing] and I guess when, when we did sites in,
in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to
make it safe --

B.54:  Yes.

A.55:  -- but, I mean, we'd go in different parts of the ruins, and,
and things like that.  But we didn't even have tents there,
[laughter] we just sort of put out the sleeping roll [laughter].

B.56:  Oh, good grief.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  That, that does sound neat, but I don't think I, I've got
quite enough nerve to do that.  

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  I know my husband's gone, uh, for several days on the
Appalachian Trail before, and he said that you can, a lot of
times you can go for, you know, a good day before you'll see or
meet anybody else on the trail.

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.

A.63:  [Laughter]  Right.  Actually I just joined, um, the
Appalachian Trail Walking Club, or whatever they call it, what,
uh --

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  -- and I'm very eager to, to start, uh, I love to walk --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and, um, I'm going to start with day trips, though,
because I don't know the territory and all, and I'm not sure, my
son is not eager to go and,

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  [Laughter] you know, I think that, that that might be a
little eerie at first, going alone.

B.70:  I think it would be,

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  yeah.

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  Well, that sounds really neat.

A.75:  Oh, but, you know, I'm going to try [laughter].  

B.76:  Well.

A.77:  Well, gee whiz, I hope you get into camping some day, just
slowly.

B.78:  I don't know, uh, we talk about sometimes going up to
Chincoteague --

A.79:  Oh, yeah.

B.80:  -- and, uh, I, maybe, like you said, start out slow and, and
kind of get used to it, and find out that it, maybe it's not as
bad as I, I fear it might be [laughter].

A.81:  Right, I think that, you know, I guess one time recently we
went up to Maine, and had planned to camp, and you know, the only
site left when we got there was in the middle of a field, and I
said, Gee whiz, for twenty dollars we can go down the road and
get a, a motel --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- which we did, and, so that, you know, if the setting was
right and that, it's, it's great, but if it's,
