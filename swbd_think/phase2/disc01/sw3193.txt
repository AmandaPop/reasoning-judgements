A.1:  Okay, well basically my habits are totally gone.  I used to exercise quite
a bit, and now I have a child, and, and, um, trying to do, go to school, back
to college again, so it's, it's, uh --

B.2:  Well it's,

A.3:  -- exercise is kind of, Forget it. 

B.4:  But it, it, we-, if I remember back to when I had a child, they give you a
[laughter] lot of exercise.

A.5:  They sure do, yeah, my daughter,

B.6:  What, what age is your child?

A.7:  Yeah, yeah, uh, she's three.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  So, three with a, I think it's almost like she's got this endless energy. I
mean, it's no longer nap time, that kind of thing.  So,

B.10:  Oh, she's given up the naps.

A.11:  Yes, yeah, so.

B.12:  Oh, I, [laughter] I remember mine doing that.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  [Laughter].  That's terrible.

A.15:  Exactly, so the exercise we can pretty much, uh, get from her.  Uh, she
always wants to go outside and do things.  So, I'm kind of, uh, she's an only
child, too, so, it's, it's not like you can go out and say, Go out and play
with --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- other kids.  So, it's

B.18:  Right, and so many people work nowadays, there's, you know, there's not
that many kids in a neighborhood --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- necessarily --

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  -- any more either.

A.23:  Sure,

B.24:  But, well, my main, uh, exercise, the only one I've ever stuck to at all,
is walking.

A.25:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.26:  And I try to get out and walk two miles most every day, but --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- but it, you know, it fluctuates.  I'll do real good for a while, and
then I'll be off of it for a while, just depending on what's happened --

A.29:  Uh-huh, sure,

B.30:  -- but the last, uh, couple of, uh, years, uh, my husband is an accountant,
and he moved his office to the house, and I work for him.

A.31:  Uh-huh, sure.

B.32:  So that helps, because --

A.33:  Sure,

B.34:  -- we're at home, and I can get out and walk a lot better --

A.35:  Sure.

B.36:  -- than when I was working in an office.  So that has helped.  But anything
else, uh, well, we have a lake house, and down there, when we go down there
some on weekends, we get a different type of exercise, you know, just doing a
lot of work and things down there.  But that and, uh, and walking is about it
[laughter].

A.37:  Yeah, yeah.  That's about what, uh, basically if we can get out and take a
walk, it's, it's great.  But, uh, most of the time we can't.  So, it's, uh,
we're too busy doing other things, but that also takes into account walking,
though --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- when you think about it, so it's

B.40:  I will admit, though, when I do walk, I feel so much better, you know, when
I get out --

A.41:  Oh, sure.

B.42:  -- and do that two miles, it takes about thirty minutes, just --

A.43:  Sure.

B.44:  -- our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- with sidewalks, and --

A.47:  Sure.

B.48:  -- uh, I really do, uh, and, and I smoke --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and I can tell that it just immediately if I've been coughing or
something, you know, it just immediately seems to --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- clear my lungs up --

A.53:  To loosen it up, yeah, yeah, that's true,

B.54:  -- but, uh, 

A.55:  So, yeah,

B.56:  But I got a lot of exercise now the last four or five days.  I have two
grandchildren --

A.57:  Oh yes [laughter].

B.58:  -- three months and nineteen months --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and my daughter and son-in-law went on a trip [laughter] --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- [laughter] for three days and left --

A.63:  So,

B.64:  -- [laughter] them with us.

A.65:  Oh, boy.

B.66:  And we nearly went nuts [laughter].

A.67:  Sure, trying to keep up with the nineteen months, uh, sure, they're into
everything.

B.68:  Well and the baby --

A.69:  The baby, uh-huh.

B.70:  -- was sick, so he wasn't good --

A.71:  Oh, he was cranky,

B.72:  -- you know, so it was one on one.  I mean, I had to take one and he had to
take the other one, and it was busy.  And they woke up all during the night
[laughter], and I'm not, uh, used to that.

A.73:  Sure, once you lose that, sure, that's very true.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  It wasn't too long ago where I was doing the same thing, and that, uh,
totally gets your mental capabilities thrown off totally when they're, uh,
tired, and uh, you wake up in the middle of the night, and it's, my daughter
used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that, so.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now
[laughter].

B.78:  Um, uh-huh.

A.79:  But, uh, that's about it.  That's kind of how my exercise is right now is
just basically running after a three year old.  So.

B.80:  Well, when you were talking about mentally losing sleep, it also made me
think of one other thing walking --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- does for me when I do it.  It does help me mentally, you know --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- if I'm worried about something or whatever, and I get out and do that
walk, it just, I don't know, it just sort of helps your mental attitude, too.

A.85:  It sure does, yeah, (( )).

B.86:  So I miss that when I don't do it.

A.87:  Sure, sure.  

B.88:  But,

A.89:  Well, it was really nice talking to you then.

B.90:  Well nice to talk to you.

A.91:  Okay, uh-huh, thank you.

B.92:  Bye-bye.

A.93:  Uh-huh, bye now.
