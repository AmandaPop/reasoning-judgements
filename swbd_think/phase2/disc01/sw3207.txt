=============================================================================

@A.1:  Um, I don't, I am only twenty-eight and I haven't had much experience with
nursing homes.  I don't, I have never visited any of them and, uh, I don't
think I've ever even been in one.  Have you?

B.2:  Um, actually I have, um, I've, I've been in them but, um, just visiting
and, uh, we used to g-, when we were like in, in our ((teen ages)) we'd go on
Sundays and visit, you know, the older people.  But, um, I have an elderly
grandma that lives with us.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And she's lived with us for like five years.  So I kind of know how it is
to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home or, um, like we,
I mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or
because she's pretty senile and [laughter],

A.5:  And it, it takes a lot of care like twenty-four hours a day someone,

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  has to be,

B.8:  It's rea-,

A.9:  Well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family.  His grandmother too and
they're, that hi-, her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.

B.10:  [Laughter]. 

A.11:  He, he has, he's recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with
when she had a stroke and, and all the other children are working or whatever.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  They're all my parents age.  And, uh, so he's got, you know, his retirement
though is really twenty-four hours a day.  They have a day care two days a
week.  They call it senior citizen day care.  But she goes in the senior
citizen center.

B.14:  Oh, really?  

A.15:  So sh-, he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three
hours at a time.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  And, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, (( )) was
a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired, and you know that a
lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do
now.

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  But he refuses to consider any other, I don't,

B.20:  To put her in a rest home?  

A.21:  Yeah, and is that how your parents feel or,

B.22:  Um, [throat_clearing] well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.

A.23:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.

B.24:  She says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had
said that he would never ha-, put her in a rest home.  So it's kind of, uh, I
don't know.  I mean, I don't, I don't think my parents would but she is
getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed
and,

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  it's, and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't
know.  It's, it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my
parents personally [laughter].

A.27:  I know at this, I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents
either, you know.  But I, I really feel bad for the people I see th-, not
very, I'm not really, really experienced but like I said I just have that one
family, and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different
now and, than he thought it would be.  But,

B.28:  When he retired?  

A.29:  Yeah, and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters and, and, uh, he's
the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she
moved in with when she needed to move in with someone.  And,

B.30:  Yeah, it's like that ((good)) for us just because my uncle and my, and my
mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three
months.

A.31:  Oh, well, that's great.  

B.32:  So that,

A.33:  That's a good idea.  We ought to,

B.34:  that works out good.

A.35:  Yeah, and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I
don't know what they're going to do.  It's really not my family.  It's my
fiancee's so I don't, I can't say much.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either and I wonder,
I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children so if my
parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all
my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care
for.

B.38:  Really?

A.39:  You know, and I'm, I, that's fine with me.  I-, my fiancee and I both
figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or
whoever.  If the-,

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  You know what I mean?  We feel like, 

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  it's our responsibility, and I feel like I would never put them in a home.
But I wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work
someday or retire early or something.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  You think about it and it's really, I don't know.  This country kind of
takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.

B.46:  You think?  I, I --

A.47:  And, 

B.48:  -- I'm not really familiar with how other countries,

A.49:  It's really more of a, um, like a respect issue th-, that the older, older
people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more
respect for the elderly people and, and they really ((seem)) as wise and, and
in this country nobody really,

B.50:  They're seen as senile [laughter].  

A.51:  Yeah, nobody really pays attention and they, oh, the old-timer made with
the old way and nobody respects the traditions.  And, you know, it's I, I'm
not saying that I do either but [laughter] --

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  -- you know, it's just funny and, and we really don't have any that don't
have the Social Security and everything really isn't that much --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- for elderly people to live on.  You know, even if they're in good health
it's incredible.

B.56:  Right.  

A.57:  They don't have any, they don't get special treatment and maybe they
should, you know --

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

@@A.59:  -- because we're all going to get old someday.

B.60:  I know.

A.61:  And so it's a, it's kind of a depressing [laughter] topic though.  How old
are you?

B.62:  Um, I'm twenty.  

A.63:  So it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.

B.64:  Yeah, it's, 

A.65:  (( )).

B.66:  it really is but, and she, she drives us craz-,
