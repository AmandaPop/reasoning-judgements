=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Why don't you go ahead and start.

A.3:  Okay, well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,
and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and it's fast reading, and, uh, the TIME of course, is,
uh, you know, more newsworthy and, uh, it has more world affair
type things, of course.  And then I will purchase a GOOD
HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time
because of recipes and ideas and --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and things like that --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?

B.10:  Yeah, I, well, I have, in a whi-, for a while I haven't
gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm
getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life that
seems to be the last thing I pick up, so I found that I was
wasting my money.  As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do
subscribe I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and,
uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine --

A.11:  Uh-huh --

B.12:  -- uh.

A.13:  -- you probably have smaller children --

B.14:  Yes, yeah,

A.15:  -- younger children.  My children, our children are grown --

B.16:  Yeah, yeah,

A.17:  -- and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the
grandchildren [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter]  Right, well, I found that after a couple of years
of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious, so I
kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.  Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING
magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice,
uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been
piling up on me, so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed
at this point in time.

A.19:  Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much
as they used to?

B.20:  I don't know, I, I, well, my husband would love to have more. 
Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY
magazine and all the financial type magazines,

A.21:  Yes, now my husband does that, and --

B.22:  Yeah,

A.23:  -- you know, and of course, uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL,
you know --

B.24:  Uh-huh, yes.

A.25:  -- and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, but I don't know, I know a few 
people leafing through them at the store --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- but you just don't hear people talk about them, and I know
years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, I just
loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING, and I
took them all --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what in the seventies,
maybe, late seventies they changed their format --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and I haven't, I don't think there's been a magazine as
they used to be --

B.32:  Well --

A.33:  -- even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,

B.34:  -- yeah, and some of those have had what, what I consider or
what I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier
type magazines, as far as women's magazines.  They seem just to
be so chocked full of, of ads.

A.35:  Oh, they are.  My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and
VOGUE --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and she sends them to me, and there's really nothing in
them but advertisements --

B.38:  Yeah, yeah,

A.39:  -- for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry --

B.40:  Yes.

A.41:  -- things that the average middle class citizen is not going
to be purchasing [laughter] --

B.42:  Right [laughter].

A.43:  -- you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how
the other half is living --

B.44:  Yes.

A.45:  -- you know, then I can, I look through them --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- and I do, I just, what I do is I flip through them and,
and pitch them then, you know, they're not something I, you know,
take any length of time over.

B.48:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.49:  I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I
would rather actually read a book --

B.50:  Yes --

A.51:  -- than a magazine.

B.52:  -- I enjoy books a lot more --

A.53:  Yes --

B.54:  -- that's true.

A.55:  -- and, uh.

B.56:  Well --

A.57:  So, but.

B.58:  -- now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used
to, other than my children have gotten.  You know, they get tons
of magazines it seems --

A.59:  Yes [laughter].

B.60:  -- they're always getting something in the mail and, and, uh,
so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper, and
then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a
chance, but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy
magazines, the ones that are full of ads, unless you just want to
skim through while you're, I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's
office or, you know, waiting on something like that.

A.61:  Yes, yes, I will read them in a doctor's office, too.  

B.62:  Yeah,

A.63:  As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME, and,
uh, and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to
cover, you know, I'll glance through it.  I like reading, uh, you
know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something --

B.64:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.65:  -- you know, and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.  It,
it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young --

B.66:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that, I
enjoy that.  It's quick reading --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- you know, it doesn't require [laughter] a lot of thinking,
and sometimes after I've worked all day --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
[laughter] --

B.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.73:  -- I don't want a lot of thinking [laughter].

B.74:  [Laughter] That's true, that kind of is a good way to do it.

A.75:  It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.  Sometimes
when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real
depressed over the situation of the world [laughter],

B.76:  [Laughter].

@@A.77:  so.  Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the
subject of magazines -- 

B.78:  Yeah, yeah.

A.79:  -- and, uh --

B.80:  Okay.

A.81:  -- so, uh, I think that probably I will end the call.  I've
enjoyed,
