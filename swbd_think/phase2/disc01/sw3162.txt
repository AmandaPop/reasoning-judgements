=====================================================================

A.1:   Okay.  Uh [laughter], it's not such a bad idea to think about
judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing in-,
into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a
highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that
are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read,
uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case
in Milwaukee and stuff.  So it's, it may be an idea to think about,
you know, cost.  Trying to find a jury -- 

B.2:   Yeah.  

A.3:   -- so you can get a jury as far as, uh, they may say they're
not biased, but deep down they are a-, against this person or
whatever, so, uh, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think
about.  So,   

B.4:   Right, that it, that it, I, a judge would be more consistent
from one case to the next and not -- 

A.5:   Exactly.  

B.6:   -- not de-, and, and, uh, not depend so much on the, on the
emotions of a particular case, but be able to put it in overall
perspective.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   Well [breathing] -- 

A.9:   Yeah.  

B.10:   -- I, I certainly haven't thought much about this but,  

A.11:   [Laughter]. 

B.12:   [Laughter]. 

A.13:   Catches you off guard, doesn't it?  [Laughter].

B.14:   Yes, yes, some of them, some of them do and some of them
don't, but, uh, this one, uh, I was trying to remember back.  It
seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in -- 

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   -- school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in
the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much.  And I'm, I'm trying to
figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's
a -- 

A.17:   I didn't think they -- 

B.18:   -- by state.  

A.19:   -- were either.  I thought the sentencing was done by the
judge.  

B.20:   Yeah.   

A.21:   I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty.  

B.22:   Yeah.  And, uh, I, I guess, and I don't know whether it's by
state or whether there's been some [breathing] -- 

A.23:   Changes.  

B.24:   -- supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh,
that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the
sentencing or -- 

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   -- too, or whatever.  I, yeah, but, I, yeah, I certainly
wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that.  I guess in terms of the,
uh, you know, ha-, having a judge do it would seem to me to be
more, more fair and -- 

A.27:   Oh, sure.  

B.28:   -- and, uh -- 

A.29:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.30:   -- unbiased.  Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the
unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more
leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system.  That,
that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a
unanimous -- 

A.31:   Exactly.  

B.32:   -- jury -- 

A.33:   Exactly.  Yeah.

B.34:   -- that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the
line anywhere else.  Uh, you know, uh -- 

A.35:   Yeah.  

B.36:   -- two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever.  

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   But, uh, and, and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable
with just a, just a bare majority.  

A.39:   Exactly.  

B.40:   Uh,  

A.41:   Uh-huh, yeah.  That's kind of how I, you know, in certain
cases I can see them going, uh, uh, just basically with a judge,
guilty or not guilty -- 

B.42:   Yeah.  

A.43:   -- verdict --  

B.44:   Yeah.  

A.45:   -- uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus
the small, uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, uh, burglary or
whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not
highly publicized.  But when you get into these highly publicized
cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the
NATIONAL ENQUIRER -- 

B.46:   [Laughter] Yeah, whatever.  

A.47:   -- or whatever.  

B.48:   Yeah.  

A.49:   Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this
thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what.  I'm not
going to listen to the facts or -- 

B.50:   Yeah.  

A.51:   -- and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers
and getting through that.  But, uh, also there's aspect of cost and
I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, uh, the
judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly,
or if it's something that's not costly or what.  You know, being
that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know.  But I wonder
-- 

B.52:   Yeah.  

A.53:   -- if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to
trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's
something that they have to pay.  I know companies have to pay for
these people to be off from work.  Or -- 

B.54:   Yeah.  

A.55:   -- at least give them the time off from work.  Uh, whether
it's, I think it's with pay.  If I remember, jury duty is with pay. 

B.56:   Well,  

A.57:   And it's not,  

B.58:   And, and I'm, I, I'd, I know it is, I know it is where I,
where I work.  

A.59:   Uh-huh.  

B.60:   But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily
required.  Uh, you know, by law that it has to be -- 

A.61:   Paid, right.  

B.62:   -- paid.  Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger
company.  But, but there are -- 

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   -- certainly some,  

A.65:   Some that may decide not to.  

B.66:   Some that, some that wouldn't, uh, yeah,
