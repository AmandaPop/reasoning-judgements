========================================================================

A.1:   Okay.  Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.  I get most of my
news information from T V.  Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an
in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.  

B.2:   Uh-huh.  

A.3:   And I find it one of the best.  

B.4:   Uh-huh.  

A.5:   And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels
eight or five.  

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   And, uh, where do you get yours?  

B.8:   Uh, mostly from T V too.  I u-, [breathing] usually start
watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty [laughter]
and six --

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines. 
Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS and, uh, once in a while
I'll sit down and read, [breathing] read it, [breathing] you know,
but not very often do I read the whole thing.  Quite often just
scan through the headlines [laughter] and, 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS and, and my
husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know
about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this and, uh --

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   -- I don't know it, I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know
several years ago when the kids were teenagers.  It just seems like
I was so busy all the time, and if I wanted to read, I wanted to
read something light and relaxing and --

B.16:   Yeah.   

A.17:   -- and, uh, things like that and so I coul-, and it got so
depressing [laughter]. 

B.18:   Yeah [laughter]. 

A.19:   Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news [laughter]. 

B.20:   Yeah.  If there's something, you know, that I want to know
more about or som-, might be the Killeen murders.  I've been kind
of intrigued.  I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone [laughter].
You just,

A.21:   Yes, yes.  I, [laughter] I will pick up if there's something
really gruesome in there [laughter].  I'll go through and read it. 

B.22:   [Laughter]. 

A.23:   Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and
everything if I watch, uh, the T V --

B.24:   Yeah.  

A.25:   -- you know, and, and they kind of capsize it --

B.26:   Yeah.

A.27:   -- and everything and watch, and I think sometimes it's, you
know --

B.28:   Right.  

A.29:   -- maybe a little biased, you know --

B.30:   Oh, yeah.    

A.31:   -- i-, ((something)) and sometimes.  

B.32:   Yeah.  

A.33:   You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure
facts.  

B.34:   That's true.  

A.35:   You know.  

B.36:   I wanted a little more detail like, you know, they would tell
more about the people that were killed, where they were from and
how old they were.  And I guess you just, you know, you --

A.37:   Yes.  Yes.

B.38:   -- you just want to know and with interest, you know I found
some people that were members of our church which was different. 
And that made you even feel a little more kin to, [laughter] to
what was going on.  

A.39:   You found some members of your church that had been murdered? 

B.40:   Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we
belong to.

A.41:   Oh, the same type of church.  

B.42:   Uh-huh.   

A.43:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.44:   Yeah, so that made it a little more and that they were from
Utah also so.  

A.45:   Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.46:   So that was interesting, but I enjoy the news.  I, I think our
seven year old even e-, once in a while will sit down and watch it --

A.47:   Uh-huh.  

B.48:   -- with us, so.  

A.49:   I used to, uh, or I didn't used to but, uh --

B.50:   No.  

A.51:   -- when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and
even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to
give brief inserts of news at a child's level.  

B.52:   Uh-huh.  

A.53:   And I thought that was very interesting, and I thought that
was very important for kids.  Like they brought down something that
had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war,
they would bring it down to a child's level in words --

B.54:   Huh.  

A.55:   -- you know, that they could understand --

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   -- what was going on.  And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren
seemed to kind of enjoy that.  The oldest one he's --

B.58:   Right.

A.59:   -- nine and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this ((been)) a
couple of years ago.  

B.60:   Yeah.  

A.61:   And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting. 
Actually I even understood it better [laughter]. 

B.62:   Yeah, [laughter] that's nice sometimes when they --

A.63:   Yeah [laughter].

B.64:   -- they pull it down a little bit like that.   

A.65:   Yeah, [laughter] you know.  And, uh, but as I said, uh, I 
ten-, you know, I, I have kind of a blas3e attitude about, uh, news
and news reporting which is, is not good, yo-, you know.

B.66:   Right.  

A.67:   Nobody should get that way about the news.  

B.68:   {Very faint} Right.

A.69:   And what's going on in the world.  

B.70:   Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you
watch it or, 

A.71:   Yes.  We like channel eight.  

B.72:   Do you?  

A.73:   We like it.  It's the best.

B.74:   Um, channel five for some reason has always been [laughter] --

A.75:   Is that been --

B.76:   -- the one I watch.  

A.77:   -- your favorite?  Uh-huh.  

B.78:   I, I don't know it's probably the anchors.  They just kind of
catch you.  I don't, I don't know.  

A.79:   Yeah, I very sel-, and I thought it was very interesting, uh,
channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen --

B.80:   Uh-huh.  

A.81:   -- and, and going on.  They were having news coverage and,

B.82:   The C N N, is that what that is?

A.83:   No, it was channel nine.  

B.84:   Huh.  

A.85:   And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten --

B.86:   Oh.  

A.87:   -- of an evening.  And so we had the T V on and we were trying to
catch all of it, and they were showing some and I was watching, my
husband and I were watching it, and then we switched over to
channel eight, and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.  

B.88:   Yeah.  

A.89:   I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why
they're kind of behind.  

B.90:   Yeah.  

A.91:   Did I say channel nine to begin with?  

B.92:   Yeah [laughter].  That's --

A.93:   No [laughter].

B.94:   -- why I wondered. 

A.95:   Okay.  No, chan-, [laughter] --

B.96:   I don't get that channel [laughter]. 

A.97:   -- channel eleven I meant.  

B.98:   Yeah.

A.99:   [Laughter] I was thinking nine to ten.  

B.100:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.101:   But channel eleven,

B.102:   That is if you, if you want to go to bed [laughter] early it's
nice to, to, to watch that early news --

A.103:   Uh-huh.  

B.104:   -- sometimes, so.

A.105:   It, uh, but the coverage wasn't near as good ((as)) when we,
you know, switched over to channel eight and they didn't e-,
