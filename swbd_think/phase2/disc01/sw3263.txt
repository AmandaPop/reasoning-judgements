=======================================================================

B.1:   Okay.  Changes, wha-, how, how old are you?  

A.2:   I'm twenty.  

B.3:   Twenty.  Oh, boy [laughter].

A.4:   How old are you?  

B.5:   I'm thirty-three.  

A.6:   Oh.

B.7:   I feel a lot older.  

A.8:   [Laughter]. 

@B.9:  Uh, [laughter] what do you think the changes are?  

A.10:   Um, huh.  Um, I just think it's more acceptable for women to,
um, be in the workplace than, uh, I guess it was a long time ago. 
Um, that's [laughter],  

B.11:   Acceptable as in, uh, 

A.12:   Like, I just think that they were expected to be at home more
before.  

B.13:   Yeah.  

A.14:   And now it's more prevalent I guess.  

B.15:   Uh, I work for a really big corporation and we are, uh, 
N C N B.

A.16:   Oh, really?  

B.17:   Yeah.  And -- 

A.18:   Huh.  

B.19:   -- we've got a lot of women in the, in the company, and I'm a
lawyer too so ((it's like this)), you know, I've got a I
perspective working for a big corporation and a professional
working for a big corporation.  

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   And, uh, [breathing] I, I, you know, there are a lot of women
here.  There are a lot of women in power positions, but, uh, and,
and that's just all wonderful and hunky-dory and aren't we
progressive in business, but there are very, very few women in, uh,
in senior positions.  

A.22:   Right.  

B.23:   On, not, you know, not on the board of directors, uh, [static]
you know not in senior level management [static].  And I don't
know if that's from, uh, I don't know that's, ju-, just because
there hasn't been time or whether there's a gla-, you know, what
they call a glass ceiling.  

A.24:   Uh-huh [static].  So you just don't think ((that is says)),
[static] do you think that's good or bad or,   

B.25:   I, I think it's, I think what you're saying is true and that
it's acceptable.  And, okay, women [static] get out and work, but
I don't know that, um, they, they're really ex-, they're, really
been, uh, in, I hate to use the word again accepted in the position
of being workers.  

A.26:   Uh-huh.  

B.27:   {Very faint} You know.  Yeah, you all get out there and do
that, but you know we're not going to, you know we're not going to
make a chairman of the board.  

A.28:   Right.  And why do you think, why, why do you think that is? 
Just, 

B.29:   Just, just because I don't see it.  I also, I work with a lot
of law firms and a lot of companies and, you know, most of the,
most of the, uh, movers and shakers are men.  

A.30:   {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

B.31:   And then in the bank even [static] most of the, you know there
are a few women that really stand out, but you know most of the
young eager ones, you know, the, oh, the young wonder children are
men.  

A.32:   Do you think it's because they have the qualifications or
because, 

B.33:   No.

A.34:   Not at all?

B.35:   [Laughter] No [laughter]. 

A.36:   Oh.   

B.37:   Uh, well, I don't know.  I think maybe, 

A.38:   [Throat_clearing]. 

B.39:   some of it's because, uh, uh, I don't, no, I'm, I'm not
certain.  I don't know.  

A.40:   {Very faint} Huh.  

B.41:   Seems like some of the women, they, maybe the women aren't
motivated.  Uh, (( )),

A.42:   They just are willing to take the back seat or, 

B.43:   Right.  I'm going to go in and be a clerk.  And no, you're
just as smart as the fellow you're working for.   

A.44:   {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

B.45:   That's what I see a lot of.  I wrote my senior research paper
on the Equal Rights Amendment so I'm -- 

A.46:   Oh, really?  

B.47:   -- kind of an activist, yes.  

A.48:   Are you really?  

B.49:   Yeah [laughter] [static].

A.50:   So you're pretty, um, liberal as far as, 

B.51:   I'm very liberal [laughter].  {Very faint} ((And I'm speaking
to someone in Provo, Utah)).  

A.52:   [Laughter]. 

B.53:   [Laughter].

A.54:   Well, um [laughter].  Yeah, I, I don't know I'm more of a, I
guess I'm more conservative in my viewpoints.  I mean I think it's
great if they wanted it, if, you know, women want to do that and
I'm planning on being a nurse, so [laughter].  But, I don't know. 
I,  

B.55:   So how many men are there in, in, in the nursing profession? 

A.56:   Very few [throat_clearing].

B.57:   Yeah.

A.58:   Very few.  But, 

B.59:   And, and why is that?   

A.60:   Because they think it's a woman's job [laughter] probably.

B.61:   Yeah, I know but,

A.62:   Uh, or maybe men want to earn more mo-, I, I ((don't)) --

B.63:   I di-, exactly [laughter]. 

A.64:   -- want to earn more money --

B.65:   ((Well)),

A.66:   -- so they can support f-, I don't, huh.  

B.67:   And, you know, I, my sister-in-law is a nurse.  I know what
she does and it's, she has a lot of responsibility.  I mean she
just doesn't change bedpans.  And, uh, 

A.68:   Right.  The, you just don't think that it pays off.  I mean
like I, I found out like the, all the doctor com-, comes in and
does is the [children] like end delivery is come in and deliver the
baby.  I mean all the preeverything is nurse --

B.69:   Yeah.  

A.70:   -- nurses but the doctors get the bucks [laughter]. 

B.71:   Exactly.  They get the bucks and they get the, and the
recognition for it.  

A.72:   Yeah.  

B.73:   And all the patient sees is this woman, you know, hovering
around, [laughter] you know, you know, yanking on wires and, and 
I V cords and, 

A.74:   Uh-huh.  

B.75:   So I, I, and I don't think that, I don't think that nurses get
half the recognition they ought to for example.  

A.76:   Oh, definitely.  I, I agree [laughter].
