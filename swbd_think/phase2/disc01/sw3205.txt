===========================================================================

@A.1:  The question was on lawn and garden work.  Um, how do you like it?

B.2:  Well, I don't do much of it here.  I'm from, uh, Te-, from, uh, Colorado
originally and there are no bugs there.  And I didn't mind getting in the dirt
there, but, boy, I'll tell you what, once I see these bugs around here, I'm
just kind of out of it.

A.3:  Oh, what kind do you have?  [Laughter].

B.4:  Oh, roaches and, 

A.5:  Do they really?  

B.6:  Oh, yes.  Cockroaches are awful here.  

A.7:  Oh.  

B.8:  Just awful.  So I, 

A.9:  Oh, and I know somebody that lives there, and they never mentioned that
problem [laughter].

B.10:  Oh, you're kidding, you're kidding.  No, it's a d-, well, maybe they didn't
mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.  And, uh,

A.11:  Oh, my.  They probably just take it for granted then.  

B.12:  It must be.  If they lived here, a lot of people I know just say, oh, I
just [baby] stomp on them.  It doesn't matter.  They make good fertilizer in
the garden.

A.13:  Oh, ((yuck)) [laughter]. 

B.14:  [Laughter] Me, personally can't, 

A.15:  (( )) I don't have that problem, uh, it's, mine is mainly we kind of have
an understanding that, uh, I, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  And so I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part,

B.18:  [Baby].

A.19:  like putting in the annuals and things like that.

B.20:  Uh-huh [baby].

A.21:  But I don't like, I don't like it dirty [laughter]. 

B.22:  No [laughter].  I have to, you know I have to say that's not
[child_talking] exactly my favorite thing either really [baby_crying].

A.23:  No, I don't know.  We got the, we got the question and I thought, oh, this
is going to be interesting.  Two bits I'll get a man to talk [laughter] to me,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  because they get stuck doing it all.  

B.26:  [/Baby_crying].

A.27:  But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work.
And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so, um,

B.28:  [Baby].

A.29:  we've been fighting a drought here this summer -- 

B.30:   Huh.   

A.31:   -- and getting into fall.  Today we just had a lot of rain [laughter]. 

B.32:  [Baby] Oh, really?  

A.33:  Yeah, so it's kind of nice.  I don't know how yours has been. 

B.34:  Well, it's been real hot here lately.  I mean we've had to actually have
the air-conditioning on and everything but, uh, doe-, it's supposed to rain
again now, uh, this weekend.

A.35:   Oh, I see. 

B.36:   {Very faint} So, then,

A.37:  Okay.  Well, we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and
from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is going to be a switch for us
for a week --

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  -- going down there, and I think we'll probably experience some of your
weather although I think they have more humidity.  But, um,

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know, uh, too
much, too much about, uh, how much I really r-, do enjoy it myself.  Do you
like it at all?

B.42:  I, well, [child_talking] not here.  I mean it's just, here [child_talking]
I just can't stand to even get out in the, uh, in the dirt [laughter].  Just,

A.43:  Well, how about when you were in Colorado?

B.44:  Well, I liked it a [child_talking] little bit but I didn't, uh, I was
[child_talking] working at that time full-time and didn't have a lot of time,

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  for that and so that I think really, um, hampered it a little bit.

A.47:  Well, and then, too, now like where we had the dry summer and we had to
sprinkle constantly.  My water bill was high.  And, uh, if you have that on a
regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry [laughter]
to keep it off, you know.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  But, uh, and with children, um, you probably don't have time
anyhow -- 

B.50:  No.  

A.51:  -- to, to get into it.  

B.52:  Not really [laughter].

A.53:  It's so, uh, okay, very good.  

B.54:  {Very faint}.  Uh-huh.

A.55:  I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter, 

B.56:  Sounds like i-,

A.57:  since [laughter] neither one is really into gardening, are we? 
[Laughter]. 

@@B.58:  No, no.  Afraid not.  Uh, hopefully they'll give a subject I
like one of these times [laughter].

A.59:   Right.  Okay.  

B.60:   Something I really know a lot about.  

A.61:   Right.  

B.62:   Wh-, nice talking to you.  

A.63:   Nice talking with you.  

B.64:   Okay, bye-bye.   

A.65:   Uh-huh, bye.
