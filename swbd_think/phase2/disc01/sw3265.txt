==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I've been real, um, [baby] thinking I'd love to buy a new car,

B.2:  Oh [laughter].

A.3:  right now, if I could afford it.  But we have two cars right now and
we're still paying on them, but I would love to have one of these new mini
vans.  I've got two little ones and I think that would be just the perfect
family car [dishes].

B.4:  I, right now my car is terminally ill --

A.5:  Oh [laughter].

B.6:  -- so I am really looking at, uh, facing the purchase of a car.  And,

A.7:  [Dishes].

B.8:  uh, what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that,

A.9:  [Dishes].

B.10:  I won't do it.  But [laughter], 

A.11:  What is it?

B.12:  Uh, well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.

A.13:  Oh.  

B.14:  And, uh, you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me so I don't
know why I think I want one but I do.

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  Uh, I will probably stay with a foreign make.  

A.17:  [Noise].

B.18:  I've had real good luck with them.  

A.19:  [Noise]  Yeah.  We have, um, we have, [noise] we went out to buy an
American car so we bought, um, a Chevy Nova about three years ago.  And, and
we opened up the, the hood and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the
front of all the engine parts [laughter].

B.20:  Is that right?  

A.21:  Uh-huh.  Toyota, uh, well, the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota
Camry.  Uh, at that time was the same car so they just put different names on
them depending on who they're being shipped to.

B.22:  Oh, 

A.23:  I thought that was pretty n-,

B.24:  well, I didn't realize it.  I knew that one of the, that Nissan which is
Toyota had, uh, joined with, had a plant over here.  And, and I,

A.25:  [Dishes].

B.26:  didn't know if it was General Motors or who, but I, I never thought 
of,

A.27:  Yeah.   

B.28:  I know, uh, you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A. 

A.29:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written, I
mean, imprinted on the engine.  It was real interesting.

B.30:  Huh.  

A.31:  But, uh, I, with so many options now available, [children] you know, where,
where cars are concerned, it just seems like there is, there's almost too much
of a choice anymore.  You know, there's so many different options and so many
different prices and who has this cash back and whatever.  I think that if I
were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into
consideration the price naturally.  But, um, [/dishes] you know, I would
really want something that I would want [child] for that much money.  For ten
or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars [child_talking] or whatever.

B.32:  Well, yeah, and that's minimum.  

A.33:  Oh, yea-, definitely [laughter].

B.34:  It, you know it's, 

A.35:  [Child_crying]. 

B.36:  it's a major purchase,

A.37:  [Dishes].

B.38:  now.  What we used to pay for homes is now what a car, 

A.39:  [Dishes]. 

B.40:  can cost.  

A.41:  I cannot [rustling] imagine that, you know, [clicking] somebody, I heard a
commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about, oh, it would,
how,

B.42:  [Cough]. 

A.43:  exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase, and I thought, I don't
think I'd find that exciting [dishes].  I'd be wondering, you know, here I am
buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money
[laughter].

B.44:  If they held their value, that would be one thing.

A.45:  That's true.  

B.46:  But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot,

A.47:  [Child]. 

B.48:  they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated.  

A.49:  [/Child] Yeah.  

B.50:  And, you know, that, [sigh] I don't know that, 

A.51:  [Baby_talking]. 

B.52:  I'll go with, I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought and I
don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again.

A.53:  Yeah.  Well, we had a pretty, we bought our Chevrolet brand new and then we
bought a used car [/baby_talking].  {Talks to baby} Just a minute, I'll change
your diaper.

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  Then we bought our, our next car used and, uh, we had better luck with our
used car, and I like it more.  It cost us less money and we got more features
and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for
twice as much money.

B.56:  Well, I'm, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand
new car.

A.57:  If you can find one that's r-, uh, you know, reliable [baby_talking].  If
you can get someone that you trust to buy one from [noise] or, [baby_talking]
you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough
[child_talking] [breathing].

B.58:  Well, some people, you know, some people have to have a new car every year.

A.59:  Uh, I wouldn't [baby_crying].

B.60:  Or it, you know, at the most every two years and they don't drive them that
much.  Especially,

A.61:  [Child_talking]. 

B.62:  your foreign cars.  You know, 

A.63:  [/Child_talking].  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  ((Sh)),

B.64:  like a Honda or, uh, a Toyota.  Six thousand is just getting broken in
for them.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  And if I can find one or a repossession.  

A.67:  That's, we bought one like that.

B.68:  And with the banks being in such financial, you know, problems now that
people, you can find the banks willing to sell you a car.

A.69:  Uh-huh [baby_crying].  We bought one car that way and had, we bought it
real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so, because apparently
whatever the bank get ...
