=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, um, about capital punishment.  First of all I know that in, uh,
Texas they have lethal, death by lethal injection, I guess that's --

B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  -- the preferred method.  Have they used anything else #in Texas, in your
memory?#

B.4:  #I don't know.# To tell you the truth, I don't follow it, uh, any more than
I [laughter] have to. #But I do know# --

A.5:  #I see.#

B.6:  -- someone was just recently, uh, put to sleep.

A.7:  Oh [laughter] yeah, that's kind of the euphemistic term for it.

B.8:  Exactly.

A.9:  Um, so, uh, have you been following the, the Dahlmer case at all?

B.10:  Ooh [laughter].  

A.11:  #Oh, that's a little too grizzly too, huh.#

B.12:  #No mo-, again,# no more than I have to.  Um, I have very mixed feelings
about this whole issue.  Um, uh, I, I really don't like the idea of, of, uh,
death penalty, ca-, capital punishment, however you want to put it.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Um, and yet I do concur that there are some people that have to be kept
away forever.  I mean, I really do think there are some people that there's
nothing that can be done about.  So, it makes a dilemma for me.

A.15:  I see.  Um, do you think that, uh, putting, putting those people in jail
permanently would be an equally good solution?

B.16:  I, I, the, I always think about it in terms of myself, and I really wonder
if I'd really want to be in jail for the rest of my life, or just killed.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I mean, I think, uh, and some have asked to be killed, you know, there,
there have been, been some criminals who have said, and this is what I want.
And I can, and I can see that side of it --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- uh, because I don't know what life is like, what, what life means if
you're in jail the rest of your life.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  Well, certainly for, for someone like Charles Manson who's very
definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life, I, uh, I can't
imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board, that, uh, his
life is not going to improve.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Um, do you think, uh, do you think that, that, uh, the death penalty is
effective as a means of retribution --

B.24:  A, a deterrent #or (( )) yeah.#

A.25:  -- #yeah, as, as, as a# deterrent value, yeah?

B.26:  [Breathing] Um, I don't know.  Uh, you know, I don't think we, we haven't
used it enough.  They say in, in, in countries where you know you're going to
have your hand cut off, you know, if you steal, et cetera, [noise] that, that
it has, that, that there is less crime.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Uh, we certainly let our people out way to fast.  I don't know, I don't
think I've got enough evidence on that.  What about you?

A.29:  Um, well, to be honest I think that the, uh, capital punishment is, is, is
a, uh, red herring in the crime and punishment business.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Um, as you said, we're letting our people out far too much.  Really the
problem is that, I, I think two-fold.  Number one in Los Angeles, as you may
know, there's, uh, lots and lots of problem high crime areas, and, uh, in
black parts of town the cops, the cops don't trust the, the people who live
there, and the people don't live there, uh, people don't trust the cops who,
uh --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- run the beat.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So, in this heated air of mistrust, people don't do what's necessary to
keep crime down, because, uh, you know, if, if, uh, it takes too much work or
if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever, things
are not going to change, and so, capital punishment doesn't matter if the
criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place.

B.36:  Right, and may be killed on the street anyway.  Death is not that bi-, I
mean one way or the other, death is part of their everyday life.

A.37:  Oh, yeah, as, as, uh.

B.38:  I mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed, you know, that's
a big deal --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up,
walk, to school.

A.41:  Yeah, exactly, you know, John, John Singleton who's, who, uh, made the
film, um, [smack] [inhaling] [breathing] BOYS OF THE HOOD --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- noted that, uh, one in twenty-five black men will be killed at the hands
of other black men --

B.44:  Yes, yeah.

A.45:  -- and, uh, that's, you know, for them, the death penalty is irrelevant, #I
mean, it's# --

B.46:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.47:  -- what, what difference is that going to make to them.  There has got to
be more effective policing, and there's got to be more trust on both sides #of
the equation.#

B.48:  #That's right,# that's right, and, uh, what we do is we keep coming up with
ways to hand-, I mean, I just heard the attorney general, I think it was, on
[laughter] P B S, and then I briefly going by, because it made me too angry,
but he was telling about how wonderful our presidents have been, because we've
gotten this and that many more jails, and [laughter] (( )),
