B.1:  Hello.

A.2:  I'm Bridget.

B.3:  My name's Dan.

A.4:  It's nice to meet you.

B.5:  Nice to meet you.

A.6:  Are you ready for me to push one?

B.7:  I think so.

A.8:  Okay.  [beep]  Okay, do you have any kids?

@B.9:  Well, no, uh, luckily I don't.  I just rent them.

A.10:  [Laughter]  You do?

B.11:  Yeah, I'm a, I'm an assistant scout master for a boy scout troop.

A.12:  Oh, that's good.

B.13:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's so much better to, to rent.

A.14:  A little easier. 

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  Well, what would you think if they were going off to college?

B.17:  Ooh, that's, uh, let's see, I used to be able to do this quite well, but
that was when I was in college.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  Yeah, the college that I've got, that, that I went to was pretty good,
which was Cal Poly in Pomona --

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  -- and, uh, uh, it was a regular, it was a state university, and it seemed
to be pretty good.

A.22:  Yeah, because I'm in college right now.

B.23:  Oh, really.  #Which one?#

A.24:  #In fact# golly that's a good question,

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  I's like, because I know how my parents when I was looking at colleges,
they didn't really say anything, I mean, they didn't say, you know, I want you
to go here or, you know, they left it up to me --

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- and, uh, that was real interesting, because I picked where I wanted to
go, and then afterwards my mom was like, Oh, I really kind of wish you would
have gone there, and I didn't even know that she'd even, you know, liked
another place or anything.

B.29:  Yeah, yeah.

A.30:  But I don't think parents could make that decision for you.

B.31:  Well, my, my parents wanted me to go to, uh, community college --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- and, uh, I ended up getting into the university, and they never really
said anything about it until [throat_clearing] my sisters went to college.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  They went to the community college, and my, my father's going, gee it, it,
it, uh, costs a lot more, or just as much to go to community college and you
aren't getting as much. #You know, so.#

A.36:  #Yeah, definitely.#

B.37:  [Throat_clearing].

A.38:  I know some peo-, I know some of my friends whose parents really wanted
them to go somewhere, so they did --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- and they hate it, you know.  

B.41:  Oh, yeah.

A.42:  Or that they don't do good and they fail out, and --

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  -- in fact, because I know one person, um, his parents wanted him to go to
S M U really bad --

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  -- and he went, and he doesn't like it, I mean, he wouldn't admit to you
that he doesn't like it but it,

B.47:  [Laughter].

A.48:  you know, he's not doing good, and he never is excited about it or
anything, and he won't tell his parents.  I was like, well why don't you
transfer, you know.

B.49:  Well, because his parents gave him a car to go there.  [laughter] (( ))
well, you know [laughter].

A.50:  Yeah, I mean, a car wouldn't get it. I just think that's (( )).  I don't
think parents can, can make that decision for you.  I, you know.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  If you, if they were, I think you should choose and, you know, and work
something out between you all.

B.53:  Uh-huh.  That's, that's the way colleges are right now, anyway, is they --

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  -- they have a bunch of kids come down, they say, hey, you want to be here?

A.56:  Yeah, oh, I know.

B.57:  It's, it's, so it's pointed towards you [laughter].

A.58:  Yeah, see.

B.59:  And if they sell you well enough, there ain't nothing that's going to
change your mind [laughter].

A.60:  That's right, that's right, that's definitely true.

B.61:  We're consumers in society [laughter].

A.62:  Yeah.  Sad, as long as, I just think as long as people are happy.

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  So many people will go some place and transfer or whatever.

B.65:  Yeah.  You got to --

A.66:  It's like you got to find where you fit in best.

B.67:  -- got to find the good classes and things like that.

A.68:  Yeah, really, I know.  I have some hard classes now, that I'm just like,
uh.

B.69:  [Laughter] (( )).

A.70:  Stuff like that.

B.71:  Well, I can imagine that.  I, I started off, the, the counselor at the high
school, said, oh, you want to do this, wanted to go into aerospace --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- and I went and my first day of enrollment in college I walked around, I
go into the aerospace building and they gave me the curriculum and it's like,
twenty-one units to twenty-four units a quarter.

A.74:  Uh, and you're like, uh, I don't think I want to do that.

B.75:  Yeah, average is like, you know, supposed to be like sixteen, eighteen, you
know.

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  You know, this is like, I don't want to be a doctor [laughter].

A.78:  Like, I, I really didn't want to do it, I was just kidding, you know, I
just [laughter] thought I'd come try it out.

B.79:  Yeah, happened to be walking down the hall, turned into some, some other
instructor's office and said, help me.

A.80:  Yeah, really.

B.81:  And he sold me on his program.

A.82:  Yeah, you came out feeling good, choose that for you.

B.83:  Yeah [laughter].

A.84:  That's why I think people, people that I know that stay in school so long,
it's because they can't figure out what they want to do.

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  Like, you know, and they start with one major, and they go through the
certain, you know, classes you have to take for that major, then they [noise]
{sounds like water} change their mind.

B.87:  Yeah.

A.88:  And it's like, oh, you got to start all over, because you lose all the
classes you just took.

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  [Noise] {sounds like water} That's crazy, that's like, they need to hire
someone to help you and,

B.91:  [Laughter].

A.92:  everyone should have to take like a test or something, of what you might
want to do.

B.93:  [Noise] {sounds like a wooden block bouncing across the floor} Yeah.

A.94:  And I think that's so sad.

B.95:  There's some tests like that, you know.

A.96:  Yeah, there are.

B.97:  But they're kind of strange, some of them, you know, it's like --

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  -- you, you, you should be a cement mixer, or something like that, you
know.

A.100:  [Laughter].

B.101:  And the guy walked in going, yeah, but I wanted to be a psychologist.

A.102:  Yeah, you're going, you should be a farmer, you're like what, what.

B.103:  [Laughter].

A.104:  Yeah, I know, we took those in like high school.  Those are stupid.

B.105:  Yeah. 

A.106:  #(( )).#

B.107:  #What's, what's# your major?

A.108:  Mine is psychology.
