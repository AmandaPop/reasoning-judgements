============================================================

A.1:   Okay, well, I don't exercise on a regular basis.  I think
about it a lot.  

B.2:   [laughter] 

A.3:   But I chase an eighteen month old and I think, if I do much
else, I'm going to fall over.  

B.4:   Well, isn't that the tr- [laughter].  

A.5:   So, [laughter] that's, uh, I like exercising, I feel good when
I do it, but I find it real hard to fit it into a schedule.  

B.6:   Well, I just started going back to aerobics.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   It's three times a week and, it just, the minute you get off
work, you got to run over there, change clothes -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- [lip_smack] do that, come home, take a bath, you know, get
cleaned up and there's always people at our house -- 

A.11:   Yeah.  

B.12:   -- and things going on and it -- 

A.13:   Yeah.  

B.14:   -- it's hard, it's hard to fit it in and I'm not one of these
that loves aerobics anyway.  

A.15:   No.  

B.16:   We're going snow skiing in March so I'm wanting to get in
shape before we went so that I wouldn't just fall over dead
[laughter]  -- 

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   -- up there, but I thought as soon as this is over, I am
quitting.  

A.19:   [laughter] 

B.20:   I just ...  

A.21:   It's not going to last long, huh.  

B.22:   No, and I, you feel good after you, you know, you work out,
but it's always a --

A.23:   [screeching]

B.24:   -- mental chore for me to get psyched up to go.  

A.25:   Yeah.  

B.26:   But once I get there, I'm all right.  

A.27:   Yeah.  Well, now, I did find, uh, a video that I really liked,
and I just can't quite convince myself it's worth paying for yet. 

B.28:   [laughter] 

A.29:   And it was Richard Simmons Sweating To The Oldies.  

B.30:   Oh, I know, I saw that, I want that.  

A.31:   It's a lot of fun.  My son likes it.  

B.32:   Oh, you're kidding.  

A.33:   No.  My girlfriend and I used to work out to it right before
Christmas, and we put him in her playpen at her house and he
thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around
because -- 

B.34:   [laughter] 

A.35:   -- it's more like just dancing -- 

B.36:   It is.  

A.37:   -- than anything else.  

B.38:   Yeah, and the, but the fact that all the movements that they
do are exactly what you need to, but -- 

A.39:   Yeah.  

B.40:   -- the fact that it's songs that you like and movements that
are not so hard ...  

A.41:   Well, that's true, and [noise] the only thing about that was
that they weren't maybe songs that I was real familiar with -- 

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   -- but I could feel it.  It, it wasn't that you couldn't feel
that it was working -- 

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   -- because I'm out of shape, and I could feel it working, but
I enjoyed what I was doing so much that it was pretty much one of
those, I didn't care -- 

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   -- that I was really working out.  

B.48:   That's the only video I have even considered buying.  

A.49:   Well, and, it's one of three.  He has Sweating To The Oldies
Two and Three and I haven't seen the other two, but I really think
they'd be a lot of fun to have.  

B.50:   I think so.  I think they're around twenty dollars apiece,
aren't they?  

A.51:   Yes.  

B.52:   Yeah.  

A.53:   Even at a discount store, I've looked at them and they're
about eighteen ninety -- 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   -- for one of them, so, uh, that's why I say I can't quite -- 

B.56:   [laughter] 

A.57:   -- I can't see paying someone to enjoy watching me sweat 
and -- 

B.58:   [laughter] 

A.59:   -- uh, n-, and not enjoy myself.  

B.60:   I know.  

A.61:   That was the other thing about working out.  

B.62:   I have a friend that lives in Dallas and she, every day, goes
to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the
whole bit and I -- 

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   -- just thought, you must be kidding.  

A.65:   Um ...  

B.66:   And then they got to, a while, they'd go before work, maybe
work out for an hour.  I thought -- 

A.67:   Oh, you're kidding.  

B.68:   -- you all are eaten up with it, just [laughter] -- 

A.69:   You people are crazy [laughter]. 

B.70:   -- yeah, just eaten up with it.  But they're young and they're
single and -- 

A.71:   Oh, well, there's half of it -- 

B.72:   -- that kind of stuff.  

A.73:   -- right there.  

B.74:   Uh-huh, and I said, well, that's what's the matter with you. 
Get -- 

A.75:   [laughter] 

B.76:   -- married and you won't care.  

A.77:   [laughter] Have those babies and it changes.  

B.78:   Really, I don't have any children, I, all my friends do.  

A.79:   Uh-huh.  

B.80:   I've got one that --

A.81:   [child_yelling]

B.82:   -- the minute she had the baby -- 

A.83:   Uh ...  

B.84:   -- she lost every bit of the weight and was right back skinny
little thing again and I thought, you make me sick.  

A.85:   Yeah, oh, I agree.  

B.86:   But she's young.  

A.87:   I agree.  

B.88:   She's about twenty, twenty-two.  

A.89:   Uh-huh.  

B.90:   And I thought, well, that's what it is, you're just, you're
just a child.  

A.91:   Well, that's a -- 

B.92:   [laughter] 

A.93:   -- part of it, I bet, because I'm, well, I'm twenty-nine now,
I just turned twenty-nine and I haven't lost hardly anything and my
son's a year and a half.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  Some people, I don't know, I've got another friend
that, I'm twenty-nine and she's twenty-nine.  After she had her son
she said I was just too busy to eat [laughter].  

A.95:   [laughter] Wrong.  

B.96:   Sh-, [laughter] she had a two year old and then she had -- 

A.97:   [laughter] 

B.98:   -- had another one, and she says I just don't have time to
eat.  She says, I, one, I'm fiddling with one and then I'm fiddling
with the other one and she said, I just, at nighttime, I think, boy
I don't think I've had anything to eat today.  

A.99:   Well, there's no way.  

B.100:   And that's how she lost hers, yeah.  

A.101:   No, there's no way.  I, I make time to eat.  

B.102:   Well, really.  

A.103:   Because when h-, particularly his age now [child_yelling], he
and I eat the same things and if I'm not eating, he doesn't eat
very -- 

B.104:   Uh-huh.  

A.105:   -- well, so -- 

B.106:   Uh-huh.  

A.107:   -- I have to eat.  

B.108:   Well, yeah.  

A.109:   You did so good on the others, you keep doing that one {to
child}.  

B.110:   [laughter] 

A.111:   He's stripping Crayolas.  

B.112:   Uh-huh.  

A.113:   Yeah.  

B.114:   That was always fun.  

A.115:   Oh, yeah [laughter].  Well, what else were we supposed to talk
about?  Oh, why we're motivated to do what we do.  

B.116:   Oh. 

A.117:   And your motivation was your ski trip?  

B.118:   Yeah, we're just getting into shape for ski trip.

A.119:   Uh-huh.

B.120:   My husband is ...
