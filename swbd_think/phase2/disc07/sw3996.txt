==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, I think that, I think it should be done.

B.2:  You think that, that spot testing for drugs is, is, well, like it said, you
think it should be done, permissible and where do they draw the line?

@A.3:  Yeah, uh, well, I think some places like, not necessarily at McDonald's,
but [laughter] --

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  -- at pla-, at bigger companies.  

B.6:  What's really bad is, you know, that, I work for T I and T I does it.
That's no problem.  I'm, I don't take drugs anyway, I don't have any problem
with that but,

A.7:  [Child_yelling].

B.8:  our own defense system doesn't do it.  

A.9:  [Laughter].  

B.10:  The government doesn't do spot testing -- 

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  -- for, not only for, you know, the F B I and defense systems and
everything else, but they impose it upon the, on the standard public and I
[inhaling], I really don't care one way or the other.  I think it, it, s-,
prevents a lot.  I think guys aren't so willing to take drugs at work anymore
or do drugs and go to work but [sniffing],

A.13:  But, there's a lot that do.  

B.14:  Yeah, yeah, there, well, there, even at T I there was, there was quite a
change when they come out with drug testing.  I think it's a great deterrent.

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  And, uh, I know a girl that works for Town and Country and she had, they
just, they go around and they just pick a store, one store in the city a month
and they go down and did do drug testing on all of its employees, from the
manager all the way down,

A.17:  [Laughter]. 

B.18:  so there's no discriminating there.  

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  You know, they're not, they're, and, even like T I, now T I,

A.21:  [Baby_crying].

B.22:  if you go out and they test you positive for drugs, first they send you to
drug rehab, they don't just throw you out the door and fire you.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  So, you know, they're not out hunting heads.  

A.25:  [Baby_crying].

B.26:  But I think it should be done across the work spectrum.  I don't, I don't
disagree with it.  I think it's a good thing to have, but I think it should be
done across the whole work spectrum.

A.27:  [\Baby_crying].

B.28:  I don't think that one company should do it and the other company not.  I
don't think that T I should necessarily need to do it when the federal
government doesn't, you know and it, it ought to be standardized somewhere.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  Somebody has to, you know, and, and they, we got into a big discussion
about it at work about against, being unconstitutional and against somebody's
privacy rights, but that, you know, I don't want some guy hopped up on drugs
next to me working on a machine.  I --

A.31:  Sure.  

B.32:  -- might get my head cut off.  

A.33:  Yep.  

B.34:  You know.  

A.35:  That's why I think it's good to do -- 

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  -- [Throat_clearing] testing, not only when they get hired, but also
[throat_clearing] along the line sometimes, because a lot of people will have,
have ways of like faking the test or, you know, they just don't do it for a
while to take the test to get the job and then they'll start up again.

B.38:  Yeah, yeah, I seen that, too.  But I agree with it.   

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  You know, I think it should be done.  I think it should be done everywhere.
I don't think it should just be done one company or another.

A.41:  [Baby_crying].

B.42:  You know, like you said, not at McDonald's, but, you know, there's nothing
at McDonald's except a deep fat fryer full of grease that --

A.43:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.44:  -- somebody can stick their hand into, or, you know, [sniffing] I don't
think drugs have, if, if, I have no qualms if they want to take drugs, that's
their problem, it's not mine.

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  But I don't want them around me or near me or working with me
or -- 

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  -- you know, not while they're hopped up.  I don't want a drunk there
either.

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  I don't want some guy in there that's [smack] drunk working next to me
either, so, [sniffing] and they're all drugs so,

A.51:  Yep.  

B.52:  I agree.  I think it should be done.  I think it should be done all the,
everywhere.  I don't think it should be done in one place and not another.  I
think it should be done, I think it should be done every time a person needs
to, well, you know, changing jobs, you have to, to get into T I, you have to
take a urines, urine test anyway, and they --

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  -- won't hire you if you test positive, but once you're there and they,
they, they test you positive, they'll at least send you to drug rehab or some
kind of counseling anyway, and I think it's working, I think it's doing pretty
good job.

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  So,

A.57:  I went down to Wal-Mart a couple of years ago to try to see about a job and
they wanted me to take a drug test.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, most of your major companies do now.  

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  Well, that's good, you know, I, it prevents a lot, it's a great deterrent.

A.61:  Y-,    

B.62:   Whether or not it helps in the long run, nobody knows, but -- 

A.63:   Yep.  

B.64:   -- it works pretty good.  

A.65:   Okay.  

B.66:   All right.  

@@A.67:   Well, thanks for talking.  

B.68:   Uh-huh, nice to talk t-,  

A.69:   Sorry to wake you up, it sounds like I did.  

B.70:   Yeah.  

A.71:   [Laughter]. 

B.72:   You woke me up --

A.73:   Yeah.

B.74:   -- but that's okay.  

A.75:   Okay.  

B.76:   See you later.  

A.77:   Bye-bye.  

B.78:   Bye-bye.
