A.1:  favorite type of music or musician or any.

@B.2:  I don't really have a favorite type.  I like, uh, a lot of different types
of music.

A.3:  Do you?

B.4:  Yeah, I have a, a tape collection that I like to listen to, uh, cassette
tapes --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- but it's pretty varied.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Yeah.  How about you?

A.9:  Oh, I, I'm very, uh, I'm very varied as well.  I, uh, I don't think I've
ever met a type of music I don't like except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy
metal and that.

B.10:  That's exactly me.  The acid rock or the heavy metal.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Even some of that I like okay --

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  -- but not, mostly, as a general rule, I don't care for that at all.

A.15:  Yeah.  I don't enjoy rap too much, either.  That, that doesn't appeal to,
uh, #my ears.#

B.16:  #Well, as far# as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal
to me --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- themselves --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and I like some of their songs.

A.21:  Oh.

B.22:  But as, as I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  But I, I like to listen to, uh, what you might call pop, easy listening --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- country western, jazz [laughter] --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- uh, classical, um, I, I don't, I like, uh, like I said, pretty varied,
uh, music.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  I have a couple that my husband really hates --

A.31:  Oh [laughter].

B.32:  -- [Laughter] that I listen to,

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  like Billy Holiday I really love to listen #to her,# --

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  -- and, uh, I even have a, a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo [laughter] --

A.37:  Oh, gosh.

B.38:  -- and, well, I mean, they're very harmonic --

A.39:  Uh-huh --

B.40:  -- they really are.

A.41:  -- uh-huh, yeah, sure.

B.42:  So, they're interesting to listen to.  You might try that.  How about you?

A.43:  Well, um, I listen to, uh, specific, most, most likely I would be listen
to, uh, jazz or classical music.  Um [throat_clearing], I, in college I took,
uh, four years of classical guitar, and I played in the, in the jazz combo all
four years.  I play guitar --

B.44:  Oh, yeah?

A.45:  -- for the jazz combo.  So, uh, [throat_clearing] that's where my two, my
two listening enjoyments are, but, you know, jazz can get on my nerves after a
while.  Uh, you can't just listen to it, you know, to, uh, especially a lot of
the deeper stuff, you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're.

B.46:  It's too, um, uh, you have to concentrate on it, it seems.

A.47:  Yeah, unless, unless you're playing it, it just, it just doesn't do
anything.

B.48:  [Laughter] What about the blues or something like that?

A.49:  Uh, uh, blues are okay.  I, I tell you, I do like, um, I grew up on blue
grass music.  My dad is a big blue grass fan, and so --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- um, [throat_clearing] I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high
school but, --

B.52:  [Laughter].

A.53:  -- [Laughter] I really do like it a lot.  [sniffing] So.

B.54:  I, I like some of it, um, as far as like the cou-, what they now call
country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it?

A.55:  No, it doesn't, it doesn't.

B.56:  Um, some of it sounds more like pop music.

A.57:  Yeah, uh [sniffing], they've all got, you know, the real screechy electric
guitars now.

B.58:  Oh, n-, yeah, I don't care for that.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  If I'm going to listen to today's country western, I have tapes of like
Randy Travis and Clint Black and --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- I even liked Jim Reeves --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- you know --

A.65:  Yeah, I, I, yeah, I grew up on him.

B.66:  -- or, uh, what, what Merle Haggard --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- and Faron Young --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- that type of country western is --

A.71:  Sure.

B.72:  -- what I, I like to listen to.  Asleep At The Wheel.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  Uh, Sons of the Pioneers, you know, stuff like that.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.76:  #Um,# oh, I like sound tracks a lot.

A.77:  Oh, do you?

B.78:  Yeah, it seems like you get a lot of original music that way.

A.79:  Yeah, you sure do.

B.80:  I mean, you know, think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that --

A.81:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.82:  -- that's just real recent --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- things like that I like to listen to.  Um, I like instrumental things.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  Um, I have some Spiro Gyro tapes.

A.87:  Oh, they're great aren't they.

B.88:  Oh, they're wonderful.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  I love them.  I have some dulcimer music.  I mean, like I
said, that, that's pretty varied.

A.91:  Yeah, it sure is, yeah.

B.92:  Al Jarreau, he's somebody I like.  He's pretty, kind of jazz inspired but
--

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- but still kind of pop, too.

A.95:  Yeah, I like his, he has a nice smooth voice.

B.96:  Oh, yeah, and, you know, what I like the most about him, is, I've gone to
see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun.

A.97:  Yeah, sure.

B.98:  I mean, some people sing, and they have their faced all contorted,

A.99:  [Laughter].

B.100:  like it hurts them or something [laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  But he looks like he's having a good time.  I mean, he's up there moving
around and smiling like he's happy --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- and, and like all he wants to do is, is make the audience
enjoy it, too.

A.105:  Sure.

B.106:  And he, he is real fun to listen to.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Um, Bonnie Rait, I like her a lot.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  Um, in fact, whenever she won her big Grammy --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- I think it was like five of them or something --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- was, was it five, or.

A.115:  Yeah, something like that, it was last, last, last year wasn't it.

B.116:  Yeah, last year or the year before, I can't remember, but, um, I was
listening to a particular radio station and, and the one D J said, who the
heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies?

A.117:  [Laughter].

B.118:  Well, I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that
[laughter] radio station any more, if that D J can make such a
unedu-,
