B.1:  Hi.

A.2:  I'm Brigette.

B.3:  Brigette, I'm Jackie.

A.4:  It's nice to meet you.

B.5:  It's nice to meet you.  Are you, um, well, where are you from?

A.6:  I'm in Lubbock.

B.7:  And what's, where's that?

A.8:  It's in West Texas.

B.9:  Oh, I'm from Wisconsin, Kenosha.

A.10:  Oh, really.

B.11:  Yeah.  I'm not very familiar with Texas.

A.12:  Oh, my gosh.

B.13:  Yeah, I'm far [laughter].

A.14:  Well, is that where you are right now?

B.15:  Yeah, I, I live in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

A.16:  Oh, my gosh, I didn't know I'd get someone that far away.

B.17:  Yeah, I, I've gotten a lot of people from Texas, and they always think,
wow, Wisconsin [laughter].

A.18:  I know, that's like, oh, my gosh.  So we're supposed to talk about music.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  Okay.

B.21:  Okay.

A.22:  I'll push one then.

B.23:  Okay [beep].  

A.24:  Okay.

B.25:  All right.  Well, what kind of music do you like?

@A.26:  Um, I listen to all sorts of music, really, I think.  Uh, I like a lot of
country [laughter].

B.27:  Oh, yeah, is that really popular in Texas --

A.28:  #Um.#

B.29:  -- #or# is that just like a stereotype because it's the south?  [laughter].

A.30:  I think it's pretty popular [laughter].  

B.31:  Is it?

A.32:  I mean, it is probably like yeah, you'd stereotype, but I think it's pretty
popular too.

B.33:  Oh.

A.34:  What kind of music do you like?

B.35:  Um, well, I used to not really like country that much, but I think, well,
my dad really likes it --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- and I'm used to listening to that, and the older I got the more I, you
know, I, I can listen to it, but, um, I prefer, um, um, groups like, I like,
um, Fire House --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- and Slaughter [laughter] --

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  -- and, um, the Scorpio-, um, the Scorpions.

A.42:  So you like more hard rock.

B.43:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.44:  #Yeah.#

B.45:  But I also like the top forty, too --

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  -- and I really like the Oldies station, like, um, fifties music.

A.48:  Really.

B.49:  Yeah, and, and, um, the Doors are pretty good, too.  I can listen to them
and the Who.  I, I really like all kinds.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  (( )).

A.52:  That's how I am, too.  Do you like any rap music?

B.53:  Um, no, that's about the only kind I don't get into, is like rap and like
classical and --

A.54:  Yeah, #I don't# --

B.55:  -- #um# --

A.56:  -- either.

B.57:  -- jazz is all right, but, um, like the Blues and stuff like that, I, I
like to dance, and if it's like a upbeat, you know, good song, then --

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  -- then I'll listen to it, and if I'm out, you know, dancing, then makes it
better to listen to.

A.60:  So you like, mostly like, uh, do you like hard rock the best?

B.61:  Yeah, um, there's this station called The Blaze from Chicago, and that's my
favorite [laughter].

A.62:  Really.

B.63:  Yeah, they play, um, all different kinds of, um, harder rock.

A.64:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm from Dallas --

B.65:  Uh-huh --

A.66:  -- and, uh.

B.67:  -- oh, I've been there.

A.68:  Have you?

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  They have hard rock stations there.  I don't even think they have a hard
rock station in Lubbock [laughter].

B.71:  Oh, really.

A.72:  Pretty sure they don't.

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  If they, if they do, I've never come across it.

B.75:  Uh-huh.

A.76:  But then we have, I mean, they don't have really, it's really small, and,
uh, [clicking] they don't have that really many radio, you know, like top
forty stations, either.

B.77:  Oh, really.

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  Um.

A.80:  It's more like a college town, so.

B.81:  Oh, yeah --

A.82:  Yeah.

B.83:  -- oh, that's neat.

A.84:  Because I'm in college.

B.85:  Uh-huh, me, too.  Yeah.

A.86:  Cool.  So, um, I mean, I don't [laughter] think, gol, if they had a, I
don't think they do have a hard rock station here.

B.87:  Um.

A.88:  See, you don't here very often and you [clicking] never have like bands
come, you never have them like come up to we're up here, you know.

B.89:  Oh, really.  We get a lot like at the bars because, um, we have a lot of,
like, bands that form by themselves, like at, from Milwaukee and Chicago --

A.90:  Oh, really.

B.91:  -- trying to get started, you know --

A.92:  See, that's great.

B.93:  -- (( )).

A.94:  You would never see that here [laughter].

B.95:  Oh, really.

A.96:  No, I don't think you would.

B.97:  I think a lot of music has to do with like, you know, the type of people
you hang around with and especially your environment, like, you know, the
settings, like the bigger cities, you get --

A.98:  Yeah.

B.99:  -- more variety, I think, you know.

A.100:  See, yeah.  See, I think most people listen to country up here --

B.101:  Oh, yeah.

A.102:  -- being it's so far, like in the panhandle of Texas and stuff.

B.103:  Um.  I've gotten to like, um, a couple of songs from Garth Brooks
[laughter].

A.104:  Do you, I know, he's great, I like him a lot.

B.105:  Yeah, I, I just, um, heard of him this year.  My boyfriend, uh, he, uh,
likes some types of country music, and --

A.106:  Uh-huh.

B.107:  -- he was listening to that, and.

A.108:  See I only know very few, too, even.  I mean, I only know like Garth Brooks
and like George Straight, and --

B.109:  Uh-huh.

A.110:  -- a few of the top, the really good guys.  I li-, Garth Brooks, I really
like him.

B.111:  Yeah.

A.112:  He's really good.

B.113:  Yeah, I, I've liked most the songs I heard --

A.114:  Uh-huh.

B.115:  -- so that was good.

A.116:  You have to kind of get used to it, though, because I didn't like #country
western, really.#

B.117:  #Yeah, same here# [laughter].

A.118:  For a while, and even when I came up here, I didn't listen to it until like
last year.

B.119:  Oh, yeah.

A.120:  Then I started listening to it a lot, and then, then you like it a lot.

B.121:  Uh, I just started, um, listening to it, too, because of my boyfriend
[laughter], but yeah, after I heard it a while, at first I didn't like it, and
then I heard it, and then I'm like, oh, this isn't so bad, you know, it's, you
know, upbeat and you know, I got into it and, I saw on T V one time, um, they
were playing Garth Brooks, and they were, um, showing how to country dance to
it --

A.122:  Oh, really [laughter].

B.123:  -- and it looked so fun, because, like I say, I like to dance and --

A.124:  Uh-huh.

B.125:  -- it was just really neat.

A.126:  Oh, yeah, you would like two stepping then.  

B.127:  Yeah, it, it looked fun, and like, oh, I want to learn now [laughter].

A.128:  I know, I wanted to, I want to learn to, because we can do it, but were not
very good.

B.129:  Oh, yeah.

A.130:  We're just like, oh, yeah, we kind of fake it, you know.

B.131:  Oh [laughter].

A.132:  So I want to take lessons because I think that'd be so fun.

B.133:  Yeah.

A.134:  I think,
