==========================================================================

A.1:  Leslie, what kind of pets do you have?

@B.2:  I have, uh, just, uh, one dog.  She's a ten month old puppy.  Um, cocker
spaniel, and, uh, just has been real enjoyable, although I think it's just as
much work having a puppy around as it was a baby, I think.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Oh, is that right?

B.4:  Really, at times.  I know I can just pick up and leave when I need to,
alth-, you know, which is one thing you can't do with a baby, but, um, you
know, she's had to be potty trained and --

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  -- and the whole work.  And, uh, it's just been, it's been nice, though,
because, uh, we used to have a, an older dog, and she died at about the age
eleven --

A.7:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and was our first real baby as such, because we didn't have kids yet,
and, uh, so she was our pride and joy.  And when she, she got sick and died,
it was kind of like an empty hole was in --

A.9:  Oh, sure.

B.10:  -- in our family, because the gir-, our two girls that we now have got real
close to her, and so it was, um, hard, though to replace her.  I think it took
us a couple of years before we replaced her.

A.11:  I was going to ask how long it, it took.

B.12:  Yeah, uh, well, we were in the middle of moving, uh, shortly afterwards
anyway, and we both just didn't feel, my husband and I didn't feel like we
could take on the, the time that it really takes to raise a dog right to, the
first, you know, few months of their life is just as important like it is a
kid, if you want a good dog afterwards.

A.13:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

B.14:  So we waited, and it was about two years before we were emotionally ready
to get back,

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  into that kind of [laughter], um, realm of life.

A.17:  Yes.  It's been, oh, over ten years since I've had a dog.  I used to have a
dachshund --

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  -- and she died, and I just haven't, I haven't been ready to make that
commitment, like you say --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- it's important how you treat the animal.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And, if you, you train them properly, you really have a nice companion.

B.24:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, it takes, our vet probably said seven to nine
months, uh, is the real time you really want to put into them for the
training, as far as the initial training, and he said if you give them just
that much, then the rest of their life with you is just going to be real nice.

A.25:  That's right.

B.26:  And.

A.27:  Uh, did you take the dog to obedience school?

B.28:  No, I never have.  Um, she could do better, I'm sure, on some things, and,
um, I know it's still not to late to do that if I really feel like I need to.
But I just need to give her time, um, you know, working with her, and I know
how to do that pretty much on my own.  It's just a matter of disciplining
myself on making sure we cover a few things, but she knows the real basics.
She's potty trained, and she, uh, comes when we call her and she'll roll over
and she'll sit and she'll put her foot up to shake hands.

A.29:  [Laughter] That's always cute.

B.30:  Yeah, so, I mean, she can do some of the basic things that kind of are
needed and some for just for frills --

A.31:  Yes.

B.32:  -- and, uh, but I don't have her trained when it comes to staying real
good, yet, and, uh, not real well about keeping her from jumping, but I think
some of that's just puppiness, too, that, um, I'm kind of working, just
waiting a little bit to make sure I don't push something too, too hard on her.

A.33:  Yeah.  Did you have pets when you were growing up?

B.34:  Yes, yeah.  Usu-,

A.35:  So that's where you learned to do all this training?

B.36:  Yeah, [laughter] yeah, just started doing it with little pieces of cheese,
and boy, the dogs really, even at the age of ten, I would just still be
teaching them new tricks.  Just as long as you give them something to look
forward to.  I mean, they love the hugs and kisses, but the, the food really
--

A.37:  Oh, yeah.

B.38:  -- seems to meld it all together real fast and,

A.39:  That's right.  Have you ever had a cat?

B.40:  Um, I have for just bits and pieces.  I've never seemed to be too long with
a cat.  When I was a kid they'd always run away [laughter].

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  And then when I was a grownup I was with, living in an apartment as a
college student, and, uh, then I got my own first and only cat, and she was
precious, but when I needed to move back out and back to home, I had to leave
the cat behind.  So, um, I've never had a cat for very long.

A.43:  I had cats as a kid, but I'm, I'm not much of a cat person.  I like to feed
birds --

B.44:  Oh, really.

A.45:  -- and feeding, you know, the, the wild birds --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- that's kind of incompatible with having a cat.

B.48:  Yeah.  [laughter]  Yeah.

A.49:  And it's also incompatible with the neighbors and their cats that they let
run loose all the time.

B.50:  That's right, that's right.

A.51:  I have to happen to think you have a big responsibility when you own a pet
--

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and that is that the world is not your pet's bathroom [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter] That's right, that's right, and cats do seem to have the realm,
the roam of the world, so.

A.55:  Yes, I mean they can get over a six foot fence in a heartbeat.

B.56:  Yeah, yeah.  So, um.  Well, I think you should go back and try to take in a
dog again.

A.57:  Well.

B.58:  You could even go and adopt one that's already past puppyhood, and, uh, if
you.

A.59:  How did you, where did you get your dog, did you go --

B.60:  Well.

A.61:  -- to a pet store?

B.62:  No, a friend of mine had puppies,
