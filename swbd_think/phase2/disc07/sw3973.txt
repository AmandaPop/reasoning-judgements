A.1:  Hi there, (( )).

B.2:  Hi.

A.3:  Uh, been wondering what you've been wearing to work lately.

@B.4:  Well, I tell you what.  My going to work clothes has changed over a period
of years.  I used to work in an office, and I would, and I thought that I
would have to have a lot of clothes, because when you go and work around a lot
of people, for some reason, I just felt the need to have a, a nice variety
and, and look different.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Now, I work in an office in my home, and I'm doing office work, and I go
out and call on people in their homes.  I sell insurance.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So, I could wear the same thing every single day and,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  it really wouldn't make any difference.  #So,# --

A.11:  #That's.#

B.12:  -- and sometimes I do that, and it's just very, very strange and different.

A.13:  That must be nice.

B.14:  It's a different feeling.  I get up, and I, I dress as I would go out to an
appointment, even if I'm going to stay in my office for most of the day or
half of the day.  I just get up and get dressed like I was going, you know,
out.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  But it is this strange feeling to really realize that I really don't need a
large wardrobe --

A.17:  That's right.

B.18:  -- and, um, that I can go and, and I could wear the very same thing every
single day.

A.19:  [Laughter] (( )).

B.20:  How, how do you do?  What?

A.21:  Oh, I usually wear dresses or suits.  I work as an engineer.

B.22:  Yeah, well, I, I wear dresses or suits, too.

A.23:  And mine doesn't really vary that much from season to season.  Uh, I guess
I wear a little less in the summer [laughter] time --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- a little more in the winter --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- you know, or with a suit I, I tend to wear a sweater in the winter --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- as opposed to a blouse in the summertime.

B.30:  Have you always lived in this area?

A.31:  No, no, I grew up in New Mexico, and spent several years in Ohio going to
school.

B.32:  Well, it seems to me like maybe fifteen years ago, I've always lived in
this area, and it seems like about fifteen to twenty years ago, I would see
more of a significant difference in the seasons, and, um, I had a tendency to
really buy wool clothes for the winter and really make a, a definite change --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and it seems like [breathing] the last few years I've had a tendency to,
even though I want to continue that, it's just kind of been a pattern, I have,
I really don't wear my wool clothes any more.  So I've really had to make a
concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and, and, and now most of my
suits will wear all, all year around.

A.35:  Yeah, I think it's, a lot of that is because of the fabrics have changed so
much.

B.36:  Well, I, I, it, I just wonder if it's the fabrics or if, if there's been
that much change in, in, uh, the seasons.  It seems to me like we're not
having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have many years ago.

A.37:  Yeah.  Well, I've been in the Dallas area for about fifteen years, and I
remember some ice storms, and there was nothing you could wear to be warm
enough [laughter].

B.38:  Right [laughter].

A.39:  But, you know, I, I've got all these woolens from Ohio, uh, because, well,
I wore a heavy coat and a scarf and gloves and a hat.  [laughter] #All that
stuff.#

B.40:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.41:  Long underwear when I was [laughter] going to classes.  

B.42:  Right.  [laughter] Well, I just, I had a trip to, uh, Colorado in December,
and I took really, you know, warm clothes, in fact, I bought a down jack, so
that I would have something warm enough, and I didn't need anything, I mean,
it just happened to be the week that I was there it was just really nice and
pleasant.  So, [lipsmack] now I've got a nice, new London Fog down jacket,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  that I'll [laughter] probably never wear [laughter], unless I go back to,
to, uh, Colorado, and the weather's bad.

A.45:  Yeah, well.  

B.46:  I remember who you are, now.

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  Yeah, I've placed you.

A.49:  It's hard sometimes, isn't it [laughter].

B.50:  Right, right.  But that's funny, too, I haven't talked to, as many of these
calls as we've made, I haven't, uh, talked to anybody else in the Altrusa club
before.

A.51:  I have.  I talked to Susan Linnstaedter.

B.52:  Is that right?

A.53:  Yes.

B.54:  I'll be darned.  Well, um.

A.55:  But we didn't get to talk about clothing.

B.56:  Yeah, well, right.  Well, um, I was trying to think of something else that
#we might# --

A.57:  #Well, do you# --

B.58:  -- #talk about# --

A.59:  -- #do you# -- 

B.60:  -- #about clothing.#

A.61:  -- #I was wondering# about when you dress for the day, like if you have a
club meeting that evening, just keep wearing the same thing.  I usually do.

B.62:  Yes, I do too.  I just don't change, uh, and a lot of times I come in and,
in the evenings, and I change directly to, you know, like what I'm sleeping in
and my robe.

A.63:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

B.64:  That's terrible, but I just, it seems like there's only a few hours there,
and I just want to be totally relaxed.  Of course, if I know, uh, if I know I
going to go out or run to the store or something, well I'll just, I'll put on
something, you know, jeans or sweats or something like that, but normally I do
that about three or four times a week, is just come in and [laughter],
