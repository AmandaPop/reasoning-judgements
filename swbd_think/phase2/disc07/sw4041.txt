============================================================================

A.1:  I haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home, but we came close.  Have you
had that experience yet?

B.2:  No, I haven't either, but a lot of my friends, and actually my boss had to
put his mother in a nursing home.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And I know, just going through it with him, I mean, it's a real traumatic
experience.

A.5:  That's for sure and,

B.6:  First just even deciding to do it, and then I think feeling guilty after
you know that it needs to be done, you know.

A.7:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh, yeah, I had a, a good friend who just did it, and, and
my boss, too [laughter].

B.8:  Oh, really?

A.9:  Yeah, and, uh, and, uh, well, both his parents were si-, not doing well,
went to take care of one, and then one of them died and then --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- it was, what do you do with the other person.  It's particularly hard if
they live away.

B.12:  Okay, that's what I was just going to say, if they're out of state, you
know.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  It's different if they're in the same town.  I think you have a little more
chance to look out for them, #but.#

A.15:  #Yeah.#

B.16:  Then, too, if you work, you know, you get, there has to be somebody there.

A.17:  Well, that's a problem, and I, both, uh, my grandmother was ninety-two,
ninety-three when she died --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and she was able to stay in her apartment, but the, but the cost of that
was unbelievable to have the nurses, now I don't know that it would have been
any better in a nursing home, but at that point, it was, you know, uh, she was
old enough that it was like, that's where she, she wanted to die --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- was where she was, not.

B.22:  Oh, oh you mean, not staying at home.

A.23:  Staying at home --

B.24:  And not --

A.25:  -- yeah --

B.26:  -- yeah, yeah.

A.27:  -- not going somewhere else.  I think it's harder if they, if they're
younger, but need a lot of care --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- you know at ninety that's one thing.  At sixty or seventy it's something
else, and you.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, well that's it, because, gee they've got probably a good twenty
years to live --

A.31:  Right, right.

B.32:  -- in some cases if they're healthy, you know.

A.33:  Right, exactly, and if the, and, and yet if the care is just, is just so
hard, then that's, you know, that's really hard, and I don't know what, you
know, what the different things that you would look for, now obviously, uh,
you want it to be cl-, you know.

B.34:  It would be clean, yeah.

A.35:  Clean, and that, that it's got a good reputation as far as health, et
cetera, but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference.

B.36:  I know, and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep
everybody, like, that can, you know, to be involved instead of just leaving
them sit in their room --

A.37:  Yes, yes --

B.38:  -- you know.  

A.39:  -- that's the picture you always see of people --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- just sitting in the halls.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Oh.

B.44:  In fact I used to date a guy, that reminds me, when I was back in
Minneapolis, but his mother, I mean, he had, she ended up I guess getting it
Al-, what they now #call Alzheimer's. Yeah.#

A.45:  #Alzheimer's.  Yeah.#

B.46:  But to begin with, you know, when they first, I mean, she would know us,
you know, and we'd go to visit her, but then, it would get, you know, like she
didn't really know, she didn't know me --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and then she thought he was a brother, you know --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- and it just got steadily worse, you know.

A.51:  Well, I, that's the thing, I mean, when it's something like that, I, I
think it particularly, if it's something like that, and they really don't know
where they are --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- it doesn't feel, I would think that would be easier than someone who
really does know and is saying, I do-,

B.54:  And has been independent all their lives --

A.55:  Exactly.

B.56:  -- and then all of a sudden, you know.

A.57:  And I, you know, I don't, I don't want to go, kind of thing, but the other
side of it is that my grandmother moved out of her home and into an apartment
of elderly people, but it is --

B.58:  Um.

A.59:  -- was not a nursing home --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and that's where she died --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- but she lived there for ten or twelve years, and she did, she really
went through like a depression for about a year --

B.64:  Just getting #used to it.#

A.65:  -- #moving out of# her home.  

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  But then, she said, well, she says, course this is so wonderful, because
all I have to do is open my door,

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  you know, go out the hall --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and down stairs to the place to eat, or down stairs to the lobby --

B.72:  Oh.

A.73:  -- and there're people there --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- which in her home, you know, there weren't.  I mean, the logistics of it
become so difficult that she said, I, I've really made some friends, and that
feels good.  So that's the other side of it is.

B.76:  Well, that, yeah, would definitely be a positive part, because they'd be
around more people --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and would be --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- easier for them to get and to see those people, I guess.

A.81:  Yeah, but, but it's just that, you know, how do you, I guess unless you
visit a lot and unexpectedly, and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly.

B.82:  Well, I would think that you ought to be, in fact, I was going to say that,
I would go at different times of the day, not only when they're expecting you
to come --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- you know, just to see how, you know, at different time of the day what
they do and how they treat them, you know.

A.85:  Exactly, and how everything looks and, and then, and then the other thing
is really listen to what they say, because, and that's another hard thing, uh,
you know if the, as people get older we, we all seem to, uh, fuss just a
little bit more about everything --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- so then the question is, Is their fussing legitimate or not?

B.88:  Or, is it just because, yeah, they're having such a #hard time# --

A.89:  #Uh-huh.#

B.90:  -- adjusting, you know.

A.91:  So that will tell you, well, she says she doesn't like the food, but you
should see her plate, you know, or some.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  So then I guess you'd have to be there to be sure that, that's,
