B.1:  Hello.

A.2:  (( )) I pressed the button one, so we're recording right now.  I'm sorry
[laughter].

B.3:  That's okay.  I'm Bill from Raleigh.

A.4:  Okay, and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.

B.5:  Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.

A.6:  Yeah.  [laughter] Um, okay, Bill, we're talking about family reunions.

B.7:  Right.

A.8:  Okay, um, have you ever had to plan a family reunion?

@B.9:  Uh, yes and no, it wasn't really a fa-, a planning one, but it was kind
of, uh, it was a birthday --

A.10:  Oh.

B.11:  -- and I brought a lot of family together then.

A.12:  Uh-huh.  And how did you feel it went?

B.13:  It went pretty good.  I'm, I've worked in hotels, so I, I kind of know how
to do these things.

A.14:  Oh.

B.15:  I used to, you know.

A.16:  All this planning and, and getting together and such.  Um, oh, let's see
what else.

B.17:  Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's
birthday, and --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family.  She has like
seven sisters I think.

A.20:  Oh, boy [laughter].

B.21:  They show up and all their kids.  And then all, she has, uh, I have like,
uh, let's see, she has four sons and two daughters, and --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- they show up and all their kids, so it's a pretty big reunion, it's
about two hundred people, maybe.

A.24:  Oh, my word.  [laughter] Well, what did you find was most helpful in
planning the birthday get together?

B.25:  Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone,
you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we
rented like a, a rescue squad building or something --

A.28:  Oh.

B.29:  -- like that.

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for
the rent and for, for like soft drinks and --

A.32:  Oh.

B.33:  -- and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.

A.34:  Oh, that's good.

B.35:  And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.

A.36:  Uh-huh, and then did you have a main meal, or did everyone just bring, it
#was just pot luck.#

B.37:  #It was kind of# pot luck.

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.

A.40:  Yeah, yeah, show off a little bit [laughter].

B.41:  Yeah.  And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first --

A.42:  Oh.

B.43:  -- because she's such a great cook.

A.44:  Oh.  Now how old is she?

B.45:  Uh, she's eighty-six.

A.46:  Oh, goodness.  Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.

B.47:  Now she does, she looks probably like she's in her early sixties --

A.48:  Oh, wow.

B.49:  -- and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better --

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  -- than me as a matter of fact [laughter].

A.52:  Oh.  [laughter] Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at
that age.  Yeah.

B.53:  Oh, yeah.  My nickname for her is Honey Woman.  That's what I call her.

A.54:  Really.  [laughter] Well that sounds fun.  Well, I [smack] I had a real
challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago, and there were, we
sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large,
like your, your family there.  And so that was a real challenge, and I was
president of our family reunion for two years, and I wasn't very (( )) at that
duty, for two years in a row, [laughter] but I found that advance planning was
the key to success.

B.55:  Uh, also one thing that's helpful, and I don't know if your family's spread
out or whatever --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- but most of, all my family lives like in the same county so [laughter],

A.58:  Oh, that's wonderful, though [laughter].

B.59:  But it's just kind of like get on the telephone and,

A.60:  [Laughter].

B.61:  it's so and such days from such and such date --

A.62:  Oh.

B.63:  -- and everybody just shows up.

A.64:  Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.  Yeah, our family ranges from, oh,
goodness, well, Australia, I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise,
Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.

B.65:  I would say you're spread out, then.

A.66:  We are [laughter].

B.67:  Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and
sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever, because
my dad was in the Army and we're --

A.68:  Oh.

B.69:  -- we're pretty strung out all over.  But since they've moved back to
Carolina's, we still are the only ones do not live in --

A.70:  In.

B.71:  -- in Yantsen County.

A.72:  Oh.

B.73:  I live in Raleigh, and then my, my parents live in Greenville, and I have
one brother and his wife --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of
Fayetteville.  So I mean, we're, we're spread out, but --

A.76:  Boy.

B.77:  -- everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro so.

A.78:  Oh, my gosh.

B.79:  Nobody moves away except us [laughter].

A.80:  [Laughter] They must really like it there.

B.81:  Yeah, I got out as soon as I graduated.

A.82:  Yeah.  [laughter]  Oh.

B.83:  Just like this town is too small for me, Good-bye.

A.84:  Oh, [laughter] you're ready to move on to bi-,
