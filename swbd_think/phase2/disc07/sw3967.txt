========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, do you have any pets?

@B.2:  Yes, I do.  Uh, uh, in fact, I'm living with three cats at the moment.
Uh, one of them is mine, one of them is my daughter's, and one of them is, um,
partially mine and partially hers, I guess.

A.3:  Uh.  

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  Uh, so, um, I, I'm, and I'm an absolute nut about cats.  Um, I didn't, I
used to have dogs and cats, um, and, uh, the dogs have died, and those
original cats have died, and we've taken these on, and, uh, I, I just love
them.  I think they're [laughter] wonderful.  What about you?

A.7:  We have, uh, one dog.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  No kids and one dog, so, um, we.

B.10:  What, what kind of dog?

A.11:  We have a Golden Retriever.

B.12:  Oh, we, that's what we had.

A.13:  Oh, really.

B.14:  Yeah, we loved them.  

A.15:  Yeah, she's a mess #[laughter].#

B.16:  #Yeah,# they, uh, we had, as I say, two, and then, uh, gave, uh, the kids'
grandparents one, and they got another one, and so, I mean, there've been four
sort of in the family around.

A.17:  Wow.

B.18:  They're sweet dogs.

A.19:  Yeah, they, I mean, they go through a, a terror, a time [laughter].

B.20:  Yeah.  How old?

A.21:  Um, she's, let's see, I guess she's about eleven months.

B.22:  Oh, well, yes, you sti-, --

A.23:  So she's,

B.24:  -- you're still at the puppy stage.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And they say they stay puppies for a couple of years --

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  -- so.

B.30:  You're right.

A.31:  Um, but she, you know, we took her through obedience school back when, at
four, four or five months --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and then we had her fixed at around seven months --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- because I couldn't handle her.

B.36:  Being in heat and all that, yeah.

A.37:  Yes, I was so worried the whole time that --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- you know, a dog was going to jump the fence --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- and we decided that we weren't going to breed her and, and stuff,
because there, we felt there were enough dogs and,

B.42:  Right, and that's true --

A.43:  And, uh.

B.44:  -- all ours are fixed, too.  

A.45:  So, um, we went ahead and had her fixed --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- [Laughter] while she was in heat [laughter] --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- and, um, but she's, she's pretty smart, although she, you know, she gets
angry, and she's just like a child when she, um, oh, if she's so into what
she's doing, you know, she won't listen to you, listen to a --

B.50:  Oh, really.

A.51:  -- listen to a command.  Well, like, um, okay, I'm trying to think of an
example.  If we're sitting on the couch and she wants to play with you, and
you say, No, you know, off --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and then she'll come and stick one paw up, and then you take her paw and
set it off.  Well, she starts doing it, and she gets frustrated that you're
telling her No, so it turns into this, this, uh, almost a fight.  You know,
it's like, you can't tell me that [laughter].

B.54:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.55:  #You know,# so she starts losing her patience, and then we lose our
patience.

B.56:  What does she do when she loses her patience?

A.57:  Um.

B.58:  I mean, does she bite or bark or,

A.59:  No, she bites a lot, but I mean it's, sometimes it's, it's not angry, but
sometimes it is.

B.60:  Oh, that's unusual --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- because they don't usually bite.

A.63:  Yeah.  They, well she's real mouthy --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and that's one thing I think with being retrievers is, um, you know,
everything goes into their mouth, and --

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  -- and she just wants attention --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- but she gets angry that you're not giving her the attention --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and then when you, you know, like, like she goes and steals things --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- um, oh, we have to keep the doors to our bedrooms closed, and she'll go
in and, if she gets in there she'll go in and pick a teddy bear off this
little rocking chair.

B.74:  Oh, really?

A.75:  And she'll bring it in and she'll kind of show it to, she'll stand there
until you see her, and then as soon as you see her, she takes off.  And it's
like, come get me.

B.76:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, ours didn't do that.  Ours were much quieter, but I
had, I did have a child at the time --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- and so it may be that the child was sort of all this other stuff (( )).

A.79:  Yeah, I think so, and also --

B.80:  Oh.

A.81:  -- having other dogs --

B.82:  Yes.

A.83:  -- or having other animals.

B.84:  We, we, we have found that with, with all of our pets is that we, we've
never had just one, because we somehow feel like they need another one.  I
don't know if that's a human thought, and not an animal thought, [laughter] or
what.

A.85:  No, I think it's a animal thought, too --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- because they do tend to be pack dogs, you know --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- and they --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- because she loves, we have a neighbor down the street that has a dog,
and, um, we, there's lots of dogs in our neighborhood, but the one down the
street, she just goes crazy over.  I mean, you'd think that that dog was
Elvis, or something --

B.92:  Yeah, yeah.

A.93:  -- she just goes hog wild over that dog, and, and, um, they have a lot of
fun together, but she doesn't do that with other dogs.  It's just that one --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- one friend.

B.96:  Yeah, well, and I, I think they, they can be territorial, so you, you know,
have to, maybe some of them they're more comfortable with than others but,

A.97:  But, we did get her, though, because we'd heard that they were good with
kids, so.

B.98:  Oh, then, and then they are.  I mean, my son would just, you know, and
you've heard the stories, I'm sure, but, you know, everything from using his
little wooden hammer on her head to all sorts of things, and, um, she would
just move over, you know --

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  -- and that was, that was the worst that ever happened,
