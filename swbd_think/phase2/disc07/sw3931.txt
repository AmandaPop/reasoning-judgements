B.11:  Yes, #that's right.#  

A.12:  #Okay.#  

B.13:  Are you watching David Letterman's show right now?  

A.14:  No, is it on?  

B.15:  Oh, they're having a special on and they're just doing a thing about pet

A.16:  #Oh, (( )) really?#  [laughter]  How appropriate [laughter]. 

B.17:  Really [laughter]. 

A.18:  Oh, great.  Okay.  So are you ready for me to push one?  

B.19:  Sure.  

A.20:  Okay [beep]. 

B.21:  Do you have a pet?  

@A.22:  Um, yes, right now I have a puppy.

B.23:  Oh, what kind of puppy?  

A.24:  It's an Australian shepherd.  Do you know what that is?  

B.25:  Oh, are they big she-, 

A.26:  #Yeah.# 

B.27:  #like# big shepherds?  

A.28:  Uh-huh.  It's a herding dog.  

B.29:  Oh.  

A.30:  Do you know these are a whole bunch of different colors?  

B.31:  Oh, yes, I do and sometimes,

A.32:  [Noise].

B.33:  they have one blue eye and one black or brown eye.  

A.34:  He did when he was little but they both changed to brown.  

B.35:  Oh, okay.  

A.36:  He did have one blue one though when he was a lot younger.  

B.37:  Do you live in the country?  

A.38:  [Noise]  Uh, no, I don't.  

B.39:  #Oh.#

A.40:  #I# go to school at Tech.  

B.41:  Oh, okay.  So you just have him just because you like that kind of a dog.

A.42:  Yeah.  It's different [laughter]. 

B.43:  Yeah.  We used to, I grew up, where I grew up we had collies and I,

A.44:  #Oh, really?#  

B.45:  #lived# in the country.  We had cattle and,

A.46:  Oh, great.  

B.47:  But my husband is a hunter so we,

A.48:  [Noise].

B.49:  now have a hunting dog.  It's, um, an English Springer Spaniel.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  And she's a water dog and, um, she's a, uh, flusher.  She's not a retriever
but --

A.52:  Oh, that's great.  

B.53:  -- she spends most of her time in the house.  

A.54:  [Laughter].  

B.55:  She's pretty spoiled [laughter]. 

A.56:  So does ours [laughter].  He likes that quite a bit [laughter].

B.57:  Yes.  

A.58:  Do you have any other pets?  

B.59:  Yeah, we have a cat too.  Just an old farm cat.  She's a gray black tabby.

A.60:  Uh-huh.  

B.61:  And she's going to be thirteen years old,

A.62:  #Oh, my gosh.#  

B.63:  #here# [laughter] in April.  

A.64:  Goll, that's great.  

B.65:  Yeah.  But she still plays and, you know,

A.66:  #That's good.# 

B.67:  #she's# pretty healthy.  So --

A.68:  Good.  

B.69:  -- hopefully she'll be around for a while.  She's become quite the part of
the family [laughter].

A.70:  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  That's a long time for a cat too.

B.71:  Yeah.  So how old is your puppy?  

A.72:  Um, he's just getting ready to be six months.  

B.73:  #Oh.# 

A.74:  #Thank# goodness [laughter].  

B.75:  They are so fun when they're little like,

A.76:  #Yeah.# 

B.77:  #that though.# 

A.78:  They are.  He has a lot of energy.  A lot.  He wears me out. 

B.79:  Oh.  What made you decide to get a puppy?  

A.80:  Um, my boyfriend really talked about it and he was like I'm going to get
you one.  I was like you are not.  [laughter] Well, he did.

B.81:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.82:  [Laughter]  So it's kind of I guess our dog.

B.83:  Oh, ((that's)) nice.  #It's nice to have them around.#

A.84:  #Yeah, I like him a lot.#  

B.85:  Do you live in the apartment alone?  

A.86:  Yes, I do.  

B.87:  So it's nice to have the dog there.  

A.88:  Yeah.  See it really is and then like he-, he'll take him, um, he's from
San Antonio and he'll take him like to San Antonio for the weekend sometime
and then it's like so quiet in the house.  It's so weird.

B.89:  Oh.  

A.90:  It's like, oh, my gosh, my apartment is so quiet.   

B.91:  Yeah.  

A.92:  It's like you're just so used to the dog being around and stuff.

B.93:  I know it.  That's nice to have something to come home to.  When my husband
moved down here, he moved here a couple months before us because we had to
get, you know, the house sold and everything,

A.94:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.95:  #and he# was so lonely.  

A.96:  Oh, gosh.  

B.97:  Because he, you know, we, we were twelve hours away --

A.98:  Oh, my go-, 

B.99:  -- that we almost sent the cat with him because, 

A.100:  [Laughter]. 

B.101:  that way he would have something to come,  

A.102:  #Yeah, really.# 

B.103:  #home to.# 

A.104:  Uh-huh.  

B.105:  He was in a little apartment, you know, and -- 

A.106:  Uh-huh.  

B.107:  -- got real lonesome so [lipsmack] I think that's nice to have animals.  I
think they make you feel like you're loved and, 

A.108:  Yeah, I do too.  I love cats.  

B.109:  Oh, yes.  

A.110:  I have a cat, uh, my parents have a cat and I love our cat. 

B.111:  [Laughter].

A.112:  [Laughter] I think the cat is great.  I wish we, I wish I could get a cat
for, to be with this dog to get some energy out so he can play with the cat
[laughter].

B.113:  Well, that's a good idea.  

A.114:  Yeah.  I don't know if I could handle two of them, 

B.115:  #Oh [laughter].#

A.116:  #running# around though [laughter]. 

B.117:  What kind of a cat do you have at home?  

A.118:  Um, it's a calico.   

B.119:  Huh.  

A.120:  Yeah.  

B.121:  Those are nice.  They're so pretty.  

A.122:  I know.  Cats are so, I love cats.  They're so cute because you really
don't have to mess with them a whole bunch but you can if you want to.  You
know?

B.123:  That's right.  Cats are my first choice too.  

A.124:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.125:  I have always had one every since I was little.  

A.126:  Really?  

B.127:  And they've always just been, you know, nothing special but --

A.128:  Uh-huh.  

B.129:  -- jeez, I've had all colors and longhair, short hair, and no hair and
[laughter], 

A.130:  Yes.  I'm, I wo-, I don't know, I would prefer a cat over a dog I think.

B.131:  Yeah.  

A.132:  Just because i-, I mean this dog is a lot of work [laughter].

B.133:  [Laughter]  They are and you have to let them in and out and,

A.134:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.135:  #and# if you go somewhere, you have to have someone take care of them and
--

A.136:  Yep.   

B.137:  -- not that I would ever give her up but [laughter],

A.138:  I know.  I wouldn't either.  We're complaining but I would never give mine
up either.

B.139:  Oh.  But if I get another kitty I decided I wanted to get a ((main coon))
cat.  Have you ever seen those?

A.140:  Huh-uh.  What is that?   

B.141:  They're like a, a, stripes cat only they're huge.  

A.142:  [Noise].

B.143:  They're like, 

A.144:  #Really?# 

B.145:  #a small# dog [laughter].

A.146:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.147:  And they're real pretty.  

A.148:  Really?  How big do they get?  Like how much do they weigh, do you think?

B.149:  Oh, boy.  Let's see.  I'm trying to guess.  They get as big as like a small
poodle.

A.150:  Oh, really?
