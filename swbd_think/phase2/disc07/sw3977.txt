A.1:  Hi.

B.2:  Hi.  I'm Bill from Raleigh.

A.3:  I'm Brigette.  I'm in Lubbock.

B.4:  Where's that at?

A.5:  It's up in West Texas.

B.6:  West Texas, okay.

A.7:  Up in the panhandle [laughter].

B.8:  Your the first person I talked to from Texas.  I've been getting phone
calls from all over the country.

A.9:  Have you really?

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  That's great.

B.12:  Washington state, and Oregon, and I forgot where all else.  Pennsylvania,
New York.

A.13:  Golly, I wish I would get [laughter].  I always get people from Texas.

B.14:  I, I, I's, I never call anybody, [laughter] I just let them call me.

A.15:  Do you?  That's probably why.  I always call.  I figure it's easier that
way --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- than trying to catch me at home.  Okay, are you ready for me to push
one?

B.18:  Sure.

A.19:  Okay [beep].

B.20:  Okay, what kind of exercise do you do, or do you do any?

@A.21:  Um, I do some, not a lot.  [laughter] I'm kind of lazy.  Um,

B.22:  Well, I am too, I'm a couch potato.

A.23:  Yeah, I know how that is.  I do play like racquetball a lot.  That's fun.
#I like that the best.#

B.24:  #I've never played racquetball.#

A.25:  You haven't?

B.26:  No.

A.27:  Well, I'm in college, and I took it as a class --

B.28:  Oh. 

A.29:  -- like last semester, and I just loved it.  I thought it was great, it's
really a lot of fun.  It's not real hard.  Now I'm taking like weight
training, and I hate it.  It's so dumb.

B.30:  I've tried weight training.  I just, I just can't get into it.

A.31:  Really.

B.32:  No, it.

A.33:  It seems so pointless.

B.34:  And, it, well, I don't like having the sore muscles.  I like to r-, jog.

A.35:  Do you?

B.36:  Yeah, I, I used to jog about six miles a day and then I --

A.37:  Oh, my gosh.

B.38:  -- I tore the ligaments in my ankle so I, I don't really run that much, but
I, I, I jog some, about a mile or so now --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- when I have time [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah, I now.  I'm not real into like aerobics are anything like that.  I
only exercise when I have to [laughter].

B.42:  Yeah, that's --

A.43:  I mean.

B.44:  -- that's basically me.

A.45:  You know.  I'm kind of, I'm really bad about it.

B.46:  I'm, I'm, I exercise more in the summer and spring than I do, um, like this
time of year because --

A.47:  Yeah, when the #weather's nicer.#

B.48:  -- #it's too cold here [laughter].#

A.49:  Is it really?

B.50:  Yeah, well, I, I, I think forty degrees is too cold [laughter], so.

A.51:  Yeah, [laughter] little cold for you.  I know, that's the way I am too,
because I, I love going outside and stuff when it's warmer and stuff, but
otherwise I won't, I mean, I won't go work out or I won't jog, I won't go
outside.  I'll just stay at home, you know, on the couch watching T V or
renting movies or something.

B.52:  Yeah, that's, that's basically what I do.  I like, I like to, um, to walk,
too.  I guess, they said it's a good form of exercise.  I guess, uh --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- if you consider that exercise, I walk a lot.

A.55:  Do you?

B.56:  But I, I have such a normal fast pace, [laughter] -- 

A.57:  It's, it's --

B.58:  -- so I don't rea-, I don't really think it's [laughter],

A.59:  -- it's not (( )) or it could be your exercise for the week, right.

B.60:  Right.  I, I mean, I, I've always walked fast, so, I don't know, I need to
get on some kind of exercise program, though, because I'm, I'm starting to
gain weight.  I'm getting at that age where [laughter] --

A.61:  Oh, listen to you.

B.62:  -- (( )) just start putting on the pounds.

A.63:  Uh-huh. [cough] {person in background} It'll catch up with you.

B.64:  Yeah, it, it, it has caught up with me in the past year or so.  I've put on
about twelve pounds so.

A.65:  Really.

B.66:  I need to work and get it off.  I thought about doing a diet, but I really
don't need to diet.  I just need to --

A.67:  Exercise?

B.68:  -- exercise, I think [laughter].

A.69:  Yeah, it sort of, it does make you feel better, though, I have to admit
that, you know.

B.70:  When I get off work, I usually come home and fix dinner and watch T V and
then --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- I'm tired, I take a nap, whatever [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah, see after work, I don't know, (( )) I think if I worked all day
there's no way I would do [laughter] anything.

B.74:  Oh, well, I work eight to five so, I mean.

A.75:  Yeah, so then when you're home, you're like, okay, I just want to relax and
not think about work, and definitely not exercise.  You want to eat
[laughter].

B.76:  That's right.  I do accounting, and, and it's on a computer all day, and
I'm so brain dead when I get off work, it's kind of like just don't even talk
to me.  Just let me sit here and vegetate.

A.77:  You're probably drained, and probably exercising probably wouldn't help.

B.78:  Well, I don't, I don't know.  They say once you get in a routine of
exercising it gives you a lot more ener-, energy.  I know when I ran, um, I
kind of got like addicted to it.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  You know, you see these people, um --

A.81:  That have to do it.

B.82:  -- I never was die hard, you know, they, they had a story on the news about
people becoming addicted just like, uh, people that do drugs, it's, it's a
high for them.

A.83:  Yeah, I've heard that.

B.84:  I've got a coup-, uh, uh, a real good friend that I went to school with
lives here too.  She works for the News and Observer, and she's the one who
got me started running in, in college.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  I was never die hard like she was, it was, we had a sleet storm and she was
outside running in that --

A.87:  Oh, my gosh.

B.88:  -- icicles hanging down and all this other kind of stuff, and I, I told her
she was crazy, but --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- she runs about thirteen miles now.

A.91:  Oh, my gosh.

B.92:  She's really training, and I, when we were in college, we both chain smoked
like freight trains [laughter] --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- and she would get out and run every day, and it never would bother her
or, it's like --

A.95:  Um.

B.96:  -- it won't bother me, and her husband made her, after she got married her
husband made her stop, so.

A.97:  Really.

B.98:  So now she's just like --

A.99:  That'd be like.

B.100:  -- channeling all of her energy into running now.

A.101:  Yeah.  That's good, though, but I just, go-,
