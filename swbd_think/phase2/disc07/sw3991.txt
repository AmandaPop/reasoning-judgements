B.1:  Hi, I'm Susan Linnstaedter.

A.2:  Where you calling from?

B.3:  Uh, I'm in Dallas.  

A.4:  Okay, all right, so am I.  [laughter] Okay, you understand the topic?

B.5:  Uh, yeah, uh-huh.

A.6:  Okay, I going to hit the button.  [beep] So what do you think about the
death penalty?

@B.7:  Uh, well, huh, I've mixed feelings, I guess you'd say.  It's, it's not
something that, uh, I mean, you know, it doesn't make me happy --

A.8:  Uh-huh

B.9:  -- but, uh, on the other hand, you know, the present alternatives, at least
in Texas --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- are not real good.  I mean it's an all or nothing proposition.  You know
--

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- you either, you either, uh, give somebody a death penalty or they're out
on the streets in a very short time to, uh, have a repeat performance of
whatever they did.

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  Um, and I guess, I, you know, I guess I should mention I'm an attorney --

A.16:  Oh.

B.17:  -- and I used to do some criminal work, and, um --

A.18:  Um.

B.19:  -- but as long as it's reserved for special purposes and that's why --

A.20:  For psychopathic killers and stuff.

B.21:  -- as, as, you know, the judicial process that's afforded to someone pretty
much, you know, makes you feel good about that you've got the right guy --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- then I guess I, I can live with it.

A.24:  Uh-huh.  Well, what'd you think about Jeffrey Dahlmer now?

B.25:  Uh, I haven't been keeping up with that.  I've been in and out of, of town
and I haven't kept up with it.

A.26:  Well.

B.27:  What's happening to him?

A.28:  Well, he got fifteen life sentences --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- for, uh.

B.31:  So they went ahead and ruled him --

A.32:  Sane.

B.33:  -- at least legally sane --

A.34:  Right.

B.35:  -- to stand trial.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  Okay.

A.38:  So, okay, so he can get up to fifteen life sentences, and, uh, with no
chance for parole, but, uh.

B.39:  See, we don't have that in Texas, that's the problem --

A.40:  Um.

B.41:  -- is you can't give somebody life without parole, at least at this point.

A.42:  Uh-huh.  Well, huh, that's not very good.  [laughter]

B.43:  No, I mean, you know, a life sentence, they get time and a half for, um,
time served --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- and if they get made a trusty they get good time --

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  -- um, which is like two, two days for every day they serve --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  Um.

B.49:  -- and they can really be out, or eligible for parole in a fairly short
space of time.

A.50:  Now what's, uh, what is a life term, if someone gets a life term, what's
the earliest they can get out?

B.51:  I want to say, uh, you know, they've changed things since I used to, since
I used to practice that kind of work --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- but I think that somebody told me that [beep] within ten or twelve years
they would be, um, eligible for parole.

A.54:  Uh.

B.55:  I mean, it's not very long.

A.56:  Uh-huh.  Well, now, I know, in, uh, in Virginia, I think it's about the
same, I want to say each life term, you're eligible for parole within fifteen
years --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- and, uh, I knew, um,

B.59:  Well, see, also in Texas --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- it's real unusual for them to do what they call stack them, stack the
penalties.

A.62:  Oh.

B.63:  They, they will, they will cause the penalties to run concurrently.

A.64:  Oh, okay, they should make consecutive, I don't like this concurrent stuff
[laughter].

B.65:  Yeah, I mean, on, on something like a, like a Jeffrey Dahlmer or somebody
like that, you know, that definitely, I mean, you know, why go through the
farce of having a parole hearing.

A.66:  Right.

B.67:  You know what's going to happen if you let him out, I mean, we-, and in
Texas, too, I mean, I, smaller states like Vermont, uh, and places like that
have some real innovative rehabilitation type activities that they can do in
their penal system.

A.68:  Right.

B.69:  And, in a, in a state like Texas we don't have that.

A.70:  Um.

B.71:  They get down there, we are warehousing people, basically --

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  -- and they go down there, and they maybe pick up a few tricks, you know,

A.74:  [Laughter].

B.75:  how to be worse, and, uh, and then you turn them loose on society, and I
just don't think that that's, I don't think that's right, I don't think that's
fair.

A.76:  See, that's what, what I don't like is warehousing, you know --

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  -- I mean, if you make them useful, you know, put them in jail and make
them do something, you know, I don't know, make license plates, you know,
[laughter].

B.79:  Something, yeah.

A.80:  I mean, it, to me, uh, for me to pay, I mean, what does it cost, uh, per
year to, uh, to keep, uh, an inmate, I think they said it's something like
eighteen thousand dollars --

B.81:  Uh, it's a lot.

A.82:  -- per person is, is what we were paying per inmate.  That's a lot of money
--

B.83:  Yeah.

A.84:  -- you know, I mean, some people don't even make that much money a year,
you know.

B.85:  Uh-huh. 

A.86:  And I think.

B.87:  Well, and if you consider the fact that with, with all the, the federal
lawsuits that went on and --

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  -- all the standards that there are for how you can and cannot treat
prisoners --

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  -- and, and what they're entitled to have --

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  -- frankly, you know, it's considered cruel and inhumane for a prisoner at
the state penitentiary to live in conditions that would look pretty attractive
to some of the homeless people who have not committed a crime --

A.94:  Yeah, yeah.

B.95:  -- you know, I mean, we just, our system is, is, is kind of skewed, somehow
or another --

A.96:  Yeah.

B.97:  -- and like I say, I mean, you know, I ca-, I can't tell you I feel good
about the fact that we put people to death --

A.98:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.99:  -- I mean, I really, you know, deep down, I guess that both-,
