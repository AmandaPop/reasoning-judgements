A.1:  Okay, this subject is magazines.  What do you like and what do you dislike
about magazines?

@B.2:  Well, I like them because I can read them at my convenience and I don't
like a lot of the ads I get, and especially those stupid cards that fall out
of them all the time.

A.3:  That's my main complaint on magazines, too, and I get magazines, some of
them are just pictures and advertisements.  Uh, LIFE magazine is like that.  I
quit subscribing to that.  It's just, uh, magazine, I mean, pictures and, uh,
advertisements.  What is your favorite magazine?

B.4:  Oh, I like the magazines like, uh, the home remodeling magazines like HOME,
or DECORATING AND REMODELING, things like that because you can see what other
people are doing with their houses and maybe you could do it in yours.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  You like to do remodeling in your home?  

B.6:  Yeah, we've learned how to do a lot of things on our own.  

A.7:  For instance, what are you doing now, anything in particular? 

B.8:  Uh, no, not right now.  Uh, I haven't gotten any magazines that have shown
me anything lately.  What other kind of magazines do you like?

A.9:  Well, I like READERS' DIGEST.  We get that and my husband subscribes to
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.  I think he's a frustrated doctor.

B.10:  [Laughter]. 

A.11:  Because he, uh, reads constantly.  We have a person in our area that, uh,
his little girl was diagnosed as, as terminal and, uh, he came across an
article about leukemia, so he had me fix up the, make copies of it and give it
to them and tell them that there's hope for her and all this.

B.12:  Um, how many different kinds of magazines do you subscribe to? 

A.13:  Well, right now I, I dropped PEOPLE, but we have, uh, BETTER HOMES AND
GARDENS, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, and, uh, uh, what's the other one, I think it's
LADIES' HOME JOURNAL or REDBOOK, something like that.

B.14:  I used to get PEOPLE, but it cost too much, so I had to quit taking it.

A.15:  Did you enjoy it?  

B.16:  Uh, sometimes they'd have good articles, but a lot of it was kind of, uh, a
lot of fluff and not a lot of substance and it, and, like I said, it costs a
lot of money because I think they came every week or something like that so it
was a lot higher than a monthly magazine.

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  My husband likes to,

A.19:  [Throat_clearing] {faint}.

B.20:  read sports and fishing magazines all the time.  That's pretty boring to
me.

A.21:  Do you get those as subscriptions?  

B.22:  Oh, he gets one, to, uh, fishes, um, what's it called, FIELD AND STREAM,
that's what he gets.

A.23:  Um.  

B.24:  But that's the only one.  But he'd get more if he could.  

A.25:  When my husband was younger, he liked OUTDOOR LIFE.  He thought that was a
pretty good magazine.

B.26:  I don't think I've ever seen that one.  

A.27:  I don't know, my,

B.28:  I don't know if they still do it or not.  

A.29:  It might not be, because it's been a while.  

B.30:  You know what I really hate about magazines -- 

A.31:  What's that?  

B.32:  -- is those smelly cards that have perfume -- 

A.33:  With the -- 

B.34:  -- or cologne.  

A.35:  -- scratch and sniffs.  

B.36:  Well, the ones are, they're not scratch and sniff anymore.  The, the kind
I'm talking about, you open it up and the fragrance is just there.  It's like
a fold that's --

A.37:  Oh. 

B.38:  -- glued shut.  But, usually when you get the magazine, the whole magazine
smells [barking] like that fragrance and you can't get the smell out and it,
and sometimes it makes you have a headache because it's so strong.

A.39:  What magazines are those?  I don't know if I've ever seen one in mine or
not.

B.40:  Well, they came in PEOPLE and a lot of times if you buy, like, the fashion
magazines, the COSMOPOLITAN, or the GLAMOUR, or ELLE, those type have --

A.41:  Oh. 

B.42:  -- have them in it.  

A.43:  I don't get those.  

B.44:  I don't get them on a regular basis, but sometimes I've bought them.

A.45:  Um.  Do you have any pet, uh, magazines?  

B.46:  No, we, we have two dogs, but no magazines come in, uh, regarding pets at
all.

A.47:  Do you like the READERS' DIGEST when th-, in their, uh, theirs, they're
kind of interesting.  They have the, uh,

B.48:  I like READERS' DIGEST, but I usually borrow my parents' of that --

A.49:  Oh. 

B.50:  -- because they get it so I didn't have to subscribe [laughter].

A.51:  Oh.  So you get away easy, huh.  

B.52:  Well, a little bit [laughter].  But I like, the, they're interesting and
plus I like to read through the, in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on
those.  Sometimes the book excerpts are good, too, but mostly I like the other
articles.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  And I like the vocabulary section in that.  

A.55:  Yeah, I like that, too.  Sometimes you can get a pretty good, uh,

B.56:  And sometimes the real definition is something totally opposite of what you
thought it was [laughter].

A.57:  Yeah.  Doesn't that blow your mind away when that happens?  That's
something.

B.58:  Sometimes I like the true to life stories, but sometimes they get too
melodramatic.

A.59:  Like, what do you mean?  

B.60:  It see-,
