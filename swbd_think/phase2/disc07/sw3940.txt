============================================================

A.1:   What's your favorite television show Barbara?  

@B.2:   My favorite, well, I have several, but my think my, uh, very
favorite is, uh, oh, [breathing] I've been (( )).  My mind just
went blank.  Uh, PROS AND CONS, I enjoy that.  And I like the BILL
COSBY SHOW.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   What about you?  

A.5:   Oh, my f-, my favorite television show is NORTHERN EXPOSURE. 

B.6:   I haven't seen that.  I'm going to have to start watching
that.  

A.7:   Oh, it's great, it's such a funny show.  But, uh, I didn't
watch it for the first season, then a friend of mine d-, had
commented how good it was and I started watching it.  It's just a
hoot.  But, uh, [throat_clearing] I like comedies.  The, the other
show that I like is kind of silly, a lot of it, but, uh, AMERICA'S
FUNNIEST F-, HOME VIDEO, uh, on Sunday nights.  

B.8:   Yes, I watch that occasionally.  

A.9:   That is, they had it, a couple of weeks ago, they had a, uh,
a parakeet on there that sang, uh, God Bless America that sounded
like Ethel Merman [laughter].  

B.10:   [Laughter]. 

A.11:   It was, it was a riot [laughter].  

B.12:   [Groan]. 

A.13:   But, uh, other than that, I like, uh, JEOPARDY, you know, the
old JEOPARDY -- 

B.14:   Yeah.  

A.15:   -- game show.  

B.16:   I enjoy game shows.  Uh, since I work during the day, I'm, uh,
watch, uh, WHEEL OF FORTUNE in the evening.  

A.17:   Uh-huh, yeah, boy, that's a, that's, that's a hugely popular
show.  

B.18:   Yes, it is.  

A.19:   Yeah, well, uh, JEOPARDY comes on right after WHEEL OF FORTUNE
Monday through Friday here in Miami -- 

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   -- and, uh, I, I like to, to pit my knowledge against, uh, the
other contestants.  

B.22:   Are you pretty good?  

A.23:   Yeah, some nights, I feel like, oh, golly, I could do that,
and then other nights, I think, gosh, I'm glad I'm not up there
because,

B.24:   [Laughter].

A.25:   I'd make a fool of myself [laughter], so it depends.  So
they, they have some awfully, awfully, uh, clever people who know
just a, a vast amount of trivial information.  So that's
interesting to me.  

B.26:   Yes, do you find you learn a lot on those shows?  

A.27:   Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, they had one not too long ago
and one of the questions was, what is the most populous country,
uh, south of the equator.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   You know, and I would have guessed Brazil.  It turned out it
was South Africa.  

B.30:   Really?  

A.31:   Yeah, which I would have never, I don't know, for some reason,
that never would have popped in my mind.  Now what, what good that
knowledge is, I don't know, but it was a interesting piece of
trivia.  

B.32:   That's good.  Uh, do you ever feel sometimes you'd like to
compete in one of those?  

A.33:   Uh, again, I, there have been, you know, a couple of times
when I thought, you know, golly, I, I could have, you know, I could
have won tonight and, then, again, there are other times when I
watch and, you know, I know that I wouldn't have done so well, but,
uh, [breathing] yeah, I guess anybody that, that watches those, uh,
you know, probably thinks, uh, occasionally about it.  The
interesting thing about JEOPARDY is that they never do, uh, uh,
give any information on how to compete.  They do say that if you're
going to be in the Los Angeles area and want free tickets, they
tell you how to get that.  

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   But they don't ever say anything about, uh, uh -- 

B.36:   Competing.  

A.37:   -- com-, you know, how to, how to get to be a c-, a
competitor.

B.38:   Do you think maybe they pick them out of their, uh, audience? 

A.39:   Well, they might, they might.  That could be it and then
again, it could just be that they want people to take the
initiative to write in, you know, expressing an interest.  I don't
know.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  Do you have any situation comedies that you really
like?  

A.41:   Uh, [throat_clearing] h-, uh, this, there's one that started
this season, it's called, uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT.  

B.42:   I saw that one time and I didn't care for that because --

A.43:   You didn't like that?  

B.44:   -- it seemed like the kids were, uh, very, uh, obstinate and
rude and it was, they were trying to teach them manners.  

A.45:   Yeah.  

B.46:   Did you see that one?  

A.47:   Yeah, I saw that.  

B.48:   And I didn't like that aspect, so I, and that was the first
one I watched, but I should probably try to, a second time.  

A.49:   Yeah, well, anyway, I, I k-, I kind of get a kick out of that
one just because, uh, I like the, uh, the husband on there. 
[laughter] He's always trying to put more power into all the
electrical appliances.  

B.50:   [Laughter]. 

A.51:   But, uh, then after that ROSEANNE comes on, which I have, uh,
friends who just abhor ROSEANNE, but I think it's a funny show.  

B.52:   I don't care for her either.  

A.53:   [Laughter].  

B.54:   I just, I just, I, but I like EVENING SHADE.  Have you watched
that -- 

A.55:   Yeah -- 

B.56:   -- lately?  

A.57:   -- it's cute.  It's a cute show, it really is.  

B.58:   It really is.  

A.59:   But I like the, uh, [throat_clearing] that, not so much,
ROSEANNE, but I like their children on there, Darlene in
particular, the middle daughter.  

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   I think she's a good little actress.  

B.62:   That's great.  Uh, do you ever think about those, uh, twins
and triplets that are on those shows.  You ever think about, uh,
how they can teach them at such a young age?  

A.63:   Uh, you mean like the, the little kids?  

B.64:   Yeah.  

A.65:   Uh, [breathing] well, I,
