A.1:  ever had a family reunion?

B.2:  Yes, we have several.  

A.3:  Um, do you do extended families or,

B.4:  We do extended families.  

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Have you, do you, have you participated in a family reunion?

A.7:  [Throat_clearing] Yes, um, in the last couple of years, I've, the last one
we had was [noise] in September, and, um, I helped plan it.  So, and it was
here in Dallas.  {talking softly to person off the phone} You can't talk to me
right now, darling.  {normal} But, um.

B.8:  Um, I, I know that when we've had ours, they set a date, and they have them
every, um, year --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and it's mostly on my mom's side of the family that does it --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- but, um, they send out invitations, and it's the very same weekend of
every year, and it's in July, and they always bring, um, family history
information, and they have --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and the Saturday is all ti-, involved in people getting together, um,
going over, there's all these tables set up, and they've got all this family
history that you can get, information on different people and their childhood
and pictures, and put together your own history of your family and your
ancestors.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And that's really fun.  And then on Sunday, they, um, they have a big
dinner and everyone's supposed to bring something, and it's more of just a
time to just chat and get, you know, reacquainted with your cousins --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- and things like that.  That's the very big extended one.  That's over
two hundred people that go to that.

A.19:  Oh, wow.  #Yeah# --

B.20:  #So.#

A.21:  -- that [throat_clearing] we've done, um, we went to one that was my
husband's grandfather and his brothers and sisters and then their families.
So we, that was kind of nice.  I don't know that they had done one, um, in a
long, long time, and so it was real nice to get to know other people than his,
just aunts and uncles --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- and so, that was really fun, and, um, we did that in Florida, but there
were several, only maybe, oh, seventy or eighty people there, but they did,
they did a lot of, um, we had, we had several get togethers like Saturday was,
or Friday night we started with dinner.  Saturday we had lunch together and
took like family pictures and went over family history, and then, um, that
night, we had some free time in there, and then that night was, um, oh, it was
more, it was, it was a nice dinner, and then they had, you went around the
room and said who you were and maybe something about yourself and, you know,
how you were related in the family and stuff, and that was kind of nice
because we'd been talking to these people all day long, and then it was okay
now, where do you fit in in the, in the line and stuff --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- and whose, whose are you kind of thing.  But, um.

B.26:  I know on more of a smaller scale, my husband's mother and father have
bought a condominium --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- that's in a ski resort in Utah --

A.29:  Um.

B.30:  -- and, um, they have it a certain week each year that's set aside for the
whole family to come home --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- in July, and, um, everybody tries to go there and stay.  It's two or
three big condominiums that all hook together --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- and so everybody tries to go up and stay and, um, all be together on, in
his immediate family.  But there were seven children, and by the time you get
their spouses and their children all there.

A.35:  Yeah, there're six in my family, and I don't, I don't think of them as
family reunions so much, but, either Thanksgiving or Christmas we're for sure,
everyone is there.  And, and, uh, so that's, [laughter] you know, by the time
you get the kids and all that, there's, there's a good number of us there --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- and, um, but we usually just eat and, and play games and, you know, chit
chat, but, um, we had a, my grandmother's side of the family we had a get
together last year, and that was really fun because, [breathing] as cousins we
stay real close together, and, um, so, but we did things like, um, went to the
tea, we went and had tea at the, um, oh, one of the hotels downtown, in
downtown Dallas --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and then, Friday night, if you wanted to go, you could go to the
Mesquite Rodeo, and then Saturday it was, we had a big family picnic, and we
had t-shirts that, you know, said family reunion and gave the year, and, um,
wore those to the picnic.  Then we had some stuff for the kids, and there was
a, it was, there was a wading pool there that if the kids wanted to go
swimming, they could do that, and if the guys wanted to go golf, they could do
that and stuff, and then Saturday night was our big, big dinner, and, and we
had it catered, and it, for most of the part it was catered, and it was really
nice to be able to, we sent out stuff, this is, this is what's available to
do, and, you know, the big family dinner is going to be Saturday night.  You
need to make a reservation and pay us ahead of time, because the year before
we had done it, and had, had problems getting, you know --

B.40:  The money, yeah.

A.41:  -- the, the, yeah, I mean, it's like pass the hat around and it didn't, I
don't think they broke even at all --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- and, uh, which is, I mean, I can't imagine feeding two hundred like,
