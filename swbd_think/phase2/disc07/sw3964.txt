=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, Liz, do you own a boat?

B.2:  Well, my family has a, has a sailboat --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and we haven't actually been out in it in a while, um, but we do.

A.5:  Um.  Where do you sail at?

B.6:  There's a lake, uh, right by our airport here in Dallas, and, uh, Lake
Grapevine, and, um, actually I have not done much sailing.  I had, uh, I
would, I have crewed in it, but I've never really gotten to where I feel
comfortable, you know, doing the whole thing myself, and had all kinds of
plans to go out and take lessons and do it, and, uh, for a while there we had
flooded lakes and didn't have a chance to.  So I haven't done that yet.

A.7:  How, how large is your boat?

B.8:  I'm trying to remember.  Uh, (( )) uh, I really can't remember.  Uh, it's a
boat that my sister and I had told my father, who's in his seventies, we had
said, you know, maybe, uh, it would be ni-, maybe sometime we'd like to learn
more about sailing, and, um, he, he, who, he is the one who loves sailing, and
he's the one who's been in it, and he just went out and bought a boat.  Uh, we
didn't mean it that [laughter] seriously.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  So he went out and bought one.  He is not fun to sail with.  It is always a
crisis, and so, um, he turned me off against it when I was young.  And then
later, different men that I have known have had boats and, and they made it
fun.  But, um, he doesn't.

A.11:  That's too bad.  We've g-, we've got a boat.  It isn't a sail boat.  My, I
should say my family does also.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  It's a, it's a fishing and ski boat.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  It'll hold about seven people, but we have a lot of fun.  Uh, every year we
get together for a, a week down at a place that's, it's kind of a resort.  We
have a time share down there and take the boat and water ski and, and go
fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold, and.

B.16:  Oh, I bet that's fun.

A.17:  It's a lot of fun.  And even the little kids, uh, enjoy it.  I've got, uh,
uh, a six year old and, and, of course, some of the other family has some
around eight or ten --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and we have a great big, oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids
that size.  It's a big, kind of like a, a, a water wiener that floats in the
water, and they can all,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  get on it at once --

B.22:  Oh, how fun.

A.23:  -- and they just have a blast.  We put a life jacket on everybody and then
--

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- you know, just pull them around, and --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- uh, we burn up a tank or two of gas a day, and get a really good sunburn
--

B.28:  I bet [laughter].

A.29:  -- and just have a great time.

B.30:  [Laughter] I bet.

A.31:  But my experience with boating and, at, at least that way, I don't know,
the sailing might be different.  I, I don't know, I think I'd kind of be too
impatient to, uh, to sail, but, uh, I don't know, it might be kind of fun,
too, just to, uh, relax and, I guess it's all wind powered, isn't it, #when
you sail?#

B.32:  #It is.# Uh, you, you can have a motor on it, and, and a lot of them do, a,
uh, just because if you get out there and there's no wind, it's pretty hard to
get back.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  I find it very relaxing.  I think they're, they're absolutely beautiful.
I, you know, I really, as I say, would like to learn to do it myself.  Just
got turned off early on by a particular manner, but, um, it's a wonderful
feeling.  My son and, and, and can sail, and he and I have gone out.  But he
likes to cut it right, right to the [laughter],

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  when you're going along with the wind, you, you, you can get, you can
decide how much you want to heel, and he loves to take it as far over as
possible.

A.37:  Um.

B.38:  I find that.

A.39:  So that's additional speed when you're, is that what you, what you're
saying?

B.40:  Yeah, the closer to the wind you are --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- then you've sailboats out where they just way over --

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  -- and that's, they're just moving right on out [laughter].

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And, uh, that's his favorite way, um, even to the point where you've got to
have someone on the up side, you know, putting some weight [laughter] on there
so you don't go over.

A.47:  [Laughter] I see.  And you always get to be the one that's hanging over the
edge.

B.48:  Well, you know, since he's doing the other, there, you know, where am I
supposed to go.

A.49:  Sure.

B.50:  So that, that is not my favorite.  But, um, a friend who, um, I dated, um,
years back, uh, and, and I would go out, and that was just wonderful, you'd,
you know, take some, take a picnic and, and go out, and you can go in little
coves and, and, it's so quiet.  It's, it, that, that's something I love.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  I mean, I like ski boats, too, and the speed and, you know, going around,
but there's something extremely peaceful about a sail boat.

A.53:  Well, do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- kind of let it go, and.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  You do take an anchor then, and.

B.58:  Yeah, drop an anchor, and, you know, there've been the times when the
anchor [laughter] catches in something and you get --

A.59:  Uh oh.

B.60:  -- spend a lot of time --

A.61:  cut the rope, huh.

B.62:  -- yeah, trying to get it back up, et cetera, but, uh.

A.63:  How, how large is your boat, how many, how many people could go on it at
once?

B.64:  Um, really, comfortably, about four adults.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  And, uh.

A.67:  Are, are they set up so you can spend the night in them and,

B.68:  Well, not this one, but, but some are.  There's so,
