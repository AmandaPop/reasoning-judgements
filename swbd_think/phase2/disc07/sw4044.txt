===========================================================================

A.1:  I guess my basic feeling is that as a middle income tax payer, I'm not
paying too much if I'm sure that I'm getting value for the dollar.  I mean
that, I guess, sounds like a cliche, but, uh, looking around at a, a lot of
the infra structure, particularly in the northeast here, uh, you know, bridges
and roads in terrible shape, and I don't know.  [laughter] I'm sort of
overwhelmed by it all.

B.2:  Do you think that that's because the, because the politicians have been
seduced by the opportunity to get the vote, uh, so they've spent the money on,
on, uh, popular, how should I say it, programs that show up immediately, you
know, like giving away, uh, let's see, how should I say it, paying money to
people that, that, uh, it, it takes years for a bridge to begin to show
neglect, whereas a tem-, a, uh, a input of money, can, uh, which they can
never turn off, by the way, will get, this guy votes.

A.3:  [Laughter] Yes, it's entirely possible.  Certainly anything that's been
discussed over the, the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer, in terms
of tax reform or, or revenue reallocation, seems to be concerned with just
that, you know, who's, who's going to start getting more and how fast.  Um, I
kind of came of age in the sixties, and it seemed to me, seems to me, that the
general attitude in the entire country is a lot different then than now.  I
mean, I think there was more a, a general sense of prosperity --

B.4:  #There was.#

A.5:  -- #even# yeah, although, #my.#

B.6:  #There's sig-,#

A.7:  Oh, excuse me.

B.8:  I was just going to say there's significantly more money, and we weren't a
debtor nation in those days.

A.9:  Yeah, I, I've never been able to reconcile that fact, which, which does
seem to be true, and the fact that the typical middle class family today seems
to have, you know, and expect some, what more in terms of, uh, material
possessions and vacations and what not.  But back then, uh, I think there was
more of a sense of, because there was a feeling of prosperity, people didn't
mind paying for social programs, for instance, or public improvements, and
today there, there seems to be, uh, sort of a jealous guarding of resources by
each generation.

B.10:  Well, I think two things have happened.  Number one, uh, it's like, uh,
pay, play now, pay later.  Uh, somebody's, we're, we're to the point now where
[inhaling] where the pay later is, uh, is here, and, uh, and, uh, when I was
growing up, they always warned me about borrowing money to go on a vacation,
because you have all year long to think about those payments,

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  and it just goes by you pretty fast.  Well, the play now, pay later, uh,
mentality, uh, sounded pretty good at the time when you, when you had a fair
amount of disposable income --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and, uh, uh, the, the debt load is way up, uh, you know, in the sixties,
what was the cost of tuition, the cost of tuition in those days was, was the
cost of almost monthly rent today, right?

A.15:  Yeah, pretty much, I mean, I, I paid whatever, something on the order of
four thousand dollars a year for tuition and room and board and comprehensive
fee, and, uh, for those, those figures have been dwarfed today, certainly.

B.16:  Yeah, I mean, well, I'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars,
but tuition, uh, public tuition, was about a third of that --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- uh, you know, perhaps.  Anyway, what I'm saying is that everything costs
more these days, uh, and we've reached a point where, where people are, like I
say, taxes are going up. Your expenses have gone up, and perhaps the thing
that's more important, uh, uh, progressive, we are now making what, uh, what
we used to think of as only the rich made, you know, the daily, the minimum
wage is [inhaling] let's see, what is it.  When I was a, I'm, I graduated from
college in sixty-one, and I can remember when I graduated I hoped some day to
make eighteen thousand dollars a year, and taxes on eighteen thousand a year,
uh, were a whole lot less than, uh, you know, taxes on what, what I thought
was a very good salary --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- um, are about the same as they are today, only I'm making,
