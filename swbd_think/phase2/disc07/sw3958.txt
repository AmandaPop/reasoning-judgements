A.1:  do regular exercise?

B.2:  Since I was just feeling extremely [laughter] guilty about this.

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] It's a timely question.  Um, I do not exercise enough.  I have,
um, I'm overweight and, uh,

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  under, under exercised and, um, can, I can tell it affects me and I don't
know why I can't make myself do it.

A.7:  Have you, have you tried, uh, you know, beginning something and it hasn't
worked, so you've stopped after a while or just try to get,

B.8:  Well, I used to, I used to do more things.  Currently, I've just gotten a,
they're a really nice tape Angela Lansbury has done, and it's very mild.  It's
mostly stretching, but I've, I've more mornings than not, I will do at least
ten minutes with her, which is a good starter.  Then there's a twenty minute
part afterwards that I tell myself every day when I get back, I have a erratic
schedule, you know, and when I come back in, I'll do the twenty minutes,
uh-huh, but anyway.

A.9:  Well, that's good.  I mean, at least you've given some time to it every
day.  #It's not as if you're not doing anything.#

B.10:  #[Laughter] Some, some,# a little something, yes, but, uh, I really enjoy
walking, and somehow, I'll do it for a while, maybe a month or two months,
and, you know, walk two miles a day or something, and then, then quit.

A.11:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.12:  Hard, hard to schedule in.  What about you?

A.13:  It is, you know, I think the problem for me has always been trying to find
a time of day that's going to work.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Um, I think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the
morning, but --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- I'm not a morning person --

B.18:  Um.

A.19:  -- and if I try to wait until the end of the day when I think I have a
little bit more time, I don't always have the energy level.

B.20:  Yeah, that's hard, isn't it.

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  Uh, that, that four to six o'clock.  

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  I see a lot of people out walking, and I just think, oh, I'm just going to
go and, you know, just sit.

A.25:  You get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever.

B.26:  Um, #yeah.#

A.27:  #Um,# I've tried to do a combination of stretching and, and strengthening,
because my problem has been keeping strong, I think, enough.  I tend, if I
don't, I tend to have over stretched muscles, in fact it's called a
hypomobility.

B.28:  Oh.

A.29:  But if I don't keep strong enough, I can pull a muscle more easily.

B.30:  #Oh, I see.#

A.31:  #Say if I# go on vacation, uh, and pick up some heavy suitcases, it might
stretch a muscle that would not have felt injured if I had kept the muscle
strong enough #to really support# --

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  -- the joints.  So.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  [Laughter]  That's.

B.36:  Yeah, and so do you do it?

A.37:  Well you know, tomorrow night there's a sale at one of the shopping centers
close by on barbells [laughter].

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  Well.

B.40:  And you're thinking about getting them.

A.41:  I'm definitely going to because I work at a hospital where there is a
physical therapy department, and I've used their barbells --

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  -- for a long while --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- but I know I need to get more regular and do it at home.  

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  So if I purchase my own I think I'm more inclined to do so, #and they're a#
--

B.48:  #Yeah that.#

A.49:  -- good price.

B.50:  It is, and it is hard to do, I mean, it is easier to do at home, even the
walking, which I can do right here, the idea of getting in a car to drive to
a, a place, which a number of my friends keep suggesting, just exhausts me
because #I drive so much# --

A.51:  #See, I can't do that.#

B.52:  -- in my job.

A.53:  Yeah, and.

B.54:  And I just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere, you
know, and there are all #these people,#

A.55:  #[Laughter].#

B.56:  there and you have to put on these clothes and, 

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  and I, uh, so I'd much rather do it here.

A.59:  #That's the# --

B.60:  #Now my daughter has a# --

A.61:  -- exactly the same with me.

B.62:  -- a bike, but it's a real bike, and she cycles and she can put it on a
thing, but you have to be the right size #to fit that.#

A.63:  #Oh.# So, you've thought about that as well, #a bike exercise.#

B.64:  #I've thought, I've thought about# doing that.  Uh, this tape is nice.
Walking, as I say, is one that I really like.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  I'm concerned about flexibility.  I'm, I'm almost fifty, and, and I can,
you know, begin to feel a little of that --

A.67:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.68:  -- going [laughter].

A.69:  Well.

B.70:  And I want to be able to turn around and see if the, you know, when I'm
driving, not just look in the rear view mirror, but easily turn around and go
up steps and all that without --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- huffing and puffing.

A.73:  Feel it in your neck, in other words.

B.74:  Yes --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- yeah, yeah, really.

A.77:  It's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that
that will maintain their motivation.  They've either invested the money in it,
or there're people there that expect them or --

B.78:  Yes.

A.79:  -- whatever.  [laughter] But I think it's just the opposite with me.  I
need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time, and yet #I'm not sure
[laughter].#

B.80:  #Well, there is, there is,# that, that is a plus, and I did do that.  I
used to do it, and, and it, it is a plus, and I almost took Tai Che.  That's
something that's interested me for a long time, and I.

A.81:  It is beautiful.

B.82:  Oh, uh, it is beautiful, and it seems like it, it combines a lot of things.
So --

A.83:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.84:  -- #so, you know a, a# mental attitude as well as the physical.  But, um,
the [sigh] the guy insisted that you would have to come every time, and I
thought well, this is really good, because he's, you know, dedicated and you
have to do these things.  But the first three Saturdays, uh, I was doing
trainings [laughter].

A.85:  #Oh.#

B.86:  #I mean,# it, it was on Saturday --

A.87:  (( )).

B.88:  -- mornings, and already they, you know, I, I already couldn't do it, #so I
was like# --

A.89:  #Uh-huh.#

B.90:  -- oh, okay, well that,

A.91:  Needs to be more flexible for your schedule.

B.92:  Yeah, that's the problem, and he just says, has to be, you know, I've got a
class opening at nine thirty on Saturday, and you can every once in a while go
to a different class --

A.93:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.94:  -- but that's when you're supposed to come, and actually I hadn't been
doing any Saturday trainings, and then all of a sudden, right when the class
opened,

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  you know so,
