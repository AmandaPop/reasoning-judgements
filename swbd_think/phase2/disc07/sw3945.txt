B.1:  We're talking about taxes?

A.2:  Taxes, right.  

B.3:  Right.  Well you,

A.4:  You think you pay too much, is what they said, and do you think you get
what you pay for [laughter]?

@B.5:  That's hard to say, you know.  I think you take a lot for granted, you
know, and it's, the, the quick answer I think would be that you pay too much
taxes --

A.6:  Yeah.  

B.7:  -- you know, but, but I think if you think about it, uh, all the highways
we have, all the, uh, federal programs we have, whether they're good or bad,
uh, sure seems like you do get a bang, you know, it seems like a lot of stuff
going on even though every paycheck a lot of money's coming out.  Uh, I don't
know, I don't know, it seems like, so, I used to think that government spent
too much and they probably do, but, you know, when you go to your doctor, your
doctor's private also and, uh, they're going to charge you a good buck for
whatever they're doing --

A.8:  Right.  

B.9:  -- also, so, well, what do you think?  

A.10:  Well, I really feel in some areas that, uh, I agree, I don't think any of
us like paying taxes.  I think in some areas, we could do better in the
private sector.  I think it just, I've done some reading on this and so-, and
in some areas, you know, you're lucky to get back a, a dime on a dollar on
some programs.  Uh, but, I also know that people to me won't do what they
should do to help each other and they wouldn't have so much government if we
did and, uh, we get, you know, gets forced into it.  I think socialized
medicine's coming, which I hate to see, but I think because there's so many
people without insurance that's what's c-, you know, it's coming.

B.11:  Yeah, it's needed.  

A.12:  Uh-huh.  So, [breathing] uh, but, no, I don't, probably feel like I get
back what I pay, now you, do you pay state income tax in,

B.13:  Yeah, I, I pay actually state, city and federal.  

A.14:  Yeah, see -- 

B.15:  And,   

A.16:  -- here a lot of people think in Texas we're lucky because we don't pay,
uh, state income tax, but they get us in other ways, you know.

B.17:  Yeah, well, I, I just figured it out today.  I get, uh, I think my, my two
week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that,
sixteen, sixteen, something around there and my take home after taxes is about
eleven.

A.18:  Um.  

B.19:  So --

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  -- five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out.  You know, and,
obviously, if you make, you know, forty thousand dollars a year, you're paying
ten thousand in, dollars a year in taxes --

A.22:  Yeah.  

B.23:  -- and everybody who's in that type of income is paying that. 

A.24:  I think -- 

B.25:  So,   

A.26:  -- that's another problem.  

B.27:  Plus sales tax, right.  

A.28:  Yeah, well, that's where they got us here.  I mean, every time they need
something, they up the, quote, user's fees or the sin taxes, you know on beer
and,

B.29:  Sure, sure, and plus you pay, if you buy cigarettes, you pay tax on that --

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  -- if you buy beer,   

A.32:  So just because we don't have a state income tax, they get us
proportionately higher in other areas.

B.33:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.34:  So --

B.35:  You --

A.36:  -- I don't know.  

B.37:  -- you don't have a state income tax in Texas?

A.38:  No.  

B.39:  That's, so, yeah, that's not so bad, but they still have to get the money
somewhere to,

A.40:  They get it somewhere --

B.41:  Yeah.  

A.42:  -- and, and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax, you
take it off your federal, but we can't take our, any of our sales taxes or
anything off anymore because of the reform, but that's what they up it.  They
up it on gasoline, they up it on, uh, say beer and cigarettes, uh, user's fee,
driver's license, license plates.  It all just keeps going up and up and up,
and they tell us it's not really taxes.  [laughter] You know.

B.43:  Right [laughter].  

A.44:  But it is, and, uh,

B.45:  Same difference.  

A.46:  No, I don't know, I don't know what the answer is to all this.  I think,
uh,

B.47:  W-,

A.48:  I don't know.  

B.49:  I, I think it's a, I, I don't know, I, I think it's like private, like you
said, privatization is good because, you know, when the pri-, uh, one good
thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a
business at a loss.

A.50:  Right.  

B.51:  I happen to work for a city, for the City of New York and, uh, that's the
attitude that, uh, at least my agency takes, you know, they, they, w-, they
take the attitude that, uh, this is a business --

A.52:  Right.  

B.53:  -- and, and if you're not going to run it profitably, then you're going to
be out of business because they are going to privatize it.  So, in that sense,
you know, at my agency, a-, and it's unique, I think, for government agencies,
is revenue producing.

A.54:  Right.  

B.55:  And we make more money than we, than we cost, so, uh,

A.56:  Well, that's really unusual.  

B.57:  So nobody's ever going to question my salary or anybody --

A.58:  Right.  

B.59:  -- else on my staff.  Uh, especially my unit, because my unit is a revenue
producing unit.  Uh, there are other, you know, things that, that may, I mean,
look at that, I was talking to my father the other day about the N A S A
program.  You know, he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this
money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff, but, yet, then,
again, they come up with all these scientific discoveries --

A.60:  Right.  

B.61:  -- that may help save us sometime.  I mean -- 

A.62:  That, we've -- 

B.63:  -- I think it was N A S A,

A.64:  -- learned a lot.  

B.65:  Yeah, you do learn a lot.  So you're not, you, you know, you're paying all
this money, but you're getting something back for it.

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  Uh, you know, military spending is the same thing, whether you agree or you
disagree with building all these bombs and stuff, which I happen to have a
tendency to disagree with, uh, you know, we are buying protection, you know.

A.68:  Yeah.  

B.69:  We are protecting ourselves from, from, uh, from other countries that we
may be afraid of, whether it's r-,
