B.1:  Hi.

A.2:  I'm Brigette.

B.3:  I'm Paul.

A.4:  Nice to meet you.

B.5:  Pleased to meet you. 

A.6:  Where are you?

B.7:  I'm in Texas.

A.8:  Are you?  So am I.  Where are you in Texas?

B.9:  Dallas.  

A.10:  Okay, I'm in Lubbock.

B.11:  Oh, okay.

A.12:  Okay.  Are you ready for me to push one?

B.13:  Sure.  Anytime.

A.14:  Okay.  [beep]  So what do you think about capital punishment?

@B.15:  Well, I think it's a necessary, uh, a necessary tool that, uh, needs to be
used, uh, to establish justice in some cases, #and to# --

A.16:  #Uh-huh.#

B.17:  -- that, that it, if used properly, uh, I think it can be, uh, it wou-, it
would be a useful deterrent.

A.18:  Uh-huh.  What do you think about Jeffrey Dahlmer?  Like, not getting, since
they don't have it in.

B.19:  Yeah, well, I think that, I think there are certain [breathing] people in
society that have no redeeming --

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  -- uh, worth to them and that it's, it, it's a waste for society to
continue to support those people.  Those people should be, you know, disposed
of.

A.22:  Yeah.  I know, because it's like, it's kind of like a tough call, because
all they do is sit in jail, and the jails are overcrowded, you know.

B.23:  That's right.

A.24:  It's like problem upon problem upon problem.  Like you could put them in
jail for the rest of his life.  Well all the jails are already overcrowded,
you know, and they add more problems, you know, since jails are overcrowded
they have to reduce, you know, time to like one third of what you're supposed
to do it, you know.

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  It gets kind of ridiculous.

B.27:  That's right, I mean, they probably, you know, we, the, you know, our
justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  It, it's designed as a set of artificial rules that, you know, judges and
lawyers play with each other.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  I know, I, I guess I could be for it and against it in some ways.
I mean, I think I'm definitely for it and stuff when I think of someone like,
like him that killed all those people and has no remorse or anything, you
know.  I feel like that's the right thing to do, and I guess I would have to
say it would be for more circumstances, you know.

B.31:  Well, it, it, it, uh, uh, yeah, but, uh, you know, the problem is, it,
when, when we administer it by, you know, I mean, like, like in Texas --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- we have the death penalty, right?

A.34:  Right.

B.35:  And they killed a guy a while back, and, you know, he'd been in jail for
twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting, uh, you know w-, #w-,
w-, waiting his sentence.#

A.36:  #Yeah, see I think that.# [laughter] (( )) what is the point of that?

B.37:  There, there's no point in it, I mean.

A.38:  Where did that come from?

B.39:  Well, it's, it's, it's because, you know, people don't want to recognize
how to make, you know, how to, how to make a punishment effective.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  I mean, it, punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any
good.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  The only way, the only way it does some good is if it con-, convinces
somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that.

A.44:  Yeah, that's true.  Definitely true.

B.45:  And, you know, if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it
is, you know, how is that a deterrent to anybody?

A.46:  See, why, do you have any clue why that they sit on, like death row that
long?

B.47:  Because the courts require it.  #I mean# --

A.48:  #See.#

B.49:  -- they, they, they have said that, well, everybody has to have cer-, you
know, has to have the, the, the right to appeal, well --

A.50:  Yeah, #I understand that.#

B.51:  -- #not only do they have# the right to appeal, they must appeal, and, you
know, they, the lawyers go in there, and they #generate.#

A.52:  #It takes#, prolong it forever.

B.53:  Well, they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able
to appeal.

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  Uh, you know, they, they're, they're trying to generate technicalities, you
#know# --

A.56:  #Yeah.#

B.57:  -- things which aren't really related to #whether,#

A.58:  #[Laughter].#

B.59:  the guy did it or not --

A.60:  Yeah, but.

B.61:  -- as to whether something in the process was right or wrong.

A.62:  Yeah, see.

B.63:  And, you know, it, it doesn't work, our whole justice system doesn't work
like that.

A.64:  Yeah, it'd be easier if at least, if someone was, you know, sentenced to
death, then if they were to have to have an appeal, it should be taken care of
as quickly as possible, you know.

B.65:  Yes, that's right.

A.66:  And I understand appeals take a long time and everything else, but, you
know, I mean, they should have like, golly, there's something so it'd be done
faster, you know, because then they complain about the jails and the this and
that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years.

B.67:  #(( )).#

A.68:  #Well,# that's dumb.

B.69:  It is.  It's terrible.

A.70:  I mean at least if they're going to do it, do it.  I mean that's like even
torture kind of, you know.

B.71:  Oh, I gue-, I, I don't feel sorry for the, for the victim --

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  -- (( )) you know, for the, for the criminal,
