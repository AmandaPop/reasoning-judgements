=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what kind of music do you like to listen to?

@B.2:  I'm pretty diverse, actually.  #Um# --

A.3:  #Are you?#

B.4:  -- I consider myself as a performer, and also an enjoyer, so, I kind of get
into all, all types.  I run the gamut from, uh, alternative to, uh, to rock
and roll to heavy metal to you name it.  So, I'm pretty open on that.

A.5:  Are you like country western?

B.6:  Country's not bad. 

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  I grew up in Nebraska, so it's like, um, yeah, I listen to it once in a
while, but it's, it's probably not my, my top mode.  I guess that's pretty,
pretty popular down in Plano though, uh?

A.9:  Um, yeah we, I mean, it, you know, there's, you have all sorts here too.
Um, I went to a pretty, uh, well, the school I went to was Texas A and M, and
--

B.10:  Oh, yeah.

A.11:  -- and, uh, [breathing] either you, you do, you went country western
dancing, or, um.

B.12:  Or you didn't do anything at all, right?  

A.13:  Yeah [laughter].

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  Pretty mu-, pretty much so --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- so I have to, I really liked, I liked it there, but I also, also like
some of the Christian, um, contemporary music that they have play-,

B.18:  Are you into the Garth Brooks thing at all, or is that popular down there
right now?

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  I know that he's kind of a big name right now.

A.21:  Yeah, yeah, he's popular here, and --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- um, there's all.

B.24:  And you're also into the Christian contemporary stuff?

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Yeah, I had a, I had a roommate that was really into that, he was into all
the, um, groups like, uh, I'm trying to remember, D M Z --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- Resurrection Band, uh, who else, there are a couple of other ones.  He
was into, he was into Petra as well.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  In fact it's interesting, he's, he's actually an engineer (( )) I don't
know the school in Florida.  And he's an engineer that does sound mixing right
now for Christian Brown.

A.31:  Oh, really.

B.32:  Yeah, he's pretty into it.

A.33:  That's fun.

B.34:  It's been lucrative for him.

A.35:  Well, what, you, you mentioned Alternative Music --

B.36:  Well, yeah, um.

A.37:  -- what is that? [laughter].

B.38:  Kind of like, I don't know, in the early seventies, I think it was called
Punk Rock --

A.39:  Oh, okay.

B.40:  -- now it's kind of taken a different slant, and I think it's, it's gone
more diverse toward, um, not so much the head banging on the wall stuff, as
much as just runs really a wider, more eclectic, uh, tone flow and things like
that.  So.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  It's, I don't know, I, like I said, I consider myself fairly diverse, so,
um.

A.43:  You said you're also a performer.

B.44:  Yeah, yeah.

A.45:  What do you perform?

B.46:  Well, I play the trumpet, #um# --

A.47:  #Do you?#

B.48:  -- and also keyboards.  I played keyboards for about, uh, oh, I don't know,
twelve, thirteen years --

A.49:  Oh, wow.

B.50:  -- and played trumpet for about ten, so, it's, it's good for a side
diversion, and a little bit of side income, you know --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- whenever I can.  Do you, do you play anything at all?

A.53:  Um, [laughter] not on a consistent basis --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- at this point.  I've got three kids, and --

B.56:  Oh, wow.

A.57:  -- they're preschoolers, so I do good to get a book read or newspaper read
or anything so.

B.58:  Sure, sure, free time is not much of a luxury.

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.

B.60:  I know that feeling.

A.61:  And, yet, I do go to listen to anything but kids' tapes at this point.

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  Because I know all the kids' tapes.  It's like, Yeah.

B.64:  (( )) that may be more quality, you know, after all.

A.65:  They do have, they do have some good tapes out there for kids. We --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- I don't know, um, Joe Scruggs is a guy that is out of Austin here that
has some wonderful kids tapes, I mean, they are really fun --

B.68:  Joe Scruggs.  Huh.

A.69:  -- and, uh, Joe Scruggs, he's with, he's an educational, um, it's called
SHADOW PLAY, and if you ever see any of his stuff, he is just, #he is# --

B.70:  #Interesting.#

A.71:  -- really good and, and, um, the kids really like it.

B.72:  When you said Scruggs, I was thinking because Earl Scruggs is a real famous
banjo player, a real famous blue grass player --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- and, uh, in fact, if you remember the, the theme from the Beverly
Hillbillies --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- he actually played part of that.

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  He and Lester Flats.  So, I was thinking wow, wonder if this is a relative
[laughter].

A.79:  [Laughter]  I don't know, I don't know.  Well, um --

B.80:  But.

A.81:  -- have you, um, they're not, they're more, have you ever heard of Riders
In The Sky?  I don't know --

B.82:  Oh.

A.83:  -- if they're, if they're big up there, in fact I think they may have even
had a television show on Saturday mornings for kids.

B.84:  Yeah, I don't hear much about that, no.

A.85:  Um, they're a pretty neat, they're kind of a, a blue grass country, uh,
they're real fun, I mean, they're --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- they're the guys, I mean, they can yodel, and they can, they play the
fiddles, and the, and the saws and stuff, and --

B.88:  (( )).

A.89:  -- they're real fun, they're a real fun group.

B.90:  Yeah, kids probably get into that quite a bit.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  I'm, uh, I'm not quite at that point in my life, yet [laughter] --

A.93:  Yeah, well, yeah.

B.94:  -- it'll probably be a while before I,

A.95:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.96:  get into the kids' music at all.

A.97:  Well, we saw them originally at a, at a club down here --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- probably about, oh, seven or eight years ago, and, um, then just in the
last, oh, two years we saw them on a T V show --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and I think they were, I think they were doing kids' music, but what we
saw in the, you know, was adult --

B.102:  Right.

A.103:  -- in the, but I don't know where they run the gamut, and I don't know, um,
you know, I don't know if the south is more towards the, you know, has more of
that crowd or not.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  I don't know.  I don't know the.

B.106:  Well, it's, yeah, it's hard to tell, I know, like in the Appalachian
Mountain area, there, that thing's real popular.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  I've had some friends from West Virginia that's, you know, real popular
around there,
