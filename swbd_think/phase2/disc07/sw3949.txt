===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, Utah has a, a good school system where, uh, as far as I'm
concerned, I can't really see the difficulty, uh, or any problems that we have
other than, they keep saying the A C T scores were a little low, or lower
than, well, we're a-, above the national average, but they're talking in the
newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in
science and math, which I think there's been an effort to, to increase that,
so, I don't see that there's s-, any serious, uh, problems with our school
systems here in Utah.  Uh, what about Texas?

B.2:  Oh, I'd say, uh, we probably have what could be described as serious
[laughter] problems.

A.3:  Uh-huh. 

B.4:  From, uh, gun toting kids to, uh, low grades on the TEAMS test.

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  They, uh -- 

A.7:  Well, I, I h-, hate to hear,

B.8:  -- they got a, pretty much of a handful of problems to --

A.9:  Where --

B.10:  -- deal with.  

A.11:  -- where the students are kind of controlling the, the schools, then in
some areas.

B.12:  Well, I don't know if you could say that, but they're, uh, are having to,
uh, put in metal detectors and --

A.13:  Oh, boy.  

B.14:  -- security and [laughter],

A.15:  Yeah, that's not good.  Uh, I'd hate to teach under those situations.

B.16:  Indeed.  

A.17:  [Laughter] Well, well that hasn't got here, yet.  I hope it, it doesn't,
but, uh, it, I know, uh, we're starting to have a few gangs here associated
with the schools.

B.18:  Yeah, that's bad news, I tell you --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- they, uh, 

A.21:  But that's where it begins, I guess.

B.22:  Course, it always sounds a lot worse than it is, I suppose but,

A.23:  Uh-huh, but at least, uh, I, I go into the schools quite a bit in my
occupation, the different high schools in the, in the six western states that
I, I work in and, uh, generally, from what I can see, the, uh, we don't really
have that type of problems in any of the states yet, but I know to my
counterparts back East that they're, they have, uh, security guards that
patrol the hallways, and, and that's not a good learning situation if you've
got to have policemen there to keep kids in class and,

B.24:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.25:  So it sound like that's, it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in, at
least where you're at.

B.26:  Yeah, they, uh, I don't know, I think they, uh, they need to, uh, get back
to the basics.  I think we --

A.27:  Yes [static].  

B.28:  -- throwing a lot of money at the problem, but it hasn't, uh, seemed to do
what's necessary yet.

A.29:  Uh-huh, that's true and I, I think that, uh, in, in our Utah school systems
we, we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to a lot of the
academic classes that, uh, they feel is necessary, and I think that is, that's
a good change, to, to get back instead of so many, uh, off the wall classes
that have nothing to do with academic, e-, you know, education.

B.30:  I think learning social interaction is good, too, but, uh, I think it has
to be a balanced --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- curriculum.  

A.33:  Yes, there does.  Uh, you can't, uh, go from one extreme to the other, and
th-, there has to be a balance, there's got to be both there, but I think it
should be a little stronger on the academic, uh, portion in order to prepare
them for the society today.  With the technology that we have, they've --

B.34:  That's right.  

A.35:  -- they've got to have a good math and an english background in order to
compete.  Uh,

B.36:  Yeah, I don't think, uh, American schools in general are, uh, coming up to
where they should be.

A.37:  No, they're talking about, uh, in some of the states, [groan] back here are
going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty.  I don't know
what your school year is there but,

B.38:  They're talking about going to y-, they're actually testing out, we just
had it on the news tonight about the, uh, year round school.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  They go for three months and then take a month off or some-,

A.41:  [Cough] We have a, a, there's a little of that going on here, but it's all
in the elementary grades.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  It's not in the upper, uh, in the secondary area, but I, it's, there's some
test cases to see, uh, if the students are able to, if they don't lose as
much, uh, they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month
instead of three months, and they ((have to go)) [static],

B.44:  Exactly, I think that was the, uh, thing they mentioned, too. 

A.45:  Uh-huh.  So it sounds like, uh, [lipsmack] y-, in your area and this area,
too, they're trying to work on the problem, that they see as a problem to
correct the, some of the situations.
