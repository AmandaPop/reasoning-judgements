B.1:  What kind of music do you like?

@A.2:  Well, I, I like, uh, I guess it would be easier to say, tell you what kind
I don't like.  I don't like hard rock, uh, but other than that, I, I like just
about every kind.  I, I'm not real crazy about modern, uh, country and
western.  I, I like the old, uh, uh, country western songs that I grew up
with.  Uh, San Antonio Rose and, uh, the Sons of the Pioneers, Cool Water,
that sort of thing.

B.3:  Oh, now, that, I don't know.  

A.4:  Well, see, you're not as old as I am.  

B.5:  [Laughter]. 

A.6:  [Laughter]. 

B.7:  Either that, or I didn't listen to, Sons of the Pioneers I've heard about.

A.8:  Yeah.  

B.9:  Uh, in fact, I have a friend who, uh, plays hammered dulcimer and sings,
uh, yodel, cowboy yodeling songs and he's --

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  -- talked about Patsy Montana, I think.  You know who that was?

A.12:  No.  

B.13:  No?  Well, that, that was, I gather, an old cowgirl who used to [laughter]
--

A.14:  Uh-huh.  

B.15:  -- sing songs like that.  

A.16:  Yeah, and I, I like the old Hank Williams songs.  

B.17:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.18:  But, uh, the modern kind, it seems to me it all sounds just pretty much
alike.

B.19:  Pretty much like, like rock.  

A.20:  Um.  

B.21:  Or --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- or,

A.24:  Well,   

B.25:  Or just --  

A.26:  It's hard to tell one song,

B.27:  -- similar to each other?  

A.28:  Yeah, it's hard to tell one song from the other.

B.29:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.30:  T-, too be truthful be you, I'm sort of a Beethoven and Bach fan.

B.31:  [Laughter]. 

A.32:  [Laughter]. 

B.33:  Well, I like all of that.  I like classical, I, when I look at my tapes,
it's hard to tell.  I like celtic music, I like classical.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  I like, uh, some of the New Age music.  

A.36:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  Uh-huh.  

B.41:  I like folk music a lot.  

A.42:  Yeah, I have a good friend who grew up in Mexico, she's been in this
country, oh, about twelve, fifteen years and, uh, uh, she gave me a tape, uh,
of some Spanish music.  Oh, what is that dance, with the ladies in the long
dress and the fans.

B.43:  Uh, oh, you mean, uh, Flamenco.  

A.44:  Yeah, Flamingo.  

B.45:  Oh, yes, that's -- 

A.46:  It's -- 

B.47:  -- beautiful.  

A.48:  -- modern-day Flamingo music.  

B.49:  Flamenco is beautiful.  

A.50:  Yeah, and it's really different, and it's really pretty.  

B.51:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that, that I like, and I used to live in Mexico, so I
like, I like Mexican music to a certain extent just be-, --

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  -- because it reminds me of that time.  

A.54:  Uh-huh.  

B.55:  And then, uh, do you play anything?  

A.56:  Well, there are two schools of thought on that [laughter].  

B.57:  [Laughter] You mean yours and everyone else's?  

A.58:  Yeah, uh,

B.59:  [Laughter]. 

A.60:  I, I played in the band -- 

B.61:  Uh-huh.  

A.62:  -- i-, in college, I played the clarinet, B flat clarinet.  

B.63:  Uh-huh.  

A.64:  And then, uh, I took a semester as an elective.  I took a semester of class
piano and I have a piano and an, and an organ, not a very fancy organ.

B.65:  Wow.  

A.66:  But it's an old Hammond.

B.67:  Uh-huh.  

A.68:  Uh, and, uh, I, I can sight read most church hymns and, uh, oh, the FIRST
MOVEMENT OF MOON LIGHT sonata that goes, course, very slowly.  Uh,

B.69:  And do you do it?  Do you play?  

A.70:  No, not as, on a regular basis.  

B.71:  Yeah.  

A.72:  Uh, I, that's going to be my retirement.  

B.73:  [Laughter]. 

A.74:  [Laughter]. 

B.75:  Well I,  

A.76:  Activity if I can ever, ever retire.

B.77:  And get, and get back into trying something with music, huh. 

A.78:  Yeah, I, I do sing in my church choir.  

B.79:  Oh, you do?  

A.80:  Yeah.  

B.81:  Oh, well that's great.  

A.82:  Yeah, so, so I, I do keep up to that extent.  

B.83:  Yeah.  

A.84:  D-, do you play any instruments?  

B.85:  No, well, I played the piano, you know, as a child, uh, for years and then
quit and then kind of enjoyed it and took the guitar and played the guitar a
little bit and I can sight read.

A.86:  Uh-huh.  

B.87:  Uh, and we have a piano.  My son was a percussionist and so he has, we have
a marimba and a drum set.

A.88:  Uh-huh.  

B.89:  If I were to take anything, I think I would take drums.  I just loved it
when he did that.

A.90:  Yeah.  

B.91:  In fact, one time, uh, I bought a, a two hour session with his teacher for
a --

A.92:  Um.

B.93:  -- lady who said she would, had always wanted to go and just play all of
those percussion instruments --

A.94:  Um.  

B.95:  -- that you see, including the gong, the big, big gong and so he let us
into the percussion room and we got to play on every single instrument
[laughter].

A.96:  Listen, let, let me tell you what my, my retirement job's going to be.

B.97:  What?  

A.98:  Uh, I've just been to the Meyerson one time -- 

B.99:  Uh-huh.  

A.100:  -- and the first part was, oh, Schubert and, you know, the usual stuff and
then there was this very modern day piece that had no rhythm, no tune and just
sounded like a bunch of racket.

B.101:  Uh-huh.  

A.102:  And in the, the middle of the stage was this box about, oh, four by four by
four covered with black, black what, I have no idea.

B.103:  Uh-huh.
