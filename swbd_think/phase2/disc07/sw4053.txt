A.1:  What do you do for exercise?  Do you do anything regularly?

@B.2:  [Laughter]  I walk.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Do you?  Uh, how often?

B.4:  Uh, about every other day.

A.5:  Well, that's good, that's good.

B.6:  That's not very much, really.

A.7:  Do you walk very far?

B.8:  Uh, a couple miles.

A.9:  Well, well, that's, that's not bad.  I mean, I know, um, just probably in
the last four or five months I've been able to pick up, um, I go to a gym,
and, and, uh, ride the bike and do the, what's called the stair master, so
that's, uh, I try to do that three or four times a week.  Well.

B.10:  Have, have you done that a long time?

A.11:  Um, I, I am, uh, I have a six month old baby.  He's my third one, and
didn't do it much while I was pregnant, but, um, but, the, about at six weeks
I really began picking it back up, so I've been doing it at least for the last
five, six months.  So.  But before that I did, uh, I did biking.  I like to
swim a lot too.  So.

B.12:  That sounds pretty good.  You're, you're better than I am.  I, uh.

A.13:  It's tough.

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter] It is.

B.16:  I, I have purchased any number of, well, I say any number.  I've purchased
three different, uh, types of exercise equipment, uh, mainly, uh, a rower and
two different, uh, kinds of, uh, exercycles --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- but I have teenagers, and it drives me nuts when I get on and somebody's
screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move.

A.19:  [Laughter] Yeah, I bet.  Well, did you, do you like the rowi-, rowing
machine, because I did that for a while, and.

B.20:  No, I didn't like that.

A.21:  I didn't, I just didn't feel like it was doing much for me, and I don't, I
don't know, if I wasn't doing it properly or what, but I didn't, I didn't feel
like it was doing much #except maybe for my arms.#

B.22:  #I didn't like that.  I, uh,# the uh, like I say, the main problem with me
is I've got to have something that's repeatable --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and, uh, walking is repeatable --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- and bicycling is repeatable.  I bicycle once in a while.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  But if it's any kind of equipment, then, uh, [breathing] I have [breathing]
four kids at home, and they just, there's a joy I think, in changing the
settings --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- and it takes me a while to get back into it.  So.

A.31:  [Laughter] Well, so, do you, do you enjoy your walking or is it just
because you have to exercise, you know you need to exercise?

B.32:  Well, there're two kinds.  One kind is where you just get out and you do it
because you've got to do it --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- and the other kind is, is, uh, actually, most of the walking I've been
doing these days is just a bunch that I'm with, uh, uh, a couple of people in
my group who, we just take off and walk, uh, uh, over to the shopping center
and walk through the shopping center and then come back, which is about a two
mile trip.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  So, it's, but it's a kind of [baby] sedentary job here.  I don't know about
you, but, uh, this job just involves sitting in front of a keyboard all day
long --

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  -- writing computer programs.  

A.39:  Yeah, well, I, I run after preschoolers [laughter] at this point, so.

B.40:  Is that right?  So you get, uh, so you get more exercise than.

A.41:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

B.42:  That's a fair amount of exercise by itself.  Right?

A.43:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, I don't, I mean, you know, we play around and
fool around, but I don't, I don't ever feel, you know, I've [baby] really
worked out, but I, I really have, you know, first going to the gym was really,
really tough, and I've been doing it like early in the mornings before the
kids wake up.  So.  But now it's, you know, I don't like to wake up, but once
I'm up, I enjoy it, and I enjoy the, the challenge of seeing how much further
I can get, and, um, right now, I'm, you know, increasing levels on the bike or
increasing time on the, the stair master.  And, um, so that's, you know, and I
only have a certain amount of time I can do it, and (( )) okay, how many
calories can I burn at this, in this amount of time.  So.

B.44:  Are these, are these, uh, does this gear have some kind of a little
electronic, uh, thing, a read out on it.

A.45:  Yeah.  Um, I'm a member of President's, and so, the, the cycle tells you
how far, you have, uh, levels that you can ride on or walk on, and it tells
you how far you've walked or how far you've biked, and how many calories it's
burned, and you can set it up where you can be going up hills or you can be
going just constant level, and so it's,
