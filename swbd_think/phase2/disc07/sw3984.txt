B.1:  Hi.

A.2:  I'm Bridget.

B.3:  I'm Barbara.

A.4:  It's nice to meet you.

B.5:  Well, it's nice to meet you.  Where are you from?

A.6:  I'm in Lubbock.

B.7:  Oh, I'm in Garland.

A.8:  Are you?

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Okay, good.  You ready for me to push one?

B.11:  Yes, I am.

A.12:  Okay.  [beep]  So what kind of clothes do you wear to work?

@B.13:  I wear dresses, skirts, um, that type of attire.

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  I'm a secretary.

A.16:  Are you?

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  Okay, well, this is kind of a hard topic, because I don't work.

B.19:  You don't?

A.20:  No, I'm in college, so.

B.21:  Oh.  #So you# --

A.22:  #But I think,#

B.23:  -- can dress carefree, right?

A.24:  That's right.  I have on a sweat shirt right now,

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  and, and jeans, [laughter], and I feel great [laughter].

B.27:  What is your best mode of clothing?

A.28:  Pardon?

B.29:  What is your best mode of clothing?  You like blue jeans best?

A.30:  Yeah, but I think if I was going to go to work and stuff, I think a dress
or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure.

B.31:  Yes, that's what I wear mainly is suits, cotton, or, um, gabardine.

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  Wool, sometimes in winter, but here in Texas you don't really need wool --

A.34:  Yeah --

B.35:  -- that often.

A.36:  -- doesn't get that hot.

B.37:  Yes.

A.38:  I don't know, I can't, I would, I wouldn't like to have to wear a suit
every day, though, I wouldn't like that at all.

B.39:  No, I don't do it every day.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  Just occasionally.  Do you have a certain fabric you like better than
others?

A.42:  Um, with dress clothes?

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  I honestly, I don't know, because I haven't had to wear that many dress
clothes yet,

B.45:  [Laughter].

A.46:  to be honest, you know.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  I really don't think I, I don't even, I couldn't even tell you, but I would
say, I don't know.

B.49:  Well, I like cotton the best, it's easier to take care of and it's, it's,
uh, a much fresher and freer fabric.

A.50:  Yeah, that's true.  Anything you don't have to iron,

B.51:  [Laughter].

A.52:  so you can just send to the cleaners sounds great.

B.53:  Well, cotton you have to iron unfortunately, or send to the cleaners, but
there's some fabrics like you said, that, uh, gabardines and suedes and that
that have to go to the cleaners all the time.

A.54:  Really?

B.55:  Yes.

A.56:  Do you wear really dressy dresses --

B.57:  Yes.

A.58:  -- to work?

B.59:  Yes, I'm up in --

A.60:  Do you?

B.61:  -- corporate.

A.62:  Oh, okay, so you go all out and everything.

B.63:  Yes.

A.64:  Yeah.  Well, that would be important, though.  I mean, you would have to.

B.65:  Yes, because the first person they see is the secretary, #before the boss#
--

A.66:  #Uh-huh.#

B.67:  -- and, uh, I couldn't, uh, get away with blue jeans and a T shirt.

A.68:  [Laughter].  

B.69:  [Laughter].

A.70:  I bet you couldn't [laughter].

B.71:  Do you wear sneakers?  Do you wear, um, [smack] {sound made with mouth}
brand names, or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores?

A.72:  Um, I usually get, like I usually get Nike --

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  -- with shoes and stuff like that.  I'm real big, my feet get real sore
real easily.  So I have to have really well padded shoes.

B.75:  I see.  Do you like sweaters?

A.76:  Uh-huh, yeah, I love sweaters.

B.77:  Do you wear them often?

A.78:  Yeah, because it gets really cold up here.  I mean you get the turtle neck
sweater jacket thing a lot.

B.79:  Um.

A.80:  So I mean, I would say mostly, like now it's like you could wear like a T
shirt or sweat shirt, because it's usually chilly in the morning, but it's,
it's warmer at night, but in the winter you have to bundle up, because it gets
really cold.  [laughter] It's a lot different, because I, I'm from Dallas.

B.81:  Oh, are you?

A.82:  Yeah, I think it's a lot colder than it does in Dallas,

B.83:  [Laughter]. 

A.84:  that's for sure, with all the snow and everything.

B.85:  That was my next question is to how you, where you used to live and how you
dressed in comparison to where you were before.

A.86:  Yeah, because I, because I am from Dallas, and I live in Richardson, so --

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  -- I mean, it gets cold there, but it's not cold like it gets here, and I
think here it gets cold and it gets windy, you have that, you know, wind chill
at twenty miles an hour, and it gets like bitter cold --

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  -- and you have to walk across campus and stuff, so you really wear a lot
of clothes, I mean, everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and
everything.

B.91:  Are you into hats?

A.92:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.93:  Do you wear hats and, for dress up too, or just in winter?

A.94:  Um, um, I like one, and I wear it when I dress up, but otherwise I don't
have that many, though.  I don't think about it.  I'm not real good at picking
out clothes.  Like if someone were to buy me an outfit --

B.95:  Uh-huh.

A.96:  -- and put out with it, I would wear it all the time,

B.97:  [Laughter].

A.98:  but as far as me picking out clothes myself, oh, it's not very good
[laughter].

B.99:  In your new, uh, career after college, you going to need clothes a lot?

A.100:  Yeah.  I probably will go to graduate school, because I want to be a
marriage counselor --

B.101:  Uh-huh.

A.102:  -- but I'll still need nice clo-, you know, whatever I do, if I do that or
if I go into business, then I'll still need dress clothes, like nice dresses
and nice suits and stuff like that.

B.103:  Uh-huh.

A.104:  That's what I plan on when, wearing to work when I go to work.

B.105:  Do you like clothes for, uh, different seasons or do you like just to wear
the, basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it?

A.106:  Um.
