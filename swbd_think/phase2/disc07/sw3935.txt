A.1:  You had to return any, uh, merchandise recently?  

B.2:  Yeah, I did, I had to return a pair of shorts I bought for Christmas.  A
winter pair of shorts and the seam was out on, the zipper went out on it,
right away pulled out.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  And the buttons were loose on it.  And it was from, you know, a nice
department store.

A.5:  Yeah [throat_clearing] it's,

B.6:  And, uh,

A.7:  It's interesting, I really hadn't given any thought at all to things like
buttons and seams, but I guess I've just begun to take that for advantage that
buttons are not going to be sewn on, I mean, took that for granted that
buttons are not going to be sewn on very well.

B.8:  I guess that's true, but, you know, you think back and you didn't have to
do --

A.9:  Y-,

B.10:  -- replace buttons or anything. 

A.11:  W-, you're right, you're right.  

B.12:  Very long ago, uh,

A.13:  Yeah, yeah, no, I, I agree with you.  

B.14:  But anymore, it's pretty common -- 

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- that you do.  But when the zipper went on this one, I said, that's it.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  That, you know, that really did it.  

A.19:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, one of my pet peeves is, uh, n-, uh, neckties --

B.20:  Oh.  

A.21:  -- you know, they're just, uh, uh, a nice silk necktie is -- 

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- astronomical.  

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  And it has this little, uh, you know, sewn on bar on the back of the tie
that you tuck it in, you know --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- after you've tied it.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:  And those little, those little sewn bars inevitably come l-, l-, --

B.30:  I know [laughter], they hang.  

A.31:  -- loose.  

B.32:  They hang.  

A.33:  And it dra-, it just drives me crazy, I mean -- 

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  -- it's an integral part of the tie -- 

B.36:  I know it.  

A.37:  -- and it wouldn't take, you know, what, a half a penny of good thread --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- to put it on there securely.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  So, uh, [throat_clearing] anyway, yeah, that's, that's,

B.42:  Yeah, there are a lot of, and how about, uh, any appliances, I've had that
happen with, uh, now I'm just got th-, I have a Sunbeam beater that we've
taken back three times and Sunbeam always had a good name.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  Now that just really shocks me, but I'll tell you, that thing hasn't, I
burnt the motor out twice and I cooked once at Christmas so that's about it
anymore.

A.45:  Well,

B.46:  But, I bake and -- 

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  -- I'm very disgusted with them.  

A.49:  Yeah, I will, I will tell you my experience with appliances, Joan, has been
that, uh, [throat_clearing] well, what happened to me, I had a, a stereo --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- that I, uh, uh, receiver, amplifier that I really liked and it started
messing up.  So I took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at
it was fifty bucks.

B.52:  Um.  

A.53:  [Throat_clearing] But, I, you know, rationalized, and I thought, well, even
if I spend, you know --

B.54:  That's right.  

A.55:  -- seventy five dollars, that's cheaper than buying a new one.  So I wound
up spending the, nearly a hundred dollars on it.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  Took it home, it worked maybe two weeks -- 

B.58:  Um.  

A.59:  -- and exactly the same thing happened to it.  

B.60:  Um.  

A.61:  So I took it back to the shop -- 

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  -- and, you know, bottom line is, I went through all this gyration and --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and aggravation, and unhooking it, and hooking it back up, and hauling
it back and forth to the repair shop, [throat_clearing] eventually, it never
worked right again.

B.66:  Huh.  

A.67:  And I, I wound up -- 

B.68:  Um.  

A.69:  -- buying a new one.  

B.70:  Huh.  

A.71:  I had, I had a similar thing happen with a television.  

B.72:  Right.  

A.73:  And I'm about, I, I just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway,
you know, if they break, throw them away, go get a new one,

B.74:  And go ahead and get a new one anyway, you got a lemon.  

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  You know, and, and I think you're better off in the long run --

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  -- just to chunk it and get a new one.  

B.80:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.81:  But I, I will have to say, and if you think about things like, uh, as,
well, just stereos, for example I can remember the first one I bought whenever
I was in college.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  I mean, I paid a fortune for it.  

B.84:   And you had it forever, though.  

A.85:  Well, that's true.  As a matter of fact, my, I gave the amp to my little
brother, 

B.86:  [Laughter].

A.87:  and he's still using it.  

B.88:  [Laughter] Right.  

A.89:  Yeah, that is true --

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  -- I'll, I'll have to admit.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  [Throat_clearing] But they have come down in price, but there, again,
they're --

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  -- they're made a lot cheaper.  

B.96:  Yeah, they've come a long way with the difference in the, I heard an
interesting thing on this morning on the radio to, going to work about the
Japanese, you know, they have that big thing about the consumers --

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- and how many more hours they work on it and, uh, they were saying that
they did a study on it, and the Japanese actually, uh, I mean the United
States, actually produces six point five percent more product in the time, uh,
more products than the Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time
and work, but they don't get the pro-, productivity out of it --

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  -- and, that they do because of the hours they put it, they, that's what
they l-, they lose and I just thought it was very interesting and they said in
the, and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones that, uh, did
the study.  It wasn't as though we were doing it to show them.  They did the
study.

A.101:  [Throat_clearing] So,   

B.102:  So I g-, I got a big kick out of that one.

A.103:  Yeah, so, yeah, and I, I agree with you.  If we had done it, I would have
thought maybe it was biased.

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  Which, that's a terrible thing to say but,

B.106:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.107:  [Throat_clearing] Well, I don't know, it's, uh, it, we're living in an
interesting time.  I mean, certainly the Japanese have shown that [inhaling]
you know, they can really, produce some quality merchandise --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- and at the same time, uh, I think what it's forced, uh, American
manufacturing to realize, is that they're going to,
