==========================================================================

A.1:  You said you're are fin-, uh, financial planner?  

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  So, do you work with individual, uh, like companies or, I mean,

B.4:  Well, we work with both.  We work with individuals and we work with
companies and executives and, uh, we do business and personal, uh, financial
planning and budgeting and investing for those people.

A.5:  So, how do you handle your own account [laughter]?  

B.6:  How do I handle my own account?  

A.7:  Your, your own budget [laughter].  

B.8:  Uh, well, the first part of be-, of, of a good budget or a good financial
planner is to, uh, number one, don't have any debt.  So, yes, being debt free
is very important and keeping a budget, uh, below your income is important
also.

A.9:  Huh.  Right now I think really the only debt we have is our house and,

B.10:  Oh, that's great.  You're ahead of most of the people out there, then.

A.11:  Well, good [laughter].  

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  But we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on, but we don't
spend, uh, frivolously either.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  Uh, I mean, we don't, I don't, we don't have anything on the computer that
says, oops, we only have five dollars left to spend this week.  You know, it's
not that rigid, uh,

B.16:  Well, a budget does not have to be rigid.  

A.17:  Um, uh, I know, though, I'm expecting and, uh, we're thinking about cutting
down to one salary, and so when it comes down to that, that is going to be
quite a change in our [lipsmack] income because I'm --

B.18:  Sure.  

A.19:  -- not quite fifty percent, but, maybe forty percent of our income is based
on mine.  Uh, so I think when [laughter], when it comes to that time period,
we are going to need to watch our, our funds a little bit more.  Uh, right now
we're struggling with it.  Oh, [inhaling] the thing is that both our cars are
paid off, but they are the same age and h-, my husband's car is American, mine
is Japanese, but his is breaking down a lot more [laughter] --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- and I haven't had any problems and we're, we're, trying to decide, well,
do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it
breaks, you know, and if we do, what kind of car do we want to get and if we
do, do we, should we pay cash for it or, uh, try to get a low interest --

B.22:  Right.  

A.23:  -- you know, interest rate.  

B.24:  [Breathing] Well, and, one thing that really, uh, helps, I find, in
budgeting and, personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior
planning prevents poor results and, uh, lot of people, uh, have not even
considered that maybe that a car payment, a monthly car payment, that they put
it in every month whether they have a car payment or not,

A.25:  [Inhaling].

B.26:  and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to
replace a vehicle when they needed it.

A.27:  We both have done that.  Uh, we both work at companies that have credit
unions --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- so we had direct deposit, you know, for our car payment anyway, and when
my car was paid off I never told them to s-, you know, to stop taking that
money out so they've still been putting in, oh, I don't remember how much my
payments were, two hundred and fifty, three hundred dollars.

B.30:  Well, that is called smart -- 

A.31:  Oh. 

B.32:  -- budgeting.  

A.33:  Good [laughter].  Smart budgeting?  Is that what you said, or just smart,

B.34:  Oh, it's real financial planning, but we're talking about budgeting, so --

A.35:  Uh,   

B.36:  -- that is very smart to do.  

A.37:  And then my husband has done the same thing with his payments so it's just
more to us not necessarily setting up for another car, but just going into
savings.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  And I, I think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are, a-,
uh, well, that's in our goals, I guess for this ((year)), first quarter is to
examine our financial standing, you know, and try to decide how we want to
invest our money because right now the, the, uh, interest rates on everything
seems to be so low that, you know, I don't really see any benefit over, uh,
[breathing] oh, I can't remember what we compared it to, but over putting your
money in, say, a C D or Market Money account or something over just a regular
savings.  There wasn't enough difference in the interest rate --

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- to make a different, I mean, to, uh, I mean, I guess our savings account
is probably a lot more liquid than C Ds or, or, uh, Money, Money Markets.  I
don't know what else there, I know there are a bunch of different things you
can invest in but,

B.42:  Right [laughter].  

A.43:  Right now, I don't know, what do you think the way things are going right
now?

B.44:  Well, uh, uh, with the economy the way it is, it's very important that, uh,
we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we will
need it.

A.45:  Right.  

B.46:  And secondly is, is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't
have to work harder.

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  And, uh, it just takes time to do that and, uh, if a person has capital
resources, uh, or cash on hand to take care of emergenc-,
