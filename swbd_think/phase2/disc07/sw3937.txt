============================================================

B.1:   Okay, what do you, are you doing anything in Utah on recycling?  

A.2:   Well, in, uh, our particular area, uh, we're not other than,
uh, they have a local store that you can take, uh, bottles and cans
and different things to.  

B.3:   Uh-huh.  

A.4:   In their parking lot and, uh, in the winter we haven't been
doing that, but, uh, they don't, uh, that's about all they're
doing.  

B.5:   Is it a small town?  

A.6:   Yes, it's, a rural area.  

B.7:   That makes a difference.   

A.8:   Uh-huh.  

B.9:   Uh, here in Dallas they're trying to, to start some curbside
recycling.  I think they're doing a test.  Uh, personally, my
husband and I do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans, but we
have to, uh, take them, you know, to, to areas, and the problem
that I'm finding is that, uh, a lot of the places I've been taking
things have now discontinued the recycling policy.  Like, it's hard
to find a place to take newspapers anymore.  

A.10:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, so that's, uh, that's basically what happened up here
and then, uh, with all the recycling, the price of aluminum cans
went down.  

B.11:   Oh, really?  

A.12:   Yeah, it used to be a sixty cents a pound, and so people were
collecting them and taking them in to re-, uh, to get money for
them.  Now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound.  

B.13:   Well, I noticed a difference, uh, we go to the Kroger store,
uh, here to take our aluminum cans and I noticed a difference.  You
know, I'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever I took in and I
think the last bunch I took in, which I didn't think was much
smaller, was maybe twenty-six cents.  

A.14:   Yeah, that, that's what's happened and I don't know if that's
from recycling.  I, I understand it is, but here, uh, we, we do
recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts and they, uh,
they're able to make some money, uh, that way, but I have a son in
Illinois who, uh, they pick it up, they have a, a recycling, uh,
garbage, uh, pick up where they have different, uh, receptacles
where they put it in.  They have some for the cans, some for the
bottles and newspapers and then they have the regular garbage and,
#uh# -- 

B.15:   #Uh-huh#.  

A.16:   -- this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks, uh,
and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all
that in.  It seems to be working quite well, there.  That's, uh, in
(( )), Illinois.  

B.17:   Well, you know, what is so sad is people are finally, I think
willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden, uh,
the, the demand isn't there.  

A.18:   #Yes#.  

B.19:   #You# know, it's too expensive to recycle but --

A.20:   Uh-huh.

B.21:   -- I personally feel that we're going to have to pay the
price, you know, whether the government #subsidizes#

A.22:   #(( ))#

B.23:   it, and I'm you know, I, sorry to the gov-, government get involved in
too much of anything else #like that# --

A.24:   #Uh-huh#.

B.25:   -- but, something has to be done.  We're just, uh, we're using
our natural resources, we're filling up the dumps and ...  

A.26:   Well, I've, that's what they, uh, in the local paper here,
they were talking about that, uh, half, about half the, uh, the
material in the dumps is newspapers.  

B.27:   Uh-huh.  

A.28:   They could recycle that, uh, more than they do, then, uh, then
we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else, so I've
been, I, I, I'm all for it.  I just don't know, uh, I know my son,
uh, in Chicago where he has this, they have a, uh, they have to pay
extra to have them pick it up even though, and so that's kind of a,
a burden on my, uh, my son, even though they, they put it in
different containers, they still have to pay extra money to #do#,

B.29:   #Uh-huh.#

A.30:   and, uh ...   

B.31:   [screeching] well, and I know, uh, too, my mother
lives in a rural area, also and it, she would have to go like
thirty miles to recycle anything --

A.32:   ((Uh-huh)).

B.33:   -- and s-, so, of course, she doesn't and plus, uh, it's
difficult for her to drive around just all that much, so, in a case
like that, you know, they have to make it a little bit easier for
people --  

A.34:   Yes, they do.  

B.35:   -- to do that.  

A.36:   Uh-huh.

B.37:   And, uh, I'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling, I'll
be willing to pay a little extra, you know, if they'll go ahead and
pick it up.  

A.38:   #Right.#

B.39:   #Quite# frankly, it will save me one in gas #running around# -- 

A.40:   #Really.#  

B.41:   -- [laughter] all over town.  

A.42:   That's true.  

B.43:   And I take my, uh, paper, I always get paper bags and I take
them back to the grocery store and use them again.  

A.44:   Right.  

B.45:   So, you know, little bit here and little bit there, I guess it
all helps.  

A.46:   Yeah, it really does, if we could just get, uh, people, uh,
all over to do it.  Now, I know, in, uh, south of us about a
hundred miles south in Utah they do have a, uh, area where, uh,
they bring all the garbage in and they, uh, they do have places to
recycle and they really encourage this, and, uh, you can bring it,
and you have different areas.  Uh, that's a small, well, next to
Provo, Utah, I don't know if you're familiar with Utah at all, but
#in# ...   

B.47:   #Not# a lot, but I've heard the name Provo before.  

A.48:   It's where b-, Brigham Young University is.  

B.49:   Okay.  

A.50:   Uh, th-, uh, there, they seem to be having success and, but it
is a, uh, it's done by the, for profit making ((for these 
people)) -- 

B.51:   Uh-huh.  

A.52:   -- and they, of course, are ...
