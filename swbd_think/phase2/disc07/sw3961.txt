A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Well, how many children do you have?

A.3:  Well, I have three, they are all grown --

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  -- but I have three grandchildren that live very close by that [laughter]
--

B.6:  That's great.

A.7:  -- I spend a lot of time with.

B.8:  That's good.  How old are your grandchildren?

A.9:  Oh, let's see, oldest one's fourteen, then the youngest one is six.

B.10:  Well, good, my, we have five children, and our oldest one, uh, will turn,
uh, fifteen next month, and the youngest one, uh, will turn, uh, eight, the
end of April.  So they're about the same, uh, range as your grandchildren.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  Uh, and so, uh, they're pretty busy right now.  We [throat_clearing] the
oldest is in, uh, uh, the ninth grade school here.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Uh, the second one is in, uh, junior high.  Third one is in, uh, what they
call an intermediate school, fifth and sixth grades.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  And the last two are in, uh, an elementary school --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and it looks like we're going to have them in at least four different
schools for, uh, you know, three more years.

A.19:  Oh, yes [laughter].

B.20:  So that keeps us busy running around sometimes.  Are your --

A.21:  Yes.

B.22:  -- are yours in school near there?

A.23:  Yes they are, in fact, you know, I pick them up from school.  Their mother
is also going to school.  She's in nurses' school and ought to be finished in
May, so that leaves me a lot of time with the grandchildren.

B.24:  What kind of things have you done with the kids?

A.25:  Oh, well, like, they are in dance class, and things like that, and I pick
them up from school, and I take them there.  Uh, which, it's all right for one
of them, I think, because she enjoys it and seems to have a talent for it, but
the other one I wonder about.  I think she's just pushed into it [laughter] --

B.26:  Yeah, well, that's possible (( )).

A.27:  -- to have something to do --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- and, uh, I,

B.30:  I guess that trade-off between, uh, you know, letting them just do the
things they enjoy doing, or pushing them kind of, just a little bit of a nudge
so that they, they, um, you know, get into something far enough that they do
enjoy it by themselves, you know, is a tension for most parents.

A.31:  Yes, uh-huh.  Well, I, I c-, can sympathize.  I know I, I would go, when
mine were growing up, uh, from one extreme to the other.  Do you know, I, you
didn't do anything or we did too much [laughter].

B.32:  Right, right.

A.33:  It, it's hard to decide, and, uh, decide when they're old enough to make
their own decisions --

B.34:  That's right, we.

A.35:  -- that, uh, you've, uh, I wanted them to have the opportunities to do what
they wanted, but --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- wasn't sure what that was.

B.38:  Yeah, well, we found out, particularly with piano, we wanted the kids to
take piano for a few years, you know, and I said, well, you need to take it
for, for at least six so that you know whether you want to do it any more.
You build up enou-, enough skill that you can, you make a, a reasonable
choice.  So we pushed for a few years, but then, uh, then we moved and, and
dropped it.  I hope some get back into s-, into something.

A.39:  Well, they may pick it up a little bit #later, and, uh# --

B.40:  #I hope so# [throat_clearing].

A.41:  -- all that, but, I know my oldest one, he is, well, he's an honor student
and just wins all the awards at school --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- but he's not really, outside of school involved in anything other than
the church activities.  So, uh, he's not a baseball-er, or anything like that,
but, he seems very well adjusted and.

B.44:  Most of our focus is either on some school activities or going to, or our
church activities, and they, uh, we just moved here, uh, this summer, and so
we, uh, we're sort of getting into things.  Uh, they've got a good number of,
of activities, and, uh, we enjoy, you know, transporting them to that because
we really hope there's going to be some benefit from those things, you know.

A.45:  Oh, right.  #Yes, that's, that# --

B.46:  #And, uh, so they're.#

A.47:  -- is good.

B.48:  They're doing that.  [throat_clearing] We, uh, uh, haven't gotten into too
many civic activities.  Where we were before they were playing soccer and, uh
--

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and, uh, did a little bit of gymnastics, uh, things like that.  Uh, here
we haven't really gotten into it too much.  Uh, we may later on sometime if --

A.51:  Yeah, I imag-.

B.52:  -- you know, they show particular interest.

A.53:  Imagine it takes a while to settle down and let children settle in school
and --

B.54:  Sure.

A.55:  -- find out friends and what, what it is they're wanting to do.

B.56:  That's right.

A.57:  So.

B.58:  Yeah.  Well, I, uh, I don't know about the time we spend with them.  Seems
like we're with them all the time [laughter] if,

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  we're not here, you know, not working, you know.  Uh, but, uh, I'm sure
they'd like more and it's hard, for us it's hard to balance it.  You know,
there's some that sort of, I don't know about demand, but you know, sort of
just take up more time just by their nature --

A.61:  Oh, yes, uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and, uh, we, we struggle to, uh, I do anyway, not to work so much that
I, I don't give them time, you know, being with them and stuff like that.  Uh,
sometimes it'd be just nice to come to the office and, and work straight
through without, you know, uh, spending time with them, but I like, you know,
I like to spend time with them and be with the kids and all like that.

A.63:  Yeah well, it's, 

B.64:  Do you take them over say,
