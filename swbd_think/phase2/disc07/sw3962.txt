=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music?

@B.2:  Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh,
classical music.

A.3:  Oh, same here.

B.4:  Oh, really.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  What type of music do you like in the classical area, or what era
{mispronounced} do you, era do you like the most?

A.7:  Oh, well, I guess I like a wide range.  Uh, everything from, uh, from
Baroque through at least some modern music.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And my wife and I these days are especially into opera.  We've been sort of
opera fans for a few years now.

B.10:  Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that
they sing other languages?

A.11:  Well, we, uh, generally, the places we've gone they sing in the original
languages.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, uh, if I don't
know the story line and, um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult
time, comprehending what's going on.

A.15:  Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, uh, you, you know, you can
buy a lot of these operas now on video casse-, uh, video tape --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and so we have quite a collection of those, and you watch them at home,
and they have subtitles, so you, you figure out what's going on after a while,
and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  But, you know, the, uh, Dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all
their performances I think.

B.20:  What is that?

A.21:  Well, they, they give an, uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up
above the stage.

B.22:  Oh, I didn't know that.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  That can help people like me.

A.25:  [Throat_clearing] In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in
English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.

B.26:  [Laughter]  Well, I can understand that.  So, I'd say,

A.27:  [Throat_clearing].  

B.28:  Vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.

A.29:  Yeah, well, I really like Vivaldi.  Uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the,
one of the top of that era.

B.30:  Yeah.  I like Baroque music,

A.31:  [Throat_clearing].

B.32:  I like full body music, uh, with the, um, um, with brass and winds,
woodwinds, instruments, #you know.#

A.33:  #Uh-huh.#

B.34:  Course I like, uh, also string instruments, and I have two string
instruments in my house.  Uh, instrument players, both my sons play string
instruments.  One plays the cello and the other one plays the viola.

A.35:  Oh [throat_clearing].

B.36:  So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year [laughter].

A.37:  Uh-huh.  How, how old are they?

B.38:  One is thirteen and one is eleven.

A.39:  So they're doing this in school, or what?

B.40:  Yes.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  Yes (( )).

A.43:  Well, you've got half a string quartet there.

B.44:  Yeah.  We're on our way.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  So, uh, um, I try to enjoy all of it.

A.47:  Well, since you seem to like, uh, Italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten
into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before,
actually before Vivaldi, I guess?

B.48:  Um, a little bit, but, um, a lot of the, um, music I don't know about, uh,
as far as the titles, and I have to listen to it, and --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and figure out,

A.51:  [Throat_clearing].

B.52:  what I'm listening to.  Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society.

A.53:  Oh, yes, uh-huh.

B.54:  Do you belong to that?

A.55:  No, I don't, but I think I know what it is.  Isn't that a, uh, uh, see,
can't you get records through that or something, recordings?

B.56:  You can get recordings.  Uh, they know have them on compact disc or --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- or, uh, or cassettes or L P -s, and, uh, they do their, they do a lot of
original recordings themselves.

A.59:  Yes, yeah, I think, uh.

B.60:  But they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the
different, I guess, what do you call them [inhaling] the guys that orchestrate
--

A.61:  Uh.

B.62:  -- the con-, the conductors.

A.63:  Uh, yes, right [laughter].

B.64:  Yeah.  They go to conductors, uh, and, and they actually have them perform
the music, and they record it.

A.65:  So, they're actually commissioned performances.

B.66:  Sure.  A lot of them are.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  Or they will kno-,

A.69:  [Throat_clearing].

B.70:  find out when they're performing, and they will, uh, record the music at
that time.  And so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music, and, of
course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section, and they also have
a, uh, more contemporary and American --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- uh, composer section.

A.73:  Well, I had go-, heard good things about the, uh, Music Heritage Society,
but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money
on --

B.74:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- on music.

B.76:  Well, you can control it.  

A.77:  I almost, uh, almost, uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman
when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago.

B.78:  Oh, really.

A.79:  Yeah, my roommate signed me up.  He got a bonus record, and I got a lot of
bills  [laughter].

B.80:  I see.

A.81:  So we have to watch that.  

B.82:  Well, that's good.  

A.83:  Uh, do you play any instrument yourself?

B.84:  Yes, I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone.
