A.1:  I'm Bridget.

B.2:  I'm Melissa.  Brigette Moore?

A.3:  Yes.

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  What are you doing?

B.6:  Nothing [laughter].

A.7:  I'm just sitting here trying to eat bread before I go to a meeting
[laughter].

B.8:  Are you in Dallas or Lubbock?

A.9:  No, I'm in Lubbock.

B.10:  Oh, are you?

A.11:  Yeah.  What #are you doing?#

B.12:  #How funny.#  [laughter].

A.13:  Are you at the office?

B.14:  Huh?

A.15:  Where are you?

B.16:  I'm at home.

A.17:  Are you?

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Cool.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  I know, like listen to us, we're like trying to volunteer.

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  Okay, are you ready for me to push one?

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Do we know what we're going to say?

B.26:  About crime?

A.27:  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll push one.

B.28:  Okay.  

A.29:  [Beep]  Okay, so what do you think about crime in the big D?

@B.30:  Well, I'm worried about my car [laughter] #because# --

A.31:  #Are you?#

B.32:  -- I just got a new car, and so, I'm worried about it getting stolen or
anything happening to it at all.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  So.

A.35:  I don't know.  I think in Dallas it's a lot more scary just because it's a
big city.  I mean, in Lubbock and stuff --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- I know lots of people that don't lock their doors or, you know, leave
their windows open at night --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- because it's so much smaller, I mean it feels safer, and I know that it
happens here, but it's not near like it is in Dallas.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  People are more trustworthy, I think --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- people have reason to be, I guess.

B.44:  I don't know, I don't, it doesn't matter where I go, I lock my doors.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  So.

A.47:  I know lots of people that'll leave their doors open, you know, if you have
to go get something, like, get a book or something from their house, you can
just walk right in,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  they're always unlocked or something and.

B.50:  Gee [laughter].

A.51:  I mean.

B.52:  I don't think I'd ever do that if I wasn't at home.

A.53:  See, I know.  And there're only certain, you know, neighborhoods up in
Lubbock that are, that you wouldn't leave your doors unlocked, you know.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  But besides that, I don't know, it's fairly safe, I think.

B.56:  God, even up in like Highland Park, I don't even think I'd leave it open --

A.57:  Really?

B.58:  -- seems like that'd where they'd really go --

A.59:  Yeah --

B.60:  -- for the big houses.

A.61:  -- yeah.  

B.62:  Um.

A.63:  Dallas can be pretty bad though.

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  I think it depend on the city really.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  I don't know though, because I think that way of Lubbock, and then, uh,
like I was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and she was saying how bad it is out there, and I would think it would
be less --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- I was thinking it wouldn't be as bad.

B.72:  Yeah.  I guess it just depends, because there're certain part of the
cities, too.  There's no way I would ever, I wouldn't even leave my car alone
in South Dallas [laughter].

A.73:  See, I know, I know.  That's scary.

B.74:  Um.

A.75:  I don't know, because I still think like out in the country, when she said
that I was like what,

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  I's like no way, and she goes, yeah, she goes, you know, people get broken
into a lot because they, you know, it's real easy to get with there, you know,
no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  I was like, well that's true, but besides that.  

B.80:  Oh.

A.81:  I don't know, and I think it's just getting worse.

B.82:  That's what scares me about living out in the, like off in the country.  I
used to live out in the country --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and that kind of scares me because I think, you know, you always hear
about all those murders, and it's weird to think about --

A.85:  I know.

B.86:  -- but it happens.  [laughter]  And that's the scary part.

A.87:  See, I know.

B.88:  And I don't like living out in the country.  I like living in the city
where I'm close to, there might be more crime, or, as they say, but it just
makes me feel safer because I'm around someone.

A.89:  Yeah, that's true, because you have neighbors and stuff, at least, you
know.

B.90:  Yeah, if I scream, someone's going to hear me [laughter].

A.91:  I know, someone's got to.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  I know, that's scary though.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And it just keeps rising.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  I mean, I can't imagine.  I don't know.  What's, after I've been here so
long it's like, I, well, you'd have to pay me to move back to Dallas.

B.98:  Yeah [laughter].

A.99:  Now, like it, now that I'm away from it and I can look back at how, you
know, Dallas is and stuff --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- I don't like it, I don't like it at all really.

B.102:  #Um.#

A.103:  #I don't know.#  I think it would depend on, #I# --

B.104:  #Um.#

A.105:  -- don't know, where you live, I know that's not right though.  I think
that, but I don't think that's really.

B.106:  I don't know.  I guess, I'm sure there is a bunch of thie-, of thieving
going on in Lubbock, it's just #not# --

A.107:  #Yeah.#

B.108:  -- around you, or not that you know of --

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  -- because I don't know, I mean, a couple of summers ago the people behind
us got robbed, and, you know, we were, everybody was looking out, but ever
since, like a week after that, nobody just even paid any attention any more.

A.111:  Really?

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  See, that's sad.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  I would think like car theft is a really big thing --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- wouldn't you?

B.118:  Yeah.

A.119:  I think that, or.

B.120:  Especially here where we have so many cars.

A.121:  I know, I know.  

B.122:  Everybody in New York takes a cab, and we've all got cars.  

A.123:  See, I know.  I don't know, because that's, I think, I don't know if that
is though, that's what, that would be my guess, car theft, for sure.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  Because I don't burglaries, burglaries, I can't say that,

B.126:  [Laughter].

A.127:  burglaries, I don't know, I don't know if there'd be that, I don't know,
besides people that would be, just have like kids that come in and burglarize
and take like T V -s and stuff that they could sell real easy whereas someone
like cleaning you out, you know.

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  I guess that would depend on it, too.

B.130:  Yeah, a friend of mine's house, he was gone all summer, but he has a house
here by himself --

A.131:  Uh-huh.

B.132:  -- and, um, [laughter] his own friends got in and robbed him.

A.133:  No way.

B.134:  Yeah [laughter].

A.135:  Oh, my God.

B.136:  He has this, he has this like gorgeous bedroom set and that's,
