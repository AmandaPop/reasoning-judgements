===========================================================================

A.1:  All right, uh, 

B.2:  Did you, did you have to wait very long?

A.3:  Excuse me?

B.4:  Did you have to wait very long?

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Oh, I forgot my, I, I had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal
identification number [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter]  Okay.  All right, so, uh, 

B.8:  Are Americans still paying too much, too many taxes?  That's a, that's an
easy one.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Are we supposed to spend the five minutes on this?

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Well, no.  [laughter]  I mean yes.

A.13:  Oh, you think that we are paying too much, #in taxes.#

@B.14:  #Yeah, yeah.# I don't think we're paying a lot too much.  I, uh, I think
we're paying, I, I, I used to live in Sweden --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and I know that they pay a lot more than we do.

A.17:  Yeah, it's even higher, uh, tax rate over there, on income.

B.18:  Yeah, I guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is.

A.19:  Right.  Ar-, are you, you're a nat-, you're from the United States.

B.20:  Yes, I, I'm from Idaho actually.

A.21:  But you worked over there for --

B.22:  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.23:  -- #a couple of year.#

B.24:  When I was living in Sweden I got, uh, uh, kind of an impression of their
system, which is socialistic --

A.25:  Yes.  

B.26:  -- and so they, everything is subsidized by their government.  Their, their
taxes are higher than ours, so I guess I shouldn't be, I shouldn't complain so
much.

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  I, uh, I do get concerned that there's, that there's a lot of, uh,
government spending on things like, um, things (( )) that don't really benefit
anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure, like
restoring some old ship, or something like that.

A.29:  Right.  You talking about special projects in the, the U S, in the U S you
mean now.

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  Okay.  Yeah, it's true, I feel that, um, you know, I don't feel that we're
paying too much taxes, provided we get the right services for what we pay for.
But I think we've kind of gotten away from that.  Um, for what we get, we're
paying too much, I would say.

B.32:  You wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent
value for it.

A.33:  Right, or if, if things, I didn't feel that things were wasted #for, uh,#
--

B.34:  #I can go.# 

A.35:  -- you know, through, uh, red tape, through waste, you know mon-, a lot of
money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how
much goes to just waste.

B.36:  Yeah, I think I have to agree, although I pay an awful lot of taxes,
because I'm single, I'm in a reasonably high tax bracket, so, um, it seems
very expensive to me for what I get.

A.37:  Right, right, typically, um, you don't get a whole lot [laughter].

B.38:  No, although I get some things that I very much appreciate.  I mean, I
don't, I don't have a dictator, I don't, reporting for a dictator, I live in a
free economy, and so, I mean, in a sense I don't mind spending money on, and
welfare, on reasonable amounts of welfare, I don't mind spending money on, and
things like highways and stuff, I don't mind spending on.

A.39:  Well, right, a lot of federal money goes for highways, but speaking of, um,
people who are on welfare, I know one of the presidents, Patrick Buchanan has
a idea that says that, if he's president, if you don't get a job within two
years, then you're taken off welfare, so, to eliminate people who
continuously, uh, kind of leech off the system, you know, you, you have, you
get to spend your time, but then, you're off.

B.40:  Huh.  Don't know if I agree with that or not, because there's people that
just plain, I don't know what the percentage is, but there is some percentage
of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason, although
two years, that does sound like quite a while.

A.41:  Yes.

B.42:  I don't know.  What do you think of that one?

A.43:  Well, I, I guess I'm not, I don't like to make hard and fast rules that you
have to live by, because there's always exceptions, but I think something has
to be done, some type of reform measure.

B.44:  He certainly seems to be looking at the right issue.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  Um, one thing that I've kind of been following that I, I'd really, I'm kind
of waiting for it, and I, maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it,
and that is for President Bush to, uh, see if he can, see if he can give the
line item veto a try.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  And, uh, apparently he's been waiting for a test case, he's been waiting
for quite a while.

A.49:  Um.

B.50:  But, I think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the, one of
these rider bills that's, that's clearly a waste of money --

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  -- and to see how Congress reacts to that.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  That'd be quite an exciting battle.

A.55:  Uh-huh, yeah, I don't know, what's your situation.  I live, uh, I'm a
property owner in the city limits of Atlanta --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and we get taxed tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that
money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was.  Um, I
pay for a local hospital, uh, Grady Hospital, where a lot of indigent people
go and get free care --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and I pay for schools which, you know, maybe homeowners should pay for
that, but, I, I, and a lot of other things,
