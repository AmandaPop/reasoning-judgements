B.1:  Hi.  

A.2:  I'm Bridget.  

B.3:  Hi Bridget, I'm Gunner, I'm here in Dallas.  

A.4:  Are you?  I'm in Lubbock.  

B.5:  Oh, you are?  

A.6:  Yeah.  

B.7:  Oh, okay.  

A.8:  I go to school at Tech.  

B.9:  Oh, okay.  

A.10:  Okay, you ready for me to push one?  

B.11:  Yeah, sure am.  

A.12:  Okay [beep].  Okay.  

B.13:  Okay.  

A.14:  So, what do you think about the elderly and their health care? 

B.15:  Well, [breathing], uh, I think there, uh, you know, need to have, uh, some,
some means of taking care of them in a, in a reasonable and, uh, uh, I guess,
respectful way.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:   And, uh, it's, uh, I guess my biggest problem is that, uh,
they seem to, 

A.18:  [Noise].

B.19:  uh, be, you know, put in nursing homes and just forgotten about.

A.20:  #Yeah,#

B.21:  #That's,# 

A.22:  I think that's really sad.  

B.23:  You know.  Have you, uh, ever spent much time or worked around one or
anything?

A.24:  Yeah, I have.  Uh, my great grandmother was in one and I used to go visit
her a lot.  I think it's sad because, one, it's so expensive --

B.25:  Oh, yeah.  

A.26:  -- just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway.
And then it's like no one goes and sees them.  I think that's really sad.  I
mean, tha-, I didn't even think about that what I first was thinking about
this topic and stuff and that's just, that's, that's amazes me, you know.

B.27:  Is there, uh, uh, well, shoot, I guess there's no, uh, Medicare, I don't
think pays for it.

A.28:  No, I don't think so.  

B.29:  Uh, um.  I don't know, it's just, the whole thing is just kind of amazing
to me.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  Uh,

A.32:  But,

B.33:  [Groan]. 

A.34:  they need someone to take care of them, you know.  

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  You can kind of see both sides.  I mean, the people that have to be in one,
you know, should be, or people that are just put in one, you know, that do not
need serious, you know, medical care, I think that's kind of sad.

B.37:  Yeah, and a lot of other countries, though, uh, uh, you know, basically
like family takes them.

A.38:  Yeah, that's, uh-huh.  

B.39:  And, uh, I guess take them for as long as they are.  

A.40:  Yeah.  

B.41:  You know, as long as they live.  

A.42:  Yeah.  Should go back to that [laughter].  Think more people should do
that?

B.43:  Well, I, yeah, I do, too.  

A.44:  Hard as it may sound or be for some people, it's not really that hard.

B.45:  Um.  

A.46:  Least it would be easier.  

B.47:  Especially now that all the, you know, everybody is getting older and
living longer and,

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  Uh,   

A.50:  That's true.  

B.51:  You know, it's, it's, there's going to be more and more [laughter] folks.

A.52:  Yeah, there's going to be more older people [laughter],

B.53:  [Snorting]. 

A.54:  whether they like to admit it or not.

B.55:   Yeah.

A.56:  That's, true, though, I didn't think about that either.  People got to
think about that.  And just, I just think it's, it's kind of sad even knowing
if your, you know, if your parents would even want to go in one or not, you
know.  I mean my parents are like, no way.

B.57:  Uh-huh.  

A.58:  I know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one.  And I know
that my parents plan to take care of their parents, you know, if it ever gets
to the point where they can't take care of themselves, you know, they're going
to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them.  That's what they have to
do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home.

B.59:  Yeah.  

A.60:  They don't think that's right.  

B.61:  Um.  Yeah, that is, uh, that's difficult, I tell you [laughter].

A.62:  I guess it would depend on a lot of things like, like financial especially.
And depending on how old they are and how, you know, I can see if like, my
grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home, she used to go up there
and see her every day, who, my great-grandmother was in one.

B.63:  Uh-huh.  

A.64:  She used to go see her every day and that is great, but when she got sick,
then, you know, she can't go see her and stuff, and you can't expect, so I
guess ((it would)) depend on how old they were, too, because if, if the p-, if
the children were too old to take care of the parents, then I don't think that
would be very good either.

B.65:  Yeah, yeah.  Um.  

A.66:  Pretty touchy topic.  

B.67:  Yeah, it sure is.  I know like, uh, uh, lot of places it's like hundred
dollars a day.

A.68:  Oh, yeah, at least [laughter].  

B.69:  You know.  

A.70:  They're pretty expensive.  

B.71:  I know, but, uh,

A.72:  But people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse, too, that's,
you know, just as expensive.

B.73:  Is it?  I don't even know.  

A.74:  It is, because I know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in,
((that is)) a big ordeal.  She's like, well, it's just expensive to have a
nurse twenty-four hours a day than it is to put her in a, a place where at
least there's other people, you know.

B.75:   Yeah.   

A.76:   I mean, and she went and saw her every day, like I said, and
that's good I think. because I don't think if, you just put them in
there and forget about them, I don't think that's right.  

B.77:   Yeah, yeah, really.  

A.78:   Think that's sad.
