REMARKS:        Speakers constantly talked over and interrupted
each other.  Also very difficult because Speakers sounded similar. 
Checking was also very difficult as Speakers were not faded out of
each other for checking purposes.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Mike, the subject is almost laughable.  Is there such a thing as an honest
politician?

@B.2:  Well, that's, uh, debatable [laughter].  If you read the paper every day
[laughter].

A.3:  Oh, I agree with you. 

B.4:  Looks like there's a new scandal breaking every, every minute, uh,

A.5:  It's amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties, if you hear
the guy that gimmicks him and uses the same material, it is as pertinent today
as it was then.

B.6:  Yeah, it is.  

A.7:  Um.  

B.8:  That guy that does the traveling show that's -- 

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  -- that's on Broadway and everything now.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Yeah, that's supposed to be great.  I don't know, as long as there are
lawyers [breathing] making up the majority of the state legislatures and the
national Congress, uh, I don't see a lot of change --

A.13:  Attorneys. 

B.14:  -- happening [laughter].  

A.15:  Yeah.  Did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get
out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve
months.  It was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of
a driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased.

B.16:  Isn't that funny, how that -- 

A.17:  Yes. 

B.18:  -- happens to be a correlation.  

A.19:  Yes [laughter].  

B.20:  [Laughter]. 

A.21:  They're not down there to, to live off the salary of, uh, what they're
paid.

B.22:  I'm afraid not.  

A.23:  Course, you know -- 

B.24:  Unfortunately.  

A.25:  -- the, the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only
let ten attorneys a year, graduate each year and that's if fifteen had died
the year before.

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  And,  

B.28:  Right.  I saw a, a lawyer joke book the other day and it, and the title of
the joke was skid marks.

A.29:  Yes, yes. 

B.30:  And, of course, there's a major joke about skid marks and lawyers --

A.31:  Uh,  

B.32:  -- but, uh, I don't know, it just, it's pretty disgusting every time you,
it, it's not just the unethical part of it, it's the self serving part of it
--

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- that bothers --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- me about the politicians.  They're all out either for a particular
controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several, uh, and rather than
really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country,
everybody decides them with this, the constituency in mind or, or afraid that
they're going to hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise.

A.37:  And won't get re-elected.  

B.38:  And, yeah, exactly, and so we, if we just limited terms,

A.39:  I agree with you a hundred percent.  

B.40:  Senators especially and even Supreme Court judges.  

A.41:  Oh, I think all the w-,

B.42:  This appointing them for life is just absurd.  They wind up --

A.43:  I,  

B.44:  -- senile old men making decisions --  

A.45:  All the way down to -- 

B.46:  -- at eighty years old.

A.47:  -- dog catchers of the city, yes, sir. 

B.48:  Just, just say that -- 

A.49:  Limited term.  

B.50:  -- the most you can serve is a couple terms.  

A.51:  Two. 

B.52:  And then get in there --

A.53:  Two.

B.54:  -- and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you
really feel like --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- you should be doing -- 

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- and then you're out of there and go on to something else, instead of
this, 

A.59:  You go to this, you know, get elected to another office and --

B.60:  Because this,

A.61:  -- let somebody else pay you.  

B.62:  Exactly.  Well, at least -- 

A.63:  Uh, you seen the benefits that,

B.64:  -- you decide things, you decide things from --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- the stand point of what's best, hopefully for whatever agency you're
representing.

A.67:  The benefits legislatures, uh, state and senate and, uh, legislatures on
Washington get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable.  They get
their salary for life --

B.68:  Yeah, I know.  

A.69:  -- health benefits for life.  Oh, uh, have you ever --

B.70:  I just --

A.71:  -- noticed when,

B.72:  -- think we ought to, we limit the President, why not terms of the others
and give,

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  There's plenty of other qualified people to run.  

A.75:  They tried that in, in Washington or was in, uh, Oregon, but speaker of the
house was from there.

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  And if approved he would not have been eligible to continue representing
and being speaker and so the --

B.78:  Exactly.  

A.79:  -- v-, voters kicked it, said, no, w-, since we're the one with the, with
the gun right now, we're not going to vote out having the gun c-, having the
power.

B.80:  Um.  

A.81:  So when, I, I don't, L B J is a perfect example of how somebody can be
broke and get into politics and come out rich.

B.82:  That's right.  And above nothing, either [laughter].  

A.83:  [Breathing]. 

B.84:  Starting with Duvall County [laughter].  

A.85:  Well, they, they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of
good competitive edit-, advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials,
number one, number two.

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  I guess L B J has to be a textbook example of politician without any
morals.

B.88:  Yeah, that's, that's probably true.  

A.89:  I don't think --

B.90:  I haven't,  

A.91:  -- one of the question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians
honest.  My opinion, no.

B.92:  #Yeah.#

A.93:  #Because# they won't pass laws against themselves.

B.94:  Well, that's it.  When the very people making the laws are going to be the
ones who would have to pass those, uh, against themselves, it, it sort of, uh,
goes without saying that it would be awfully, awfully tough, unless you could
get, the best thing that could happen to the state legislatures would be, to
be full of just independent businessmen or just --

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- businessmen working for companies that could --

A.97:  Let them,

B.98:  -- somehow get their salary made, uh, justified, you know, or --

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  -- brought up to whatever, over the state salary level, uh,
