==========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  

B.2:  Going to be a hard one, huh?  

A.3:  Yeah, I think so.  

B.4:  Why?  

A.5:  I don't know, well, I'm not one in finances, first of all.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  And, but I do try to keep a family budget.  What about you? 

B.8:  Uh, you know, it's, it's, it's, it is a hard one, because we don't have a
budget [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  We barely have enough to cover what we have, [laughter] let alone keep a
budget.

A.11:  Well, that's the way with us.  That's why I said I try to keep one with, my
husband isn't working and, uh,

B.12:  Oh, is that right?  

A.13:  Yeah and,    

B.14:  That makes it real tough.  

A.15:  And it makes it real tough, you're right.

B.16:  Huh, so how do you, how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that
your bills are paid and,

A.17:  Well, I rob Peter to pay Paul.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  I pay the utilities and the most ex-, uh, biggest bills at the first of the
month.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And then I look, buy the groceries and the smaller bills like middle of the
month, but I have it X-d out to last me for the whole month.

B.22:  Huh.  

A.23:  And he works contract work occasionally so that helps.  

B.24:  What does he do?  

A.25:  He's an electronics engineer.   

B.26:  A what?  

A.27:  Electronics engineer.  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  And, uh, he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with Eastern and
Eastern, uh, went bankrupt.

B.30:  Oh, is that right?  

A.31:  So, yeah, so, uh,

B.32:  Well, that's tough, yeah.

A.33:  #He said he,# 

B.34:  #Especially these# days when, uh, the economy is so bad.  

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  Yeah, I work on commission [breathing] and, uh, and that makes it tough,
too because I, you know, you can't, you can't always budget what you, you
know, you can't have the same budget every month because --

A.37:  That's true.  

B.38:  -- uh, you know, uh,

A.39:  What kind of work do you do?  

B.40:  I am in the roofing business.  

A.41:  Oh. 

B.42:  Commercial roofing business.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  And so, you know, I may do real well this month, but, uh, next month it
may, you know, may not rain at all and we not have any work so,

A.45:  That makes it really hard, too.  

B.46:  It makes it really hard to, to set any budget and, uh, you know, so, uh, I
guess it's, uh, you know, each family has their own, own way of doing, I, I do
it about the same way you do, you know, we pay what, what needs to be paid so
that we don't, you know, we don't have the lights turned off or have the, e-,
water turned off or the phone turned off.

A.47:  Do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or --

B.48:  No.  

A.49:  -- anything like that?  

B.50:  I don't.  Uh, m-, mostly because we don't, uh,

A.51:  Have it to do it, right.  

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  So, how about you?  

A.55:  No [laughter], I'm the same way.  I saw where, uh, Castleberry won.  I was
in that, uh, p-, Publisher's Warehouse.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  I never send those either.  But I thought, well, maybe you do have a chance
after all.

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  But, uh,

B.60:  Huh, no, I, you know [noise] most of the, uh, most of the financial, uh,
problems that we have, you know, are things that we kind of brought on
ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves a couple of, you know, few
years ago --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- with, uh, credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and, you
know, I was out of work for a coup-, you know, for little while and, uh, you
know, been on commissions for, you know, few years and it's just, uh, we just
never got caught up, so.  Do you own your own home?

A.63:  Yes, we do.  

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  Yes.  

B.66:  Well, we do, too, and that makes it even -- 

A.67:  Harder.  

B.68:  -- tougher,

A.69:  [Laughter].  

B.70:  because, you know, we tried to put our house up for sale and, uh, economy
is so bad, we couldn't sell it.

A.71:  Yeah, well, when we bought, the econ-, the, uh, real estate was really high
and now with the last appraisal we got and everything, it really went down.

B.72:  Yes, well -- 

A.73:  So that if -- 

B.74:  -- we did, too.  

A.75:  -- if we were to try to go on the market, we'd have lost money.

B.76:  Yeah, well, we got, we, you know, all we asked out of our house was the,
the note.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  And, uh, shoot, uh, somebody came and, and offered us, we would have lost
twenty thousand dollars on our home, you know, if we were just to sell it.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  And, uh, so we decided to keep it and kind of just, uh,

A.81:  Try to hang in there.  

B.82:  Yeah, try to make things, uh, work.  

A.83:  Does your, where does your wife work?  

B.84:  She doesn't, I mean, she d-, actually, she does, she actually probably
works more than I do, but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home.

A.85:  Oh. 

B.86:  And, uh, so, the only, you know, I guess, bright, uh, uh, thing that we
have to look forward to is that I own part of the company that, that, uh, I
work for and, and so that's kind of helping us out, you know, it's making
things a little more, uh, [lipsmack] little easier --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- because I can always count on a check on Friday.  

A.89:  Do you just go commer-,
