=======================================================================

B.1:  Hi.

A.2:  Hi, I'm Bridget.

B.3:  Hi, I'm Joan.

A.4:  Oh, bull, Mrs. Slaubacher?

B.5:  [Laughter]  This is a riot.

A.6:  What are you doing?

B.7:  I, I'm making money, what are you doing?

A.8:  The same thing.

B.9:  Push your one and let's get with it.

A.10:  Okay.  Hold on.  [beep]  Okay.

B.11:  Okay.  All right, so what do you think about raising kids?  You don't know
#anything about this.#

@A.12:  #Well, I don't have kids,# so it's kind of hard to say.

B.13:  It is kind of hard, for you.

A.14:  But, I think that, I mean, I think it's kind of sad that, like they're
talking about like what the trends are today --

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  -- I think it's kind of sad that people are so, uh, involved with their
careers and stuff that they don't take time for their kids.

B.17:  I do to.

A.18:  I think it's really sad.  I think they should re-evaluate their priorities.

B.19:  That's true.

A.20:  Because I was waiting to get someone that would say, Yeah, well, you know,
it's hard to spend time with my kids, and I'll just go and be like --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- gritting my teeth,

B.23:  [Laughter].

A.24:  hoping not to say something I didn't mean to.

B.25:  Right, right.

A.26:  But I think #it's really sad.#

B.27:  #But, I think# you need to take that, for the little bit of time it takes
like, for, or about ten years out of your life of really being around them
when they really need you --

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  -- at their younger ages, it's worth that ten years, and it pays off, I
think.

A.30:  See, I do too, I agree.

B.31:  Because the ten years isn't long --

A.32:  No.

B.33:  -- until you can work on your career, and then you have forty years more to
do your career.

A.34:  I know, if you don't, if you want to have a career that's fine, but I don't
think you should have kids, #you know,# --

B.35:  #Yeah.#

A.36:  -- or wait until you're --

B.37:  That's true.

A.38:  -- ready to give up some of it.

B.39:  That's true. I, well, you know, some of the, um, I see it with our teachers
that have waited for, until they're thirty-four --

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  -- thirty-five --

A.42:  Really.

B.43:  -- and that first one, boy, you'd think they were the only ones that ever
had kids --

A.44:  Really.

B.45:  -- yeah, they really love it.

A.46:  That's great.

B.47:  I think they're kind of sorry then they didn't --

A.48:  That they waited.

B.49:  -- that they waited that long, because they really enjoy them a lot --

A.50:  See, uh-huh.

B.51:  -- and I see that a lot with the young girls that's think that's all they
wanted was careers --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- and then when they hit around thirty-four, thirty-five they decide well,
the really wanted to try motherhood --

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  -- and, uh, that happens.  But, I agree, if they, if they want a career,
though, I think they should go with the career and forget the kids, but.

A.56:  See, I do too.

B.57:  Yeah.

A.58:  I mean, it sounds bad, and I know people will totally disagree and say it
shouldn't have to be a choice, but --

B.59:  Right.

A.60:  -- for the welfare of the kid, I think it is.

B.61:  Right.

A.62:  #Or at least it.#

B.63:  #Are you at# school now?

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  Are you?

A.66:  Yep.  I'm in Lubbock.

B.67:  That's a riot.

A.68:  How hilarious.

B.69:  Yes.

A.70:  (( )) knew that was you, I was like, Oh, my gosh.

B.71:  What are some of the things you think the parents should do with their
kids?

A.72:  Golly, anything, I mean, take them to the park on Saturday, or --

B.73:  Right.

A.74:  -- golly, I mean, even if they say they don't have time for kids, they
should sit down and eat dinner with their kids --

B.75:  Yeah.

A.76:  -- that would take #all of thirty minutes.#

B.77:  #See, I think that dinner time# is real important with kids.  That's when a
lot of things would come out --

A.78:  Yeah.

B.79:  -- that if you, and you'd make, I know that when they're all going all
different directions, but I used to at least make three me-, three meals out
of a week they had to be together --

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  -- and I kind of insist on it, and they were pretty good about it.  They
hated to miss it, because they'd hear about the good time we had if they
weren't around.

A.82:  Yeah.  I just think it's important.

B.83:  Yeah, I do, too, because that's when, I don't know why, but kids start
talking when you're around a dinner table and all, they start telling all the
things.

A.84:  Yeah, especially, you had so many kids, too, though --

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  -- so you get to hear the whole scoop on everyone, because everyone would
know.

B.87:  Yeah, and, uh, but I think a-, any entertainment that you can do with them
is fun, though, we, we, you know, we always loved to go camping --

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  -- and that's great, even, even now we go camping, in fact we have one set
up in May --

A.90:  Really?

B.91:  -- and the grand kids come. 

A.92:  Oh.

B.93:  Now it's the grand kids.  I mean, we started out when the kids were young
doing this, and now they bring their babies, um, Mary's baby was four weeks
old when we took her --

A.94:  How cute.

B.95:  -- took him, and, uh, we start them out real young, even --

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  -- and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them on --

A.98:  Really, see that's great.

B.99:  -- and they love that outdoors.

A.100:  I'd love to do that.

B.101:  Yeah, and we go fishing from the time they're little and, uh, the daddies
take them out in the boats.  It's fun.

A.102:  See, this is important.

B.103:  Yeah.

A.104:  I know, I get engaged and I was like, so, (( )) you going to think of any
of those kids, and I was like, Golly no, you're not married yet.  Oh.

B.105:  [Laughter].

A.106:  (( )) kids.  I'm not ready.

B.107:  Yeah.  Well, I think any, any outings with kids is wonderful --

A.108:  Yeah.

B.109:  -- makes you get to know them better, and another thing I like is, um, just
making sure you have time with each one alone.

A.110:  Yeah, that's, uh, important.

B.111:  Yeah, even, you know, no matter how many you have, you should take a
special day, a special time for one --

A.112:  For each, so they don't feel like there isn't singled out.

B.113:  -- and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch, or just taking
them to the park alone, and #you'd# --

A.114:  #See.#

B.115:  -- be surprised what they'll talk about when you're just sitting there in a
swing --

A.116:  Yeah.

B.117:  -- talking.

A.118:  (( )).
