==========================================================================

B.1:  is all you needed.

A.2:  Huh.

B.3:  I think just one is all you needed.

A.4:  Yeah, I pushed a, an auto dial.  Um, so, do you all have a family budget?

@B.5:  Well, we don't right now.  We're planning on setting one up as soon as I
can get some, you know, some better ideas on how to do that.  Have you used
one before?

A.6:  Yeah, we, um, a couple of years ago took a class, um, that was offered, was
a guy at our church --

B.7:  Um.

A.8:  -- um, called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue.

B.9:  Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.

A.10:  You've, you've heard of him?  

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  It's, it's been really good.  We've, um, we're on a, a monthly budget and
pretty much, and we, we designed our own, um, ideas of, you know, these are
some set things that, that we know we're going to spend --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- and, um, the rest we have in categories, but, for the most part, it's
been somewhat discretionary, um.  The, like right now, and the next month will
probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer, and
so, we may spend a little more there and a little less in a-, in another area.

B.15:  [Noise]  Uh-huh.

A.16:  So, um, but it's worked really well.  We've been able to save, um, you
know, what we've wanted to save, and, and, uh, pretty much been able to do
what we've wanted to do, and we have some long term goals that we want to do.

B.17:  Have you put money into those categories [child_talking] or what do you do
for that sort of thing?

A.18:  Well, [throat_clearing] we, um, I, I keep the books and I'm the one that
writes all the, um, all the bills and stuff, and pretty much I just know what
I [child_talking] have to spend.  {softly to child off phone} No, you may not.
{back to normal} Um --

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  -- I know what I need to spend, or what I have to spend, and I just try not
to spend it. [child_yelling] I know some people do, um, envelope --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- systems and stuff, but --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- I don't find that works real well for me.

B.25:  Well, do you have any money that you, uh, specifically set aside for
certain, uh, you know, savings objectives?

A.26:  Yes.  We have, um, we have like a college fund for our kids, and we have,
um, a house fund, and we have a car fund and,

B.27:  Where do you put that money?

A.28:  Uh, we put it in a savings account.  Or we have some of [child_talking] it
in C D -s and stuff, but we, we take that out every month, and then divide it
up into the categories that, that we have, and we also, we have a category of,
of short-term --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- goals that we put aside money each month, and if we want to, like right
now we're getting ready to put up a fence, and that will come out of there.

B.31:  Oh, yeah.

A.32:  It's money that, we have it budgeted for, you know, things --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- you know, things like that, and then, um, that's where it will come
from, and if we don't have the money in there, we have to wait until it's, you
know, up to where we, where it needs to be.

B.35:  That's probably the key part right [child_talking] there, is waiting until
you get the money that you budgeted.

A.36:  I, I'm sorry, I, I didn't hear you.

B.37:  I say, that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money
that you've planned for is there.

A.38:  Yeah [laughter].

B.39:  What about credit cards, do, have you, do you still use those or,

A.40:  Um.

B.41:  Is that part of the system to discontinue that?

A.42:  Well, he recommends that you don't, um, or he hel-, he recommends that you,
you get them down.  We, we've never been real big credit card users --

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  -- and we always pay it off, um, every month, if we use them.  Um, we're
not real big cash carriers, so occasionally we will spend, or we, you know,
will put, uh, a meal on it or, um, [child_yelling] I don't know, sometimes
I'll do mail order stuff, and I'll put it on there, but it, we always, you
know, we always work it out where, where we pay it off at the end of the
month.  So we don't put just a whole lot on there.  We don't use them just
real, real often.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  Except I do use my gas, I keep track of my gas on my credit cards --

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  -- because that, you're not financed charged on there --

B.49:  Right.

A.50:  -- and you don't, and you don't, um, you don't need to have cash there, and
they don't, now you can get it at, cash is the same price as credit --

B.51:  Yes.

A.52:  -- so.  

B.53:  (( )).

A.54:  Are you married?

B.55:  Yes, we are, I am, and, uh, we've got some children, and, uh, you know,
we've just seen the need for, well, we just moved into a house, uh, that we're
renting and,

A.56:  [Laughter] Which will suck up your money real quick [laughter].

B.57:  Yeah, it really will.  So [child_yelling] we're, you know, we're going to
have to rent with a hard look at our expenses and things like that, and, um,
you know, really make the dollars go a bit further if we can.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  We, uh, had not been paying very much for housing, since we moved to Dallas
in July, and, uh, we'd go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like
that, and, I think we're going to have to kind of watch what we do now,
because that can add up with five kids.
