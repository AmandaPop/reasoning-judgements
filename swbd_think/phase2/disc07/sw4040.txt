B.1:  Uh, hello Steve.  

A.2:  Hello.

B.3:  Uh, you were going to talk about child care.

@A.4:  Yeah, uh, we, me and my wife, we got a five year old, and --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- we have, uh, kind of like child rearing.  He, we have problems with him
every now and then --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- but other than that it's, it's pretty, he's a pretty good kid.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  And we, uh, really don't really have any problem with finding day care for
him, because I'm in the service, and we just take him to the day care on base.

B.11:  I see.  How much, how much do they charge?

A.12:  They charge about forty-five dollars a week.

B.13:  Uh-huh, that seems relatively low, by commercial standards, isn't it
usually about sixty to a hundred a week?

A.14:  Um, yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty expensive on the outside.

B.15:  Right.  Um, so you've, you've been, you've been pleased with the service?

A.16:  Oh, yeah, they do a lot of, you know, lot of stuff in, in their day care
and stuff.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  Uh, how long have you been taking your son there?

A.18:  Oh, about a year now.

B.19:  Uh-huh.  Before that, did he go somewhere else or,

A.20:  Well, before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom.  

B.21:  I see.

A.22:  Now she went back to school, so.

B.23:  You say, you went back to school?

A.24:  No, the wife went back to school --

B.25:  Uh, I see, uh-huh.

A.26:  -- so he's been there for almost a year now.

B.27:  Uh-huh.  Um, gee, I think, [laughter] [throat_clearing] where, where does
she go to school?

A.28:  She goes to U T, uh, Arlington.  

B.29:  Uh-huh, okay, yeah, I had a student who went there at one time, but I think
we're getting [laughter] off the topic [laughter].

A.30:  Yeah [laughter].  Uh.

B.31:  So, um, [smack] let's see, I, I, was, uh, I read a lot of articles on child
care back when it was, there was a debate in Congress over funding of, uh,
child care centers and what should be done --

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- and I came out, uh, very much in favor of a tax credit approach, where
parents would be given a tax credit, and they would select whatever services
they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize
certain providers --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- and, uh, that was, I, I thought it was import-, well, I mean, it is
important, uh, that, that people have the opportunity to select the service
that they would choose, because a lot of kids are in, you know, in centers,
well not really centers, but they're being cared for by neighbors, and, uh --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- uh, that's the sort of, they, they, they prefer it that way, the parents
do, because they know the people who are caring for their kids, and they don't
have to take them very far.  Plus about a third of the kids are in church run
centers, and there was a big church state controversy over whether the
government could fund those are not.  I think they ultimately decided to, but
they placed a lot of restrictions on it, so it wasn't clear that the church
child care centers would want to go to the trouble.

A.38:  Um, yeah.

B.39:  So, uh, anyway, [laughter] I continue to be an advocate of the, um, of the
tax credit approach.  Now, myself, I'm not married, so I don't have any kids
and it's not a problem, but, uh,

A.40:  [Laughter].

B.41:  still I know a lot of people that do, and, uh, you know, I mean, you, you,
you really would-, would-, um, well, I'm on, gee, I'm on the benefits
committee at the University here, and, uh, child care is a topic of
conversation.  We, the University started up a center this year, but it's
about two miles away from campus, and I'm not sure it's going to be real
convenient for people to take their kids over there.

A.42:  Yeah, well, when I was stationed in Lubbock, Texas, uh, they had a child
care center right on base --

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  -- uh, right at the school, I mean.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  And, that helped out my wife, because she just went part time there, and --

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  -- you know, take a couple of classes a week, but --

B.49:  Right, uh-huh.

A.50:  -- and, uh, I think it's a good deal, but, um, like you were saying, it's
about two miles from the school, and that's --

B.51:  Yeah, it's just a lot of time.

A.52:  -- it's not going to be very good.  I think they should talk about putting
one right on the campus itself.

B.53:  Yeah, well they say, they claim that it's a better environment for kids,
than to be in with all the students [laughter].

A.54:  Well, they kind of have this, I think, in a different building, you know,
on, right on the out-, uh, edge of the campus and everything --

B.55:  Uh-huh.

A.56:  -- where they really didn't get in, in (( )).

B.57:  Yeah, I'm sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire
the building.  If they would have built a new building then it would have,
I'm, I'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they, uh, if they put down
where they did where real estate's probably cheaper.

A.58:  Oh, yeah.  Um, I think they used one of the existing buildings they already
had --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- so, you know, it, it worked out pretty good.

B.61:  So, so what do you think about the, about the child, about the tax credit
versus the subsidy approach?  Which seems most appealing to you?

A.62:  Well, I haven't really thought about it like that [laughter].

B.63:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.64:  Because, well, #we pay,# 

B.65:  #I think,# 

A.66:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.67:  well.

A.68:  excuse me, we pay for any, you know, the child care, but we don't pay as
much as they do off base.

B.69:  That's right, yeah.

A.70:  Uh, I think the government should subsidize some of it, you know, to give
the parents, you know, some break on the money portion of it.

B.71:  Well, I mean, they, they, yeah, they, the issue is whether they can take it
off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are
qualified.  The other pro-,
