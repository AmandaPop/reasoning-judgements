=============================================================================

A.1:  I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict
is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict
someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.

B.2:  Definitely.

A.3:  Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure
that.  I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is
very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh,
you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Have you ever served on a jury before?

B.6:  Uh, I have twice.  

A.7:  Oh, okay.

B.8:  It was a pretty wild experience.

A.9:  Uh, what sorts of cases were they?

B.10:  They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks
were involved, you know.

A.11:  So were they criminal or civil?

B.12:  They were civil.  #They weren't# --

A.13:  #Oh, okay.#

B.14:  -- they weren't any criminal.

A.15:  What, uh, what was the verdict?  Did the, did the jury have trouble
reaching a decision?

B.16:  Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the
jury, because they only had to have eleven people --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- so it was, they, and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.

A.19:  So did it become?

B.20:  So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- and then he changed his mind after they turned it in --

A.23:  Uh.

B.24:  -- but it then became unanimous.

A.25:  Uh.  But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?  You
just needed a majority?

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  What was, what was the other case?  That was also civil?

B.28:  The, the other case was just traffic, the, and, you know, it was seat belt
law --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- and it, it didn't even hardly --

A.31:  Oh, didn't really even count.

B.32:  -- go through, so.

A.33:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm a college student so I haven't been, you know, a jury
eligible age for very long --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point, but I declined
it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad
time.

B.36:  Yeah.  Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.

A.37:  Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,
but, I, I haven't.  Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe
is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty
well now, but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
#Especially sort of.#

B.38:  #I wouldn't think# that it does --

A.39:  How, wha-, 

B.40:  -- I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them, it didn't, you
know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would
think that it would go.

A.41:  Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?

B.42:  Yeah, but it was, you know, it was, jury was unorganized and it was, it was
just wasn't organized enough for me.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  I'm not used to it not being organized, and I just assumed that it would
have been.

A.45:  Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of, someone had
to figure out what was going on?

B.46:  That's about what it was.

A.47:  Um.  That's interesting.  Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?
I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of
a moderator role in the trial or,

B.48:  Yeah, they, well they picked one person, and then he finally, you know,
moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.

A.49:  So it work-, it did end up working out pretty well?

B.50:  Yeah, it ended up working all right.

A.51:  The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether,
especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical
malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made
sometimes --

B.52:  Yes.

A.53:  -- you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip
off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of
a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I
wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in
educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under
discussion.

B.54:  I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really
know what's going on.

A.55:  In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank
matter of some kind.  So.

B.56:  Yeah, the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the,
the trailer --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- that, which was, uh, seemingly their property.  

A.59:  Uh.

B.60:  It was on his property.

A.61:  Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy
it, and --

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  -- he hadn't made the payments.

B.64:  So they came to get it.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property
and he wouldn't let them take it off.

A.67:  Uh, so they were suing to get it back.

B.68:  So, and they are, it was a double wide, so they'd already taken it apart.

A.69:  Uh.

B.70:  So they left it there --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had
rained and got all in it.

A.73:  Uh.

B.74:  So they were suing him for the money, and, you know, there's no way they
could because it, it was the moving company,
