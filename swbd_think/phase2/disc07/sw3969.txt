A.1:  talk in the background.

B.2:  Oh, well.

A.3:  [Laughter] She, I don't know what she sees outside.  Well, what kind of
music do you like?

@B.4:  Well mostly rock.

A.5:  Rock?

B.6:  Yeah. 

A.7:  Uh.

B.8:  What about you?  [laughter].

A.9:  Oh, everything.

B.10:  Well, I like, well, I like different, you know, different things --

A.11:  Um.

B.12:  -- but, uh, primarily, you know, rock and roll.

A.13:  What era of rock and roll or whatever did you (( ))?

B.14:  Oh, you know, well, you, I, I really like more the modern stuff, you know,
but I like the oldies, you know, they're okay.

A.15:  #Uh.#

B.16:  #Uh,# yeah, I listen mostly to the, you know, the modern stations.

A.17:  Um, I guess we listen to a lot of things.  Um, I grew up with, uh, with
rock and roll, #and# --

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  -- older brothers and sisters --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and, uh, so I, I remember always being kind of ahead of my peers, just
because, um, you know, in third grade I was listening to --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- to groups and stuff that peo-, you know, third graders usually aren't
interested in music by that time.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  And, I think now, I listen, we listen to a variety of stuff, um, jazz, or
country and western or,

B.26:  See, now I don't like country and western.

A.27:  Do you not, #I,# --

B.28:  #Uh.#

A.29:  -- I don't like the old, the old.

B.30:  I don't like mo-, you know, most of it I don't like, but I recently saw
that Garth Brooks show --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- and I thought he was terrific.

A.33:  Yeah, I.

B.34:  And I really thought, I mean, I thought he was a great, you know, really
wonderful entertainer the way he, um, he, you know, he was very good.

A.35:  I, there, I think country music, I don't like the real old twangy stuff
like the --

B.36:  I don't like twangy, no, I don't.

A.37:  -- you know, but, but, it has under-, undergone a lot of change, and
there's a, like there's a guy named Lyle Lovett that, he could be considered.

B.38:  Oh, he's really not that, uh, country, #I mean# --

A.39:  #But.#

B.40:  -- I've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too --

A.41:  Yeah, see --

B.42:  -- you know.

A.43:  -- he doe-, it's more, what do they call it?

B.44:  I don't know  [laughter].

A.45:  Sometimes I've heard it called Rockabilly --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- where's it's like rock and roll and or country, but, um, but they refer
to him, you know, as a country singer, but a lot of his stuff sounds really
jazzy.

B.48:  Yeah, right, I, yeah, I have heard him, and, uh, I didn't think he was a
country singer, you know, I.

A.49:  Oh, they, I mean, they, they term him, uh, that, but I, I know, well, I've
watched like the music awards, or --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- the country music awards before, and they had him --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- on as a new up and coming country singer.

B.54:  Oh, well.

A.55:  So, it's kind of, I mean, but there's a lot of people kind of like that
that they're, they're pla-, they're right on the line --

B.56:  Yeah --

A.57:  -- and --

B.58:  -- that's true.

A.59:  -- you know, the, at, uh, the, I guess the rock and roll side might be so
saturated that, you know, they're trying out this, and, and we've gone country
and western dancing [laughter] before --

B.60:  Oh, really [laughter].

A.61:  -- and, but, and it, when, I don't, I don't dance, I mean country dance
that well, but, you know, just watching the people, when they get out there is
when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a
break --

B.62:  Oh.

A.63:  -- you know, [laughter] I mean they get out there and jitterbug and, or,
you know, whatever you want to call it --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and, uh, so, I think there's, there's a lot of people out there now that
aren't, aren't just Johnny Cash [laughter] fans or --

B.66:  Yeah, yeah.

A.67:  -- you know, or, um, oh, I don't even know what (( )),

B.68:  You know, well I said, let me watch this and see what all the fuss is
about, I mean, everybody's raving about this guy, you know, and my son, I have
a son, he's, uh, twenty-four, and of course he hates country music, and he
said Ma, I can't believe you're going to watch that.

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  I said, I have to find out.  My best friend said she likes him.  I said, If
Linda likes him, I said, he goi-, not, he couldn't be all wrong, you know --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- I mean, he's, there's got to be something good about the guy [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  So I watched it and really, I, I just thought he was terrific.

A.75:  I saw previews of it, and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than.

B.76:  I don't know, but I mean, and his songs, uh, uh, were, you know, I liked
them --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- uh, they weren't, they weren't that silly country western stuff that,
you know, they used to do years ago, you know --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- with, with dopey lyrics, you know, very simple lyrics, you know,
there's.

A.81:  And there's still some out there like that, too.

B.82:  Yeah, oh, there are, but, uh, yeah, I think as a whole it's gotten more,
definitely more sophisticated in the, you know, in the past few years.

A.83:  Yeah, I do, too, I do, too.

B.84:  You know, but then I wouldn't li-, you know, listen to it, uh, you know,
steadily, uh --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- you know, I wouldn't listen to it at all, actually [laughter] --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- you know, I just don't really care for it any, you know, as a whole,
but, uh.

A.89:  What sta-, do you listen to radio?

B.90:  I usually listen to either the, uh, classic rock, it's uh, ninety-two or,
or, uh, one oh two.

A.91:  Yeah, I switch around.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  Uh.

B.94:  And then my husband loves the oldies, you know, every time he, he gets in
the ca-, the car, he sticks on the oldies station.

A.95:  Well, it's funny, because my, my father, um, I'm youngest of six, and we
all play some type of music interest, in-, instrument, and I had a couple of
brothers that were in rock and roll bands, and so forth, so, you know, he was
constantly having to grow up with us.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  So at Christmas or his birthday, we're always buying him tapes --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- you know to keep,
