=========================================================================

A.1:  Hi.  

B.2:  Hi there.  

A.3:  I'm Bridget.  

B.4:  My name is Scott.  Where are you calling from?  

A.5:  [Barking]  I'm calling from Lubbock.  Where you calling from? 

B.6:  I, oh, I live in Dallas.  

A.7:  Oh, do you?  

B.8:  Yep.

A.9:  [Barking].

B.10:  But I, I'm out of breath because I had to run,

A.11:  [Barking].

B.12:  to find my card because I didn't remember my PIN.  

A.13:  Oh, really  [laughter]?  

B.14:  I haven't done this in a while.  It's been probably three or four months, I
think.

A.15:  Really?  

B.16:  Yeah well, we,

A.17:  [Barking].

B.18:  we got on it, um, a long time ago, but then it was down so much of the
time,

A.19:  [Barking].

B.20:  we kind of got out of the, out of the habit.  

A.21:  Huh.  

B.22:  So anyway, so what are we supposed to talk about?  

A.23:  I think we're supposed to talk about magazine --

B.24:  Oh.

A.25:  -- magazines.  

B.26:  Okay.  So what, so what magazines do you take?  

A.27:   Uh, I don't take any.  Do I need to push one first?  

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  Okay, hold on [beep].  Okay.  

B.30:  Well, now, if you don't take any magazines, why did, why did you want to
talk about magazines?

A.31:  I didn't, [laughter] I called in and it told me to talk about.  I don't
subscribe to any magazines, do you?

B.32:  I subscribe to lots of magazines.  

@A.33:  Do you really?  

B.34:  Yes, my family, well, we're, we're kind of renowned for being big magazine
subscribers.

A.35:  Really?  So how come you like subscribing to them?

B.36:  Well, because I, I, I have a lot of interests and, and the magazines have a
lot of interesting articles and, and it's just my,

A.37:  [Barking].

B.38:  way to keep and, my wife's sitting here telling me it's because I'm a
bookworm [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter]. 

B.40:  Uh, so she calls it a two bookworm.  No, I like read, and so, I take a lot
of magazines.

A.41:  So what magazines do you get?  

B.42:  Well, let's see,

A.43:  [Barking].

B.44:  I get a magazine called THE ECONOMIST.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Get the ATLANTIC MONTHLY, I get HARPER'S.  Uh,

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  We get NEWSWEEK, uh, I get, uh, magazine called FINE WOODWORKING.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  Uh, what else do we get here {to someone else in the room}?  

A.51:  [Barking].

B.52:  Uh, let's see, then I get a bunch of magazines at the office, like FORTUNE,
and FORBES.  I, oh, I get the NEW REPUBLIC here at the house as well.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  I read BUSINESS WEEK.  Uh,

A.55:  Goodness [\barking].  

B.56:  So, I don't know, we, I probably, some, and sometimes I take them for a
while and then,

A.57:  [Barking].

B.58:  sometimes I, I, you know, I let them lapse and then I'll get something new.

A.59:  Uh-huh, so you get, well, [barking] you get a l-, see, I'm in college so --

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  -- uh, you get mostly business magazines.  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  So all the magazines I ever see, they're just advertising, so I don't ever
subscribe to them so,

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  But that's good, though.  

B.66:  Are, are you in school out at, out at Tech?  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  Really?  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  Which year are you in out there?  

A.71:  I'm going, I'm a senior.  

B.72:  You like it?  

A.73:  Yes, I love it.  

B.74:  Well, how did you get on this, uh, T I thing, then?  

A.75:  See, my parents are from Dallas -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- and they started in and they sent it to me -- 

B.78:  Oh {drawn out}. 

A.79:  -- and so that's how I got started.  

B.80:  Okay.  

A.81:  So, I thought, well, I can do this, you know.  

B.82:  Yeah, well, it's not too hard, but I, I've called in a couple times, but
then, like I said, it was down so much that I got out of the habit and then
I'm not usually home, so I'm not usually here when --

A.83:  When they try and call.  

B.84:  -- when they try.  

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  Because I don't, I haven't done it very often.  

A.87:  Yeah, I just started, so I'm always like, now what do I do. 

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  I'm always like, what.  I,

B.90:  Well, didn't you have to fit out a form where it said that you would,

A.91:  [Barking].

B.92:  check off magazines and stuff -- 

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  -- on it.  

A.95:  But I didn't know it asked me if I subscribed to them.  I can talk about
magazines [laughter].

B.96:  Well, now, what magazines do you like to read?  

A.97:  Uh, um, [lipsmack] see, I really, I mean, I don't even r-, I don't even
grab them and look at them.

B.98:  Well, if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend
them on magazines, when magazines would you, would you g-, would you, would
you buy?

A.99:  Well, I think right now I'd buy BRIDE because I just got engaged.

B.100:  Oh, really?  

A.101:  So I'd buy that [laughter].  

B.102:  Those magazines are like phone books, aren't they?  

A.103:  I know, they're huge.  

B.104:  They're like two thousand pages of advert-, uh, uh, of ads or something.

A.105:  I know, I think I'd buy like HOME AND GARDENS, and stuff like that.

B.106:  Really?  

A.107:  Yeah -- 

B.108:  Well,   

A.109:  -- I like stuff like that.  

B.110:  Really?  

A.111:  I used to get like horse magazines and stuff.  I used to show horses so,

B.112:  Really?  

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  That's neat.  

A.115:  ((So, say)) a lot of horse magazines,

B.116:  [Clanking].

A.117:  but that was quite a while ago.  

B.118:  And so did you, did you, uh, uh, uh, uh, ride them and stuff.  What do they
call it ((dursege)) and,

A.119:  Yeah, I used to ride English, uh-huh.  

B.120:  Uh-huh.  

A.121:  Hunter jumper.  

B.122:  Well, that's good.  

A.123:  So I used to get lots of magazines for that.   

B.124:  Uh-huh.  

A.125:  But ever since I stopped at that and went to college, then I really haven't
got any more magazines for that.

B.126:  Uh-huh.  My,

A.127:  But those are probably the only two magazines I would get.  

B.128:  Well, you could buy an awful lot of BRIDE magazines for a hundred dollars,
I don't know,

A.129:  [Laughter] I know, that's right [laughter].  

B.130:  We have some newsstands here in Dallas, you know, that have like thousands
of magazines and --

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  -- I could buy a lot, I could buy a lot of magazines.  

A.133:  You get a lot of them.  

B.134:  Well,   

A.135:  That's great, though.  

B.136:  There's more that I could get.  

A.137:  That's great though,

B.138:  [Talking].

A.139:  because especially with business, though, because I know, like with
business stuff, because when they first asked me this, I was like, well, God,
they're like why do you like articles, or, or why do you not like magazines.
I was like because it has [laughter] so much advertising, but business ones
don't really.

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  #And they're really informative.# 

B.142:  #Well, they have a lot of,# they, I don't know, they have a lot of
different, different kinds of ads and stuff in them.

A.143:  Yeah, but they're very, they're very informative.  

B.144:  Yeah.  

A.145:  I think.  

B.146:  I guess.  

A.147:  That's great.  

@@B.148:  So what are you majoring in out there?  

A.149:  Uh, I major in psychology, in family studies.  

B.150:  Really?  

A.151:  Yeah.  

B.152:  That's good.  

A.153:  I like it a lot.  I love it up here.  I like it better than Dallas
[laughter].

B.154:  You, you like Lubbock better than Dallas?  

A.155:  Yeah.  

B.156:  Why?  

A.157:  Because people are so much nicer.  

B.158:  Really?  

A.159:  Yeah.  

B.160:  Well, people are nice here in Dallas.  

A.161:  Uh [laughter].  

B.162:  You don't think so, huh?  

A.163:  It's just a different atmosphere, I think.  

B.164:  Where did you go to high school?  

A.165:  I went to Birkner High School in Richardson.  

B.166:  Oh, my son goes to Richardson High School.
