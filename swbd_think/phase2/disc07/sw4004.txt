==========================================================================

A.1:  How do you feel about the Viet Nam war?

@B.2:  Huh, well, um, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh, I just,
uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, uh.

A.5:  Yeah, I saw that as well.

B.6:  Got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together
the feelings.  I really appreciated the, the whole, uh, English class where
the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know, the guy's gouging,
gouging your eyes out, what are you going to do?

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  You know, what for him to finish me off [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  And, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of Asian
philosophy --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  #Well, were# --

B.12:  -- #that, uh.#

A.13:  -- you ever in Viet Nam or,

B.14:  No, no, I was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number,
and you?

A.15:  Um, I was much too young, I was born in sixty-seven, so.

B.16:  Oh [laughter].

A.17:  Um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age, but
neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.

B.18:  Well, I, personally, uh, you know, uh, I just went in limbo.  I had a
passport and was ready to go --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- or um, out of the country or --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- join special forces, either one.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I mean, I just didn't know.  So, uh.

A.25:  Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over
there?

B.26:  Um, yeah, just a second. 

A.27:  Okay.

B.28:  [Talking] Okay.  Sure, now.  Well, Mark, um, what was that again?

A.29:  Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our invest-, the investment in
lives and money was worth it?

B.30:  No, not, not really.

A.31:  I totally agree with that.  #Um.#

B.32:  #Um.#

A.33:  What, what effects do you think it's had on our country?

B.34:  Downside.  Um, uh, well, the (( )) says we should, uh, go into the grief
that, that's there and, you know, (( )) presidents have always avoided that --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- as a country.  So it's pretty serious, really, you know, lot of things
that aren't being addressed.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  I think (( )) you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire,
entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed, it
was-, it wasn't, you know, it was never we, we announced that we were going to
war, it was such a gradual and subtle, you know --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- thi-, um, you know increasement of, of force that.  

B.40:  Gulf of Tonkin, uh, resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo.
[laughter] You remember that?

A.41:  I vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or
something.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah, only only it was foggy and finally President Johnson said,
well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.

A.43:  Oh [laughter].

B.44:  Isn't that something?

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Um, so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example
like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going
to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war.

B.48:  Hey Mark --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- I've got to go, um.

A.51:  Okay.

B.52:  We'll see you.  I guess our five minutes are up according to me.  Are they
to you?

A.53:  Uh, I wasn't really keeping count.  But I guess, good-bye.

B.54:  Yeah, okay, bye-bye.

A.55:  Bye.
