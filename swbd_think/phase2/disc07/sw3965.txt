B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Okay.  Do you, uh, do any woodworking?

B.3:  I do, and I really love it.  Um.

A.4:  Oh, um, what do you do, for a hobby or for,

B.5:  Uh-huh, I do it for a hobby --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- and I have my own equipment, and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and,
uh, in the process of getting a router --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that
I cut out.  What kind of things do you like to do with wood?

A.10:  Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out.  My husband cuts them out --

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  -- but, uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is, is a lot slower --

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  -- and then, uh, he's got a router, but now he wants a plunge router.

B.17:  Oh.

A.18:  [Laughter].

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  But anyhow, he cuts them out, and then I, I took a tole --

B.21:  Oh.

A.22:  -- painting class --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- to learn how to paint them right, #you know.#

B.25:  #Uh-huh.#

A.26:  And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to
these craft shows or --

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- flea market things and s-, and see if we can sell some of them.

B.29:  Yes.

A.30:  But, uh, I really like it so far.

B.31:  Oh, that is fun.

A.32:  And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- so I took a pattern off of that, and then it's just a wooden doll with a
painted face --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- and then you, you make the dress for it, and you drill holes around the
top of the head and you, you stick in --

B.37:  Oh.

A.38:  -- uh, like rope --

B.39:  Uh-huh, the twine.

A.40:  -- and tie ribbons around it.

B.41:  Yeah, those are #so cute.#

A.42:  #It looked really# cute, you know.  So I've got a couple of those started.

B.43:  They are really cute.

A.44:  Yeah, and then uh, but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing
right now.

B.45:  Oh, that is, that sounds really fun. (( )) well, they have a really fancy
boutique out here in Ogden, Utah --

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  -- and I just got back from that today, so if you could get your projects
into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  You could make a lot of money from those.

A.50:  What do you do?  I wonder how you, you just, they buy them from you, or you
just given them to them on consignment or something?

B.51:  Uh, apparently, like that boutique, um, they take, oh what was it, twenty
percent of the sell price.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  You would put your sell price --

A.54:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.55:  -- uh, and then they would take twenty percent off of that --

A.56:  Um, I see.

B.57:  -- at the counter.

A.58:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.59:  And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then
they give you what you earned [laughter].

A.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.61:  So, you have to decide what your price is going to be --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it.

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.

A.66:  Oh, these little things are so cute, though, you know.  

B.67:  They are.

A.68:  #I.#

B.69:  #I,# I have seen those.  Those are darling.

A.70:  I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, you know --

B.71:  Uh-huh.

A.72:  -- and, uh, there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out.  In
fact, I just sent to Shop Smith --

B.73:  [Gasp]  #Oh.#

A.74:  -- #back in Ohio# for a rocking horse pattern.

B.75:  Oh, that's what I want, is a Shop Smith [laughter].

A.76:  [Laughter]  #Yeah, we, well,# --

B.77:  #That's my ul-.#

A.78:  -- Gene's got one of those too [laughter].

B.79:  Oh, does he?  Oh, that's my ultimate dream [laughter].

A.80:  [Laughter]  Yeah, so anyhow.

B.81:  Oh, you're lucky.

A.82:  Yeah, well, uh, he's retired now --

B.83:  Uh-huh.

A.84:  -- and, uh, I'm kind of semi retired.  My company went bankruptcy, so I'm
drawing my pension from them, but I'm still looking for a part time --

B.85:  (( )).

A.86:  -- job, you know.

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  But, uh, he has all day long that --

B.89:  Oh.

A.90:  -- he can, you know, work on this stuff and do --

B.91:  How fun.

A.92:  -- do cut outs like that,

B.93:  [Throat_clearing].

A.94:  you know.  And he's got a lot, a lot of tools, so.

B.95:  Oh, how nice. [laughter]  #I'm jealous.#

A.96:  #It's just,# it's just getting started, you know.

B.97:  Yes.

A.98:  But, um, these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good.

B.99:  Uh-huh.

A.100:  Um, I know a lot of people that have gotten them, you know.  My next door
neighbor, every time she sees something, she thinks it's so cute she wants to
buy it, #you know [laughter].#

B.101:  #Uh-huh.  [laughter]#  Oh.

A.102:  So, I'm just hoping that, you know, that we can get some cut out and
painted, you know, before summer starts --

B.103:  Uh-huh.

A.104:  -- because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that --

B.105:  No.

A.106:  -- in the winter time, you know.

B.107:  Uh-huh.

A.108:  But, uh.

B.109:  Well, how is the market for things like that in California?  (( )).

A.110:  It seems, it seems like they go real good, #you know.#

B.111:  #Uh-huh.#

A.112:  I mean, the country, anyhow, out here --

B.113:  Uh-huh.

A.114:  -- and I live out in the valley --

B.115:  Uh-huh.

A.116:  -- and country seems to be the in thing out here --

B.117:  Oh.

A.118:  -- you know, everybody wants little country pieces.  So anything that looks
like it might be country #is what they want, you know.#

B.119:  #They just snap it right up,# huh.

A.120:  Yeah.

B.121:  Oh.

A.122:  And, uh, this little rabbit that I made in, uh, tole painting class, you
know, is like a welcome.  It's got a, it's going to have little wooden hearts
holding it, in its hands --

B.123:  Uh-huh.

A.124:  -- and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts.

B.125:  Oh.

A.126:  And,
