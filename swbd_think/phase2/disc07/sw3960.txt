========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Jean, what, what have you recently painted?

@B.2:  Well, I'm not, uh, painting of the artist variety.  What I like to do is,
I like to paint the inside of a house.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Paint cabinets or paint furniture, but I'm not doing much of that right
now.  Haven't for quite some time.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  How about you?

A.7:  Well, I painted a shed this summer that I built, and I went and borrowed a,
uh, a paint sprayer from a, a fellow that I know, I'm good friends with, and
it's the only way to go [laughter].

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  I painted eight gallons of paint, um, I, I put some stain and stuff on a,
on a redwood deck I made, and I painted the, uh, my shed, and it probably took
me about six hours, but it was just, it's just incredible how much easier it
is, uh, with a spray gun, how much smoother it goes on and even and more
professional looking and, um, I don't know, I was just really pleased with it.
Do you use some kind of a power painter, rollers or something when you paint
or,

B.10:  Just, uh, old fashioned brush and roller, yes.

A.11:  Is that right?

B.12:  Yeah, when.

A.13:  You, you, you do it the hard way.  

B.14:  Yes -- 

A.15:  I shouldn't (( )),

B.16:  -- uh, a very messy way, too.  Uh, we haven't done much painting interior
or exterior in the last, uh, two years, two and a half years.  We, we bought a
mobile home, and with the natural oak, or natural wood paneling on the inside
we don't have that painting to, to contend with, but, uh, my husband has
painted, uh, some of our storage buildings and when he put the, uh, skirting
around the, the mobile home, then it had to be, uh, sealed, painted.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Um, how do you, uh, oh, I would imagine that the weather's pretty
hard on paints down there, is it, is it not?

B.18:  Yes, it is.  Probably the, the summers are harder actually than the winters
are --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- because it, uh, the sun, you know, bakes and dries them out, and we
don't have an, a lot of freezing weather like you would in Idaho.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  How frequently do you have to paint then?

B.22:  Usually not more often than about every, oh, three to five years, depending
on the type finish that you use, and too, the, the type of wood that you're
putting it on.

A.23:  How, how do you, uh, prep your wood?  Is there a fast easy way, or is it
just, the old scraper brush on the outside is I guess what I'm speaking of.

B.24:  Oh, that is the, um, the only thing that, that I know of.  We, um, were
fortunate in that the last, uh, painting work that my husband did was on new
finish, so it didn't have to be --

A.25:  Uh-huh, #yeah.#

B.26:  -- #prepped, anyway.# We had painted, uh, I had paint, I had a house
painted that we owned over in, uh, Greenville, and we had it brushed and
scraped and, uh, a primer coat brushed on, and then the, in fact, I think
there was two coats of primer, and then three coats of the, uh, paint that
went on that.  It was an old frame house.  But it lasted very, very well.  It
must have been on there nearly ten years before it needed painting again.

A.27:  Um.  Inside.  How do you keep the paint off your carpet?  Or do you have
that problem?  [laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  Any time I try something like that I got paint all over the carpet, and
we're in there with, uh, I have to use water base paint and, and, uh, in there
with a big wet towel and about every three minutes I got to stop and clean my
paint specks up all over.

B.30:  Yeah, that sounds familiar too.  My husband hates to see me --

A.31:  Huh.

B.32:  -- get the painting bug, because he says I'm, I make a, a terrible mess,
and I guess I do.  But, um, in the times that he has helped me taping the, uh,
one of those plastic drop cloths --

A.33:  Yes.

B.34:  -- to the baseboard and then setting chairs or something against it to keep
the, keep it from getting kicked loose, is about the best way to keep it, you
know, from speckling all around.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  Uh.

@@B.36:  How did you get involved in the, uh, this project that we're doing on
the,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  voice recording.

A.39:  Uh, Brian (( )) from down there, as I mentioned before, sent, his, his wife
and my, my wife, (( )), are sisters, and they got involved in it, they got us
involved in it.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  But, kind of enjoyed it.  Um, don't always have time to, to pick the phone
up and participate
