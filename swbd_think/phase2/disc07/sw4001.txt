==========================================================================

A.1:  I'm Brigette.  

B.2:  Michael here.  

A.3:  Nice to meet you.  

B.4:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you?  

A.5:  I'm in Lubbock, Texas.  

B.6:  Lubbock, I'm in Biloxi, Mississippi.  

A.7:  Oh, really?  

B.8:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.9:  Oh, my gosh.  

B.10:  Not too far away.   

A.11:  I know.  Well, are you ready for me to push one?  

B.12:  Yeah, I guess so.

A.13:  Okay [beep].  Okay, so what kind of cars do you like?  

@B.14:  Well, uh, I, I like, I don't like real big cars.  I like fairly sporty,
smaller cars.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  And, uh, I have a Toyota Celica right now.  

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  And, uh, i-, uh, the, the question they asked us was what would we buy next
and,

A.19:  [Noise].

B.20:  that's sort of what I have in mind for the next car that I buy is another
Celica.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  Uh,   

A.23:  What year is it?  

B.24:  It's an eighty-seven.  

A.25:  Okay, is it, because that's what I have, too.  

B.26:  Oh, you have a Celica?  

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  Oh, really?  

A.29:  I love it [laughter].  

B.30:  What, what year is yours?  

A.31:  I have a eighty-nine.  

B.32:  Eighty-nine.  

A.33:  Yeah -- 

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  -- it's a Celica convertible.  

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  And I love it [laughter].  

B.38:  Oh, I do, too.  

A.39:  Toyota makes great cars.  

B.40:  I do, too, yeah, I think so, too.  That's is the second Toyota that I've
had.

A.41:  Really?  

B.42:  Yeah and, uh, [breathing] I've had it since it's new, and, uh,

A.43:  [Clicking].

B.44:  that's what, I, I plan on getting another one, you know -- 

A.45:  Do you?  

B.46:  -- whenever the time comes.  

A.47:  Yeah, my fiance and I, we've talked about it even and he has a, uh, a B M W
--

B.48:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- and they are s-, [clicking] expensive to just keep up and stuff --

B.50:  Oh, yeah, yeah I know.   

A.51:  -- that we were both, like, you know, if we're going to get a new car, it
would probably, I would say it would be a Toyota, too.

B.52:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.53:  For sure.  

B.54:  What I would really like would be a, uh, Supra, but just ca-, --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- just can't afford that.  

A.57:  Yeah, I know.

B.58:  That's just a l-, out, out of my range [laughter].  

A.59:  Those are nice.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  I think the next car that we'll look into will be more of a [clicking], I
don't know, I think, is it Toyota Forerunner.

B.62:  Uh, I've heard of it.  I'm not sure what it's -- 

A.63:  Is that what they're -- 

B.64:  -- what it is.  

A.65:  -- called.  Something like, like a, or like a, uh, [lipsmack] what are
they called, the one that [clicking], the one that Ford makes.

B.66:  Uh,   

A.67:  The new ones, do you know what I'm talking about?  

B.68:  So a, so a sporty car?   

A.69:  No, they're kind of more like a truck, like a Bronco --  

B.70:  Oh, okay.  

A.71:  -- type of [clicking],

B.72:  Uh, other than the Bronco, I'm not sure.  

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  I don't know what it is.  Uh, they have a new one other than the Bronco
you're talking about, huh.

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  No, I don't know what it is.  I haven't even really looked at the vehicles
much lately [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah, I haven't either.  But I, I would think it would most likely be
Toyota.

B.78:  Oh, yeah, I think I probably will, too because I've had good luck with it.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  Never had hardly any problems, you know -- 

A.81:  Yeah, me neither.  

B.82:  -- and the one I had before was the same way.  

A.83:  Really?  

B.84:  Yeah, we had a s-, a, uh, Tercel -- 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- before this.  

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  An eighty-two Tercel and that thing never gave us any problems.

A.89:  Really?  

B.90:  We had a wreck with it and, uh,

A.91:  [Clicking]. 

B.92:  the only problems we had was because of the wreck, you know, front end
alignment problems and stuff like that.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  But, uh, uh, [clink] I will, I will say this, uh, the, the Celica that I
own now, I have replaced the clutch in it.

A.95:  Really?  

B.96:  Yeah, and that was last year.  

A.97:  But that's understandable.  

B.98:  I think so.  I think --  

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  -- you just wear them out because we live, you know, our area's fairly
congested and a lot of traffic so it's, you know, we use the clutch a lot
[laughter].

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  I do.  You're stopping and going a lot, you know.  

A.103:  Uh-huh, I would definitely have to say Toyota, though.  

B.104:  Oh, yeah.  

A.105:  It's the best car I've had.  

B.106:  Yeah, and, uh -- 

A.107:  It's the best built.  

B.108:  -- I don't, I'm, I'm, you know, I don't worry about getting a Japanese car.
You know, everybody's talking about buying American and --

A.109:  Yeah.  

B.110:  -- everything and,

A.111:  I know.  

B.112:  Uh, I just like Japanese cars.  

A.113:  I know.

B.114:  I think,

A.115:  Uh, I feel like,

B.116:  I think they're just better made [laughter].  

A.117:  I know, I, do, too.  I feel like if, if, like, Ford or someone could make
one that competed with,

B.118:  That's right.  

A.119:  You know.  

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  I would buy it, I would.  

B.122:  Yeah, if they could make one as cheap, you know -- 

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  -- too.  

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  I, I, g-, I think the American cars, they have the Japanese beat when it
comes to big cars, of course --

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  -- but, uh, when it comes to little, uh, sporty cars or th-, that kind of a
car, I, I don't think there, there's any competition, really.  I think the
Japanese have them beat [laughter].

A.129:  Yeah, I think there's so much more economicable, too.  

B.130:  Oh, yeah, sure, I do, too.  

A.131:  Just like with gas and everything.  

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  I mean, I can go forever on a tank of gas.  

B.134:  Well, I can, too.  I'm, uh,

A.135:  [Laughter] Like,   

B.136:  I fill up maybe, well, I fill up about once every week and a half I'd g-,
I'd say.

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  You know, and, uh, I do a lot of driving right now.  I'm in school and
everything, so --

A.139:  Uh-huh.  

B.140:  -- uh, been doing a lot of extra driving, but it's, you know, it's not bad,
not at all.

A.141:  #Go a# --

B.142:  #Well,# 

A.143:  -- far way on that tank of gas #[laughter].#  

B.144:  #That's right.#  

A.145:  I know [laughter].  

B.146:  Well, uh, is yours, the Celica that you have, is it a, uh, an S T or a G T
or what?

A.147:  It's a G T.  

B.148:  G T, mine is an S T.  

A.149:  What is that?  

B.150:  Uh, it's little lower model than the G T.  

A.151:  Is it?  

B.152:  Yeah, they had the S T, the G T, and the G T S -- 

A.153:  Uh-huh.  

B.154:  -- you know, and the, the S T is the, uh, cheaper [clink] version of all
three of them.

A.155:  Really?  

B.156:  Yeah.  

A.157:  My mom has a, a G T S.  

B.158:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.159:  She has a eighty-nine G T S Celica.  

B.160:  Yeah, that's got a little s-, little power, more powerful engine --

A.161:  Yeah.  

B.162:  -- and a lot more, uh, little more options on it so,

A.163:  Yeah, sh-, I know.  She has this big powerful engine on [laughter], she
doesn't drive, I mean --

B.164:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.165:  -- she doesn't drive over forty.  

B.166:  Oh, yeah, well, that's the way mothers are [laughter].  

A.167:  I know, and the funny thing is, because she bought it and I don't think the
guy really, I don't think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff
on,
