A.1:  Okay, now it's Sandy, right?

B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  Sandy, um, what kind of music do you like to listen to?

@B.4:  I like Country --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and it's really hard to find people that enjoy country music --

A.7:  #In San Diego.#

B.8:  -- #in my age.# --

A.9:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.10:  -- because I'm twenty-two --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and most people my age like hard rock, and, not me [laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  I think it was the stupidest thing ever invented.

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  I still like country music, and --

A.17:  Do you, oh.

B.18:  -- so it's kind of hard for me to find people I agree with on music.

A.19:  Oh.  Um, now have you lived in California all your life?

B.20:  Oh, no.  

A.21:  No?

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  You just moved there?

B.24:  I, I have to be here right now because my husband's in the Navy --

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  -- but I'm going home first opportunity I get [laughter].

A.27:  Now where's home?

B.28:  Arizona.

A.29:  Oh, okay.  So, country music is prevalent in Arizona?

B.30:  Oh, yeah.

A.31:  Is it?  Oh.

B.32:  I was born in a little tiny town that that's all they have [laughter].

A.33:  Oh [laughter].

B.34:  It has a population of about three hundred people, and all they know is
country music.

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  I mean, they still have barn dances and stuff.

A.37:  Oh, how fun.  Oh.

B.38:  Yeah, it is pretty fun.

A.39:  Oh, gosh, I don't blame you.  Uh, my husband's in the Navy Reserves, and so
he's going out to San Diego --

B.40:  Oh, really?

A.41:  -- in about three weeks for his two week,

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  yearly stint.  So, [breathing] I'll be missing him then.  But, oh.

B.44:  Yeah, my husband's leaving March twelfth.  He has to go out to sea again.

A.45:  Oh, and how long does he stay out?

B.46:  Well, usually they stay out six to nine months --

A.47:  Oh.

B.48:  -- but this time they're only going out for, I think it's two weeks this
time --

A.49:  #Oh, thank goodness.#

B.50:  -- #because they're just,# they're just doing their sea trials --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- making sure they're ready to go out to sea again.

A.53:  Oh, I think that's terrible, oh.

B.54:  Yeah, it gets kind of monotonous.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  But I incorporated him into country music --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- and he didn't, he didn't like it when we got married --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- but since he married me and,

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  I was a country girl, that's all I --

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  -- have going on at home, so now he's gotten where he really likes country
music, and for my birthday, he went out, and he got me a brand new pair of
Tony Llama boots --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and he bought himself a pair, too --

A.67:  Oh, boy [laughter].

B.68:  -- and took me out country dancing.

A.69:  [Laughter]  So he is real country now.

B.70:  Yeah, and all his friends tease him on the ship.

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  Are you sure cowboys know how to swim?

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  He, he gets upset about it, but it's funny.

A.75:  [Laughter] Oh, that is, that is.  Well, out here in Utah we have a lot of
country, and we live kind of in the country, it's by Ogden, Utah.  I don't
know if you know, Salt Lake City.

B.76:  My, my dad lives in Salt Lake. 

A.77:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's, it's about an hour north of Salt Lake, so --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- we're out here in the country and we hear a lot of the country music.
In fact, I work in a bakery, and the baker comes to work at four o'clock in
the morning, and I come to work at six o'clock in the morning, and he just has
the country music just blasting,

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  and he just rocks and rolls in the bakery [laughter] to country music
[laughter].

B.82:  Yeah, I know how that goes.  I think country music's the only thing keeping
me sane with these kids.

A.83:  Oh.  [laughter] I, I bet that's really hard being their mom with all those
--

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- with the two little ones.

B.86:  Yeah, it is, but, [breathing] I don't know, it's worth it.

A.87:  It's a way of life for a while, huh.

B.88:  It's worth it to me.

A.89:  Yeah, that's good.  Well, um, [breathing] my favorite kind of music is New
Age, and it's, that sounds like it's hard rock and roll, but it's not.  It's
the, oh, the synthesizer, synthe-, synthesizers and all of that.

B.90:  Yeah, and it kind of has a bluesey mix to it?

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  And it's just beautiful.  I love it.  I, I find it so relaxing, and I do,
I'm get, beginning to like country music more and more since my boss has it on
#all the time.#

B.94:  #[Laughter].#

A.95:  But, um, but my very favorite is that New Age.  I like, my favorite
recording artist is Yani, and he's not, he doesn't make you yawn [laughter].

B.96:  Do you know who Mariah Carey is?

A.97:  Um, I hea-, yeah, I've heard of her, in fact I was watching the Grammy's
and I, I saw her on the Grammy's.

B.98:  I don't particularly like her kind of music, but --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- she's got a couple songs that I, I, I can listen to --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- you know, without going totally bonkers.

A.103:  Yeah, she's not too wild.

B.104:  Yeah, but I don't know, I guess I am kind of the only country one that got
left --

A.105:  Oh [laughter].

B.106:  -- because most of the people here, most of the bars and everything are
either hard rock or disco or, um --

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  -- just a blues bar.  #We've got# --

A.109:  #Yeah.#

B.110:  -- several blues bars in the neighborhood --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- and it's like, guys, #what happened to juke# --

A.113:  #[Laughter].#

B.114:  -- boxes and sawdust on the floor, you know.  

A.115:  Yeah [laughter].

B.116:  And I ask that of a, I went into a bar with my husband on our anniversary
--

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- and I asked the guy, I said, have you ever heard of a juke box, and he
goes,

A.119:  [Laughter].

B.120:  yeah.  

A.121:  [Laughter].

B.122:  I said, why don't you install one?

A.123:  [Laughter].

B.124:  He goes, what music do you want on it?  And I said country, and he goes --

A.125:  Oh.

B.126:  -- no way --
