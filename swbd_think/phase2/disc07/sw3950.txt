=======================================================================

B.1:   So, what do you think?  

A.2:   [Laughter] I figured,

B.3:   [Laughter]. 

@A.4:   you were going to ask me first.  Here I was going to ask
you first.  This is a difficult one, I mean, unfortunately the
first thoughts are sort of negative.  

B.5:   Uh-huh.  

A.6:   But then when I give myself a chance to think about it a
little bit more, I recognize the positives as well.  Uh,

B.7:   Yes.  

A.8:   Positives for sure, technology and -- 

B.9:   Uh-huh.  

A.10:   -- uh, some of the changes that the computer age has brought. 
I think that kids growing up today are just, uh, very much more
facile than I was as a [laughter] kid -- 

B.11:   Yeah.  

A.12:   -- in terms of the use of computer technology.  

B.13:   Right, that's true.  I mean, I'm twenty-six now -- 

A.14:   Uh-huh.  

B.15:   -- and I came through high school with about the first
generation that had computers in the classroom -- 

A.16:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.17:   -- and all that, and it certainly has been good for me.  

A.18:   Yes.  

B.19:   Because I see myself, ((you know)), when I learn a new system,
a new program, or a new computer language, that it is much easier
for me than for, let's say, my colleagues who are a lot older, 
but -- 

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   -- just as -- 

A.22:   And the earlier -- 

B.23:   -- intelligent -- 

A.24:   -- you learn,

B.25:   -- and whatever [laughter].  

A.26:   Yes, the younger you are, probably the easier it is.  

B.27:   Uh-huh.  

A.28:   Um, some of that, I think probably, we take for granted, you
know, the changes have happened so rapidly that it's, it's easy for
us to forget how quickly it has changed.  

B.29:   That's true.  

A.30:   I think probably the other thing I, that came to mind is, is
the increased,

B.31:   [Noise].

A.32:  awareness on our part of the, the criminal element [laughter], if I can put
it that way, you know, you don't, you don't, uh, casually let kids play in the
street or, you know, ride their bike to friends if you're in an --

B.33:   Uh-huh.  

A.34:   -- area where you're at all concerned about -- 

B.35:   And, what -- 

A.36:   -- abduction and,

B.37:   -- do you think, that's just a question of becoming more aware
or has it become less safe over the years.  

A.38:   I think it's changed.  I think that in the last twenty or
thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of
crime.  

B.39:   Yeah, I would agree with you.  

A.40:   And I'm not sure why, you know, uh, certainly a question that
we could spend hours on [laughter].   

B.41:   Um, that's right.  

A.42:   You know, whether, whether there is a change in, in the way a
lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is, you know, more
mental illness or something that causes that sort of thing to go
on.  Uh -- 

B.43:   Uh-huh.  

A.44:   -- I don't know.  

B.45:   Yeah, I don't know, I think a lot of what causes it is just
economics, naturally.  

A.46:   But, you know, kidnapping is a strange thing.  You know, w-,
kids today are not nearly as free as I was when I was a kid in
terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my
bike around the neighborhood or -- 

B.47:   Uh-huh.  

A.48:   -- being, being informed at a very young age about, uh, going
to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you. 
I mean, I never had a concept of that as a kid.  

B.49:   Uh-huh.  

A.50:   So that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty
years.  

B.51:   Yeah, I suppose it has.  Uh,

A.52:   Anyway, what are some positives that you could d-, [laughter]
you've thought about besides [inhaling],

B.53:   [Laughter].

A.54:   spending too much time on the criminal element.  

B.55:   Right [laughter].  

A.56:   [Laughter].

B.57:   Uh, well, let's see, I think that the mass communication that
we have in the world now is, in general, a good thing.  And I think
it has its good points and bad points, but -- 

A.58:   Uh-huh.  

B.59:   -- in general it's pretty positive.  

A.60:   Really does bring us together as a global community, doesn't
it.  

B.61:   Uh, more or less, yes.  

A.62:   Uh-huh.

B.63:   I mean, it is, we have the global village, you know, like,

A.64:   [Laughter]. 

B.65:   ((Mick Lewen)) was saying, but it doesn't, I don't think
that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a
world.  

A.66:   Uh, that's -- 

B.67:   Which -- 

A.68:   -- a good point.  

B.69:   -- which, hopefully may be coming, we'll have to see.  

A.70:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I think that's something that, uh, is a
political influence as well, you know, probably people feel it on
a personal level more than they might, uh, on a, on a global level. 
You know, just -- 

B.71:   Uh-huh.  

A.72:   -- being informed about what other countries and other
cultures are doing -- 

B.73:   Right.  

A.74:   -- in a way that we might not have been informed before, but
yet, politically, uh, their activities are not, are not influencing
how our leaders direct legislation as, as much as they could.  It's
still really focused on our interests, you know, what I mean.  

B.75:   Well, yeah, that definitely,

A.76:   [Laughter]. 

B.77:   right, I mean, when we're r-, well, with things like the
war in Iraq -- 

A.78:   Uh-huh.  

B.79:   -- we were [noise] dealing with other people's affairs for our
own interests -- 

A.80:   Uh-huh.  

B.81:   -- #certainly# --

A.82:   #Uh-huh.#

B.83:   -- is what I believe.  

A.84:   Yeah.  

B.85:   Uh,

A.86:   McDonald's, uh, burning up the, uh, the rain forests in order
to have more cattle grazing so that -- 

B.87:   Uh-huh.  

A.88:   -- [Laughter] somehow that's something that's not going to
work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle.  It's going to
catch up to us at some point.  

B.89:   Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

A.90:   What else has changed, social changes, uh,

B.91:   Um.  

A.92:   I think that there's probably a greater awareness, sensitivity
on the part of men and women to, to what the other, uh, is
adjusting to in life.
