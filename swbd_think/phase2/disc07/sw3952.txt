============================================================

A.1:  I'm ready.

B.2:  All right.

A.3:  Do you exercise, uh, during the day time --

B.4:  Oh.

A.5:  -- or go to a gym or anything?

@B.6:  Yeah, I, I used to go to a gym, um, last summer, but then I started school
again, so, it's, um, so I don't exercise as much as I'd like.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  But, I, I do enjoy, um, going to a gym and working out, or just like, I do
sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up, and I ride a exercise
bike a lot.  So.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  Um, it's really weird, because I'll get down on the floor, and I'll holler
and tell my cat Nikki, I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises,

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  now.  And she can be upstairs in the bedroom, and I don't know.  She knows
what I'm talking about.  You know, pretty soon, here she comes.

B.14:  (( )).

A.15:  So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Uh, I had a problem with my back, so, when I went to physical therapy --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- they gave me some exercises for my back.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then,
then my back gives me a problem again.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  So I try to do it every night, #and uh.#

B.24:  #Oh, that's# good.

A.25:  Yeah, it seems like it's, you know, I can tell when I do it and when I
don't do it --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- you know, so you know it's got to be good for you.

B.28:  Right [laughter].

A.29:  But, um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- but, uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they
do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  So, I was kind of thinking about joining it, but I haven't even gone down
there and talked to them yet.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  But, uh, it does really make you feel good, and I like to bicycle, too.

B.36:  Oh, yeah.

A.37:  So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.

B.38:  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  

A.39:  So.

B.40:  I enjoy that a lot.  I, um, bike in the summer.  I belong to a biking club
here in Kenosha.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, um, we go on a, like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.

A.43:  Oh, my goodness.

B.44:  So [laughter], I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so,
I, you know, can be in shape (( )).

A.45:  Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, huh?

B.46:  No, huh-uh.

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  No, I go with my dad.  He exercises a lot more than I do, though.

A.49:  Oh, really?

B.50:  Oh, yeah, #he's# --

A.51:  #Uh-huh.#

B.52:  -- always exercising.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  But, I'm not that energetic [laughter]. 

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  I get lazy sometimes.

A.57:  Yeah, well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know, and, um.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.

B.60:  Oh, yeah, that's what I like to do.

A.61:  You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape, and
once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape --

B.62:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

A.63:  -- #you know.# So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- you know, like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television
anyhow --

B.66:  Oh. 

A.67:  -- you know [laughter].

B.68:  Wow [laughter].

A.69:  So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes
down and joins me.

B.70:  Oh, yeah, that is neat [laughter].

A.71:  You know, so.  Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my
exercising.  I wish I knew how to swim, but I don't, so I don't go swimming.

B.72:  Yeah, um, I don't swim much, neither.

A.73:  Uh-huh, but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- you know, for every part of your body.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that.  If they had a pool here
in Patterson I'd probably, you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there,
but they don't have a pool in this small city, either.

B.78:  Oh.  #Um.#

@@A.79:  #So.#  Well, listen then, it's been nice talking to you. 

B.80:  Yeah, nice talking to you.  

A.81:  Okay then.

B.82:  Okay.

A.83:  Bye-bye.

B.84:  Um, bye.
