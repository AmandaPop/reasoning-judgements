A.1:  So.  Do you do a lot of camping?

B.2:  Uh, well, yeah, fair amount.  Mostly with boy scouts.

A.3:  Oh, is that right, uh-huh.  Um, my sons are in the boy scouts also, so I
know they go a lot of camping, but I don't go with them.  [laughter] But, uh,
we used to live in California, and we did a little bit of camping in
California.  Not all that much, but, um, enough to get a little flavor for it.
Uh, where mostly do you go with your camping?

B.4:  Well, mostly, uh, well, boy scout camps near, uh, near Dallas.  Uh, in
fact, I, I think I know your sons, Danny and Sean, right?

A.5:  Oh, who am I talking to?

B.6:  Jan Novak.

A.7:  Oh, I can't believe that [laughter].

B.8:  But we can talk about camping nonetheless.

A.9:  Oh, we can talk about anything.

B.10:  They didn't.

A.11:  Well, you know, this is really funny, because I've tried to make these
phone calls, um, whenever it pops in my head, and sometimes they say, oh, we
can't find another party, and after they say that two times, I can't keep
hanging on the phone, and I just saw that card down there, and now I'm really
supposed to be baking bread for Cistercian [laughter], I said, Oh, I'll make
another phone call, I guess another five dollars helps.  So anyway.

B.12:  But we, we should talk about camping because they're recording this.

A.13:  Oh, we have to talk about, oh that's right, we're on this recording, but,
well, anyway.  Um, we used to go camping out in California up by Mendocino
and, um, to, um, Lasson Park, which is a vol-, a volcanic park.

@B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  And, uh, that was, absolutely extraordinary, and the rangers there that,
uh, do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were
quite extraordinary.  So that was one of our, uh, major camping funs that we
enjoyed very, very much.  Uh, do you ever go camping outside of the boy
scouts?

B.16:  Well, we used to do a lot of camping, uh, in fact, before we had kids,
Marie and I would go, we did a lot of canoe camping, uh, either in upstate New
York, where there are a lot of lakes, up near Lake Placid and --

A.17:  Oh, yes.

B.18:  -- in that area, and in Northern Ontario, which is also full of lakes.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about
seventy miles.

A.21:  Oh, my.

B.22:  You canoe, uh, from lake to lake, sometimes by rivers where they connect,
or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- to the next lake --

A.25:  Uh-huh, um.

B.26:  -- and so that, that was a, I, I think it's a lot, in a way, easier to go
canoe camping, because you don't have to watch the weight so much --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and it's also cleaner, because you can go swimming every day, and #it's
very easy to keep# --

A.29:  #Oh, that's true, too.#

B.30:  -- keep cool and keep clean.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And that's.

A.33:  We took one canoe trip in California, now the boys were very, very small
when we were out there, and, um, it was a friend of (( )) that got this group
together, and, uh, there had been some rains, and therefore the river was a
little more swift than what might normally be expected, and, um, I, I, I found
it exciting, but I really thought that it was a trifle dangerous, maybe
because the currents were kind of bad, and we just went ahead anyway.

B.34:  What, what river was that?

A.35:  It was the Russian River.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  I've, I've seen the Russian River.  We never went canoeing on it.

A.39:  Yeah, yeah.

B.40:  That, that can get pretty fast.

A.41:  Yeah, it can and it did, and, um, it was my first time, everybody's first
time doing this also, and we just trusted in the, uh, knowledge of this friend
that got this party together --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- that it would not be over dangerous, and we had our life belts on and
everything else like that.  But we did dump over once, and --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- uh, you know, with small children like that, it just made me very
nervous.  We didn't go again the next day.  We just kind of, uh, stayed by
camp site and, uh, cooked [laughter].

B.46:  Sure, sure.

A.47:  But, it, it was, it was very exciting and really very nice, and, um, I
wouldn't mind doing something like that again, and I guess the first time you
do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte.  You don't know
exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do.  But, um, it, it was
quite an experience.

B.48:  Yeah, well, you have to be, have to be careful --

A.49:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.50:  -- have to be careful.

A.51:  Yeah, yeah.  So.

B.52: You, your guys are going to Philmont are they?

A.53:  Oh, yes, well, Sean is.  Daniel went last summer.

B.54:  Right.  So Danny's --

A.55:  So.

B.56:  -- not going again.

A.57:  No, no, no, he's not going to go again this time.  But, uh, you're going to
inherit Sean on this trip, #and uh.#

B.58:  #Okay, well.#  I'll, I'm going with them.

A.59:  I know.  Uh-huh.  Have you been out there before?

B.60:  No.

A.61:  Oh, you have-, well, Daniel says it's, I think it's really quite
challenging.

B.62:  Really?

A.63:  Uh, absolutely.  Uh, I kind of got the information by drips and drabs from
last summer as different friends would talk to him, and apparently whoever has
to carry that water or part,
