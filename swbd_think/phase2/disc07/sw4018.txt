A.1:  Okay.  Um, what does your, does your community do anything about recycling?

@B.2:  We have been working hard to get a program of recycling going.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  The best we've been able to do is an area that has, uh, storage bins --

A.5:  Um.

B.6:  -- uh, for, um, bottles and, uh, plastic.

A.7:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].

B.8:  But people need to drive it there.  We don't, we haven't moved to having,
uh, picked up with the garbage yet.

A.9:  Right.  Plano, um, oh, it's probably been, I guess they started in
September, um, started where they gave every household a bin that you could do
newspapers, aluminum, bottles with code one and two on them, and, uh, glass,
and, uh, it has been really, really successful.  Um, they said that they
figured like twenty-five to thirty percent participation, and it's been like
forty-five percent, and, um, they also do, um, they pick up on another day of
the week for, um, lawn debris that could go in like a big compost.

B.10:  Here, uh, they don't take, uh, lawn debris to the landfill any more.  We
need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets
recycled, uh --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- but, I think they're, they're not making it easy for the, uh, general
public to do it here.  I mean, they, they, you have to haul everything
yourself, which can be a mess when it comes --

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  -- to, uh, yard waste --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- in particular.

A.17:  How big is your community?

B.18:  Well, we've got enough people, we've got a community of about eighty-five
thousand --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- but they're just very reluctant to, to get moving the way in which I
would like to see them moving.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  I, yeah, that's, I, I would like to see the manufacturers really,
uh, you know, the only thing that they recycle right now is plastics one and
two, and I would like to see them recycle either more plastics, um, you know,
up to code seven or eight, whatever it is, or see the manufacturers using more
of the, um, uh, code one and two.  I mean, I don't even know of a place to
drop off the other, the other ones --

B.22:  Um.

A.23:  -- but, um.

B.24:  Di-, did you tell me you're recycling newspapers?

A.25:  We're recycling newspapers, aluminum, um, I mean like aluminum cans, like
soup cans and all that, not just, you know, soda pop cans, um, glass and, uh,
the plastics.

B.26:  Boy, you're, you're far ahead.  Here most people are recycling aluminum
soda pop and beer cans, uh, for the money that they get out of them --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- and that seems to be the only incentive on that side.

A.29:  [Laughter] It sure does take a lot of, lot of cans to do that, that, to
make anything, though, at least down here.  I, I took like two garbage sacks
full, I mean just like paper sacks, and got like a quarter, and I thought,
this just really isn't worth my time.

B.30:  Yeah, it really is,

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  But there are a few people who, who --

A.33:  Go through the dregs.

B.34:  -- they will manage it. 

A.35:  Yes.

B.36:  What we've done at the church is to have, uh, people bring the stuff to our
church --

A.37:  [Throat_clearing]  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and then there're couple of people who, who crunch them down and then,
uh, take them to recycling center, and then the money is used for, uh, the
outreach program --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- to provide food.

A.41:  That's great.

B.42:  And so that has been an incentive, uh, within, uh, our, our particular
church --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- but newspapers the city doesn't want, and none of the, uh, recycling
places want them, because #they say# --

A.45:  #Oh, really.#

B.46:  -- that they're, it costs them more to recycle than, than they get out of
them, so --

A.47:  Really?

B.48:  -- we're stuck with newspapers.

A.49:  We, I know, uh, even before this took place, um, in September, the, like
our boy scouts were doing, you know, paper drives, and even when I was
younger, um, I remember having paper drives at school, and, um, so, I know it,
it seems like for, you know, a long time, the, the Dallas area has been doing
some kind of paper recycling.  I don't know what they did with the papers, you
know, twenty, thirty years ago.  I'm not sure.  But I know now, I mean, we
have a lot of, um, stores, WalMart is down, real big down here, and their,
their paper sacks that they do are all, you know, out of recycled paper, and
we have a lot of, lot of compa-,
