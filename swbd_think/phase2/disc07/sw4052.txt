=========================================================================

A.1:  So, um, do you have children of your own?

B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  Uh, how old are they?

B.4:  They range in age from twenty-four down to five.

A.5:  Oh, so have you had to deal with this, uh, child care question, yourself?

@B.6:  Not really.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  My wife has provided the child care up to now.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Uh, that certainly is the most straightforward.

B.10:  [Laughter]  It's the easiest one.

A.11:  Yes.

B.12:  Do you have children?

A.13:  I do.  I have, uh, one son who will be three in May, and, uh, we're
expecting another in May.

B.14:  And have you been into child care?

A.15:  No, not yet, uh, my wife stays home also.  Uh, we're starting to look into
maybe a preschool a couple of hours a day for the older one next year --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- uh, just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my
wife a little more time with the, the baby.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  Uh, but otherwise I, I mean, even just looking for that has been kind of
difficult, finding one that you really like, and that doesn't have some, uh,
major disadvantages.

B.20:  Well, I think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you
want out of day care or out of preschool, you know, do you want a real
academic one --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- uh, you know, I think those are some sort of critical issues we see a
lot, I see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for
school, and I see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the
kids.

A.25:  Yes, that's true, that's true.  Uh, and I would tend to lean toward the fun
--

B.26:  Me too.

A.27:  -- at this age [laughter].

B.28:  [Laughter] The last thing they need at that age is academics.

A.29:  Yeah, he'll get it eventually anyhow.  Uh, how old are your kids when they
started some sort of school?

B.30:  Well, we generally, with most of our kids, there were, well, with our
oldest one, they didn't have kindergarten in Texas --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and so we sent her to a private kindergarten --

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  -- and that was really her first exposure. 

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  With the others we've either with some friends done a sort of Mother's Day
Out kind of thing where they took turns --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- a couple of times a week, or we've actually put them in a little
preschool --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- about age four --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- just for a year's kind of socialization and again, to give my wife a
little bit of relief.

A.43:  Yeah.  It sounds like we'll be doing something similar, and my wife was
thinking of, uh, starting up a little preschool --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- maybe just with a few other mothers, and it would be sort of a Mom, it
would up being a Mom's day off thing, because they would take turns.  Um.

B.46:  We did that until our very last one --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and then my wife kind of said, you know, I'm ready for a break
[laughter].

A.49:  Oh, so, that's quite a spread, twenty-four to five.

B.50:  Oh, we have eight children, so.

A.51:  Wow, that's great.  

B.52:  There's a lot of space in between, I mean, there's not an awful lot of
space in between them.

A.53:  Um, so did, now the twenty-four year old, was nineteen when the five year
old was born.  Has she been at home?

B.54:  Uh, she was in college actually --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- when the baby was born.

A.57:  What kind of, what's their relationship like?

B.58:  Very good.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  Uh.

A.61:  It would be very inter-, I mean, old enough, I mean, really, no sibling
rivalry there, I would expect  [laughter].

B.62:  No, and she kind of really wanted him --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- I mean, she wanted us to have him, so she was real excited --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- about it, and, uh, she has a child of her own now that's just a couple
of years younger than he is.

A.67:  Oh, yeah, I always had friends in school who had an uncle, uh, hold it, no
that child is, wait a minute, this should be very simple.

B.68:  My son is.

A.69:  That child is your son's nephew.

B.70:  Yeah, right.

A.71:  That's right, yeah.  I always had friends who had an uncle who was a year
younger or the same age, and I always thought that was neat.

B.72:  Well, we didn't quite make that but came close  [laughter].

A.73:  Yeah.  Uh, but they were pretty close, at least compared to me and my
uncle, [laughter] --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- whose about forty years older.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  Um, uh, do you plan to have more children?

B.78:  No [laughter].

A.79:  [Laughter] All said.

B.80:  Now we've, we're into the grandchild period now.  That's much better.

A.81:  Oh, yeah, I would think that would have a lot of rewards.  Does your, does
your daughter live nearby?

B.82:  They live about, uh, four hours from here --

A.83:  Oh.

B.84:  -- they're in San Antonio.

A.85:  Well that's accessible --

B.86:  Yes.

A.87:  -- for a weekend.  Um, does she have to worry about child care?

B.88:  Uh, no, right now she's staying home, taking care of her kids.  Her husband
is in school --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- still, and so she works a little night job to help him through school,
and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening.

A.91:  Oh, sounds great.

B.92:  So they've been able to work that out so far.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  She doesn't want to go back to work if she can avoid it.

A.95:  Yeah, yeah.  I wish I could stay home with the kid.

B.96:  Me, too.

A.97:  Um, but it is nice to, I mean, I, I find it, it really gives me peace of
mind to know that my wife is home with our son, you know, as far as knowing
what kind of care he's getting.

B.98:  I don't know what you hear in California, but you know there's a lot of,
