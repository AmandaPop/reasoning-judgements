A.1:  Okay, Janet, do you guys have a family budget?

@B.2:  We try to #[laughter].#

A.3:  #Uh-huh.#

B.4:  Like mothers I'm sit-, I'm right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti,
which is one way which I --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- keep within a budget.

A.7:  [Laughter] It's probably why we're participating, too, right.

B.8:  [Laughter] Although I'm trying to raise money for a boy scout cause.  Um,
actually how we do it is my husband and I both work, and we try very hard to
live on his salary, and my salary goes automatically into a savings account,
which we try not to use too much --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- although from that we both, uh, we typically pay our credit cards from
that account.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  So that's the, that's the, uh, our household expenses are pretty well
covered, because they're pretty much the same every month --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- but it's our credit card spending that's always the problem.

A.15:  Yep.  Is the cost of living, uh, high down there?  Is it tough to --

B.16:  I don't know what to compare it to.

A.17:  -- I know it's just as,

B.18:  I lived in --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- Indiana and Saint Louis, but I was a student then --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and you know, when you're a student things don't mean much.

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  Um, I think Dallas is, um, [music] {piano} relatively high priced homes,
but then there's not, I think energy and some of the other things aren't quite
so high.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And I, my, my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate.
There's not as bad as I had seen in big cities like New York or California
areas.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  How about you?

A.29:  [Music] {piano} Um, the cost of living here is cheap.  In, in fact, it's
really great.  We've got a, quite a nice home.  We've got a five bedroom home
with a basement in it, and it cost me through, let's see, four years ago it
cost me fifty-five thousand.

B.30:  (( )).

A.31:  So it's great, I mean, uh, uh.

B.32:  Where are you from originally?

A.33:  Right here in Idaho.

B.34:  From Idaho.

A.35:  Yes.  I've got a brother-in-law in Plano, Texas, and that's how we got
hooked up with this, uh,

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  T I deal, but it's.

B.38:  Well, I don't know anyone from Idaho.  I'm from Indiana --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- uh, and I have a great love for the Midwest, would go back in a minute
if I could [laughter].

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  I married a Texan, #they don't always tell you# --

A.43:  #Well, that's good.#

B.44:  -- that they have a homing instinct.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  But I, our home, uh, we have a five bedroom home, um, but it's more in the
range, um, it was around two hundred forty thousand --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- so, about four and a half times your home.  

A.49:  Yeah, right.

B.50:  I'm sure they're probably quite comparable --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- or maybe, I don't know.  Ours is nice, our home is nicely located, but I
--

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- don't think the house itself is --

A.55:  Yeah, well --

B.56:  -- particularly extraordinary.

A.57:  -- I, I wouldn't, mine's not nicely located.  I probably got a bargain, I
think, more.

B.58:  How about budget wise, how, how --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- do you do a family budget?  Are you married?

A.61:  Yes, I am, and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting.  She has a
computer program, in fact I'm an accountant, I'm a C P A,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  I'm calling you from work tonight, uh, but, uh, my wife runs every single
check she spends through a computer, and she can tell me on a monthly basis,
and she's more interested, not me, in fact I only look at it once a year when
I do our, do our taxes, but she can tell you every month exactly what she's
paid for groceries, and, uh, utility bills and for gasoline in the cars, and
everything.  She's, uh.

B.64:  Uh, my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- used the MANAGING YOUR MONEY software package with --

A.67:  Um.

B.68:  -- Andrew Tobias --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- are you familiar with that one?

A.71:  I'm not, I'm not, huh-uh.

B.72:  I'm sure there are a million software packages --

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  -- but, um, he tried very hard, and we were all computerized and we, our
regular monthly checks we printed, you know --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- um, and I did it for three years and hated every minute of it
[laughter] --

A.77:  Huh.

B.78:  -- and still found that about half of our checks, maybe a third, I still
hand wrote, because it would --

A.79:  Um.

B.80:  -- be like in the school parking --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- lot, or --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- you know, at my child's skating lesson or something like that --

A.85:  Right.

B.86:  -- so we had to com-, we had two checks, two sizes of checks, um, (( )), my
daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is [laughter],

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  um, so we, we tried, and it was pretty nice.  One of, one mistake I think
we made in that is that, um, for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in
a budget, we must have had eighty different categories, and so they --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- they became sort of nonsensical instead of --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- I always said if we had redone it, we should have just put big
categories, like utilities --

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  -- and, you know, luxuries, and [laughter] entertainment --

A.95:  Well --

B.96:  -- that sort of thing.

A.97:  -- we have about twenty-five categories is all probably, and we write all
of our checks out of the register, we don't try to do any through the
computer, and then my wife just sets down when she's got about an hour, and
just keys them all in, and it's really not, you know, that bad.  It, um, well,
I don't know, it might, it might have been tough for you, but she enjoys it,
and that's another thing too, she really enjoys it.  She, uh, uh --

B.98:  [Laughter]  Well, see --

A.99:  -- gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went, I guess.

B.100:  -- I suppose that's the key.  

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  Um, do you, does your wife work outside the home?

A.103:  She does, she's, she teaches at, um, a small two year college here.  She's,
uh, teaches, uh, business communications.

B.104:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.105:  And.

B.106:  Well, with a C P A and a business person, you should be organized.

A.107:  Uh, yeah, uh, no, we still have problems with money like everybody else.

B.108:  Yeah.
