==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well (( )) I'm with the Department of Defense, and, uh, they have
random drug testing --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and, uh, the last couple of years, and people have really, you know,
just accepted that, of course the soldiers and then, uh, the civilians, they
haven't done the civilians, but, personally I don't think, see anything wrong
with it.  Uh, I think it's a protection to employers and to employees and
everybody else.

B.4:  Yeah, the, in my mind the people that say that it's in violation of their
privacy, it's, it's actually a violation of the people they work with.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  If, uh, it's not fair to have people working around you that, uh, could
cause accidents or harm to yourself.

A.7:  You bet.  I really like it the way they do it in the military, they go by
social security numbers, and they take the last number, and, uh, so, it, uh,
and it, uh, they just pick a last number social security numbers and that's
the way they do it, and it works really well.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And, um, I work with recruiters a lot, and they have, uh, they have it
monthly with recruiters.

B.10:  Is that mandatory for the recruiters?

A.11:  Uh, no, no, they do it that way, but, uh, well it's every three months,
excuse me, every three months, and they have, uh, we have about, um, oh, a
hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and, uh, they have (( )) a fourth of them every three months, they, on a
random basis,

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But, uh.

B.16:  Has your number come up?

A.17:  No, no --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- hasn't come up, I don't know, I that's part of the (( )) I, [laughter]
--

B.20:  Sure.

A.21:  -- the only thing you have to be careful, they know all those who join the
service, uh, it's mandatory that they're tested for drugs --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and, uh, if drugs are found, uh, in the system, then, uh, they're barred
for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again,
and if it's, uh, still positive then they can't go in.

B.24:  Huh.

A.25:  They've really cracked down on that, and, uh, I think that's, that's good,
because the source (( )) reputation for, for drugs.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  But it's surprising, uh, since they've been on, well, the first couple of
months, this has been around for about a year and a half.  The first few
months there was quite a few that were disqualified, and, uh, since then you
just never hear of it.  I guess the word got out, and the kids know if they
want to commit and join, then, uh, they have to be straight.  The only thing
that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with (( )), with these poppy
seeds on it --

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  -- and that would show up.

B.30:  You're kidding.

A.31:  No [laughter].

B.32:  Huh.

A.33:  No.  It's, it's, uh, it's kind of strange,

B.34:  [Throat_clearing].

A.35:  but, uh, the way they tell on that if they, if they're going to, if they
come into the motel to stay overnight, prior to being physical and tested and
then so forth, they tell them not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it --

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  -- a hard roll if they're having lunch or something, or dinner but,

B.38:  But what does it test, uh, for?

A.39:  Well, I'm not sure, and it just shows that they're, uh, that they've
specify that or just tell them that they'll have to be kind of careful.  Well,
and it's the same with alcoholic beverages, they, they test for that too.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, uh, I think it's great.  I really do --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- I, uh, but in the work place I, I feel that it should be something that
employers have the right to do if they want --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- to protect everyone concerned, and the, the only problem I can see, and
I've heard (( )) the fact that if they, uh, if the test, whoever runs the
test, they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a misreading
on it or something.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And that, that's happened in some instances, I guess, but, uh, I think
they're pretty well, what I've heard, and especially the ones that test the
soldiers, they, uh, they make sure they, they run them correctly and, uh, have
the right, right person with right sample and everything but,

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  So.

B.50:  My company's small enough here that, uh, in fact I don't know of any
companies right around the Twin Falls area that's testing.  I'm sure they're
here.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  But I certainly wouldn't be opposed.  Um, is it hard for you to tell people
that are on drugs.  I mean, and I don't know how you can confirm that or not,
but, uh, I'd really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs.
Now, it doesn't mean they're, they're not there --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and maybe the testing wouldn't, you know, show that they were there --

A.55:  Yeah --

B.56:  -- but,

A.57:  -- I, especially the, the, uh, alcohol, alcohol part of it.  That's a,
that's a thing that, uh,

B.58:  You can see that pretty easy can't you?

A.59:  Yeah, right, you really can, you can, and, uh,
