============================================================

B.1:  All right.  Well, we're supposed to talk about cars?

@A.2:  Right.  The car that, uh, probably the kind we'll get next
and, I, uh, I do a lot of driving, commute, uh, I have about, uh,
uh, fifty-three miles one way to commute #here in Utah# --

B.3:  #Gosh.#

A.4:  -- but it's, uh, freeway and it's not bad, but, uh, the cars
I've been getting, I've got a Toyota.  It's economical, now, I
got a #Honda # --

B.5:  #Yeah.#

A.6:  -- now and, um, and it's a five speed, and for all the driving I do, 
that, uh, is the kind I, I think I'd probably look at next.

B.7:  Uh-huh. Well, I'll probably look for a family, a family type vehicle
like a van, mini van or something, because --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- I've got two, I just, uh, I've got two young ones, so --

A.10:  I see.

B.11:  -- we're, we're looking for something that's --

A.12:  A little #bit bigger, [laughter] yeah.#


B.13:  -- #more family oriented, yeah, something bigger that# we can carry.

A.14:  Our family's gone.  We had six children at one time, but
they --

B.15:  Six.  [laughter]  

A.16:  -- uh, they're all gone, and so we, we can go to the smaller
car now, but we did have to, back then it was station wagons.

B.17:  Yeah, right.

A.18:  And, for a family, when you start taking much with you or
going any place, you really need a little more room.

B.19:  Right.

A.20:  I have a son in Plano, Texas who has, uh, four boys, and he's
got a, a van, and he really enjoys it.

B.21:  Um.  That's, that's right near me.

A.22:  Is it?

B.23:  Yeah, Plano's a few miles north.

A.24:  Oh, okay.  Well, he, uh, I know I've had several from
Richardson.

B.25:  Who does he work for?

A.26:  He works for J C Penney's.

B.27:  Oh, really.

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  Corporate office?

A.30:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.31:  Huh.

A.32:  #Yeah, he.#

B.33:  #Uh,# I've got a, I'm taking a class and, uh, one of the guys
that's in my, uh, my group that, we're doing a group
presentation, he works for J C Penney.

A.34:  Uh-huh.  Well, good.  Yeah, he, uh, he's been down there
going on three, three years now, I guess.

B.35:  Three years?

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  They're moving their offices to, to Plano, right, right now.

A.38:  Yes, uh-huh, they closed, uh, Pittsburgh, I think, and, uh,
they're moving, but, it's, uh, #so# --

B.39:  #Well, that's# good.

A.40:  -- in fact, I was just down there Thursday.  I was in El
Paso, and then I had a lay-, couple hours, uh, at the Dallas
airport and they came out and got to visit with them for a while. 
They got, I got me a little grand-, grandbaby, and --

B.41:  [laughter]

A.42:  -- first time I've seen him, but, uh.

B.43:  Well, that's great.

A.44:  I don't know, I, looking at cars, you, you, they say buy
American, but I, [laughter] boy of all the people I've talked to
that, uh, seems like they get a lot better mileage.  I had a
hundred and eighty thousand on the Toyota that I had in eighty --

B.45:  Yeah.

A.46:  -- and that thing, I hadn't had any problems at all, it was
just --

B.47:  Huh.

A.48:  -- going strong when I sold it.  #But, uh.#

B.49:  #That's super.#

A.50:  I guess it's just, it depends, there's lemons in all of them,
I guess, but, uh.

B.51:  Yeah.  Well, American cars are [throat_clearing], hopefully
they'll, I think unions really screwed American cars up.

A.52:  #I do# -- 

B.53:  #They, uh# --

A.54:  -- too, yeah.

B.55:  -- you know, the price of the cars are just more than --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- incomes are --

A.58:  Right, #yeah.#

B.59:  -- #because# people are, you know, the people that work at car
manufacturers make, well, the G M plant, or, yeah, the G M plant
that they have down here, that they're thinking about closing,
uh, the average worker there makes twenty-two dollars an hour --

A.60:  Oh, wow, (( )) #yeah, I've been working,#

B.61:  -- #and that's, you know, that's more than# a lot of people
make sala-, you know, #professionals make.#

A.62:  #Well, that's# it, I've been working for, oh, thirty-five years
for the government and think I've got a pretty good job, but I
don't make that much.

B.63:  Yeah.  [laughter] I don't either.

A.64:  And I've got, uh, a degree and everything else --

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  -- and I, and I don't know, hopefully you, you'd think that
if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a
little pride in, in, uh, the product that they put out, so it is
a good car, but --

B.67:  Sure.

A.68:  -- my family's bought, uh, my sister bought, uh, a, a Buick,
paid twenty thousand dollars for it, and she's had nothing but
trouble with that thing.

B.69:  Yeah.

A.70:  And, you know, you pay that kind of money, you should, uh, it
should be trouble free at least #fifty# --

B.71:  #Sure.#

A.72:  -- sixty, seventy thousand, and then, uh, she's had it in
the, in the sh-, garage and shop and she called today, said (( ))
leaking oil out of the head gasket.  She's only got about twenty-
thousand on it.

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  So she's got to take that back in and have them work on it,
but.  And I, and I think if, from what I can hear, just because
they, uh, they don't take the pride that, uh, the Japanese do, or
something, in, in their work or workmanship, that when something
comes out, and their name's on it, they want, uh, to be the best. I
hate to stay away from American
