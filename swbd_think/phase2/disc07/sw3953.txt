REMARKS:        White noise static near end of conversation appears to
be on Speaker A's side.  Preceding the static are some
intermittent beeps.  The two speakers talk at the same time
often, and sometimes do it for an entire sentence on each side. 
Speaker A is softer, and in his monologue this makes him only
about equal in loudness with Speaker B.

========================================================================

A.1:  you stand on gun control.

@B.2:  Um, I don't know.  I don't use guns, I mean, and I don't, you know, I, I
don't have any occasion to, I've never been much of a hunter and any of that,
so, I guess I haven't really felt real strongly one way or the other.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  How about you?

A.5:  I, I did a fair bit of hunting when I was growing up.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  I pretty well haven't in the last fifteen or twenty years.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  Pretty well given it up, so, um, now I do have some guns, uh, uh, I enjoy
shooting, you know, as far targets --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- you know, but I don't particularly enjoy hunting --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- any more.  I'm not really opposed to it, uh, but I am, I am in favor of,
uh, some, some form of gun control.

B.14:  Yeah, well I guess I do, too.  I, um, I think that law that they tried to
pass, I'm not even sure if they passed it or not, the seven, the seven day
waiting period --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- I, I think that's a, a reasonable law, and I'm not real sure why the N R
A was against it.  Uh, you know, it, it really didn't, the only thing it
restricted was that you couldn't pick up the gun right away.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Um.

A.19:  I, I don't see why you'd oppose it either.  You know, the, uh, um, for
people who want them for legitimate purposes --

B.20:  Yeah, seven days #shouldn't be a big, a big deal.#

A.21:  -- #seven days or even, even I'd even be in# favor of a, you know, thirty
days.  I mean --

B.22:  Yes.

A.23:  -- you don't need a gun on short notice.

B.24:  Right, and if you do, you want the gun for [laughter] something else --

A.25:  (( )).

B.26:  -- other than, than shooting target, because you can always get a gun to go
and shoot, you know, targets with.

A.27:  R-, that's right.

B.28:  Or, you know, even hunt, you can borrow a gun to do that.

A.29:  That's right #(( )).#

B.30:  #But, uh,# if you want it right away, you want it for a different reason
than, than a legitimate reason for having a gun.

A.31:  Yeah, and, uh, and the auto-, some of the automatic weapons that are sold,
you know, certainly have no purpose other than to, uh, kill humans --

B.32:  Yeah, it.

A.33:  -- you know, I'm talking about some of these automatic weapons.

B.34:  Yes, and I, I wonder about that, because they're, the sale of automatic
weapons, because, uh, I mean, how many [laughter], how many rounds does it
take to kill a deer?

A.35:  That's right, yeah, you get these twenty and thirty #shot rounds.#

B.36:  #If you need# thirty shots to kill a deer, you should be, uh, you should be
shooting with a camera [laughter].

A.37:  That's right, [laughter], that's even #worse than a# --

B.38:  #You're dangerous# anyway [laughter].

A.39:  -- that's worse than the auto wind, uh, cameras.

B.40:  That's right.  [laughter] So, I, yeah, I guess we, uh, we kind of feel the
same way about, about that.  I, uh --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- it's, it's funny because I was over at, in McKinney the other day, in,
picking up a dog, and, uh, and I saw some women, um, practicing, you know,
shooting.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And.

A.45:  Was it just outside some place?

B.46:  Just outside, yeah, out, out in the, uh, range, but, um, I, it reminded me
of, uh, you know, I was listening to a talk show the other day and, and heard
that the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens,
happens right in the home with somebody that, you know --

A.47:  Yeah, that, that's true.

B.48:  -- misuse of a gun.

A.49:  Yeah, and it's, it's pretty common that it happens with, uh, kids, too --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- that parents think that the guns hidden or that their, uh, kids won't
bother it, but then when they're left alone, sometimes, uh, a kid will show it
off to a friend, and they'll start handling it, and --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- pretty soon somebody gets shot.

B.54:  A lot of that happened, yeah, I don't, I don't really see why the N R A
would oppose.  I guess it's because they, you know, they don't want any, any
kind of, uh, of government restrictions on.

A.55:  I th-, I [beep] {continuous intermittent beeps} think what they're afraid
of is that, uh, [beep] not necessarily this one particular law [beep] about a
waiting period, but I think they're afraid that once, [beep] you know, uh, you
establish one regulation, they're afraid --

B.56:  Then --

A.57:  -- others would get started.

B.58:  -- it's a [beep] lot easier to just keep going from there.

A.59:  Yeah.  Let me, let me switch from my other phone here, I think my hand
phone's [beep] going dead here [laughter].

B.60:  Is that your phone or mine?

A.61:  Okay, can you still hear me?

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  Okay, yeah, setting the other one.

B.64:  You must have had a [static] {white noise type static lasting several
seconds} cordless.  Hello?  [static].

A.65:  Hello,

B.66:  Hello.

A.67:  I don't know who's on the other one.

B.68:  Oh.  [static] [clicking] Hello.  [/static] #You still there?#

A.69:  #You still there?# Yeah, I'm getting a lot of static.  I'm not sure what's
going on here.

B.70:  Huh.

A.71:  I switched phones, it may be mine.

B.72:  Well --

A.73:  Uh.

B.74:  -- I've switched phones, so.

A.75:  Okay.  Um, I think they, on, on, they were asking about a numbering system,
I guess,
