A.1:  recycling.

@B.2:  Well, uh, I think it's a really good thing, because, um, of all the
materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that, it's
just a complete waste, uh, you know, make them and then throw them away and
bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down
and reuse them.

A.3:  Exactly, I agree.

B.4:  And, uh, there's a, I mean, there's so many products that are like that,
it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle [breathing].

A.5:  Well, you know, I think it all depends on the consumer.  The more we, uh,
demand from, from the people that are producing these goods, that they use
recycled products, the more, you know, innovative that they'll be.

B.6:  Yeah, you're right there.  But then there's things like the, uh, newspaper
market where they try and recycle as much as they can, and then they, no one.

A.7:  They haven't got a market for it, right.

B.8:  Yeah.  Or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to
make it, so.

A.9:  Yeah.  Well, uh, do you have a recycling program where you live?

B.10:  Oh, yeah, uh, I go to Indiana University here, and its real big, and all
the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  Do you have plastics and that kind of stuff?

B.12:  Yeah, those are the, uh, well the University's really big about, they have
contests in the dorms --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and stuff to see who can, uh, recycle the most stuff.

A.15:  So this is like within the school.

B.16:  Yeah, within the school, and also the city here has, uh.

A.17:  Do they have curbside recycling?

B.18:  Yeah, monthly curbside recycling.

A.19:  That is nice.  See we don't have that here.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  It's going that direction, but it hasn't come yet, at least to my area, and
--

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- and I'm really anxious to, uh, get that, because I mean it's (( )), it's
really inconvenient for anybody to drive, you know, on the other side of town
and bring all, lug all that stuff, you know, #dirty# --

B.24:  #Right.#

A.25:  -- you know, things, and, and so I, I think that a lot more people would do
it if it was, you know, at their door.

B.26:  Right, but then you do, don't you get paid when you take your own, uh.

A.27:  Well, it really depends on the product and the place you go.  Some, some
places will repay you and some oth-, others won't.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  So, um, it depends on, you know, um, the demand for the product that you
have.

B.30:  Right.  Sounds like you are an avid recycler.

A.31:  [Laughter] I'm on the recycling committee at work, so.

B.32:  Are you?

A.33:  Everybody comes to me with all their questions, so I try to know as much as
possible.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  But, uh, we, just at work started recycling cans and, um, what else, and
paper, you know, office paper.

B.36:  Right, yeah, we do that at work, too.  

A.37:  But we don't do, you know, we don't do plastics or glass, and those are
easily recycled products in a lot of cases, but you know, you know they have
the little recycling triangle --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't
really recyclable.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  So that's kind of inconvenient as well.  Why put recyclable if its in, in
seventy-five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it.

B.42:  Right.  Well, aren't there pop cans that are like that also --

A.43:  Yeah, exactly.

B.44:  -- because they have mixed metals or something?

A.45:  Uh-huh, yep.  Well, anything else?

B.46:  Uh, no, not really.

A.47:  Well, reduce, reuse, and recycle, right?  [laughter].

B.48:  Right.  [laughter]   Words to live by.

@@A.49:  That's right.  I try to remember them.  I guess we've covered it.

B.50:  Okay.

A.51:  It was nice talking to you.

B.52:  You, too.

A.53:  Bye-bye.

B.54:  Bye-bye.
