============================================================================

B.1:  Well, so, you don't know too much about the Dallas Mavericks this, thi-,

A.2:  No, wh-, where they at this year, uh,

B.3:  [Laughter]. 

A.4:  They win in their division?  

B.5:  No [laughter].  They are, uh, only just a slightly a bit better than, uh,
the other expansion teams.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  They're, they're, they're a team in disarray right now.  

A.8:  Uh-huh {faint}. Do you, do you have a season pass you go watch them or,

B.9:  Actually I used to and I gave it up this year -- 

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  -- because I thought, well, Roy Tarpley wasn't going to make it and sure
enough, about a week after I decided not to buy my ticket, he went down with
his, uh, his drug problems.

A.12:  Um.  

B.13:  And, uh, boy the team just is going into a tailspin since then.

A.14:  Yeah, that's too bad.  I'm, I guess I'd be most familiar with, uh, the
Jazz.

B.15:  Yeah.  

A.16:  And I've never watched them, but, uh, interestingly enough, I, I, I got to
meet Carl Malone.

B.17:  You're kidding.  

A.18:  Huh-uh, uh,

B.19:  How did you manage that?  

A.20:  Well, i-, uh, I live about forty-five miles from Jackpot, Nevada --

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  -- and, uh, it's a t-, it's a town where they, uh, have, uh, uh, casinos
and so forth and I guess that's one of his pastimes.  I caught him down there
and he was playing the slot machines and, uh, y-, you know, would you know it,
somebody like him, he hit a five thousand dollar jackpot and then he turned
around, h-, hit another two thousand dollar jackpot,

B.23:  [Laughter]. 

A.24:  and they came and took his picture, and, you know, got the, uh, I R S
forms and stuff and he sat there and put all the money back into the machine,
lost every penny of it, didn't bother him a bit.

B.25:  Sound, sounds like a real game, huh.  

A.26:  Just, yeah, just doing it for enjoyment.  

B.27:  Well, he must, he must be a pretty big guy.  

A.28:  It was incredible.  When he stood up, he just towered.  He was a good foot
above anybody in there.

B.29:  Jeez.  

A.30:  And, uh, everybody was, uh, kind of excited to see him and he's, he, oddly
enough he was, uh, very friendly and cordial and stopped to sign a few things
and --

B.31:  Well, it's -- 

A.32:  -- so it was, it was neat.  

B.33:  -- it's nice to see those, uh, ((y- know)), those kind of guys when they
get paid all those big bucks to, uh --

A.34:  Yeah.  

B.35:  -- you know, to be halfway friendly.  

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  But, I know what you mean about talking about being big, I mean that's,
when I was in high school, I, I went to a, a Cleveland Cavaliers game, I'm
from Ohio, and a friend of mine runs, or used to run the clock down on the
floor, so he'd let me get down on the --

A.38:  Uh-huh.  

B.39:  -- floor at half time and I stood by these guys as they all walked out and,

A.40:  [Laughter]. 

B.41:  and gee whiz, they're just monsters.  

A.42:  Uh-huh.  

B.43: I mean, seven foot doesn't sound that tall, but when you stand next to one
[laughter], it is real tall.

A.44:  Yep.  Yeah, I hear you.  

B.45:  #So# --

A.46:  #So,#  

B.47:  -- d-, you do-, you don't get down to, uh, basketball games very often,
then.

A.48:  I don't, no.  We've got a small, of course, this isn't professional
basketball, but, uh, the C S I Golden Eagles,

B.49:  Uh-huh.  

A.50:  I don't know if you've heard of them, they're, they're number, they're the
number one junior college in the state, in the nation, excuse me --

B.51:  Wow.  

A.52:  -- and, uh, so they're here and they're kind of fun to go watch, but, uh,
uh, that's the, the most closest I get to, fact, I've only seen one
professional basketball game.

B.53:  So you --

A.54:  Uh,  

B.55:  -- didn't watch the all star game, uh, yesterday.  

A.56:  I kind of watched it on television, parts of it, I didn't, uh, #see the
whole thing.#

B.57:  #Yeah, I, I# got out.  The weather was so nice here that I got out and
didn't, didn't see any of it.

A.58:  Uh-huh, uh, yeah.  Well, what do you think about Magic Johnson, should he
play or should he,

B.59:  [Laughter] Well, that's, uh, you talking about the Olympics now?

A.60:  Yeah, I guess the summer Olympics is, uh -- 

B.61:  Yeah -- 

A.62:  -- what they,

B.63:  -- summer Olympics is his next thing.  Well, [breathing] I really, you
know, it's, it's his choice to play, but there's a lot of other people, ((you
know)), the other team's choice not, not to play against him.  I think he's
going to find a --

A.64:  Yeah.  

B.65:  -- a lot of people just say, well, heck, I'm not going to wor-, you know,
I'm not going to mess with that.

A.66:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, w-, I, d-, I think they, that they'd feel that way, too.
Interestingly enough, they've kept a s-, a seat open, uh, and he may even play
in the, in the tournament games for, uh, L A.

B.67:  Are you serious?  

A.68:  I'm serious.  I heard that the other day on a -- 

B.69:  How -- 

A.70:  -- sports,

B.71:  -- how can they do that if he hasn't played the whole season? 

A.72:  I, I don't know.  I don't know, I guess the roster's one man, you know,
there's a hole there still.

B.73:  Oh, unless they, yeah, unless they're just carrying a one odd guy instead
--

A.74:  Yeah.

B.75:  -- of carrying the ten or eleven that they carry.

A.76:  Right.

B.77:  Just carry one less.  

A.78:  That's what they've done.  

B.79:  #Well,# 

A.80:   #And there's,# 

B.81:  I, you know, I didn't watch the game, but a friend of mine was telling me
that he, you know, he played a lot, but he, he played then he'd sit down, then
he'd play and he'd sit down.

A.82:  Yeah.  

B.83:  It wasn't like he was out there for twenty or thirty minutes at a, at a go.

A.84:  Uh-huh, no he wasn't and, the, the, the part I saw is he, he made the last
shot of the game off balance three pointer and [laughter],

B.85:  [Laughter]. 

A.86:  I guess, uh,   

B.87:  Yeah, once, once, uh, he starts losing that weight and can't keep it on,
you know, he'll have to slow down and not, not do that kind of stuff.

A.88:  Yeah.  

B.89:  That, that's got to be awful t-, awful tough on his bod.  

A.90:  Uh-huh.  Well, when is your Mavericks going to do something? 

B.91:  Oh, jeez.  They, they are,

A.92:  They need more people, they need a coach, what do they need? 

B.93:  They need players.  

A.94:  Players.  

B.95:  And, and they need a front office that, that can judge players.  We've
traded away so many good players in the past five years and got nothing for
them, and drafted so many bad players and, you know, they haven't turned out.
It's, uh, it's very frustrating.

A.96:  Um.

B.97:  We, we had one year, we had two first round picks --

A.98:  Um.

B.99:  -- and we picked, uh, a guy by the name of Bill Wittington, uh, who's a
seven foot center, a white guy and ((Uvay Blob)), another seven foot white
center.  And they're both okay, but I think both of them are playing in the
Italy now.

A.100:  Um.  

B.101:  And they, you know, they traded away Mark Aguirre and got nothing for him.
I mean he had to go, but they, th-,
