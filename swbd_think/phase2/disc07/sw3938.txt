=======================================================================

A.1:   Uh [breathing], yeah, what, what, have you thought anything
about a-, another car?  

B.2:   Yes, I have a nineteen eighty-one Volvo station wagon with
over a hundred and fifty thousand miles [laughter] on it.  

A.3:   It's about time to start thinking, isn't it [laughter]?  

B.4:   Yes, and so, uh, I've actually been looking around and then,
then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so,

A.5:   Isn't it a pain to look for cars?  

B.6:   Yes.   

A.7:   I --

B.8:   Yes.

A.9:   -- I hate it.  I really do.  As a matter of fact, I've got, my
car is, uh, [lipsmack] I have a, an eighty-seven Lincoln -- 

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   -- and, uh, I just put it in the shop about, oh, two weeks ago
and [breathing] just spent about twelve hundred dollars on it.  I
decided to get everything that's wrong with it fixed, new brakes,
new shocks, new mufflers and all that because I'm going to keep it
till it dies.  

B.12:   Well, that, that's kind of, uh, I was, the brakes didn't feel
like they were working and peop-, people were saying, you know,
don't you get rid of it every three years and everything, and I
really was thinking about that, then it was like, get a loan, then
you've got to do these, you've got to investigate it, you've got to
check all these things, does it have that, you, you know, you can't
just go to this dealer, you really need to check them all, and you
can't fall in love with one, you've got to be able to turn your
back on, and then by the time everyone had given me their advice,
I thought, you know, this car turns on every morning.  I think I'll
[laughter] just keep going.  

A.13:   I know it, well, and the other thing is, too, uh, it, it's
just, I mean, the, the p-, the way the prices have gone up in the
past four or five years -- 

B.14:   Yes, yes.  

A.15:   -- uh, it just unbelievable.  

B.16:   Right, now that's right and, and, uh, the only thing I need
is, I'm not really into cars, so -- 

A.17:   Yeah.  

B.18:   -- I just need something to get me somewhere.  

A.19:   Yeah.  

B.20:   And I wanted an air bag.  I thought that would really be a
nice thing to have.  

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   Volvos are safe cars, the other thing is, I drive all parts of
town and all sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking car
made me much more vulnerable -- 

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   -- to something happening to it than the car I'm in.  

A.25:   I understand that.  

B.26:   [Laughter]  So,

A.27:   I, I do.  

B.28:   So, again -- 

A.29:   I understand that.  

B.30:   -- I think, well, now, wait a minute.  Besides which, I get a
more expensive, I mean, a, you know, a new car, I pay more in -- 

A.31:   #Insurance.#  

B.32:   -- #taxes.#  

A.33:   Yeah.  

B.34:   Uh-huh, and insurance [laughter].  

A.35:   Right, right, well, I've, I really have, uh, you know, like I
say, I, I feel like I have made a commitment now to drive the car
that I've got, which -- 

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- you know, and, and after, I will admit, after I had those
repairs made on it, I felt like, you know, it felt like it was new
again.  

B.38:   [Laughter] Like a good car, right?  

A.39:   Yeah, and I was very pleased with the money I had put into it,
which -- 

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   -- is odd that I ever walk away from spending any money on a
car that I felt good about, but in -- 

B.42:   That you felt good about, yeah.  

A.43:   -- but in this particular instance, I did.  Everything felt
like they just tightened everything up -- 

B.44:   Yeah.  

A.45:   -- somehow.  

B.46:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.47:   But, [throat_clearing] but I had decided kind of, you know,
just without really giving it a whole lot of thought, that when I
do buy again, uh, I bought this car that I've got, new, but
probably what I'm going to do sometime in the future is, uh, I'm
going to look around for a good, clean, used car, a year or two -- 

B.48:   Yes.  

A.49:   -- old.  

B.50:   That's exactly what they told me.  They told me too, they said
you should get it two years, because, I don't know, because the
price has come down that much in the two years -- 

A.51:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.52:   -- and, and, uh, X number of miles, you know, or, like eleven
thousand miles.  I can't rememb-, I mean people had all these
formulas.  I just felt in-, so intimidated.  

A.53:   Well, and, uh, you know, on, on note, I think anyone you talk
with is going to have a different viewpoint -- 

B.54:   Yeah.  

A.55:   -- on automobiles.  

B.56:   Yeah.  

A.57:   And, and the other thing is, too, I, I don't think that, what
is true for one person, may not necessarily be true for another,
because other, you know, so many different people have different
needs, and -- 

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- and, and --

B.60:   Uh-huh.

A.61:   -- desires --  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- as, as far as cars are concerned, but, uh -- 

B.64:   Yeah.  

A.65:   -- it's just the, the c-, the, I know h-, if I go out to buy
a new one, I mean I know what kind of money it would take to do it
and I just don't want to pay that much money.  

B.66:   Uh-huh [laughter], and, yeah, well, th-, that's my feeling,
too, and eventually, they'll be coming out with cars that, you
know, have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas,
which is something that matters to me, so, [breathing] uh, if, you
know, if I can keep this one going, I mean, then, uh, you know, I
even considered leasing, they talked about leasing, I looked into
that, and then that, you know, then, no, it does-, it makes sense
for this kind of thing, but not for that.  

A.67:   Yeah, I leased one car.  

B.68:   Oh, you did?  

A.69:   Yeah, I did that one time.  I had a, I got an eighty-five, or
rather it was a, uh, well, it, actually started to lease an eighty-
four and it was a three year lease.  

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   [Inhaling] You know the only thing about it is, [breathing] I
mean, it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out
of -- 

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   -- but you pay that money every month -- 

B.74:   Yes, yeah.  

A.75:   -- and then you're finished with it, and you don't have
nothing to show -- 

B.76:   You have nothing -- 

A.77:   -- for it.  

B.78:   -- left, yeah.    

A.79:   Granted, if you had spent that money buying one, you still
wouldn't have much so show for it [laughter] -- 

B.80:   Right, right.  

A.81:   -- but you would have at least a little.  

B.82:   Yeah.  

A.83:   So -- 

B.84:   Yeah.  

A.85:   -- it's, it, you know, I, I think it depends, I, I, I guess
there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do,
but I don't think I'll go that route again.  

B.86:   Well, and people told me, if you're the kind who buys a new
car every two to four years, that your,
