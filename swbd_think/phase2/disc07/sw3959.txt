A.1:  Well, do you have any children that, uh, go to college, went to college,
are about to go or anything?

@B.2:  Yeah, I had five go through college.

A.3:  Oh, my goodness.

B.4:  We put five through college.  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Oh, where did they go?

B.6:  Uh, two at Texas A and M --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and three at North Texas.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you are a very experienced person.

B.10:  Right. So.

A.11:  Uh, I have a son at the present moment who is a senior in high school, and,
uh, he has, uh, made three applications to schools that give a double degree
program, because that's what he wanted to, uh, take.  So he applied to the
University of Texas at Austin, and to the University of Pennsylvania, and to
Rice.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  So, uh, he's waiting at this time, uh, to see what kind of, uh, acceptances
and money grants might, uh, come in for him.  So, um, I, I think that, uh, it
became very evident in the beginning of senior year when he actually had to
sit down with the applications, he had about six schools that he was
interested in, but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he
also wants to keep a liberal arts degree --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- and actually get both --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- of them.  And not all that many places actually give you two degrees.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  So, he, he weeded out the ones, uh, that did not offer that kind of thing,
and just really wound up making three applications [laughter].

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  So, uh.

B.22:  That's probably your best --

A.23:  Yeah --

B.24:  -- bet --

A.25:  -- yeah.

B.26:  -- because, you know, you narrow it down --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- you're better off, I think -- 

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- in that and,

A.31:  Well, yeah, and, and as I saw the Fall progressing and, um, and his
viewpoint, it really became more evident that, uh, he, this is what he wanted
to do, and he didn't just want to get involved in the sciences without having
the leeway of the liberal arts, and I don't think he'll ever be a, um, you
know, a kind of a research --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- dedicated --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- test tube scientist.  So, uh.

B.36:  Is he going on for his Master's --

A.37:  I think he #might want to go# --

B.38:  -- #in the engineering?#

A.39:  -- to law school --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and, uh, use the engineering background maybe in patent law or,

B.42:  You almost need a Master's in --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- like if he's in engineering --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- in his major right now --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- one of his majors anyway right now to do anything with it --

A.49:  Oh, yes, #that's right, yeah.#

B.50:  -- #no matter what field you're in.#

A.51:  What, uh, kinds of fields did your children study in?

B.52:  Uh, well, my daughter, uh, both daughters, let me see, one daughter was in,
uh, business --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and business degree, and then the other,

A.55:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.56:  daughter was in a special ed degree --

A.57:  Oh wonderful, uh-huh.

B.58:  -- and lives and works, works with autistic children --

A.59:  Is that right?

B.60:  -- uh-huh, and then the other one was a personnel director --

A.61:  Uh-huh, oh, my.  

B.62:  -- uh, down in Houston for, um, several years, #seven years# --

A.63:  #Yeah.#

B.64:  -- and then, uh, my son is a C P A --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and another has a business degree --

A.67:  Oh, my.

B.68:  -- and then the fifth one is, he was hotel management, but actually he's in
the sign business now and making signs --

A.69:  Oh, gee whiz.  #Isn't that# --

B.70:  -- #and, uh,# --

A.71:  -- wonderful.

B.72:  -- likes that, and --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- has kind of hit on a nice setup with that.

A.75:  Is he, uh, local here in town or is,

B.76:  He is local --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- right, here in Richardson #and he really loves it# --

A.79:  #Oh, good for him.#

B.80:  -- uh-huh, and it's, uh, you know, that si-, the type of signs they do is
new in the last five years --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- it's the latest thing in signs.  

A.83:  Oh.

B.84:  It's the type that you put on the, put on windows and it peels off, #kind
of intere-, like it's painted on.#

A.85:  #Oh, yes,# I've seen those.

B.86:  Yes, so he.

A.87:  They're remarkable --

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  -- because they come right off.

B.90:  Right, he has the Dallas, uh, Furniture Mart, #uh, Clothing Mart# --

A.91:  #Oh [gasp].# 

B.92:  -- and the World Trade Center all tied up in that.  He has.

A.93:  Oh, good for him.

B.94:  So, yeah, so it's a nice deal.

A.95:  Oh, they've done well.

B.96:  #Yeah, he has.#

A.97:  #Uh-huh,# oh.

B.98:  He's just starting in it, but it #seems# --

A.99:  #Yeah.#

B.100:  -- to be a real up and coming thing --

A.101:  Oh, yes.

B.102:  -- because everything's so portable any more, I mean, you know --

A.103:  That's right.

B.104:  -- things are not stable, and people are renting places for a short --

A.105:  That's right.

B.106:  -- times, and --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- they don't want anything permanent any more.

A.109:  That's right, you just use #it when you need it,# --

B.110:  #So it works out quite well.#

A.111:  -- and, uh, then it's, you know, gone.

B.112:  Right.

A.113:  And it sure is very effective.

B.114:  Right.

A.115:  And then you can move into the next necessary thing --

B.116:  Uh-huh.  #Or on to a larger place# --

A.117:  -- #That is, uh-huh,# right.

B.118:  -- and not put that much into anything permanent.  So it --

A.119:  That's right.

B.120:  -- it works out pretty well for him.

A.121:  It's amazing.  Isn't it amazing everything they do these days?

B.122:  It is, #it's wonderful, it's wonderful.#

A.123:  #Uh-huh, I,# I think it is, too.

B.124:  So.

A.125:  It really moves --

B.126:  Oh.

A.127:  -- you from one thing to the other without having to hassle and, uh, #you
know# --

B.128:  #Right.#

A.129:  -- even like you said with the signs have to, you know, have to change
everything, and, uh,

B.130:  The other son, the other son used the library a lot in the college section
--

A.131:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.132:  -- for scholarships --

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  -- and, uh, my daughters and sons both did that, and they, they came up --

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  -- with some of the, you know, you would never,

A.137:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.138:  think of --

A.139:  Oh, really.

B.140:  -- applying for, and they would apply for them.  Well, nobody else did and
so they would get some,
