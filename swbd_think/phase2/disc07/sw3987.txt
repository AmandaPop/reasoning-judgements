==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Um, have you ever had to put one, a, a family member in a nursing
home?

@B.2:  No, but we're getting pretty close to it.  My wife's, uh, uh, step father
is in the hospital right now, and hopefully we can pull him out, uh --

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  -- back home, but --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- we don't know yet.

A.7:  Oh  [throat_clearing].

B.8:  How about yourself?

A.9:  Well, my mom is sixty-five, and she's, which I feel is, you know, quite
young still --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- but she's not in the greatest of health, and so recently, she has been
talking a lot about what we would do if we had to put her in a nursing home.
She's adamant that she does not want to live with any of her children --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and put that burden on us.

B.14:  Yeah, so, so is, uh, so is our, uh, my g-, my, uh, my mother's parents.

A.15:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.16:  My grand-, my mother and daddy are dead.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  But their parents are still alive?

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  Oh, my goodness.

B.20:  Eighty-four and eighty.

A.21:  Wow [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  Oh.  

B.24:  Yeah, eighty-four one, eighty-four year old man,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.26:  is in the hospital --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- but we've been looking into it, and, uh, course, nursing homes, I think,
uh, you would find that, uh, you would want, uh, one close to home --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- and one that has a pleasant surrounding --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and one that has good staff, that, uh, you know, will take care of you
and treat you, you know, like a, a, like an individual --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- and, uh, and look after your every needs.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  I know down here in Texas we've had a lot of problems with nursing homes,
#and, uh,# --

A.37:  #Oh.#

B.38:  -- that don't, uh, take care of their people.  They've gone in.  They've
closed down a lot of them, and they put new regulations on some of them.  You
go in, you find an old person with a bed sore because they haven't been turned
--

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  -- or haven't been cleaned.

A.41:  Oh, dear.

B.42:  So, uh, all of that, uh, you know, I think someone needs to know, uh,
about, uh, the qualifications of the nursing home --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and the staff.

A.45:  Now, how do you go about finding out things like that?

B.46:  Well, let's assume that, uh, you wanted to take your mother to a, uh,
nursing home there locally in Ogden.  I'm sure you've got some that's close
by.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Uh, uh, what would be real nice is find one around the corner --

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  -- that you could visit, that you could go in and, uh, talk to the people
--

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- talk to some of the people's, uh, uh, siblings --

A.53:  Oh, that's right.

B.54:  -- or, you know, children, children, and, uh, find out how they like it,
#you know.#

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  Course one of the most important things, is, is, uh, can you afford it.

A.57:  Well, that's true --

B.58:  And, uh --

A.59:  -- that's right.

B.60:  -- down in some small cities here in Texas it's about fifteen hundred
dollars a month.

A.61:  Oh, my.

B.62:  Over here in Dallas it's closer to three thousand.  If you really want to
get super care, you know, you can pay anything you want.

A.63:  [Laughter]  Boy.

B.64:  We haven't even mentioned Medicaid, #uh# --

A.65:  #Well.#

B.66:  -- which, and, uh, which, uh, would take care of an individual --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- who is destitute --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and course, there's a lot to be said about, uh, making a member
destitute --

A.71:  Oh. #Well.#

B.72:  -- #as# opposed to paying for it yourself, because --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- the government, you know, uh, provides for a destitute person.

A.75:  Well, that's what my mom's been saying.  You know, she's been just saving
her money and not paying a penny of it, but she says, My little bit of savings
will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- and then I'll be on Medicaid, anyway.  So, she said, why don't I go out
and, and enjoy life while I can, and, you know, when I get to that point of
being in a nursing home, then maybe Medicaid will just have to take care of
me.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  But why don't I just enjoy life now?

B.80:  Well, yeah, and that's true, because, uh, after the year's gone, all of her
savings are going to be eaten up, and if she owns her house, uh, I'm not sure
about,

A.81:  [Throat_clearing].

B.82:  the total rules on the house, but I assume that you have to sell the house
and #those proceeds# --

A.83:  #I think so.#  

B.84:  -- would go to pay for the nursing home.

A.85:  Yes.

B.86:  And anyway, (( )) it's unlawful, uh, there's nothing wrong with a parent
gifting everything she has to, uh, to an individual --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- like, uh, like, like you --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- and then, uh, from there on out, uh, saving that money so that, uh, you
could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid.

A.91:  Oh.

B.92:  A lot of people do that.

A.93:  Oh.

B.94:  And most, one of the most important things, uh, about sending a person to
a, the nursing home, is, is the burial provided for.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  See, that should be provided for before she ever goes out of monies or
otherwise, you know, the, #the, uh, the, uh# --

A.97:  #That's right.#

B.98:  -- the kids have to provide that.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  You know, so you've thought about all this.

A.101:  Yeah.  Well, it's, it's kind of a sad thing to think about, isn't it?

B.102:  Oh, yes, it's very sad.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  We had a discussion with her mother who is #(( )),# 

A.105:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.106:  eighty years old --

A.107:  Um.

B.108:  --  this past weekend, and, uh,
