==========================================================================

B.1:  Um, so what do you think of, um, the way that the government has, has moved
towards, you know, getting involved in people's individual, uh, lives?

A.2:  Well, uh, I, did, did, have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman?

B.3:  Um, yeah, he's a commentator, isn't he?

A.4:  Yeah, well, no, no he actually wasn't.  He's a, he was, uh [breathing] he's
an anti government type --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- uh, fellow.  He's not really a commentator I don't, I don't believe.

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  Uh, but he wrote several books years ago, and, and he put out like ten
different movies on government, and, and, uh, and I'm a, kind of a Milton
Friedman fan --

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  -- and he's anti big government, and that's, that's my feeling about it.  I
think our government is way too big, um --

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  -- there just, a tremendous amount of waste.  I'm, I'm a C P A --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- and I, I see the way they, uh, butcher people, as far as I'm concerned,
and, uh, in, in, in, in the tax end of it, as far as how they, they take money
from them.

B.15:  And so you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view.

A.16:  You bet, I do.  Yeah.

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  Something interesting to me right now, too, is this presidential campaign.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  Uh, I, I can't believe how ta-, our money, our life really centers around
money --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- the whole thing, and you can see, uh, how tax laws, uh, in new
legislation right now are really a critical big issue.

B.23:  Yeah, and it means, a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- I think, you know, as far, at least as far as our deficit's concerned --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- you know, every one, and every, all the candidates just seem to be, you
now, have this bread and circuses policy of, you know, we'll give you a dollar
a day, if you vote for us.

A.28:  That's right [laughter].

B.29:  Yeah, [laughter] yeah, I mean, your kids won't be happy, but, [laughter] --

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  -- you'll be able to buy that, that extra six pack of beer at the end of
the week [laughter].

A.32:  Right.  The deficit the country's in right now is just incredible.  I heard
a statistic the other day, I don't know if this is wrong or right --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- but for every man, woman, and child in the United States, they're in
debt, uh, about forty thousand dollars a piece.  I have a family of five.  If
I had, if I had to pay that much, responsible for that much debt --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- I'd be done, I'd be sunk.

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  You know, I just, I, there's no way I can generate the income to service
that kind of debt.  I don't know what the heck our government's going to do.
One time, um, I, I really personally think we're going to have to collapse,
just like the Soviet Union did --

B.39:  Uh.

A.40:  -- or, uh, I, I don't know, how, how, how can we.

B.41:  It really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years.

A.42:  Yeah, right, I don't see it in the near future, but, uh.

B.43:  And we, we are still considered the best credit risk in the world,

A.44:  [Laughter].

B.45:  supposedly.

A.46:  Because we write off.  [laughter] We loaned the Mexican government five
hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  That's the same thing with what happened over there, um, in, I, and I
believe it was Turkey.  We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian
Gulf --

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  -- so we just went over there and said, Gee guys, you owe us all this
money, well, I tell you, let us land our planes here and we'll just forget it.

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  That's ridiculous --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- and, and I don't know if that's really the case, you know, I'm talking
all out of hearsay and conversation from what I've heard, uh, from other, from
other, some of my other associates, but, that wouldn't surprise.

B.55:  (( )) We, we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in
things.

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  Um.

A.58:  What do you think about the Japanese and the comments they've made recently
about the American people?  I'm not sure that's actually a political issue,
but, uh.

B.59:  Well, in it, um, I think if anyone but the Japanese had made it, if, if, if
an American had said the same thing, people probably would have agreed with
them [laughter].

A.60:  [Laughter] That's true.  And I'm not so sure they're all that wrong.

B.61:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, you know, we, we our companies are, have
definitely become top heavy --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- um, in management.  Um, you know, we, you know, we, we, you know, you
know, the trend of over consumption since World War Two, um, you know, (( ))
being that, that's what, what, what would be required to make our economy to
thrive the best, you know, that, that we, you know, that, the workers just
been given that, just moved for better and better standards of living, and
where a bunch of other factors, I think, you know, is just, you know, it's,
it's, uh, we're, we're unable to keep on increasing that, you know, when,
when, you know, when you combine with the mismanagement that a lot of American
companies have had, and, yeah, I think that, you know, that's really, when he
says that they were la-, I think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use,
but I think, you know, you know, un-, unwilling, you know, the American
workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other
country's workers are.

A.64:  Right.
