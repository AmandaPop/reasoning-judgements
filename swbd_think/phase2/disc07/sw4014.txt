A.1:  Well, I don't know how you feel about drug testing, but I'm dead set
against it.

B.2:  Well, so we can have a conversation on, on agreeing with one another
#today, right,# 

A.3:  #[Laughter].#

@B.4:  because [laughter] we keep working to see if we can find any candidates
who will help us change the, the trend that we have, seem to have of --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- interfering with people's personal life.

A.7:  Yeah, um, I think about the only candidates that are out there that are,
you know, anti, anti war on drugs, or vis-a-vis war on rights, is, uh, pretty
much to your libertarian candidates, which, um, I personally have some doubts
as to whether any of them can get elected.

B.8:  Well, that's always a problem.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  I have to admit that, that back when, uh, the Texas governorship race was
going on, that was the one thing that made me really pleased with Ann Richards
is that she refused to get involved in --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- discussing that whole issue.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Well, it just, I mean, really seems the ridiculous because, um,
the, um, U S Department of Labor, whatev-, I'm not sure might be a different
agency, requires, um, businesses to post this poster that has like minimum
wage laws and a bunch of other laws, and one of the things it posts is, um, on
the ille-, illegality of, um, lie detector tests, and, um, you know, I feel
that lie detector #tests are.#

B.14:  #The self incrim-,# self incrimination kind of thing, yeah.

A.15:  Well, it means that, that, that there are limits, there are definite
government limits to, you know, how an employer can use lie detectors on its
employees, and I think that, uh, I mean, I do, I, I agree that the lie
detectors are inappropriate, but I think, you know, that it's hard to justify
being, I don't understand how our government can encourage drug testing and
discourage lie detector tests because it seems like they're testing the same
sort of nebulous --

B.16:  Yeah, yeah, because --

A.17:  -- character.

B.18:  -- the, the tests are equally unreliable --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and personally I don't even think it's a question of whether they're
reliable or not.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  I mean, it doesn't matter how reliable they are, then, I think that it's
inappropriate.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  You know, actually, I can almost understand it more for somebody who's
getting ready to hire someone --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- than I can allowing them to spot test or random --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- test people who are currently employed --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- because I think that current employment, you know, continuation of
employment should be based on performance.

A.31:  Yeah, and, and, you know, I, I agree with, with a lot of people that, you
know, claim that instead of having random drug tests for continued employment
have, um, motor impairment tests --

B.32:  Okay.

A.33:  -- uh, because, you know, they, they, they would not be any more, they
would, they would be similarly priced, um, and, you know, if someone, if some
guy goes to work and he had a fight with his wife the night before, and, you
know, he has that on his mind and isn't going to be able to function properly,
you know, I, I just as, you know, I, I, it almost as much, you know, have as
much, uh, fear of him driving the bus I'm riding than.

B.34:  [Laughter]  Or maybe more.

A.35:  Yeah, or maybe more, yeah [laughter].

B.36:  Well you know if you stop and think about it --

A.37:  (( )).

B.38:  -- stop and think about it, he can get awfully hostile and decide to --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- take care of the whole world one day --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- or something.  Yeah, well, you're absolutely right --

A.43:  And al-, --

B.44:  -- you're absolutely right.  Uh.

A.45:  -- and also on the question of, you know, just getting employment.  I'm,
you know, I'm, I'm a senior in college, and I'm applying for jobs and I know,
I know a lot of people that are doing it also, and I know some of which that
few indulge in certain, um, non sanctioned, um, hobbies, and their basic
attitude toward drug testing is, is just, um, moving away, moving away from,
you know, the relatively harmless drugs, like marijuana, which, uh, you know,
lingers for about thirty-five days to things like cocaine and L S D which, you
know, one they don't test for, well, L S D they don't test for, and cocaine
which only stays in your system for about a week [noise] and I [laughter]
used, you know I, I, just, you know, wonder what effect this is having, you
know.

B.46:  Uh, it certainly sounds that if, if that's what college students are doing,
that that's --

A.47:  Yeah --

B.48:  -- anti productive.

A.49:  -- yeah, I mean, that's, you know, that's entirely anecdotal evidence.  I
know, a couple people, you know, that have moved in the direction, but --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- I just, you know, wonder, you know, overall what the trend is.

B.52:  Well, that of course there's really, there's really no way to know.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Uh, it's, I just, you know, unfortunately I've, I've talked with a, um,
some friends of mine --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- who are lawyers, recently about that, because my husband's in a job
situation that, um, makes him --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- subject to this sort of thing, and it makes him extremely unhappy with
his work place.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  And, uh, you know, not that he does it, not that he's ever done it --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- he's one of the straightest people I know, which is, it, but it has
nothing to do with --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- you know, (( )), he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control --

A.65:  Yeah --

B.66:  -- so he doesn't --

A.67:  -- and just the feeling that, you know (( )).

B.68:  -- so he, yeah, so he wouldn't do it.  But on the other hand he also
doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life.
