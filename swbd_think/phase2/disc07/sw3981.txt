===========================================================================

B.1:  So, you, uh, exercise on a regular basis?

@A.2:  Uh, I don't, Vinny, I'm a, a C P A and this time of year I'm dang busy,
but, uh, I do do a lot of exercise in the spring and summer and in the fall.

B.3:  Uh-huh, what kind of exercise do you do?

A.4:  Well, I, I don't go to a health club and work out and things of that
nature, but, I, I run a lot.

B.5:  Uh-huh

A.6:  I usually try to get, uh, oh, about three mornings --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- three mornings a week where I run two, two miles a day.

B.9:  Oh, that's not bad.

A.10:  How about yourself?

B.11:  Well, I, uh, I like to run, but, uh, I have problems with my back hurting
--

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- so, uh, I run, if I run it's usually short durations, and I only do it
when I can't, you know --

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  -- get out of the house, um, there, you know, to go because I usually work
out in a health club --

A.16:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.17:  -- and I try to work out like every other day, and sometimes when it's like
a really nice day outside, I don't feel like going inside to work out, then I
go ahead and run for short duration.

A.18:  Uh-huh.  Uh, do you, uh, pump iron, or what kind of, uh?

B.19:  Yeah, I use, I like to do, uh, free weights --

A.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.21:  -- because I found certain parts of my body developed better than other
parts of my body --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- so, uh, instead of, they, you know, they have like different circuits
and they tell you to work every single muscle in your body, and, uh, I hate
working a muscle that, you know, just won't develop [laughter].

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  So, uh, I've, I've gotten, uh, I've adapted to a, a routine, and I like to
work my arms and my chest and my stomach, and everything else just seems to
stay the same no matter what I do to it.

A.26:  Um.

B.27:  So, those are what I like to work out the most, and, you know, I get a
pretty decent workout with my legs --

A.28:  Uh, (( )).

B.29:  -- um, just, you know, on occasion running, but, or, you know, just running
around what I do every day, so.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  I, I've never been around weights much.  Is, how, how's a dead
weight help you versus the machine type?

B.31:  Well, what happens is sometimes, uh, now different machines, I guess, uh,
work different ways, but, uh, the way I look at it, if sometimes the machine,
one hand can put more force, can put more force than the other one --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other, or one
leg --

A.34:  Oh.

B.35:  -- more than the other, because the machine --

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  -- averages the weights out --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- because you're pulling like the same set of weights #every day.#

A.40:  #Right, uh-huh.#

B.41:  They have different machines that will, uh, um.

A.42:  Equalize that or,

B.43:  Right, they have what, they have like a weight for one side and a weight
for the other side, and that's you know, better than, uh, than like a
universal set usually has like one set of weights that --

A.44:  Right.

B.45:  -- you know, you do for both of them.

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  Um, but even then, uh, I, I'd like to think the free weights simulate a ((
)), a real world situation better --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- you know, like, uh, just like a friend of mine used to tell me, he goes,
uh, if you work out with free weights, you know, and a car falls on you, think
the free weights going to give you better, uh, [laughter] better idea --

A.50:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.51:  -- of what's going to happen rather than if you work out with, uh, you
know, with some kind of machine.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  But, uh, the machines, the one thing the machines do do that the free
weights don't do, is they focus on a specific muscle, or muscle group --

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  -- which is something I don't think you will get out of the free weights,
because the free weights just kind of work your whole body, I guess, or --

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  -- a whole area, as opposed to like one spot, because if you get like a
particular nautilus machine or something --

A.58:  Yes.

B.59:  -- you can get it like down to, you know, the very last muscle down there.

A.60:  Um.

B.61:  So, it works pretty good.

A.62:  What do you, uh, do you work your cardiovascular system at all other than
the running?  How do you, #you know, get your# --

B.63:  #Um, (( )).#

A.64:  -- heart rate up for a while?

B.65:  I'm sorry, say that one more time.

A.66:  I was just wondering how you get your heart rate up, or does pumping iron
do that.

B.67:  Oh, no, usually what I do, is when I get to the, uh, I, I usually like run
around the track.

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  They have a track there.

A.70:  Okay.

B.71:  I run around the track, uh, you know, uh, maybe like, it's a tenth of a
mile all the way around.  So I just run real slow, you know, maybe do a couple
of laps --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- just enough to get my heart rate going, and, uh, after that then I just
go ahead and just get in my routine.  I do, uh, I do my, um, my sit ups first,
and that also, uh, that gets my heart rate going too, and then I, I don't pump
iron until maybe like halfway through, and then I sit down and start doing
the, the free weights --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- and then I usually run before I leave to kind of relax me a little bit.

A.76:  That's incredible.

B.77:  Yeah, it, it works out okay.  I haven't, uh, I, the problem is, you know, I
get into it and I work out for three months, four months in a row --

A.78:  Uh-huh.

B.79:  -- get in great shape, and then, you know, I'll have a business conference.
I usually go overseas twice or three times a year --

A.80:  Yes.

B.81:  -- and, to attend these conferences, and they kill me [laughter].  You, you
travel, you eat a lot, you, um, [throat_clearing] it messes up, you know,
your, uh, biological clock, you know --

A.82:  Yeah.

B.83:  -- and, uh, it just screws you up completely [laughter] --

A.84:  Huh.

B.85:  -- and by the time you come back --

A.86:  Do --

B.87:  -- you don't feel like working out, you know [laughter].

A.88:  -- do, do, do your muscles, uh, do, do you lose the tone fast, do you lose
the #strength in them, fairly quickly or.#

B.89:  #Well, uh, I,# you don't lose strength, I don't think, you lose a little
bit of tone --

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  -- um, but you get back into it and, you know, it doesn't take very long to
build it back up, but, uh, I don't think, you know, they say you get flabby if
you, you know, the more you work out --

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  -- and you get all big muscles and stuff, and (( )) when you stop, they say
you get flabby when you get older, you know.

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  Well, it may happen, but, like I said, it's easy to develop them, because
if I lose, if I lose tone, you know, by not working out, uh, over a period of
a week or two,
