=======================================================================

A.1:  children do you have?

@B.2:  Uh, just the one screamer.

A.3:  Okay.  [laughter]  How old, how old i-, is, uh, he or she?

B.4:  He's eighteen months today.

A.5:  All right.

B.6:  Yeah, #and, uh.#

A.7:  #Year and a half.#

B.8:  Huh?  Yeah, and he's, um, he's discovered pens and that you lick the backs
of stamps --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- that's what he was screaming about, I just (( )).

A.11:  Well, I would suppose a lot of your time is spent with yours,
then.

B.12:  Yes, I, I'm a full time mother, and I --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- spend all day, yes, and I spend all day with the baby.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  How, how do you see most of the world now, uh, uh, the country
spending time with their children?

B.16:  I see a real growing trend for families going back into the home, where a
lot more people if they really can, can make a tight budget, they're going
back to where the women take care of the children at home.

A.17:  And not working so much to --

B.18:  And not working, #not#

A.19:  -- #live,# live in the fancy homes and drive the nice cars.

B.20:  Yeah, I think, uh --

A.21:  Uh.

B.22:  -- I personally see that happening, maybe I'm not in the right
neighborhood, but --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- I really do see it, a big trend toward that, and people even not waiting
as late in life as they had been.  I know for a while that there were people
waiting to have their families --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and I think that trend is, is slowing down.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  I, I'd have to agree with you.  That's what's happening back here
in the West.  More people are, are just saying it's not worth it, and, uh --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and spending more time at, at home.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  I know it's tough for our family to do that.  I've got three kids --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, my oldest one is only six, but she's still in dance and
kindergarten and, you know, she's got a bunch of things going on, and --

B.34:  Oh, yeah.

A.35:  -- and, uh, I, my, it's a good thing my wife, she, she does work a little
bit.  She works part time --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- as a college instructor, she, at a --

B.38:  Oh.

A.39:  -- junior college here --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- but she has time to go to all of her, uh, dance concert recitals and
things, and --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- and it just means so much, and I, I try to be there, but I don't get to
go all the time.

B.44:  Well, I agree, it, it's really important to me to support my family --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- to support my children and to support the children of my brother and
sister, too --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- that I think children without support are really, they're
missing out a lot.

A.49:  Yeah.  My, you know, when, when I was growing up my, I, I
played high school sports --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and my dad rarely missed a footb-, my mo-, mom and dad both, but mostly
my dad, rarely missed a football game or a basketball game, even if we had to
travel away from the local area.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  He would always go, and, uh --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- I remember that --

B.56:  Oh, and it.

A.57:  -- and I'll never forget that, you know.

B.58:  Well, it obviously made a really good impression on you.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  So.

A.61:  And that's something that I'd sure like to do with my kids when they.

B.62:  Yeah, well, I agree, I'm, I'm even considering putting my son
at two in a tumbling class --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and, you know, going and maybe staying with him during most of the
class, and then going to see what he does, and all that, because I really, I
think it's important for children to be around children, but I also think it's
important for there to be a tight nucleus at home.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  So, I've, trying to think of what else, what was the other part of the
topic.

A.67:  Um, trends, and, uh --

B.68:  Trends.

A.69:  -- we've talked about trends, um.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  You're, you're talking about your fa-, does your, do you find your husband
has a hard time spending time with the child.

B.72:  Yes.

A.73:  It's tough, isn't it.  

B.74:  Well.

A.75:  I sure have a hard time, see, I still at work now.

B.76:  Oh, are you?  [laughter].

A.77:  Yes, it's, uh, late, it's sure tough for me.

B.78:  He has a tendency, um, to leave it to me, since I'm with him
all day --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and it's really hard for me to let go, too.  I feel very attached to my
son, and I, I'm sure it would change if I had another one, but I'm, I just
don't think that, I don't know, I, I don't see much of a change happening
there.  I wish they would spend more time together, but we'll, uh --

A.81:  What --

B.82:  -- we'll see how that goes.

A.83:  -- what line of business is he in?

B.84:  He's, um, a scientist with T I.

A.85:  Um. [laughter] So he's part of the study here then almost isn't he.

B.86:  Well, it's, um, it's not the speech study, but it's a
different kind of study.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  I mean, he, he works in, uh, laser, he's a laser physicist --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- so it's a completely different line of work --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- than, uh, than the speech program, but --

A.93:  Yep.

B.94:  -- anyhow.

A.95:  Well, I, I'm an accountant, and I know it takes, it's, it takes a lot of,
lot of time away from the home --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and so, uh, I just don't, I, the only time I get a lot of time with my
kids is when,
