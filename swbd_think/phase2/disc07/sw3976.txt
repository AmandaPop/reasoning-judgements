B.1:  Okay, yeah, the topic is, uh, car repairs.

A.2:  Right.

@B.3:  and the last one I've had done.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  It was a fluke, the last one I had done.

A.6:  What happened?

B.7:  Well, I was driving down six thirty-five at the, um, coming from North
Dallas --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- and I was, uh, going, um, almost hitting the, um, entry where all the,
the merges go from six thirty-five, seventy-five and Coit --

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  -- and, uh, all of a sudden I get this liquid all over my hood and my
windshield, and I had smelled it before, I thought, and I thought that it was
coming from another vehicle, and then when I saw it go all over my car, I
thought, Huh-uh, something came through my radiator and just, something's
wrong inside my car, so I, I was waiting for my car to collapse, you know
[laughter],

A.12:  [Laughter].

B.13:  so I was going about sixty-five miles an hour, and it kept going, and I
thought well, what is going on, and so I made it home, and I looked at my car,
and it was a mess.  So I immediately, the next morning I took it to my dealer,
and I, I left it just, well, I drove it in the, the night before, and he says,
well, it looks like your, uh, antifreeze, uh, something happened to your
antifreeze.

A.14:  Huh.

B.15:  And they checked everything in that car, and it wasn't from my car, it was
from some other car --

A.16:  Some other car had.

B.17:  -- some other car did that to me.

A.18:  Well, isn't that something?  #Well.#

B.19:  #Well,# I'm glad --

A.20:  I'm sure.

B.21:  -- but it was a very panicky situation.

A.22:  Right.

B.23:  But, no I do not do any of my own repairs.  The only thing I do to my car
is put gas in it --

A.24:  Well, I do --

B.25:  -- and wash it [laughter].

A.26:  -- I do some of my own repairs [laughter].

B.27:  Oh, you do?  Good for you.

A.28:  Yes, I do, I, I have learned to do this --

B.29:  That's great.

A.30:  -- but, uh, my husband drives, uh, sports cars, he races them --

B.31:  Oh, I see.

A.32:  -- as a hobby.

B.33:  Oh, well, he probably showed you all the tricks --

A.34:  Yes.

B.35:  -- of the trade.

A.36:  And he said --

B.37:  That's great.

A.38:  -- you need to know how to do all this stuff.

B.39:  Sure.

A.40:  So I do change my own oil, uh, most, in fact I have changed out a whole
engine, in one of sons' trucks.

B.41:  You did?

A.42:  Yes, #I took the whole thing out# --

B.43:  #Well bless your heart.# 

A.44:  -- and I fixed it.  

B.45:  [Laughter].

A.46:  Well, I think it's really important to know these things if you can.

B.47:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  I mean [laughter] --

A.48:  But, uh [laughter].

B.49:  -- I think that's great.

A.50:  But now, if I could talk him into doing this, I'll let him do it
[laughter].

B.51:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

A.52:  I've told him I've learned how, but.

B.53:  Well, gee, you should, uh, you know, you should get some money for your
talents,

A.54:  [Laughter].

B.55:  and start branching out [laughter].

A.56:  No, I don't think I want to work on too many people's cars.  That's hard
work.

B.57:  It is.

A.58:  I think they earn their money, I do.

B.59:  Oh, well, you know, uh, loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem
for me.

A.60:  Right.

B.61:  And I know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they
do it electronically and all that, but that takes money to buy those kind of
tools, too.

A.62:  Yes, it does.  

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  Now I, I don't think I will be able to work on, you know, too many cars
much longer, because they are sophisticated, and --

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  -- I just can't fool with these computers and things that --

B.67:  Right, yeah.

A.68:  -- they have in it that.

B.69:  No, I wouldn't want, I wouldn't want anybody to touch my car without having
all the, #the# --

A.70:  #The# proper tools --

B.71:  -- yeah --

A.72:  -- right.   That's.

B.73:  -- the computer and all and everything.

A.74:  But, it, uh, I had just gotten a new car this year, and I take it back to
the de-, I take this one to the dealer [laughter].

B.75:  Because you have that, uh, as a, a gift to you, don't you --

A.76:  Yes.

B.77:  -- that they do it for you for gratis.

A.78:  Right, uh-huh, at least this first year.

B.79:  Uh-huh, right.

A.80:  And, uh.

B.81:  Well, I have a woman's agreement on mine, and they, they did it for three
years.

A.82:  Oh.

B.83:  Yeah.

A.84:  Well, that's nice.

B.85:  Yeah, that really was nice, so I, uh, appreciated that, uh, present that
they gave me.

A.86:  Uh-huh, well that is really good.  But, I can't think of any, offhand, uh,
problems we have really had lately, you know, that we've had to fix.  Uh, the
one thing we have problem with is our electricals, anything --

B.87:  Oh.

A.88:  -- that goes electrical wrong with the cars --

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  -- we don't even try to fool with those ourselves.

B.91:  Right.

A.92:  And, uh, they, to me they're very difficult to locate the problem, if you.

B.93:  Well, don't they have, if you, that you hook it up to the computer and the
computer does the analysis and tells you what's wrong --

A.94:  Right, they can do that #with the new ones.#

B.95:  -- #with the different areas.#

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  Yeah, yeah.

A.98:  But these newer cars you can do that, and, uh, but other than that, the oil
changes and the gas, is, water and antifreeze, I do keep that in there, and,
uh.

B.99:  Well, I, I have put windshield washer solvent in the container, but.

A.100:  Yeah.  Have you ever changed the windshield wiper?

B.101:  No,

A.102:  [Laughter].

B.103:  I have not [laughter].

A.104:  [Laughter].

B.105:  This one hasn't needed any --

A.106:  Yeah, yeah.

B.107:  -- thus, thus far.  Um, it's been a super car.  It's, uh, let's see, uh,
it's three years old.

A.108:  Oh, well, good.

B.109:  It's.

A.110:  What kind is it?

B.111:  It's a Plymouth Acclaim.

A.112:  Uh-huh, well good.

B.113:  I really like it, it's been a very dependable, um, no maintenance, I have
not,
