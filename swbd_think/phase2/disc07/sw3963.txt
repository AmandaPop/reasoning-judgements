===========================================================================

A.1:  I'm ready.

B.2:  Okay, have you returned anything lately?

A.3:  Uh, no I haven't.  The only thing I had to, I had to return was a table
top, but that was like three years ago, of a dining room table that I got.

B.4:  Um.

A.5:  It was marked on the top of it, so all they did was replace it.

B.6:  Um.

A.7:  But, as far as, um, lawn mowers, I've bought lawn mowers in the last three
and a half years --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and they've been working fine, my hedger's working fine, my weedeater's
working fine.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  I haven't really had to return anything, you know --

B.12:  (( )).

A.13:  -- except that table top that was marked.

B.14:  Now, okay, wait, wait a, there, was the topic talking about returning lawn
equipment, or was it anything?

A.15:  No, it said anything.

B.16:  Oh, okay  [laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  Now okay, um, well, I, uh, I returned a camera recently.

A.19:  Oh, you did?

B.20:  I, I, I bought a little, uh, Minolta camera --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, the auto focus was inconsistent.  Sometimes it would focus and
sometimes it wouldn't.

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  So, uh, after my second roll of film, I, I took two rolls before I got,
decided, uh, because I changed the first roll out before I had the first one
developed --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and after I got the first roll back, I knew the camera wasn't it.  So --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- I, uh, I took it back and returned it, but most, I don't know, I haven't
had to return a lot of stuff.

A.29:  Well, did they give you any back, any problem or they just give you a new
one or what?

B.30:  Well, I took it back, and I figured it was, I don't know, something like an
auto focus, and I figured something inherent in the camera design or
something, #you know# --

A.31:  #Um.#

B.32:  -- because my dad has a, has an auto focus camera, and it works great, and
he's never had any problems with it.  In fact, he's, he's had a couple of
them.  And this was like a little small one, you know --

A.33:  Yeah, right.

B.34:  -- and the new smaller cameras are all mass produced and stuff, so they're
not, uh, I think they're, uh, I would think there's, there's better quality
control on those things, you know, just because they're small and stamped and
there's not very sophisticated --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- so, I guess not call it quality control, but, you know, since they're so
generic, they wouldn't, uh, there's, you know.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  I, I, my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good
pictures [laughter].

A.39:  Yeah, right.

B.40:  So I just said well, hell with it, I'll just go out and get a nice camera.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  But, uh, so I took it back, and, uh, I bought a, I bought a more expensive
camera.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  But, you know, I think when, uh, when I was in college, I was always buying
like just cheap stuff --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- stuff that would make do, and that's the kind of stuff I took back --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- because you bring it home, you're like, this sucks, [laughter] you know.

A.49:  Yeah, if you go and buy something really good, usually it is, it's good,
you know.

B.50:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.51:  And you don't ever, anyhow, I've never had any problems in returning
anything --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- that I've bought that I feel that, you know, was worth the money that
you --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- paid for it.

B.56:  Yeah, and I think, uh, the way I was raised, my parents always, uh, used to
buy stuff that had a good quality name on it, and, you know, they knew the
quality of it before they bought it.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  So.  I don't know.  And I kind of do the same thing, I guess.  So I haven't
had to return a lot.  If I had had to return it, it's more because I realize I
didn't need it or, you know, not because it's defective --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- but, uh, more because, uh, you know, I had the option to take it back,
and I really didn't need it, you know --

A.61:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.62:  -- rather than, you know, something --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- being broken.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  So, that's, that's the only thing I've returned recently. 

A.67:  Yeah, I, I've been really lucky, knock on wood, you know, like I say, that
I haven't had to return anything, except this, this table when it came out --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- the top of it was marked, and so --

B.70:  Um.

A.71:  -- all I did was replace the top of it, you know.

B.72:  Did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the
store?

A.73:  They, they gave me, well, no, I didn't go to the store and get it.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  They, you know, got with the manufacturer and then when it came in, then
they brought it out and then just took this table top off --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- and replaced with the other table top.

B.78:  Yeah, because I bought some furniture where the top was scratched --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and, uh, I just wrote a letter to the manufacturer, well, they, they had
a warranty sheet, saying if you have any damage, send this in.  So I sent it
in, and, uh, you know, I didn't really think much, the table, I guess the
table was scratched --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- on the top, and, uh, I didn't really, it didn't really bother me,
because it was kind of small.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  But I went ahead and sent something in, and, uh, three or four weeks later
they sent me a brand new table top [laughter] --

A.85:  (( )).

B.86:  -- and it came by truck, #and, uh# --

A.87:  #Uh-huh.#

B.88:  -- I, it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for
the table top itself, because, uh, it was eighty-five dollars for shipping.

A.89:  Oh, really.

B.90:  It was, it was like a computer table --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- you know, made with just like, uh, uh, what do they call it, pressed
wood or whatever --

A.93:  Yeah, with --

B.94:  -- particle board.

A.95:  -- or with a veneer top or something --

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  -- like that probably, yeah.

B.98:  And, uh, the whole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- and they spent eighty-five [laughter] dollars shipping this top back to
me.

A.101:  Oh, for crying out loud.

B.102:  So, I was kind of surprised.  I figured, you know, I sent that in, maybe
they would send me something back saying, you know, uh, do you want to
exchange it or bring it in or send it back, or something like that.

A.103:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.104:  But, uh, I couldn't believe they sent, actually sent a brand new one, and
they, no calls, no letters, nothing.  They just sent it to me.

A.105:  Just sent it to you.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  That's weird [laughter].

B.108:  [Laughter].

A.109:  You'd think that they would have wrote a letter or at least a telephone
call --

B.110:  Yeah, yeah.

A.111:  -- you know, telling you that is what was happening, you know.

B.112:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah but,

A.113:  But, um.

B.114:  Oh, well.  #But.#

A.115:  #But,# um.

B.116:  I'd say that's a kind of a short topic this time [laughter].

A.117:  Yeah, I was just, I was just trying to think of, um, what else have I
bought.  The only other thing that when we moved in this house, it was a new
house, and the grate where you have your fireplace,

B.118:  Right.
