REMARKS:        A lot of static on the tape throughout the
conversation.

========================================================================

A.1:  Well, the topic is, is very apropos to what's going on.  Uh, how do you
feel about our topic?

B.2:  Well, I feel like, uh, I do feel like we pay a lot of taxes.  I don't mind
paying a lot of taxes if the ta-, taxes are spent well.

@A.3:   Yes.  

B.4:  But, uh, I'm not convinced that they're being spent well.

A.5:  #Uh,# 

B.6:  #Uh,# 

A.7:  I think that's because, uh, it's like I told someone the other day, I'm a
housewife and, uh, among, uh, working mother, too, and I know how it is to
live on a budget --

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  -- and I hear what you're saying.  

B.10:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.11:  You know, our taxes, it's nice to see them spent for things that benefit
the community, but when we see them wasted, that's when we think we're paying
too much.

B.12:  Well, I feel, I, I mean one of the things is when i-, it, it's not going,
it's going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- and not going into a lot of infrastructure things, uh -- 

A.15:  Um.  

B.16:  -- or, or, uh, you know, social needs that, that it could.  I mean, when
you look at the pie, it's, uh, where our money is spent, it's, it's, uh, very,
very, uh, skewed.

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  And, uh, [breathing], so I don't feel like, I, I just don't feel like
they're doing what I would do with it.

A.19:  [Laughter].  

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Well, I think, uh, in a way that's, that's, uh, almost off our topic in,
you know, in that, uh, they didn't want us to talk about how it was spent, but
I don't think you can separate it.  I know, uh, I felt very fortunate once
when I talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes [inhaling] are
at least fifty percent.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  And, uh, in talking to people I've met from other places, uh, we do seem to
get off light except, you know, if you ever make money one year now, you pay
all this horrible taxes and you don't get to keep any of it [laughter].

B.24:  Well, but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services.

A.25:  (( )).

B.26:  They have national health, so, you know --

A.27:  Oh, yeah.  

B.28:  -- in other words, yes, that's why I say,

A.29:  In the other countries.  

B.30:  Yeah, so I'm saying if we did, I wouldn't mind paying what we pay --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- or even more if I got a lot of [laughter] stuff back -- 

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  -- for it.  But I,

A.35:  Well, on national health, so many of them can't use it they say because
they never can get in to see their doctors.

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  At least in England.

B.38:  We hear that here, uh, some --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- although we get some people who, obviously, don't want it, like --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- like rich doctors [laughter] -- 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- who, who'd rather us not have it, I think, but I don't know, I, I just,
and local taxes, uh, I think are probably just about the same.  You know, the
s-, the school taxes and all of that.

A.45:  Um.

B.46:  Income, of course, is not a, a topic in, in Texas yet, but I'm --

A.47:  Oh but,   

B.48:  -- sure it's coming.  

A.49:  Yeah, I hope not, but, I don't see any way out of it --

B.50:  No.  

A.51:  -- unless we start cutting some spending drastically.  

B.52:  That's true.  I've lived in, uh, states where they had income tax and you,
you know, and you just get used to it.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  But, uh, a-, again, uh, it just depends on what they're, what it's being
spent on.

A.55:  Course, I, I think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is
because if you don't, uh, buy, and participate you don't have to, have to pay
it.

B.56:  Um.  

A.57:  And, uh, that way, people who use the facilities and live outside of the
area, basically help pay some of the upkeep for it.

B.58:  Yeah, and sometimes, and sometimes I think it does work that way.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  Uh, but they, you know, a-, again, it's, it's, y-, you, you have the
different kind of taxes, then, then, then what are they being used for, and
who is deciding what they are being used for.

A.61:  And how much is spent to administra-, administrate them [laughter].

B.62:  Right [laughter].  

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  All those people are doing all those things and, and, and I know that the
stories, I mean I personally know people who have been in this place where,
you know, they, they're having trouble paying their taxes and --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- they, uh, like you would with a bank, you know, go into the I R S and
say, you know, you can, you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- or give me, you know, let me pay this out and you'll get it all --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- and they'll say, no, you know.  

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  And I think, n-, wait a minute, that was my money you [laughter] said no
with.

A.73:  That's right.  

B.74:  W-, w-, where you're not going to get it all.

A.75:  #Yeah.#

B.76:  #Uh,#  

A.77:  And one of the things that makes it so hard on these people, they slap so
much penalty and interest on it --

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  -- that they can triple it in nothing flat.

B.80:  Yeah, I mean, it's the one place that there's no recourse at all --

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  -- and a lot of people aren't trying to get out of it, but trying to figure
a way to live and pay it back --

A.83:  Right.  

B.84:  -- and they just, they don't accept that at all so,

A.85:   Uh-huh.
