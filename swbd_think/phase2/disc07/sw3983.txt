========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Um, what type of magazines do you have?

@B.2:  We take several at home.  I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE, and I take, uh,
DISCOVER magazine, and also, uh, C D AND STEREO REVIEW --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, I think --

A.5:  Oh, (( )).

B.6:  -- and BOYS LIFE [laughter].

A.7:  Oh, good.  That's a good one, I like to get [laughter].  Um, so I take it
that you like to ski.  Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on
skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?

B.8:  I presume that I do.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do
get things --

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  -- from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.

A.13:  Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that, do you think
or,

B.14:  [Breathing] Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski
show or something, but --

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  -- um, [smack] {sound made with mouth} I just enjoy reading about the
resorts and where you can go and,

A.17:  [Throat_clearing].

B.18:  and new equipment that's come out and so forth.  Some fashions --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- are always in there too.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  So would this vacation you're taking, did you receive information
from your skiing magazine?

B.22:  Probably not.  Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one, and we just
started looking around.  I may have referred to a couple of them, but we went
to the ski show and looked at all of the --

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  -- resort information, picked up a lot of brochures --

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  -- and just decided to go to Crested Butte.  We haven't been there before.

A.27:  Um, that sounds nice.

B.28:  Kind of away from the crowd --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- is why we chose that one.  It's --

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  -- supposedly low lift lines.  But I haven't skied Utah yet, but I want to.

A.33:  Oh, well, you need to come out [laughter].

B.34:  I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and some of those.  I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.

A.37:  Deer Valley, uh-huh.  Yeah, they are, it's wonderful snow [laughter].

B.38:  Well, how about you, what, what magazines do you have at home?

A.39:  Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,
and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and then we have some church
magazines, but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.  I'm heavy into
woodworking and tole painting and things like that, so --

B.40:  Oh, okay.

A.41:  -- the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.

B.42:  Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?

A.45:  Uh-huh, they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,
but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you
can make yourself, and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that
you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the
tole paintings, and so, it's really a fun one.  I like that.

B.46:  Well, that's good.  It's good to get use out of one.  

A.47:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.48:  [Throat_clearing] I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC, I mean, I read it, but then they just sort of gather dust for a --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- long period of time, but then eventually there'll be a school project or
something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues
to find --

A.51:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.52:  -- you know, France or something or whatever it is --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- he's looking for.

A.55:  Yes.  I've, I've noticed that, too, but they have been nice to have around.
Every once in a while they come in handy [throat_clearing].

B.56:  I used to take SMITHSONIAN --

A.57:  Oh.

B.58:  -- too, I liked that magazine --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading
it.

A.61:  Oh.  Uh.

B.62:  You get so many coming in, and by the time the next round comes in I'm
still not through reading [laughter] the first round.

A.63:  Oh, that.

B.64:  Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot, and that's --

A.65:  Oh.

B.66:  -- mostly my son's, but --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- but I do read it, too.

A.69:  Oh, well that sounds like.

B.70:  And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things --

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  -- that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles
and things like that --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- he likes to try that, so.  He does, uh,  [throat_clearing] does get to
be a lot of paper though, after a while [laughter] --

A.77:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.78:  -- if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.

A.79:  They do, they can do that.  I found that they've been fun for my little
girls, they're five and four years old, and #they like to go through and,#

B.80:  #Oh, yeah, they're just kind of# getting started now.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  [laughter] They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on,
and so we've found good use for those.

B.82:  Mine is a senior in high school, so he's, we're kind of at the end of that
trail.

A.83:  Oh.

B.84:  You're just --

A.85:  Oh.

B.86:  -- sort of beginning --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- to think about first grade.

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  Yeah, it's fun.  Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too, so --

B.92:  Oh, okay, so you got a little bit of a gap there between,

A.93:  -- so we're kind of running the gamut [laughter].  Yeah.
