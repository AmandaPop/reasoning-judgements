A.1:  Okay, um, have you had any experience in trying to find child care?

B.2:  Um, yes, somewhat.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

@B.4:  Um, we do babysitting here, like my neighbor and I share babysitting --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and, um, then I ran a preschool, so I know, you know, from the other end
--

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- you know, trying to help people find --

A.9:  Really.

B.10:  -- find day care.  So, yeah.

A.11:  Okay.

B.12:  So what about you?

A.13:  Well, I've done more or less the same.  We have five children, and, um --

B.14:  Goodness [laughter].

A.15:  -- uh, yeah, [laughter] I just haven't found it equitable to work outside
the home, and so --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- I have done the day care inside my home.

B.18:  How has that worked out?

A.19:  Well, I've done it for seven years --

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  -- and, uh, it's pretty well driven me crazy [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter] I can imagine.  I've got three kids, and I think, I mean, it's,
sometimes it's easier, like last week my husband was gone, and I had my three
nieces and nephews over --

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  -- and it was really much more calm than --

A.25:  Oh, was it, oh.

B.26:  -- than having just my three at home.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But.

A.29:  That's true.  Sometimes they,

B.30:  [Throat_clearing].  

A.31:  do offer a, just a play time for your kids.

B.32:  Yeah, it, it depends though it,

A.33:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.34:  depends on how well behaved [laughter] --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- the other kids are.  

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  Yeah, we have some times that like, oh, if I can only get these kids, um,
hang on just a second.

A.39:  Okay.

B.40:  [Child_talking] Um, okay, just a second, I'm on the phone.  Yeah, I've got
three preschoolers.

A.41:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].

B.42:  But, uh, [throat_clearing] yeah, I mean, I think it's, we've wanted to do,
I've wanted to join a babysitting co-op --

A.43:  Oh.

B.44:  -- and, um, that's, we, there're several of them around here.  Um, the one
my, my sister-in-law is in, you have to be recommended into the co-op.

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  You know, that way someone knows you, and you --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- just aren't giving your kids out to anybody.  

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And I just haven't found one that's --

A.51:  Oh.

B.52:  -- close enough to me that I feel comfortable with --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- at this point.  Um, but, because, I mean, you don't want, you don't want
to leave with your kids with anybody.

A.55:  No, no, you don't.

B.56:  And, um, the day care centers around here, I really, my kids go to
preschool, and I have found some really good ones --

A.57:  Oh, good.

B.58:  -- um, one of them goes two days a week and the other one goes one day a
week, and --

A.59:  Oh, how fun.

B.60:  -- that's a nice break, and, [throat_clearing] it's, this is a, I really
like the one that, that they're in.  Um, they've got some really qualified
teachers there.  They've been there for a long, long time.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  They've got, um, a certified kindergarten teacher doing the curriculum --

A.63:  Oh, good.

B.64:  -- for the older, you know, the fours and the --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- three year olds and stuff.  So that's, that is really good.  I really
like that.

A.67:  That would be fun, yeah.  That's good for the kids and then it's fun for
you, too, to have that little break during the week [laughter].

B.68:  Yeah, I like [laughter] that, I like that little break.  Oh.

A.69:  Oh.  Now on that co-op, um, do women just trade babysitting or.

B.70:  You, you start out with like coupons --

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  -- and, um, I don't, I think, I think you start out like with say twenty or
thirty, and, and you have to, um, when, when you babysit somebody, they pay
you in coupons, and then, um, they, uh, then you pay the other people with
coupons.

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  And I think, some of them, is, in like thirty minute time slots --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- or in hour time slots --

A.77:  Oh, gosh.

B.78:  -- and you have to do it, you know, per child, um, at least the ones that
I've seen that have worked.  And then they normally get together like once a
month and, um, you know, decide, you know, how many do you have --

A.79:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and then, they say, okay, you need to, you know, if you're taking in a
lot of babysitting, and you're not, you know, doling it out also, then, um, a
lot of times they'll say, okay, you need to, you know, you need to let people
sit for you --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- um, that way it'll even out --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- you know, some people aren't getting, you know, without, they don't have
any more coupons left --

A.85:  Oh, my goodness.

B.86:  -- and, um, their monthly meetings, I went to, I went to one --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- and they, a lot of times they'll have, um, special people come and talk
about, say safety, or, you know, different things with, about children, and
sometimes they'll just have get togethers, you know, even, even with the kids
--

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- like during the day and stuff, so it gets them, helps them to know one
another --

A.91:  Oh.

B.92:  -- and then it can be pretty informative also.

A.93:  Well, that sounds like a terrific idea.

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  My goodness.  I haven't heard of anything like that out here in Utah, and
it sounds like that'd be something good to start.  Huh.

B.96:  Yeah, I, that's, I don't know all the, um, I don't know all the details,
um, I, I, I don't know if, it seems like, it seems like her, my
sister-in-law's, uh, they are,
