========================================================================

A.1:   Well, Liz, what sort of things have you had to return lately
because of poor quality?  

B.2:   Well, I was just thinking about that.  I really haven't, uh,
I haven't had to take anything back that there was poor quality. 
I took something back that, that wasn't quite what I thought it
was.  Uh, you know, some o-, some, i-, I had even called my
brother, this was a, uh, back when the win-, uh, you know, when the
winter was so bad -- 

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   -- and, uh, I wanted a vaporizer and, uh, I had the right
brand and it said a lot of the right things on it, but then it
wasn't exactly the right one.  I had to take that back, but there
was nothing wrong with it.  

A.5:   Yeah.  

B.6:   Have you had much trouble with products?  

A.7:   Well, I had an interesting experience with a sweater at
Christmas time.  My mother got me two turtleneck sweaters.  

B.8:   Uh-huh.  

A.9:   One red one and one black one and I wore the red one and it
was fine and I got, I was in a hurry one morning to go to work, I
threw on the black sweater with this suit and I wasn't paying
attention.  I was stuck in a meeting all day with a z-, zipper that
was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too short
[laughter].  

B.10:   Oh, yuck.  

A.11:   And I was in this meeting all day long [laughter].  

B.12:   Oh, how awful and uncomfortable.  

A.13:   Yes, it was.  

B.14:   And they were both the same make and everything?  

A.15:   Yes, same make, same size, same style, everything.  

B.16:   Oh, that is frustrating.  Did they take it back?  

A.17:   Yes, as a matter of fact, I took it back Saturday to
Dillard's.  My mother bought it at Dillard's in Las Cruces, New
Mexico.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  

A.19:   And I took it to the local Dillard's and said, you know,
there's something with this sweater, these sleeves are definitely
two inches shorter [laughter].  

B.20:   [Laughter]. 

A.21:   I'm very tall and have long arms, so -- 

B.22:   Yeah.  

A.23:   -- sleeve length is critical [laughter].  

B.24:   And they were willing to take it back?  

A.25:   Yes.  

B.26:   Yeah, uh, you know, now that you mention that, I was thinking
of h-, of, more of, you know, kitchen kind of products or, or
whatever and I, I, uh, bought the silk shirts that The Limited had
and I just loved them and, and I bought one out of town and, you
know, at the time I just said, could I return it someplace else,
you know, at another Limited, they said yes,

A.27:   [Noise].

B.28:   and the silk comes, I mean, it's, I d-, am finding it
amazing that you can just put silk in the washing machine but,  

A.29:   [Laughter]. 

B.30:   nonetheless, so, I mean, it's, so it's sort of like a
little miracle anyway, but it pulled i-, you know, in the facing,
in the, uh, wh-, the [lipsmack], where the buttons and the
buttonholes are.  

A.31:   Oh. 

B.32:   It just, the silk just pulled out and I'm a little self
conscious about being overweight so, you know, I kept thinking
maybe it's my fault, I'm stretching it except the thing just hangs
around my body, [laughter] you know.  

A.33:   [Laughter]. 

B.34:   So I, I took it back and they just, without question, let me
get another one and now this other one's doing it, too, and I think
what they're doing is not using enough material right there at that
seam -- 

A.35:   Yeah.  

B.36:   -- so that, you know, it just pulls apart.  But I'm not sure
that I think, I don't know, do you think things are worse quality
now than they used to be or,

A.37:   Oh, I think some things are.  Clothing definitely.  

B.38:   Uh-huh.  

A.39:   It seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent
clothing.  

B.40:   Yeah.  

A.41:   And, but then other things like, oh, blue jeans [laughter],
you know -- 

B.42:   Yeah.  

A.43:   -- always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough.  

B.44:   See-, seem to [laughter], not, just sort of be unchanging?  

A.45:   Yes.  

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   Yes -- 

B.48:   Yeah.  

A.49:   -- but I think anytime you get into high style items, things
that change all the time that, uh, think it gets, it's tougher for
them to maintain the quality.  

B.50:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.51:   Course, if you listen to the Japanese politicians we're,

B.52:   [Laughter]. 

A.53:   [Laughter] going in the ditch for quality and productivity
and everything else.  

B.54:   Yeah, well, course, uh, stuff comes from all over, too, so,
uh, and I was just thinking about that, of, of the things that
I've, that I've, uh, bought recently, I'd, I'm a little worried
about those long items.  I just had to buy a new washing machine
and, uh, the one I had was twenty, one --

A.55:   Um.

B.56:   -- twenty-two years old.  N-, no, no, no, no, it was more like
twenty-four years old and just had, just gone on beautifully the
whole time till the end it finally gave up and I had to, I think
maybe repaired once,

A.57:   [Laughter].  

B.58:   in all those years, you know.  

A.59:   So, did you buy the same brand the next time?  

B.60:   Well, I, d-, still, I mean, obviously, that what you think
about doing.  It was a, it was a Kenmore and, uh, I, so I thought
about that and then went and found out, y-, well, you know, this
company and this company's bought and all the compan-, all the
washing machines are made by the same company.

A.61:   [Laughter].

B.62:   Something like that, with different names.  

A.63:   Yeah.  

B.64:   And I said, well, no way.  

A.65:   [Laughter]. 

B.66:   [Laughter] Y-, what do you mean, they're all, I mean, why
would they make them, why would they make different ones in
different names if it's the same company making them.  I, I found
that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things
that have been lasting, my refrigerator, the dryer, the dryer's
still going.
