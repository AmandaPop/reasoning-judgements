============================================================

B.1:  Okay [laughter].  

A.2:  Okay [laughter].  

B.3:  Have you done this very long?  

A.4:  Uh, well, yeah, for the last, uh, couple of months.  

B.5:  Yeah, that's the same with us.  

A.6:  Yeah.  

B.7:  Well, what kind of car would you buy?  

@A.8:  Well, it's kind of hard to say, uh, because I don't think we're going to
buy another car for about three years.  We just --

B.9:  Oh, okay.  

A.10:  -- bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine --

B.11:  O-,   

A.12:  -- and, uh, wait a minute, we bought one in ninety.  We've got [laughter]
three cars, of all things.

B.13:  Uh-huh.  

A.14:  So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan.

B.15:  Okay.  What kind do you have now?  

A.16:  Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a
little two seater C R X.

B.17:  Oh, okay.  

A.18:  Uh, [breathing] it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,
we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh,
report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have --

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  -- and then, of course, we look into the prices.  

B.21:  Yeah.  

A.22:  And, uh, f-, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when
the cars could get to be discounted because we keep, we've begun to keep them,
uh, long-, a longer period of time.  Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile
for the eighty-nine Mazda.

B.23:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.24:  So, uh,

B.25:  And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?

A.26:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,
and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars.

B.27:  Uh-huh.  

A.28:  And, uh, they, they, uh, I've been extremely, we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.

B.29:  Oh, really?  

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.

A.32:  Yeah, well, we, we've had, uh, let's see, we had, uh, we had a, uh, let me
think.  {pause} We had a fifty-three and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes
which is a long thirty minute story [laughter].

B.33:  [Laughter]. 

A.34:  Uh, and we had a sixty-five and then we had this eighty-two. 

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really.

B.37:  Yeah, we've been real pleased with ours.  I think we've had, one, two,
three --

A.38:  Yeah.  

B.39:  -- and most, we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is
like, a seventy-seven.

A.40:  Uh-huh.  

B.41:  Then we have a Cutlass Sierra and we've had the ninety-eight. 

A.42:  Uh-huh.  

B.43:  So, but I don't know, we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car,
probably in the next year and [breathing], the financing is always something
we consider, you know, the four percent or when they --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- give good financing through the, the motor company.  

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  But, I don't know what we're going to buy.  I always thought I would like
to try a foreign made car, but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off,
makes me feel guilty [laughter].

A.48:  [Laughter] Well -- 

B.49:  So,   

A.50:  -- uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mad-, Mazdas
and Volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in
getting the Mazdas.

B.51:  Oh. 

A.52:  Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M
G B.

B.53:  Oh the,

A.54:  Was British gr-, racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a
soft top.

B.55:  Ooh, boy.  

A.56:  And, uh, I drove it mostly. 

B.57:  I'll bet -- 

A.58:  And,    

B.59:  -- it was hard to part with that.  

A.60:  Yeah, it really was.  My husband was in the Air Force and we got
transferred to Okinawa.

B.61:  Oh. 

A.62:  So, uh, we had to sell it.  W-, which really tore me up [laughter].

B.63:  Oh, yeah.  

A.64:  Because, uh, it, it w-, it was great fun.  And then, uh, when we got to
Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand, we, uh, we decided that, uh, we had
this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile and it, and it was just too big, so we, we
sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little
Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.

B.65:  Oh.
