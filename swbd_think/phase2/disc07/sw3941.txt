to understand, he stammered a lot.

============================================================

A.1:   Okay, you think health benefits probably the, the most
important?  

B.2:   Yes, for, because most people are a-, getting older and the,
ben-, uh, benefits are going, uh, I mean the price is going up.  

A.3:   That's #true.#  


B.4:   #Everything# seems to go [laughter] up.  

A.5:   That's, that's the case, or the problem I have.  I'm getting
older and, uh, the wife and, uh, we, use the doctors more, have, uh,
more, more health --


B.6:   [noise]

A.7:   -- problems and that is a very important benefit that, uh ... 

B.8:   Yeah, see, w-, well, here where I live, all the benefits have
been going up lately, up, on health -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- and the hospitals have, we have a one cent tax and then,
now Bush is coming up with this health plan, so, I don't know much
about it, then.  

A.11:   No, I, I haven't studied really that too much, but, uh, that
is one of the benefits that, uh, [cough] that I feel that, uh, is
real good with, uh, the company I work for so far, but, uh, it,
it's, uh, you know what's going to happen, the costs keep going up
as you say and it's, uh -- 

B.12:   Yes.  

A.13:   -- it could wipe a, a family out or, uh, all your savings and
everything, one, one serious illness.  

B.14:   Yeah, one illness will do it.  

A.15:   I think that's, uh, one of the benefits that we really need
to, or companies n-, really need to take a look at because there's
so many Americans that are not covered at all.  It's, uh, quite a
situation.  I think the other thing, uh, security and that, that's
getting pretty tough now, a, a job with security.  

B.16:   Yes.  

A.17:   Uh, especially if you're in the department of defense or you're
in the auto industry.  Been working for fifteen or twenty years and
all of a sudden, uh, because of changes in Europe, this, uh, h-,
holidays so many people are losing their jobs and, uh, I don't know
how you can, as a benefit, how you could have security as one, but
most people like to have that security in their jobs.  

B.18:   Yeah, I, I would think so.  But that's one of the main, I
would think, one of the main securities that you would need -- 

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   -- is health benefits.  

A.21:   I'll say.  Yeah, it really is, and, uh, it's, uh, you really
feel sorry for those who don't have it or they have, uh, uh, cancer
or something real serious that, uh, c-, runs up, or a trans-, a
heart transplant or something runs up into, uh, [cough] hundreds of
thousands of dollars. 

B.22:   Yes.  

A.23:   And that could wipe you out in a hurry.   

B.24:   Well, we, I have, my sister died, she had some benefits that
helped through her, well, they had her hooked up and everything,
but that helped her --

A.25:   #Good.#

B.26:   -- #helped# us through it.  

A.27:   Good, a good thing that, uh, uh, she had those.  I think
there's other, uh, well, there's other benefits that, uh, kind of
look at.  I guess, uh, need a vacation once in a while.  Most 
jobs -- 

B.28:   Really?  

A.29:   -- will, uh, give you some time off and, uh, that's something
that, uh, each company's a little different on that, but most of
them are pretty good on those, uh, those type of benefits.  

B.30:   #Uh-huh.#

A.31:   #I think# ... 

B.32:   Just, just with the benefits going up it's just, there's not
a whole lot you can do about it, really.  

A.33:   No, there isn't and, uh, another one I think is, uh, quite
important, of course, is retirement system that, uh, they have.  

B.34:   Yes.  

A.35:   And, uh, with Social Security and, uh, the way it is, if
that's all you got is Social Security, by the ...  

B.36:   You're not going make it very far.  

A.37:   Right, by the time I get up there, uh, in a few years, and,
uh, draw Social Security, with the cost of living, uh, that benefit
is just really not going to help very much.  

B.38:   No, I don't think that would [laughter].  

A.39:   [laughter] 

B.40:   Uh, the older, the older probably, you would probably need
more help.  

A.41:   Uh-huh.  

B.42:   Because, you know, a lot of el-, most of the elderly people
don't have the money -- 

A.43:   No.  

B.44:   -- and the ones that do, well, they have insurance, so ...   

A.45:   Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.46:   It's just a, I think that they need to extend them because
we're, we're paying here a lot.  

A.47:   Uh-huh.  

B.48:   And -- 

A.49:   Yeah.   

B.50:   -- I think the elderly needs it more than #anything.#  

A.51:   #[cough]# That's true and, uh, it seems like it goes up every
year.  You have no control over the, the cost to you and that just
takes away your buying power also.  And, uh, the company, of
course, I can see the company's side, uh, too, because, uh, they
have to pay, uh, an, a proportion of whatever the, the health cost
is -- 

B.52:   Yeah.  

A.53:   -- and it gets to the point where, uh, they're not, uh, making
money and, uh, it, uh, I don't want to see us to go socialized
medicine like they are in England or places like that.  

B.54:   No.  

A.55:   But, still, uh, I, I hope that this plan that, uh, the
President's come up with, uh, is going to help all those, or help
some way.  Bottom line, though, who's going to pay for it.  

B.56:   Really.  

A.57:   [laughter]

B.58:   Have they got, have they already signed that, or that's #not
signed yet, is it.#  

A.59:   #No, no, he, he# just, uh, proposed it and, uh, the Republicans
are saying, hey, it's a great plan, the Democrats say it's no good,
so ...  

B.60:   Well, they ...
