===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what do you think about how we've changed in the last ten, twenty
years?

@B.2:  I think it's pretty amazing.  I think, um, that my grandparents,
especially, have seen a whole lot of change in their lives, but, uh.

A.3:  And in, like in what ways particularly are you thinking?

B.4:  Well, technology, but also mor-, morals and things like that.

A.5:  #Uh-huh.#

B.6:  #I think even,# even in the last like four years you can still see things
falling so fast, and that can be, for me, that's the biggest change.  It's so
frustrating, um, to see everything --

A.7:  Disintegrating?

B.8:  -- disintegrating and losing con-, your, your losing control it seems like
of the moral fiber of our society.

A.9:  Yeah, it seems that way, it, its a, seems like it's definitely a
transitional time.  I'm not sure exactly what's happening.  There're good
things that have happened, but, but at the moment we're suffering from, I
think, information overload for one thing.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  Uh, just, just the technology like you mentioned.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Faxes and car phones and [laughter] V C R -s and all of that that make us
so immediate.  There, there's no time for relationships, talking, sitting,
being with each other, all of that.

B.14:  I think you're really right.  I think like, well even with computers, um --

A.15:  Oh, yes [laughter].

B.16:  -- you can, there, I mean, there's so much that's happening in, in that
field, and it, it just has forced us to go so fast, and, um, even the way we
write, it used to be if you read a book like, you know, Thomas Hardy --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- he takes two chapters to establish the mood and, and just describes the
scenery and what's been going on and stuff, and now we just chop all that out
and say, well let's get to the point and.

A.19: [Laughter]  Exactly, no patience --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- no attention span --

B.22:  Yeah, exactly.

A.23:  -- (( )) you're exactly right.  I mean, all, there's all that, and then
we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer, with,
with, you know, with, with little hope of, of having any impact.  I think
impotence is a, is a word that, that suits most of America now.  We don't feel
like we can in-, influence anything.

B.24:  Yeah, you feel out of control.

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Like just a few people have it all wrapped up --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and they're not going to let you through, #um# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- and it's a bad feeling.

B.32:  Yeah, it is, it's really frustrating, and the way our families, you know,
our nuclear families are disintegrating --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and stuff, it's just a real.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  You don't have the, the social networks we used to have #to# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#  Go ahead.

B.38:  -- to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things
like that, with everyone moving, you know, every five years.

A.39:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.40:  You lose your contacts, you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do
things.  You know, in America it seems now, it's independence is the thing,
and, you know, heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything --

A.41:  Yeah (( )).

B.42:  -- whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other
and you'll help me and I'll help you, not, and not in this corruptive sense,
but in the sense of, you know, when you're in trouble and you need so-, you
know, someone to babysit the kids, sure.

A.43:  Uh-huh, the in-, interdependence in a --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- nice way.

B.46:  Exactly.

A.47:  Yeah, I think, uh, I, I don't know, there was a lot, there was good and bad
in the nuclear family, we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it
--

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- but, but the community, however the family looked, and it didn't always
look like a nuclear family, even then --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- you know, you had generations living together or, you know, whatever,
community has just definitely been lost, and I think a lot of people are
trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways, um, you know, well,
okay, so we don't have a small town, and okay, so we move, but, you know,
maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together, you know,
everything from people who do live in communal, you know, almost commune areas
that they've started up again, you know, special cities or little towns that
do that, to people who do it through a church or through a book club or some-,
I mean, something --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- you know, even offices have started sort of becoming the community.

B.54:  Yeah, I think, I think because #it's a necessity# --

A.55:  #[Cough]# yeah.

B.56:  -- as, as, as human beings we need a network around us of people we can
rely on.

A.57:  Uh-huh #and, yeah.#

B.58:  #(( ))# thing is that right now it's such a, um, temporary thing that how
far does it go, how far can you depend on them, and --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- they're so much more fragile at the touch, you know.

A.61:  Yeah, and that's a good point, and, and we don't have the inter
generational community either, which means that do you, do you have to be
between twenty and forty to be accepted, and if,
