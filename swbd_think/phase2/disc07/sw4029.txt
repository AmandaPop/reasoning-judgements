A.1:  Nancy.  What kind of a personal computer do you have?

@B.2:  Uh, we still have an old, uh, Texas Instruments Professional Computer,
back in the days when T I was making, uh, computers that were similar to, in
terms of power, to the I B M.  I don't remember what those were, the A T -s or
something like that.

A.3:  Something like that, yeah, I have one of those, too [laughter].

B.4:  Way back when.  I don't know where to get any new software for it
[laughter] unfortunately, so we just sort of stumble on, using, the same stuff
that we always have.

A.5:  Yeah.  Do you use computers at work or,

B.6:  Uh, well, I used to.  I have a Master's Degree --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- in computer science --

A.9:  #So do I.#

B.10:  -- #but I haven't,# I took a time out on careers about six years ago when
my first one turned a year old.

A.11:  I see.

B.12:  So, nowadays I'm teaching him at home, and we're using the computer to
drill him on math, and to let him do some creative writing without having to
have, uh, uh, the mechanics of handwriting get in the way of his words.  This
way he can, this way he just has to hunt and [laughter] peck on the keyboard.

A.13:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.14:  I have to admit I'd like a, a more logical arrangement of the letters, and,
uh, what do they call it, the Cortiope or something --

A.15:  Something like that.

B.16:  -- arrangement.

A.17:  Uh, do you use your computer for other things, balancing checkbooks, do you
keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or,

B.18:  Uh, we haven't for, we ended up, uh, actually just sort of keeping it in
the closet for a number [laughter] of years.  Isn't that a terrible statement.
People who are, we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other
aspects, but, um, I guess I wanted something that was easier to use than this,
and that was more intuitive and so we just, it just ended up not, not getting
used.  I should use it to balance my checkbook.

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  But then you have to remember to write it down.

A.21:  That's right, that's right.  

B.22:  (( )).

A.23:  Well, mine kind of died, so it's being worked on right now.

B.24:  Oh, my.  Where do you find a place to work on a T I?

A.25:  I found a technician who works at T I --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and does things like that in his spare time.

B.28:  Well, that's nice to know that there are still such people around.

A.29:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I, most of the stuff I've used that computer for were
work related, just bringing work home.

B.30:  Yeah.  Well, I used to do that.  I'd used it, um, until, as I say, until I
took a hiatus from working, I used to, uh, trying to think of what you call
it.  I, I used it essentially as a terminal then --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- you know.

A.33:  Yeah, I've done a lot of that.  

B.34:  So.

A.35:  And I suspect most people do.  Uh, use them as terminals or have a
spreadsheet and a word processor, and that's about it.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  What else do you need, right?

B.38:  Well, my kids think I should have games --

A.39:  Well, that's probably true.

B.40:  -- on top of games on top of games [laughter].  

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  And of course we don't have any.  I keep telling them, well, you know, just
learn how to program [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah, write your own games, right.

B.44:  Write your own games.  Yeah, I just.

A.45:  The computer I work, have at work, came with, uh, Windows software, and it
has a couple of games --

B.46:  Oh.

A.47:  -- on it, one of which is a solitaire, just standard card solitaire.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  But the graphics are so incredible, and you can choose what you want the
deck of cards to look like, you know, you can have flowers on the back of them
or fishes or.

B.50:  Oh, really?

A.51:  Oh, yes, or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy, and
[laughter].

B.52:  [Laughter]  Oh.

A.53:  I ju-, I just happened to stumble across that.  Of course I don't play
games at work, right [laughter].

B.54:  No, who would do something like that.  But, uh, yeah, we have, basically we
use the Wordstar on it --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- you know for a bunch of, oh, I'm taking a class now, and, um, I'm
actually getting a degree in nursing at this point, and I asked the.  The
class I'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed.  Until now
everything's been handwritten.  So it was a good thing that the computer was
back up and running.

A.57:  That's right.

B.58:  Hooked the printer up to it.

A.59:  I was going to say, you must have a printer then.

B.60:  Right, [laughter] right.  Well, I couldn't figure out how to, it's been a
while since I've gotten it going, all right, so.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  I tried to hook the printer up, and I was sure I put all the connectors in
right and everything, and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing
the right way, and I couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a
printer there to save my life, and so I's like, Oh, this thing doesn't work,
and we've lost the, you know, we've lost the install software documentation,
what am I supposed to do, so, my husband took it in to,
