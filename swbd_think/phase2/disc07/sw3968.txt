=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right.  That's a real different topic.  I'm not sure I'm familiar with,
with what they mean of invasion of privacy.

A.3:  I know.  I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day
that would, you would think of about.  See, I'm a college student, so I can
think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me --

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  -- you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like
that.  But I think --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.

@B.8:  I think, personally, you know, I'm, I used to be a college student --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- ten years ago --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- but [laughter] uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone
calls me on the telephone --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.

A.15:  Oh, golly.  You're like, No, you don't, no.

B.16:  It's like, how do you know my name, where did you get my phone number, and
why do you think it's a deal for me?

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with,
try to solicit --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.

A.21:  They call late, now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to
start calling on Saturdays or some-,

B.22:  Oh, they do already.

A.23:  See, that's ridi-, I would be so mad [laughter].

B.24:  Well, and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too.

A.25:  Really.  

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.

A.29:  How?

B.30:  Don't answer your phone, Hello.  The computer's geared to, to start talking
to you on the, on the word Hello.

A.31:  Really?

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Huh.  I don't know, I think like things that, that I think's like privacy
is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like
my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.

B.34:  Oh, yeah.

A.35:  That drives me up a wall.

B.36:  Are you and your roommate a similar size.

A.37:  No, see, we're not, and, uh.

B.38:  And she still goes through your clothes?

A.39:  Yeah, she'll take all my shirts and stuff, because she can't wear like my
pants --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.

B.42:  Ooh.

A.43:  Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you
know.

B.44:  Oh, yeah.

A.45:  But still, she'll just take them, and she won't even think about it, and
then, I'll like see her that day, and she'll be wearing my clothes, and I'll
be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know, I really
don't.  So --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- I prefer that you just not go in and get them --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- because she doesn't even ask me.  Stuff like that really [laughter],
like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.

B.50:  Oh, yeah, I agree.

A.51:  Stuff like that, when you have your door closed, people just walking in and
stuff like that.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  I was thinking like my mom.  I know this, she would think this is like an
invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever
needed money and stuff --

B.54:  Oh, yeah.

A.55:  -- we always just give her her purse, you know, and she'll --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- get it out or whatever.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  I was trying to think, I was thinking that's the only thing I could really
think of that would really be.

B.60:  My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.

A.61:  Really.

B.62:  I mean, we're all grown, all her kids are grown, and we have our own
families --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you
digging for?

A.65:  [Laughter]  Yeah, get out of my cabinets.

B.66:  Like, what are you doing?  Don't you have your own house to dig through?

A.67:  [Laughter]  That's great.

B.68:  Yeah, so, I guess, privacy is really, and at the work place, I suppose, oh,
well, actually yes.  I can say definitely,

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  privacy at the work place.  

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  I hate it for people to open up my drawer --

A.73:  See.

B.74:  -- to my desk --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff, and I could tell
#I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way.#

A.77:  #You could tell, you know you put your stuff where it's,#

B.78:  #(( )).#

A.79:  #Yeah.#  That would drive, that would, that [laughter],

B.80:  It would drive, it drove me batty #for a while.#

A.81:  #Really.#

B.82:  Yeah, well, I worked a second shift --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and everybody else in my area worked first shift --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- and our shifts overlapped --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- so I would come in, and there would be people sitting at my desk,
working, and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this, it's my vitamins, I
wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is, why are they working at my desk, and
can I have it back.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  Can I have it back soon, maybe.

A.91:  Then you start missing stuff, and.

B.92:  Oh, yeah, no mommy is going to take the vitamins, I'm sorry, I have (( ))
[laughter].

A.93:  That's okay.  [laughter] See that would, that would make me really mad,
because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff, just because, I
mean, I know I have everything like a certain way --

B.94:  (( )).

A.95:  -- and you know how it looks and everything.

B.96:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know how you left it the day before.

A.97:  Uh-huh. [child_talking] [rattling] That would bother me, definitely.

B.98:  Oh, yeah, so, that's, [talking] [child_talking] [rattling] yeah, I agree,
it's, it's pretty tough that way, and, I know, even like with your school
books and papers.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  Do you miss your papers sometimes?

A.101:  See, yeah.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  You know.  That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion
of privacy, like something every day, though.

B.104:  Yeah, well, actually I do know, and I have used it once --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- and it, it really is an invasion of privacy, but in the library there's
a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they
live, #their street address.#

A.107:  #Oh, really?#

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  And that, I mean, I've, I've used it once,
