==========================================================================

A.1:  So have you had to think about, uh, nursing homes and the elderly, that
sort of thing in your own life?

@B.2:  No, not really.  My parents are still pretty young.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  My father is forty-five, mother about the same age.

A.5:  That's very young.

B.6:  Yeah, um, so it really hasn't been an issue for me.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  How about yourself?

A.9:  Uh, no, my parents are getting older.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  My father is, uh, seventy, and my mother must be about sixty five --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- so I'm starting to think about it, but I haven't had to do anything
about it yet.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  Uh, my grand-,

B.16:  Have they done anything with, uh, supplemental insurance for that or,

A.17:  No, I'm pretty sure they don't.  Um, they have some income from pensions
and social security --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- um.  But, no, I don't think they have any insurance that would cover --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- that sort of thing.

B.22:  Well, I've heard about this, uh, insurance, I was wondering, because it
seems like what I've heard is usually that (( )) is, uh, kind of thing where
they cancel you a couple of years after you get in-, into the home. So it
tends to be kind of useless anyway.

A.23:  Yeah, (( )) those costs are so high, that without something --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- you know, special, you can't handle it anyway.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  Uh --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- I mean, I think we might, uh, we talk about having them move in with us
--

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- but there are certain health --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- you know, certain health conditions --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- that we wouldn't be able to handle, and I think we've just sort of
avoided --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- thinking about it real hard.

B.38:  I know, it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically
costs you can maybe even afford to, to have a nurse come into the home
periodically.

A.39:  That might be a good alternative.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  I mean, it is my impressions, tens of thousands of #dollars.#

B.42:  #Dollars# a year, at that point, you know --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- it seems like you could hire somebody part time.

A.45:  Yeah, what the heck.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Certainly more dignified than, uh --

A.49:  Yeah --

B.50:  -- than warehousing them.

A.51:  -- it, it, it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there
and,

B.52:  Right, yeah.  It's, it's kind of scary, because it seems like, uh, you
know, a lot of people, you know have, the budgets of these places has gotten
so tight.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  And, uh, you know, they just really can't take care of them very well.  The
budget and staffing especially if it's state run.

A.55:  I saw something on SIX-, SIXTY MINUTES a few months ago about nursing homes
in Texas --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- that was a real, you know, horror piece.

B.58:  Yeah, it seems like every time I see something on television it's not good.

A.59:  Yeah, so, and I guess, you know, we have to think about, gee maybe we have
another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  Is it possible we could put away enough money to handle it ourselves.

B.62:  Yeah, it seems that way.

A.63:  Yeah, um, do you, do you have grandparents who are left?

B.64:  Yeah, I sure do.  They're, they're pretty healthy.  Everybody in my family
seems to die when they're, they're in good health, but they get to be like
seventy or eighty and all have aneurysms, just drop dead.

A.65:  Well, that's, could be worse I think.  

B.66:  Yeah, I think, you know, that's pretty good way to go.  

A.67:  If I could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead,
I'd probably.

B.68:  I'd be happy.

A.69:  Yeah, I, I think that might be, might be sufficient.

B.70:  Yeah, that's the worst part, um, seems to me, that a lot of times people
wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes, or, uh
--

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- heart attacks, that sort of thing, and then, you know, they can't really
help themselves, so they have to be #cared for.#

A.73:  #Yeah,# I mean, it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than
ever to, uh --

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  -- (( )) more support and some way to live a fulfilling life, and it
doesn't seem like those people are getting it.

B.76:  Yeah, I mean, it seems like they'd almost just doing better off just
withholding care, to some, some degree.

A.77:  Well, it's always a tough question --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- you know, I mean, with not only the elderly but sick people in general
--

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  -- you know, when do you withhold and when do you not?

B.82:  Well, it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because, you
know, at least they've lived a life and,

A.83:  You would think, yeah, I mean, you'd think, hey --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- the clock's bound to run out #at some point.#

B.86:  #Yeah, it's something,# it's something like fifty percent or greater of all
health care expenses are in the last five years of your life.

A.87:  Yeah --

B.88:  So.

A.89:  -- um, you, my wife is a nurse --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- and she tells me stories about, uh, the things that people are put
through, the so-, heroic measures they're --

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  -- put through when they're very sick.  Some of them are very old and some
aren't --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- that, uh, everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference --

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  -- but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- than everything they can do.

B.100:  Seems like, uh, unfortunately, many of those people who are put through
those, if they'd, uh, let their wishes be known ahead of time, frequently they
wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures, and --

A.101:  Yeah, my wife has --

B.102:  -- if that's the case then.

A.103:  -- certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done, and --

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  -- I just hope I can remember what they are [laughter] --

B.106:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

A.107:  -- when it comes time to deal with it.

B.108:  Well, I don't know, my wife's a medical student --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- and, uh, you know, it's a, JOURNAL OF THE A M A, and the --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- AMERICAN MEDICAL NEWS thing, and it seems like that physicians, unless
they're in writing or video tape or something --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- that they're kind of in a,
