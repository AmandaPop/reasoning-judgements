===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, Wendy, have you had any, uh, experiences with your nieces in school
to indicate that something's wrong with the school system?

@B.2:  Well, they, they don't seem to discipline the children like they used to.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Now when I was in school, I'm, I'm only twenty-nine, and I, I hadn't been
out of college that long, but when we were in grade school, we, you know, if
you got in trouble, you definitely got paddled or, you know, something,
something was done.  And now, they can't touch the children.

A.5:  Yeah.  Do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or,

B.6:  Well, it's really a combination.  The fact that so many parents refuse to
let the school discipline their children --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- and the fact that they let parents or, or people file lawsuits.

A.9:  Yes [laughter].

B.10:  For one thing, I have a friend that is a teacher in Houston, and she says
the kids can hit you, kick you, stab you, and you cannot touch them, and if
you touch them, then they can sue you --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- and they can sue the school system.

A.13:  So it's really no more a failure of society.

B.14:  I, I think so.  I think so.  And, I, you couldn't pay me enough,

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  to be a teacher in a bad, in a bad city.

A.17:  No.

B.18:  And, and, and our town, we're, you know, maybe thirty thousand people,
there's not a problem.

A.19:  I have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school [laughter].

B.20:  Oh, really?

A.21:  The stories she tells --

B.22:  Yes.

A.23:  -- oh, yes.

B.24:  It's unbelievable #the things# --

A.25:  #(( )).#

B.26:  -- and of course, the sweet little kids.

A.27:  Well, the neighborhood that she's in is, is very economically deprived, and
that is reflected in the students abilities.  I mean, they have no support at
home --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- so if you casually looked at it, you could say maybe the test scores in
that school are bad and, and therefore there's a failure of the public school
system.  But when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources
or can't even read themselves --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- that sort of thing, it, it's bound to affect the education of the
children.

B.32:  Well, yeah.  And the fact that they're not putting enough money into the
schools --

A.33:  Oh, well.

B.34:  -- you know, and they don't even have adequate facilities is.

A.35:  I just wonder where all the money goes.  I mean, my --

B.36:  Well, i-, isn't that the truth.

A.37:  -- my taxes are exorbitant, and [laughter] I, I, I don't think you solve
problems too much by throwing money at it.  I think you have to get the
parents interested and have to get the community support --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and that sort of thing.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  And, and let the schools give them a little more, you're right,
give them a little more support and a little more to work with.  And as these
ki-, you know, as the kids get older, it's, it's even harder.

A.41:  Oh, I'm sure it is --

B.42:  Yeah --

A.43:  -- I'm sure it is.

B.44:  -- because then, you know, their minds are made up as to what they're going
to do by then.

A.45:  Well, yes, and if you don't develop an interest in reading at an early age,
it gets awfully hard a lot later on.

B.46:  Oh, yeah, yeah, they see no point, you know, we've gotten away with it this
far.

A.47:  That's right, #but again# --

B.48:  #Yeah.#

A.49:  -- society's, uh, influences, I think, can affect how well the students
perform, more than the, than what the public school is or is not doing.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.

A.51:  I mean, certainly, drugs and, and peer pressures of that sort can again
make the students fail, and therefore look like that there's some-, something
deficient about the public school system.

B.52:  Yeah, and it just frightens me when I think about having a child and
sending them to school where they're, they're selling drugs --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- in, in grade school.

A.55:  Isn't that scary?

B.56:  I can't imagine.  I mean, we wouldn't even have known what they were
talking about,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  let alone take something or, you know, sell it, buy it.  I, I just can't
imagine it has, has come so far that there's little kids dealing drugs, and
older kids dealing to the little kids, and.

A.59:  That's right.  But, then, then again that's something that, that's very
difficult for the schools to try to control.

B.60:  Yes.

A.61:  This principal I know does the best she can in terms of dealing with
students, this is a grade school, students who are members of gangs.

B.62:  Oh, my goodness.

A.63:  Yes.  Students who carry weapons to school [laughter].

B.64:  Um.  And when we were little, when we went to grade school we lived in
Waxahachie.  And, little bitty town, you know, little bitty school.  And there
was, I, I, I just, [laughter] it is beyond my comprehension to imagine grade
schoolers with weapons, and, and --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- and gangs, and it's just, you might as well just have a police file on
them.

A.67:  [Laughter] That's right.

B.68:  You know, because, you know, you, you learn who the leaders are, and, you
know, what they're doing, and it's, you can't do anything to them.

A.69:  That's right, but when there are disruptive influences like that in the
school, I think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to
learn.

B.70:  It really does, because even the ones that are, that want to will let the
other ones bully them out of it.
