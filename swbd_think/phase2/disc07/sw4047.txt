==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess we're on.  Uh, capital punishment.  Uh, my, my feeling, by
the way, is that I think there is a need for capital punishment.  I don't
think it ought to be applied to every crime, obviously.  But there is a need.
How do you feel about it?

@B.2:  Oh, I believe there's, you know, there is a need for it.  Like you said,
it shouldn't be applied to every, every crime, you know.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Uh.

B.4:  Uh, I feel like, you know, they need to, instead of giving the people on
the, you know, like death row and stuff, just leaving them there and sit there
and make taxpayer pay for it, I think they ought to do something about it.

A.5:  Yeah I think it is, does get, uh, strung out too long, that they, uh, they
keep people there ten, twelve years, uh, uh, that seems to be the norm.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Um, I, I don't know how effective a deterrent it is when, when that
happens, uh, but, more and more people are being executed for crimes.  I think
down in Texas, uh, just today or yesterday, didn't you have one, an execution
down there?

B.8:  Yeah, we had, uh, one just, yeah, couple days ago.

A.9:  Yeah.  Well, they haven't executed anybody in, uh, in our state, in New
Hampshire, since I think nineteen forty-four, somewhere around that time
frame.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  It's been a long time.  We do have the death penalty, but, uh, they don't
use it very much.  Instead they sentence them to life, and, uh, we end up, as
you say, fitting, footing the bill --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- the next forty or fifty years.

B.14:  Yeah, that's what I think that they need to do something to change that,
because I don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in
the, stay in there for life, you know.

A.15:  I think one interesting question would be, uh, uh, you know, as far as
circumstances, uh, I think we agree if somebody, you know, is involved with a
premeditated murder, or, you know, a cold blooded first degree murder, they
deserve the death penalty.  That's in my opinion.  I don't know, how do you
feel about that, if they take another human life, you know, and they've,
they've planned to do this, or they're doing it for pay, don't you think that
deserves the death penalty?

B.16:  It sure does (( )).

A.17:  Now, how about drug dealers, where they don't directly take a life, you
know, it's not like they're pulling the, the, the trigger on a gun or
something like that.  What do you think about, uh, major drug dealers getting
the death penalty?

B.18:  Well, (( )) they're partly, you know, they're a lot responsible for it,
because they're the ones selling the drugs to the, to the dealers out on the
street, you know, and I think they, they need to get the capital punishment.

A.19:  I think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more
effective than for, uh, the, just the common street criminal that kills
somebody.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  That person probably isn't thinking too much about it, but these major drug
dealers, uh, you know, they got some brains.  They wouldn't be in the business
if they didn't have, and if they're threatened with the death penalty, I think
it might make a difference on them.

B.22:  Oh, yeah.  I think it would, too, you know.  Sometimes I think they ought
to just [laughter] take them out and shoot them, and then, you know.  But, uh,
that's my opinion on some of the cases --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- [Child_talking] because I think drugs is a bad deal and stuff.

A.25:  That's right.  It certainly ruins a lot of lives, whereas a, you know,
somebody that, uh, is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly
small circle of people, I mean the relatives and friends of the person that
was killed.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  But, but a drug dealer, a major drug dealer is effecting what, thousands of
lives --

B.28:  Oh, yeah.

A.29:  -- and in effect causing some of them to die.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  And, you know, it's, especially, I just saw something on T V
tonight on the news about L S D in a school over in Dallas.  So.

A.31:  Oh, is that right?

B.32:  Yep.  So, it's effecting, it's way down there in the high schools and
stuff, and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  (( )).

B.34:  -- I think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and
stuff, you know, or given the death penalty.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  I, I, that L S D even gets into the grade schools when they sell
these, uh, stickers.  They look like, I guess they're dots on a piece of paper
or something --

B.36:  Yeah.

@@A.37:  -- and, uh, you know, that's really, that's really a crime to give it to
the young kids like that. [child_talking] Well, I guess we've talked about all
we can on this topic.  What do you think?

B.38:  Uh, yeah [laughter].

A.39:  Okay.  Well, it's been nice talking with you.  Hope you have a nice day --

B.40:  Okay, #you too.#

A.41:  -- #good evening.#  Talk to you later.  #Bye-bye.#

B.42:  #All right.#  Bye.
