A.1:  Okay, well, hello, Frances.

B.2:  Hello, Paul.

@A.3:  Um, yeah, I guess when I, uh, first, I guess I had mixed feelings about
this, uh, subject, when I first heard about it, um, I thought it was kind of a
neat way of, uh, screening, uh, screening for potential problems, good way for
companies to --

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  -- weed out people with drug problems, but since then I've been hearing,
uh, well, I read an article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL last year that talked
about, um, the different results that they get from, uh, different labs, and
that, uh, many labs will give, uh, false positives --

B.6:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.7:  -- especially some of the less expensive ones, and that people have been
denied employment on this basis.

B.8:  Well, the reliability seems to, [laughter] oh, not be too great.  Um, I
don't know.  I'm kind of like you.  I have mixed feelings, but all in all I
think I'm for it [laughter],

A.9:  [Noise]. 

B.10:  I really do, um, because we lose so much time and what have you with the,
the drug problem, and it's just so prevalent nowadays, that, uh, [inhaling] I
think it's only fair for the, uh, employees, or the employers to, uh, have
some kind of guidelines to go by --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- but like anything else, this can be misused.  

A.13:  Yeah, there's a, I know some employers have, have been able to, uh, reduce
some tremendous problems they've had with employee turnover, health problems
and accidents and theft, and I understand that certain jobs, like if you're
driving a train or plane or something, of course there'd be increased need for
it.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  One thing that always kind of bugged me about it was, uh, there's, they,
most of them don't test for actually the number one drug problem which of
course is, uh, alcohol abuse.

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  And of course that, you know, everybody talks about all the other drugs,
but, uh, [inhaling] I understand alcohol is really still the number one health
problem, and the number one abused drug in, in our country.  So it seems kind
of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are, are, you know, are
the ones that they focus on.

B.18:  Well, it is in every situation that, uh, alcohol is more acceptable to
people it seems than the other, quote, drugs, but, uh, it can do more harm
with the, uh, [inhaling] I don't know, we just seem to have a rash of drunk
drivings and killings around here lately, and, uh.

A.19:  Well, see, now in Texas, uh, didn't they only recently ban open containers
in, in vehicles a few years ago?

B.20:  Yes, yes.  But we aren't very, uh, we aren't very hard even on the, you
know, when they're picked up for drunk drivings, time after time again --

A.21:  Oh, really.

B.22:  -- this is a real problem here, that they get a little slap on their wrists
and [inhaling] there was one man here that had forty-two D W I -s --

A.23:  Oh. [laughter]  Man.

B.24:  -- and the only reason they finally came down on him, he finally did kill
someone --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- an innocent bystander.  

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And on looking back he had forty-two convictions, and yet he was --

A.29:  Right, yeah.

B.30:  -- still walking loose.  So we've got problem here with the alcohol
especially, that, uh.

A.31:  Yeah, I expect possibly in Texas it's, uh, you know --

B.32:  The good old.

A.33:  -- an attorney knows they get in front of a jury, and the jury will be
thinking, well, I've done that before, or he's just a good old boy, you know.

B.34:  Yeah, good old boy stuff [laughter],

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  you know, well this is, yeah, this is natural, this is tell me, what do you
expect.

A.37:  Yeah, right, what else, how else do you drive in your pickup down the
highway [laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] Yeah, and I, I'm afraid, you know, it may come out with some of
these other drugs, too, that, uh, I know, I have some friends whose children
of, uh, you know, it's, they use cocaine --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and it's acc-, it's becoming acceptable to them.

A.41:  Um.

B.42:  That well, you know, they're not, they're not hurting anyone else, and I
thought, where have I heard this before [laughter]?

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And I'm afraid that's what we may be facing in the very near future.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  But, uh.  Other than that, I don't know, because I don't [laughter] drink
and I don't do drugs.

A.47:  Well, same here [laughter].

B.48:  And it's, uh, so neither is really acceptable to me.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah.

B.50:  But, uh, then the work place, it's just, I don't know what is, well, we
really infringing on other rights or their,
