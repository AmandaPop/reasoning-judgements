======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, what do you think about the government providing health
insurance for everybody?  I think they should.  I know I had a job until,
let's see, a year ago this past December.  I was working for P I E and they
closed, [sniffing] and naturally while I was working for them I had health
insurance, but, um, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me like over
three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health
insurance at, #at P I E.#

B.2:  #Good grief.# That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it?

A.3:  Right, it really is, and I think, you know, I think, uh, God, the
government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these
doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.

B.4:  Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, uh, interim health insurance
for people who are between jobs like that.  That might be a step in the right
direction.  I don't know.

A.5:  Well, the thing is, you know, jobs are so hard to find --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- you know, and then,

B.8:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.9:  what you can get out here, in, anyhow in the valley where I live at now,
they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all.  No benefits, you
know.  #Um.#

B.10:  #You mean# the, uh, the employers?

A.11:  Yes.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low #and, uh.#

B.14:  #Because everybody's# competing for jobs.

A.15:  Yeah, and they don't #want, uh,#

B.16:  #[Throat_clearing].#

A.17:  to pay any benefits, so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get
sick.

B.18:  Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the
right thing to do.  I, I have to think about it some more now, because my
doctor is, uh, actually he's Canadian --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and, uh, he told me that there're a lot of, uh, lot of counts against
the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for
here.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  I don't understand the arguments, exactly.  He says it restricts your
choice of doctors, and, and so forth.  I'm not quite sure I understand why
government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private
insurance does.

A.23:  No, I don't #understand# --

B.24:  #I mean# --

A.25:   -- that either.

B.26:  -- we're on a private insurance plan right now, #uh# --

A.27:  #Uh-huh.#

B.28:  -- actually I have my own business, and --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and we, our health insurance is through my wife's employer, and, uh, and
every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can
buy our medicine, and, uh, it changes every year [laughter].

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  It's always so confusing.  So.

A.33:  Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor and I
could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, you know, then I
just sent cards in --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my
medicine, and --

B.36:  Well, yeah.

A.37:  -- then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, you
know.

B.38:  Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain
doctors agree to accept the, uh, the limits --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- of, uh, compensation, but of course that is restricted choice, so --

A.41:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I don't think that the restricted choice really, uh, has to do with the
difference between, uh, public and private health insurance.  I think it has
to do with the, the, the, uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it --

A.43:  Um.

B.44:  -- and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way, so.

A.45:  Yeah, that's true, that's true there.  

B.46:  Well, um --

A.47:  Well.

B.48:  -- I guess the most sensible thing I've heard about this is they say people
are trying.  You, you have to recognize that if you're going to [inhaling]
have the very best health care possible and, uh, available on demand whenever
and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.

A.49:  Yeah, right.

B.50:  And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a
health system that is not quite that, uh, lavish.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And, uh.

A.53:  But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay
anything, you know, that, people that's on unemployment.

B.54:  Yeah, what happened to Reagan's safety net, anyway?

A.55:  I don't [laughter].

B.56:  Did he take that back to California with him?

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  Using it for a trampoline now?

A.59:  Yeah, probably so.  [laughter] I don't know, but it is, it does seem to be
a big problem, you know.  I don't know what they're going to come up with,
but, um, I sure wish they would come up with, with something, and, uh, like I
say, and, and I'm at the age, too, where the, I'll be fifty-seven in June, and
the people don't want to hire people this age any more.  [sniffing] And I
worked for my previous company for twenty-six years, you know, so, [sigh] it's
kind of hard, [sniffing] you know, so.

B.60:  Yeah, they'll be needing you in a couple of years, because they're running
out of kids down that, the other end.

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  And.

A.63:  Yeah, they'll be calling at my door, huh.  [laughter] #But anyhow.#

B.64:  #Well, if they're smart.#

A.65:  Yeah, now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do
something, uh, with this problem, because, it, you know, even to go to a
little doctor out here, just to [sniffing] ask him anything, costs you forty
bucks --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- you know, just for the visit.  And then he, then that's not counting
what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, you know.  And he might
tell you, well, you know, now you're going to have to come back in a week, and
--

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  -- then that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to
you,
