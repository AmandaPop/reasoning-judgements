A.1:  Well, [lipsmack] anyway I, uh, [breathing] I, uh, oh, yeah.  I did forget
to ask you.  What is your name by the way?

B.2:  Uh, I'm Ann.  

@A.3:  Oh, you're Ann.  Hi.  But, uh, [lipsmack] anyway, I, uh, [breathing] lot
of, lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good, be a good
change if we're going to [breathing] be talking about the subject t-, tonight
which in some [lipsmack] I guess criminal courts the [breathing],

B.4:  Criminal courts?  #Yes.#

A.5:  #Yeah.# Th-, the [lipsmack] one of which was, uh, something, something
that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that
is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their
race.  Uh,

B.6:  Oh, really?  

A.7:  Yeah.  Well, they, they, uh, the, the people that (( )) the, uh, the jury
that's trying, uh, the officers in that case,

B.8:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.9:  #is,# is an all white panel.  And there's been a lot made in the local
papers of that,

B.10:  #I see.# 

A.11:  #fact.# 

B.12:  I can't, I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that
one.

A.13:  They have.  They have.  They moved it up to the county north of here.

B.14:  Oh.  

A.15:  Um, it's in Ventura and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity
obviously, and it's kind of, it's kind of debatable whether you could get a
fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that,

B.16:  Well, that videotape was just horrible.  

A.17:  Yeah.  It was everywhere.  

B.18:  Yes.  

A.19:  So you know, and I, I think it would be very difficult to find someone, uh,
find a panel that would be, not have seen it and, and known of what was going
on.

B.20:  Oh, I agree with you but I can't imagine that they would do an all white
jury without having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh,
appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff.

A.21:  Exactly.  You know, um, the [lipsmack] you know, I, I'm kind of torn on
this issue.  It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's
not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true.  But on
the other hand, it's, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to, are
not going to convict.

B.22:  Right.  

A.23:  Uh, you know, they're not going to do their job.  Which is the whole, the
whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on
whether,

B.24:  #Exactly.# 

A.25:  #or not# the person, whether or not the evidence says, 

B.26:  #Based on fact.  Right.# 

A.27:  #that there's enough# [breathing],

B.28:  How interesting.  Oh.  So what's the prevailing thought within the
community?

A.29:  #Um,#  

B.30:  #I mean# you know, what the news media is going to make of it, but what
about the community?

A.31:  They, well, I guess it depends on who you talk to.  I haven't talked to,
uh, [lipsmack] I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but I, I
rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it.  And a lot of the
usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks,

B.32:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.33:  #kind of stuff.# 

B.34:  Oh, my goodness.  That can't be good for Los Angeles either.

A.35:  [Breathing] No, no.  I, you know, on, on, on one hand you know, on the one
hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm-, they have that
very strong piece of physical evidence [laughter] showing,

B.36:  #Oh, exactly.#

A.37:  #these people# beating the heck out of this guy.  Um,

B.38:  Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to [lipsmack] a big city
like Los Angeles.  You're going to have it just about anywhere.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  There.  

A.41:  Well, 

B.42:  But that's, that's interesting.  

A.43:  Yeah.  Um [noise], 

B.44:  What about the judge who's hearing the case?  Is he going to be impartial?
Is he going to,

A.45:  [Sigh]. 

B.46:  be a go-, a good adjudicator?  

A.47:  I don't know.  You know, and, and again there's something else tha-, you
know, there was a [lipsmack], uh, something else along those lines.  There
was a girl out here named ((Latausha Harlins)).  I don't know if it's, it's
got, it's got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it
was, as it was with, uh, the Rodney King problem.  Um, a girl walked into a
Korean owned store [lipsmack] and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl.

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  She, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with
the owner of the store.  The owner of the store popped her.

B.50:  Oh, [laughter] really?  

A.51:  Yeah.  And, and, oh, of course, they, you know, the criminal case went up
and, [breathing] and the judge gave the woman who shot her, shot the girl a,
uh, uh, practically a suspended sentence.  I mean it was --

B.52:  Oh, my goodness.  

A.53:  -- it was just, she gave her no time in jail, you know, all of these things
and then, oh, there's we have these, we have people wondering around to-, with
petitions trying to get the judge,

B.54:  To get that judge recalled I would think.  

A.55:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

B.56:  Huh.  That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized
sentences.

A.57:  Yeah.  It would make, it would make life easier.

B.58:  #It would.# 

A.59:  #Yeah.#

B.60:  #Uh,# 

A.61:  #But,#

B.62:  you would know, the whole world would know what you were facing.  And then
it's a matter of, of deciding,
