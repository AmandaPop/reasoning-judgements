=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I've recently dropped my subscription to the local paper, well, not
exactly local, it's a pretty big one, the ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION because
I was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper.  Was
really pretty poor and I couldn't see spending half an hour a day looking
through that.

B.2:  Yeah, I did the same thing, actually.  I, uh, don't have a, I'm not
subscribing anymore.

A.3:  Yeah, I try and watch the news as well.  We get, uh, cable here and watch
HEADLINE news, but it's such a, I don't know, there's really very little depth
to it.  They seem to be really out to try and entertain more than, uh, you
know, pass on any real information.  It's pretty trashy.  I'm not happy with
it.

B.4:  Are you unhappy with the, uh, with the, how should I say it, uh,
[breathing] --

A.5:  The,   

B.6:  -- the one-sidedness of it or -- 

A.7:  The, I -- 

B.8:  -- or the,

A.9:  -- think more, the, uh, the just the, the real lack of meat behind it.  I
think there was an article in some local news magazine recently that
mentioned, it w-, talked about the, uh, uh, level of, uh, reading ability or
something or other and things like President Bush's, uh, statements to the
public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old,
uh, the, the last election nonsense and they were talking about how Dukakis,
his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level, while
Bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that, uh, being able to
convey to that lar-, much larger of an audience, you know, he was supposedly
that much more an effective communicator and I think that's the same problem
with the news is they're trying to communicate with maybe so many people that
it's just coming out really pretty poor.

B.10:  My, my problem is that they just don't, uh, how should I say it, I, I can
either get, uh, things on one side or the other, but not, uh, a meaningful
discussion --

A.11:  Um.  

B.12:  -- that relates to, well, how should I say, I either get these highly
polarized things.

A.13:  Yeah, I agree.  

B.14:  And sometimes they're, I say, okay, we're going to, we're going to do, uh,
uh, we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized
articles --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- which, which is, uh, better than, than one, but, uh,

A.17:  Yeah, that's like, uh, trying to maintain a temperature in your house by
running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time.

B.18:  So, uh, anyway, so we're, uh, one of the problems [breathing], the other
problem that I have is that, that, uh, [lipsmack] as you said, uh, a lot of
the articles are, they're either fluff, uh, well, actually out of the press
they're, they're fluff or they're, uh, [breathing] pretty shallow but,

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  [Beep] Course I h-, I also have the option and I guess you do, too, of
signing up for one of these, uh, [lipsmack] uh, specialty magazines which is
like in the case of, uh, science, you know, you sign up for, uh, --

A.21:  Yeah, they are good.  

B.22:  -- NATURE or something like that but,

A.23:  I'm surprised at the, the, the range and quality of things that are out
there, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.  There's such a broad, uh, spectrum of
science and yet it's really in depth at the same time.

B.24:  But, when it comes to news, uh, it's a, I find it, I, I think the reason
perhaps for that is that the, uh, the, uh, press, like everything else, is, is
becoming a, uh, how should I say, is becoming, they're not neighborhood, uh,
press --

A.25:  Yeah --  

B.26:  -- anymore.  

A.27:  -- and national.  

B.28:  They're worried more, they're more like U S A TODAY type things, uh, pretty
shallow, and, and can we make it, uh, and they're run by, you have ten
newspapers that are run by, uh, uh,

A.29:  Held by the same company?  

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  Yeah, I agree.  We recently had NEWSWEEK at the house, but went ahead and
dropped it, decided it really wasn't what we were looking for and we started
subscription to U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT but it hasn't started arrived yet.
Going to try and evaluate that.  You know, another interesting source of news
is the, is E MAIL, the network news.

B.32:  Oh, yeah.  

A.33:  Do you get that?  

B.34:  Yes, that's one of the most inter-, that's how I found out about this.

A.35:  Yeah, me, too.  I really, if, if I, when I move, when I go to my next job,
I'm really going to be,

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  uh, upset if I don't have access to that.  

B.38:  Well, there are some places here in town, uh, for people that are, uh,
[lipsmack] having, uh, withdrawal pains, so to speak.  Uh, there's a,
bookstore that has a, uh, subscription type thing where you can pay the guy
forty dollars a, a year, which is pretty --

A.39:  Oh, that's cheap.  

B.40:  -- small potatoes.   

A.41:  And you get to call in across a modem?  

B.42:  Yeah, call -- 

A.43:  Oh.  

B.44:  -- in on the modem and you can read your news -- 

A.45:  Man.  

B.46:  -- I mean read your mail and, uh, and, uh, look at the, all the different
internet, uh, uh, groups.

A.47:  Excellent, yeah, that really seems to be a, a one of the cutting, leading,
