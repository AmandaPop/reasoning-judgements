===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay so,   

A.2:  Well, what kind of, uh, programs do you all have for recycling?

@B.3:  Uh, around here we can recycle almost anything.  Uh, we have paper and
cans and, uh, newspaper, I guess.

A.4:  Uh-huh.  

B.5:  Uh, and then I guess plastic and glass.  It's a little harder to do, but we
can recycle those as well.

A.6:  Is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or
a collection center?

B.7:  There's curbside, but, uh, for items like glass and, and plastic, it's only
like once every three weeks or something crazy like that.

A.8:  Oh, okay.  

B.9:  So you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to
put anything out any other night so [laughter],

A.10:  Right, well, we have it once a week, they just started it not too long ago
and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of
[laughter] plastics.  Uh, but it's not real convenient like you said, for lots
of other things.  Uh, and it, it is kind of nice, though because you can put
everything in together and you don't have to sort it out --

B.11:  Right.  

A.12:  -- which is nice.  

B.13:  Yeah, so you don't have to split anything up.  

A.14:  No.  

B.15:  Oh, okay.  

A.16:  Uh, you just, they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it.
There's a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is
convenient, but if you want to recycle anything other than their list, you
know, good luck [laughter].

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  Uh, we have a couple of collection places around, but they're pretty
inconvenient to get to and, and those you do have to sort and, and most people
don't have room, you know, in their house for ten or twenty different bins for
all the different sorting things you have to do.

B.19:  Right.  Well, I, the last place I lived was really, it was in New Jersey as
well, but it was, uh, it was really a lot hard, harder to do it because, uh,
it's different depending on what town you're in basically.  Every town is
different --

A.20:  Right.  

B.21:  -- which I think that, that's crazy, that it should be coordinated by the
state or something but,

A.22:  Well, what's kind of interesting --

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  -- is here, when the program started, they made a big deal about it, but
they only gave it to like five thousand houses --

B.25:  Uh-huh.  

A.26:  -- which, in Atlanta is nothing.  

B.27:  Right.  

A.28:  You know, and it was interesting because it was, the only reason we got it
is because we're sort of on the outskirts of this rather plush area so
[laughter] you can tell where they put the recycling, uh, program in place, so
Atlanta really hasn't spread it out very much at all yet, I don't think.  Uh,

B.29:  Are y-,

A.30:  I guess -- 

B.31:  Are y-,

A.32:  -- budgetary restraints.  

B.33:  Oh, yeah, are you living at school, or are you outside of school?

A.34:  Uh, no, I live off campus.  

B.35:  Oh okay, so,

A.36:  Yeah, pretty far off.  

B.37:  It's not just the school that's doing it or,

A.38:  Right, no -- 

B.39:  Okay.  

A.40:  -- it's, it's the city.  The s-, Georgia Tech has it's own, well, has been
trying to get it's own recycling program, uh, uh, operated through the student
government, but there, they have tried and tried to get an area allotted to
them for a collection center --

B.41:  Right.  

A.42:  -- and the school keeps saying no because, uh, there's a lot of people in,
in town, homeless people who collect cans --

B.43:  Right.  

A.44:  -- for a living and they're afraid that that's going to attract crime onto
campus.

B.45:  Oh. 

A.46:  Having a ready supply of cans.  

B.47:  Okay [laughter].  I thought they were afraid of putting them out of work or
something.

A.48:  [Laughter] No, well, I don't know, you know, what their, their philosophy
was on that --

B.49:  Okay.  

A.50:  -- but, uh, so they, it's kind of a crime that we have all these students
wanting to do this and no cooperation to, to get that program going.

B.51:  Right.  

A.52:  But, a friend of mine and I had also thought a while back about doing some
recycling on our own to make some money and I think it was interesting, I
found out that glass is only worth like a penny a pound --

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  -- and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make, you know,
if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred
pounds, well, that's great, but that's a dollar [laughter].

B.55:  Yeah.  

A.56:  So it's not a real profitable thing for, for people to do.  

B.57:  Well, not for individuals, but like my company, uh, started doing recycling
because it became mandatory in the state.

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  I think it was mandatory in the state, but they did it, and they started a
recycling program just of paper, I guess --

A.60:  Right.  

B.61:  -- and, in two years they saved like four million dollars.  

A.62:  Wow.  

B.63:  Uh, they, that's how much money they got paid for their paper. 

A.64:  Yeah.

B.65:  They,

A.66:  Well, now I know that, I know that the same thing applies for aluminum.
It's much more profitable than glass.

B.67:  Uh-huh.  

A.68:  Uh, but I just thought, you know, we had thought, wow, this would be a nice
little sideline because there's ev-, we'd been going out to the bars around
here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles.

B.69:  Uh-huh.  

A.70:  So we thought, well, you got this ready market -- 

B.71:  Right.  

A.72:  -- you know.  These bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet,
there's, there's almost no way you could make money at it.

B.73:  Right.  

A.74:  Because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit you'd make --

B.75:  Uh-huh.  

A.76:  -- because glass is, you know, but I'm sure that as far as aluminum,
