===========================================================================

A.1:  So, it says, how do you keep up on news.  Uh --

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  -- I suppose I had longer to think about it #so,#

B.4:  #[Laughter].#

A.5:  I'll just answer the question.

B.6:  Okay.

@A.7:  I get almost all, well, the majority of my news from radio and news
letters which is kind of unusual, but it's a pretty cost effect-, or time
effective way to do it because on T V you have to put up with all the happy
talk and the --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- commercials.  [swallowing] [smack] And, uh, then on like news papers,
well they just take too long to read.  I use to read news papers very
faithfully, but I just ran out of time.  [inhaling] So, I tape record net, ALL
THINGS CONSIDERED from National Public Radio --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- and I, I when I ride the bik-, when I ride my bike to campus, I
[laughter] on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and to get the other side I get a bunch of news letters from
organizations which are mostly on the right.  And, how about you?

B.14:  Ok, Okay.  Uh, that's interesting.  I've never heard of a news letters
angle.  I am also an ALL THINGS CONSIDERED person, WEEKEND #EDITION# --

A.15:  #Uh-huh.#

B.16:  -- whatever.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Uh, I generally enjoy it, although sometimes they have a tendency to do
twenty minute features on things I had just had soon not hear for --

A.19:  Um.

B.20:  -- about two minutes.

A.21:  All the, all the AIDS cases in Miami --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- for example.

B.24:  Yeah, exactly.

A.25:  Yeah, that's right.  Well, I mean the, the only thing about them is that
the-, the-, their, news, uh, most of the time tends to be pretty slanted to the
left and you just can't tell really what's happening for, I mean, take for
example, the economy, where they've not, not, not them alone, but most of the
news media, but probably they more [laughter], more, uh, strongly than a lot of
the others [swallowing] have all these programs about bad economic news and as
soon as the news gets good, it just disappears, you know.  Jus-, just don't
report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news.

B.26:  Yeah, although I think that's probably, uh, true of most news coverage in
general.

A.27:  [Inhaling].

B.28:  Good news, isn't news.  Right?

A.29:  Um, I don't know.  But I think that, for example, after the, uh, [smack]
after the, uh, Iran Iraq War when, uh, oil, oil prices came way down, I think
it would have been news that [inhaling] oil company profits decreased as I am
sure they did.  You just didn't hear about it.

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  So, uh, I, I get pretty upset with them.  Actually a lot, but the only
thing is there is not other game in town, except for monitor which is you, you
know about, uh, about the Christian Science monitor program.

B.32:  Uh #yeah# -- 

A.33:  #Uh.#

B.34:  -- on television or radio.

A.35:  No, no, on radio.  They have an hour a day news program.  [inhaling] #But
that's,# 

B.36:  #Yep.#  Oh excuse me.

A.37:  I'm #sorry.#

B.38:  #I was# just going to say up here they, they broadcast that, I think,
between five A M and six A M which is a little before I get up so I usually
miss it.

A.39:  [Smack] Right, yeah.  That, it, I don't think they, well, I mean, I know
they don't broadcast it here at all.  And the only way that I can ever listen
to that is when I am in another part of the country, #so.#

B.40:  #Right.#

A.41:  Uh, you know, I mean, they're, they're really the only game in town and if
you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour,
that's, that's about the only way to do it which I find kind of unfortunate.
Now there is the MCNEIL LEHRER news hour, but that's on T V and then you've
got to be sitting there.

B.42:  Yeah, like, like you.  I, I rarely spend time watching news on T V.  The,
uh, I gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn't usually work out I
have time to watch something more in depth like LEHRER so --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- for me it's pretty much a diet of, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, and I like to
look at the WALL STREET JOURNAL --

A.45:  Uh-huh. 

B.46:  -- at work which, uh, I think does a fine job.  It too has a slant but, uh,

A.47:  Yeah, well at least it's not the same slant is, is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,,
huh.

B.48:  Yeah, exactly and,

A.49:  So that's, that's true.  Yeah, but, now I like the WALL STREET JOURNAL.  If
I subscribed, well let's see.  If I subscribed to a news paper, I probably
would get it.  It's, it would be that or U S A TODAY but, uh, they, they have
good in depth articles.  Mostly on things that have to do with, you know,
credit cards or other things relating to, to financial things or, or financial
planning, but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page
one.

B.50:  Yeah, I think, uh, what is it, the fourth column of page one is, uh, kind
of famous in it's own right --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- just for [noise] human interest stories or business interest stories ((I
mean)) --

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  -- ((and)),

A.55:  I was discussing actually one of those stories with, uh, I just happen to,
I don't know how I acquired a WALL STREET JOURNAL, it just happened.  Uh, last
month there was a story on recycling --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- uh, uh, I think actually that was a column one story though, but that
talked about the way that some communities are trying to recycle so much that
they don't have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one
locality, I think it was Portland, ended up burning,

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  the stuff [laughter] some of it, some of it because there's nothing else
they could do with it.

B.60:  Right.  Back to square one.

A.61:  Yeah.  So, it was, it was, you know, good to find out a little bit more
than, than you would in, certainly in any story on network news.  I mean not
just, uh, that was the only thing, but it was, it was good discussion of the
markets for various recycled products.

B.62:  Yeah and that's, that's the kind of thing the JOURNAL does best.  I find I
don't have time to read through the whole thing certainly, but I find if you
just,
