A.1:  So, uh, w-, where do you get your current events?  

B.2:  I'm --

A.3:  T-,

B.4:  -- I don't keep up on current events very well at all.  

A.5:  Okay [laughter].  

@B.6:  [Laughter] What I, what I do on my, I keep up on current events by, as I
walk by the newspaper stand,

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  if there is a headline that grabs my attention, then I will stand there and
look at it for a minute, then walk into my office.

A.9:  [Laughter]. 

B.10:  Maybe once every six months I'll, I'll find something that's interesting
enough that I'll buy the paper and then usually I r-, end up reading a lot of
it.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  Uh, do you watch any television?  

B.12:  Uh, no.  

A.13:  Oh.  

B.14:  Oh, yeah, I do, I watch, I watch STAR TREK and sometimes I watch the
EQUALIZER.  I never watch the news.

A.15:  Uh-huh, huh.  

B.16:  My roommates watch the news sometimes, so sometimes I'll get, get
interested in a news article, so I guess a little bit leaks through there --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and, uh, sometimes on a, on a plane or in a airport I'll, I'll be
sitting s-, somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and I'll read
parts of it.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  But, uh, I don't make any deliberate effort to keep up on current events.
I, probably about one of the least informed people [laughter],

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  around.  How about you?  

A.23:  Well, uh, I used to read the whole paper every day.  

B.24:  Wow.  

A.25:  And, uh, when you, when I did that, I really knew stuff, you know.  I mean,
if you read the whole paper every day, you walk into work and you're like, you
want to talk to people about, so, what do you think about the situation in
West Pakistan, [laughter] like this, the parliamentary government's not g-,
not, you know, not going to stay in there.  And people sort of stare at you.
Uh, but now I have a child --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- and I, I read the comics every day [laughter].  Uh, and I sort of glance
at the front page.  Uh, I also used to listen to, uh, [lip_smack] public
radio.  Tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  And when I, when I was doing that and reading the paper, I really, I really
felt informed.  Uh, especially having the two different viewpoints, uh,
slightly different, anyway.  Uh, now I listen to the radio maybe five minutes
in the morning, and I don't get to listen ((in the)) evening, so I'm pretty,
pretty uninformed.  Uh, but those were my two big ones, the newspaper and the
radio.  Uh,

B.30:  Yeah, we have a news station here that I listen to sometimes on the way to
work, but it's a short drive.

A.31:  Uh-huh [laughter], yeah, oh, that was the other thing.  I used to drive to
work.  I used to have a long commute --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- and I would listen to, every morning on, uh, [lipsmack] public radio,
there's a show called MORNING EDITION that lasts an hour and a half --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- and they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so I would listen to
two segments of that and, you know, really, really know stuff.

B.36:   Wow.  

A.37:  And now that I'm just walking and riding the bus, uh, I, I miss that.  Uh,
but the, uh, the, well, during the, during the Gulf War we turned on the T V a
couple times.  Did you w-, watch any more during that?

B.38:  In the Gulf War?  

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  Uh,   

A.41:  The whole Iraq thing.  

B.42:  That, I have to say that, during the Gulf War, yeah, I watched a lot of C N
N.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  I really did, uh, because I was pretty interested in that.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And I have a, a, an Iranian roommate -- 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- and, uh, so he had it on constantly.  

A.49:  Oh, yeah, I'll bet [laughter].  

B.50:  [Laughter] And, uh, so, and actually I learned a lot from him about world
situations and also I have a bunch of Persian friends because of him and so,

A.51:  Oh, you probably learned a lot from them, yeah.  

B.52:  Yeah, and they are always telling me about countries I have never heard of
and polit-, political situations that totally amaze me.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  And so,

A.55:  Yeah, there is so much to know.  It is amazing.  Uh, well, uh, one thing
that was interesting during that whole thing, when I would listen to the radio
quite a bit and, uh, you know, I started bringing a radio to work and I would
listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way, the way
there and, uh, I really felt like I was keeping up pretty well, and then I
would watch C N N for, you know, fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a
bunch of pictures and realize I hadn't really learned anything.  You know,
they would sort of show planes taking off and, uh, it's like I, I got more
visual information, but less --

B.56:  Less content.  

A.57:  -- real information in a way.  

B.58:  They were kind of starved for real information, I think at that point --

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- because all they had was, was military clips and,

A.61:  Yeah, and it's almost as though, that was, stuff was more available to T V
so they used it.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  You know.  

B.64:  Well, they have to show something.  

A.65:  They have to show something and that's all they could show.  On T V they
could, I mean, on the radio they would bring in all sorts of, you know,
experts from, God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and
speculate, uh, I think, in part, at least, because they had to.  Uh, which is
kind of interesting, so I just found that they, the information per hour was
much higher on the radio, although --

B.66:  I never thought about that.

A.67:  -- the T V was a little more compelling.  

B.68:  The information per hour, well, technically, the information on the T V is
higher, but the actual content is less.

A.69:  R-, it's, it's an interesting question about, you know, the bend with, the,
the telev-,
