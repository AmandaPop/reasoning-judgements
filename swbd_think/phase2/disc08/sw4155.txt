A.1:  [Beep] [breathing]  Um, what's our topic?  

B.2:  Taxes.  

A.3:  Taxes.  

B.4:  Do we pay too much?  

A.5:  Right.  Right.  Um [laughter],

B.6:  Well, do we?  

A.7:  What do you do?  

B.8:  Um, 

@A.9:  I guess that, I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're
in.

B.10:  My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there.  I pay the, I generally pay the
maximum tax bracket.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  And, uh, I think that we're paying too much because I don't have any
children.

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  And I pay a lot of property taxes.  

A.15:  Oh, sure.  

B.16:  I don't have any, um, [lipsmack] I don't, you know, I don't use an awful
lot of city services.  It, it, you know [laughter] --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- it's like I have to work m-, I have to work all the time --

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- just to make enough money to pay the taxes.   

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  And, um, y-, there's so many people who want a, a ((dib)) of the federal
money --

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  -- or the state money or whatever it is and I just, sometimes, many times I
end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  How about you?  Do you pay too much?

A.27:  Uh, well, no, I can't really complain.  I'm a student, um, and I d-, I work
as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute.  And, uh, I'm going to get
back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes and, uh, and,
uh,

B.28:  #Well, when you# --

A.29:  #on-, one of# my parents is still claiming me.  Huh?  

B.30:  -- when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- it, it changes quickly.  

A.33:  I'm sure  [laughter].

B.34:  Um, you look at your paycheck and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go
[laughter].

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  Um, what kind of, what kind of, uh, well have you pay a lot of in ta-, have
you been out working and then gone back to school or are you, did you go
directly from high school into, into college?

A.37:  I went, well I did work, um, just very (( )) for some time but I didn't
make enough money to really [breathing] make,

B.38:  #To worry about it.# 

A.39:  #too much of a# difference.  Right.  

B.40:  Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this?
Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that?

A.41:  No, no, I haven't.  

B.42:  I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  Um, but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, uh, in D C area,
um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress, um,
[lipsmack] Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, you know,
there's a bank that they all bank with, and I guess it went defunct recently.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years al-,
about a thousand bad checks.

A.47:  Huh.  

B.48:  And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho-, all those bad
checks,

A.49:  #Oh.# 

B.50:  #no# interest, no repayment schedule.  

A.51:  Really?  

B.52:  And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here, 

A.53:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.54:  #because# we're so close to D C anyway.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.  

A.57:  Oh, sure.  

B.58:  Um, I, I, I think we pay too much.  And I've, I look at my paycheck and I
make, well, let's see.  They take out in state and federal taxes --

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- [Lipsmack] I think I pay forty-two percent.  

A.61:  Wow. 

B.62:  Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,

A.63:  [Noise].

B.64:  and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes,

A.65:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  (( )) taxes.

B.66:  and they charge me all these others, and it's just too expensive.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  I can't believe that I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the
government that I pay for.

A.69:  Huh.  

B.70:  You know what I mean?  

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were
guaranteed by the government?

A.73:  No, no, I haven't.  Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my
tuition.  So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.

B.74:  What are you studying down there?  

A.75:  Physics.  

B.76:  Physics.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field.

A.79:  [Laughter]  Everybody says that  [laughter]. 

B.80:  [Laughter]  Scientific.  

A.81:  Huh.  

B.82:  [Laughter]  Heavy science.  

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  Are you like in the particle, particle research or [breathing] anything
like that or is it more, um, applied physics?

A.85:  Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet.
Actually, um, [breathing] the, the degree I'm getting is physics.  There's a
different one for applied physics so I guess you could call it more straight
stuff --

B.86:  Okay.   

A.87:  -- than applied.  

B.88:  Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's,

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  (( )) come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.

A.91:  I doubt about that.  Are, are, is America, I mean are we pretty, pretty
steep compared to most countries?

B.92:  Actually, I don't think we are.

A.93:  #No, I don't think so either.# 

B.94:  #Um, like, like# Europe, 

A.95:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.96:  #um,# England.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  I know the taxes are a lot higher.  

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.  

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  And, um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, um,
they're talking, or maybe it was on the radi-,
