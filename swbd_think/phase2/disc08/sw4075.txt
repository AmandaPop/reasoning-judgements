============================================================================

A.1:  (( )) this recycling, it's, uh, I don't know what you all are doing but, we
are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it, uh, they have a trial
section that, uh, part of the city has been given the, the, plastic garbage
cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out.

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  I don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
[laughter].

B.4:  Right, here in Philadelphia, the city for residential customers has
certain, they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with
special containers [noise].

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And then, they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every
year a different piece of the city gets added to the list, but in my
neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  You, on the first and third Saturdays of every month, you take your [noise]
bottles and your newspapers and, lets see, bottles, newspapers to certain
corners in the neighborhood.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic --

A.11:  Yes.

B.12:  -- they, uh, it use to be a firehouse --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- but they are trying to get some urban renewal going in here [noise] and
trying to make the area safer.  I live near the University of Pennsylvania
where I'm a grad student --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and it's not the safest neighborhood there is.

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  So they are trying to get urban renewal going and they, one of the things
that this farmer's market does is collect plastic --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and
that kind of thing.

A.21:  Oh that's inter-, the grocery stores here usually have some bins for the
plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things.

B.22:  Right.  They have that for the plastic bags here #too.#

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  Yeah.  Let's see and the, um,

A.25:  We don't have very, uh, I do not know of a very good place for glass here,
but I don't, I would not know where to take glass.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  How about aluminum cans?  Do they recycle that?

A.27:  Oh yes.  They will recycle those.  We have places for those and, uh, for a
while they were, the newspapers, there were places, but I think they had so
many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any
place.

B.28:  Right.  Well the only part, the thing is that it's only profitable to just
from a standpoint of making new paper to recycle --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- but where you end of having your savings is at your landfill last so
much longer.

A.31:  Yes, I know and we have that problem. [laughter]  #But, uh,#

B.32:  #Down home# I know my folks, uh, live in South Carolina and they have had
some landfill filling up problems and they, the county built a new landfill
and a site that wasn't geologically proper.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  So that, the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably
communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away, but
they just won't have to build landfills as often.

A.35:  I see.

B.36:  Another things that they are doing, now at home, but in the offices here,
is recycling of paper and that is done by separating the white paper which is,
I guess is a higher quality --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- from the miscellaneous paper.

A.39:  Huh.

B.40:  And, well they also recycle aluminum cans.

A.41:  Yes.

B.42:  And every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white
paper and the mixed paper --

A.43:  Oh, that's a good idea.

B.44:  -- and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get
filled up you can go take them down the hall.

A.45:  Oh.  But do you all have any place around there for, uh, used oil, car oil?

B.46:  Oh, you know, that's one thing that kind of bothered me.  I, I now, when I,
I use to get my, my oil changed when I go down to South Carolina.  There has
been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car --

A.47:  Uh-huh {Very faint}.

B.48:  -- for a number of years --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and they have pretty economical rates, but now in South Carolina there
is this mandatory waste recycling fee and my Daddy would like to, to get the
used oil to pour over fence posts.

A.51:  Huh.

B.52:  So you know, to make the fence posts last longer --

A.53:  Right, uh-huh.

B.54:  -- weather better, but the oil, the, the, uh, Goodyear store won't even,
they say they can't give you the oil.  They say it's against the federal law
now and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee.

A.55:  My goodness.

B.56:  So the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway, they say it's because
of federal law, you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself.

A.57:  Huh.  Well we do ours ourself and we take it to a, uh,
