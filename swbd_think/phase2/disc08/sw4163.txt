=========================================================================

A.1:  It seems to me that the, the benefits of working for a big company tend to
be the, the same things that, that are to their determent.  They aren't as, as
responsive both to like bad economic times.  You don't have to worry about
your job all of a sudden disappearing.

B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  But when you see a job, when you see a, a job that needs to be done,
sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to, to
get it done.

B.4:  #Yeah.#

A.5:  #Do you know what I# mean?

B.6:  Yeah.  See I work for a really small company.  It's just me and my boss
[laughter].

A.7:  Oh, wow.

B.8:  So it's really small.  And I think it's really nice because you know it's,
it's real easy.  We don't really have much to do but it's just me and him.
So, if he needs something done, I do it or, you know, it just goes straight
from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're
saying but --

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  -- but sometimes it's kind of bad because if I'm sick, then I, kind of, I
usually have to go in unless I'm, you know, have to stay in bed because I'm
the only one there.

A.11:  There is that.

B.12:  #Yeah.#

A.13:  #I mean,# well, and then I guess, again I, I gu-, like I said when I, when
I started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the
disadvantages.  I mean if I don't show up for, for work, there's probably
somebody else that could fill my spot but --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- um, I imagine, and, and that's nice.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  But, uh, it's w-, it's also nice to be able to, uh, know that, that you are
the person that, that makes things get done.

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  #You know,# if, if you're not there, it doesn't happen.

B.20:  Yeah.  And al-, also in big companies they have, uh, like vacations and
all.

A.21:  #Yeah.#

B.22:  #No,# if I take a vacation, I've got to get a friend or someone else to
come in for, a temporary to come in for a week.

A.23:  Oh, wow.

B.24:  Yeah, so [laughter],

A.25:  Oh, wow.

B.26:  [Laughter] So, it's pretty nice being able to take off and have someone
else take your, take up your time and all.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  So, 

A.29:  You know one other benefit that, tha-, just occurred to me.  I didn't take
it, as much advantage of it, at least not yet, in [noise] sometimes big
companies will pay for like education.

B.30:  Oh, yeah.

A.31:  I had some friends of mine, uh, get sent up to Stanford for a year for, uh,
college.

B.32:  #Yeah.#

A.33:  #Or for# like, for grad school, and I guess getting stuck in California for
the summer is, is not such a bad thing.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  You know, but, uh,

B.36:  A friend of mine works for a, a stockbroker --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and, um, it's a really, it's a big company and they said that, um, as a,
after she works there a year, as long as she takes business courses, they'll
reimburse her.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  So, that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  And that's pretty nice.  My job won't do that [laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Yeah, but I would think that a, a smaller company you
would have a, I mean if, if, if a small company hits some niche in the, some
niche market that, that it is uniquely qualified to, um, take care of, it has
a chance to, to grow really fast.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  And if you can get on top of it before, before it goes up, I mean, you know
if all of a sudden the company expanded to like, you know, three thousand
people, you would probably be one of the top people.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Of course, I guess if there's only the two of you, you'll, I mean, I guess
y-, you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half, so.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  So.  Uh, um, the only other thing I can think of is, uh, stuff for things
like, uh, like if, if there's some kind of child care if, if someone were
married and had kids.

B.50:  Yeah.  #That's,# 

A.51:  #Bigger companies# might have something like that.  

B.52:  Yeah.  That would be nice.

A.53:  And, uh, um, [lipsmack] like, like it's their, I guess another advantage
might be that, uh, if t-, if it's a big enough company and it has multiple
sites --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- um, if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you
wanted to live in another part of the country.

B.56:  Yeah.  They moved, uh, my Dad worked for, I'm not even sure where but they
moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  So, [laughter] we kind of got moved around, but it was pretty nice because
you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all.  I mean I guess it's
nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next, be
near them you can see it, switch through the company to, over at that state or
whatever.

A.59:  Which, I guess, I, being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to
move but do you think, uh, do you think it was good to, to move around or not?

B.60:  Yeah, I do.  I mean I think it kind of helped us because you know we
weren't just living in Dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about
Dallas and, you know, I mean I doubt seriously that if we had stayed here,
that I would have been able to move to, to get to San Antonio very much so.

A.61:  Oh, you had family in San Antonio?

B.62:  No.

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  We had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio, and we were kind of
like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana.

A.65:  Okay.

B.66:  So, but I guess it was pretty nice because, you know, we got to experience
living down there somewhere different.

A.67:  See I'm trying to decide, my Dad was in the military which is, I guess if
you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company.

B.68:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

A.69: [Laughter] A number of people but, uh, although it's getting smaller every,
every day.  Um, and we moved like, oh, man, we used to move like every, every
three years at least.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  And like I don't know, I mean there's, well, there's, I, I've kept in touch
with some people from college but, but I don't, I mean I don't really know, I
ca-, I wouldn't, I couldn't y-,
