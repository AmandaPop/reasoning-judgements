==========================================================================

B.1:  Yeah.

A.2:  Uh, uh, capital punishment I understand means if somebody commits a serious
enough crime, we kill them.

@B.3:  That's correct.

A.4:  Is that your understanding of it?

B.5:  Right, uh-huh.

A.6:  Well, let me put it bluntly.  Uh, there's not too many things that Arabs do
right, but one of the things they do is have a low crime rate.  They don't
have too many repeat offenders --

B.7:  Right.

A.8:  -- and they have, uh, very serious capital punishment over there.

B.9:  Yes.  I, I really think that, uh, there is room for that.  [noise] I feel
like if anybody has committed murder and they, and they convict them, that they
definitely, and they're sentenced to life in prison, then it's not fair to
have us to pay for them to stay there for life --

A.10:  Huh-uh.

B.11:  -- and then get paroled and go back out.

A.12:  Huh-uh.

B.13:  [Lipsmack] I believe that if they're convicted and it's, uh [noise], you
know the only scary part I see in that is a crooked law system that would put
people to death without enough evidence.

A.14:  #Yeah.#

B.15:  #To close the case.#  Do you know what I mean?

A.16:  Yeah.  That shouldn't happen, but unfortunately it can.

B.17:  Right.

A.18:  Uh, I, I'm in, I think we are pretty much in agreement.  Uh, in Texas this
[inhaling] death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it,
I guess.

B.19:  Well I don't think it's too, uh, productive to put someone in prison for a
life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of
each other.

A.20:  Yeah, they get out in what [noise].

B.21:  Right and, uh, then they are repeat offenders.  Uh --

A.22:  Uh,

B.23:  -- I went to school with one of Ted Bundy's attacked girls.

A.24:  Um.

B.25:  She was, uh, older than me.  She was three years older, but she went to the
same high school as I did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been
under suspicion and everything at that point.  #And I think# --

A.26:  #He killed her?#

B.27:  -- he killed her --

A.28:  Oh my gosh {very faint}.

B.29:  -- definitely.  Uh-huh.

A.30:  Well, I was in the University of Texas years ago when [inhaling] one guy
killed two girls in his room and hid the bodies in the field.  [smack] And
every now, and that was in the sixties.  Every now and then he comes up for
parole.  It's just scary that he could actually get back out.

B.31:  Right.  Uh, I think that,

A.32:  [Breathing].

B.33:  in my belief, I belie-, we, uh, I believe that if a person has killed, then
there really isn't much point to them going on anyway, because they pretty
much ruined what they came to earth to do.  You know, what they're here --

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  -- to do, to try to make life, uh, the best that they can.

A.36:  What would you think about public executions?

B.37:  I definitely --

A.38:  Televised.

B.39:  -- no, I don't think so.  I don't think that that's something that we
should try to get excited about watching, like boxing or some sport.  I don't
agree with that and I don't even think that they need to have more than just a
couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be, I think
it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be.  #But#
--

A.40:  #Um.#

B.41:  -- I don't believe in keeping all these prisoners.  What do you think?

A.42:  [Smack] Uh, [inhaling] if it's death, let's get it over and done with.  Uh,
the appeal process should be speeded up quite [noise] quite quickly.  They had
this guy on the, uh, news that's been around since seventy-six and he's cost us
over four million dollars so far.

B.43:  Right.

A.44:  Uh, let's speed it up.  Be sure it's as close to being accurate as
possible, get it over and done with.  On the other hand it may not be capital
punishment if you committed armed robbery and you get caught, you shouldn't be
out.  You shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or ten days.  That
maybe off the subject but, uh, 

B.45:  Oh, I think,

A.46:  [Breathing].

B.47:  that there should be capital punishment even for other things.

A.48:  Oh yeah.

B.49:  I think that somebody that's caught selling drugs.  If, that shouldn't be
capital punishment, but if they are the high ones that are making these drugs
and importing them --

A.50:  Um.

B.51:  -- I think that you could consider that --

A.52:  #Oh, I, I,#

B.53:   -- #because in essence# they're taking lives.

A.54:  I'd go with the ones on the street corner [laughter].

B.55:  Because people are thinking, you know, what am I going to get, five years
if I'm caught #so what's the big# --

A.56:  #No, yeah.#

B.57:  -- deal?

A.58:  Start at the bottom, start pushing the ones on the street corner.  They'll
run out of supplies.  #I'm# --

B.59:  #Yeah.#

A.60:  -- I'm cruel on that.  Drugs have no place at all.

B.61:  No.

A.62:  No.

B.63:  And, uh, so I, I, I think it could go even father #than# --

A.64:  #Uh-huh.#

B.65:  -- I think that, I don't know.  It's hard.  You don't want to be so mean
that you're, you're doing away with people that have a chance to change, but
then I, you look at the reports of people that are in prison --

A.66:  Right.

B.67:  -- and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they repeat
these offenses.

A.68:  Fairly quickly.  Very quickly.

B.69:  So.

A.70:  I don't have, you know, uh, uh, we're in so much agreement, I guess I will
try to play the devil's advocate.

B.71:  [Laughter].

A.72:  Uh,  

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  As a Christian, I can't even be the devil's adv-, I'm a #Christian# --

B.75:  #(( )).#

A.76:  -- and I still think there's an appropriate place for it.

B.77:  Yeah. #I# --

A.78:  #Uh.#

B.79:  -- I'm a Christian also and that's why you get in the situation where, uh,
[noise] it says how I believe, but if a person's committed murder that's an
unpardonable sin.

A.80:  [Breathing].

B.81:  And so, why should we pardon something that we don't believe our #our Lo-,
God is pardoning?#

A.82:  #Uh-huh, um.# 

B.83:  Do you know what I mean?

A.84:  [Smack] Yeah, I can go along with that.  I just wish that we could get, uh,
uh, debate going here [laughter] get #some verbal usage for the computer.#

B.85:  #Laughter.#

A.86:  Uh, I have a brother-in-law that is, is strictly opposed to it and, uh, he
is a, uh, very liberal, uh, believer in probation, uh, and convicts not being
sent to prison, but being sent to, uh, halfway houses,
