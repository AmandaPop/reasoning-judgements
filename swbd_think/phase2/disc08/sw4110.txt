A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  So, uh, what are your camping experiences like?  

A.3:  [Laughter] Lately they haven't been much, but as a child, I used to go
camping a lot with my, my parents.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  We would, uh, we lived in Mississippi then and we'd go out and camp for the
weekend and fish and, but we camped like in tents, not in, uh, the mobile home
or the,

B.6:  Oh, yeah, you roughed it.  

A.7:  Right [laughter].  

B.8:  Ba-,

A.9:  That's what I consider really camping [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah.  I, the only real camping experiences, uh, I've had I guess was
probably with the Cub Scouts or the Boy Scouts --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- when I, I was younger.  Uh, we use-, I remember one time we went to, uh,
uh, there's a lake called Lake ((Lanier)) here in Georgia that we went to and
we camped out on the island and we kind of,

A.13:  Got familiar with that lake [laughter].  

B.14:  Yeah, we, we set up all our, you know, we, we canoed out to some island
and, uh, that was a lot of fun set up,

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  Because we were all, we were isolated from everyone else, but, uh, that's
pretty much, I haven't been, lately I've, I've wanted to lately, but there's
a, I'd like to, I need to get some equipment first and I don't really have the
money for it now.  I've, I've been looking into, like, buying a, uh, a tent of
some sort, but they're really expensive, like --

A.17:  They are.  

B.18:  -- the good ones.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  So that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style, so, late, lately I've
just kind of, for outdoorsy type stuff I've pretty much been, you know, one
day trips where I'll, I'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in, uh,
northern Alabama.  I'm into rock climbing a little bit, so --

A.21:  Oh, that's neat.  

B.22:  -- so if, one of my roommates has some ropes and stuff and sometimes we go
up there and climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day
affair, it's not a overnighter type thing.  But I'd like to, I'd like to
really get into that kind of thing.

A.23:  Yeah, well, lately, about my only halfway experience with camping is we,
uh, [lipsmack] my husband races cars --

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  -- and, fact, we come to Atlanta for about ten days every year --

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  

A.27:  -- and [laughter] that's part of, my camping experience is,

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  we camp out there a little bit, sleep in our van or [laughter] --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- what have you for a few nights and, uh, -- 

B.32:  I, 

A.33:  -- kind of cook out of it and what have you but, 

B.34:  The last, the last true camping experience I had is when, uh, I drove
across country with a friend of mine.  He l-, he goes to school out in
California and we drove his car out there and, uh, we drove, you know, we took
kind of a scenic route, we went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon and --

A.35:  Oh, sounds nice.  

B.36:  -- and, uh, someone, one of us had a tent, but not all of us had sleeping
bags and it was kind of a, it was late summer, but it get, g-, got really cold
at night, a lot colder than we thought it would --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- so, the sleeping bag was just big enough to, was just small enough so
that it didn't act-, cover everyone,

A.39:  [Laughter]. 

B.40:  so it was kind of, uh, a wrestling match for the [laughter], for, uh, you
know, warmth.  So, we, we, we, we roughed it until about [breathing] four in
the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and got in the car and,
uh, drove on.  We were on a, kind of a s-, tight schedule anyway, so, we
couldn't stay too long, but we drove on that morning to, uh, Las Vegas, so
[laughter] I think that was probably my last, uh, true camping experience.

A.41:  Well, well, whenever I mention camping anymore to my husband, he says, I'm
too old for this #[laughter].#

B.42:  #[Laughter].#

A.43:  He says I, I like my luxuries anymore, but I think I'd still like to, you
know, do a little camping that --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- like I say, I, it brings back memories of my real young years and, uh,
he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping
anyway #[laughter].#

B.46:  #[Laughter].#

A.47:  True camping.  

B.48:  Well, this time of year, it's, I, it's, gets really beautiful down, the
springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and --

A.49:  I bet.  

B.50:  -- there's all kinds of, it's, north, there's really some real beautiful
spots to, to hike and stuff in north Georgia, you know, up in the, kind of
getting up the mountainous know the,

A.51:  Uh-huh, well, I know when the leaves change there, too, would be a pretty
time.

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  Except -- 

B.54:  It sure is.  

A.55:  -- you can't really depend on your weather [laughter].  

B.56:  That's true, like today it's, it's pouring.  It, it takes, the leaves
around here, I mean, it's beautiful when they, uh, when they change.  It seems
like it happens so fast that --

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- if you don't get there at the right time, you're going to miss
everything.

A.59:  And the first year we came up there the leaves were changing, and since
then we've been coming a week or so too early [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  But, uh, I would think that, that would be a -- 

B.62:  They're getting,

A.63:  -- really nice place for camping.  

B.64:  They're getting started early this year, I'll tell you that much.  The,

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  so the dogwoods are starting to bloom.  

A.67:  Have they?  

B.68:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.69:  Oh, that is really nice.  Well, I'm sure there are a lot of camping places
around here, but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get, take time
to [noise] go out and enjoy them.  Uh, in the spring, when the bluebonnets are
pretty here, I think that's our biggest deal.

B.70:   Uh-huh.

A.71:   There's just fields of bluebonnets and -- 

B.72:   That would be nice.  

A.73:   -- what we call Indian paint brushes.  It's, it's really nice. 

B.74:   I haven't been through that part of the country, so I don't
really know what, I don't really know what it's like over there.  

A.75:   Mostly nothing [laughter].
