===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, uh, I guess since I called I will start out with my feelings
about it.  Uh, I think it is absolutely essential that some, so-, at least
some employees of government agencies and companies be tested, especially when
it effects public safety.  I mean the military obviously, uh, people that run
trains, airplanes, and the like.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Uh, for others, I don't know.  I don't feel as strong about it.  Uh, I
really don't have any objection to it, but I can't really say I am for it
either.  What's your feeling?

B.4:  Well, uh, it, it, it's become sort of a topic where I sit there and I have
a knee jerk reaction and then I have a [laughter] a reaction that I have to
think about it a little longer.  Uh, for me, [inhaling] I guess I feel like we
have, uh, that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a,
a, uh, society where uh everything is is uh regulated.  Uh, I think you're
right about, uh, certain jobs and, uh, certainly something like, uh, a bus,
train, pilots.  Uh, it's obviously something that's a necessity.  It cause it
would be functioning at the job within all, it, pretty much.  Everyone in the
world, uh, would admit to the fact [noise] that the drugs might impair their
abilities.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Okay.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  And like so in some ways I am agreeing with you, uh, that those would be
something that should continue to have, uh, drug testing.  Of course, it
certainly isn't acceptable for an Eastern pilot to, uh, have just had eight
martinis before he went off to fly.

A.9:  Right.  [laughter] Or Northwest.  I think Northwest has had a lot of
problems with that.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  I, uh, I have been in two,

B.12:  [Throat_clearing].

A.13:  two situations where I have had to under go drug testing, drug testing.  I
was in the military for a number of years --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and then I worked four years, uh, as an, uh, electrical inspector, uh,
in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases, uh, you know,
we were subject to, uh, to random testing for drugs and I know a lot of people
refused to, a lot, especially the nuclear plant or would, uh, you know,
strongly object to it but, 

B.16:  [Throat_clearing].

A.17:  you know, I can see the need for it so I, I went along with it.  I think if
I were a clerical worker for instance though, uh, and really couldn't effect
anybody else, I'm not sure that I,

B.18:  I think that it might be inappropriate for us to say, for me to say, that
in any in any industry, uh, something, uh, uh, see you're talking about a
plant --

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  -- where okay if you're a nuclear inspector --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- or where you're a, uh, person who works on safety features for nuclear
inspection, well that makes sense --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- but, uh, we're talking about, you're saying well, uh, I think, uh, you
just stated the same thing.  That if you were a cler-, yo-, you know clerical
person or a secretary there --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and now where is the justification?

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  Wh-, what, okay, you know, [laughter] let's say that we can yo-, you had
had a, uh, you went to a party and, uh, not, not that anyone ever does it, but
you were smoking pot --

A.29:  Huh.  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- uh, now how is that going to make any difference, you know, unless you
ve-, unless you, uh, uh, P C P does exist apparently in the blood stream --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- for a long period of time --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- but the ability for you to function seems to be, uh, very it's very
questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you,

A.35:  Right.  Probably alcohol has more of an effect --

B.36:  #Right.#

A.37:  -- #for# for a shorter period of time.

B.38:  [Laughter] So, bu-, I just went through one recently --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and, uh, the place.  I just transferred jobs not too long ago --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and so I went through the whole process --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and the, there's really no justification whatsoever for why I had to do
it --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- I mean, uh, it's a company that, it's basically a, oh [noise] management
engineering company.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  #So they# --

B.48:  #Now,# 

A.49:  -- were doing it just to, uh, they wanted to make sure that their employees
were productive probably.  That's --

B.50:  Uh, wait.  But then --

A.51:  -- that's probably #why they justified it.#

B.52:  -- #but then, but then# if you if you're saying that [laughter] uh,
[laughter] --

A.53:  No, I am just trying to imagine #why they would want to test you.#

B.54:  -- #that should also regu-.# Right.  What, they should also regulate how
many hours of sleep I must have --

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  -- they should also regulate how much, what kind of nutrition I have --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- they should also regu-, see it's, it's a disturbing trend.

A.59:  Yeah.  I, I think that people who do something that could hurt somebody
else --

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  -- uh, should be subject to the testing.  I guess that's probably the way I
determine and I am talking about bus drivers, as you mentioned and pilots and
what have you.  Uh, others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say,
uh,
