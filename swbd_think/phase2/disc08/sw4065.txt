A.1:  Okay.  Well how do you feel about, uh, drug testing?  Uh, for professions,

B.2:  Well, I, I think, my feelings on it are, it depends I think if it's
necessary if you have the kind of job that requires you to always be, you kn-,
like police officers, firemen, doctors, anybody who has, you know, who's
impor-, whose decisions are important and all, you know.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  That's what I think as far as you are required to not only be at work when
you're not at work as it were.  You know what I'm saying?  If you,

A.5:  Oh, I see.  Uh, twenty-four hour people you mean.

B.6:  Yeah, people who, who could be at work at any time --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- when they aren't at work, but I don't see the point in it, if you're, if
you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Then, I, I just don't see what merit you're going to have from gaining,
what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business,
I think.  I think that's an infringement upon your personal rights.

A.13:  Uh-huh [inhaling].

B.14:  That's an invasion of your personal privacy.  That's, if they were to
decide that you shouldn't be drinking would they just, you know, I mean you
have to draw the line somewhere.  I think and give people the right to do what
they need to do --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and what they want to do.

A.17:  Would you, uh, would you do it before they were employed or would #you say
random testing# --

B.18:  #Yes, I, okay I'm, I'm, I'm# --

A.19:  -- is also okay.

B.20:  -- I, I think that's fine.  I think if you, if it matters to you that much
then you should you know, I mean if you want to weed out those kind of people
right from the start, I have no problem with that --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- because you don't, you don't want somebody who is a drug user starting
work for you, but I don't, I don't think that they can just come back and get
you anytime --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- you know I, I don't think it it could be surprise at your door.  Here we
are, you know or --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- or come to, show up for work one day and then just say here you go.  Uh,
uh, I don't know it's kind of a,

A.27:  It's a hard problem, isn't it?

B.28:  Yeah --

A.29:  Because --

B.30:  -- it's really, you know,

A.31:  -- because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs.

B.32:  Yeah, exactly.

A.33:  But at the same time, that's that's that's an embarrassing humiliating kind
of test to have to take.  People questioning you by --

B.34:  Yes.

A.35:  -- you know by doing that.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  It's, yeah, it's kind of a do you you trust me, do you not trust
me.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  You know it's, I don't know.  I, I don't really.  It's awfully, it has it's
points, it's good points and it's bad points and it kind of makes us look like
we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world is
going almost.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  You know, I've, walls are coming come down in Berlin and,

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  we [laughter] --

A.43:  [Laughter]  And we're, and we're getting,

B.44:  -- and here we are.  We are going the other way.

A.45:  It does feel like it, doesn't it?

B.46:  Yeah it does.

A.47:  I know.

B.48:  I don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem.

A.49:  Well, it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring.
Doctors have been on drugs for years [laughter] as [laughter] from what I
hear.

B.50:  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.51:  You know and, and, uh, we've, we have all sorts of people have done things
and I am certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they have
performed and then they say well if I did what I was suppose to do and did it
the way I was suppose to do it, then, why would you, you know, whose business
is it.

B.52:  Yeah, who am I harming as long as I am doing my job.

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  And yet, the potential, like I don't like knowing that there might be an
alcoholic who is flying my plane or, or --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- you know, cutting into my body.

B.58:  Yeah, exactly.  You don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he is
going to be cutting on you that day.  That's for sure so, I, you know, that is
difficult, you are going to, you can't, but then that just kind of comes back
to personal responsibilities.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  You, but I guess that's [laughter] more or less forcing you to be
personally responsible for yourself.

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  It's basically all that they are trying to do with that and if you want to,
after you look at it that way, because you would think your doctor wouldn't be
out drinking at night before --

A.63:  That's right.  #That's right.#

B.64:  -- #but if# he thought he could get caught doing it, then he certainly
wouldn't do it as opposed to well it's not a big operation tomorrow, what the
heck.

A.65:  [Laughter] It's old, only old lady so and so from where ever.

B.66:  Yeah, it's just a gallbladder and [laughter],

A.67:  [Laughter]  Right [laughter].

B.68:  You know, no problem.

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  I guess that's just, that's basically what they're doing then, just forcing
you to be responsible.

A.71:  [Inhaling].

B.72:  But, I guess some people have to be forced so,  

A.73:  Yeah, it and it does, it does make you wonder because I am not sure, I was
trying to think in, in history has have people checked that or did people
just, did people just accept the responsibility or are we able to test things
now that never could be tested before so therefore we are using technology in
a way that it #wasn't available before.#

B.74:  #That was-, yeah wasn't.# Yeah, that's, I don't know.  I, I kind of think
well it's partially because we have the technology now, but it's also because
I think moral standards have gone [laughter] down hill quite a bit since
earlier.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  You know, I mean it's --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- it's just reached that point where society accepts, you know, you don't
think about seeing your doctor our at a bar anymore.

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  Whereas, you know, in nineteen forty, doctor so and so,
