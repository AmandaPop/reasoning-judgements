============================================================================

A.1:  ((Well)) it's, uh, I'll start off here.  Uh, I don't know.  I get,
probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N.  Uh,
I like C N N because it, uh, [sniffing] you know, repeats it, well HEADLINE
NEWS repeats every half hour #but it# --

@B.2:  #Right, yeah.#

A.3:  -- makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule and,
uh, but the newspaper p-, provides a little bit of #depth# --

B.4:  #Yeah.#

A.5:  -- that you can't really get from,

B.6:  I, I think I'd agree.  A, a s-, similar method of getting the news with me
too.  It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to [laughter] (( )) the
T V #scene here in the,#

A.7:  #[Laughter].#

B.8:  last, uh, number of years.  Uh, p-, prior to cable, you know, you didn't
get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature and, and I like, uh, C N N
because you get some world, world events too --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so
forth.

A.13:  Right.  Yeah.  I know, the, my only major objection is that, uh, I don't
think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors
like Mexico and Canada.  #Uh,#

B.14:  #That,# that's true, you know.  You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles
about the, uh, either the economics or, or other wor-, news events going on in
either of those countries.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.16:  #Uh,# whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the
surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh,
articles in them.

A.17:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems
now with, with Quebec and, and everything and, uh, it's amazing that, you
know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know, I mean the
most they'll give it is the back of the A section.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Uh, you #know.#

B.20:  #I'm,# I'm currently living in Dallas and it, it won't even give it the
back section #[laughter].  You just,#

A.21:  #[Laughter].#

B.22:  never see, you just never see anything about it, uh, which is a shame
because you go to other countries, uh, and, and they carry quite a bit about
the U S on the other hand.  And if you go up to, uh, Canada, [noise] those
people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and #and
the# --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- news (( )) U S and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of
leaders up in Canada or Mexico.

A.25:  Yeah, definitely.

B.26:  You just don't know what's going on.  

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  I'd, I, every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas and lately I've
taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C
and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too.  You --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- you can tune into some stations and you get some, like thirty minute
summaries of, of news events.  Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle
eastern, uh, area and that's the only way you can tell [laughter] #what's
going on at all [laughter].#

A.31:  #[Laughter].#

B.32:  There's not much in the way of television in #some# --

A.33:  #Right.#

B.34:  -- of those places.  Uh, but that's a good point about, about the
neighboring countries.  I hadn't really thought about it but I guess you don't
think about it cause you don't hear it.

A.35:  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.  Uh,
well part of it, touring.  And, uh, you know, i-, I was amazed cause I'd pick
up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting
things going on.  There's some serious talk about whether there's actually
going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  You know, because of the problems with Quebec and n-, I had never heard any
of that before.

B.38:  Yeah, you know, there was, a, a, what is it called, is it Meech Lake
Accord?

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Or, or, i-, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people
here would never have heard of and I think that I heard of it about the first
time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up
a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.  And, and
c-, came (( )), it was a big thing going on there and I came back here and
nothing in the papers.

A.41:  Right, right.

B.42:  I didn't see a thing about it.  So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I
guess.  It's improved.  And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable
news.  Even, even there's, uh, uh, it's sor-, it's semireligious in some
respects.  But what is it?  It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,
uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.  The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
MONITOR.

A.43:  Oh, yeah.

B.44:  Uh, I, it surprised me.  I've caught it a few times and they, they do some
pretty good news.  Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.  Uh --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.  You'd think it
would carry mostly religious but it, it doesn't seem to.  So I'll flip through
and [throat_clearing] listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something
maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.  Uh, some more
in-, interest type topics in, in other countries.  But it's kind of world,
world, uh, network too.

A.47:  Yeah.  Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.  I used to get the, uh,
