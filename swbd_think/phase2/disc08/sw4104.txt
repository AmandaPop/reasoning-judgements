==========================================================================

A.1:  Anyway, uh [breathing].

B.2:  How about you.  What do you do with your budget?

@A.3:  What do I do, uh, at the moment it's under chaos.  [laughter] Uh, [smack]
right now I'm just, uh, I, I don't really have a budget per se.  I'm, I, uh,
it's called living within your means [laughter].

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  [Laughter] You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill
and keeping everything else under control [inhaling] and hoping the car
doesn't collapse [laughter].

B.6:  Yeah.  That's true.

A.7:  Uh, but, uh, no I don't really have a budget at the moment.  Uh, but I have
uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month
and then I don't, [inhaling] usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the
VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car
expenses and then that, then it goes through the moon, so.

B.8:  Yeah, that's sort of a problem.

A.9:  Yeah, so uh, #what do yo-,#

B.10:  #We're trying,# we're trying to, uh, so far we are in the clear credit
wise but, uh, the other side of it is, so, not much on that side of it
[laughter] to add to it.  We're trying to think of how to put away some
savings and stuff like that but,

A.11:  So you can afford to get a house?

B.12:  Yeah, we'd like to do that some day.

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  We have this dream.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  But, we don't know how long it will be a dream.

A.17:  [Inhaling].

B.18:  We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt, but
we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy
right now so --

A.19:  Yeah.

@@B.20:  -- we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to
save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every
month.

A.21:  So, what do you and your husband do?

B.22:  We're missionaries actually.

A.23:  [Smack] Are you really?

B.24:  Yeah, uh-huh.  And, uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we
have, uh, like, uh, uh, support quota --

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  -- and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here.

A.27:  #No kidding.#

B.28:  #And# it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home.

A.29:  I see. 

B.30:  So,

A.31:  Overseas, where would you be going?

B.32:  Africa, Nigeria.

A.33:  [Smack] Really.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  Really.  How long would you be there?

B.36:  About four years.  We're career so, we, we go over seas for four years and
then we come back for a year.  We go over four, we come back for a year.

A.37:  With, with what Church?

B.38:  Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators.

A.39:  Oh yes.  #Yes,# -- 

B.40:  #So.#

A.41:  -- I, uh, I know who they are.  They, uh, [inhaling] they have an office,
uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall.

B.42:  Yeah, they could very well #and,# 

A.43:  #There,# there was, uh, you know, there was a fairly large building that
that was well that belongs to them.  So, uh, are you, uh, are you, uh, active
in translation?

B.44:  Uh, we will be.  I was over, over four years doing language surveying which
is the first step.  You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team
and assesses the need.

A.45:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.46:  And, uh, came home and got married and we will go ba-, back as translators
cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as
translators.  Well, I always wanted to do translation, but as long as I was
single and foot loose so to speak it's easier.  You know they really need
surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere.  You don't have
kids hanging around you and stuff.

A.47:  True, true enough.  So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak
besides English, of course?

B.48:  Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones, but there's, I'm not
bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other,
you know, since I did --

A.49:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.50:  -- you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other.  So I
know the greetings in about ten,

A.51:  [Breathing].

B.52:  and how to do market stuff, but in about, uh, about five I guess, I can do
better in it.  And my French is pretty good but it's, uh, (( )) French so, uh,
I'm terrified to speak in, uh --

A.53:  In France.

B.54:  -- in France.  Yeah, because they're real snobby about their language and
(( )) French is street French and I just picked it up off the street and I
knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating, but I didn't know what I was
saying.  I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something
here when I came home and French to somebody and he paled and said, uh, I'm not
going to tell you what you said.  So, [noise] since then I have refrained from
speaking any French [laughter].

A.55:  [Laughter] [breathing].

B.56:  So.  [laughter]  In (( )) [laughter].

A.57:  Uh,

B.58:  I don't know what I said to him but, uh, I didn't ask him either.

A.59:  Must have been terrible.  The, uh, [smack] was it Henry Macon said that
the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death.  So they
hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and I,
it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that.  Free style English is
just, takes on,
