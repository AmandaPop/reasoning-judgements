REMARKS:        Speaker B was very difficult to transcribe -- he
mumbled and stammered a lot and dominated the conversation.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, uh, let's see, when it comes to, to, uh, sentencing, I, I'm a little
confused because the, the only things that I read about sentencing and juries,
well, the only things I know are the things that I read and the things that I
read are, are either, how should I say it, they're, they're written by people
that, that have an ax to grind, so if somebody thinks that the judge is,
judges are too lenient, why I read all kinds of, let's throw them all in jail
and then if I, I've, I've read other things that, I, I wish I could see a, uh,
an informed, uh, discussion as opposed to just what I see these days as one
side, you know, some, one side's mad --

A.2:  Uh-huh.  

B.3:  -- and, uh, so, I, uh, I, I guess what I'm trying to say is, uh, I have
mixed feelings because sometimes I think that the judges, uh, are overstepping
their bounds and they shouldn't be, the juries should be the only ones that,
uh, have a say in it and other times I think, well, no, the juries are out of
hand, the judges need to step in.

A.4:  Yeah, a-, you know, the, it comes down to a hard call because, uh, I, now,
I'm personally have never served on a jury and I've been in school and so
that's waived my jury duty and so exactly some of the procedures that they go
through for the jury, uh, as far as sentencing goes, I'm not real clear on,
but from I understand, there's sometimes whenever the juries make the verdict,
I mean the, uh, the sentencing and sometimes they don't.

B.5:  On the case, I've remember reading, a, a discussion about a jury that,
that, uh, [lipsmack] heard a case and they, and they awarded, uh, how should
I say it, they agreed that the one person was guilty and they, and they agreed
that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside
the judgement which, t-, the way the article was written was a terrible
injustice.

A.6:  Oh, really?  

B.7:  Uh, but, like I say, I, there's, I rarely see, uh, both sides of that.  I
just hear about it from one side.  I don't hear the other side.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  The, the one thing that I am kind of upset about is the fact that juries
are selected, uh, to be the lowest [breathing], uh, how should I say this,
they have any opinions at all, they're weeded out been one or the other of
the, uh, of the lawyers.

A.10:  Oh, yeah, yeah.   

B.11:  And so, to be honest with you, I've [breathing], I've, uh, I don't think
that's right and if I ever am called to be a, a juror and they ask me if I
have strong opinions I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm,

A.12:  You'll,    

B.13:  Huh [laughter]?  

A.14:  You'll probably be weeded out, huh [laughter]?  

B.15:  Well, (( )) {mumbling} if I answer {mispronounced} honestly, if I answer
honestly I'll be weeded out.  If I, if I, just like ((came)) and say, uh, no,
I don't have strong opinions because I feel like, you know, I want to be part
of the process --

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  -- and, uh, like I say, it bothers me that, that, uh, that the [breathing]
lawyers can weed anybody with a college education or anybody, uh, [breathing]
oh, let's say with a, with any college educa-, you know, much schooling, or
certain a-, uh, [lipsmack] uh, backgrounds, like, for instance, if you're a
[breathing], if you've go to church once a [breathing], a, a month or
something like that, why, they don't want you on the jury or, you know, things
like that.  It, it bothers me that, that, that we're judging people on the
basis of, of, uh, what do you call it, uh, 

A.18:  On, on, on what they do and, and,

B.19:  No, well, what I'm trying to say is, the jury, jurors are selected to
basically be, from what I've been told, milk toasts.  If they have any
opinions, if they could understand anything, an engineer could never be, uh, a
juror, for instance, because he's, he's, uh, he's not easily, uh --

A.20:  Persuaded?  

B.21:  -- persuaded, or, or -- 

A.22:  Yeah.  

B.23:  -- or, how shall I say this, th-, it's easy to hoodwink or it's, it's hard
to hoodwink him, that kind of thing.

A.24:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.25:  So, that's what I'm kind of worried about.  

A.26:  Well, I think in a way, it also depends on what kind of trial it is.  Uh,
because sometimes, you know, if, if it's dealing w-, with a more technical
thing, such as like a malpractice, not, not,

B.27:  [Sneezing]. 

A.28:  like a criminal suit, you're going to have to have somebody that, that can
understand the, uh, like the medical or the legal implications.

B.29:  Right, uh, that's what you want.  

A.30:  You know.  

B.31:  But, on the other hand if the lawyer thinks, no, I don't want a bunch of
people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through the, uh, you
know, to weed the good from the bad --

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  -- they will absolutely go for people who, uh, how should I say it, the s-,
the scrub women and the, the janitors.  I'm, I'm --

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  -- trying not to be prejudiced against them, but, you know, any education
will disqualify you in, in many cases, I've been,
