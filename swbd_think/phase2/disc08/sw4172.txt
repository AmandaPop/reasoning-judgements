A.1:  So, do you do any?  

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  Well,   

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  It's kind of, I do when I don't, uh, I, I go in spurts unfortunately.  I --

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- can't get as, as regular and dedicated as, as I probably should.

A.9:  Yeah, well, it's, it's hard to get, uh, it's hard to maintain a, a real
level of, uh, I don't know what you'd call it, I guess motivation.

B.10:  W-,   

A.11:  At least for me it is.  

B.12:  Where -- 

A.13:  I mean,   

B.14:  -- where you are, you probably have to, you know, the weather probably
doesn't cooperate with you so you would have to belong to a gym or something
and,

A.15:  Yeah, I actually, I lift weights pretty regular now, and I have done it for
the last, oh, I don't know, ten, twelve years.  So it works pretty well for
me, but still, it's like you say, the motivation is not always there,
especially in the cold weather.

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  And I'm not real used to the cold up here anyway just because I'm from
Florida really.

B.18:  Oh, gosh.  

A.19:  So,  

B.20:  [Laughter].  

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  That was a shock I bet.  

A.23:  Yeah, a bit, a bit, so, uh, but, I don't know, it's, it's good to get a,
you get that good feeling, you know, when you get done and, and you're glad
you did it, I guess, but, uh,

B.24:  Well, growing up, I was always, uh, fairly athletic and always, uh, you
know, I didn't really have to think about an exercise routine --

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  -- because I was always doing something that more or less required
exercise.

A.27:  Sure.  

B.28:  But, uh, I've been in a job lately where I've been working some really long
hours and --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- some nights and weekends and,

A.31:  That makes it rough because then,

B.32:  It makes y-, you lose every bit of muscle tone you ever thought about
having.

A.33:  Sure.  

B.34:  And then to try and work your way back from that is [laughter] --

A.35:  Yeah that,  

B.36:  -- is why I can't really get, I will start up and I will do pretty
religiously and then I'll have to work till midnight one night --

A.37:  Right and that just screws up your -- 

B.38:  -- or something and then -- 

A.39:  -- whole schedule.  

B.40:  -- you know, [chiming] oops, are you there?  

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  Oh, I don't know what that was [laughter].  

A.43:  Oh, wow, you're sounding a lot clearer now [laughter].  

B.44:  I think there's something wrong with the phone or something.  I think
sometimes when they connect it up it, it doesn't work right or, or something's
not exactly right.

A.45:  Oh, yeah.

B.46:  [Sniffing].

A.47:  That's pretty weird.  Uh, but, yeah, I, I don't know, I, I do a lot of
stuff, or I, at least I have in the past done a lot of weird, a lot of
different activities.  Uh, and moving down here is, in a way kind of, or
moving up here is pretty bad because I can't do as much as I used to --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- because the weather just doesn't permit it.  

B.50:  Sure.  

A.51:  You know, so,  

B.52:  ((I mean)), like if your favorite thing is swimming [laughter],

A.53:  Exactly, and, and it is, you know, I mean,

B.54:  You'd have to join a, you know, a, some club that has a pool and then you
have to fight the crowds and --

A.55:  Exactly, y-,

B.56:  -- that sort of thing.  

A.57:  It's just a hassle at times.  

B.58:  Everybody I know that belongs to a health club here in Dallas, the better
ones are always crowded at the times when you'd be in more s-, you know more
likely --

A.59:  Sure.  

B.60:  -- #to use it, like# -- 

A.61:  #Everybody gets off of work.#  

B.62:  -- right after work or,

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  you know, during lunch hours, or, you know --

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  -- right before work and that sort of thing so people end up exercising --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- at really odd hours.  

A.69:  Sure.  

B.70:  And I can't exercise, you know, late at night because it keeps me awake.

A.71:  Oh, yeah?  

B.72:  I mean, ((you know)) once you, you know, I've got, I bought myself a, one
of these little, uh, they call it a cross trainer or something like that.
It's got, uh,

A.73:  Kind of like a Soloflex or something?  

B.74:  Yeah, it's got, uh, and it's got a stair climber and it's got the, the kind
of bench and you can do the leg lifting things and the --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- the bench press thing, and it's got a butterfly thing and --

A.77:  Oh, that's good.   

B.78:  -- you know, it's got a lot of different stuff on it and I mainly got it
because, you know, like I say, since I've gotten so out of shape and
everything --

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  -- I forget and I will do something, not thinking about that I,

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  don't have the muscle to do it anymore -- 

A.83:  Right.  

B.84:  -- and I injured my rotator cup on one arm -- 

A.85:  Uh-oh.  

B.86:  -- really badly and the doctor was kind of like, well, you know, you're
going to have to --

A.87:  Learn to take it easy.  

B.88:  -- get some, yeah, get s-, build up some muscle tone in, in your upper arms
or it's going to always be a problem and it might have to be operated on and
--

A.89:  Right.  

B.90:  -- you know, all this kind of stuff, so, you know, I, I got this machine to
try to, because I, I, one thing I did kind of keep up doing was I like to walk
--

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- and I like to ride my bicycle, so when the weather's okay, you know, I
can do that.

A.93:  Sure.  

B.94:  But, uh, you know, having to do something for the shoulder or the arm or
something, I, I had to get a machine to do that.

A.95:  Right.  

B.96:  But --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- so I have it in my house because I know if I had to get home from work,
change clothes and go somewhere to a club I just wouldn't do it.

A.99:  Right, yeah, it, it would be too much of a hassle.  

B.100:  And when, when you're working really hard and you come in the door, you
don't want to turn around and go back out again [laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter]. 

B.102:  [Laughter].  

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  I mean, I have enough trouble, you know, just doing, I do a lot of
volunteer work and --

A.105:  Oh, you do?  

B.106:  -- and some stuff like that.  It, it's all I can do just to force myself to
turn around, go back out, and do that kind of stuff.

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  So, you know,

A.109:  Yeah, it, when I'm living in Florida, I'm, I'm an intern up here at
Honeywell, and when I live in Florida, it's, it's a lot easy, you know, it's,
everything's nice out and my parents live down there now, and my dad's been
getting into roller blading lately.  He roller blades all around, I don't know
if that's popular where you're at.

B.110:  It,
