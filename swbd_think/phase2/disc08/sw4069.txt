===========================================================================

A.1:  I'm an avid recycler.  Uh, but our city's not doing as much as they ought
to.  What about you all there?

@B.2:  There is a group in town called Nacogdoches Recycles that will meet, I
believe it's once a month --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- at the park and you can take plastics, papers or bottles.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  [Swallowing] But it's up to you to collect them.  It's up to you to get
them down there and then what they do with them I don't know.

A.7:  You don't know [laughter].  Yeah.

B.8:  There isn't any, y-, somebody had talked once before to City Council
meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans.

A.9:  Right.  That they pick up?

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  So they do that in Palestine?

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And nobody wanted to go for that.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  They were going to charge a little extra --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- on the bill and nobody wanted to do that.

A.19:  Nobody wanted to do it.

B.20:  And I save aluminum cans and #to take those to the# --

A.21:  #Do you have a place# to take them?

B.22:  -- to the closest place is about, it's about thirty minutes away.

A.23:  Wow!  Is that right?

B.24:  Yeah.  And it, and the last time we took some things, the price is not
really worth #it [laughter].#

A.25:  #Worth it.  Yeah.#  Not worth the gas, huh?

B.26:  Yeah, yeah.  Cause --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- by the time and you save them and squish them and --  

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- they're just, they were everywhere.

A.31:  Ye-, oh, I know, I know it.

B.32:  And that's the bad thing about it.  And newspapers, we, we started saving
newspapers and stuff.  Well they just packed up and I have cats.  Well they
had a field day.

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  Destroyed those.

A.35:  Now what do they do?  I have cats too but they don't do anything with
newspaper.

B.36:  Mine have some kind of paper thing.  

A.37:  Oh really?

B.38:  Oh, yes.  Any, any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up.

A.39:  With their claws #or chew it?#

B.40:  #Uh-huh.  Both.#

A.41:  How fascinating.

B.42:  I don't know what it is.

A.43:  [Laughter] Oh, isn't that interesting?  I've got three cats but newspapers
don't seem to interest them at all.

B.44:  I don't know what it is.  And you can't leave the mail.  #Don't (( )).#

A.45:  #Oh, no [laughter].#

B.46:  Don't leave the mail on, on the coffee table #or it's chewed up.#

A.47:  #Is that right?#  Oh my gosh.

B.48:  And it was just really one.  I've got, I've got several and one in
particular but then she kind of showed the other ones #what was going on.#

A.49:  #And then they learned how# huh.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  So now it's just a big play, play time.

A.51:  Well, that's funny.  Well I, I, we, we do have more facilities than that
around here so that, we, they are, they are trying in Dallas to do some, uh,
curbside recycling.  They've got s-, special,

B.52:  [Static].

A.53:  you know, they selected sites and in those sites their, they've been doing
it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about, you know,
doing it more.  But it isn't in my area so I've got a kitchen full of, you
know, cans and bottles and scrap metal and everything and, and then I have to
drive it somewhere.

B.54:  Yeah.  #I think# --

A.55:  #And there,# 

B.56:  -- if they would make it a little more convenient for us --

A.57:  Then --

B.58:  -- everybody would.

A.59:  -- everybody would do.  Well it's one of those things that makes you feel
good, you know.  Makes you feel like you're part of, of a, of a solution to a
problem.

B.60:  That's true.

A.61:  And, and, uh, there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any
control over anything #[laughter] so.#

B.62:  #Oh, I know.# And we take the little plastic bags back to the, the #grocery
store.#

A.63:  #Back to your grocery.#  So your grocery store does that?  

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well that's #good.#

B.66:  #But,# but as far as bottles and things go, there isn't any place any, any
close.

A.67:  And that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally
recyclable.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  They're the easiest --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- and, and, uh, you know, I mean I try to keep and reuse and I, oh, I even
carry around, uh, you know, if, I, I, I travel around the city a lot so that
I'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating [laughter] in the car or
on the way to the next site --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and I've gotten to saving the plastic [sigh] forks and washing them and
using them again so that I don't keep doing that.  But, boy, I mean, it's an
exhausting way to live [laughter].

B.74:  It really is.

A.75:  And we are very use to throwing things out.  There's no question about it.

B.76:  Yeah, I, I've started saving, like you said, the plastic knives and forks
and things and --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- I save all the little condiments and #[laughter] things ((and)) I,# 

A.79:  #Right [laughter].  E-, exactly.# Lots of little, uh, soy sauces and
#catsups all over the place.#

B.80:  #Yeah, things that I normally# threw out.

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  Because they just give you ton, now I've got a big basket full in the
refrigerator.

A.83:  That's right, that's right.  Well, now I've gotten to where I say, don't
put any of that in [laughter].  Cause it just leaves me with having to dispose
of it.

B.84:  Exactly.  They'll say do you want any.  No!  #I do not.#

A.85:  #No.  Please no [laughter].#

B.86:  But I, I try.  And we have a lot of, of newspapers and magazines and things
like that #but [swallowing] that's,#

A.87:  #Yeah.  And# that's hard to get rid of unless you've got, there's one place
here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and cereal boxes
and everything, but you have to drive it downtown and so, you know, my
kitchen, I mean, ((certainly)) I don't like anyone to ever come in because
I've just got this stuff everywhere.  I don't drive it every day so I've got
just #piles of it.#

B.88:  #Yeah.  And# I've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of, you know,
some people will maybe have four bins.

A.89:  #Right.#

B.90:  #One# for your garbage and then [swallowing] #I have no room.#

A.91:  #[Laughter] But you have to move# out of your house to have all that.

B.92:  Yeah.  #I have# --

A.93:  #Yeah.#

B.94:  -- I have room enough for one garbage can and that is it.

A.95:  Yeah, yeah.  I know and it, and it really is hard.  And, and, uh, I, then
I'll fill up the back of my car and [laughter] I'm driving around with trash
in my car.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  And th-, well, at least, maybe it keeps someone from stealing, you know.
Because [laughter] they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash
#[laughter].#

B.98:  #[Laughter]#  And that's true.

A.99:  Anyway,
