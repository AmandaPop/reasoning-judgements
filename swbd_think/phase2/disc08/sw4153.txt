===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Well, um, I used to work in a day care center.  

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  I worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center and
[breathing] it is, they can be deceiving to people.  I did not work there long
because I couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got, and this
is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three,
um, centers,

B.4:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.5:  #all over,# you know, the, um, city and they would, um, be one way when the
parents were there and be another way when the parents left.

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  So, um, I think you need to make, you know, if you do, do day care centers,
you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when
[laughter] they're not expecting it.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Because they do, do things differently when you're not around, so.

B.10:  Well that, I know wh-, the things that we kind of looked at is, is you want
to see how many teachers you have.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  And, and how many kids they have and how they break it up.  

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  Because we had, [throat_clearing] we had one that sounds kind of like what
you were in.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  It, it was a really good one, and in fact, it worked out for us because my
wife, we kind of bartered.  My wife did artwork for them and then, you know,
so we got our day care free.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  But they didn't have enough teachers #and,#

A.19:  #Well,# this one was set up good.  I mean they had two teachers --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- to every room.  Um, sometimes three.  And they had a good system like so
when you walked in, everything looks cool.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children
enough.  They did not show them care to these small children who are being
left.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  Um, they, one time I picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner
came and just chewed me up one side down the other.

B.26:  Huh.  

A.27:  You know, he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to
pick them up.

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  And I said, no, this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,

B.30:  #Yeah.# 

A.31:  #what# is your problem.  So, um,

B.32:  Did, did they separate them by age group?  

A.33:  Yes.  

B.34:  Because I'd think, you know, I think that's one thing that was important.

A.35:  Right.  They did, they had like, um, the, the crawlers, the babies that
didn't walk in one room.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  The ones that were starting to walk in one room.  Then they had like the,
um, three, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower
fives.  You know, just like that.

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  You know, they really did separate them well.  

B.40:  #I-, it sound, yeah,# 

A.41:  #It was just# the teachers themselves.  

B.42:  It sounds like to me your, your concern would be to make sure that they are
loving people.

A.43:  Right.  

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  But, yeah, #that they're not,# 

B.46:  #Affectionate people# that they're, they're kind of par-, 

A.47:  #Yeah.  Their system,# 

B.48:  #may be parents# themselves or something.  

A.49:  Right.  But their, but their system was, was great but, um, the, you know,
[breathing] the caring just wasn't there.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  The one woman that taught that did the babies.  I worked with her and she
was fabulous.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  She loved them babies, and she loved them and cared for them.  But, um,
every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, um, you
know, would make me a nervous wreck, [laughter] so, you know.

B.54:  Yeah.  I, I, I think that's probably a really important thing because you
can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know
all the technical stuff, but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then
that doesn't do any good.

A.55:  Yeah, these kids are just in a day care center all day --

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  -- and, uh, with no, any type of emotional, you know, getting love, getting
care, they're just there.

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  You know.  Going through this routine,

B.60:  #An-,#

A.61:  #which #is lousy.  

B.62:  The other, the other group that we had was kind of interesting.  The other
one we went to the, it was a husband and wife team --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- and we knew them from other associations but, uh, it was kind of
interesting because she was kind of the strict one, and I think, you know, she
would, she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, you know,
but he was actually the more, um, the more, uh, what, demonstrative type.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  The more loving he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the
kids and --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- and i-, it was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the
man in the group that, that did that side of it.  An-, 

A.69:  Yeah, you don't see that much.

B.70:  Yeah, so they had a really nice balance.  We liked that one.  In fact, it
was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,

A.71:  #That's cute.# 

B.72:  #but they also# did, they also did some of the teaching things and then
they had, um, you know, obedience, obedience was important.

A.73:  #Yeah, that has to be with a day care center.# 

B.74:  #And you know so they,# you know, they used, uh, oh, I think they used the,
you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and
get your power back to control yourself.

A.75:  I've never heard of that.  #That's, that's a new one,#

B.76:  #And it's, it's one,#

A.77:  on me.  

B.78:  Uh, I can't remember what they call it actually but y-, you just stand them
in front of a clock and, you know, it has a second-hand that goes around.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  And they have to stand there,
