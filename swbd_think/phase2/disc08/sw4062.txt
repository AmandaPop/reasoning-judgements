B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  I think.

B.3:  Yes, I'm sure that it,

A.4:  Let's see.  I didn't hear the message.  It said, maybe I didn't press it
hard enough.  Let's try again.

B.5:  Okay.

A.6:  [Beep]  Huh.

B.7:  Well, it just that, that, uh, recording would begin when the person who
called #presses# --

A.8:  #Right, okay.#                  

B.9:  -- one but,

A.10:  So, so I will just assume that we are being recorded now.  I thought that
they had a confirmation message when that occurred, but perhaps not.
[inhaling] Anyway, I did press, let me press one once again.

B.11:  Okay.

A.12:  [Beep]  Well, I, I'll take it that that did it.  Okay, so --

B.13:  Okay {very faint}.

A.14:  -- uh, the answer to that well maybe I should answer the question first
since I have had so long to think about it.  Uh, I use a, a program on my
MacIntosh which is called Dollars and Cents.  Actually, it hails from the Bay
Area where you're from and, uh,

B.15:  Oh, I am not in San Francisco.  I am in Frisco, Texas.

A.16:  Oh.  Frisco, Texas.  Uh, gee, I don't even know [laughter],

B.17:  Where are you?

A.18:  Raleigh, North Carolina.

B.19:  Raleigh, North Carolina.  I thought you said Rowlett.

A.20:  [Noise].

B.21:  We have a little town out here [laughter].

A.22:  I see.  Okay, well anyway, it doesn't #hail from the area where you are.#

B.23:  #Yes, okay you know where Dallas is.#

@A.24:  But, uh, uh, anyway and so anyway I use this, uh personal accounting
program on my MacIntosh to keep track of expenses, but it also has a budget
feature, but I don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of
assumptions that I've, the case in my situation so, I use the the little
spread sheets for that.  I don't know.  Actually, I think most people who are
in the series are a little bit familiar with computers, but if you're not let
me know and I will give more explanation.

B.25:  Oh, okay.  I am.  I am familiar with computers.

A.26:  Okay, so have you, do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting?

B.27:  No, we don't.  My husband, uh, takes care of our finances and he just, uh,
just does it all, all manually.  He keeps, uh, a book sort of --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- and he, uh, he doesn't keep it on the computer.  I work with computers
and we have one at home, but he doesn't use it for that.

A.30:  They're fun to do.  It's, uh, well you have a lot more information if you
use a computer, because you just can't keep track of everything manually.
You'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was
and so forth, but --

B.31:  Right.

A.32:  -- if you can just print it out, it gives you a lot better feel for how you
stand compared to last year [noise].  Uh,

B.33:  And that is a software program that was written for your, uh, I mean that
you, 

A.34:  For MacIntosh, yes.

B.35:  Just for MacIntosh.

A.36:  Uh, it's called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is
MANAGING YOUR MONIES, by Andrew Tobias, but I used that one year and it was so
awful that I just gave up [laughter].

B.37:  Too much detail.

A.38:  Excuse me?

B.39:  Was it too much detail to it?

A.40:  It was, well it would bring up a new screen for everything, you know.  You,
you, uh, you would make one en-, like for example if you were reconciling your
check account and you wanted to change a transaction.  Let's say you wanted to
add in interest or put in a c or something.  It took about three screens to do
that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on.  All the
earlier transactions were hidden.  It was just, it, it, you, just --

B.41:  Primitive.

A.42:  -- yeah it had tunnel vision.  I mean it had a lot of features, but they
were all so hard to use that I never [laughter] never really used any of them.
So, I, I read since then though that they re-, redesigned the interface.  So,
probably, it's a little better, uh, than it was before.  Uh, [noise] so, uh,
do, do you do a yearly budget, or a monthly budget or,

B.43:  Uh, I am not sure.  Right now I think he is keeping, he has it, uh, kind of
a forecast out for oh about the next, uh, eighteen months or so.  He keeps
track of all of, uh, you know the payments that are due, when --

A.44:  Huh.

B.45:  -- and, uh, what pays off when and, uh --

A.46:  Right.

B.47:  -- of course, he knows ahead of time about when the, uh, home owners --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- is due and when the car insurance is due --

A.50:  Right.

B.51:  -- and such like that and he just sort of keeps, uh, I guess you would say
a running record of it so that he, he knows at what point, uh, we are going to
be able to, to have, uh, some extra money.

A.52:  Uh-huh.  Uh, yeah I tried it, uh, and I think that one of the things I've
I've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions.  Uh, so, so I,
instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much, uh, I just pay
enough for two months when I pay one months bill and that way I have to send,
you know, substantially fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a
lot of time.

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  And uh, uh, gee, I pretty much pay my cable T V annually.  You get a
discount for doing that.  They give you the thirteenth mon-, month of service
free if they remember [laughter].

B.55:  Well, that's nice.

A.56:  But, they say [laughter], uh, they always forget you.  [laughter] Every
year they mess it up and forget to give me credit, uh, or shall I say five out
of the last six years.  [inhaling] So I called in and, uh, at first I got kind
of upset [laughter] but now,

B.57:  Now you expect it, huh?

A.58:  Oh yeah.  Now, I know they are going to do that.  Uh,
