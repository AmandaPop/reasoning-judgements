A.1:  Okay.  So what do you think about, uh, uh, health care for the elderly?

B.2:  Well, I've got a Mom who is, uh, eighty-six years old this year and
[breathing] uh, [noise] she, uh, sometimes well she lived with us for a few
years, act-, actually six years and then she moved, uh, to live with my bother
because she got tired of teenagers but, uh, in my house.  Uh, I think health
care for the elderly is, uh, is, uh, kind of a difficult, I say difficult, I
mean there's, as your body is running downhill, they can spend an infinite
amount to keep you alive.

@A.3:  Right.

B.4:  And on the other hand, it's kind of nice.  Uh, if you are taking care of an
elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the, the, uh, the tab.
#The# --

A.5:  #That's all.#

B.6:  -- one thing that Mom got into was that was pretty nice was an H M O.  They
took all the money from, from, uh, Medicare, how should I say it, uh, this H M
O thing said,, uh, had an agreement with Medicare that said on the average you
are going to spend X amount of dollars per year, so if you will give us that
money, we promise to take care of, of, uh --

A.7:  #All the bills.#

B.8:  -- #all the bills.#

A.9:  Does that include, uh, nursing home type care?

B.10:  No, this is just you know standard --

A.11:  Just strictly health care.

B.12:  -- health care like you would get from your employer.

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  And, uh, so, at one point, and that was pretty good for her because, uh,
[noise] there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- and, and,

A.17:  That's a hundred percent coverage so it's, that's good.

B.18:  Well, it was close to a hundred percent.

A.19:  Huh {very faint}.

B.20:  There were things that they wouldn't cover, but they, like they bought her
a, a, uh, [noise] [inhaling] let's see, they bought her a wheelchair and, uh,
one, one thing that was good about it was that it, uh, [noise] before that
time she was always subject, she would have these salesmen that would call and
say hey, if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized, uh, easy chair for
three times the, the, real price, uh, Medicare will pay for it and so she was
always buying stuff that she didn't need --

A.21:  Um {very faint}.

B.22:  -- and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small
fraction or no Medicare wouldn't pay for it.

A.23:  Huh.

B.24:  So, it kind of put the, uh, salesmen at bay, put it that way [noise].

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  [Inhaling] So, #how about you?#

A.27:  #So where# does she.  Well, uh, I guess in terms of where do you, is your
mother now in a a nursing home?  (( )).

B.28:  No, she's still, she is staying with my, uh, actually, she is staying with
my brother's son who's doesn't have teenagers [laughter] [noise].

A.29:  Right.  I guess [noise] that's the big question is, uh, what, what happens
when they begin to get older.  I have a grandmother and it, she is not really,
uh, you know, she is getting to the point where she almost can't be in a
nursing home.  She spends some time with my parents, some time now she is with
an uncle of mine, living with them #but# --

B.30:  #Yeah.# 

A.31:  -- she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own
any longer and that's, that's kind of a difficult situation, that, that she
has to live with one of her children.

B.32:  Yeah, it was difficult for us to because, uh, [noise] well actually, it, it
was all right as long as she could, could get back and forth to the, uh, you
know, to the bathroom and things like that, but when she #got# --

A.33:  #Right.#

B.34:  -- when she got really sick, and she couldn't move very much, then it was
exhausting, absolutely exhausting.  You know {very faint}.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  #So,#

A.37:  #Yeah,# yeah, my, uh, my grandmother is, hers is physically she is in not
too bad of shape.  She is in her upper eighties, I guess, forgetting in my
order but, uh, she's, uh, Alzheimer's I guess --

B.38:  Oh, yeah.

A.39:  -- and so her memory is very poor.  [laughter] And so she can't really be
on her own, but she can still do things by herself, but you just have to, uh,
kind of, direct her  [laughter] [breathing].

B.40:  Yeah and, uh, that, to that extent, I thi-, like I say this health care for
the elderly is, is, uh, I, I think they do a lot, there was one thing that,
that, uh, that, helped pull my Mom out of, uh, this, oh I don't [noise] know,
fog so to speak, [inhaling] we had, uh, a baby fairly late in life and as soon
as that baby came along, uh, uh, she paid a lot of attention to, you know,
something to take care of, I'll put it that way --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and something to pay attention to and [breathing], and, uh, the other
thing I noticed is that, that, uh, pets and, and, uh, if they have pets to take
care of, uh, like she got --

A.43:  That's true.

B.44:  -- yeah.  She got, uh,
