============================================================================

A.1:  So, have you personally been involved in any #trial by jury duty?#

@B.2:  #Uh, no,# I've never been called for jury duty which I am kind of glad
for.

A.3:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

B.4:  I think it would be kind of nice to actually experience it --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- uh, but no, I haven't, I have never.  How about you?

A.7:  Yeah, I was called, uh, once.  And I actually sat on the jury and it took a
few weeks --

B.8:  Really.

A.9:  -- the case was suppose to, the Judge predicted that it would take a few
days.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And it just stretched out and stretched out.  And, uh, it was kind of
interesting --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- to, uh, in, uh, in a way that kind of satisfied my, uh, or that pandered
to my nosiness.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  Cause it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how
these guys had dealt with each other --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and, uh, you were invited to, you know, pass judgement on them.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  So, uh, when you did it, does the jury actually, uh, determine the
sentence?

A.21:  Well, in this case, we determined the award --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- uh, it was two fellows, a bunch of money had, had, uh, passed from one
to the other --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- [Noise] and we had to decide, uh, was it wages, was it a loan that
needed to be paid back --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- uh, was it, you know, what was it and if it was something if, if anybody
owed anybody money back, how much did they owe --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and not only how much was, how much did they owe, but on top of that did
we want to penalize them,

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Uh,

B.32:  Well, it seems like the whole process, I don't know a whole lot about it,
but one thing that I would think is, is when the attorneys actually go through
the selection of the jury process --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- it seems to be me that, that would, that kind of biases, I mean, they
have control over well we want this person and we don't want this person here.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  It seems like that could kind of bias the case toward, you know, their
client.

A.37:  Well that certainly is what they're trying to do, right?

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  Uh, at least there are two of them --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- uh, knocking off, I guess, I guess all they can do is knock off the
people they think would be most bias against them.

B.42:  Right.  #Which,# 

A.43:  #Some# maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with,

B.44:  An equal balance.

A.45:  Maybe.

B.46:  I, I don't know.  The, the whole process, I, it's a good process.  I mean
it, I gue-, our country is based on #trial by jury.#

A.47:  #It could be,# it could be worse.  I find it hard to think of something
better.

B.48:  Yeah, I really do also.  I mean the forefathers, who, whoever came up with
the idea.  They were surely thinking a lot harder than I can think [laughter].

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  But, uh, it just, it seems to work pretty well in most cases.  Then in some
cases like the Manuel Noriega, I don't see how they could have found anybody
in the country who didn't have some opinion on that case.

A.51:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, that seems like, it seems like you would have to ig-,
either ignore that, I mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an
opinion?

B.52:  Yeah, it is.  That's, that's one of the things.  That's the reason why they
will often change menus of court --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and stuff like that to get a jury which doesn't have any --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- any, uh, bias towards the case and it, it, uh, just seems like sometimes
the people they are going to end up with have got to be just your basic, you
know, shmucks.

A.57:  They are going to have a problem.

B.58:  Yeah, it's, to not know anything about, you know, or not have formed any
type of opinion about some of these large major cases that we have been having
lately.

A.59:  Yeah, yeah.

B.60:  It just seems like those, I guess that's the one thing that I think is
wrong with it.  I don't know what you do about it, but those people are, are
not going to be, I mean if they haven't formed some sort of an opinion, I, uh,
I don't know what I am trying to say really but it just,

A.61:  Yeah, it would almost be if, if they could somehow say hey having an
opinion is okay.  It's being willing to change it, #that's# --

B.62:  #That's right.#  Be --

A.63:  -- the important thing.

B.64:  -- because having not formed an opinion to me says something about the
people themselves.  Well, either they sit in a little hole, you know, for all
their life and don't hear about anything --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- going on in the world and I don't see how somebody like that is going to
be a very good, uh, uh, I don't, form, be able to form a very coherent opinion
about #it.#

A.67:  #Right.# I mean you want people who are engaged [laughter].

B.68:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Right.  And that seems to be the opposite of what they,
they actually have to look for.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  So,

A.71:  Uh, well, that was one nice thing about the civil case.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Is that it was nothing that had shown up in the papers --

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  -- you know, it was just two guys, the, what they, the only thing they
looked for was if you had been in a similar #situation# --

B.76:  #Uh-huh.#

A.77:  -- yourself.

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  I guess they figured you, you know, you would be biased.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  In favor of which ever party you identified with.

B.82:  Right.  And, uh, as far as the, I don't think that the, uh, something
should be left up to the Judge, because that just, that gives too much power
to any one person.

A.83:  [Smack] It does seem like the Judge has a lot of power in the first place
--

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  -- and why give him this part also?

B.86:  Yeah, that just uh, I mean for for one person I am sure they have studied
the law and have been involved in it for so long, but still I think it's, this
is suppose to be a system of government by the people even though that's kind
of a joke [laughter] --

A.87:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.88:  -- but it still seems that the people ought to be the ones.  The crime was
against society.  It ought to be society as a whole, you know, tha-, as
represented by the jury,
