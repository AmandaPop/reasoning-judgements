REMARKS:        Speaker A had a phone ringing in the background
throughout the conversation.  Speaker B stammered a lot.

==========================================================================

A.1:  It sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high. 

@B.2:  Well, I think there's a big waste of our tax dollar.  

A.3:  It does seem that way.  I was trying to think of whether, we pay more tax
now than we did ten or twenty years ago, but it doesn't seem like we get as
much out value for the tax dollar.

B.4:  We don't.  Uh, we, it, there's, there's too much, uh, uh, pocket stuffing,
uh, going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the
county and do, uh, projects for the state and, you know, course they, they
prove that all the time o-, over the T V.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  You know, but I,

A.7:  Yeah, it does seem like the special interest groups are what, what keeps
taxes high.

B.8:  Right, that, uh, I just, I just pay, you know, more taxes than, than I can
imagine.  If I could get, I've got a little piece of property,

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  I just, I mean, when I tell you little piece of property, I mean I've got
five and a half acres, it's out in the country and if I could get what they're
charging me for taxes on that, I would sell it in a minute.

A.11:  Oh, boy.  

B.12:  You know, so that, that's why I just don't, uh, there's a lot of, you know,
a lot of expense as far as our taxes and all the, all the hidden costs that
they spend our money on that, that they shouldn't be spending our money on.
But, uh, I h-, I'm, I'm very, uh, I'm a single parent, so I'm very touchy
about taking every dad gum dime I make [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah, that does make it difficult.  

B.14:  It does, really does.  Are y-, y-, are you an c-, an accountant or,

A.15:  Uh, well, I used to work in finance, but I, I don't any longer.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  I was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to
other countries.  I seem to recall that, uh, many, many other countries have
higher tax rates than ours, but they may also get better value for the dollar.
That's the real question.

B.18:  Right, well, you know, I've, I can handle the, I can handle the tax m-, the
amount of taxes that I pay, I can handle that.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  But it, you know, when you hit all the, uh, bad roads and the, and you hear
of all the misuse of the money and that --

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- that's a, that's a bigger -- 

A.23:  Right, that's what's irritating.  

B.24:  -- problem to me than, than having to pay them.  

A.25:  [Ringing] It's also irritating that, you, we keep hearing a lot of lip
service about how, [ringing] how to make it better and how to spend it more
wisely but they never to seem hear that, that it changes or improves.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  [Ringing].

B.28:  Well I think, I think one of our, uh and this is really not the total, uh,
thing, 

A.29:  [Ringing]. 

B.30:  uh, not totally on taxes, but one of our things is, our on our, uh, the, our,

A.31:  [Ringing]. 

B.32:  federal government is our, uh, why in the world they don't get rid of,

A.33:  [Ringing].

B.34:  one of the houses.  Either get rid of the senate or get rid of the
Congress, you know, get rid of one of those housing systems and, uh, because
that's costing, that's costing the taxpayer m-, multimillions --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- and, uh, but they govern each other and they, they vote their selves in
to staying in where they are, you know, and, uh, I don't, I've never
understood, uh, you know, why.  I, there is one state, what state i-, in the
United States that only has one housing, I m-, one governing body.

A.37:  Um, I don't remember hearing that.  

B.38:  Okay, there is, there's one state.  I've, I d-, whether it's New Hampshire,
it's a northern state, uh, or New England state that has one housing body and,
uh, one governing body --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- and, uh, you know, they, their taxes are, are more well spent, but, uh,
no, I've, you know, I disagree with a lot of things, but a lot of things I
can't change, but, uh, what s-, what part of the country are you from?

A.41:  I'm from Texas, but now I live in California.  

B.42:  Okay.  

A.43:  [Ringing].

B.44:  I, course, I'm, I'm from Texas, too, but I, I think my, the two counties
that I pay taxes in,

A.45:  [Ringing].

B.46:  are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here.

A.47:  [Ringing] Which --

B.48:  So,  

A.49:  -- counties are tha-, where, where #do you live?#

B.50:  #I live in,# uh, my, I have some, my little piece of land is in, uh,
Benedict County and,

A.51:  [Ringing].

B.52:  I live in Smith County.  

A.53:  And what state is that in?  

B.54:  Texas.  

A.55:  Still in Texas.  

B.56:  Still in Texa-.  You hear this Texas accent?

A.57:  [Ringing].

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.60:  I can't get rid of it [laughter].

A.61:  Course in Texas, at least you still don't [ringing] have income tax.

B.62:  Well, I think we pay it in other ways.  

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  I think we, I really think we pay it in a lot of other ways.  It's funny to
me, too, that, uh, why the government taxes, has a ti-, higher tax rate for a
single person than they do for a married couple.
