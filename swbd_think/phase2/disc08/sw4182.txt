REMARKS:        Speaker A dominated the conversation, carrying out
long monologues.

==============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Uh, so we're talking about drug testing, on, and how we feel about
it in the, in the work place.

A.2:  Correct.  I, I assume this is involuntary drug testing from --

B.3:  #Yeah.#  

A.4:  -- #employers.#

@B.5:  Yeah.  My, my gut feeling is to, probably side, uh, on the, the Bill of
Rights side of this and say that thi-, it's an unfair vi-, uh, uh, invasion of
privacy.  I, I, uh, [lipsmack] I have to say that I, from my political point
of view, I tend to be, I tend on sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of
issues, but at the same time, uh, part of my own picture of the way politics
should work in this country is there also should be, uh, regulatory controls
on things, and I think that when you have situations where, uh, in, uh, a
working individual, uh, could do damage, for instance a, an airline, uh, you
know, or, or somebody who's driving a public carrier like, like truck drivers
and stuff like that, I think that there is a, uh, far more substantial issue,
uh, at hand.  But I think there are other ways, uh, other than, than doing
things like drug testing to monitor the way, uh, people behave.  Uh, I think a
g-, for instance, a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a
personal problem, uh, [lipsmack] in, in like a clerical environment or a, a
work environment, like I'm, I'm a computer programmer, so [throat_clearing] if
I were indulging in activities like that or one of my colleagues were, uh, it
would seem to be pretty easy to, to tell if their performance was suffering
for it.

A.6:  #Right.#  

B.7:  #How do# you feel about these things?  

A.8:  Well, I, I, I tend to look at it like, uh, right, I mean, without, without,
uh, you know, a suspicion of, of, you know, reasonable suspicion of, of
something going on, I, I would have to probably tend to, uh, uh, agree that,
at least in most cases it should not be done.  I, I also, my, my big question,
of course, is, you know, this is a pretty steep thing for, uh, something, the
last I heard, was not a hundred percent effective.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  Or, you know, accurate.   

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  Uh, with it not being a hundred percent accurate, that, that leaves open,
you know, quite a bit of room, for, you know, false positives.

B.13:  Sure, sure.  

A.14:  Uh,   

B.15:  And that could ruin somebody's life.  

A.16:  Absolutely.  You know, that,

B.17:  Even if they were vindicated.  

A.18:  Sure, sure, because I mean, it's like, uh, someone goes on trial for
something, the press lets everybody know, so no matter how many times you're
acquitted.  But, uh, so there is that, I mean, but also, you know, as, as
someone who does not use any controlled substances, I, you know, part of me
says, well, as long as it's accurate, I don't care if they test, and if
someone is using it, they should be, you know, caught for it, as long as it is
illegal.

B.19:  Sure.  

A.20:  Uh, so th-, you know, that, that is a tough things to juggle between the
two.

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  Uh, so,   

B.23:  Well, I have to say, I'm, I'm a child of the sixties and, uh, it, it, you
know, I grew up and when I was young, I flirted around with some of that stuff
like a lot of my friends did and I saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives,
or, not, not really, I don't know, I guess I saw a couple of friends ruin
their lives, and that sort of thing, but I didn't see most of them ruin their
lives with it.  In fact, most of them went through it like a phase, like, you
know, most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they, ((you
know)), have to start, you know, working and that sort of thing they tend to
cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever and, and they become
adults about it.  [Lipsmack] And, uh, i-, in fact, my attitudes about the
kinds of drug problems that we have in this country, uh, are, are that I think
that the government should a-, administrate it in a comp-, you know, in a
completely different manner.  I think it would be a, a good source of revenue.
I think there's some, some evidence about the way this stuff's been handled in
Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways, but that's sort
of moving off the topic at hand here, and I, you know, the, the, t-, fact of
the matter is, is I think that issues like this really, really are, I mean, to
a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's
right to privacy and that sort of thing because, uh, uh, you know --

A.24:  (( )).   

B.25:  -- I mean,   

A.26:  It also involves due process.  

B.27:  Yeah, and, and, uh, it, it, I, you know, the fact of the matter is, is I
think that, that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to have this kind of
thing in his life if it's going to, i-, uh, have an impact upon his ability to
make a, a, a living and, and, you know, and, and keep his livelihood coming
in.

A.28:  A-, and that does bring up a good point in that, if it's not having an
impact, then what right does the, uh, employer have to, you know, to get
information about that.

B.29:  Sure.  A-, and, and, uh, and, and so, you know, it's, uh, I, so, anyway, I
guess that we're, we're largely in agreement in that, uh, case and, uh, and in
fact, I think that [lip_smack] uh, because you know, I mean, I, it's, it's
literally, I, you know, I'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been
almost, jeez, man, maybe twenty years, 

A.30:  [Laughter]. 

B.31:  almost since I last had any of that, that sort of stuff, uh,

A.32:  [Laughter]. 

B.33:  around me, but, at the same time, I don't think that that necessarily gives
me a right to s-,
