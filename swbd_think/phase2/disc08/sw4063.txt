============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well we have a budget we go by every pay check and since I have been
in the service, we get paid twice a month.  So that's what I go by.  Uh,

@B.2:  Well, we try.  It's it's not as easy as I had thought it would be, but
last year I started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were
all going and I have uh a budget book that I use --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- if you have, people that have personal computers it would be much
easier.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  But, uh, so then at the end of the year I, I totalled up what we were
spending say for groceries or, or entertainment or things like that and then
this year I tried to keep it within [sniffing] you know a balance there --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and then if there is, if we are over budget in one item, if we want to
apply that to another one, I try to do that, but it's not always, 

A.9:  [Laughter] {very faint}.

B.10:  easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month.
Things like that that you're not expecting.  I don't really know how some
people stay within a budget.

A.11:  Oh yeah.  I can, I can understand that [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter]  Do you have kids?

A.13:  Yeah, I got one kid.  One.

B.14:  We don't have any.  Cause I thought if we had a child [laughter], I don't
know what we'd d-, do.

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  But my husband gets paid once a week and I get paid every two weeks.

A.17:  Yeah [noise].

B.18:  And, uh, then every three months I have a bonus check and then that's when
we, we [noise] try to put some a side at that time.  As for as saving, uh, I
take out of each pay check I would put so much into a four O one K pl-, plan
and a profit sharing --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- and then he does the same thing.  He puts one into, uh, a stock plan at
his company and also into a retirement plan.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  Because to me, that's the only way we are ever going to be able to save --

A.23:  Oh yeah.  I,

B.24:  -- because if the money comes in, it's spent.  If it's not taken out before
I get it.

A.25:  [Laughter] Yeah, I understand that.  Ri-, right now that's just the problem
I have and we don't, ain't been able to save any because I am putting my wife
through school right now.

B.26:  Oh, yeah [sniffing].

A.27:  Through nursing school, so it's kind of [laughter], uh --

B.28:  That's very hard.

A.29:  -- maxed out right now.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  But, we try to put a little away ever-, every month you know and plus we've
got child care which we got to put in there and everything.  We try to put a
little away for his, you know, school education and stuff for later on.

B.32:  Yeah, they say, how old is he?

A.33:  He is five.

B.34:  He's five.  They say by the time kids his age are ready to go to college
it's going to be about seventy thousand dollars --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- a year for college. 

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  And it's just unbelievable.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  You know, I, I'm just twenty-nine and when I went it was probably five
hundred dollars a semester for the tuition, books everything.

A.41:  Yeah.  If you, yeah it's kind of expensive for her going to nursing school.
Nursing school is one of the more expensive ones.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  Where is she going?

A.43:  Uh, U T A.

B.44:  #Yeah# --

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  -- I am sure it is.

A.47:  And, you know, the, the, uh, budget part kind of falls in there you know,
you get unexpected expenses and stuff for that cause she has to drive about
twenty, thirty minutes every day to school and that, that adds more [noise] to
the --

B.48:  #Oh yeah.  Has# --   

A.49:  -- #gas budget.#

B.50:  -- she started having do the, uh, work at the hospital.

A.51:  Do what, ma'am?

B.52:  Has she started doing any, uh, work at the hospitals?

A.53:  Uh, no, she goes, they have a class there every Tuesday and that's what
they do and then she will start during her senior year, uh, going to the
hospital three times a week, so.

B.54:  Yeah, because I, I've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to
to be an R N and I, I think towards the last year they were working at the
hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and all the things
which was an added expense.

A.55:  Yeah. 

B.56:  [Sniffing].

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  But, it is hard.  I don't know in, in compared to say my mother and father,
[inhaling] living in a budget was no problem.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  It was just, this is what we have and this is what we spend.  But, that's
in this time and you know, I don't know what it is, well you know my husband
loves to play some golf, you know, or something like that or, or ruins the
ball.

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  With me, in and both you know parent's didn't do that --

A.63:  Huh.

B.64:  -- if they didn't have the money, they didn't get it.

A.65:  Yeah.  Yeah, #I understa-,# 

B.66:  #And we're not that way.#

A.67:  That's the same problem we fall into you know.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  You know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little
something, you know.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  Be with the kids a little bit during that time and --

B.72:  And #it's hard,# 

A.73:  -- #kind of a# family deal.

B.74:  And it's hard, like, you know, with interest rates now as low as they are.
[noise] Credit card rates are still sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen
percent.
