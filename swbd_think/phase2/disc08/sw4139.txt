===========================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, how do you, how do you find out what's going on?  

B.2:  What's new [laughter].  

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  Well, uh, quite a variety of ways, I guess.  Uh, like to listen to the
radio back and forth to work, at least b-, --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- to work and in the -- 

A.7:  Do you lis-, -- 

B.8:  -- mornings.  

A.9:  -- listen to the same station, or do you switch back and forth?

B.10:  Well, I have one station I listen to when I get up in the house, then I
listen to another one in the car.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  I listen to, I actually, I listen to the radio most of all.  I
don't, I don't buy papers and stuff.  I, I listen a lot to national public
radio --

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- which is, I know, pretty much, it's got, in the morning it has like an
all news format and then, uh, toward, it, it changes, like it goes onto
classical, then onto jazz later on, but on, in the way to work, that, that's,
what I do is I listen to, to N P R and what it says about --

B.14:  Uh,   

A.15:  -- about what's going on.  

B.16:  Well, we don't have, uh, well, let's see, I guess it might be available, I
just haven't heard of it --

A.17:  Um.  

B.18:  -- on that one, I, I guess I have, come to think of it, but, uh, I haven't
made a practice of listening to that one.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Watching T V in the evenings.  

A.21:  Uh, what [laughter], it's, it's funny.  I haven't s-, do you watch like C N
N or do you, uh, or the, 

B.22:  Well, I usually catch the networks and I will occasionally watch C N N,
too.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  ((Depends on what)), you know,

A.25:  Jack, do you listen, I don't know, do, I, I like it, when I watch T-, I
don't really watch T V news all that often, but what I do is, I, I like A B C.
I think, I think they have the best news network.

B.26:  Yeah, uh, I generally, uh, I don't know, I go to the N B C sometimes.

A.27:  [Laughter] ((Have)),

B.28:  A B C sometimes.  

A.29:  Have you ever watched NIGHTLINE with, with, with Ted Coppell?

B.30:  Yeah, I watch that.  

A.31:  Or is that, I, I, I get to see that, I get that occasionally, but it's
like, I, I, he's a, I think he's sort of like an upscale Geraldo.

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  Yeah, yeah.

A.35:  You know, he, I think he, he thinks just a, thinks just like a, a, a
little, a, 

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  little too much.  

B.38:  Yeah, (( )).  

A.39:  I, I wish I could actually stay up late enough to, to see some of the, to
see some of those things.

B.40:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.41:  Do you get TIME magazine, or NEWSWEEK, or anything like that? 

B.42:  Uh, I don't take them.  I read them, I've read them --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- in the barber shop [laughter] or whatever.  

A.45:  [Laughter] Yeah, dentist office material.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  I, actually I, I kind of gave up on, on news magazines.  They, they
haven't, they kind of p-, end up piling up.

B.48:  Yeah, that's what I was just about to say about the newspaper.  I, uh, I
take it, then I quit it [laughter].

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  Gets there laying around and don't get to read it's, does get to be quite a
volume of --

A.51:  Well -- 

B.52:  -- material after awhile.  

A.53:  -- I tried like, uh, I like, I read the Sunday paper, you know.  I, that
one I can prob-, I can find time for.

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  You know, like on a, I, I really like to, on a Sunday morning, get up and,
uh, listen, uh, get up and read the Sunday paper, like f-, usually I try to
read it from like, from cover to cover, you know.

B.56:  Yeah, same here.  

A.57:  And that, that pretty much gives you, gives me an idea what's going on and,
in about, like a two hours it takes me to run right through it, I can figure
out exactly what, what, what's happened in like the past week.  But that's
about the only newspaper that I really listen to.

B.58:  Our morning paper throws you a curve.  They, uh, you know, that's what I
would like to do, I say, well, I'd just like to take the Sunday paper, well,
we'll, uh, we'll let you have the rest of the week for free [laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  So, what do you, [phone_ringing] what do you do?

A.61:  So you end, well, you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  On the,

B.64:  [Phone_ringing].

A.65:  on the way out [groan].  

B.66:  But I say, well, heck with it, we'll go buy it from that guy on the street
[laughter].

A.67:  Well, one of the things that I,

B.68:  [Phone_ringing].

A.69:  I can't do, is I just can't find the time to read the paper all that much.
It just,

B.70:  [Phone_ringing].

A.71:  if I were to, if I were to, it would take like, what, half hour a day --

B.72:  Oh, yeah.  

A.73:  -- to, to,

B.74:  [Phone_ringing].

A.75:  to find the time to read the paper, and that's why I like the radio the
best,

B.76:  [Phone_ringing].

A.77:  Es-, especially in the car because I, when I'm in the car and I'm on my way
to work,

B.78:  [Phone_ringing].

A.79:  there's nothing else I can do,

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  other than like watch the road [laughter], you know.  

B.82:  I've gotten into some, uh, you know, we have a, uh, news service on our,
uh, network here on the --

A.83:  Oh, and it, it s-, -- 

B.84:  -- computer.  

A.85:  -- it slides in a window across the bottom?  

B.86:  Well, we have that at, at lunch in the cafeteria, but we also have, uh, one
that you pull up on your screen, you know, we have a computer network here at
T I that --

A.87:  Uh-huh  

B.88:  -- you can go to a, Dallas -- 

A.89:  So, do you, is it,

B.90:  -- and get the national.  

A.91:  Is it Dow Jones?  

B.92:  They have a Dow Jones segment there where it covers s-, uh, you know, some
most active stocks.

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  Uh, General Electric.

A.95:  Friends of mine at, friends of mine at other, at other, uh, at other
locations, they ha-, they have that, and it's like you can actually see, like
the ticker run, you know, you can open a window on your work station --

B.96:  Uh.  

A.97:  -- and you can run, and you can run the, uh, the ticker across the bottom,

B.98:  [Laughter].  

A.99:  and it, it actually, you know, they, they run a ticker for, for news items
as well as stock.
