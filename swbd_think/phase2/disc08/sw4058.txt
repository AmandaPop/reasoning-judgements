A.1:  Okay.  Toby this is Brian Weight and our topic, I guess, tonight is on
capital punishment and how we feel about that.  Um, if you don't mind, uh, how
do you feel about capital punishment?

@B.2:  Well, my position in general is that I'm supportive of it, but I'm not
supportive of the way that it's currently administered.

A.3:  Okay.

B.4:  Um, [throat_clearing] it takes so long with, uh, the appeals process, uh,
that it's, uh, uh, simply impossible to say that it's, that it's consistent
administration of justice.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, if, if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who
deserved it when there was, uh, evidence, uh, beyond a, a reasonable doubt
that they had committed a, a crime worthy of it, then --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- I think it should be done.

A.9:  And that way it can be a, a deterrent.

B.10:  That's right.  But as it stands now it's not a deterrent.  We just had a
fellow here in our county who has, he's been on death row for seventeen years
--

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and just had his sentence overturned for the third time, uh, on a
technicality.  Everybody knows he did it.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  This last technicality was simply because the language of the decision
handed down by the jury, uh, ex-, uh, saying that he should get the death
penalty --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be.

A.17:  Oh, great.

B.18:  And that was it.  I mean, it was a, a very simple, I mean, they fully
intended to give him the death penalty.  Uh, they had a unanimous decision,
but when they drafted the, uh, decision --

A.19:  The response, yeah.

B.20:  -- uh, [throat_clearing] [sniffing] they did it wrong.  [laughter] And it
was just a very minor, very minor, uh, mistake, but it was enough for, uh, the
state supreme court to say that the, uh, that the decision was invalid, and
that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  That kind of thing, uh, and, and, and the way that people search and search
for those kind of things just, uh, [child_talking] just disgusts me.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  [Child_talking] And with, [throat_clearing] [sniffing] uh, with it, with it
being that way, it ends up costing us so much money, so much more to have the
death penalty --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- than to not have it, that, uh, I'm almost inclined to say, do away with
it.

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  The, the problem that I see is, uh, what do we have instead?

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Here in Georgia, uh, we don't have, a, a sentence of life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  If someone gets life in prison, they are generally released in seven years
if they behave well --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- and we have had people get out in seven years and commit, uh, another
murder.  [child_talking] Uh, that just shouldn't be.  So.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  But I say, uh, I could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we
could have life without the possibility of parole.

A.37:  Right, right.  Well, I tend to agree with you.  Uh, I'm kind of, uh, torn
between two items, however.  I, I definitely be-, believe in due process, that
if a person is found guilty so that we're not ramrodding a, a guilty verdict
on them, that's it, uh, up for review in, uh, the appeal process.  However, I
tend to agree with you that, well, I don't tend to agree with, I definitely
agree with you that there are people that are going to make sure that every T
is crossed, every I is dotted, and to make sure that everything is just right.
Otherwise, you know, someone gets off on a technicality.

B.38:  Yeah. 

A.39:  Now,

B.40:  [Cough]. 

A.41:  not only in the courts is that costing us money and millions and millions
of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and, uh, clogging up the court, but also
when the, uh, the detectives, the homicide detectives and so forth, when
they're researching, when they are gathering the evidence, they're, they're
bending over backwards, uh, in typically what I believe is an open and shut
case where the guy is guilty, there are seven eyewitnesses, they saw it
happen, they have testified what happened.  Um.

B.42:  There's video tape of it.

A.43:  Yeah, exactly [laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter] Exactly, and the guy is in sound mind and, and so forth.  He's,
he's not an idiot.  He wasn't acting, I, I don't know.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  You know, in that case, we're, we're spending money in the, in the judicial
system.  We're spending money in the law enforcement area, trying to verify
all this kind of information, and the, and the individual's guilty, I believe
that if we have cash-, capital punishment, that it should be executed swiftly,
that it should, uh, be taken care of, not after seven levels of appeal, but
after a couple levels appe-, of appeal, uh, under cert-, certain circumstances
--

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- those circumstances would be,
