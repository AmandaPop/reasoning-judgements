=========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any?

B.2:  Yes, we do have a pet.  We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh, well, we
call it the S P C A.  It's the, uh, an-, from an animal shelter.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, he'd come in there as a stray.  

A.5:  All right. 

B.6:  Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross.  

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him.  Uh, he's,

A.9:  Oh, that's good.  You don't often find that, I don't think.

B.10:  No, uh, we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from
somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident --

A.11:  Right.  

B.12:  -- because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is
someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him.

A.15:  Sure.  There's a, okay, uh, that's interesting.  Yeah, the only pet that
I've had, uh, I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- and in my, in my earlier days as a student [sniffing] I kind of time
shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine and, uh, it was an amazing dog,
it really was.  They had, he had gotten it from the pound and, uh, it, it's a
Spanish Pointer named Domino.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.  

A.19:  Kind of looks like a dom-, a Dalmatian -- 

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- and we trained it from a pup, and basically it, right now it, it's fully
trained and it can do a lot of things.  It will get beer for you out of the
fridge, and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.  So, it's
really, [throat_clearing] it's, it's kind of a show piece any-, [laughter]
-more, and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino
[laughter] ((you know)).

B.22:  Oh, I think so.  

A.23:  Yeah, it's, uh, she's been a real good, a real good dog and, uh, just, it's
kind of a shame that I'm, I'm go-, I'm away from it now.  I, I j-, I actually
live in Florida --

B.24:  Uh-huh {faint}.

A.25:  -- but I'm on an internship up here for a year and then I go back down,
but, uh, yeah, Domino's a real good dog.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?  

B.28:  Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even
though there are, you know, complications come with it.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  And then with our children, uh, at the time they were, oh, grade five and,
and grade eight, so --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to
have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet.

A.33:  Sure.  

B.34:  Uh,   

A.35:  Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it
and things like that.

B.36:  Yeah, right.  

A.37:  That's good.  That kind of builds some --

B.38:  ((So)),  

A.39:  -- character a little bit.  

B.40:  Well, that's the idea.  I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,
uh, it depends on the,

A.41:  [Scratching].

B.42:  on everyone's discipline.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't,
uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog and, uh, we've had him about four
years now.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know, it's necessary that individuals
have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,

A.47:  Yeah, that's something that's important for sure.  

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  I think, uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, uh --

B.50:  Uh,   

A.51:  -- (( )) or,

B.52:  Actually no, we live in a, in an area that's, oh, probably about two and a
half miles from the university.

A.53:  Oh, I see.  

B.54:  Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, uh, in the middle of a
residential area.

A.55:  Um.  

B.56:  And, uh, so that is not as good, uh, you know, this dog, being a small dog
it's, uh, more you, more acceptable --

A.57:  Yeah -- 

B.58:  -- but again,

A.59:  -- it's not that big of a problem.  With Domino, she was full grown, I
would estimate seventy pounds.

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  And, you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town, it's a suburb of
Orlando --

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  -- but [throat_clearing], there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her
to run around, and she was a dog that loved to run, so that was the biggest
problem I saw, and I think that's one of the, uh, the issues people need to
think about before they get a dog is, you know, do you have the room for this
dog to run around, or, s-, you know, I guess you can't really say for cats.
Me and cats don't get along too well, uh [laughter], but, you know, that whole
space issue, I think, is real important.

B.64:  Yeah, it's, uh, that's one of the biggest concerns.  It's like, uh, there's
a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal, but the same time, one
has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of --

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  -- of the animal --

A.67:  Yeah, that, that,

B.68:  -- and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise.

A.69:  Sure, and that's all part of y-, of keeping your part of the relationship.

B.70:  Right.  

A.71:  You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, uh,
those issues.

B.72:  ((Well)),

A.73:  You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise.  My mother, oh, she
freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them
--

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  -- and, you know, we h-, we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there
that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin
with, but, uh,
