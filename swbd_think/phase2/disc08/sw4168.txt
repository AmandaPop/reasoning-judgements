A.55:  #Oh, I, I# really haven't listened to that [laughter].

B.56:  Some of them are just really rough.  So, so you went to school then in, I'm
surprised you didn't go to, to any pa-, parties or anything where they were
playing a lot of music or stuff or,

A.57:  Well, uh, I used to a long time ago but since I've started back into school
now, I haven't really done that much.  I've been pretty busy.  Uh --

[laughter].  I guess we're# --

A.71:  #Oh, okay [laughter].  All right.#

B.72:  -- the same age then.

A.73:  Yeah.  And, uh, I didn't really start getting into music until I went to
college because, uh, my parents didn't really have music in the house.  #Put
it that way.#

B.74:  #Oh, rea-,#  Were they religious?

A.75:  Yes.  

B.76:  uh, I see.  #I,# 

A.77:  #So,# I'm always behind.  I'm, I'm not, I'm never really up to date on all
that stuff.  But I know what I like when it's, uh, when I like a sound.  A
certain kind #of sound, yeah.#
