============================================================================

A.1:  All right, uh, I think we pay a little bit too much in taxes and we don't
always get what we pay for [laughter].

B.2:  I agree.  I'm particularly worried about Social Security since I'm at the
end of the baby boomer generation and there's not going to be any money left
when I get through, so I kind of feel like I'm supporting a lot of people and
that it's just going to go into a hole [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah, no. 

B.4:  I don't think that I'm going to get anything out of it when the time comes
from it.  Other than that, yeah.

A.5:  Yeah, I, I kind of feel the same way, you know, you pay all this money into
Social Security and then you're not going to get anything back out of it, you
know.

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  Because you're paying for everybody that use it now and it's not going to
be there when you need it.

B.8:  Right, everybody, there's not going to be enough people to support us when
we get our age --

A.9:  Yep.  

B.10:  -- up that way, but we'll be supporting, we're, they're, we're, a lot of
people right now supporting a few people and then when the time comes and it's
a few people supporting a lot of people --

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  -- it's not going to even out very fairly  -- 

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- that way.  I don't have to, I don't worry about the other, I don't have
state taxes really, because I'm from Texas, so I'm happy with that.

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  [Laughter] I'm worried about it, though, because every year they sit there
and try to put more taxes in, you know.

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  And they're trying to get property tax in our county, [laughter] --

A.19:  Yeah w-,    

B.20:  -- but,

A.21:  Well, I think some of the taxes that pay, you know, you're paying more for
the people to, to disburse the money out than you are for, uh, the money to be
spent, you know --

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  -- like on education and stuff.  

B.24:  There's so much administration and nothing, when it, when it comes right
down to it, the overhead is, it, everything gets eaten up in overhead and
doesn't actually do much.

A.25:  Yeah.  So, I, I feel like some of, like I said, some, most of the taxes
that we pay are not being used for what they're supposed to be used for.

B.26:  Yeah, I was thinking,

A.27:  [Barking]. 

B.28:  the other day, you know, it was like,

A.29:  [Talking].

B.30:  no taxation without representation and, so long ago and now we're just
eaten alive by all this government that can't,

A.31:  [Child_yelling]. 

B.32:  pay for itself and goes into debt more and more and more and more and we
don't have much say about it.

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  And the government doesn't seem to do a, be doing a whole lot of things I
like either.

A.35:  Uh,   

B.36:  They're going,

A.37:  Yeah, and, and they, like they use taxes to, to make grants to people that,
you know, they want to find out how come butterflies do, fly and all other
kinds and I think that's kind of stupid.

B.38:  Yeah, and then this National Endowment for the Arts thing where they, they
put pornography up in the, in the name of art, you know --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- and make me pay for it [laughter].  

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  My, you know, I, I don't exactly appreciate that either and I really get
frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then
expect me to support them on it.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  First you get to the point where it's like, you feel like protesting by not
paying just to make them understand that they can't do this just because, you
know, it's our money they're using --

A.45:  Yep.  

B.46:  -- for it.  They can't just, think, well, it's ours now, we got it, we can
do what we want with it.

A.47:  Uh,   

B.48:  It says that I'm standing, it, it says I approve if I sit there and pay it
and I get kind of upset about that.

A.49:  Yeah.  I can understand that because [laughter] and, uh, it's it, you know,
like you said it makes you upset and it makes me upset, too when I hear stuff
like that, and I just heard on the news tonight where they, all them people in
Congress overdrafted themselves and they, you know, finally going come out
with everybody's name now saying who done it.

B.50:  Well,

A.51:  [Barking].

B.52:  that's good.  

A.53:  So,    

B.54:  Yeah, you start to feel real powerless.  

A.55:  Yep.  

B.56:  But, on the other hand at least we're, [breathing] we're powerless in a lot
ways, but then, there's so many other countries that I'm glad I'm not in.

A.57:  Oh, yeah.  

B.58:  You know.  It seems to me like the minute you starting putting in the
radical changes in anything, you end up with something like, uh, Liberia or
[laughter] Czechoslovakia, you know, I mean, it seems like, I'd rather try to
work from inside the system to change something than to throw away what we've
got now.

A.59:  Oh, yeah.  

B.60:  It would be pretty frightening the other way around.  It's kind of scary
now seeing the way --

A.61:  Uh,

B.62:  -- they're going over there.  

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, that and, you know, like, a lot of our tax money goes to
helping other countries and stuff and, I think we ought to use a lot of that
money here in the states before we send it to someplace else.
