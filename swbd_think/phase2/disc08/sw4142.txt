=========================================================================

A.1:  So is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not -- 

B.2:  Yeah, act-, -- 

A.3:  -- straightforward at all?  

B.4:  -- actually, uh, mine's real straightforward.  Uh, basically, uh, you know,
I take my standard deductions, uh, on my house, which I have a mortgage on --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- and, uh, that's usually the big {voice cracked}, the big payoff part of
the year for me because I get a couple thousand dollars back usually.

A.7:  Oh, that's nice.  

B.8:  But, uh, actually I, uh, I don't really begrudge, uh, the, uh, the
government their due.  I d-, I do think that, uh, probably just, like, just
almost anybody else that, you know, there's a lot of inefficiency in how they
distribute taxes.

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  And I don't think that they, uh, do a very good job of distributing them to
the [laughter] people who really need them [laughter].

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  But, uh, generally, I think they're pretty necessary and life ((would))
probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation so [laughter],

A.13:  Right, I don't have any problem at all with income tax.  Some of the
property taxes are, well, I don't know if they're unfair, they're confusing
and I, there seems to be less ability to get those all together.

B.14:  Yeah, we act-, we actually had a situation here where, uh, our house was
appraised, you know, every year by the county --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- and we have to, uh, pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and first year we owned the house, uh, that appraisal was something like
twenty-five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for.

A.19:  Really?  

B.20:  And so, uh, despite, you know, a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and
stuff, I decided to go in to, uh, talk to the Board of Equalization --

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- uh, in Prince William County and make sure that, you know, a mistake had
not been made, and all that kind of stuff.  And so I just sort of made my case
on the basis of, uh, you know --

A.23:   You just bought it.  

B.24:   -- analogy --

A.25:   Right.

B.26:  -- to other, to other houses around us that were s-, similar in terms of
square footage, you know, and size, all, and, and, you know, general property
size, things like that.

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  And j-, just showed that, you know, our, obvious-, for some reason, our
property had been valued much higher [inhaling], and, uh, they bought it.
They actually reduced the, uh --

A.29:  Really?  

B.30:  -- reduced the a-,

A.31:  They didn't raise, the, they c-, your neighbors' taxes [laughter].

B.32:  Uh, they didn't raise my neighbors', yeah [laughter].  They actually
reduced mine to be in line with, uh, a more reasonable appraisal.

A.33:  That's really great.  

B.34:  So I, you know, I, I realized, well, the, you know, few instances you can
fight city hall on things like property taxes, but, uh,

A.35:  That's wonderful.  

B.36:  Yeah, it was, it was an interesting experience because the guy before me
went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion, you know, I
mean, he was sort of mad at the world and, uh [laughter] --

A.37:  Right.  

B.38:  -- he, he had sort of that mad at the world attitude right off the bat
which you could, you know, see a mile away.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  And then he, uh, then he started talking about all the things that were
wrong with this property, you know, like, you know, the leaves hadn't been
cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and, you know, a lot
of really minor stuff --

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  -- that just didn't impress these guys at all and,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  they sort of gave him a hard time.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  But, uh, you know, when I pointed out that, that our house was appraised at
this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at, you
know, twenty-five thousand dollars less, I mean,

A.47:  Right, and you just bought yours, that's the best argument, I think.

B.48:  Yeah, so, it, it, it worked.  It was actually pretty, uh, pretty s-,
satisfying [laughter] experience.

A.49:   That's wonderful.  

B.50:   It wa-, it was kind --

A.51:   ((I bet)),

B.52:   -- of like going up to the pope, though, you know, I mean, they --

A.53:   Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- they, uh, were sitting in these, you know, these giant judges tables,
you know, like,

A.55:   Oh, it was a, it was a,

B.56:   It was like a judge's chambers  -- 

A.57:   Really, wow.  #It wasn't# --

B.58:   -- #that, that y-,# 

A.59:  -- it wasn't the county council?

B.60:  It was the, it was the county, but it wasn't the council.  They have
different people on this Board of Equalization.  I don't know, I don't even
know how they get on it, you know, I, I'm just guessing they're appointed.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  Uh, one of the guys is actually a, kind of a well known Realtor around
here, so [laughter],

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  You know, I, I figured if anybody gave me a hard time, it would be him, y-
[laughter].

A.65:  Right, well, he d-,

B.66:  [Cough]. 

A.67:  he probably knows it, really well, the real estate market --

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  -- so that was probably help.

B.70:  But, other than that, uh, I haven't had too much, too much problem with the
taxes.  Actually, when I was in grad school, I lived in Virginia also, I went
to school down at, uh, Charlottesville --

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- and, uh, uh, I had a, you know, one of these graduate fellowships --

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  -- and, fortunately it was not taxable at that time.  

A.75:  Right, now it is.  

B.76:  Because actual-, they actually hassled me over it, though.  

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  And I had to, I had to go to some length, you know, I actually got one of
these letters that, that said, you know, you got to show up at the local, you
know, I R S office and explain.

A.79:  Oh, you got audited, wow.  

B.80:  Yeah, and actually explain, you know, what was going on and, you know
[laughter] I just, I said, hey, I mean, it's tax free, I mean, that's my
understanding of things, so anyway, eventually they, they accepted that, that
it was, but, actually, I work with a guy now whose, I, I, I guess he was r-,
