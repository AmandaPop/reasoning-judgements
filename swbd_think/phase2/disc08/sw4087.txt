============================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you have children?

B.2:  No.

A.3:  You don't have children?

B.4:  No.

A.5:  And my children are in their twenties now, so --

B.6:  Oh.

A.7:  -- child care is something that I, I no longer fortunately have to take
care of but, it is something that was hard at the time just finding, finding
sitters.  I did not work though so I didn't have to, uh, have to worry about,
you know, all day during the day which I think is a real problem.

B.8:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] yeah, I agree.  Uh, cause, [noise] I suppose when
when I do start having children, uh, I'd like to stay home for a while but,
uh, you know eventually I'd, I might have to put them in day care to work and
I think it's hard to find, uh, good day care because just the other night, uh,
on the news in Milwaukee, uh, they're closing down a day care because, uh, the
lady who owns, uh, slapped a child --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and, uh, she had a lot of, uh, [smack] like, uh, what did she have, uh,
like tickets against her, uh, saying that the, she didn't have proper food, uh,
prepared #for them# --

A.11:  #Oh, boy.#

B.12:  -- and that it was just dirty and and she didn't take very good care of the
kids and you know, you don't want to send your kids to place like that.

A.13:  No, it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if
people are doing it instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money and trying
to make ends meet then it's, it becomes an entirely different thing --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- and we reading about all these different things that go on, child abuse
--

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and people with criminal records, etcetera.  I think it would be very
frightening --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and I know some companies have child care facilities at the company, but
not many of them do.

B.22:  Right or you have to, uh, it's pretty expensive.  [laughter] I --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- the college I go to, they have, uh, child care, uh, there, but you still
have to pay.  You know, it doesn't come with them.

A.25:  Do you know how much it is?

B.26:  No, I don't.

A.27:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's what I've heard is that, that you've got to earn
an awful lot.  I mean, you know.

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  A lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out.
So that doesn't help.

B.30:  Right.  It's like, uh, uh, if you do work [laughter] most of the money goes
back into taking care of your child --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- you might as well stay home if you're married [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah.  [noise] That's right.  Well, I, I, and, and, uh, then there's the
question of you know, if what, what to look for, what's going to be, uh, what's
going to be a good price #and# --

B.34:  #Right.#

A.35:  -- and, uh, do they, do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother
stays home.  That's, that's a really difficult issue I know.

B.36:  Yeah, I've, I've heard a lot of things about that too.  Uh, with some
people say [noise] it's not healthy for your children to be in day care and
you know, other's say it is, so --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- I don't know [laughter].

A.39:  You, you haven't decided yet, huh?

B.40:  [Laughter]  Uh no.

A.41:  No, I think it's going to be hard.  I feel like I was, I was lucky to get
to be at home and there were a lot of times that it was boring and it, and it
certainly isn't true, is true that didn't, di-, didn't set me up for a career,
but at the same time, uh, it felt good to be there when they got home from
school [noise].

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Those were the stories that, that I got to hear.  It was even hard to get
their father to get to hear them.  You know, they would come home and they'd
say all this and then later on, you say well tell dad about, you know, and
they go, oh I already told you, #you know# --

B.44:  #Yeah.#

A.45:  -- it all gone kind of thing.

B.46:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

A.47:  And, and that parts good.  And you get to see them as they progress,
etcetera.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  But at the same time, if you don't have enough money or if you are trying
to build a career, you know, then you have to give everything up just to stay
home and I think that's a real question.

B.50:  Yeah, that is.  It's a tough decision [noise].

A.51:  And, uh, do you know, uh, you say they have it at school.  Is it for the
students --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- or for the teachers or for both?

B.54:  Uh, I think it's for the students.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  Yeah, I don't know if it wo-, it's, it makes sense to have it for the
teachers too --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- but, uh, I'm not really sure.  [laughter] I haven't looked into
[laughter] it.  I don't need it [laughter].

A.59:  Well, what about you and your own background.  Di-, did your mother or
father stay home or di-, did they work or,

B.60:  Uh, yeah, my mom stayed home.  Uh, she had four kids and she stayed home
with all of us until I got into about kindergarten and then she went, uh, back
to work #after.#

A.61:  #And so you# so you were in school.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  And when you came home from school was there some one there or was, uh,
what happened, uh, I mean did she get off when you got home or was there some
one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or --

B.64:  Uh.

A.65:  -- do you remember?

B.66:  For a while she was there, uh, when I got home, but then, uh, and she
started working later until like four and I would come home first and I, and
my brothers and sisters were all older than me, so.

A.67:  So, you had, there was some one there to take care of you.

B.68:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  Yeah, there was already somebody home.

A.71:  Yeah.  Cause I think that's another,
