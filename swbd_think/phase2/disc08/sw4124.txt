=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay supposedly we're recording right now.  

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  It's kind of interesting because nearly thirty minutes ago I was reading an
advertisement for the new Infinity, I forget what model number it was, but one
of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system.

B.4:  That's interesting.  I hadn't seen that.  I know there was a lot of talk
about freon contributing to the, the, uh, hole in the ozone layer and other
various pollution, but, uh, other than, uh, making the air conditioning
systems tighter, I didn't know that there was any work on, uh, alternate
coolants.

A.5:  Yeah, this is the first I had seen of it, too.  Uh, actually I was kind of,
I'm s-, kind of surprised that that has become as much of an issue as it has
because, you know, we know these things are designed to be closed systems.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  ((Either whether the problem's due to leaks)) or ((due to failures)), I
would think that, uh, if it was designed with reasonable prudence, stuff
wouldn't get loose, and, uh, I mean, you don't want it to, it's not cheap, and
((the thing)) fails when it does, so I'm kind of surprised it became as much
of an issue as it has.

B.8:  The, uh, the, the times that I've seen any sort of, of loss is, uh, at a
time when maybe I'd have, uh, the, the, uh, freon checked in the air
conditioner, or maybe topped off and it seemed to me that they'd practically
waste almost as much as, uh, they'd put in the car.  But I've --

A.9:  Uh.

B.10:  -- noticed in the past few years that,

A.11:  [Noise].

B.12:  uh, the controls on that are tighter.  

A.13:  Uh, yeah. 

B.14:  Uh, people are a lot more concerned about that.  

A.15:  So, what, what do you, what do you see as the other biggies being in that
realm?  You know, what else is something that is a bad thing?

B.16:  Well, obviously cars, uh, and trucks contribute quite a bit and personally
I'll, uh --

A.17:  Uh.

B.18:  -- I carpool, uh, most of the time with someone I work with, but my
schedule doesn't, uh, doesn't make for a consistent carpool.

A.19:  Yeah, I, uh, I traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen
miles per gallon of, worth of, o-, on premium and didn't, really wasn't happy
with premium, wasn't high enough to a car,

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  that gets about twenty-four miles to the gallon on, uh, the cheapest
garbage you can put it.

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  So I probably [laughter] contributed my share there, and, uh, kind of
interesting.  Course, uh, there is talk about legislation that would ban the
manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and, uh, this
I believe has, I read, has put the general aviation, uh, world going nuts
because a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to
fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  And if it flies a hundred hours a year, that's moderately high.  So, the
amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved, uh, are very, very tiny
as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's
running for a lot longer per year.  Uh, so it's a question of, uh, now
apparently, uh, the E P A thought about this again and decided that these,
that, that general aviation engines won't count and they'll allow them to
continue to burn unleaded fuels, but there's some concern over, if this is the
only market, is anybody going to want to bother making leaded fuels.

B.26:  That's a, that's a good question.  Uh, the leaded fuels have obviously been
out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk
about, uh, [throat_clearing] about regulating the emissions that a, a car
engine can produce and tightening down on that and, of course, the, uh, the
large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep
business just the same as usual.

A.27:  It's an old joke about the, uh, finest Congressman money can buy.

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  Uh, 

B.30:  [Breathing].

A.31:  Sounds like another issue.  Uh, yeah, I've always viewed it as, uh, the
pollution issue as a property rights issue.  If, uh, somebody dumped their
garbage ((in)) front lawn, uh, regularly you'd have legal recourse, but if he
dumps into the air surrounding your house, you really don't have any.  And,
uh, I think therein lies big part of the problem is that it's, it's viewed a
little differently from physical pollution.

B.32:  There's a big issue in Rhode Island right now.  Uh, there's a company that
wants to build a coal fired, uh, energy plant very close to, to downtown
Providence and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various
controls and inspections and regulations.  Apparently the, the regulate-,
