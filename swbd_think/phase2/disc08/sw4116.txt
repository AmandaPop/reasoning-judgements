B.1:  Hi [laughter].  This, this is drug testing for government employees only or
was it for everybody?

@A.2:  This is for everybod-, for, for private and commercial sector.  Uh, my
feelings are, is that I, I don't really think that they should test for drugs.
That i-, if you're going to take a job, you know, and then they say, well,

cost.  And when you have such a magnitude of people and --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- you have a company and you're trying to, you're trying to stay afloat
and you're, you're, you're, you're having to get these tests and these tests
are very expensive, so what happens is that sometimes you get so you're
getting through a, a testing company that's, we might say, just for terms of,
a fly by night company like,
