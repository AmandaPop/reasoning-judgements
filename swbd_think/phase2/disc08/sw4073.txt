============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  I guess we're recording now so.  Well, I think they could, uh, uh
our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them
to pick it up and stuff.

B.2:  Yeah.

A.3:  And then, they get paid for recycling it, so [laughter].

B.4:  [Inhaling].

A.5:  I don't know if that's very fair or not [noise].

B.6:  Well, Dallas is talking about starting something like that too.  It's going
to be, I don't know if it's three dollars a week, I think it's three dollars a
month [noise].  It what we are going to have to pay.

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  Uh, we do recycle --

A.9:  Oh.

B.10:  -- an awful lot of stuff here.  I, I, up until a couple of years ago, I use
to get paid, maybe not a lot, but I use to be able to find a place that I
could get, you know, a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound
for plastic and --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and
[inhaling] now days it's like I can't find one place that's going to take
everything --

A.13:  Yeah, well that's,

B.14:  -- and I am trying to recycle my, my kitchen waste by building a compost
pile and that's not easy either.  I wish I could figure out an easier way.

A.15:  [Laughter]  That's for sure.

B.16:  Of --

A.17:  Uh,  

B.18:  -- doing that but, uh,

A.19:  Well we, we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that
and then take it to Walmart because they use to have a recycling bin --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- and, but they got rid of them because there's lot of people were
throwing their trash and stuff in there so.

B.22:  And they just got rid of them.  Well, Kroger's, uh, at least in Dallas,
Kroger's will pay for aluminum and will collect the glass and the plastic.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  But they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they
don't collect cardboard.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  And I know the place at Galleria, there is one bin in their loading dock
area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there
so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and I have all these you
know cardboard packaging stuff left over then I go and I recycle that over
there, but it's, you know, I have to run around town to get [laughter] my
stuff recycled.

A.27:  Yeah.  I wish they had just one central place, you know, where you can just
dump it all [noise].

B.28:  Yeah.  Uh,

A.29:  Or in, you know, cause really I am not really looking for the the money
portion of it, you know, I just #(( )).#

B.30:  #Well I# use to.  It use to be a good days that for, instead of giving my
kids an allowance I just told them they could go around the neighborhood and
collect things to be recycled and then I would drive them over and they would
get some money --

A.31:  Oh yeah.

B.32:  -- and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them --

A.33:  Money.

B.34:  -- some money.

A.35:  Yeah, I've heard,

B.36:  And at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting
stuff recycled and but now it's just you know, I can't do that because they
don't earn any money for it and I hate to see that happen, #but# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- you know and I would also, I'd like to see the state, you know, they say
on all sorts of things, you know, the they (( )) people advertise, that they
(( )) their recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well
yeah in one small community they're recyclable, but there is nothing around
that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle you know --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- uh, you know, uh, they say all these plastics are recyclable, but nobody
will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff
that's four or six doesn't get recycled [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah and, uh, you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it
in with the rest of the plastic and stuff, you know, it's just,

B.42:  Well, like it has to be separated by number, why doesn't someone take it.
I mean I can't find, it's, I can't even find somewhere that will take the
stuff.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Yeah.  And I, I think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it
would be to require, uh, you know, government agencies and stuff were required
to use only recycled paper for instance --

A.45:  Yeah that's,

B.46:  -- and to define recycle paper as paper that includes, you know, material
that had actually been used as paper before --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper
like when they [noise] they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call
mill ends --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- you know, the little, the pieces from that they cut out from making the
envelopes --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- well that's what they are recycling.  Cause that never had any ink on
it.  That's what we usually send them to recycle.  It never had any ink on it.
They don't have to clean it.  They put that in with with fresh wood fiber --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- and they call that recycled paper.

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  You know, well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to
figure out how to, you know, how to clean up mag-,
