A.1:  So, what do you think about, uh, employers screening, you know, job
candidates for drug drug usage?

@B.2:  Well, I can kind of see it both ways because, uh, you don't want to get, I
guess I generally feel against it, but I can see why an employer wouldn't want
to have employees that are on drugs.

A.3:  #Right.#  

B.4:  #That# could cause all kinds of problems.  I'd, I would like to it, see
them be able to not need to screen more than [laughter] I would like to see
them screening.

A.5:  Right.  You think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of
screening?

B.6:  Right.  I think that we ought to be, uh, an employer certainly has the
right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that and
then if they say well, I am on drugs and then they say well we would rather
have somebody that isn't on drugs.

A.7:  [Laughter] But, a lot of times, people who are on drugs don't admit it.

B.8:  That's right, especially when they are trying to get a job and I guess
everybody knows that if they are trying to get a job that if they put down
that they are on drugs, they're not going to get it [laughter].

A.9:  Right.  Yeah.  I don't really have that much of a problem with drug
screening.  I think, uh, if [music] it's go-, effect their job performance,
uh, I think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  But, uh,

B.12:  I guess, it depends on the job.  Some jobs that, that on which public
safety depends like, uh, pilots and air traffic controllers, people who drive
the trains, uh, things like that, but I don't think SEPTA actually [laughter]
does, uh, repeat screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea.

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  I've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs.

A.15:  Yeah.  It always should be mandatory for some, uh, positions such as those.

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  But, uh,  

B.18:  But other, well I don't know.  Every job, right, I guess, I don't know I'd,
would obviously an employer doesn't want to have a person on drugs, but if
somebody is on drugs and they get into the work place, it might be, uh, uh, a
better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging
people.

A.19:  That's true.  That's true.  You, there has to be, that's, that's the key I
think is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs. [music] You got
to just, that's when you have to be careful.  [music] You know, you can't just
--

B.20:  That's right.

A.21:  -- fire every person.  Something needs to be done to help these kind of,
these people.

B.22:  That's right.  If they now behind the drug testing was something like that
so that it [music] wasn't that a person just didn't get a job --

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  -- that #if they ever test# --

A.25:  #They can go and,# 

B.26:  -- [Beep] uh, positive on drugs then they, if that were the case, then they
would be always unemployed.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  So,

A.29:  There should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean
themselves up and to be given a second chance.

B.30:  Well, some, perhaps a program, but [music] I know people go into programs
there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in
some ways good.  It lets them feel like they have support --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- but, on the other side, hand, it's, they need to be around people that
have their lives together --

A.33:  True [laughter].

B.34:  -- [Laughter] and are on drugs.  They need to be, then people who wouldn't
be getting into trouble as much if they, especially young people, here in
Philadelphia --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- if they had, if they were so busy during the day that when they went,
uh, when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep.

A.37:  Right,

B.38:  So, but if people are not working and they are just running around loose
with nothing to do, they got a lot of energy --

A.39:  Right.  Yeah.

B.40:  -- and it gets them into trouble.

A.41:  That's true.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I am thinking if, from my perspective,
let's say you owned a business and you would want to have the opportunity to
screen any, uh, candidate for a job within your own company --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and if you put yourself in that situation, you don't want to hire
someone who is on cocaine.

B.44:  Right.  Are you in business?

A.45:  No, but, I, I could.  It's something I may do eventually.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  So, uh, from that perspective, I can, I can see the need for drug testing.

B.48:  Right.  More, more or less for large businesses than small business, I
think.  Mostly, go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people may
know would say about them.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  So, if thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South
Carolina and hiring people and you know, even at fast food restaurants and, uh,
field work.  It's, the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and
talking to people and finding out who know what about who.

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  So, I guess it's kind of the old boy network. #They# --

A.53:  #Well, uh.#

B.54:  -- that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia [noise].

A.55:  Right.  Yeah, you can't really do that.  You could be hiring someone for,
uh, uh, a managerial white collar position in your company --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- and, uh, the person can appear very well qualified and and perfectly
normal but, uh, they may be having a lot more problems.

B.58:  Yeah.  They can,
