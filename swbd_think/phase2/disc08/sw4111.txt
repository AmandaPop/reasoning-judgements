=========================================================================

A.1:  Live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state and, uh,
it's just coincidental that that's the way it is, but my feelings happen to be
that I'm against capital punishment, uh, and I feel that it's barbaric.
Actually, it seems out of date with civilization as,

B.2:  Really?  Even if the, the crime is extremely, extremely serious?

A.3:  I think so, because I think what we're talking about is, is, uh, life
making and life taking decisions and I, I don't think any one human being has
the right to take away the life of any other human being.  Not that it's a, a
religious feeling or anything like that, but it seems hypocritical to me that
we'd say, in the case of murder, for instance, that, uh, because you took away
somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong, we are going to take
away your life.  I don't see that that makes any sense really.

B.4:  Well, it's not necessarily someone has the right, but we do have the
responsibility to punish criminals.  So if some person just blatantly
slaughtered, painfully killed ten people, does he really have the right to,
t-, continue living and be a burden on society?

A.5:  I don't think it's a matter of the, of the murderer's rights.  I think it's
a matter of our, uh, penal people's rights.  And I don't think they have the
right to take away a life, no.  I think definitely, there should be, uh,
severe punishment, uh, to deter other people from doing such heinous crimes.
Uh, for instance, I think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody
who commits any murder of any sort, and I also think that, uh, other things
that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as
putting prisoners to work --

B.6:  Yeah, I agree -- 

A.7:  -- and making them earn their -- 

B.8:  -- with that part.  

A.9:  -- their pay. 

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  But --

B.12:  Def-,

A.13:  -- I think life imprisonment is a much better alternative to, uh, people
that perform crimes.  I think also people that are prone to commit a murder
are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death.  I think
that if they're, uh, the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing,
that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them, that that wouldn't change
things as far as what they were capable of doing.  So, I don't see it as much
of a deterrent either.

B.14:  Well, some criminals would see it a-, a life in jail doesn't particularly
sound too harsh to someone who has been living on the street, you know, for
all his life and, and, uh, jail, jail time would seem like, uh, know, a break
or a, a paid, paid sustenance for the rest of his life.

A.15:  Yeah, I think that's unfortunate.  That is probably the way it is today,
and I think that ought to be changed.  Uh, I think, like I said, I think
people ought to be made to pay for their stay --

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  -- and not make it pleasant for them.  

B.18:  Make it,

A.19:  I think hard labor --

B.20:  #Make it harsh as possible.#

A.21:  -- #should be required# even among people that are not able to perform hard
labor, you know.  If th-, if they die naturally from working, then I guess
that would be okay --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- because that wouldn't be, uh, putting anybody to death forcibly, but,
uh, I, I can't see, I can't see executing people.  It just seems so barbar-,
barbaric in these times.

B.24:  Uh, well, I live in California.  I'm not really up on it.  I, I think we
don't have capital punishment either.  Uh,

A.25:  In California?  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  I, I thought there was, but I could be wrong.  What amazes me is how many
people speak out in favor of capital punishment, even here in New York.
People really want to see it, uh, be put into effect it seems.

B.28:  Well,    

A.29:  More so than those of us who feel the way I feel, uh, at least are vocal
saying that, no, they want things to stay the way they are.  Lot of people
want to see capital punishment --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- made legal.  

B.32:  I'm one of those guys [laughter].  

A.33:  Okay, uh, I guess, uh, I guess we did what we have to do -- 

B.34:  Okay.  

A.35:  -- and I don't see any instructions as far as doing anything else, so I,
uh, it was nice talking with you.

B.36:  You, too.  

A.37:  Okay, take care.  

B.38:  You, too, bye-bye.  

A.39:  Bye.
