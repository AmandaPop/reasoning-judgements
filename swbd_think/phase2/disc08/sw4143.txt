==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, uh, I know in some of the, one of the smaller towns around
Dallas they started curbside recycling --

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- and that's going really well, uh, because they, I think what hap-, what
goes on is, they get like dis-, they get charged, not by the amount of trash
they do, well, they get charged by, for the pick up of the trash and not for
the recyclables.

B.4:  Oh. 

A.5:  So it's, so you get p-, you pay less to have your trash picked up be-, if
you presort all, out all your trash, all your recyclables.

B.6:  Oh, that sounds great.  

A.7:  What are they doing out there?

B.8:  Well, it's sort of a mixed bag up here.  Uh, some of the communities have
started off with volunteer recycling.  Uh, one of the towns near here,
Cambridge, uh, had a couple years of volunteer recycling.  I never saw it, but
I know I fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing,
just hundreds or, you know, maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on
the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting
things.

A.9:  Wow.  

B.10:  And when the volume reached a certain level, the city's Department of
Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Uh, my town, Arlington has had a, uh, a similar volunteer program and they
just got the Department of Public Works to do a, uh, a daily drop off at their
yard where, you know, people can bring in glass and, and, uh, paper and, and
whatnot and aluminum and tin.  And some of the other towns around here, fact,
just about all the towns that border Arlington where I live have gone to the
curbside recycling and I really wish we'd do it here.  It's just so much
easier for people, I think it's, it probably results in a larger volume of
stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a
week.

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  As it is here, I sort of resent the effort, to, you know, collect
everything until I have a chance to get down to the D P W yard and drop it
off.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  You know, it's not a huge inconvenience, but it's just one more thing to
do.

A.17:  And it's hard to find, I know at least here, it's hard to find places that
w-, that recycle and so many things are recyclable, like shampoo bottles and
water bottles --

B.18:  Um.  

A.19:  -- but no place will take them and, you know, I mean, they're real
specific, you know, you can do your newspapers, but you have to take all the
slick stuff out, you know, and, well, what do you do with the slick stuff?

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  I mean they're so specific, I mean, I know in Dallas they're having a real
hard time right now because the drop off sites --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- people aren't, there's a, you know, what they say, that a couple people
can mess it up for everybody --

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  -- and there's some people that are not sorting out, uh, like their slick
stuff out of their newspapers and, uh, all their plastic bottles, or their
brown glass out of their clear glass, and the companies that recycle the stuff
won't recycle it then.

B.26:  Oh, boy.  

A.27:  And they'll just trash it, so that all the effort goes downhill.

B.28:  Boy, that's [laughter] a real problem.  I really hate to hear that.  Just
regarding the newspapers, the one curbside thing we to have in my town
actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers which is nice and the
rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper, even the slick, uh, ad
inserts they'll pick up and that's great.

A.29:  Really?  

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  That is great.  Gee, I, I didn't, I, I just thought there was something in
the slick stuff that, that made it so they couldn't recycle it.  Well, that's
great.

B.32:  Yeah, I, I guess it depends on the facility it's going to.  The thing that,
I guess the flip side of that and, in our town anyway, is that they won't pick
up plastics now, and even when they were here and in other towns around here,
they won't take so called injection molded things which, I guess, basically,
is containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt
containers --

A.33:  Oh, okay.  

B.34:  -- typically.  

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  And, uh, you know, I don't know about Dallas, but [laughter] I think people
around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so,

A.37:  [Laughter]. 

B.38:  there's just a lot of, lot of containers that, uh, that wind up getting
tossed --

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  -- you know, without being recycled.  

A.41:  Um.  

B.42:  And I don't know what's going on with, in terms of capacity.  It's my
impression, although I haven't really read anything about it that so many
towns and cities have started recycling with, there might not be enough firms
out there that are willing to take the, uh, or, you know, that will pay decent
money to take the materials.

A.43:  Right, right.  I know, well, I know here at, uh, I, I'm in, I'm in college
--

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- and, uh, we have more than one campus and I'm on the kind of like an off
branch campus --

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- and on the main campus they've got a company that comes in and takes out
all the recyclables, all the copy paper and all the cardboard boxes, I mean
everything that's recyclable.

B.48:   Oh, that's great.
