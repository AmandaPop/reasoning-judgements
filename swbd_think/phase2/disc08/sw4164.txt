B.1:  Hello Larry.

A.2:  [Clicking] Sounds like you've got this, uh --

B.3:  Huh?

A.4:  -- sounds like you're ready to take a stab at it so why don't you go ahead.

@B.5:  Okay.  Well I, you know, I think that, uh, I think it's fine to do that
but I don't think it should be mandatory.  I'm not,

A.6:  [Noise].

B.7:  I'm not for having the equivalent of a draft.

A.8:  Yeah.  I happen to, uh, this will be a real short one cause I happen to
agree with you.  Uh, I think in principal, it's a very, very good thing.  But
when you make it mandatory, uh, now you're talking about slavery.

B.9:  [Inhaling] That's right.  It, uh,

A.10:  [Laughter] It comes down to, uh, the, uh, it's kind of fun to go (( )).  It
picked the same topic, uh, last time I (( )) in.

B.11:  Oh, is that right?

A.12:  And, uh, you know, which I didn't know it would do.  Uh, you know, one of
the, uh, things they're trying to think of is ways you could create or maybe
create is wrong, but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same
goal.

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  How could you make it, uh, more desired and respected in society for people
to voluntarily, uh, engage in public service.

B.15:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'd say, as far as government jobs, uh, they could, uh, have
some incentive.  For instance, veterans get a preference when they're applying
for a government job and --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- I'd say people that had voluntarily served in such a thing as the Peace
Corp or, or something [inhaling] --

A.18:  Yeah, yeah.

B.19:  -- could also get that.

A.20:  Yeah.  The, uh, what do they call it, uh, [lipsmack] I'm not sure how you
would do that outside of the government sector though.

B.21:  I don't know either.

A.22:  And, uh, #you know, I, I kind# --

B.23:  #And I'm not sure we'd want it.#

A.24:  -- of hope against reality sadly that, uh, the government sector will get
smaller in time but there's indications that it won't.

B.25:  Right.

A.26:  [Laughter] You know.

B.27:  I feel the same way.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  Uh, I think that, uh, I have nothing against the draft when, you know,
when, when the nation needs it.  Uh, but obviously, when you don't need it,
you don't have a draft.  And I feel the same thing with universal service.  If
there was a need for it, [inhaling] then I'd say, uh, possibly.  I mean but it
would to be an emergency type thing.  And I, and I don't see that ever
happening.  #Uh,# 

A.30:  #You know,# my, uh, my interpretation of history is, is, is that, uh,

B.31:  [Chiming].

A.32:  when there's a real need, there's usually no shortage of volunteers.  You
know, you look at what happened, uh, in California with the earthquake.  There
was plenty of, volunteering.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  You, you look at World War Two, there were plenty of volunteers.

B.35:  That's right.

A.36:  Uh, you look at (( )) Vietnam, all of a sudden (( )) of volunteers.  

B.37:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.38:  And, uh, you know, the question of when do you quote need unquoted, on a,
say for example, a draft, uh, maybe it's the other way around.  Maybe the
willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it
or not.

B.39:  Uh-huh.  That's, that's true.  

A.40:  Yeah.  Cause, uh, you know, if all you got to do is, uh, print up a few
million draft cards to start a war #[laughter] you know [laughter]# --

B.41:  #[Laughter] Right.#

A.42:  -- you, it may be a powerful inc-, you know, what do you call it, uh, (( ))
may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of, you know, keep, keeping
us out of, may make it a little more difficult to get into war.

B.43:  #Right.#

A.44:  #You# know, there are times you need to.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  I don't perceive myself as a pacifist by any means.  But, uh, you know, the
pro-, there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't
have.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  I don't think every time we, uh, wandered into some place it was (( )).  I
think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else.

B.49:  Right.  I think about on, on public service too, I think it has some, some
thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public
service.

A.50:  Indeed.

B.51:  And, and that would have a bearing on what training should they have
#because# --

A.52:  #Huh.#

B.53:  -- if you wanted to have people, you know, as an incentive,

A.54:  [Clicking].

B.55:  you can have people go in after high school and then offer them assistance
with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have
an expertise in any particular but, uh, any particular field, but they'd be
willing hands so, so to speak #on public service projects.#

A.56:  #Huh.  Well, you know,# I, I will say, given a choice between somebody with
expertise and no interest in working and someone who is enthusiastic but lacks
the skill --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- I'll take the enthusiasm any day --

B.59:  Right.  

A.60:  -- cause you can train that person.

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  But somebody that's got no incentive, I'm not really sure what you can do.

B.63:  Are you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corp back in the thirties?

A.64:  No.  It was before my time.

B.65:  Okay.  Well, I mean, it's before my time too.

A.66:  [Laughter].

B.67:  I, I read about it.  But, you know, in the height of the depression --

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  -- the government employed people to go work on #public service projects.#

A.70:  #Was it like, uh, W P A?#

B.71:  That's right.  Like W P A.  

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  It was the same thing.  And there were many, uh, a lot of the national
parks were built up by the Civilian --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- Conservation Corp and a lot of W P A projects are still serving, uh, uh,
the nation.

A.76:  Yeah, yeah.

B.77:  So, uh, someth-, you know, uh, unskilled people could, could do things like
that as long as they had a positive attitude.

A.78:  Huh.  Yeah.  My only concern about projects like that, you know, (( )).  My
concern is, uh, you've got this resource whether it's, uh, unemployed people,
whether it's volunteers, what have you.  You've got this resource.  And what
is the best way to target where you're going to point it.  Uh, you know, I
don't know the answer to that.  I'm not automatically,
