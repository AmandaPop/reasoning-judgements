A.1:  Ever, uh, hello?  

B.2:  Hello.  

A.3:  Yeah, okay, so we're started.  

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  I guess, I'll p-, press one again [beep].  There.  Uh, I'm surprised it's
not telling us that, that, uh, we're going, but at any rate,

B.6:  Okay.  

@A.7:  Uh, had, do you have such a program, uh, where you work?

B.8:  No, I don't and, uh, I can't say that I'm unhappy that we don't, uh, or
happy, you know, either way.  I guess not being, not being involved in it, uh,

A.9:  Well, I'll tell you the truth, when it, when it was introduced at Texas
Instruments there was a lot of hard feeling.  Now, my initial reaction was
benign.  I, uh, really didn't feel, as a matter of fact, I was sort of
sympathetic in the sense that, uh, uh, you know, we, we want to stamp out, uh,
drug use.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  Uh, and, uh, the, it's certainly no good for the company to have employees
who are on drugs.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  Uh, [lipsmack] and I don't really consider it, uh, an invasion of privacy,
uh, in the s-, because, uh, drug use is, uh, a dangerous influence on other
people in society.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  Uh, there, I was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who, uh,
[lipsmack] were rabidly opposed to it and --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- I, I gradually became proselytized, uh, by this group and the, to me,
the big sensitive thing is, well, the, there couple things.  One is the, is
the insult of it, perhaps as a, uh, [lipsmack] pre-employment test is one
thing, but to come in post facto and say to, uh, employees who are tried and
proven, uh, that they've been asked to do, they're going to have to submit to
drug test is --

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- sort of a slap in the face.  

B.20:  Oh, yeah, you know, I might, I might see a case as well, where it might be
warranted in, uh, someone who obviously had a problem with it, uh, someone who
had, uh, well, I won't say behavioral problems, but, uh, you know, noticeable
signs or, you know, got caught on the job, you know, uh, in that case, if they
really wanted to help the employee in sort of an enforced, uh, enforced clean
period, uh, but, you know,

A.21:  And of course, there are problems with doing that, you realize, because,
uh, this requires a very strong minded management and, uh, uh, a supervisory,
it requires the supervisor to be brass balled in a sense to go to a, an
employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say
[throat_clearing] you've got to take a drug test.

B.22:  Yeah.  I,

A.23:  Uh, as opposed to randomly requiring it of everyone.  

B.24:  That's true.  That, that sort of sing-, singling a person out, I guess I
could see that side of it, of it as well.  Well, you can see, I really haven't
given it a whole lot of thought.  I'm, I work for a privately held, uh,
[inhaling] uh, systems integrator and, uh, we are family oriented as a company
and, uh, we, we don't have, uh, any, any problems that, uh, anyone knows
about, if you know what I mean.  There may be problems, but no one is aware of
them.

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  So, it, it's sort of a, an invisible thing for us.  Uh, [throat_clearing]
there's no real requirement for it.  Uh, I did work for a company where I had
to take a psyche profile once, but, uh, [lipsmack] that's another story.

A.27:  Was that on a need, on a need basis or,

B.28:  No.  

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  Oh, uh, uh, uh, everybody had to take one.

A.31:  Oh, I see, all right.  

B.32:  But, uh, [laughter] thank you very much.  That's, uh, that's another,
that's another matter entirely, but, yeah, I guess, uh, I guess I would say,
no, now that, now that, uh, you presented that case, I would have to say,
that, uh, random i-, if it were going to be done, random would be the only way
to do it, otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out.

A.33:  Uh, right.  Uh, I guess the other objection that I was exposed to at Texas
Instruments was the, uh, [lipsmack] unproductive nature of it.  That,
basically, uh, drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the
corporation, I think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the
good graces of their customer, the government --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- uh, rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use
because the, the likelihood of finding drug users in the T I population is
very, very low.

B.36:  Oh, sure, you have to be sharp.   

A.37:  And, uh, and so, uh, people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the,
the testing, uh, requirement from the government,
