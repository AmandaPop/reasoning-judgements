B.1:  Okay.  

A.2:  So,

B.3:  Uh,

A.4:  Do you live in a high crime area?  

B.5:  Oh, it's, uh, yes and it's, the crime mostly in this area is, uh, burglary
--

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  -- house break-ins.  In fact, our car, our son's, uh, car was broken into
about two weekends ago, three weekends ago.  They stole a stereo, and it was
parked right out in front of our house.  It just --

A.8:  Oh.  

B.9:  -- it happened overnight, but there's a, uh, we, we had a break-in at our
place, our house about three years ago and bought an alarm system by, within
five days after that.

A.10:  Do you -- 

B.11:  Uh,   

A.12:  -- think that, that will do it?  

B.13:  Oh, I don't think anything is going to be, uh, f-, foolproof.  I think
it's, it's a deterrent.  I think if they have a choice between our place and
one house that's not protected, they'll go --

A.14:  They'll go to the ot-,

B.15:  -- to the other place.  

A.16:  Yeah,

B.17:  But, uh,

A.18:  Huh.  

B.19:  It's, uh, we live in, uh, well, I live in Richardson, actually.

A.20:  Oh. 

B.21:  You say Arlington, do you mean Arlington, Texas?  

A.22:  Yeah.  

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:  Arlington, Texas.  

B.25:  Yeah, and, uh, the crime out here is mostly of the break-in type and --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- vandalism and sort of stuff like that.  I don't think there,

A.28:  You don't have much street crime.  
 
B.29: N-, [breathing] no, as far as, uh, muggings and murders and stuff like
that?

A.30:  Right.  

B.31:  Uh, that's pretty isolated, pretty rare --

A.32:  Um {very faint}.

B.33:  -- I think, w-, knock on wood.  

A.34:  That's what I would think in that area.  

B.35:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.  

A.36:  Yeah, so, what do you think you can do to,

B.37:  Oh, [breathing], you know, I, I think a lot of the crime is c-, committed
by people that are trying to, uh, finance their next fix, and, uh --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- it's, you know, that goes back to a drug problem -- 

A.40:  Right.  

B.41:  -- and, uh, nobody's been able to solve that, yet.  I think it's, uh, drug
related and then a lot of it starts in the homes and, uh --

A.42:  Right.

B.43:  -- the, the, uh, break-up of -- 

A.44:  Family unit --  

B.45:  -- break-up of --

A.46:  -- you mean?

B.47:  -- the family unit's caused a lot of the problems.  I mean the dad is gone
for one reason or another, the --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  -- mother's raising the kids and, uh, they just get, there's no discipline
--

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  -- at the, at the home so it just goes from bad to worse.  It just starts
there and leads, leads from that into the drug situation and then as I said
they're trying to finance their next, uh --

A.52:  Fix.  

B.53:  -- next fix, so --

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  -- they're desperate, uh,

A.56:  Yeah, and that's what the, uh, seems like,

B.57:  [Throat_clearing].

A.58:  the, uh, genre of the crime these days is a lot of desperate people --

B.59:  Uh-huh.  

A.60:  -- whereas I think probably fifty years ago -- 

B.61:  Right, yeah.  

A.62:  -- the crime wasn't quite so intense that way.  

B.63:  Probably --

A.64:  And it,  

B.65:  -- wasn't as personal as it is today.  

A.66:  Yeah.  

B.67:  I mean, b-, with the, uh, muggings --

A.68:  With the,  

B.69:  -- and the --

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  -- break-ins of the houses and so forth.  Then th-, there just wasn't as
much of it I, I imagine, as, as there is now.

A.72:  Well, I mean, I think the reasons were different back then more --

B.73:  Yeah.  

A.74:  -- than they are now, like you're saying, the drugs -- 

B.75:  Yeah.  

A.76:  -- can make people really desperate so that makes them also very dangerous.

B.77:  Yeah.  

A.78:  Uh,    

B.79:  Well, I think the courts are to blame.  I, I, I just think they're, they're
overly lenient on these people and,

A.80:  Uh-huh.  

B.81:  I was watching LARRY KING LIVE there and they were, they were talking about
rape and castration and so forth and --

A.82:  Uh-huh.  

B.83:  -- there's always so much concern about the, uh, the rapist and the, the
burglar and so forth --

A.84:  Yeah.  

B.85:  -- and no concern at all about the victim.  

A.86:  Yeah, that's really disgusting.  

B.87:  Yeah, so, uh,

A.88:  Yeah.  

B.89:  It, I think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul, but it starts
in the family, but it's --

A.90:  Uh-huh.  

B.91:  -- everybody's [laughter] to blame -- 

A.92:  Right.  

B.93:  -- I think, at least, a lot of, probably a lot of apathy -- 

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  -- on the part of people that haven't been, uh, victimized.  

A.96:  Oh, yeah, because they have no idea what it's like.  

B.97:  Right.  

A.98:  Yeah.  

B.99:  So, uh, it, it, it's just a big problem and, uh, there's so many other
problems to go around, and economy's a problem and, I guess at one time --

A.100:  Uh-huh.  

B.101:  -- Russia was a problem and, uh every, there, there's always one problem or
another seems to be, uh, ahead of the crime problem, but, uh --

A.102:  Right.  

B.103:  -- that's probably, that has to be one of the top two or three.

A.104:  Well, I think, for the U S, I think base-, from what I've read, that the
U S has one of the highest crime rates in the world.

B.105:  Uh-huh.  

A.106:  So I think that's a priority.  

B.107:  Yeah, you know, I think we think we're real sophisticated, we're really not
--

A.108:  We're not.  

B.109:  -- as it comes right down, there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways
and the roads when you're driving around, thought --

A.110:  Uh-huh.  

B.111:  -- by people that are, that you makes, makes you wonder whether they're not
just jerks or not.  I mean --

A.112:  Right [laughter].  

B.113:  -- they just do crazy thing.  They, they're not breaking the law, but they
just do some crazy things and --

A.114:  Yeah.  

B.115:  -- oh, I don't know, it's, it's kind of disgusting, but they, we're really
not all that sophisticated over here.

A.116:  No, if you come down to it, if you look at, uh, the statistics on child
abuse --

B.117:  Uh-huh.  

A.118:  -- and, uh, violence --  

B.119:  Um.  

A.120:  -- against women and, uh, the drug wars and, uh, also, uh, let's see, I
think with, like, with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men
--

B.121:  What's that?  

A.122:  -- or boys.  Rape.  

B.123:  Yeah.  

A.124:  The, the amount of rape.  

B.125:  Uh-huh.  

A.126:  And, uh, uh, like with the drugs, I think that one solution that I kn-, I
hate to say it, but, is legalization --

B.127:  Uh-huh.  

A.128:  -- because that's where all the d-, the gangs get their power --

B.129:  Uh-huh.  

A.130:  -- over the drugs because it's illegal.  

B.131:  Right.  

A.132:  And, uh, I, there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that.

B.133:  Yeah.  

A.134:  But, just nothing else seems to be working.  

B.135:  Yeah, I was going to say, it's worth a,
