===========================================================================

A.1:  [Laughter] I don't believe ((that we're)),

B.2:  So what do you think about, uh, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie?

A.3:  [Breathing] The recycling program here is just terrible.  I mean it's hard
to find places to go.  I mean, Kroger does a couple things.  They, I don't
think they, do they do newspapers?

B.4:  I don't know, there's, there's big bins out there, I don't know if they
ever get [breathing], I, I really don't know what the details are.  There
should be someplace where you could call and find out.  As a matter of fact,
I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, you
know, thing to you, but, I think there should be some kind of curbside
service.

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  That's the only way I could really,

A.7:  The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything.  They pick
up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you
know, like soup comes in and stuff.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  They pick up everything.  

B.10:  During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people
see-, I mean, they all have like shopping carts and --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- stuff and they're go around and collect cans --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and aluminum and stuff, and so we used to just save them up and then
they'd come around and we'd give them to them.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  But, when, during the winter time I think they, they move south or
something --

A.17:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.18:  -- so, I don't do that anymore.  And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech,
like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center --

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- they never empty those things.

A.21:  I know it, I know it.  

B.22:  They just overflow.  

A.23:  It piles up.  

B.24:  So what's a guy to do?  

A.25:  [Snorting]. 

B.26:  You know.   

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  I just don't know.   

B.30:  I asked myself.  

A.31:  I just don't know and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little
more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at
the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff.

B.32:  Really?  Huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that.  That is
very inconvenient.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  Inconvenient, even [laughter].  

A.35:  I know it, I know it.  

B.36:  But, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?  

A.37:  Oh, yeah.  

B.38:  Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.  

A.39:  The (( )),

B.40:  If I, if see a, s-, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- I'll throw it in there [laughter], but I don't really, I don't ever take
anything.

A.43:  Well, I mean, it's real, [breathing] you ought to, because the, the, the
farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  And since we go there all the time, I mean --

B.46:  [Laughter] But wait --

A.47:  -- probably (( )) at all.

B.48:  -- I've never seen you before [laughter].  

A.49:  [Laughter]. 

B.50:  Who are you?  

A.51:  Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.  

B.52:  Yeah, my name's Bill.  Well,

A.53:  Hi.  

B.54:  Hi.  

A.55:  I'm from Atlanta.  

B.56:  Me, too.  

A.57:  Neat.  

B.58:  Crazy.  

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your
recycling philosophy, Julie?

A.61:  I just think that everybody ought to do it.  

B.62:  Do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you
recycle, do you know?

A.63:  The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.  

B.64:  Really?  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  What about like those grocery bags?  

A.67:  Oh, yeah, they have, uh, [breathing] uh, what I, what I used to, uh, now
that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, but I used to
just save up the ones that I got one time --

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  -- and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and
over.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  A-, but, also most places, like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger
does or not but,

B.72:  They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.

A.73:  Yeah, and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your
old bags in.

B.74:  uh.  

A.75:  Can bring them in.  

B.76:  Those petroleum products are going to kill us.  

A.77:  I know it, I know it.  

B.78:  The hostile planet, I think,

A.79:  [Laughter].  

B.80:  Julie.  

A.81:  It really is a small,

B.82:  #[Laughter].#

A.83:  #[Laughter]# hostile planet [laughter].  

B.84:  The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the
big, uh, you know --

A.85:  Did you know that,

B.86:  -- the great Satan of the recycling.  

A.87:  No, really not.  Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of
the world's landfills is like paper?

B.88:  Um.  

A.89:  Filled with paper.  

B.90:  Paper just seems so innocuous.  

A.91:  Huh?  

B.92:  Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.  

A.93:  Well, it is, it is, though.  

B.94:  It comes from trees.  How can it be bad?  

A.95:  It is, because they,   

B.96:  They treat it with chemicals or something?  Why can't trees break down?  I
don't get it.

A.97:  Well, they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper, you know --

B.98:  Yep.

A.99:  -- takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.

B.100:  Oh {faint}.

A.101:  You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a
couple of weeks.

B.102:  Really?  

A.103:  Yeah -- 

B.104:  Huh.  

A.105:  -- it will be whole.  You'll be able to read -- 

B.106:  I'm #going to switch# -- 

A.107:  -- #off of it.#  

B.108:  -- from those yellow legal pads, then.  

A.109:  Yeah, um.  

B.110:  I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work and,
uh,

A.111:  [Laughter]. 

B.112:  But I can just --

A.113:  W-,  

B.114:  -- forget that from now on.  I'm going u-, I'm going to switch to the white
ones.

A.115:  Well, white paper's bad too.  They, they treat it, too.  

B.116:  Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of bam-, you know, bamboo
stuff, from the --

A.117:  I'm sure that's fine.  

B.118:  -- from the --

A.119:  #I'm sure.#

B.120:  -- #banks of# the Nile.  

A.121:  Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.  

B.122:  You think so?  

A.123:  Maybe.  

B.124:  Tablets?  

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word --

A.127:  You think? 

B.128:  -- altogether, you know. 

A.129:  I don't know, well, I mean,

B.130:  What do you think?  

A.131:  I think we've kind of, you know, I mean, everybody, ((everybody)) --

B.132:  Kind of radical, I know but,

A.133:  -- [Laughter] everybody has a computer.  

B.134:  [Laughter]. 

A.135:  We would no longer need -- 

B.136:  That's true.  

A.137:  -- paper at all.  

B.138:  Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist,

A.139:  [Laughter]. 

B.140:  like, uh, Dick Tracy.  

A.141:  I would love that.
