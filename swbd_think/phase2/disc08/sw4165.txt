=============================================================================

A.1:  [Click] Steve, this is, like I mentioned, Brian and I guess we're going to
want to be talking about child care.  Uh, do you have any experience in, uh,
finding child care?

B.2:  [TV] Well, ourselves, we have [sigh], I guess never had to look for child
care.

@A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  But, uh, [throat_clearing] and so, you know, you go back those many years
and, uh, we didn't do it very much.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  We, I guess, we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at,
uh, two family income at the time [swallowing].

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And our kids were older.  But I've had to deal with, uh, you know, friends
of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  Uh, so it, my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been, you know,
certainly exposed to criteria people are using.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  How about yourself?

A.15:  Well, uh, we're kind of lucky.  I, I'm, uh, I'm working.  My wife isn't
working and she is taking care of the kids also.  And, and so we haven't had
to look for child care either which has been very nice.  But I do have, like
you mentioned, a lot of friends, a lot of, uh, co-workers and associates that
are looking for child care and some of the things that they're very critical
about is the number of kids that are in the child care.  Uh, what kind of, you
know, uh, guidance counselor to student or, you know, uh, adult to child
relationship.  #How many# --

B.16:  #Right.#

A.17:  -- you know, you don't want to have thirty or forty [laughter] kids and
only one adult.  #Then# --

B.18:  #Right.#

A.19:  -- uh, something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to, uh, accommodate
or take care of the kids very well.

B.20:  ((Right)) [throat_clearing].

A.21:  And, uh, they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not
just playing around all the time.  So, you know, depends also upon the, the
level of the child.  We, uh, we, uh, take a very close look at finding a, a
preschool, a good preschool for our kid.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And I kind of relate that to that in, in making sure that the, the, uh,
teachers are very well educated themselves.  They have a good curriculum and
that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them.  And
it's very important, I feel, uh, that the kids interact with other children
also.  It's a, it's a good way to develop --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- relationships with other kids their age and, uh, get to know and work
with kids.  So. I don't know.  I, I guess we're kind of in the same boat.  We
haven't had to look very carefully for child care.

B.26:  Yeah.  I, [throat_clearing] I kind of think that, uh, you know, some of our
friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to
look for child care.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But even, you know, here.  I guess we have [inhaling] in one sense two
forms [sigh] of, uh, child care.  There's where individuals will [swallowing]
in one, primarily babysit --

A.29:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.30:  -- children in their own home.  And that will be groups of anywhere
{mispronounced} from one or two to, maybe, seven or eight children.

A.31:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.32:  And then otherwise, there will be [throat_clearing], the majority are
co-operative day-cares.  Uh, people form a co-op and, uh, parents will work in
the co-op and put a fair number of hours.  Frequently, they will hire staff to
be at the day-care and the emphasis is primarily, uh, someplace for the
children to be.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  But, at the same time, there's some fairly good training programs and, and
some of them formal two year programs.

A.35:  Right, right [noise].

B.36:  Uh, so that, you know, there is some definite, uh, creative play, good
social interaction, that kind of thing.

A.37:  I think it's, uh, important.  Like you mentioned, that's a good idea on
the, uh, parent co-op because, uh, [swallowing] I'm very concerned about the
welfare of my kids and I don't want to just take them to somebody I pick out
of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere.  I want to trust the people
[swallowing].

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  And, uh, you know, you hear in the newspa-, you hear on the T V and you
read the newspaper quite often of, of people that, you know, don't treat or
take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of, so.
And hope to never get into that situation where we have to, have to find
somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children.  And
hope that we can stay in this situation [laughter] for awhile.  So.

B.40:  Yeah.  You know, we've even had some of those kinds of situations
publicized here --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and [throat_clearing] I guess, you know, it, are, it's, uh, typically,
uh, whether it's been child care in a home [swallowing] --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution.
And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem
children and it's not, and it's more of a group home rather #than# --

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  -- actually day-care #s-, type of facility.#

A.47:  #[Laughter]# That's true, that's true.

B.48:  Uh [/TV]. 

A.49:  Well, Steven, it's been,
