A.1:  So you don't, oh, uh, random drug testing is kind of tough because it, it
involves this kind of, uh, trading off of, of our individual civil rights for
some kind of concept of, uh, furthering a common good almost.  You know, th-,
there's a, there's a, there's a trade off of our civil rights against, I guess
our employer's right to, to having a good job or something.

B.2:  Uh, I don't, don't really see the employers as having a whole lot to do
with it.  I've already it the, uh, privilege of being a victim of random drug
testing.  I spent four years in the Marine Corps --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- and had to pee in a bottle on command and it was really, a really
aggravating and time wasting thing to do.  Uh, the thing that I really hated
most about it was the total waste behind it all.  They would get maybe,
between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would, you know,
we'd lose the whole morning, what is that, that's a thousand man hours, uh, to
go, go through this and in the end, they would just be shooting for trying to
catch a few specific people.  It really aggravated me.  I wasn't happy with it
at all.  In fact, after I got out I made the decision that I would not work
for a company that did that.  Uh, it just doesn't seem right that a company
would do something like that.  I can appreciate, uh, concern over somebody
being under the influence while they're at work, but they could easily be
under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well.

A.5:  Yeah, uh, well, that's a good point.  The only, uh, the only thing I really
disagree with is, a-, and this isn't s-, this isn't exactly disagreement, I'm
not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people.  But I would
think that it also acts as a deterrent.  If someone, if someone knows that
there's a threat that, that they might get caught, it might be that much more
of an impetus to, to stay away from whatever the drug is they're, they're on.

B.6:  That's implying that, uh, as a punitive kind of a thing as well, you
definitely want to discourage that.  Is that kind of what you're saying?

A.7:  Well, I mean, I would think that, uh, if someone knows that there's,
there's an even greater chance that they're going to get caught, uh, having
drugs that, that that would act to discourage them.  That it would, uh, you
know, if you know dad's in the other room perhaps, you're going to be less
likely to steal the, the cookies out of the cookie jar because he might be
coming in any minute, you know.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  Well, I guess that's a good policy then if, uh, you're definitely
for eradicating drugs from society.  I'm not so certain that that's a, a
worthwhile goal right now.  It looks like there's a lot of problems with, uh,
you know, keeping drugs illegal.  Things that are really scary.  A lot of
people are dying and there's a lot of bloodshed and that, that disturbs me.  I
live downtown --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and, uh, man, right diagonal across from campus is, uh, Teakwood Homes.
It's the oldest housing project in the country.  Roosevelt opened it and man,
there's shootings in there nightly and if it wasn't for the, uh, you know,
the, the high profit margin, I don't think it would be going on.  I don't
think that, uh, we'd have the crime over there that we do and man, it really
spills over into the neighborhood here as well.  There's at least one nasty,
bloody, violent crime per year, uh, over here where one of the students is a
victim.

A.11:  Well, the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and I, I
forget his name, but one thing that he suggested doing was taking the money,
taking all the money that he gets for, uh, uh, fighting the war on drugs and
use it for, like, drug education to, to open up the methadone programs to get
the people off drugs that, that want to be off drugs.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  Uh, in thinking that, that it's, we're not doing a good job of fighting the
war, you know, in, in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs,
maybe legalizing them and, and trying to help those that, you know, having the
resources there to help someone, uh, would be a better idea, but, and I agreed
with him somewhat.  I could see his point.  But, uh, Switzerland opened up a,
uh, uh, a park --

B.14:  The park?  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- and, and for years it just kept getting worse, more and more people kept
coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until
finally the Swiss have decided to close it down.

B.16:  Yeah, I just saw that in the news here recently.  

A.17:  So, uh, I don't know, I mean, it sounds like, it sounds like there aren't
going to, that there isn't a perfect solution.

B.18:  Yeah, it really is a dirty mess.  Very difficult to come to conclusions.  I
guess one, uh, one other data point is the old, uh, prohibition here in the U
S, the consequences of that and it's ultimate, uh, repealment.

A.19:  Good point, it's a good point and, although, although alcohol consumption
did jump right after prohibition, it did come back down.

B.20:  Yeah, and it's funny how today in movies and all, we really glorify those
gangsters and that lifestyle.  It's kind of spooky.

A.21:   Yes, you do.  

B.22:   I g-, -- 

A.23:   We do.  

B.24:   -- I guess even today, in today's movies a lot,
