========================================================================

A.1:  So do you keep a family budget?  

@B.2:  [Lipsmack] Well not a real strict one but we do work hard at saving for
the future, and do that primarily through, uh, payroll reduction at my
employment.

A.3:  That's a good way to do it.  What, what we usually do, my wife and I,
fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and I, I don't.

B.4:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.5:  #Um,# so what, what happens is, uh, I make the money and she spends it but,

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  she spends it carefully.  And then at the end of the month, she just
tallies it up and, uh, we have basically categories, spend this much in this
area, this much in that area and, uh, all I don't, keep that in mind as we
spend, we do, um, kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did and,
uh --

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  -- you know, at the beginning of the month too we also take out some, some
savings and put them aside so we, we know we don't have that to spend.  That
appears to work pretty well.

B.10:  I actually use a computer to keep track of our family, uh, expenses.  I
enter all the [lipsmack] all the checks that we write and most of the cash
that we spend and all the credit card transactions into a computer program
that, and keeps track of where all of our expenses go.  And every few months I
look at that to get an overall idea of, of, uh, of how our expenses compare to
my income and make sure that we're not getting a beyond, uh, what we should be
spending in any particular area and try and figure out for the, for the year
whether [breathing] we're going to be able to, to cover the unusual expenses
such as property taxes and --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- others things that come up from time to time.  

A.13:  [Breathing] Do you have a, uh, specialized program or do you, or do you
just use something like a spreadsheet?

B.14:  Uh, it's a specialized personal finance program.  

A.15:  [Lipsmack]  #I'm,# 

B.16:  #And# it seems to, seems to work real well.

A.17:  We've got, uh, a couple of those but, uh, I've been trying to ge-, get my
wife sold on a spreadsheet.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  And have her, uh, doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by
hand.

B.20:  #Huh.# 

A.21:  #Um,# she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just
adding them up and then subtracting from the, the target totals, she says it's
just as quick to do that way as to, [breathing] to, uh, enter it on the
computer and have it check the arithmetic.

B.22:  #Yeah that,# 

A.23:  #So,# 

B.24:  I think, I think generally people do find that, that probably is just as
quick to keep by hand.  The only question is whether, whether the additional
reports and the, uh, you know, the, the nice record keeping that it gives you
is worth a little bit of extra time.

A.25:  [Gasp] Well, that's kind of the way I feel and, uh, I use spreadsheets a
lot, and a lot more than she does so I feel like she's, you know, if, if she
did do it for a couple months, she'd probably like it #but,# 

B.26:  #Right.#

A.27:  she was just that [lipsmack],

B.28:  Right.  Do you have any, uh, any particular ways that that feeds into your
long-term, uh, savings or retirement plan?

A.29:  Um, our, as far as our family budget goes?

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  Yeah.  What we do is [breathing] we kind of know what, what we're making
and we've been doing, keeping track long enough that we know what we need to
spend and [breathing] pretty much all the difference goes, uh, well, it goes
into two or three different places.  What have what we call an education
account,

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  #where we# put aside some money for each of our children every month.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  [Laughter] With the desperate fear that by the time they are old,

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  enough to use it, it's not going to be enough anyway.

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  And, uh, then we have kind of just a savings account and, and right now all
we've been doing is taking that and, and putting it away in a money market
account.

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #We haven't# been investing or anything like that, uh, yet.  We just moved
last year into a home, just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of
substantial other commitments to take care of,

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  right now but --

B.44:  Makes it difficult, yeah.

A.45:  -- we, uh, you know, we, even with all that, we're still able to put some
aside.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  How about you?

B.48:  Well, I contribute as much as I can to our four O one K plan at work and we
also have a, a, uh, company stock purchase plan which I contribute to.  And
between those two that's, that's pretty much all that we're able to save, but
fortunately, those are fairly substantial and I feel like that's, at this
point, the, uh, the, the most important part of our long-term, uh, savings
plans.  And then hoping the, hoping if I get a few raises that I'll [laughter]
be able to get beyond that, but right now that's all I'm able to save.

A.49:  Well, it's, it's nice to have something.  You know people say that if
you're, if you're not saving money, you're spending more than you earn.  And,
uh,

B.50:  #Uh-huh.#

A.51:  #that's# probably the case.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  You know, you never can live down to the last dime.  So you're either
coming out ahead or coming out behind.

B.54:  Right.  I know we're just getting started on our family so,
