=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, what kind of requirements do you think you'll [breathing] you'll want
for your next car?

B.2:  Well, [breathing], uh, the, the one we bought most recently and, and I
think that's a good guard because, uh, we, uh, we had r-, our requirements
change.  We, we now have two kids and so we need a little bit more room.  Uh,
the, the one that we bought in, in eighty-eight, uh, was a response to the,
the first child being born and, and for that we wanted something really
dependable, something with an excellent repair record, uh, something that we
were not going have it in the shop a lot --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- and of all the things that, of all the ones that we looked at, uh, we
looked in CONSUMER REPORTS and, and asked around friends and, and looked at
our own experiences, we went with a, a Toyota.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Uh, we got a Toyota Corolla, one of the, the wagon kind.   

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  So it's not as big as the, the nineteen fifties, uh, suburban tank --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- but it's, it's spacious enough for, for now, now we have two kids.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Uh, we've got to put two, you know, (( )), you got to have enough room for
two car seats and that sort of thing.  Uh, and the repair record has been
really terrific.  Uh, it's been very, very nice, so I think that [breathing],
uh, based on our own experience and how satisfied and, and we know what sort
of driving, uh, requirements we have, we, we probably would go with that
again.  It, the repair record is, is for us, repair record and the g-, and the
gas mileage is what drives it for us, uh, not whether it has a moon roof, or,
uh, how many C D players you can stack in it, but --

A.13:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah.  

B.14:  -- but the, the repair record is, is the thing for us.  

A.15:  Well, I, I have a Nissan, that's what I bought and I, I guess I originally
bought it because of, first of all, because of the price because when I bought
it I want-, you know, I wanted something mo-, you know, m-, enough, as much
bang for the buck,

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  And I bought the car, and I bought the car used, and I had almost sixty,
there's almost sixty thousand miles on it, and I have almost a hundred and ten
thousand right now.

B.18:  Wow.  

A.19:  And since I've had the car I've bought a new battery, I've, I had a
[throat_clearing] a fan belt pulley go out and the universals in the drive
shaft.

B.20:  Um.   

A.21:  But, other than that, I haven't had any problems with it.  I, when I bought
it, I went down to Sears and had them put four Sears Road Handlers on it, 

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  and they've been on there for, I guess almost forty-seven thousand miles --

B.24:  That's good, yeah.  

A.25:  -- and they look, visually they look brand new and, it was, I guess two
months ago, well, I, I changed my, the main thing is, is the maintenance, as
you say, and I do that, I keep the oil changed with the high R P M motor flu-,
you know --

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- and I get, took it to get it tuned up and when I first got it I took it,
I wanted the valves adjusted and I, the guy went in and I had to pay for it.
The guy says you don't need them adjusted, they're fine.  And so I waited
another forty thousand miles and they just adjusted them, but they really
weren't [laughter] out of adjustment.  He, they looked at it and he goes, it
looks like a brand new motor.  It's because I keep the oil changed and I says,
well, I, I wanted brakes changed, and he said, they looked at them and he
says, in the back, you have three fourths of your pads and in the front,
they're three fourths, you don't need them, and I so I've been driving all
these miles and I didn't need them but I, I changed the front, I had the
brakes done in the front anyway just because I wanted the front wheels, you
know, packed, the, the bearings packed and things and it worked out, so I
mean, I, I'm just amazed at the performance and I, the Japanese cars, it just
seems that as far as the, well, I just going to interject quick as a, my next
purchase I want something with a little more safety features, I want the air
bags and the antilock brakes.

B.28:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  

A.29:  That, that's something that I want.  But, uh, I was going to inter-, say,
is that, [lipsmack] when General Motors they sell their cars and there's too
much of a, I, I believe there's just too much of a profit margin and you,
they're, you're not getting the car.  You're, you're, you're paying for, you
might say, markup, where the Japanese cars you, you're paying but, you, you,
you're getting that performance and so, that's, I said, I'm, I'm very, very
satisfied with my car.  In fact, I, it's a, you know, it's a little, little
s-, Nissan pickup truck, it's five speed, I just don't, it's, I'm, I'm not
really that tall and it, you know, it fits me comfortable, I have good
visibility, I mean, it just, it just a blast, it handles like a little sports
car, just really satisfied with it.

B.30:  I, I know, it [breathing], it, it almost seems a shame that, [inhaling] uh,
the [breathing], the approach perhaps that, that, uh, Detroit takes is that,
if we're going to make an economy car, by God, you're going to know it's an
economy car.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Whereas, I get the feeli-,
