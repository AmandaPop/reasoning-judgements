REMARKS:        Had a hard time understanding A.  He sometimes mumbled and
sometimes talked to fast.

============================================================================

B.1:  So, uh, does your company do any sort of drug testing?

@A.2:  [Clicking] Yeah, they do do random drug testing.  I, I work in the defense
industry.

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  And so they're, they're, they're pretty concerned about something like
that.  Although, in my mind, I don't, I don't like the idea of having a,
having like a hit squad come in --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- and suddenly like, you know, put my employment on the line over, uh, my
lifestyle choices consi-, --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- I'm, I don't think, considering I don't think it affects my job and,
like, nobody, uh, nobody's life is at, at risk, I don't think they should
really care what --

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  -- I do in my spare time.

B.11:  So what are they worried about?  Are they worried about, I mean, do y-, is
this #a secure environment you're in?#

A.12:  #[Laughter]# I think, I'm not, I'm not really sure.  I think that they're
worried that you might, uh, i-, if, if you're a drug addict you could probably
compromise government secrets or something like that.

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  But I, I think it's a pretty conservative approach to, you know, uh, uh,
things, I think it's like a fifties approach to a, to a, an, an eighties or
nineties lifestyle #[laughter].#

B.15:  #[Laughter].#

A.16:  You know, I don't know [laughter].  I think drugs are pretty pervasive in
our society.  An-, 

B.17:  Uh, yeah.  And not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care
about.

A.18:  And, yeah.  Well, also, I, what I think is a, a problem is that there's a,
there's a lot of things out there that will actually ma-, let you test
positive for drugs --

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  -- when you're, you're not even, #like# --

B.21:  #Uh-huh.#

A.22:  -- not even on drugs.

B.23:  Right.  And you'll be penalized, I mean you could lose your job very
#easily.#

A.24:  #Right.# I, did you see that thing on, uh, SIXTY MINUTES about the, uh, the
Air Force pilot who, uh, they, there was a mistake at the lab --

B.25:  No.

A.26:  -- and, oh it was on, in SIXTY MINUTES.  There was a mistake at the lab and
he, he tested, he was a B Fifty-Two bomber pilot.

B.27:  Okay [laughter]. 

A.28:  And he, and he tested positive.  And he, it ruined his career.  #He# --

B.29:  #Right.#

A.30:  -- he, uh, he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent, I think
something like seven years working, you know, before he was able to work his
way back through the, the courts to be, uh, you know, I guess it's called
exonerated.

B.31:  I guess so.  Right.

A.32:  But by then, his career is, was ruined #because,#

B.33:  #Oh yes.  His# life is over at that #point.# 

A.34:  #Yeah.#  He's, he, he was seven years and then it was just like it, it was
a, an accident and,

B.35:  Yeah.  I've read things that talk about,

A.36:  [Noise].

B.37:  the number of false negatives --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- to the number of false positives.  And, you know, the number of people
you're going to hurt while accomplishing, you know, whatever you think you're
accomplishing is really quite high.

A.40:  Yeah.  Oh, you know, but I, but I also, uh, you know, you read things
about, uh, like train car conductors.

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  Uh, [laughter] which, #you think of the,# 

B.43:  #You mean like the# ticket takers?

A.44:  Well, no, I'm talking about like the guy, no #I'm, I'm talking about# --

B.45:  #The engineer?#

A.46:  -- the engineers.

B.47:  [Laughter].

A.48:  Now that, that is pretty scary though, yeah.

B.49:  It is.  The only thing is, I, my, what I think is they, they're testing
for, you know, especially illegal drugs, is part of the real problem.  The
real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball.

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  And I think that what they should be doing is performance testing.  Not
drug testing.  You know, they should have some sort of video game or 
something --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- that the guy has to play or, you know, something like that.  Because if
he, you know, maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  And, uh, just stayed up too late.  And for that reason, is not on the ball.
Or he's, you know, h-, he's unhappy about something or he's sick.

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  Or, uh, 

A.58:  [Sigh].

B.59:  you know, uh, using some legal drug that they don't test for.  I mean, I
really don't want to be, I don't want to die in a train wreck.

A.60:  Right.

B.61:  And, and it's because I don't want to die that I want them to do a more
meaningful test.

A.62:  Yeah.  But then, again, uh, you know, I also, if I was a conductor, I, I, I
wouldn't want, I wouldn't want to have to like, you know, piss in a little
paper cup whenever [laughter] (( )), you know.

B.63:  [Inhaling] Well, I can see there'd be, yeah, I mean, I, actually,

A.64:  [Cough].

B.65: there's some mixed {mispronounced}, mixed feelings about that.  I
mean, I feel like, okay if you're going to do testing, do a meaningful
test like a performance test.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  Uh, the testing itself, uh, I could see where the testing if it's not, if
it is a performance test, I mean, it's directly related doing your job.

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  Uh, it has nothing to do with your personal, you know, lifestyle.  Uh,

A.70:  Yeah.  By then, I had, just had a thought about like what about a, what
about a police officer, #you know.#

B.71:  #Uh-huh.#

A.72:  I mean, that, then you begin to, to wonder if, I understand they have like
random. Law enforcement officers have to go through, through random, random
tests just to see what side of the law they are, they're on, #[laughter] you
know.#

B.73:  #[Laughter].#

A.74:  And [laughter] and I'm beginning, I'm, I'm starting to think a little more,
a little more about this, is that, I guess. should we really be talking about
e-, e-, what, should we be, should we have legalized drugs, you know.

B.75:  Well, a lot of people say that that would,

A.76:  [Throat_clearing].

B.77:  simplify a lot of things.  Uh, I tend to, I tend to agree just because the
attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops.

A.78:  Yeah.  I, I think that,
