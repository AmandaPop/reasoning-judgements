============================================================

A.1:  So, do you have kids in the public school system?

B.2:  Uh, no I don't.  I'm a college student actually.

A.3:  Oh yeah.

B.4:  No kids yet.

A.5:  [Laughter] Well, I've got preschoolers, so.  We have one that is going to
be starting kindergarten next year --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- uh, and I don't know if I am real comfortable with the public schools at
this point #but, uh# --

B.8:  #Right.#

A.9:  -- home schooling right now is not an option for us.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And pr-, private schools, uh --

B.12:  Pretty expensive.

A.13:  -- yeah.  [laughter] So you have to deal with it, what you have but, uh --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- uh, I don't know.  I am, what do you think about the school system?

B.16:  Uh, I think that there's a lot that could be done to, improve them.  I, uh,
being I am in college and stuff, you get to college and you see, you know, it
just seems, it seems like that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that
that are done in college I guess should be taught a lot earlier in school.
Like in math and science and stuff #like that.#

A.17:  #Yeah.#

B.18:  I mean I, uh, am a math major and when I was in high school, you know, I, I
think I could have handled a lot of the work that I've been doing here in
college at a much younger age.  I believe that that's the way that it use to
be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other
countries too, because your, your math professors or what whatever will
always go.  Yeah, I was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like
well, [laughter] you know, then why the heck is it you know my third year in
college and I am just now getting to it.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  It just seems like that they, the curriculum in the public schools is just
too soft or something.

A.21:  Yeah.  They, I feel like they are trying to teach a lot of, uh, they're
taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of, uh, of values and
doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be
teaching --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- and uh, yeah.  There's a lot of things that, uh, I want to teach my kids
and I don't want them to mess around with --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- uh, you know, I don't feel like that's their, that's their place.  Uh,
one of the things that, uh, my husband works for, uh, for a company that, uh,
well he works for Frito Lay, but they had a guy come in, uh, talking about
some of the new I B M, uh, systems that they have coming out and talking about
how school systems are just, are not transitioning as as rapidly as, uh, as a
lot, well, industry right now is just going to have to, uh, you know, well in a
transition period with the computers and stuff --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and, uh, that was real encouraging as I, we went and looked at the
kindergarten class that my little boy will go into and they have reading to
write which is, uh, they can write stories --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- uh, and [noise] learn to write on computers, so at least, uh, the school
district that we're in has, you know, computers that they begin on --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- and I really feel like, uh, they're going to have to use those a lot
and, and that way a child that, my son already know, already knows how to read
and he will be able to excel at his own pace --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- where the kids that, you know, that don't have, uh, that haven't had
the, he had a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged
throughout his school --

B.34:  Right {very faint}.

A.35:  -- life if he's of, you know, that things are available to him like the
computer that he can go off and #teach himself.#

B.36:  #Work at his# own pace.

A.37:  Yeah.  Because I know there's a lot of, a lot of junk that I learned in
school and it's been, it's been a number of years since I've been in high
school and college and, uh, they, uh, you know some of the stuff I learned it
was such a waste of time --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- and, uh, [laughter] I go back, and I got a degree in, uh, I got a
business degree in college and that's the most useless degree [laughter] --

B.40:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- in the world.  It's like why did I do this --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- (( )) and, uh, so you have to, you know you have to, uh, you really have
to work with, uh, what's out there in the environment and use it to your
advantage in the schools, right now, uh, they're just beginning I think to, to
take advantage of the computers and of course not all schools are able to do
that because of the expense of them --

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  -- but, uh,

B.46:  Well, I agree very highly with your point about the, the, uh, public
schools have gotten away from the real sort of hard core curriculum and into
areas that are more, should be dealt with at home or in the Church or
somewhere else --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you, how you interact
with the rest of society because I feel that those are really things that have
no place in the school.  I mean, I, I see that they're try to, uh, uh, I don't
know what they are trying to do, but I really think that the emphasis should
be more on, on book learning and not on okay, here's our civics class.  This
is, we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their
community and how it's suppose to be and as opposed to just having straight up
math, reading, writing,
