A.1:  Hi, Ed.

B.2:  Hello Carolyn.

A.3:  Do you, uh, work for a large organization?

B.4:  Yes, I work for North Carolina State University which has about [inhaling]
six or seven thousand employees.

A.5:  Wow.  What do you do?  #Are you,# 

B.6:  #I'm# an associate professor --

A.7:  I see.

B.8:  -- in electrical and computer engineering and computer science.  And you
work for T I?

A.9:  Yes.

B.10:  And you do,

A.11:  I'm a computer scientist --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and always concerned about benefits [laughter].

B.14:  Right.  Well, I, I'm on the benefits committee here --

A.15:  Oh, you are?

B.16:  -- one of about twenty people in the university so, that's why I checked
that topic.

A.17:  I see.  Uh, what do you think people's concern is about benefits?  Is it
mostly in the area of health care?

@B.18:  That's what I was going to say.  We seem to get more, more, uh, complaints
about that than about anything else.  Although you get a good deal of
complaints over other kinds of insurance too.  Uh, [smack] yeah, health care,
we have, we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that
it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the
university and I wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case.  Uh, [smack]
yeah they, people are, uh, complaining because the rates for families, uh, wh-,
you know, the, the, uh, [smack] uh, the additional amount you have to pay to
cover a family has gone up quite rapidly.

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we've, our benefits have changed recently to where
we have network doctors and network hospitals.  Kind of, uh, a preferred
provider --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and the [laughter] you wouldn't believe the complaints [inhaling].

B.22:  Huh.

A.23:  Because, you know, you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network
--

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- and, uh, so there, uh, you, your benefits are reduced #if you don't go#
--

B.26:  #Well# --

A.27:  -- to a network doctor.

B.28:  -- do you, yeah, but I mean do people get to choose whether to take the,
the preferred, preferred provider or not?

A.29:  That's right.  That's right. 

B.30:  Huh.

A.31:  You get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors.

B.32:  Right.  But, so, so people would stay in an existing plan that, that didn't
require you to go to a preferred provider #in that case, right?#

A.33:  #No.# No.  The plan allows you to do either one.  The benefits that are
paid are considerably better when, uh --

B.34:  With the preferred #provider.  Huh.#

A.35:  -- #with the preferred# provider.  Yes.

B.36:  Wonder about the economics of that.  Uh, the, uh, you know, twenty years
ago when H M O s just got started, uh, when they started enrolling a lot of
people uh, it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs
and it worked to some degree, but it didn't work that much and the reason was
adverse selection.  The people that go into H M O s are are those that have
uh, you know, that that have generally lesser health needs and I mean it's
obvious why that is because the people that that are already sick are going to
see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the H M
O.  So you get the people in the H M O, they they don't, you know, require
that much, uh, care at all and then some how you got less people paying
premiums into the into the, uh, insurance system than you have, uh, uh, you
have almost as many claims so, uh, that's, that's caused a problem.  Uh,

A.37:  Have you heard about, uh, ca-, the cafeteria plan of benefits?

B.38:  Yes.  Uh, I don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  Industry tends to have a lot better programs.

A.41:  Well, I don't know.  I, I would, I'd be interested in se-, in learning more
about that because --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- uh, I have no children --

B.44:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.45:  -- so I am not interested really in child care benefits --

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  -- except I suppose as a citizen of the world or something [laughter].

B.48:  Well, I, I don't know.  I mean the questions is should should it be the
employer that pays for child care.  Uh, if, if there were a tax credit then
everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also
be better in the sense that people who had only one income in the family would
get as much as people who had two [inhaling] and you would sort of think that
the people who have one income kind of need it more.

A.49:  Yeah.  Yeah {very faint}.

B.50:  So {very faint},

A.51:  I just, I, I like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are
more important to me.

B.52:  Oh yes.  No, that, that, it's true.  That's important.  I agree.  Uh, yeah
that's true and child care is one of the big ones that, that gets thrown in.
Uh [smack],

A.53:  Well, you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so
much [laughter].

B.54:  Medical care?

A.55:  Medical insurance or something, I don't know [laughter].

B.56:  I don't know about that [laughter].

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  You'd have, you'd have your office visits covered, but that's only a small
part of the #total.#

A.59:  #Yeah.#  I'm sure.  But --

B.60:  Yeah. 

A.61:  -- uh, on the other hand, you know, maybe, maybe if you had false teeth you
wouldn't care about dental insurance [laughter].

B.62:  Uh, well I think you probably would need more denture work, wouldn't you?
[inhaling].

A.63:  [Laughter]  Would you?  I don't know.

B.64:  I don't care too much about dental work because of, of their dental, the
dental insurance, because I rarely, well almost never for the last eight years
have I used up enough to, uh, you know, spend nothing in dental bills to, uh,
come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly [inhaling].

A.65:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.66:  Uh, but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need, uh,
you know, an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation.

A.67:  That's right.  But that, you know, people like,
