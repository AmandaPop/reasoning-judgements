=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to
put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget.  The only
thing I do now is, uh, put the data into Quicken.  I don't know if you are
familiar with that.

B.2:  Yeah, I have some friends of mine who use Quicken and, uh, I've considered
using it once myself, but I decided that the amount of information that would
have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  So I, I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now.

A.5:  Um.  I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced
actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then,
well, uh, uh, not bother to total it --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.  So it really helps
with that.

B.8:  Yeah, well, it's similar problems but, uh, we just have the one check book
and we [inhaling] try to keep it up to date as much as possible and
occasionally we will get behind like you say but, uh, [inhaling] it doesn't
really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up
to date and balanced.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on
finances?

A.11:  Well, actually we haven't had to.  Uh, until just recently.  I guess we've
got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way so --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- we needed to start doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for
college and things like that.  We tried a way, try to put away two and four
thousand a year just for that.

B.14:  Yeah.  Well that's pretty good if you can do that.  I know.  I have a
daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to
this point but, uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is
enough that we can consider putting some away --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- for college, so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction
--

A.17:  Um.

B.18:  -- in the fall and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll
be putting away for the college fund.

A.19:  Um.  Sounds good.  Yeah, I guess we're, we're just at the point, uh, my
wife worked until we had a family and then, you know, now we're just going on
the one income so it's --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- a lot more interesting trying to, uh, find some extra payroll deductions
is probably the only way we will be able to, uh, do it.  You know, kind of
enforce the savings.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  But, uh, it will be interesting to see (( )).

B.24:  Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause
my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just
recently, uh, took on a full time job, well almost full time.

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start
putting away large sums of it for, uh, long range goals like college and
sickness and --

A.27:  Um.

B.28:  -- travel and that kind of thing.

A.29:  That sounds good.  But, uh, uh, I was just curious, what, uh, part of the
country.

B.30:  Oh, Stockton.

A.31:  Oh, okay.  

B.32:  How about you?

A.33:  Uh, Cincinnati, actually.  I was kind of wondering if they would be
collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that.  I
don't know how many people are, uh, getting involved in this but --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- uh, well that's interesting.  I'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, I was kind of
interested if you found out about the study by, uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST or
was there another?

B.36:  Uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the
computer network called INTERNET.

A.37:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that is how I got it as well but, uh,

B.38:  And he just forwarded that on to me and, uh, it sounded like it would be an
interesting project --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- to participate in so I --

A.41:  Yeah, it will be interesting to see what,

B.42:  -- sent back (( )) mail. 

A.43:  It would be interesting to see how the data base, (( )) so, well, I guess
we're talking about the experiment.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic but, uh, it's hard to
talk about finances without without getting to, uh, dollar figures I guess --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- you know, we could talk about some of the long range goals and,

B.48:  Well what other long range goals do you have besides college?

A.49:  Uh, well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees
at some point --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- uh, I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for
employers that happen to fund that.  It seems like every year my employer just
gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent and now it's, uh, now it's
reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and, uh, it's a real
shame from what we had before, uh, because we're,
