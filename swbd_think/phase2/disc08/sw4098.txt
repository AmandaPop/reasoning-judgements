===========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  I guess I started it.

B.2:  Oh, okay.  So, uh, where are you from just in general?

A.3:  Oh, uh --

B.4:  State.

A.5:  -- New York.

B.6:  New York.  Okay, I am in New Jersey.

A.7:  Uh-huh, oh, well that's good.  Yeah.

B.8:  Okay.

A.9:  So.

B.10:  So, uh, I guess we're talking about taxes.  Uh, so what do you,

@A.11:  I know I pay too much.

B.12:  You pay too much.

A.13:  Yeah, I know I pay too much.  The reason I know this for fact is because,
uh, the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically
from year to year so on the good years I pay just propor-, I mean if it's
wealthy I pay a high percentage and on the bad years I am not and I pay
average --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- so I either pay average or above average.  I don't pay below average.

B.16:  Oh, are you like a small business or something or,

A.17:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a consultant.

B.18:  Oh, okay.

A.19:  And so due to the nature of the business it, uh, you know my base line is
average and I don't get that back on the other half.  #Back,# 

B.20:  #Is it feel like,# uh, income averaging or something like that?

A.21:  There was.  That went away a few years ago.  And, uh,

B.22:  Oh, okay [laughter].

A.23:  Well, whatever you call it.  I suspect that was one of those loop holes for
the wealthy they closed.

B.24:  Oh.

A.25:  But, uh, [laughter] I don't know for sure.  Uh,

B.26:  Uh, so, why do you think you don't get anything, enough for your value?  I
mean, 

A.27:  Well, I didn't say value, uh, I am just saying that proportionally I pay
this portion in a large amount.

B.28:  Oh. Are you a single?

A.29:  Uh, no, not at the moment.  Not at present.

B.30:  Uh --

A.31:  Uh.

B.32:  -- I know singles pay more than --

A.33:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.34:  -- married people.

A.35:  Well that's,

B.36:  I am single.  I know that and I pay quite a bit higher than a married
person.  Where if you don't happen to buy a house or something like that --

A.37:  Yeah.  If you are unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if you life
style --

B.38:  -- and you don't, uh --

A.39:  -- make it desirable.  Yeah.

B.40:  -- that's, that's the only, uh, tax, uh, write off you can get these days.

A.41:  Yeah, yeah.  Well unless you are up in the mega bucks range.

B.42:  Well yeah, buy a yacht or some [laughter],

A.43:  [Laughter]  But, uh,  

B.44:  But I guess they took away that and they're yelling and screaming about
that.

A.45:  Yeah.  As far as whether you get value back for your dollar, I think the
answer to that one, if you wonder through State of, through, uh, Washington, D
C all the the big fancy buildings there.  They got paid by something.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.47:  Yeah so, uh, what's going in, there's got to be a lot more in going out if
they can pay for all that stuff.

B.48:  Well, it depends if it's, you know, a regressive tax or a, uh, progressive
tax.

A.49:  Well, I'm not really talking about, uh, who is putting it in.  I am just
saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is
left over for all these things #in the middle.#

B.50:  #Well, no.  Yeah.#

A.51:  That's what I meant.

B.52:  Borrowed time actually, could be.

A.53:  What's that?

B.54:  Could be borrowed time.  It's like,

A.55:  Well, I don't know.  It's just, uh, you know, ((pass a law, print up
another billion)).

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  And, uh, business as usual.

B.58:  Uh, I know here in New Jersey, we have taxes for, uh, just the necessities
and I think it's, uh, regressive tax which is worse.

A.59:  How much percentage, regressive versus, what does that mean?

B.60:  Uh, progressive?

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Uh, it's like, uh, you know, a graduated tax which means you pay more money
as you earn more money --

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  -- so you have a greater ability to pay.  You don't really need that extra
income to survive --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- you know and so the idea behind that is to, to, uh, that's why we have
higher tax rates for people who have higher income, right.  #At least suppose,#

A.67:  #Well, that's the theory, uh,# 

B.68:  You know, that's what progressive tax.  Regressive tax is you can have a
flat percentage tax, uh --

A.69:  Um.

B.70:  -- across the board --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- and, uh, and even tax people for things that they need to live.  So, if
you tax, you can tax, uh, you know, medicine or food and, uh,

A.73:  Yeah.  Well they, they play that game here in New York but, uh, it's it
winds up working in very strange ways.  You can go to the grocery store and
there is a sales tax now, which is supposedly is only for necessities, I am
sorry, not for necessities, only for non essentials, and if you buy your
orange juice in a paper container, it's not taxed, but if you buy it in a can,
uh, re-, uh, concentrated then it is taxed.

B.74:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.75:  So, uh, I don't claim to understand that [laughter].

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  You know that's, uh, and, uh, then we get into the idea of trying to modify
behavior by taxing, you know.  Cranking the tax for cigarettes --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- and hope people #will stop.#

B.80:  #Yeah, sin taxes.#

A.81:  Yeah, but we,

B.82:  You don't need cigarettes or, uh, #alcohol# --

A.83:  #Liquor.#

B.84:  -- to live.

A.85:  Let's see now, all you got, all you've got to do is take one look at the
cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop
people [laughter].

B.86:  Well, to, to a degree, if, uh, you know, if you're addicted it's not going
to matter --

A.87:  Huh.

B.88:  -- but, uh, certainly if the tax, I mean here are, yo-, in New Jersey you
have to pay, you pay thirteen percent tax, sort of value added tax on your
utilities.

A.89:  Huh.

B.90:  So the things you need to heat your home --

A.91:  Right.

B.92:  -- the things you drink your water, you tax water.

A.93:  Really.

B.94:  It's crazy.  Uh, you know, you, you see what you have to go somewhere so
you get taxed for that.

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  Every utility is thir-, thirteen percent.

A.97:  You know, I, uh, we get a tax here that, uh,
