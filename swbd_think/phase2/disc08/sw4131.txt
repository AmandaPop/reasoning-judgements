============================================================================

A.1:  Personally prefer sports cars and responsive cars.  I like to, uh, to drive
kind of fast, I guess, but I'm finding that as I get older, I'm thinking that
it would also be nice to have kind of a, a nicer, bigger maybe more lux-,
luxurious car to have in addition to the one I already have.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  What kind of car do you have right now?  

A.3:  It's a, uh, Dodge Daytona.  

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  It's a Shelby Z, they only made them for, for one year.  It's really just a
variation on the other Daytonas that they have out, but I'm real happy with
it.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  It's, uh, an eighty-seven and it's the first turbo charge car I ever owned
and I was a little reluctant about that because I heard things about, uh,
other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite
often, be very expensive to fix, but I haven't had any problems with it.

B.8:  Yeah.  I know my father in law has, have a, has a turbo charged, uh, engine
on his truck and he's had some, some problems with that.

A.9:  Oh, really?  

B.10:  But, uh, he put the turbo on himself and, uh -- 

A.11:  Huh.  

B.12:  -- there was some problems right from the start with that.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  How old is, uh, how old is the truck?  

B.14:  Well, I think it's probably about an eighty-seven also.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  [Throat_clearing] Excuse me, but I guess my tastes in vehicles are just a
little bit different, uh, uh, I've been more into just kind of a family car,
small, uh, not real big car, uh, but lately we've been, uh, [breathing] trying
to get something that's a little bit more reliable --

A.17:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.18:  -- so we've been going with, uh, Toyota vehicles lately.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  And I'm more into pick up trucks lately.  I, I got mys-, self a pick up
truck last spring --

A.21:  Oh. 

B.22:  -- and I'm more interested in the, the off road, that kind of thing,
hauling things around.

A.23:  Oh, sure.  

B.24:  Uh,   

A.25:  Yeah, we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep
Wrangler --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- and, uh, it's funny, though, because it's, this is actually my wife's
car, the Jeep and, uh, but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a
rugged suspension like that to go out and do things.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  But we're still finding that when we,

B.30:  [Throat_clearing].

A.31:  end up driving other people places that it would be nice to have something
where, something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or s-,
scrunch their knees up, and something that would ride a little more smoothly,
especially when, when you travel --

B.32:  Right [throat_clearing].  

A.33:  -- which we do a, a fair bit of traveling.  

B.34:  Yeah, I know we do a lot of that on the road traveling and we, we have a
Toyota Camry for that kind of traveling.

A.35:  Oh, yeah.  

B.36:  That's a little bit more comfortable.  It's, it's not real fancy, but it's
a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles we've had prior to
that.

A.37:  Yeah, sure.  It's, uh, I don't know, what you're, when you're used to one
thing, I guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have
or nice to have --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- but,

B.40:  Are you pretty satisfied with your Jeep as far as repair and reliability on
it?

A.41:  Yeah, we haven't had it for very long.  We got it in September right
around, uh, Labor Day, I guess it was, and so it doesn't have a whole lot of
miles on it yet --

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- but, uh, up here in Rochester, New York it's nice to have a four wheel
drive capability especially on days like today [laughter] where we have about
--

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- six inches of snow coming down out there.  

B.46:  Yeah, we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so,

A.47:  Yeah, I was a little, uh, surprised to find, I, I'm not the sort of person
that's going to go out and shop for, exclusively for an American built car,
but I am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the
best is [laughter] American --

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- made and American built, but I was reading in the paper the other day
that, uh, surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American aren't
always and, in fact, they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively
made in either Mexico or Canada.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Which isn't that far away, but, I, it surprised me.  I always thought Jeep
was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least.

B.52:  Well, it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had
because --

A.53:  Really?  

B.54:  -- the Toyota we have now was built in, I think, Tennessee and the, uh,
before that we had a, a Volkswagen Jetta which was made in Philadelphia --

A.55:  Yeah.   

B.56:  -- or somewhere in Pennsylvania, I think, so, but you wouldn't think that
just off the top of your head, you think they're German or --

A.57:  No, yeah.  

B.58:  -- or Japanese made.  

A.59:  Yeah, I guess you never know.  In fact, they had a whole system, uh,
decoding the vehicle identification number so [laughter] you could figure out
even right down to where the factory was, which state the factory was in --

B.60:  Yeah -- 

A.61:  -- where it was built.  

B.62:  -- I read that in the paper the other day.  

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  Found that interesting.  

A.65:  It was interesting.  

B.66:  We used to have a Jeep a long time ago when we were first married and I, I
swore I'd never get one again --

A.67:  Oh, really?  

B.68:  -- because we had so much problems with it.  It was just -- 

A.69:  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.70:  -- a, a never ending, uh, stay at the, the repair shop [laughter] just,

A.71:  Oh, really?  What sorts of problems did you have with it?  

B.72:  Well [breathing], the carburetion never really worked quite right and
there,
