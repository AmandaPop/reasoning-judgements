==========================================================================

A.1:  [Laughter]  Okay. 

B.2:  (( )) I'll talk about my city a little bit.  [noise] I, I've noticed that
there is actually being quite, there's been quite a bit done.  Uh, I noticed
that, uh, the (( )) of my, uh, grocery stores --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- have been putting up signs, plastic --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- bags and, uh, trying to recycle the, uh, gallon containers.  So, I am
beginning to see some, uh, real positive effects.  I mean, although I won't
claim that thi-, that we are doing everything --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and, it's, uh, I, I try to recycle, uh, papers and cans.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  What about glass?  Do they have glass? [noise].

B.10:  Uh, I have not seen a whole lot of glass, [noise] but at the same time in
this area. [noise] At least when it comes to like Coke and Pepsi, uh, they
don't really hardly use any glass.

A.11:  Huh.  So they know, uh, here they have, uh, they have trash sorting.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, I mean, uh, not not right here where I am, but in the, in the town next
door.  They have, uh, they have trash sorting and you know, they put out
aluminum and glass, and newspaper in separate bins --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- and uh, huh, [laughter] I guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless
people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like they, they pay
for this by the, by the aluminum they collect [laughter].

B.16:  Right.  Right.  Well I, I know that, uh, uh, that's that, one thing that
they're not real good about yet is it seems like the paper sorting.  We still
are forced pretty much to take everything in.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  You know, we don't really have any help from the sanitation department.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  So, th-, life is not easy in that way.  We still have to kind of take care
of our own aluminum, uh, so it's still up to the individual.  It's not really
part of any, uh, government sponsored programs or anything.

A.21:  I see.  So, [inhaling] so, uh, do you actually live in in Atlanta?

B.22:  Uh, yes.  Uh, pretty much.  I, I really don't live in the same county as
what you call Atlanta central which is several counties --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- that count as Atlanta.

A.25:  Yeah, I know.  The cities are, uh, I think Decalb {mispronounced}.

B.26:  Well, that's Decalb, actually.

A.27:  Decalb.  Yeah, #Decalb.#

B.28:  #You're right, it's# spelled that -- 

A.29:  and Fulton.

B.30:  -- way. D, D E C A L B.  #But, that's that's Decalb.#

A.31:  #I thought,#

B.32:  [Laughter] [noise].

A.33:  I thought, I thought it was a K.  I always thought it was a K.  Well, never
mind. {sounds like} Uh, and uh, isn't Fulton the other county that's, uh,

B.34:  Right.  Fulton. 

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that, uh,
to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much, uh, still in the
Atlanta proper.

A.37:  Huh.

B.38:  Uh, but there is no concentrated concept, uh, on that sense.  Uh, we have
uh, 

A.39:  Now where's the city, the city limits.  It's kind of odd that a city would
actually spread over, uh, more than one county.  The city limits would actually
fall into more than one county.

B.40:  Yeah, the, the, the central, uh, part of the city, the downtown area --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- is in Fulton, almost exclusively.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Uh, but, yeah, I, I, I, most cities tend to stay most, mostly in, in one
county.  So, you know,

A.45:  Yeah.  In fact Sa-, San Francisco is entirely within the, the limits of San
Francisco county.  In fact, San Francisco county and city have the same city
limits [inhaling].

B.46:  [Laughter]  Right.

A.47:  So, that's kind of a weird thing, but.  Uh.

B.48:  Anyway, I guess I am trying to figure what else there is out here.  Oh, we
do get papers, uh, we, we get some help with the papers --

A.49:  Huh.

B.50:  -- but our, uh, our, our trash company does do a, a, uh, if you you sort
the papers and put them in a bag, they will put them in a separate area into
into the, uh, uh, (( )) garbage truck I guess.  I don't exactly how [noise]
they do it, [noise] but they do that [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter] Yeah that's an interesting term.  Because I mean if you, if you
think about it, the garbage truck well, is it really garbage if they are
taking it off to be recycled #and somebody's will to pay for it?#

B.52:  #Well, it pretty well then# I guess it is in, in that sense, uh, it still
is.

A.53:  Huh.

B.54:  I don't, I, uh, the, uh, the papers themselves, I mean they some how put
them off to the side and I don't know exactly how they do it.  Uh, but they,
but they do indicate that service --

A.55:  Huh.

B.56:  -- I thi-, you know I think they ought to really start pushing it more, you
know.  The idea that you were talking about where they, if they separated each
each container --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- that, that should be more available.  We should have more containers in
all city, uh, and all the grocery stores, uh --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- to help on that sort of thing.  That would, that would make it a lot
easier.  I know in, uh, some cities that they actually distribute out they, as
part of the service --

A.61:  Huh.

B.62:  -- they give you extra containers that you, that you can put things into so
you, you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like
that.

@@A.63:  Huh.  You, you have a very distinctive accent.  Uh, where are you from
originally?

B.64:  Well, and actually I am originally from Dayton, Ohio.

A.65:  No kidding.

B.66:  But that's,
