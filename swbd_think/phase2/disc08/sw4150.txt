REMARKS:        Speaker B had call waiting; therefore, it kept
making a clicking sound until she answered it.

===========================================================================

A.1:  All right?

B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  Okay.  How many kids do you have?  [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] I think w-, I think we're going to talk about parents spending
time with their children.  We,

@A.5:  #Right.#

B.6:  #have# three children who are eleven, nine, and eight.  [lipsmack] So this
is the big issue with us.  Although I don't recall marking it on my little
things to talk about but [laughter],

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  perhaps they are little for ((words)) to be said like day care and quality
time and,

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Anyway.  You don't have children?

A.11:  No.

B.12:  But you're married?

A.13:  Yeah, we, we've been married for two and a half years.  We've been trying
for about two years but --

B.14:  Oh.

A.15:  -- no luck yet.  #Hopefully,# 

B.16:  #You know,# I know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually
I'm getting a call.  I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting.
Could I ask you to hold one minute?

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I'll be right back.  #Excuse me,#

A.19:  #((Had-,))# 

B.20:  just a moment.  They're going to get mad [beep].

A.21:  {Speaker whispers to someone in the background} She had another call.
{pause} She has ((just)) three kids, eleven, nine, and eight.

B.22:  Hello?

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  I'm so sorry.

A.25:  All right.

B.26:  That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting
tomorrow --

A.27:  [Laughter]  Okay.  

B.28:  -- Brownie meeting.

A.29:  That keeps you bu-, 

B.30:  [Gasp].

A.31:  do you have a lot of activities with your kids?

B.32:  Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral [laughter]
conversation but, [gasp] yes, we do.

A.33:  [Groan].

B.34:  Both my husband and I work and our children are sixth, fourth, and third
grade.  And the school years are wonderful, they're just wonderful.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  The kids, they are real people and they are interesting and,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  they, they have all their own activities and, um, I think as parents we
really enjoy them in, in our personal situation our children have not yet
decided to rebel [laughter].

A.39:  Uh-huh.  So they're pretty #good kids, huh?#

B.40:  #I'm su-,# sure that's coming though.  But,

A.41:  #Yeah.#

B.42:  #they are# wonderful kids.

A.43:  Well, we had ((ni-, wh-,)) growing up I guess I can talk about us.  We had
nine kids in our family.  We had eight boys and one girl.  But, my #Dad, uh,#

B.44:  #You had eight# boys and one girl?

A.45:  Yeah.  And the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own
business so we worked with him most of the time.  So that's how we spent most
of the time #with him.#

B.46:  #Are you# Mormons?

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  That's what the Utah and the large family.

A.49:  [Laughter]  That was a dead giveaway, huh?

B.50:  Well, we're Catholics.  I came from a family of five.  I had four brothers,

A.51:  #Uh-huh.#

B.52:  #the# only girl.  

A.53:  Oh.

B.54:  And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.

A.55:  #Which that,# 

B.56:  #I never# felt spoiled.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  In fact ((I always thought)) my toys were destroyed [laughter].

A.59:  I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.

B.60:  No.  Usually busy fighting for survival.

A.61:  Yeah, that's [laughter] (( )).  #But,#

B.62:  #Well,# I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real
issues here.  #Um,#

A.63:  #Uh-huh.#

B.64:  that I think, um, I don't know.  It's an interesting [laughter]
((problem.))  I happen to, um, [lip_smack] I'm a pediatrician.

A.65:  Oh.

B.66:  My husband is a physician, so, uh, I, I (( )) I talk to parents about this
a lot.  But children, I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work
outside the home, um, ((need)) very early to come to grips with any guilt,

A.67:  #Yeah.#

B.68:  #that they# feel and decide what's best for them and their family.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be
flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing.
And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.

A.71:  #Uh-huh.#

B.72:  #I really# believe that.  And it has, um, helped us to afford some things
for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful
particularly at this age, and I think our kids are real secure.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be
anything both male and female ((a lot)) so I know it sounds like a
rationalization but it's, I really think it's true for our family,

A.75:  #Wel-,# 

B.76:  #and# I think it has worked very well.

A.77:  Yeah.  It's like you said, you know, to each his own.  And we're planning
on having my wife stay home.  And but,

B.78:  There's no question, I think that's really the best.  If, if a woman is
happy doing that,

A.79:  #Uh-huh.#

B.80:  #I hate# to put it quite that way.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  I was twenty-nine when I had my first child and, uh, I would not have been
real fulfilled.  I really would not have been totally staying home with a
young child.

A.83:  #Uh-huh.#

B.84:  #It's a# wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother but, [lipsmack] uh, I
like th-, I like the way I did it.

A.85:  Right.

B.86:  [Laughter] I sort of worked half time.  I had very flexible hours.
[lipsmack] I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year
and I,

A.87:  #Oh.#

B.88:  #you# can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I
preach all the time to, to mothers.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  Um, and I think we choose very, very carefully the, um, alternative
situations that we had them in.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  Some baby-sitting groups, again, I know it sounds like a rationalization,
but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other
children and they, they learn to share.  They learn not necessarily to be the
center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are
secure.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  [Lipsmack]  I think that helps.

A.95:  Well, that's good.  Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.

B.96:  Well, ((so, so)). 

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  So, your wife, does she work right now?

A.99:  Um, no, not right now.

B.100:  #She's out,# 

A.101:  #Right.# Well, we just moved down here.  We used to live up in Seattle for
a couple of years.

B.102:  You're still trying to dry out?

A.103:  It's [laughter] that's no problem here.  [laughter] Yeah, we really liked
it up there but then wh-,
