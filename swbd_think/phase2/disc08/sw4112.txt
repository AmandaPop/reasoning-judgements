=========================================================================

B.1:  Right now I'm at, uh, University of Pennsylvania.  I'm a graduate student.

A.2:  Oh. 

B.3:  And, the benefits that I get are very minimal.  

A.4:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.5:  But I do get my health insurance paid for, but I don't have any kind of
disability insurance or --

A.6:  Yeah.  

B.7:  -- uh, let's see, no disability insurance, no va-, well, I, in a way I get
vacation pay because I get to s-, totally set my own schedule.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  S-, but, not any real significant benefits.  

A.10:  Right.  

B.11:  My health insurance is very minimal.  

A.12:  [Laughter] Uh, I'm, I'm a co-op student at G T R I.  

B.13:  Uh-huh.  

A.14:  Uh, I go to school at Georgia Tech and we don't have benefits to speak of.
We don't have health insurance or paid vacation and,

B.15:  You're an undergraduate student?

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  Or graduate student?  

A.18:  Undergrad.  

B.19:  Undergrad.

A.20:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.21:  Yeah, yeah, here they, for the grad students, at least in physiology
department which my d-, degree granting department is bio engineering, but --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health
insurance.  Engineering doesn't even do that.

A.24:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.25:  But I don't know, I think that it would be great if, instead of having
health insurance and all those things --

A.26:  Uh-huh.  

B.27:  -- tied to a job the way they are now -- 

A.28:  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  -- so that some people can get them and some people can't, and it's like
having two classes of income, some that is taxed and some that is not --

A.30:  Right.  

B.31:  -- it would be great if they had everybody responsible for their own health
insurance --

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  -- and, either that, or they could be responsible for their own health
insurance --

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  -- but if they did take the company benefit, then that would be taxed like
other income so then that would, everybody would know what their real income
was and that --

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  -- their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them
something and that they might want to look around to get something better
somewhere else.

A.38:  Well, that's a good idea.  I had never thought about it that way.

B.39:  So, I guess, I would like to see something like that and then, I guess the
--

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  -- going beyond just the idea of benefits having, instead of, uh, a
national health insurance system, having a sort of like an F D I C for health
insurers --

A.42:  Uh-huh.  

B.43:  -- so if you're health insurance company goes out of business, you don't
lose everything --

A.44:  Yeah.  

B.45:  -- if you get sick.  

A.46:  Right, right, that's, that would be a wonderful idea.  

B.47:  But, on the other hand, in the cur-, state of the current system --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  -- I'll, whenever I get out of here, I'll look for a job, probably an
academic job that would, you know, benefits --

A.50:   ((Uh-huh)).

B.51:   -- I don't know how important that will be.  

A.52:   Ri-,

B.53:  Usually academic jobs you get T I A A for your retirement plan --

A.54:  Uh-huh.  

B.55:  -- which is a, it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits
with you into whatever job you go to.

A.56:  Uh-huh.  

B.57:  And,

A.58:  I didn't know that.  

B.59:  A lot of academic jobs give you that, but on the other hand, state
retirement, if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking
good care of you.

A.60:  Really.  

B.61:  I know my daddy worked for the federal government -- 

A.62:  Uh-huh.  

B.63:  -- and he was in the soil conservation service -- 

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  -- and then after he retired from that he taught school for a while --

A.66:  Uh-huh.  

B.67:  -- and he had taught school early in his career so he got the federal
retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits.

A.68:  Wow.  

B.69:  And the most important for him has been the health insurance because my
mama isn't particularly well.

A.70:  Uh-huh.  

B.71:  She has, uh, she's a kidney patient on dialysis -- 

A.72:  Uh-huh.  

B.73:  -- and he was saying that, now that her kidneys have totally failed --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- they've s-, taken her off one of the drugs, ((Lasix)), which is a
diuretic.  It, it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture.

A.76:  Uh-huh.  

B.77:  And her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month [laughter].

A.78:  Wow.  

B.79:  So,

A.80:  [Hiss]. 

B.81:  And that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and -- 

A.82:  Yipe.  

B.83:  -- so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get.

A.84:  Right.  

B.85:  What kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out?

A.86:  Oh, [breathing] I'm, I'm just not entirely sure.  I have only been working
here for one quarter.  This is my first quarter here and, uh, I'm not really
all too sure what kind of jobs are available and, uh, haven't gotten them yet,
I'm doing it in a few minutes {to someone else in the room}.

B.87:  Uh-huh.  

A.88:  Uh, and I, I, I'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter
and see how I like that, see, uh --

B.89:  Uh-huh.  

A.90:  -- if research for a school would be something I would consider.

B.91:  [Clicking] Uh-huh, what kind of company are you working with, co-oping?

A.92:  Oh, uh, it's the Georgia Tech Research Institute.  It's affiliated with the
university, uh --

B.93:  I see.  

A.94:  -- and, uh, we do research.  Uh, the one I'm in, the lab I'm in does
research in microwaves and antennas and, uh, we do a lot of research for the
federal government.

B.95:  Uh-huh.  

A.96:  So a lot of our, uh, expenses are, you know, covered by the federal
government.

B.97:  Right.
