B.1:  Recording.  

A.2:  So, what kind of animals do you have?  

B.3:  Well, I have two cats.  

A.4:  Uh.  

B.5:  I have two cats, because I can't have dogs, uh, where I live.  I, I've
wanted a dog.  I owned a d-, we had dogs when I was growing up all the time --

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  -- and, uh, you know, our, our cats are, are very interesting and we never
owned cats when I was growing up so this is a, uh, it's been a really, really,
uh, neat kind of learning experience for me.  They've blown all my, uh, con-,
preconceptions about cats.

A.8:  [Laughter].

B.9:  So, do you, do you have pets?  

A.10:  Yeah, I have a dog and a cat.  

B.11:  Uh-oh.

A.12:  So,  

B.13:  Do they get along?  

A.14:  Oh, yeah, they, it was, uh, a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  Uh, the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old
and it, it was a hefty break in [laughter].

B.17:  Oh, did the dog, the dog like, uh, know that there was a cat and,

A.18:  Well, it was very, it was interesting because it, it's just, you know, part
of their makeup, they're psyche, I mean, they just hate each other --

B.19:  Um.  

A.20:  -- automatically, but after a while they, they got to be good friends and,
uh, luckily, it's sort of a big cat, I mean, it's about twelve pounds,

B.21:  [Laughter]. 

A.22:  and, uh, so he can hold his own against the dog and, uh, but they, they, I
basically got the cat to keep the dog company.

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:  And, uh,

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  they, they do that [laughter].

B.27:  Yeah, that's, that's actually why we got our second cat.  I, we thought our
cat needed a pet.

A.28:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.29:  Uh, you know, you tend to personify these things but our, our cat thinks,
our oldest cat thinks that it, it should be a person, and our youngest cat
actually thinks it's a cat,

A.30:  [Laughter].

B.31:  so it works out -- 

A.32:  Yeah.  

B.33:  -- pretty  well.  Uh,

A.34:  Well, I'll tell you one thing I found with, with pets, uh, I, I think cats
are easier to take care of, especially when, on a situation like you go off on
a trip --

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  -- you know, it's a real pain with a dog -- 

B.37:  Yeah.  

A.38:  -- because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them
out and that kind of thing and --

B.39:  Feed them and all that.  

A.40:  -- sometimes I think, wow, if I had two cats, I'd just, you know, get a
feeder [laughter],

B.41:   That,

A.42:   And, 

B.43:  Yeah, you know, an interesting story is I, I, I have a friend who has a, a
cat that actually knows how to open Tender Vittles bags,

A.44:  [Laughter].

B.45:  so if they go on a trip [laughter], they just leave the bag on the kitchen
floor and the cat will go and open one when it wants to eat.

A.46:  Oh, that's amazing.  

B.47:  I'm,

A.48:  [Laughter]. 

B.49:  I swear to God it's like, you know, the, I guess, uh, it, earlier, uh,
earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but,

A.50:  [Laughter]. 

B.51:  you know, now it, it's pretty self sufficient.  I just think,

A.52:  [Laughter]. 

B.53:  Y-, they say you own a dog and you feed a cat -- 

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  -- and I think that that's pretty much,

A.56:  [Laughter].

B.57:  pretty much true.  

A.58:  That is interesting.  I hadn't ever heard anything like that. 

B.59:  Go-,  it blew me away. 

A.60:  But, uh, yeah, we've been, uh, we've been pretty lucky, too.  The, reason
we first got the dog to begin with was I lived, I'm in school still --

B.61:  Uh-huh.  

A.62:  -- and I lived, uh, closer to campus and, uh, as usual, the neighborhoods
right near campus aren't that nice --

B.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.64:  -- and, uh, so we got the dog as protection, and I guess it worked because
we were never broken into and th-, but the people on either side of us were
[laughter].

B.65:  Oh, really?  

A.66:  So yeah, uh,

B.67:  Uh, we, we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when, you
know [laughter], you move into a bad neighborhood.  ((You have)) your --

A.68:  [Laughter]. 

B.69:  -- have all your friends over, play the Grateful Dead and clean your rifles --

A.70:  [Laughter]. 

B.71:  -- and they pretty much get the idea.  Uh, but, -- 

A.72:  [Laughter]. 

B.73:  -- the dog I guess, would work, too.  

A.74:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.75:  [Laughter]. 

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  Well, it is a big dog?  

A.78:  Uh, she's a, around fifty pounds.  She's a, a very, very skinny shepherd
[laughter].

B.79:  Oh. 

A.80:  Uh,   

B.81:  Okay.

A.82:  Well, she's not pure and we, we tried to figure out what she was crossed
with.  We know the mother was a shepherd, but, uh, she looks like she's
crossed with, like, greyhound because she is --

B.83:  Oh. 

A.84:  -- just thin as a rail -- 

B.85:  Wow, well, see -- 

A.86:  -- and, uh,

B.87:  -- they, they say that the, uh, mixed breeds have a better temperament
anyway.  All that inbreeding that they do, that they have to do to maintain a
pure blood line, I guess makes them really weird.

A.88:  Yeah, definitely, and they're also prone to more diseases and, uh, skin
problems and, my sister has a, a pure bred gold, uh, yellow Lab and that dog
has every problem [laughter] you could imagine, you know.

B.89:  ((That)),   

A.90:  It's allergic to fleas, it's, uh, got another skin condition and just,

B.91:  The dreaded hip dysplasia.  

A.92:  Yeah, yeah [laughter].  

B.93:  Yeah, that's, uh [laughter],

A.94:  So, we haven't really had much problems with her.  She's, uh, just
extremely hyper --

B.95:  Uh-huh.  

A.96:  -- and, uh, I guess that accounts for her, her physique and she runs like a
gazelle, so it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around
all the other dogs [laughter].

B.97:  [Laughter].

A.98:  She's trying to play with them and they look at her like, you're crazy.

B.99:  She's,

A.100:  You think I'm going to catch you.  

B.101:  Maybe she is part greyhound, huh?  

A.102:  But, yeah, yeah.  

B.103:  Huh.  

A.104:  Either,   

B.105:  That's, that's, uh, that's interesting.  I thought about, for a while
there, uh, there's a d-, a movement now to, uh, adopt ex-race dogs.

A.106:  Right.  

B.107:  A-,
