=======================================================================

B.1:  Uh, no, this elderly, care of the elderly, I am looking at this right now
with my father and it is a tough decision to make [laughter].

@A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  That, uh,

A.4:  Does he, he live at home now #and,#

B.5:  #Yes.# He's and, he's living at home [throat_clearing].  More or less
alone.  My sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden
on her --

A.6:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.7:  -- and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about, you know, just
letting him do what he wants to do and of course he feels like he is capable
of taking care of himself and we know better [laughter].

A.8:  Um.  I know.  My, uh, my mother, uh, my grandmother is still alive --

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  -- and uh, feisty old, old lady. 

B.11:  [Laughter].

A.12:  She's, uh, she's really pretty good, but she really just can't get around
any more and she does have signi-, significant health problems --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- and my mom is looking after, after her and it, it's a big drain on my
mom.  I can tell when I get calls from her.  She, she sounds worn out --

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  -- uh, and, uh, it's tough on, on my grandmother because she's use to just
going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her
friends, but now she's no longer where she grew up [breathing], her friends
have all passed on --

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  -- or are in another city.  She can't just run right out and get things.
So a lot of these things fall on my mom.  Go to the store, get me this, I want
to go do that.  Uh, I've changed my mind.

B.19:  [Laughter].

A.20:  Phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome.

B.21:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

A.22:  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, I, I can see from a distance, I'm not right there
on top of it.  Maybe I am a little more objective, but [inhaling] I would
think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of
all she could be happy.

B.23:  Well, that's, that will be a problem --

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  -- because I have looked [laughter].

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  And they all really amount to the same thing.  Uh, I have looked for all,
both ends of the scale really from your kind of State run things to the very
private elite type and really it boil down to I think to one thing.  You're
putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die --

A.28:  Um.

B.29:  -- and it's, uh, it's sad, but that's the way we've been brought up to look
at it [noise] and I hate it, but there comes a time when, when this is what
what happens --

A.30:  Yeah.

B.31:  -- especially with the way medicine is today.  It's keeping us alive
[noise] longer and we're living longer so therefore, you know.

A.32:  You almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care, but a little
bit more independent than that --

B.33:  Right.

A.34:  -- almost, almost like a community that has partly something like
condominiums --

B.35:  Yeah. 

A.36:  -- #where those# --

B.37:  #It's kind of our,# 

A.38:  -- people that are mobile can still retain their independence, but maybe
have somebody come by and check on them once or #twice# --

B.39:  #Right.#

A.40:  -- a day.  Bring them the groceries, or come by and chat or whatever and
then a hospice for those who are no longer quite so #mobile.#

B.41:  #Uh-huh.#

A.42:  The problem with everything else in health care is, is the cost.

B.43:  The cost is just unreal [laughter].

A.44:  Uh, I mean that's, that's almost why some of the, you know, the, the
experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all
their money together and and do that sort of thing, but it's, it's yo-, you
start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets.

B.45:  Right.  #Well that's,# 

A.46:  #So they want# to really make a, a ((method)) of it.  I wish that we could
find some place for, for my grandmother.  She would be happier --

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  -- uh, and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and, and really she's
lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is
deteriorating --

B.49:  Right. Right.

A.50:  -- and, and the stress is just enormous.  I, I feel for you.  You're,
you're one step closer than I am to it and it must be, it must be really
draining on you.

B.51:  Well, it is, especially since he lives in Mississippi.  I live in Texas and
then my sister lives in Louisiana.

A.52:  Oh.

B.53:  [Laughter] This, this you know, it makes, in fact I just got back from
having to go stay with him because she needed to get away.

A.54:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.55:  And it's, uh, but, uh, I don't know what other solution there is.
Eventually, we're going to have to put him in a home some place.

A.56:  Oh, it, it, uh, right now though he's independent enough to to take care of
day to day or, or ha-, 

B.57:  Well, more or less, but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind.

A.58:  Oh.

B.59:  So that is really what bothers us --

A.60:  Oh yeah.

B.61:  -- uh, he could start a fire, uh, just about anything [laughter] #could# --

A.62:  #((Oh)).#

B.63:  -- happen.

A.64:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can appreciate that and there's [inhaling] there use to be
programs [inhaling] in some of the more progressive communities of, of house
mates --

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  -- somebody that comes and lives there and for room and board takes care of
people, but you need, you need a contact service in the community.  I'd, I'd
even be happy just, uh, trying to find a day program that my --

B.67:  Right.

A.68:  -- grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the
day.  Meeting so-, right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the
only people she,
