============================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right.

A.3:  What's your view.

B.4:  Huh?

A.5:  What's your view?

@B.6:  [Throat_clearing] Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control
guns.

A.7:  Yeah [laughter].

B.8:  Personally.

A.9:  Yeah, that's true.

B.10:  I mean,

A.11:  You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market
all over the place, you know,

B.12:  That's right.  That's right.

A.13:  I don't know.  Coming from Texas you're probably, I don't know I shouldn't
make stereo types, but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down
there I would think.

B.14:  Yeah.  It is, but I'm not really from [laughter] I'm not really from Texas,
I just live down here now.  #I've# --

A.15:  #Oh, you're# just live down there?

B.16:  -- I've lived down here a couple years.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  I'm originally from Colorado, but #yeah# --

A.19:  #Oh well.#  [laughter].

B.20:  -- there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.

A.21:  Yeah, well I know how you feel.  I'm, uh, I grew up in Nebraska and, and we
always use to go out and hunt all the time, you know and --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- man, there's no way.  [laughter] There's no way I would ever go for a
total ban on all weapons.  That's just, I don't know.

B.24:  I just think, I think it's ridiculous.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  I mean,

A.27:  It doesn't sit with me very well.  [laughter] I don't know, I, anymore I
keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.

B.28:  Really.

A.29:  Yeah, I just about all, well I live in Minneapolis and [children_talking]
I, well actually I live in Florida, but I am staying [children_talking] in
Minneapolis for a year and --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- and it's just, you never know who is out there. 

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  You know it's just for self protection purposes and then of course there's
the hunting issue, so --

B.36:  Sure.

A.37:  -- yeah that's good.  What do you do, Jeff?

B.38:  Uh, I, I'm in, uh, program control for a company up here.

A.39:  Oh, yeah.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  All right.

B.42:  We do schedules, for --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- programs, schedule programs.  What do you do?

A.45:  I'm, uh, researcher of Honeywell up here.

B.46:  Oh, okay.

A.47:  So, uh, yeah.  You guys [child_talking], uh, do you get much of a chance to
hunt or anything or,

B.48:  Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.  I
don't own a shotgun, but I'd like to go bird hunting.

A.49:  Yeah.  #You know# --

B.50:  #So.#

A.51:  -- that's something I miss quite a bit.

B.52:  Yeah, uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- you, you know, quite a bit but,

A.55:  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts
out in Idaho for a while [child_talking] and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a
bit, but I don't know.  I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, uh,
for a complete,

B.56:  One for a total ban --

A.57:  That's right.

B.58:  -- and, uh,

A.59:  I guess I am about eight or nine [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah, I, I agree with you there [child_crying].

A.61:  Yeah, no doubt about it but, uh, 

B.62:  I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which
they can't --

A.63:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

B.64:  -- I, you know, #I'm not# --

A.65:  #Yeah, if there's# --

B.66:  -- for it.

A.67:  -- if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know
[child-talking] that they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here
while back [child_talking] in some states in terms of a [child_talking]
waiting period --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- where you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually, uh, I
know it's this way in Florida.  They have a waiting period where you buy one
and that's a week --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you
know and things like that.  I think that's a pretty good idea.  Uh, and
that's, I don't know, that's not a bad idea, but then again you can always get
around that.  You could go through the black market like you say.  You know,
you always be able to get around but, uh, 

B.72:  [Throat_clearing]  Sure.

A.73:  Yeah, it's one of things but, uh, I don't know.  I guess, I guess some
forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why
anybody would need a full automatic weapon.

B.74:  Yeah, I don't either [sneezing].

A.75:  Yeah, I'm just not, I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned
altogether anyway.

B.76:  Yeah, I --

A.77:  There,

B.78:  -- fully auto, but, even well, I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's,

A.79:  It kind of takes the sport out of hunting  [laughter].

B.80:  Yeah.  Right.

A.81:  You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self
protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.

B.82:  Sure.

A.83:  You know, you might do the same thing.

B.84:  Right.

A.85:  And so it's like, I don't know.  It does.  It takes the sport out of it.
For me I would much rather have a bow anytime [laughter].

B.86:  Oh, really.

A.87:  I, I like bows.  You know, I have done some bow hunting and I, uh, I get
into it and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  But, uh, I don't know.  I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.

B.90:  Sure.

A.91:  But, uh, I don't know.  Anyway, that's about where I stand [laughter].

B.92:  Me too.

A.93:  You, uh,

B.94:  Yeah, I am about the same way.

@@A.95:  And you, uh, have you eaten yet or whatever.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  Is it seven o'clock there?

B.98:  Uh, yeah, it's about seven fifteen.

A.99:  You guys central?

B.100:  How is the weather up there?

A.101:  Oh, it's not too good.  It's kind of rainy actually.

B.102:  Is it?

A.103:  Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, I
don't know, ten or twenty degrees --

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  -- and it's been up around forty.  So people are, people are whining about
the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature.  Ice is starting to
melt and stuff like that so.

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  I am just up here for the year and it's kind of shocking.
