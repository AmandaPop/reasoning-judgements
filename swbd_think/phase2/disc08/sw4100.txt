===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because I am now in
the middle of a job search, graduating here and realizing that one of the
things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility
because my wife will have some set of benefits where ever she is working and
the ability to mix and match in a useful way, particularly with things like
medical and dental.  It's something that I've been, uh, looking for.

@B.2:  Yeah, that's true.  One of the really disturbing things for me is, uh, is
the way that the government mandates [noise] that all insurance policies
include particular benefits.  Uh, even though, you could, you might never have
any need for them.  Uh, here in Georgia, they just passed a law for example
that every health insurance policy must include coverage for mammograms and
pap smears. [inhaling] It doesn't matter that you're single and male.  You
still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears and that --

A.3:  That's amusing. [laughter] Yeah.

B.4:  -- [Laughter] and it's that kind of thing that, uh, uh, that bothers me.

A.5:  Yeah, we have a similar thing in California and I think that at the moment
you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance
abuse and certain other mental health issues.

B.6:  And drug treat-, yeah, drug treatment --

A.7:  And --

B.8:  -- and alcohol and #yeah that is the same thing# --

A.9:  -- #the result is a lot of people won't# --

B.10:  -- here even if your --

A.11:  -- provided at all or #over charge.#

B.12:  -- #even if you're# a Mormon you still have to have, uh, coverage for
smoking recovery, you know [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  [Inhaling] Uh, but, but in general, you're idea about flexibility I think
is a very good one because, uh, uh, if, if you have a a full gamut of, of
coverages, uh, uh, there might there might be a lot of things that [noise] the
company is is willing to pay for, but that you're simply not interested in --

A.15:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.16:  -- and what you prefer to do is say, don't get some of those programs, but
shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or
something.

A.17:  The other things is they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange
ways.  For instance, I know where my wife works she can get for something like
five or ten dollars a month, sole health insurance --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- but, it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include
me on that policy.  Well assuming that we both work at places that feel this
way, we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place
because those two places will never get together and agree.  Okay, one of them
will pay for all of the, uh, the dental and optical and the other one will pay
for the medical --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- instead it's just very much designed towards self only insurance.  I
don't know if all employers are that way, but a lot of them I've seen are.

B.22:  [Inhaling] Yeah, I think that, that, uh, a lot of them are that way.  They
uh, they de-, they deal with coordination of benefits and and no particular
illness, who's the primary carrier and who's the secondary carrier but, uh,
[smack] everyone tries to be the secondary --

A.23:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.24:  -- carrier [laughter] and it's very difficult to to get it worked out.  Uh,
I know at Hayes, uh, [noise] the coverage for the employee is, is completely
paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty-eight
dollars a month.

A.25:  Well, that's pretty good.

B.26:  It is.  I'm very pleased, uh, very pleased with the benefit package that we
have that has, uh, uh, dental check ups are completely covered.  Uh, there's a
lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the
first dollar, --

A.27:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.28:  -- particularly, if you chose low cost alternatives, like out patient
treatment rather than inpatient and, uh, things like that, uh, they have good
educational benefits if you want to, uh, try to improve your, uh, you know to
work further on a degree or get a master's degree of something.  Uh, uh, of
course,

A.29:  That's something, this university, at least the graduate student negotiated
[noise] plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  I know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the
university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their
research.  So, in fact, you are saving them, you know, hundreds of dollars in
billings by going to a research, uh, physician, yet at the same time they will
only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the
physicians that the, and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that
doctor you're saving them [noise] you know a couple of hundred dollars over
going to somebody else.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And a lot of things like that.  So, one thing I was wondering, it was
something I have noticed that they don't publicize much, a lot of [noise]
companies, in particularly, organizations, school and government organizations
have is legal, uh, services #of some sort.#

B.34:  #Yeah, we don't have that either.#

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  Uh, and in some ways I think it's, it would be a very good thing, uh, to be
able to get your wills done --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- and, and, uh, advice just by picking up the phone without having to
actually, uh, you know, pay somebody extra,
