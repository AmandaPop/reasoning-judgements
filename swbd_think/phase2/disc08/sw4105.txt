========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Well, lets see.  I, I guess I'll mention it.  I always, one of the
things I always considered was real important about job benefits, I always,
uh, I know they can't do anything about it, but I always though location and
quality of life in the region was important towards, uh, job benefit.  At
least, it had a lot to do with what I chose in my job and and besides, you
know, I guess, uh, salary and, uh, work.  But see those are the things that
they really can't do much about [laughter].

A.2:  That's true.  Unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different
branches.  Uh, it was important for me to pick a job, uh, to choose a job that
was in the northeast, uh, because I like the region and my family is here.  At
one point, I'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise,
Idaho --

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  -- and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me.

B.5:  Yeah the, uh, I was, I actually was from the midwest but I, uh, always
liked the, uh, concept of going to a warmer cl-, climate --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- and so, uh, I generally lean towards the sun belt, uh, I have worked in
San Diego and I have worked in Atlanta.  So you can see that I have moved
father south since then.  [laughter] Uh, I use to live in Ohio when I, when I
was going to school and, uh, it's still, it, it becomes a very strong benefit.
I, uh, I interviewed with a company in Baltimore and, uh, Boston and, uh, just
the, the amount of time that it shuts down, that winter shuts you down for
activity always use to bother me because I really never got into the winter
sports, but I'd like to be very much into the active intramural sports. That
was important to me.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  Uh, other job benefit, uh, job benefits, uh, I like the idea of companies
being flexible, uh, uh, with the time schedules, as much as possible, I mean,
you can't do too much and I understand that.

A.10:  [Inhaling] I agree with that.  Uh, I found though that, that, uh, it, it
will benefit both the employee and the company I work for.  A firm that does
have a very flexible schedule and I can't remember the last time that I just
worked forty hours a week.  So the, uh, it works out that if I have to go in
late for a reason or I have to leave early for a reason, no one raises an
eyebrow, but because of that I'm not a clock watcher.  [throat_clearing] If I,
if I knew they were expecting me there at eight thirty every day and I
couldn't leave until five, I, I think I'd be, uh, uh, have a greater tendency
to wait until the clock hit five and #then saying, out of here.#

B.11:  #You're out of there.# Yeah.  [laughter] You then, then you're punching a
clock --

A.12:  Right.

B.13:  -- and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say, you
know, why should I give them anymore.  But what they, if they respect you as a
professional, you treat them like a professional.  At that, I take it then
that you are also a professional [laughter] salaried employee [laughter].

A.14:  [Laughter]  Yeah, that's correct.

B.15:  [Laughter].

A.16:  Well, that's correct.

B.17:  Uh, it, usually they end up getting a lot more hours than I, I, uh, have
been the classic forty hours a week.  Sometimes I hate to think about it if I
would actually add up the hours [laughter].

A.18:  [Laughter].

B.19:  Then if I were getting time and a half what I was really making per hour.

A.20:  Right [laughter].

B.21:  Oops.  [laughter]  Bu-, let's see, what other.  #I have# --

A.22:  #Another (( )),#

B.23:  -- always liked, I have always liked some vacation.  I, I've --

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  -- been fortunate.  I actually had, uh, a com-, I just, just transferred
jobs about a week ago.  [laughter] So, but, uh, for the last five years I was
in a company that had four weeks vacation.

A.26:  [Noise] Wow [laughter].

B.27:  [Laughter] Now that was a real nice benefit.  It gave me a lot of
flexibility.  Uh, but, of course now, I've gone to zero amount of years in the
company --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- so now I am back to the, to the, uh, original two weeks.  [laughter]
That was a tough benefit to give up.

A.30:  Right.  Uh, the company I am working for now starts everyone out at three
weeks vacation --

B.31:  Yeah, that is a good benefit.

A.32:  -- and I, I thought that was great except during the first year I ended up
only being able to take about a week and a half of it [laughter].

B.33:  Right.  Because of the amount of, amount of work that yo-, had to be done.

A.34:  Right.  I was, I was so busy, uh, and it, we've got a very small department
and I was just wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take
time off and when I did take the time off I'd, uh, get calls from work anyway.
So it's only been, uh,
