===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, Toby, have you ever served on a jury in a criminal trial?

@B.2:  No, I've always wanted to and, uh, but they never, uh, my name never seems
to come up.

A.3:  Well, I'm not sure whether you're the lucky one or I am [laughter],

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  because I have done it, and, uh, [lipsmack] oh [breathing],

B.6:   What did you think of the process?  

A.7:  Well, we had a hung jury so I, I came away really disappointed in the
process or the, least the people involved.  I was very frustrated about that.

B.8:  How hung was it, I mean, what was the vote?  

A.9:  I, I think it was something like, oh, ten to three, ten to two or --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- nine to three or something like that which really means that if, if we
hadn't of had to have unanimous decision, we would have, uh, we would have
completed our mission [laughter], if you will.

B.12:  Yeah, yeah, but it's, [breathing] uh, I don't know, I, I've always thought
that the f-, uh, the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't
any doubt in people's minds and if it, uh, if, in, like in your case, if
there's two people who, who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty,
then, or innocent, I --

A.13:  I think it was ten people.  

B.14:  -- you didn't say which way it went.  

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  No it's, the funny, 

B.18:  It can go either way, if there's two people that aren't convinced one way
or the other, then that's, uh, you know, I don't, I think w-, one change that
might be worthwhile would be to say that you need, unanimous verdict to find
somebody guilty, but, but if you don't get a unanimous guilty verdict, then
they're innocent because the prosecution didn't prove their case to all twelve
people.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  Uh,

A.21:  Well, the, the crazy thing about this trial was that the guy said, yes, I
did this, I did this armed robbery, but he wanted a jury to decide his
sentence, and we couldn't even agree on a sentence.

B.22:  Huh.  

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  Huh.  

A.25:  I, I mean, I was ready to put the guy, guy away forever, but I was dealing
with people who said, well, if it were my son, I'd want him to have another
chance.

B.26:  That's ridiculous.  

A.27:  [Laughter] I know.  

B.28:  Uh, here in Georgia the only time that the jury gets involved in sentencing
at all is in capital punishment cases.

A.29:  Oh, is that right, otherwise the judge does it?  

B.30:  The judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here.

A.31:  Do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed?  

B.32:  I think it is appropriate.  I think that the judge probably has a much
better, uh, feel for what sentences other people who have committed comparable
p-, crimes have received and what the guidelines are and, uh, I, I think that
by the time you get to that point, all the facts have been settled, the
person's been convicted and the punishment should be, well, a fairly
objective, uh, thing.  Uh, I don't know if there really needs to be all that
much discretion in sentencing, once you've determined what crime the person is
guilty of.

A.33:  Yeah, well, and I do not know if it is this way it all states or not, but
in Texas there are severe limitations on what the jury can kn-, know about
the, the prior history of the alleged criminal --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing.  Like,
if you give somebody fifteen years, they'll be out in three weeks or something
like that.  I, maybe it's not quite that radical, but, but those things are
not, those are things are kept from the jury.

B.36:  Yeah, here in Georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing, like
in a capital case, the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you, if you
give them life, he'll be out in seven years.  That's against the rules.

A.37:  Yeah, why?  [laughter]. 

B.38:  Uh, but, in, with the judge making all the other sentences, uh, course the
judge has open to him all of the previous criminal history, uh, uh, and, uh,
obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines, uh, or what all the effects
can be of parole and things like that.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  Uh, so, I think the, th-, the reform of the jury process that I would like
most to see is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to
judge, not only the facts of the case, but also the law itself.  Uh, juries, a
lot of people are not aware of this, but it is, it is part of the common law
and it, th-, really is, in Georgia, it is part of the state Constitution, and
it is in the Constitution of a lot of states, that if the jury, uh, believes
that the law that someone is being tried on is unjust, the law itself is
unjust, the jury can refuse to convict the person.

A.41:  Huh.

B.42:  Uh, and this is sort of the people's, uh, last line of defense against
govern-,
