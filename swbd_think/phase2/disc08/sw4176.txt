REMARKS:        Speakers talked over each other and interrupted a
lot.  Also, they sounded similar at times.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Oh, have you ever thought about joining the Peace Corps?  

B.2:  Uh, f-, not for any longer than about ten seconds.  

A.3:  [Laughter] Yeah was, that was pretty much my thought, too [laughter].

B.4:  No, I have no, [laughter] I have no real desire to do that [laughter].

@A.5:  I, I've, I've, I've act-, I've talked to people that, uh, have, have
joined the Peace Corps and, uh, the idea of like, you know, spending, spending
like two years in a village in Uganda is, you know, teaching people how to
like, you know, plow a straight furrow is just --

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  -- not my idea of [laughter] something I want to do with my life
[laughter].

B.8:  Yeah, I don't, doesn't appeal to me either.  

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  Where I work, uh, there's a guy who actually joined the Peace Corps, he
worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana in --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- in Africa [laughter] -- 

A.13:  ((Uh)),

B.14:  -- and, uh,

A.15:  What did he say about it?  

B.16:  Well, he hasn't come back yet.

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  Oh, you mean, he, he, I, he did this just recently.  

B.20:  Yeah, he went just recently.  

A.21:  I, you know, I, I thought that joining the Peace Corps was something that
everybody did like in the sixties.

B.22:  Well there's,

A.23:  You know, in,

B.24:  Yeah, but there's actually been a resurgence of people getting into it, I
guess part, partly for economic times.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And, uh, I don't know any other reason, but lot of people are been getting
back into it I think [laughter].

A.27:  I, yeah, I, I, I talked to, I was talking to somebody, uh, the other day
and they, they said, I think they went, they were in the Peace Corps and they
ended up going to like Central America or something --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- and, uh, they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face
in like, you know, seventy-five years --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- and, uh, they had to go on the, it's like they had t-, it, it's the
typical third world story, you know, they, they had to, every, ev-, once a
week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into, and take, drive
up into the mountains and stop at each village, you know, and, and have, like
--

B.32:  Uh-huh {faint}.

A.33:  -- give lectures on like public health and stuff.  

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  You know, it's like don't piss in the wells [laughter],

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  -- that, that type of stuff -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- and, uh, he said that they would get on the bus and it's, like, the
children would come up and, like, touch him because, you know, they had never
seen somebody that light, you know, a gringo --

B.40:  Sure.  

A.41:  -- and that it was, it was pretty, it was really pretty strange.  I, it
was, it would seem to me like if joining the Peace Corps is like, you know,
going to anoth-, signing up to go to another planet, you know.

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure, I mean, I guess the motivation is partly you
want to help these people, but I think it's a lot of people join it just to go
to another country and kind of for the adventure of it, I guess.

A.45:  I would really be afraid of, I, I don't know, when I, I went to school, I,
I, uh, I took a course in parasitology and stuff like that.

B.46:  Um.  

A.47:  I would really be afraid of like, you know, of all the diseases and stuff
that I could catch and like --

B.48:  Oh, yeah.  

A.49:  -- and man, it, it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight. 

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  Seems a little rough for that.  

A.53:  You know [laughter].  

B.54:  [Breathing] But, uh,

A.55:  Oh, I don't know.  

B.56:  I don't know, I kind of, you know, I don't mind going to Europe, you know,
traveling and seeing the sights, but I don't want to have to go to Africa to,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  No, th-, maybe --

A.59:  I,  

B.60:  -- they, they'll, they'll fly you over there and back for free but,

A.61:  [Laughter]. 

B.62:  doesn't seem worth it.  

A.63:  No, it, it doesn't seem like the kind of job that I, I'd really be in-, I'm
really interested in either.

B.64:  What type of work do you do now?  

A.65:  Uh, I'm a, I'm an engineer.  

B.66:  Okay.  

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  For, who do you work for, you work for,

A.69:  Uh, Lockheed.  

B.70:  Oh, really?  I didn't know they had an office up there.

A.71:  Yeah, uh, we, uh, they have a, we work for some, uh, Lockheed, Sanders.
We, we don't build the aircraft, per se, we work on the, uh, like the
#avionics.#

B.72:  #((Sanders))# avionics.

A.73:  Yeah, we, we put the,

B.74:  Okay, yeah, I've heard of Sanders Corporation.  Were they bought out by
Lockheed ((and all of that))?

A.75:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.76:  Okay.  

A.77: They, they were bought out by Lockheed and it's a, they were, they were
involved, like, in, in radars and thing, and, uh, and things like that.

B.78:  Right, that's, that's kind of the work that I do, so --

A.79:  Oh,

B.80:  -- that's why I've heard of Sanders.  

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  #I work for# --

A.83:  #Who do you work for#?  

B.84:  -- I work for Georgia Tech.   

A.85:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.86:  In research.  

A.87:  Yeah, we, it, it's, it's not bad, it's not bad work, although, I'll tell
you, it's like, uh, I, being in the defense industry is not, is not really the
thing to, to be --

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  -- in right now.  

B.90:  That's right [laughter].  

A.91:  It, it's sort of like being in steel, like ten years ago [laughter].

B.92:  Yeah, ((you're just)) kind of biding your time.  

A.93:  Right, you, you know that, uh, w-, I was just talking to somebody about
this the other day is that, uh, I, I haven't seen a, a, a new hire, uh,
somebody, you know, just fresh out of college --

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  -- brought into the company in like a year and a half -- 

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  -- and, uh, what's happening is that, you know, we're just like kind of
getting grayer and grayer and grayer.

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  You know, the, the, there's no growth here.  

B.100:  Yeah, it, we're essentially the same, although, some, some laboratories are
hiring if, if they can find new technology, uh, you know, or make an efforts
to get into the commercial markets.

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  So we're kind of getting smaller through attrition, but there, in some
cases we're hiring also.

A.103:  Yeah, [throat_clearing] this, the, this attrition thing, though, I, that,
that, that's like death itself in my mi-,
