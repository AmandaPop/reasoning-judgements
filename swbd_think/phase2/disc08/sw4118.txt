==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I don't know, uh, does your, do you have recycling in Atlanta?

@B.2:  Uh, yeah, I [throat_clearing] seen some, uh, there's some trucks that come
around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big
containers on them and they'll go and, uh, and collect, collect it, but I
think the, I think it's pretty expensive to do.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Do you have to, do you have to do the sorting or do they do the
sorting for you?

B.4:  Well, from I can tell, what I've seen of it, they have different color
containers and, uh, you sort of sort it out, uh, in your home and then put it
out on the curb and the-, and they just throw the matching color, uh --

A.5:  Uh-huh, into the -- 

B.6:  -- container,

A.7:  -- different box.  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  Yeah, up here, like New Hampshire doesn't, uh, well, where I am, we don't
have any recycling.  We don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that
and that's --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- that's not real, that's not real popular with the states around us
because the, the extra nickel, or --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- ((what is it)), extra thirty cents for a, for a, for six bottles, e-,
everybody comes across the border, [laughter] to buy the cheaper, the, the
cheaper --

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- drinks.  

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  But, I n-, I, I, I think that, well, I do some recycling like I save my, my
bottles and things like that, but I don't think I do a-, as much, I think I
could do more.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  And, I, there's a big problem here with like landfills.  

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  Uh, like they, the, the landfills are, are just like filling up with stuff
--

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- and I think that if, if they were to recycle, if I were to, I guess if,
if there was like some kind of a program, I would do it becau-, just so it w-,
could save the space in those things.

B.24:  Yeah, well, uh, it's kind of funny, I saw, uh, a special on a public,
public broadcasting station down here and, uh, they were talking about
recycling and they, they, uh, I, I forgot exactly where this was, but they
were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that, uh, was at a
recycling center, but it was costing them, uh, about forty dollars a ton to
recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it.

A.25:  #Yeah [laughter].#  

B.26:  #So, [laughter]# so, you know, there was just, uh, no, nothing in it for
them.

A.27:  I -- 

B.28:  And,  

A.29:  -- I was, I, I don't know, what I was in, when I, I s-, last year I went to
a class and, and, uh, we would, we, they, they brought it this guy that, uh,
that made, let's see, he made, he made a lot of money working because like in,
in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New
Hampshire, they put in this bottle bill.  Do you have a bottle bill down
there?

B.30:  I'm not sure.  I,

A.31:  That's where it's like every, ev-, every, every can is stamped with like a,
a nickel return on it --

B.32:  Oh. 

A.33:  -- and it's like you, you have to, like if you can turn the can in to, to
any store --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- and they have to pay you a nickel for it, but what happens is that then
all these cans come running, you know, some stores get more cans --

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  -- than they sell and they have a big problem with that --

B.38:  Yeah {faint}.

A.39:  -- but, the law says that if they sell, they have to collect.

B.40:  Yeah.   

A.41:  But, anyway, this guy, like all the, like the beer distributors were having
like the biggest problem and, uh --

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- he, he, he actually, like made a business that just went around from
like distributor to distributor --

B.44:  Uh.  

A.45:  -- collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the
aluminum cans --

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- they, they could make money on, because aluminum can be, they can just
throw that back into the pot --

B.48:  Right.  

A.49:  -- and that just gets melted back up, and that's not a problem.  But, uh,
like the plastic ones you s-, like you were saying, they, they lost like big
money on, because they can't rec-, they can't reuse the, some plastics can be
reused, but most plastics can't be remelded {mispronounced}, remolded or mel-,
melted into, into other things.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  And it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth.  

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  But, I don't know, I wonder, you know, should, should they be making things
that, like, just can't be reused.

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  Uh, it kind of, I, I don't, I don't, and, well, should I be buying things
that can't be reused.

B.56:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, uh, uh, something I think about a lot, too, is, you
know, when you're buying, everything is, you know, if it's not convenient,
people don't want it.

A.57:  I,

B.58:  And usually convenience means waste [laughter].  

A.59:  Yeah, well, you know [cough] I, I can't, something I can't figure out is
that, d-, you ev-, d-, you ev-, did you ever see those big old Coke bottles,
you know, the glass ones that were --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- like they were kind of green.  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  At, at what point in time did it get to be, at what, you know, I didn't, I
thought they were great --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- but at what point in time did it get to be worse,
