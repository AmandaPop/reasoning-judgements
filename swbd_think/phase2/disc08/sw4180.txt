============================================================================

A.1:  So, how do you feel about the taxes you pay.  Do you feel you pay, uh, too
much, or --

@B.2:  #Well# -- 

A.3:  -- #about# right or,

B.4:  -- it, it, it's the type of thing of what exactly am I getting out of the
taxes --

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  -- and to some extent there is definitely, you know, you can say, all
right, I'm paying this money for this, and this is what I'm getting back in
terms of roads and highways and, you know, I guess quote, unquote retirement
if it's actually there when we actually,

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  #end up retiring.#  

A.9:  #Yeah, it's hard to# tell.  

B.10:  Th-, there seems to be some prob-, you know, some question on whether there
will be actually money there --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- or not.  What I don't like about the taxes is, I was looking through the
I R S forms, like, uh, the other day --

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- I noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in
for taxes each year --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- is just going to pay the national debt.

A.17:  Now, is that the debt, (( )) {mumbling}, is that just the interest --

B.18:  That -- 

A.19:  -- on the debt?  

B.20:  -- that is the interest on the debt.  

A.21:  Yes, you know, I really don't understand this completely.  I've been a
little mystified.  Who, who are we paying it to?

B.22:  Ourselves.  

A.23:  Okay.  

B.24:  Uh, to a large extent, I mean one of the, I think, I'm not sure if it's the
largest, but I know a large segment of the national debt is, uh, you know,
things like savings bonds and other government obligations.

A.25:  Okay, so it's to private individuals who own government instruments of some
sort?

B.26:  Well, not, not just private, but there's, you know, lot of public
institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of, uh, foreign companies
and foreign persons --

A.27:  Uh-huh.   

B.28:  -- that, holding that.  

A.29:  Okay -- 

B.30:  But,

A.31:  -- so, but these, but these are non governmental entities.  

B.32:  Yeah, non governmental.  

A.33:  Okay, who are holding bonds and whatever.  

B.34:  Yeah, you know, Treasury Certificates and U S Savings Bonds and whatever.

A.35:  Okay.  Yeah, that is, uh, I mean, well, what, what can they, I mean, what's
to be done at this point, increase that amount for some time so it will
eventually go down or, I mean, I imagine if you're just servicing the debt,
you're not really making any progress, right.

B.36:  Right.  Well, it's actually, uh, you know, also looking at the same form,
they had that we are bor-, the U S is borrowing eighteen percent of the
amount of, of h-, h-, of whatever it's spending every year.

A.37:  So we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the
annual budget.

B.38:  Yeah, so we're borrowing eighteen percent, and fourteen percent of what
we're paying out is going to pay the eight, the, uh, debt.

A.39:  So,   

B.40:  So, so we're borrowing money to pay, you know, fourteen percent that we're
borrowing goes directly, paying out to the debt.

A.41:  Which is only increasing.  

B.42:  Yeah, so we're, you know, net, we're doing a net borrowing of four percent
each year, and then we're doing a, borrowing on top of that a fourteen percent
that just goes to pay interest on the debt.

A.43:  Right.  And, uh, then the question, I mean, do other countries do this or
this a distinctly American phenomenon?

B.44:  That, I don't know, I don't know if, uh, other countries work as a deficit
or not.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  D-, I, from what I can understand, it's only recent, within maybe the last
fifty years or so, you know, except for wartimes that --

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- the U S has had a peacetime debt.

A.49:  Well, and I guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big
wartime debt.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  And they just, seemed like such a good idea, why stop [laughter].

B.52:  Yeah, I, I think if you look at some of the, uh, government spending
curves, uh, you know, the, the curve always went up around wartime and then
dropped back down.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  After World War Two it never dropped back down.  Or it was w-, World War
Two or, uh, Korea, I think.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  It never dropped back down.  

A.57:  So, what do you think is the, uh, you know, if you were in charge, what
would you, what parts would you change to fix this problem?

B.58:  Well, you know, definitely one thing is to say, hey, we have a year to year
balanced budget.

A.59:  So at least we wouldn't have that additional, uh, what was it, eighteen
percent or, 

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  Yeah. 

B.62:  So, you know, ((you know)), maybe raise taxes for a few years until that
debt gets paid off --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- and then say, you know, unless there is a tremendously bad circumstances
like a war or something, we should not be running a deficit economy.  You
know, it's --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- I mean, if you look on the individual level, if I were to borrow
eighteen percent of what I was spending every year,

A.67:  [Laughter]. 

B.68:  year after year, I would very quickly get in trouble with creditors.

A.69:  Well, it does seem like the, uh, the quality of the bonds that, you know,
it's, they sell, would eventually be downgraded, doesn't it?

B.70:  Uh, yeah, well, that's, you know, the post wartime Germany, they just kept
printing up money --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- and, you know, became worthless.  

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  So that's one danger.  

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  But, you know, it's, that, that's a very large chunk of the money we pay in
for taxes each year.

A.77:  It is shocking, but apparently no one's willing to, oh, not no one, but by
the time it all ends up in Congress seems,
