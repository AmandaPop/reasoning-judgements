========================================================================

A.1:  I guess that starts it.  Uh,

B.2:  Go on.  Good.

@A.3:  So, uh, I guess right now, what's most important for me, uh, doing, given
it's come up is we have a real good stock program, uh, where I work and it's
going to give me about a three hundred percent return this time around on my
uh, investment.

B.4:  Good.

A.5:  Which is definitely helping since I am going to buy a house.

B.6:  Is what do they, do they give you stock in the company you work for?

A.7:  Yeah, what they do, what they do is it's it's a purchase program where you
get stock.  It's on a one year cycle.  And you get it at eighty-five percent of
the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year.  So like the set
price at the beginning of the year, last May was five sixty-four a share --

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  -- stocks trading about fourteen now.

B.10:  Wow.

A.11:  So, and you so get to buy it at five sixty-four and turn around in same the
same day [talking].  The only down side to it, is they do it as a withholding
off your, uh income, so you got kind of, you know, be willing to squirrel it
away at whatever you want to do.

B.12:  Yes.  Yes.  It sounds good.

A.13:  Yeah. 

B.14:  What company is that?

A.15:  Yeah.  That's with Interleaf.

B.16:  Excuse me?

A.17:  Interleaf.

B.18:  Interleaf.  Never heard of it.

A.19:  Uh, desktop publishing.

B.20:  Huh.  Okay.

A.21:  Thought but, uh, you know,

B.22:  Yeah, what are you suppose to do, is that's it's benefits besides salary?
Is that the,

A.23:  Yeah, benefits other than salary.

B.24:  Yeah.  I get a, I get a pretty good.  I work for the City of New York.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And I get a pretty good, uh, health plan #and,# 

A.27:  #Yeah that# that's definitely a good thing to have, especially these days.

B.28:  Yeah, the health plan is pretty good and, and we get, uh, they also have a
deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you are talking about.
Where they will, they'll take out money tax free from your income --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- and invest it and it's a group investment.  So you, I think you also
save fees.

A.31:  Wha-, wha-, what's that, like, a, uh, like a key craft type thing?

B.32:  It's like a four o one k plan, #except they don't, they don't# --

A.33:  #Okay. Yeah, it's like, (( )) no, no.#

B.34:  -- contribute.

A.35:  So it's for retirement.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  Yeah, so you have to wait until like around fifty-five or,

B.38:  Yeah, I think, I think you can take out the money any time you want, but
you'll pay, you'll pay taxes on it and you are better off waiting until you
retire --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- when you are probably going to have less income or some something like
that.

A.41:  Yeah, we, we've got a four o one k here but, uh, I chose to go in the per
stock program because you can't lose on it and you know, I can always take the
money off of that.  If I wasn't saving for the house, I would be putting money
into a four o one k, but you know, I had much rather [laughter] get the eight,
eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house.

B.42:  Yeah.  Uh,

A.43:  But yeah.  You know, medical is good.  You know, we get a good program here
what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month.

B.44:  Wow.  That's that's really good.

A.45:  It's like your, yeah, it is.  It's a very good company as far as benefits
go.  They've got four o one k's.  They've got, uh, the health coverage, they've
got, you know, the stock program, they've got, uh, one twenty-five k, selling
it for twenty bucks.  They do put in the de-, you know, dental is like you
know, eighty or fifty percent depending on what you are doing.

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  Uh, and you know, the one twenty-five k, they can pay that to you as pre
tax money rather than post tax [talking].  The only problem with the one
twenty-five k is you've got to say at the beginning of the year I think
[talking] I am going to have a thousand dollars expenses this year and then
you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you
don't use the thousand dollars it goes away.

B.48:  If you own, okay I see.

A.49:  So, at the end of the year, if you haven't used it all up, it's you know,
the feds take it or whoever takes it.  It just disappears.  But you know, if,
if you know, you know, so you want to under estimate a little bit --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- so you know, I know I usually have a thousand dollars, five hundred
dollars a year of dental and mis-, miscellaneous medical and deductibles, so I
just have them pull five hundred.  It means I pay like, you know, as opposed
to paying like you know, eight hundred dollars, I pay five hundred, I pay like
three hundred cause it's on pre tax.

B.52:  Hello.

A.53:  Yeah, I am here.

B.54:  Yeah it, uh, it was a width away.  That's why it's, it's every time I talk
it sounds weird but, uh, yeah, there's other benefits too.  None economic, I
mean there's, uh, there's benefit just in working for a big organization.  I
think in, in that you have a lot of different people doing a lot of different
things --

A.55:  Yeah, I think --

B.56:  -- and,

A.57:  -- it depends on how flat the organization is.  If [talking] you know, hand
on, my computer is talking to me, uh, you know, it depends how flat it is.  If
it's, uh, I don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in
the tree, cause then you start to feel like you've got no real, you know,
power to change anything.

B.58:  Right.  Well that's, working for the City is somewhat like that, except for
my unit.  You know, I have control over what goes on in my unit --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- and just that.  Uh, but what I mean is I, I, say for instance I am an
attorney, uh, a collection attorney for the City of New York and --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and in the environmental control board and I, I've learned so much about
computer systems and sharing of information.  All these managerial type things
that I never thought I would be involved with and if I was in private practice
I would never be able to learn all that stuff.

A.63:  Yeah, but there's two facts that I think is also, you know, I've seen a lot
of, I knew somebody that worked for Digital and for two years he worked on
like, you know, the tape driver for one tape driver and that's all he did,
