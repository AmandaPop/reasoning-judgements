REMARKS:        Speakers interrupted and talked over each other a
lot.  Speaker A was hard to understand, sounded like she was eating
during the conversation.  Also Speaker A had a television on.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Well, we just had a, uh, family reunion last summer -- 

A.2:  #Oh, did you?#  

B.3:  -- #as it# turns out and, uh, the way it usually works is my father's
father, all of his children, which is all my aunts and uncles, uh, have
traditionally had this rotating schedule sort of thing.

A.4:  Uh-huh.  

B.5:  And, uh, would go to one of the brothers and sisters or my aunts and uncles
or my father and they would plan it and go somewhere exotic and invite all the
cousins.  So that's kind of the framework that we've been working under.

A.6:  Uh-huh.  Well, ours is similar to that, al-, it does not fall on anybody
[laughter] in particular.  Uh, course, back when my grandparents were alive
they always did it.

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  And then it seems like our parents kind of let it slide, so cou-, myself
and my cousins have started taking this up recently and we've had one, oh, a
few years ago and what we did was, uh, [breathing] since we didn't, weren't
sure of all the addresses and what have you, that we started sending out
flyers a year beforehand and, uh,

B.9:  So, a pretty big adventure there.

A.10:  Yes, you know, trying to see who knew where who [laughter] else lived and
what have you and also gave them a little questionnaire to fill out as to what
would be the most convenient time.  We gave them a couple of choices there,
uh, time and place, whether they would like to go back to our, quote, old
hometown, or someplace in between [laughter] for all --

B.11:  So --  

A.12:  -- of us.  

B.13:  -- so how many generations were you trying to round up?  Was this just like
from your grandparents on down or --

A.14:  Yes, uh-huh.  

B.15:  -- we you trying to get second and third cousins and,

A.16:  Yes, just, you know, anybody that was in the family, mostly cousins, second
cousins and what have you and their families and, anybody that, you know,
wanted to.  We wound up going to, uh, since I was, I was born in Arkansas and
that's what we considered our hometown.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  We wound up going to Biloxi, Mississippi and we, uh, course, called ahead
and got reservations for everyone and, uh, it turned out real well because the
children, it had a swimming pool and what have you and it gave us a chance to
get reacquainted without all the burden falling on somebody else.

B.19:  That sounds like a good way to do it because what happens with, with our
system is, you know, the, the family who's turns it comes and, and they come
every, ((now)), let's see, every two years --

A.20:  Uh-huh.  

B.21:  -- every three years, something like that, uh [laughter] generally finds
themselves really doing a lot of organization, you know, they, wherever they
decide to go, they're responsible for deciding what games, ((that are)) going
to be played and what the --

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  -- and who's going to bring what and, they don't bring everything, but just
making the assignments and everything turns out to be kind of a chore.

A.24:  Yes, it, I,

B.25:  And, uh,

A.26:  [Noise]. 

B.27:  was my family's shot just this last summer and, uh, my sister ended up
doing most of the work and, uh, we've decided, all the, all the, my brothers
and sisters are pretty much grown up now, we're all married, we all have our
own kids.

A.28:  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  And it's kind of looking like this business of getting all the other
cousins, my cousins --

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  -- together is just not really working out so well.  

A.32:  Uh-huh, well that could be.  

B.33:  Because my children are, are now have cousins of their own that they'd
rather get with and, and so --

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  -- I think what's going to happen in the future is it will be from my
father on down and, and all of his descendants --

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  -- and tho-, those cousins so we're, we're kind of dissipating as we get
bigger and bigger here.

A.38:  Well, we have a pretty small family anyway.

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  So, uh, ((we're only sixth two)), you know, with our cousins --

B.41:  Yeah.  

A.42:  -- and, so forth and like my children have no cousins [laughter], no first
cousins.

B.43:  ((Well, that's kind of bad)).

A.44:  So, i-, it's --

B.45:  That's,  

A.46:  -- like I say, our family's dwindling [laughter] here.  

B.47:  Yeah, well my dad's one of about eight children and I'm one of nine and,
uh, all of my aunts and uncles all have lots of kids, so we had lots of
cousins.  By the time you get all of them and their kids together it's --

A.48:  Oh, I bet.  

B.49:  -- it's a #big undertaking.#

A.50:  #[Laughter].# 

B.51:  You know, we have to find a, a substantially large place just to get
everything set up.

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  And, uh, what we did this last summer is my sister used to work for, uh,
[lipsmack] uh [breathing], kind of a, a canyon retreat for, uh --

A.54:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.55:  -- uh, disabled children.  

A.56:  Uh-huh.  

B.57:  And, uh, since she was an employee, she knew what the schedule was and knew
when it would be free, signed up and, and reserved and paid for the place, so,
so we could all show up and it was nice, you know, there were several cabins
there, swimming pool and horses and all that --

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  -- and it, and we filled the place up.  

A.60:  Yeah, well, that's, that's good.  That's, like I say, it, uh, we
[breathing] have been talking about again, this one other cousin and I that
seem to want [laughter] to do this all the time [laughter] that, uh, we've
been talking about getting together for another one because it has been quite
a few years now.  And we'll probably go the same route that we did before --

B.61:  Back,  

A.62:  -- because we had a good response.  

B.63:  Back to Mississippi?  

A.64:  Well, I don't know, we're going give them another choice [laughter].
