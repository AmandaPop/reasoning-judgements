B.1:  (( )) about what, nursing homes.

@A.2:  Well, [throat_clearing] my parents were both in them --

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  -- and my father-in-law, and it's a tough decision to make --

B.5:  Yeah.

A.6:  -- because boy, it really confines the, uh, the people --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and, uh, usually they don't care for it, [throat_clearing] and kind of
put you on a guilt trip.

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  But, uh, have you had any experience with them?

B.11:  Well, uh, this, my grandmother in fact, uh, has a personal care home, and
she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home --

A.12:  Yeah.

B.13:  -- and, uh, I live, I live with her, and so, uh, it's, it's, uh, my mother
also does the same thing, and, uh, it's, uh, I think the quality of care they
get is a lot better, uh --

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  -- and a lot more personal, but, uh.

A.16:  But it's still, still not like home [throat_clearing].  

B.17:  No, but, uh, I think it's, uh, quite a bit better than, than a nursing
home.

A.18:  Right.

B.19:  I, I've just seen people just go down hill when they, uh, go into a nursing
home.

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  That seems to be, uh.

A.22:  But, uh, you know, and it's hard to really know what kind of a home is run
--

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  -- unless you really know someone that's in there.

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  And [throat_clearing] you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt,
too --

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  -- that, uh, [throat_clearing], you know, they may say it's real bad, uh,
just because they don't like it in there [chiming] --

B.29:  Yeah.

A.30:  -- whereas it's, you know, usually pretty good.  [chiming] Uh,
[throat_clearing] uh, the one my father-in-law was in had, uh, oh God,
entertainment every afternoon --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- of some so-, you know, bingo or cards or whatever.

B.33:  Well, that's good.

A.34:  Yeah.  And, uh, and it's easy to check out the meals.  You know, just go up
there during, uh, meal time, if you can stand it --

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  -- because they don't eat that too well.

B.37:  Yeah.

A.38:  [Inhaling] And, uh, [breathing] go, uh, you always have to check it for
cleanliness, too.

B.39:  I'm sorry, what was that?

A.40:  Well, you have to make sure they're clean.

B.41:  Oh, yeah.

A.42:  And they just had a incident in, uh, Dallas, here --

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  -- where the guy's suing the nursing home.  He came in at ten in the
morning, check on his mom --

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  -- and she was sick, and, uh, went up to the front desk and said, what's
wrong with my mom, and they said, well, is she sick, we didn't know that, and
here, she died two hours later.

B.47:  Uh-oh.

A.48:  Yeah.  So, you know, and [throat_clearing] there's an awful lot of
variables in them.

B.49:  Yeah, yeah, I've seen some good ones, and, uh, I've seen some, uh, my other
grandmother was in one, and it was, I guess they, it wasn't too bad, but she,
uh, she was a good way away from her family, and, uh, kind of by herself
there, and it was, it, I didn't really like going there at all.  It was,
[inhaling], it was not a pleasant experience, but, uh, I think there're some
good ones out there --

A.50:  Oh.

B.51:  -- this one here in Atlanta they're closing down, it's apparently a shaky
business right now.

A.52:  Well, I think Medicare and Medicaid payments are, uh, kind of tightening up
on it.

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  But, uh, you know, in some of them, some of them tries so hard, but caring
for an elderly person who might be forgetful --

B.55:  Yeah.

A.56:  -- is ever ending.

B.57:  Yeah, it is.  

A.58:  [Throat_clearing].

B.59:  One of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently showing some signs of
Alzheimer's, and, uh, she'll, my grandmother will put her to bed, and, uh,
she'll get up, you know, anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the
bedroom is and, you know, that kind of thing (( )),

A.60:  Well, it's around the clock care.  

B.61:  Yeah, it, uh, it takes a lot of patience.

A.62:  Yeah, an awful lot.

B.63:  And, uh, but.

A.64:  And, and gentleness, too.

B.65:  Yeah, she [laughter], she's, she's pretty good with them, though, she does
a real good job, and, uh, I, you know, I would, I would probably throw up my
hands and quit, but she just, you know, turn around, put her, put her back to
bed --

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- you know, which is good.  So, I hope I can provide that kind of care for
my grandmother, you know.  She's still going pretty strong, but, uh, I, I
don't think I would want to turn her over to a nursing home.  I'd like to be
in a, I think that's the position of a lot of people, but they can't afford
it, you know.

A.68:  Costs a bunch.  My mother-in-law is, uh, eighty-two, and we'd probably put
her in the same home that,
