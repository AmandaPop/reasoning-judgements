==============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, what do you think?

B.2:  Well, it depends on whether I have to buy my next car before or after my
children are out of the house [laughter].

A.3:  Well that makes a big difference doesn't it [laughter].

B.4:  #We# --

A.5:  #It's kind# of like well if,

B.6:  -- we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van
--

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- mini van.

A.9:  A little more domestic there.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Yeah, I, I guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non
American and while I would really like to buy American.  I don't know.  It
just, it really depends [children_talking] on reliability for me --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- uh, I have a Ford right now [children_talking] and it's been a pretty
good truck, but some of the things are not [children_yelling] that good about
it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms [children_yelling] of, uh
customer service, at least for me, [children_yelling] so it's, I don't know.
It's kind of disappointing but,

B.14:  [Inhaling] Wel-, well, we, I guess this is talking about previous cars as
opposed to [children_yelling] to the next car, but when we went to look for a
mini van, I wanted to get, you know, --

A.15:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.16:  -- I thought it would be nice to buy American and I went and looked at all
the American ones --

A.17:  Yeah [laughter].

B.18: --  and the doors didn't close right and the, I mean and this is on the lot
and you're think to your self [laughter] if it's not right now, what's it
going to be like after I've had it for six months.

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  [Inhaling] #So,#

A.21:  #Well one# I guess one of the good things that I have to work on is my, my
father --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- he's a pharmaceutical rep [children_talking] and he, he gets a new car
about once [children_yelling] every three years --

B.24:  Uh-huh [children_yelling].

A.25:  -- and he's been driving [children_yelling] a lot of mini vans in the last
like five or ten years --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- and, uh, he generally goes with, I think, the Astro Van --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- uh, it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real
important to him, but [children_talking] I don't know.  I guess, I guess for
my next car I'd probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick
up.  I'm starting to get into that.  I'm a college student right now --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- I'm a doctoral student and, uh, I anticipate getting a full time job
soon so [laughter].  You know, probably one of those things where I really
don't need the [children_talking] hauling capacity much.  [child_crying] I
will be a little more stable but,

B.32:  [Child_talking]  Yeah.

A.33:  I guess.  I don't know.  I'm, I think I will probably buy American but I'm
just not real sure --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- you know.

B.36:  Well, uh, [smack] I know, I've always looked for mileage --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- uh, you know, cause I figure the better miles it gets the better
[child_talking], but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job
it's doing --

A.39:  #Sure and it,# 

B.40:  -- #burning stuff out.#

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Uh,

A.43:  And that opens up a whole another can of worms.  [noise] I guess Ford is
suppose to start up, [children_talking] they are going to actually put out a
line of electric cars next year in California.

B.44:  Wow.  Doesn't that sound neat.

A.45:  You know,

B.46:  #If you were going to# --

A.47:  #Yeah.#

B.48:  -- if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city
driving [children_talking].

A.49:  Uh-huh.  Oh that would be a definite [children_talking].  Yeah, that would
be the way to go for sure.  I think [child_talking] there's no questions in, in
terms of whether I would have that or not.

B.50:  [Child_talking]  Get away away from here {talking to child}.

A.51:  Sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation.

B.52:  [Child_talking] Just a minute.  David, remove Jeffrey from my presence.  I
am on the telephone {talking to someone in room} [sniffing].

A.53:  [Laughter] I bet they would have something to say about buying cars, huh?

B.54:  Well, well my kids, oh my kids think it's great.  We, I fortunately our
convertibles have been retired for lack of time on our part to, uh, [smack] to
work on them --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- but we have an old Fiat and an old M G B --

A.57:  Oh, really.

B.58:  -- sitting in, behind our house and the kids are convinced, the older two
kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars.

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  Jeffrey hasn't figured out yet, you know, it's like #who want# --

A.61:  #How old are they?#

B.62:  -- oh Jeffrey's only three, you know, --

A.63:  Oh, I see.

B.64:  -- but the other ones aren't very old either.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  [Inhaling] So it's like who's going to inherit, you know, Jeff is like --

A.67:  Right [throat_clearing].

B.68:  -- well, you know, [noise] a station wagon and a mini van [laughter] you
know --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- you got to go get another old convertible.  My hu-, well my husband
would love to buy next is a Miata.

A.71:  Oh yeah.

B.72:  Yeah, is a Mazda Miata.

A.73:  Yeah, I've heard some good things about that car #actually.#

B.74:  #It's suppose# to be really solid.

A.75:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.76:  We have a Mazda right now.

A.77:  Yeah.  A big factor for me is is ergonomics and, and --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- in terms of control and display design.  That's what I am going into for
my degree --

B.80:  Oh neat.

A.81:  -- and so that, that's something I really try to consider a little more
heavily, heavily more than most people probably do but,

B.82:  Well, it's they have something that's, you know, I there's some things I
like better about my Subaru and some things I like better about
[child_talking] the Mazda --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- uh, you know I am always looking at that kind of thing and other people
cars, 

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  It's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately.  You know, it seems
like everyone that's a big concern now, you know [laughter].

B.88:  Well, it's not just, you now, but like I have one car that tells me which
door is open --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- and the other one only tells me that a door is open --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- so when it only tells me that a door is open, I have to get out of the
car and go around slamming doors until,

A.93:  [Laughter].

B.94:  and that's a nuisance, that's are real pain --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- yeah and one of them only has the standard full to empty gauge and the
other,
