===========================================================================

A.1:  To, uh, trial by jury and whether it works or not is,

@B.2:  Hey, I like the current system.  

A.3:  Yeah, I expect it's, uh, about as good as one can expect.  Uh, I suppose
you get an illogical verdict now and then, but, uh,

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  The,  

B.6:  I figure the answer to that is to educate the consumers or the, uh,

A.7:  The jurors, you mean, the people.  

B.8:  Right.  

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Just,  

A.11:  I just got called to my first jury duty.  Uh, I never been on a jury.  How
about you?

B.12:  Hey, two weeks ago, first time I was ever called.  

A.13:  And were, did you, did you show up and do it or whatever it was?

B.14:  Oh, yeah, I showed up, but, uh, the case settled before they could,
uh, make us, uh, actually listen to anything so I have no idea what the case
was about or, uh, I mean I didn't get to do anything.

A.15:  My brother was on some real complex business case where they were, uh,
dec-, asked to decide the exact amount to the penny of fraud in some credit
card case, you know --

B.16:  Wait, so -- 

A.17:  -- for,   

B.18:  -- the jury had to, like, go over ledgers and financial records and,

A.19:  Well, they went over it in the trial, but they didn't give the stuff to the
jury afterward.  It was really bizarre, uh,

B.20:  Wait a second, don't, don't they have to enter that in as evidence and
can't the jury request any piece of it?

A.21:  Yeah, but they have to ask for it and then the, the bailiff brings it and
they can look at it, then the bailiff takes it away again.  It's not like they
can just spread it out in their jury room and then, you know, get out a bunch
of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up.  It was,

B.22:  Right, the, the jurors request an I B M three seventy [laughter].

A.23:  Yeah, right, would you give me an I, I, I D M S system or something like
that?

B.24:  [Laughter]. 

A.25:  [Laughter] Dear judge, you know it was, it was a very peculiar case.  I
guess that one was, didn't work very well, uh, uh, but,

B.26:  Well, that, I'm not sure that's the jury's fault.  

A.27:  No, no I don't think so, either.  Uh,

B.28:  But, I don't know what else they could have done.  

A.29:  Yeah, yeah, uh, I guess, I guess nothing else, but, uh,

B.30:  T I suggests just giving it to the judge, but, uh,

A.31:  Well, for sentencing, I don't know, does that make any sense, I mean,
depends on, I, I don't know what the offense is, I guess that's why we have
juries just to take each case on a case by case basis and that's fine.
Anyway, uh,

B.32:  No, I mean the jury, there's problems with it as far as finding jurors, as
far as weird verdicts, as far as just the ti-, the timing, you know, it takes
a lot of time.  But, uh, you know, I like it because I think, you don't have
the abuse, or it's a sort of a check.  If you have one guy doing something, he
can sort of go out of control and it's a long time before it gets reigned in
--

A.33:  #Yeah, or# -- 

B.34:  -- #and he can do# -- 

A.35:  -- s-, #an organizational# --

B.36:  -- #a lot of damage.#  

A.37:  -- problem, you know, where, where, you know, the, you know, it's possible
to imagine a corrupt judicial system where, you know, all the judges are, are
part of the system.  I guess that happened --

B.38:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.39:  -- in Chicago once so,

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  Or just even one guy, just before you get a chance to, uh, you know, to,
uh, purge him he could do a lot of damage.

A.43:  Yeah, yeah I guess they do anyway, I guess.  The only trouble with the jury
system I see is it's really da-, darned expensive and, and, you know, time
consuming and, you know, and, and all these systems of where you can like ask
the jury, ask each juror what they think about something, then kick them out.
You know, I guess they get manipulated a little.

B.44:  You know, maybe some of the, uh, like the hype needs to be cut out, but you
mention expense.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  I think you get what you pay for.  

A.47:  Yeah, it's true.  

B.48:  You know, if you want a cheap legal system, you're going to get that kind
of K Mart service, or, uh, well, K Mart's not all that bad.

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  There's got to be some sort of cheap, what's the epitome of cheap these
days?

A.51:  Beats me, uh, yeah, in Massachusetts, it's the judicial system.

B.52:  [Laughter]. 

A.53:  They're buildings are all falling down [laughter].  

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  Well, I guess that gets them a sample.  Good night, sir.  

B.56:  All right,

A.57:  Take is eas-,    

B.58:   Good luck,
