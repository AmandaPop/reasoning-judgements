============================================================================

A.1:  So do you work for an employer who, uh, gives you health benefits?

B.2:  Yeah, we get, uh, I have, I have good health benefits actually.

@A.3:  Oh, yeah?  

B.4:  Yeah, I have, uh, all of them and they're, cheap per month and they, I get
to pick my own doctor and --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- they have really good benefits.  

A.7:  uh, uh, do you have any, any interesting benefits aside from basic health
coverage?

B.8:  Besides bas-, uh, no, I have, uh, some, a little bit of, uh, life insurance
benefits.

A.9:  Uh, do, uh, do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage? 

B.10:  Uh, no the, the, uh, no optical.  The dental is fully covered.  Uh --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- except, unless it's major.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  But anything minor or checkups, that's all covered.  

A.15:  And, uh, is your whole family covered or do,

B.16:  No, that's just me, but they can be, I have that option, but it's more
money.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  But, they're not, they have their own.  

A.19:  I see, so through your husband or,

B.20:  Oh, no, me, I'm single.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  It's just through me.  

A.23:  Oh, I see.  

B.24:  It's, it's, uh, so it's, and that makes it cheaper too, since I'm single.

A.25:  Okay, d-, but do you have children?  

B.26:  No, no.  

A.27:  Oh, okay, so that's real simple.  

B.28:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.29:  Yeah, here, uh,

B.30:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.31:  it's just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a
little extra.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  But not much.  

B.34:  Not much.  

A.35:  Uh-uh.  

B.36:  Not for the good, but it's really good, the benefits are good. 

A.37:  Yeah, I think it's pretty significant benefit.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  Uh, it really, uh, makes you want to stick around [laughter]. 

B.40:  Yeah, yeah, they have, they, uh, it does [laughter].  

A.41:  [Laughter] Especially with what I hear about -- 

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- uh, people who are individually insured -- 

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- you know, once you get sick you can be booted right out.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  Uh, which seems kind of unfair.  Uh,

B.48:  Do, do you work where you have benefits like that?  

A.49:  Yeah, yeah, we have, we can choose, uh, a couple different plans.  They
made, they try to make it real flexible where if you don't use much, you
actually get cash back.

B.50:  Oh, really?   

A.51:  Uh, you can choose all these different plans some of which pay, you know,
everything and some of which pay very little.  Uh, you can also choose an H M
O.  Uh, 

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  I used to have that when I was single I w-, I found it very convenient.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  Uh, and we have some optical and dental coverage that's, I guess it's
optional.

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  I think we can get one pair of glasses a year.  

B.58:  Really?  Well, that's good.  

A.59:  That's, so, yeah, it's pretty good actually.  Uh, I think a, anything under
a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year, but if you want
something really fancy, you pay the difference.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  See, that's, see, I wear glasses, not all the time, but when I
read and stuff --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- and, uh, I wish we had some kind of optical coverage.  But there's --

A.63:  Yeah, it's nice.  

B.64:  -- there's none whatsoever and it can get expensive.  
 
A.65: Yeah, it can.  Uh, at least it's not like medical where it can really go
through the roof.

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  You know, at least, somewhat limited.  Uh, let's, you have any kind of, uh,
child care benefits or --

B.68:  Uh, yeah -- 

A.69:  -- any,

B.70:  -- for the, uh, actually if you're, I believe, I, I read up on some of it,
if you're pregnant --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- they have really, really good coverage.  They have, uh, like well baby
care.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  It's, it's pretty much covered.  

A.75:  That's a problem sometimes I understand -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- when baby's not sick, but, you know, you have these periodic
appointments and,

B.78:  Especially when they're younger.  

A.79:  Yeah, the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment --

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  -- to cover the, uh, the appointment even though there's not really one.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  Yeah, some think it's more honest.  

B.84:  And the, and the pregnant mother has, uh, full coverage for well mother
care.

A.85:  Uh-huh, that's good.  That's good, and d-, is there any kind of
interesting, uh, w-, I mean, what happens after the baby's born, is there
some, uh, some maternity leave policy?

B.86:  Uh, that's what I was trying to, I think there is, I don't really remember
how long it is --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get
adjusted I guess.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  And, uh, most of the benefits are pretty good.  The hospital benefits and,
and they let you pick your own doctor.  You have your choice actually.  If,
uh, it's better, they give you a list --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- and if, and if your doctor's on that list, then most of your benefits
are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance
company.

A.93:  I see, so, they, they're preferred providers.  

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  Or is that,

B.96:  But you can have your own doctor.  

A.97:  Right, and you pay a little more or -- 

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  -- certain things aren't as well covered, but at least you -- 

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  -- have that option.  

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  That's nice, because once in a while you find someone who deals
specifically with, you know, what you have or --

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  -- or s-, just somebody you've dealt with already.  

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  It,

B.108:  And, and a lot of times, because we just switched, my comp-, my, uh,
company just switched insurance --

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  -- companies and before [throat_clearing], we didn't have that choice.

A.111:  Uh-huh.
