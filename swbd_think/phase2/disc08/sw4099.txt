==============================================================================

A.1:  Kay.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  I guess we're talking about exercise, huh?

B.4:  Yeah, yeah.  Well first of all I, I ha-, have to ask you how, how old you
are?

@A.5:  Oh, I am twenty-seven.

B.6:  Twenty-seven, okay.  Well, I am quite a bit older than you are [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  But, no.  I think exercise is extremely important and I I do exercise on a
regular basis.

A.9:  You do?  What type of exercise do you do?

B.10:  Well, I do, uh, jazzercise --

A.11:  Oh you do.

B.12:  -- which is an aerobic, uh, [smack] program that, are you familiar with it?

A.13:  Yes.

B.14:  It's, uh, you know, a national company and we have a jazzercise center here
in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can,

A.15:  Are they different from aerobics or is it the same thing?

B.16:  No it's really, it's an aerobic routine.  Yo-, you warm up and then you
have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, you know, slowly and then
working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate and then you gradually go down
again.

A.17:  And you do that every day or,

B.18:  No, I only do it [throat_clearing] probably two or three times a week.

A.19:  Oh, okay.

B.20:  The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.

A.21:  And this is a club or, uh, do you belong to a group?

B.22:  [Smack] Well, it's really a [smack] I mean [noise] it's called a center and
you buy as many classes as you want to [noise] at a time and then you just go
in whenever you can.  So, like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the
morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.

A.23:  Do you go with friends or do you go alone?

B.24:  [Smack] No, I go by myself and that's one of the frustrating things cause I
can find very few people to go with me --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise [laughter] or they
might play tennis --

A.27:  [Laughter]  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and since I am not a tennis player, uh, you know, I don't get that, but
I am, you know, I am between, I am in my late forties --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- so, uh, there aren't many people, you know, that want to do that.

A.31:  Oh {very faint}.

B.32:  Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers.  You know,
with with children between the ages,

A.33:  Oh yeah [laughter] young mothers or,

B.34:  Young mothers.  You know, young women,

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  with small children --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- are the ones that I find.  Well, what do you do?

A.39:  Uh, I really don't have a routine.  I like playing basketball.  We just
bought a new home with a basketball hoop and --

B.40:  Oh, great.

A.41:  -- that's what I do every day.

B.42:  Yeah.  Do you play every day?

A.43:  Yeah, pretty much.  When my wife let's me.

B.44:  Well, now who do you play with?  Do you have friends that play with you or
just, 

A.45:  No, I just shoot around by myself.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  And, uh, that's about it.  I use to play soccer a lot in high school, but
when I graduated I haven't done much.  I don't have a problem.  I know I have
to do more aerobics, but I don't have a problem with weight.  I could eat all
day and not gain an ounce [laughter].

B.48:  Well see, that's, that's th-, really good and I think that keeps a lot,
some people from exercising.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either, but I think I don't have
a problem because I exercise.

A.51:  You #do exercise.#

B.52:  #You know# I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin
[noise] and it's because I [noise] exercise --

A.53:  You do it [noise],

B.54:  -- but I also watch what I eat.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  You know, but you'll come, being twenty-seven, you don't really have to
worry about your heart rate and that yet --

A.57:  Yeah and I --

B.58:  -- but as you get older you will.

A.59:  -- well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these
days, but [noise] I don't know [laughter].

B.60:  Well, it might not [laughter].  

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  Mine, because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't
happened, you know, and I, I just feel like, you know, [noise] you have to
constantly [noise] weigh yourself --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it [talking] starts to get
you know, too high.

A.65:  Yeah, I guess I enjoy sports a lot so that's why I've kept active in that
way.

B.66:  Yeah.  But you don't play any other sports but basketball?

A.67:  Uh, basketball, volleyball, uh, too bad it's not [noise] really heavy as
far as recreation or hobby, I do that.

B.68:  But, do you ski?  Being in Utah, I was wondering #if you ski.#

A.69:  #Uh, I use# to, but it got too expensive, so.

B.70:  Oh did it really?

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  Cause I know that skiing in Utah is, is suppose to be [static] great.

A.73:  Yeah, a lot of people do that --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- and [noise] but, [noise] well I just {sounds like} I never find the
time. I had rather do other things.			           

B.76:  Yeah.  Well, I have never skied before, but I have friends that go to Utah
all the time #and they think it's really# --

A.77:  #Oh they come up here.#

B.78:  -- and they ski.  I guess there's a place where you can ski, well is it
Tahoe?  Where you ski from, no that's Nevada to #California# --

A.79:  #That's in Nevada.#

B.80:  -- I guess.  

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Yeah, I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line.

A.83:  Oh, yeah but,

B.84:  But there's a fun-, there is a place in Utah called a funny name.

A.85:  There's Snow Bird or Alta.

B.86:  But it's like, Oh, Heavenly.  Is that it?

A.87:  Heavenly?

B.88:  Yeah, I think it's called Heavenly.

A.89:  Huh.  I've never heard #of that one.#

B.90:  #You've never# heard of that?

A.91:  Huh-uh.

B.92:  Well, maybe it isn't in Utah.

A.93:  [Laughter].

B.94:  But they said they've skied Heavenly and [laughter] it sounded like,
[laughter] you know, that they skied really well, and when they are actually
talking about a place.  It's kind of funny.

A.95:  Do they exercise much or, I mean for skiing?  I know when I went, you can
get sore easily but,

B.96:  Oh yeah.  You can get really sore.  I know you, I mean I've talked to
people, but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore.

A.97:  Oh yeah.  (( )) is one or two timer a year if I do go on them and I am
really sore after.

B.98:  And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst?

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  In your legs and,

A.101:  My legs really, really ache.

B.102:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.103:  But, that's, [noise] I am using [noise] muscles that I have never used
before.

B.104:  Well, and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, you know, all
the time and then I went horseback riding and still I was so sore and I
couldn't get over,
