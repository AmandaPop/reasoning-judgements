==========================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, do you know what the laws in Texas are in regard to capital
punishment?

@B.2:  Um, I have to plead ignorant.  I really don't know.  I, I think that,
that, uh, I think Texas is for it [noise].  I don't think we have had any
#instances of it.#

A.3:  #I am sorry.#  Would you repeat that please?

B.4:  Pardon.

A.5:  I'm sorry, your just a little, the (( )) is a little quiet.

B.6:  Oh, okay.

A.7:  I just couldn't quite hear what you said.

B.8:  I'm sorry.  I said Texas is, is for capital punishment.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  I don't think we've had a case, uh, recently but --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- but it is.

A.13:  Yeah.  And, and I am, uh, I believe in California it is permitted, but for
a few years they were not doing, I don't think, I don't think there has been
execution for a while.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Uh, but I am a little ignorant of it myself.  I know that there is a
[throat_clearing] there was a state supreme court justice who was, uh, being
pounded on in the newspapers --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- because she was over turning, uh, convictions or she was somehow keeping
death penalties from being carried out.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, the newspapers were giving her a very hard time on that although I
always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on
her about.

B.20:  Yeah.  Could be.  Could be.  How do you feel about, #about# --

A.21:  #Well# --

B.22:  -- about the capital punishment?

A.23:  -- I don't, to me it seems unnecessary.  Uh, I think that the sort of
person who would be deterred by capital punishment would also be deterred by
life in prison.  Uh, and, uh, [throat_clearing] it seems just with the
possibility of making mistakes that, uh, I would rather opt for life in prison
where at least there's a chance [barking] that the person could, uh, either
change or perhaps [/barking] even [noise] you know contribute [barking] to
society from prison [noise] in some way.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Well, what do you feel about it?

B.26:  Well, uh, I probably [noise] tend to come down on the side of, of being for
it.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But, I, I think it's, it should be, uh, there should be more safe guards to
be sure that, that you, you know, no mistakes have been made.

A.29:  [Throat_clearing] #Right, it's, yeah.#

B.30:  #But then I,# I tend to, I tend to come down on the side that if, if the
laws were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it.

A.31:  Do you think it would be a deterrent?

B.32:  Well, obviously that person wouldn't do it again.

A.33:  Well, that is true. 

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  That's true.

B.36:  And it,

A.37:  Uh,

B.38:  But, I think that, like I said, if the laws that are already on, on the
books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- then I think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime.

A.41:  Oh, I see.  You are thinking that if the laws were enforced in general,
people would be [throat_clearing] maybe people would be stopped at doing
something before they got to the point of --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- of killing somebody.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  Uh,

B.46:  Because I think, I think too, too many of them walk, you know.

A.47:  Well, you know, I mean I think, I think I'm in agreement with you on this
point that hey there's a problem and the solution to the problem isn't whether
you kill people or not at the end.  It's what happens before that.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Uh, and I would say that, uh, you know, putting more, giving more attention
to child rearing, you know, as early as that in, in the terms of giving kids a
good education and, uh, sort of a good, uh, I don't know moral or self esteem
sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in
the first place --

B.50:  Um.

A.51:  -- could make it less necessary also.

B.52:  Well, that's true.  You have got to have the foundation there.

A.53:  Yeah, and that's, it, it seems like people, uh, focus more on one end of
the system where you're interested in someone or not rather than the other end
of the system where you are turning out a person who is likely to do something
like that or not.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  Uh, so I think that sort of goes along with what you're saying.  Uh, are
there certain, you know, I mean are there certain crimes or do you think there
are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not?  I
mean, clearly there are, but which ones do you think should be liable?

B.56:  Um.  Well, I think murder.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  Is number one.  Uh, I, I, tend to believe in an eye for an eye.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  You take a life then you need to lose yours.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  You know, not, not that you can bring the other person back --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and obviously can't.  But, I see no reason to, for you to continue, you
know --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and and possibly get out and do it again.  You know, there's too much
of, if you could put them away and then yo-, assure that they would stay there
--

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- you know.  Where they couldn't hurt anybody else --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- that would be one thing, but most of, of the, uh, murderers that go to
jail get,
