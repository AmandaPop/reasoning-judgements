===========================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, do you keep a monthly budget or anything #like that?# 

@B.2:  #Yeah.# 

A.3:  Oh, yeah?  

B.4:  I-, I'm one of those people who keep a record of everything. 

A.5:  Oh.  

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  So you, you keep record of all the checks you write?  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  And all the credit card?  

B.10:  And all the A T M transactions and --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- everything.  And I've got a file for each of them and,

A.13:  How do you categorize these things?  That's what always sort of stumped me
when I sat down to do it.

B.14:  #I,#

A.15:  #((Right.  Huh.))# 

B.16:  I have a file box, and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each
file, ther-, I have a file for each month of the year.

A.17:  Okay.

B.18:  And then I also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills
come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid
for {very faint} [child].

A.19:  Okay.  Um, so this insures that you know what your bills are.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  And that they get paid.

B.22:  ((Unless I get)) paid on time.

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  #Like,# like for instance, if a bill is due on March fourth,

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  #I'll just,# I'll put it in the folder with March and that way when I get
paid in March I know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that
month.

A.27:  Okay.  So that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid
for.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  #Now, do yo-,# 

B.30:  #And that,#

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Go ahead.

B.32:  And that way I keep a running list of what bills I do have.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And that way I know if I have any extra money or not.

A.35:  Okay.  And, uh, what happens then when you don't?

B.36:  When I don't what?

A.37:  Have extra money [laughter].

B.38:  We-, [laughter] then I don't do anything [laughter].

A.39:  Oh, okay.

B.40:  I've got two little boys.

A.41:  Oh.  Uh-huh.

B.42:  So I'm at home most of the time anyway, but like once in a while, like when
my taxes came back, I had extra money so I paid a baby-sitter to watch my kids
for the day, and I went to, I went goofing off and you know just something
little like that,

A.43:  #Uh-huh.#

B.44:  #but# it's something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have
kids.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  Because you're, always got to have money when you have kids [laughter].

A.47:  Oh, yeah.  So, do you do anything about, you know, saying, hey, I'm willing
to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on,

B.48:  #Well, I have a,#

A.49:  #clothing or,#

B.50:  I have a running budget for every month.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And on that budget, I type up a budget for every month in the year.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And it has the bills that I know I have every month,

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  #electric,# phone, food, the kid's pediatrician.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  Uh, my Visa bill, you know.  All the bills I know I have every month are on
that budget.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  And so once all of those get paid, I go through my file and see if there is
anything else and if there's not, then I know that the rest of the money is
mine.

A.61:  So is food in that list also?

B.62:  Oh, yes.

A.63:  And so you have a certain amount you spend on groceries that you,

B.64:  #Right.#

A.65:  #expect to# spend for each month?

B.66:  Right.

A.67:  Okay.  And things like, um, now some, some expenses come up, you know,
twice a year or once a year like insurance.

B.68:  Right, or well that comes up every six months for me.

A.69:  #Uh-huh.#

B.70:  #Or# like tags come up once a year.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And you've got to figure that in too.

A.73:  So you have an entry e-, for each month for those things?

B.74:  Right.  

A.75:  #Uh-huh.#

B.76:  #Whenever# my tags come up, uh, there is an entry right there that says
tags and then I just leave the space blank until I find out how much I owe for
my tags and then I get them, and that way I know, I know that they have to be
paid in that month,

A.77:  #Uh-huh.#

B.78:  #so, I'm# expecting it [laughter].

A.79:  And, and so you, I mean, each month before that do you put away, you know,
one tent-, one twelfth of it or,

B.80:  No, usually I just pay it out of whatever paycheck is in that month.

A.81:  #Oh.#

B.82:  #Because# after I pay my regular bills, I usually have approximately a
hundred and fifty dollars.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  And with that hundred and fifty dollars I pay things that come up like
insurance --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  I could pay with that hundred and fifty dollars and then what is ever left
I can do w-, what I want with.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  So now what about the, uh, [lipsmack] long term considerations
like retirement and college #and stuff?#

B.90:  #Well,# I've got an annuity fund set up.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  Because I don't know, just the way I was raised.  I look toward the future.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  Not only for my kids, but for myself.  And I've got an annuity for me and
every two months I buy my boys each a savings bond.

A.95:  Oh.

B.96:  Every since they have been born I've been doing that.

A.97:  That sounds great.

B.98:  #So,#

A.99:  #Um,# so now what exactly in an annuity?  I've always found those a little
confusing.

B.100:  An annuity is an account, it's like a, it's, it's a type of savings
account, okay?

A.101:  Okay.

B.102:  But you don't touch it.  You just deposit money into it but you don't touch
it other than that, and it just sits there and gains interest until your
retirement.

A.103:  Okay.  Now, do you pay taxes on the interest?

B.104:  Not right now.

A.105:  Okay.  Only #when,#

B.106:  #Yo-,#

A.107:  you draw it out?

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  Okay.

B.110:  And like if, elderly people, they have a choice of having an I R A account
--

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- and they get special discounts on like the, um, what's the word I'm
trying to think of, the interest charges and stuff.  If they have an I R A,
they get special rates on it and stuff.

A.113:  [Noise]  You mean from the, you mean from taxes or,

B.114:  Right.

A.115:  Fr-, from the federal government you mean?

B.116:  Right. 

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  For the elderly people and stuff that have I R A's set up and they get
special discounts on that but an, an annuity is, it's a savings account that
you don't withdraw anything out of.  You just keep depositing money into it.

A.119:  Okay.  Now I guess the question is, is it better than an,
