===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  Okay, well, Mark, our situation is that we do have a daughter that is, uh,
in the situation of choosing college.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  She's actually at Bible College for this current year.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, uh, I guess [breathing], uh, first and foremost, it, really it's a
question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then,
uh, uh, which colleges or universities can best offer that program, and then
it comes down to the dollar.  You have to, uh, it's whether or not you're a
resident for that jurisdiction, or --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- you know, it does, it comes down to, uh --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- trying to come with a trade off of the costs.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Uh, what do you feel about come of the things that need to,

A.13:  ((Damn it)), I agree with pretty much with everything you've said.  Uh, the
one, the one thing that I, you know, I'd advise any parent, uh, you know, or
any, or any person looking for a college, uh, is that I think, I think, you
know, it's really important for them to actually visit the college and
actually try and get away from, you know, the guided tour of the college and
try and talk to the, you know, actual students there because, you know,
they're just, uh, in my experience, I've talked to people at other colleges,
uh, that, you know, the, the, the way, the, you know, the, the, the lifestyle
pictured in the cat-, catalogs isn't always [laughter] the whole story.

B.14:  No, y-, the, the college, the, the catalogs are sales material.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  It doesn't matter -- 

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- whether, you know, they're, they're selling school.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  And, uh, and, true, it, uh, really is helpful if a parent and the student
can get there and see --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the
school.  Uh, I guess there's a difference in, here the, at least,

A.23:  [Clanking].

B.24:  the university here in ((Saskatoon)) is primarily, uh, off campus resident
students.  Like, they just live in the community.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  Uh, you know, I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities,
particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where
dormitory life is, uh, is right on campus as well --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- and that, you know, that changes the character --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- of it quite a bit.  

A.31:  Yeah, I, I go to Georgia Tech which is, you know, primarily an engineering
school --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, you know, I think I really do miss the fact, you know, ((that))
it's not a university, that there's, there's not, the, the, you know, it tends
to be a very conservative school and there, and there doesn't seem to be the
diversity of views that a lot of, you know, universities will, will have.

B.34:  Yeah.  Uh, I guess we're here, this is the university that has, for years
had the, the car, that, uh, will travel the farthest on, uh, on a small
quantity of gas, our engineering students.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  Uh, in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see, uh, if
you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well
as graduates --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- can give you idea of the character of the school.  Uh, whether you, you
know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence
or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- producing graduates.  

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  Uh, you know, as sort of some development and some training, uh, like it's
easy enough to crank out graduates, but to really challenge them --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- and, uh, and that can vary between colleges, and faculties even, as to
how, you know, what the attitude towards achievement is.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Uh, do you, uh, have anyone that you're seriously needing to, uh, feed
information to?  I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student,
you're a ways away from that.

A.47:  Yeah, uh, I don't really know of anyone that's like look-, that's looking
for colleges now, you know, because it, with the exception of, uh, people's
younger brothers and sisters.  ((Then the only advise passed)) down is, don't
go to Georgia Tech [laughter].

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  Uh, but, uh, no, actua-, actually I'm, I'm, I'm more interested in, in, in
choosing the right j-, job when you graduate [laughter] --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- type information [laughter].  

B.52:  Well, that's, that's one of the, really, a valid point that people need --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- to consider as well.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Uh, you know, to, going to college, university is going to take four to
eight years depending on the --

A.57:  Program.  

B.58:  -- p-, pa-, programs person's involved in and after that, you have to be
out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself --

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market --

A.61:  Uh-uh. 

B.62:  -- jeez, if that's,

A.63:  Uh-huh, like a fine arts education, I,

B.64:  Right.  Best training in the world is not going to f-, put food on your
table.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  But, uh,
