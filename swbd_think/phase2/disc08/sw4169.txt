==========================================================================

A.1:  How do you get your current events?  Are you a (( )) couch potato or
[noise]?

B.2:  Well, actually, no.  Uh, it's, it's multifaceted for me since I'm married
to a news junkie.

@A.3:  Oh, is that right [laughter].

B.4:  Uh, yeah.  We, we get the, you know, about three papers a day.  Plus
there's four different newscasts that we watch.  And, of course, if there's
nothing else, uh, worth doing or watching on television, we'll watch either
headline news or C N N itself and, uh --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- plus, I'm a member of a, an electronic community and I get a lot of news
that way.  So, uh, it's really pretty hard to not be informed #[laughter].#

A.7:  #That's right,# #yeah.#

B.8:  #How# about yourself?

A.9:  Well I start out the day listening to the radio on my, you know, as I'm
getting ready for work.

B.10:  [Clicking] {sounds like a cigarette lighter}.

A.11:  And in the evenings, and, and, I'm in a vacuum all day except what news I
get electronically.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  We have, uh, electronic news at work.  Uh, the lunch table discussion
usually brings up a few things that people have seen in the paper that morning
and I haven't had time to read #[laughter]#.

B.14:  #Yeah.#

A.15:  And, uh, some more radio on the way home and, it's usually too late to
watch the news by the time I get home but I can, uh, read the newspaper then.
The morning news, of course [laughter].

B.16:  Uh-huh.  And, #of course# --

A.17:  #And,# 

B.18:  -- everything's changed by that time.  ((It)),

A.19:  Oh, of course, of course.  And then, uh, the ten o'clock news at bedtime.

B.20:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

A.21:  #So, that's# about it.  I don't have cable T V now.  I used to do like you
did and the default was C N N.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  You know and I could just, I'd have that thing going for hours [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah [inhaling].  They really have some fascinating stuff, especially on
the weekends.  Uh, we kind of, uh, we kind of like C N B C.  I don't know if
you've ever seen it.  But it's a, it's a cable, well you don't have cable.
Cable N B C.

A.25:  Huh.

B.26:  And it's sort of like, uh, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO on cable television.

A.27:  Oh, wow. 

B.28:  So they go into all sorts of neat, little off the wall kind of topics that
you normally wouldn't get in, uh, [lipsmack] in, in a conventional news
broadcast or even on C N N.  It's sort of like socketed little special
interest kinds of things.  And it's really fascinating to see.  You know,
they're out there covering it.  Uh, one thing I wanted to ask you about was
the, you're, you said you're in Dallas?

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  The quality of your local papers.  Do you, do you see pandering
#[laughter]?#

A.31:  #[Laughter].#

B.32:  Because,

A.33:  Well, the, the most noticeable thing about our two local papers is that we
now have one local paper.

B.34:  uh. #No.#

A.35:  #THE,# THE TIMES HERALD went out of business.

B.36:  [Throat_clearing].

A.37:  It was always the weak sister of the two.  

B.38:  Okay.

A.39:  Uh, and the MORNING NEWS, uh, {pause} managed somehow to acquire nearly all
the comics and features that the TIMES HERALD had been carrying.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  So, I mean, they just, they just plundered [laughter] the poor TIMES
HERALD.  I mean, it was financial.  You can blame the syndicates for going
where their, you know, they got bigger bucks or whatever.

B.42:  Yeah.  Well, see, we're a Gannett city.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And, uh, the DEMOCRAT and CHRONICLE and TIMES UNION are our papers and a, a
few years ago, they merged editorial boards.  However, they still continue to
publish.  They put out three additions.  Well, it's actually D N C puts out
t-, one in the morning.  And the TIMES UNION puts out two but they're
virtually the same paper.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  There's an, there's an evening edition which comes out at noon #[laughter]
and,#

A.47:  #[Laughter].#

B.48:  and the late edition which comes out at three.  And just to give you an
idea of what I meant by pandering.  It's like sometimes they, their news for
the news for the incredible stupid or comatose.

A.49:  ((Wow)).

B.50:  The past two days the headlines have been, Massive Storm Hits Area.

A.51:  #[Laughter].#

B.52:  #And it's like# --

A.53:  [Laughter] In case you're brain dead.

B.54:  -- wh-, you know, oh, well that explains all the snow --

A.55:  Yeah [laughter].

B.56:  -- you know [laughter].  (( )) that someone was worried about it.  I just,
you know, I, I have to wonder, uh, [lipsmack] h-, h-, how well they're serving
us because, uh, y-, y-, they've, they've got a lock on it.  They don't,
there's not that many, there's a few alternative newspapers.  But they all,
all the alternative newspapers have this sort of an underground feel to them.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And, you, you know, you really can't trust them.  They're not, I, I think I
need conservatism from my news.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  I don't know.  I'm funny.

A.61:  Just the facts please.

B.62:  Yeah.  Just the facts and, and I don't want really much of a slant on it at
all.  I just want the news.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  You know.  I don't want, uh, someone judging the news for me.  

A.65:  That, one of the most famous headlines and I think this was on the
editorial page and I don't remember it exactly, of the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
was, was some story about how well people can read and the fact that they
can't and the headline was something like, Let's Ban Literacy.  And wait a
minute, that sounds fine at first [laughter].  They want to ban illiteracy I
think [laughter].

B.66:  I think so.

A.67:  [Noise].

B.68:  Let's ban literacy but that's going to put you guys out of business don't
you think #[laughter].#

A.69:  #That's right [laughter] yeah.#
