=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I think, um, for at least for me, uh, because my sister is looking
for day care.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  One of the things that we talked about as being very important is the, um,
the in, the teacher to, uh, the number of kids.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  Because if you've got a lo-, a large number of children, one teacher just
won't cut it.

B.6:  Right.  Even if it's in the home.  

A.7:  #Right.#

B.8:  #I think# this is important even if it's a private home situation --

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  -- and not a day care.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Um, probably number one too would be close references.  If you know people
that have had the experience that they, hands on experience of one --

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  -- would be very important, word of mouth.  

A.15:  Word of mouth is good.  

B.16:  #((Um,)) friends.#

A.17:  #Uh, something# that I don't think many people know about and I, this is
just something I've heard not something I've actually, um, checked into.  Is
that, um, the agency that, uh, that license, um, agencies to care for kids
like hom-, either home or day care, you can, you can request to see if they
have had any problems in the past.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  Is what I've been told.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  That would be a good, a good resource to check.  

B.22:  Right.  Right.  And all, of course, better business.  I would check any of
your business, um, [lipsmack] any type of thing, references of that type --

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  -- as well as your word of mouth.  If you were putting them in, uh, uh,
school or any day care type, you know, that's public.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  You know what I mean.  

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Like a church or a -- 

A.29:  Oh, yeah.  

B.30:  -- school type thing.  

A.31:  Oh, yeah.  

B.32:  I would check that awfully close.  Um, I'd go in often,  

A.33:  Yes.  And in, 

B.34:  #unexpectedly.# 

A.35:  #and there's some# places, I'm sorry go ahead.  

B.36:  Unexpectedly.  Wherever they where.  

A.37:  Right.  Because then there's some places and I'll, and I would, don't, this
would be a, a big minus for the places.  There are some places that state that
you cannot come in unannounced.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  You have to have an appointment or, you know, #whatever.#

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  And I don't think, you know, 

B.42:  I wouldn't do that.  

A.43:  #if there, huh-uh.# 

B.44:  #I mean# I wouldn't, not put my child in there, 

A.45:  #No.# 

B.46:  #though.#  Would you?  

A.47:  No, never.  

B.48:  You know, I would never have a controlled situation.  Not with a little one
especially.

A.49:  Yes.  

B.50:  You know, that's not a, not a good situation on that.  

A.51:  And I think you've also got to loo-, you know, whenever you go in and, you
know, talk to the, talk to the, the, the teachers --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and look at the toys that they have -- 

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- and the environment that the kids, 

B.56:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.57:  #will be in.# 

B.58:  Right.  That's real important.  I believe so too, 

A.59:  #Yes.# 

B.60:  #to meet the,# and administrators as well and really kind of research it
and get an idea of how they feel about things,

A.61:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.62:  #you know.# 

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  Have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all.  Kind of how
they, basically, anyway because they, you know, that's, um, seventy percent of
your child's life --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- you know, is developing, is there.   

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  So that's real important.  Do you have any children in it yourself?

A.69:  No, uh, like I said my sister, 

B.70:  #Your sister is.#

A.71:  #is# in the process,

B.72:  #Uh-huh.#

A.73:  #of trying# to find one for hers.  

B.74:  Yeah.  It's a scary thing.  My daughter has been in Houston and had to do
it, you know, just out of the cold she's had to.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  But she's been real fortunately in finding women in their homes.

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  #And, uh,# 

A.79:  #Right.# And, and that's a good situation but it can, it can, it can turn
bad with older children.

B.80:  Uh-huh.   

A.81:  Um, I was in a day care until I was thirteen.  

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  Just during like in the summers.  

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  And what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was
the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave
me there to care for the little ones.

B.86:  Oh, wow.  

A.87:  You know, 

B.88:  #Yeah.#

A.89:  #and I mean# this went on for a sum-, for a, you know, good two and a half
months.

B.90:  Uh-huh.   

A.91:  You know, and it's her daily thing, 

B.92:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.93:  #you know,# and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to
leave at home --

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  -- sometimes a day ca-, a, a, a private home or a day care setting is not
the best.

B.96:  Not the best situation.  

A.97:  Right.  

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  Right.  

B.100:  Yeah.  That's for sure.  

A.101:  So, but, oh, and another one is, is how they discipline.

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  Um, I know depending, a couple of the day cares that, that I went to
whenever I was younger, um, one of them disciplined, whenever we were outside
you hugged a tree.

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  And you had time out.  

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  Whereas, you know, I've heard of some agencies, you know, that get into the
physical discipline.

B.108:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.109:  And you really have to find a discipline that, that matches your beliefs.

B.110:  Yes.  Right.  

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  And what you would want done.  Right.  

A.113:  Right.  

B.114:  #Yeah.#

A.115:  #Because# it gets, it can, it can become very confusing for the child.

B.116:  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  So,

B.118:  I would think so.  

A.119:  Oh, yeah.  

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  Huh.  What about, um, well, I'm in, I'm in nursing.  

B.122:  Uh-huh.  

A.123:  So one thing I would look at would be, um,

B.124:  The cleanliness and, 

A.125:  #The cleanliness,#

B.126:  #the care.# 

A.127:  and the care. 

B.128:  Health care.  

A.129:  The healt-, that's right the certification,  

B.130:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.131:  #of the,# 

B.132:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.133:  #of the# teachers.  

B.134:  Right.  

A.135:  Because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day
care --

B.136:  Uh-huh.  

A.137:  -- knows, knows infant and child C P R.  

B.138:  Right.  

A.139:  But there's a lot of places,
