===========================================================================

A.1:  Let's see, mine's pretty easy actually.  Uh, I just got done reading a, a
magazine or a couple magazine articles about the, uh, new Saturns.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  Uh, and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just like love to
have one.

B.4:  Oh, really, you like, uh, so you're an American -- 

A.5:  Well,   

B.6:  -- you want to buy American.  

A.7:  No, regardless of that fact.  It's the best car in the class for the be-,
cheapest amount of money.  I'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little
autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing --

B.8:  Um. 

A.9:  -- and, uh, it seems to just blow the com-, compe-, competition away.

B.10:  It terms of handling, uh, acceleration,

A.11:  Handling, power, everything.  Yeah, it just got like the top rating.  It
was compared up against, uh, let's see, there was like the Mazda M X three,
uh, Nissan's, whatever, their two, N X two thousand, the Civic S I and it
just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them.  Everybody, all the, uh,
raters loved it.  I like the, I like the styling and, I seen a few of them
actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it.

B.12:  What about Mustang G T -s?  

A.13:  Mustang G T -s?  Uh, can't afford it.  

B.14:  Those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, p-, price range.

A.15:  Right, yeah, I'm a graduate student and, let's face it, I don't make any
money so,

B.16:  Right.  

A.17:  [Laughter]. 

B.18:  Well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you
can buy whatever you want.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  [Laughter]. 

A.21:  Yeah, we'll see then.  Yeah, right now I'm stuck, I, I've got a, a Pontiac
Sunbird Turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable and trying to get it prepared
for racing.  But it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the g-,
Saturn.

B.22:  Right, would you use that for city driving and racing?  

A.23:  Oh, yeah, I'd do it, I'd use it for both.  The nice thing about
autocrossing is you can, you can do both.

B.24:  Autocrossing is, what kind of track is that?  

A.25:  Uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh,
parking lots.

B.26:  Okay.  And you put up, set up the -- 

A.27:  And pylons --  

B.28:  -- track, pylons.  

A.29:  -- and things.  

B.30:  Okay.  

A.31:  Tight turns, hard acceleration.  I've seen a lot of Mustangs, uh, compete
and it's interesting.  They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in
their class.

B.32:  Oh, really?  

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  Yeah, I would guess so.  

A.35:  Uh, what are you thinking about buying?  

B.36:  Uh, I think I'd like to get, uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which
I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, Hon-, I mean, a, a
Acura Legend.

A.37:  The Legend.  

B.38:  Uh --

A.39:  Uh.

B.40:  -- a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe.  

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  Something on that order.  I haven't really determined if I like the, the
Japanese or the, if I like them enough to purchase one.

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  You know, because your B M W -s, your German cars have good reputations, I
think.

A.47:  Yeah, well, I was, I was actually in, uh, a lot of the B M W -s are
produced in, uh, sh-, uh, Stutgardt and, uh, and Munich --

B.48:  Yes.  

A.49:  -- and I was, I was there this, uh, summer and, uh, i-, I was really
impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and --

B.50:  The,  

A.51:  -- such for B M W.  

B.52:  Yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, I mean, they, they kind
of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better,

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  which is kind of hard to take [laughter].  

A.55:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.56:  I mean -- 

A.57:  Uh,   

B.58:  -- as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of
[laughter], they're trying to brainwash you, too [laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter] Oh, of course, of course they are.  They want you to buy their
car.  Yeah, there, it was, it was interesting.  I was at, I, I also went to,
uh, the Porsche and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely
opposed.

B.60:  Oh, really?  

A.61:  Yeah, the, uh, the B M W is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like
high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and,
and then you go to Porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely
handmade --

B.62:  Um.  

A.63:  -- and no two of them are alike [laughter].  

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  And -- 

B.66:  Yeah that's,

A.67:  -- so it's like completely opposed.  I don't know, which do I like better,
I think I like the [laughter] Porsche's philosophy a little bit better,
although it's not really practical.

B.68:  No, it's not realistic.  

A.69:  Unless, it's, it's a toy.  

B.70:  Yeah, if you can --

A.71:  Let's face it.

B.72:  -- afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, uh [laughter],

A.73:  Yeah, yeah, but it, it, B M W -s good for that.  What kind of driving just
like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?

B.74:  Yeah, just work, short trips.  No m-, no heavy mileage.  I'm putting on
less than fifteen thousand miles a year.

A.75:  Wow, yeah.  

B.76:  So it's pretty minimal.  

A.77:  That's cool.  

B.78:  Lasts a long time.  That's mainly what I'm looking for.  

A.79:  Yeah, that's good.  I also, I was impressed by, uh, by the Mercedes, too.

B.80:  Oh, yeah.  

A.81:  I really, I really like the Mercedes.  

B.82:  But,   

A.83:  The factory was nice and,

B.84:  But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop,
they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
[laughter].

A.85:  And is it different for the, for the B M W?  

B.86:  Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably
different.  Once you get up --

A.87:  Probably.  

B.88:  -- in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up
significantly [laughter].

A.89:  Right, [laughter] I can -- 

B.90:  So -- 

A.91:  -- imagine that.  

B.92:  -- I'm kind, yeah, I'm not sure if I really want,
