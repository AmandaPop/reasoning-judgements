===========================================================================

B.1:  Uh, well,

A.2:  Oh, let's see.  Crimes and circumstances.  Actually, I'm, I'm against
capital punishment.  Uh, probably not for the reasons that a lot of people
are.  I'm against it because I really don't think that, uh, there are any
crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason I think that is because
I really don't have the belief that, uh, any particular person's life is worth
so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it.  I think you can
either, you know, put him in jail for, you know, some very long period of time
or if they're really, you know, mentally ill, then I don't think they can
really be held accountable for their actions anyway.

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  So, uh, I just, I, I'm just basically against it.  

B.5:  [Laughter]. 

A.6:  Uh [laughter].  I also, I also don't have enough faith in our
[throat_clearing], our criminal justice system to, to avoid getting the
bloopers in there once in a while.

B.7:  Well [laughter], that's probably a pretty good objection.  Uh, yeah,
actually I'm, I'm in favor of it, uh [laughter],

A.8:  [Laughter]. 

B.9:  This ought to be an interesting discussion.  Uh [laughter], uh, I, my basic
reason is that,

A.10:  [Ringing].

B.11:  uh, if someone, uh, willfully takes a life of another individual, uh, I
think that they have, in most cases forfeited, uh, their convention by which
they agree to abide to when, when they enter into society.  Uh, you know, they
have, there's a, a convention that, you know, you shall not kill other
individuals, uh, and if you can kill with impunity, uh, then that kind of
makes you king of the hill in a society that they can't control you, uh, and
if you've shown that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals
that, that you kill, uh, cold-bloodedly, or whatever, then, uh, it's probably,
uh, a good thing to remove, remove you from that society.  Uh, and one,
probably one of the more effective ways of, of doing that is through the death
penalty, uh, because it's a highly visible sort of action, uh, and it also
sends a message that, you know, this, this sort of behavior is not tolerable
within the society and you will forfeit all your rights, uh, if you engage in
such activity.

A.12:  Uh-huh.  

B.13:  So,  

A.14:  Well, i-, isn't locking somebody up, I mean, equivalent to that?

B.15:  Well, uh, yeah, in a sense that, you know, that individual is removed from
direct contact with society, but that individual then becomes a burden to
society, a non productive burden.

A.16:  Yeah.  

B.17:  Uh, because they'd sit there,

A.18:  Do I,

B.19:  And, I mean, their quality of life is horrible --

A.20:  Yeah.  

B.21:  -- uh, because they're rotting away in a jail, uh, and the taxpayers are
paying, you know, for them to sit there and twiddle away and, and make license
plates or something [laughter].

A.22:  Yeah, actually, see, I'm, I'm sort of a-, there ((are)), there ((are)) some
other things I'm a-, I'm against also.  I th-, I think that jailing people for
a really long period of time is, is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual
punishment, which I'm also against.

B.23:  [Laughter] #Well,# 

A.24:  #So,#

B.25:   Yeah. 

A.26:  And so, so, I'm sort of in this quandary, you know, I mean, either you have
[laughter], 

B.27:  [Laughter].

A.28:  either you execute them and, uh, you're done with it or, you know, you
throw them, you throw them in jail for some incredibly long period of time and
then I think, well, I wouldn't, you know, you, you don't want to be cruel to
these guys, and they say by throwing them in a jail where they're, you know,
constantly abused or what other, other, brother, or, uh, other cell mates, you
know.

B.29:  Uh-huh.  

A.30:  So, so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon, you know, where you,

B.31:  [Laughter].

A.32:  got to set up, you know, some incredibly safe rubber room, but, you know,
then when you set up the rubber room, you know, it's so, uh, [laughter] it's
so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't --

B.33:   Right, right [laughter].  

A.34:  -- crazy already, and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment.

B.35:  Exactly.

A.36:  Uh,  

B.37:  Exactly.

A.38:  O-, on the other hand, I think there a lot of individuals who probably
haven't really signed up to the idea of, you know, our co-, I mean, most
western people's concept of c-, civilization, you know.

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  And, I mean western in the sense of just, you know, western philosophy, I
guess.

B.41:  Okay.  

A.42:  Uh, but [throat_clearing], you know, I, I kind of don't buy into the idea
that, uh, that to have a society you necessarily have to, to, you know,
terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because I think there
are probably a lot of instances where, uh, you get into a situation where
somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and, I mean, they
kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something and --

B.43:  How so?  

A.44:  -- besi-, well, for instance, the society sort of forces themself on
somebody, you know, you hear, once in a while you hear about these incidences
where, uh, some guy is, you know, off there in the wilderness or something,
you know,

B.45:  [Laughter]. 

A.46:  [Laughter] and, and, and he just doesn't want to be part of society.

B.47:  Uh-huh.  

A.48:  And society kind of invades his turf, you know, makes him want to, or, you
know, makes him, makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't
even known to society before and he winds up, you know, shooting somebody or,
you know, killing a cop who's trying to get him to, you know, come in to pay
his di-, I, there's a million, there's a million things,

B.49:  [Laughter].

A.50:  you know, that I can, million scenarios that I can imagine where the guy
would be sort of like, hey, I don't want to be in this society, you know,
leave me alone, you know, and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody, you
know, he'd get the death penalty, you know.
