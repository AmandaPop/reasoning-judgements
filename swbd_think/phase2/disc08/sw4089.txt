=======================================================================

A.1:  How's the quality of air in Portland?

B.2:  Very good.

A.3:  Really?

B.4: Well, let me put it this way.  It's [child_talking] relatively, uh,
[child_talking] it's very good if you are a little bit away from the city and
[child_talking] and it's wonderful on days that it rains.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  But, uh, downtown they have a few problems.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Quite a bit of ozone and a lot of smog.

B.8:  But it's, but it's sort of localized [child_talking].

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  [Child_talking] It's not like Los Angeles where I use to live.

A.11:  Oh yeah.  I've heard that Los Angeles is horrible and Denver is I hear it's
really bad.

B.12:  Ye-, yes.

A.13:  Atlanta, Atlanta is moderately bad.  Uh, you know we have, we have a big
problem with ozone.  Uh, [talking] [smack] and you know it's generally, uh, you
know, it's just just quite often, you know, be a very hazy sort of day
[talking] you know, because there will just be this pollution hanging in the
air.  [talking] Uh, I think a lot, I think most of our problems cause by
automobile emissions. [talking] [breathing] It's, you know, a very mobile
city [breathing].

B.14:  It, I guess that's, uh, the major problem with most cities except --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- except places like, uh, oh Mexico City or some place like that.  Well I
guess it's a problem there too but, but they do have some places where it's
caused by power plants and --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and stuff like that.

A.19:  Heavy industry.  Yeah, I think the industry has been, you know, relatively
[noise] good about, uh, you know having regulations at least in the last twenty
years or so about industry pollution, but it's just seem that, I think, I
think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized
mass transit system.  Any sort of, you know, like high speed rail or even even
you know decent regular passenger rail across the country.  Uh, it seems it
seems like, like there there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile,
you know, throu-, through the construction of highways --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- for automobiles. 

B.22:  [Breathing] Although, th-, there is one thing that I, uh, [sniffing] I
learned in, in chemistry many years ago --

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  -- and that's, uh, I, are [children] are you a chemist [children_talking]?

A.25:  I know a little bit of chemistry.

B.26:  Anyway, this is, [noise] (( )) (( )) principle as I remember and it's
basically, uh, [smack] uh, when you have, uh, a reaction and it, it uh [child]
[smack], the reaction will go until it, it kind of comes to a balance, but if
you take away some of the products of that reaction --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- [Inhaling] then the reaction will go father.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  [Smack] And so, uh, the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out
was that he said [child_talking] he said in a desirable area, people will move
in until until bad things happen --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- that cause the [smack], uh, desireabilities to go to, uh, you know --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- to, uh, kind of balance out.  He says that if it's not air pollution,
[noise] it will be, it will be uh congestion or --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- price of land or something like that so --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- what I am looking at here in the Portland area is, is a temporary
situation.  It's a very desirable area as far as I am concerned.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And, uh, [smack] the wonderful air, the lack of [breathing] of congestion,
the low, low cost of, of uh, [child] [smack] property --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- uh, [talking] in a few years something is going to cause, I mean
there's, people are just going to continue to move in --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- until #we either,#

A.45:  #[Smack] Until it gets to the# air just can't, can't support them in the
quality #life# --

B.46:  #And# --

A.47:  -- they want.

B.48:  -- and as many people move in as move out.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  And it will come to [child_talking] a balance and then --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- if they come along and add new freeways.  So, let's say they reduce
traffic congestion --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- then air pollution will get bad [child] --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- or something else [child_talking] and that's happened in California.
That's for sure.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  [Inhaling] Uh, as [child_talking] far as [child_talking] in Atlanta, do
they have a, uh, do they have, uh, regulations on, on uh, [smack]
[child_talking] like inspections?

A.59:  Uh, they, they do have automo-, automobile emissions tests but, uh, it's
[child_talking] there's some sort of rule.  I don't have a car so I don't know
the actual specifics, but it's like yo-, your car is, it's a, if the model
year of your car is more than twenty years old, you don't have to have it
inspected any more.

B.60:  Yeah.  #The grandfather (()).#

A.61:  #You know, which# which is just kind of ludicrous.  [laughter] You know,
because it, they're the ones that you would expect to --

B.62:  Yeah [noise].

A.63:  -- you know be the hardest, be the biggest polluters.

B.64:  [Inhaling] Although, I think that's partly because it's harder to get parts
and [noise] and, uh --

A.65:  Yeah, that's true.

B.66:  -- and so, let's see.  What was my other questions?  [noise] Uh, [laughter]
my wife thinks this is, uh, a sales call so she's telling me to talk to you
about one of the problems with, uh, she thinks [child] it's from, uh, our cable
company.

A.67:  [Laughter].

B.68:  Uh, let's see what else?  We have, uh [smack] uh, let's see do you live
[noise], you don't live too clo-, do you live close to the city or far away
from it?

A.69:  I essentially live downtown.

B.70:  Okay, downtown.

A.71:  And I go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the
heart of downtown. [child_talking] Within a mile from the heart of downtown.

B.72:  Do they have smog days there?

A.73:  [Inhaling] It's, I don't think it's really announced.  You know, in the
sense that the way, the way it is in California but, uh, [smack] I have heard
on the news, you know, in the past couple of months or so that, you know, that
apparently there is some federal guidelines for, uh, smog and Atlanta is like
it,
