===========================================================================

B.1:  See, I don't have much time myself for that kind of thing, but, uh, I have
my father was, uh, quite handy.  He died recently, but, uh, uh, I have done
limited things, like, for example I've built, uh, [lipsmack] uh, [breathing]
tree house for my kids and, uh,

A.2:  Well, that's a project [laughter].  

B.3:  I really enjoy doing it.  I just don't have the time.  

A.4:  Uh-huh.  

B.5:  Uh, so,

A.6:  Well -- 

B.7:  Uh,   

A.8:  -- we do a lot of our own repair just, we enjoy doing it.  And, kind of
like you, though, it's finding the time to do it, but [breathing], oh, things
like, uh, the inside of the house, I always do the i-, all the painting in it.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  And, uh, in fact, come think of it, we did the outside, the trim of the
house and that turned out to be [laughter] quite a job since we have a two
story house [laughter].

B.11:  Um, absolutely.  

A.12:  And, uh,   

B.13:  Well, have you ever done any remodeling?  

A.14:  [Breathing] [lipsmack] Well, not really, we added a room upstairs or
finished off a room upstairs [breathing], but that was a [breathing], that
turned out to be quite a job, too.  It was a game room and, uh, it took us a
long time.  I mean I'm talking about a year to finish that [laughter].

B.15:  You know, it's very interesting, my, uh, father and I built a, a home, a
new home for ourselves from, basically from the ground up when I was a
teenager.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  And, uh,

A.18:  [Meow].

B.19:  it's amazing how these things work.  One of m-, most,

A.20:  [Meow].

B.21:  amazing things is, to me is that,

A.22:  [Meow].

B.23:  what appears to be the major part of the work, basically putting the
structure up happens very quickly.

A.24:  Uh-huh.  

B.25:  But then, you know, comes the inside and the trim and the electrical work
and [laughter] the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like ninety
percent of the time, it was very frustrating, takes a long time to get that
house done.

A.26:  Uh-huh, the fitting, I think is what is, took us so long, you know, the
measurement and fitting it, trying it, taking it down, fitting it again that,

B.27:  I see, yeah.

A.28:  [Breathing] Uh, [lipsmack] uh, so we have recently built on a, a extra
garage to our house and, uh [breathing] we had a lot of, well, we had the
concrete and stuff poured first.  We didn't attempt that.  We talked about it,
but decided that was going be a bit much and, uh, but we did all the finishing
out on it and my husband has a workshop in it, or, uh, he races cars and we
needed a spare [laughter] garage there.

B.29:  Um.  

A.30:  And that turned out to be quite a project.  Uh, we're looking at, uh, a lot
of small things to do around the house now like, uh, I think we are on
borrowed time on things like the hot water heater.

B.31:  Um.  

A.32:  It's [laughter],

B.33:  Um.  

A.34:  That we're going to change out our self that, uh, I've learned to --

B.35:  Do,  

A.36:  -- do some plumbing [laughter].  

B.37:  Do people change out these things before they fail or,

A.38:  Well, we do because, uh, we've had one fail and it was quite a mess --

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  -- for us that,

B.41:  They can cause a lot of damage I know.  

A.42:  Yes, and so, uh, we can tell that it's going out because the, the, we're
running out of hot water and stuff.  We'll have some, it's an electric heater
and, uh, we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out and we
priced them and kind of felt like it would be just as cheap for us to go on
and change it out and, and be done with it [laughter], than this waiting for
it to flood us and --

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  -- like it did before and, uh, and you can get them at discount stores
fairly cheap and, uh, [lipsmack] we can do it our-, it's not that much
trouble just, unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more [laughter].

B.45:  Yeah, the small, those small projects are manageable, you know, I, I fix
toilets and things like that --

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  -- but when it comes to major, uh, projects, putting in stairw-, uh, in
extra stairways or putting on an extra room or something like that, I just
absolutely do not have the time --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  -- to do that.  

A.50:  Well, it is time consuming.  

B.51:  The, the frustrating thing is that I enjoy doing it.  

A.52:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.53:  But, uh, you know, I work [laughter] twelve hours a day seven days a week
as it is, so I can't, just don't have time for,
