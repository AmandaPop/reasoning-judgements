A.1:  So, how you like New Jersey?  

B.2:  Uh, it's pretty good, you know.  You get, uh, closer to the, uh, coast
here, and you do get a good bit of, uh, smog and stuff, especially from all
the, uh, fuel cracking towers and chemical plants.

A.3:  Right, I guess, uh, I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in, but I
guess it's, uh, fairly industrial?

B.4:  Yeah, it's, when you get further east towards New York City it gets very
industrial --

A.5:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- but I'm, I'm about, uh, thirty miles west of there so you have, uh,
actually green trees and such that you --

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  -- don't notice that, that other part of --

A.9:  Yeah {faint}.

B.10:  -- New Jersey exists.  

A.11:  Right.  

B.12:  Actually very,

A.13:  [Laughter]. 

B.14:  Y-, you know, you go even a few wi-, miles out and you got, uh, farms and
everything so you, relatively clear air.

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  But, uh,

A.17:  Well, I don't know about you, but I've always considered automobiles to be,
probably the, the prime contributor.  I mean there's a lot of contributors,
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of
that.

B.18:  Oh, d-, definitely.  It's -- 

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- uh, you know, there are a large number of them on the road.  They're
all, you know, going, and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair.

A.21:  That's, yeah, that's, that's a big issue is, you know, a lot of states
don't have a, uh, inspection law so you get, you get a lot of people out there
without E T R, emission control systems on their cars and things like that.

B.22:  Oh, e-, even where you do have the inspections, you know, the inspection is
once a year.

A.23:  Yeah, and it's like, 

B.24:  You get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something
--

A.25:  Sure.  

B.26:  -- and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that.

A.27:  Right.  I guess, from what I hear, though, uh, next year Ford is coming out
with their electric cars.  They're actually coming out with the first
prototypes in California.

B.28:  Yeah, that, and I think also some of the, uh, car companies are coming out
with, uh, gas powered fleets --

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- so you, natural gas powered rather than, uh, gasoline.  

A.31:  Right.  I hope, I, I'm hoping that comes along quick [laughter].  Uh, I was
reading a, an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast
that's going and I guess it's, it's really disappearing a lot quicker than
people realize and I know that's not due to, uh, it's not due to, to gasoline
or to, you know, carbon monoxide so much as the C F C -s but,

B.32:  It, it is coming from cars, though.  

A.33:  Uh, yeah, I think that's a, that's a contributor definitely. 

B.34:  I mean, the, uh, car air conditioners is -- 

A.35:  Right.  

B.36:  -- one of the major leaking sources of, uh, the, uh, freon.  

A.37:  Right.  

B.38:  Which is one of the major flor-, chlorofar-, fluorocarbons.  

A.39:  Yeah, I guess right now what they're, what they're primarily worried about
is third world countries because I guess United States and, and Russia have
kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production, but --

B.40:  Well, it, it,

A.41:  -- it, go ahead. 

B.42:  No, it's, it's the type of thing there that, uh, you know, the Third World
countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- so they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S.  The U S
used, you know, all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to
get where it is today.

A.45:  Right.  And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have
been using is, that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
[laughter] if, if that makes any sense.  Uh, in terms of,

B.46:  Or, or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to
bootstrap them up to the way, where we --

A.47:  Exactly.  

B.48:  -- got to.  

A.49:  Exactly.  Uh, those of kind of, yeah, those are joining arguments, but, uh,
I don't know, that's, that's kind of an interesting situation there.  Uh, what
they don't realize, those third world countries, what they don't realize is
how quickly the ozone is depleting.  I guess the latest figures are up to
fifty percent at the Poles and it's, it's increasing even as far near the
Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  So it's kind of an interesting situation.  It's not [laughter], not a real
good one actually.

B.52:  #No.#

A.53:  #But,#   

B.54:  Well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest
destruction --

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  -- which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and --

A.57:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.58:  -- replacing some of the pollutants.  

A.59:  Yeah, you don't get that, that source of cleansing anymore.  Are, have you
been in big cities a long time?

B.60:  Mostly, I've mostly been in the east coast, so that's going between
Atlanta, Washing-, D C area, 

A.61:  Okay, so you've got,

B.62:  A-,  

A.63:  Yeah, those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard, I would think.

B.64:  Well, not, not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the,
uh, major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the --

A.65:  Yeah, Denver's #((definitely))# -- 

B.66:  -- #inversion# -- 

A.67:  -- yeah, that's one of the worst.  

B.68:  -- and Los Angeles and a-, rest of California which is just terrible it
sounds.

A.69:  Sure.  Yeah, Denver's that, that real good e-, that real good, uh, example
of sitting in a valley, kind of like Mexico City does, I guess.

B.70:  Uh-huh. 

A.71:  Mexico City is historically been one of the worst --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- in the, in the world for that.  But I've been pretty lucky, I've lived
in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem, although, uh, I'm
really kind of based in Orlando, Florida and there, you can tell that it's
getting worse.  I mean, it, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to
Los Angeles or Denver but you can,

B.74:  Yeah, there, it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in
the way of --

A.75:  Exactly.  

B.76:  -- heavy industry, you know, that would be causing it.  

A.77:  Yeah.  And there's not that much in terms of, of public transportation down
there.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  There is, but it's kind of it's,
