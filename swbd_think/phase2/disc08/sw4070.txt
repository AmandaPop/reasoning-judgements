=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I definitely think taxes are too high.  Uh, taxes at all levels, uh,
state, local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's, uh, income
now and, uh, the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for
the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes, but for
them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent.  It was rid-, you know,
[laughter] uh, that, that we took such drastic action over taxes, uh, and it's
so much worse now, but the people are just apathetic about it and sit back and
do nothing.

B.2:  Well, let's see.  Uh, yeah I think taxes are high but, uh, yeah maybe in
some cases they're not high enough.  For instance, uh, here in my state, uh,

A.3:  You have a real high sales tax there if I recall.

B.4:  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, bu-, but the reason the sales tax is high is because we
don't have an income tax.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  [Noise] And, uh, you know, we don't have an income [noise] tax because, uh,
basically nobody wants any [baby] new taxes, but the upshot is [baby] that we
can't properly fund, uh, education here.

A.7:  Oh really.

B.8:  Yeah.  So like [baby] the amount that we spend on education [noise] here
in, uh [baby], in the state of Washington per [noise], per student is, is
actually in the lower percentile.  Uh, I mean is, is, as long, we are ranked
fairly low.

A.9:  Interesting.

B.10:  But, per fifty states yet, uh, yeah, we expect a lot out of the schools.
You know, we've got, because the Seattle area, we've got a lot of, uh, uh, high
technology industries.  We've got Microsoft here.  Well, Microsoft expects
well educated employees.

A.11:  Sure.

B.12:  But, uh, you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards, uh,
[breathing] toward, uh, towards schools.  So, and there are those that argue
well they waste too much money in schools or those, or there, there's, you
know, more money doesn't solve the problem, but I feel like in public schools
that they, uh, that they really don't fund it, they don't basically fund it
very well.

A.13:  [Sniffing] Uh, my, my feeling about at least, I don't know if we want to
get off the subject of taxes and on the subject of schools, but around here,
uh, some of the public schools get more funds than the private schools.  Uh,
in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in
Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student, but the best private
school is, uh, has a tuition of only seven thousand.  And all of their students
of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the S A T etcetera and
the public school that gets, uh, quite a bit more money, just doesn't, uh,
doesn't turn out that quality of student #and,# 

B.14:  #Well# it's cheaper to to educate, uh, people who are in the top ten
percent than it is to have to,

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that
stuff.

A.17:  Yeah, but I think a lot of it is just that the money is wasted on
bureaucracy and it's not very efficient.  Uh, uh, we, we have you know a state
department of education and things which all, all they do is do statistics and
push paper around and none of the, one of the things that has happened here is
that, uh, the percentage of the money going to instruction meaning teacher's
salaries and books and materials has been fine even though that the total
funding has been going up.  Uh, so that, uh, you know whereas twenty years ago
seventy percent of the money going to schools went to teacher's salaries and
books and materials.  Now it is only forty-five percent.  And that's really
scary.  #To think that,# 

B.18:  #Yeah, that's, I've# been hearing that that's, uh, that, that has been
going down and, uh, I don't know what, uh, what all the reasons are for that.

A.19:  [Inhaling] Yeah, I think that, uh, one of the reasons that our taxes are so
high is just that, uh, on top of the inefficiencies like what I just described
is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no
business doing.  You know, we're spending a couple hundred billion dollars a
year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia, uh, we have no business spending
that money and, uh, we are spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on
interest on the debt.  Uh, there was a Presidential candidate forum here last
Saturday and we just had our primary in Georgia and, uh, uh, you know, I,
I've, one of the questions I asked the representative of Bob Carey who was
there, was uh, and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget
deficit this year.  What are you going to do to, to correct that?  And all,
al-, all they could say is, the, the only thing he would do is consolidate
some cabinet.
