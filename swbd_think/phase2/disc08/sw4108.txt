=========================================================================

B.1:  [Noise]  Okay.

A.2:  Uh, so, what do you think, uh, about putting the elderly in a nursing
home?

@B.3:  Well, I think that it, it varies on on the individual basis.

A.4:  Huh.

B.5:  Uh, sometimes it is, there is no alternative.

A.6:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.7:  Uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that's, uh, you may
not even have family that is, uh, uh, in, you know, who are around.

A.8:  That's true.  Yeah.

B.9:  So, sometimes it's not an alternative.

A.10:  Huh {very faint}.

B.11:  And I think, uh, but I think also, sometimes it can be, uh, a benefit if
it's for a short time.  Sometimes in a nursing home --

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- uh, especially if, if it's after an acute illness.  To get over a, or to
rehab after, uh, an illness.

A.14:  That's true.  I never thought of that.  #Yeah.#

B.15:  #Sometimes# you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just
short periods of time.

A.16:  That's true, until they get over that hump --

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  -- of whatever it is they're #dealing with.#

B.19:  #Because too# often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much
faster than what they're [noise] --

A.20:  Yes.

B.21:  -- really able to.

A.22:  They really are.  They don't like to keep them --

B.23:  So --

A.24:  -- longer than a week.

B.25:  -- so there is some good to it.

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  Uh, sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job.  You know the fam-, --

A.28:  What do you mean?

B.29:  -- well the families do not necessarily [inhaling], uh, know what to do
with them and they don't want to take the responsibility so they will put them
in a nursing home.

A.30:  Yeah, that's true.

B.31:  So you see, uh, there's both sides to it too.  #What do you
think?#

A.32:  #Yeah and it# depends on how, how sick the person is too.  What you're
capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own
[noise].

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  Yeah, uh, [smack] I would personally like it if my parents were to get
ill, I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with
some help.  That's not always possible.

B.35:  That's true.

A.36:  But, uh, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets
impossible [inhaling].

B.37:  I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are
going to, it's there's not a choice, #it's# --

A.38:  #Right.#

B.39:  -- because, it's not economically feasible even #to# --

A.40:  #Uh-huh# {very faint}.

B.41:  -- put them in a nursing home.

A.42:  [Inhaling]  Yeah.

B.43:  [Inhaling] So that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not
have the, uh, [noise] either Medicare or insurance to cover it.

A.44:  That's true.  Yeah.

B.45:  So,

A.46:  But I think nursing homes can be good.  It just depends on what kind they
are.  You know, you need to check them out ahead of time.

B.47:  Yeah, and then there's also some that are set up for specialties --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- uh, I know some.  Unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, I
guess it's Alzheimer's or #where# --

A.50:  #Uh-huh.#

B.51:  -- they wonder or, or, uh, [noise] confused or have some mental problem
[noise].

A.52:  [Smack] Yeah, that they're [noise],

B.53:  And you need a special nursing home for that.  You need one that has a unit
that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around --

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  -- and you need people who are trained for that #type# --

A.56:  #Right.#

B.57:  -- of problem.

A.58:  Who know what they're doing with that.

B.59:  Yeah so, so there's different types of nursing homes I think.

A.60:  Yeah well, my, uh, grandmother's not really in a nursing home, but a
retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it.
[inhaling] And she really liked the idea of, of moving there.  She's not ill
yet --

B.61:  Uh-huh.   

A.62:  -- [Inhaling] but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually,
you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a
burden.  She's very independent.  [inhaling] So she's in this nursing home.
It's out in the country and, uh, she really enjoys it right now [smack] because
she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook [laughter].

B.63:  Gives her a little bit of her own independence --

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  -- but she still has, uh, a security there.

A.66:  Right.  Some support.  And then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those
people that do get sick and, what I like about it and I think she likes about
it is that she knows everybody there now and then, so if she ever does become
ill, uh, it will be like family around her.

B.67:  That's right #and I# --

A.68:  #Yeah.#

B.69:  -- I've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of, uh,
activities going on for #the ones# --

A.70:  #Uh-huh# {very faint}.

B.71:  -- who are more active.

A.72:  Yeah.  Sh-, 

B.73:  So it's not sort of like, uh, #uh# --

A.74:  #Uh-huh# {very faint}.

B.75:  -- a sick place.

A.76:  No, she loves it.  She has a great social life and she travels and, uh,
it's in, in the ((very)) in the mountains and it's beautiful and, uh, [noise]
I, I hope that I have something like that #when I get older {very faint}.#

B.77:  #Yeah I,# I think, I think the, uh --

A.78:  Uh-huh {Very faint}.

B.79:  -- I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home
has to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly --

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  -- uh, person who's [noise] going in and the family that's going to be, uh,
effec-, effected by it --

A.82:  Oh definitely it's,

B.83:  -- and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those choi-, those choices can be
made in advance and #sometimes# --

A.84:  #Right.#

B.85:  -- the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're,
