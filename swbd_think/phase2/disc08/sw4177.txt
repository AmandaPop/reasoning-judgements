A.1:  Hi.  So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?

B.2:  Uh, actually no, because, because I'm in school.  I, I kind of miss out on
most of the current events.  I just catch the major ones off the news or if
someone starts to talk about it.

A.3:  Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?  

B.4:  Uh, I don't watch a lot of it, but that's the on-, basically that's my only
major source of information.

A.5:  Um.  

B.6:  What about, what about you?  

A.7:  Well, I read, uh, I get a bunch of different things.  I get a newspaper
every day and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that
and I look through, uh, I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much
read that cover to cover and I, as far as, you know, that satisfies most of
the short term news I get.  Uh, don't watch much T V, don't have enough time
and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or
anything like that, you know, they might give you a little blurbs like --

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  -- this happened or that happened and that's about all I ever hear of it.
Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK and for the longer term
I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some
of those other types of magazines that come out which, they, the news isn't,
like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news, but it's recent
material.

B.10:  And it's more in depth.  

A.11:  Yeah, it is, it is more in depth, less broad.  Well, actually, it's,
probably isn't less broad, but it's just more in depth and, uh, it is, it is
more sig-, it is more just significant information, you know.  It is the big
events, not the little events.

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad
and Main, you know.

B.14:  I know, where they're just trying to fill in.  

A.15:  Yes, or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth
of news.

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V
because --

B.18:  I know, I do, I do, too.  

A.19:  -- it goes so slow and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like
oh, so exciting.

B.20:  Yeah, you may find one little, uh, news item interesting so you have to
wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it.

A.21:  Yeah, that, that's about what it ends up being.  Listen to the news to hear
the traffic report or something [laughter].

B.22:  Yeah, actually, y-, you mention NEWSWEEK, I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS
AND WORLD REPORT.  I don't get to read it as much as I like, but that's, I
think that's a good magazine.

A.23:  Yeah, I think they're about the same.  I, you know, they, they certainly
have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.  And, uh, uh, what, what
kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you, I mean what do you,
what, what do you find interesting --

B.24:  Well -- 

A.25:  -- versus what do you find boring?  

B.26:  -- right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you
know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become
independent and, you know, European community coming together.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit.  

A.29:  I think it will, uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big
influence, but we've yet to see it and th-, it's real short term yet, though,
I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that --

B.30:  Oh, yeah.  

A.31:  -- since that happened so,

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  But they like to tell us that it's going to be important [laughter].

B.34:  I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh -- 

A.35:  I think it is, too.  

B.36:  -- once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big
economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah, I, I think that's a possibility, uh, it, we might also be helped,
though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too.

B.38:  Yeah, definitely.  

A.39:  For the companies that already have a presence over there and, uh, I know
of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a
presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it --

B.40:  Oh, yeah -- 

A.41:  -- came time.  

B.42:  -- so they have a toe hold, I good toe hold.  

A.43:  Yep.  Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand.  But
getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.

B.44:  Yeah, because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly
protectionist so,

A.45:  Yes.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very
protectionist, even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist,
you know.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  Like, England doesn't want to do one thing and, and Sweden doesn't want to
do other thing and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be
resolved yet.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  And some of it, I mean, is, I'm sure within those people's minds, it's
quite justified.

B.52:  Yeah, I, I can understand their viewpoint, they're just, they're starting
off, their economy's a little bit weak, so you want to --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- get established before they -- 

A.55:  Before they --

B.56:  -- com-,

A.57:  -- open up their borders to everyone.  

B.58:  Yeah, totally.  

A.59:  Uh, what is the, uh, do you watch anything like with sports or anything
like that?

B.60:  Actually I'm not really into sports.  My roommates are, so, unfortunately,
I forced to watch quite a bit of sports.

A.61:  [Laughter]. 

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  Against your will.  

B.64:  Yeah, we have to, fight over the remote control.  

A.65:  [Laughter] Yeah, at least you guys have a remote control.  

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  It's sometimes better to not have one of those.  Course, you can always
mislocate it.

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it and,
