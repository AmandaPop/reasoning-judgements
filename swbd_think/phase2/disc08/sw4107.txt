============================================================================

B.1:  So, well, uh, what are you guys doing with recycling?

@A.2:  Well, I mean, in D C there's a law that was recently passed that like, uh,
you have to [cough] [noise] it's a law I think that organizations have to
provide recycling.  I guess recycling bins.  They have to recycle.  It's a law
to do it.

B.3:  Yeah, they just, they just did the same thing up here.  Uh, the whole
county built a, uh, uh, incinerator --

A.4:  Right.

B.5:  -- actually, only two thirds of the county built it and they also, of
course, they had to, uh, the New York State E E C, the environmental people,
mandate that you have to recycle things, so.  Anybody who wants funding or
doesn't want their landfills closed and sued,

A.6:  [Laughter].

B.7:  has to, uh, recycle.

A.8:  It's like, uh, I mean, personally I have never been a recycling nut.  In
terms of, I don't, I don't go out of my way and I think that they put, uh,
receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me, uh, [cough] more apt
to do it because there, it's more convenient [sniffing].

B.9:  Yeah, a lot of people up here, the exact same way.  You know, they won't
lift a finger and, uh, it hasn't gotten around here th-, you know, you go to
any store or something and there is a trash can.  There isn't a bin for glass,
a bin for --

A.10:  Right.

B.11:  -- it's really just on the verge, it hasn't quite happened yet.  But the-,
you know, I was on vacation a couple of places, uh, Utah had some bins.

A.12:  Yeah, I am looking right here.  There's a waste bin, I mean for waste.  I
don't know, I guess they recy-, I guess they can recycle normal waste.  I am
not really sure and there's trash cans too.  I mean generally when I'm right,
when, if, I go by the waste bin, I'll put something in there if it says
[cough] they've got cans and bottles, uh, and bins for paper.

B.13:  So you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because
--

A.14:  No.

B.15:  -- you couldn't find a, uh, a bin for it.

A.16:  No, not really.  I mean,

B.17:  Toss it in the first place that it in, that you could find.

A.18:  Yeah, I mean, the-, when I am in, uh, our student center studying and I'll
go out my, I'll walk, I'll get up from my table and walk out of my way.  I
mean, they're right near the trash can.  So I'll toss it in the bin but, uh,
as far as if I'm walking the street drinking a soda, I finish it.  I am going
to toss it in the nearest trash can probably.  I mean it's convenient.  It's
there.  If the recycling bin is not there, I'm pro-, I'm, if it was there, I'd
use it.

B.19:  Right.  Well, I think, well, maybe that's a good way to, uh, promote
recycling is just to make it more available.

A.20:  Yeah, exactly. 

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  I mean in, in my dorm, it's in the basement, but I've found, (( )) ((pile
much)) in a giant bag, a shopping bag and then, uh take it down in the
basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can.  Uh, but yeah, I mean,
more receptacles, uh, around on the streets even would, would, uh, make people
do it.  If it's there, they are going to do it.  Still, I mean, some people
won't even go that far out of their way.  [throat_clearing] There are people
who are pretty ignorant and I mean, or are really set in their ways.

B.23:  Yeah, I guess, you know, my mom, she always recycled everything.

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  So, I am use to it.  But, if I was use to just throwing things away, it
would be a really tough habit to unlearn.

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  So, maybe, you know the next generation will be a little bit more
conscientious than we are [laughter].

A.28:  Yeah, I am sure they will.  I mean with, uh, the way things are going.  I
mean, uh, it's going towards a more green type of thing.  Green thinking, you
should call it. [Cough] People more aware, more aware they need
to save the environment and all that [noise].

B.29:  Of course, you are on a college campus --

A.30:  Right.

B.31:  -- where people are more aware than the general public.

A.32:  Oh definitely.  I mean there's been plenty of up roar about the, uh,
Marriott using, uh, styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing.

B.33:  Now that's really tough.  Because you read stuff and you can't tell whether
a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- than a paper one or some other plastic.

A.36:  Cause I mean, yeah the paper ones are, uh, plastic coated and they are
probably even worse.  I don't really know.

B.37:  Yeah, who knows what's #not.#

A.38:  #Harder to# recycle.

B.39:  And, uh, you know, if you put them in a landfill, they take up the same
amount of space.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  Cause the paper doesn't break down either.

A.42:  Well, I think it's possible to recycle styrofoam, but it's more expensive.
[cough] Uh, they do have reasonable cups that people can, uh, I mean basically
you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be, uh,
environmentally conscious and they, I believe they give discounts on, on drinks
if you have this cup,

B.43:  [Laughter].

A.44:  so it's kind of an incentive.  You have a discount on your, on the drink
instead of the regular price or whatever.

B.45:  Well that, that's good.

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  I mean, God forbid, you should actually, you know, have a cup and then wash
it out once and a while and then reuse it.

A.48:  [Laughter]  Right.

B.49:  Yeah, like, imagine that?  [laughter].

A.50:  [Laughter].
