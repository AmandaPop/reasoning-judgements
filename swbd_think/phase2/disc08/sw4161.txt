A.1:  So, you keep a budget?

@B.2:  Uh, [lipsmack] not really.  All I, I just have one commitment and that is
that at the end of the month that, uh, [lipsmack] that everything is paid and
that's basically my budget.

A.3:  That's your budget, hey?

B.4:  So, we use credit cards and, uh, let's see what else.  And when I get a,
when I get a, uh, a bill in the mail, I, uh, write a check out for it
immediately.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Put a date on the outside of the envelope and stick it in my little
Franklin (( )) and, uh, I carry it around and then on the day that I'm
supposed to mail it, why, mail it and that way I know how much I'm in the
hole.  So, basically my budget, uh, based on [breathing] if, uh, the bank
account is low, why, we don't spend very much.

A.7:  Yeah.  My, uh, wife and I, we're a new young couple starting out so we've
been trying to budget.  It's getting a lot, a lot tighter and we've actually
worked out a very extensive year long budget --

B.8:  Oh, wow.

A.9:  -- so we know exactly what we're going to spend when and when we're going
to have money and we've worked out a cash flow.  We just bought a house.
That's another reason why we're,

B.10:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.11:  #really keeping# track of the pennies and that stuff.

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter] And so we have this detailed budget, and in some ways it's
really kind of nice because there is not much of a worry or not much a
discussion or any real conflict over whether we should do this or that or, we
always have a, there's a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know
that we're going to have money to do what we said we're going to do.

B.14:  Yeah.  Now you have a consensus #ahead of time.#  

A.15:  #Yeah, we,# as my brother told me when he, he's in accounting and he
suggested we do this as we were making these big financial steps and all this
stuff but he said, well, you just do this and you fight once and, and,

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  that's it.  Once a year and that's it because you've worked out the budget
and what you're going to spend.

B.18:  Oh, that's very good.  I've, I'm, uh, I, I tried that in the beginning.
And when I say tried it I, we tried to sit down, there was no consensus.

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  [Lipsmack] Uh, we both agreed that, uh, how shall I say this, the best
consensus we could get was, uh, we're both are pretty thrifty and, and, uh,
[lipsmack] you know it just, it just, watch our, we just won't spend money,
uh, big items we'll [breathing] kind of talk to each other about but we have
two [breathing] who are playing, uh, Russian roulette I guess all that we've
been married.  Uh, how many years now, uh, [lipsmack] let's see.

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  Twenty-six, twenty-seven years #now.#

A.23:  #Doesn't s-,# sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out and
it's going to work just fine.

B.24:  Well, it's, what it is it's just a, kind of a commitment not to spend too
much,

A.25:  #Yeah.#

B.26:  #and,# uh, so, the, uh, but the, the budget idea sounds pretty good I think
if, if, if we ever head in one of these financial crisis, you know, like a,
oh, an emergency of some kind of job, uh, loss or something like that.  We'd
have to, we'd have to do that but neither one of us, uh, [lipsmack] are
predic-, what, what I do with her is I, we have two bank accounts.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  One I wanted to, uh, I wanted her to, uh, to learn how to balance her
checkbook because she's, she just, the, the best she can do is, is keep it,
uh, current so to speak.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  So what I did was I gave her another checkbook and I said okay y-, this is
your account.  You can have money anytime you want it, just tell me how much
is in your account.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  [Laughter] She said, no, you are trying to control me.  I said, I'm not.
You know you can have six hundred dollars in there.  If you want another three
hundred, just tell me.  And, uh, so finally we got, we have one of these, uh,
things where we get money.  The company puts, makes a direct deposit.

A.33:  Yes.

B.34:  So I give her what she wa-, [breathing] she gets, uh, like a third of the
money for the household and I pay everything else.

A.35:  Yeah.  Well, we've done, see, we've only been married three years and I, my
wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what I
did is I just gave it all to her and I said you have to do it, everything.
And then I come in and help her.

B.36:  I think that's good.

A.37:  And, uh, that's been really good because it's, you know we've both come to
appreciate and understand what's going on.  And she does most everything now
and it's really quite nice actually.  [laughter] And, uh,

B.38:  I think that's good.  On-, one of my, uh, friends suggested that, that life
would be a little easier around our house even yet if I had her do, do that
because,
