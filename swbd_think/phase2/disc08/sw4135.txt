===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, so what is your, w-, why do you people don't vote in the elections?

@B.2:  Well, first of all, I think they understated the turnout.  It's, I don't,
I don't think that in a national election, it's ever been under fifty-three
percent.  Well, it's, it's, it's almost half.

A.3:  [Child_talking].

B.4:  But it's been, you know, it's somewhere in the fifties for sure --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- so it, it, it understates it a little bit.  Why do people not vote?  Uh,
well,

A.7:  [Child_talking].

B.8:  [Breathing], it's [laughter], the analysts usually say they don't think it
will effect anything.  They're certainly wrong about that.

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  Uh, I think that, that it's easy if you, if, if you think things are going
bad enough to just turnoff to the news and just not pay any attention.  It's,
the less you pay attention, the less you know about what's going to effect
you.

A.11:  Yeah, yeah.  I, I think, I think apathy is, is real big thing, I mean, just
in the fact that you don't think you're going to have anything done.  I, to
me, it's really hard to find, uh, [breathing] any information on the
candidates.  I mean, I voted yesterday and --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- and, uh, [breathing] h-, half the people, you know, you really have to
hunt --

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- to get information on them and, you know, as far as the local things go
--

B.16:  Oh, yeah.  

A.17:  -- and if, you know, if you don't know them, then,

B.18:  That's right, yeah, and I, I, I agree.  Uh, I have made calls,

A.19:  [Throat_clearing].

B.20:  to various organizations the night before elections.  Well, one thing I d-,
[laughter] I usually do is go to the library and study for an election
[laughter] before it.

A.21:  Really?  

B.22:  Yeah, and, and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  And, that -- 

A.25:  That's a good -- 

B.26:  -- helps a little bit.  

A.27:  -- idea.  

B.28:  They don't ask their, they don't ask enough questions.  They ask on one or
two issues and, and --

A.29:  Yeah [noise] {water running}.  

B.30:  -- m-, people can respond with platitudes.  What you really need to do
[throat_clearing], excuse me, is find interest groups that, that, you know,
who's inter-, whose issues you are interested in, and then find how the if
they have done a candidate survey, and lots of times they have, and then you
have something to base it on.  [lipsmack] There was a, back when I was living
in Pittsburgh, there was a group called the association for public justice.  I
don't know if you've ever heard of them.  Per-, [/noise] {water running} --

A.31:  Huh-uh, huh-uh.  

B.32:  -- perhaps not, i-, it's, it's, it, they, they really didn't, you know, it,
it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group, well, they were a little
bit liberal on some things, but they were a little bit conservative on some
things, too.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  And they put out this, this, p-, uh,

A.35:  [Child_talking].

B.36:  survey of candidates where they asked them like, uh, eight questions, uh,
all the candidates for all the offices.  [inhaling] Now it wasn't that great
in that they didn't tailor the, the question for, you know, for the particular
office, so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at
the national level and vice versa --

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  -- but, uh, other than that,

A.39:  [Noise].

B.40:  it was a very good way to [clanking], to see who you sympathized with and
you could vote on the basis of that.

A.41:  Yeah, I, that's, uh, I don't know what it was that we had, that I had
yesterday, got it from someone in our church --

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- that, uh, it, it asked, uh, it went all the way d-, well, it went to
some of our constables, but mainly it was in the Dallas area and --

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- not in the Plano area, but, uh, it asked, it had all sorts of questions
about, uh, economics, uh, education and, and, uh, [lipsmack] uh, [lipsmack]
family and,

B.46:  Th-, things, things like abortion, presumably.  

A.47:  Yeah, yeah, but it had other things like, uh, do you, would you support,
uh, I know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was, was would you support,
uh, a, a two thousand dollar, uh, [children_yelling] tax credit for --

B.48:  Yeah, right.  

A.49:  -- women that stay, you know, at home --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- and, and so it had kind of a variety of, [noise] of, uh, [lipsmack] of
questions and it, it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it.  It was
really, y-, that was really good and helpful and it, you know, it had them,
you know [children_yelling] sup-, if they could support --

B.52:  Uh-huh {faint}.

A.53:  -- op-, oppose or, or, you know, be undecided --

B.54:  D-,  

A.55:  -- about it.  

B.56:  D-, do you know what group did it?  

A.57:  Yeah, it was, it was, it was, uh, I thought it was really good, but, you
know --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- it, course, [child_yelling] it doesn't go through all the candidates --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- and, some of them, [clanking] you know, you think, well, this guy's,
this guy won't have --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- any, [child_yelling] won't have any, uh, say so about any of this
anyway, but it's kind of good to know their opinions anyway if they, you know,
run for a different kind of office.

B.64:  That's right.

A.65:  [Child_yelling].

B.66:  Because, y-, yeah, I mean, once they,

A.67:  Once you're in politics, [baby] you probably stay in politics, I would
think.

B.68:  Yeah, that's right.  That's, that's one point that was made that, that, you
know, uh, I read one article saying, even if you don't that abortion makes any
difference at, uh, you know, at a, at a really local level like City Council
or something like that, these people will, in the end, they might get elected
to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected
these le-, to these, to little offices --

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  -- so you got to look,

A.71:  [Baby_crying].

B.72:  at their views and, and that was a point that I hadn't considered.  The
reason I ask about the organization is I just got, uh, started working last
year in an organization called Christian Coalition which does just what you
were suggesting --

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- and I #was wondering ((if it was))# -- 

A.75:  #And that may have been who# --

B.76:  -- #if it was theirs.#

A.77:  -- #had done it.#  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  I'm, I don't remember, uh, [lipsmack] I had like, three or four different
things I was looking at --

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  -- uh, and that was, that, that was probably the most helpful.  I wish it
had been [baby] more detailed.  I know that, uh,

B.82:  [Laughter] See the candidates don't like to respond to all these questions.

A.83:  I,
