=========================================================================

B.1:  You want to start or should I start?  

A.2:  Uh, yeah, you go ahead.  

@B.3:  Okay, let's see, uh, I think that, uh, I, I think that trials by jury are
a good idea.  I just think the concept of multiple attempts [laughter] at
trial is w-, uh, with when they're always saying oh, well, uh, uh, I want to
appeal, I want to appeal, I want to appeal, I, I think multiple appeal is what
our real problem is.  It's not the, not the, the twelve man jury trials.  Uh,
I think that, that I, I would not be totally adverse to the concept of, of,
uh, of, uh, I guess, uh, uh, judge trials either.  I think our, our, we have a
real big problem with litigation.  We, we spend too much of our time
litigation in our legal system and,

A.4:  Oh, yeah.

B.5:  [Laughter]

A.6:  It's, it's just in-, incredibly complex.  Uh, I, I don't have any problem
with the idea of having the jurors, although, it is a bit disappointing to see
the attorneys manipulate the process by, uh, raising so many objections to
jurors so that they can try and get for their client, uh, a jury slanted one
way or the other.  I mean, you can sit there and dismiss people for, for
trivial reasons and, and that takes up a good deal of time, too.  Uh, the, the
thing I find sort of disappointing about, uh, a lot of this is that often a
judge [breathing], uh, and, and you hope you get one that's, that's really
rational and, and looks at, uh, each case separately.  You'd like to be able
to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence, uh, if it's a really
awful crime, to really put the person away for a long time.  Uh, or if there's
a lot of intent there and it's obvious, put them away.  On the other hand, you
know, maybe to, to change the sentencing slightly.  Uh, that you'd like be
able to see them, give a different kind of punishment, uh, not necessary
community service, that's getting a little bit overworked, but, but, but
rather some of other sort of, of restitution rather than simply putting them
away behind bars.

B.7:  Uh-huh.  Uh, ((trial)), well, one thing is we do not have a trial by peers
anymore.  Uh, that's, that, that is g-, gone out, gone out the door.  For one
thing, the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury
[laughter] as part of, in fact as part of the process does not supposed to
know anything whatsoever about the trial so particular --

A.8:  Oh, yeah.  

B.9:  -- f-, so particularly for famous trials, what that indicates is that the
only people who are really at that jury are idiots [laughter].

A.10:  [Laughter] People that have been on the moon [laughter].  

B.11:  Right, only ignorant people and that means low I Q generally [laughter].
Wherein that's not, that's not trial by jury.  Now, I guess that's, that,
that's become less so.  I've noted that, uh, uh, the last couple times that
I've had to go by jury, they've actually selected intelligent jurors.  Now I,
I, I'm not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of, uh, of, uh, some
notor-, no-, no-, [lipsmack] notoriety, uh, but, in the case of the normal
trials, it's much, much harder than it used to be t-, than to get out of it,
so they do try not to let, uh, excuses get you out of, uh, trials now.  You
can --

A.12:  Oh, yes, my, my,

B.13:  -- delay it, but you can't get out [laughter].  

A.14:  Oh, that's, that, and, and that's actually pretty good.  My, my mother
recently, uh, uh, had jury duty, uh, down in, in Texas --

B.15:  Uh-huh.  

A.16:  -- and, uh, the, the judge would not hear any excuses, I mean from anybody.
Uh, he didn't care if they had doctor's appointments or anything.  He said
you're, you're here in the pool and you're going to serve, but when it came
time for, and, and it turned out it was a rape trial [breathing] --

B.17:  Uh-huh.  

A.18:  -- uh, and the, uh, uh, the attorney asked my mother, well, uh, how do you
feel about this, and she told him, quite frankly, that she thought that the
punishment should be extremely severe --

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  -- for a rapist and then the guy began to ask, uh, what does your husband
do for a living.  Well, he's retired Air Force.  Uh, was he retired law
enforcement Air Force?  They, they dismissed her on the grounds that they
didn't want her, that her husband could have been seen as being in law
enforcement even though he was a programmer,

B.21:  [Laughter]. 

A.22:  [Laughter] in the Air Force.  They wanted to stay away from anybody that
might even have a smidgen of law enforcement.  So even though she was there to
do her duty, to serve --

B.23:  Uh-huh.  

A.24:  -- she was dismissed on the grounds that she might possibly, remotely have
some prejudice and that's, my mother's fairly well read.  She didn't actually
know about this local case.  It was of rather small import, uh, but I would
agree with you that, that, not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant
not to know, but they'd have to have met,
