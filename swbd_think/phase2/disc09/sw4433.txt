A.1:  Is crime a problem in Arlington?

@B.2:  Uh, actually, we live out in Gainesville, Virginia.  

A.3:  Uh.

B.4:  And, uh, my wife is originally from the Bronx so for the longest time, we
didn't have any, any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we
lived way out in the country here. #And, uh# --

A.5:  #Uh-huh.#

B.6:  -- then, you know, over the years we have visited her folks and her folks
have, probably, the most impressive crime reduction system I've ever seen on
any house.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  You know, they have grates across every single window.  They have probably
three or four dead bolts on every door.  Uh, just a-, a-, amazing array of,
uh, you know, sort of security measures on their house.  I mean it's harder to
get into their house than it is probably [laughter] a lot of minimum security
prisons.

A.9:  Well [laughter].

B.10:  So, anyway, now she's turning our house into sort of the same thing
[laughter].

A.11:  Huh.  #Well,# 

B.12:  #We# have, uh, we have like grates on the, on the, uh, door, on the
basement windows --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- even though there is very little crime in this area.  And we just had a,
a guy come out, a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of
reinforce all of our dead bolts and, uh, put new locks in ((them)), some doors
and fix our french doors up so that they were, you know, secure.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  So.

A.17:  Yeah.  It, it's too bad.  You mentioned, uh, your in-laws place as, as
being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Th-, that's what crime is doing in the cities.  It's turning those of us
that live in the cities into prisoners [laughter].

B.20:  Yeah.  #What's it# --

A.21:  #(( )).#

B.22:  -- like in Dallas.

A.23:  Uh, actually I'm in a suburb of Dallas where it, it's safer, in general,
than it is in the big city.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  It, uh, I think it's like most cities.  And that is the high crime areas
are the ones where there's more poverty.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  The, you know, that [laughter] there's always one part of town.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  Uh, whether it's the Bronx or whether it's a certain area in Dallas or
whatever.  Uh, I, I think that's where the crime is concentrated.

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  #But,# gosh, we jus-, there was just one over in Fort Worth.  A woman was
killed and her husband was, uh, badly injured.  And they've charged th-, uh,
the husband's daughter with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her #dad
and st-, [laughter].#

B.32:  #Oh man.#

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Incredible.

A.35:  Isn't that incredible?  And, I mean, uh, that's, that's crime that's, that
you don't usually think about.  I mean, yo-, if, if you're going to carry on a
conversation about crime, you know, you think of the hardened criminal that
keeps, uh, attacking again and again, if you will, whether, #you know# --

B.36:  #Yeah.#

A.37:  -- depending on what his game is.  Maybe it's an armed robber that does it
all the time.  But this is, uh, huh [breathing].

B.38:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's clearly, I mean, they're not in category of business
criminals.  I mean, there's, there's criminals who are in just because that's
their business, #you know.#

A.39:  #Oh, yeah, yeah [laughter].#

B.40:  I mean that's their trade essentially and you know, then there's, then
there's really random of violence.  We actually had a, a woman who was very
close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to, you know, beef up our
own security measures here.  Uh, she was a couple of houses away.  And her
husband travels a lot and is gone, you know, for weeks on end.  And she was
upstairs with her, uh, child and heard somebody say hello, hello from
downstairs.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  So she immediately calls nine one one and, uh, the (( )) County police come
over and, of course, the woman kept her on the phone the whole time.  Which I
thought was a really good security measure because, you know, if you can get
nine one one in Gainesville, Virginia, you know #[laughter],#

A.43:  #[Laughter].#

B.44:  you're probably, you know, I mean it's probably a pretty effective thing,
you know.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  Uh, so anyway, the police showed up and they told her, the person on the
phone told her to run, you know, take the child and run downstairs and to let
the police in cause they were at her front door.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And, so she did that.  And when she opened the front door, she had just
bought this new German Shepard puppy which had apparently, you know, gone all
over the floor.  So the, the policeman stepped into the front door and
actually started sliding around #on, you know, the dog mess and she,#

A.49:  #[Laughter].#

B.50:  yelled, simultaneously, yelled look out, which the policeman thought was
like, somebody's about to shoot me.

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  So, you know, he's like spinning around in this stuff, #you know.#

A.53:  #[Laughter].#

B.54:  I mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway, it, when the guy finally
regained his balance, you know, he's just like get out of the house lady
[laughter] and stop trying to help me #[laughter].#

A.55:  #[Laughter].#

B.56:  But, anyway, later on, it's, it's going to, it's, sh-, they didn't find
anything.  I mean, apparently, you know, if the guy came in, he ran out.  And,
and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the
remote control on the T V which just doesn't make any sense at all.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  The odds of that are just really unlikely.  But, I actually went over about
a week later.  He was back home and she was on travel and he had locked
himself out.  And I went over and within, I would say, about five seconds got
into their garage door.

A.59:  Oh.
