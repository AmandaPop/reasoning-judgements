=============================================================================

A.1:  [Laughter] Do you have a particular attitude about public education?

@B.2:  [Hum] [TV] Okay.  Well, I have one child that is in public school now.  I
have three children that went to a private school and then we put them into
public school system and I think we did them a big disservice by putting them
in public schools.

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  Um, I think that they, my child now is in public school and we're getting
ready to put here into a private school because of it.  I just don't feel like
th-, they're getting enough out of it, you know.  For,

A.5:  Academic?

B.6:  [/Hum] Yes, yes.  I just don't think that academically they're, and the
school systems here is supposed to be really good.  They have, I don't know if
you're familiar but Texas has, uh, oil money that finances their school
system.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And there, there's no state taxes paid here.

A.9:  Oh, I didn't know.

B.10:  So the money from, the taxes from the oil go to pay, go towards the schools
and the running of the schools.  So they're supposed to have a really good
program.  But, uh, I don't know.  I just feel like, my daughters are in
college now and the last three years of their life they went to public school.
And they made straight A -s.  And they're really struggling in college now.

A.11:  Um.

B.12:  And, uh, I think that has a lot to do with it.  I, I don't know where,
where you can fix it [laughter] you know.  #What you need,# 

A.13:  #Well, apparently# in your state there's more incentive to send your child
to pub-, uh, to a private school.  Because in New York, you pay taxes for
public schools and then if you want to send your child to private school, you
pay again.  We-, 

B.14:  Yes, well you do that here too.  You pay higher, uh, property taxes for the
area that you're living in, depending on the school #and the area you're in.#

A.15:  #Oh, okay.  I# got the impression you said the oil money paid for the
schools #so.#

B.16:  #No, it,# it supplements the schools --

A.17:  Ah.

B.18:  -- that, therefore there's no state income tax --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- that goes towards, uh, the school systems because of that.  You know,
because of that.  But the property taxes that you have on your home, depending
on what area you are, you know, like they're higher in --

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  -- certain areas than they are in other #areas# --

A.23:  #Right.#  {Very faint}.  

B.24:  -- you know.  #But, uh.#

A.25:  #I don't,# I don't have any experience myself with private schools so I
really can't say they're better.  I did go to public schools and what I'm
finding, uh, right now I have two kids and I'm going back to work.  And I'm
substitute teaching in public schools.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  And what I see in the high school is, I don't know that it's public,
private.  I think times have changed.  I mean I know that I would never not do
my homework because lightning would strike me.  #Something terrible# --

B.28:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

A.29:  -- would #happen.#

B.30:  #Exactly.#  Yeah.

A.31:  But nowadays, the kids don't do their work and they have the nerve to say
to you, so what are you going to do.

B.32:  Exactly.

A.33:  And you're not going to #do anything.#

B.34:  #Well, there's no# disciplinary actions #that, you know# --

A.35:  #But you,# 

B.36:  -- can be, uh, taken against them at all.  

A.37:  Yeah.  I think #the# --

B.38:  #Yeah.#

A.39:  -- most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is
to, to maybe go backwards in some ways.  Uh, I find the teachers trying to be
like the kids.  Uh, telling their k-, I teach art, and they'll go, yeah,
that's cool.  Well, maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should
learn to act like grown-ups instead of the grown-ups [laughter] trying to act
like the kids to get their acceptance.  I find the teachers are very concerned
about being liked.

B.40:  Being friendly, being friends #with the kids.#

A.41:  #Being,# being friends with them.  And --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- you know, they don't want to be so strict.  They don't want to be so
hard on them.  And I find that the kids are not turning in quality work
because there is nothing to impress upon them that they better.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  And, you #know th-,# 

B.46:  #I# think that that's right.  I think, I think a lot of that right there.
And, and I think that that's where you come into the private schools.  The
private schools have more power, you know.  I mean, because in public schools,
these people really don't have any authority to do anything.  Or to really
punish these kids in any way.  I mean, they can't even hardly give them
detention, you know, without #having to call# --

A.47:  #Well, maybe they'll make them,# 

B.48:  -- their parents and have their parents [laughter] come in and all this
kind of stuff.  I mean #it really is# --

A.49:  #Well, you know.#

B.50:  -- a major thing.

A.51:  Yeah, well maybe they'll make them stay home for a day.  But that's no
[laughter] torture for a kid [laughter].

B.52:  No.  Really.  Exactly.  Yeah.  To stay home is like, oh yeah [laughter].

A.53:  And I know kids.  If they, you know, if they're late enough, often enough,
they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents
because their parents work, so --

B.54:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.55:  -- you know, it's not a problem.  And I find that #you know,# 

B.56:  #They send, uh,# it because they send the report cards an-, and failing
notices and stuff home in the mail?

A.57:  Uh, yeah.  Well, th-, they s-, yes that's true.  #The-,# 

B.58:  #Progress# reports.

A.59:  #Progress reports.#

B.60:  #Well, see up# in Oklahoma now they do that.  But here they don't do that.
They give these progress reports to these kids.  My son is a senior and he
failed a class this last six weeks.  And I'm [laughter] like, Kevin how could
you?  But he didn't even tell me, you know.  And so I called the school and
like I didn't even know that he ha-, was failing this class.  And, like, but
we sent the progress report home with him.  Well do you think he's going to
give it to me?  I mean [laughter] you think he's #he may be failing a 
class# --

A.61:  #Oh, sure they# [laughter] --

B.62:  -- but he's not an idiot, you know #[laughter].#

A.63:  -- #Yeah, they# never have homework.  They always did it in school I have a
fourteen year old son who is just getting into, #you know,#

B.64:  #[Laughter].#

A.65:  realizing that he can dupe me #[laughter], I think.#

B.66:  #Right.#  Right.  I know I,

A.67:  But I, I think the, the public school, it's not that the teachers are
inferior or that the materials are inferior.  I think what's going on is that
the teachers have to be backed up.  When the kids don't do what they're
supposed to do, uh, the teachers have to have some way to,

B.68:  Well, they have to have parental support.  #Parents have got [/TV],#

A.69:  #They need the paren-,#
