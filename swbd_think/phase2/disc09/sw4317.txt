==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.   

B.2:  Well, ((Steve)), do you take your entire, uh, family camping? 

@A.3:  Well, we really haven't been camping per se, here, but we've camped in
Wyoming [talking].

B.4:  You have, do you take your children with you?  

A.5:  Oh, yeah.  

B.6:  Yeah.  I got, uh, one child.  He's ten years old.  When we go camping, uh,
we normally have to round up another child to keep him [laughter] occupied.

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  [Laughter] Oth-, otherwise, he drives us nuts.  

A.9:  Yeah, well, that, that's basically the same way with us, but, we, we kind
of play games and stuff with him [noise] while we're camping.

B.10:  Do you, do you wilderness camp?  

A.11:  Uh, yeah, I have before I, uh, got married.  I haven't since I've been
married, though.

B.12:  Your, your wife doesn't like that wilderness camping, does she?

A.13:  Well, she, she likes to go camping, but we just haven't really had a chance
to really go camping.

B.14:  My wife thinks Holiday Inn's wilderness camping.  

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  [Laughter] She, uh, she got to have a bathroom and showers.  We live on the
lake, uh --

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  -- there's a very large lake here, it's called Lake Lanier, it's in north
Georgia.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  [Throat_clearing] My house is on the lake, so there's a lot of places to
camp a-, around here where the, they have rest rooms and showers and stuff
like, but the lake's really crowded, so we normally go to the mountains.  We
found some nice little places in the mountains.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  There's a lot of state run camp sites now.  

A.23:  [Child_whining].

B.24:  ((This)), they're charging us now.  Do they charge you in Texas?

A.25:  I'm not sure if they do or not.  It's -- 

B.26:  Oh. 

A.27:  -- uh, I think, uh, some of the privately owned places do, but I'm not sure
about the government owned.

B.28:  Oh, they do here.  They, they, uh, you pay taxes to support it and then,
uh, you pay to get in, too.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  You know, like a user fee, I think they call them now.

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  So, I don't know, do you all, do you fish and go camping, you take a boat
or,

A.33:  Well, no, not really, we just usually kind of go camping and tent and cook
and, and just fish off the shore.

B.34:  Yeah, is it, uh, do you, uh, load the car down till the springs are
dragging the ground?

A.35:  [Laughter] .

B.36:  [Laughter] We do.  We g-, we, we got, uh, my wife is putting tables and
chairs [laughter] and,

A.37:  Got to have --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- the comforts of home, huh?  

B.40:  Oh, yeah, it, we have a hard time getting the, uh, recliners bolted on
high, on the car, too.

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Well, it takes three days to load the car and three days to unload it, and
we camp for about a day and a half.

A.45:  Yeah, I, I can understand that.  

B.46:  Uh.  

A.47:  But, we really don't, when we go, we kind of plan everything out, and we
don't, uh, [squawking] take a lot of stuff with us, so,.

B.48:  Yeah, w-, how old are your children ((Steve))?  

A.49:  Oh, we just got a five year old.

B.50:  A five year old, boy that's rough to camping then, when they're five,

A.51:  [Child_yelling].

B.52:  isn't it?  

A.53:  Well, not really.  He's pretty good, you know, he, when he, we ask him to
do something, he usually does, goes and does it.

B.54:  Well, w-, when,

A.55:  [Child_laughing]

B.56:  uh, ours is, like I say, ten years old and I think they might be a little
bit more hard to handle, too.

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  You got to keep them occupied, ((and then)) plus you end up with the fish
hooks in your ears and stuff like that.

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  [Laughter]. 

A.61:  Well, I kind of, I kind of got, (( )) got Tim to where he's, uh, just got a
weight on the end of his right now, so [child_talking] he really doesn't know
what catching fish is like, so he just kind of practice casting right now.

B.62:  Well, that's all they care about anyway.  

A.63:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.64:  Casting, that's all my boy cares about.  

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  Seeing how for he can throw it.  

A.67:  [Child_talking] Yeah.  

B.68:  I try to explain to him fish can swim.  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  [Laughter] He don't believe,   

A.71:  But, before I came in the service, my dad always took us camping in the
Bighorns in Wyoming.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  So we did a lot of that just about every year with the family so,

B.74:  [Sneezing].

A.75:  it was,

B.76:  We drove, we drove through there and looked.  

A.77:  [Talking].

B.78:  That looks like it would be beautiful out there.  

A.79:  Oh, yeah, it is.  Well, one, one summer we went in July and went camping,
and one morning we got up, there's snow on the ground.

B.80:  [Laughter] ((Sort of)),

A.81:  So [laughter] that kind of surprises you, you know.  

B.82:  Yeah, I don't know if I could take that.  Last time we went camping, I went
with my brother and his wife, and we went the, on top of this mountain there's
a little narrow road --

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  -- and it takes, it's just eighteen miles, but it takes like a hour and a
half just to get up that road.

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  It's a rough road.  So we get up there and we sit around and get ready to
get ready for camp that night and, and they didn't bring the poles to hold
their tent up.

A.87:  [Laughter]. 

B.88:  [Laughter] So we're all had to cram this one little tiny tent, and it
rained all night long.

A.89:  Oh, that's [laughter],

B.90:  [Laughter] And I was stuck at the door and it just, it just flooded me all
night long.  This, so that was been,

A.91:  [Child].

B.92:  our last little camping experience.  

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  But, uh, we enjoyed it.  If, if you don't get pneumonia.

A.95:  Yeah, it's, it's pretty nice to get out and see the wilderness every now
and then, you know.

B.96:  Well, there's getting less and less of it.  

A.97:  Oh, yeah.  

B.98:  I think,
