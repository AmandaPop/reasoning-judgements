==========================================================================

A.1:  So, it's kind of an obsolete question at this point since there isn't a
Soviet Union any more but,

@B.2:  Right.  Yeah, first of all I think that we have to agree that former
Soviet Union.

A.3:  For, for right, right.  We can say the, the soon to be former, uh, Common
Wealth and Independent States instead.  Is that,

B.4:  That, that's true too on that one.

A.5:  Um.

B.6:  Well, I, I personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got
nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us.

A.7:  Well, I, I don't consider them so much to be a threat any more in terms of
them using it as that we are already starting to see demonstrations in a very
cash starved country, you know, those (( )) people, the commodities that can
be sold to people.  Who I, I worry a lot more about than [laughter] the Soviet
Union.

B.8:  That that's very true.  I would agree with that also.  #Or,#

A.9:  #You# know, I mean we already have the case where they had those, uh, guys
selling ura-, trying to sell uranium on the open market.

B.10:  [Smack] That, that part is very true.  There's also the, uh, the problem
of, you know, the scientist, that will, you know, need money also and, #and
they can be very rich by ((it)).#

A.11:  #Yeah and it's I,# I've been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get
them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so
they don't go to Libya or somewhere like that.

B.12:  Sure.  I mean yeah.  So I, I think there is still a lot of threats there.
I'm not sure if you can, once again, like you said, it's kind of obsolete is
that the Soviet Union is threatening us though.

A.13:  Right.  I, I think actually, you know, except for the fact that we have to
be due west of them and we get a fallout cloud.

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  I don't think the the probability that we're going to be involved in the
first strike of anything.  It's, it's fairly high, but you know there's
certainly a lot of people arguing there right now who all have nuclear weapons
and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign, uh, republics who are
a lot of Islamic.  Some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they
break off and de-, de-, fo-, for instance decide to align with Iran or Iraq,
then suddenly we are in a very difficult position.

B.16:  Sure.  Another problem that would worry me somewhat, uh, would be that say
they were to use the nuclear weapons themselves --

A.17:  Um.

B.18:  -- you know, in another area --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- since there are, is some, you know, disagreements between the different
Common Wealths --

A.21:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.22:  -- uh, you know some very different etiologies in there also, it, if they
were to use them there, what would all of our ((audit)) detection and what not
type [laughter] systems, I mean, what, what's the chance for accident in that
case also.  On top of the fallout factor.

A.23:  Right.  And then of course, the other things is you've got them arguing
over their nuclear subs and all of that so there's not a (( )) question whether
one of the, uh, sub drivers is going to decide to become free lance.  #Well# --

B.24:  #Right.#

A.25:  -- I don't, I don't want to go with Russia, so, I'm going to, uh, you know,
sell myself to the highest bidders or something.

B.26:  Absolutely.  So yeah, that's that whole thing is a very scary thing.  The
detabulation the destabilization --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- yeah, what, what a chug on that one.  Uh, the, uh, [laughter] you know
the Soviet Union's been a a big concern.  It's a scary thing.

A.29:  Right.  You know, the, the other possible scenario, of course, is that in,
in it's going to be hard for the entire area to have electricity between
Russia, especially now there's a lot of hard liners coming back, cause the, the
economic reforms aren't working.  We could find ourselves right back in the
same position again.

B.30:  Sure.

A.31:  The only thing that I think we have got, going for us is we have a very
large stick in the form of economic aide and technological aide and a lot of
the Republics seem to be more interested in getting the aide in than having
the nuclear weapons.

B.32:  Tha-, that's very true.  Uh, you know, granted, you know The Cold War was a
very strange thing, but at least it was a non commodity.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  You know, we knew what we, you know, we knew what we were up against
[noise].

A.35:  Yeah but I, I have to say that the prob-, overall things are instead of the
unstability in the area are actually sta-, more stable than they before
because I think inherently our the, the chance that we are going to be involved
in it and I think it's fairly low.  I think none of them are foolish enough to
want to attack the United States.

B.36:  Well, especially now that they're divided.  They're not bigger than we are
anymore.

A.37:  Yeah.  [swallowing] I mean all of them are looking to us for help, not for,
not looking to us for, you know, uh, invasion at this point [noise].

B.38:  Yeah, I think it is very true, uh, you know, or once again even the ones
that aren't necessarily looking for help from us.  You know, they are getting
massive amounts of help or wanting that from Germany and from other, from other
Third World Countries.  So that, that would probably also keep, you know,
blatant, uh, uh, you know act of war out of the, uh, picture.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  So you know, I, I think it's more going to be I don't think we're
looking at, at potential for anything large scale.  Uh, you know, I think
there's certainly some people in, in the U S government who would like us to
think that they're still a threat.  Uh, you know, I was listening to M P R
yesterday talk about the Sea Hawk submarine and you know, I'm saying, you
know, wait a minute here, why do we want to build like two or three
multibillion dollar submarines.  You know, and the reason ((it'll keep))
people out in Connecticut alive but, 

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  I, I think that there's there are people in government interests who would,
whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may
not be one anymore.

B.42:  Sure.
