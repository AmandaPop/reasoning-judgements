========================================================================

A.1:  John, I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment.  

B.2:  [Throat_clearing].

A.3:  How about you?  

B.4:  I am.  I, yes, and, uh, [inhaling] uh, what was the first part of the, uh,
subject?  [breathing] D-, d-, w-,

@A.5:  Well, I, do you think it should just be restricted to certain crimes?

B.6:  Oh, I, I basically.  I think, uh, other than murder, uh, the, probably, I
don't think there's a need for it if, uh, if it's not, if the case is, doesn't
involve murder, I don't see any need for it in anything else, any other
circumstances.  I guess it's an eye for an eye [breathing].

A.7:  [Laughter] Well, there are those that say it's not a deterrent to others,
but I think it certainly deters --

B.8:  Oh. 

A.9:  -- the one [laughter] that, uh -- 

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  -- gets the capital punishment.

B.12:  Well, yeah, I guess the other argument is that you might execute the wrong
person, but, uh, I don't know, I just think the chances of that happening are
pretty slim.  Course, it's [laughter], it's not reversible, uh, obviously,
but, uh, I just think the way the system is set up, uh, the chances of the
wrong person being executed are, are really very small.  Uh --

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  -- I've served on a few juries and they take a, they seem to take a lot of
care to make sure they've got the, uh, the right person --

A.15:  That's,

B.16:  -- whatever, for the conviction levied.  

A.17:  That's true.  Well, certainly Texas,

B.18:  [Throat_clearing].

A.19:  uh, as a state, believes in capital punishment.  I don't know.  I wonder if
we execute more people than other states or,

B.20:  I don't know, you, every once in a while, if you hear, if there's some
who's fairly famous or notorious being executed in another state, you read
about it or hear about it, but, uh, I don't know how we rank up there with the
other states.  But, uh, I think it's a deterrent.  I, I don't, I mean, it
wouldn't be a deterrent for everybody, obviously, but I think, uh, if it, uh,
[lipsmack] if it saves one person's life, it may be worth it.  Uh, if one
person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the, uh,
possibility or, possibility of capital punishment, it, uh, it may be worth it.
But, I think it's a deterrent.

A.21:  Yeah, I think so, too.  

B.22:  [Throat_clearing].

A.23:  Uh, and, and we fail so miserably in rehabilitating any kind --

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  -- of criminal.  

B.26:  Right.  

A.27:  And I, I don't know, I wonder if there are other crimes, uh, a repeated
rapist for example.

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Or [breathing], uh, I don't know.  Kidnapping, of course, is a capital
crime.

B.30:  W-,  

A.31:  But I,

B.32:  Is that, uh -- 

A.33:  I doubt that,

B.34:  -- is that punishable by death in Texas or is that -- 

A.35:  I,   

B.36:  -- up to the jury to decide or -- 

A.37:  I don't know.  

B.38:  -- the judge.  I never thought about that.  

A.39:  Don't know.  

B.40:  But, is that, is that a capital crime?   

A.41:  I think so.  

B.42:  Huh.  

A.43:  But, maybe not, maybe not.  I could be confused.  What do I know
[laughter]?

B.44:  [Laughter]. 

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  Don't hear much about,

A.47:  I'm not a kidnapper [laughter].  

B.48:  Don't hear much about kidnapping anymore, kidnaps.

A.49:  Well -- 

B.50:  Uh,   

A.51:  -- there have been a few over in, I g-, I, not recently I guess.

B.52:  But the, uh, the whole judicial system is a mess.  Like you said, there's
no rehabilitation in the prisons and so they get out of prison and they're,
they're back to doing what they were doing before they went to prison.

A.53:  That's right.  

B.54:  They haven't learned a lesson.  

A.55:  Well, I certainly don't agree with a, with a murderer getting a sentence of
twenty years and being out in seven or whatever it is.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  I think that's -- 

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- just totally inappropriate.  

B.60:  Yeah.  Well, like you said, rape, uh, that, there's a possibility there
for, uh, capital punishment and that, that's a serious enough crime that, uh,
it maybe warrant capital punishment, but what gets me is the, uh, I may be
getting off the subject, somebody might get forty-five years for stealing, I
mean for robbing something.  Course that, I think to get that they'd have to
be a repeat offender.  That would be more than one or two cases involved.  But
the, the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided --

A.61:  Yeah, you don't -- 

B.62:  -- messed up,

A.63:  -- so you don't think that cap-, that capital punishment is appropriate for
repeated robber or,

B.64:  N-, no, no, I really don't.  Uh, no [breathing] murder and, again, rape
possibly, a repeated, uh, rapist may be, uh, a candidate for capital
punishment, but, uh, the really serious stuff, I don't, this burglary and
robbery and, uh, that sort of thing --

A.65:  Now,   

B.66:  -- even if they're multiple offenders or repeat offenders, I, I wouldn't
condone capital punishment for that.

A.67:  Yeah.  I, I don't know what the consensus in the state is.  I know, it was,
it was a few years ago that the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment,
didn't they?  Didn't they tell the states to go back and review the
circumstances?

B.68:  Yeah, yeah, that, uh, it was, it was, uh, there was no capital punishment
for a long time there, I don't know fifteen, twenty years maybe.

A.69:  Something like that.  

B.70:  And, uh,  

A.71:  (( )).

B.72:  I know when I was growing up, there was, uh, there were a lot of, uh,
electrocutions up in Sing Sing, up in New York, upstate New York, and then,
uh, they did away with, like you said, Supreme Court outlawed it.  And then it
came back on a state by state basis.

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  But, uh,
