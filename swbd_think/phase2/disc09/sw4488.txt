==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, so where do you stand on gun control?

@B.2:  [TV] Where do I stand?  Well, if, uh, if ten means absolutely no control,
I don't think I buy that.  But I guess I'd be, maybe, a six.  I think that we
probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible.  Uh, I, myself,
own one.  I shoot nothing but paper targets.  But I don't think anybody has
the right to tell me I can't possess one.  I don't think, uh, if I'm
responsible my kids can't get a hold of them and I certainly wouldn't use them
for a crime.  I think the people who do use them for crime aren't the people
who bother to get a, a license.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, what are your feelings?

A.5:  I'm, I'm more in favor of, of, uh, restricting them.  But, uh, [breathing]
as far as getting a number, it's a little hard.

B.6:  Yeah.  I-, it is a, uh, just picking it out of a hat.

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  Uh, but do you feel that no one should be able to own any?

A.9:  No.  N-, cause people like to hunt and, and s-, you know, in some cases I
think it's, it's a good, uh, I mean it's a valid reason to have one for
defense.  Although, you know, the statistics about, uh, accidents, uh, it's
kind of, uh, worrisome.  I mean I wouldn't, I know I don't like the idea of
having guns around a lot because they're mostly used, [throat_clearing] I
mean, to, they cause a lot of a-, they, there are a lot of accidents because
of them being so handy.

B.10:  Okay.  Well I don't know what the laws are in your state.  Uh, in order to
get a license I was thoroughly checked out.  It took over seven months to get
myself approved.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, you need all kinds of references.  You need, they check your criminal
record [laughter] and all this #other stuff.#

A.13:  #((I'm not sure)).#

B.14:  Uh, they restrict, uh, when you can carry it.  You can just take it to a
range and back home again.  If you want to hunt, you need a special hunting
license.

A.15:  Huh.

B.16:  Uh, I, myself, am no fool.  I didn't want to hurt myself.  Why would
anybody [laughter] #want# --

A.17:  #No.#

B.18:  -- to take a chance.  It is a dangerous thing.  I took a, uh, National
Rifle Association course on how to, uh, handle one.  I keep it locked.  I keep
the bullets somewhere else.  Uh, I personally feel that if someone came into
my house, I would be too much of a nervous wreck to #shoot# --

A.19:  #Um.#

B.20:  -- them accurately.  And I wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were
wandering around so I really have no, no thought to use it for protection.  I,
you know, I'm more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than I am and would
use it against me.

A.21:  Um.

B.22:  Uh, I think the guns that are there hurting people are held by
irresponsible people.  Uh, I don't believe that there should be, that you
should be able to walk into your local supermarket [laughter] and buy one.

A.23:  No.

B.24:  I mean, any bozo could [laughter] get one then.  And then it would be,
indeed, scary.  Uh, I, you know, I just like the sport of shooting at a
target.  It's the kind, it's sort of like weight lifting.  It's something that
you can judge yourself against yourself.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And, uh, I, I agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet  flesh
is really revolting #[laughter].#

A.27:  #[Laughter].#

B.28:  I mean I personally can't even see hunting, you know.  I have no use for
Bambi (( )) [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah.  It, it's kind of brutal.

B.30:  Right.  But, I mean, we get hamburger in a package and then, (( )), we
forget it came from an animal #but# --

A.31:  #Oh yeah.#

B.32:  -- I choose to forget.  I'm a hypocrite myself [laughter].  Uh, wo-, what
would you think of the notion of, you know, just taking up a gun for target
practice?  If you were trained.  D-, does that revolt you in any way?

A.33:  No.  I've, I've actually done that with a friend of mine with his gun, 
#uh# --

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#  #Did you# --

A.35:  -- #and he,# 

B.36:  -- feel unsafe?  

A.37:  No.  No.  The, uh, the thing is, wh-, if I have one handy though, then if
I'm or I can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying, uh, I
just, I want to go for the gun.  I know where it is.  It's easy.  And then
#pulling the trigger# --

B.38:  #((Then it's too late)).#

A.39:  -- is so easy that, uh, well.

B.40:  Well, you know, I think it's, i-, I think, uh, you talk to someone else,
they say yeah I think everybody should have a g-, I should have a gun and
nobody else [laughter] should because I know I would act responsibly
[laughter] --

A.41:  Huh.

B.42:  -- but you, you never know about the other #guy.  And I think# --

A.43:  #Right.  Uh-huh.#

B.44:  -- that's part of the reason why people ar-, is so fearful.  Because it's
true.  Someone might get drunk and not think.  #Uh.#

A.45:  #Right,# right.

B.46:  You know I don't believe in no laws.  I think that would be a scary kind of
thing.  But well that's how I feel [/TV].

A.47:  So, (( )) in Massachusetts, they, uh, they have, uh,
