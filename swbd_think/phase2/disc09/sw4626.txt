=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [laughter].  

B.2:  How are you?  You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you
budget #[laughter]?#

@A.3:  #((Yes)).# Yeah.  Well i-, I, I, I feel like, uh, I am from Mars.  I mean
I'm fifty years old and, uh, I've been divorced for, um, eighteen years.  But
I've two kids and all.  But I, uh, I, I've never had a budget and I don't, uh,
do any planning and I don't know,

B.4:  [Noise]. 

A.5:  (( )) I don't, uh, uh, I don't have a long-term financial plan.  I don't
try to control my expenses.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  But I'm, I'm glad you're a stranger.

B.8:  [Laughter] That sounds kind of like me.

A.9:  But, really, I'm, I happy, I, I, well I'm curious how other people live.
Uh, so maybe we should start with you [laughter].  What do you do?

B.10:  About the same thing.

A.11:  Really?

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Oh.  Maybe they're going to arrest us both.

B.14:  I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children and, uh, we live from
hand to mouth [laughter].  We hope that there's enough money at the end of the
month to pay for the bills and if there's not, then we [laughter] (( )) due
for the next month.

A.15:  Wow.

B.16:  A couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but I'm not
disciplined enough [swallowing] to keep doing it.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and,
uh, took my check and divided it out into envelopes --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the
envelope was empty [laughter], then you didn't have any more money to spend in
that area.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down
what we'd spent.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  [Swallowing] It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of
money.  And we did that pretty successfully for about three months and then we
started [laughter] borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do.

A.25:  Huh.  The, uh, I had a part-time job around, oh gosh, fifteen years ago,
seventy-six,

B.26:  [Noise]. 

A.27:  and, uh, uh, this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so I was
willing to take a half time job to do that.  And I actually did, my bank
account would, uh, I'd, I, I kept bouncing checks, just at the end of the
month but I, I had miscalculated.  I, well I didn't keep a balance [laughter].
It's one of the problems {speaks this very faintly}.

B.28:  [Laughter].  

A.29:  I never had to in the past.  

B.30:  [Noise].

A.31:  I always kept plenty of money in my checking account, but when you're only
earning half the salary.  Even though I wasn't spending much money, I
sometimes I sometimes would just, things would get to tight.  Uh, and
sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time
I, uh, I spent money, I mean cash mostly, I would, uh, write it down --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could
do better planning.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  But I would forget to write the things down and it, that I, I don't know if
I ever went as far as three months or not [laughter] i-, i-, in keeping that
kind of data.  I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.

B.36:  I even find now like with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of
that --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- and then I forget to take that [laughter] out of my checking account.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And, uh,

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  So I, I, I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I
figure that, so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat
different that what's really there.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  The, uh, I, i-, I have to say that, let's see, at this point on, I
don't run out of money.  Uh, and it, uh, a-, and I don't, I mean someday, if I
were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money
which I don't have and I, I, I think my strategy if, if I may, i-, i-, is to,
is to not spend money.  I mean I don't have expensive tastes.  I don't go out.
I mean I buy a car, well the last car I got rid of I'd had, it was nineteen
years old.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Pe-, people were embarrassed for me.  #I mean it was, it was a good car
and,# 

B.48:  #[Laughter].#  ((But it was)) still running.

A.49:  Oh, it was great.  My, my mechanics loved it because it was an old, it was
a sixty-five Buick and it just wouldn't stop.  Uh, and it, I, I just didn't
feel the need for a new car.  It isn't like I couldn't afford one.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  Uh, and now, I mean I, I don't, uh, I tend to eat expensive food.  I mean I
don't mind buying a good steak but for me, I only do that every week or,
without even,

B.52:  [Child_talking].

A.53:  I mean, maybe once a month.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  I mean you buy a, a tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, like twelve
dollars a pound.  You buy a, a, less than half a pound so it's six or seven
dollars.  To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out
and do that.

B.56:  [Laughter] Not very often [noise].

A.57:  But, but I'm just, I'm just saying as a single person, that's, that's a
drop in the bucket.  And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it
doesn't add up.  If you're buying, I mean if you're not going to super
expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to.

B.58:  That's right.

A.59:  So, so that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I
don't have, I don't, I don't have to hold myself back from buying that
expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that
expensive thing.

B.60:  ((A lot of)),
