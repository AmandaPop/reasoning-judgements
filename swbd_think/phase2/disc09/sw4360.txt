A.1:  [Clicking] [talking] [breathing] Uh, [lipsmack] let's see.  How about, uh,
let's see, about ten years ago, uh, what do you think was different ten years
ago from now?

B.2:  [Static] Well, I would say as, far as social changes go, uh, I think
families were more together.  They, they did more things together.

@A.3:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.4:  Uh, they ate dinner at the table together.  Uh, the parents usually took
out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now to come with the children
and just spend the day doing a family activity.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, although I'm not a mother, I, I still think that, uh, a lot has changed
since ten years ago.  Uh, what #do you# --

A.7:  #We,# 

B.8:  -- think about that?

A.9:  Well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short.  

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Uh, [lipsmack] but I do agree that, uh, generally it's, society has sort
of, uh, let's see, rushed everything ahead.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  And, uh, I don't know, it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and
things like that.  In other words, they just prioritize their lives
differently.  But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation.

B.14:  Yes.  What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?
#Do# --

A.15:  #Uh,# 

B.16:  -- you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say,
ten, twenty years ago?

A.17:  Um.  It depends.  Uh, it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten
twenty [laughter] years ago too.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  Uh, [lipsmack] I just [sigh],

B.20:  Well, how, how old are you?

A.21:  I'm twenty-eight.

B.22:  Twenty-eight.  Okay, I'm twenty-three.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  So there's maybe a five year gap between us.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  So, uh.

A.27:  I just, I think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along.
It's #just# --

B.28:  #Huh#  {Very faint}.

A.29:  -- a matter where priorities are, at placed.

B.30:  Yes.

A.31:  And that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be
just one person working and usually the other parent was home.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most
places for both parents to work.

B.34:  Do you think it's an economic c-, necessity or do you think that we're,
we're, uh, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living?

A.35:  I think that's part of it too.  But I do think,

B.36:  I mean do you think,

A.37:  [Sigh].

B.38:  people really need two cars and --

A.39:  No, no.  #I don't.#

B.40:  -- #a house# in the suburbs or,

A.41:  No, I don't think that.  But then there are a lot of people that, that
don't have that.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  But, that really do need to work.  

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  I think maybe those people that really do need to work, both parents, just
to [sigh] survive.  #And# --

B.46:  #Yeah.#

A.47:  -- then there, th-, is, is that other group #that is# --

B.48:  #Uh-huh.#

A.49:  -- working to maintain a standard of living --

B.50:  Okay.

A.51:  -- that, uh, they think is, is surviving [laughter] which is really more
luxuries.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Uh, but I [sigh] I tend to think that it's less those people that have the
two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive.

B.54:  Yo-, so you think it's, which group are you saying #is the one trying?#

A.55:  #I'm saying that# the, uh, the group that is just trying to survive from
day to day, where both parents are working --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- is more of the majority than the, than the people that have the higher
standard of living.  Because if you look at economics across this country and
statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, uh, middle class in
this country --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- I think that that's, in my opinion, the case.  

B.60:  Okay.  

A.61:  So.  I mean I have met people that, uh, both that, [sigh] that just want to
maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that really need the job.

B.62:  Okay.  And then, sometimes I, I often, uh, find that maybe there's so many
different things available to us. Yo-, a microwave, a V C R, a answering
machine --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of
those items, um, for the, for the, uh, well I guess we're sticking more to
social changes but, uh --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- people want all of that and not all of those are necessities.

A.67:  Right [/breathing] [/talking].

B.68:  So they're trying to, it has become a necessity [/static].
