===========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of pollution do you have in Flagstaff?

@B.2:  [Talking] Well, we have the, the usual automotive pollution.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Although it's not very visible.  You don't worry about that, uh, too much.
Uh, but, uh, we have a lot of wood smoke here.  Now I heat with wood so, uh,
I'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a, is a so-, source
of pollution.  But there are people in this community who, who think that, uh,
it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the
point of being part of the pollution.  And, [talking] and, uh, we're very
close to the, uh, Grand Canyon --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- where the air pollution is a very big issue.  Because, [chiming] uh, of
pollution, well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the Los Angeles
area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the Four Corners power
plant --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- up near Page, Arizona.  Uh, but because it's a national park that's a, a
big issue there.  Uh, [cough] {someone in background} here in Flagstaff
actually, uh, it, it's something that's unique to us, the, the biggest
pollutant that we have in our air, is cinder dust.

A.9:  I'll be darn [laughter].

B.10:  And that's because, [talking] uh, we're in a volcanic region [swallowing]
and we, uh, we have dirt roads, uh, in a lot of areas that are covered wi-,
with cinders.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  But they also use cinders on the highways in the winter time in place of,
uh, using salt or substances like that, that they might in the eastern part of
the country.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it, we
get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air.  And as of, you know, the,
the largest quantity, that's the biggest pollutants that we have to, to deal
with here.

A.15:  Yeah.  Well, I, I'm sure that cinder, 

B.16:  [Noise].

A.17:  dust is pretty unique [laughter].  

B.18:  Yeah [laughter].

A.19:  Uh, in the Dallas area, of course, the, the biggest issue of air pollution
is just automobiles.

B.20:  [Noise] Huh.

A.21:  Uh, we don't have much in the way of heavy industry.  I mean this is a
center for electronics and banking and insurance and, you know,

B.22:  [Noise] [cough].

A.23:  businesses like that, which are not typically bad polluters [laughter].

B.24:  [Noise] Right.

A.25:  But, uh, so I, I'd think that you'd have to blame most of it on the
automobiles here.

B.26:  Does, does Dallas sit in any kind of, uh, uh, I've been there but I don't
remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that, uh, where you get
temperature inversions that, that capture air pollutants or anything like
that?

A.27:  We have, we, yes, we occasionally have them (( )).  They're not, not too
significant but they do o-, occasionally occur.  Uh, one source of pollution
for us [laughter] is the dust and sand in, uh, west Texas.

B.28:  Sure.

A.29:  In the spring time we'll have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas.

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  I'm serious.  These enormous clouds of sand or dust or whatever you want to
call it.

B.32:  I laugh because,

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  I made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And then continuing east, uh, to the eastern coast of the United States
and, uh, I joked that, uh, all of the settlers settled in eastern Texas where
the green rolling hills are.  #And, and,#

A.37:  #[Laughter].#

B.38:  when they finally beat the Mexicans, the Mexicans said fine.  You can have
east Texas but as l-, only as long as you take west Texas #too [laughter].#

A.39:  #Okay [laughter].#  All right, I can understand that.  #It's# --

B.40:  #Yep.#

A.41:  -- interesting though that you mention the, uh, wood stoves.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  [Noise] I grew up in New Mexico and, but that was long enough ago that, uh,
people didn't really [inhaling] heat that much with wood.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  That was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will.  Uh, but now
in New Mexico, heating with, with, particularly pinon pine is really an issue.

B.46:  Right.  #It,# 

A.47:  #Not# only from the pollution point of view but it takes many, many years
to grow those trees.

B.48:  Yes.

A.49:  And people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them.  Uh,
and it, it's such a distinctive smell when it burns.  I had forgotten it.  I
mean #[laughter],#

B.50:  #[Laughter].#

A.51:  I, it's one of those smells you forget.  But then when you step outside
your mother's house, you go, oops, yep, somebody's burning pinon [laughter].

B.52:  Here in Flagstaff, uh, juniper is the, the very distinctive smelling wood
that you can smell in the wood smoke.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Uh, and one of the issues here, uh, which gets into forest management but
has an impact on, on air pollution is that, uh, we're surrounded by the
largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  But people don't want to burn ponderosa pine.  They want to burn oak, which
is very hard to find in this region, #or# --

A.57:  #Oh, sure.#

B.58:  -- juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood.  And, uh, aspen.  Uh,
it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat.  Uh, and ponderosa,
[swallowing] we also have pinon but, uh, uh, it, like ponderosa, is very
dirty.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  And so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great
abundance of ponderosa pine and the forest service is r-, saying we really
wish that we could find a way to make it, uh, less of a [/talking],
