===========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think?

B.2:  Uh, I don't know.  Uh, regarding, uh, should the judge do the sentencing or
not.  I think the judge should have some influence, but I don't think the
judge sh-, I think that's too much power in the control of one person.

@A.3:  I agree.

B.4:  #I-,#

A.5:  #I# really agree with that.

B.6:  Uh, it just doesn't seem to make sense that if the trial is by a jury #of
your# -- 

A.7:  #Right.#

B.8:  -- peers that the sentencing should be somewhat along that.  #I, you know,#

A.9:  #Right.#

B.10:  I guess the judge should give the parameters and then the jury should work
kind of within there and if they feel exceptional, one way or the other --

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  -- do you know what I mean?

A.13:  Right.  Yes I do, I, I have been thinking about this.  You're about the
tenth person they tried to call for this [laughter].  

B.14:  #A-, oh, is that right?#

A.15:  #So, I've# had lots of time to think but yes I do because, uh, otherwise,
why have a jury.  #That's the# -- 

B.16:  #Right.#

A.17:  -- point.

B.18:  It seems to, granted you're found guilty or innocent by a, a group of pe-,
of your peers but then the punishment, you know, can be very, very severe
depending on the judge's personal, uh, #predilections# --

A.19:  #Right.#

B.20:  -- to that.

A.21:  Right.  I think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- than you do with a judge #and that's# -- 

B.24:  #Yeah.#

A.25:  -- that's been my [laughter] experience and, #and I really# --

B.26:  #I, I, wo-,#

A.27:  -- think that.  I think that judges are very prejudice to just their own
idea and they want to get it over with.

B.28:  Right.  I mean they're human.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  They're going to have their, their pet peeves and they're going to have
the things that they really care about or don't care about --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- uh, so let a group of people ha-, you know, try to, try to m-, m-, you
know, use that, make that decision.

A.33:  Yeah, I would feel much more confident if that were me so.

B.34:  Unfortunately though, it does string out the, uh, process but #you 
know.# 

A.35:  #Well, it does# but I think it's because people are trying to be
conscientious where a judge, it's their job and they just want to speed it
along #and get it# --

B.36:  #Yeah.#

A.37:  -- done and I don't think they stop and think about that individual as much
as a group of people would.

B.38:  Right.  See, I --

A.39:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.40:  -- I also think there's a problem with the plea bargaining system in our,
#in our# --

A.41:  #Yes, yes.#

B.42:  -- country in that you can, uh, plead to, even though you're guilty of 
sin --

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  -- [Noise] excuse me, you plead to a lesser crime.

A.45:  Yes, #yes.#

B.46:  #[Swallowing] I# think that, that, in itself, is a sin.

A.47:  I think that we're having a lot of problems, uh, with just everything.  And
the whole, the whole system is bugging me.  It really is.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Our jails are over crowded with people like Leona Helmsley --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- who is seventy-two years old and, with a blank check in front of her, I
don't think should go to jail.  I think the punishment should fit the crime.
I think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous
and I don't think they should get out on parole in three years.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  I think they should stay there.  They did it, they stay.

B.54:  Yeah.  #I, we-, I,# 

A.55:  #And people# with traffic tickets and that,

B.56:  [Throat_clearing].

A.57:  there's another way to handle that #I think.#

B.58:  #Yeah.#   

A.59:  #So.#

B.60:  #Um,# although I'll tell you, th-, there is something about that woman, uh,
her crime was, is what they quote, call a white collar crime, as opposed to
blue collar {mispronounced} crime such as cr-, stealing, uh, well, as, but she
stole.

A.61:  Well, yes.  But if you look at it in relation to the amount.  I mean it's
one million dollars which to you and I sounds exorbitant --

B.62:  It's a lot #of money.#

A.63:  -- #but compared# to the six hundred million that they paid in five years
that's like one dollar when we owe six hundred.

B.64:  That, #they# -- 

A.65:  #So.#

B.66:  -- the si-, the six hundred million that they what now?

A.67:  They paid tax-, six hundred million in taxes over that five year period.

B.68:  Oh, I see what you're saying.

A.69:  Yeah.  #So# --

B.70:  #Yeah.#

A.71:  -- if you look at it, they don't say that very much in the newspaper.

B.72:  Well, no.  But they also diverted, uh, millions, uh, to their own personal
assets that were hotel monies.

A.73:  Well possibly, you know, I don't know, but if they're willing to correct
it I, I don't, I don't see that she belongs in jail the same as somebody who
goes out and kills and walks away.  I mean, there are worse things that
#people# --

B.74:  #Oh# --

A.75:  -- are getting off with, you know, #that kind of thing.#

B.76:  -- #see, yeah, I have to,# I agree with that.

A.77:  #Yeah.#

B.78:  #There# are worse things that people have been getting off with, but I
don't think that, that we then should have Leona get off.  I think that they
should be hit even harder.  See, I'm an advocate of the death penalty myself.
Now I don't know of a lot of people that are, well there are and there
aren't.  And --

A.79:  Well,

B.80:  -- I just happen to feel that if somebody does the crime --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- I mean, if they murder somebody, if they take someone's life --

A.83:  Get them out of society.

B.84:  --  I just #don't# -- 

A.85:  #Yeah.#

B.86:  -- feel like I have to pay my tax dollars to have them in jail.

A.87:  I know, I agree --

B.88:  I,

A.89:  -- with you --

B.90:  #Yeah.#

A.91:  -- #agree# and,

B.92:  I just, it's a tough line but I don't think the way we're executing the,
the capital punishment is, is a deterrent, although I think capital punishment
is a deterrent.

A.93:  I do too.

B.94:  If it's done right and that means that this is the way it is.  

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  No ifs, no ands, no buts.  #A cert-,# 

A.97:  #It has# to be a consistent thing.

B.98:  Right.  

A.99:  #Yeah.#

B.100:  #A# certain number of appeals and then that's it.  

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  Don't stretch it out for years.  Get it over with and get it done.
