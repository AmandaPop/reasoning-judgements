==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Let's see.  Do you live, uh, do you live in a neighborhood that,
uh, has been affected recently by any, uh, crimes?

@B.2:  Uh, let me see.  Not recently.  I, we're, Framingham is, uh, midway
between Boston and Worcester and it's mostly {mispronounced}, mostly in Boston
[sigh] that we're finding a lot of problems.  Uh, basically, it's lined up
blacks versus whites and there have been a lot of murders and mostly boyfriend
girlfriend type of thing.

A.3:  Yeah.  We, uh, n-, Portland is, is pretty, uh, how shall I say it, they
have a lot of problems but the problems are con-, confined to low income
neighbor-, well I shouldn't say low income neighborhoods.  Uh, neighborhoods
where a lot of low income families live and, and, uh, where there's a lot of
drug and, uh, broken families and things like that.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Uh, that doesn't, I try to, uh, in my thinking, to keep from blaming it on
the, on the nationality of the people and more blame it on the culture of the,
uh, broken families and, and, uh, drugs and things like that.

B.6:  Right.  I think drugs plays a really big part.  A lot of times it doesn't
come out in the paper or on the news, uh, you know, they're more into, as far
as the news reporters, into oh, you know, two black guys killed each other or
they knifed each other {mispronounced}, other to death and we have a lot with,
uh, gang problems.

A.7:  Yes, the gang problems.

B.8:  Yeah.  #Tha-,# -- 

A.9:  #The, the,#

B.10:  -- that seems to be the major thing and we just recently, with all the
problems that there are in Boston, we did have, I was thinking, we did have
one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar and, uh, her
kids woke up, she brought him home, and her kids woke up and she was dead.
She had been knifed to death.

A.11:  Oh, my goodness.

B.12:  And he was a homeless person but why anybody would want to bring somebody
like that #home, you know [laughter].#

A.13:  #[Laughter]# Too many hormones, huh.

B.14:  Really [laughter].

A.15:  Too much alcohol [inhaling].

B.16:  I think that was th-, the major part of it.  Too much alcohol and she just
invited him in and he waited until she was sleeping and then let her have it.

A.17:  Yeah, just kind of a psychopath.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  The, the crime problem is, uh, I don't know if, if you're, this is, uh,
about a four hour topic but a five minute, uh, window here so the, for me, I
feel very bad about, uh, the people that are affected, uh, the people in the
crime ridden areas are more innocent in some cases, uh, than, than the press
f-, well what I'm really trying to say is, they are working class people who
work #very hard# --

B.20:  #Uh-huh.  Right.#

A.21:  -- and are seriously affected by that.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And, uh, so even though I see, uh, how shall I say it, uh, the problems of
crime affect the black working class and, uh, minority working people --

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  -- #much# worse than they affect me.  Uh, so the, the crime problem has to
be solved.  One of the problems that I see is that, and they always compare,
[sigh] uh, America.  They say well, in America we have, uh, you know, a gun
problem and, uh, uh, that, I, I read a discussion once of, of, uh, the reason
why England, for instance, uh, has, their gun problems and other problems are
so low and it basically boils down to they don't have, the Bill of Rights
doesn't exit for those guys.  If you are standing at a corner and somebody,
and the bobby walks up to you and he says you've been standing here, four
busses have gone by, uh, you're a pickpocket.  Empty your pockets.  #If he# --

B.26:  #Huh.#

A.27:  -- finds some things in, in there, then they will proceed to your house
perhaps, and, uh, say open your door up, and go in and search your house and
after that, they can enter at any time.  Now that has the advantage of, uh,
weeding out, how shall I say it, of getting rid of the Dandelions before,
they've, they, uh, populate your lawn.

B.28:  Right.  

A.29:  But, [laughter] it, it just doesn't function in our court system over here.
We, we won't allow you to be, uh, frisked by a cop, uh, without good reason.

B.30:  Yeah, I think that's wr-, I think that's where the law has got to change
because they've found, uh, how many people have we read about or heard about
in the national news that have been picked up and because of a technicality,
they're left, let off.

A.31:  Yeah.  #(( )),# 

B.32:  #You [laughter]# know.  And that's really not right and then they go out
and do it again, you know [laughter].

A.33:  That's right, and, and, like I, my earlier example, uh, uh, 

B.34:  [Noise].

A.35:  I could spend every day, all day just picking the heads off of 
Dandelions --

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#

A.37:  -- #uh,# once I let my lawn get infested. 

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  Uh,
