talked low.

==========================================================================

A.1:  So, uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?

@B.2:  Ooh, well I don't know.  What do you think?

A.3:  Oh, I don't know.  I had a little bit more time to think about it.  I
was thinking of, like, uh, [sniffing] I don't know, I was ju-, started to
think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the
information about you on them like the credit reports --

B.4:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and all those, you know, demographics studies that they do that,
[swallowing] um, you know, have, who knows, how much, you know, stuff about
all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere and
[sniffing] I don't know, I don't know how much the stuff actually, what they
actually have in there but --

B.6:  Huh.

A.7:  -- I know they use that, I mean they #sell those,# 

B.8:  #Well what about,# uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of
employment?

A.9:  [Sniffing] Yeah, that was, that, that was the other one I was thinking of
[sniffing].  I think that's, uh, I mean I know #drugs [noise] are illegal.#

B.10:  #It (( )) thing# actually.  Uh, I, uh, have worked at Texas Instruments.

A.11:  [Noise] Huh.  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And, uh, they instituted a drug policy there.  Drug testing policy where
they randomly would test, uh, employees --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about
it. I, I hadn't, you know, it really didn't relate to me.  But there were some
things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false
positive, you know, what recourse do you have.

A.15:  [Talking] Uh-huh.

B.16:  And, [throat_clearing] also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the
government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity and
yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments, although
they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about
as a result of government pressure.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  So [throat_clearing] what that means is, to me, that really it's the
government that's requiring this, although they don't actually e-, execute it
themselves, it's really the government that (( )).  So, in that sense, it, at
least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  Well [talking] I, I think the, I think that, you know, a person's
competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their
behavior and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know,
contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the
job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able
to evaluate them.  I think they should be evaluated that way rather than
[sniffing] with a, you know, a chemical, #you know,# 

B.20:  #Well, what about# this, uh, AIDS epidemic now?  Where you find that, uh,
uh, you know, certain people are actually are, are criminal in their disregard
for it-, --

A.21:  [Sniffing] These people that are carriers and #don't# --    

B.22:  -- #others.#  Yeah, and --

A.23:  -- that don't reveal it?

B.24:  -- and, uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain
so that it doesn't,

A.25:  [Sniffing].

B.26:  it, uh, it destroys their libido.

A.27:  [Laughter] ((Yeah, tha-,)) that would be kind of an extreme.

B.28:  Now, uh, #you know if they ever,#

A.29:  #I mean I've# heard of things like, you know, making them, you know,
marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know,
putting them all someplace like in a #kind of,# 

B.30:  #So what# about that as an invasion of privacy?

A.31:  Yeah.  Wel-, I guess it kind of borders on where, I mean what do you value
more.  The invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to,
you know, other people.

B.32:  So really, it i-, gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the
general welfare --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- of society.

A.35:  I guess that's alwa-, that's been the big role of government, I guess
[laughter].  #I mean generally.#

B.36:  #Well, it, it's supposed# to have been. 

A.37:  Yeah [laughter].  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into.
I mean that, that particular case.  

B.38:  [Throat_clearing] ((No, it)),

A.39:  Because I mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, I mean they could
require, you know, [swallowing] ob-, obligatory AIDS testing for everyone
because I'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population, not a huge part
but a, you know --

B.40:  A growing part.

A.41:  -- the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do --  

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- are spreading it.  But, again, to require, you know, such a test and
jus-, and then to make, make it (( )) is to subject them to, to discrimi-,
discriminatory practices and other things.  I don't know, uh, I don't know how
exactly I feel about that.

B.44:  ((Maybe)) chop their weenies off.
