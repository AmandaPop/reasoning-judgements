=======================================================================

A.1:  So, Cathy, uh, do you keep a monthly budget?

@B.2:  Well, we, we do of sorts.  It's not a, it's not a family budget.  Both my,
my husband and I work and what we do is basically treat each income as
separate.  Uh, partly, we didn't want to fall into the trap of arguing over
the family money, oh, yeah, well, you know, I earned this much and therefore I
have the right to spend that and, well, you know, you overspent the, the total
budget.  This way, each of us knows what's in our own bank accounts --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- so you can, if you want to write a check for somebody's birthday
present, you don't have to worry about the other person seeing it, that sort
of thing.  But, uh, what's neat is that, uh, my husband keeps a spreadsheet
of, uh, the income and he submits a bill to me every month, an itemized bill
and I --

A.5:  Wow.  

B.6:  -- pay that and then, so he has track of both of our expenses.  I pay part
of the utilities, he pays part of the utilities.  It takes a little bit more
work, but it does work for us.  I mean, i-, it really does work very
successfully for us.

A.7:  Do you have any kids?  

B.8:  Yes, I'm [laughter] juggling one right now on my [laughter].  Uh, we have
a, uh, almost one.  He, he'll be one on [child_crying], on April second.

A.9:  Well, I can hear him right there.  

B.10:  You can hear him, and the one is four and he's off taking a bath
[laughter], so, uh, yeah, we've got two kids, and, uh,

A.11:  So, how does that work into your budget?  

B.12:  Uh, well we're,

A.13:  As far as planning for expenses and so forth.  

B.14:  Well, in terms of, of immediate expenses like clothing, uh, I purchase
those out of my income and I get reimbursed fifty percent of that by my
husband, so, again, I submit bills to him [laughter], receipts to him
[child_talking].  Uh, for the day care, uh, what we do is actually take that
directly out of my income.  Uh, and my, my company has a, uh, a pretax medical
deduction, uh, medical and, uh, child care, uh, all together, so that, that
helps --

A.15:  Um.  

B.16:  -- f-, for that planning.  

A.17:  You wouldn't happen to work for Liberty Mutual, would you?   

B.18:  Excuse me?  

A.19:  Liberty Mutual?  

B.20:  No, no, no -- 

A.21:  Okay [laughter].  

B.22:  -- a biotech company as a matter of fact.

A.23:  That, that's my company and that's exactly what we have.  

B.24:  Yeah, and it, it works out, it works out really well.  Now, in terms of
long term, like college expenses, uh, right now we don't have something that's
set up that's labeled college.  We have, uh, more along the lines of, uh, sort
of investment plans in each of the children's names.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And they were set up as, as first birthday presents or, or, or even newborn
presents from the grandparents just, the, the actually assembled and set up,
uh, all the investment decisions are, are now ours.  But, in terms of
retirement, that's the one area that, that is, is still a little sticky,
because y-, y-, you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies
and we spent so much time trying to, to make sure that the boys are okay
[laughter] that, you know, for our own retirement, there's not a whole lot
actually organized.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  But we do have the things through our companies so that's, that's a start,
anyway.

A.29:  Yeah, this is a the first year that, actually the first month that I've
actually instituted a budget, uh, for my wife and I.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  For the,

B.32:  [Child_crying].

A.33:  previous nine years or so, we've just pretty much let it slide, uh, there
really wasn't much problem as far as income versus expenses.  Uh, things are
getting a little bit tighter, uh, we bought a house last year, we bought --

B.34:  Um.  

A.35:  -- a new vehicle, things that, which weren't a problem before, have, have
all sudden noticed our cash flow is starting to decline a little bit, you
know, with all the monthly bills and, uh, uh, so far it's working out pretty
well.  You know, we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week.  But, like I
said, being one of the first months we really won't know for a few more months
down the road how well we're doing.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  But your plan, where y-, you submit bills, that's the most itemized plan
I've ever seen or heard anyone talk about --

B.38:  Um.  

A.39:  -- as far as married couples.

B.40:  Well, it's not, it's not actually too bad.  

A.41:  #Interesting.#  

B.42:  #Once you get the,# the spreadsheet set out my, m-, my husband has,
categories for things like utilities, uh, you know, other expenses, uh, the
rent and my contribution.  I don't make as much financially as he does --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- so my contribution is prorated.  It doesn't come, it doesn't come fifty
percent out of my pocket when I don't make fifty percent of the income.  You
know, which is nice --

A.45:  Fair enough.  

B.46:  -- it's fair.  Uh, so actually, what, what happens is that we gather all
the bills and then write them down and then, uh, w-, uh, after that it's just
a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates, you
know, I mean, it, it takes the percentage that's necessary and he prints out a
bill and I write a check and that's it.  Uh, once it's set up, it works, it
works reasonable well.  So, i-, most of my friends though, when they find out
about it, they, th-, they think, your husband submits a bill to you that's,

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  that's, that's weird [laughter].  It's really weird, but, we don't, I mean,
I,.
