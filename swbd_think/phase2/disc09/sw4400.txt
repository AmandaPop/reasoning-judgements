A.1:  (( )).

B.2:  Yeah.  Uh, do, do you do any work on your own cars?

@A.3:  I, uh, I used to.  I don't much anymore.  Except just change the oil
occasionally.  

B.4:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I, actually I just, uh, just recently thought about buying
a new car.  And I went and saw all the Japanese cars and, uh, really liked
the, uh, actually the Diamante, which is, uh, sort of the luxury Nissan.

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  Uh, but I, I just decided I wasn't going to get [laughter], I wasn't going
to get, first of all I wasn't going to get a Japanese car.  That was about the
time that, uh, you know, #all the# --

A.7:  #Oh, yeah.#  Tha-,

B.8:  -- all the sort of antitrade stuff was going on [throat_clearing]
[phone_ringing] and then, uh, later decided that, uh, I'd just hang on to my
own car which has about two hundred and eighteen thousand miles on it
[laughter].

A.9:  Oh, my goodness.

B.10:  It's a Chevy Celebrity [laughter].  Four cylinder.

A.11:  That's very good.

B.12:  And I've driven it since, uh, grad school.  And, uh, just decided, you
know, I think I'll hang on to this car, you know.  It's been so good for,
[laughter] for me all this time, so, uh.  In fact, I got my wife a, a used car
that was, uh, also a Chevy Celebrity because, you know, #I# --

A.13:  #You had# good luck with that one, huh?

B.14:  -- I had good luck and, uh, I knew enough about all the, the basic
maintenance, you know.  Brakes, oil and that kind of stuff to do it myself,
so.

A.15:  Well that's, uh, I, I'd certainly agree with your, with your logic there.
My, uh, [lipsmack] uh, feelings about cars are, I'd look under the hood and I
see all the, [breathing] uh, all the stuff under there and I say, boy, my my
chances of, of doing, how shall I say it, uh, everything's electronic, uh, uh,
it's not that I'm against electronics, it's just that, uh --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- there's so much you know.  And you can't tune it yourself.  You can't do
anything.  It's because you don't have the, #the# --

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  -- tools to measure it.  #On# --

B.20:  #Yeah.#

A.21:  -- on the other hand I, I, I have a ninety Honda and, uh, I'm kind of on
the other end of the spectrum.  I have [inhaling], let's see, I have, uh,
twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car.

B.22:  All right.

A.23:  And, uh,

B.24:  ((So if you have)) any problems with it [laughter]?

A.25:  So, yeah, and it's, it's a absolutely flawless car.  It, uh, and it's the
smoothest car I've ever ridden a, uh, a,

B.26:  Is it an Accord?  

A.27:  What's that?

B.28:  It's an Accord?

A.29:  Accord, yes.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And, uh, so the, [swallowing] the things that personally, if I ever, if I
had to buy another car, uh, [sigh] I'd be [sigh], the, the new American cars,
uh,

B.32:  [Thumping].

A.33:  the ads intrigue me [inhaling].

B.34:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.35:  Because they think they can catch up with, uh, the Japanese.  But as far
as, I, I think one of the things that they're going to have to impress me with
is, is again this, uh, this thing that impresses you about yours, and that's,
uh, frequency of repair and, and absolute reliability.

B.36:  Yeah.  Yeah [inhaling].

A.37:  [Inhaling] Because the worst thing that can happen to a person is, I think,
is, uh, to have to go in and get it fixed.

B.38:  #Yep.#

A.39:  #You know,# it's, it,

B.40:  Yeah.  Because it just breaks it more #[laughter].#

A.41:  #Yeah.  Th-, th-, there's a# that, that was, I, I noticed that, uh,
[inhaling] uh, with one of my other cars.  Uh, if, if there's this kind of,
uh, natural curve of decay, you know.  #Decay# --

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  -- curve.  Uh, half the time when you take it in, it's farther down the, 

B.44:  [Throat_clearing].

A.45:  and you get it back, it's farther down the curve than when you took it in.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Cause those guys are, they're being paid for, uh, [inhaling] you know, last
time I had my car re-, uh, even, even this car.  I took it in, they said sixty
dollars an hour and,

B.48:  Wow.  That's as much as I make programming #[laughter].#

A.49:  #[Laughter] Well, I said# sixty dollars an hour?

B.50:  I mean, and I don't even get the sixty.  I only make, I only get the
thirty.  So #[laughter].#

A.51:  #They charged# me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my
car out at an hour after they clocked it in.

B.52:  Huh.

A.53:  So they, they charged me for two and a half, you know, basically, two and a
half hours, uh, #labor# --

B.54:  #Yeah.#

A.55:  -- an hour later.  And I asked them about that and they said that's, uh,
you know, that's flat rate sir.  You know, they look it up in the book and if
it takes an hour to do something why, and they can get it done in thirty
minutes, why they charge you an hour.

B.56:  Huh.

A.57:  So, anyway, those, #that, uh,# 

B.58:  #[Laughter] In other# words there's no, there's no benefit for going to a
skilled mechanic #[laughter].#

A.59:  #Yeah.  So, uh, anyway,# what I'm looking for is, is reliability because I
want to keep it away from the, from the, uh, the repair people.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  And the other thing I'm, I guess I'd be looking for is, uh, uh, you know,
mileage counts with me.  Even though I, even though I don't drive that much,
I, I like mileage.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  And, uh,

B.64:  Ye-, somebody told me, uh, once (( )) a casual conversation that, this guy
ran a, a towing service and, uh, I was telling him about, you know, I was
thinking about buying a car and he said, you know, I, he said he, he knew it
would sound bias but he said that about, uh, I don't know, four out of five
cars that he tows are Japanese cars.  And he said he just, #he didn't why, you
know, he'd been, he'd been in the business for awhile and he wasn't sure maybe
it was,# 

A.65:  #[Laughter].#

B.66:  because people who bought those cars, you know, would rather have it towed
than try some other thing, you know, like, you know, having somebody drag it
home with a chain.
