=====================================================================

A.1:  [Static] Your turn.

B.2:  Oh, I, I start.  Okay.  Well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.  Uh. and
really, i-, i-, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm
paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions and
you need to make sure all your bills are paid.  Uh, about yourself?

@A.3:  Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget.  Both my wife and I, uh,
grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means and, uh, our family income, at
this point, is comfortable.  Upper middle class I guess you might say.  And,
uh, we're both so, uh, frugal that, uh, we really don't need a budget, you
know.  We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never
seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.

B.4:  Yeah.  Well I guess that really is sort of, uh, keeping a budget, you know.
You stay within your, uh --

A.5:  Well we stay within our means #but we# --

B.6:  -- #within your# means.

A.7:  -- don't do it, uh, by conscious effort.  It just sort of happens
automatically.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Although we just moved to California and, uh, the cost of living here in
California is, uh, I would say rather pathological [laughter].

B.10:  Yes [laughter].

A.11:  Uh, housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more
expensive than, uh, uh, {pause} [lipsmack] they were where I came from in, uh,
Dallas.

B.12:  Oh, you moved from Dallas to San #Francisco.#

A.13:  #Yeah.#  So, uh --

B.14:  That is a hugh difference.

A.15:  -- uh, that presents a, a real shock [laughter].

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  Ac-, ac-, actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since
we've moved to California but,

B.18:  But you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live [laughter].

A.19:  Yeah.  It's God's country.  

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Uh, and one way you know that is that only God can afford it #[laughter].#

B.22:  #[Laughter].#

A.23:  Uh, so budget is not a problem for us.  Uh, at least it hasn't been.  It
may, may be at this point.  But, uh, up until this point it really hasn't been
[inhaling].  When I, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time
ago, I, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary
{mispronounced} salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was
like [lipsmack] oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And, uh, I noted at that point that I was, you know, if that's what my
salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my
father made during his best year ever.  So I stopped worrying about money.

B.26:  #Yeah.#

A.27:  #And# it, never have worried about money since then.  

B.28:  Well, that, that's a system too.  

A.29:  Sometimes, uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, you know, because I guess I
don't really manage my money the way I should.  But, uh, I suppose I've lost
money on not taking good advantage of, of, uh, investments but,

B.30:  Well then again, you know, you said you, you are able to take trips.  And
you do, obviously, have enough to live on so I guess you're indirectly
budgeting.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Uh, just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, uh, in
spending the money.  So, I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would
think {pause}.  It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two
people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they
manage their money.

A.33:  Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  How big is your family?

B.36:  Uh, well we're, we have one on the way.

A.37:  I see.

B.38:  Uh, my wife, and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh,
September.

A.39:  {Pause} So how, you, whe-, once you get ten children though, you may 
have,

B.40:  [Laughter] No I think it's just going to be one.  

A.41:  Oh, all right [laughter].

B.42:  [Laughter] How about yourself?

A.43:  I have two kids.  #Uh, one# --

B.44:  #Oh.#

A.45:  -- nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but,
uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.

B.46:  Do they budget at all?  I mean do you have them on an #allowance?#

A.47:  #I give# them a, I give them an allowance and they, uh, I basically give my
son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give, give him
the other half in cold cash.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  And, uh, he has a teller card so he can, uh, do what he wi-, do what he
wishes with the money that I put in the bank.  But, at least, it isn't, you
know, burning a hole in his pocket.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  If he wants to use it, he has to go get it and that usually [/static],
