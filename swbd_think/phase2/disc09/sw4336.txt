=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, I'm not sure how it is in Georgia, but in, in Pittsburgh the r-,
the crime rate really is not very high at the moment.  Is that, is that true
for, for Atlanta?

B.2:  Atlanta is kind of high.  Uh, it's, it's lower than it has been in the
past.  Uh, I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off, and usually
around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit
higher.

A.3:  Yeah, I, that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about
anywhere.

B.4:  Yeah.  Uh, what kind of crime problem do you usually run into?  Any
specifics {mispronounced}?

A.5:  Well, uh, the least, what, from what's on the news, uh, there are very few,
like actual robberies reported, uh, uh, of, of residences.  What's more likely
to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, knocking over a, a small store or a
car theft, you know, it, things of that nature.  Very few, uh, assaults,
although on the college campuses, uh, there are, uh, cases of, you know, like
people getting machine from a, from an automated teller and, you know,
somebody trying to, to device a scam for, for, uh, getting the money for them
that actually preys mostly on foreigners.

B.6:  Um.  

A.7:  But mostly petty things and, n-, no, nothing, nothing really too big.

B.8:  Right, well, I guess here we run into that sometime, but I guess a lot of
crimes are done with apartment type break ins --

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  -- that type, not much home break ins.  There are some, but not, not very
high.  Uh, as far as tellers and things like that, it's not extremely high
either.  There were one case where, uh, this one guy, uh, was taking women
from the teller and, and, you know, making them give him money and stuff and
--

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- then at the same time, raping them all, so, so that's kind of like a
double assault there.

A.13:  Yeah, uh, a strange case that, uh, that happened, oh, it's about, about a
year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine.

B.14:  Really?  

A.15:  It was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- and put it on the back and drove away with it.  

B.18:  Oh, wow.  

A.19:  Now, there's a crime for you.  

B.20:  [Laughter] Yeah, there's a crime.  

A.21:  Yeah, but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are, are
pretty, uh, innocuous.  Although, uh, from what I hear in the news, and, and
I, I s-, saw an episode of the T V show, COPS --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, and, uh, it, it, it did surprise
me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and thing, and things like
that, but I, I don't really think those things happen too often because, like
I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's, it's not all that
common.

B.24:  Oh, okay.  I don't know, crime situations here, they, like I say, lot of,
lot of cases is usually just apartments and, and break ins and things like
that and a lot of it is due to drugs.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  Uh, drug related, you know, in, in most cases, it's not like, uh, it's
someone do steal a, a or television or V C R or something like that it is for
drugs, you know, because you really can't on the street make any money off of
it per se, you know, you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it --

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- so you really not making a sizeable profit.  So it's not really
lucrative to take chances like that, you know, even though it, it does exist.

A.29:  You know, I, just to diverge a little bit, uh, I live in an apartment.
Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh
and, uh, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break
in [laughter].

B.30:  Right.  

A.31:  But, even so, it, I mean, it's, it's still difficult for me to convince my
apartment mates to, to like lock the doors when they go out [laughter], you
know, and things like --

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  -- that.  

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  Uh, it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just, you
know, sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when they're not
--

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- just come in, you know, there's a T V and a V C R and, they could, uh,
they could get in pretty easy and, and especially, uh, since there are
bedrooms upstairs --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- and people leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs playing
music, it could still happen then.

B.40:  Yeah, that's true, but you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you
that even not, uh, participating in any type crime.  I guess there was one
case, I was surprised, uh, so happened this person worked at the same place, I
work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place I did, but I didn't know
that they had been watching me because I was getting ready to, to go in my car
one morning and the first thing they said is, uh, you must don't have to be to
work at eight, you know, like shock,
