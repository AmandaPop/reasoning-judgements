==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, uh, from my father.  

B.2:  Oh, really [laughter]?  

A.3:  Yeah, he had, he had given me the information and I said, um, that's
interesting, so I thought I'd, uh, get involved and see what's going on with
it.

B.4:  Yeah, kind of curious because I'm, some people found about it ((on the))
computer network.

A.5:  Oh, is that right?  

B.6:  Others, yeah.  

A.7:  So they have a bulletin out on it?  

B.8:  Yeah, on the, uh, uh, there's a network ar-, like around the world --

A.9:  Oh, okay.  

B.10:  -- and, uh, there's a Telecom Digest.  

A.11:  Huh.  

B.12:  [Cough]. 

A.13:  Interesting.  Uh, I guess, uh, the topic we're talking ab-, did they
introduce the topic on your side?

B.14:  Yeah, taxes?  

A.15:  Yeah, and whether we're getting enough for the income and all that stuff.

B.16:  Right.  

A.17:  Okay.  

B.18:  [Noise].

A.19:  This is the first time I've done this, so, uh,

B.20:  Yeah ((hold on a sec)).

A.21:  Um,

B.22:  [Static]. 

A.23:  We'll just,

B.24:  ((I'm on a, I'm on a)) cordless. 

A.25:  Oh, you are?  

B.26:  It's giving me some trouble.  [static] Jeez.  ((That make it better)).

A.27:  Uh, all set?  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Okay, now, w-, what do we do?  

B.30:  [Cough]. 

A.31:  Just press one and go for it?  

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  [Laughter] 

A.35:  This is kind of weird.  

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  Uh, all right, uh, what, what do you want to do as a prompt for the
question?

B.38:  Uh, oh, you, you didn't press it yet, did you?  

A.39:  No.  

B.40:  No, okay, [trill] uh, I don't know, see, uh, I'm a student, I don't pay
much in taxes, except for when I work, ((that's a little bit)),

A.41:  Oh, you're a student?  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  Oh, okay.  

B.44:  Uh, um.  

A.45:  Uh, why don't I ask you the question, uh, you know, uh, I don't know, uh,
being, uh, d-, I'll just ask you, you know, d-, do you think income taxes work
for this country or should we have a broad base tax.

B.46:  A broad base tax in terms of [/trill],

A.47:  Of everybody just pays a flat rate.  

B.48:  Okay.  

A.49:  Ten percent.  

B.50:  I have an answer for that [laughter].  

A.51:  What?  

B.52:  I have an answer for that (( )).  

A.53:  Okay.  All right, I'll talk to you in a bit.  

B.54:  Okay, go ahead.  

A.55:  Okay, uh, I'll just press one.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Okay [laughter], here we go [beep].  

B.58:  [Cough] Okay.  

A.59:  Right I, I guess I'm just wondering, uh, what your thoughts are on taxes,
uh, do you think that we should just have a, kind of a broad based tax or just,

B.60:  [Cough]. 

@A.61:  or do you like it the way it's set up now?

B.62:  Uh, I think a progressive, the way it is now, is, is good.  Uh, taxing, uh,
those people with more money, uh, taxing them a little more, I mean, those
people can afford to pay it out.  I mean, it, it wouldn't be fair to, uh,
like, say, lower class people who don't make as much money --

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  -- to, uh, pay out the same amount of taxes as someone making millions of
dollars.

A.65:  Well yeah,

B.66:  [Cough].

A.67:  I suppose that's, I suppose that's true, in, I, I guess I'm more for kind
of a, just a, across the board tax, because that way everybody would pay the
s-, a rate that's equal to what they were doing.  I mean, if somebody only
made ten thousand dollars a year and it was a ten percent tax, they're paying
a thousand dollars.

B.68:  Yeah, okay.  

A.69:  Whereas, if somebody's making a million dollars a year, uh, you know, what
I mean?

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  They're paying a hundred thousand dollars in taxes, as opposed to which,
what it seems like now, which is, you know, these guys get away with, uh, all
these tax breaks and everything else like that, that apply to them, but they
don't apply to the little guy, so it seems like the, all the t-, you know,
taxes are being paid by everybody else.  Seems kind of crazy.

B.72:  So you're saying, uh, ten percent, let's say a broad base ten percent tax
--

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  -- uh, without any loopholes or,

A.75:  E-, exactly, just everybody pays ten percent, that's it.  And then nobody
has to worry about whether, you know, I get this, and I get that, and, uh, you
know, or this person gets a tax break, but this person doesn't when this
person makes that much more money.

B.76:  Right.  

A.77:  I mean, that way, you know, somebody that's, uh, that's making, uh, ten
million dollars pays a million bucks in taxes.  They, uh, see, I guess the
problem with that is, are they really using their fair share.

B.78:  Is who?  

A.79:  Uh, the person that pays that many, that much more taxes.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  But, then, again, they have as much use to the, of the system as everybody.

B.82:  [Cough] Right.  Um, yeah, I see the, I see the logic behind that.

A.83:  I don't know if that, that would make sense.  I guess, uh, I guess what
people do, I guess the government's incentive now is to create incentives so
that people will do more, I guess house building or buying homes, or, you
know, because if they give them br-, tax break on their interest.

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  Because I have a break on our interest.  I mean all our, our all our
mortgage interest is deductible.

B.86:  Right.  

A.87:  Uh, but it doesn't --

B.88:  ((To)),

A.89:  -- seem like they do a damn good job with the, uh, uh, with the way they're
spending the taxes.

B.90:  [Laughter] Yeah, promote borrowing, with tax breaks, promote investment.

A.91:  Exactly.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  I mean, they only just recently got rid of the interest, uh, that was
deductible on credit cards and car loans and things like that.

B.94:  Right, personal tax.  

A.95:  Yeah, but the major borrowing is still there.  I mean, you know, on
mortgages and things like that.  Uh, although, I don't think that we could
afford our house without having that, uh mortgage deduction.

B.96:  Right, I think that,

A.97:  Uh, you know, it actually cuts down four hundred bucks a month.

B.98:  [Cough] Think something like that luxury tax was a mistake.  Did they, did
they repeal that yet?

A.99:  I don't know, that's a good question.  I, I don't know whether they did or
not.

B.100:  Because I mean, yeah, you're, uh, trying to get back at, trying to sort of,
maybe punish, I don't know, the rich and make them pay some more, but, it,
what happened, the, the result was that, uh, [cough] sales went down in yachts
and those kind of things.

A.101:  [Laughter] Right.  

B.102:  And so the little guy who works for those, that employer,
