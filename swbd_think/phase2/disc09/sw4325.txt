A.1:  Okay.  So,

B.2:  I guess,    

A.3:  What kind of experience do you, do you have, then with child care?

B.4:  I think, uh, I wonder if that worked.  

A.5:  Does it say something?  
	
B.6:  I think it usually does.  You might try, uh, I don't know, hold it down a
little longer, and see if it, uh,

A.7:  Okay [beep]. {long pause}  Well,

B.8:  Okay I,

A.9:  Does it usually make a recording or s-,

B.10:  Well, I don't remember.  It seemed like it did, but [laughter] it might
not.  I guess --

A.11:  Okay.  

B.12:  -- I guess we can start.  Uh,

A.13:  Okay.  

@B.14:  No, I don't, I don't have any kids.  I, uh, my sister has a, she just had
a baby, he's about five months old and she was worrying about going back to
work and what she was going to do with him and --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- the different, do you have kids?  

A.17:  I have three.  

B.18:  Oh, really?  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Yeah, I do [laughter].  Yes, uh, I don't work, though, but I used to work
and, when I had two children.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit, but
I don't envy anybody who's in that [laughter] situation to find day care.

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  But, does your sister live in a big community?  

B.26:  Uh, yeah she lives, it's a, it's a fairly large community.  She, uh, got
real lucky, though.  He had a boss who, uh, moved into a larger office --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- and she's able to take her baby to work with her.  

A.29:  Oh, really?  

B.30:  And it's a small office that she works in -- 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- and, uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office, and it's just one lawyer --

A.33:  Um.  

B.34:  -- and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office.  There's
no one else that works there.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby, so it works out
pretty good for her.

A.37:  Wow.

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  How lucky [laughter].  I, I know a lot of people around here sometimes
have, like, mothers or grandmothers --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- that take care of their kids and, but, the community I'm in is not a
real large one, so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that,
you know, you either know them or know somebody who knows them [laughter], to
get to, 

B.42:  Yeah, so it's fairly safe.  

A.43:  Yeah, to get references and that, so, but, uh, I, I d-, don't feel
comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply
because there's so many kids and so many [sniffing] [throat_clearing],

B.44:  Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?

A.45:  Yeah, and, uh, you know, colds and things like that [laughter] get --

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  -- spread real easy and things, but, and they're expensive and, [lipsmack]
course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know,
where they teach them academic things.

B.48:  Yes.  

A.49:  Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that, but, take a
long time to find the right place [laughter].

B.50:  Yeah, and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the
right place or not.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  Anything, I guess, could happen.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Because after, I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's
going to have to take him to a day care.

A.55:  Uh-huh, when he starts toddling around and stuff.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him and he starts
crawling that's,

A.59:  Uh-huh.  It would be hard, I think it would be kind of stressful.  It would
be nice to have him around --

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  -- but, uh, seems like, you know, goll-, what if he cried at the wrong time
[laughter] or the phone rang or,

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  you know, at the wrong time [laughter].  

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  But,   

B.66:  I think she has problems with that, too.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Well, when you have kids, will you work?  Do you -- 

B.68:  I don't know -- 

A.69:  -- work now?  

B.70:  -- that's something I've considered.  Uh,

A.71:  Uh-huh.   

B.72:  I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be
there for them all the time.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  Is that what you do?  

A.75:  Uh, yeah.  Actually, I teach my kids at home, so I'm here all the time.

B.76:  Oh, so they don't go to school.  Is it like, uh, oh, what's that called,
it's, uh, correspondence school, they do it --

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- at home.  

A.79:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.80:  That's interesting.  

A.81:  So,

B.82:  Do you have to have any special training?  

A.83:  Not, it depends on the state you live actually.  Some laws absolutely
prohibit it.  Some states, uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in
order to do that.  Our state doesn't yet, [laughter] say that and I'm not a
certified teacher.  I went to college, but I, you know, but my kids are only
elementary grades, levels right now and so,

B.84:  So they haven't been to public schools at all.  

A.85:  One of them was for a couple of years and so, you know, my oldest, he was,
and then my youngest two have never been.

B.86:  Um.

A.87:  So anyway, but we don't,

B.88:  So, you've never had,
