=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I guess, uh, [inhaling] start off by saying that [breathing] I am
very much in favor of space travel, but I think we're going about it all
wrong.

B.2:  Okay, with that,

A.3:  What are your thoughts?  

B.4:  [Laughter] Uh, I'd like ((you to)) expound on that a little bit, but, uh, I
am very much in favor of it, too, and I think that we need to take the
approach that so much technology is advanced out of the, uh, space program
that it's amazing to me that we don't put more money into it.

A.5:  Um.  

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  Yeah.  Well, I am, uh, kind of disappointed by the way things have been
going.  Uh, basically we've been out this, at this for, what, about, thirty
five years --

B.8:  Uh, well, yeah.  

A.9:  -- from the first experimental,

B.10:  Well, it depends on what you're say-, yeah, that, I gue-,

A.11:  Well, first experimental vanguard type stuff.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, I think that was called the first, uh, the modified B Twos and things
like that.

B.14:  [Throat_clearing] Okay.  

A.15:  That was late fifties, I believe so,

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17: And, uh, if you look at the progress that was made at the turn of the
century in aviation --

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- in a period of thirty-five years, in my assessment, it was spectacularly
better.

B.20:  Well, there's no doubt about that.  

A.21:  And, uh, I don't think that's because the complexity of the task.  I think
that's because it's being handled by bureaucracy now.

B.22:  Well, you, so you're saying you thought, uh, that, well, that, that implies
to me that you would, you should have, felt like it should have been, uh,
turned over to a commercial market.

A.23:  Well, I'm excited about these fellows who are experimenting commercially.
I'm excited about, uh, the commercial end of satellite operations.  Uh, there
seems to be some spectacular progress happening there, and, uh,

B.24:  Well, I think that, uh, satellites, now that is a, that is a market where
there's a, a valid reason for commercial.  Uh, when it comes to research, I'm
not sure I agree with that.

A.25:  Well, what would be, what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial
research?

B.26:  Oh, no reasons, I just don't think that, uh, a commercial organization
could successfully, uh, uh, make it profitable for them.  Uh, (( ))
[throat_clearing] and besides the fact it, it also would be extremely limiting
as to which research ((it would)) be.  Be whichever one happened to bring in
the dollar.

A.27:  Oh, they have some organizations out there with some fairly deep pockets
and, uh, I think that,

B.28:  But, U S is notorious for not spending any money on research [yelling].

A.29:  ((Yeah, well, may-)),

B.30:  Uh, our commercial mark-, uh, our commercial percentages are much lower
than, [yelling] uh, m-, most of the other major countries as compared to
Japan, compared to Germany, compared to, uh, most of the Scandinavian
countries.  The amount of money, uh, put towards research is, is minuscule and
had, minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years.

A.31:  Well (( )).

B.32:  Th-, so, I'm not so sure that that would be, I, I, I agree that the
bureaucracy in most cases is something which [laughter], it should be avoided,
and we have, we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it, and
it seeps over in a lot of different ways.

A.33:  Um.  

B.34:  Now, uh, in space, I don't think you could do it any other way.  Uh, w-,
I'd say, fact, my opinion is, what we ought to do is we ought to get all
these, all the countries involved in these things.

A.35:  Um.  

B.36:  And, in fact,

A.37:  Go ahead.  

B.38:  Oh, well, be-, I mean, we have, uh, resources across the world.  I mean, I,
I, we're coming out to a global, global economy anyways --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- so why aren't we using the Japanese technology?  Why aren't we using the
European technology?  Why aren't, see, see, space travel is a world issue --

A.41:  Well,

B.42:  -- it's not a U S issue and, and our, our, our kind of elitism attitude
we had in the sixties about U S, uh, love it or leave it, l-, and, you know,
actually we still have it but,

A.43:  [Laughter]. 

B.44:  that whole,

A.45:  It's not as effective now as it was [laughter] then.  

B.46:  Right.  

A.47:  [Laughter]. 

B.48:  Uh, that, th-, th-, the concept of beating the other, uh, countries, I
think is somewhat,

A.49:  It may be obsolete.  

B.50:  Yeah, it's somewhat -- 

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  -- obsolete [laughter].  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  And I think,

A.55:  Yeah, I, uh, what do you call it,

B.56:  [Yelling].

A.57:  uh, I think it's important that it happen, I think that ultimately it will
happen.  Uh, I think that the way things are going on now may be an
impediment, and th-, by that I mean s-, you know, I don't know about, I, I'm
not going to speculate about research across the board, but let's suppose, uh,
you were the executive of a company that could possibly ((have)) benefit from
s-, space research.

B.58:  Right.  

A.59:  And your three or four competitors and you're debating whether to, uh,
throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years --

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  -- but it's going to be a real long term, uh, play.  Or whether you're just
going to sit back,

B.62:  [Talking].

A.63:  and watch television.  And, uh, when you look, when you see that your
primary competitor is, uh, a government with very deep pockets that's going to
give the fruits to your competitors, the obvious correct decision is to sit
back and wait for them to give it to everybody, rather than doing it yourself.
So I think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount
of, uh, private, uh, effort put into it.  Uh, with regard to myself,
personally, I think that if ever, if I ever in my lifetime do stand on the
surface of the moon, it's going to be, uh, on a ship with a Japanese flag.

B.64:  [Laughter] I would say that I have absolutely no in-,
