A.1:  [Hum] All right.  So I guess we're all right.

B.2:  ((Thank you)).  #Yeah.#

A.3:  #Uh,# I don't know what the laws are up in, uh, New York.  What's the law
up in New York for capital punishment?

@B.4:  Well, Governor Mario, the, uh, holy one #[laughter],#

A.5:  #[Laughter].#

B.6:  up here.  Mario Cuomo has been against capital punishment since he hit
office here, I'd say, six years ago.  #He's# --

A.7:  #Uh-huh.#

B.8:  -- he's for the concept of, uh, uh, life in prison without parole.  And
every single year up in here in New York state, the, uh, Gov-, the state
assembly gets together and tries to pass a death #penalty bill.#

A.9:  #[Laughter].#

B.10:  And every year he vetos it #[laughter] and upsets people.#  

A.11:  #[Laughter] Gets sort of repetitious.#

B.12:  Yeah, he upsets people up here, uh, every time he does it.  I don't what it
is down in Florida these days.

A.13:  It's legal down here.  Uh, I, I know they've done a few.  Most of the time,
they'll get real close and then they'll pardon them or, it hardly ever gets to
that point.  Uh, I don't think they've one in a long time.  But I know it's
legal.  And I know one just about happened recently, but it never went
through.  So, they try but, you know, very few actually go.

B.14:  Yeah.  Mario, up here, is claiming that, uh, the reason why he's against
capital punishment is because to send these s-, things through the court
system --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- on appeal, then another appeal, then another appeal, adds up costing
taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no
chance of parole.  So, you know, i-, i-, if it comes down to a money issue --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- I, you know, in that case, then I'm all for putting them behind bars, as
long as there's no chance of parole.  But, you know, what it's like #when
they,# 

A.19:  #Yeah, there's always# those loopholes.

B.20:  Yeah.  They fill the court, th-, the jails up and suddenly let them go and
they're back on the street.  We had this murder up here.  Uh, Art Shawcross up
in Rochester, killed nineteen prostitutes up here.

A.21:  Ooh!

B.22:  And he was let out on parole from up in, uh, uh, Watertown.  #And
[throat_clearing],# 

A.23:  #Was# that, was that on purpose or was that a, a snafu?

B.24:  He was just, well, actually he, it was on purpose I #guess.#

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  He was, uh, he was a real psycho though and, uh, as a matter of fact it,
this happened under Cuomo's watch.  So the Bush administration was thinking if
if Cuomo is going to run for President --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- they were going to do #instead of# --

A.29:  #That was his# dirt huh.

B.30:  -- Yeah.  Instead of Willie Horton, now we have the Art Shawcross #deal,
you know, [laughter].  So, yeah.#

A.31:  #[Laughter] Yeah.#

B.32:  I don't know what your feelings are about it, being in Florida where you've
had it before.

A.33:  Uh, well I can, I can vouch for the fact that the, uh, the appeals will go
through and go through and go through.  And, yeah, it drags on for about
forever, you know.  I guess I'm about your, your opinion of it.  I have
nothing against it philosophically, in terms of if you're absolutely sure.  I
mean, uh, uh, I, I would feel that you better make sure it's one of those
cases that has virtually no possibility of n-, you know, y-, y-, pretty, I
mean supposedly you got through the courts, you're not supposed to have any
reasonable doubts anyway.  But I guess it would have to be one of those
extremes in the first place.  But there's enough of them.  But I, I've also
heard that, that these things cost so much in the end that, uh, that it really
doesn't save you [laughter] any money, if it's a money thing.  And as a
deterrent thing, I don't really think, uh, personally I don't feel that
capital pun-, punishment as a deterrent is a, is a big deal.  I don't think
that really works that much.

B.34:  Yeah.  Well, of course, you know, we have New York City up here.  #I'm 
in# --

A.35:  #Yeah.#

B.36:  -- being in Rochester we're kind of, they consider us more in Canada 
tha-, [laughter] --

A.37:  #((Th-,)) [laughter].#

B.38:  -- #than in New York state area [laughter].#  But, uh, up here, you know, 
we don't have too many serious problems with crime.  But I know in New York 
City it was a #real# --

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  -- it's a big deal.  They would like to have it back and, uh,
[throat_clearing] I think it's going to boil down to changing the governor if
they really want to put it through.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Uh, they're building more prisons up here to try and put people in.  Attica
is not too far away from where we are and,

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  that's at capacity.  And, of course, you know, New York City is just packed
with criminals that #have done# --

A.45:  #Right.#

B.46:  -- everything.

A.47:  ((Whoo)).

B.48:  So, I, you know, I don't where it's going to go to in the end.  I just
think that, uh, I, I, I agree with you.  I'm not really terribly against it as
long as it looks like it's going to work and --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- reduce the court load and [inhaling] #the like.#

A.51:  #((I-, tha-,)).#

B.52:  [Throat_clearing].

A.53:  Oh, down here it's not all peaceful either though [laughter].  I don't if
you've been following any of this stuff.  Of course, we had the big snafu
right now with the, the Mets thing.  But there have been a lot of, uh, [sigh]
a lot of things going on down here.  All the Gainesville murders.

B.54:  Yeah, yeah.  I, we heard that.  #Yeah.#

A.55:  #Of course# I don't think they've, they, that, then, actually down here
there's almost more publicity going on on po-, police screw ups and, and, uh,
beatings and everything, than, than actual murders [laughter].  And, uh, the
Gaine-, with the Gainesville picking up people seemingly [/hum],
