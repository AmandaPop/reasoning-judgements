===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have a pet?

B.2:  Yes, I do.  I have a dog.  Do you have pet?

@A.3:  I have, uh, see, three canaries.

B.4:  Oh.  I have never been fortunate enough to have a canary.  Well, let me
rephrase that.  I've had them but I don't have luck with them.  Is there a
secret?

A.5:  Oh, [sigh] we put, uh, vitamins in the water.  And, uh, we don't take
really great care of them but, uh, we just make sure that their, [inhaling]
their water has vitamins in it and, uh, and [sigh] some of them are hardier
than others.  The ones that are really hearty are the ones that are, that are,
uh, [lipsmack] how shall I say it, variegated ones.  The, the real brightly
colored ones don't seem to be too hardy.  Cause they've been bred for looks
and not for strength.

B.6:  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.

A.7:  So, what kind of a dog do you have?

B.8:  I have a mutt.  He's part Pit and part Boxer [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  But he is a very good dog.  He's very, which surprised me, cause I've had
such, uh, repercussions about having a part Pit.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Especially around children.  But he's really good.  I can't complain.  

A.13:  Well, the, I think the important thing, uh, we've had several dogs and,
and, uh, [sigh] my wife keeps going for these beautiful, you know, how shall I
say it, the beautiful dog is the one that catches her eye and so I keep
telling her that beauty is not,

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  uh, is not important when you've got a dog.  Intelligence is.  

B.16:  That's true.

A.17:  Now there's nothing worse than a dumb dog and this, you know, just like a
dumb friend, so to speak.

B.18:  Just s-, what does she like in par-, anything particular?

A.19:  Uh, as far as the pets [laughter]?

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Uh, she likes the fluffy ones and the ones that are, you know, that are,
how shall I say it, they're very good looking but I like mutts, myself.

B.22:  They tend {mispronounced} to take a lot of time whenever you get those
kinds.  You have to brush them continually and that type of thing.

A.23:  Yeah.  And, and well like I say, they're, they're picked f-, they're bred
for looks and so they're like these turkeys that you see in the, in the, uh, I
don't know if you've heard stories about the differences between wild turkeys
and, and, uh, and the ones that are bred for the meat.  But the ones that are
bred for the meat will drown in a rain storm and cause they're so dumb and,
#and, uh, [laughter] they,#

B.24:  #[Laughter].#

A.25:  can't, uh, wild turkeys are really smart.  And the thing that, uh, when it
comes to pets is a, a smart pet is really a lot of fun.  They, that's been my
experience but, uh, you don't get them by getting them for their looks.  You
got to get them for their, you know, how, where they look at you with bright
eyes when they're little --

B.26:  That's true.

A.27:  -- puppies and stuff like that.

B.28:  Do you think pets are, uh, handicapped or, are they, uh, very worthwhile
having them around?  And what is their use [noise]?  That was one of the
questions I was told to, uh, ask from the operator.  And I think that they're
very useful.  Especially for, uh, companionship and that type of thing.  What
is your opinion?

A.29:  I, I feel the same thing.  Pets are, uh, they add a new dimension.  They,
they give you something to think about when you're kind of tired or blue or
something like that and, uh, they get you to think about something other than
yourself.

B.30:  That's true [talking].

A.31:  And they never talk back, almost [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter] And they're always there when you need them.

A.33:  Yeah.  And they, uh, and their, it's kind of fun to rub them and, and, uh,
well, with canaries you don't do much of that.  But when they sing, why it
cheers you up.

B.34:  Yes.

A.35:  So, uh, [inhaling] and I think that, that, uh, they also give you a sense
of, of somebody is depending on you.  You've got to do something for them or,
or they, uh, they suffer.

B.36:  That's true.

A.37:  So it adds a dimension that, that, uh, you're kind of in control and that's
kind of sad when people neglect pets.  But, so let's see, h-, how old is your
dog?

B.38:  Oh, he's young.  He's only a, he, he just turned a year.  So he's really,
uh, [swallowing] #just# --

A.39:  #((Got to wait)).#

B.40:  -- starting out in the world.

A.41:  [Laughter]  W-, have you, uh, let's see, what else.  Have you had other
pets beside this?

B.42:  Yes, I've had Basenjies also.  I use to and they've, uh,

A.43:  They're the ones with the high pitched bark or,

B.44:  They don't bark at all.  They have a #yodel.#

A.45:  #Yeah.#  #Yeah [laughter].#

B.46:  #And, uh, I# haven't found any in this area, anybody in this area that
raises them to, uh, get another one.  So that's how we and we came across this
one that we've had quite by accident.  My daughter found a, [noise] had a
family that wasn't taking care of it and just didn't want it.  And in the
meantime, we were looking for a Basenji.  And, uh, we weren't very successful.
But, uh, they're an intelligent dog.  And they're very, uh, [lipsmack] uh,
{pause} independent.  But they're not so much independent that they, uh, are
like a cat.  P-, a lot of people [/talking],
