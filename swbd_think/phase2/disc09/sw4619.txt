B.1:  Bye {talking to someone else}.  {Starts speaking to A} So we're, uh, our
discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly?

@A.2:  That's right, that's right.  You know, what, what, uh, what do you think
is important?  If you were, uh, I don't know how, how old you are, but if you
had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is,
uh, who were ready,

B.3:  [Baby]. 

A.4:  who, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think
you would look for?

B.5:  Uh, well I, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety #and# --

A.6:  #Huh.#

B.7:  -- he lives by himself and he's in good shape.

A.8:  Yeah.

B.9:  Uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this.  I think I'd
look for a home where they got a lot of attention and, uh, where they did some
things to try to keep them, um, mentally alive.

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  And where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring
and compassionate people, uh, operating it.  #Do# --

A.12:  #Huh.#

B.13:  -- you have any experience with this yourself?

A.14:  Well my, uh, uh, my wife's grandmother --

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  -- is in a nursing home in, uh, Minnesota and we go there, uh, once a year.
We see, we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far
away.  When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  And it seems, uh, I mean the, the environment there, I don't know too much
about it but it, it seems nice enough.  Uh, it, it's hard, at least half of
the residents I would say are not, not mentally sound.  So it's hard to tell
how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r-, to retain, uh,
clarity, say, uh, #((you know)).#

B.19:  #From# the lack of stimulation, #you mean.#

A.20:  #Yeah.# Well I, I don-, I don't know.  We, we also, my wife and I, uh, uh,
volunteer to go to a, uh, nursing home that's just a mile from our house.  We,
uh, she goes more often than I.  We used to go once a month, once every two
months to visit some of the patients there.  And we'd take, we have a two year
old son and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us.  And, uh, there I would say
it's the same thing.  It's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment but
again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who are, who are just e-,
e-, essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but,
but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their,
uh, mental skills and so on.  It's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the
halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who really don't know where
they are.

B.21:  Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some
experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd
perceive of as genuine concern?

A.22:  I think, yeah, I think they're relatively re-, respectful.  Yeah and, and
concerned that, in as much as they can be.  I, I think sometimes, you know,
I've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for
things, uh, just repetitively --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- and, but things that are not reasonable, #and so# --

B.25:  #Yeah.#

A.26:  -- at some level the, the, the, uh, I'm sure that the, that the, uh, the
staff l-, learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe
they're not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is
just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they
think they need, you know.

B.27:  Yeah.  It, it's possible, I was thinking also that there'd be, there could
be a fair burn out factor --

A.28:  Oh, yeah.

B.29:  -- um, in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are
sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of
as rational need.

A.30:  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing though that'll, that, that I, I saw that was
really nice.  We saw a husband and wife, we used to see a husband and wife in
there, uh, together and they were in the same room which not all husband and
wives were but these two were.

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture
from their house --

B.33:  Uh-huh.  #So it# -- 

A.34:  -- #And so,#

B.35:  -- gives them a sense of identity.

A.36:  Yeah, you walked in there and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-,
you, you walk into some rooms and there's, it's completely generic.  There's
nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it.
But this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid of all of the sort of
standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their
stuff from their house and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been, it
was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a
sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, #uh,# 

B.37:  #Yeah,# I, I think part of what you're saying matches what I h-, have read.
I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences
were people who, uh, were adequately deficient in their abilities, #uh# --

A.38:  #Yeah.#

B.39:  -- physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.  But I
also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because
I think they provide, um, a lot of social activities.

A.40:  Huh.  #Yeah.#

B.41:  #Uh,# the, one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely
lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on
vacation.  Uh, #and,# 

A.42:  #Huh.#  (( )) temporary.  I, that, that's, that's new to me.  I,

B.43:  Well I think it, I think t-, it was sort of on the grounds that they were
considering whether she would live there and I feel like, the whole vocabulary
of this is very loaded if you think of words like, like put her in there.

A.44:  Right, right.

B.45:  And there, there's so much,
