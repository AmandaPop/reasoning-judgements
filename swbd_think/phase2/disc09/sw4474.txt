==========================================================================

B.1:  Any, uh, child care situations or experiences?

@A.2:  [TV] I, I have had.  Uh, I did a stint as a single parent for awhile and
my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school.  And I thought that, that
was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would
fill those small time slots early in the morning and after school.  What you
were left with were, uh, high school girls or boys --

B.3:  Right.

A.4:  -- and, uh, never mind that they had all those noble, uh, qualities like,
yo-, you know, the same philosophy of raising children [laughter] that you did
[laughter].  You were probably lucky to get anybody because you weren't paying
them very much and, uh, it was just a short period of time.  So --

B.5:  (( )).

A.6:  -- uh, it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch T V with them.
It, it wasn't the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had
small children and you had child raising thoughts in mind.  It was kind of a
temporary, uh, babysitting kind of thing.  #Have you# --

B.7:  #Yeah, right.#

A.8:  -- dealt with that?

B.9:  Well, I've got three kids.  The oldest is nine and the youngest is three.
And we have, actually, a live in child care worker here that we, you know, a
nanny that lives here.  And that makes it very easy for us.

A.10:  Oh.  Are you pleased with the situation?

B.11:  Yeah.  We've had, um, we're on our, um, our third.  Our, our, our second
long-term person, you know.  That's been just about two years for each of the
two people that we've had.

A.12:  Huh.

B.13:  And prior to that we had to take child care.  We took the kids to somebody
else's home and that worked out okay but it wasn't that great.

A.14:  It wasn't convenient.

B.15:  Well, you know, it was just, it was partly the convenience and partly, you
know, the woman, the women that took care of our kids, also had kids of their
own.  And [inhaling] the households were a little hectic.  You know how it
sometimes is.

A.16:  Huh.  I understand from people who have live in help, au pairs and, and,
you know, just people who live with them, that very often you end up involved
in their personal problems and they're taking care of your kids and you're
taking care of them [laughter].  Do you find that?

B.17:  Oh, yes.  Definitely.  Without a doubt.  I'm, [inhaling] you know, it's
like having a, a, young adult in the family just about.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  But that's okay.  I mean, yo-, you know, as long as their problems don't
get too far out of hand [inhaling].  #Well,# 

A.20:  #You# said you have a couple of changes.  Do the kids get attached to one
person and then it's a problem to wean them off them?

B.21:  A little bit of a problem.  But, you know, that's just reality of it
[noise].  And, you know, you have to work with them and tell them ahead of
time that somebody's leaving and somebody else is ((going to be)) coming in
[inhaling] and help them adjust to the situation.

A.22:  How old are the kids?

B.23:  Oh, the youngest is three and the oldest is nine.  And the middle one is
six.  And the after school {mispronounced} school situation is great.  It's
really convenient to have somebody whose job it is to make sure that they get
home and, and, you know, are taken care of properly.

A.24:  Huh.  I imagine that is a luxury of #[laughter] sorts.#

B.25:  #Oh, yeah [laughter].#  [Sigh] It, it's expensive.  It'll, it'll probably
have to change when they get, you know, all old enough to go to school.  (( ))
of some after school service.  Our local Y M C A has something like.

A.26:  Uh-huh.  

B.27:  (( )). 

A.28:  Have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want,

B.29:  [Cough].

A.30:  your children raised?  What your philosophies are?  

B.31:  Well, yeah to a certain extent.  Uh, I guess, you know, my wife does more
of that sort of, I mean, she, she and the, and the caretaker have intense
discussions about that and I suppose I'm sort of a slug for not getting more
involved but that's the way it is [laughter].

A.32:  [Laughter] You just appreciate the situation [laughter].  Oh.

B.33:  Yeah.  Oh it works out pretty well.  I think it's a good plan.  Uh, I think
it's kind of disgraceful that it's so hard for so many people.

A.34:  Well, I, you know, I think this, the thing is, uh, 

B.35:  [Cough].

A.36:  your situation is what I would call ideal [swallowing].  #But it's# --

B.37:  #Well, yeah.#

A.38:  -- probably taking both you wor-, you know, you and your wife working to
afford this person, isn't that so?

B.39:  Oh, no doubt.  If one of us got laid off, she'd be gone in two seconds I'm
afraid.  I'm, or have to #(( )).#

A.40:  #Right.# When I was home by myself and I had a, uh, an eight year old and a
six year old, uh, there aren't that many choices and that's the scary part.
You're just happy to get someone.  You know, you really are in such desperate
need.  And if your child's sick, there's the panic.  It's like I can't stay
home.  What'll I do?  And, you know, you import grandma from the other town to
come over.  It was an emergency, [laughter] you know.  Christmas vacation
comes around and then you've got to fill in that block of time [/TV].

B.41:  Oh, we've got those situations and, you know, we've got to deal with that
kind of stuff.  But, but it's absolutely, you know, situation like ours, you
know, where we could make enough money to cover it properly.  You know, both,
we both work and then we pay the, pay the nanny and we pay the ((comp-,))
workers compensation insurance and we pay the, the withholding taxes.
