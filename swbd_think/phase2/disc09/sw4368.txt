A.1:  What do you do in terms of exercise, if anything?

B.2:  E-, exercising, uh, I play w-, uh, wally ball.  Are you familiar with that?

@A.3:  No, I'm not.

B.4:  I belong to a club, uh, uh, near where I live.  Or, uh, actually where I
work, uh, in Salem, New Hampshire.  And they, uh, it's on a racquet ball court
and you set up a net and you play wally ball.  It's just like volley ball but
with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls
[inhaling] to help put the ball over or that type of thing.

A.5:  Wow [laughter].

B.6:  Uh, so it's, it's kind of more fast paced than, uh, volley ball.

A.7:  How many people play?

B.8:  Uh, you can play up to, uh, four or five on each side.  Which is quite a
few people in such a small space.

A.9:  I bet [laughter].

B.10:  Uh, uh, but we usually play two and two.  Uh, sometimes three, uh, three
and three.  Depending on how many people are willing to get up that early
since we play before work.

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  Uh, so we play that a couple of times a week.  And then I also play pick up
games of back, basketball in the mornings as well.  So that's usually the
extent of my exercise [laughter].  It's kind of crazy.

A.13:  [Laughter] Well, I take a, an aerobics class three nights a week.

B.14:  Huh.

A.15:  And it's at the fitness center.  I actually work for an electronics company
but we have a, a fitness center at, there at the building.

B.16:  Oh, really.

A.17:  And I take, uh, this aerobics class which is a great class.  It's what they
call a circuit class.  Where you do a few minutes of aerobic exercise and then
you break and do some weight work --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to
the elastic bands or whatnot but it's, it's broken up, for an hour.

B.20:  Now are these, is this what they call high impact or is #this?#

A.21:  #No,# no.  This is low impact.  This is safe stuff [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter] Now is the high impact really that dangerous for you?  

A.23:  I, I think it is.  Uh, I took a high, low impact class at the local Y a
couple of years ago and it just seemed like I was on the verge of getting hurt
in terms of knees or back or something like #that.#

B.24:  #Wow.#

A.25:  #Uh,# 

B.26:  #That,# that's amazing.  I'd taken some dance courses in, in, uh, school
and I don't know, it, they seem like they would be classified as high impact.
But maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring.

A.27:  Yeah.  Well I think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that it's so
jarring and you don't, with the low impact you always have one foot on the
floor.  #You could# --

B.28:  #Oh, okay.#  

A.29:  -- get pretty strenuous #[laughter] doing that sort of stuff.#

B.30:  #[Laughter]# Well, see that's the thing.  I see some of these people doing
low impact and I'm like what's the difference [laughter].  These people are
really working up a sweat.

A.31:  Yeah.  Well, I think it has to do with number of feet on the floor #and
how# --

B.32:  #Right.#

A.33:  -- much bouncing around you do and that sort of #thing.#   

B.34:  #Huh.#

A.35:  Like the class I'm in now does not do jumping jacks.  

B.36:  Okay.  #Because both# --

A.37:  #But, we# --

B.38:  -- feet can't be on the floor at one time.

A.39:  -- right, but, but we certainly get our heart rates up.  

B.40:  Huh.

A.41:  Just from the, the marching and, and all that that we do so.

B.42:  Which is I guess the whole point of it.

A.43:  Yeah, I think so.

B.44:  Now, tha-, you say do this at work?  

A.45:  It, it's at a fitness center that's associated with the company where I
work, yes.

B.46:  Do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits?

A.47:  Uh, no I have to pay to join.  

B.48:  Oh, okay.

A.49:  Uh, but it runs [sigh], oh I think the class is, let's see I pay about ten
dollars a month to be a member of this fitness center.

B.50:  Huh.

A.51:  And, and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in ter-, you
know, any, anything from chess,

B.52:  [Noise].

A.53:  clubs to flying clubs [laughter] anything.  

B.54:  ((Gee)).

A.55:  And, uh, then it's an extra forty dollars for an eight weeks aerobics
class.  #And I# --

B.56:  #Huh.#

A.57:  -- think it's pretty competitive with most {mispronounced} health, most
health centers.  And they, they have a swimming pool and a gym #and all 
kinds# --

B.58:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.59:  -- of, all kinds of the Nautilus equipment.  

B.60:  I was going to say, do they have the free weights circuit and the Nautilus
circuit and all those things?

A.61:  Yeah.  I, I did some of that but it, the time it takes is just [laughter].

B.62:  Exactly.

A.63:  It, uh, I don't know.  Once I, I get through with the aerobics session, I'm
ready to go home and eat dinner #[laughter].#

B.64:  #[Laughter]# So you, so you exercise in the evenings?

A.65:  Yes.  

B.66:  That's interesting.  Uh, I, I don't know.  It, my schedule, I guess, is
more, I get up at about, uh, five thirty and then I go and play wally ball
from six thirty to say eight.  And then, I, uh, shave and shower and do that
stuff, uh, at the gym and then I'm at work at eight thirty.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  So, it's all kind of in, in the morning.  But by the end, by mid-afternoon,
I'm like ugh #[laughter].#

A.69:  #[Laughter].#  

B.70:  Or depending on how the game went, [laughter] it could be like that right
after, uh, right in the morning getting to work.

A.71:  Yeah.  W-, 

B.72:  So, it, it's interesting a different schedule.  Uh, uh, you don't feel more
tired toward, I guess, well I guess you would, uh, going home for dinner and
then you're, uh, and then you're, I, I'm sure, zonked.

A.73:  Well the advantage is sometimes I'm too tired to eat #[laughter].#

B.74:  #[Laughter].#  

A.75:  Now, I mean, they really offer classes in the mornings.  And there's even
one class at noon.  But I can't really see breaking up the middle of the day.
Going off and doing aerobics.  Taking a shower #[laughter]# --

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  -- getting back to work.

B.78:  No.  I know some people who do that as well and I can't understand that
either.  I mean, you know, I, in the morning I come to, uh, uh, work with, uh,
wet hair and, you know, and kind of, not breathless, but just,
