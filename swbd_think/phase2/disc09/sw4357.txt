A.1:  Hi [screeching] {sounds like a chair being dragged across the floor}.  Uh,
the most experience I know about that is just when we had my grandma and she
lived with us when I was a little girl for about three or four years.

@B.2:  [Rustling] Uh-huh.

A.3:  And then we had to put her in a rest home.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  #Cause# --

A.5:  #And,# 

B.6:  -- you couldn't take care of her anymore, huh?

A.7:  Yeah.  She had to have nurses care.

B.8:  Yeah.  #That's# --

A.9:  #And,# 

B.10:  -- rough isn't it?  

A.11:  Yeah.  It was a really hard decision.  Because I, she had nine kids and
they had all decided that between the nine of them, they could keep her at
their home.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  Wow.

A.13:  But, uh, her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that.  She
needed an I V and things.

B.14:  Yeah.  That's really hard.  My grandma is, uh, [lipsmack] just turned
ninety.

A.15:  Oh, wow.

B.16:  And she's still on her own.

A.17:  Oh, my goodness.

B.18:  And she's down in Phoenix.  And I don't know what we'll do when she can't
take care of herself.  Her, her son, my dad is dead.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And she has a daughter, [inhaling] my aunt, uh, who lives in another state.
But, uh, #she,# 

A.21:  #And then# there's just the grandkids?

B.22:  Uh, well I'm the, uh, yeah, I'm, my sister and I are the gr-, are her only
grandkids.

A.23:  Oh, wow.

B.24:  So, I don't, I don't know what's going to happen with her.  But she's
amazingly strong.  #Uh,# 

A.25:  #Yeah.#  That's what's neat is when they don't have to go in --  

B.26:  #Yeah.#

A.27:  -- #to# a rest home or anything.

B.28:  But I don't know.  I guess, uh, [sigh] most of us, uh, probably end up
there sooner or, sooner or later.

A.29:  Yeah.  My grandpa lived to be ninety-four and --

B.30:  Oh, my gosh [laughter].

A.31:  -- his grandma, or his wife was, uh, ten years younger than him.

B.32:  [Squeak] Uh-huh.

A.33:  And she kept him at home.  His, uh, about the last two years of his life,
she had him in a hospital bed.  #And# --

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  -- you know, the port-a-potty and stuff she, he couldn't get up or
anything.  But she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and
she never did [laughter].

B.36:  Boy, that's amazing.  That's a [squeak] lot of stress [laughter].

A.37:  Oh, yeah.  ((Uh)), she has osteopor-, (( )) I don't know how to say it.

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  Anyway, where their back bends and stuff and the bones --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- deteriorate and it really did a toll on her.

B.42:  [Sniffing] Uh-huh.

A.43:  Lifting him and stuff.  But she, she would have died before she let anyone
put him in there.  In a rest home.

B.44:  [Lipsmack] Amazing.  

A.45:  But when my grand, when my one grandma that did go in the rest home, we
found a really nice one.  The, you know, we'd go visit every night --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and #she only.#

B.48:  #Every night?#  Wow.  That's dedicated.

A.49:  [Laughter] Well she was only there for about a month and #she was# --

B.50:  #Oh, I see.#

A.51:  -- really bad.  We, you know, we knew it was coming.  And I, you know, we
felt really bad for putting her there [laughter] and stuff.

B.52:  Huh [laughter].

A.53:  She was unconscious and so, I don't know, a lot of people say she didn't
even know she was there.  But, still, it was nice to be with her and stuff.

B.54:  Yeah.  It's a tough emotional, uh, issue.

A.55:  Well nowadays, the expense is going so crazy.  I mean, some people they
need it but they can't afford it.  And #those# --

B.56:  #Yep.#

A.57:  -- are the families I feel so bad for.  

B.58:  Yeah, that's tough.

A.59:  You could lose your whole retirement or whatever just --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- taking and, you know, nowadays, a lot of kids are taking care of their
parents.  You know, because they can't afford a rest home or whatever.  And
that does a double toll on the kids.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  I don't know if I could #ever# --

B.64:  #Whoo.#

A.65:  -- put my parents in a rest home but I don't know how we would afford it
either.

B.66:  I remember one time I was, uh, [laughter] in a mexican restaurant here in
Seattle.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And, uh, I, I was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and I
overheard some [squeak] folks in the next booth who, I think some of them
worked at the restaurant.  They were [sniffing] a little younger than me.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  And they were talking about the differences between, I don't know whether
they were from Mexico or, or, but they were, you know,

A.71:  [Thumping].

B.72:  definitely Latin American.

A.73:  Uh-huh [thumping] [throat_clearing] {background}.

B.74:  They were talking about the differences between, uh, how, uh, [squeak] our
country cares for old people and what it was like back home.  Yeah and they,

A.75:  [Thumping].

B.76:  were just appalled that anybody could [laughter] put somebody in a, you
know, #in a rest home.#

A.77:  #Oh, really.#

B.78:  Yeah.  They weren't, course they weren't talking about, uh, where, you
know, you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was #it# --

A.79:  #Right.#

B.80:  -- you know, they would come from large extended families where, you know,
the, the old people [squeak] were, uh, were at home.

A.81:  Living all together weren't they?

B.82:  Yeah.  #And, uh# --

A.83:  #Yeah.#

B.84:  -- most people don't want to live that way today #[laughter] in this
country [laughter].#

A.85:  #[Laughter]# I don't even know if I can handle living with my parents, let
alone #three generations [laughter].#

B.86:  #Yeah [laughter].  God.# Yeah.  I don't know I, and I've been single so
long I don't even know if I could handle living with a wife #[laughter].#

A.87:  #[Laughter]#  #That is a challenge [laughter].#

B.88:  #I'm probably qu-, incorrigible ((yeah)) [laughter].#

A.89:  You know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be
with, you know, people with their same interest and their same age and stuff,
but --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- I don't know.  I, I would never want to be in a rest home.  

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  I really don't think I'd want to.  

B.94:  Well, my grandma's in a retirement community now and, uh, seems to like it
there a lot and stays really active.

A.95:  Does she have a home or an apartment?
