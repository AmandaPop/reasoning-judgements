A.1:  (( )).

B.2:  Well, we have, we used to, when I was younger -- 

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  -- we'd go every weekend.  

A.5:  ((All right)).  

B.6:  But we haven't done m-, l-, whole lot of it lately.  

A.7:  Yeah.  I'm kind of into it.  I'm, uh, kind of a sailor.  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  I'm up in Minneapolis now, but I was in Florida [thumping], so, uh,
[sniffing] yeah, I was kind of into it for a while there.

B.10:  Were you sailboating?  

A.11:  Yeah, for the most part.  Yeah -- 

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- I had a little sail,

B.14:  Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here [laughter].

A.15:  No [laughter].  

B.16:  Just motorboat's all we,

A.17:  What part of Texas you from?  

B.18:  Uh, Nacogdoches.  

A.19:  Okay, whereabouts is that?  

B.20:  That's between Houston and Dallas.  

A.21:  Okay, all right.  

B.22:  It's the oldest town in Texas.  

A.23:  Is that right?  

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  Wow, that's pretty wild.  

B.26:  We have, uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches, so we do a lot
of boating on.

A.27:  Okay, so you got some lakes around you can do that on.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  You do skiing and stuff or,

B.30:  Yeah, little bit.  

A.31:  Yeah?  All right.  

B.32:  Just got through snow skiing [laughter].  

A.33:  Yeah?  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  All right.  

B.36:  Just came back from Denver but,

A.37:  Yeah, that sounds good.  Yeah, we've, uh, our, the snow up here is really
kind of starting to melt now.

B.38:  Yeah, it, it, it was heavy when we were there though.  

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  I didn't see any boats there, though.  

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  Not, not, not too many, no.  But, uh, no, I just got back from a weekend.
We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.  It was
pretty nice, but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took
out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff.

B.44:  Yeah?  

A.45:  That's a lot of fun, but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,
they're kind of into it.

B.46:  Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats.  

A.47:  Oh, yeah, I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here.  

A.51:  Yeah.  All right.  So, where about in Texas is that?  Is that centrally
located or,

B.52:  It's, uh, well, you ever heard of Lufkin?  

A.53:  Uh, no, what, what major city is nearby?  

B.54:  Houston.  

A.55:  Okay, and that's south or [thumping] north of there or something?

B.56:  Let me see, Houston's north.  

A.57:  Yeah?  Okay.  

B.58:  Dallas is south.  

A.59:  Oh, [thumping] okay, all right.  Well, that sounds pretty good.  Does, uh,
I guess the weather, does that stay pretty constant there or,

B.60:  It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons.

A.61:  Yeah?  

B.62:  Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon.

A.63:  Okay, well, that's pretty temperate.  Yeah, that's not too bad.  But, uh,
[sniffing] yeah, have you done, uh, any other boating then or,

B.64:  No, I hadn't done any in a l-, uh, lately, but that's all, I used to ha-,
uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop.

A.65:  Yeah?  

B.66:  And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating
every day just about.

A.67:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, I,

B.68:  And we had a n-, different boat every day.  

A.69:  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah, I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when
I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle, I used to sail about
every day.  I'd work, go to work,

B.70:  I'd like to do some sailing.  

A.71:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  It's, uh, especially if you get a, a pretty fast
boat like those catamarans are pretty fast.

B.72:  #Yeah, what,# 

A.73:  #You can actually,#
 
B.74:  Do, if you get one like that ((do)) have somebody teach you that or they
just, 

A.75:  Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life.  Uh,
my family's pretty into it --

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six and then, uh
[sniffing],

B.78:  Is it pretty easy?  

A.79:  Yeah, it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while,
you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and
the physics behind it.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  So it's, it's not too bad, it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think
and, uh, [thumping] generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten
into it, but some people are more motorboaters, you know --

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  -- which is fine.  

B.84:  Well, that's about all we have [laughter].

A.85:  Yeah, yeah, lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing, but,
then, again, they may nev-, m-, they may never have tried anything like, uh,
catamaran --

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed.  You know, you
actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,
they get so fast, you know.

B.88:  I didn't know that.  

A.89:  Yeah, they get pretty quick, but --

B.90:  That -- 

A.91:  -- uh,

B.92:  -- that would be something.  

A.93:  Yeah, yeah, I haven't, I haven't personally done that, but, uh, the races,
I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, [sniffing] races catamarans in the
summertime --

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  -- and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it.  He's got a good, uh,

B.96:  What kind of, what lake do you all use?   

A.97:  Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit -- 

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his
sailing.  Uh, for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, [thumping] in about a
month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast.  We're about
[thumping] thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast, and there's a lot
of places there you can go, you know.  So, uh, so that's a good thing.

B.100:  Yeah.  

A.101:  But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?  

B.102:  Uh, I build transformers.  

A.103:  Oh, really?  

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  Okay, is that for T I or,

B.106:  No, it's for Cooper Industries.  

A.107:  Okay.  Are they primarily electronic, then?  

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  Okay.  

B.110:  Well --

A.111:  Well that,  

B.112:  -- they have a, you know, worldwide, but --

A.113:  Right.  

B.114:  -- w-, all we do here is make transformers -- 

A.115:  Oh, okay. 

B.116:  -- electronics and stuff like that.  

A.117:  Great.  Yeah, how do you like it down there in Texas?  

B.118:  It's real nice.  

A.119:  Yeah?  

B.120:  Been here all my life.  

A.121:  Oh, no doubt.  

B.122:  Yeah.  

A.123:  Okay.  I've never been to Texas.  I've been to Oklahoma, but, uh, that's
about as far as,

B.124:   Oh, it's, n-, Oklahoma's nothing like it.  

A.125:  Yeah?  Okay, well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well
[laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter].
