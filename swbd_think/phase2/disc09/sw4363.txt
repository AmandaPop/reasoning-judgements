A.1:  Wh-, #what's# --

B.2:  #Uh.#  

A.3:  -- your, uh, are you into the Cowboys?

@B.4:  Oh, God, no [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  Uh, no, I'm not, I haven't been, I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a
Cowboys' man.  I like Philadelphia Eagles.

A.7:  Oh, yeah?

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  #((Well, that))# --

B.10:  #That's# my favorite team, so.  

A.11:  -- that's all #right.#

B.12:  #Uh,# now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll be, do a
little bit better.  They didn't do too bad last season.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  But, I hope they can do better.  How about yourself?

A.15:  Well, I don't know.  I kind of go back and forth, uh, depending on whose
really hot and whose not.  I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in #a lot of
respects.#

B.16:  #Uh-huh.#

A.17:  But, uh, I guess if I have, uh, my druthers, [sniffing] I'd probably go for
the Seattle Seahawks.

B.18:  Oh, tha-, 

A.19:  I kind of like them.

B.20:  Yeah.  That's another one of my favorites.  

A.21:  Yeah.  #They're kind of,# 

B.22:  #They're not,# they're not my favorite totally.  But I do like them.  I
like, yeah.

A.23:  Yo-,

B.24:  Seahawks are good.  They, now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a
little bit for them but --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- you know, he,

A.27:  To be honest with you, I, I probably watch, uh, college a little bit more
than I do pro.

B.28:  Really?

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  Huh.

A.31:  I kind of like college #actually.  Quite a bit.#

B.32:  #Yeah.  That's kind of,# that's kind of strange.  It's too much running for
me in, in college football.  I like --

A.33:  #Is it?#

B.34:  -- #I like# the pros.  They do, you know, it's more high tech, more, you
know, players are apt to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs
and their, when it's a job and not just, #you know# --

A.35:  #[Sniffing] Yeah, yeah.#  #That could be.#

B.36:  -- #when you're# getting paid millions to do it, you ac-, I think they take
it to another level.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  But I can see it's more, you know, grunted out, run the ball type.  College
football is a little bit different but,

A.39:  Yeah.  You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.

B.40:  Who-, whose that?

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  Notre Dame [laughter]?

A.43:  No.  I root for Nebraska quite a bit.

B.44:  N-, Nebraska [laughter].  Yeah there's a running team.  

A.45:  Ye-, [Laughter].

B.46:  Yeah.  That, that, that's boring for me.  I, I'll take the passing teams
any day.

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  #But,# 

A.49:  #Well,# I can see, I can see definitely how you get into that.  I, to be
honest with you, I find th-, that too much running gets pretty boring as well
and.

B.50:  Yeah.  It's just, it's four yards, three yards --

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  -- eight yards, tackle.  That's, you know, it gets kind of monotonous.
After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and
then just, just #to# --

A.53:  #Sure.#

B.54:  -- juice it up a little bit and #but,#

A.55:  #Well,# I think they're starting to realize that.  A lot of the, like the
big eight teams that used to run so much.  I think they're starting to realize
that they just can't compete anymore.

B.56:  Yeah.  It's high dollar.  You know, it's all, it's all money now.  Even
college #is all# --

A.57:  #Right.#

B.58:  -- can we get on T V so.

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  That's, #that's,# 

A.61:  #So,# uh, what's d-, this World League is coming in?  Uh, that's getting
ready to start up, right?

B.62:  Right.  Yeah.

A.63:  Have you followed that very much or,

B.64:  Uh, not really.  I, I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.
I think --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- it's basically, you know, it's, it's an institution.  It's like if we
tried to start something to take over major league baseball.  It's just, I
just, you know.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  I mean, it, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.  But it's never
going to be #the next,# 

A.69:  #Right.  It can# take over a small market #share but nothing really,# 

B.70:  #Yeah.  (( ))# it's going to take a little bit.  Some people are going to
watch it but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday
afternoon or anything, you know.

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  It's just, it's never going to reach that, that standard but,

A.73:  Yeah.  I think I agree with you.  It's, it's kind of interesting to see,
uh, to see their claim of, you know, like world football.  But, when in
reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else #[laughter] you know
[laughter].#

B.74:  #Yeah, [laughter] yeah.# It's kind of, it's kind of strange.  Uh, I guess
we're the only ones,

A.75:  [Rustling].

B.76:  who take it that far.  Everybody else still nuts over soccer but,

A.77:  Yeah.  Actually, uh, I kind of like soccer.  #I've# --

B.78:  #Yeah?#

A.79:  -- never really played it but, uh, I like the idea.  It's, it's an
interesting game to watch.  That and rugby.  I've like to watch,

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  rugby every #now and then.#

B.82:  #Yeah or# Australian rules football.  That's,

A.83:  Yeah, whatever you want to call it there.

B.84:  Yeah.  That's some brutal stuff there.  That's, that's worse than football
as #far as violence I think.  Golly.  Those guys kill each other out there.
Rugby is something else.#

A.85:  #Yeah, [laughter] (( )).  Yeah, there's an element# there's definitely an
element of stupidity in there somewhere #[laughter].#

B.86:  #[Laughter] Yeah.# That's just wild.  That's why it's a go-, a big college
thing.

A.87:  Yeah [laughter].

B.88:  Rugby is definitely big in college because it's something a bunch of
fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
[laughter].

A.89:  Right, exactly [sniffing].  #Yeah.  Tha-,#

B.90:  #So, yeah,# I could see the feel for that.  But it's, it's pretty, it's fun
to play.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  I'll give it that.  It is fun to play.  #If you don't value your# --

A.93:  #You've played it then?#

B.94:  -- very much.  But, you know, I don't think rugby will ever be professional
but --

A.95:  No I doubt it, #you know.  Not, at# --

B.96:  -- #it, it's, it's,# 

A.97:  -- least not in this country anyway.

B.98:  No.  You can't stay healthy and do that.  That's a rough game.

A.99:  Yeah.  It is.

B.100:  But, uh, I don't know.  I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this
year.  So you,

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  the, the Seahawks are an up and down [laughter] kind of team.

A.103:  They really are.  #Yeah.#

B.104:  #Yeah.# My, my, it's kind of odd.  My roommate that I live with here, he's,
uh, he's lived in Pennock, Minnesota.  Do you know where that is?

A.105:  Uh, no I don't.  #To tell you the truth, I'm,# 

B.106:  #It, it's a small town.# It's about two hours, it's in like central
Minnesota.  It's a couple of hours, uh, west of Minneapolis.

A.107:  Okay.

B.108:  But, uh,

A.109:  To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.  

B.110:  You just live there now.

A.111:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm up here for a year on an internship.

B.112:  Uh-huh.  Well he's,

A.113:  But I, I actually live in Florida.

B.114:  Live [laughter] in Florida.

A.115:  Yeah.  

B.116:  Like the Seahawks [laughter].

A.117:  Well, you know, I [laughter].

B.118:  [Laughter] Hey, #I, I# -- 

A.119:  #I mean, who, who# --

B.120:  -- I've only been to Philadelphia twice and I, you know, I, I #still 
like,# 

A.121:  -- #who# the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right [laughter]?

B.122:  Really, #really.#

A.123:  #I mean,# I guess I could go for Miami but --

B.124:  Yeah, but.

A.125:  -- I don't know.  I'm from, I root for Nebraska so I'm, I don't have a real
love for Miami [laughter] anyway.

B.126:  [Laughter].

A.127:  But, I don't know, I, I guess, I get, into pretty much,
