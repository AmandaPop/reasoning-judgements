B.1:  Hi {very faint}.

A.2:  Okay.  Do you work with a company that, uh, gives drug testing [sniffing]?

@B.3:  Sort of.  I'm a, I'm a student but, uh,

A.4:  [Throat_clearing].

B.5:  I'm in the National Guard and they do a little bit of drug testing.

A.6:  Oh, they do?

B.7:  Yeah.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  What, uh, did they do that before you went in or what?

B.9:  Uh, they, they do it before you go in and, occasionally they'll have a, a
random urinalysis.

A.10:  Oh, they will, huh?

B.11:  Yeah.  So you can't be smoking marijuana in, in the military anymore
[laughter].  

A.12:  Oh.  Okay.  Well, I've, I worked, I don't work right now because my
company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt -- 

B.13:  Oh.

A.14:  -- but, uh, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires
they was going drug, uh, give them drug tests.

B.15:  Oh.

A.16:  But, uh, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that
usually work there, you know, just stayed there because it was, they had been
there for a long, long time.

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  But, uh, [swallowing] actually, I think they should do it.

B.19:  Yeah, I, I believe they should too.

A.20:  You know, uh, I don't think anybody needs anybody that's, to be working
for them that's on drugs --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- of any kind [laughter] you know.

B.23:  Yeah, definitely.

A.24:  But, uh, I don't know whether I believe that they should just randomly do
it.  I think they should kind of warn them, like, you know, well we're going
to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, you know --

B.25:  #Oh.# 

A.26:  -- #that# this is what is going to happen.  #And# -- 

B.27:  #Uh,#

A.28:  -- then if you don't like it, why then, you know, you'll have to go look
for a job someplace else.

B.29:  But after you, you have,

A.30:  [Throat_clearing].

B.31:  to do randomly otherwise people will cheat.

A.32:  Well, I suppose you are right there too, you know.

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  Uh, #personally I,# 

B.35:  #They, I know# when I was doing my, uh, basic training in A I T --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- there was guys who would fool around and then when that urinalysis came
around they would be all scared.  So it does work, it is effective.

A.38:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Huh.

B.39:  The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped
and, uh, you do get caught, it is kind of, kind of harsh.

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  Well, I suppose they fire you and everything right then, huh?  Or what do
they do with you guys if, that you guys get,

B.43:  Uh, we get counseling and, uh, I think part of our pay is docked #if
we're# --

A.44:  #Oh I,# 

B.45:  -- first time offenders.

A.46:  Oh, I see.

B.47:  I really don't, I, I haven't, I don't do any drugs so I don't know.

A.48:  Yeah, well I don't either.  I wouldn't even think about it #[laughter].# 

B.49:  #[Laughter].#

A.50:  I think anybody that does them are dumb, #you know.#

B.51:  #Crazy.#  #Yeah, yeah.#

A.52:  #Yeah#, really.  You're so stupid, ((God)) and you just watch it on T V and
see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.  #You don't,# 

B.53:  #Yeah, wastes# your future.

A.54:  Yeah, re-, really dumb, huh.

B.55:  Yeah.  

A.56:  But, uh, [throat_clearing].  Let's see, what else was I going to say here.

B.57:  Uh, what do you think about our, uh, like, uh, other government agencies
testing?  Do you think our government agencies should test?

A.58:  Yeah, I think so.  I think they all should test really --  

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  -- you know.  Uh, it just seems like there is so much more of it going on
anymore --

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  -- that, I don't know what's wrong with the people, uh, but I think that
the, the government should do something about stopping it completely.  About
it coming into our country.  You know, they just slap somebody's little hand,
and, you know, well, don't do that again and --

B.63:  Oh, I know, yeah. #((They aren't)).#

A.64:  -- #and then# th-, you know, they'll get out and they're right back at it
again.

B.65:  Yeah.  Right now it is, it's too lucrative for the drug dealers so -- 

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- th-, the risks are worth it for them.

A.68:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

B.69:  #Yeah.#

A.70:  But, uh, other than that, why, I don't know.  Like I say, maybe one of
these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job, you
know, since my company went bankrupt #and# --

B.71:  #Yeah.#

A.72:  -- I'll see what they do, you know.  But, like I say, I, I wouldn't care
because I, I don't, I don't even smoke so [laughter] --

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  -- they can test me all I want.  I wonder what (( )) if you take medicine
if that would effect it.

B.75:  Oh see, that's, tha-, it is a problem.  Sometimes some medicines will give
off a, a false positive.

A.76:  Yeah, see #now that# --

B.77:  #I've heard# of, I've heard of that, yeah.

A.78:  -- that would be really unfair then, huh?

B.79:  Yeah.

A.80:  You know.

B.81:  (( )) I believe you should have the testing but they should be, like, if
you get, if you get a positive, they should double check you and still give
you the benefit of a doubt.

A.82:  Yeah.  Find out what, you know, if you have been taking some kind of
medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.

B.83:  Uh-huh, yeah.

@@A.84:  But, uh, well I guess that's about all we can talk about.  I think our
five minutes is about up anyhow.

B.85:  Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.

A.86:  Okay, Lewis, and maybe I'll talk to you again.

B.87:  Okay [laughter].

A.88:  Alrighty.  

B.89:  #Bye-bye.#

A.90:  #Bye-bye.#  Bye [clicking].
