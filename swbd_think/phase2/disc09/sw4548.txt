============================================================================

A.1:  Well, actually, uh, 

B.2:  [Baby].

A.3:  I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas #I don't think I
agree with,# 

B.4:  #Oh really.#

A.5:  No.

B.6:  You don't believe in it?

A.7:  Uh, I wouldn't say that.  I think I would have said that a few years ago.

B.8:  [Baby].

A.9:  When I was younger I thought it was, uh, [sniffing] a sign of a civilized
society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment but, um, uh, maybe slowly
changing my opinion.

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.  I still think it's sort of true that a
more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but I'm
beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter] You sound a lot like a friend of mine.  A --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- a girl I hang out with.  She has very, very black and white [baby]
opinions, you know. There's no gray in her opinions, you know.  She, she
probably would agree more with you but, but I don't know.  I think I would
rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the [baby] opportunity
to get out and do it again.  I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime
like a murder touch my immediate family --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to,
to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for
what they've done.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  And we see that more and more.  Like in our state right now, there's a
fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- you know, that's fourteen years old.  What's he going to be doing when
he turns into an adult.

A.21:  Yeah.  I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,
but, uh, 

B.24:  No it doesn't but,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].

B.26:  it costs less.

A.27:  Yeah.  That, that's #a factor.#

B.28:  #And,# yeah, to me it is.  I mean, I work and I pay my taxes and I lived
out in Texas for a little while and they're and that's a pretty heavy state
compared to Georgia [/baby]. I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to
each his own even than we are in Georgia.

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.  If I work and
pay my dues --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.  

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues [laughter] --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- then I don't like you very much #anymore.#

A.37:  #Yeah.#  Well, I, the cost is something but it's, but I think it's
relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of,

B.38:  [Noise].

A.39:  dealing with crime and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European
countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment #and they# --

B.40:  #Oh, really.#

A.41:  -- they don't have a crime problem either.  No, you can't, they don't
execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or
Italy either [throat_clearing] and they don't have the crime problems we do.
I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people
enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty.  I think it brings out
the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing and the, #that, that
bothers me.#

B.44:  #You might be right.#

A.45:  But it, but, uh, 

B.46:  I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know, 

A.47:  [Throat_clearing].

B.48:  I would never in a million years want that job --

A.49:  Huh.

B.50:  -- but I do believe it's necessary and I,

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it
because I couldn't --  

A.53:  Huh.

B.54:  -- I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and I
couldn't pull the switch but, #uh,# 

A.55:  #Well actually# I, wha-, the other thing that bothers me is when it
becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really  
think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or
anything else.  I think it just becomes a, uh, [throat_clearing] symbolic I'm
tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the
background while the more important issues get discussed, #uh, uh,# 

B.58:  #Right.#

A.59:  ((Like I said,)) some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place
for capital punishment in the,

B.60:  [Baby].

A.61:  civilized western country.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.  I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against
somebody just because it was for capital punishment #and# --

B.64:  #What# --

A.65:  -- nor the other way around.

B.66:  -- what's making you become more convinced that it might be a
#good way of punishing [/baby]?#

A.67:  #Uh, I guess# I'm, I'm, my view of [sniffing], uh, my, I'm beginning to
believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh,

B.68:  [Baby].

A.69:  costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, [sniffing] uh, than anything
else and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two
friends whose wives were murdered #and, uh# --

B.72:  #Oh, gosh# [baby].

A.73:  -- [Sniffing] I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the
only form of justice in that case.

B.74:  [/Baby] Oh yes, if it ever touched my fam-,
