A.1:  [Music] [talking] [static] (( )) to do for voting?

@B.2:  [Lipsmack] Well I think that, uh, {pause} I guess I j-, [sigh] everybody
knows that education is, is important but I guess the main thing is there's
some things you just don't care about.

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  So if you don't care about them, you don't vote for them, right?

A.5:  One of the biggest stumbling block is at first getting registered.

B.6:  [Inhaling] Yeah.  Although, although, uh, that's, [sigh] there's a lot of
people out there that'll do that for you [inhaling].  That, I just thought of
something now that, that made a big difference to me and, uh, come to think of
it, it's got to do with Jerry Brown and that's.  When I was in, I used to live
in California.  And when he was Secretary of State there, [lipsmack] one of
the things that he did was he sent out a booklet.  And the booklet was, [sigh]
uh, here are the issues.  Here's the pros, here's the cons, here's the pro
rebuttal to the cons and here's the con rebuttal to the pros.  By the time I
got through reading that article, by the time I got through reading that
booklet, I knew exactly what the issues were.

A.7:  Isn't that what you have now?  In Oregon, you have the booklets.

B.8:  Well, we have a little booklet and it says here's the issues.

A.9:  Yep.  And each, uh, party or whatever, against and for the proposition or
but,

B.10:  [Noise] But, for fifty bucks, you can or whatever it is.  Fifty or three
hundred or five hundred or something like that, you can put in a statement for
or against.  But the nice thing about this other thing was that, and, was that
you have, uh, like I say, you have the people say well it's going to, uh, it's
going to reduce taxes and the other people say, yeah, reduce taxes but at the
expense of something else.  And so it was, how shall I say it, it was kind of
focused.  The pros and the cons and then the rebuttal, so I got to see both
sides whereas in the current booklet it just says here's, uh, somebody thinks
it's a good idea, he tells me.  But, you know, are you a, are you involved in
software?

A.11:  Excuse me?

B.12:  Are you a engineer or, or involved in software at all?  

A.13:  Uh, well back, yeah. 

B.14:  Okay.  Well one of the things about a lot of programs is, they tell you
what they do, but they don't tell you what they don't do [phone_ringing].  And
the only way, you know what I mean?  They say, oh look, this is great.  This,
this slices bread but they don't tell you that, [sniffing] that it also mashes
it at the same time.  #And# --

A.15:  #Uh-huh.#

B.16:  -- uh, so that,

A.17:  Yeah, I, I understand that giving the pros and cons and being informed 
but --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- I was thinking also, uh, you can, you should have voter registration by
phone, things like that.

B.20:  Well, out here they do it by, uh, mail.  #You# --

A.21:  #Yeah.#

B.22:  -- can do it by mail.  Tha-, [talking].

A.23:  Well, you, you know, a lot of places do it by mail.  But a lot of people
don't b-, get to the step of putting it into the mail, you know, and, uh, if
you can do it from the phone and pick it up at any time, twenty-four hours a
day and do it, that's, #that'll make,# 

B.24:  #Well, the# problem with that, I think, is fraud.  We haven't #been# --

A.25:  #Well# --

B.26:  -- around voter fraud, uh, too much but,

A.27:  -- well, actually there's, there are ways.  I mean, if they can get the
speaker identity verification, those kind technologies out there, it would
help.  Uh, you know, in terms of verifying who they are and what they're
saying and, and, uh, you know, people could, uh, use that, you know.

B.28:  Or the other option, I guess, is to, I mean, why do you have to even do it
over the phone.  Why couldn't you just walk up to the booth and, [inhaling]
and, uh, register right there.  And then they have with everything hooked up
by computer, you could say okay, you probably #voted.#

A.29:  #Where# do you live.  Yeah.  All that stuff.  Yeah, they don't that which
is a problem.  And, uh, I don't know.  I think, uh, that after you can also,
the problem is also, uh, motivating people to do it.  Seeing that their voting
has an impact on the process.  And people, frankly, don't see any connection
with what they, they vote and what happens.  So they very frustrated and they
don't do anything.  So there's learned helplessness type of, you know, no
matter what I do, it's (( )) not going to help so why bother.  #Uh,#

B.30:  #[Laughter]# That's, that's certainly true too.  There's, uh, the other
side of the coin is that, uh, in the educational side.  The I R S does a
wonderful job, right about now, of putting articles in the paper about, uh,
motiva-, motivating people to turn in their taxes.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Uh, and I don't think the, that very many people try to motivate you to
vote.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  Uh.

A.35:  Well, they sh-, I, you know what?  I think also they should do is build in
the process, the election process, is not just vote getting.  I mean, to get
the candidates saying that not, that their votes aren't any good unless they
also motivate so many percent of the populace to vote.  They could be
identified by them.

B.36:  Oh, I see what you're saying [/talking].

A.37:  So put it in the political process that, that, you know, not only you have
to get petitions in order to get on the ballot but you have to attract, you
know, you have to attract so many people just to come to the polls.  They
don't have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually
vote.  You know, those, something built into the system to motivate people.
To, to bring them into the process.  Especially the people who want to hold
offices.  I mean that's what [/music] [/talking] [/static],
