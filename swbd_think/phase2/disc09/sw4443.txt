A.1:  Do you play?

B.2:  Yeah, I, uh, consider myself a hacker.  How about you?

A.3:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I'm into it.  Uh,

B.4:  Yeah, uh, I'm not as good as I'd like to be but it's a,

A.5:  Is anybody?

B.6:  No [laughter] #I don't think so.#    

A.7:  #[Laughter].#

B.8:  Uh, I'd started playing when I was in elementary school actually.  #We
lived# --

A.9:  #Really?#

B.10:  -- really close to a par three golf course.  And I'd go up there with
friends after school a couple of times every week and then --

A.11:  Oh, wow.

B.12:  -- for, uh, [sigh] for years, I don't know, after elementary school, all
through junior high and stuff, I didn't play cause I think I just got so
frustrated when I was little I'd, my body wasn't, you #know# --

A.13:  #Right.#

B.14:  -- physically developed and all that kind of stuff and then I'd started
picking it up again a couple of years back and I've really been enjoying it.

A.15:  Super.  Yeah, that's kind of the way I did it too actually.  I, I played,
uh, just a tiny bit when I was real young and then, uh, I w-, I got on to a
team in high school but wasn't very good still.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  But, and then quit for awhile and recently I picked it up, like you say,
about a couple of years ago and, uh, I've been playing, you know, off and on
when I can.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter #of course# --

B.20:  #Uh-huh.#

A.21:  -- but I actually live in Florida so, uh --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- uh, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up
a little more regularly.

B.24:  Right.  Th-, the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of
#playing golf.#

A.25:  #I was going# to say [laughter].

B.26:  I mean it's a great game but I mean to play a really nice course, you've
got to have a really big wallet #[laughter], I mean.#

A.27:  #Yeah, that's, that's# true, all too many times.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  Fortunately, uh, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses
that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Uh, one of them is the University of Florida golf course --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- which is open to the public and that's pretty, pretty good.

B.34:  Yeah.  I, uh, attend the Indiana University and it's the same way here.
They have a really nice championship style course that --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- is fairly reasonable to play on.

A.37:  Can you get like a, a student discount type of thing #or,#

B.38:  #Uh, a# little bit but not a whole lot.  I mean I, you'd think you would
[laughter] but, uh, you don't #so.  I,# 

A.39:  #Yeah.  What, what,# what are green fees run there?

B.40:  Uh, well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type
course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course.

A.41:  Okay.  That's, yeah, that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida.
But,

B.42:  Uh-huh.  My dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and I can
play for free there and it's a pretty nice #course.#

A.43:  #Really.#  Oh, that's super.

B.44:  Yeah.  And I guess (( )), well it's free for me #[laughter].#  

A.45:  #Yeah, uh-huh.#

B.46:  Somebody's paying but not me.  

A.47:  Well, that's the way to do it though.

B.48:  Yeah [laughter].

A.49:  That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it
all the time [laughter].

B.50:  Yeah, definitely.  As far as watching golf, I mean, I can watch it on T V
but it's kind of boring.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  It's nice to see those ((who)), guys.  They have such good style that, 
uh --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- it's, uh, [laughter] it's pretty fun to watch.  

A.55:  They need to get a new photography method.

B.56:  [Noise].

A.57:  Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the
ball [laughter] --

B.58:  Right.  #Yeah.#

A.59:  -- #that's,# that's a little difficult.  I mean, it, they do, they do a
generally okay job but like you said, it's, it's kind of boring #actually.#

B.60:  #Uh-huh.#  What I really, I, uh, had a chance, they had the P G A
tournament up in Indianapolis last year --

A.61:  Oh, yeah?

B.62:  -- and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was
really fun.  #I mean you knew it# --

A.63:  #Yeah.  I bet that would be (( )).#

B.64:  -- I never really thought it was, would be that much fun to go to a big
golf tournament and watch but, man, it was, it was something else just to
follow those guys around and actually watch them play.

A.65:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've never been to a tournament.  Uh, you know, looking at it
on T V, you're thinking, man, [laughter] what a boring thing, #you know.#

B.66:  #Right.#  

A.67:  But, uh, that's, that's wild though.  I'll have to see if I can't get a
#chance# -- 

B.68:  #((You got))# --

A.69:  -- to go,

B.70:  -- I mean it's, uh, it's a lot more exciting than actually w-,  than
watching it on T V.  And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them
around, I mean, it's just, watching them the whole time instead of like on T
V, you get to see them make a tee shot --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when they're
putting,

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  but, you know, it's really something else.

A.75:  Yeah, I can imagine.  (( )) What do you do for a living?

B.76:  Uh, I'm a student right now.  

A.77:  Oh, you are?

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  Which, uh, which university?

B.80:  At, uh, Indiana University.

A.81:  Okay.  All right, great.  What are you going into?

B.82:  Uh, I don't really know.  I'm a math computer science major right now.  

A.83:  Okay.  Definitely not golf, right #[laughter]?#

B.84:  #No [laughter].#  I wi-, it'd be nice to be a pro golfer.  I mean, it
seems like that, that would be an okay life #just to hang out and,#

A.85:  #Yeah.  If you're good,# you can really rake in the bucks.  #Wh-, what
was# --

B.86:  #[Laughter] Yeah.#

A.87:  -- what was that movie that they had out?  Th-, there was a movie about a
professional golfer and #I, I# -- 

B.88:  #Huh.#

A.89:  -- can't remember.  It was on network T V a couple of times.

B.90:  Oh, yeah?

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  Well, you know, it seems like, well you go to work every weekend.  Play,
maybe, one, two tournaments a month.  #You come in about tenth, you'd still# --

A.93:  #That's right. (( )).#  

B.94:  -- be doing pretty well.

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  [Laughter] So.  

A.97:  Yeah, that's a good thing.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  But, uh, yeah.  I guess when I get back, I'm going to school in Florida
actually.  Uh, and, fortunately, I've been able to, to play some golf on a
student budget which is --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- [Noise] real helpful, you know.  But, it, it's unfortunate, you know.
You hear about Japan.

B.102:  Right [laughter].

A.103:  I guess, you know, it's, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or
three hundred dollar minimum just to, like to practice even (( )).

B.104:  Yeah.  And those fees to join a club.  Like a million dollars or whatever
is just --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- that is out of control.  

A.107:  [Laughter].

B.108:  [Laughter] I mean you'd really want to [noise], really be liking your
golf.

A.109:  Yeah.  I guess they have those, uh, driving ranges that are actually
stacked one on top of #the other.#

B.110:  #Yeah [laughter],# I saw one of those on T V.  That is pretty #wild.#

A.111:  #(( )).#  Yeah.  Yeah, I, I played, uh, uh, eighteen holes with some
Japanese guys in, in Gainesville, as a matter of fact.  And it was really
wild.  They were into it.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  You know, they kicked our butt all the way to,
