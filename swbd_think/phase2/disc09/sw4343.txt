======================================================================

A.1:  I guess I'll give my opinions here first.

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  Okay, uh, in terms of taxes here, I guess, uh, I feel like we are paying an
awful lot of them, uh, and getting, apparently very little for it.  Uh,
especially since a-, the things that I think that our taxes are going for are,
I, I guess, in my opinion, not the a-, necessarily appropriate things.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  I think that, uh, uh, we should be emphasizing, uh, things like, more like
education and less on, on programs which are permanent black holes which will
never do anything but continue to be, uh, uh, sponges for money.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  I mean, we need to do, uh, programs which are more on the concept of, uh,
well, like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the
housing.

B.8:  [Breathing]. 

A.9:  But, then, turning the housing over.  That, now, see I, I agreed with that
one, and I'm not very often into those kind of, those kind of programs.  But
that one made sense.  Help these people to fix their houses, to improve --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- their, their environment.  I mean, uh, uh, p-, projects were the most
idiotic concept in the world.  You, h-, they had no sense of ownership, no
sense of responsibility.

B.12:  Like a warehouse almost.  

A.13:  I-, well, it was like, it's just a place for you to stay, and you had no,
uh, feeling of, of responsibility, ownership --

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- concern.  Uh, in fact, it was insult-, it was, it was almost insulting,
it was e-, it was so embarrassing that I, you know, I, I, I, I don't know
exactly what the motivations were, but basically, they were destroyed, they
were, they, you know, people would strew feces across the, uh, uh, rooms, you
know, just incredible --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- the abuses that occurred.  

B.18:  Well,   

A.19:  It was obviously a failed concept [static].  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  Okay [laughter].  So, yes, I think we do have problems with taxes
[laughter].

B.22:  Well, the, uh, unfortunate truth is that no matter what sort of a program
or whatever that, gets put out there and made available by the taxpayers'
money --

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  -- there is going to be someone who will abuse it.  They will find a way.
People are very creative, especially those that are on the public dole and
want to be there.  Uh, they can be very creative in their, in their abuses and
not surprisingly, some of the worst offenders are the people who are inside
the system and are in a position to know exactly where the red flags would be,
what they can get away with.  Uh, I happen to work for an assemblyman at one
time, and I saw abuse of power there, uh, really subtle, but it was still
there.  Okay, uh, the man was not a millionaire, uh, however, he could have
never gone to work again and lived comfortably and, uh, he owned a lot of low
income housing for which he got considerable government aid.

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  Refurbish it and,

A.27:  And it's all legal.  

B.28:  Oh, sure.  

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  And, oh, doing a public service.  

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  And l-, like I say, you're right, in that we're paying an awful lot, well,
not really comparatively to --

A.33:  Other countries.  

B.34:  -- uh, other countries especially European countries.  They pay a larger
percentage than we do, but the things that they get in return are more
tangible --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- to the common person -- 

A.37:  Right.  

B.38:  -- national health care -- 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- uh, education systems that, you know, that's one of mine own pet peeves
is how can, how can our teachers be so damned efficient that they can teach
our students in a hundred and eighty days what it takes Europe two hundred and
forty days to teach.  You know?

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  How can they be that good, come on [laughter], come on.

A.43:  Well, I, uh, the-, what it really comes down to the fact that, uh, uh, we
don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  Uh, part, part of the symp-, symptom of a democratic s-, system is that it,
it kind of, uh, freezes itself up.  You very seldom a-, a-, a-, able to do
anything that's strong on either side, whether it be left or right.

B.46:  Right.  

A.47:  [Laughter] I ((mean)), sometimes I say, you know, even though I tend to go
with the, with the conservative line, I sit there and I say, you know, at
least if we did something [laughter], it would be better than what we do now.

B.48:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, h-, it was Ross Perot was speaking in front of the National
Press Club, and he was talking about how people in the government say, well,
you know, we've got a hundred and eighty billion dollars in fraud and
mismanagement, okay, a hundred eighty billion dollars a year --

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  -- just sort of going out of window and why don't they do anything to stop
it.  Well, it would cost a billion dollars --

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  -- to track all the fraud and mismanagement.  Well, guess what, I think
that's a really good return on investment, don't you.

A.53:  Oh, yeah.  

B.54:  A billion versus a hundred and eighty billion,
