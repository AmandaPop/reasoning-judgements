B.1:  [Talking] So, what do you think about mandatory public service?

@A.2:  Well, [sigh] uh, [noise] personally I think it's good.  

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  I think, uh, [talking] there's a lot of things that, that, uh, [lipsmack]
you can learn from [swallowing] helping other people and doing things that
need to be done.  And as I look around, I see most of the things that I enjoy,
like I just got back from vacation and the freeways were, were built by
somebody else, paid by somebody else and it wouldn't hurt to do some of that
myself.

B.5:  Right.  Were you ever in the military or public service of any kind?  

A.6:  [Sigh] I, I did a two and a half [sigh], uh, two and a half year
volunteer, uh, how shall I say it, uh, service in the Far East for my church.

B.7:  Oh, really.  

A.8:  Yeah.

B.9:  What denomination?

A.10:  Uh, Latter Day Saint church.

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  And, uh, so it was, it was, uh, it was a great, uh, thing and, and I know
some other people that who've, that have, uh, come back from that and joined
the Peace Corps and, you know, went on, uh, contributing.  And, and like I
say, in every case, uh, they benefited and I'm, they have lifelong happy
memories about, about, uh, [inhaling] the things that they did.  Now does that
mean that everybody is going to have happy memories?  Well, [lipsmack] I don't
know.  But in Europe, an-, in many states in Europe they do the same.  They,
they want everybody to, to, uh, not necessarily join the mil-, military, but
have [breathing] you know, mandatory, uh, [lipsmack] volunteer service of some
kind.

B.13:  Right.

A.14:  So, how about you?

B.15:  I think it's also a good idea.  People that I've, I was just thinking this
morning about how {pause} [clicking], are you there?

A.16:  Yes.

B.17:  Okay.  Hi.  Uh, I was just thinking this morning about how people tend to
get off into a, to one narrow track and one narrow focus and don't get
an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways
of doing things.  So, in particular, I was thinking about up in, lately
visiting around to a lot of different congregations.  And the preachers that
I've heard that have just grown up and stayed in one denomination are not
nearly as good and, uh, expansive as the ones that have come from a different
denomination to the one they're in now.  So, in terms of having life
experience and a better appreciation for other people and other points of
view, I think the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing.  A great idea.
The problem is that, as you say, not everybody will have a great experience.
#The ones that are wanting,#

A.18:  #[Laughter].#

B.19:  to do it tend to have great experiences.  Though some of our friends
that joined the Peace Corps have been really lonely.

A.20:  Yeah.  Well, well that's part of the [breathing], how shall I say it,
that's part of the experience I think.  Because not every, oh how shall I say
it.  Not every, uh, not every place we go has, has great weather.  I, uh, you
know, sometimes you come back and, and you say, um, that was an interesting
trip [laughter].  But, I guess what I'm saying is that, that overall the, the
benefits of, of, uh, volunteer service [lipsmack] uh, are just infectious.
They, they get, you remember the people you helped and it's not all money,
money, money, money.

B.21:  Right.

A.22:  And, uh, [inhaling] it's really useful to, to making you, well like I say,
feel like you contribute.  I know after I spent my time in the Far East I came
back and I said well, [lipsmack] of all the bad things I've done in my life
and of all the times I wimped out and haven't done anything, at least I've
done something --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- for that period of time [swallowing].  And, uh, you know, it's, uh, how
shall I say it, it's not a cure all but, uh.

B.25:  Right.

A.26:  The other thing that I've, that I, [sigh] like I say I feel is that there's
a, a lot of people out there that, that just have tons of time.  And, uh, they
don't know what they're going to do with their life.  And, and as you pointed
out, if they've get out and see if, uh, uh, life from a, from a different, uh,
perspective [inhaling] then, uh, [lipsmack] they have a better focus [baby].

B.27:  Uh-huh [/talking].

A.28:  And, let's see what else [breathing].  I, I think the only difficulty is
going to be, uh, [sigh] if it becomes, well, I think we'd have to learn a lot
from the European, uh, style.  Uh, because I know that in America there's
[sniffing], sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing
to the point that, that, uh, it might become [/talking] [/baby],
