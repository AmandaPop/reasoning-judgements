==========================================================================

A.1:  And so, uh, I, I guess it's, the subject is, uh, gun control.

@B.2:  [Static] Yeah, I, uh, probably would put myself on a, uh, five or six
scale.  Being up here in the, uh, northeast, uh, I'm considered liberal
[laughter].

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  But, uh, I believe in the right to own and, uh, have a gun for yourself if
that's what, if that's what you want as long as you don't have a record in the
past of, uh, committing crimes or, uh, something in that order.  I think that
it's important that there be some check, uh, background checks before they
just hand a gun over to any old person.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I sort of believe the same way.  I think I'm, I'm probably
considered more of a conservative but I still think that, uh, [sigh] with
regards to gun control, the, uh, like convicted felons, you know, they
shouldn't be able to have one.  Uh, also, I'm in, i-, if you look at it, uh,
like say a waiting period.  I'm in favor of a waiting period as just that, a
waiting period, before somebody buys a, a handgun.  Like you say a week or two
weeks as a cooling off period.  But I, I, I guess the, uh, N R A.  They kind
of look at it as a spring board towards more restrictive gun controls.  And so
I can kind of see both, both sides of, of the, of the, uh, issue #on that.#

B.6:  #Yeah, absolutely.# You know, th-, that's the one concern that, uh, I have
too is that, you know, once you go down the path --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and you start with first, it's, it's background checks.  And, and, uh,
then it's suddenly age restrictions and then it's totally illegal [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.10:  And, you know, I, I come from up here.  I'm not in New York City area by
any means.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  So I'm in a, Rochester is not heavy crime area.  But, uh, you know, and I,
and it's been a political issue up here.  A, a, a big deal about whether or
not they should, people should have access to handguns and, uh, some of these
Saturday night specials and plastic handguns and --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- all of these new things.  I think pretty much up here, everybody agrees
that [throat_clearing] there should be more control on semiautomatic slash
keeping automatic weapons banned.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Uh, just because, you know, what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do
with an A K Forty-seven #[laughter]?  I mean.#

A.17:  #Yeah.  That, that# is true.  Uh, 

B.18:  [Snorting].

A.19:  as a, as a toy, you know, I mean if you call a gun a toy.  They would be,
it would be interesting to have one, shoot one.  But, uh, but you're right.
There's no, no real legitimate need for one unless you consider, uh, like
personal defense.  Like if your home or something.  That's kind of extreme.
I, I don't personally own one but [sigh] uh, it's, it's really, it really is a
touchy issue.  I know, uh, the, uh, like you mentioned, the plastic handguns,
the Glock.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  It seems to me like, like that, that weapon they could, it seems to me like
they could bypass all the, I, I think the, uh, the major concern is, is that
they think that it can be slipped through airport security,

B.22:  [Noise].  

A.23:  Like it, it's impersonal to x-rays.  Seems to me, like technically, that
would be very simple to solve.  Just put some sort of a, a metal flake or
something that would show up on, on x-rays, you know.  To show the outline of
the gun.  And then you'd still have the advantages of the gun which is, I
believe, light weight.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  And, uh, #that would,# 

B.26:  #Yeah.# Up here, you know, we have a lot of hunters up here.  If you go
just to the south of, uh, Rochester, here.  You have a bunch of state parks
and there's a lot of hunting that goes on.  And, uh, that I think is, by far,
the majority of people that own guns around here --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- tend either be hunters or they live in the inner city and they're
concerned about, uh, uh, their safety.  Uh, we've had up here, the N R A -s
main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting.  Uh, the people who are
doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like New York City
where you have an N R A movement that's more, uh, attuned to personal
protection versus hunting, uh, that's pretty much how they've gone about it up
here.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And some of the tactics, I mean I noticed they changed their commercials.
Uh, used to be [laughter] they'd mention, and with every membership you get
fifty thousand dollars dismemberment insurance #[laughter].#

A.31:  #[Laughter] Yeah.#  Yeah, [noise] it's, uh, the #N R, [laughter]# --

B.32:  #[Laughter]# [throat_clearing].

A.33:  -- they're, uh, they're almost a little too radical in the other extreme.
I, I, I'm pretty strong in favor of, of personal gun ownership, but they, uh,
they might even get [laughter] a little carried away.

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  You know, with the lobbying and, and whatnot.  But,

B.36:  Well, it's a powerful lobby.  I mean, #I've# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- debated issues, uh, on some other issues (( )) the cable T V and that.
And, uh, the N R A lobby is the most powerful that's up there in Capitol Hill.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And, uh, they do a number [/static],
