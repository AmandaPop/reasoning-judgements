===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  I, uh, to let you know what I feel about drug testing.  Uh, I have
my qualms about [sigh] having the government, or anyone else for that matter, 
testing, randomly, everybody across the board --

@B.2:  Right.

A.3:  -- for various drugs.  However, I am not against testing those people who
are in critical, uh, jobs.  For example, airline pilots, subway drivers, #you
know# --

B.4:  #Right.#

A.5:  -- people who are responsible for other people's safety.

B.6:  For, uh, for, uh, uh. a larger number than just their own personal safety.

A.7:  [Throat_clearing] Correct.  #I# --

B.8:  #Yeah.#

A.9:  -- just think that it's, uh, unnecessary and really the medical testing
facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past
as far as reliability is concerned --

B.10:  Huh.

A.11:  -- and, uh, we have had situations here where people were accused of, uh,
uh, utilizing drugs and, uh, it turned out they were on some other medication
#which# --

B.12:  #Right.#

A.13:  -- was giving false positives.

B.14:  Right.  And the same goes with, uh, you can eat poppy bagels, poppy seeds?

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And they'll come up as a, as a positive for drugs as well.

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  Which is, I, you know, I'd, I'd just heard that, uh, just recently and I
thought that was interesting.  Uh,

A.19:  [Throat_clearing] Uh, do you, more or less, follow on the same lines  
as #I do or,#

B.20:  #Yeah,# I, I do.  I, uh, I have a little problem with somebody testing, uh,
for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy.  Uh, but I do agree with
you o-, regarding people that deal, uh, with groups of other people that their
lives should be, they should feel a little more safe and there should be more
of a safeguard, you know, air traffic controllers, airline pilots, uh, anybody
that deals,

A.21:  [Throat_clearing].

B.22:  with the public in a, uh, I don't know what, uh, a fashion, that their
lives are in their s-, in, in their hands.

A.23:  Yeah.  I, I know that they were, up here in New York, uh, uh, I've noticed
what they have been trying to do.  The governor here isn't thrilled with the
idea --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and we have, uh, various government officials here who basically don't
feel ((that)) is a good idea for, along the same lines.  But they're
continuously clashing with the federal government which, because of it's
antidrug war --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- uh, figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of anything
[laughter] internationally, let's make big headlines by going out and being
for mandatory drug testing and,

B.28:  Within the community.

A.29:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, and, and that way we'll, we'll nail those nine to
five worker users without really solving the problem,

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  of trying to really do something and through education and that.

B.32:  Yeah.  #That,# 

A.33:  #Yeah,# they, the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive
about this, uh, than, uh, anything else.  It's interesting that,

B.34:  [Noise].

A.35:  you find out with all these little scandals going on now, such as in the
house with the post office #cocaine# --

B.36:  #Right.#

A.37:  -- scandal.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  You know, all that.  Uh,

B.40:  Well, did you hear about the, uh, what was happening in the Boston area?  

A.41:  Uh,

B.42:  Uh, for, I guess for about the past five they've been testing babies for
AIDS.

A.43:  Oh, really.

B.44:  But not releasing the information.

A.45:  [Throat_clearing] #Yeah I,# 

B.46:  #They were# just testing to find out how prevalent it is.  Uh, in what
demographic and segments of the population.  But they weren't telling anybody,
if they did it, when, when the results came up positive or negative, they
weren't telling anybody.  

A.47:  Huh.  Well their, sure they were probably afraid of being sued [laughter].

B.48:  Well, I'm sure.

A.49:  #[Laughter].#

B.50:  #And also# bringing light to the fact that they weren't getting parental
permission for it.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  They were just doing this test.

A.53:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, it's one of these slippery slope issues where once
you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing, it's the same
thing with the lie detectors --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- and, uh, 

B.56:  [Throat_clearing].

A.57:  the physiological tes-, [throat_clearing] tests that go on.  Uh, really I
think, you know, we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away, uh,
courtesy of the federal government --

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know
every possible thing about their employees and, uh, at times it's hypocritical
as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things
certainly don't want them applied to themselves --

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  -- #so [laughter],#

B.62:  #Exactly.#  They want to, they want to be just above in that regard.  
Uh,

A.63:  Yeah.  I, I, I don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the
newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug
stuff.  Here in, in Rochester --

B.64:  No.

A.65:  -- in western New York, there hasn't been a terrible lot but we, of
course, hear about the subway drivers in New York City --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- who slammed into someone and, of course, you know, the airline pilots
are rumored, you know, there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism, now
cocaine usage.

B.68:  Uh.  Well, there's al-, there's a standard joke about the Northwestern
pilots [throat_clearing].

A.69:  Oh yeah.  Wasn't that that thing in Ch-, Minneapolis or something --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or
they had their ((light)),
