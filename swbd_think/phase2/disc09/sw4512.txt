============================================================================

A.1:  Joe, what do you think the election turnout is going to be this year?  Do
you think it's going to be typically?

@B.2:  [TV] Uh, this, this year.  Uh, I think it's interesting.  Uh, we, I mean
there's so many candidates still that, uh, we, well there's, uh, we have, uh,
[sniffing] uh, Clinton and, uh, uh, #Brown# --

A.3:  #Brown.#

B.4:  -- of course.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I don't know if you've heard much about
th-, this other guy.  The independent Perot.

A.5:  Oh, yes.  #He's from Dallas.#

B.6:  #That may be drawing# some, uh, Republican votes.

A.7:  Yes. 

B.8:  And, uh, so it doesn't seem like George Bush is completely [noise] locked
up the Republican, although I think, I don't, well I guess he #has but,#

A.9:  #Do,# do you think there's going to be enough excitement that we'll have
more people voting?

B.10:  [Noise] Uh, [inhaling] I don't know.  I think that's, I think that's hard
to say.  I know, uh, Clinton and Brown are both trying to go after what,
whatever the block vote.  Whatever that's supposed to be.  And, uh, I don't
know.  I, I think it will be interesting.  I know a lot of people have, you
know, are, are starting to f-, are, are more, you know, with the re-, uh,
recession and everything.  I think a lot more people are starting to, uh,
become more politically actively [sniffing].

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  I, I think there will be more (( )).  Why, what do you think?  

A.13:  Oh, I, I don't know.  I, I think in terms of, uh, the national elections,
the election later this year --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- since Perot is from Dallas.  And if he gets on the the, uh, ballot, I
think there wi-, that we will have a larger percentage of voter turnout #than
usual.#

B.16:  #Oh, (( )).#  Right, right.

A.17:  But, I, I think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country
that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  I, and I think it represents, uh, malaise due to, well my vote doesn't
count.  #It doesn't# --

B.20:  #Right.#

A.21:  -- matter anyway.

B.22:  Yeah, yeah. #I agree.#

A.23:  #It's,# it's really, I think it's more of a problem in the local elections.

B.24:  Yeah.  Uh, I, yeah I definitely agree with you there.  I mean, it's people,
I mean that, that don't care much about, uh, uh, like federal things or, you
know, things, you know, uh, like the deficit.  People who don't, who don't
really care about stuff like that, really don't have any clues to what's going
on.  Like right un-, right in their own towns or counties or state or
whatever.  So, yeah, I agree with you.  Yeah, I think people are even, you
know.

A.25:  I, it's, it's too bad.  I, #you# --

B.26:  #Yeah.#

A.27:  -- have more control over your local politicians.

B.28:  Yeah.  You, you'd think people would be more, I don't know.  Because
they're more in touch, uh, they're, you know, geogra-, I mean [noise], uh,
#geographically.#

A.29:  #Easier to get# a hold of [laughter].

B.30:  Huh?

A.31:  It's ea-, they're easier to get a hold of.  #It's not a# --

B.32:  #Exactly.#

A.33:  -- long distance call #for one thing [laughter].#

B.34:  #Sure.#  Yeah and I mean, most of them are even, you know, you'll see them,
you know, however many times a year.  They're actually in your city, you know,
in your neighborhood or whatever.  But, uh, yeah, I gu-, yeah it's interesting
how that works.  And people just, I don't know, they just.

A.35:  Do you vote?

B.36:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I do vote.  Uh,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  I know if, I, when I first registered, uh, I guess with the last election.
Uh, I was, uh, in my late teens, so I only really registered and voted for
the, uh, who was that?  That was Dukakis and, uh, yeah, Dukakis and Bush.  I
guess it was the last time.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  That was, I guess that was the first presidential election I voted in.
But, uh, [swallowing] at that time I was really a political.  I mean, you
know, that, i-, i-, like you say about, uh, local, uh, gov-, uh, local
politics, I was just, you know, not in, in touch at all [sniffing].

A.41:  Well, I, I think in your case, college students in general pr-, tend not to
pay that much attention to the local politics.  I think they've got enough
going on [laughter].

B.42:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's, that's #true.  Yeah.#

A.43:  #That's not a# part of your world.  

B.44:  No, no that's true.  Uh,

A.45:  Campus elections are more #important [laughter] I suppose.#

B.46:  #[Laughter] Campus.  Yeah# [laughter].  Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's
another, that's another thing too.

A.47:  But, there, there's voter apathy there isn't there?

B.48:  Yeah, well I'd say so.  Sure.  I, I know I've never voted in any of the
just, uh, and why I, I don't know.  I just don't see any, I know, uh, I don't
see any importance at all in my vote in the, you know, and that, and that 
even --

A.49:  (( )).

B.50:  -- that smaller, uh, uh, arena --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- of politics.  I don't even see, uh, you know, any kind of influence or
anything.  Or any, you know, uh, uh, but, uh, federally defi-, I, I think
everybody should be, you know, uh, should definitely be, uh, uh, aware of, uh,
you know, the presidential elections.  They should be, you know, uh.

A.53:  Participate a #little more.  But that# --

B.54:  #Yeah, yeah, they, they# should participate, uh, #you know.#

A.55:  -- #but# also think about this.  If they're dumb enough to not vote,

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  do we really want them to vote #[laughter]?#

B.58:  #Uh, yeah.#  I-, but, but I, I, I think it'll be interesting to see, you
know, uh, I think the people that vote are the people who, uh, [sigh], gees,
now that's hard to say.  It's hard to say who votes and, and why.  Uh.

A.59:  Some of us, I think, do it out of habit.  

B.60:  Yeah, I mean.

A.61:  [Laughter].  That's a good habit to have.

B.62:  Yeah.  Oh, it is, it is.  And, uh, [/TV],
