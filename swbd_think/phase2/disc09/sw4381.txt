==========================================================================

A.1:  (( )) Uh, let's see.  So, what's wrong with our public school system?  Well
[sigh], well, I think I've been talked into that, that one of the main
problems is nondirective education.  [inhaling] Where you teach kids to
basically have a good self-image and assume that if they think good about
themselves, they will, they will learn well.  For example, if you t-, deal
with, uh, math scores, uh, U S math scores are, um, I don't know, seventeenth
out of twenty-three industrialized nations.  We're really low.  I mean I'd be
really even surprised if they were that high.  These are, these are scores on
standardized tests and yet if you, uh, give American students the question, I
am good at math, they'll rank themselves much higher than will, for example,
Korean students who do much better at math.  And a, [lipsmack] a number of
educational theorists, uh, pre-, predominately conservative, or they're called
conservative because they think this I suppose, say that the problem is that
we've gotten away too much from teaching the kids the material and too much
into let them, let, letting them discover what they feel or what they want to
learn for themselves.  [inhaling] And that can be seen in, you know, in math
scores.  It can be seen in sex education where we've had twenty years of
generally available sex education in this country.  At the same time we have a
rising crisis of teenage pregnancy.  [inhaling] Uh, it can be seen in the fact
that students cheat a lot more, at least admit to cheating a lot more than
they used to.  They're not told what's right and what's wrong.  And they're
not taught what they needed to be taught.  The urge, they're, they're, they're
taught to discover their own values and their own interest and if you let a
kid do that, that's the way to get, uh, you know, to get no progress.  Or very
little progress.

B.2:  Are those, are, are, as you talk about that, it reminds me of, of one
problem that I think is probably, as far as my perception is, the most glaring
error.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  That is because I know a lot of school teachers.  #I know# --

A.5:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.6:  -- a lot of, par-, particularly girls who, in like in their, their
thirties, #who teach# --

A.7:  #Uh-huh.#

B.8:  -- school, twenties and thirties.  And I'm appalled that we have, that we
pay our teachers so little.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And we give them so much, so, such a small budget to work with.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And with, you know, with a virtually nonexistent budget they have to supply
decor-, you know, things, bulletin boards on the rooms.  Things for the kids
#to# --

A.13:  #Yeah.#

B.14:  -- practice on.  #Textbooks.#

A.15:  #Yeah.  That's true.#

B.16:  And so, so, so the p-, the teachers themselves get a pathetic salary and
they end up almost across the board, taking some of their own money, which
they don't have, and buying school supplies so that they can, they can teach
their kids.  #And# --

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  -- their dedication astounds me.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  #Right, well,#

B.20:  #And I,# I don't know, I don't know if we're getting a quality education --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- from p-, teachers who are underpaid but I'm sure, I'm sure that it, it's
like, uh, I work at A T and T, and now I, I, if I want to spend four hundred
dollars --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- uh, I don't even to, I don't have to ask anybody.  I just go do it.

A.25:  Huh.

B.26:  That's probably the teacher's entire budget for the year, if they're lucky.

A.27:  Well, I work at N C State University and I do the same thing.  I spend, I
spend my own money to buy things that the University, you know, doesn't
provide.  And I think, little things like, like transparency pens, their
transparency pens are pitiful.  I buy my own.  Uh, I pay my own way on trips
because they don't have any travel budget since nineteen ninety now.  Uh, I
mean some of it comes from grants but what doesn't come from grants, I pay,
pay for myself.  And in fact, my business deductions are thousands of dollars
a year more than the two percent [laughter], uh, limit.  So, so th-, th-, the
same is true here.  But, you know, I, I tal-, talked to one teacher about that
at a wedding reception once.  And I said, she said we need more pay.  I said,
yeah, but, but, but what you need even more than that is you need more
flexibility to do things the way you see that they should be done.  And she
said, yeah I agree with that entirely.  That the bureaucracy really hamstrings
teachers.  Uh, they, they, they, in many places, are just told what textbook
to teach from.  Whether or not they think it's a good one.  I mean the
decision can be made from a central authority in the state, to which is
subject to lots of political pressure.  The teachers don't get to choose
themselves what, what book to teach, uh, teach from.  They go, don't get to
choose what order to cover things in and they really cannot adapt things to
their teaching style in, in, into their kids.  Uh, that is a big problem and I
think the large part of that problem is due to the educational bureaucracy.
Here I go, you know, maligning some [laughter], some, uh, uh, (( )) much
maligned entity.  But I really think that that's a serious problem.  That,
that there's so many layers of administration to make sure that everything's
done right.  That everybody's rights are respected and so forth, that there's
no flexibility down at the, at the, at the bottom level.  And that's what the
teachers have to deal with.  And (( )), and by the way, that's another reason
that their pay is so low.  Because the administrators soak up so much of the
budget.

B.28:  Yeah.  I think so.  I, for example, they will have a, a million dollar
building --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- but no, no money for supplies.

A.31:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well I think that, that one way to solve the problem, I mean,
i-, i-, you know, if anything doesn't work right, introduce competition.  And
the, the voucher, a-, approach to, uh, to, to paying for,
