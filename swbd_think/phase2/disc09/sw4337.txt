A.1:  Well,

B.2:  So, uh, what do you think about, uh, uh, how trials in America are right
now with the jury of nine or twelve, do you think that's fair?

@A.3:  Well, uh, I believe a trial by twelve, uh, peers is fair.  I don't think
the need for a unanimous vote is fair,

B.4:  Um.

A.5:  Nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  Except that [sigh].  We're too, uh, diverse in cultures, I believe, to make
a complete agreement.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  So you think that, uh, majority, majority rule is good enough for,
uh, deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty.

A.9:  I do.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  I really do.  

B.12:  Uh, something that's kind of interesting is, uh, I lived in Europe for a
while and, uh, in Germany, they don't have trial by jury.  They have trial,
uh, by usually three judges.  [throat_clearing] And, uh, I've discussed with
people and it's, it's kind of interesting, uh, kind of an interesting concept.
It sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers, but then, uh, the
argument for it is that, uh, you know, people off the street really don't know
much about law and --

A.13:  I agree with that.  

B.14:  -- yeah, and, and then, uh, I guess the argument is that they're easily
influenced, you know, bye-bye tricks by lawyers, you know, who do s-, do more
psychology than trying to teach them what's right and wrong or the law they,
they use, uh, you know, techniques to sway their feelings, whereas
professional judges, uh, you know, know the ins and outs of the system better.

A.15:  I agree.  I think that's very true.  I'm, I'm concerned that when we, uh,
sentence a, uh, a criminal to, for a certain amount of years that we don't
really know what that means.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  You know, ten years may mean one year in reality.  

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  And I don't think that most people are aware of that.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  You know, I, I wouldn't, couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow
how long he'd actually be in jail.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  Could you?  

B.24:  No.  

A.25:  Me either.  

B.26:  ((I couldn't)).  

A.27:  And I think they kind of depend on that, these criminals.  

B.28:  Right, yeah, definitely.  I don't know, I think the, that the, uh,
alternative is something interesting to look into.  Uh, if, you know, instead
of, instead of juries just bye-bye, uh, uh, peers juries by professional
judges --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- uh, but, I guess, uh, that would take a major constitutional change here
[laughter].

A.31:  Definitely would, but I see where they would be experts.  

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  Uh,   

B.34:  Uh, I mean, I see also how they were, you know, when they made the
constitution, they were, uh, afraid of that kind of thing that, you know,
that, uh, if the government has all the power to decide who's guilty and who's
not, they wanted to make checks and balances against that.

A.35:  Right, it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack.  What if
one of them is corrupt.

B.36:  Right, exactly.  

A.37:  And his, uh, the decision, the, the main decision maker.  

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  You know, the, the, they're split either way.  

B.40:  Yeah it's, uh, does carry an implicit danger with it that way.

A.41:  It does, but, that kind of goes like our Supreme Court [laughter] in a way.

B.42:  Right.  That's true, too, you know.  How does -- 

A.43:  And who gets -- 

B.44:  -- how does that work.  

A.45:  -- to point those people.  The politicians [laughter].  

B.46:  Right [laughter].  

A.47:  So they get to make the decision -- 

B.48:  Exactly.  

A.49:  -- not the people.  

B.50:  I think it was, I think it was more of a danger, you know, in the seventeen
hundreds when, uh, really, you know, like the King of England could decide
who's guilty and who's not guilty.  I could see how they would want to protect
against that.  So, I think the danger is less today --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- be less of a risk of, you know, uh, corrupt judges and the government
forcing, uh, you know, someone to, to be guilty for, uh, even though they're
not or vice versa, you know.  Uh, but it's definitely something that would
have to be watched very closely [laughter] if they decided to do it way.

A.53:  That's true.  I think a good start would be maybe some, uh, simple basic
education into how the process really works --

B.54:  Exactly.  

A.55:  -- for, uh, children.  

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  On, up, I mean, I, I know that we all learn, but I really don't feel that
the children are learning it nowadays.

B.58:  Right.  

A.59:  I think it's a big game and, you know,

B.60:  Right, and, and, uh, you know, what, what does jury duty mean.  Not, not
many people really, uh,

A.61:  Are, are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay?

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  Or a week's pay?  Is your boss willing to let you [laughter]? 

B.64:  Right, that, that's a really interesting issue, too.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  And, uh, you know, most people, the, another interesting thing is, you
know, most people try and get out of jury duty, right?

A.67:  Oh, definitely.   

B.68:  So the people that actually become juries are not really just a random
sampling of the p-,
