REMARKS:        There is a child on B and what sounds like dishes.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, do you have a couple of children?

B.2:  I have one.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  She's twenty months old.

A.5:  Oh, boy [laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter] How #many do you have?#

A.7:  #At least you're# sleeping.

B.8:  [Laughter] How many do you have?

A.9:  I have, uh, two boys.  One is eleven and one is fourteen.

B.10:  Oh.  

A.11:  I imagine the activities we, uh, encounter with our kids are quite
different at #this point.#

B.12:  #They probably are# [laughter].  But maybe you can give me some insight
and I can remind you of the [laughter] old times, huh.

A.13:  Oh, I remember them fondly.  It seems like th-, the, b-, like young
children, uh, destroy your sleep and older children destroy your life
#[laughter].#

B.14:  #[Laughter]# #Yeah.#

A.15:  #And I don't# really mean that.  #It,# 

B.16:  #Well,# I've heard that it only gets worse.  My husband and I sit around
thinking gosh, you know, what are we going to do when she starts going out and
having friends --

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  -- and going to school and getting exposed to all the other things out
there [laughter].

A.19:  I think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  And you really have to wing it,

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  and as you go.

B.24:  #Yeah.#

A.25:  #But# I, I remember, fondly, having the small ones.  They, they seemed real
happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just
seems that everything is more serious --

B.26:  It's more complicated.

A.27:  -- it's more complicated, it's emotional.  It's not a matter of giving
them a lollipop anymore,

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  and it just gets harder.

B.30:  Yes [child].

A.31:  But, uh, what we've done and you might want to do as, you know, as time
flies by is, I'm remarried and --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- my husband never had any kids so we were trying to figure out how, um,
how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what
we call the family meeting.

B.34:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.35:  And, once a week, we get together and this is a chance when the kids can
say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- and we have sort of an agenda that is like good news this week, bad
news this week, uh --

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  -- suggestions, any new business, 

B.40:  [Noise].

A.41:  any, uh, any qu-, questions, any anything, [laughter] you know.  #We,# 

B.42:  #How# [noise] long does that last?  How long does your meeting last?

A.43:  Well it changes.  It could be a quiet week, it could be the kind of thing
where kids want to go do something else [laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  So it goes pretty quick.  At the end is allowance so they have to make it
through (( )) #[laughter] to collect.# 

B.46:  #[Noise] [laughter].#  That sounds like a good th-, a good way to do it.

A.47:  Well, you know, we, we actually sit and talk to each other once a week, at
least [laughter], you know.  Not that we don't all the time.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  But it, it works out nicely and I don't know, you know, I think,

B.50:  [Child].

A.51:  I'd do that even if I wasn't remarried if I had thought about it.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  And, you know, we also plan a family activity because people are coming
and going and it's hard to be all together to do something --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- #so,# 

B.56:  #What# kind of things do you do on the family activities?

A.57:  Well it could be a game of Scrabble an-, or it could be, you know, reading
a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table, you
know, one sentence to each person.

B.58:  Uh-huh [/child]. 

A.59:  And, uh, it's, it's not something that's impossible.  I mean the kids will
usually want to go to a game park or something, you know?

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  We can't do that, you know [laughter]. 

B.62:  #Right.#

A.63:  #We# try to keep it real.

B.64:  It's getting quite expensive to do that these days.

A.65:  Oh, please [laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  Yeah, that, another thing that comes up with us is family vacation.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  We just kind of knock our heads.  We don't know how to make that right.
It seems as if we do what they want, uh, we (( )) a trip in California.  We
stayed with some relatives for awhile and then we went to Sea World and
Disneyland and we, we went to every kid thing.

B.70:  Did you drive there?

A.71:  Uh, no, we, we flew to California and we stayed free at my aunt's house so
that gave us a base in #San Diego# --

B.72:  #Yeah,# yeah.

A.73:  -- and we saw Sea World and the zoo and this and that and our lives were
sort of normal because, you know, it was someone else's house so we made sure
we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing.  Then we drove a bit
further and when we were on our own, it just kind of fell apart because,

B.74:  [Noise].

A.75:  we'd stay late at the parks and I didn't enjoy it after awhile.  You know,
once is you know, it's interesting but it's really not my cup of tea and,

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  family vacations are kind of difficult.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  You know, sharing a room with the kids is not much of a vacation
#[laughter],# 

B.80:  #[Laughter].#

A.81:  once they're old enough to know the difference.

B.82:  True, true.

A.83:  So,

B.84:  Yeah, my [whistling] husband wants to go on a family vacation.  We're on
the east coast like you and he wants to go out to, uh, the Grand Canyon and do
that sort of thing when Helen gets a little older, but it's hard to tell.
I've, at twenty months old he's, he wants to take her to the zoo and that sort
of thing but I'm not sure if she's ready for any of that.  If she's, you know,
if it could hold her interest. #So# --

A.85:  #Huh.#

B.86:  -- we don't really have anything, any kind of family activities to do.  We
basically just sit around the house and [child] she runs from one to the other
and we read to her.  That's something she enjoys.

A.87:  ((Well I guess)), the playgrounds used to be hot when the kids were
[laughter] little.

B.88:  Yeah, there's not many of them out there though like was when I was young.

A.89:  Huh.

B.90:  I mean there was a playground just about in every neighborhood but I don't
even know where one is around here anymore.

A.91:  There might be some at the schools.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  You know, that you can use when it's an off time, you know, on a weekend
or #something.# 

B.94:  #Yeah,# that's a good idea.

A.95:  And a lot of, if you have a Y M C A or something.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  They have kind of a tot programs where they have little exercise
class for kids her age #and# --

B.98:  #Yeah.#

A.99:  -- all kinds of things.

B.100:  Um.  #Probably,# --

A.101:  #((What help))#  Yeah, go ahead.

B.102:  -- probably be very hard to be the instructor [laughter].  #Twenty months
old [laughter].#

A.103:  #Huh.  Yeah, but that's not# your problem, that's the fun of it you,
