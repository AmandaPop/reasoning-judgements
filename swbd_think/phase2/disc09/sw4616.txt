============================================================================

A.1:  Well Dave, what is your favorite magazine?

@B.2:  Right now, I think my favorite ones are PARENTING and CAR AND DRIVER.

A.3:  [Laughter] PARENTING and CAR AND DRIVER.

B.4:  Right.  I'm a grandfather so --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- basically, I'm getting interested in raising kids again and --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- I like all the articles that, uh, you know, the letters to the editor
and like the coupons that are in most of the magazines I get.

A.9:  Oh.  I see {very faint}.

B.10:  And, of course, CAR AND DRIVER.  I've got t-, two teenage boys that are in
the market for a car.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  So I've been trying to teach them how to read for what's a good deal and
what's to, to get as far as insurance costs etcetera.

A.13:  Yeah.  Do they, uh, have they looked at the CONSUMER REPORTS articles on
cars?

B.14:  Yes they have.  Uh, they compare them, I use the CAR AND DRIVER.  I knew
they mention other magazines and CONSUMER REPORTS is in our library so, I
don't subscribe to it because of the cost.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Try to keep most of my magazines down.

A.17:  Yeah.  Well I think it's the April issue.  I do get that one.  And the
April issue always compares all the new cars.  And, uh, that's, it's
invaluable when, if you're shopping for a new car.  Even if you're looking for
an old one because it tells you history of repairs and that sort of things on
different models.  So, I think it is a worthwhile magazine.  Uh, I get
NEWSWEEK here but I never have time to read it #[laughter].#

B.18:  #[Laughter]# The problem I have with NEWSWEEK and TIME is I never had any
time to read them but that's the reason I get magazines because it's mostly
current so.  If I really want to be kept up current I usually get a newspaper
instead of those weekly magazines.

A.19:  Yeah, yeah.  #The,# 

B.20:  #But# the CONSUMER REPORT's, the magazine's the best way to go because the
book comes out like once a year wh-, but the repair records are good to
compare it --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- because I think right now with our budget range, we're comparing like
Hyundais and --

A.23:  Uh-huh [swallowing].

B.24:  -- older model Datsuns and Toyotas and Fords. 

A.25:  Yeah [swallowing], yeah.  That, uh, that, i-, that year end book that
CONSUMER REPORTS put out is sometimes a little condensed too.  You may not get
the full article in those.  Not, not always the case but sometimes
[swallowing].  #Another# --

B.26:  #So what,# 

A.27:  -- magazine I enjoy but I, I'm way behind on them are the SMITHSONIAN.

B.28:  Yeah, I just started getting those.  I guess somebody put my name in the
hat or something because I got my first one this month and said if you would
like to continue, please fill out this card.  And I haven't even had a chance
to look through it yet, I just got it today.

A.29:  The photography is so good and the, and the articles are fascinating.
There's always something [laughter] in that magazine.  It's, uh,

B.30:  So that's your favorite one?

A.31:  Well, probably.  I get MONEY and that's another one I don't have time to
read.  And, and rather sti-, strange one I suppose, I get FINE HOME BUILDING
[noise] which is another one that has nice pictures in it, you know.  If I
ever build the ultimate dream home [laughter] or something, I'll know how to
do it [laughter].

B.32:  So you're a home builder (( ))?

A.33:  No, [laughter] not really.

B.34:  Do you rent a home?

A.35:  No I own one.

B.36:  You own your home?

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Okay.  But you don't [laughter] do any repairs on it?

A.39:  Not too many, no.

B.40:  Okay.  We rent but we still get to, you know, do repairs and do
improvements and take some of that off the rent.

A.41:  Well HOME MAGAZINE is pretty good too.  It, it helps you out with minor
repairs and, of course, the usual POPULAR SCIENCE and POPULAR ELECTRONICS.
They often have, uh, articles that help you repair things.  But I have to
confess, I've never read CAR AND DRIVER or PARENTING, as a matter of fact
[laughter].

B.42:  ((You)) run the gambit of trying different ones.  Every year I get those
American Family Publisher,

A.43:  [Noise].

B.44:  advertisements and that's when I make a comparison --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- based on prices and stuff.  And then, of course, for home repair,
anything like that, I wouldn't do that many projects anyway, so if I did plan
on building a door or fixing something, I'd go to the library and start
preparing for it before I did that.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  And, of course, on the, the van-, magazines have no advantage on some of
the home builder centers because they have pamphlets already made up and you
can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at
the pamphlet where with the magazine, any questions you have, you write to the
editor and you,

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  have to wait for the answer.

A.51:  Yeah, [noise] something could really have fallen apart by then #couldn't
it?#

B.52:  #Yeah.#

A.53:  Yeah.  Well, I, I, I think, in general, I'm like you.  I tend to get my
current events out of the newspaper or worse yet, on the ten o'clock news on T
V.  But, uh, I, I enjoy magazines.  I'm like you, the coupons in them.  I
generally read a magazine with a pair of scissors nearby.  Of course, that
doesn't work too well with SMITHSONIAN [laughter].

B.54:  No.    

A.55:  They don't do much in the way of coupons.

B.56:  Well READER'S DIGEST used to be good on coupons and all of a sudden they
just kind of cut back on it #and for the# --

A.57:  #Oh, is# that right?

B.58:  -- price anymore, I don't think they're worth it.  

A.59:  Yeah [noise].  I, I don't subscribe to that.

B.60:  Yeah, I stopped doing that a long time ago.

A.61:  Yeah I,

B.62:  Oh and I confess.  I've got one other magazine --

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  -- T V GUIDE.

A.65:  T V GUIDE.  #Alri-,#

B.66:  #Every# week, I've got to have my T V GUIDE.

A.67:  [Laughter].  

B.68:  (( )) just doesn't do it justify when I read.  

A.69:  #Yeah.#

B.70:  #My favorite# section in that is Cheers and Jeers.

A.71:  Oh.  Uh, I haven't, I haven't gotten T V GUIDE in years.  I used to
subscribe to it, many years ago, like twenty years ago or so.

B.72:  They're pretty good.  I sold them as a kid for fifteen cents each.  Got
four cents each more than I sold.

A.73:  Oh [laughter].

B.74:  Now they're up to eighty-nine cents each which isn't too bad if you have
them delivered to the home.

A.75:  Uh-huh.
