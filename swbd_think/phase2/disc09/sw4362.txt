A.1:  [Clicking].

B.2:  [Music] [TV] Uh, well, h-, having ((sort of the reason we're)) going
through the school system I seem to be younger than most people who, who talk
on this thing.  I'm, I'm just graduating col-, graduating from college.  Uh, I
didn't really perceive much of a, of a problem with the school system.
However, when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and
ad-, you can compare just about everyth-, thing to Japan and we look like wh-,
we don't have anything.  Uh, it seems to be not difficult enough for students.
Not challenging enough.  And just not generally competitive enough.  Uh,
however, I, if it weren't for our needless, uh, [sigh] competition with Japan,
I, I'd, I'd think that, that, the school systems, system works at a pretty
good pace.

@A.3:  I don't know.  Uh, I haven't, it's been, uh, well seventy-nine since I was
at school.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  At high school.  And, uh, I've seen things change.  I don't know if I've
seen things change enough that I can actually, because I wasn't really like
listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare.  You know what
I #mean?#

B.6:  #Right.#

A.7:  But, uh, it seems like when I li-, I lived in Chicago, I, I've lived down
here.  I hear the dropout rates from the schools,

B.8:  [Rustling].

A.9:  and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth.

B.12:  Huh.

A.13:  I mean, I, I've seen so many different things.  So, so many different bad
reports coming out of the school system and I recognize that there are good
schools out there.  I mean, #somebody's# --

B.14:  #Right.#

A.15:  -- getting, getting a good education because we,

B.16:  [Clicking].

A.17:  continue to employ people.  But, uh, [swallowing] I don't, I don't
understand the, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools don-,
seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities.

B.18:  Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either.  Uh, but I'm not quite
sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools.  But
then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put.  Uh, because
the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where
also there's poverty and, and crime.  And they all seem to go together.  And
it seems like if you could eliminate one [sniffing] of, of the parts of that
circle, whether, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know,
general poverty kind of conditions, [sniffing] that things ought to get
better.  So, uh, a-, the other two a-, a-, they're all three social issues and
could be addressed by the government in any ways [sniffing].  And clearly, to
me, is a kind of government thing to, to fix but it's just like, I, I don't
expect them to know which, which, which part is best to fix just like I don't
know.  It's, it's a complicated issue.  I, I still don't think I would blame
it directly on the school.

A.19:  I don't know if I blame it on the school.  I think, I think I blame it, I
think I blame it on a couple of different things.  I think I blame it on the
school system.  #Uh,#

B.20:  #Well,# that's I meant when I said the school.

A.21:  Yeah.  I don't blame it on the teachers in the school.  I, although I think
that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally
get paid an awful lot more than, well, [throat_clearing] they do quite well
for themselves #[laughter].#

B.22:  #Huh.  Well,# that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school
district, uh, were well paid.

A.23:  No.  Not all school districts are well paid.  But there are some school
districts out there that are very well paid.  I mean I know one family that's
got, they're both teachers, and they both have,

B.24:  [Rustling].

A.25:  like second jobs --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- that they work in the afternoons.  They both work all summer full-time.
And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.

B.28:  Yeah.  Well, #it, it,# 

A.29:  #I mean that# family is making over a hundred grand.  And I'm, I mean,
okay, okay.  Yes, I agree that teaching our kids is important.

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven to
three,

B.32:  [Noise].

A.33:  and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks
in between and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that.  And I don't
even have kids #[laughter].#

B.34:  #Yeah, [laughter]# well that's true.  But tha-, there's, you can always
play games with, uh, talking about, whoa, look at this.  My tax dollars are
paying for this.  This is wrong.  But, when you're talk-, w-, w-, and there's
really not much you can directly do about that.  I think that, that if, if
there is a problem with the school system, uh, from, it's been my perception
that the school teachers and school officials are not that well, uh, paid.
That perhaps that might be one area that, that could be improved.  Uh, w-, you
have other professional jobs and th-, this is a profession.  And, as a matter
of fact, it's a pretty big influence on, on [/music] [/TV],
