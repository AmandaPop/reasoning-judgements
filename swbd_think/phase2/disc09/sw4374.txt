===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  [TV] Okay.  What do you do?

B.3:  We use a monthly budget.  Uh, my husband and I.  My husband works. I don't.
And, uh, he brings home the paycheck [laughter] [children] --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  -- and we have a budget [door] or a balance sheet is what we call it.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  We have different columns for different areas of our budget and we budget
out a certain amount for each month or each pay period.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  [Swallowing] And then we try not to go over that [laughter].

A.10:  Right.  

B.11:  And so, anyway [lipsmack].  What do you #do?#  

A.12:  #Well,# when, when I was married, my husband budgeted, you know, very, very
tightly.

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  But then every time there was any, uh, and he made sure of it, there was
any extra money for anything, he spent it.

B.15:  Oh [laughter]!

A.16:  Right.  So, you know, that, that type of budget I didn't func-, you know, I
didn't, uh, I feel like I was getting the short end of the stick.

B.17:  Right.

A.18:  You know.  

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  So, uh, but I'm, I'm divorced now so I don't even have a bank account.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  I have a, my, the company that I'm working for has a credit union.

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  And I put in the credit union every week, #a# --

B.25:  #Uh-huh.#

A.26:  -- substantial amount of my check.

B.27:  Right.

A.28:  And then when I have some extra monthly, uh, or quarterly bills like
insurances and taxes and things like that --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- then I draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses.  

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  And, uh, I, you know, I'm still very, uh, very tight with my money.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  Course, I make very little also.

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  But I couldn't, I just couldn't stand the pressure of having a checking
account and being concerned about having a check that wasn't covered.

B.37:  Right.

A.38:  Because they're really expensive down here on a, and if you, if you
misfigure your check you, on a ten or twenty dollar check, any, any size 
check --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- could cost you easy fifty dollars #to get it# --

B.41:  #Oh, my God.#

A.42:  -- straightened out.

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  So, and my, my budget doesn't ha-, stand for that.

B.45:  Right [laughter].

A.46:  So, uh, but I've, I save, uh, uh, I haven't, the last two years I have
saved in an I R A every year.  Saved enough money to, to buy an I R, you know,
to pay for a two thousand dollar I R A every year.

B.47:  Right.

A.48:  And, uh, I'm in the credit union, uh, not the credit union, the company --

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  -- uh, savings and investment plan.

B.51:  Now that's a good idea.

A.52:  And I save six percent there.

B.53:  #Uh-huh.#

A.54:  #I actually# save nine percent there.  They add three percent to it.

B.55:  Uh-huh.

A.56:  So, uh, I'm, you know, I'm, uh,

B.57:  You're set.

A.58:  Well, I'm, #I'm saving.#

B.59:  #[Laughter]#  #Yeah.#

A.60:  #You know.# I, even though I make very little money and, and, uh, you know,
and may, i-, i-, it's me and my daughter.

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  [Swallowing] And, uh, so, uh, you know, I'm doing better [laughter] that,
better, I came out of, of a job that paid very well like for down here, I made
twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  And my ex made, uh, under forty.

B.65:  Huh.

A.66:  And now the first year I was out on my own, I made four, I made twelve
thousand.

B.67:  Wow.

A.68:  Yes.  It was tough.

B.69:  Yes.

A.70:  And last year I got a promotion and a raise and, and a better, a dif-,
different, a better job.  And I made seventeen.

B.71:  Wow.

A.72:  So, uh, I'm doing better.  But I'm still saving more money now than I did
when I was married.

B.73:  Yeah.  Well I think that one thing that people don't do a lot of these
days.  A lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and don't have
enough to put away.

A.74:  They do here.  They, you know, a lot of people, I mean they are, and every
time they have like a car break down --

B.75:  Uh-huh.

A.76:  -- or their taxes come due --

B.77:  Uh-huh.

A.78:  -- or all kinds of stuff, they would, our credit, the credit union at the
company that I work for was, was more like a loan shark.

B.79:  Right.

A.80:  It was awful.  #They we-,# --

B.81:  #Uh-huh.#

A.82:  -- they didn't have to follow, uh, regulations of any kind.

B.83:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.84:  And so the people [lipsmack] would, would, every time they had trouble,
they didn't have to manage their money.  They would just have to go sign their
life away and, and get money from the credit union.

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  And they just, they ended up, a lot of them ended up owing more at the
credit union than they could, then they could ever pay.

B.87:  Right.

A.88:  And they wouldn't get very much of a paycheck at all.

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  Because of the credit union taking so much out.  #And, and# --

B.91:  #Uh-huh.#

A.92:  -- they did, they weren't willing to manage their, their checks.

B.93:  #[Laughter].#

A.94:  #You know.  And, uh, but I,# it was pitiful.  #I mean# --

B.95:  #Yes.#

A.96:  -- you think, good grief, you all, what is your, you know, why.

B.97:  Uh-huh.

A.98:  But, uh,

B.99:  Well, I wasn't brought up this way.  To budget.  That's for sure.  My
husband was and, and it was really an adjustment period for me --

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  -- to learn how [laughter].  #But I could# --  

A.102:  #Well, if you,# 

B.103:  -- see the wisdom in it [/children].

A.104:  Exactly.  You know, if you are not willing to budget your money, then, uh,
you know, if you're not willing to be careful and live on what you make
