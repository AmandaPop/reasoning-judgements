==========================================================================

A.1:  Yeah, go ahead.

B.2:  Okay.  Well, uh, I've, I didn't really ever have to have a budget, uh,
until I quit going to Georgia Tech and, uh, then I learned to budget really
fast #[laughter].#

@A.3:  #[Laughter].#

B.4:  Uh, I had been working part-time before that and, uh, my parents were
helping me some.  But, uh, I got to where, I mean, I knew where every penny
was going.  But then as I started making more money, uh, my budget's kind of,
hasn't, doesn't exist except for at certain times, [laughter] you know.

A.5:  Right, you make more money but it goes away anyway [sniffing].

B.6:  Right.  Well, I don't have to worry, I mean, I don't have to think ahead
as much like, you know, but I haven't really saved anything.  I'm still trying
to, uh, I've, I have school debts I'm still paying back and stuff.

A.7:  Yeah.  I have three children an-, and a house so, uh, #it's a# --

B.8:  #Oh, okay.  So# you have to budget.

A.9:  -- it's a serious matter.  But, uh, my wife's just starting to go back to
work, maybe that will take the pressure off.  But I must [throat_clearing], I
must confess the only control I have over our budget is to try and make as
many things as constant as possible --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- like tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few
surprises as possible.

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  But I don-, I've started keeping a budget on computer, I guess each of the
last five years and never followed through.

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  And about this time of the year is when I get religion.  I have to do my
income taxes, I realize that better recording keeping would have helped and,
uh --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- I still haven't managed to, uh, uh, do it the way I should.

B.18:  Yeah.  But even, even if you do break your budget I think when you write
things down or however, if, if you do it on the computer, whatever, something
where you can just constantly see exactly what, where your money is going --

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  -- then, you, it, it's easier, even if you don't stick to it, I think
it's, you know, it's better to have, you, a little bit more conservative (( )).

A.21:  Right.  I believe, if I had to, that I could [throat_clearing] estimate
all the major for-, all the major sources of spending, uh, on a monthly basis
and come pretty close.  But I'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in
there that, uh, I would find and maybe learn how to control if I, uh, kept a
formal budget or, uh, financial plan.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  [Throat_clearing] #((But)),#

B.24:  #But,# even i-, you can't, I don't think, have enough, a really, when,
before when I had a strict budget it's because I had too.  I knew exactly
[laughter] where every penney was going before I had it.  But, it's, it's a 
little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- but also, it, I think it's bad to have like, you know, say you have
these debts and you, you know, you're paying a lot of interest on one and you
want to go ahead and get it, you know, paid off sometimes [swallowing].  I've
looked at it that way and really just, you know, pinched myself in other
places so that I could do that, you know, #uh, pay it off and,# 

A.27:  #Yeah, the only# problem is that, if, if you have children
[throat_clearing], what you are going to need for them a few years from now is
what you need to be putting aside now and that's, #uh# --

B.28:  #Right.#

A.29:  -- you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow.

B.30:  And that's hard to see.  But if you, if you try to be too strict on
yourself then your, then you just end up getting really frustrated #don't# --

A.31:  #Right.#

B.32:  -- ever, you know, just, just blow a little bit #that's, you know.#

A.33:  #Right.#  But you'll find that the [throat_clearing] kids don't really
have a very good sense of where the money is going so they'll ask for things
pretty much constantly [laughter].

B.34:  Right.  I remember doing that as a child #[laughter].#    

A.35:  #And I, I learned# to say no pretty much constantly [laughter].

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  And, uh, uh, so I would be better if I had a budget and I had a certain
amount of, uh, fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed
to be spent each month, I'd feel better about it.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  So, who knows, maybe this will get me to do it [laughter] [sniffing].  

B.40:  #Yeah {very faint}.#

A.41:  #You# don't have children?

B.42:  No, I sure don't.

A.43:  Well, that's a big change in life in a lot of ways, but budgeting is one
of them.

B.44:  Oh, I know.  I mean, I've, I've had, I have a cat and #[laughter],# 

A.45:  #[Laughter].#

B.46:  that's, you know [laughter].

A.47:  Well, that's one solution [laughter].

B.48:  That's hard enough.  I mean, I know, but, I mean, you know,

A.49:  [Throat_clearing].

B.50:  tha-, that's a lot [laughter] some sort {mispronounced} of,

A.51:  [Noise].

B.52:  when, some, there's times when I, if I couldn't afford to buy myself
groceries, I would buy for her first.

A.53:  #[Laughter].#

B.54:  #You know,# just because yo-, I mean, you feel a lot worse because this
being is completely dependent on you, you know.

A.55:  That's an interesting spirit but, and I suppose cats are like children,
they don't take no for an answer [laughter] #as easily.#

B.56:  #[Laughter]# Well tha-, [throat_clearing] uh, yeah, they are a lot simpler
but [laughter],

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  But I, I'm just saying, you know, I, it, it would, it would be hard to know
that someone else's life is completely dependent on you, you know.

A.59:  Yeah.  The hard part though is not, uh, i-, the hard part is, uh, uh,
setting aside for what they're going to need in five or ten years [sniffing].

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  That's, uh, really difficult.

B.62:  It's hard to see that --

A.63:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

B.64:  -- right now.  Even though you know you have too.  

A.65:  Right.  Well, I've made my confession.

B.66:  [Laughter]  Yeah, I, I'm glad we had this conversation because it makes
me think,
