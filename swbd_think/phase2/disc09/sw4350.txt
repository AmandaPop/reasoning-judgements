==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I think that there's, uh, a few things that I would like to see, uh,
in the work environment that could improve things and number one is, uh,
health benefits, things like, uh, insurance for number one.  Another would be
like, uh, [smack] facilities or an ease, some easy way to go out and exercise
or something like that,

B.2:  [Inhaling].

A.3:  if you felt like it #in the middle of the day.#

B.4:  #I, I# definitely agree on that.  Uh, I'm, I'm working for a law firm right
now.  The benefits are not bad.  The only thing I think that they're
desperately missing is, we have no dental plan whatsoever [laughter].

A.5:  Uh, yeah.  Same here.

B.6:  Uh, [laughter] but, as far as what I would really like to see is I live
close enough to the city that I would be able to bicycle in if I could.

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  If there was some sort of pro-, provided facility for that.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Uh, maybe a locker area, a shower area #to# --

A.11:  #Yeah.#

B.12:  -- chan-, to take a shower before work and some place to lock the bicycles
up.  And I have heard of a lot of other companies providing that.  Now it's
something to look forward to.  Uh, [smack] let's see [breathing].

A.13:  Another one I would like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours.

B.14:  [Laughter] Well a lot depends on the job though [laughter].

A.15:  Yeah [noise].

B.16:  What do you do?

A.17:  Well, right now I'm still in school.

B.18:  Oh, okay.

A.19:  I'm a student, but the ability to, uh, you know kind of have a little bit
of freedom over that, to schedule your work from day to day, from week to
week, so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without
having to use a day vacation or [inhaling] just something like that.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  Feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while
or something like that.

B.22:  Yeah, that would be nice.  I suppose that does ((depend)) on the type of
job, type of environment you're in.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  Uh, [smack] I'm right now also a full time student and, uh, but I work in
the evenings for a law firm.

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  So, it's rather --

A.27:  Um.

B.28:  -- yeah it's a rather interesting [static] uh, [smack] rather interesting
set up.

A.29:  #Yeah, that can be rough.#

B.30:  #Work full time,# go to school full time.

A.31:  Yeah, I did that for about a year and had my fill of that.

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  [Smack]  #Swore to# --

B.34:  #But,#  

A.35:  -- never do it again.  I think another thing, uh, would be nice.  I guess
this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be
consideration of, uh, [smack] like the family in some in somebody's, in the
way that somebody relates to the work place.

B.36:  How come?

A.37:  Uh, well an example would be in the military they get a whole lot of
allowances for family.  They even get paid more.  They get, uh, allowances for,
uh, you know, hav-, being married or having children.  I don't really thing
that that is fair.  I think equal work, equal pay for equal work ought to be
applied in that case #but, uh# --

B.38:  #Well they do# --

A.39:  -- they get housing and stuff like that [noise].

B.40:  -- yeah.  Yeah, I have friends that are in the military and they do get
quite a lot of perks.

A.41:  ((Yeah)), and other considerations as well.  You know, their, the duty is a
little bit different and stuff like that.

B.42:  [Inhaling] Right.  Right.

A.43:  But, they, you know, recently there was some kind of documentary on some
station.  I don't know what.  And some guy was on there.  He was a middle
level manager.  He was talking about how, here he'd spent all these years
putting in fifty hour weeks, uh, you know, [noise] for these various places
he's worked at, now [noise] here he's totally unemployed.  He'd been
unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing.  Some kind of
consideration there would be nice as well.  I don't know what [noise] would be
the solution.  I suppose uh not foolishly giving extra ten hours a week to
some place.

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  If they're just going to ((pork)) you in the end.

B.46:  Uh, what a lot, what a lot of companies do is fa-, as far as their health
benefits are concerned, the insurance provides, uh, coverage for the spouse and
or family in a lot of cases.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  I know that's the case in my office at least.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  They will provide minimum benefits for your spouse and depend-, codependent
children.  Not like the case applies to me but [inhaling], uh, [smack] it is
nice that they offer it.

A.51:  Yeah, it's a good consideration for families.  That's an absolute necessity
in today's world.

B.52:  Definitely.  #And health# --

A.53:  #And price# --

B.54:  -- insurance costs,

A.55:  -- man, they're getting so expensive.  Right now, I don't have any health
insurance.  It's kind of disturbing. ((If you)),

B.56:  You, you're not still covered under your parents?

A.57:  No, I'm going to be thirty this year.  ((But)) [laughter],

B.58:  [Laughter] Oh, wow.  When you said you were going to school full time
[laughter].

A.59:  Yeah, I'm working on my P H D.

B.60:  Oh, well that's different.

A.61:  It's a long road.  [inhaling] But, the insurance they have at school is
kind of, uh, uh, they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot.  If you lose a leg
or something like that,

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  you just need the skin folded over, you know.

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  You know, just something to keep you alive #until# --

B.68:  #Right.#

A.69:  -- you graduate and make some money and I suppose can go out and get it
fixed then.

B.70:  What school does,

A.71:  Georgia Tech in Atlanta.

B.72:  Oh, wow.

A.73:  [Inhaling] Man, it is just, uh, really expensive.  Two years ago it was two
hundred dollars for the basic, uh, major medical and the next year it was four
hundred.  You know, it doubled [noise] in a year like that --

B.74:  Wow.

A.75:  -- and so this, this is that year that was four hundred.  I just wasn't
prepared to pay for it.  I'm not too sure what I'm going to do about that
right now.  There's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant
feeling --

B.76:  #Right now# --

A.77:  -- #worrying# about that.

B.78:  -- right now, the company that, my company picks up the insurance, they
pay, I think it's thirty dollars a month.  So, it, three sixty a year --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and that's basic, uh, group health coverage.

A.81:  Is there any deductible with that or anything like,

B.82:  No.
