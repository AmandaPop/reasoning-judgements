A.1:  [Clicking].

B.2:  Well, Julie, uh, are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal
with, uh, special care for elderly?

A.3:  Well, I don't know.  My grandfather is ninety-two years old.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  And he is still living by himself.  My grandmother died a couple of years
ago {mispronounced}.  But he doesn't want to, to move away.  He lives in a
little farmhouse on a farm.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't want to
go to a nursing home.

B.8:  Is he able to, uh, still do everything himself pretty well?

A.9:  Well, he was until this operation.  He has arthritis.

B.10:  Oh, yeah.

A.11:  And now I don't really think he's doing that well.  And my, a lot of my
aunts and uncles live near him.  And I have one aunt that really looks after
him a lot.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  But, uh, my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a
hundred and three.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  And, uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home.

B.16:  Yeah.  And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f-,
grandfather's feelings.  Because, uh, [lipsmack] I th-, you know, I think for
a lot of people it really is the decision of, {pause} do they still have some
of their life left.  #And# --

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  -- and, for, for, I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's
like saying my life is over and I'm just here for the rest of the stay [door].
And so I, you know, [sigh] I guess most of the time when I think about
somebody going into a nursing home, [swallowing] it's more a case of where
they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs.  #Yeah# --

A.19:  #Uh-huh.#

B.20:  -- they have can look after a lot of things but there's some of the
day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore.
Uh, I know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home.  They generally
[sigh] were able to have someone care for them at home and they died [cough]
{in background}.  But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents
[laughter].  Like they were in their eighties.  That type of thing [lipsmack].
Uh, [lipsmack] but I did, uh, you know, I guess, uh, when I think nursing home
I do think of people that are not able to do, take care of themselves
physically.  #Uh [sigh],#

A.21:  #But# I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.  

B.22:  [Inhaling] And that's, that's difficult part.  Because I think what they
often get used as is, uh, almost like a very high level or long-term care for,
uh, similar to a hospital.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  [Inhaling] Uh, I know, like here in Saskatchewan, we have our [lipsmack]
hospital care (( )) [noise] the care actually for the older people graded in
level, in four levels.  And a level four type of care would be someone that
really requires long-term hospital care.  Generally are not able to look after
this-, themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically [inhaling].
Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's
Disease [cough] {background} or those or, or physical and mental handicaps.
Uh, you know, where they really require [swallowing] twenty-four hour
supervision of some kind [/noise].  #Even though# --

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  -- it may be minimal [inhaling].  And, uh, [sigh] [clanging] but I think
that it can be helpful in that, uh, it gets people the level of physical care
they need.  Uh,

A.27:  But I don't, I mean at least, I mean I think some nursing homes do that.
But I think a lot of nursing homes really, uh, are guilty of neglect.

B.28:  [Clicking] Yeah.  I th-, and I think it happens more in areas where it's,
uh, [lipsmack] I guess, uh, a broad social medical system [cough] {background}
where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing.
If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals [lipsmack] and, and I
guess that's sort of my lack of understanding.  I think that a majority of the
places in the U S, uh, you know, there is some government aid available, but
the majority ((of it)) is to the availability of the individual to pay [sigh]
[/clicking].

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And, uh, if you're not able to look after yourself, then you have to rely,
