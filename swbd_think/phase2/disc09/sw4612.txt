==========================================================================

B.1:  Did women, uh, have the more variety in this area, right?

A.2:  Oh, I suppose.  I, uh, substitute teach in our public schools and what I
find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and, and very casual things.
Polo shirts [laughter].  Uh, I'm of the opinion that I'm not one of the kids
and I want them to know that so I'll dress a little more formally.  I mean not
a business suit but, you know, a nice skirt and blouse or,

B.3:  Are you saying that the chi-, that the, uh, teachers are wearing jeans?

A.4:  Well, I, I should clarify.  I work in the, I'm an artist and I work in the
art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian but #[laughter],#

B.5:  #[Laughter].#

A.6:  yes, yes teachers are wearing jeans and they're wearing sneakers and
[laughter] kind of upsets me because i-, it seems that they're getting treated
as if they're sloppy and I, I like #the kids,# 

B.7:  #Treated# as if they're sloppy or treated as if they're, #uh, peers?#

A.8:  #As if i-, its, the# whole situation is too casual.  I don't ge-, think
they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior
from the kids and I think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude.
I think they're too casual with the kids and the ki-, kids curse in front of
them and --

B.9:  Ooh.

A.10:  -- and take too many liberties and I think --

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  -- uh, you know, as much as I'm there to be their, uh, to be there for them
but I'm not their friend, I'm there to teach them something and it's business
and it's serious and,

B.13:  Right.  Of course, motivation is everything and I suppose you're striving
for intimacy on a intellectual level.  It's really hard to figure out how
you're going to do that.  But, of course, we're trying to talk about dress and
not teaching [laughter] [cough].

A.14:  [Laughter] Well, I think I am talking about dress and how it conveys a, uh,
a sense of, uh, casual behavior and, you know, and, and where it goes from
there.  It's just a tangent of the same subject.

B.15:  Well, I am in a much more conventional position.  I work as a, uh, white
collar worker, uh, I'm a,

A.16:  [Noise] [meow].  

B.17:  senior principal scientist at S R I International.

A.18:  Uh-huh [noise].

B.19:  Uh, #work with,# 

A.20:  #What is,# uh, your particular field? 

B.21:  Speech technology.

A.22:  #Huh.#

B.23:  #Teaching# com-, teaching computers how to understand the speech.  

A.24:  Oh, so you must be very interested in, uh, Texas Instruments [laughter].
But, anyway, get off the subject.

B.25:  In Texas Instruments?  Oh, yeah, I actually used, I used to be chief speech
scientist at Texas Instruments.

A.26:  Oh [laughter], I see.  So I, I guess you're in a business suit all the
time?

B.27:  No #actually.# 

A.28:  #Oh.#

B.29:  I try to stay behind the scenes which means I wear slacks and, uh, my own
personal style and it's, it's variable.  And, there are a lot of people who
wear jeans but I say probably most people, uh, wear dresses or slacks and, uh,
wear, the men wear, uh, uh, probably most of them wear long sleeve shirts,
without ties.

A.30:  Huh.

B.31:  Uh, it's interesting.  It's sort of silly and ironic, not ironic, but it's
silly in, in a sense that on visitor days which is, are quite frequently,
people quite frequently dress up and they wear ties and coats and, uh, on
nonvisitor days people dress down and they wear just slacks and dress shirts.

A.32:  #Uh-huh.#

B.33:  #(( )).#

A.34:  It, it, well I guess it's silly in that the point is to be there and do
quality work and not wonder about what you're wearing too much.

B.35:  Right.  An-, and, it, it's not one of my, dressing is not one of my main
obsessions or preoccupations.

A.36:  Wha-, no I can see how you'd say that.  I'm not heavily into, uh, what's in
this year or what's out this year?  I have a certain amount of money that I
spend on clothing and I buy things that will last year after year and, uh,

B.37:  Well I, I buy a new shirt once a year, whether I need it or not.

A.38:  Oh, do you [laughter]?  So I guess you've got a collection don't you?

B.39:  [Laughter] Well, I don't pay much attention to it.

A.40:  Uh-huh [noise].  Well, I don't know.  Uh [breathing], 

B.41:  Now, this, this question.  Did it relate to work or did it relate to, to,
uh, whatever?

A.42:  I think it was just, uh, clothing and how you feel about it and do you
change your wardrobe from season to season?  Uh, I guess the warmer it gets
the less clothing I wear [laughter] but I don't know that I, I change my sense
of color or style to, to match a season.  But I do know people who have told
me that different carpets come out and different colors come out because, uh,
the seasons change your mood and your ideas of color and fashion change --

B.43:  Huh.

A.44:  -- with, uh, uh, you know, with your mood and I guess it's all kinds of
poetic, uh,

B.45:  I guess I'm a typical oblivious male in that respect.

A.46:  [Laughter] I've met males that aren't terribly oblivious to clothing.
It's, uh, 

B.47:  I said typical.

A.48:  Oh, okay [laughter].  Well some guys seem to think it's a shortcoming to
being too involved in their clothing, like they have deeper, more meaningful
things,
