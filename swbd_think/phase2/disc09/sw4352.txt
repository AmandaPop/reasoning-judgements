========================================================================

A.1:  Um, um, I'm a student in college right now, so.  [inhaling] I'm not really
in the market for a car.  I have one [noise] that I bought, uh, this past
summer, a used car which I uh hope it will last me for a while.  Uh, but, uh, I
guess it, it [breathing] fits my needs pretty well.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  It's, uh, a Ford Tempo and, uh, it's sort of a, you know, nice car, not,
not really you know huge and a tank but, uh, big enough so that you can fit
people in the back seat, so it's nice when I go places with other people.  Uh,
and, uh, (( )) an ordinary car --

B.4:  Right.

A.5:  -- it seems fairly reliable.

B.6:  #The, uh,# 

A.7:  #How about# you?

B.8:  I, I drive a Honda Prelude and, uh, I, I drove it.  When I was in college I
drove a sixty-eight Chevy Impala and I drove once I got out.  I, I work for A
T and T now.  So I have a real job and I, [laughter] and I, my friends kept
telling me that I could afford a better car, but they said, but I was happy
with my Impala, so I drove that for about three years until it completely died
and,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  then I got the Prelude and I think if I were to buy another car right now,
I think I would buy another Prelude.  I really like it.

A.11:  Yeah.  They're, they're pretty nice.  They're kind of sporty right?  I, --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- if I have the right #thing pictured.#

B.14:  #Yeah, it's a# two door.

A.15:  Yeah.  [cough] If I, I said if I was going out and buying a new car, I
might [smack] possibly buy something like that.  Uh, but, you know, I'm pretty
happy with what I have now, as I said.  [throat_clearing] The other, the other
kind of thing, a friend of mine just got a new car.  Got a Ford Explorer
[swallowing] and they're kind of neat cars, although they have their draw
backs.  I mean they're, they're you know, they're kind of big and whatever,
but, uh, when it comes to serv-, uh, moving stuff around which I find myself
doing fair amounts since I tend to sort of move about twice a year --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- at this point, uh, that kind of thing would be very handy.  Uh,
[sniffing] but, uh, yeah I don't again, I don't really have any, uh, you know,
strong preferences.  When I bought my car uh, you know, the major criteria was
that it, uh, be something that was rated fairly good for reliability.  Uh, and,
uh, you know not too expensive and you know, decent looking, but uh --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- I, I ended up getting a pretty good deal on the car I got but, uh, I am
very happy with it.  It's not, you know, I suppose if I, the maximum
reliability I would have gotten from a Japanese car but, uh, they also sell
for much more, especially used and I sort of decided that it probably wasn't
worth the price difference but, uh, you know even if I did occasionally spend
a little more for repairs but, uh, it would probably work out.  Now buying it
new, I don't know if that's true.  Uh, #you know, it probably isn't worth it
more.#

B.20:  #You went with the import.#

A.21:  Huh?

B.22:  You went with the import on, based on that.

A.23:  No, I didn't. #That's a Ford.#

B.24:  #Oh you didn't.#

A.25:  Yeah, I didn't.  I mean, I, I would say they probably are a little bit more
reliable, but at least on the used car market.  I think that's, uh, that's
factored into the price already and I don't, I don't think it's worth the
added price you pay --

B.26:  Oh, I see.

A.27:  -- I mean if you're going for like, uh, uh, you know say, uh, uh, you know,
a five year old car.  Uh, gi-, with for the given amount of mileage, the
Japanese car will be going for a lot more money #generally.#

B.28:  #You are going# to pay a lot more for it.

A.29:  Yeah.  #And especially# --

B.30:  #Yeah, that's what I found.#

A.31:  -- this one thing that I was kind of appalled at, is people would be
selling, uh, Japanese cars for, you know, that say had a hundred thousand miles
on it, and they would be asking for a lot of money for, um.  Like not much less
money than I found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand
miles on it or something.  [inhaling] And you know, people would say well, you
know, I mean they last forever and whatever, but I, I mean, I have to be a
little bit skeptical.  I mean #maybe it's true but,# 

B.32:  #They don't last# forever.

A.33:  Huh?

B.34:  They, they don't last #forever.#

A.35:  #Yeah, I mean,# 

B.36:  They maybe last twenty percent longer or something --

A.37:  Yeah.  Any --

B.38:  -- but still.

A.39:  -- any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems.  So, I, I knew
that, you know, I definitely, I definitely wasn't going to buy something with,
you know, eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it.  Uh, if I could avoid it
#so.#

B.40:  #Yeah# and as happy as I am with my Honda, I have had problems with it.

A.41:  Really, #I'm# --

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  -- surprised.

B.44:  I mean I haven't had serious problems with it, but it's got a hundred
thousand miles on it now.

A.45:  Oh, okay. #Well, that's [laughter] yeah that's,# 

B.46:  #So, I# replaced the clutch and timing chain.

A.47:  [Throat_clearing] [swallowing] Yeah, I've heard, is it the Hondas where you
have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something
like that?

B.48:  I don't know.  I've #heard that# --

A.49:  #(( )).#

B.50:  -- with Honda, with Honda that is pretty nat-, it's pretty normal to need a
new timing belt after, uh, I think seventy, seventy thousand miles.

A.51:  Did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a
presumptuous. 

B.52:  No, I did my clutch and they said, you want us to replace the timing belt
while we're in there and I said no [laughter].

A.53:  Huh.

B.54:  Now, I wi-, and I wished I had later because I had to go in and, uh, I,
couldn't, I couldn't move the car.  I had to go in and replace it.

A.55:  Yeah.  I think, yes, I think I remember hearing that either the Hondas or
the Toyotas, uh, that if the timing belt went, in, under the right
circumstances, you know, I guess which would be while the car was running and
maybe some, you know, certain speeds or whatever, that it could cause the, uh,
uh, cause fairly serious engine damage.

B.56:  Huh.

A.57:  I could be wrong about that.  I, it's just something that I just vaguely
remember hearing.  #Uh.#

B.58:  #That I haven't heard.#

A.59:  Yeah but, uh, I could be wrong about that, but, yeah, I mean I would say in
general, you know probably a,
