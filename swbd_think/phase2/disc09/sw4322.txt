A.1:  Okay, national service.  What do you think about it?  I'm sorry, I forg-, I
forgot your name already.

B.2:  Lee.  

A.3:  Lee, okay, Lee.  

@B.4:  Oh, well, I think ideally, people should want to do that automatically,
and that they should want to do what, you know, meshes with how they feel and
what they're good at --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Um, well, [laughter] you're not going to get a whole lot of
disagreement from me [laughter].  None of the people that I talk to on this
project disagree with me very much, which kind of,

B.8:  [Groan].

A.9:  surprises me.  

B.10:  Well, in that case,

A.11:  [Laughter]. 

B.12:  I think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to, uh, you
know, get people just thinking, hey, this is normal, it's normal to do good --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- you know -- 

A.15:  Um.  

B.16:  -- to be civic minded.

A.17:  Um. 

B.18:  You know, just so they won't, you know, everybody will just think, --

A.19:  Well,

B.20:  -- this is the way things are and it,

A.21:  Think of how much we have to pay for it.  I'm, I'm, you know, I think if
it's voluntary, you get the people that want to be there, they'll do well.  If
it's mandatory, you get everybody, you get people that don't want to, don't
want to do work like that and they'll goof off or, or sell drugs to their
coworkers or something like that, um.

B.22:  Um, well, I'm not looking at the mandatory, uh, program as a cost effective
way of getting this stuff done.  I'm looking at it as a way to shape people's
psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing.

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  Of course, the program would have to work or else they'll think, yeah,
public service, another boondoggle.

A.25:  Yeah I'm,

B.26:  You know, they'll be sitting there working on the job -- 

A.27:  Well, think of,

B.28:  -- doing nothing.  

A.29:  Yeah, I, I, but I wonder about that.  The, the mere fact that it isn't cost
effective, do you think that, that if it's not cost effective, do you think
that people are going to be enthused about it?

B.30:  Oh, well, certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things
aren't thinking cost effective.

A.31:  Well [laughter] you've got, you've got a far fewer number.  What percentage
of, of, of people do you think now do something like that?  Um,

B.32:  Well, I think everything that people, you know, what do people do?  They
polish their cars, right?  Why do they do it?  Because they think they're
going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that
much longer?  No, because they want it to look really sharp.

A.33:  Um.  

B.34:  It's not a cost effective thing.  You know, they raise money to build a new
church.  Because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there, because it's
cost effective, or because they need the space.

A.35:  Well, I don't, [breathing] if you need the space, I suppose it's cost
effective because [laughter] you can't get along with the old, with, with the
old one, but, uh, [lipsmack] no, I, and it just seems to me that, that, that
once you get everybody involved, there's, there's what, there's eight million
is it, uh, uh, kids c-, uh, turning eighteen every year, I think it's about
that, might be a little bit lower now, but, uh, that's an awful lot to bring
into a program.  You got to have eight million jobs available, you've got to
have administrators for eight million jobs.  That would be tremendously
expensive.  Not, you know, not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids
in, uh, in, in non market, uh, e-, enterprises for, for, for a couple of
years.  Uh, that's going to delay their entry into the work force, delay the
time when they can begin paying taxes, too, so, so the impact is going to be
double there.  I, uh, [lipsmack] just don't s-, 

B.36:  You have to define the purpose of the program.  You know, is there excess
labor and that's why you're doing this?

A.37:  No.  

B.38:  I mean,   

A.39:  I don't know. I,

B.40:  What, there's sort of both --

A.41:  I think the,

B.42:  -- excess, excess bodies available to labor, but then there's not enough
skilled labor.  So at the same time you have too many people who want to w-,
or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work.

A.43:  Yeah, uh, I, I grant to that, but if that's the case, then it needn't,
the-, then you don't have a m-, you don't need a mandatory program to bring
everybody into national service.  You just need a program for the people that
haven't gotten anyth-, gotten anything better to do.  And I think that might
be a good idea.  Although, again, then you get the kind of people who are
likely to sell drugs to their coworkers, et cetera.

B.44:  Well, they did this in, uh, the Depression.  They invented, what, the C C
C.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  And, uh, they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and
plant trees and,

A.47:  Th-, that's true, but, but I think that was different, uh, in at least
three respects.  First of all, uh, it was not a mandatory program.  If you
didn't have another job, you could join it, you were not required to, but it
was a way to get a paycheck, so people did join it.  Secondly, the time of the
Depression was just vastly different.  People were not as cynical about
society, about government and about the nation as they are now.  Uh, so they
didn't react negatively as many people would today.  And thirdly, the economic
conditions were different.  It was a big drain on the Treasury during the
Depression as well.  It's not clear that it made it any easier to get out of
the Depression,
