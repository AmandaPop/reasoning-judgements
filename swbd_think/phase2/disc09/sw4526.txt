==========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  Do you have any, uh, strong feelings on schools?

@B.2:  [Breathing] Well, uh, I think that, uh, the majority of the problem
[squeak] with the school system, uh, is similar to the majority [dishes] in a
lot of other areas, in it's a question of economics.  And school system is not
designed to be successful.  Uh, by that, uh, it's not really profitable for
good teachers to be in the school systems.  Uh, if there are good school
teachers, good really qualified, people as school teachers, it's because
they're dedicated, not because they're rewarded for doing so.  Uh, the sc-,
the public school system, uh, needs to be viewed, I think, kind of like the
highways and hospitals and everything else.  It's part of the infrastructure.
It's something that has to be.  And has to be, you know, highly maintained in
order for the nation itself to be successful [door].  And when you, uh, when
you neglect part of the infrastructure, be it the roads or the schools or
whatever, then everything kind of follows with that.  It's just a question of
how long before you pay the price.

A.3:  I've, I've, uh, heard the, that proposed before and I'm not, uh,
discounting it completely.  But the counter argument to that is that, uh,
there are schools around that are, uh, [lipsmack] private schools.  Not
necessarily (( )) parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than
they are in the public schools and they, and their track records are much
better.

B.4:  Huh.

A.5:  Uh, the, uh, in fact these days there's a lot of, [squeak] uh, there are a
lot of Catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by
nuns and, and I'm not a Catholic so [inhaling] but I was just reading about
this and what they're, the [swallowing] argument that I've heard is that, uh,
and I subscribe to some of it by the way.  That, uh, our schools are
reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that, uh, lead to the demise of the
Soviet Union.  And that is when you've got an absolute monopoly and, uh, you
can't, uh, it's a one party system so to speak, then what you're going to have
is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares.  And reality, uh, uh, is just not a
market base system.  And I know I've been in the Orient for about three years
and the public schools are not very good but the, all, all, of the good
schools are private schools over there.  And, uh, it's not that we're
spending, I, I think that we're spending a lot of money, uh, relatively
speaking on schools.  But, uh, as with other things, you know, it like a
Detroit or some of the other problems, uh, with ((D-,)), it's not the worker,
it's the, uh, it's the management.

B.6:  Huh.

A.7:  And, uh, management frankly just doesn't have to, they don't have to
compete these days.

B.8:  Yeah.  I'd heard something, as a matter of fact, uh, kind of along those
lines with, I think it was the New York school system.  Where they suddenly
instituted a sort of market system where, uh, basically the kids were allowed
to take whatever classes they wanted to.  And go to whatever school they
wanted to.  And it was up to the schools to attract the kids.  #Uh# --

A.9:  #Yeah.#

B.10:  -- and offer stuff the kids wanted.  And what turned out happening, this
was like area of the country with the highest drop out #rate and all of this
kind of stuff.#

A.11:  #Yeah [laughter].#

B.12:  And what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or
anything like that.  Uh, it ended up that, uh, the rate of, of graduating
students went way, way up.  And they ended up taking real courses but it was
because they wanted to and cause they chose to instead of were being forced
to.  And, and the, the people were forced to compete and, and the good
teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff.

A.13:  Yeah.  And, and, well I see that as a, as what I consider the biggest
problem, uh, as with, with, uh, oh, there, there are other problems.  And
number one it would be nice if, if teachers got paid, uh, uh, I, I hate to see
the, how shall I say it, the garbage, the guys that collect garbage and, and,
uh.

B.14:  Sanitation engineers.

A.15:  Yes [laughter].  Well, the sanitation engineers that go out there with, uh,
and, uh, just lift, uh, #I hate to see# --

B.16:  #Yeah.  And, I.#

A.17:  -- those guys get paid more than teachers.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And (( )) teachers are, uh, under a lot more stress and don't get any tips
at the end of the da-, uh, you know, at Christmas time.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  So, uh, uh, from that st-, and frankly the private school systems, uh,
[lipsmack] including colleges and things like that, do quite well --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- uh, because there's a lot of competition.  And if somebody decides that
they're going, if their decisions are out of step with reality, uh, pretty
soon people don-, stop going there.

B.24:  [Noise] {sounds like he is pouring something}.  Yeah [/breathing]
[/dishes].

A.25:  And, uh, or they get a horrible reputation,
