===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what are your thoughts?

B.2:  Well, uh, interestingly enough, I've been reading in the paper about, uh,
the option that says basically none of the above --

A.3:  [Laughter] yeah.

B.4:  -- and, uh,  

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  given the choices, that's sometimes how I feel.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  I generally support President Bush and I feel like he gets a lot of bad
press, you know, the, the economy is really not his fault I don't think.

A.9:  No, no.

B.10:  But, uh, as far as anybody else running, I think wow [laughter] --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- is this the best we have to offer.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  Two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I, uh, uh, on Sunday night I was l-, uh, listening to, uh,
the radio and they had, they had speculated that, uh, there was some rumor
that Tsongas was thinking of running again?

B.16:  Yeah.  What I heard this morning is that although he has dropped out, he's
still got a lot of support in New York apparently --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and t-, t-, you know, it, today is the New York primary and they seem to
be saying that if he got a good, he's still on the ballot in New York --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump
back in.

A.21:  [Laughter] Well, th-, doesn't that seem sort of, uh, uh, {pause} it doesn't
seem, seem like it's useful for him to, uh, doesn't it seem like a waste of
money though for him to come back into the race this late?  Uh, what are his
chances of winning at this point?

B.22:  [Sigh] Well [laughter] obviously he thought they weren't too good if he,
if he backed out.

A.23:  Exactly.

B.24:  Uh, I don't know.  Maybe, you know, New York is a big primary --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and there are a lot of others still to come.  Maybe he feels like if he
can carry New York strongly then he could still make it.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  Sure.  

B.28:  But, uh, I don't know.

A.29:  Yeah, what, what did you think about the, Buchanan this term?

B.30:  Uh, {pause} it's hard to say.  It's nice to get somebody in there, I would
certainly never vote for him --

A.31:  #Uh-huh.#

B.32:  -- #as far# as I know -- 

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- but it, it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front
and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend
himself.

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  So, I think, in that sense, it's good.  I don't think that, uh, he's
experienced enough to do the job.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Uh, on the other hand, maybe he is.  I mean #[laughter]# --

A.39:  #Uh-huh.#

B.40:  -- the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway, so maybe he can just
go ahead and keep doing it.

A.41:  Right, right.  #((Well)),# 

B.42:  #How about# you?

A.43:  Yeah, I, I agree with you.  It does seem that he came in and kind of
fluffed the pillows, uh, you know, uh, for, for the campaign anyway so we
didn't have to hear the same thing again --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- uh, we didn't have to, uh, [cough] we didn't have to ignore a lot of,
uh, Bush's success because, you know, he really did a lot in the last term.
He, uh, wi-, with the Gulf War and all we could have, we could have had our
judgement clouded just by his, his accomplishments, you know, #I# --

B.46:  #Uh-huh.#

A.47:  -- I really do think I am going to vote for him again next term but, but, 
uh, I wanted to know exactly everything that happened.  You know, a lot of
times maybe I forget [sniffing].

B.48:  Well, when you look at it too, how much does the Gulf War really count?
I mean, how, for example, how much has it helped us as, as a people?

A.49:  Oh, sure.

B.50:  I'm sure that we can say it helped the, uh, ((enemy)) rate of Kuwait.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Um, and, uh, sure it shook a peo-, a few people up in Iraq, but --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- i-, is that a success or is that just sort of, uh, part of the job
description #as far as# --

A.55:  #Right.#

B.56:  -- the President goes.

A.57:  Right, Uh, wha-, what I mean is though, the strong sense of, uh,
nationalism that occurred, you know, right after the war --  

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- uh, sort of heroized George Bush, you know, whether or not it was, you
know, a success for us or whatnot [throat_clearing].  He tended to come out of
the, out of the experience, you know, as the great american hero --

B.60:  Oh, yeah. 

A.61:  -- #((and, uh)),# 

B.62:  #Yeah,# his, his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the
#time.#

A.63:  #Yeah,#, yeah.

B.64:  And it,

A.65:  So I, I, I, I'm glad that, uh, he can't get into office this time without
at least, uh, addressing #a lot of# --

B.66:  #Yeah.#

A.67:  -- the, the home front issues --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and, uh.  Well, Todd, uh, it sounds like, uh, we may have covered a, uh,
a miniscule portion of politics today #[laughter].#

B.70:  #A very miniscule portion.#  So what about Libya? 

A.71:  What about Libya?  

B.72:  #Yeah.#

A.73:  #I have# no idea what to say about,

B.74:  You, you've heard of the goings on there #I guess?# 

A.75:  #Yeah#, I, I don't know, uh, if, if you had asked me the same question
about, uh, uh, Kuwait, you know, at, this early in the game I don't what I
would have said then either.  I, I don't, [sigh] uh, now, of course, the last
time I listened to anything was on Sunday, uh, and they had still refused, uh,
the concessions by the Security Council so,

B.76:  I thought it was, le-, I have to make sure I get the, uh, stories right
because, because there was also yesterday the attrac-, the attacks on the 
Embassy.

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  But now didn't Libya,
