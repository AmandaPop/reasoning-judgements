========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, looks like we're ready to go.  Capital punishment, uh, the problem I
have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent
to crime, but I don't think that it really actually does that.  I don't think
it deters anybody, because [throat_clearing] most of the time crimes are, uh,
are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences and they don't
think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do this, uh,
because, uh, I might get the gas chamber or something like that.  They worry
about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it.  [inhaling] And, uh,
how about you [throat_clearing]?

B.2:  Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted.  

A.3:  Uh-huh, I do, too, yep.  

B.4:  And I don't, I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or
not.

A.5:  Uh-huh, yeah, you still have to do it.  I,

B.6:  I mean -- 

A.7:  I,   

B.8:  -- I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- or,   

A.11:  So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.  

B.12:  Well, for some things.  

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  I think for serial murder -- 

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in
cold --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- blood,

A.19:  Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society.  

B.20:  I mean,

A.21:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.22:  you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape -- 

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  -- from prison -- 

A.25:  And then do it all over again.  

B.26:  -- and do it again.  

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.  

A.29:  Right.  Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of i-, in favor of capital
punishment also.  I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these
people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, I tend
to agree with you that, uh, we should have it [throat_clearing].  I just, I
don't know that it's always effective [laughter], but I guess we, uh, we're
kind of stuck with it.  It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to
determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime,
[inhaling] uh,

B.30:  But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant
capital punishment.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  You know,

A.33:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.34:  just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women
have killed their husbands --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- who abused them --

A.37:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- and I don't think,

A.39:  [Cough]. 

B.40:  that would really warrant capital punishment.  

A.41:  Uh-huh, huh.  Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh,
[throat_clearing] like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger
to society.  It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.

B.42:  Uh [breathing], it is to a certain extent -- 

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- but I think, I don't know because,

A.45:  I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess.  Uh,

B.46:  I think in s-, and it,

A.47:  [Throat_clearing].

B.48:  just would depend upon the circumstances -- 

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- and, and the extent of the abuse -- 

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- and, and if another alternative was --

A.53:  Um.

B.54:  -- available.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh,
unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time
ago, I guess in Biblical times [throat_clearing] when they had punishment
[inhaling], if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you
had the right to administer the punishment.  So if somebody killed somebody in
your family [throat_clearing], then you had the right to, uh, if that person
was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person.
And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel
that I had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, [throat_clearing]
but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere [laughter].  That's kind of
drastic punishment.

B.56:  Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment.  

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  And,   

A.59:  Might make you feel better but [laughter],

B.60:  But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- then that chance sh-, should be investigated.  

A.63:  Right.  

B.64:  But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- going to murder people no matter what -- 

A.67:  Right.  

B.68:  -- then I think they should be eliminated from -- 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- society.  

A.71:  Right, because they're a danger to everybody else.  Huh, that's
interesting.  I have to, uh --

B.72:  But,   

A.73:  -- agree with that.  There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison
that, uh, that aren't really a danger to society, huh, and, uh,

B.74:  And a lot of people that [laughter] are a danger --

A.75:  [Laughter] Right.  

B.76:  -- to society that aren't in prison.  

A.77:  [Laughter] Right, probably more of them then the other way around
[laughter].  Interesting.  I don't, I don't, not sure I, I'm in Washington, D
C or at least very close to it.  I'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital
punishment we have here.

B.78:  Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment. 

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  And I'm ((in)), I'm from South Carolina.
