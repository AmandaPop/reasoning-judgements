========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think on, uh, on a scale of one to ten, where would you rate
yourself on on gun control?

@B.2:  Uh, [noise] one being maximum control or minimal control?

A.3:  Most and ten being no restrictions at all.

B.4:  [Laughter] That well, I guess, probably some where in the middle.  I've,
uh, mixed feelings about it.

A.5:  Uh-huh. 

B.6:  Uh,

A.7:  Yeah. I think I would be, be somewhere around a four or five myself.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  And, uh, it seems to me like there's, there's, it's not it's not fair to
just kind of do everything, all the same with all guns, cause they're not all
the same, #you know.#

B.10:  #Right# [noise].

A.11:  Like hand guns and, uh, assault rifles, I think are a little bit different
than rifles and shotguns.

B.12:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.13:  So,  

B.14:  Well, uh, I, ours, my families from, uh, South Georgia and you know they
hunt quite a bit.  So I, I really don't, you know, guns just something that
you have down there and, uh, uh, I, I tend to agree on that, you know, but, uh,
[smack] assault rifles, you know, that's, that's, uh, made [laughter],

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  made to kill somebody you know.

A.17:  And you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to, uh, to get hold of a
deer.  And,

B.18:  Yeah.  So,

A.19:  #And if# --

B.20:  #Yeah, I feel, uh,#

A.21:  -- you did, it really wouldn't be worth eating, so [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter]  Yeah, right.

A.23:  #Yeah.#

B.24:  #Or cleaning.#

A.25:  Yeah [inhaling].

B.26:  But, uh, I, I've heard some, uh, talk about [noise] you know having like a
three day waiting period or something --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- uh, to try to buy a firearm or something and I don't, I don't have a
problem with that.  You know I think if you've got a, if you've got a
[laughter] history of, uh, of violent crimes or something then you certainly
don't need a hand gun.

A.29:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  That makes sense.

B.30:  So, yeah.

A.31:  That makes a lot of sense.  I don't see, uh, I mean, it's not like you're
going to go, hey, I'll go hunting today.

B.32:  Uh, yeah.

A.33:  And usually if you are going to go hunting, it's pretty early in the
morning anyway and the store is not going to be open, so.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  A three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  I guess the only real questions then is, uh, is gun control.  Does it, does
it work?  I mean can you enforce it?

B.38:  Well, uh, I think it, uh, I mean, if you can, if you're going to commit
some violent crime, and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then, uh,
to, to restrict it would certainly cut down on, on that, but you know, that
people, you can get a gun fairly easily.  I would think.  I mean, I, I feel
like I could get a gun in an hour if I had to, you know.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  So, uh, obviously, it's not going to, uh, get rid of all, all your, uh,
illegal weapons out there or dange-, you know.  It --

A.41:  Yeah.  I don't,

B.42:  -- dangerous weapons out of people's hands but, uh, I think it would help
some.

A.43:  I guess, I mean the only thing that I wor-, I question is, I mean, I think
if, if it was really easy to enforce that it, it would be great.  The only
thing that, uh, that would worry me about it is that the only real way that I
know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having weapons not
registered, you can tag on a couple of extra years --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- but, as it is now, you put someone in prison and they're out in, you
know --

B.46:  Yeah.  No time.

A.47:  -- one fifth --

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  -- of the time they were sentenced to anyway.

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  So, I mean, they're, they're not even staying in prison without the extra
years on there, much less --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- I don't think they would be staying any longer --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- with extra years tagged on there.

B.56:  Yeah.  I don't really think, uh, I mean I think, uh, gun control, uh, to
some extent can could help crime situations but [noise], uh, I think, I
personally, my personal belief is, you know, as you commit a crime, you know,
you should be punished and, uh [laughter], and if you know you are not going to
get punished or very little punishment, then there's no reason not to.

A.57:  Uh-huh.  I think you might have had, I guess, ((I'm that)) got to be (( )),
but I like the idea of the, uh, the waiting period because I don't think that,
I mean, I really think if someone wants to get a gun to commit a gun to commit
a crime, they are going to get a gun #but# --

B.58:  #Yeah.#

A.59:  -- uh, if someone is just like, all hot and bothered and ready to go out
and, uh, and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally --

B.60:  Right.  Yeah.

A.61:  -- ((that)) a three day waiting period, you're not going to stay that angry
for that long.

B.62:  Yeah, usually not.

A.63:  At least I'm not [laughter].

B.64:  Yeah, I, I agree.  At least you [laughter] have a little bit of time to
think about it.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  And, uh, I think, I don't know that accounts for at least some of the
shootings that go on --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then,
