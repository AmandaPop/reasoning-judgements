=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so I guess it starts recording now.  

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  Okay.  I don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area
that we're in.  We live in the Saginaw area.

@B.4:  Saginaw?  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  And I'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that, I, fact as far
as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here.
And, uh, or the grocery store or anything [laughter] --

B.6:  Really?   

A.7:  -- in this area, yeah.  

B.8:  The rec-, we live in Plano and they started off recycling by, uh, putting
the, I think at each Wal-Mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things
like that, which now, I guess the, uh, city is, has bought the big green trash
cans and, uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you
separate your glass and paper --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- and, uh, aluminum and you set it out and they pick it up and it, it
works real neat.  They seem to be having a real good response.

A.11:  Really?  

B.12:  So,   

A.13:  That is pretty good.  I'm, we're originally from another state and I know
in the state we were from that they did that t-, similar type thing.  The city
brought ought, you know, set tr-, separate trash cans and you separated your
stuff and you put it in there and they took it, you know.

B.14:  Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back
for --

A.15:  I don't really know.  

B.16:  -- for cans ((even or)),

A.17:  I don't really know, they, they started after we moved down here and so --

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  -- I, I'm not really familiar.  I just know that, uh, my in-laws up in, up
in Oklahoma, that's how they do, you know, they pick it up, but I don't know
if they get a, get anything back on it or, do you get money for it?

B.20:  No, I just, I noticed it Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per
aluminum can.

A.21:  Oh. 

B.22:  So you don't see too many thrown out around the [laughter] streets.

A.23:  Really [laughter].  

B.24:  Or even bottles.  

A.25:  [Laughter].

B.26:  You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, I
guess when you purchase them and, and then when you turn them back in.

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  I n-, I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel.

A.29:  Right.  And now, now most of them are throwaway.  

B.30:  Right.  

A.31:  [Laughter]. 

B.32:  So, maybe that's one thing they can do.  

A.33:  I think now they're a lot more expensive than that.  Uh, I bought some
Cokes the other day in the br-, the little bottles --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- you know, and I think the bottles were like, I know they were at least
ten cents apiece.  I ((started to see)), at home, I was like, God, how much
were those bottles [laughter] you know?

B.36:  Yes.  

A.37:  And, it was, they come in like, uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, you
know --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- instead of six packs and, uh, and they were like, it was like two
dollars and something for the bottles.  [laughter] You know, I was like God
Almighty, it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes.

B.40:  That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.  He was in the bottle
area [laughter].

A.41:  In the bot-, [laughter] (( )). 

B.42:  It's pretty dangerous out there, you know, when they fall over, but --

A.43:  Right.  

B.44:  -- but it's, uh, it's quite, they say that the green glass now, that
there's a big glut --

A.45:  Oh, really?  

B.46:  -- of green -- 

A.47:  Of green glass.  

B.48:  -- the green glass, yeah.  It's amazing.  

A.49:  Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything.  Now, I know that
like Minyard's --

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  -- and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of
those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front.

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that, but I,
I do know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them
because people were coming and dumping their trash in them.

B.54:  Right.  

A.55:  [Breathing]. 

B.56:  Yeah it's, I notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs.

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  It, it's, people just, they, they really don't, uh, there's too much labor
involved I guess to separate the stuff.

A.59:  Yeah, more than it's worth.  

B.60:  It's, I don't know, it, it can be, it's not as easy [laughter],

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  selecting, you know, clean junk as they say.  

A.63:  Right.  Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away
[laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter] That's right, that's right.  It's like washing the dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

A.65:  [Laughter] Right, uh, yeah.  

B.66:  We all do it [laughter].  

A.67:  [Laughter].

B.68:  Well, it was nice talking to you.  

@@A.69:  It was nice talking to you.  I have no idea how long this is supposed to
last or anything.

B.70:  Oh, I think, I think two or three minutes is -- 

A.71:  I-,   

B.72:  -- fine.  

A.73:  Is that it?  

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  Okay, well, it was nice talking to you and I, I guess I'll do this for, I
was doing this for, actually, I was going to do it for my son so that he
could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.

B.76:  Right.  

A.77:  Uh, but then it has my name on it, so I'm like, okay, I'll sit down here
and call it [laughter].

B.78:  Well, we're doing it for a church choir so,

A.79:  Oh, are you?  

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  Oh, that's interesting.  

B.82:  So,

A.83:  That's nice.  Well,

B.84:  Well, thank you.  

A.85:  Thank you.  Bye.  

B.86:  Bye-bye.
