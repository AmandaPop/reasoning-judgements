=======================================================================

A.1:  We're all set there.  Uh,

B.2:  Okay. 

A.3:  Have you ever been tested for drugs?

@B.4:  Uh, no I sure haven't, huh-uh.

A.5:  Yeah, I've worked in, uh, many jobs where it was a requirement to, uh, for
the actual position.  I've worked for power plants across the country as a
nuclear inspector --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug
test.

B.8:  What kind of test do they do?  I mean, just --

A.9:  #Just urine# --

B.10:  -- #for# --

A.11:  -- urine tests.

B.12:  -- urine tests.

A.13:  Yeah, checking for various sets of drugs.

B.14:  Uh, have you heard that they can test so far back.  They say six or seven
months, whether you've done drugs by, uh, taking some of your hair?

A.15:  Uh, I've heard of that happening.  I've, from everything I've experienced,
the only way they've ever done is urine tests.

B.16:  Oh, okay.  

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  But is that possible though?

A.19:  I would imagine it probably is.  

B.20:  Oh, okay.  Uh, huh.  Well no, I've never been tested for, uh, drugs or
anything like that.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  How do you feel about, uh, testing in the, in the, uh --

B.22:  Work place?

A.23:  -- work place?

B.24:  Uh, I don't think it's really necessary.  It's just dependent upon the type
job it is.  If it's a job that's, uh, dealing with say, uh, like a pharmacy job
or something like that, maybe --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a
doctor or something like that but, uh, as far as just, yeah, an every day job,
I would say no.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Just certain categories, I would say.

A.29:  Anything dealing with the safety of the public or,

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  Yeah, I feel pretty strong about that too.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  It's strange.  I, the last job I had up in, uh, Plymouth, New Hampshire, it
was for an accounts position --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and, uh, I actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job --

B.36:  Really.

A.37:  -- which I thought was rather unusual since I didn't, really wasn't
effecting the safety of the public at all.

B.38:  Um, that is unusual.

A.39:  But it, I think it shows a growing trend, uh, in the work place to do drug
testing.  They don't want people who [inhaling], uh, basically have that
character-, characteristic in there or that trait in their character.

B.40:  Um. [smack] But the thing is, that do you think at some point, you know,
probably about everyone has, has experienced drugs of some type?

A.41:  Uh, excuse me, I didn't hear that.

B.42:  Do you think that it's possible that, uh, about every individual have
experienced some drug of some type?

A.43:  No, I don't think so at all.  We we're, uh, recently at a little camp out
with about fifteen people and well I'm thirty-one, but a lot of the people
that were there, were in the twenty-one to twenty-four age group --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs.  That topic had
come up.  They hadn't even experimented with it.

B.46:  Oh that's,

A.47:  Which I see as a good trend toward the future.

B.48:  Right.  Is it a pretty larg-, so it must be a pretty large percentage still
that experiment with drugs, right?

A.49:  I think in the past there has been.

B.50:  Oh.  Okay.

A.51:  I think definitely in the seventies and the early eighties.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Uh, it almost became a popular thing just to experiment and try it.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  Uh, as far as users, regular users, uh, again, it also depends on what
areas you are looking at too.

B.56:  Right. Right.

A.57:  I think in more in your subu-, suburban areas.

B.58:  Yeah {very faint}.

A.59:  I think you see less of it.  Uh, and more in the cities, uh, it's more
likely, you're more likely to encounter that.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's true.  What, what do you think the chances of of drug
every diminishing.  Uh, because a lot of it I feel that they catch the people
that ((are handling)) drugs, but they're not catching the people that bring
drugs into the country.

A.61:  [Smack] Uh, I think it's not necessarily a losing battle, but I don't think
it's one you can win.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  I think it's, it's, drugs have been around since the beginning of time just
about.  Uh, in one form or another.  People looking for a way to relax.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  Uh, unfortunately, they're pe-, the drug makers, the illegal drug makers
are experimenting with more dangerous variation of what use to be very
harmless drugs.

B.66:  Um.

A.67:  Or relatively harmless.  And also our society has become more technical, so
that the, when you use a drug, the ramifications of, uh, uh, a side effect,
harming other people has become more, uh, frequent.

B.68:  Um.  That's interest,

A.69:  You know the chance of getting into an automobile now days and hurting
someone being on drugs or in a plane if you're a pilot --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- uh --

B.72:  Well, that's true.

A.73:  -- it's pretty, uh, pretty hot.  Whereas three hundred years ago,
[laughter] the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse.

B.74:  It sure was.  Uh,
