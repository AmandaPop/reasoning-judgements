===========================================================================

A.1:  Been about ten years since I graduated from high school.  I got a G E D.
I was a drop out up until that point.

B.2:  [Noise] {sounds like a dryer or machinery} Uh-huh.

A.3:  And, uh, as my memory serves me, school was not that, uh, didn't achieve
it's goals as being an educational institution very well.  And I would suppose
that the trend in government is for things to get worse.  Kind of like, uh,
chaos and regular deterioration.  So I don't, not having seen anything to,

B.4:  [Rustling].

A.5:  change my mind, I would assume it's gotten worse [clicking] in the
meantime.

B.6:  Yeah.  I graduated about the same time you did.  And, uh, I graduated early
only and I was lucky because I don't think I would have graduated at all, I
was skipping and everything.  

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  Up to that point.  And I just happened to have enough credit hours so I
could get out.

A.9:  Yeah.  I had really reached the point where I'd quit going entirely.  I was
tired of it.  Was off working somewhere.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  There was almost no challenge to it at all.  #Uh,# 

B.12:  #I was# on the college track doing all the classes and I was ((done)).

A.13:  #Huh.#

B.14:  #It# was boring.  They weren't interested.

A.15:  Yeah.  I had started in that, uh, that track but just got sick of it and
turned into a juvenile delinquent instead.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Went off and joined the military and then, uh, came back to college.  It
just, the material was so repetitive.  It was stuff we already seen probably
half a, who knows how many times before.  And it was just presented so dryly
and I suppose that if, uh, if you're going to pay teachers the salary
that they're paid, that's, that's the level of education that's going to be
presented.  

B.18:  That's true.  We have to pay our teachers more and give them more
incentive to interest the children.  

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Uh, yeah, I really, [rustling] I really believe the same thing.  I mean,
here I am now, just now finishing up college.  It took me that long to get
interested to go back [/rustling].

A.21:  Huh.

B.22:  You know.  And, but I find college a whole different ball game.

A.23:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a stress test #[laughter].#

B.24:  #It is.  But it's# so stimulating.  I mean those teachers really are, at
least mine, of course I'm in nursing so #[laughter].#

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  Ours is a lot of life threatening.  But, uh, I, it, it isn't, I, I don't
miss classes.  I love it.

A.27:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.  It's a whole another class of everything.
The level of education, the, uh, excitement.  And the, the interesting
instructors.  Their level of understanding the material.  Everything's
different.

B.28:  Maybe we ought to, uh, offer this kind of enrichment to our high school
students.  

A.29:  Now how would you recommend doing that?

B.30:  Well, if somehow we could mak-, give them a certain amount of independence,
cause that's part of college.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  Right?  Um, and then simply say, this is up to you to achieve this.  

A.33:  Sounds a lot like the, uh, what do they call, let's see, uh, fire fox,
Foxfire method?

B.34:  I haven't heard about that.

A.35:  That's the one where, uh, some guy, it's here in Georgia, north
Georgia, several years ago, ten, twenty years ago, walked into a class room
and they, the students retained command.  And he just kind of threw up his
hands and said, basically, do what you want to do and developed this, uh,
program where the students pretty much did what they wanted to do.  The
teacher was just there to kindly loosely, kind of loosely guide them --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- along and to make sure that they weren't getting, getting off into weird
senseless subject areas and stuff like that.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And, I think, it was some kind of sociology class along the lines of,
uh, [lipsmack] what did they do?  They went out and collected stories and
culture of the area.

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #In# southern Appalachian, uh, mountains.  And published a bunch of
books.  And the guy's real famous now.  And, in fact, I just read recently
that some school here in north Georgia decided to completely, uh, adopt the
Foxfire method.  All the classes are that way.  

B.42:  Oh, really.  

A.43:  And they say that the results are just tremendous.

B.44:  [Rustling].  

A.45:  It's a whole another, uh, magnitude of improvement over regular public
schools.

B.46:  See.  And that, and it works.  

A.47:  Yeah.  I wish there had been something like that years ago when we were
younger.

B.48:  Me too.  I wish they had had computers #[laughter].#

A.49:  #[Laughter] yeah, they've made a,# an amazing change.  

B.50:  I think, I think elementary school is educa-, is stimulating for children
and I think we lose them somewhere between junior high and high school.  

A.51:  A friend here in town just recently helped a, uh, third grader with his
science fair project.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And he was describing some of the interaction, between the, the teachers
there and the students and the teachers there and himself and other people
like him.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And was really disturbed with the, uh, mentality of the people there.
They treated him like, uh, he was one of the kids.  You know, they had their
little domain.  #I remember# --

B.56:  #Huh.#

A.57:  -- he brought up a story about how he needed a desk to set up the, uh, the
science fair project that he and this other guy worked up.  And they couldn't
find one anywhere and they found one in a room and the instructor there was
really possessive of it and wouldn't let him use it.

B.58:  Oh, you're kidding?

A.59:  Yeah [/clicking].  

B.60:  Well, then that goes to maybe not having the funds for things [/noise]
[/rustling],
