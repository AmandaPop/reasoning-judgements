A.1:  (( ))?

B.2:  #Yeah.#

A.3:  #Uh,# can you tell me what you think of capital punishment?

B.4:  Uh, I'm against capital punishment.  #Uh# --

@A.5:  #Uh-huh.#

B.6:  -- I, I guess there's a cliche that, uh, for every thousand of criminals
let free, if one innocent person is --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- uh, killed that that's a terrible thing for the #state# --

A.9:  #Uh-huh.#

B.10:  -- to be doing.  And I agree.  I, I remember watching a, a documentary film
a couple of years ago.  I've forgotten the name of it now.  But it was about a
killing in Texas --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- where somebody was sentenced, I think, it may have been just to life
imprisonment.  But in any event it --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- may have been capital punishment.  But, uh, this documentary,
documentarian or whatever you want to say, uh, he, uh, interviewed all the
parties involved and basically got [static] another person [laughter] to admit
that he had been the one who had committed the murder.  #I don't know (( )).#

A.15:  #Was that the# rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school?

B.16:  Uh, no I don't think so.  It was a, I don't remember the circumstances
actually.  #I, I just remember.#

A.17:  #There's something like,# something like that on SIXTY MINUTES about two
years ago [noise].

B.18:  No.  No.  This is documentary, uh, it was a, a, you know, released in
theaters.  I saw it on P B S finally I #guess.  Uh# --

A.19:  #Uh-huh.  Huh.#

B.20:  -- but any event, it was, it was very interesting and it, you know, I guess
[laughter] they say that you look for views in the media that support your own
[laughter].  And maybe, maybe that's the bias #(( )).#

A.21:  #I don't# find very many [laughter] that support #mine.#  

B.22:  #[Laughter]# Well, what's your perspective on capital punishment
[thumping]?

A.23:  Well, actually, I mean, not, not with regard to capital punishment.  I
mean, just in general.  #The media# --

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  -- uh, uh, they ta-, th-, the average person in the media is far more
liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so, uh, views
that are more conservative just (( )) represented in the mainstream media.
That's been documented by a number of studies.  But on capital punishment,
look, that's an exception [laughter].  I'm not conservative on that.  I'm sort
of middle of the road.  I, I lean against capital punishment but, uh, I
wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things, I
think.  I mean, I admit that some innocent people get killed and I believe
you're correct.  That has been documented.  It happens occasionally and it's
very, th-, th-, that's quite unfortunate.

B.26:  And there's also the factor that [static] th-, there's obviously racism in
terms of, even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of
crimes than there are represented in the overall population, they are also
convicted of capital crimes and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher
percentage than are represented even among criminals #so (( )) [/static].#

A.27:  #Huh.# Well, that last caller, actually, I, I, [laughter] this is the first
time I've ever spoken about a topic for the second time.  #But the# --

B.28:  #Oh, really.#

A.29:  -- last caller that I discussed it with didn't, didn't say, you know, even
that, even the, the fraction that would be represented among criminals are
convicted more often.  And, in fact, I just asked him the question.  Is it, is
it true that, isn't it true that minorities, you know, from pe-, in general
people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime #it,
so# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- wouldn't you expect them to be committed, to, to be convicted more
often?  Now I do think I recall seeing some statistics to, to the effect that,
that you, that you mentioned.  Uh, [inhaling] I don't know that, you know,
maybe it was a, a news report I heard or something, where I couldn't check it
out very carefully, where I couldn't, I, I, I always tend to read over these
things, you know.  Especially if you have an interest group that comes up with
a study that supports their own position #if they# --

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  -- did the work.  

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  I always tend to be a little suspicious #of it.#

B.36:  #I think,# 

A.37:  And that might have been the southern poverty law project or something that
did that.

B.38:  I don't know.

A.39:  And so I don't know whether I necessa-, [laughter] whether I want to give
credence to that without looking into it.  But I do remember hearing that.
Yeah [breathing].

B.40:  Uh-huh.  I think some bar associations, uh, a lot of bar associations are
against capital punishment and --

A.41:  Uh-huh. 

B.42:  -- uh, this is one area where perhaps they've done some of the work.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  #I'm not sure.#

A.45:  #Uh-huh.#  Yeah.  Well, I'm, I mean, I, I, I agree.  I think that, that the
problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable.  If you find out you
put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them out.  If you find out that
you, you killed somebody wrongly, there's nothing you can do to bring them
back to life.  So, so that's definitely a problem.  And, uh, you know, well
[laughter] we're supposed to talk about our state I guess, according to the
synopsis at the beginning.  #So North Carolina# --

B.46:  #Right.#

A.47:  -- has capital punishment.  Well if, if North Carolina didn't have capital
punishment, I wouldn't try and institute it.  It, it does have capital
punishment.  I don't see that it does any good.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  They might convict somebody wrongly sometime.  That's unfortunate.  But,
uh, [lipsmack] you know, fa-, the fortunate thing really is that, that it
occurs so rarely.  Uh, I think we have about, uh, maybe one execution or a
little bit less a year in North Carolina #now.  I# --

B.50:  #Is that so?#

A.51:  -- I know there's some states like, I think Texas is probably the leader in
the country.  I'm not sure of that.  But I think it may be.  Is that #right?#

B.52:  #I'm# not sure.  I think, I, that sounds right offhand.  But I'm not
positive.  I, I have only recently moved to Kentucky so I'm not even #sure# --

A.53:  #Uh-huh.#

B.54:  -- what Kentucky's law is.  My guess is it's probably legal but probably
similar to Carolina [static] that it's not used very frequently.

A.55:  Yeah.  I think that, that, you know, most southern states tend to have
capital punishment more than northern states.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  And a state like Minnesota, for example.  I don't know, but I'd be almost
sure that they don't have capital punishments.  #Wis-, Wisconsin# --

B.58:  #Right.#

A.59:  -- the same way.

B.60:  Right.  I was living in Illinois before here.  And I'm virtually certain
that they didn't have it.  Or if they did have it, it was never used
[/static].

A.61:  Uh-huh.
