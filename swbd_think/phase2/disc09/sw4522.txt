===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  No my father was in a nursing home.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  And I just, I really hope that I would just die --

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  -- be-, before and matter of fact, you know, I feel the same way for my
mother.

B.6:  How long ago was that?

A.7:  Uh, he was in the nursing home about four years ago.  But he was --

B.8:  Okay.

A.9:  -- you know, in there for several years.  

B.10:  Yes.  But that was, uh, okay.  So that was fairly recent.  And even then --

A.11:  Yes.

B.12:  -- a lot of the conditions, I think you're right.  They haven't improved
that much.  I-, 

A.13:  No they haven't.  And they, they, uh, the way they, the way the, uh, nurses
and the nurses aids ((and)) they treat them.

B.14:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

A.15:  #They# treat them, they treat them just utterly horrible.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  They cuss them.  They tell them how sorry they are.  And that they're, you
know, they, uh, one, uh, aid told him that he was no longer a man.

B.18:  Huh.

A.19:  You know, I mean, #good# --

B.20:  #Sounds# tough.

A.21:  -- you know, it's, it's, it's really, really bad.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And, and on, and on top of that I worked in a, I'm, I'm out of the
warehouse now.  But I worked in a warehouse in the company, for the company
that I'm working for now.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  And two of the women that were utterly horrible --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- worked, uh, in the nursing home.  Worked off and on for years in nursing
home.  And they hate old people.

B.28:  Oh, yeah.  That's --

A.29:  I-, 

B.30:  -- that doesn't [laughter] seem right does it?

A.31:  Yeah.  That's really, I'll say, you know, this really makes me feel good
about what's going #[laughter].#

B.32:  #Yeah.#  #I# --

A.33:  #But,# uh,

B.34:  -- you know, you walk into one of those places and you basically start to
feel depressed because they don't, a lot of places don't have a good
atmosphere.  They're ju-, it's almost like they just shove people in there and
wait for them to die --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- you know.  And it's, it's really, it's a bad problem.  Uh, I work at
Honeywell up here and I was talking to a guy that's actually working toward
mobility aids for handicap people and one of the things he's done is
interview, uh, nursing home directors.  Because they're looking for,
[laughter] get this, they're trying to find out ways to restrain patients so
that they don't look like they're restrained.  Because, apparently, the family
members who come to visit get upset, understandably upset when they see that
their loved one is in restraints, you know.  Uh, #at the same time# --

A.37:  #Oh, how horrible.#

B.38:  -- you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves.  They might
stand up and not be able to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever.

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  So it's an interesting problem.  That's just one of the many things that,
you know, you have to think about in a nursing home.

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  But, you know, the stuff that you told me is, there's no excuse for that,
you know.

A.43:  I know it.  There is no excuse.  That, uh, uh, you know, my, one thing you
really must do.  You know, I feel like that, go to a nursing home.  Drop in at
times that you don't normally drop in.

B.44:  Right.  Stop when they're not on their guard, you know.  

A.45:  Right.  And don't, uh, I, I would go visit a nursing home, uh, several
different times, several different nursing homes, before you came to the point
of having to put a family member in there.

B.46:  Oh, sure.  You know, it's, it's really a good idea to look at places and
see what's out there and see what th-, the modes of treatment are.

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  And, and how people act.  #(( )).#

A.49:  #Right.# It's, uh, it's, you, you, it's the same, it's the same premise as
daycare for a child.

B.50:  Yeah, you know.  It really is.  You know, that brings up a good point.
I've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his
father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And he brought up a real interesting suggestion that works well for
families that have a lot of kids in it.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Like I, I come from a family that has five kids.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  Well, the way he said it was, our parents spent, you know, quite a bit of
time when we were young, taking care of us, #you know.#

A.57:  #Certainly.#

B.58:  Call it, call it three years per child.  Now if you have five children,
that's fifteen years total.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  Therefore, shouldn't it be right that they should be able to stay with one
family member, uh, in a rotating fashion for fifteen years #free of charge.#

A.61:  #(( )).#  You dadgum right.  #If, you know,# 

B.62:  #There you go, it,# it's essentially repayment.

A.63:  Right.  If you, uh, if the, uh, parent and the children will do that.  

B.64:  Yeah.  #That's it.  But the thing is# -- 

A.65:  #But there's, ok-,# 

B.66:  -- hold on, I got one more #thing and I'll let# --

A.67:  #I'm sorry.#

B.68:  -- you talk [laughter].  Cause we started talking about that, you know.  We
started saying well, you know, some family members might not agree to do that.

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  And he said, fine.  Let the one who does agree to do it, keep him, keep the
f-, keep the father or mother for a longer time and charge the family member
who doesn't cooperate.  #Just# --

A.71:  #Ex-,# 

B.72:  -- say, basically, look, uh, I'll take care of mom and dad for you, but you
have to give me a kind of a payment for doing that for you.

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  You know.  So essentially it, it relieved them of the burden.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  Uh, and at the same time everybody kind of comes out happy.  I don't know
if that would work.  But then again, it, it depends on the family size.

A.77:  Right.  It may work with some families and it may not work at all with
#some families, you know.#

B.78:  #Yeah.  Uh-huh.#

A.79:  But, my Lord, you know, I had a, a,
