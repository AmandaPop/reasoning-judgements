==========================================================================

A.1:  Gun control.  Uh, well, I guess I'll go ahead and start off.  #Uh# --

@B.2:  #[TV] [talking] [child] Yeah.#

A.3:  -- I'm from Kansas originally.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  And, uh, in growing up, basically, uh, we all learned how to, uh, properly
handle guns and have #the proper# --

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  -- amount of respect for them.  You know, we did the hunter safety
training, and that kind of thing.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  Uh, and so, you know, I, I guess I really am not, uh, in favor of a lot of
restrictions on, on handguns.  Just cause, n-, at least the environment I grew
up in, uh --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- we're all taught in an early age to, to respect them and handle them
properly.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, unfortunately, most, I guess most people aren't.  Uh, and so that
presents kind of, a, a, a problem.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  Uh, funny, you know, some restrictions may be necessary, but, uh, you know
a total ban or something like that I think is #kind of,#

B.16:  #Out of the question.  Yeah.#

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  Yeah.  I, uh, I went through the same thing.  I, I, uh, you know, we do a
lot of hunting out here and stuff.  And, you know, rifles and stuff, we've
never had a problem with.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Handguns sometimes I wonder.  Cause, you know, what do you do with a
handgun?

A.21:  Right [laughter].

B.22:  I mean, you don't, you really, you can't hunt with it.  Uh, I mean, you
know, you, you can know how to treat them or, you know, how to, to use them
properly, but I just have a, you know, I don't think there ought to be a
outright ban.  But I think there ought to be some more restrictions on
handguns rather than rifles.

A.23:  Sure.

B.24:  Just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun.  It's easy for a kid
to get to it.  And, and, you know, hurt himself with a handgun.  I think more
so than even a rifle.

A.25:  Oh, yeah.  #Yeah.#

B.26:  #So, I,# yeah, I'm along with you there.  I just, I have real hard time
with handguns but, uh, like I say, I don't want anybody taking my rifles away
from #me [laughter].#

A.27:  #[Laughter] Exactly, exactly.#

B.28:  But, uh, yeah.  D-, did you hunt much {mispronounced} out there?  Or #in
Kansas?#

A.29:  #No, actually,# you know, I have never hunted.  #Uh, which# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- is the ironic thing.  #I've# --

B.32:  #Yeah.#

A.33:  -- done a lot of target shooting, #uh# --

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  -- you know, to, to get some skills.  But I've never actually #hunted.#  

B.36:  #Yeah.# Well, that, you know, really gets into that rights thing.  I mean
there's, there's a fine line I guess in everything.  And gun control is one
where, you know, if you could get some proper training and education, it's,
you know, I think you'd, you'd find that all th-, the accidents would
definitely go down.  And I, you know, I remember taking hunter safety and I
was like eleven or twelve years old.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.38:  #I mean# before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- you know, even though I wasn't hunting, I had to know how to handle a
gun and --

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  -- I, I think you're right though.  I-, you know, a lot of the inner cities
and stuff like that, they just don't get that kind of training.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  And, uh, and I, you know, I'm a, I, the only that I hate is, uh, well along
with that training is I, when kids have accidents with guns.  I, there's a lot
of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents
responsible for not making the gun safe.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And I think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious
and then #and, you know# --

A.47:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.48:  -- when they're five and six years old, accidents will happen.  That's why,
you know, they need to be locked up.  The ammunition kept separate and all
#kinds of stuff.#

A.49:  #Uh-huh.#  Exactly.  I mean a gun lock is cheap insurance --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- you know, uh --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- so I, I, I don't see any reason why a parent shouldn't do that.  

B.54:  Well, I mean, I don't, I have a real hard time with even keeping a, a
loaded weapon in my house.  #Uh, you know.#

A.55:  #Uh-huh.  Oh, definitely, I would.#

B.56:  You hear, you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off
letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal 
something --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- rather than take a chance, be the hero and get shot or #something.#

A.59:  #[Laughter].#

B.60:  I, you know, I just, there's nothing more valuable than life itself
#[laughter] so.#

A.61:  #Right, right.  Yeah.#

B.62:  But, yeah, I, I definitely, I, you know, was reading the article on, uh,
well on this Ross Perot.  You know, how he's talking about running for the
Presidency.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  And I guess he's a conservative, uh, you know, he's more of a Republican
politically, but he's got, he had some wild ideas about gun control.  I guess
he's really fo-, he's, he's for gun control #big time.#

A.65:  #Yeah, yeah.#  #((He, uh)),#

B.66:  #And he# was saying how he would go in for some, some unwarranted searches
and seizures of any guns that aren't registered.  And that really surprised
me.  I, like I say, I wouldn't want that to, to happen.

A.67:  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know, I mean, 

B.68:  [Baby].

A.69:  the guy seems l-, like a nice alternative but the problem is that, I mean,
at least for me, he's, uh, economically conservative which is good.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  But, uh, socially, he seems to be pretty liberal.  

B.72:  Yeah, yeah.

A.73:  Uh, which is not #my bent.#

B.74:  #(( )).#  #Yeah.  I understand he was pro, he# --

A.75:  #Uh, [laughter].#

B.76:  -- he was for, uh, abortion rights.

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  Uh, and I was really, like I say, it really surprised me because most of
those guys, I mean, from that, the conservative end, they are just, I mean,
gun control one hundred percent.  The N R A is their best friend and --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- the best lobbyist, so --

A.81:  Uh-huh [thumping].

B.82:  -- I was kind of surprised to see that.  But, you know, I think though on
the outside too, the N R A sometimes goes overboard, you know.

A.83:  Yeah.  I was just going to ask what you thought [laughter] about the N R A.
#Uh,# 

B.84:  #You# know, they're, I think they're like any lobbyist.  You've got
extremists on both ends, you know.  And they're saying that there's nothing
wrong with these assault rifles and this, that and the other, #you know.#

A.85:  #Uh-huh.#

B.86:  And, and handguns are just fine.  And I just think, you know, there's some
middle there to where, that they maybe go overboard.

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  And do too much.  They, I guess they do have a lot of lobbying pow-, power
and, you know, their big thing is well, if you, you stop banning one type,
then it's going to lead to the next and so on and [/TV] [/talking] [/child].

A.89:  Yeah.  The (( )),
