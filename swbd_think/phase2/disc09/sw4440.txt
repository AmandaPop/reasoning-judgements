===========================================================================

A.1:  [Music] Okay.  How do y-, do you have kids?

B.2:  [TV] Yeah, I have a twelve year old son and a fourteen year old daughter.

A.3:  Oh, they're just teenagers, huh?

B.4:  Right [laughter] #so, uh.# 

A.5:  #Almost [laughter].#

B.6:  So, it's, uh, an interesting experience for us.  But we're kind of lucky,
uh, in that regard because, uh, the church we belong to has a, a program that
they've had for quite a few years that they call family home evening [talking]
and that program is designed to, uh, bring the family together at least once a
week on Monday night.  So we, uh, I guess I could say religiously, [laughter]
dedicate Monday evening to doing just that [throat_clearing] [noise].  And
each, each week each one of us takes, uh, responsibility for that particular
Monday night.

@A.7:  Now, now do you find that, that's, uh, see how would I say that, do you
find that, uh, [sigh] that, #that it's# --

B.8:  #That it works?#

A.9:  -- well, I mean, it's, it's [lipsmack], 

B.10:  [Noise]. 

A.11:  you could do that on a, a Monday, do you find that it's easy to do that on
Monday nights #or is it?#

B.12:  #Uh-huh.# It, because it turns out that Monday night, of all of the other
nights of the week, generally is the one that has the least number of other
outside influences going on [noise] so we find that it works out quite well
and, uh, we actually look forward to it [laughter] cause we get to spend so
little time together otherwise.  And, uh, as I said, each one of us will plan,
uh, something for the particular Monday and it can be anything
[throat_clearing] because it is kind of a, a church sponsored thing, once in
awhile we'll have a, a religious lesson, maybe once a month, that alternates
amongst us.  But, uh, we might go to a movie or we might watch something here
or play a game or just sit and read or, uh, or whatever that individual feels
that they would like to do, that's what we do.

A.13:  Oh, that sounds pretty good.  #((Are))# --

B.14:  #Yeah [sniffing].#

A.15:  -- do you find that, that, uh, 

B.16:  [Sniffing].

A.17:  uh, I guess with us, I have, uh, four kids at home now and --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and, uh, 

B.20:  [Sniffing].

A.21:  let's see, [sigh] a si-, a five year old, a thirteen year old, uh, excuse
me, five, eleven, thirteen and seventeen.  And, uh, [lipsmack] Saturdays is a,
is, it's difficult to get everybody --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- organized and rounded up,

B.24:  [Talking].

A.25:  #uh# --

B.26:  #Right [laughter].#

A.27:  -- so they get the chores done and don't home in on the television
immediately --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- when they, they get up [inhaling].  Uh, actually, and during the school
nights, uh, the, we have a rule now that, that, uh, cause the kids are so
easily distracted #by the# --

B.30:  #Right# [throat_clearing].

A.31:  -- you know, uh, that, uh, no television --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- on school nights.  #And no,# 

B.34:  #Not at all# or until it's all done or,

A.35:  None at all.

B.36:  None at all.  That's, that's a good [laughter] but, uh, #that's a# -- 

A.37:  #[Laughter] It's# --

B.38:  -- good idea.

A.39:  -- well, they think it's draconian.  They think #it's terrible, you know.#

B.40:  #Right [laughter].#  It's hard to enforce, #I'm sure.#

A.41:  #Uh, well,# no it's not that hard to enforce.  It's just, uh, because --

B.42:  [Sniffing] Huh.

A.43:  -- if there's, you know, if it's, I found out that if, if, uh, if I let one
of them watch, pretty soon they'd all be watching.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  #That's right.#

A.45:  #So I, so I said,# 

B.46:  Including yourself #[laughter] yeah.#  

A.47:  #[Laughter].#

B.48:  Can't let yourself watch either.  That's work.

A.49:  Well, no television and no ball games.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And the reason no ball games is because the kids will stick their earphones
on and --

B.52:  Right [laughter].

A.53:  -- and listen to ball games and try and do their piano #believe it or not.#

B.54:  #We have another, uh,# another advantage to is that, uh, three of the four
of us are ham radio operators.

A.55:  Oh, is that, that's --

B.56:  Yeah.  #So# --

A.57:  -- #that's# a pretty good hobby isn't it.

B.58:  -- we have a, uh, a hobby in common and we can talk to one another over the
air too,

A.59:  [Talking] [clicking].

B.60:  and on many occasions and, a matter of fact, we're, my son and I are
watching the, the shuttle right now.  Uh, they've got four ham radio operators
on board the shuttle,

A.61:  [Clicking] [talking].  

B.62:  So we've been trying to make contact with them and it's, uh, it's headed
towards the D C area right now.

A.63:  Oh, is that right?  [Talking].

B.64:  [Talking] Yeah.  #Matter of fact# --

A.65:  #That's very nice.#

B.66:  -- it's, uh, it's over the horizon now.  

A.67:  Well now, that's kind, that's interesting to me because a lot of, you know,
in keeping on the, uh, the family thing here.

B.68:  #Uh-huh.#

A.69:  #The reason# that's interesting is because I've noticed that some families
have, uh, like the, the parent, I knew some ham --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and, uh, uh, there's a tendency and I, I think a lot of it depends on
the family for, like the ham to go in his, in his, uh, #room and shut the
door.#

B.72:  #Right.  ((In the ham shack, uh-huh)).#

A.73:  And (( )) and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded.

B.74:  Right.  And that's the last you ever see of him.  And, uh, [noise] --

A.75:  And tha-,

B.76:  -- and he speaks a totally different language.

A.77:  And the fact that and I read one time that, uh, there was a high divorce
rate in, in, uh, [inhaling] Cape Canaveral down there or #Cape# --

B.78:  #Uh-huh.#

A.79:  -- Kennedy or whatever you call it --

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  -- because the engineer would come home, go in his study, close the door
and that was it.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  And, uh, just kind of, an, autocrat.

B.84:  Huh.

A.85:  So the fact that you've got three participants in your family that, uh,
that do is, that's a credit to you.  What,

B.86:  [Talking].

A.87:  let's say, I guess my other question about, uh, uh, [lipsmack] when it
comes to, when they're on their own, [swallowing] you know, I mean if, if --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- if you have to go --

B.90:  Uh-huh [/TV].

A.91:  -- if you and your wife go someplace, what typically [/music],
