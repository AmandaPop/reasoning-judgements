REMARKS:        There is a humming noise on B's side.  I don't know if this
is on his phone line or maybe at his place of work.

=============================================================================

A.1:  So.  Have you heard about Saturns?

@B.2:  [Swallowing] [hum] [breathing] {he seems to be out of breath} I've heard
some about Saturns.  I don't know [inhaling] a lot about them.  I haven't been
over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in
tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to
that of the, I guess, the Japanese cars.

A.3:  Ooh, that's great.  Actually that's kind of the type of car that I, I'm
thinking about we might get.  Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go
to a, a Saturn dealer.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  This, this offshoot of G M [thumping].

B.6:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.7:  And, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer [sniffing] satisfaction
from what things I've heard.

B.8:  Um.  Yeah, I've heard a lot of people like them.  Uh, yet I don't know wh-,
whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point.  I'm kind of, my card and,
uh, desires tend to be pretty picky and so, uh.

A.9:  Well, like what?

B.10:  Well, let's see.  I li-, I like cars that are designed with, with human
beings in mind,

A.11:  [Thumping].

B.12:  and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person
whose working on it, cause I do al-, almost all my own maintenance #and, 
uh# --

A.13:  #((Uh-huh)).#

B.14:  -- those types of things.  And I found that while you can find some cars
that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a ca-, car anymore that's, that's
fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very eas-, it's not very, almost
unlikely at this point.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  And, uh, yo-, 

A.17:  Yeah.  I've got a sixty-five Mustang #and# --

B.18:  #Ooh.#

A.19:  -- I, and I do the work on, most of the work on that myself.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that, I just say I will never
do that with the modern cars.  It's not worth my time.  You can't get in
there.  You can't do anything.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And it's so complicated too.  I look at it and I say, boy, you know, I, I'd
have to almost go take a class or something like that.

B.24:  [Laughter] Well I've got an eighty-three Saab.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And I find that for a normal, you know, everyday things.  It's really very
easy to work on and so, uh, you know, I'm kind of spoiled.  I used to have a
(( )) Chevy.

A.27:  #Uh-huh.#

B.28:  #With a# three fifty in it.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And, uh, I really liked working on it.  Uh, cause it was pretty easy too.
It was about a nineteen seventy.  So I'm kind of, uh, biased in that and, you
know, I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much
even to get the oil changed anymore.

A.31:  Yeah [thumping].  

B.32:  And that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at.  I think
another thing I'd look at is safety.

A.33:  Yeah.  That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about.
Actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new
ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that
have #dual# --

B.34:  #Huh.#

A.35:  -- side air bags.

B.36:  That's a real nice car, I think.

A.37:  Yeah [clicking].

B.38:  I've driven some, uh, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been
on business trips.

A.39:  Uh-huh [thumping].

B.40:  Uh, as rental cars.  And I've always been very impressed [swallowing] with
the Taurus.  It's a really nice car.  I think it's very [inhaling], it's a
stylish car both inside and out.  It's comfortable to drive.  Uh, reasonable
performance, and this is out in California where, [laughter] where they don't
make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Uh, I've been real impressed with that.  Yo-, and I didn't realize that
they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that #car now.#

A.43:  #Ninety, yeah.#  Or, excuse me, the ninety-twos.  #The# --

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#

A.45:  -- ninety-twos had dual air bags.  This newest model.  #You could# --

B.46:  #((Oh, I think that)),# 

A.47:  -- get them with duals [thumping].  

B.48:  That's excellent.  That's excellent #because,# 

A.49:  #Yeah.# But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars.  Actually, my,
my wife and I are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the
next year and a half or so.  So we're #actually# --

B.50:  #Oh.#

A.51:  -- been looking around and thinking about things.  We'd like to get like a
[whistling] oh, I don't know.  What do you call it?  A dealer return type
thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Year old ninety-two or something like that.  

B.54:  Uh-huh.  Sure.  #Those are# --

A.55:  #See if we,# 

B.56:  -- yeah, that, that would be a good deal to go with.  

A.57:  And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns #too.#

B.58:  #Okay.#

A.59:  Because they looked really nice.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  What do you, what do you looking for in, in those?  What, what
attracts you to the Saturns?  Or, or, of course, we've already talked, you
know, the Taurus is safe.  But wh-, what kind of things are you #looking for?#

A.61:  #Well, the# Saturns you can get air bags in them.  I don't think you can
get dual side air bags.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  But one of the, the two things that [thumping] I'm really, the, the I'd say
the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart.  That
doesn't have problems.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  You set down.  You look at consumer reports.  We've been pouring over
consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the U S auto --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- makers when you do that.  Because you see the reliability and the types
of problems they have and, [talking] and the two cars that apparently are
close to that.  That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the
highest U S cars.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  And the other one is, [thumping] are the Saturns.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  So those two things.  And then, you know, [sigh] we kind of want a four
door.

B.72:  Okay [/hum] [/breathing].
