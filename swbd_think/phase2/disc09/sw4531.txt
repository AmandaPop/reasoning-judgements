============================================================================

A.1:  sort of music do you like?

@B.2:  [Laughter] Well, being from Texas I love country music.  #That's,#

A.3:  #Oh,# I do too.

B.4:  You do?  #Uh.#

A.5:  #Yeah.  I'm# a Garth Brooks fan.  

B.6:  Oh, absolutely.

A.7:  My kids make fun of me though #[laughter].#

B.8:  #Do they really?  [Laughter].#

A.9:  [Laughter] (( )) the weirdo with the hat #[laughter].#

B.10:  #[Laughter]# Well, you, you don't sound, like, uh,

A.11:  [Talking].

B.12:  from New York [thumping].

A.13:  Oh, actually, I'm from Bronx, New York.  That's as New York as you, you can
get #[laughter].#

B.14:  #Oh, my.# Well, someone called me the other day from, uh, New Jersey.  And
that was, whoa [laughter].

A.15:  Well, actually, I'm in Long Island now.  #But# --

B.16:  #Huh [thumping] [rustling].#

A.17:  -- Bronx is one of the five boroughs that make up New York City and New
York City is what most people think of as New York.

B.18:  I see.

A.19:  But, anyway.

B.20:  Uh, do many people listen to country music?  

A.21:  I think it's growing.  It's getting more popular.  I think, well I was born
in nineteen fifty so --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- i-, uh, I think the people who were into rock and roll are getting real
upset with this rap stuff.

B.24:  Yes!  #Yes.#

A.25:  #And,# 

B.26:  I don't particularly care for that.

A.27:  Oh, that's one thing I just can't stand #[laughter].#

B.28:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.29:  And I think [talking] you know, there's not much rock and roll anymore.
There's a lot of head banging music and --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and the country has a nice beat and some nice words and it's mellow.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  [Talking].  

B.34:  Well country music is not that sad,

A.35:  [Talking].

B.36:  kind of cry in your beer ex-, you know, the expression, kind of music.
It's got a l-, a lot better uplifting beat [noise] now and it sounds better.
And I think more people, all generations, like it a lot better.

A.37:  Well, I, you know, I substitute teach in, uh, my s-, my local school
district and the high school had country music day.  They have this big
hallway where the kids can hang out after they've had their lunch.  And there
was a lady with cowboy boots #and she h-,#

B.38:  #[Laughter].#

A.39:  there was a fellow with a whole black outfit on and a little scarf around
his neck and cowboy boots.  And they had a, you know, one of these, we call
them ghetto blasters.  #One of those big# --

B.40:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.41:  -- you know, music boxes #going# --

B.42:  #Uh-huh [noise] {sounds like running water}.#

A.43:  -- with some country western stuff.  And they were like kidding around with
the, the teenagers trying to get them on the dance floor.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  And the, the dancing wasn't all that easy.  There's a lot of steps to it
#[laughter].#

B.46:  #[Laughter] [/noise].#

A.47:  And a couple of the kids were joining in.  Some of them felt totally
foolish, but,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  yeah, it's going around.

B.50:  Definitely.  

A.51:  I, I don't know if it's getting to the youth though #[laughter].#  

B.52:  #[Thumping] [laughter].# Well, I think that's, gosh, that is about the only
thing that I [thumping] listen to.  I'm originally from Tennessee and, of
course, that's a big country music place too and that's all I heard growing
up.

A.53:  Oh.

B.54:  So, uh, you know, that's, that's, golly, that's big and popular.

A.55:  ((Well,)) seeing somebody's always in love or #somebody's# --

B.56:  #Yeah.#

A.57:  -- always been cheated on #[laughter].#

B.58:  #Crying, loving or leaving# #[laughter].#

A.59:  #Oh, is that it?#  #[Laughter].# 

B.60:  #That's it.# And on the radio that's how they, they have a little segment,
Crying, Loving and Leaving.  If you think about it, every song is like that.
#Just like you're saying [laughter].#

A.61:  #[Laughter]#  Are you a western dancer too?  

B.62:  Well, uh, I can, I can.  I don't, uh, we don't smoke so we really don't go
to bars or anything.  But, but, uh, used to, you know, back in the single
days.  Uh, but, yeah, I can.

A.63:  #Huh.#

B.64:  #How# about you?

A.65:  Well, you know, it's something you can't fake the way you could just #r-,
wiggle to# --

B.66:  #Oh.#

A.67:  -- rock and roll.  #You really do know# --

B.68:  #For sure.#

A.69:  -- the steps though [laughter].

B.70:  That is true.  That is absolutely true.  Or you're going to make a fool out
of yourself #or trip# --

A.71:  #Yeah.#

B.72:  -- over somebody's feet #[laughter].#

A.73:  #[Laughter]#  Is there any other kind of music you like?

B.74:  Uh, you know, I really, I like like, uh, the seventies music.  And, uh,
oldies music [noise] {water}, fifties, sixties, that type of music [sniffing].
Uh, I run.  And I like to run, just various music.  Either, either like
seventies music or country or, uh, or the oldies.

A.75:  Uh, yeah.  Well, the, the top forty kind of stuff is ve-, I work out in the
gym and we listen to that.  Because you need a driving beat to keep you moving
#I think.#

B.76:  #Oh, absolutely.# Yeah.  And, uh, you know, I, that's what I have gotten
away from.  Is what, like the top forty stuff is.  #I# --

A.77:  #Huh.#

B.78:  -- don't, I couldn't hardly, I couldn't tell you right now what the top one
or two songs are.

A.79:  I guess I'm thinking of the old top forties.  I'm thinking of the Rolling
Stones, you know #[laughter].#

B.80:  #Oh.  Yeah, yeah,# yeah.  Absolutely.  #Foreigner and Santana and all that.
In fact, I was# --

A.81:  #[Laughter] Right.#

B.82:  -- listening to that on my way home today.  But, uh, I, I enjoy that type
of #music.#

A.83:  #Well,# [talking] I have a fourteen year old son and he's playing stuff by,
uh, who is it?  [Talking] No, not Guns and Roses [laughter].  He's in the back
#saying Guns and Roses [laughter].#

B.84:  #Oh, Guns and Roses [laughter].#

A.85:  #No, not that.#

B.86:  #Now I have heard of them.#

A.87:  #[Laughter].#

B.88:  #[Laughter].#

A.89:  No, but he's, he's playing, uh, TOMMY, THE PINBALL WIZARD #and that.  
That# --

B.90:  #Oh, yeah.  The Who.#

A.91:  -- that's old stuff.

B.92:  It is old.

A.93:  And the kids are into it [talking].

B.94:  Isn't that funny.

A.95:  Yeah.  They seem to be #enjoying it.#  

B.96:  #But it does,# yeah, it's kind of like making a comeback.  It's just
cyclable and just kind of making a comeback now, I guess.  And that's what
they enjoy hearing [sniffing].  Which that's funny #[laughter].#

A.97:  #[Laughter].#

B.98:  Cause I was, let's see you were born in fifty.  I was born in fifty-nine
so, you know, when I was in high school that's, some of this kind of music was
popular and that's what I like hear-, to hear right now even.

A.99:  Do you play any instruments?

B.100:  Uh, well.  I was in band in high school.  And I played clarinet.  Then I
took piano lessons.
