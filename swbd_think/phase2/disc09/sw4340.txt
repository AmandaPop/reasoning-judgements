=======================================================================

A.1:  What kind of crime do you think, uh, is the most prevalent in our society?

B.2:  Oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.

A.3:  Such as New York City [laughter]?

B.4:  [Laughter] Is that what happens up there a lot?  Uh, th-, that, that's
mostly what I hear, ((though)), is people getting ripped off and things
getting stolen.  That's the most prevalent crime.  Uh, the ones that really,
you know, the ones that really add up after a while, I guess, you know, from,
s-, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.  You know,
everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually.

A.5:  Yeah, I, I, I wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though,
because, I mean, so many people use it, and even though just using is not
really, I mean it is a crime,

B.6:  Oh, well, yeah, that, that, that is a crime.  I guess, uh, when you, when
you count all the little things that people do like, uh, speeding is a crime
[laughter].

A.7:  Well, that's true.  

B.8:  I break that law every day [laughter].  

A.9:  But I was, I, I was staying in the realm of, of felonies versus
misdemeanors --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- and, uh, drug use, well, actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor,
but, uh, what kind, what kind, have you been, uh, have you been the subject of
such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?

B.12:  Well, I've, uh, I've been caught with marijuana before, so I guess that was
a crime.  I got a year's probation for that, but, uh,

A.13:  That, that's not that much.  I mean -- 

B.14:  No, it wasn't that -- 

A.15:  -- #you know, those aren't,# 

B.16:  -- #big a deal.#  

A.17:  I,

B.18:  Uh, when I think of crime, I think of stuff that, that affects other people
like people getting, you know, killed or raped.  I think rape is one of the
worst crimes [laughter].

A.19:  Yeah, I think it is.  I, in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.

B.20:  Yeah, it's very degrading -- 

A.21:  Uh,   

B.22:  -- and,   

A.23:  Murder, murder is, is hard on the people that were related to --

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  -- you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution, ((though)) [laughter].

B.26:  Yeah, right, once, once a person's, you know, gone, then it's, [laughter]
but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life,
you know.

A.27:  Yes.  What, what do you think is, uh, is an appropriate, uh, punishment for
some of the various, you know, such as, things such as rape or, or, uh, murder
--

B.28:  Well -- 

A.29:  -- or something like that.  

B.30:  -- for, for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death
penalty is, it's a [breathing] pretty good thing.

A.31:  I agree with that.  

B.32:  They, they have that down here in Florida still.  They the electric chair
and, uh, 

A.33:  Yeah, I think Virginia does, too, up here.  

B.34:  Oh, do they?  Yeah, I think, I think that's still an appropriate penalty to
pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy and, I guess usually
they're, they're always sure they [laughter] got the right guy, but, uh,

A.35:  Yeah, I think the appeal process takes too long.  

B.36:  Yeah, so do I.  

A.37:  I think, I, I think it should take, from conviction to execution should
take no longer than a year.

B.38:  Yeah, i-, if that.  You know, the sooner, a, a, a year's plenty of time --

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- you know, for something to come out, I guess.  Then, you know, there's
been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and
they [laughter], it's like oops, [laughter].  But,

A.41:  Well, yeah, I mean, the system isn't perfect, I mean, it's run by a bunch
of imperfect humans.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  You do the best you can to make it perfect, you know, you, you go out of
your way to try real hard to make it perfect.

B.44:  Right.  

A.45:  But, I think you have to accept some of the errors.  I think that murder
itself would decrease significantly if, if there was a credible punishment,
uh, for murderers.

B.46:  Um, yeah, I don't know if it would or not though.  I, I don't think it's a,
so much of a deterrent as, as it is a, a good, uh, a good way for vengeance,
you know, for the relatives and, and family members, you know what I mean?

A.47:  And society probably, too.  

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  I mean, just general society to, 

B.50:  Yeah, it kind of gets -- 

A.51:  Uh,

B.52:  -- it off their chest.  

A.53:  Yeah, it does and, and it decreases the prison population.  

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  And, which is -- 

B.56:  Yeah, I know that -- 

A.57:  -- significant -- 

B.58:  -- a, a lot of the -- 

A.59:  -- I mean,

B.60:  -- lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other.  And
they're --

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  -- the, kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.  I don't think
you'll ever stop all that stuff dead, but, I, y-, y-, you might be able to,
uh, stop people, you know, they're thinking about it, they know they're going
to get the chair if they get caught.

A.63:  Yeah, generally the crimes of passion and things like that, uh, are not
premeditated.

B.64:  Right.  

A.65:  I mean, they can be, but usually they aren't.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  They're spur of the moment -- 

B.68:  That's right.  

A.69:  -- and, uh, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and
plans, when you catch those, those individuals, I think that you, you end up
with a, uh, uh, how do I want to, you end up with a s-, you end up with
someone who's more dangerous to society --

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  -- because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.

B.72:  Yeah, they could p-, probably do it again.   

A.73:  Yes, they, they would have no problems doing it again.  

B.74:  That's right, they didn't have any time doing it the first time.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do
a, any good because --

B.76:  No, it do-,

A.77:  -- as a, as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,
