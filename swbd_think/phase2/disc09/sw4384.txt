============================================================

A.1:  [clicking] The only experience I have, I don't have any children but I've, uh,
I was a baby-sitter in high school.  And then, just recently, after we were
married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked.  And I just, #uh# ...

B.2:  #[talking] Yeah.# That's the only thing I've ever done also, #is baby-sit.#

A.3:  #Is it?#  {Very faint}.

B.4:  But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child
care.  Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers.

A.5:  Oh, yeah.  #The expense.#

B.6:  #Yeah.  Having# to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock or it's five
dollars for every minute you're late.  And stuff like that [sniffing].

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Which is understandable.  I mean, these people can't, you know, #stay there
till eight o'clock# --

A.9:  #Just sit around [laughter].  That# --

B.10:  -- because somebody has to work late but [sniffing].

A.11:  -- that's true.  See the lady I did it for, that's why she picked me is
because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl
up.  So she could sleep in.  And, uh, then she could be at home and then I'd
bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.  But,
uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three
dollars a hour and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like
eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or --

B.12:  Oh, no.

A.13:  -- gas or anything.  

B.14:  Yeah.  It's hardly worth your time.  

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.  The only time I baby-sat was in high school and
it, you know, of course you don't ha-, I didn't pay taxes on that, #so.#

A.17:  #Right.#

B.18:  It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh, it was these people that lived
in our neighborhood and I'd just go over there.  Every Thursday night, they
went to the theater.  They had permanent tickets and they'd give me, it was
supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids, but they would usually give
me like five dollars more #at the end of the night.#

A.19:  #Oh, wow.#

B.20:  And, I mean, they'd, you know, it was great.  I'd go over there and there
would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over #here.
Watch,#

A.21:  #[laughter].#

B.22:  whatever you want.  And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard.  And
there's some Coke and you know, just help yourself to anything.  #So# --

A.23:  #Wow.#

B.24:  -- it was, it was, you know, the best, that was a long time ago and that
was only for a few years.  Just #once a week.#

A.25:  #Yeah.#

B.26:  But [lipsmack] I don't know.

A.27:  I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better
baby-sitters.

B.28:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  

A.29:  And they stick around for longer.  Because I mean after I figured out I was
getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it.  And I quit [laughter], you know.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  I was just like but I'm wasting my time.   

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  [swallowing] I really liked the little girl and everything but I 
thought ...

B.34:  She does take up, and they do take up a lot of your time.  That ...

A.35:  Yeah.  #Yeah, I# ...

B.36:  #They're# very demanding [laughter].

A.37:  [laughter] #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  #[laughter]# [barking].

A.39:  Well, and she was really spoiled.  They didn't make her eat anything she
didn't want or anything.  So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast
and lunch.

B.40:  [laughter].

A.41:  And the mom was a dentist and I was just like, we've got to quit this.  And
she's like no I don't want her to starve.  But I don't want to make her eat
something she doesn't want to eat [laughter].

B.42:  Oh, shoot.  My mom --

A.43:  ((Like)).

B.44:  -- would be like, uh --

A.45:  [laughter] Eat this or #[laughter].#

B.46:  -- #eat it or don't eat anything.  That's right.#

A.47:  So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.  

B.48:  #Yeah.#

A.49:  #Because# some, I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there
would be so many needs you would have to #customize# --

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  -- your service to.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Cause some parents [noise] won't put up anything.  Where others would.

B.54:  I think, yeah, I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to
do it out of your basement.

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  #And just# have like t-, at the most, like ten kids.  And all from maybe
people that you #know# --

A.57:  #No.#

B.58:  -- type of thing.  Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you
don't know the people coming in and ...

A.59:  That's true.  I, I'd love to do it.  But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...

B.62:  More than what it's worth?

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  It would scare me.  With, I don't know, cause I'm sure some of them have
good reason to sue but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're
negligent and they get happy about money and --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- they just want to sue you.  

B.68:  Well, yeah.  That's, yeah, exactly.  When you have like a Kindercare or
something set up --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and th-, when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe
one assistant to twenty kids #or something#

A.71:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.72:  And that's just, you know, #you can't watch# --

A.73:  #That's impossible.#

B.74:  -- that many little kids getting into things at one time [sniffing].  You
know, you never know what they're going to get into.

A.75:  I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare and she takes her little girl
with her and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire and
half of them she'd like to turn them into the state [laughter].  And that's
the people that are working there, you know.  And then she would like to turn
in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the
kids are in, you know.

B.76:  Oh, that's #horrible.#

A.77:  #Like# they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same
diaper.

B.78:  Huh.

A.79:  You know, just awful things.  And [swallowing] so I don't know.  I don't
have kids but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
#I mean, you just don't know.#

B.80:  #Yeah.  That's i-, yeah,# that's a hard thing about it.  If, I mean, I
don-, I can't foresee myself getting married but if, you know, if I ever
wanted to have a kid, how could I work.  I mean, I don't think I #could trust
somebody with my kid either.  Unless it# --

A.81:  #Oh, yeah.  That's true.#

B.82:  -- was a friend that, you know, did it in [hum] {sounds like an airplane}
their house that I knew well.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.

A.85:  It would just rip me apart, I think [clink].  I don't know.  

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Just #not knowing.#

B.88:  #Yeah,# just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets
out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait.
