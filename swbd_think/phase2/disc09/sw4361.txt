B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  So, what do you think?

B.3:  Well, that's a pretty loaded topic #[laughter].#

A.4:  #[Laughter]# Absolutely.

B.5:  [Barking] Well here in, uh, hang on just a second, the dog is barking.
Here in Oklahoma we just went through a, uh, major educational reform.
#We're, uh# --

@A.6:  #Uh-huh.#

B.7:  -- that was a hot topic.  Uh, part of the problem had been, there wasn't
enough spent on education.  The classes were too large.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  And we recently, well we're, we're through a proposition now where they're
limiting class size to about twenty-two, I think.

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  And they've increased salaries and, just done a major #revision.#

A.12:  #Yeah.#  Are your, uh, schools paid for primarily with a real estate tax?

B.13:  Yes.  #Yes, just about all.#

A.14:  #Yeah.  What, for a# typical middle class house, uh, what kind of annual
tax do you pay?

B.15:  [Sigh] Oh, well, actually, (( )) actually, it isn't just (( )) I said yes
and it really isn't [/barking].

A.16:  Well, I know it's sp-, #federal and (( )).#

B.17:  #We also# well no we have a, uh, an excise tax on cars.  #Our# --

A.18:  #Uh-huh.#

B.19:  -- car tags are very expensive.  

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  Average taxes are very low on real estate.

A.22:  They are.

B.23:  Probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range.

A.24:  Oh, okay, okay.  Cause, uh, over here, um, you could pay between four and
eight thousand dollars a year.

B.25:  Right.

A.26:  And, uh, [lipsmack] I'd be surprised if we're getting something that was
ten times as good as what you're getting.

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  As a matter of fact, I'll bet it's not as good.  

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  Uh, my feeling is that there, you know, while there are certain problems
where, you know, being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of
equipment may be valuable, by and large that correlation between the amount of
money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that
strong.

B.31:  [Sigh] Yeah.  I, I do have to tend to agree with you.  The only other
problem with that is that it's difficult to attract people into the teaching
profession.

A.32:  Well, again, I don't know what it's like on your side of the fence.  

B.33:  Huh.

A.34:  Uh, over here, uh, teachers' salaries aren't bad.  Uh, they're not
executive type salaries.  Although if you're a teacher whose been at it for
fifteen, twenty years, uh, you can retire, a-, a-, a-, when you, when you
reach the top level it's not bad at all.  It's quite good.

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  #Uh,# 

B.37:  #Yeah,# I think that's, that's the other thing here.  The benefits are
[clicking] very good --

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  -- for teachers.  Where,

A.40:  The thing is there are nonfinancial b-, there should be nonfinancial
benefits to teaching that I think we've managed to squash out of the system.
Uh, it used to be, thirty years ago, being a teacher was a, uh, position of
respect.

B.41:  Right.

A.42:  You were educating the young.  Uh, now it seems, you know, now the, the
joke of the year is, you know, those who can't teach.

B.43:  Right.

A.44:  And, uh, you know, so something went wrong somewhere along the line.  I
think it's felt, both by the people in the educational profession and those
outside.  There's a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray called IN
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  And he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system.  And,
uh, he even offers some suggestions for improvements.  Uh, one of the points
he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems, uh, whatever the
nature of the reform is, the administration of the reform will be captured by
Union and rendered ineffective.

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  In other words if you decide that you're going to pump another ten percent,

B.49:  [Popping].

A.50:  money in, it will (( )) eventually filter down, it filters it's way around
to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level.
Uh, if you provide other benefits, they'll eventually work their way around to
more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them.  I'm not sure I agree
with him completely but he makes some interesting points.

B.51:  Yeah, that does.  I, I think though you hit the, the nail on the head
[clicking] when you, when you said it's the attitude more than anything --

A.52:  Huh.

B.53:  -- of the teacher profession [/popping].

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  The teaching profession.  Uh, and that, that's something you really can't
change even with money.

A.56:  Well, it did change.  The thing to do is find out, uh, why.  Uh, cause, uh,
you know, there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual 
#and# --

B.57:  #Uh-huh.#

A.58:  -- something changed.  Uh, and in, intrinsically, the idea of, you know,
uh, training our, the youth of the country to be, uh, mature, productive,
responsible citizens is potentially a, uh, a very, uh, what's the right word?
Uh, [sigh] it's potentially a very re-, not rewarding but, uh, it should be a
respected profession.

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  So the question (( )) ask is not what, w-, w-, why isn't it, but well it
should be what's preventing it from being #respected.#

B.61:  #Right.#  Right.

A.62:  Now,

B.63:  It's a, it's a pretty big responsibility #I mean to, to teach.#

A.64:  #Absolutely, absolutely.#  I have a wife who substitute teaches.

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  And, uh, she brings home some interesting stories.  Uh, but the thing that,
you know, I, I hate falling into the trap of back when I was kid, uh,
[laughter] (( )) saying that --

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  -- but the thing that changed is, uh, back when I was a kid, you know,
maybe hated the teacher, maybe you didn't do your work, but you respected or
at least feared the,
