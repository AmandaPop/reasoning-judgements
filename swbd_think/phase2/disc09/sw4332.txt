=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, I guess there's a lot of, uh, complex issues here, some of which are
moral and some are, uh, [lipsmack] more logistical as to the merits of
capital punishment.  I suppose the, uh, the moral ones are [breathing], are
the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones, I
guess, are, uh, I suppose a reasonable default on, uh, issues, the moral issue
would be just let everybody live and not, uh, not try and make those kind of
judgmental errors, but goes and affects the logistical ones in that now you
have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to.  I suppose that
might actually be a, uh, pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it, though.

B.2:  Uh, yeah, I guess it has to do with, uh, what, anger, revenge,

A.3:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.4:  Uh, what human life is worth -- 

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  -- and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody.  

A.7:  Yeah, those are all good ones.  I suppose, uh, another one is, uh, if you
do decide that it's, uh, you know, you want to do this, is somebody capable of
making the judgment rationally, you know, do we have the, uh, do we really
have that ability to go out and judge somebody's crime.  All these
circumstances --

B.8:  You mean, do we have -- 

A.9:  -- and other stuff and weigh it.  

B.10:  -- the right or, are you talking logistical here?  

A.11:  Can we really do it?  Are we, are we that good that we can really do it.
It's like, uh, like nuclear power plants, you know, it's a great idea, but
logistically, we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to,

B.12:  Well, that's, I think you can take that nice simple, nice simple
[laughter], nice problematical logistical argument and say, well, are you
morally able to make a mistake, you know, what, what is, uh, is it all right
to guess wrong once in a while.

A.13:  Um, yeah, yeah.  

B.14:  And if -- 

A.15:  Yeah, exactly.  

B.16:  -- it's, if it's not acceptable to ever make a mistake, you know, ever
sentence somebody to death that shouldn't be, then, uh, you can't use the
death penalty.

A.17:  Yeah, or shouldn't -- 

B.18:  Well,

A.19:  -- shouldn't be using it.  

B.20:  Yeah, okay.  

A.21:  There's a lot of can'ts and should nots and don'ts and stuff that seem to
be pretty well ignored these days.  [inhaling] Uh [breathing],

B.22:  So, what are they doing down in, uh, Georgia?  

A.23:  [Laughter] Well, ((Evan)), uh, I suppose they do have the death penalty
down here.  I don't know if, uh, if they executed anybody on it recently.  I
don't think so.  Uh, I don't know, you know, it's gotten to the point where,
something like that, if I see it in the paper or hear about it, it's just kind
of like in one ear and out the other.  Some state recently executed somebody.
Where was that, Texas?

B.24:  Oh, [throat_clearing] I haven't heard about any lately.  Uh, Florida was
doing a few, weren't they?

A.25:  Yeah.  What kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for?

B.26:  Uh,   

A.27:  Murders, big murders.  

B.28:  Yeah, usual, serial killers or -- 

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- multiple murders like if, uh, you know, somebody kills a family or,

A.31:  Yeah, what did they, uh, give Jeffrey Dahlmer?  What did they do to him?

B.32:  Didn't they lock him away in a, uh, psychological ward?  

A.33:  Uh, that ((would)) make too much -- 

B.34:  No -- 

A.35:  -- sense.  

B.36:  -- no, they didn't, they didn't, they just l-, sent him to prison.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  That's right.  

A.39:  Yeah, seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody
that was so rare.  Something kind of wasteful.  [lipsmack] Not that, uh, not
that we need more or anything like that.

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  [Laughter] Yeah, that was a bizarre case.  And I g-, are they, did the
government, federal government pass some recent, uh, regulation, something
about for c-, certain crimes, uh, if, uh, there's a gun involved or something
like that, the death penalty is automatic or, is there something like that out
there?

B.42:  Uh, well, there's something like that and there's always proposals to, uh,
make punishment nastier.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  You know, or whenever somebody gets off lightly, somebody visible gets off
lightly --

A.45:  Yeah, there's some real,

B.46:  -- they, you know, the judge has, what, like a range of sentences he can
give, like three to ten.

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  And he,   

A.49:  They're, they're often does seem to be backlash against light things.  I
guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff.  One harsh sentence that I
kind of liked was, uh, Jim Bakker getting forty-five years.  That's, that
seemed like justice, but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced
him or something like that.  I don't know if they changed it.

B.50:  Yeah, there's a general impression that, uh, these snakes get off
eventually, uh, like Klaus Von Bulow

A.51:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.52:  [Laughter] Who will, I guess,
