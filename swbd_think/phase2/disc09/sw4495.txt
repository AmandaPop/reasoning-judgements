==========================================================================

A.1:  I haven't done any camping lately.  How about you?

@B.2:  Oh, not recently.  We, we've done a little bit of car camping [breathing]
uh, since, since I got married and did a little bit of backpacking several
years ago.  But, uh, not recently.

A.3:  Were these extended trips or just a weekend or,

B.4:  Well [breathing] not real long.  Maybe three or four days at the most.  How
about you?

A.5:  Uh, that's about what I've done.  But it goes back even further to my
childhood.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Camping, went out camping a-, a-, the purpose was not to camp.  The purpose
was to fish.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And there were no motels in, in the [laughter] wilds of New Mexico
[laughter].  So if you wanted to go fish for a few days, you would, uh, and at
certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track, you would do what
you, I think what you call car camping.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  I mean the car's there and, and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside
of it or inside the car or, but, uh, nothing too elaborate #in# --

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#

A.13:  -- the way of tents and, {pause} I've actually even slept on the ground
[laughter].

B.14:  Yeah.  Well, I've done a little bit of that too.  Uh, I guess I've kind of
done the full range of camping.  Anywhere from backpacking in the mountains to
[sigh], for a week at a time, to the car camping kind of thing.

A.15:  Where did you do your backpacking?

B.16:  Well, I've done some down in, uh, Tennessee and Kentucky, that area.  North
Carolina and then done some in New Mexico and some out in Montana, Colorado.
So I've kind of gone around and done it in a number of places.

A.17:  But this was in years past or,

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  I used to work at, uh, summer camps a, a lot when I was in high school and
college.  And I worked at some summer camps in New Mexico or, uh, the emphasis
there was on backpacking #exclusively.#

A.21:  #(( )).#  Around Philmont or something.

B.22:  Right.  #Uh-huh.#

A.23:  #[Laughter].#

B.24:  You've been there?

A.25:  No.  I haven't.  #No.#

B.26:  #Uh-huh.#

A.27:  But every boy scout I've ever known has camped at Philmont [laughter].

B.28:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a very popular place.  And I worked there [inhaling]
three summers so [sigh] got to know it pretty well.

A.29:  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know, do you think, i-, it's as safe as it used to
be to go camping.

B.30:  Well, probably the biggest concern that I would have now is getting safe
drinking water.  Uh, cause a lot of times, we'd just pull water out of a
stream and, uh, use that.  And I was never really big on using a lot of
chemicals for water purification and treatment.  Uh, and nowadays I think I'd
be a little bit more cautious about that than I used to be.

A.31:  Yeah.  When, when I was in, growing up in New Mexico, if we went on a
picnic or whatever, it was always in the mountains, we lived in the
southwestern corner of the state.  So we could go to the mountains or the
desert.  Just pick a place.  And if you wer-, needed water, th-, you'd find a
stream and drink right out of the stream.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  When I left New Mexico and moved to Missouri, I would not have dreamed
[laughter] drinking out of any stream that I saw there [laughter].

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  So I guess, partly, it depends on, on how isolated the river is.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  But, uh, course, I, I mean even i-, in New Mexico you always had the
possibility of a cow or, uh, some other critter up stream [laughter] a ways
from you.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  Uh, what about crime in camp sites?  Do you think that's a problem?

B.40:  Well, I suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an
issue.  But, generally, I haven't ever found that to be a problem.  Usually,
people are very friendly and, uh, cooperative all the way around.  So, I've
never deemed that as a threat to myself.  But --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- been, been fairly careful about not leaving tempting things out in the
campsite and stuff like that.

A.43:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It, you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all
that sort of stuff [laughter].

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Don't tempt people.

B.46:  Right.  And usually, if I'm backpacking, of course, there I don't worry
about it much at all.  Cause if [sigh] there's something there that they want,
they'd have to haul it out a long ways so they,

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  usually would think twice [laughter] about it.

A.49:  That's right.

B.50:  So.

A.51:  I have a good friend who goes backpacking about twice a year in the Grand
Canyon.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  He's, he's really, uh, hung up on that Grand Canyon [laughter].

B.54:  You know, I've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down
through there a couple of times.  They really enjoy it but there's something
about going down in a hole that [laughter] just, uh, doesn't really relate
that strongly to me.  I suppose I'll try it some day.  But I always like to
climb mountains.  #Get# --

A.55:  #Yeah.#

B.56:  -- up where I can see something.  

A.57:  Yeah.  I, I think with the c-, like in the case of the canyon, you see more
from the rim than you would ever camping down inside of it [laughter].

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Yeah.  Are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to go out and climb or,

B.60:  Well, no it's mor-, mostly just some rolling hills.  So there isn't really
much,
