=========================================================================

A.1:  Community, I'll start, we have a lot of, uh, we, we've started doing some
and, uh, in, in, uh, we live in a suburb of Chicago.  Recycling has become
somewhat in vogue.  We've always had recycling centers around where you can
take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin, but
it's totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to
such pa-, places because it's, it's a drive out of your way to take things to
these.  But recently we started a program I think is getting, encourages a lot
more participation which is, uh, you have to now pay for each trash bag that,
that the garbage man picks up, you have to pay a dollar and a half and we, uh,
you have to buy a sticker, uh, and it costs a dollar and a half and you have
to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you don't have that sticker on
there, then the garbage man won't pick it up.  And that --

B.2:  I once,

A.3:  -- that, that's for regular trash.  If you have recyclable trash, like
newspapers or right now it's limited to, I think, the newspapers and plastic
bottles, plastic milk bottles, then they'll pick that up for free so there's
the motivation basically.  Your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked
up and recyclable stuff, if you put it in a recyclable bin or recyclable, uh,
container, they, they give you one of these, then that, that doesn't cost
anything, so that encourages people to participate.

B.4:  Well, that's makes sense.  Ours seems really crazy,

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  because, well, we've had places, all the shopping centers, I mean the local
shopping centers, where there's a grocery store and a, you know, drug store
and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans, that
type of thing for, uh, oh, the Kiwanis or some sort of --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- groups pick them up and make money for their causes.  And those are
fairly popular and work fairly well, and you can also take your own stuff to a
recycling center and, you know, get the few pennies you get for the papers or
cans.  I know some people who do that, but, to me, that too much trouble for
the few cents.  The, uh, so I just drop it off at the local place when I go to
the store and let them, you know, some good agency make some money off of it.

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  What little they get, and, uh, that works for me, but now, as I understand
it, from reading the paper, the system seems totally backwards, uh, they are
starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and
a half a month --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- and that's because they will give us containers, you know, certain
colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in.  That all makes
sense, but if you don't want to recycle, you can say, I don't want to recycle
and save a dollar and a half a month.

A.13:  Oh, no.  

B.14:  Which, the theory is that if you don't want to recycle with the city, who
actually has a private contractor do it, uh, if you don't recycle with the
city, then you're going to take it yourself and, you know, make your money off
of your paper and cans.  Somehow, it seems to me like people will just say, I
don't want to pay the buck and a half and I'll throw it in the garbage.  So,

A.15:  Sound like somebody messed up.  

B.16:  It sounds to me like it's messed up because they had,

A.17:  A stupid miscalculation on their part.  

B.18:  I guess so.  We'll have to see what happens.  They're just supposed to
start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and
different kind, different colors for different things.  Uh,

A.19:  So it's totally voluntary.  Even if you pay your dollar and a half, you
don't, you, you can still put everything in the trash.

B.20:  You still could.  So, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and I think I
understand it pretty well from both the paper and T V and we'll see what
happens.

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  Uh,

A.23:  Any idea how many people are going to do it, are going to do it?

B.24:  Oh, supposedly, the majority are.  

A.25:  Okay.  

B.26:  It's pretty ecologically conscious here.  

A.27:  So, some of the people will go along with it anyway.  

B.28:  Oh, I think so, plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a
half and not even notice the difference or care.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  But, uh, it seems strange.  

A.31:  Well,

B.32:  The, the university where I work, it's, uh, strange, too because they have
places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them and, uh,
there is a campus recycling bins, not bins, but, like I work in a library --

A.33:  Yes.  

B.34:  -- and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different
types of things, but they're in staff areas.  But we have wanted to have
specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines.
