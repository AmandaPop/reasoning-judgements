=======================================================================

A.1:  All right.  

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  [Laughter].

@B.4:  Well, how about those Redskins, huh.   

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  That's pretty good.  They, uh, you know, I can't, they're not, they're,
they're a good team, you know.

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  Uh, but, uh, [noise] I think, uh, I don't know how they'll do this year.
They'll probably still do pretty good.

B.10:  Do you think,

A.11:  Have you, uh, been keeping up on the people they've been ((trading)) or
anything?

B.12:  Uh, yeah, they h-, I don't think they've really traded anybody that I know
of yet.  Uh --

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  -- I've, I've got three kids who collect football cards -- 

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- so they, uh,

A.17:  [Child_talking].

B.18:  they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards. 

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  And, uh, actually we went to, after they won the, uh, the, uh, Super Bowl,
we actually went down to the mall in, uh, Washington and saw, uh, you know,
all the players down there.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  ((When)) they had a big rally down there, so, it was surprising how big
those guys were.

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  I mean, they, they look big on the field, but they're even bigger in
person, though.

A.25:  Oh yeah, they,

B.26:  ((Especially)) that guy Joe Jacobi -- 

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- is just a, guy's a monster.

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  I mean not, inhuman.  

A.31:  [Laughter]. 

B.32:  But, uh,.  

A.33:  But, most of them are, what, over six foot aren't they [child_laughing]?

B.34:  Oh, yeah, they're all, they're all huge guys.  I mean, a small guy would be
about six, three and,

A.35:  And two hundred and some pounds [laughter].  

B.36:  Yeah, Ripon, you know, for a quarterback, Ripon was six, I think he was
six, three or four and two thirty --

A.37:  Yeah, he's,

B.38:  -- which is really big.  

A.39:  He's one of the taller quarterbacks, you know.  Most quarterbacks are only
about six foot.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  But, uh, he's one of the taller ones.  

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Uh,   

B.44:  Well, uh, what, what team are you predicting, uh, will come out of the A F
C next year?

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  You know?  

A.47:  That's a good question [laughter].  

B.48:  You think Denver will be as tough as they were this year?  

A.49:  Well, they might be.  I haven't really who they they've been, uh, trading
or anything.  But, uh, they're usually pretty good right up near the top and
so are the Raiders, so it's going to be tough.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  They always have a tough time with the Raiders so,  

B.52:  Yeah.  Well, I was real surprised, uh, that they did as well as they did
last year.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  I didn't realize that they were as good as they were, and actually, I
thought they probably should have beaten Buffalo --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- in the, uh, title game but,

A.57:  Oh, yeah.  I, I think what one of their problems is, is they, they get
overconfident in the second half.  They get ahead in the first half, and the
second half they just kind of blow it, you know.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  And they've done that every seas-, every year for a while [laughter].

B.60:  Uh-huh.  You think Mecklinburg is going to hang around for another season
or is, uh,

A.61:  Uh, he's getting up there in the years.  I don't know if he's going to
stick around or not --

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  -- you know.

B.64:  Didn't they have a guy on there, uh, wasn't a, uh, deaf player on there --

A.65:  Uh --

B.66:  -- this year?

A.67:  -- yeah, yeah, it's that, uh, I can't think of his name now, but he's on --

B.68:  D-,

A.69:  -- defensive.  

B.70:  Davis or something like that.

A.71:  Yeah, he's on defensive.  He's supposed to be pretty good, though.

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  So,   

B.74:  I think he, isn't he from Nebraska?  

A.75:  Yeah, I think so.  

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  Uh,   

B.78:  What kind of college teams do you like?  

A.79:  Uh [breathing],

B.80:  Cornhuskers, right [laughter].  

A.81:  [Laughter] I really don't even keep up with the college teams that much,
you know.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  

A.83:  I'm just basically pro teams, you know, basically.

B.84:  Yeah, I kind of run out of steam, uh, until right near the, the Bowl games
with all the colleges --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- then I watch all the Bowl games but,

A.87:  Yeah, uh,

B.88:  Does your wife let you watch, uh, plenty of football?  

A.89:  Oh, course.  

B.90:  Really [laughter]?  

A.91:  ((Uh, now I get)) Sunday and Monday n-, Sunday afternoon and Monday nights
are reserved for me.

B.92:  Oh [laughter].  

A.93:  [Laughter]. 

B.94:  That's pretty good [laughter].  Yeah, I usually, [breathing] I'm getting
more and more into that habit, but after ten years, I still haven't been able
to get into the habit of just having that time reserved but,

A.95:  Yeah well,

B.96:  Last year, last year was pretty good.  I got, she cut me a lot of slack, so
I could actually watch some football.

A.97:  [Laughter]. 

B.98:  [Laughter]. 

A.99:  Well, I kind of let her watch, every now and then, I let her watch her
shows and then when her shows are over I'll turn it to the last quarter like
on Monday nights.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  So,

B.102:  What do you think of the instant replay rule?  

A.103:  I think some of it's pretty good, and some of it's not so good.

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  You know, I kind of go either way on it.  

B.106:  [Noise] What I can't believe is, you know, there are certain plays, I
guess, that they don't use a instant replay on --

A.107:  Yeah.  

B.108:  -- and you'll see, you know, the most flagrant, you know, foul or something
else, you know and, uh, they just don't, you know, they don't do the instant
replay and then on the other things, you know, touchdown pass or something
like that, you know, they always get out the instant replay and --

A.109:  Oh. 

B.110:  -- call backs.  

A.111:  Yeah, that's kind of, yeah, that's just like a couple ((of them)) instant
replays they did they were over the two minute limit and stuff this last year
and I think that's what's going to hurt them --

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  -- from having it.  

B.114:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.115:  But, uh,

B.116:  Which,

A.117:  But, I don't, Dallas is coming up pretty good.  

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  They did pretty good last year.  

B.120:  Well, yeah, they really, uh, they really mauled the ski-,
