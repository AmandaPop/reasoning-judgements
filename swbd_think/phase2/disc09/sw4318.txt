========================================================================

A.1:  ((Before)) the one will take, uh, okay, let's see, I guess, uh, I can
start.  I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because --

B.2:  Are you really?  

A.3:  -- our family's growing.  Yeah.  Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something
larger than what we have.  We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's
about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon.  So, #I'm looking for something,
uh, littler# --

B.4:  #Uh-huh, which are both kind of small.#

A.5:  -- bigger, yeah.  Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while and, uh,
we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- as well.  

B.8:  Are you looking for an American car or, you open to buying foreign cars?

A.9:  Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  You know, it's, you know, it, I guess the American cars had a bad
reputation but --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- I haven't had any real substantial problems with the --

B.14:  Right.  

A.15:  -- ones I've had.

B.16:  Personally, I have a Japanese car right now, and I really like it a lot.
Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole,
uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now, but
I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product
than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying
another Japanese car, but I would also look at American cars, but when I
bought the car that I bought now, I did that also and I just felt that the
Japanese car was a much better product.

A.21:  Yeah, I mean, -e, -- 

B.22:  So, if I were,

A.23:  -- even if it's just details, it seems like, uh -- 

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  -- they, you know, I j-, there's a door seal that s-, doesn't quite seal
and you have to take it back every once in a while.  It's clearly just a, a
design problem there.

B.26:  Right, it is.  Uh, I'm kind of, right now, the next car I buy is going to
be sort of a sports car.  I would really like to have a sports car.  Uh
[throat_clearing], I don't really, I don't have a family, so I don't need a, a
mini van or such to, uh, [throat_clearing] haul people around in.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,

A.29:  Oh, like a Miata or something like that?  

B.30:  Well, I like the Miata, but I don't like it enough to buy it.  I would buy
something, actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle
Talon, which is an American car.

A.31:  Um.  

B.32:  But, uh, something along that lines.  

A.33:  ((Interesting)).

B.34:  Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay, but --

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  -- uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better.

A.37:  ((That's)) interesting.  Yeah, I guess probably the factors we'd use to
compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- safety, and then mileage.  Probably,

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  Uh,  

B.42:  That's, when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage, and
I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a
long time.  I was g-, that I would get a, for the money that I was going to
spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  So,   

A.45:  Yeah I c-, I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know,
price performance and #things like that.#

B.46:  #Right, exactly.#  

A.47:  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess, but it, you know --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- depends on what you, what you pay initially.  But, you know --

B.50:  That's right.  

A.51:  -- I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger.
Actually --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage and she got just
a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  It's, you know, we, we had to replace the friction plate and the
transmission at thirty thousand miles, but --

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine [laughter],

B.58:  [Sniffing].

A.59:  with it, so,

B.60:  Okay.  

A.61:  But, uh,

B.62:  Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and, and they
were okay.  I had a Pontiac once and, and I never had a problem with it, but,
uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I, I had driven it a few times and
I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge [laughter] --

A.63:  Um.  

B.64:  -- j-, just from, well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars
was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be
looking for a foreign car.

A.69:  That's interesting.  But, yeah, it, it's hard to beat some of the, uh,
like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica,
uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction, but I think they're obliged
to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their
contract that --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used
it for six months and put --

B.72:  Right.  

A.73:  -- you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles,

B.74:  [Throat_clearing].

A.75:  on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,

B.76:  Which is a good deal.  

A.77:  Yeah, because I guess, uh, I mean, well, ninety-two's, granted, but the new
ones, you know --

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  -- fourteen to sixteen is what they go for --

B.80:  Right.  

A.81:  -- on the lot, so all the depreciation has been taken off and, s-, the
dealer comes out okay --

B.82:  Yeah that,

A.83:  -- you know, ((I don't know)) what kind of, I don't know what G M
corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it, but
sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it and
[laughter],

B.84:  [Laughter] Yeah, I'm sure they did.

A.85:  So, but, uh, I don't know, we keep looking at that mini van.  It's just,
you know, we can get a, like a Caravan --

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- for, ((at)) twelve, five -- 

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  -- but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.  But, uh,
uh, it's interesting, but, uh, I don't know, if, if, uh, it seems to be,
