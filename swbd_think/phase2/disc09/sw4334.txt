A.1:  Type of music is hot down in Texas?  

B.2:  Uh, well, I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas.  I know what's hot
down here with me, so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you
since I just know, I don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's
hot around here so,

A.3:  Oh, okay.  

B.4:  So, what kind of music do you like?  

@A.5:  Uh, mostly folk music.  

B.6:  Folk music.  

A.7:  Yeah, I find myself, uh, listening to a lot of, uh, uh, either old timer or
New England, uh, dance bands as well as, uh, just more popular folk music and
new artists coming up.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  Well, we're on totally different wavelengths.  

A.9:  Okay.  

B.10:  I'm more, uh, old rock and roll, uh, some new, newer, I guess you would
call it heavy metal rock and roll type --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- you know, uh, Van Halen, that kind of thing.

A.13:  Yeah, what about, uh, classic rock type stations.  

B.14:  Uh, I don't listen to the radio at all.  We live in a fairly small town, so
--

A.15:  Oh, okay.  

B.16:  -- uh, classic rock for me is what I have, which is like, uh, Doors,
Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix.

A.17:  So, some -- 

B.18:  Uh,

A.19:  -- some of the older Eagles stuff was good.  

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  I, I didn't like, uh, they started getting a little more, you know, the
type of music, at least to me, it's, uh, sounds like it's only sounds good at
a high volumes and I don't like listening at high volumes.

B.22:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

A.23:  But, uh, some of their older s-, stuff was, uh, you know, quite enjoyable
to me.

B.24:  Yeah, well they,

A.25:  You know, Ho-, Hotel California and that era.  

B.26:  Yeah, yeah that does, that's something you don't, doesn't even sound good
loud really.  You know.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  You know, definitely.  Uh, so, anything new you like coming out now, other
than folk music, some I might know of.  I don't know any folk music at all.

A.29:  Well, down in Texas, uh, you know, little, listen to a little country every
now and then.

B.30:  Yeah, oh yeah, here,

A.31:  I'm sure there's a lot of that down there.  

B.32:  Oh, plenty.  Way, way more than I can stand down here.  

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  [Laughter] I, I don't care for it at all, that Texas twang or whatever you
want to call it.  I, 

A.35:  Well, there, there's a Conway Twitty twang, then there's the, uh, Dolly
Parton, uh, Hollywood sound.

B.36:  Yeah, yeah, that's more, even more commercialized for of -- 

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  -- country music.  But, uh, it's getting, uh, uh, getting pretty big
everywhere, as I see it.  Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so,

A.39:  Yeah, I think some of them, the artists are even, uh, hitting the pop
charts.

B.40:  Yeah, it's, it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is.
Concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd,
but, uh, I don't know, it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays,
I think.  It's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, you
know.

A.41:  Hey, I, I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks.  

B.42:  Yeah, and that's all it,

A.43:  But they're not in it to say anything or give a message -- 

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- which is what they were do-, late, late sixties, early seventies, they
were --

B.46:  That's what it,

A.47:  -- they were definitely pushing a message.

B.48:  Yeah, that's what, what you say, and, and then music is wrapped around now.
Now, it's the other way around.

A.49:  Yeah, I, I don't, I don't think Gun, at least to my mind, Guns and Roses
doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say.

B.50:  [Laughter] No, no, they don't have anything really important you want to
hear.  But, you know, it's kind of odd, it's like, it doesn't have to be good,
it's just who does it, you know.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  You hear a, you hear a Paula Abdul song and you, and I think, if somebody
else were to play that, you know, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would
think, that's lousy, but because she did it, it's supposed to be good, you
know, it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do --

A.53:  Right.  

B.54:  -- more than anything.  Madonna can do anything and it would be considered
good because it's Madonna, you know.

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just
because Madonna does it, so --

A.57:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.58:  -- it's, it's, it's really backwards how things are working now but,

A.59:  Yeah, i-, i-, it's the artist, not the merit.  

B.60:  Yeah, exactly.  So, I don't know, I, I don't know that that's, I don't
think that's a good thing at all, but that's [laughter], that's what the,
point we've reached, so I don't know how --

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  -- how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go
the other way, at least.

A.63:  Well, I don't know, I know for myself that, uh, for the most part, I don't
know which artist is which, so I listen to a song, I either like the song or I
don't like it --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- and then if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it
was.

B.66:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's about how I am on popular music.  I don't, you know,
you don't, I don't know enough about it because I just listen, uh, everything
I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they play on the radio so,

A.67:  Well, you have to figure out what to buy, or do you just buy along the same
artist?

B.68:  Uh, I, yeah, I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time.  I don't
really switch around to new things very often.

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  It's just, it's, you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing.

A.71:  Yeah, so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album,
then you stop?

B.72:  Uh, yeah, generally, or, about the only new music I hear is somebody else
that I know --

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  -- will buy something new that I haven't heard and I listen to it that way,
but as far as, yeah, I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often
unless I've heard it.

A.75:  Yeah, see, that's one thing I like about the, uh, some of the folk music
scenes, you know, there's a couple of nice, uh, small coffee houses up in New
Jersey.

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  And, it's very nice, you go into the coffee house and, you know, an artist
is there and very often the artist will have a d-, an album and, so if you
like the artist, you buy the album.

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  So you definitely get to try before you buy.  

B.80:  Yeah, yeah, that's definitely I,

A.81:  You know, it, you, you, you don't always quite get it right,
