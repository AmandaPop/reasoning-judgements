===========================================================================

A.1:  So, do you, your privacy being invaded at any time?

@B.2:  [Music] Well, uh, one of the things that, uh, [swallowing] that I found to
be, uh, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they
ask me to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill.
#That# --

A.3:  #Well, yo-,# 

B.4:  -- is something that is not required --

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  -- and, in fact, uh, it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many
people many [thumping] people from, uh, from doing it.  And it's n-, o-, one
of the things that it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, uh, research.
And to get th-, your, your phone number on, uh, [sigh] uh, lists for phone
solicitations.

A.7:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now th-, that y-, s-, you can still, yeah, I've always done
that.  I started, once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal
then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do.  You going to say you
don't want to sell me this product #then# --

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  -- that's fine.  I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all.  And
then, ultimately, they say, no you don't have to put it down [laughter].  But,
uh, really it's part of this compliance thing.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  Uh, the thing I don't like, I know that certain states actually sell their,
uh, their lists like, uh, motor vehicles.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  That really burns me because, hey, you're required.  You have to do that.

B.14:  [Noise] Right.

A.15:  And [T V] nowhere does it say you h-, asks you whether you have permission
or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And I think that, it, it's one thing f-, to, uh, voluntarily give it
because someone asks.  You can always refuse but it's another thing where it's
required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it
to somebody.

B.18:  Right.  #Uh, That,# 

A.19:  #You know,# I don't think, I don't think they have the right to do that.

B.20:  I agree with you there.  

A.21:  [Rustling]. 

B.22:  That's something that, uh, people have seen.  Oh, here's an easy way to
make some money.  But, uh, I don't know if that's been challenged in the
courts or not.  I, I've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in
this, in, in my state.  Uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense.
And people are looking for alternate ways of, uh, en-, enhancing revenue is
the, uh, phrase they use.  And they were talking about selling the D M V lists
and there was a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, consternation about that and the
last I heard they'd backed down from that idea.  But [squeak] it really makes
you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, uh, public that
you,

A.23:  [Sniffing].

B.24:  don't know about.

A.25:  Well, that's easy.  Whenever you donate money to someone?

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  They, you become, [laughter] put on something like a sucker list and you
start getting millions of calls or --

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  -- solicitations.  And then you s-, y-, y-, it kind of makes you feel (( ))
from doing it again.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Like, uh, National Public Radio or [inhaling] any of these, the public, uh,
stations, you know.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I, I, I, I think I sent in, in money for, f-, once to, uh, to public, uh, T
V.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and --

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  -- everything you could imagine.  I, it's like [inhaling], and it just
started soon after I had done that one.

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  And I just said this is, this is terrible [inhaling].  Uh, and
that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater
in college.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, uh, it's one thing, they don't sell the list.  But the thing that
makes me mad is, uh, then they start getting, uh, other people, th-, the
people do these phonathons --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who are,
graduated in your class or something like that.  And, and they say, oh, we, we
know you.  You, uh, had, uh, contributed x amount last year.  Can you do
better this year?  And, you know, like hold on here.

B.44:  How do you know that?

A.45:  Who, how do you know that?  Why, why you even telling me this?  Is it any
of your business?  I mean, it's one thing that I, and the college knows that
that's,

B.46:  [Popping].

A.47:  just our business.  There's no need for #someone# --

B.48:  #Uh-huh.#

A.49:  -- who is soliciting should know at all.  Just, uh, and that was very
offensive too.  I, [sniffing] and so {very, very faint}, 

B.50:  Last year, the, uh, Lotus Development Company, the, uh --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- company that puts out One, Two, Three --

A.53:  Right [/T V].

B.54:  -- was planning on marketing a, uh, C D Rom with peoples names sorted by
number of different criteria.
