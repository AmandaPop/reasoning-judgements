==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, all right.  Uh, I, I guess I'll start, uh, by mentioning that, uh,
being twenty-four years old, I had a great-grandmother, who is still alive at
this point, was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my
great-grandfather.  And it was a real problem [throat_clearing] in doing that
because, uh, she has Alzheimer's --

@B.2:  [Talking] {could be a TV} Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and, uh, she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility.
And, uh, we were very concerned about her long-term care.  My
great-grandfather, after he was, found out he was going to go into a nursing
home, uh, actually gave up the ghost, more or less --

B.4:  Huh.

A.5:  -- and passed on only about a week after that.

B.6:  Well, my, uh, my, my grandmother is, uh, had Alzheimer's and through the
process we had to remove, we tried to keep her at home.  At al-, we had to
remove her from her home because she was getting paranoiac and tried to keep
her at our home and did that as long as we could.  But, again, the process is
very difficult.  Even, e-, you know, I think that my parents did a good job at
it when, when they went through.  But it's not an easy thing when they've got
Alzheimer's.  But my other grandparents, uh, signed up for a retirement type
thing in Pennsylvania, uh, already.  My father's much older than my mother so,
well, no I guess i-, anyway my grand, my other grandparents are much younger.
And, uh, they, what they did is they sold their house and bought a house,
figuratively speaking, in this retirement complex.  And they live in that
house.  And there, there, there's minimal, because they, you know, they bought
it --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- uh, they've kind of bought into the whole #system.#  

A.9:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.10:  And there's, there's care given for the lawn and stuff and, uh, as they get
older more care can be given.  And there's some minimal fees that they'll
always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already
taken care of.  And when they get too old, they can move into an apartment
instead.  It's like a duplex they have now.  #They can move into# --

A.11:  #Yeah.  Wel-,#

B.12:  -- an apartment.  #And then# --

A.13:  #[Throat_clearing] We had# --

B.14:  -- later nursing.

A.15:  -- Yeah, we had, up here, when they got into, uh, when my grandmother came
over, my great-grandmother came over here.  She actually spent some time with
us and we had to have a nurse come in --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- because we simply, we couldn't handle it.  She, kind of, she'd lost all
bearings as to where she was,

B.18:  [Clicking].

A.19:  and she would actually wander around.  Uh, we were afraid she would wander
herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or, uh --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- you know, it was incredible.  Because my great-grandfather had taken
care of her and she demanded absolute twenty-four hour care.  She had to be
watched, she had to be cleaned, everything, you know.  It was a demeaning
process for my, for my grandfa-, great-grandfather.  We had never realized how
much, uh, how bad she had deteriorated over the, uh, years.  I mean, I, she
would forget my name and she would forget, you know, how to cook,

B.22:  [Clicking].

A.23:  or how to take care of herself.  But we didn't realize the extent until
after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke and, uh, uh, we had her here and
we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little crazy
[laughter].

B.24:  [Lipsmack] Yeah.  That's what happened to my other,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].

B.26:  my grandmother.  My grandfather had died and she wanted to stay on and then
she got Alzheimer's and it was a really hard thing for the whole family.
#I'm# --

A.27:  #Yeah {very faint}.#

B.28:  -- much more appreciate of what my, my other set of grandparents has done.
And my parents have already, uh, kind of like gone on a waiting list cause
it's such a long thing.  Because it preserves the dignity of the, you know,
the whole situation.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on
our resources because it'll mean just, uh, you know, sell, selling their house
now and buying into that at the same time.  #And familiar,# 

A.31:  #Yeah.  My great-grandfather,# my great-grandfather had found, uh, my
great-grandfather w-, w-, was around during the depression so he had actually
hidden a lot of money in the house over there and, of course, you know, the
moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And, and it was, it was terrible and very demeaning.  He didn't want to
lose the independence and --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- uh, that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as
early as you seem to have as far as, you know, planning, you know, of
long-term.

B.36:  Well, we didn't catch it for my first grandmother, my first set of
grandparents.  But my other grandparents had, apparently it's like a
retirement community and they knew a lot of friends that had done the same
thing.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  And when they got there [talking],
