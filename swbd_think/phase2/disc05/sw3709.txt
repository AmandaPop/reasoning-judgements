=============================================================================

B.1:  All right.  Uh, exercise huh [music]?

@A.2:  Yeah.  

B.3:  Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings.  I belong to Presidents.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  And, uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week and I don't
work out on Saturday or Sunday --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- but, uh, I do, I do a combination of, uh, uh, running and weight
training [music].

A.8:  They set that up for you.

B.9:  No, I, uh, actually I just, uh, joined on my own and I have been thinking
about getting with a, uh, one of their counselors just so see what, uh, they
might have to offer --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- as far as, uh, alternatives.  But, I pretty much, uh, worked on my own
routine.

A.12:  And, uh, what kind of running do you do?

B.13:  They have got the track on the inside.

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  And, uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and then on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles.

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  And then after that, I work out with weights.

A.18:  Is is just aerobics or,

B.19:  Uh, I work out with free weights.

A.20:  No, uh, I mean the running.

B.21:  Oh, uh, yeah.  It is really the, uh, aerobic work out part.

A.22:  You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less?

B.23:  Uh, about seven minutes.

A.24:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, uh, out of breath.

B.25:  Uh, no I do [laughter].

A.26:  Oh.

B.27:  Yeah, that is, that is a pretty good clip and I am pretty winded by the
time I get done.

A.28:  Oh.

B.29:  So,  

A.30:  But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to
make six or something like that.

B.31:  Oh, yeah.  I, I, uh, could probably go faster, but then I would wear myself
out [laughter].

A.32:  Right.

B.33:  And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else.

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  Yeah.  How about you?

A.36:  Yeah, I, I don't run much any more.  I did when I was in school.

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  Right now [music] I just lift, uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  --  and, and I, uh, jump rope a little bit --

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  -- and that is about it [noise].

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, uh, they are about a third of
my body weight.

B.45:  Oh, I see.  So this, uh, do you just try and keep them, I guess, uh, firm
and, uh,

A.46:  Yeah and uh, uh, I play the trumpet and the, uh, the more upper body
strength, the easier it is to play.

B.47:  Yeah, uh, #that is true.#

A.48:  #You have# to do a whole lot of sit ups and, uh, [music] and then,
uh, I hurt my neck, uh, about three years ago.

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep
from, uh, hurting yourself when you play high.

B.51:  Oh, I see.

A.52:  You have to, you have to do it correctly, you know, it is like an exercise
in itself, but [noise] a lot of people, uh, strain themselves doing it.

B.53:  Oh, I see.  Uh, so you are in, uh, in part of a band?

A.54:  Uh, I play at Church.

B.55:  Oh, I see, I see [noise]. I use to play an instrument when I was in high
school, but it wasn't the trumpet [laughter].

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.  I think, 

A.58:  Uh-huh [music].

B.59:  So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?

A.60:  Well, yeah, uh, well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know
--

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  -- I mean in Dallas.

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  Yeah.  I keep thinking about it, but that doesn't mean it gets done.  I, I
mostly jump rope more.

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  You know.

B.67:  Yeah, I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, uh, when I was, uh, well a
while back I was more into basketball --

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  -- and, uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to
try to build my calves.

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  And, uh, but, it has been a while since I have done that.

A.72:  Yeah.  I do a toe lift and squats --

B.73:  Right.

A.74:  -- for that.  But you know it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't, uh, accustom your
legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a
long time.

B.75:  Right.

A.76:  They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something --

B.77:  Uh-huh.

A.78:  -- at, uh, uh, great length of time.

B.79:  Yeah, I, I, uh, that is true.  I have noticed that, uh,  

A.80:  And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know.

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do
the squats with.

B.83:  Uh-huh.

A.84:  And, uh, then it doesn't bother me very much.

B.85:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh.  That is interesting though.  Uh, I have been thinking
of changing, uh, I have done the same routine for almost two years now and I am
thinking of, uh, changing it up.

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  Uh, that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their
counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, uh,
get out of the routine.

A.88:  Right.

B.89:  Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you
are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  So, I am looking at changing things a little bit.

A.92:  Yeah, that is, uh, I have started doing more push ups and, and it has
helped a lot and then I add sets to it --

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  -- so that I don't like you said, wear it out.  I don't try to push it so
the end --

B.95:  Yeah.

A.96:  -- in one set.
