============================================================================

A.1:  [Throat_clearing] Do you have any thoughts on, uh, uh, uh, our jury system?

@B.2:  Yeah, actually, I have quite a few thoughts on it.  Before I became a
mother I was going to law school --

A.3:  Oh, really.

B.4:  -- because I wanted to change how our law system right now is working --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- because it's not, it's not working correctly.

A.7:  [Throat_clearing] What parts of the, of the system would you change?

B.8:  Well, I mean, when they pi-, like when they pick a jury --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- they're supposed to have an equal or almost equal number of men and
women --

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  -- to get different viewpoints --

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  -- and they don't have that because the women can't appear in court because
they have to take care of their kids.

A.15:  Sure, yeah, and.

B.16:  So they end up having an all male jury.

A.17:  Right.  Does the system not provide, the system provides, uh, compensation
for wages, but they don't provide compensation for like, say day care?

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  They don't?

B.20:  No, they don't.

A.21:  Oh, that surprises me, I didn't know that. 

B.22:  And a lot of women have to cancel their appearance and tell the judge, hey,
I can't, I've got two or three kids at home that need me, you know.

A.23:  Sure, yeah.

B.24:  And all the judge can do is say, oh, okay, you're excused.

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.26:  There's nothing the judge can do about it, because there's no law that
says, you know, the judge has to help them with day care, so he, you know,
they don't bother.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  And most of the juries, if, if anybody did a study of most of the juries,
they'd see that it's almost always an all male jury, because women can't leave
their kids.

A.29:  Sure, yeah.

B.30:  And if they do get a woman on the jury, she is beyond the age of fifty.

A.31:  Huh.  That's curious, I, I, I never even thought of that before.  I, I did
notice that, uh, most of the time the juries are males [throat_clearing], uh,
but I'd never thought of any reasons why or why not [inhaling].

B.32:  Well, I wanted to go to law school mainly for the purpose that if I was
doing something in the legal profession --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- I thought maybe if enough people knew about the problem, maybe we could
do something about it.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  But then, of course, I got married and became a mother so,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  It's kind of taking a back burner right now, but I'm, I still intend to
finish law school.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  I've got two years left.

A.41:  Where, where did you begin?

B.42:  Over in Arizona --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- A S U.

A.45:  A, okay, all right.

B.46:  But, I, I just don't think it's very fair --

A.47:  Right, yeah.

B.48:  -- because they say well, it's all equal and, you know, we send papers to
this many women, yeah, but how many do you actually pick because they can
appear.

A.49:  Right, right, yeah.  Um, uh, what are your thoughts on, uh, leaving the
sentencing to the judge?

B.50:  I don't think that's right.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  I mean, most judges that would be fine --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- because they're pretty open-minded.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  But if someone accidentally got a judge that wasn't, and there are judges
out there that are racist or prejudiced about one thing or another --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- people could be convicted just because of personal feelings, and I don't
think that's right.

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  I think they need more views that just one.

A.61:  Right.  Tha-, tha-, tha-, that's curious.  Uh, I'm [throat_clearing], I'm
currently, uh, I have been asked to appear in court, in Denver County Court,
uh, [throat_clearing] for a, a traffic violation which I kept, uh, I, I tried
to, uh, plead not guilty by mail, and, uh, for some reason, I really hacked
the judge off, and so now I'm supposed to appear in court, and, and so I've
been thinking a lot lately about, first of all, what I'm going to do.  I don't
know if I'm going to just go ahead and pay the ticket, pay the plea bargain,
or fight this thing to the end.  I, I wasn't guilty, but it's almost
impossible.  Uh, you know, what, what really aggravates me is it's impossible,
I'm in graduate school, and they set the court date on a Wednesday, so to go
from Dallas to Denver, uh, to fight a ticket on a Wednesday would mean I'd
have to leave either Monday or Tuesday and be back.

B.62:  And you'd miss school.

A.63:  Yeah, and I go to school.  That misses a full week of graduate school.
Well, you just can't survive, uh, missing a full week of graduate school ((
)).

B.64:  Oh, yeah, no kidding.

A.65:  Uh, [throat_clearing] and, uh, it's, it's completely absurd first of all
that they, that I got the ticket and it's completely absurd that I should
appear on a Wednesday at court.  You know, I could appear at Spring Break, uh,
you know, theoretically, and I wouldn't mind doing that but,

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  [Throat_clearing] So I'm trying to figure out what, uh, what action I'm
going to take if any, or if I'm just going to go ahead and forget it all and
just pay it to ease my, uh, ease my pain [laughter].  But, but you know,
there's, there's a point, uh, [throat_clearing] I guess you and I being
younger, uh, tend to be a little more idealistic, uh, uh, but, but I see, uh,
I, I definitely see an instance now where maybe I won't be as idealistic,
where I would be willing to give up my ideals for [throat_clearing] a little
peace of mind and --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- get them off my back, which, which is new to me.  I'd never been that
way before.

B.70:  Well, a friend of mine got in,
