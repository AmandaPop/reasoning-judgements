A.1:  Any vacations recently that you would highly #recommend?#

@B.2:  #Well.#  That is like my favorite hobby [laughter].

A.3:  Oh, really?

B.4:  So, yeah, I would travel everywhere and I have been all over Europe and a
lot of the United States --

A.5:  Oh, wow.

B.6:  -- and Hawaii and,

A.7:  Wow.    

B.8:  So, when I can that is what I do [laughter].

A.9:  Uh-huh.  Uh, what, what, has been your favorite trip do you think?

B.10:  Well, [inhaling] I am not sure.  Uh, I guess Hawaii is one of my favorite
places.

A.11:  Really?

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Better than Europe?

B.14:  Well, no that is exciting.  You know, I have been several times so after
the first time it is like anywhere.

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  You know, it loses that newness, but yeah I love it.  I love to go over to
Europe.  I do and mostly I travel through Germany and Switzerland and we have
good friends in England so --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- I have been there quite a bit and I just love it all.  I love to look at
the different people and the different cultures and --

A.19:  Sure.

B.20:  -- to see how different they are from things are from the way we do them.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  The most interesting part, more than the museums, and things like that.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  So how about you?

A.25:  Yeah.  Well, uh, I have been to Canada several times but, uh, that is about
it for me.  I, I am from Denver --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and so, uh, growing up, uh, [throat_clearing] we would spend most of our
vacations right there in Colorado.  Uh, my family is, uh, uh, real into
camping and four wheeling, and so, uh, several, I, I, think, maybe, uh, four
summers in a row, uh, we spent, uh, our vacation time in the summer, uh, four
wheeling through, uh, [throat_clearing] portions of, uh, the southern half of
Colorado and, and, uh, every time, uh, my mother had, uh, uh, I have two other
sisters and my mother had us, uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we
going to visit and then we had to write, uh --

B.28:  Oh no [laughter].

A.29:  -- reports, reports about it during, during our vacation.  Which, which,
was really fun.  It was really fun.  We, we, each got to write little books.
#Uh# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- and, [throat_clearing] uh, it had sparked an interest that, uh, of mine,
uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer.  That is what she had
originally gone to school to do.  Was photography --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, I, I, am close to receiving my English degree, uh, as, as, well
as my, my, graduate degree, so, so, I, uh, uh, we have thought very seriously
of trying to, uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, uh, some
portion of travel, uh, so we are hoping soon, uh, not soon, maybe within the
next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, uh, over to Europe and
take, uh, a trip from the northern portion of France --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- uh, down to the southern tip of Spain, uh, [throat_clearing] and follow.
It is kind of a backward S shape, uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, uh,
in, in, uh, back in the medieval times, uh, to see the relics, uh, in, uh,
southern Spain --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and in Italy and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and
Romanesque monasteries and, uh, just take that journey all the way down --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- and then right a book about #it.#

B.40:  #That# would be quite a project.

A.41:  Yeah, it would be -- 

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- uh, it, it is our big dream.

B.44:  Well, it would be a lot fun.  You know, there is good and there is bad and
my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure.  But,

A.45:  Oh, su-, uh, really?

B.46:  Well, I flew into Milan.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  My daughter is, uh, a twirling champion --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and she had to perform over there and, in Turin and so we had to fly
into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the
Italians, even if they speak English, they do not want to let you know --

A.51:  Oh, sure.

B.52:  -- and they gave us all the wrong directions --

A.53:  [Laughter] Oh.

B.54:  -- and there were just two of us.  At the airport they put us on the wrong
bus [inhaling].  Finally, we saw a policeman.  He put us on the subway.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  We sat there, uh, we did not know Italian.  We looked at each other.  We
said things like spaghetti [laughter] {Loud}.

A.57:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

B.58:  [Laughter] You know things like that.  We finally followed some kids who
told us where to get off.  We followed these kids with, uh, gym bags and we
figured that must be the sports arena --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there
was nothing but a whole in the ground.  I mean it was so, 

A.61:  Wow.

B.62:  It was kind of a nightmare.  But, [laughter] that was our experience and I
guess all of Italy is not like that.

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  But where we were, it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in, we
stayed with our English friends, their team in the hotel and it was beautiful.
It was very modern.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  But it was very far away on a bus.

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  So, [laughter] you know, it was, it was really, uh, it was interesting.
You always learn something.

A.69:  Yeah, yeah.

B.70:  And you always have a fun experience so it is great.  You know.

A.71:  You said that you have been to England several times?

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  I wonder, have you ever been to a, uh, a small town, uh, well it is
actually about thirty minutes from Salisbury.  It is called, uh, Bemerton?

B.74:  No, I have not. Huh-uh.

A.75:  Okay.

B.76:  Our friends live like an hour outside of England, like Ash, around there.

A.77:  Oh, okay.  #Alright, yeah.#

B.78:  #So, uh-huh.#

A.79:  Uh, uh, the reason I am curious, I, uh, the other place I would like to
visit, uh,
