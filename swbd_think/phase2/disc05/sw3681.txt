A.1:  Okay, you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?

@B.2:  Well, I, uh, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to, but, I
guess I'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my
hobbies.

A.3:  What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time?

B.4:  Well, I sit and design cards --

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  -- and, uh, oh, I, I'm really into graphics, so, it, it just, I sit and
learn new programs and I play [laughter], 

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  and I do this, and I do that and,

A.9:  Did you have, uh, your own business or you do that as, just on the side,
or what?

B.10:  I'm, I'm starting a side business in desk top publishing --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and, uh, it's just getting going.  I, I'm teaching in the daytime --

A.13:  Well.

B.14:  -- and, uh,

A.15:  What do you teach?

B.16:  I teach business and computer technology.

A.17:  Oh, that's good.

B.18:  Well, I guess [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  It's, uh, to high school kids, it's, uh, alternative learning --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, it's, it's really a challenge, but.  What hobbies do you have?

A.23:  Well, I, uh, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.

B.24:  Ooh, neat.

A.25:  And I, uh, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and
during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike.

B.26:  Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did.

A.27:  Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.

B.28:  Oh, well now, yes [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  I don't think you can blame the weather on that.  We had.

A.31:  No, just a crummy, well, actually the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid,
they pro-, a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.  And, uh, (( )).

B.32:  On any given day, they say.

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  Uh, I haven't, I haven't played in a while, but I do, when I get time and
it's pretty weather and it's summer I like to play golf.

A.35:  Oh, okay.  I, I play that about six times a year and every year I hang my
bag up if I get that five or six and I swear, swear that game off for another
year, but I always go back to it [laughter].

B.36:  Oh, I, uh, oh, I take spells, I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive
person [laughter] and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand
percent --

A.37:  I #understand that.#

B.38:  -- #and then I get,# I get burned out on it.  But, uh, I do some counted
cross-stitch and some painting on shirts.

A.39:  Well, you do lots of stuff.

B.40:  Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done, but I guess I do and, 

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  I, I like to bake.  It's just me in the house, so, when I bake it's
usually to take out for something.

A.43:  Gosh, I come up there I'll have to stop by and have, try some of your
baking.

B.44:  Well.

A.45:  I call on people in (( )).  My business is, uh, machine tool sales, and I
have some, I, I cover Texas and Oklahoma.

B.46:  Oh, okay.  

A.47:  So, I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.  I got
customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and #Perry, Oklahoma# --

B.48:  #Oh, how neat.#

A.49:  -- and Eda and all that, all that way.

B.50:  So you do quite a bit of traveling then.

A.51:  Yes, yes.  I, about thirty-three thousand miles a year.  So.

B.52:  Ooh, well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies, does it?

A.53:  [Laughter] Well, I usually, see, we, we have our, our band practice is on
Monday night, and during the summer we, uh, we have concerts every Monday
night in the park, and, uh, we, we have, you know, some concerts during the
year, and, you know, various people in the communities want us to play for
things, but those are usually on the weekend, so that isn't too bad.

B.54:  How big is your band?

A.55:  Well, we got, uh, pretty good size band.  Not everybody shows up, but if
everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred but --

B.56:  Ooh.

A.57:  -- we only average about forty to fifty people a, you know, usually.

B.58:  Well, that's still a pretty bi-, good size band. 

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  It's not like there are four or five of you there.

A.61:  Oh, no, no.  This is a, it's a concert band, and, uh, we have a lot of, I,
I don't pretend to be that good, but there's a lot of people that, uh, you
know, are band directors at schools, or have been, or, uh, you know, there
some people that are actually music majors.  They don't necessarily follow
that any more, you know, that isn't necessarily their career, but, uh, we have
some extremely good talent in there, and, uh, as a rule, it sounds pretty
decent, so [laughter].  It's fun.

B.62:  I, I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever, and I'm always very
envious of people who do.

A.63:  [Laughter] Well, I don't know if I have any or not.  I, I've always enjoyed
it.  I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in
the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.

B.64:  Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,
