REMARKS:        Speakers interrupted each other a lot.  Speaker A
had a TV on in the background.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Card yourself or,   

B.2:  Uh, yes, uh, uh, not as much as I used to.  We used to have quite a few
credit cards and over the, the, last few years we've tried to cut them back a
little [laughter] bit and --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- and, uh, down to m-, mainly one each, uh,   

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  Uh, it's, it's easy to let them get out of control.  

A.7:  Yeah [laughter] it's, I work at a, at a financial institution, and seen
quite a bit, used to be a loan officer and [noise] seen people with, you know,
they've had, well, I've seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits --

B.8:  Oh. 

A.9:  -- and,  

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  about twenty thousand dollars of it used and I, and we, we've got one,
but it's just for absolute emergencies.

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  We #hardly ever use it.#  

B.14:  #Yeah, that's, uh, that's what# we try to, to go to, uh, and eliminate all
the, uh, uh, department store --

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- uh, credit cards.  

A.17:  For sure.  

B.18:  Got rid of all those.  

A.19:  Yeah, they, uh, they can, like you say [laughter], you can, once you start
using them they, they're always r-, real willing to raise those limits for you
[laughter].

B.20:  Yeah, they --  

A.21:  That's for sure.  

B.22:  -- they, uh, they used to be, uh, uh, more credit conscious, I think, the
credit card companies.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  Now, with, with interest rates as high as they are, they don't have to be
as #credit conscious.#

A.25:  #No, they can afford# --

B.26:  #They can,#  

A.27:  -- #to write off# -- 

B.28:  Yeah, they can -- 

A.29:  -- a lot more.  

B.30:  -- write off a lot more losses now.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Uh, which, which I kind of disagree, uh, with.  I'd rather them going back
to being a little bit more credit conscious and --

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  -- and lower,  

A.35:  [Throat_clearing].

B.36:  the rates.  

A.37:  That's [throat_clearing], excuse me, yeah, that's true.  I, uh, well, I
can't see why people, if they shop around, you can find, uh, you know,
thirteen, fourteen percent rates without any problem.  I can't imagine why
anyone would even think about paying nineteen, you know, because, 

B.38:  Yeah, I, I've heard, though, that the ones who are offering the lower
rates, uh, do have tougher credit checks and, than the ones with the higher
rates have.

A.39:  Yeah, well, that make-, y-, you know, that makes sense.  I guess if
they're, they're not willing to write off as much, but --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- you know, it, there's a lot of people, you know, I, that, uh, you know,
you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like, well, we s-,
we'll take it just because they sent it to me and --

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- then they get charged fifty dollars c-, or, a year for the, just the fee
and everything, it, I don't know, I just, I have a hard time.  I, like I say,
I, working in a financial institution, I just, I'm really rate conscious, I
guess, and --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- can't see paying, you know, hardly --

B.46:  Well, 

A.47:  -- or near that much.  

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  Twenty-one percent.  Gets -- 

B.50:  #Well, well, peop-,# -- 

A.51:  -- #pretty crazy.#  

B.52:  -- people shop real heavily for when they, for savings accounts and
everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- look at, at spending, uh, eighteen percent [laughter] on --

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  -- on credit.  It's, uh, for some reason they don't look at it that way.

A.57:  Yep.  There's, I imagine there's, there's quite a few people who just pay
it off monthly so they don't have to ch-, you know, get, get charged any, but
it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones, of course,
that #can't# --

B.58:  #That's# --

A.59:  -- #pay it off monthly and get,#    

B.60:  -- #that's true, we, we have tried,# uh, in the last couple years to, to do
just that.  #And #--

A.61:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.62:  -- use them for convenience and pay them off, but there's, sometimes around
Christmas and times like that we sometimes --

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  -- charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them off but, 

A.65:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.66:  But the people who, who can't afford it, uh, they really get caught up in,
in the minimum payment --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- and the interest rate, it, it's sort of like the federal government
[laughter].

A.69:  Yeah, [laughter] exactly [laughter].  That's true, but, yeah, I, uh, I, I
think that would do the whole country a lot of good is, a lot of, you know,
consumers paying down some of that debt they've got.  It just seems like
they're, they c-, right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're
up to the limits in debt and --

B.70:  Yes, that's right.  

A.71:  -- and everything, and so, you know, that's part of the reason I think
everything's kind of stalled out but, 

B.72:  Well, the credit card companies I know are arguing against, uh, being
forced to lower their rates, #but, uh# --

A.73:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.74:  -- uh, I think it would only mean that they'd, they'd have to go back and,
and toughen their requirements a --

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  -- a bit and they'd probably make just as much money.  They just wouldn't
write off as many --

A.77:  #That's exactly,#   

B.78:  -- #losses.#  

A.79:  You know, when that thing was, they were trying to pass thr-, thr-, that
through Congress, they, the thing that Congress didn't realize is that, yeah,
they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and, you know, it
would slow, you know, they were trying to pick things up, but it would just,
it, do, wouldn't do any good.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  Because, #you know# -- 

B.82:  #That's right.#  

A.83:  -- the banks aren't stupid.  They're going to realize that they can't, you
know, they can't keep affording to write off five percent --

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  -- if they're only charging, you know  -- 

B.86:  Well -- 

A.87:  -- thirteen, fourteen -- 

B.88:  -- #like in# -- 

A.89:  -- #percent.#  

B.90:  -- like in any business, they, uh, the same thing happened to banks.  You
know, they didn't look at, uh, the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans
either and that's, 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  In, uh, in real estate and other things, and -- 

A.93:  That's true.  

B.94:  -- it's the same with credit cards.

A.95:  That's true.  I don't know what will happen.  Like I say, we're sure
trying, we, we just got the one and we just don't want to get any more.

B.96:  Yeah, we, I, I use a company one somewhat, uh, uh, to, uh, do air travel --

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- and all, but, uh, I make sure that one's always, uh, paid off --

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  -- because I'm responsible for the interest on that one if [laughter] if I
don't --

A.101:  #If it's not, huh.#  

B.102:  -- #pay it off.  Uh, uh,#  

A.103:  Huh, where do you work at?  

B.104:  I work for, uh, an oil company and -- 

A.105:  Oh, do you?  

B.106:  -- they, they issue a, an American Express -- 

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  -- card so that you don't have to ask for, uh, expense advances when you --

A.109:  Um.  

B.110:  -- have to travel and -- 

A.111:  Uh,

B.112:  -- buy air tickets, so -- 

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  -- so you just use your card, but it's, but it's in your name, so it's up
to you to #pay #--

A.115:  #Turn in the# -- 

B.116:  -- #it off# -- 

A.117:  -- #voucher.#  

B.118:  -- and, and because it's American Express, you can't run up a, a credit on
it.  So that,
