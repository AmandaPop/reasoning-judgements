===========================================================================

A.1:  Have you gone to college yourself?

B.2:  Yeah, I have.

A.3:  Did you?  Where did you go?

B.4:  Uh, I went to Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado.

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  What about you?

A.7:  Uh, I graduated from Weaver State University here in Ogden.

B.8:  Oh, okay.

A.9:  Yeah, so did you, uh, or what would you recommend [noise] for a good
college I guess?

B.10:  I personally would recommend the smaller colleges.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Just because you know [noise] you get a lot more individual attention --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and you can go talk to your professor and, uh, it's just, more I think,
it is more conducive to studying, especially if you are like a freshman.

A.15:  Yeah.  I agree with you one hundred percent.  I, uh, Weaver is a pretty
small college.  We have, uh, about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and
I, I have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and, the, the
University of Utah that you know they have got twenty-five to thirty thousand
people --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and you know all they are is a number.  You go to a testing center for
everything and you just check in by number [noise].  Most of the time, they
said they actually even had, uh, uh, student, or not student [children]
teacher's but, uh, graduate students teach in their class --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- whereas, you know, all of my professors, I knew they were Ph D -s or
whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt, like, say I got a
lot more personal attention.

B.20:  Right.  Is that, uh, is that in the mountains?

A.21:  Uh, yeah.  We are.

B.22:  Oh, great.

A.23:  #Yeah, (( )),#

B.24:  #Well that is the way,# that was what Western State was too.

A.25:  Oh yeah, It is beautiful. I --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- I,

B.28:  I wouldn't trade it.  I wish I could --

A.29:  Yeah [laughter].

B.30:  -- move back.  I am tired of the big city that's #for sure.#

A.31:  #Are you?#

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  Are you close to Dallas?  Or,

B.34:  Yeah.  We are just, uh, out skirts of Dallas [children].

A.35:  Yeah.  We, uh, in fact my campus was right on the, uh, binges of the
mountains [children].  So, uh, it was really pretty all of the time.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Sure.  I, I don't know if I could ever [children] move away.

B.38:  Did you ski?

A.39:  Of course, yeah.  You, uh, well actually the last couple of years I haven't
been able to as much because of, of school but, uh, I, I did a lot when I was
in high school and stuff when I didn't have to spend the time studying and
working and supporting a family but --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- I love it.  You, yourself?

B.42:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.

A.43:  You don't get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you?

B.44:  No.

A.45:  [Laughter] I would think.

B.46:  I regret it too.

A.47:  Yeah. 

B.48:  I really want, uh, I would like to go this year.  We are suppose to go on a
ski trip but,

A.49:  #Go up to Colorado or,#

B.50:  #That is, that# is one thing I would recommend too [laughter] --

A.51:  Yeah [laughter].

B.52:  -- cause, you know, most college, you go to a college and make what you,
uh, can out of it.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And when you get out you are, you basically promote yourself and --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- and you try and network into a company or get a job or start a business
or whatever.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  But, uh, you just can't trade that.  Th-, the time, you know --

A.59:  Yeah, that is true.

B.60:  -- that you spend in the mountains.  You know, if you fish and hunt and
whatever and ski.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  [Throat_clearing]  You know, I would never give up that.

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  They offer, I mean any more they offer, you know, uh, we have
uh, we had a mountain climbing class, we had, uh, you know, we have ski class
and there is all kinds of that stuff that was offered, as you know, electives
and --

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  -- those were, I mean those were the funniest ones I mean.

B.66:  Sure.

A.67:  And they made up for the English classes or you know science classes you
had to take #but, uh,# 

B.68:  #Right.#

A.69:  Yeah, that is what made a [noise] is they say made it worthwhile and at
least kept you going to school on a, uh, semi-regular basis [laughter].

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  I know it was pretty tough come spring, uh, or summer especially winters
that it was so cold man.  If you didn't have a reason, like a ski class you
never went [inhaling].

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  It just wasn't worth it.  So.  But, yeah I, uh, I am convinced that after I
getting my undergraduate degree, I would like to [children] go to a big name
[children] school and get my graduate degree, but they are so expensive, I am
not, anymore, I, I don't think people, they just require a graduate degree
or an undergraduate degree --

B.74:  Yeah, they do.

A.75:  -- and don't necessarily care where it is from and if you want to set
yourself a part you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard --

B.76:  That is right.

A.77:  -- or some place like that or else you know you are just Joe Blow off the
street.

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  No body knows but, what did you get your degree in.

B.80:  Uh, Business Administration.

A.81:  Oh, did you,

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Did you have an emphasis in anything or,

B.84:  Emphasize in finance.

A.85:  Oh did you? 

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  That is what I got mine in, was in finance.

B.88:  Really.

A.89:  Yeah, so where are you working at now.

B.90:  I am at, uh, a company by the name of E-Systems.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  We are a defense contractor down here.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  It's, it's a pretty good company.

A.95:  [Throat_clearing] Oh, really.  Are you an analyst for them or, 

B.96:  Yeah.  I am a scheduling analyst.

A.97:  Oh, really [bird_squawking]. {bird}.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Great.

B.100:  So.

A.101:  I am a little out of my field as to what I want to be.  I am an auditor for
a credit union, but --

B.102:  Oh, really.

A.103:  -- it is not something that I want to do for very long [laughter].

B.104:  #Is there a lot of,# --

A.105:  #We are# kind of the bad guys [children].  It is kind of a negative type
thing but, 

B.106:  -- a lot of companies up there?

A.107:  Uh, not a lot of private.  Uh, there are, I mean, there are a lot of
companies, but they are not really large enough.  There are mainly, there is a
lot of family type companies and just small ten [children] fifteen people.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  We, uh, [throat_clearing] pretty much, uh, you know the government plays a
big part in our economy and,

B.110:  For what?  How do they do that?

A.111:  Well, we have got, we have, uh,
