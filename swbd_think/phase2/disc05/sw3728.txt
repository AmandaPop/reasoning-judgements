B.1:  Okay, what, um, do you watch much T V or, you know.

@A.2:  Um, no, I don't watch much T V.  Sometimes, um, usually the reason I will
turn it on is to hear the news.

B.3:  The news, yeah.

A.4:  But I don't think of that every day, #even.#

B.5:  #Uh-huh.#

A.6:  Um, I think I get most of my current events, well, I get them from
everywhere.  I sometimes watch T V if I, I guess I watch T V if I haven't read
the paper that day.  We don't get a paper but I work, um, at a, I teach a
college class and, uh --

B.7:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.8:  -- there's a, the library has a paper.  And so I often drop in on a break
and --

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  -- and read it.  And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  And then I, I figure if there's big, big news, I'll hear it from my husband
when he gets home or, 

B.13:  [Laughter].

A.14:  someone else, you know.

B.15:  Yeah, yeah.  Now I also, I get it from all over.  I watch the news every
day, and I ha-, we have a news, you know, we get the newspaper, and, uh --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- um, magazines, an-, anything.  You know, I'm, I read a lot, so I get,
um, you know, I'm, I'm really up on, uh, current affairs.  I get, you know --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- the news and, and everything.

A.20:  Yeah, what's your favorite news, do you get a news magazine or,

B.21:  Um, well, I'm not getting an-, no, I'm not getting any news magazines --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- but, um, you know, as, as I said, I do, it's, uh, it's easy to keep up
on current event-, you know --

A.24:  Yeah.

B.25:  -- on cert-, -- 

A.26:  Yeah, we've got.

B.27:  -- you know, especially when you, um --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- you know, you get a paper every day.

A.30:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

B.31:  And, uh.

A.32:  Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?

B.33:  Uh, I don't know [laughter]. Is there anything missing?  I, you know,
[laughter].

A.34:  Yeah, it's kind of hard to know.

B.35:  And I don't know, you know, what, what's, I mean, what are we supposed to,
uh, compare it to [laughter] --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- you know, I mean, the quality, uh, whatever they tell you, you know, I,
uh, [inhaling] I guess I, I, you know, I'm satisfied.  I mean, I, uh, you
know, they, they're supposedly covering everything that happens, so [laughter]
--

A.38:  Yeah, yeah.

B.39:  -- you know.

A.40:  Well, I do feel like, a little bit like, being from California and wanting
to hear like I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an
earthquake or sliding or something, and --

B.41:  Oh, really?

A.42:  -- I don't ever hear it in the news here.

B.43:  #Oh.#

A.44:  #(( ))# Um.

B.45:  Well, uh, sometimes it's such a, you know, it's, it's so, um, slight, you
know like --

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  -- the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the
--

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  -- paper.  But most of the ti-, the times I find that even if there are,
you know, they do have like tremors out there, you know, there'll be a small
article in the paper about it.

A.50:  Yeah --

B.51:  But, uh.

A.52:  -- yeah, yeah.  I sometimes feel like, um, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS
NEWS, um, the top headlines are always a murder, you know.

B.53:  Oh, well.

A.54:  That --

B.55:  #That's what sells papers.#

A.56:  -- #that's because there's a high# crime rate.  Yeah.

B.57:  [Laughter].

A.58:  Yeah.

B.59:  That's, um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, you
know [laughter].

A.60:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

B.61:  You know, but, um, I don't know.  I, I guess I'm satisfied, I don't, uh.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  I mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have really?

A.64:  Yeah, really.

B.65:  We don't get a, you know.

A.66:  That's true.  We certainly get enough coverage.  I mean, we, we can get
news, you know, I mean, there's even the C N N channel --

B.67:  Oh, yeah, I was going to.

A.68:  -- where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day.

B.69:  Sure, yeah.  Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news
because it's all so bad [laughter].

A.70:  Yeah [laughter].

B.71:  It's all so negative, you know.

A.72:  Yeah, #often times.#  

B.73:  #But.#

A.74:  So.  Yeah.

@@B.75:  Well, we have to keep talking, I guess [laughter].

A.76:  Well, no, I guess we can end.

B.77:  #Oh.#

A.78:  #Yeah,# it's just whenever we're, um.

B.79:  Oh, is it really?

A.80:  Yeah.  Have you always gone until the recording?

B.81:  Well, yeah, I don't, I don't, uh, [laughter].

A.82:  Uh-huh.  I guess we're not supposed to [laughter].

B.83:  I don't know, we're sup-, --

A.84:  (( )).

B.85:  -- I guess we're supposed to wait or [laughter] --

A.86:  Yeah.

B.87:  -- I don't know.

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  Becau-, I, you know, like one, uh, well, was it last week, we were supposed
to talk about gardening --

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  -- uh, [laughter] and it was really funny, I, I, I mixed it, made the call,
and it happened to be my friend who lives [laughter] a few blocks away.

A.92:  Oh, really.

B.93:  Yeah, and it was really.  We were laughing, I mean.  But, you know, we
don't really do any gardening, so like, that took like a minute --

A.94:  Uh-huh.

B.95:  -- and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, I mean.

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  [Laughter].

A.98:  Interesting.  Yeah.

B.99:  You know, I mean, some topics, really now, you know, now, this topic, this
is, I mean, there really isn't much to say after [laughter] --

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  -- you know, you, uh, you know, you, you tell the person what, uh, news
there, uh, you know, where their, where they find their sources of information
from --

A.102:  Yeah.

B.103:  -- and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied, and that's about
it, really.

A.104:  Uh-huh.

B.105:  It's hard to talk for five minutes on this [laughter].

A.106:  Yeah [laughter].

B.107:  So, um.

A.108:  Yeah.  Well, I guess I can just say I, it bothers me that I hear a lot
about, um, you know, on the news that, well, it seems like, I don't know, some
things are sensationalized or some things are, um, you know, you'll hear one
report and then you'll hear that it, you know, they didn't, um.
