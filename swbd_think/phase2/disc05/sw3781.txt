B.1:  Well, I suppose we both have credit cards.  

A.2:  Uh-huh, yeah, they seem to be a part of life [laughter].  

B.3:  Yeah.  

A.4:  Yeah, how do you use them?  

B.5:  Well, I do use them.  

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  Uh, I have a few favorites that I use more than others and, uh, I try to
keep my balances fairly reasonable.  I, I could probably pay them off any
month if I wanted to.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  Uh, but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you
start using more than a few --

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  -- and, uh, they all can build up.  

A.12:  Uh-huh.  

B.13:  Uh, I think they're handy.  I just get, uh, I don't carry a lot of cash
with me --

A.14:  Uh-huh.  

B.15:  -- and, uh, I hate writing checks  -- 

A.16:  Yeah.  

B.17:  -- when you go shopping.  

A.18:  Uh-huh.  

B.19:  Well, do you use credit cards?  

A.20:  Yeah, I use a few.  I, uh, I watched my grandmother go into debt 
[laughter] --

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  -- on them and so I've, and then I guess my -- 

B.23:  #Grandmother# -- 

A.24:  -- #mother,#  

B.25:  -- huh?  

A.26:  Yeah, so my mother learned from that and I guess she taught me [inhaling]
to be very, very careful with them.  So basically, uh, I just keep them, I use
them so that I build up a credit rating, you know.

B.27:  Uh-huh.  

A.28:  But, otherwise, uh, I generally, and my husband, it turns out, I've just
been married seven months, but he has the same habit and we just keep a few --

B.29:  That's good.   

A.30:  -- you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for
something, but we always pay it off right that month --

B.31:  Oh that's,   

A.32:  -- so that we don't pay any -- 

B.33:  That's wonderful.  

A.34:  -- service charge.  So that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of
what we're spending.

B.35:  Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now -- 

A.36:  #Yeah.#  

B.37:  -- #compared# to what you're savings is bringing.  It's really, I guess
ridiculous to let them keep building.

A.38:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I feel.  So,   

B.39:  But I know some people can get, get, you know, carried away with them and
let them get --

A.40:  Uh-huh.  

B.41:  -- out of hand.   

A.42:  It's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or
charged that.  I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where
I know that the bill's going to come, but sometimes I forget and so, you know,
s-, a bill will come in and I'll think, oh, no --

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  -- I didn't know it was going to be that high.  

B.45:  Uh-, yeah.  

A.46:  But so far, I've been able to, we've been able to pay it off every time 
so,

B.47:  Well, that's good.  I'm looking, right now I'm k-, kind of looking for a
Visa that has a lower interest rate.  It seems that some of them have gotten
higher --

A.48:  Uh-huh.  

B.49:  -- and, uh, I saw on T V, they had a program on, uh, credit cards and
they're supposed to, I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some,
some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country.  And
I --

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  -- didn't write it down at the time and then I went and looked and, to see
what my visa was and I think it's eighteen percent or something --

A.52:  Um.  

B.53:  -- so, think I want to find something that has a lower -- 

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  -- rate.  

A.56:  Have you ever used Discover card?   

B.57:  No, I haven't.  

A.58:  Yeah, I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off
[laughter] but you know, 

B.59:  Is that the one from Sears?  

A.60:  Uh, I think Sears originally -- 

B.61:  Okay.  

A.62:  -- put it out, but it's, uh, it's pretty well taken all over the U S now.
I mean, uh, I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover.  And
there's no annual service fee, which is good.

B.63:  #Okay#.  

A.64: #You know,# and then, uh, they also give you, they say cash back,
uh, like at the end of the year.  For the amount that I charge, I get
two dollars back or something [laughter] --

B.65:  Uh-huh.  

A.66:  -- but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.

B.67:  Oh, they give you money back for using your credit card.  

A.68:  Yeah, basically.  

B.69:  Oh -- 

A.70:  That's it.  

B.71:  -- I didn't know that.  

A.72:  And I think the service charge is pretty low, too, but, I'm not sure.

B.73:  Um.  Well, you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never
would take any other credit cards.

A.74:  Uh-huh.  

B.75:  I worked w-, at Sears for over ten years and, uh, it was only a Sears card
that they would take --

A.76:  Uh-huh.  

B.77:  -- until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own
credit card, another credit card that was --

A.78:  Uh-huh.  

B.79:  -- accepted, so, you know, now they'll take the Discover, but I still don't
know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard.

A.80:  Uh-huh.  

B.81:  But, uh -- 

A.82:  #Yeah.#  

B.83:  -- #I# never did apply for a Discover card.  I just figure with the Visa 
and --

A.84:  Uh-huh.  

B.85:  -- American Express, [breathing] I probably have an, I can do enough damage
with those two.

A.86:  Yeah, I think it's best to keep the number down [laughter] -- 

B.87:  Uh-huh.  

A.88:  -- that you have.  

B.89:  Yeah.  

A.90:  So,   

B.91:  I've got some that I, you know, I haven't even used at all, uh, past few
years I probably wouldn't be able to use them.

A.92:  Uh-huh.  

B.93:  But, uh, I, I do like my Dillard's, I have to admit that's one of my
favorite places to shop.

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  And I do use Dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department
stores.

@@A.96:  Uh-huh.  

B.97:  But,   

A.98:  Yeah.  Well,   

B.99:  Well,   

A.100:  Do you have anything else to say?  

B.101:  No, not too much more about credit cards [laughter].  

A.102:  Okay [laughter].  I don't think I do either so,   

B.103:  Okay well,   

A.104:  Well, it was good talking to you.  

B.105:  Good talking to you Beth.  

A.106:  Okay.  

B.107:  Good luck.  

A.108:  Have a good evening.  

B.109:  You, too.  

A.110:  Bye-bye.  

B.111:  Bye.
