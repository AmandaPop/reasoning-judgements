==========================================================================

A.1:  What was the topic?  [laughter].

B.2:  Uh, just about, um, it would be #interesting,#

A.3:  #Oh (( )).#

B.4:  to discuss the social changes --

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  -- of the last ten or twenty years.

A.7:  Yeah.

@B.8:  And, um, I guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field.

A.9:  Well, that's a good one.  I hadn't thought about that, yeah.

B.10:  That, uh, of course, when I was growing up, not very many women went to
work at all.

A.11:  Yeah, really.

B.12:  Most everyone was at home.  And some of my friends whose mothers were
teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed [breathing] #that,#

A.13:  #Uh-huh.#

B.14:  their mothers weren't at home.

A.15:  Yeah, there was a stigma attached to it.

B.16:  Yes.  And, uh, but nowadays, it's just so common.

A.17:  (( )) and a necessity.

B.18:  A necessity.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  And that when I am, uh, at home now that I've had children, I've stopped,
uh, working, that it's kind of embarrassing when I go to the store and they
ask, uh, when I write a check out, and then they say, can I have your work
number, please --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and then I don't have a work number to get, give to them, and they begin
to think, um, I wonder if this is a good check [breathing].

A.23:  Yeah, really.  I, well, I hadn't thought about it.  I can see, I, I think
if they asked me for a work number, I'd just write down my home number
#[breathing].#

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  You know, because that's where you work.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  Yeah.  Well, the thing that I was thinking about, uh, you know,

B.28:  [Talking].

A.29:  social changes, and I, I thought well [breathing],

B.30:  [Talking].

A.31:  you know, in a lot of different ways, I, I think number one, just the, the
makeup of American society, how much it's changed.  I mean, uh, [breathing] uh,
I live in Houston but I'm, I'm in Miami right now #on,#

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  business, and, uh, I mean, in Miami it's, I mean, honestly, English is
almost a second language now.

B.34:  Yes.

A.35:  Uh, you know, with all the, uh, influx of, uh [throat_clearing] South
Americans and, uh, Cubans and th-, the Latins, are, are just, uh, I, I guess a
majority in Miami.  You know, of course, in Houston, uh, you've got people
from Mexico.  So that's certainly a change in the, the fabric of society.

B.36:  That's,

A.37:  #Uh.#

B.38:  #true.#

A.39:  The other thing that I was thinking about, the way that things have changed
so dramatically is, twenty or thirty years ago, uh, you know, air travel was
still, uh, not that much in the forefront, #uh,#

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  And now, I mean, it's, you know, hardly anybody thinks anything about
getting on a plane and, and going cross country.

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  Plus, the other thing I was thinking about was just the very fact that
we're doing what we're doing tonight, uh, you know, calling a one eight
hundred number, having a computer hook us up.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Uh, tell us the topic of conversation.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Uh, and, and we take that rather for granted.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  Uh, you know, thirty years ago, uh, a long distance phone call was sort of
a special event.

B.50:  Yes, [laughter] that's true.

A.51:  A-, a-, and, you know, and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been
placed through an operator ((up)), I don't know if --

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  -- you know, I guess you, maybe they did have one plus dialing, uh, in
nineteen sixty-one, but, uh, I, I'm not sure of that.

B.54:  No, and it wasn't, like my parents always watch the clock carefully --

A.55:  Oh, yeah.

B.56:  -- when they make any long distance phone call, and it's, it's pennies, but
for them, it's just a socialized behavior.

A.57:  That's right, and it harks back to the days, like I say, when, when a long
distance call was an expensive, uh, uh,

B.58:  [Talking]. 

A.59:  I don't want to say a frivolous, but it was #an,#

B.60:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.61:  extravagant, uh, event.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And good grief, if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every
#month, they'd,#

B.64:  #[Laughter].#

A.65:  have a stroke #[laughter].#

B.66:  #That's# true #[laughter].#

A.67:  #[Laughter].#  

B.68:  That's probably true.

A.69:  But, you know, it's something that I've just, I mean, I factor that in.  I
mean, that's, that's part of my budget.  I mean, I expect to have, [breathing]
you know, a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- quite frankly, am pleased if it's anything below that.

B.72:  Right.  Me too.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Well, that's good.  In, in, in our homes we all have a, uh, much more high
tech compared to the people ten, twenty years ago.

A.75:  Oh, we-, you know, microwaves.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  Unbelievable, and everyone has, uh, multiple televisions probably and,

A.79:  Oh, I've #got,#

B.80:  #(( )).#

A.81:  yeah, I mean, I've, I'm single and I have three televisions.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  You know, and I really, the two, well, one of them is primary, and the
other one I turn on maybe three times a month, and I've got another one, I bet
I haven't turned on in six months.

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  I mean, it's there --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- you know [throat_clearing], and I think about it too, I have, uh,

B.88:  [Talking]. 

A.89:  uh, four telephones [laughter].

B.90:  Right.  We load up on all of the conveniences, and they're not special to
us anymore [talking] #Just a,#

A.91:  #That's right,# that's right.

B.92:  necessity, and they're, the people who don't have televisions are, are, uh,
you know, unusual in our society.

A.93:  Yeah, uh, yeah, almost like, uh, you know, it's a big, uh [breathing]
issue.  I've run across a few people before th-, that, you know, make a, make
a point, uh, that, uh, the fact that they, uh, don't own a television.

B.94:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

A.95:  #And# of course, you know people look at them like yeah.

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  You know.  And it's, it's, it would be really, quite frankly, even though I
am not,
