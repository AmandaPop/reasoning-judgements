A.28:  [Laughter].              

B.29:  Oh, well what do you do with your seventh grader?

A.30:  Well, she is into a little bit of everything.  She is, uh, loves riding
horses so she goes out riding as much [bird_squawk] as she can.

last year they, they, got, uh, the state level.  They did not win that, but

different classroom with, with, uh, other kids that are involved in this?
