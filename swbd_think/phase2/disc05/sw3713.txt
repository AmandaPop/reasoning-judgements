===========================================================================

A.1:  Kay.  Uh, do you cook quite a bit?

B.2:  Uh, not really, actually, I live by myself and so most of my cooking is
pretty basic.  You know, just for myself, but I cook when I go home.  My mom
doesn't like to cook.  So, I cook all my parents meals when I get home.  That
is about the only opportunity.  I like to, but I just, you know.

A.3:  That is good practice though.

B.4:  It is hard to get motivated to cook for yourself.

A.5:  I know.  When I was single it was, uh, I would not cook much of anything.
I think one night I sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  [Laughter] But, uh, well, right now my husband and I live in an, uh, uh,
subdivision that we have a dinner club, uh, #Cindy.#

B.8:  #Oh.#

A.9:  And what we do is once a month we will meet at one house and the hostess
will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings
something.

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  And then it rotates from month to month.  You get together with four
couples.  So you only host one time.

B.12:  That is pretty nice.

A.13:  It is really nice.  But, uh,

B.14:  Well, what kind of things do you usually have?  I mean do you, you usually
have like, you know, ethnic food?

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  Do you try a different thing every time?

A.17:  We haven't, but I think that would be great.  You know, do Mexican one
time, or Chinese the next time.  I am thinking the next one we get into that I
will do that.  But basically the host so far have just been picking, you know,
what we have and then they will let the people know and they will, uh, uh, ask
people to bring something to compliment it.  But personally, I have prepared
something that I could have done ahead of time.

B.18:  Oh sure.

A.19:  Because, I can't talk and cook at the same time.  Uh, if I tried, you know,
I, I, would leave ingredients out [laughter].

B.20:  Oh yeah.

A.21:  But, uh, we are suppose to be hosting next time.  I am thinking of about
having beef stroganoff because I can do that ahead of time.

B.22:  Oh yeah.

A.23:  Uh.  

B.24:  My mom does that and freezes it a lot of time.

A.25:  Really?

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And now is this one of the dishes that you cook?

B.28:  Huh-uh [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  This is one of my mom's family recipes. 

A.31:  It is really simple, so don't let it, uh,  

B.32:  I was going to say, I kind of, uh, I do not know, I do, uh, odd things,
like, uh,

A.33:  What do you cook when you go home?

B.34:  Uh, I guess last time I was home was at Christmas and I cooked, uh.  I
bought some really good beef tenderloin at, uh, Ralph's in Snider Plaza --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and, uh, I had, I, my parents have a deep freeze.  So I bought like, oh
God, I want to say, it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze.
And so I cooked one of them, and, uh, you know, and basically, have you ever
used that D V sauce?

A.37:  No, what is it?

B.38:  It is like, uh, a meat, a beef enhancer, or something like that.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  I mean, it might not.  I have not really looked at the ingredients and it
may be one of those things where it, it may have M S G in it.  I really have
not really looked.  I do not think it does, but it might.

A.41:  That does not bother me anyway.  So,

B.42:  Uh, you know, I kind of like sprinkle some of that on it [throat_clearing]
and then take like, you know, pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them
down into the meat.

A.43:  Oh, you sound like my husband.  He is a garlic freak too [laughter].

B.44:  And then, yeah, and then, bake it.  You know, and it, it always turns out
really good.  I mean, of course, you know, the better the, the quality of the
meat --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- the better it turns out, but, you know, and if you can leave it out on
the counter for a little bit and, you know, to soak in the --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- garlic and everything, you know, that works pretty well.  But you know,
that is kind of basic and I can do some Chinese and junk like that but, 

A.49:  Do you, uh, stir fry?  Do you have a wok?

B.50:  Sometimes.  Uh, I had one but I loaned it to somebody and they never gave
it back [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter]  Well, I would call them up.  

B.52:  Well, I kind of just use a skillet, really.

A.53:  Probably works just as well.

B.54:  Oh yeah.

A.55:  That is something that, you know, we don't do all that often and every time
we do it, I think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy,
you get a lot of vegetables and everything,

B.56:  Sure.  And the easy, see now that would be an easy thing to do,

A.57:  [Throat_clearing].

B.58:  for the dinner party because you could do that in advance, you know.  I
would just get like, uh, you could use, do chicken or beef, either one and you
know, kind of, chop it up into about inch cubes --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and the marinade, I think, that it is like, uh, oh, like a cup of water
and maybe three tablespoons of #soy# --

A.61:  #Soy Sauce.#

B.62:  -- and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worc-, Worcestershire sauce --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- or whatever sauce, I can not pronounce it -- 

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- so I just call it Lea and Perrins, 

A.67:  [Laughter].

B.68:  because I can't say the name of it and, uh, garlic, and chopped green
onions.  And then, you know, chop up all of your meat, like the night before
--

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and stick it in a tupperware dish, you know, with the stuff and let it
marinade over night.  And then, just strain out, you know, the juice, and, uh,
then, then, uh, stir fry the meat and, uh, you can get the cans of sliced
water chestnuts --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and bamboo shoots.
