A.11:  #Oh this is too# crazy.  Well I, I'm glad, I'm glad it's you dear because
whenever I first heard the topic, I said, oh no, I hate to talk about finances
and a budget [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter]  I don't do that well myself.

A.13:  No, uh-huh.  I don't either but, so that covers that.  #So what's,#

A.15:  I know it, I know it.

B.16:  This is so funny.  This is the third time.  This is the third time I've
done that.  I haven't even had a chance to call.

A.17:  Ha-, but you've talked three different times.

B.18:  Huh?  Yo-, you're the third person.  

A.19:  Yeah, well great.  Ha-, 

B.20:  Yeah, an-, and I got, uh, t-, two other fellows somewhere before.

A.25:  And you've already had two calls?  

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Then I'm ((jus-,)) I, gosh, #I'm ((jus-,))#

B.28:  #You're my# third.

A.29:  That's pretty good.

B.30:  I mean I haven't made a call yet.

A.31:  Yeah, well you need to start doing that.  #But# --

B.32:  #Oh, okay.#

A.33:  -- then, then again, if you're getting three calls and you hadn't made any,
then you really couldn't done much more than that.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Are you, did you record, are we recording?

A.37:  Yeah, we're recording.

B.38:  Oh, okay.  All #right.#

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  I didn't know that.

A.41:  Yeah, well I, I went ahead and started it.  I said shoot, might as well.
As long as we're talking I don't think it makes that much difference whether
or not we talk about the exact topic, you know what I mean?

B.42:  Oh, oh, oh, #oh.#

A.43:  #I# mean, I, that's, that's for folks that don't know each other,
[laughter] that don't #have anything, that don't have anything to 
[laughter],#

B.44:  #[Laughter].#

A.45:  say [/laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter] This is too wild.

A.47:  I know it!

B.48:  (( )) too wild.  Well, how's Miami?

A.49:  Oh, it's good.  It's good.  I, uh, I talked to, uh, uh, m-, the guy who's
going to be my new boss today.  He called.  They had, they were changing
planes in New York coming back from, uh, Bermuda [swallowing].

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And, uh, [breathing] it looks like what I'll do, a week from today, I'll go
back to, uh, uh, [swallowing] Houston.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Then, uh,

B.54:  When, when you going back to Houston?

A.55:  A week from today.

B.56:  Oh, really?

A.57:  Yeah.  And then, uh, probably the next week what I'm going to do and maybe
for the next two weeks, we're not sure yet, I'm going to work in the Houston
office.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Then I'm going to be working with, uh, the crude department --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and, uh, learning what I'm going to need to be doing on, on that side of
the business.

B.62:  So you're not going to stay down there in Miami?

A.63:  [Sigh] Not, uh, not long-term.  Then after a week or two in Houston, I'll
either come back to Miami or I'll go to Bermuda.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And, uh, I don't know.  It's still pretty loosey goosey.

B.66:  Huh.  Um.  Well that's interesting.  I was wondering, you know.  What are
you doing down there anyway?

A.67:  Well, what I'm, I mean I'm working.  I mean, like I would, you know, like
#I did at,#

don't get off work until, uh --

B.72:  #Oh.#

A.73:  -- sometimes it's seven o'clock at night.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  And we've been staying real late cause it's a lot going on.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  And then [sigh] for about, oh, gosh, the first three nights, I had dinners
to go to.

B.78:  Oh, yeah, #yeah, yeah.#

A.79:  #You know,# we have to go out and dine.

B.80:  And then (( )) been the corporate apartment.

a suitcase and, you know, kind of get settle in, I do a little reading, hell

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  And, uh, tonight for instance, I left the office early and, uh,

the news, I thought well let me see if I can get this call over with, you

tomorrow.  But whenever he gets back to the airport here tonight, he's going
to give me a call.  We're going to have dinner together because he wants to
talk with me about some more stuff.

A.91:  You know, #so.#

B.92:  #Yeah.#

A.93:  [Swallowing] And then, but what I'm going to do tomorrow, I'm going to get
up, go get my hair cut --
