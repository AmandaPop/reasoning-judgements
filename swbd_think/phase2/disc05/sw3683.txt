============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, crime is our subject.  

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Have you ever been accused of a crime?

B.4:  Have I?  Um, no, I guess not.

A.5:  I haven't either, really, I guess, you don't count car accidents or
something like that.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Uh, they asked for solutions.  Uh, I'll, I'll be, I'll be very out 
forespoken here.  Uh, the Arabs don't do everything in the world right but, 
gosh they sure don't have too many repeat offenders over there.

B.8:  That's true, that's true.  They, uh, in fact, uh, they also, I don't know
if you're familiar with the Japanese method of --

A.9:  No, I'm not.

B.10:  -- dealing with crime.  But they don't, they have an extremely low rate,
extremely low, especially considering the, uh, the density of the population
and stuff.  Uh, they have, uh, they have this sense of, of family that's very
important to them, and, and family honor, and what they do, the, the main
punishment, the most effective portion of their punishment, is that they take
and publish the offender's name in a newspaper that gets spread all over the
country, especially in the region that they're in.

A.11:  And the family's name, too?

B.12:  It, well, it gives the person's name, and the family is typically so
embarrassed that they have to, they sell their house, they leave, they leave
the region, and move to the #opposite end of Japan.#

A.13:  #[Laughter].#

B.14:  And so it shames the entire family, including the grandparents and maybe
aunts and uncles.

A.15:  Yeah, it's similar to what was this town, maybe it was here in, some place,
on prostitution.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  When they caught a, uh, a, a, a customer trying to solicit a prostitute,
either way, however you want to say it --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- they would publish the names of the cu-, and address of the customer in
the newspaper.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  There are a [laughter] lot of divorces, lot of family counseling 
[laughter] going on, but prostitution went down in that city.

B.22:  I'm willing to bet.

A.23:  [Laughter] Just about killed business.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Well, publicity, huh.  

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Doesn't work over in this country does it?

B.28:  You know, the thi-, I guess the thing is, is, you know, what, uh, uh, in
part, one of the things to blame is the disintegration of the family in
general --

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  -- #and the# importance of the family --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- and, and, and that's, you know, you can't just magically push a button
and make that come back, I guess, but, uh,

A.33:  Uh, if you can, yeah, if you can, or compare crime rates by divorce and,
and single parents and everything else, I'm sure they'll be in direct
proportion to it.

B.34:  Probably #related.#

A.35:  #Unfortunately.#

B.36:  But, incidentally, um, I just, uh, just reading in the newspaper about, uh,
uh, this they're, I don't know, they're moving some of the, uh, highway, uh, 
things, in here in Texas, the --

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  -- #offices.#  And they had ranked Dallas as being, uh, seven out of
seven on scale of quality of life, and I assume that, that includes,
[laughter] that includes, crime, no, nowheres el-, nowhere else in the state 
was above about a three point two, yeah and,

A.39:  #Seven for Dallas.#

B.40:  #And, and,# and Dallas was a #seven point oh.#

A.41:  #If, if# you live, uh, we come off at five hundred a year, and January 
first we had three in one day.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  I swear.

B.44:  I, I really, I thought it was pretty surprising.

A.45:  I think Austin should be seven of seven.  That is, I went to school and
graduated from #U T.#

B.46:  #Yeah.#

A.47:  Oh, it's, hey, if I, if I hadn't stayed in Austin, I should have gone to
Stephenville, Texas.  I'll tell you.

B.48:  [Laughter] Well, they, they, uh, even, even Austin had it's share of nasty
crimes recently, right, with the, with the sort of senseless murder of these
girls at the, uh, at, uh, the ice cream parlor.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Guy just walked in and,

A.51:  Pulled the trigger.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Well, obviously in Texas we let them out too soon.  

B.54:  But, you know, look at the, what's the cost of keeping them in.  It's
something like, uh,

A.55:  Astronomical.

B.56:  Yeah, it's like twenty thousand dollars per, per year to keep somebody in
jail.

A.57:  Did you see where the private ventures that built the jails and they're
going to help alleviate the overcrowding conditions or don't have any
customers.

B.58:  Nobody wants, the, the city, or the, #the,# 

A.59:  #Who,#

B.60:  government doesn't want to #let them do it.#

A.61:  #I, I guess.# It looks to me like, you know, what do you, you get
government out of it and give it to private enterprise, it's done cheaper and
more economical and more efficiently.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  Put the profit motive in front of anybody and all of a sudden it works.

B.64:  It works [laughter].

A.65:  Isn't that awful.  No, it's not.  That's what makes, just customer go
around, you know.  I was telling a guy from the I R S, and, I said something
about profit.  He said, Thank goodness for profit.  I said, I beg your pardon.
He said, Yeah, the Internal Revenue Service, we tax profits #[laughter].#

B.66:  #[Laughter].#

A.67:  I wouldn't have a job if there wasn't any profits.

B.68:  Yeah, that's true.  (( )).  Yeah, but I don't know, you know, I mean,
obviously, you know, having some more jails isn't really the solution either.
I don't know.

A.69:  Um.  Well.

B.70:  I mean, there doesn't seem to be --

A.71:  Maybe we ought to --

B.72:  -- terribly effective.

A.73:  -- put them in these Air Force bases that are closing and utilize those,
you know.

B.74:  You know, there's been several, you know, those kind of died on the
vine.  They were, there were separate proposals around to do that kind of
thing, and I haven't heard anything about them recently.

A.75:  Um.

B.76:  Maybe, I'm the one just hasn't been paying attention.

A.77:  I read an interesting article in TEXAS MONTHLY a few months back about this
guy that was a, uh, a guard at the Ellis Unit down in Huntsville.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And he was a regular guard, what they call a new boot or something like
that.  And one thing led to another, somebody asked for light of a cigarette,
or a cigarette, and before long, he was running dope for them, and he got
caught, and now he's in prison himself.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  And the, the whole purpose of the article was just to emphasize that
nobody's above it.

B.82:  Yeah.
