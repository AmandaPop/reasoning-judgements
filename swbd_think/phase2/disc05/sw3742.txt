=============================================================================

A.1:  So what kind of hobbies you have?

@B.2:  Well, uh, the primary thing that I do, uh, is go around and, uh, collect,
uh, collectibles --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- purchase collectibles and, uh, and some antiques, uh, go to a lot of
garage sales and estate sales --

A.5:  Um.

B.6:  -- and collect signatures.

A.7:  Signatures.  Like, uh, like important people I guess.

B.8:  Uh, yeah, important people, um, oh, some are just, uh, sports fans.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  Uh, I had, I land, like aviation, so I've got a number of them from, uh,
uh, like the Wright brothers, uh, uh, Chuck Yeager, uh, Charles Lindbergh
things like that.

A.11:  Um.  That's pretty neat.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Yeah, most of my hobbies are, uh, I guess I, uh, I like cars, I work on, I
like to work on my car --

B.14:  Oh do you?

A.15:  -- and, uh, yes, since I have an old car.

B.16:  What do you have?

A.17:  I have a, I have a Honda.  It's an eighty-three Honda.  This car's not too
bad.  I don't have to work on it as much.  But I, before this I had a Toyota
Corona.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  I don't know if you ever heard of those cars --

B.20:  Sure.

A.21:  -- but, uh, I had the car, it's an eighty-one Toyota Corona.  I must have
worked on it, like every third day I had it [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  I had a, I had a problem with the, uh, with the radiator.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Uh, the car basically would overheat.  I mean, I, I used to live in
Washington, D C --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- and didn't have any problems when I lived up there, but as soon as I
came down here, the heat was much, must have been too intense for the car.
The car kept overheating.  And turned out it was some kind of a problem with
the radiator.  So I had the radiator replaced, and they did everything they
could possibly do, and they said there was some kind of problem, they just
couldn't figure out what it was, and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out,
the radiator place couldn't figure it out.  So basically I had to keep adding
water to the radiator, every, uh, every couple of days --

B.28:  Oh, gee.

A.29:  -- you know, and what you had to do was you had to start it up, let it get
hot, let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine, then add more water to
it, and then shut it.  And then you could run another three days.

B.30:  Well, that sounds like fun.

A.31:  Uh, yeah, let me tell you.  I mean, it's, it was bad when it was in the
winter time you had to do this too, you know [laughter].

B.32:  Yeah, oh, yeah.

A.33:  So.

B.34:  Well, as a matter of fact, I've been seriously considering, uh, restoring a
car.

A.35:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.36:  Um, I was looking at a Nash Metropolitan.  I don't know if you know what
those are?

A.37:  No, huh-uh.  

B.38:  Uh, they're little, two-tone, uh, cars that came out in.

A.39:  Oh, is it like a mini car?

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  My, my parents' next door neighbor have one of those.

B.42:  Really?

A.43:  They, uh, it, um, I think his wife won it in some kind of contest --

B.44:  Huh.

A.45:  -- and he just, uh, it looks almost like a fake car --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- because it's so small -- 

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- you know.  And it's, it's in perfect shape, and, uh, he just kind of
pulls it out every so often, cleans it up, puts it back in the garage
[laughter].

B.50:  Does he want to sell it?  [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter]  Yeah, really.  #But, uh# --

B.52:  #Um.#

A.53:  -- it's, it's really a neat looking car, though --

B.54:  Yeah, #now I'm# --

A.55:  -- #and, uh.#

B.56:  -- I've been trying to find one that's, uh --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- uh, I was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it.

A.59:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  That sounds kind of cool.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  And the other hobby I have is, uh, I guess I play, uh, the racket sports,
you know --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- racquetball and tennis.

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  I love to play that.

B.66:  Both of them?

A.67:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.68:  Because most of the folks that I found, and I, I used to play a lot of
tennis --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- and when I started playing racquetball --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- by the time I finally got a swing down for racquetball --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- I found out I couldn't play [laughter] tennis any more.  

A.75:  [Laughter] Well, what I did was, I played tennis for a long time --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- then hadn't played for a long time, then started playing racquetball
again, and, uh, when I got really good at racquetball then I waited a while
and went back to tennis.  And so now, when I'm back to either one of the
sports, you know --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- since I, since the gap was so far apart between the two, I think, that I
get back to tennis, soon as I pick up a tennis racket, I'm, I'm back into the
swing --

B.80:  Oh, good.

A.81:  -- and soon as I pick up a racquetball racquet, I'm back.  It takes me a
little while to get as good, you know.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  I usually need, you know, at least a good hour warmup before I'm, I'm back
into the swing --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- but, uh, once I'm back in, it, you know, it's pretty good. 

B.86:  Well, it's tough to those ceiling shots on a tennis court.

A.87:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  Yeah, that's definite.

B.90:  [Laughter].

A.91:  Yeah, you don't, it, I have to really think about the, uh, the ceiling
shots and the side wall shots, you know --

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- uh, and that's pro-, it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it
does in my, on my body.

B.94:  I tell you, I really like, uh, racquetball.

A.95:  It's a great sport.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  (( )) it's, uh, real big, and, uh, and if you play with someone, uh, you
got to play with someone who's as good as you are, you know --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- not better, and, and not worse --

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  -- because if you, I used to play with, uh, my roommate, and, uh, from
college, and we, uh, we were both about the same as far as how good we
both were, you know.

B.102:  Yeah.

A.103:  And we had volleys that would last five or six minutes, you know, and, uh,
it does, I mean like we weren't like the best players in the world, but we,
you know, we, we couldn't get it past each other, [laughter] you know.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  And, uh, I used to work out and play racquetball three or four times a
week, and I tell you, by the end of the summer I was in perfect shape.  You
know [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  So it's, it's a great sport, great aerobic sport.

B.108:  I like it better than, uh, tennis, just because I don't have to go so far
to get the ball [laughter].

A.109:  [Laughter] Well, the only reason I like it better than tennis is, I used to
play tennis with my dad, and he plays, uh, old man tennis, you know, he hi-,
puts underspin on the ball all the time.

B.110:  Yeah.

A.111:  And he can hit every ball, okay, but he doesn't hit it hard, he just hits
it really lightly, you know, makes you run all over the place.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  And it just kind of drives me up the wall [laughter].
