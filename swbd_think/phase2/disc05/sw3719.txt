==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, What do you think?

B.2:  Something is wrong with our school system. Yeah.

A.3:  Right, uh-huh [music] [laughter].

B.4:  Nobody wants to go to public schools.

A.5:  Yeah, well, the class sizes are too large, and [throat_clearing] uh, they
don't pay the teachers enough.  Like in Dallas they have too many
administrators.  They are top heavy.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  And, uh, they, uh, yesterday on the news they had some problems with the,
the, texts having, uh, mistakes in them.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  And, uh, a lot of them weren't, like the history books are not historically
correct, but they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened.

B.10:  So what do you think can be done about that?

A.11:  Well, I think they need to do whatever they can, like, uh, I think, uh,
Massachusetts put a priority on education, and, uh, bringing in industries
[throat_clearing] recruiting --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- and they made a lot of difference in that State.  And in Texas, I think
we are like twenty-ninth in spending.  You know and they put through this
Robin Hood bill, but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall.  It
just distributes the money more evenly [noise].

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  And so, they need to do that.  They need to increase spending.  They need
to, uh, make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching, because most of
the time the teachers spend disciplining the, the, kids instead of, instead
of, teaching the subject now [noise].

B.16:  I agree.

A.17:  So.

B.18:  I have got a friend who is, uh, a very talented teacher and has given it
up.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh, in Carrollton.  Just cause, it's not, I mean, she just can't stand the
paper work, uh, you know, it is, uh, and she is not paid enough.  She gets
more for the, uh, filing claims for an insurance company which she is not even
trained to do.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Uh, I think it is real discouraging.

A.23:  Yeah.  And, uh, I think they changed the way the ladder is now, that, it
takes, uh, longer time for you to qualify for a higher salary, and, uh, it's,
it's, uh, more subjective than it was before.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  So, uh, I don't know, you know, I don't know what incentive a teacher has
to stay in teaching.

B.26:  I don't either [Faint].   Well, do you have children?

A.27:  I just have, uh, one daughter.  She is six now.  She is going to Richardson
Public School.

B.28:  Out of the Dallas School District, basically.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  I don't have any, but if I did, I don't that I would se-, uh, want them to
be in the Dallas School District.

A.33:  Right.  But, the worst school districts are Dallas, Garland, Carrollton,
uh, Coppell really doesn't matter much, it's, it is not at the bottom.  And
the best is, uh, Highland Park, Richardson and Plano [noise].

B.34:  Yeah.  How old is your daughter?

A.35:  She is six.

B.36:  So, [swallowing] she has just started this year?

A.37:  Yeah. Uh, you know, she is learning to read some.  And she can do a little
bit of math now?  [noise].

B.38:  Where are you speaking from?  I can hear a lot of background noise?

A.39:  Oh, uh, Valleyview Mall.

B.40:  Oh [Louder] [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah, you know, thi-, all the calls are supposed to be from a different
phone [noise].

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  So, that is where I am, and, they have a lot of pay phones here [noise].

B.44:  [Laughter]  Oh, that is funny.  Well.

A.45:  And I don't know, uh, I don't know, they cut on the, uh, since Mark White
passed that bill [noise] --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- about, cut back on that extra circular activities.  That may have
improved a little bit.  Because, uh, I was talking to a lady the other day and
that is the first thing she said.  Her, both her children were in band --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and they quit.  And she said, the band teacher acted like band was the
only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend all of his time on
band.

B.50:  And demanded the children.  #Right.#

A.51:  #Right.#  And he, he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects.
He goes to the Lewisville School District.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And, uh, you know, it is just ridiculous.  So he just quit.  Simple as
that.

B.54:  Uh.

A.55:  Everything should be equal.  You know, and there is no reason.  You already
spend all of that time in band.  There is no reason that he should practice
more than an hour a day outside of band.  If he, if he, even has the energy,
especially in marching band.

B.56:  Well, that goes along with football though too.  And, uh {very faint},

A.57:  Right.  And, and, what do you do when you are taking calculus and, uh,
chemistry, and physics too and,
