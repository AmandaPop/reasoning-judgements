============================================================================

B.1:  Ok.

A.2:  Ok, I was watching the soap opera awards.  

B.3:  Oh [laughter].

A.4:  And, uh, it is really making me want to exercise because every single woman
in the audience is, uh, about ten pounds.

B.5:  Oh [laughter].

A.6:  So.  Uh, I started anchoring last, uh, anchoring, uh, 

B.7:  [Laughter].

A.8:  exercising last, about last Spring, when I, uh, joined the President's
Health Club.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  And, I was really motivated and going, and, uh, I went, uh, for a little
while, uh.  I went pretty regular, but it is hard to go regularly for a long
time.

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  And where I live in Waco, uh, they do not have anywhere here that is
affiliated with President's so now I do not have a club and I am, uh, I do not
have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that,
so I am not exercising at the time, at the moment.

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  So, I wish I could.  I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do
that, but I just do not like just running with no where to go [laughter].  I
just cannot do that.  So,

B.15:  [Laughter] Well, I understand that.  I have been trying to get myself
motivated.  I had gone, gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor.  Uh,
she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and I thought that would
be the time to get going.

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  And so, we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and, uh, then she
had to get back to work and which was [inhaling] traveling to New York and so
she is not around.

A.18:  Uh.

B.19:  And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the
morning --

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  -- I don't seem to find time in the day time.

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for
that opportunity.

A.24:  I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, uh, work out with, or
walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation.

B.25:  Oh, yeah.

A.26:  And you can also, I mean you can, you know, pretty much do it privately if
you had your own private, uh, sort of contest.  You know --

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  -- where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your
friend or something like that.

B.29:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.30:  And that would keep you going.

B.31:  Well, more than weight, of course, I could lose, uh, lose certainly --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- from ten to twenty #pounds# --

A.34:  #Uh-huh.#

B.35:  -- but I think more than that, I also notice I just feel better when I
exercise.

A.36:  Oh, yeah.

B.37:  And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to
get myself feeling better --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- just in better shape.  But, uh, all the same it is connected to my
attitude, because I am not feeling as perky and good.  I am also, it is hard
to get my attitude to, uh, to get myself up there.

A.40:  That is very true.  It seems like you walk quicker.  You just, perky is a
good word for it --

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  -- when you exercise. 

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  And I understand that walking is suppose to be the, like, the best
exercise.  Better than running.

B.45:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.46:  Things like that cause it, it works everything --

B.47:  And you have --

A.48:  -- and it gets your breathing up --

B.49:  -- less chance --

A.50:  -- and it doesn't --

B.51:  -- of hurting yourself.

A.52:  -- yeah, it doesn't hurt you.  Like, I understand running hurt your shins
or knees or something like that.

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  So.

B.55:  Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be
jogging in P E and it felt good, but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee.
Actually, I hyper extended it or something, and, uh --

A.56:  Wow. 

B.57:  -- boy, I was suffering for about three weeks later.

A.58:  Wow.

B.59:  So, and I have never had that problem before --

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  -- but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me [laughter].

A.62:  Uh, oh [laughter].

B.63:  [Laughter] It is showing up in the weirdest places.

A.64:  I guess my, my, favorite exercise, in the, uh, in the gym, is the bikes.

B.65:  Oh, is it?

A.66:  To go, yeah, there are these stationery bikes that you just ride and if you
watch television, they usually have television in there or something, or if
you listen to a walkman, it is pretty, it is pretty okay.  Again, that is sort
of weird, because you, you, are not going anywhere and, uh, I use to play
racquetball --

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  -- and I really liked that, because, you know, to me it had a point.

B.69:  Yeah [laughter].

A.70:  You know, uh, there were points you could, you would make and there was a
point to it, but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just, I
don't like that, [laughter] I just can't understand that.  So, I don't do,

B.71:  Yeah.  Well, I have got a dog now and, of course, she needs walking --

A.72:  Uh, yeah.

B.73:  -- and that is a little less trau-, uh, burdensome or boring to be walking
at least with her.

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to and,

A.76:  Yeah.  I know a lot of people just to be safe, like you were talking about,
walking at night and in the morning --

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  -- or early in the morning.  Uh, you see a lot of, uh, mostly older people
though but, that, uh, walk in the malls.

B.79:  Oh, yeah.

A.80:  You know, like early in the mornings and things like that.  I have never
tried that.

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  I don't know.  You know, I have never even thought about it really.

B.83:  Yeah.  That is kind of an idea.  We, we have, uh, over here in Plano, a
little recreation center that has got, uh, a walking track, that it is also for
security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year.

A.84:  Uh.

B.85:  But, I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly, and
it --

A.86:  Oh.

B.87:  -- there is just nothing else to look at and I actually get more tired
doing that, than I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood
here and feel real good.  There I could barely make a couple of miles
[laughter].

A.88:  Uh-huh.  And that is a little less,
