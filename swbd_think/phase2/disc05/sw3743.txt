A.1:  Well, Nancy, what do you think, um, some of the changes in roles of women
are in American society in the past generation or two?

@B.2:  Well, of course, working.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  That's definitely got to be [laughter] the biggest thing, is that
everybody's out there working --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- including me [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Well, what do you think it is?

A.9:  Um, yeah, I agree.  

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  I also think that there are more, um, the people are, women stay single
longer it seems like.

B.12:  Yes, they do.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  Yeah, #they do.#

A.15:  #I know# my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were
twenty --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- and I waited until I was thirty-two, so.

B.18:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.19:  You know, um, I know that.

B.20:  Yeah, that's true.  It's a big change.  I'm an O B nurse and so I really do
see what you're saying there.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  It used to be that our list ran nineteen, twenty, twenty-one for our
patients' ages.  And now our care plans look more like thirty-two,
thirty-three --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and if we get somebody twenty-one, we go, oh, look how young.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  So, yeah, you're right there's a big change, and we have a lot of first
time moms in their late thirties and even forties.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  So, it's true.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  But again, I guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women
having careers.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  If they didn't have, if they weren't out there working and having their
careers --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- they probably would be married and having their children [laughter].
So.

A.35:  Yeah, yeah.  #Seems like there's.#

B.36:  #I guess it's a combination.#

A.37:  Uh-huh, go ahead.

B.38:  No, go on.

A.39:  Uh, it just seems like there are more single mothers, too.  I mean, that's,
there're --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- a lot of, either divorced or, um, you know, never been married, so.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot of mixed up families, that's for sure.

A.43:  Yeah, I agree.  Well what do you think have been the most significant
changes in the past generation or so?

B.44:  Well, just that.  I think the families, the, the role in the family, and
the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- take care of the children, um, we do it all [laughter].

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  I really think that, and I know that there's a lot more participation by
the fathers, but I still think the mothers have the major role.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I really do.  I think they're just, they're not doing very much less, I
don't think as far as the kids and, and the house and everything --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- are concerned, not from what I see --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- and, and they're contributing to the income besides.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  I think that we're really, really putting a lot of stress on ourselves.

A.57:  Uh-huh, yeah, and it really, it's affecting the families --

B.58:  Oh, it is.

A.59:  -- you know, for mothers not, not to be home, and yet, you know, um, I
mean, I, I don't blame anybody when they have to work [laughter] --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- because, um, yeah.

B.62:  Yeah, it's, it's difficult, and I think that, I live in Plano actually, so
--

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- it's a very wealthy town, and we're not part of that, but, [laughter] it
is, you know, and, I think what I see a lot of parents, a lot of mothers
working just for bigger and better --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- and I really hate that --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- you know, I hate to see that, and I, I've been here for a very long time
--

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- but, um, I don't know, now I'm a single parent, and I don't have a
choice any more --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- but I used to just work occasionally for extra money, but now I have to
work all the time --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- and that's really hard --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- and, and I don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work,
and, and leave the kids.  In a way it's good, it's very good to get out with
adults, and I think that's a good thing, if you can do it --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- part time.  But to just go out there forty hours a week, at least and --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- and work and, and leave your kids to get home from school alone, and
that kind of thing, I think that's not very smart.  I think that's --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- difficult on them.  So.

A.83:  Yeah.  Well what do you think's going to happen in the next generation?
You think it'll continue?

B.84:  Well, it's going to be interesting.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Yeah, I think it will change, but I'm not sure how it's going to, because
you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to
buy a home and --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- and to raise a family.  I don't know how they're going to do it.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  And so I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into
the home again.  I don't that ever will go backwards --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- but I don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when
they grow up, how they're going to feel about it.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  It, you know, it could lead to another Woodstock [laughter] type thing, you
know, where --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- where there's just too much material things, and, and maybe these kids
will really resent that their parents are out there working for things --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- and --

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  -- they might want to do without things rather than do that to their
families.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  It's hard to say.

A.103:  Yeah, it is.  I think some, I don't know how many, you know, what
percentage, but some are, will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of
staying home with the children.  I guess I see that happening already.

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  Some choosing it, and, and they get, you know, there're, people chide them
for it, you know, why aren't you out,
