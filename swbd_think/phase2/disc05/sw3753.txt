B.1:  What do you know about the space program?

A.2:  Well, actually, at this point, my understanding of the space program is a
little on the limited side.

B.3:  [Laughter].

@A.4:  Um,

B.5:  I think they keep it that way purposely.

A.6:  Yeah, well, that's, to an extent that's understandable.

B.7:  Yeah, it's going to take, uh, I think it's going to take a long time before
they, uh, get that space colony out there.  #They, uh,#

A.8:  #Yeah.#

B.9:  I remember, uh, six, five, six years ago, they showed on, uh, one of the
scientific channels, you know, not #Discovery,#

A.10:  #Uh-huh.#

B.11:  but one of those old ones --

A.12:  Yeah.

B.13:  -- they had some professor on there who was, uh, building a, it was like a,
it was kind of like a space station, but it was supposed to be for people, you
know, and, uh, experimental stages.

A.14:  #Yeah.#

B.15:  #It# was supposed to be about ten miles long.

A.16:  Oh, it's supposed to be more of a colony than a, than a research lab?

B.17:  Right, right.  Well, they were all going to be research scientists out
there, and they were just going to build it up and make it bigger and bigger.

A.18:  Yeah.

B.19:  And, but the initial stage was supposed to be about ten miles long,

A.20:  #Yeah.#

B.21:  #which# is, I mean, huge for, I guess #for ((space)).#

A.22:  #Like a# central unit, and then everything else kind of rotating out from
that?

B.23:  Um, no, it was more like one big, long thing.

A.24:  #Yeah.#

B.25:  #It# wasn't, uh, anything circular. 

A.26:  {Faint} Yeah.

B.27:  I've seen a circular pattern too, uh, but I don't know if, uh, you know,
how far along they went with the circular pattern.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  But, uh, like I say, this is a long time ago #and, uh,#

A.30:  #Oh, okay.#

B.31:  they, this is one big, long one that they had planned on, and they had
thought out how they were going to, uh, regenerate the air with plants and
stuff and #they had a,#

A.32:  #They,# they had thought that out, or hadn't?

B.33:  No, they had.  They had thought out, they had thought it out.  Only, the
only thing was, it was really, really expensive and it was --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- not ((if you got to think about it)) it was five or six years they said,
you know, by nineteen ninety-seven or nineteen ninety-eight we would actually
be able to, uh, to start launching this thing.  And they would #have to,#

A.36:  #Yeah.#

B.37:  take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece.

A.38:  Yeah, so it was all modular.

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  Like you set up a small section that would be liveable for a couple of
people, and they send up another section and bolt it on and,

B.41:  Right, and then they, and once it got big enough, they would send more
people up.

A.42:  #Yeah.#

B.43:  #once# it got established and they got all the systems working. 

A.44:  Yeah.  #Well,#

B.45:  #Pretty (( ))# {faint}.

A.46:  that sort of thing could work.  Um, [lipsmack] what are the,

B.47:  [Talking]. 

A.48:  was there any indication what they're going to do about, uh, gravity, #or
were they just going to let you,#

B.49:  #No, it was pretty, it,#

A.50:  bob around?

B.51:  No, it was a, it was a gravity free environment [laughter].

A.52:  #Um.#

B.53:  #They,# uh, they had shown, they had shown like at some sort of, uh,
simulation on how it would be up there, and they showed people floating
around so, #uh,#

A.54:  #Yeah.#

B.55:  a-, at the p-, I don't think there was any kind of, uh, you know, gravity
control #whatsoever.#

A.56:  #What,# what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some
form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods.

B.57:  Uh-huh.  Huh.

A.58:  Some of the, uh, I, I heard little bits of stuff about some of the things
they found out about that, was it one and a half year stay, some Soviet --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- cosmonauts spent up in space?

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  And they had some problems, digestive tract problems #and,#

B.63:  #Huh.#

A.64:  minor circulator-, little problems, but they could eventually become pretty
big problems, or #people,#

B.65:  #Yeah,# I can see that.

A.66:  people with, with problems to start with that --

B.67:  Oh.

A.68:  -- weren't really noticed yet.

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  They, they could generate into big problems.

B.71:  Huh.

A.72:  Um.

B.73:  [Music] These, these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff
like that.

A.74:  #Yeah.#

B.75:  #They# were just talking about the space station itself and how were they
going to put it up there and spend all this money. #They, uh,#

A.76:  #That's# why a lot of the, um, designs for space stations have been
circular.

B.77:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.78:  So they can get them spinning.  Centrifugal force comes close enough to,
uh, simulating gravity --

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  -- that there's very little problem with, uh, uh, gravity less, uh, side
effects.

B.81:  Huh.

A.82:  You know.  I don't know if you saw it, was it two thousand one #that,#

B.83:  #Uh-huh,# yeah, uh-huh.

A.84:  That double wheel arrangement.

B.85:  Right, right, right.

A.86:  That's, uh, one of the more popular theories.

B.87:  Um.

A.88:  They also have them where you've got a long central cylinder kind of
#like,#

B.89:  #Uh-huh.#

A.90:  a, like a cross connection tube #and a,#

B.91:  #Uh-huh.#

A.92:  lot of pods sticking out from that central core, #kind of,#

B.93:  #Uh-huh.#

A.94:  like a big pine cone like deal.

B.95:  Huh.

A.96:  Or a bottle brush almost --

B.97:  Huh.

A.98:  -- where the pods are all rotating in enough of a, a, a rotation speed so
that the centrifugal force pretty much is one, uh, i-, is equal to earth
gravity.

B.99:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.100:  So.

B.101:  That's pretty neat, um.  Then I, I, I mean it makes sense.  You know, I
never had thought about it.  You ever see the, uh, the Epcot Center?

A.102:  No.

B.103:  The, #uh,#

A.104:  #I've not.#

B.105:  at the Epcot Center in, uh, I think it's the, the A T and T display, they
show, a, a bunch of, uh, future space pods and what life would be like out in
space.

A.106:  Yeah.

B.107:  It's, it's pretty neat.  I still think it's a long ways away, though.

A.108:  Well, actually, it needs to be put off for a little while for now, just
because there's so much money going into it that #would,#

B.109:  #Uh-huh.#

A.110:  be a whole lot better spent on, on local problems.

B.111:  Yeah, yeah.

A.112:  Um, the health care and, and, uh, law enforcement, uh.

B.113:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and, and I tell you, the, you know, it's expensive.

A.114:  {Faint} #Oh, yeah.#

B.115:  #Just,# I mean, space programs themselves, you know.  I, uh, I work in the,
uh, in the satellite communication business --

A.116:  Uh-huh.

B.117:  -- and putting up satellites is ridiculously expensive.

A.118:  Uh-huh.

B.119:  And these things are unmanned, just a bunch of electronics we shoot out in
space, you know.

A.120:  The bulk of them probably have, aren't even pressurized.

B.121:  Uh, no.
