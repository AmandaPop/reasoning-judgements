===========================================================================

B.1:  Where in California, do you live?

A.2:  Uh, it's near Na-, it's near, uh, San Diego.  It is called National City.

B.3:  Okay.  I was down that way once, but, I don't think I remember that.  Is it
on the coast?

A.4:  Yeah, it is just a little old rinky-dink town, but most people don't go
there.  It is really not a good neighborhood [laughter].

B.5:  I went all the way down to Imperial Beach once.  That is as far as I went.

A.6:  Yeah, it is nicer down there.

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  Unfortunately, I need to be, nea-, near the naval base.  So, my choice of
living quarters is limited [laughter].

B.9:  [Laughter].

A.10:  So, uh, are you ready to begin?

B.11:  Yes, I guess we are going to talk about camping.  Is that #right?#

A.12:  #Right.#  Okay, I will push the button in.

B.13:  Okay [beep].

A.14:  Alright.  Here we go.  So do you go camping at all?

@B.15:  Well yeah, my wife and I like to camp.  Uh, usually just on short trips,
like a weekend or long weekend.  And we generally go to, uh, State or National
parks.

A.16:  Yeah, my husband and I like going for the long weekends, we usually like
going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it, cause, we
like to fish and camp [laughter].

B.17:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well we don't really care for fishing.  Anything, that, that
resembles work.

A.18:  [Laughter].

B.19:  So, we just, uh, we what we do is hike and take pictures.  That is about
all.

A.20:  Yeah, I, I like hiking.  Unfortunately, around here there is not too many
spots to do stuff like that.

B.21:  Well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks.  We have got, uh, state
parks just all over the place and different kinds of terrain and most #of
them,#

A.22:  #Yeah.# I am from Arizona and they have got a lot of it there too.  They
have also got desert --

B.23:  Uh.

A.24:  -- desert, uh, I don't know what you call it, but places in the desert.
They have a special name for it.

B.25:  Well, Texas has every thing from desert to, uh, swamp.  So, uh, I don't
#think they have too many,#

A.26:  #I don't# think I would like the swamp, but, uh, mountains and #desert,#

B.27:  #They# don't have too many swamps in Arizona, I don't think [laughter].

A.28:  Huh?

B.29:  I don't think I have, uh, seen too many swamps in Arizona.

A.30:  No.  It is pretty much dry [laughter].

B.31:  Now we may do some camping in Arizona though.  I have got, uh, my, uh,
brother and sister and father all live in Fredonia now.  So,

A.32:  Oh really?  

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  Do you know where Mayer is at?

B.35:  What is it?

A.36:  Mayer.

B.37:  Mayer.

A.38:  Outside of Prescott?

B.39:  Oh yeah.  #Uh,#

A.40:  #Yeah.#

B.41:  I, I think I remember going through there.  Is that between Prescott and
Jerome, or, uh, over the other way?

A.42:  Over the other way.  #It's,#

B.43:  #Uh-huh.#  Well it #(( )).#

A.44:  #Actually,# if you blinked you would miss it [laughter].

B.45:  Yeah, I think I do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer.
Well, anyway, the, uh, everybody there says the, uh, you know there are places
you can camp, uh, right around Fredonia there.

A.46:  Oh, there is a lot of beautiful camping places around Fredonia.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  And they are getting, they are getting more of, uh, they are just doing it
slowly but surely [laughter].  But, I, uh, like the rustic kind of camping.

B.49:  Yeah.  Well we, we do, we like, actually we like to get off where there
aren't too many people around.

A.50:  Yeah.

B.51:  We did find a nice, uh, prospect, uh, down on the gulf, uh, there is a, uh,
national wild, wildlife refuge called Urandus.  I don't know if you have heard
of it.  That is where the whooping cranes go in the winter #or at least# --

A.52:  #Uh-huh.#

B.53:  -- that is where a lot of them go and, uh, there is an island right off
there called Matagorda and, uh, you can take a ferry boat out there and it is,
uh, completely, uh, pretty much anyway, complete wilderness island.

A.54:  Oh.  That would be neat.

B.55:  Sort of like a big sandbar, you know.  You want to make sure there aren't
any big storms coming [laughter].

A.56:  Right [laughter].

B.57:  But, uh, then you can take, a, uh, take a little bus across the island to
the, to the gulf side rather than the bay side.

A.58:  Right.

B.59:  And, uh, it is really nice down there.  Lots of sea birds.

A.60:  That sounds like it would be nice.  Yeah, unfortunately, my husband and I
have not been able to go camping cause I just had two kids.  Two boys and, 

B.61:  All at once?  Or,

A.62:  Huh?

B.63:  All at once?

A.64:  Well, uh, [laughter] no.

B.65:  [Laughter].

A.66:  No, I, uh, spaced them about a year a part.

B.67:  Uh-huh.

A.68:  But, until they get a little bit older, we really don't want to take them
out camping with us.

B.69:  That could be difficult.  I have seen a few people that had small babies
camping, but, uh, it didn't look like any of them were really enjoying the
experience very much [laughter].

A.70:  Yeah [laughter].  When I go camping, I like to get out and, uh, hike and do
things and when you have little kids you really can't do that very much.

B.71:  Yeah, well I sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down
while when #I go camping.#

A.72:  #Right.# [laughter] That is the object of it, you know, to get out and feel
free and do things that you don't normally get to do [laughter].

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  But, uh, yeah, we haven't got to go lately, but when we go, we, we are from
Arizona.  So, when we go back on vacation next year, we will get to go.  Which
should be nice.

B.75:  Well, I really like Arizona.  I like, uh, uh, a couple times this last year
I made it up to Jerome, just to, uh, enjoy the altitude and everything.  It is
really neat up there some how.

A.76:  It is actually.

B.77:  And that is the town historian,
