============================================================================

A.1:  Woodworking.  Do you do much in the way of woodworking?

@B.2:  Not a terrific amount to be honest with you.  Uh, I really don't have much
in the way of tools.  I'd like to get a router and, uh, some other things like
that, but I really don't have much.  How about yourself?

A.3:  I'm in about the same condition.  #Uh.#

B.4:  #Uh-huh.#

A.5:  Had access to a fair amount at my father's place before I moved away, but,
uh --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- that's been several years ago.  But I've always, always enjoyed what
chances I had to do woodworking.

B.8:  Yeah, I've made a, just some simple things here, just some shelves and, uh,
saw horses, you know, nothing real complicated #[laughter]#.

A.9:  #[Laughter]#.

B.10:  Did a little bit of framing when I was going to, you know, in high school.

A.11:  Framing, like picture #framing#?

B.12:  #Right.# Yeah, no, uh, uh, home framing, I guess that's not woodworking,
#that's construction, I guess [laughter].#

A.13:  #Oh, okay, yeah,# okay (( )).

B.14:  But in high school shop, you know, like everybody had to build a couple of
things, and, I really liked that.  It was a lot of fun.

A.15:  Yeah.  (( )).

B.16:  But you do need the tools.  I don't have much in the way of tools, being as
how I don't have a table saw, or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff.

A.17:  Right now what I've got in the way of woodworking tools is a circular saw
and a, uh, square.

B.18:  Yeah #[laughter]#.

A.19:  #That's it.  Well, a drill.  I do have a drill#.

B.20:  No, I've got a drill, and I think I got jig saw and I got a, a circular
saw, but.

A.21:  Yeah.  I don't know, the woodworking projects I've been involved with
lately, we, uh, converted a, uh, a very large section of shelving from one
restaurant that went belly up --

B.22:  Oh.

A.23:  -- into a small, smaller set for the home.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Needed something for my textbooks and my computer to stand on.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Um, you know.

B.28:  Well, that's kind of similar to what I've done, uh, had a father-in-law
that got a bunch of, uh, of real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out
of business.

A.29:  Ooh.

B.30:  And, uh, they made a great table top, so I made a nice work bench with a
peg board --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- back on it.

A.33:  They smooth faced doors?

B.34:  Pardon me?

A.35:  These are like smooth faced doors. 

B.36:  Yeah, they're solid core --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- #and, uh,# they, they made a real terrific table top for the, for a work
bench there.

A.39:  It would.  (( )) #a good table top.#

B.40:  #So, you know, it's real steady and.# Well, I watch this guy on T V once in
a while.

A.41:  Oh, the fellow with a beard that's hooked up with Sears now.  (( )).

B.42:  Is it the New Yankee?

A.43:  Villa or #somebody#.

B.44:  #Oh#, no, no, it's this other guy who's got a NEW YANKEE, uh, WORKSHOP.
Don't know if you've ever seen him or not.

A.45:  Dohinkey.  

B.46:  New Yan-, new Yankee.

A.47:  NEW YANKEE WORKSHOP.

B.48:  I think that's what it's called.  

A.49:  Oh, #okay. Series though?#

B.50:  #But, he makes, uh#, mostly furniture items, you know, he'll make a mirror
or a chest of drawers or a table --

A.51:  Huh.

B.52:  -- and, uh, it's fascinating to watch him work.  You know, #he#

A.53:  #Yeah#.

B.54:  does a terrific job, but he's got every single thing you can imagine.

A.55:  Oh, yeah --

B.56:  #You know#.

A.57:  -- #he's got#, he's got the sort of thing that, that, uh, you know
professional shop would en-, #envy# --

B.58:  #Yeah#.

A.59:  -- more than likely.

B.60:  Yeah, he's got, he's got all those things you would like, and, uh, that's
the problem.  I watch him do those things, and I say, you know, I probably
could do that, given a little #bit of experience#.

A.61:  #If I had#, yeah.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  #[Laughter]#.

B.64:  #If I had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like I'm sure he has.

A.65:  Yeah.  Well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do, but it just
takes more time #and# --

B.66:  #Yeah#.

A.67:  -- a lot more talent when you got, you got limited #resources#.

B.68:  #That's#, that's true, you have to be better than, than he is and
#[laughter]#,

A.69:  #Yeah#.

B.70:  That's hard to do.  What gets m-, makes me a little nervous when you, you
know, have a real nice piece of hardwood, you don't want #to mess up on it#.

A.71:  #Oh, yeah.# It's expensive stuff #and#.

B.72:  #Yeah#.

A.73:  Last #piece# 

B.74:  #(( ))#

A.75:  of hardwood that I bought was, uh, let's see, a, a one by ten
by, one, one inch by ten inch by four foot --

B.76:  #Uh-huh#.

A.77:  -- #piece# of, uh, of walnut.

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  Oh, beautiful piece of walnut --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- and now for the life of me, I don't remember what I did with that board.
I carried it around.  I got it all sanded out and planed out, and never did
get done with whatever it was I'd originally planned to do with #it#.

B.82:  #Oh#.

A.83:  I think I wound up giving it to my little brother.

B.84:  Is that right?

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  #[Laughter]#.

A.87:  #Anyway#.

B.88:  Well.  I've been tempted once in a while to, uh, I don't know, they have
these community education programs --

A.89:  #Uh-huh#.

B.90:  -- #where#, adult education, you can, you can take a class in the evenings
where you #go#

A.91:  #Yeah#.

B.92:  -- at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a
woodworking class.  I've been tempted to do that.

A.93:  #Yeah#.

B.94:  #I had# so-, a friend that made a microwave stand, and some, you know, some
other kinds of things like that, did a nice job, and, you know, then you can
use their stuff.

A.95:  Yeah, it's one night a week, and I think it's something you'd probably
really enjoy.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  I don't know. I was, I thirty-three on, and just started college --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- and, I mean, going into it like, Oh, it sounds, you know, like it'd be
fun, but, and I had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to
much, but, you know, when I finally got into it, I was so glad I did.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well [inhaling].  Yeah, that's the one hobby I'd like to
develop more [breathing] --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- I'll be honest with you.  Uh.

A.103:  Yeah, it, it's, it's, #I mean# --

B.104:  #It'd be.#

A.105:  -- hobbies like that are therapeutic, too.

B.106:  Yeah.
