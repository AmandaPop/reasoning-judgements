============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, did you watch the Bulls this morning?

B.2:  You know what, I watched a little bit of, uh, of the Bulls game and I, uh,
had to leave.  Uh, in fact I, I think the Bulls were ahead when I, uh, when I
left.  Who won the game?

A.3:  They won in a squeaker.  They won by -- 

B.4:  Is that right?  

A.5:  -- they won by two points.  Uh, they were behind as they headed into each
quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end, I think
they were, uh, looked, they looked like they were closing it out and then
Detroit kept coming back and --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- uh, Isaiah missed a three point attempt,  

B.8:  [Cough]. 

A.9:  at the end and, uh, I think the Bulls won by two.  

B.10:  [Lipsmack] Wow, they've got the, don't they have the best record now?

A.11:  I think they do, as a matter of fact.  

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  One of the, uh, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would,
uh, if they continued at their current pace, uh, set an N B A record for
seventy wins in a season.

B.14:  Wow.  

A.15:  Yeah, they looked real good and,   

B.16:  They, they do, and they, you know, I think by, uh, by relieving some of the
pressure off of, uh, of, uh, [lipsmack] uh, Michael Jordan really helped them
out.  You know, he doesn't have, they don't have to rely on him to score ev-,
you know, thirty or forty points #at every# --

A.17:  #Right.#

B.18:  -- at every game so,   

A.19:  Yeah, well, they, they're, they're balancing their attack and I think they
look like, uh, they'll repeat, although, uh, here in the Bay Area people are
real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors.

B.20:  Oh, I know, I'm, yeah, I saw the w-, [laughter] I saw the Warriors, uh,
just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors, uh, Dallas game.

A.21:  I saw the, the second half of the game last night and they were impressive.

B.22:  They look good.  

A.23:  Billy Owens looks like he was, that was a good move for the Warriors to
trade for him.

B.24:  Yeah, now, I don't, uh, I haven't kept up with what was going on with, uh,
with the, 

A.25:  Well, they traded away, uh, Mitch Richmond, or is it Tim Hardaway.  One of
the two, uh, who, along with, uh, Chris Mullen was, you know, though three
were three of the best in the N B A, and --

B.26:   Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- and, they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or
Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and, uh,

B.28:  Good move.  

A.29:  Yeah, oh, yeah, he's really worked out well.  They've got th-, the Warriors
have got a team, uh, and, uh, I think that will be real interesting to see
what they can do.  They're ahead, and the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth,
uh, position in the west and --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- I don't know, in the east, I don't know, uh, is it Boston in, uh, first
place?

B.32:  Uh, I think Boston's in first.  Uh, [lipsmack] I, you know, I haven't kept
up with any of the other, uh, teams.  I'm so depressed with the Dallas
Mavericks, you know.

A.33:  Boy, they've had a hard time.  They said -- 

B.34:  #Oh, man!#

A.35:  -- #they've lost a lot of# squeakers.  

B.36:  That, well, yeah, but, I mean, just this whole year has been just
disastrous for them and, uh, you know, they're going, I, I think they're going
for an all time record of how many l-, you know, losses in a row [laughter]
they can, they c-, they can, uh, pull out.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  It's unbelievable.  

A.39:  How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.  Do you,
for example, like San --

B.40:  #Uh,#  

A.41:  -- #Antonio# in Dallas?  

B.42:  Well, actually, actually, the, the, the Dallas area here, uh, pulls for
Dallas.  Uh, San Antonio pulls for San Antonio, and Houston pulls for, for the
Rockets.

A.43:  So there isn't much crossover, huh, y-,   

B.44:  There really, I mean, not a whole lot.  You know, I mean, d-, you find
them, they're, find them be, to be pretty loyal, uh, in, with the local teams.

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  Uh, you know, it's kind of, I guess it's kind of like, uh, there in the Bay
area, you know, you don't find a whole lot of, uh, of Sacramento fans.

A.47:  Yeah, it's true, because s-, San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they?

B.48:  Really isn't, uh-uh.  

A.49:  No.

B.50:  It's, you know, it's, it's about the same, uh, same distance from here to
s-, to San Antonio as it is --

A.51:  Is it?

B.52:  --  from there to Sacramento.  

A.53:  Yeah, so it's not something you'd drive,   

B.54:  So it's, yeah, it's not really a local, you know,   

A.55:  Yeah, I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with
kids and that sort of thing.

B.56:  Uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they, I mean,
they have got a great club.  You know.

A.57:  They've done a good job.  I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him
certainly, 

B.58:  Yeah [laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  Yeah that always makes a big difference.  

A.61:  Yeah, I mean, that's --

B.62:  So,   

A.63:  -- I think the way it, uh, I think that's the way it works now in
basketball.  You, you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- and, you know, uh, Bird for the, for the, uh, Celtics and, 

B.66:  And, you know, uh, you know, I used to think that, that one, one player
really doesn't make a club, but it really does, you know.

A.67:  Well, it (( )),  

B.68:  You get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline in that team.

A.69:  Well, yeah.  

B.70:  Once he left, you know, it's, it's just not the same, uh, it's not the same
team.  There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for.

A.71:  Well, I think you're right and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit
and I think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players.
And #I think# --

B.72:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.73:  -- I think Jordan and the, and the Bulls have to be, uh, considered the
likely favorites.  I don't know who would meet them in the west.  Uh, I don't
know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year.  They were
so disap-, 

B.74:  Who won that Portland game?  

A.75:  You know, I wasn't, I, I d-, I watched only a few minutes of it and I
wasn't paying attention.  Uh, and so I don't know, uh,

B.76:  Uh,    

A.77:  But Phoenix, you know, Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs
and,
