A.1:  Which baseball team's your favorite?

B.2:  Uh, I don't really have a favorite baseball team, but, of course, the
Rangers play here.

A.3:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.4:  And, and they've made a whole team history of trading away players that
become all-stars later on.  So.

A.5:  Oh, have they?  Like who are some of their, who are some of their players
that they've traded away?

B.6:  Well, uh, several pitchers, Toby Harra --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- and, uh, (( )) Doc Meddich --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- a, another pitcher, and of course now they've, they've sunk all their
money into Nolan Ryan, so.

A.11:  Oh, oh.

B.12:  They have, they have Ruben Sierra and they have, uh, uh, Julio Franco.

A.13:  Oh.  So they've had some real good ones over the years.

B.14:  Yeah, and they, they traded away, um, Incaviglia  to Detroit, I think --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and then he hit more home runs this year than he'd ever hit before.

A.17:  Oh.  Oh, well that's good.  Do they, is, is baseball for young kids there a
big thing?  Do they start them out early, or where do they get all these good
players from?

B.18:  Uh, no, well, they get them from, you know, Puerto Rico and Mexico and --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- minor leagues.

A.21:  Oh.

B.22:  The baseball, baseball has a big minor league system, [throat_clearing]
especially in, a, a few players come out of college --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and then more players, um, go straight to the minors.

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  And that gives them time to see, uh, pitching at a higher speed, you know.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  How, do, so do they have a, a program at all for young kids there
for baseball, [noise] or is soccer the biggest thing or,

B.28:  Yeah, they do.  It's, it's mostly in the schools.  The, I think the biggest
thing here is soccer.

A.29:  That's, that's what I thought --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- that soccer is bigger.  It used to be, around here anyway, that, um,
baseball was real big for the young boys, but now it, it, soccer is making a
real quick catch up.  Um, I know they have the four and five year old kids
start like with the T-ball.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Are you familiar with that at all?

B.34:  Right, yeah.

A.35:  The T-ball, and I think they go until they're seven, then they have the
pitching machine, I think eight and nine, and then, and then just the regular
pitching after that but --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- it's not, it's not as big as program as it, as it used to be.  And I'm,
I'm not really familiar, around here we don't have any baseball teams, I don't
think that even in Salt Lake City there is a --

B.38:  No, there's not.

A.39:  -- there is a.

B.40:  California's the nearest place.

A.41:  Right.  So it --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- it's not, there's no teams around here that I really follow and am close
with.  Have you ever played baseball?

B.44:  Uh, no.  Just in P E.  Uh, it's, it's pretty big here in high school --

A.45:  Is it?

B.46:  -- and they've had several players, um, picked in the draft.  You know,
they --

A.47:  Oh.

B.48:  -- they're picked in lower rounds --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- especially pitchers.

A.51:  Oh.

B.52:  Uh, but mostly they just go on to college because --

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  -- because they need the experience and the education, so.

A.55:  Uh-huh, right, well that's, I remember, uh, playing baseball when I was
just in grade school, but by the time, you know, we got to P E it, it wasn't a
real --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- a real big thing either.  But I enjoy baseball, just for a fun pastime
now with, you know, a group gets together, a family reunion or whatever, or,
we, we live in a real small community and they have, uh, like fourth of July
celebrations and people will get together and play softball and that's fun, I
really enjoy that.  I think it's a fun game.  I think it's funner to play than
to watch, myself [laughter].

B.58:  Right, yeah.

A.59:  So, do you, do you enjoy playing it at all, or do you enjoy watching it
even?

B.60:  Yeah, I, I, um, I enjoy playing, and it took, always took me, we'd play,
you know, during the spring semester --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- always took me about six weeks before I could see the ball --

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  -- before I could hit the ball.  

A.65:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.66:  And, uh.

A.67:  Yeah, it's a,

B.68:  But, I enjoy play-, I enjoy, uh, watching the All-Star Game --

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  -- and the World Series was really good this year.

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  There, there were some spectacular catches, and a lot of home runs --

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  -- and they had, uh, several double plays --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- you know, and.

A.77:  Was it in Candlestick Park again?

B.78:  Uh, no, it was, uh, uh, Minnesota Twins versus the Atlanta Braves.

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  And both the teams were in last place at one point in the season.

A.81:  This year?

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  My word.

B.84:  Then they fought their way back up to the top and then, of course,
Minnesota won, I think, in the seventh game, and ended up.

A.85:  Oh, wow [laughter].

B.86:  So it was really exciting.

A.87:  [Laughter] Oh, that would be exciting.  I, I listened a little bit about
it, but I didn't know, you know, much about it all.  So it had to go the full
seven games.

B.88:  Right.

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  And it looked for a while like Atlanta was going to win, you know, before
they went back to Minnesota, but it didn't happen.

A.91:  Oh.

B.92:  You know, they played,
