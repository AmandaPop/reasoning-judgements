A.1:  Well, how do you feel about, um, putting an elderly family, family member
in a nursing home?

@B.2:  I'm not too happy about the idea, although I do realize that sometimes it
becomes necessary to do that or to have around the clock kind of he-, care
available in the house --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- which often is, is not that, um, easy to, to do.  Sometimes it really is
easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be
given.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I'm very happy that in my life so far I have not had to do that kind of a
thing.  Um, my own mother lived with us for some years, and, uh, just died
peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life, and --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- uh, I never had to face that personally.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, uh, what do you think you might do in such a --

A.11:  Yeah --

B.12:  -- situation?

A.13:  -- I agree.  I, it's, it's a tough issue.  I feel like each case probably
has to be evaluated individually.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  I feel, um, I, I feel like as families, you know, we need to take care of
the older ones in our families.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And yet I understand, um, well, we may be facing that with my grandmother.

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  She is living near my parents out in California, and they, this year they
moved her into a, um, retirement apartment complex --

B.20:  Oh, yeah.

A.21:  -- so she's got part time care.  But as soon as she needs around the clock
care, then she's not allowed to live there any more.

B.22:  I see.

A.23:  And so, we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother
or they put her into a nursing home.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And it's, it's difficult, because I know my mother feels really, um, torn
about it.  She doesn't want to, to put her in a place where she's going to be
unhappy, lonely or where there's bad care, and sometimes you just don't know
what the --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- the place is like.  Um, I mean, you really need to get recommendations,
I guess, from others, and, um, and yet, it's a real burden to her to have to,
to be there all the time, or else, you know, or else, like you said, you have
to hire someone to --

B.28:  That's right.

A.29:  -- be in the home.  It's a tough issue.

B.30:  Yeah.  People are just not at home as much as they used to be, um --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet, and, um,
therefore, uh, they have to leave the older person either by themselves or --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- with the care of somebody else.  And some of the diseases that, uh,
older people have, uh, do require more intensive surveillance.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  So, uh, it, it isn't easy.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  I suppose one of the, uh, best things if you are considering a nursing home
is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations.  I know I always
trust the opinion of a close friend, uh, above just what I might read about a
place.  If somebody I knew and cared about --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- liked a place and said, No, this was good, and we were happy about the
personnel and the care, et cetera and so forth, I would, it certainly would go
up in my estimation.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And, uh, sometimes we, as you said, don't know a lot about where we are
putting somebody that we care about --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and it's hard to know what the best, uh, place is.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Uh, I was thinking, you know, might, I guess I would want to visit the
place quite a bit before or something and, and talk to the staff, see what
their attitudes are.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about
being there, um, because I've been in different nursing homes where I've
sensed different atmospheres, you know.  Often it's, it's been negative,
where, and I know that partly can be the attitude of the person if they, they
feel neglected by their family or --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- whatever or they feel just ready to die and --

B.52:  Um.

A.53:  -- you know, tired of feeling --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- not feeling good all the time --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- then they're not going to feel too good.  

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  But then I've, I've been to other places where, you know, the people have
told me, um, this is a really good place.  The people here really care about
us.  So.

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Well, there's hope, I guess, uh.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  Has, uh, your grandmother always lived in California?

A.65:  Yeah, well --

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  -- no, um, but all the years that I've been alive she has --

B.68:  I see, yeah.

A.69:  -- for the last thirty years or so.

B.70:  Yeah.  What part of California is that?

A.71:  It's central California.

B.72:  Oh, I see. 

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  We used to live out there in the San Jose area --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- so, uh, you know, I'm kind of familiar with the State of California --

A.77:  #Yeah, this is Fresno, uh-huh.#

B.78:  -- #like it very much, yeah.# But, um, uh, it's, uh, it's a difficult
situation.  Uh, sometimes also when you get involved in the, in those
residences for the elderly, the retirement homes, and, and also, uh, maybe
even the nursing division of a residence home, um, it's tremendously
expensive, and sometimes they ask you to, uh,
