============================================================================

B.1:  Yes.  

A.2:  Okay, what do you d-, consider as, as camping?  

@B.3:  Well, uh, we've done a lot of tent camping.  That's probably the closest
definition that I usually think of but, uh, there are a couple of places in
the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are
sort of like rustic cabins.  They have no, uh, electricity and no water --

A.4:  Uh-huh.  

B.5:  -- but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and --

A.6:  Uh-huh.  

B.7:  -- you can spread out sleeping bags on, on, uh, wooden surfaces, so --

A.8:  Um. 

B.9:  -- it's a pseudo cabin, but they call it environmental camping [laughter].

A.10:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  #Well, the only camping# --

B.11:  #We really enjoy that.#

A.12:  -- the only camping I've done really is living in a tent.  We used to go to
Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a --

B.13:  Oh.  

A.14:  -- row.  

B.15:  That's beautiful.  

A.16:  And, uh, you know, take everything up there, park our car, unload the car
and then go by boat to the camp spot, you know, two or three trips back to the
car to unload everything.

B.17:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.18:  And, uh, the,   

B.19:  Is it one o-, when you've been there, is it one of those, uh, state park
arrangements where, 

A.20:  No, no, it was just a little camp spot that we found our, you know, by
ourselves --

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  -- and it was usually in a little place called ((Calucci)) Creek.

B.23:  Oh. 

A.24:  And, uh, you know, we put up our eating tent, our john tent, and our
sleeping tent [inhaling] and, uh, slept in, in the tent, you know, on, 

B.25:  I don't think I've ever seen a john tent.  

A.26:  Well,  

B.27:  That's, that's more rustic camping, perhaps, than I've done.  Usually where
someplace where we're sort of close to, 

A.28:  You know what it is?  It's actually one of those little tents that you take
to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in.

B.29:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.30:  That's what we use to put around our john.  

B.31:  That's great [laughter].  

A.32:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.33:  You usually spend, then, quite a few days.  

A.34:  It was like two weeks.  

B.35:  Oh, wow.   

A.36:  [Throat_clearing] Uh-huh.  

B.37:  How do you like that?  I don't think I've ever been camping quite that
long.  That seems like --

A.38:  Uh, it was,   

B.39:  -- without showers and all, you, how, how did you -- 

A.40:  Well just,   

B.41:  -- how did you enjoy that?  

A.42:  It was, it was nice for a while, but after fifteen years I got tired of it.

B.43:  [Laughter]. 

A.44:  And then my next, my next vacation trip was to Hawaii [laughter].

B.45:  [Laughter] So it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while.

A.46:  Right, right.  

B.47:  Sounds like fun.  

A.48:  But, uh,    

B.49:  Thing about Shasta, too, is there's so many other things that you can do.

A.50:  I've never gone anyplace else, really except Lake Shasta -- 

B.51:  Uh-huh.  

A.52:  -- camping, you know.  

B.53:  Is Patterson fairly close to Shasta?  

A.54:  No, Patterson's down by Modesto.  

B.55:  Oh, okay.  

A.56:  It's like twenty minutes away.  I used to live in Oakland.  

B.57:  Oh well,   

A.58:  And, uh, used to go camping all the time up there --

B.59:  Yeah.  

A.60:  -- but I've lived down here in Patterson now since eighty-eight.

B.61:  Uh-huh.  

A.62:  You know.  

B.63:  There are a lot of, uh, camping grounds, county and state facilities in the
Santa Cruz mountains south of here, so --

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  -- tends to be a good place for us to get away.  

A.66:  Uh-huh.  

B.67:  Sometimes,  

A.68:  Do you have little kids that like to,   

B.69:  We have one two year old.

A.70:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.71:  So actually, we'd been camping for a long time before she was born
[laughter] and --

A.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.73:  -- just now introducing her to her, it to her, rather.  

A.74:  It's fun for kids, though, isn't it?  

B.75:  Yeah, they really enjoy it.  

A.76:  You know.  

B.77:  I think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's
going to run off to.  She can pretty much stay close and --

A.78:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.79:  -- I think her first camping trip she was eight months old, so --

A.80:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.81:  -- hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do.  

A.82:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm ready to go camping again.  I, I did go camping in a, in
a camper on a pickup deer hunting.

B.83:  Uh-huh.  

A.84:  Uh, over a weekend so, know, lived in a camper on that.  

B.85:  Uh-huh, that's, that's kind of fun.  We did that once in Yosemite, too.

A.86:  Yeah, it's, that's not too bad.  At least you're inside, you don't have to
worry about the bears and, 

B.87:  Right [laughter].   

A.88:  [Laughter]. 

B.89:  That was one good reason in Yosemite.  

A.90:  [Laughter]. 

B.91:  The person in the camper next to us -- 

A.92:  Uh-huh.  

B.93:  -- had gotten hit by the bears that night, so -- 

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  -- we were glad we were a little more secure.  

A.96:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  But,  

B.97:  Yeah, in fact, I've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the,
uh, the camper arrangement.  I know that they have tent cabins --

A.98:  Uh-huh.  

B.99:  -- that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but, 

A.100:  Yeah, it, it, it would be fun to go camping up there again.  I haven't been
up to Yosemite for, God, I don't know how many years.  I would love to go up
there again.

B.101:  Yeah, it's a beautiful place.  I think I worry that it's changing so much
so quickly.

A.102:  Uh-huh.  

B.103:  The valley has become so popular.  

A.104:  Yeah, I know.  Th-, they said the road up there, is terrible now, you know,
with all the traffic.

B.105:  Do you remember it a, a long time ago.  I don't know if you ever went
there, like back in the fifties or, 

A.106:  It was a long time ago that I went there, but I've only been there once.

B.107:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.108:  You know.  

B.109:  My folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little.  Uh,

A.110:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.111:  And that at that time there really weren't del-, designated campsites, so,
uh, people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their, their
terrain and put themselves [laughter] basically anywhere they could find a
spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you, wake up in
the morning and just be surrounded [laughter].

A.112:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.113:  There were no limitations,  

A.114:  [Laughter]. 

B.115:  in other words, to the campsite.  

A.116:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.117:  There were people everywhere.  

A.118:  But it's beautiful, though.

B.119:  It's a little bit better arrangement today.  

A.120:  You look outside in the dark and you see all the st-, all the stars up
there and everything.

B.121:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.122:  Compared to, you know living in the c-,
