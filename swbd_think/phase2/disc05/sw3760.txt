===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our
spare time.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

@A.3:  Uh, I basically read books.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  It is, I do.  Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed
and my husband in bed, so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am, I
have about three books that I am going on.  And I will work on one for a
little bit, you know, and then the next one.  But that's just kind of, 

B.6:  Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.

A.7:  [Laughter] Not always, just sometimes.

B.8:  Oh, yeah.  And what what kind of books do you read?

A.9:  Uh, just really different ones.  Uh, I have one that I was reading on, uh,
raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another
one on, uh, uh, uh, like a crime story [children].

B.10:  Oh yeah [children].

A.11:  A true crime story.

B.12:  Oh, do you like those detective stories?  [children].

A.13:  Yeah.  But this, it was a true one.  It was just a little different though.
[children] Reading that one last night.

B.14:  Oh, well that is interesting.  Actually, I like to read also, but, uh,
usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or
fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.

A.15:  Yeah, like my husband.

B.16:  Yeah [children].

A.17:  Yeah [children].

B.18:  Yeah, kind of one or the other.  Uh,  

A.19:  You must, uh, work for T I?

B.20:  I do.  Yes.

A.21:  Yeah, my husband does too.

B.22:  Yeah, and I am a computer scientist.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  But, I have a lot of other hobbies.

A.25:  Uh-huh, really.

B.26:  Well, yeah, I am kind of, uh, I guess what you would call it, a project
person.

A.27:  Oh, really.

B.28:  Yeah, and I love, like I have a shop and when things break around the
house, I always try to fix them myself and so, hobby, it's, its' funny, uh,
from the one stand point, it is work.  But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- to do.   #To find broken,#

A.31:  #Yeah, yeah.#  What kinds of things do you fix?

B.32:  Well, essentially anything you find in a house.  Uh, a stove, or oven or a
broken piece of porcelain or, uh, chipped tile on the floor.  I mean just
anything.

A.33:  Oh.  And you have a shop?

B.34:  Well it, it is not anything elaborate.  It is just a work bench and a
gazillion tools.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could #probably,#

A.37:  #Yeah,#  you can fix just about everything and anything.

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  Well, that is great.

B.40:  And in the car, I guess the car too.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  And so, uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.  Although,
sometimes it gets to be excessive.

A.43:  Yeah.  That is pretty much like my husband.  He is, he is pretty, uh,
mobile in that area too.  He, he works on the cars.  He rarely takes them in
--

B.44:  Yeah I,  

A.45:  -- and, uh, he works on irons, and all T V -s and stuff too.  We rarely
have to take those things in too.

B.46:  Right.  Yeah, I think it, it, not only can it be fun, but it can certainly
help your finances.

A.47:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.

B.48:  So, do you have any art, uh, how do I say it, creative or artistic
#hobbies?#

A.49:  #Uh.# Not really.  I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, uh,
holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.

B.50:  Oh yeah, well that's good.

A.51:  But, but, uh, not really [laughter].

B.52:  Yeah.  Well, I don't necessarily either.  I can plink out a song or two on
a piano --

A.53:  Oh.

B.54:  -- and I can, uh, I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art, I
guess --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- uh, graphic arts --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- is that what they call it, I can't do any of that, but sweat shirts is
certainly impressive.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  Uh, I belong to this organization for, uh, if, if you have
preschool children --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and, uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, uh, section for
the moms --

B.62:  Oh, yeah.

A.63:  -- and those are really neat and we learn to do the, uh, transfer pictures
[noise] on the sweatshirts --

B.64:  Oh, yeah.

A.65:  -- transfer photos --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and, uh, those are really neat.  So we learn different crafts like that
--

B.68:  I see.

A.69:  -- uh [noise],

B.70:  Well, that is neat [children].

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  I guess you could consider that a hobby.  Do you, do you cook for a hobby
or do you,

A.73:  No [laughter] I cook dinner  [laughter].

B.74:  [Laughter] That's not something you,  

A.75:  I don't consider it a hobby [laughter].

B.76:  I understand that.

A.77:  But, uh, you know, I no I am not a real  elaborate cook or anything like
that unfortunately.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  I like to bake off and on.  And usually once a week I will bake something,
but it's not anything elaborate, you know [laughter].

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  At least, I don't think it is.  

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  So,

B.84:  But, I think that still borders on hobby.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Probably the other thing I do which [noise] I am sure will sound horrible
to you, but is I program for fun.  Uh, on the computer.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  So, I have little projects [children] little computer projects going on
that I consider hobbies.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  But, drive my wife crazy.

A.91:  Oh.  Well good.  You have a computer at home?

B.92:  I do, yes.

A.93:  Oh, good.  Yeah.

B.94:  In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.

A.95:  Oh, #really.#

B.96:  #Not all of them# being mine.

A.97:  Wow.  Then you are busy [children].

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Uh-huh, that is very good.

B.100:  Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children [children] as being a
hobby?  [laughter].

A.101:  [Laughter] Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading,
and I stopped because it was so, it's the book is so detailed --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- and you have to, sometimes I have to go back and read the page over
again cause I didn't quite get it all.  And, uh, it is so detailed,
