A.1:  Okay, um, do you have any pets now?

B.2:  Well, we don't right now, no.  We've, uh, I grew up

A.3:  [Baby_talking]. 

B.4:  with, uh, with pets.  My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,

A.5:  [/Baby_talking]. 

B.6:  #some,#

A.7:  #Yeah.# 

B.8:  birds, but, uh, right now we don't have anything.

A.9:  Oh, okay.  Um, #that,#

B.10:  #What about# you?

A.11:  a matter of choice, or compulsion?

B.12:  Well, we've just, uh, it seems like,

A.13:  [Baby_talking]. 

B.14:  we've always been at a place [/baby_talking] where we'd have to go away for
the summer or something and, uh, #it was,#

A.15:  #Yeah.#

B.16:  never convenient to have anything.  (( )) we were thinking about getting a
dog if we get into a house.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Uh, someplace where there, you know, we can take care of it and everything.
We've #got,#

A.19:  #Yeah.#

B.20:  some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know,
a dog, I think and, 

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  What about you all?

A.23:  Well, right now [breathing] I'm a student, and campus housing does not even
allow thinking about that [laughter].

B.24:  Oh, no.

A.25:  No, we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.

B.26:  [Laughter] Is that right?

A.27:  Yeah.  They're very strict about it.

B.28:  But you like, uh, you like pets and things?

A.29:  Oh, I love animals.

B.30:  {Faint} ((Oh, yeah)).

A.31:  I was raised, [breathing] our house when I, when I was growing up there was
almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house.

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  #It was# al-, almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like
fifteen or twenty.  But, uh, always cats in the house.

B.34:  Oh, yeah.  We, #we,#

A.35:  #Oh.#

B.36:  enjoyed them.  We like, we like pets, but, uh, you know, you've got to deal
with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  And our kids are, we've got some children and they're not, not used to it,
you know, on a daily basis.  They, they, uh,

A.39:  How old are your kids?

B.40:  Oh, from fourteen down to seven.

A.41:  Okay.

B.42:  You sound like you've got some small ones in the background.

A.43:  One.

B.44:  Is #that right?#

A.45:  #Our# first.  He's about te-, eleven weeks now.

B.46:  Oh, great.

A.47:  #Yeah.#

B.48:  #Congratulations.#

A.49:  #Yeah.#

B.50:  #Where are# you from?

A.51:  Uh, originally?

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  West Virginia.

B.54:  Okay.

A.55:  Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but,

B.56:  I've been to Charleston.

A.57:  Charleston, West Virginia?

B.58:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.59:  Okay, that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern
quarter of the state, anyway? [noise].

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Okay, in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of
West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania [noise].

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  Right at the base of that northern peninsula --

B.64:  Uh-huh {faint}.

A.65:  -- is my hometown.

B.66:  Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting.  So it's really up north in the
country, really, #(( )).#

A.67:  #Yeah,#

B.68:  I guess #so.#

A.69:  #yeah.# It's, well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of
where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it --

B.70:  Gosh. 

A.71:  -- continued that far.

B.72:  I see.

A.73:  So,

B.74:  It's pretty nice country up there?

A.75:  Oh, it's beautiful.

B.76:  Hills, or what?

A.77:  Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly.  

B.78:  #Uh-huh.#

A.79:  #Um,# you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, #uh,#

B.80:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.81:  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops.

B.82:  Is it farmland?

A.83:  Um, not a lot of farmland there.  Mostly it's, uh, I mean, you know,
there's, you know, individuals with their own, own f-, uh, growing their own
food.  Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and
cattle.

B.84:  Oh, yes.

A.85:  And even that's, you know, small time mostly.

B.86:  Sure.

A.87:  Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry.

B.88:  #Uh-huh.#

A.89:  #It's# coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.

B.90:  Okay.

A.91:  Uh, aluminum plants.  There's like two aluminum plants #(( )).#

B.92:  #What are you,# [throat_clearing] what are you studying there at
((Heidelberg))?

A.93:  Computer engineering.

B.94:  {Faint}  Oh, yeah.  What year?

A.95:  Uh, just finished up my fourth semester.

B.96:  Well, great.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  Yeah.  I hope that works out well.

A.99:  Yeah, it's a big change. 

B.100:  {Faint} Yeah.

A.101:  #I spent,#

B.102:  #What's,#

A.103:  twenty years as a mechanic so,

B.104:  Oh, did you?

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  Well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force.

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  Yeah.  Are you, uh, shooting for a bachelor's now, or a master's, or what?

A.109:  I'm working on a bachelor's degree.

B.110:  Oh, okay, good.

A.111:  I'm working on a bachelor's #degree.  It'll be compu-,#

B.112:  #Hope it's a good program# there.

A.113:  Pardon?

B.114:  Hope it's a good program there.  

A.115:  Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out.

B.116:  #Yeah, good.#

A.117:  #That's# considered a pretty good program.  It's nice and small, which
means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to
wait or three or four s-, you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to
#get,#

B.118:  #Huh# {faint}.

A.119:  it again.  But, uh, i-, it's worth it once you get it.

B.120:  Well, yes, that's good.  And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio
and things.

A.121:  Oh, yeah, #yeah.#

B.122:  #Yeah# {faint}.

A.123:  Most the class are pretty small.

B.124:  Good.

A.125:  That works out real well.
	
B.126:  Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you
were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere, what would you get?

A.127:  Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a
puppy.

B.128:  Uh-huh.

A.129:  I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus.

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  Uh, had a hamster or two, and they, #they got,#

B.134:  #A hamster.#

A.135:  to be a lot of fun.

B.136:  Oh, yeah.

A.137:  Uh, it's amazing how much character,
