===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, now what is your favorite T V show?

@B.2:  Well, it was NEWHART and it is gone now and I miss it real bad [laughter].

A.3:  Well, can't you find anything else to, uh, to replace?

B.4:  Uh, yeah, I think so.  I like the new HOME IMPROVEMENT sitcom.  I like most
of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for half an hour.

A.5:  So you don't watch NORTHERN EXPOSURE?

B.6:  I do watch NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, uh, also for, for ever how many years it
has been on T V, I have been watching KNOTS LANDING.

A.7:  Oh, okay.  You are having to be in reruns for that one.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Have you seen BROOKLYN BRIDGE?

B.10:  No, I haven't see that one yet.

A.11:  That is one of the, it is so clean and so laid back and, uh, I am awful
tired of some of the things that they have on T V.  But this thirty minute
story is, I would certainly recommend that you try it.

B.12:  Uh, I don't know, but you know my wife watches all those RESCUE NINE ONE
ONES,

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  UNSOLVED MYSTERIES and,  

A.15:  Oh, okay.

B.16:  Drives me nuts.

A.17:  Well,

B.18:  I just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on.  It is
like too much real life.

A.19:  And I think it is a shame that our life has to be, I mean so many of the
tragedies that we have in the movies or on T V.  No we need something lighter
than that.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Have you seen, uh, I WILL FLY AWAY?

B.22:  I WILL FLY AWAY {very faint} I think I watched, that, that is where there,
there is a lawyer and he has a black nurse #or# --

A.23:  #Yes.#

B.24:  -- a nanny.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  I watched that once.  When, I think when it was the first episode, and it
just didn't grab my attention.

A.27:  Well.

B.28:  I felt like it was kind of, they were trying to copy TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
without all the suspense or something.

A.29:  Uh, it is not.  I don't know.  It's, it's clean.  It's there again you
don't have the violence and, uh, I am surprised that it is even still on
because coming at seven o'clock in the evening, that is when the children want
to watch --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- and that is not part of it.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  So, uh,  

B.34:  Actually, the best time of the year for me for watching T V is, is starts
around Christmas and will end in April and that is for the college basketball.

A.35:  Oh.

B.36:  Uh, I really get involved in that.  My wife played basketball since she was
in high school and college so that is something we can both watch and keep up
with.  It is pretty interesting at times.

A.37:  Well, uh, let's see.  I believe Texas lost last night.  Is that correct?

B.38:  You know I am not sure if Texas won or lost.  I can't I don't even keep up
with them.  My, uh, our son goes there.  I just don't keep up with them.

A.39:  Well, you don't have to [laughter].

B.40:  [Laughter] My favorite teams are back East and they seem to be the best
ones anyway.  So, 

A.41:  Well, don't you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad, but --

B.42:  Yeah, well Oklahoma is doing good this year.

A.43:  -- Oklahoma State though is, is the better of the two.  So,  

B.44:  Is that where you are from, Oklahoma?

A.45:  That is right, yeah.  I am a transplanted Te-, Okie.

B.46:  Well, aren't we all [laughter].

A.47:  Well, #we've.#

B.48:  #From somewhere.#

A.49:  From somewhere is correct.  So, I hope you can find enough T V to keep you
happy this winter.

B.50:  Well, there is always, actually, I will probably watch too much T V and,
and, uh, I think that probably effects me too just from watching too much.

A.51:  Well, I have recently retired and I find that this is the most boring thing
in the world, is to sit and watch T V.

B.52:  Well, I have been home a lot of the time myself and, uh, I don't work, and
I never ever turn the T V on during the day.

A.53:  Oh, you don't.  #Well,#

B.54:  #Huh-uh.# Just, I just something I can't do, I won't do and when someone
else is here during the day and like my son has been out of school for a
month, drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day.

A.55:  Well, it's oh it's nice to have the noise.

B.56:  Well,  

A.57:  Sometimes.  It is nice that you don't need that noise.

B.58:  I am just afraid that I won't get things done [laughter].

@@A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  If there is something there to keep me busy.

A.61:  Do you work out of the home?

B.62:  Uh, no, I have a medical problem and I don't, haven't worked for three
years.

A.63:  Oh.

B.64:  So, I just stay home and run errands, do chores, keep, you know do the
house work for my wife.  She still works and, uh --

A.65:  Okay.

B.66:  -- that sort of thing.  What kind of job did you have when you were
working?

A.67:  I was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service and it
was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk and I am awful sorry that I am no
longer gainfully employed.

B.68:  Yeah,
