============================================================================

A.1:  Well, have you got a topic?

@B.2:  Well, you know, there's, uh, the one that's burning in everybody's, uh, in
everybody's mind, the, uh, break up of the Soviet Union #and it's a,#

A.3:  #Yeah, I th-,# I, I think that's the obvious one, isn't it?

B.4:  ((Yeah,)) its, it affects here at home.  I mean, it's going to have
effects all over the world, and, uh, of course, you know, I expect, uh, in the
next few days when, uh, the president gives his, uh, State of the Union
address, he's going to have to, uh, pull some, uh, real drastic changes in
what he's doing to, to promote some, some movement and enthusiasm behind his
reelection race.

A.5:  Yeah.  Well, it, it's truly amazing [breathing] to, uh, see how rapidly,
um, uh, the Soviet Union [tapping] fell apart.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Uh, uh, and it makes me wonder.  I'm not saying that I'm, uh, I'm certainly
not a hawk necessarily, but it makes me wonder.  I've thought about this.  If
the idea of, uh, [breathing] the, the arms race, while granted, it has prac-,
practically bankrupted this country, uh, perhaps it did bankrupt, uh, Russia
and was, you know, as a, as a way of making a, a, a political change was
certainly preferable to a war.

B.8:  Yeah.  Well, th-, they, they focused all of their economic capacity on, on
the military.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  I mean, if they had focused the same capacity in their, uh, commercial
stuff, they would have been a lot better off as a society, probably.

A.11:  Yeah, ((with)) the right ki-, the Japanese, for example.

B.12:  Yes, like the Japanese, #right.#

A.13:  #Yeah.#  [throat_clearing]  Well --

B.14:  {Faint}  Yeah.

A.15:  -- I don't know, but we've, we've seen so many changes just in the past
five years, uh, it makes me think, or reminds me of that book, uh, FUTURE
SHOCK.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Where the, the future is coming at us, uh, at such an accelerated pace day
after day that only the most adaptable are going to be able to, uh, survive
and, and keep from just being overrun by the changes.

B.18:  Well, you know, f-, five years ago, could you have imagined in your, in
your, your wildest dreams that something, change as rapid as this would have
occurred?

A.19:  Oh, no, no.

B.20:  Uh, it's just, you know, it, it's almost unthinkable.

A.21:  It really is.

B.22:  It, it is (( )) I, I still wonder whether, you know, that it's going to be
stable, and then what's going to happen there.

A.23:  Well [throat_clearing] and that's just it.  I, I have s-, I have doubts
that, uh, that it can be stable.  Number one, you've got, uh, you know, you
see on the news the, the, the stories and, and the sights of these, these, the
Soviet people, these Russian people that are standing in line, uh, for hours
on end and for, you know, bare shelves at [throat_clearing] in these hugely,
you know, uh, higher prices that they have to pay now that government controls
are off [breathing].

B.24:  I don't think the shelves bare anymore.

A.25:  Oh, are they, are they ba-, are they, have they got some, #uh,#

B.26:  #I# think there's now, you know, I think all the time there were goods to
#to be distributed,#

A.27:  #But they're on the black market.#

B.28:  that were being held off.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And, #uh,#

A.31:  #[Lipsmack].#

B.32:  you know, I, I think that, uh, there's st-, but, but, you know, the, the
people don't have a lot of money to pay for them.  There, there's a
tremendous, uh, gap in their ability to, to supply themselves.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  That could create a tremendous amount of political st-, instability.  In
fact, they said tonight on the, on the radio, uh, that, uh, some, some leader
and, and, of the parliament in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially
throw out all of his ministers and replace them [noise] because of th-, this
tremendous supply, demand, uh, type gap that they have there.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Uh, I don't know.  It, it's, it's hard to imagine managing such a rapid
change.

A.37:  Yeah, and (( )) that's just it [throat_clearing]. It's, it's inconceiva-,
inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity, I don't care what it
is, could actually manage.  I mean, it would, it's kind of like damage control
and maybe putting out the biggest fires, but I don't think that it's really a
manageable, uh, uh, set of circumstances.

B.38:  Well, an-, and I think that, you know, we, we stand, uh, i-, in, in the
possibility of in-, of, of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here.
Uh, everybody is calling for, you know, this, th-, th-, this, uh, peace
dividend, and (( )) wi-, with an election year coming up, there's the, uh,
th-, there's the, the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to,
to appeal to the voters to, to, to get elected, but, you know, how, how
rapidly can they change and #how (( )),#

A.39:  #Well, as far as# I'm concerned, I can change pretty doggone rapidly, and
I'm all for something radical, because I think it's going to take something
radical to turn this country around.  Um,
