=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, now then you heard the question, #what# --

B.2:  #Uh-huh.#

A.3:  -- what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?

@B.4:  Well, I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy
to work on, than I do now.

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  I do, uh, I do the easy stuff now.  I change oil, uh, and then what some
people would consider a little more difficult, I, I'll change spark plugs and
--

A.7:  Um.

B.8:  -- I'll change, you know, points and, you, you know, do air filters, that
kind of stuff.

A.9:  Well.

B.10:  But, uh, I can't do as much as I used to, um, I used to do a whole lot
more, but not any more, they're just too weird to work on now.

A.11:  [Laughter] Is that the reason you're not doing it, or are you so busy you
don't have time to do it?

B.12:  Well, that's part of it --

A.13:  Uh.

B.14:  -- yeah, part of it is, like you said, I don't have time.

A.15:  Okay.  Well being a female and being alone, you, I don't do anything but
put gasoline, 

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  in my car, and let someone else check the oil even. 

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  But, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?

B.20:  Well, um, on this car I've got now, no, but I had a van before, and it was
only two years old, and it had transmission go out on it.

A.21:  Oh.

B.22:  But fortunately that was covered under the warranty.

A.23:  Okay.  Well, you should be, feel very fortunate.  I had to have a
transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile --

B.24:  Um.

A.25:  -- and I'll declare, that's an expensive.

B.26:  Oh, yeah.

A.27:  Yes, uh-huh.  

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter] Maybe I should have just traded the car in.

B.30:  Yeah, sometimes it makes you wonder.  

A.31:  Oh, it just, well, I have a very comfortable car --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So, um, anyway, I have a new transmission, 

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  and I'm sure that any of them would have cost al-, or charged me almost
the same amount.  But --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- it hurts, 

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  it hurts real bad.

B.42:  Did you take it to a dealership?

A.43:  No, I took it to an independent --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- out in Garland.

B.46:  Oh, I see.

A.47:  I had, um, these people were recommended by a neighbor --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and, you know, that's the only thing, I am not a native of Dallas.

B.50:  Oh, I see.

A.51:  So that means I have to depend on, on trustworthy friends --

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  -- and that's.  Anyway, it's fixed, it's running, and I pray that I get my
thirteen hundred dollars out of it.

B.54:  Oh, gosh.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  It's going to run for a li-, for a while yet.

A.57:  Oh, I know it.

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  It certainly is frightening.  What work are you in?

B.60:  Uh, I, I work for T I.  

A.61:  Oh.

B.62:  I, I work in the networking area.

A.63:  Okay, okay.  

B.64:  Do you work for T I?

A.65:  No.

B.66:  No, okay.

A.67:  No, I have just retired from, um, the Southwest Medical Center.

B.68:  Oh.

A.69:  Yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my
car, but they're all too busy.  So.

B.70:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.71:  I have to [laughter] do it the other way, and that's find someone and pay
them to do it.

B.72:  Yeah, yeah.

@@A.73:  So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year.

B.74:  Oh, yeah, I'm, I'm planning on it.  Oh, it can't be any worse than last
year, that's for sure.

A.75:  Oh, it could be, 

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  but I don't much think so [laughter].

B.78:  Yeah.  That's true, that's true.

A.79:  I'm, well, we're starting out a new one, so let's make it a good one.

B.80:  Yeah, I'm going to try and plan on it.

A.81:  Okay.

B.82:  All right, well, I enjoyed the conversation.

A.83:  Thank you.

B.84:  All right, #thank you.#

A.85:  #Bye.#  Bye-bye.

B.86:  Bye-bye.
