==========================================================================

A.1:   What are your favorite T V shows?  

@B.2:   Uh, I guess one of my favorite ones is CHEERS.  

A.3:   Yeah.  

B.4:   I always liked that one.  They're always so funny.  And -- 

A.5:   Yeah.  

B.6:   -- I also like the COSBY SHOW [laughter].  

A.7:   Yeah.  

B.8:   Those are probably my two favorites.  

A.9:  Yeah, I, I, I rather enjoy the COSBY SHOW.  My wife and I both like COMMISH.

B.10:  You know, I've watched that one time and it was really good, but now that's
on, what, Saturday night?

A.11:   Uh,

B.12:   Is it Saturday night?  

A.13:  It's either Friday night, it's either tonight or tomorrow night.  Uh,
around here at least.

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   I guess -- 

B.16:   I can't,

A.17:   -- it depends on what channel you're getting.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  

A.19:   You know, what system you're getting it through.  

B.20:  Yeah.  I, yeah, I saw it one time and I really liked it, but I just
haven't, uh, seen it, you know, watched it since.

A.21:  Uh, we, we always enjoyed it.  It, it seems to be kind of halfway between,
uh, something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and, uh, HILL STREET BLUES.

B.22:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.23:   I-, i-, i-, it's a good show.  

B.24:  Yeah, the episode that I watched, uh, I liked him because even though he's
a law enforcement officer, you know, sometimes --

A.25:   You t-,

B.26:   -- the laws are kind of ridiculous -- 

A.27:   Yeah.  

B.28:  -- and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a
good reason [laughter].

A.29:   Yeah.  

B.30:   And he seems to do that sometimes [laughter].  

A.31:   H-, he's tender hearted fellow.  

B.32:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.33:  Yeah.  I think that's what first drew us to him, the, uh, [laughter] the,
the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours.

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   But, uh,

B.36:   Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good show.  

A.37:   Yeah, uh,

B.38:  I always like, I, I like to watch like SIXTY MINUTES and TWENTY TWENTY.

A.39:  [Baby_crying] Yeah, uh, I know we, uh, we watch COMMISH any chance we get.

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:  Uh, [baby_crying] used to be a big fan of STAR TREK, but that's kind of,
th-, th-, it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against, uh,
anything spiritual.

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   But, uh, anyway,

B.44:   I've never gotten into the STAR TREK era [laughter].  

A.45:  Yeah, I, I used to be a, used to be a real big fan of STAR TREK.

B.46:   Used to be a Trekie, huh [laughter]?  

A.47:   Uh, pretty much, yeah.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   I always enjoyed the show anyway [baby_crying].  

B.50:   Yeah.  

A.51:   And STAR TREK's in a s-, or the, uh, STAR WARS set -- 

B.52:   Uh-huh.  

A.53:   -- uh, one of the first STAR WARS movie?  

B.54:   Yeah.  

A.55:   I think I watched it some-, like nineteen times.  

B.56:   Oh, my goodness.  You must have some of their lines memorized
[laughter].  

A.57:   Uh, I did at one time [throat_clearing].  

B.58:   [Laughter]. 

A.59:   Anyway,

B.60:   Wow [laughter].  

A.61:  [Noise] Oh, I u-, I was a pretty big fan of that sort of thing.

B.62:   Yeah.  

A.63:  Used to, used to read a, read a lot of science fiction work, too.

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:  But, uh, no, it, uh, we don't do a whole lot of T V watching, but that, uh,
I don't know if you heard them or not, I got a twelve year old, twelve week
old baby.

B.66:   Twelve week, oh, I was --

A.67:   Uh-huh.

B.68:   -- going to say, I hear a baby in the background [laughter]. 

A.69:   Yeah, that, between --

B.70:   I imagine --

A.71:   -- #that and school it's not#,

B.72:   -- #that keeps you busy#.  

A.73:   Between him and school, there's not much time left for -- 

B.74:   Yeah.  

A.75:   -- watching much T V.  

B.76:  Well, we're, we're [baby_crying] expecting our first in about three months,
so I know we won't be watching as much as we do now [laughter].

A.77:  Yeah, this one here is our first.  And we're both full time students so,

B.78:   Oh, wow.  

A.79:   Yeah.  

B.80:   That must be tough.  

A.81:   What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?    

B.82:   It doesn't matter, just a healthy baby.  

A.83:  That, that's, that's the best way, you haven't found out yet or anything,
have you?

B.84:   Well, we had a sonogram, but we told him not to tell us, so --

A.85:   Yeah.  

B.86:   -- it's going to be a surprise [laughter].   

A.87:   That's the best way.  

B.88:   Yeah.  

A.89:  I mean, it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're going to get
for Christmas.  I mean, you know, 

B.90:   Yeah [laughter].  It's, it's not -- 

A.91:   It's not as much -- 

B.92:   -- quite the same.  

A.93:   -- fun.  Oh.  

B.94:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.95:   Anyway,

B.96:  I agree [laughter].  I'm sure we'll be watching more, uh, children oriented
television shows.

A.97:   Oh, I'm about half kid at heart anyway.  

B.98:   Oh, I am, too.  

A.99:   I, I,

B.100:  I still watch cartoons sometimes, every once in a while [laughter], when my
sister comes to visit so, 

A.101:  The new cartoons don't seem to be worth much, but the, uh, well, a couple
of the, uh, ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but,

B.102:  Well, you know, it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than
they used to be.

A.103:   Oh, yeah.  

B.104:  You know, I remember, like, the FLINTSTONES and the JETSONS and --

A.105:   Yeah.  

B.106:   -- those were just kind of good old cartoons.  

A.107:  The, the, the worst of the violence in the FLINTSTONES was when somebody
gave Fred a poke in the snoot.

B.108:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.109:   But, oh, shoot, I mean, blowing up galaxies and -- 

B.110:   Yep.  

A.111:  -- and putting a curse on the whole planet, or, or, or you know, or on all
the, you know, everything of this species, you know, just all kinds of crud
[noise].

B.112:  Yeah, and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
[laughter].

A.113:   Yeah, everything's mutations and, and -- 

B.114:   Yeah.  

A.115:   -- and killing and,

B.116:   Uh-huh.   

A.117:  Gone are the days of those things they use-, what was it I, uh, T N, Turner
Broadcasting Network used to, used to, uh, do the Saturday morning and Sunday
morning cartoons, the old cartoons.  They used to put between the first and
second fea-, feature at the theatre.

B.118:   Uh-huh.  

A.119:  Those old little ten minute jobs where, uh, the real ballooned looking art
work, you know --

B.120:   Uh-huh.  

A.121:   -- a-, and,
