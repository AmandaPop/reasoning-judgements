========================================================================

A.1:  Did you hear our topic?  It's in regards to discussing homes.

B.2:  Homes, yes, sir, uh-huh.  What are, are you settled in a place?

@A.3:  Yeah, I'm settled in a place.  I've been in it for twelve years, since
nineteen, uh, actually thirteen years, since nineteen seventy-eight and it's
in Richardson, Texas, which is north Texas --

B.4:  ((Right)) {faint}.

A.5:  -- or north Dallas.  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  And we've lived in two houses in Richardson.  We moved here in seventy-four
[throat_clearing] and, uh, changed locations in seventy-eight.

B.8:  Okay.  

A.9:  How about yourself?  

B.10:  Well, we, uh, left here in seventy-six.  Uh, we were here for a few years,
then we, uh, have come back just this summer.  Right now we're looking for
housing, uh, somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area.  Are you
familiar with that?

A.11:  Yeah, it's a nice area.  

B.12:  Yeah, it is.  The kids are in school here in Duncanville.  We're in a
temporary place right now and, uh, so they've enjoyed the school, so we're
kind of trying to stay here but, 

A.13:  Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or,

B.14:  Well, what, the problem we got is that we've got five children --

A.15:  Oh, boy.  

B.16:  -- [Laughter] and so, uh, we really want [noise] four or five bedroom house
and, uh, you know, everybody says, you know, how many houses are on the market
and --

A.17:  R-, right.  

B.18:  -- all that kind of thing so we, uh, we look at the paper, we look at our,
talk to our realtor and you can cut, you know, the listings, uh, in about a
third when you go from three to four bedrooms --

A.19:  Sure.   

B.20:  -- you know, or five.  Are you looking or you settled, I mean,

A.21:  No, we're settled and, uh -- 

B.22:  H-, having,

A.23:  -- we're, uh, I'm probably older than you, I'm fifty-two, but anyway, I, my
youngest is getting married this year --

B.24:  Oh, great.  

A.25:  -- graduating college, so I can board up their rooms, 

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  and [laughter] look forward to retirement maybe.  

B.28:  That empty nest syndrome is going to set in, I guess.  

A.29:  Oh, gosh, so, we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and --

B.30:  Great.  

A.31:  -- maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere.  

B.32:  Okay.  

A.33:  Closer, closer to our families.  

B.34:  Okay, you, are you from Florida originally?  

A.35:  No, from West Virginia but everyone's, uh, my wife's parents are from the
New York, New Jersey area --

B.36:  Yeah {faint}.  

A.37:  -- so, but everyone seems, uh, has seem to relocated down that area.

B.38:  Oh, yeah.  

A.39:  Seems like a nice place to go [laughter].  

B.40:  Yeah, yeah.  We've got five and the oldest is, uh, ninth grade and the
youngest is second grade and I think they're going to be, uh, with us forever.

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  I don't know if that's true, but it's sure, you know, we're not anywhere
near looking to, uh, uh, cut down in size.  We're, we're --

A.43:  Oh, I -- 

B.44:  -- trying to -- 

A.45:  -- understand.  

B.46:  -- find,

A.47:  You need very minimum four and probably five.  

B.48:  Oh, yeah.  In fact, six would be real good.  

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  My wife and I can share a bedroom [laughter].  

A.51:  It's tough --

B.52:  Either,

A.53:  -- to find a five and six room, bedroom house, isn't it?

B.54:  Oh, I don't think it's possible unless you, you know, multimillionaire,
something like that.

A.55:  Oh, I know.  

B.56:  Uh,

A.57:  Seems like you get in that category, you're in the three hundred thousand
dollar homes or whatever and it's --

B.58:  Oh, yeah.  

A.59:  -- that's an awful lot, you know [laughter].  

B.60:  Yeah, it is, yeah.  

A.61:  (( )).

B.62:  Uh, we're having, actually, if we find something for, uh, I'd say less than
a hundred and twenty thousand, we'll be doing all right, #you know.#

A.63:  #Right.#  

B.64:  That's, uh, but I think the thing's out there, it's just a matter of, uh --

A.65:  Just,

B.66:  -- you know, looking --  

A.67:  Matter --

B.68:  -- ((you know)) --

A.69:  -- of looking, right.  

B.70:  -- finding the right place, uh,

A.71:  Lot of people will buy, in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and
convert maybe the garage or something or the, or do something.  I had a young
lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had, uh,
there were seven kids in her family.

B.72:  Wow.  

A.73:  And they converted the dining room and, 

B.74:  [Laughter]. 

A.75:  [Laughter] did this and that, but they always seemed to get along fine,
you know.

B.76:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think once we get into a place, it will be just fine,
but --

A.77:  Oh, sure.  

B.78:  -- you know, it's until then, it's, uh, oh, a little stressful, you know,
just looking all the time and that sort of thing.

A.79:  Oh, I know and it's, there's nothing harder than that.  I always just sort
of a, assign my wife that chore, then I would let her narrow it down to three
or four, then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than
men do.

B.80:  Oh, yeah.  

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  Maybe that's the case.  At least she's got more opinions, you know,
there's, uh, seems like there's more constraints --

A.83:  Yes.  

B.84:  -- more things that she thinks about.  You know, openness, uh, the size of
the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would --

A.85:  Why, certainly.  

B.86:  -- probably gloss over and,

A.87:  [Laughter]. 

B.88:  maybe even ignore, you know.  

A.89:  #I# --

B.90:  #So.#

A.91:  -- understand that.  

B.92:  What kind of business are you in?  

A.93:  I'm in the, uh, sporting goods business.  I'm a manufacturer's rep.  I
represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies.

B.94:  Oh, yeah, great.  

A.95:  What, who are you with?  

B.96:  Uh, we're with an organization called, uh, Wycliff Bible Translators.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  It's a, a missions organization and, uh, doing, uh, translation,
linguistics, that sort of thing.

A.99:  Well, great.  

B.100:  Uh, it's got an office down here in, uh, in, near Duncanville and we just
moved down to be on staff down here so.

A.101:  How, how was the, uh, s-, you say you lived in the Denver area before?

B.102:  Right.  

A.103:  How did that compare with this area as far as house-, housing prices?

B.104:  Uh, we were, uh, really surprised to find that they're higher here.
#Uh,# 

A.105:  #No kidding.#  

B.106:  When we moved from Louisiana to Denver, it was astounding, you know, to
find that prices were, oh, I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd
expected.  And then, uh, to come down here, we thought things would be lower,
and they're not.  I guess, uh, really, prices for housing are just,
