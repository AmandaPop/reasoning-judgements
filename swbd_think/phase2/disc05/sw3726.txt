============================================================================

A.1:  Did you see in the newspaper or on the news when, uh, President Bush
fainted at a dinner?  Was that in Japan?

B.2:  That was in Japan.  Uh, I did not get to see that.  Uh, we had just gotten
back yesterday from vacation --

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  -- and so I was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and, uh, I
didn't get to watch any television [laughter].  So I have just been finding
out about this since I got back.

A.5:  Well, I thought it pretty scary.  I, I missed it, uh, I mean when, when
they were rerunning it like the next day or something.  I mean I didn't hear
about it on the day it happened.  Uh, it was interesting you know that, uh,
when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table [laughter] (( )).
It's really amazing that that would happen and then, of course, all the Dan
Quayle discussion comes up again.

B.6:  Yeah.  Well, I was kind of pleased that, uh, when I got back that that was
the hot item on the news, but, uh, that the President had fainted at dinner
because that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter] That is true.  That is real good.  Well he, you know, for as
young as he is he seem to, uh, have several health problems.  You know, health
incidences, if not problems.

B.8:  Yeah.  Well, you need about three kids running around the house and in, uh,
you would have your share of health problem too [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter] Uh, right.  That's right.  Well, I, uh, I guess I have not
really been, I have been trying to tune out a lot of the political issues
right now, when, because the campaigning is starting --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  --  and, uh, so.

B.12:  Well, I think the key issue that is going at the moment is the, uh, current
economy --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and I think there is a lot of things that need to be done to rectify
that situation.  I am not sure that the government is the key player.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  Uh --

A.17:  It is scary.

B.18:  -- I think one of the statements that was made, uh, a year ago by, uh,
Gorbachev, when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the
Soviet Union, he made the comment, he said, well our country may be bankrupt,
but referring to the United States, he said, your schools are bankrupt --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- and, uh, that's been a big concern for me.  And I noticed that, uh, when
I go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic
Chemistry or something like that --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- that, uh, you don't find very many white American males,

A.23:  [Throat_clearing]

B.24:  taking the tough courses.

A.25:  Right, the foreign #students.#

B.26:  #You find# a lot of Asian students, uh, you find a lot of females in the
class --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and in all of the tough courses that I have taken, the only blacks that
I have found in the class have, uh, have generally been from Nigeria or some
other African country.  They are foreign students, and, it's I think it's kind
of pathetic that, uh, our kids are not motivated to, uh, to study in depth,
and, uh, to take the hard courses.

A.29:  Well, #they think.# 

B.30:  #And# I am concerned that that is our economic problem, not, not how much
money is being spent at Christmas time.

A.31:  Well, that is really true, uh, but, I have noticed from, uh, my
associations with teenagers [swallowing] in high school that they are really
motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about
people being laid off and, uh, you know, corporations and things I mean, I
feel like they don't want to make the effort out of their own personal
interests to follow a particular field or --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- they want to think, you know, how quickly can they make money [talking]
[inhaling] and they are not attracted by the work that has to be done to
achieve, uh, you know a position like that.

B.34:  Yeah.  Well, I know when I went through school, uh, I went through an
engineering school and of all my [/talking] close friends, they were all there
because they loved engineering.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  They loved building things.  They loved solving problems, uh, they liked,
you know, being creative and there was another group of students there that
were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of
money.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  And we didn't mix very well.  There was a total difference in attitude
and we felt very [laughter] isolated or [inhaling], uh, discriminated against
and not being, you know, separate classes in terms of attitude.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  Well you are right when you say that, uh, the important issues
need to be not s-, as much what is going on other places.  I mean that it is
important for us to do.  I mean we can't be isolated here, but, uh, you know,
we do need to pay more attention to our own economy --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and our civilization because we have seen how quickly and it is almost
unbelievable, the fall of the Soviet #Union# --

B.42:  #Yeah.#

A.43:  -- and the, uh, Berlin Wall and all of that.  It is almost unreal to me
still [inhaling].

B.44:  Well, that was a terribly precarious economy, uh, I have been kind of
watching it over the years and observing that the amount of bureaucracy over
there.
