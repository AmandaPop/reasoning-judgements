============================================================================

A.1:  I don't know about you, but I haven't had any trouble having any fun on
vacation.

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  I can't think of any place I wouldn't want to go to take one [laughter].

B.4:  Well, where are some of the places you've been?  

A.5:  Oh, I know a real good place is Virginia.  It's real nice.  It has
mountains, beach, whatever you want.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  Have you been in any great places lately?  

B.8:  Well, I've been a lot of different places.  Uh, Hawaii -- 

A.9:  Oh, now, I haven't been --  

B.10:  -- Japan -- 

A.11:  -- there.  

B.12:  -- Europe and most of the fifty.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  I haven't been to Alaska yet.  

A.15:  Oh, really?  You plan on going?  

B.16:  Yeah, I thought we might go up on the, uh, inland ferry that goes up there
from, uh --

A.17:  Oh, yeah.  

B.18:  -- from, B-,

A.19:  Now I'd like to go, uh, to Canada on the boat.  

B.20:  Right.  

A.21:  My parents went not long ago.  Or to Key West.  Have you ever been to Key
West?

B.22:  Yes.  

A.23:  Is it pretty?  

B.24:  Oh, yeah, it's a long desolate stretch, but [laughter], well --

A.25:  Oh, really?  

B.26:  -- desolate in that it's all, uh, the same scenery after a while.  Just
like driving in the desert, you know [laughter].

A.27:  Oh, no. 

B.28:  After a while it all looks the same.   

A.29:  No, I've never been.  Huh.  Is it very expensive?  

B.30:  No, no.  

A.31:  Not compared to Hawaii, huh?  

B.32:  Well, actually Hawaii is getting cheap, too, #because# -- 

A.33:  #Really?#  

B.34:  -- uh, with the economic, uh, s-, uh, situation we're in, they've lowered
the prices, uh --

A.35:  Well, that's nice to know.  

B.36:  -- quite a bit.  

A.37:  Well, that's good.  

B.38:  Where do you stay when you go to Virginia, on the beach?  

A.39:  Uh, yeah, I've been to Virginia Beach and I've been up to the, uh,
homestead and, uh, hot springs in the mountains.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  It's real nice.  And, uh, [lipsmack] oh, let's see, I've been to
Charlottesville, ((through)) Monticello.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  Uh, my husband's a, a landscape architect and he, uh, he really liked that.

B.44:  Yeah, I bet.  

A.45:  And to see Thomas Jefferson's home.  

B.46:  Well if he's a landscape architect, he ought to like Washington, D C in
the daylight hours.

A.47:  Yeah, now, we, we went there.  Went there to stay at the Army Navy club
with my dad.  And that was real nice, that was real nice.

B.48:  Your dad's in the military?  

A.49:  Uh, no, he used to be.  

B.50:  Retired?  

A.51:  He, he's a retired attorney now.  Uh, but he was the, uh, he  was, uh, uh,
[lipsmack] in the Reserves for quite  a long  time  and, uh, he's active in
something right now.  I forgot what it is [laughter].  That's how close I am
[laughter].  No, I don't mean that [laughter].  But, uh, uh, he's somehow
connected still with it.

B.52:  Well, being from, uh, uh, living in Texas, you probably like cool weather
on your, uh, vacations.  At least we do.

A.53:  Yeah, some-, sometimes.  You know, when it, in, when it's getting really
hot in Texas --

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  -- you know, you want to go someplace cool.  

B.56:  Well, usually vacation time, July, August, September, it's time to go
somewhere --

A.57:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.58:  -- else [laughter].  

A.59:  Have you ever been to Arkansas?  

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  

A.61:  Now I've, I've been, but not to way up at near Branson.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  Oh, I hear it's just booming up there now.  

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  Up around silv-, sil-, Silver Dollar City.  Have you been there?

B.66:  No, no, I haven't.  

A.67:  I heard on, uh, what was it, SIXTY MINUTES or something a lot of the
country western, uh, people are starting to build their nightclubs, 

B.68:  [Cough].

A.69:  up there.  

B.70:  Yeah, I saw the SIXTY MINUTES also.  

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  Last year we went to, uh, the Oregon coast.  

A.73:  Oh --

B.74:  A-,  

A.75:  -- really?  

B.76:  And that is really beautiful.  

A.77:  Really?  

B.78:  And it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that
you don't have, uh, the surfers much because they need protective clothing,
you know [laughter].

A.79:  How about population?  Is it very, uh -- 

B.80:  And, uh,   

A.81:  -- crowded?  

B.82:  There's really, uh, several nice places to stay along the coast there.

A.83:  Huh.

B.84:  We stayed at what was called the, uh, kite capital of the world.  What was
the name of that c-, place [laughter]? {to someone else in the room} Lincoln
City.

A.85:  Oh. 

B.86:  And it is really nice.  Uh, we a very -- 

A.87:  #Oh, I bet.#  

B.88:  -- #nice place# on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to
California particularly.

A.89:  Really, I bet.  

B.90:  S-, in fact --

A.91:  #I bet# --

B.92:  -- #most of the,# 

A.93:  -- it's not as crowded either.

B.94:  That's right.  Most of the Californians that, uh, want to stay on the coast
apparently, the families and so forth, they come up to Oregon and Washington
coast to stay because --

A.95:  Huh.  

B.96:  -- it's much, uh, more economical.  

A.97:  Yeah, I'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see.  

B.98:  Yeah, we've, we've been up that way and, well, this, that trip we also went
to, uh, Vancouver and out to, uh --

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  -- Victoria which is very nice.  

A.101:  Well, I think the furthest west I've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon.

B.102:  Well, you got s-, you haven't been to California, either, then?

A.103:  No, huh-uh.  No.  

B.104:  Well, if you go to California, don't go to Los Angeles [laughter] --

A.105:  Oh, I won't.  

B.106:  -- unless you really want to just see the movie stars set -- 

A.107:  No, no.  

B.108:  -- up and so forth.  

A.109:  No [laughter].  

B.110:  But, uh, San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice.  

A.111:  Really?  

B.112:  Right.  

A.113:  I know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago, and they said
it was real ni-,
