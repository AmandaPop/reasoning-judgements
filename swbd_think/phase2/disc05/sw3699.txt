============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, do you live in a home?

@B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  We, we, it's a house we bought, uh, about two and a half years ago now.

A.5:  Oh, did you?

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  First house.

A.9:  We've lived in ours for about six years.  We had it built, actually.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And, uh, uh, it's our first home, too.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  So what do you think of, of owning a home as opposed to, to renting
somebody else's?

A.15:  Um, well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- we were living in, and, um, that was quite an experience [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter].

A.19:  I, I much prefer having my own home and, and, uh, just the space and, and
more privacy.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  Do you have, is it a fairly large house?

A.23:  Um, it's, uh, uh, it's like twenty-four fifty square feet.

B.24:  Oh, that's pretty good size.  Yeah.

A.25:  It's a two story.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Yeah.  How about yours?

B.28:  It's tiny.

A.29:  Is it small?

B.30:  It's not much bigger.  Actually we had an apartment, two bedroom apartment
that was about as big as this house is.  So.

A.31:  Oh, really.

B.32:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's only like eleven hundred square feet.

A.33:  Oh, uh-huh.  Do you, do you have children?

B.34:  Just one.

A.35:  Just one.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  But, it, it, uh, all the rooms are small, I mean, but it ends up giving us
three bedrooms, which we wanted.  And, uh.  Use an extra one for an office --

A.39:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.40:  -- which is handy.  

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  I'd rather have, have more rooms and less space in each one I guess.
Rather have lots of rooms and lot-, lots of space, but, uh, that ends up
costing me.

A.43:  Oh yeah, 

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  yeah.  Well, like, um, how does it compare to the ones in your
neighborhood?  [laughter].

B.46:  Well, they're, it's pretty typical, I mean, it's a very, very middle class
neighborhood.  Uh, lots of, lots of young couples with, you know, usu-, oh,
I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first
homes --

A.47:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and, uh, lots of kids and stuff, and, so it, it fits well, in the
neighborhood.  It's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood, but on
the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban --

A.49:  Yeah. 

B.50:  -- little bit more than I want.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  Is, is yours also --

A.53:  Uh.

B.54:  -- pretty #much in conformance with the neighborhood# --

A.55:  #Yeah, it, it,# --

B.56:  -- or is it?

A.57:  -- it, it does, it, it seems about, oh, probably average.  Um.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  But our neighborhood has a, just a wide variety of, of, um, people, and,
you know, there's older people here, and, and, um, people that are our, our
age, we're in our thirties.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And, um, there's a lot of kids, a lot of kids.  (( )) People across the
street have eight.

B.62:  Uh-huh, wow, eight kids?

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Oh, my gosh.

A.65:  Yeah, their home just burned down --

B.66:  Ooh.

A.67:  -- matter of fact, and, um, last summer, and they're just rebuilding and,
um, their house is going to be really big [laughter].  It's.

B.68:  I'm sure, with eight, gosh.

A.69:  Yeah, they're building a lot bigger.  He's, uh, um, uh, oh, not an
obstetrician, an, an orthopedic surgeon.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And, um, so since the house did burn, they're, they're going, it's quite
different than it was before, and it's --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- it's a lot bigger.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  And, um, but ours is about, it's, you know, it's a nice home, it's
definitely not one of the, the smaller ones, and, um, it's not the biggest
either.  But.

B.76:  Yeah, new ones, I mean, they, they tend to, to be real tiny, but that uh,
especially in newer neighborhoods, my, my brother just built a new house.  He
lives in Wichita, Kansas, and the, um, the neighborhood actually fought him on
it, because he, he was, um, the house was going to cost less to build than any
other house in the neighborhood.

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  Now, that's because he was, he's doing a lot of it himself --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- and, you know, for example, landscaping and, and lots of the other
stuff, and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots [laughter] (( ))
in the neighborhood, but --

A.81:  Yeah.  You.

B.82:  -- but they were, they were pretty touchy on it.  He was a little
surprised.

A.83:  You know, that's interesting you say that, because we do have, we have
those architectural codes here --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- and when we, um, put out house in, um, they wanted us to have, there was
one, we have part siding --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- on, on the two story part and then --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- on the back, and, they, there was one side where our chimney was, and
just the chimney was going to be brick, and they wanted us to have more brick,
so we ended up having to go halfway up --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- which, it does look nicer, and, you know, we would have like to have had
all brick, but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it, and, but, it's
funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have
any brick at all.

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  So it's kind of like, they were.

B.94:  Kind of depends on when they get in, you know.

A.95:  Yeah, yeah, and, I, and so it was kind of like it's they, ours is the last
street that they built on.  So the houses actually on our street are a little
bit, they're kind of gone a little bit nicer.

B.96:  Oh, they have, it's gotten, yeah.

A.97:  Yeah, I mean, just --

B.98:  Yeah, oh.

A.99:  -- they, you know, it's like the second phase --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- and, and so they've kind of changed the, the codes a little bit, and so
that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were --

B.102:  Um.

A.103:  -- other homes that didn't have any.

B.104:  Well, see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they,
they moved into a neighborhood and bought a, a real nice stone house down in
South Austin.

A.105:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.106:  And, uh, and, the, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they, they
do phase one, and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly
controlled, uh, codes and, and, and stuff, and then they come back in, and,
and then they sell,
