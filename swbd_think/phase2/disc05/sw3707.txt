==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie.

B.2:  Do you?

A.3:  Yeah.  It's about, oh, about six months old, and we're try-, we live in an
apartment, so, we don't have a yard, so it has to stay inside and we're having
a difficult time trying to train it.

B.4:  How old is it?

A.5:  It's about six months.

B.6:  Uh, you, you're, you're in the roughest stages of #pet# --

A.7:  #Really?#

B.8:  -- ownership, I think.

A.9:  [Inhaling] But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs, but I guess
every one, one [laughter] one, one of them, or every once in a while, you get
one that's not so [laughter] intelligent --

B.10:  Well.

A.11:  -- because this one, it.

B.12:  I don't, I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence,
really, the, the, the training bit, uh.  I've had dogs through the years.
Right now I've got two, and three cats, but, uh, and my son and
daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix, and we watched it this summer for
two to three months, and it wasn't trained quite fully either --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and, uh, but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog.

A.15:  Yeah, so how'd you all, how do you, what's the best method?

B.16:  I don't know.  I, I'm old fashioned, and when I got my, my dogs, when they,
when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  They say that's not the way to do it now. 

A.19:  [Throat_clearing].

B.20:  You're just supposed to --

A.21:  Stand outside with them #until they.#

B.22:  -- #No,# just, just, put them outside, I guess.  Unless you ca-, catch them
in the act.

A.23:  Well, we're hardly ever at home, so it's --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- kind of difficult, and, you know, you don't want to, you don't want to
spank it or scare it, or anything like that, so.

B.26:  No, no, you don't want to do that, but, uh.

A.27:  Yeah, we, we try to take it, you know, it gets, it gets frustrating when
you take it outside and, you know --

B.28:  #Does, does it just want to sniff around?#

A.29:  -- #and then it runs right# inside and it does it.  Huh?

B.30:  Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside?

A.31:  Yeah, a lot of times, and --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- you know, it won't it's little job [laughter] outside #and it comes
inside.#

B.34:  #Have you praised# it and given it a treat maybe when it does something
outside?

A.35:  Uh, yeah, we've tried that, and, uh, you know, there's certain spots in the
house where he likes to --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- go, so, and he chews on plants and all that, but, you know, that's
#natural# --

B.38:  #That's nothing,# huh.

A.39:  -- for a little puppy.  #Huh?#

B.40:  #Well,# it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you.  I,
I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever, and she's
gone the other way, because she's so old, she doesn't have much control --

A.41:  Oh, really.

B.42:  -- so we're battling with that problem --

A.43:  Oh, that's sad.

B.44:  -- and she still feels good.  Uh, she can't hear worth a darn or see very
well, but she's got a great appetite, and she knows we're there,

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  by smell.

A.47:  How old is it?

B.48:  She'll be sixteen in May.

A.49:  Man --

B.50:  And --

A.51:  -- that's sad.

B.52:  -- yeah, but we can't bear to do anything because --

A.53:  Oh, of course not.

B.54:  -- she's been our friend for all these years, so --

A.55:  I couldn't.

B.56:  -- we're putting up with all her accidents, and the la-, two nights ago,
she had diarrhea, and so that was a bad one.  But, uh, I think we're buying a
carpet [laughter] shampooer this weekend [laughter].

A.57:  That is really sad.  What, what's the deal, we, we try to, we're trying to
take it on walks now, you know --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- and [laughter] so it, I mean this dog really feels like it's being
killed or something when you try to, you know, tug on it to walk it.  I mean,
it just goes like a mad dog, I mean it just jumps up and down and starts
#yapping, and# --

B.62:  #Does it,# oh.

A.63:  -- it's, you know, [throat_clearing] I mean, it's [laughter] not even close
to even --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- being trained on a leash.

B.66: You know, maybe you nee-, you can get it signed up this spring or summer
for some of the dog obedience classes.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of
those, you know, they sometimes mis-, misuse their license or whatever --

B.68:  Oh.

A.69:  -- you know, they treat them bad.

B.70:  Well, you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland --

A.71:  Oh, really?

B.72:  -- and we took, my, my daughter was living at home then, and she took our
Golden Retriever, oh, not the Golden Retriever, the Norwegian Elk Hound over
there --

A.73:  Oh, really?

B.74:  -- and, it, it, it's a pretty good class, and they did pretty good, except
this dog is, she's just pretty, she's not smart [laughter].

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  So, she didn't learn a lot, but it, I think it calmed her down a little
bit, and she's used to being around other dogs now.

A.77:  How long did it take?

B.78:  I think it was like a six week program.

A.79:  Every, what?

B.80:  Uh, I think it was one night a week --

A.81:  Oh, really?

B.82:  -- for like six weeks, and, uh, you know, it was a group class, outside.
It was fairly reasonable, too.

A.83:  Well, Sheltie Collies are, you know, timid, and they don't really, unless
they get used to something, they're really nervous and.

B.84:  Yeah, they're, they're usually, 

A.85:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.86:  a high-strung dog aren't they?

A.87:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, if they're not accustomed to something, they, they're
really scared.  So.

B.88:  Um, our, our friend has a,
