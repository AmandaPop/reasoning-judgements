============================================================================

B.1:  It was Lee, right?

A.2:  It's Lee.

B.3:  Yeah, Lee.

A.4:  Uh, and you are Bob.

B.5:  I am Bob.

A.6:  Uh, I have been, uh, thinking about the topic and I think it's going to be
interesting to see what happens at the criminal justice system's response to
the tremendous, I guess over load in, uh, cases [noise]. They say that these
drug cases alone are swamping the criminal justice system.

@B.7:  You know the Arab world doesn't do a lot of the things I like, but they
don't have too many repeat, uh, offenders in drugs and murder and a few other
things.  You steal, they cut off the hand, you steal again, they cut off both
hands.  It takes care of it quick.

A.8:  I have heard that.  I have heard that [clink].

B.9:  It takes care of it quick.

A.10:  Uh, I have even heard that the other end of the continuum are [noise] some
judges who are arguing that, uh, because the system is so over loaded that they
recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't
possibly handle all the cases.

B.11:  Uh, two wrongs don't make a right.

A.12:  I think it is going to be very interesting --

B.13:  Yeah.

A.14:  -- because [rustling] it's, uh, it's really become a major expense for us
and society.

B.15:  Yeah, in Texas, uh, some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails --

A.16:  Yeah.

B.17:  -- and with the hope that the over flow from the county or the State would
kind of get to them but, uh, see, evidently the counties and the cities are
too scared to use them because of the expense but, uh, they are having trouble
now paying their bills because they are not getting any customers.

A.18:  Well, you know a --

B.19:  I don't understand that.

A.20:  -- the other thing I think is interesting about this is that they have been
experimenting for years in the civil justice system [noise] with alternatives
to courts where you can rent a judge and I am wondering whether we will
eventually go to renting a jury, uh, and finding ways to uh, like people's
court to try some of these cases.  I think, uh, [noise] the expense is, is
enormous.  Have you ever sat on a jury?

B.21:  Years ago, I sat on a rape trial.  We let the guy off.  There wasn't enough
evidence although I am sure he did it [laughter].

A.22:  Yeah.  Well, it's, uh, [laughter] it's, it's a major undertaking.  I mean
people have to give up their work --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- and a lot of their time and, uh, I I just think it can overwhelm us
pretty easily when I hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume
of the cases.

B.25:  I think you need to get tough with them and quit calling them.  I don't
think they need air-conditioned cells and color T V sets.  They need to be put
on hard labor m-, and as tough as you can make it.  No cuddling, no kissing.
Just nothing.  Just say hey you committed a wrong and you are going to serve
some hard, hard time.

A.26:  Well there are a lot of people --

B.27:  And, uh,

A.28:  -- that think that that works pretty well and it will be interesting to see
what, uh, what we go to because it's, uh, it's push come to shove as far as I
can tell in terms of the sheer volume of the stuff.

B.29:  There in San Francisco you have an interesting place called the Delancy
Street House.  Have you #heard of it?#

A.30:  #Yeah. Oh, yeah.# It is well known and it is consistent with what you are
talking about in terms of the, uh, approach to, uh, the uh, you know, the
people once they get through the trial.  Then I guess, you know, were are
going to see more and more of this kind of thing.  I think the jury trial
system, uh, it is going to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes
more streamlined.  Uh, because of the cost involved in that.  The, uh, the
topic is an interesting one because of the, uh, uh, price you pay for freedom I
guess.  You know.

B.31:  Uh.

A.32:  Uh, the requirement that, that people be given a trial and and then, then
the issue becomes what do you do once somebody is found guilty, I suppose.

B.33:  [Laughter] We was talking to somebody the other, other day and Japan, uh,
they have a very low crime problem.  And one of the things they do in Japan is
they publish the name and address and families of the person convicted of the
crime.  And there is such embarrassment --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- to a family --

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  -- that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part
of the country [noise].  Well, our family sense of family has eroded I am
afraid in this country [noise]. I don't think it will work here.  Over there,
the way they are doing it, it seems to be effective.

A.38:  Yeah.  Have you uh, liv-, uh in Dallas, uh, see in the newspapers ever
print the names of people who were, uh, uh, picked up as Johns, uh, in under
cover operations.

B.39:  I heard that.

A.40:  They,

B.41:  I heard that.  No I haven't [laughter].

A.42:  They have done that in San Francisco, 

B.43:  [Laughter].

A.44:  and, uh, you know, it's going to be interesting to see how all these
things change --

B.45:  Uh.

A.46:  -- as we look at the cost of it because, uh, that, the,  

B.47:  [Sniffing].

A.48:  well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania.  Uh, this Senator, Harris
Wafford who said, you know and in this country everybody is entitled to a
lawyer, but not everybody is entitled to a doctor and we must spend [noise] I
don't know what the figure is, but jury trials are just so --

B.49:  Terribly expensive.  Yeah.

A.50:  -- very, very expensive and time consuming and, uh, so I think that, that
all of the these things that we are talking about are,
