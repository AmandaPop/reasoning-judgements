============================================================================

A.1:  All righty.  So, ho-, what do you think of capital punishment?

B.2:  [Throat_clearing] Well, Texas has capital punishment.

@A.3:  Oh, does it?

B.4:  Yeah.  And, uh, they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years,
and, uh, there are so many cases here, like SIXTY MINUTES is on right now here,
there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong
person --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- that I'm against it.  They should just give them life in prison.

A.7:  Well, I feel that way.  The only exception I think is, qualifies for
capital punishment is repeat offenders, where the offender actually murders
people repeatedly.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  Like serial killers.

B.10:  Yeah, exactly.

A.11:  Or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge,
and then gotten out on parole.  I don't think they should be able to get out
on parole --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- and do it again.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  That's the only time I think it's really.

B.16:  Well, like in your state, Charles Manson.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Or the guy who killed all those children.

A.19:  Yeah -- 

B.20:  Yeah --

A.21:  -- exactly.

B.22:  -- uh-huh.

A.23:  And I think, I think those types of people deserve capital punishment, but
I think they should [child_crying] restrict it strictly for repeat offenders
or like I said, serial killers --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- because, I mean, a lot of ti-, not a lot of times, but qui-, quite a few
times they've convicted innocent people on the first time, but you know, if
they've been convicted like three times, you know, tha-, something's wrong.

B.26:  Something's going on, right.

A.27:  So I think that's the only time it's really necessary.

B.28:  Yeah, I think so too.

A.29:  #Uh.#

B.30:  #After,# after it's gone that far, then they pretty well have, uh, enough
proof that that person's --

A.31:  The guilty party.

B.32:  -- they can't be re-, rehabilitated either.  #So.#

A.33:  #Right# --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- but that's really the only time when I agree with it.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  Most of the time I don't think it's a good idea, because like you said,
there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- just because of circumstances.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  But, in Arizona, which is where I'm originally from, they had a big thing
about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within
six months caught and they had a big thing about whether they should, you
know, go for capital punishment or not.  But, it's not used in Arizona.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  So they had a problem with it.  Unfortunately all the people got was sent
to jail for a couple of years, until they get paroled.

B.44:  Right.  I never heard about those.  

A.45:  Unfortunately, one of them killed a friend of mine, so I was very --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- much involved, and when he got out on parole, I was like, go ahead, get
out on parole.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  And after that I had, I had to tangle with him, and the police caught him
the second time, and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail,
so.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  I definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should be, something
to be done with them other than just sitting there for two years and then
getting out and doing it again.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  [Laughter] [child_crying] But a lot of states have outlawed capital
punishment.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  I don't know which states in general.

B.56:  And that's, that's a reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida.

A.57:  Oh, really?

B.58:  That was his primary goal was to, to have the death penalty --

A.59:  Um.

B.60:  -- because he started out in Washington and Oregon and travelled all the
way across the country.

A.61:  Huh.  I didn't know that.  

B.62:  They had, um, Mark Harmon played him.  They had a movie about it --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- [Talking] a few years ago.

A.65:  Really?

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  Um, I didn't know that.

B.68:  And then of course there was a lot of publicity [child_crying] about it,
um, the days before they killed him.

A.69:  Yeah [talking].

B.70:  So.

A.71:  But.

B.72:  And he was really, you know, he was off the wall, so.

A.73:  [Laughter] I know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays, it's like, I
think people have to be off the wall to do them, but I still don't believe
capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders.

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  But, [talking] I don't know.  I, once I finish law school I'll have more,
probably more views on it [laughter].  I'll be able to do something about it
then [laughter].

B.76:  Yeah, And some of the ways I think that, um, the way that Texas, um,
executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way.  They, they do it by
injection.

A.77:  Oh, do they?

B.78:  Yeah, instead of, you know, the electric chair, the gas chamber, it's --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- you know.

A.81:  That would be the more humane way of doing it.

B.82:  Yeah, well, they, you know, they just go to sleep, and then, then
eventually they die --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- instead of being, you know, fried or #or,#

A.85:  #Or# stuck in a gas chamber --

B.86:  Yeah, fighting --

A.87:  -- until they #finally pass on.#

B.88:  -- #fighting for breath.#  Right, uh-huh.

A.89:  But, I know, a couple of states still believe in the hanging but --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- I don't, I don't go for that either.
