===========================================================================

A.1:  Well Wendy, what kind of music do you like?

@B.2:  Uh, I, I am pretty flexible.  Uh, actually, I like just about everything
minus, um, hard rock.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And I don't really like, uh, rap.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  But I like classical, jazz, uh, you know, uh, contemporary.  I don't know
what you call it.  I just like rock, or easy listening or whatever.  Uh, what
about you?

A.7:  Uh, a lot the same.  I don't like hard rock at all and I, uh, don't like,
uh, rap either.  I don't care too much for jazz.  Sometimes, I do.  A few
things I have heard that I like but,

B.8:  Hang on.  Excuse me [inhaling] Rusty, no.  {Hollers at dog} My dog is
getting into trash.

A.9:  Okay, and, uh, I like classical, and I like, uh, a lot of different kinds
of contemporary, uh, folksy type --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- where you can hear the words, and, uh, you know, where there are some
things they are saying.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  I guess my preference is, uh, well, either classical or Christian
contemporary, er-, praise type songs.

B.14:  And who, who in the Christian contemporary do you like to listen to?

A.15:  Uh, I don't have a particular favorite, I, uh, I like some of the music
that is put out by Josannah, uh, Integrity tapes, they are instrumental
mostly.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Where they just have, uh, praise songs, such as just instruments.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  Or, uh, praise songs with words.  Uh, Uh, there is a few things, I don't
pay too much attention.  I turn the radio on and I don't always pay attention
to who is singing what.  I just know there is a song here and a song there I
like.  I don't spend a lot of money buying tapes and,

B.20:  I don't either unless I know that, you know, a lot of the music --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- on a particular cassette.  But, I do, uh, my husband is from Latin
America and, uh, so I listen to Salsa which is typical of from where he is
from,

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And it is a really lively, fun music, so you find yourself moving just
listening to it.

A.25:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.26:  It is fun.  But mostly, I, uh, listen to, uh, I guess I listen to easy
listening in the car, but if I am at home I will listen to, I don't know, if,
if, not jazz, you know, it will be some type of, uh, like I was talking about,
you know, the music from his area.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Or, uh, I like gospel music.  I listen to a lot of, I listen to a lot of, I
like a cappella gospel.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I do too {Faint}.

B.30:  There is a group called Take Six that does some really lovely stuff.  And
some of it is a little too, uh, it is too, I mean, it is, it's too much along
the lines of a lot of black music.  It is too, uh, it is not rap, but it is
just not enough gospel for me, but their first, uh, works that came out. I
really enjoyed them.

A.31:  Have your ever heard of John Michael Talbot?

B.32:  Yeah, I have heard of him.  The name rings familiar.  I don't know why
though.

A.33:  I guess, I, he is one that at least I know, you know, if I hear his name
that I will probably like it.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  He is just real quiet, reflective, I think he did the companies himself on
the guitar and I, uh, classical guitar.

B.36:  Uh.  #Well that sounds nice.#

A.37:  #I really# like classical guitar.

B.38:  Yeah, I like classical guitar too.  uh, Strings and (( )), I don't know if
you heard of them.  They are not exactly classical, but they have got some
really lovely music out that is along those lines.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And who else?  God I have got, got a couple of really good tapes.  I can
not remember who else {pause}.  There is another group called Fit for Kings
that I listen to.  It is in Spanish, but even if you don't understand it, it
sings a lot of stuff that, that everybody is familiar with.  Like, you
remember the song, Volare, {sings here} well, anyway.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  I remember the song. 

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And, uh, there is a lot of guitar type of, uh, from Spain type stuff.  It
is really beautiful.

A.45:  Have you ever heard of a Venezuelan?  He is local, but he has cut a couple
of albums now, or whatever you call them these days.  C D -s, I guess.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Uh, Carlos Guetison. 

B.48:  Yes, I have.  I don't have any of his work, but I do like it.  I have heard
it on the Oasis.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah, he is on the Oasis and, uh, I have heard him play locally.

B.50:  Have you?

A.51:  Yeah, he plays some times at La Madeline.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And, uh, there is a couple of other places that he is regular at and, uh,
yeah, I really enjoy him.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  But, I don't know, do, do, you would you consider that rap music?

B.56:  Well, uh, there is a little bit, bit of that in there. 

A.57:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I am sure the influence is there.  (( )) yeah {Very
faint}.

@@B.58:  Exactly.  Well, I think we have covered it.

A.59:  Okay.

B.60:  What do you think?

A.61:  I think so.  So, it was good talking to you.
