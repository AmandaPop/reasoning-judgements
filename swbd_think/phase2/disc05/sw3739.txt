============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, I guess we start talking about the budget.

B.2:  Very good, sir.

@A.3:  Okay, you, you live near the nation's capitol, what can we do about this
mess?

B.4:  Well, uh, living near the nation's capitol unfortunately doesn't do you any
good.  Uh, all I, [laughter] all I find that I can do is read the newspapers
and try to decide what's best for us, what we need to do, and that's sort of a
function of the economy, and our relationship with, uh, other countries and so
forth.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  And right now we're in this big change, since Russia has undergone such a,
uh, big, uh, renegotiation within themselves --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- and I'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet.

A.9:  I see big opportunities in Europe opening up, uh, it just, it just seems to
me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a
capitalistic society.

B.10:  Yes --

A.11:  Uh.

B.12:  -- I think they're looking for that.  They just need guidance.

A.13:  #Yeah.#

B.14:  #Yes,# that would be very good for us to help show them what it, what it
takes --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- to have a, a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a, a
say and, uh, you know, can express their thoughts --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- safely.

A.19:  Another thing, I think they (( )), 

B.20:  [Throat_clearing].

A.21:  the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things
speeded up is help out the working people right now, the middle income people.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Uh, give them some tax credits.  I think they done that.  I, seems like I
remember that happening once in my past.  I'm in my forties, and I --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- basically remember getting some sort of tax, tax credit years ago, and I
think it helped.  I think we bought a car, uh, at that time, because we got
some sort of a rebate.

B.26:  Oh.  I don't recall ever getting a rebate.  But it does seem as though if,
if we are able to reduce the, our expenditures for defense, of course, we've
got to get, get this big debt that the country has under control, and if, as
we get that under control, then I'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced
a certain amount, you know, so that we're all comfortable.  But I do believe
that the country's going to have to get itself straightened out debt wise
before, uh, they could do too much that way.  But I hate to see them raise the
taxes if it's unnecessary.

A.27:  Well, I've always believed in paying my fair share of, of, of taxes (( ))
--

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and whatever my government says is my fair share is what I think I
should pay.

B.30:  Sure.  #That makes sense.#

A.31:  #Uh,# I don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find
loopholes in not paying their fair share.

B.32:  Yes, it, it, it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the
paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to
pay your share, and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's
#about# --

A.33:  #Yeah.#  

B.34:  -- isn't it.

A.35:  The lady who does my taxes for me, every year it seems like she's got a new
suggestion --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and sometimes I go with them and sometimes I don't, uh, since I no
longer work, uh, usually it's not very complicated any more, but, uh.

B.38:  You no longer work?

A.39:  I no longer work.  Uh, oh, it's been almost three years ago I had some, uh,
strange heart problems occur --

B.40:  Oh, my.

A.41:  -- and, uh, I'm more or less, hang around the house and, uh, that sort of
thing.

B.42:  Well, you have more experience at that than I.  I just retired from working
myself on December thirty-first.  So I haven't really had time to look at it
from the retiree point of view --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- but it'll be an interesting, uh, concept, I'm sure.

A.45:  Yeah, it's, uh, I know for the, I thought maybe I would go back to work,
especially during that first year, and then they finally decided that (( ))
maybe I'll never work again.

B.46:  Um.

A.47:  So, it took some while to adjust to it, and it, and it took some adjusting
financially, and things like that.  I can no longer afford things that maybe I
used to take for granted.

B.48:  #Yes, I.#

A.49:  #And I# certainly can't invest money like I used to [laughter].

B.50:  I understand.  Well, it's unfortunate you had that problem, and I do hope
you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live
comfortably --

A.51:  Well.

B.52:  -- and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes, and, you
know, still, there are certain things that you need to do in your family and
yourself to enjoy life to the fullest.

A.53:  What kind of work did you do when you were working?

B.54:  I was working, uh, in doing research for the government.  So I know what
it's like.  I had worked for the government basically.  I'm, actually I'm a
professor, a retired professor at Penn State.

A.55:  Oh, yeah.

B.56:  And, uh, but my work has always been in research, uh, related, uh, to the
government.  So I'm, I'm aware of what it takes to perform the work that's
needed, and the government has got to decide what it needs to know and then
set up the criteria by which problems are solved, and, and, uh, the,
