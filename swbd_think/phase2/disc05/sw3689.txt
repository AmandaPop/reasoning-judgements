============================================================================

A.1:  Do you, do you [child_talking] have a lot of credit cards?

B.2:  Um, no, I have, I have two, actually.

A.3:  Well, that's all I have too.

B.4:  Yeah, I, um, one of them, one of them I use, one of them I don't.  Uh, one
of them is like an American Airlines thing where you get free mileage.

A.5:  [Noise] Oh, yeah.

B.6:  (( )).

A.7:  I've heard about those.

B.8:  Yeah, it's pretty good.  I use that and I got, I'm close to a free plane
ticket anywhere in the United States.

A.9:  [Child] Oh, that's nice.

B.10:  A-, and the other one is, uh, um, a credit card I got, it was a while ago I
got it, like a free gold card, and it's good if I ever rent a car [breathing].

A.11:  Oh, #really?#

B.12:  #It pays# for, uh, [breathing] it pays for the insurance.  

A.13:  [Child_talking] [laughter].

B.14:  So --

A.15:  Really.

B.16:  -- I keep that.  I never use that one, but I happen to be going on vacation
soon and ((I'm going to be renting)) a car, so I'll put it on that card, and
then if I got an accident, they would pay for the insurance.

A.17:  #Really.#

B.18:  #Yeah,# they would pay for the accident (( )) [breathing].

A.19:  Yeah, I only have two [child].  One of mine's a gas card that I use just
for my gas to and from work, and the other one's a VISA for emergencies
#only.#

B.20:  #[Breathing] Yeah.#  

A.21:  Like if I go on trips and stuff, I take it with me in case my car breaks
down or something, but other than that, [child_talking] I keep it locked up
[laughter].

B.22:  Yeah, I nev-, I never, uh, like I always pay, you know, I think ((I like))
use it out of convenience, but I don't, I don't run like on a, a monthly
balance.  You know, I always pay whatever it is that, that month.

A.23:  [Child_talking] Yeah, I just --

B.24:  Um.

A.25:  -- I make it a habit not even to carry my VISA, because I've seen too many
of my friends get in deep financial trouble with it.

B.26:  Yeah, well [laughter] you can't [breathing] it, sometimes it pays.  I live
in, in, in New York City, and, uh, if you're going to go out and,

A.27:  [Child_talking].

B.28:  buy something for a hundred, two hundred dollars, not that it's such a
dangerous place, but, you know, I just, sometimes I don't feel that
comfortable carrying a lot of money around, so --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- it's good to have a credit card to pay for it with that.  Um, I use it
for that.  Where, you live in L A?

A.31:  No, [breathing] thank heavens.  I live in National City, which is almost as
bad [child_talking].

B.32:  Where is that?

A.33:  National City, it's outside of San Diego [child_talking].

B.34:  Oh, okay, #okay.#

A.35:  #And# unfortunately, there's a lot of gangs around here, so it's like I
don't carry money and I don't carry credit cards.

B.36:  Right [breathing].  Uh, yeah, it's probably a good idea, [static] but, uh,
yeah, but I, I don't mind.  I, I don't see what the big deal is with, um, I,
I, I couldn't see spending more than I had to pay the bill with, because
eventually it's going to catch up with you.

A.37:  I know, I don't see how people can do that either, but I know a lot of my
friends,

B.38:  [Rustling].

A.39:  have gotten in deep trouble with them, and it's like well, why'd you guys
do it?  Oh, well, it's so easy to use [laughter].

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  And it's like yeah, it's easy to use, but you have to pay for it, you know
#[laughter].  Didn't,#

B.42:  #Sure, sure.#

A.43:  this dawn on you?  But I got my credit cards through a guarantee agency.

B.44:  [Rustling] #Right.#

A.45:  #Do you know# what that is?

B.46:  No, I don't.

A.47:  You give them, you put so much money in an annuity, and it guarantees your
credit card, like say if something happened to you --

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  -- they could still pay off the balance with what's in there [noise].

B.50:  That's cool.

A.51:  And whatever your limit is, you keep that much in your annuity fund.  And
it's worked pretty good for, what, I've had it for about five years now.  And
you can take the annuity out, the money out of the annuity if you want to.

B.52:  #Right.#

A.53:  #But it's# just there like,

B.54:  [Talking].

A.55:  you know, in case you died suddenly or something.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  You know, they wouldn't be stuck with the bill.

B.58:  Cool, #cool.  Th-, that's,# 

A.59:  #So I like it# that way.

B.60:  Yeah, you know, they get paid for if you're dead, right, you know?
#[Laughter].#

A.61:  #Yeah.# At least they won't be coming after my husband, you know, saying
hey, your wife's charged so much money on this credit card.  We want the money
[laughter].

B.62:  That's true.  But then again, you don't have to deal with him if you're
dead, so [breathing].

A.63:  No but, 

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  I don't know.  I wouldn't want to leave him and my kids in that kind of a
situation.

B.66:  That's true, that's true.  

A.67:  But I'll tell you what, it comes in real handy when you've got kids,
[laughter] #because we went,#

B.68:  #Right.#

A.69:  we went on a trip to Arizona.

B.70:  #Right.#

A.71:  #We# drove there, and the car broke down, and it was me and my husband and
our two kids in that car, and Arizona is really hot.  And it's like, you know,
if we didn't have that VISA, we would have been stuck there in that heat for
heaven knows how long.

B.72:  Yeah, that was like, yeah, li-, like the first time I ever got a credit
card was that reason, because I was in, uh, where the heck was I?  [Lipsmack].
I forget where I was.  I know ((I was)) in Europe one time and they ran out of
money, but I couldn't get money on my credit card (( )).  Oh, I was up, I was
dating a woman Upstate New York, and I was up in, uh, Upstate, and I had been
in college, and I guess I took like a hundred, two hundred dollars with me, or
whatever.  At that time, maybe fifty bucks was enough to live on for a week.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  But I [laughter] had to, I took some money with me and I ran out of money
[static] like at the end of the first weekend.  I was supposed to be there for
a week.

A.75:  [Thumping] Huh.

B.76:  And I needed to, I called up my father and I said dad, you know, go to my
bank account and,

A.77:  [Thumping].

B.78:  withdraw a couple of hundred bucks, or whatever it was, and could you send
it Western Union.  And it was a pain in the neck.  I had to like wait till
Monday and, you know, wait till the office opened, and it took time, and
#everything,#

A.79:  #Yeah.#

B.80:  became a pain, so what I did was I, uh, so what I did right after that is I
got myself a credit card in case it ever happened again, I can always, you
know, buy something on the credit card and --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- and not have to worry about carrying cash around.  So that was about
ten, ten, twelve years ago, and I've always had one since.  And like I said,
for that reason it's, it's easy, you know, I couldn't imagine,
