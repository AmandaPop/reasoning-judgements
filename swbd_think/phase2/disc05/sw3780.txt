===========================================================================

B.1:  All right, are you successful in finding a good mechanic to work on your
car?

A.2:  Well, I just, uh, I have a Thunderbird that I spent, last month, twelve
hundred bucks just on getting repairs to.

B.3:  Oh, my.  

A.4:  But [laughter] that's a, that's a hundred thousand mile tune-up, so I
guess if it gives me another fifty thousand in between, I'll be happy with it.
But, uh, 

B.5:  Well, I'm lucky to get that mileage out of a car.  Most of mine go belly up
about, 

A.6:  #[Laughter].# 

B.7:  #eighty thousand miles.#  

A.8:  Well, I tell you, it's expensive if you try and keep them running, you
know, keep them so they're top shape.

B.9:  Yeah.  

A.10:  #Uh, I don't,#   

B.11:  #Well, I'm kind of hard# on a car.  Uh, I find that in most cases the, the
service that you get, particularly at the, uh, dealers, uh, at least in the
Washington area, is so bad that I'm, I just hate to take a car in to have them
work on it.

A.12:  #Well,#

B.13:  #So I# generally run a car until it falls apart and [laughter],

A.14:  #[Laughter].# 

B.15:  #and then# I fix it.  

A.16:  What, what do you, what do you do?  

B.17:  Uh, I'm an electronics engineer.  

A.18:  Uh-huh, I mean do you travel a lot in your job, or not? 

B.19:  No, I, uh, travel very little -- 

A.20:  Oh, okay.  

B.21:  -- so I have to do the, uh, commuting bit and get in the traffic jam every
morning and evening.

A.22:  And that's good and hard on a car.  

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:  Yeah, it, uh, I, uh, I cover most of Texas and Oklahoma with some of the
lines that I sell and, and I'll put on thirty five, forty thousand miles a
year.

B.25:  Oh, my, yeah, #you# --

A.26:  #But,# #uh,#  

B.27:  -- #can# run up a hundred thousand --

A.28:  #It,#

B.29:  -- #miles# without thinking about it.  

A.30:  And you got to keep the car in good shape when you do that.  #Uh, I# --

B.31:  #Yeah.#  

A.32:  -- I'm on my third set of tires on this thing and, uh, you know, brake job
and, you know, shocks.  You, you do the whole thing if you want to keep it
going and about the only really aggravation was when they had a, uh, it turned
out they had to change processor out on the car --


B.33:  Uh-huh.  

A.34:  -- which doesn't seem that difficult a thing to do, but it took them a week
before they realized that they had two other bad processors #[laughter].#

B.35:  #[Laughter].# 

A.36:  And, uh, without a car for a week in my business, it's rather difficult
[laughter].

B.37:  Yeah. 

A.38:  I, I guess the only thing that really bothers me and, uh, the auto, at
least down here and it sounds like you got the same problem where, uh, they
only have probably one really qualified mechanic in the whole garage and, uh,
the rest are maybe a level above or perhaps at the grease monkey level.  And
yet --

B.39:  #Yeah.#  

A.40:  -- #they'll,# they'll charge you for brain surgery on these cars as though
they all know everything.

B.41:  #[Laughter].# 

A.42:  #[Laughter] But,#

B.43:  Well, one of the funniest stories I remember is a boss that I had one time
had an Alfa Romeo, [child_talking] and he hit a bad railroad crossing
somewhere and knocked the oil pan out on the car, and he took it in to have
the oil pan replaced, and they replaced it, and it was just leaking oil
constantly, and they, he kept taking it back to get the oil pan fixed, and,
uh, [barking] they never could fix it, and after about a year and a half
[barking] they finally realized that the pan that they'd replaced on that did
not go with that serial number engine.

A.44:  [Laughter]. 

B.45:  And so they ordered the right one,  

A.46:  [Laughter]. 

B.47:  [Laughter] and he came in all beaming and proud [throat_clearing] that
this thing had finally been fixed and hadn't used a drop of oil in the last
four or five days.  #And, uh, 

A.48:  #[Laughter] Four or five days [laughter].#  

B.49:  Well, he would go out at lunchtime and he, for months afterwards he'd come
back and he'd look at his parking spot at his office and there was this puddle
of oil there.

A.50:  [Laughter]. 

B.51:  And he couldn't figure out what was going on.  He'd check his oil and, you
know, it would still be up there and it hadn't u-, hadn't added any oil, but
there was this oil slick in his parking spot.

A.52:  [Laughter]. 

B.53: Well, what he didn't know was the mechanical engineer that worked for him
was kind of a mischievous type person, 

A.54:  [Laughter]. 

B.55:  and every lunchtime when he'd go out to lunch, the, the k-, the mechanical
engineer would go into the shop and he'd the used oil and come out and pour it
in his #parking,#

A.56:  #[Laughter].# 

B.57:  #spot [laughter].#  

A.58:  #That's funny [laughter].#  How long did it take him to catch on to that one?

B.59:  I don't think he #ever did.#  

A.60:  #[Laughter].# 

B.61:  I think that mechanic went someplace else to work [laughter] --

A.62:  #That drove him nuts [laughter].# 

B.63:  -- #before the oil slick ever cleared up [laughter].#  

A.64:  [Laughter] That's a good one, oh, that's nasty.  Just driving this guy
crazy.  Probably couldn't sleep at night worrying about his expensive car
getting blown up and, 

B.65:  #Yeah,#  

A.66:  #[Laughter].# 

B.67:  he, he was wondering where that oil was coming from, he's checking his
dipstick every day.

A.68:  That is,

B.69:  #[Laughter].# 

A.70:  #funny,# that is funny [laughter].  I got a customer that, uh, has a
Jaguar and he and his wife had one.  He says, well, if you have a Jaguar, you
got to have two, one for the shop and one to drive [laughter].

B.71:  [Laughter] Well, every time I hear somebody buying an M G, I ask them if
they, uh, they paid the extra price to get the tool kit.

A.72:  #[Laughter].# 

B.73:  #[Laughter].# 

A.74:  Oh, well, I don't know, uh, what age you are, but when I was a kid, the
cars, you could, you could fix them.  You #know, I# --

B.75:  #Yeah. # 

A.76:  -- when I was in college, I recall one time,
