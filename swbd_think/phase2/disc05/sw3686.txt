=============================================================================

A.1:  Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one.

B.2:  Yeah, and, uh, [noise] helped my wife replace some carburetors.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  Some that, she had to, uh, label everything [noise].  

A.5:  She had to label everything.  

B.6:  Yeah because,

A.7:  What was she driving?  

B.8:  It was a Cadillac.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  And they, uh, well, [breathing] they quit making those, the ((quieter jet))
carburetor and they quit making it.

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  [Breathing] They rebuilt it and it never did, never did run right again.

A.13:  Yeah, ((quad)) (( )) not really easy to get rebuilt just right.

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?

B.16:  Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that.

A.17:  Yeah.  Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon
or the whole starter?

B.18:  Uh, the, I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  They,

A.21:  The starters are kind of fragile.  

B.22:  Yeah and the,

A.23:  Especially if you need a tune-up.  

B.24:  Uh-huh.  They kept saying that the Chrys-, that's what Chryslers did, is
they wore out starters.

A.25:  Yeah, well, i-, i-, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key
and it starts up --

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the
slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years.

B.30:  Right.  

A.31:  They all take the exact same starter.  They'll interchange completely.  I
mean completely.  One starter will fit all of them.  So they've got a whole
lot of torque, but to do that, they did it, use an underdrive system, but they
geared it down so the motor spins really fast --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- so it's got, to spin for very long, it's kind of tough on the bushings.

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  Usually what goes is the bushings.  

B.36:  Right.  

A.37:  You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly
good starter.  But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with
g-, with good enough bushings.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  So it's, you know, after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go
through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up.

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  Anyway, what are you driving now?  

B.42:  Uh, my Chrysler van and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know, and,
uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier
station wagon and it didn't give me any trouble at all.

A.43:  That's good.  

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  It was a late model, is that Chrysler van?  

B.46:  It's a eighty-seven.  

A.47:  Yeah, one of the little mini vans?  

B.48:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Is a,

A.49:  Do you like the way it rides and stuff?  

B.50:  Uh, rides or runs?  

A.51:  Rides rough?  

B.52:  It, yeah, well, yeah, it rides, rides rough, it runs good.  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  You know, I kind of, it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder
engine.

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway.

A.57:  Yeah, right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four
cylinders aren't real peppy.

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years,
too.
 
B.60:  You driven American cars all,

A.61:  Uh, yeah, I've driven one im-, uh, I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while,
[laughter] about a month.  Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers
on it.

B.62:  Go-,

A.63:  Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  Everything else I ever owned was American built.  Uh, mostly older cars.
Uh, I've been a mechanic, well, I worked, starting working my father's service
station when I was about, uh, twelve.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs.  My
first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs.  A G T O and a Bonneville
and a station wagon.  I had a couple of Chryslers.  Had a super B for a while
with a four forty in it.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  It was a lot of fun.  

B.70:  [Laughter]. 

A.71:  But, uh, 

B.72:  Not much gas mileage, though.  

A.73:  I don't know, gas mileage wasn't too bad.  It got about seventeen.

B.74:  Oh, wow.  

A.75:  Well, till you got crazy with it.  You know, you get the four barrel all
worked up and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast, but --

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time
with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas.  Didn't have
to work too hard to move the car around.

B.78:  Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it
improves the way the car runs?

A.79:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  Yeah, the, my last G M car was a seventy Chevy station wagon and it still
had the points and condenser in it.  When I rebuilt the engine on that, about
a hundred and thirty thousand on the car.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  I, uh, pulled that old points distributor out and got, an H E I
distributor, electronic distributor put into it.
