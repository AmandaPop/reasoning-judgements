A.1:  [TV] Family with children or,

@B.2:  Uh, yes.  In fact, I'm, I'm, I've got grandchildren.

A.3:  Oh, do you?

B.4:  Yeah [laughter].

A.5:  So what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them.

B.6:  Uh, spending, uh, {pause} oh, [sigh] just visiting back and forth.
Fortunately, when your children get up in their thirties, they finally grow up
#[laughter].  And you get to enjoy them.#

A.7:  #[Laughter]# That's true.  And then you just get to spoil the grandkids
and send them home.  Right?

B.8:  Right.  #Right.#

A.9:  #That's what my mom# always says [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah.  Do you have children?

A.11:  Yeah.  I have one little daughter.  She's just a year and a half.

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  And I think about all we ever do is just pick up after her, it seems like
[laughter].

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  She's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing.  Her
attention span's only a couple of minutes I think.  And --

B.16:  Oh, yeah.

A.17:  -- then its on to the new little mess.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.  #Yeah.#

A.19:  #I'm# sure you remember those days [laughter].

B.20:  Um.

A.21:  But, and we try and sit and read to her.  She's really good.  She'll bring
us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff.  But, #they# --

B.22:  #Yeah.#

A.23:  -- can't, they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else or
else she loses her, loses a, the attention.  It's not, uh, the attention's
not, that interesting to her for very long.

B.24:  Yeah.  I, I think one of the very most important, e-, e-, I, I guess about
the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to
read to them.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Uh, and get them to love books before they ever start to preschool.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Uh --

A.29:  Uh, [throat_clearing].  #Uh,# 

B.30:  -- #I# was very fortunate in having an older sister.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Who read to me #constantly.#  

A.33:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.34:  And, uh, so I was, I went to school in the days before public kindergarten.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  But, uh, uh, I had practically all the fairy stories read to me before I
started to school, so.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  And it,

B.38:  Uh, uh, I made great strides.  #And# --

A.39:  #(( )).#

B.40:  -- I, I'm sure you'll experience the same thing.

A.41:  Yeah.  I, I, uh, my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and I, I've
carried it through.  I love to read now and, and, uh, that's why we've, we've
made it a point whenever she brings us a book, that we don't, you know --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- we always sit down with her --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that,
that, uh, it's something good to do but,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  Yeah.  It's, it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just
start, you know, kind of, not whining, but just letting us know that it, she
wants us to read this book and it's the #same# --

B.48:  #Uh-huh.#

A.49:  -- one over and over and over again it seems like but #[laughter].#

B.50:  #[Laughter]#  #Yeah.#

A.51:  #But# I guess, like you say, she, it's something so she, at least she gets
in the habit.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  But, yeah, we, uh, [throat_clearing] my wife works at a day-care part-time
and she's able to take her with her there.  #But# --

B.54:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.55:  -- she, she works with a lot of kids whose parents, you know, it's --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- they drop them off at six in the morning and then pick them up at six at
night and --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight, you know.  Which
means #they# --

B.60:  #Yeah.#

A.61:  -- only get to spend about two hours a day with them.  And I just kind of
wonder, you know, there's, [swallowing] there's a lot to be said wi-, with
parents, you know, for parents spending time with their kids, that's for sure.

B.62:  Yeah.  #Yeah {very faint}.#

A.63:  #Other# than just, you know, putting them in front of the T V or something
like that.

B.64:  Um.

A.65:  I have a, kind of a hard time with that, but, it's, uh, I think it's ((fair
to say)) you get more of a, there's a lot more love and they don't have to go
elsewhere to find the, the attention and stuff if the parents are spending
time doing stuff with them [child].

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  So [throat_clearing].  How many children did you ha-, do you have?

B.68:  Uh, three.

A.69:  Three?

B.70:  Three.  Yeah.

A.71:  And how many grandchildren?  

B.72:  Uh, eight.

A.73:  Eight.  Oh, that's #good.#

B.74:  #Yeah.#

A.75:  Yeah.  We, uh, my mom and dad just dr-, they have three grandchildren now.
Each of --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- my brother and sister each, we each have one.  But, #they're# --

B.78:  #Uh-huh.#

A.79:  -- they're fond of, like I say.  They like to keep them for a couple of
hours but, boy, when they send them home with us, they sure know it.  Cause
they have been spoiled to death #[laughter].#

B.80:  #[Laughter].#  

A.81:  They like them but [sniffing] --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- uh, they, they're looking forward, they, like I say, they've been
looking forward to the time when they could just send them home with their,
with their parents.

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  As opposed to having to keep us all the time #[laughter].#

B.86:  #Yeah.#  Yeah, yeah.

A.87:  So.

B.88:  I, I think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be
consistent.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  And, and, uh, in your discipline.  Cause some days when you're feeling
pretty good, you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder.

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  Then on days when you don't feel well, #[noise] {sounds like a growl}
[laughter].#

A.93:  #[Laughter]#  #Well, how do you do,# 

B.94:  #What do you mean# you didn't do this #[laughter].#

A.95:  #[Laughter]# How did you do that?  I mean, you know, as far as having to
tell them no or slapping their hands or #something like that.  That's, that's
what we struggle with.#

B.96:  #Oh [sigh].  Oh, gee.  I, I,# I did a lot of the wrong things, I'm sure.

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  But, uh, uh, that, that was the hardest thing I found was to be consistent.
#And# --

A.99:  #Uh-huh.#

B.100:  -- it, I, I tried to keep as few rules but, well really about the only rule
I #had# --

A.101:  #Uh-huh.#

B.102:  -- was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their
eating to the kitchen.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  #[Laughter] So.#

A.105:  #[Laughter] Those are the# ones that save you a lot of time and energy
#[laughter].#

B.106:  #Yeah.# Yeah.  And, uh, so, uh, I don't know.  They all turned aro-, out
okay.  #So.#

A.107:  #Yeah.# Well, that's the important thing.  And they probably appreciate all
you did for them, so.

B.108:  Well, I, I think so.

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  And, uh,

A.111:  We're just, like I say, we just, all I keep hearing is from my mom, is just
you wait.  You know.  #You'll get all that you ever gave so [laughter].#

B.112:  #[Laughter].#

A.113:  I could be in trouble but.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  Like I say, they, they're a handful, that's for sure.  We --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- I, just last night, uh, she [/TV] [/child],
