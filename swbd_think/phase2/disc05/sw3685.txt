==============================================================================

A.1:  And women's place in the workplace, huh.  Uh, to quote my father, a woman's
place is in the stove #[laughter]#.

B.2:  #Oh, I disagree.  I disagree#.  

A.3:  I have to disagree, my wife works.  

B.4:  #Yeah [laughter]. So do I#

A.5:  #[Laughter]#. 

B.6:  #So do I.#

A.7:  #So w-,# What do you do?  

B.8:  Uh, I'm a lab tech.  

A.9:  Are you?  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  Well, I guess as far as roles in the workplace they've, uh, they've made
some, you know, pretty serious, uh, ground in the last thirty, forty years.

B.12:  Th-, right, they've generally increased considerably.  

A.13:  Well, my sister is a, she's a medical professional.  

B.14:  Oh, really?  

A.15:  And, you know, she says that in, in order to get paid the same as a man,
you have to do twice the work.

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  But -- 

B.18:  #See I# ...

A.19:  -- #fortunately# it's not that tough [laughter].  

B.20:  Well, yeah, I can see that.  I, I can see that, but I, I, I, I do think
that, uh, uh, higher positions like administrative more often go to the man
than they do the woman.

A.21:  Yeah, yeah, I, I grant you that [laughter].  

B.22:  But, hopefully that will change soon.  

A.23:  Well, that hasn't been true of any of my companies.  

B.24:  Oh, really?  

A.25:  Yeah, because, well, the women that I hire are ones that are capable.

B.26:  Right.  

A.27:  If they're capable, they can do anything they want to do [laughter].

B.28:  Right, well I work for a private laboratory and --

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  -- #and# when it's a small company you see where, you're, you're kind of 
overstepped because you are a woman.

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  And, but I think, uh, i-, I think it's starting to change.  

A.33:  Well, I hope so.  

B.34:  Yes, I do, too [laughter].  Considering I am a woman #[laughter].#

A.35:  #Yeah#, well, for your sake, sure.  

B.36:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.37:  #But#, uh, I think that as long as the American society is inundated as 
it is by the commercial market, you know, #the# --

B.38:  #Right.#  

A.39:  -- television's commercials in particular -- 

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- uh, progress is going to be rather rapid, but shaping role models is
going to be a problem.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  Because, you know, they don't want to rock the boat with anybody.

B.44:  Right, #right.#  

A.45:  #And#, you know, I don't know how you perceive life, but I know that people
are prejudiced and they, bigoted, and they carry their, their convictions all
the way to the bone, no matter what they say.

B.46:  Right, right, right.  

A.47:  And, uh, you know, I'm the first one.  Well, I flunked the, the M C P test
big time.

B.48:  Oh, really?  

A.49:  Yeah, you know what that is?  

B.50:  No, huh-uh.  

A.51:  Oh, uh, uh, a man and his son were driving along the road in a convertible,
and they have a car wreck and the, the father's killed, and the boy is rushed
to the emergency room, and the doctor walks in, looks down, says, I can't
operate on him, that's my son.

B.52:  All right, the, that was his mother.  

A.53:  All right, you passed.  

B.54:  Oh [laughter].  

A.55:  [Laughter] Believe me, it's not that easy for a lot of men to understand
#that#.

B.56:  #Yeah#, I can, yeah, I can see that.  

A.57:  #You know.#

B.58:  #I can# see that.  

A.59:  And I have a woman doctor [laughter].  

B.60:  Oh, really?   

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  Isn't that strange, I have a man doctor.  

A.63:  Really?  Well, actually we go Dr. Garcia's office and -- 

B.64:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.65: -- #we started# going with him as soon as he got done with his residency.  He
was a guy at the emergency room when we went there and then he got his office,
well, we just, you know, stayed with him and he's hired this other lady and, uh,
my sister [noise] says that she's a better doctor.

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  I don't know, you know [laughter].  I see doctor once every six months, you
know.  #But, uh #...

B.68:  #Well#, that's w-, that, I think that's one place that, you know, the roles
of women are changing.  You don't see, uh, uh, y-, well, you see a lot more
women in medical profession higher up as in doctors and everything.

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  I know several that are, are pathologists and forensic pathologists and,
you know, used to, you didn't see that or hear of it at all.

A.71:  Yeah, well, getting into medical school is no, no mean trick either.

B.72:  Right, that's true, that's true.  

A.73:  But, uh, as far as a, you know, the, the, the role of women in the
workplace, I think Texas has come remarkably far con-, considering the, the
high density of rednecks that #are there around.#

B.74:  #Oh, yeah, isn't that# true, isn't that true.  

A.75:  I'm a, I'm a transplant.  I'm, you know, we came from out of state.

B.76:  Uh, so did I.  

A.77:  When I was very young, but it was too late, I was already formed.

B.78:  Oh, I came as an adult here #[laughter]#.  

A.79:  #Yeah#, well, you know, I was like, uh, I guess ten or eleven, you know.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  And we came from, uh, a family that was, my mother is strong to say the
least [laughter].

B.82:  Did she work?

A.83:  N-, no, not outside the home.  

B.84:  Um.  

A.85:  No, she was a, she went to college, you know, correspondence courses and
whatnot.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  But my parents were n-, my dad was in the Air Force.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  And all the time that, uh, you know, he was in the Air Force, well, she's
never had to work.

B.90:  Right.  

A.91:  You know, he always provided the, the financial support, but she has
worked, uh, therapeutically, you know, #so# --

B.92:  #Uh-huh#.  

A.93:  -- you know, something to do [laughter].  

B.94:  Right.  

A.95:  I mean, raising children ...
