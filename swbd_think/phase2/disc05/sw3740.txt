===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Um, I would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this
category.

B.3:  Yeah, well, I picked ev-, almost [laughter] every category,

A.4:  [Laughter]  You'll talk about anything, right?

B.5:  They said, you (( )) said pick fifteen categories and, 

A.6:  [Laughter]. 

B.7:  there wasn't really all that much I was into.  I mean, I'm in-, interest,
of course I do read a lot, but that's, uh [laughter],

A.8:  [Laughter].

B.9:  But I also picked gardening, and [laughter] I tried to talk about that for
five minutes.  I don't really garden very much [laughter].

A.10:  [Laughter].

B.11:  But, books I could talk about, you know, forever.  I,

A.12:  Uh, me too, what kind of books do you read?

@B.13:  Well, mostly fiction, and, um, the nonfiction I like are, are the, usually
the crime stories --

A.14:  I see.

B.15:  -- see, and, um.

A.16:  We're going to get along well.

B.17:  Oh, you too?  [laughter].

A.18:  Yeah, I like fiction.  Uh, matter of fact, well, my favorite would be
horror type stories such as Stephen King and such.

B.19:  Oh, see, now, I don't like [laughter], 

A.20:  [Laughter].

B.21:  I don't like those types.  I, I can't relate to stuff like that.  It's
so weird, you know.

A.22:  That's, that's why I read it, because I don't have to relate to it
[laughter].

B.23:  Yeah, well, I like, I, I like a book I can in some way relate to, and, and
that's, I don't know, it's so off the wall, most of that stuff.  You know, you
re-, I, you can't really believe it, I mean, you, it's hard to, to, to read it
and, and really think that this could really happen.  It's just, I don't know,
it's not believable to me at all.

A.24:  Well, thank goodness [laughter].

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  Believe me.

B.27:  Well, well that's true.  You don't have to read a book and believe it, you
know, stuff can happen, but I don't know, I guess I just go more for realism.

A.28:  Have you read THE FIRM?  

B.29:  Oh, yeah, it's very good.

A.30:  Oh, that was --

B.31:  Yeah.

A.32:  -- one of the best books I've read for a long time.

B.33:  Yeah, that was good.  I read that, oh, quite a while ago.

A.34:  And, um, see, another one I just read that I thought was really excellent
was, uh, JURASSIC PARK.

B.35:  Oh, by, um, oh. 

A.36:  Michael Cryton --

B.37:  Cryton,

A.38:  -- or something like that.

B.39:  Right, Cryton.

A.40:  Have you read that one?

B.41:  No, now what is that about?  Is that, uh, an espionage thing?

A.42:  No, it's about, uh, this multimillionaire that has decided he wants to
start a theme park, and it's about dinosaurs.  Well, they've taken D N A
material from dinosaurs, and --

B.43:  Oh.

A.44:  -- and really recreated dinosaurs.

B.45:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.46:  Yeah, well, it's a little far fetched also --

B.47:  Yeah, yeah.

A.48:  -- but, um, it was really an excellent book.  It held my interest.  Have
you read any of his other things?

B.49:  Yes, I have, but I, TERMINAL MAN, was it, #was that one of his?#

A.50:  #TERMINAL MAN, yeah,# I've seen, seems like I've seen the movie.

B.51:  He, he writes stuff, his wri-, his books are similar to Robin Cook's.  Have
you read any of Robin Cook's?

A.52:  I've read a couple of Robin Cook's.

B.53:  Yeah, and they're sort of similar, you know, in the, you know, he deals a
lot in, you know, scientific stuff, or, you know, stuff that, um, I, you don't
know if it could, it could happen or not.  You know, it's --

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  -- just, um, you know, but I mean most of it is good, I, yeah, I haven't,
uh, I haven't read anything by him in a long time.

A.56:  Well, I noticed he had a couple, I don't know how recent they are, but I
think SPHERE was one, and something else, uh, another one word title, and I
thought I might pick up one of those books #because,#

B.57:  #Fear,# is that what you said, fear? 

A.58:  SPHERE, S P H E R E.

B.59:  Oh, no, I don't, no I'm not familiar with that.  

A.60:  Well, how about, did you read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?  

B.61:  Oh, yes [laughter].  Uh, did you read his other one, THE RED DRAGON?

A.62:  Yes, I did.

B.63:  Yes, now, uh, both of them were terrific.

A.64:  They were.  Uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, though was, I, I could not put the
book down.

B.65:  Well, see, now I couldn't either.  Now I, uh, a friend of mine started to
read it, because, you know, I told her it was terrific, and everybody she'd
spoke to said it was terrific.  She couldn't get into it.

A.66:  You're kidding?

B.67:  Oh, she's sort of a lightweight [laughter].

A.68:  [Laughter].

B.69:  You know, her, her, uh, her reading consists of, have you ever heard of V C
Andrews?

A.70:  Oh, yes [laughter].

B.71:  [Laughter] You know, stuff like that, you know Danielle Steele, you know --

A.72:  I see.

B.73:  -- you know, stuff like that, so she really, she couldn't get into this,
but she, I think she said she saw the movie, she liked the movie, I don't, you
know.

A.74:  The movie was wonderful.  You didn't see it?

B.75:  Yeah, the movie was good, but I, well, you know, compared to the book.

A.76:  Well, true, it --

B.77:  Right.

A.78:  -- didn't have the impact --

B.79:  No.

A.80:  -- but I thought that they, they stayed very faithful to the book.

B.81:  Well, they did, but, um, I don't think it was as scary as I expected it to
be.  I, I really, you know, I, I don't know, I just didn't think it was as
suspenseful as, as I expected it to be.  I don't know.

A.82:  Well.

B.83:  But it was a good, it was a good movie.

A.84:  It's hard to top that book.

B.85:  Yeah, well, that's true, and I'm waiting, his new one comes out sometime in
the spring, I think.

A.86:  Oh, really.

B.87:  Yes [laughter].

A.88:  What's it about, have you, another serial killer?

B.89:  Probably another murder thing, you know, that's usually what he, you know,
well this, this'll be I think his fourth or fifth book, and the other, the
previous ones were murder, um.  The, he wrote also BLACK SUNDAY, which was a,
about the, uh, bombing in the, in the Superdome.  Oh, it was a,

A.90:  Oh.

B.91:  And they made a movie out of that.

A.92:  TWO MINUTE WARNING?

B.93:  Um, gee, I don't know.  I think it was called BLACK SUNDAY.

A.94:  You know, I think you're right, I think I.

B.95:  It was about fift-, well, no, about ten years ago, I guess it, uh, you
know, but, uh,

A.96:  I'll have to look back and see what else he's written because.

B.97:  That's all he's written.

A.98:  Really?

B.99:  RED DRAGON, that one, and, uh, SILENCE OF,
