===========================================================================

A.1:  Who, uh [child], does your family keep a budget at all or, 

@B.2:  Well, 

A.3:  [Child_yelling]. 

B.4:  I sort of, I mean in my mind I do [laughter].

A.5:  [Child_yelling]  Yeah.

B.6:  I don't write anything down or anything,

A.7:  [Child_yelling].  

B.8:  like that.

A.9:  Oh.

B.10:  I just know what my bills are and how much I need for that #and,#

A.11:  #Oh.#

B.12:  what's extra.

A.13:  #Huh.#

B.14:  #I'm# a nurse, and so I kind of figure I'm taking home a hundred dollars a
day.

A.15:  Oh, really?

B.16:  So when I look at things like to buy or anything, I think of it in days.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  If I hear something is three hundred dollars, I think, um, that's three
extra days, you #know, something like that so.#

A.19:  #Three extra days you'd, yeah.#

B.20:  So everything in my mind is by days, and that's, that's about the extent of
my budget.

A.21:  About it, huh?

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  {Faint} Yeah, we've, uh, we've been trying to save for a house.  We've been
really trying to penny pinch, and #I'm telling you,#

B.24:  #Oh, that's a good one# {faint}.

A.25:  it gets tough when, you know, we have, I've tried to write something out on
a computer and stuff, but it seems like every week there's something that
comes up and makes it about impossible #to,#

B.26:  #Well,# that's what happens.  That's exactly what happens.

A.27:  The car breaks down or #somebody,#

B.28:  #Uh-huh.#

A.29:  gets sick or [laughter],

B.30:  Uh-huh, so it's just when you think you might get a little ahead, that's
right, that's what happens.

A.31:  Exactly.

B.32:  So that's kind of hard but,

A.33:  Are you, uh, are you able to plan or save anything for a healthy future or,

B.34:  No #[laughter].#

A.35:  #[Laughter].#

B.36:  No, not at all.

A.37:  I know it.

B.38:  Not at all.  #I, I barely,#

A.39:  #It's a day-to-day thing.#

B.40:  get by [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah, I know, that's, we, I have my wife and a daughter, and it's about
impossible.

B.42:  Yeah, it's hard.  It's real hard and, uh, it doesn't get much better
#either [laughter],#

A.43:  #[Laughter].#

B.44:  That's how it #goes but,#

A.45:  #Oh,# that's good to hear [laughter].

B.46:  I know, but you know, I just think that you're marked and you're supposed
to have X amount of dollars and that's the way it's going to be, you know
#[laughter] I mean (( )),#

A.47:  #[Laughter] And there's nothing you can do about it, huh?#

B.48:  That's how it feels, really #because,#

A.49:  #Yeah.#

B.50:  there's, there's just some people just have more money, and some don't, and
that's it #[laughter].#

A.51:  #Yeah.#  It makes you wonder how they get it all.

B.52:  So.

A.53:  I mean,

B.54:  Uh-huh, and, and I'm lucky, I have a very low mortgage payment {faint} ((
)) --

A.55:  Oh, do you?

B.56:  -- I've had my house for a long time and --

A.57:  Huh.

B.58:  -- I don't have a car payment, and, you know, I, I don't have a lot of
things #so,#

A.59:  #Just,#

B.60:  I'm pretty lucky, but I have to ma-, come up with the money totally by
myself, so that's hard #too.#

A.61:  #Yeah.#

B.62:  You know.  

A.63:  Well, that's what's, I mean, just as we've been trying to get into a house,
and I just, I just, with what we make a payment, I mean it's about double what
we pay for rent.  I just can't see how people do it these days.

B.64:  Yeah.  How is housing there?

A.65:  Well, it's actually, Utah's been lucky.  We haven't been hit by the
recession, so housing prices have stayed up.  The only thing that's helping us
is that the mortgage rates are going down but,

B.66:  {Faint} Yeah.

A.67:  Uh, it's still moving pretty brisk, and I say we've been kind of lucky.  We
haven't been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has.

B.68:  {Faint} Yeah, yeah.

A.69:  We've been able to stay out of, you know, that we haven't lost many jobs or
anything #like that (( )).#

B.70:  #Yeah.  Well,#  I'm lucky.  I'll never lose, 

A.71:  Yeah, that #nursing.#

B.72:  #But, you know,# it doesn't matter.  If I lose a job one place, I'll just
go somewhere #else, so.#

A.73:  #Yeah, I've often# said, if I had to do it all over again, I think I'd
[laughter] go into something like that.  I, 

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  Seems like there's always, you look in the paper and there's a huge demand
for #nursing,#

B.76:  #Oh.#

A.77:  and stuff #so.#

B.78:  #Oh,# yeah, really.  And, and they get a little picky in one place, and I
know where I am now, there's a whole big new administration, and they're,
they're scaring everybody to death but #I,#

A.79:  #Uh-huh.#

B.80:  don't work on staff.  I just work on call.

A.81:  Oh, do you?  You just work on call, #huh?#

B.82:  #Uh-huh,# and so I have a couple of agencies that I work for, and I make
much more money that way.

A.83:  Huh.

B.84:  And I can be independent.  I don't have to go to all the meetings #and
get,#

A.85:  #Yeah.#

B.86:  into the politics, and I don't get the benefits, but I think it's more than
worth it, #then I just pay for,#

A.87:  #Oh, yeah, definitely.#

B.88:  that.  #So.#

A.89:  #Definitely# sounds,

B.90:  Yeah, it's a great thing.  But it's risky and most people don't want to,

A.91:  Yeah, but it #sounds like,#

B.92:  #do that.#

A.93:  you've been doing all right with it so,

B.94:  Yeah.  I, I feel like it, #you,#

A.95:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.96:  know, and it's much more interesting that way #too.#

A.97:  #Uh-huh.#

B.98:  You don't get burned out so much, #so.#

A.99:  #Yeah.#  So do you have a family or,

B.100:  Yeah, I have a twelve year old.

A.101:  Oh, do you?

B.102:  And so, yeah, I have #to, you know,#

A.103:  #Enough to keep you kind of busy.#

B.104:  take care of her #[laughter] so [breathing] yeah,#

A.105:  #[Laughter] Yeah.#

B.106:  So we know we've got to cover certain things.  It's not just me #so,#

A.107:  #Yeah,# that's true.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  Yeah, I, uh, that's what, uh, you know, we're trying to, we, well, I mean,
we've got a long ways off before school starts.  My daughter is just eighteen
months, but --

B.110:  {Faint} Oh.

A.111:  -- you know, you think about it, I had to struggle my whole time through
college, you know, pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there,
but I just don't know how, you know, they can ever do it, and ten years,
fifteen years from now when I have to go and,

B.112:  Well, I know what you mean.  

A.113:  [Throat_clearing].

B.114:  It does look impossible.  You look around you, and I don't know how young
people buy houses today or anything.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  I really don't #know.#

A.117:  #And# a small, little, you know, two bedroom home with, you know, five
hundred square feet is about sixty thousand, it seems like and,

B.118:  Oh, that's #terrible.#

A.119:  #Those are pretty hefty# payments to --

B.120:  Yeah.

A.121:  -- well, that's in Utah, I might say.  I think we're, we're probably below
the market for the most part.  We're pretty #lucky,#

B.122:  #Gosh# {faint}.

A.123:  that way but,

B.124:  Yeah.  Well, it's not too bad in this area #really.#

A.125:  #Hasn't it?#

B.126:  The thing is, there's a lot of money, and like I'm in Plano, so it's a
little bit north of Dallas.

A.127:  #Uh-huh.#

B.128:  #But# there's so much money in this town, and there are things that are
three hundred and five hundred thousand.

A.129:  Oh.

B.130:  And lots and lots of them.  But you can buy a nice three bedroom home for
like eighty thousand.

A.131:  Oh, that's not bad.

B.132:  So it really isn't.  It's low compared to the rest of the country.

A.133:  Uh-huh.
