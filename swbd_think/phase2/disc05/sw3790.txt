words quite a bit.

============================================================================

A.1:  Have a favorite for the Super Bowl, or, I guess being as all the rest of
the teams are eliminated that's about all we can talk about [laughter]?

B.2:  Yeah, right, uh, well, I, I think, uh, uh, I probably, uh, uh, watching, my
son's a big fan of, uh, of Washington.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And so, uh, for, not, not having any other real, real preference, I guess,

A.5:  Yeah, go for that?  

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  Well, that's who I kind of thought, uh, that's who I was going to kind of
cheer for.  I just think all the teams from the A F C are more or less like
the minor leagues for [laughter], 

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  the N F C lately, so --

B.10:  Huh.  

A.11:  -- I just, I hope they can give them a game.  I think it will be a good
game this year, but --

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- I don't know, in the past they haven't been so hot.

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  Do you, uh,   

B.16:  Yeah, it's kind of, kind of bad when they get blown out like, 

A.17:  Yeah, gets, you know, y-, you watch the Super Bowl for the commercials and
that's about it.

B.18:  Yeah {faint}.

A.19:  All the new ones [laughter] that come out so,   

B.20:  Just out of curiosity, what, uh, people up in Utah, uh, who do, who do
people generally cheer for.  Who, who are the close teams out there?

A.21:  Well I,   

B.22:  The California teams?  

A.23:  I think a lot of them, uh, kind of like me, I, I cheer, I like players --

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  -- you know, certain players and so I root for those teams and Brigham
Young University, of course, is pretty big up here.

B.26:  Uh-huh, sure.  

A.27:  And so a lot of people like the Forty-niners because Steve Young plays for
them.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  Uh, Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him --

B.30:  Right {faint}.

A.31:  -- you know, when he played for them, but, he kind of got to be a jerk, so
nobody liked him anyway but, 

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  uh, a lot of Forty-niners, I think -- 

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- uh, more than anything, I guess.  

B.36:  Um.  

A.37:  But, uh,

B.38:  Yeah, I mean, i-, in Texas there's, there's plenty, you know, there's a
fair amount to choose from --

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  -- between the Cowboys and, and the Oilers and so,   

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  But,

A.43:  Yeah, we, I, I've always been kind of a Cowboys fan.  I like them.  I'm
glad to see they're doing a little bit better, but --

B.44:  Yeah well, 

A.45:  -- I s-, I just usually root for players that I know of, I guess.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  Whatever happens, happens, so,   

B.48:  Used to be the C-, I mean the Cowboys for so many years, uh, ended up e-,
e-, essentially dominating --

A.49:  Oh, yeah.  

B.50:  -- or, y-, and, and being so strong consistently, and then the last few
years [laughter] being, being just walked all over --

A.51:  Oh, yeah.  

B.52:  -- by everybody.  I mean they've -- 

A.53:  Well I think,   

B.54:  -- they've lost a lot of fans.  

A.55:  I think you'll see, I bet in the nineties they come out and I bet --

B.56:  I, yeah.  

A.57:  -- they're the team to beat.  It's -- 

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- I mean, they got so many first and second round picks again this year
that --

B.60:  Sure.  

A.61:  -- I think they're going to be really tough and Jimmy Johnson, 

B.62:  Yeah, they're, they're obviously rebuilding --  

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  

B.64:  -- quite, pretty well and, and stuff. 

A.65:  That Jimmy Johnson seems to know what he's doing, too.  I,   

B.66:  Yeah, I, I didn't know how he was going to make the transition into --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- professional ball, uh, you know, it's one thing to be a real successful
college coach.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  I, I, at least I imagine it is.  Uh, you know, and then [throat_clearing]
seems like it would be quite different to --

A.71:  Oh, yeah.  

B.72:  -- to be coaching pros.

A.73:  Well, you'd think that the, just the personalities, the people, it, it
would seem a lot harder to get them motivated.  I mean, it's a --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- job, then, and -- 

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- you know, you're not out for school spirit or whatever, you know, 

B.78:  [Laughter]. 

A.79:  you're out for the fifty grand.

B.80:  Course, course, also at that, at that level, I mean, you're dealing with
people who, who, who know, you know, who, who are competitive, obviously --

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  -- or they wouldn't be there.  

A.83:  That's true.  

B.84:  And they're motivated, obviously, [laughter] or they wouldn't be there.

A.85:  Yeah, that's true.  I guess,    

B.86:  And so, you know, I don't know, but it seems like it would, you know, you
can't treat them like they're kids and yet, in, in a lot of senses, still a
lot of them probably are.

A.87:  Course, I've always had a hard time screaming at somebody that was about
six five and two fifty, 

B.88:  [Laughter]. 

A.89:  anyway, so, I always thought that was kind of stupid [laughter].  Wouldn't
yell too loud at them because you never know, 

B.90:  [Laughter]. 

A.91:  what might come back at you.

B.92:  Yeah, you would, you would have be one of those coaches with the soft
styles [laughter].

A.93:  That's right [laughter].  Just sweet talk them as much as you can, because
[laughter], 

B.94:  Yeah, my dad was actually a football coach.  

A.95:  Oh, was he?  

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  On a --

B.98:  In a junio-,  

A.99:  -- college level or,   

B.100:  Junior college.  

A.101:  Junior college.  

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  Oh, so, did you play at all yourself or,   

B.104:  I played, played high school.  

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  But I didn't, didn't go beyond that.  

A.107:  Yeah, I stopped growing, I think, about when I was twelve years old and
everybody else grew up so --

B.108:  Yeah.  

A.109:  -- I quit after Little League because I realized it was, I was going to get
pounded on if --

B.110:  Um.  

A.111:  -- I kept going so [laughter].  

B.112:  [Laughter] Well, I, I didn't grow too big myself.  

A.113:  Yep.  But, do you follow college much at all either or,   

B.114:  A little bit more so, yeah.  

A.115:  Do you?  

B.116:  Because I, I'm here in Austin and we have, uh, U T Austin -- 

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  -- is here and, and, [child_talking] uh, you know, they, they look like
they were b-, you know, they're kind of like the Cowboys, i-, for years, years
had a dominating team, then they went through this big long slump and, and --

A.119:  Yeah.  

B.120:  -- uh, last year it looked like they were back and, and there was
predictions that they were going to be a, you know, going to be real
challenge.  In fact --

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  -- I think they started ranked like, you know, fifteenth in the polls --

A.123:  Oh, really?  

B.124:  -- or something.  And then, you know, then it was a long slide down.

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  It really w-, i-, a fairly disappointing year.  

A.127:  Well, I, you know, I, they're, I mean, football in Texas, that's pretty,
uh, it's, uh, like a rabid --

B.128:  Y-,   

A.129:  -- thing down there, isn't it?  

B.130:  Yeah, it's, it's pretty serious.  Uh, you know, I, I end up being so busy
that I, I don't watch much of it --

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  -- and I don't follow it much, but it's obvious that the people around me
do [laughter].

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  You know, and, and I sometimes feel bad that I haven't, you know, I'm not
up on it more.

A.135:  Yeah, in fact, that's, that was our whole reason for cheering this year
because that, uh, Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and --

B.136:  Right.  

A.137:  -- that's, that's who I follow quite a bit is B Y U but,   

B.138:  Uh-huh.  

A.139:  And, so we were kind of prejudiced towards him, good or bad or whatever
anybody thinks, but, yeah, they seem, he just, from what he was saying his dad
was a coach, his brother was ((in good)).

B.140:  Yeah.  

A.141:  I mean, it just seemed like a lot of people were involved -- 

B.142:  Yeah.  

A.143:  -- kind of like Indiana and basketball or something.  

B.144:  Right.  And, and supposedly, uh, uh, his brother, his younger brother is
graduating and supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better
than he is.

A.145:  Oh, really?  

B.146:  Yeah.  

A.147:  That will be interesting to see.  I know, uh, he's, he's been recruited
pretty heavily.

B.148:  Yeah.  

A.149:  He's not sure if he wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and --

B.150:  No, I don't know.   

A.151:  -- go to the Y.  

B.152:  Tex-,   

A.153:  I wouldn't do it if I were him.  

B.154:  Yeah.  

A.155:  Boy, if he doesn't live up to that, at least his brother's expecta-,
