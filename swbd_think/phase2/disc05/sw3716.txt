===========================================================================

A.1:  We could talk about my favorite subject [laughter].

B.2:  Cooking and #food, huh.#

A.3:  #Food.#  [laughter].

B.4:  What do you like to cook?

@A.5:  Uh, I don't cook a lot actually.  I have just started baking, so, uh, I am
kind of interested in cakes and, uh, muffins and stuff like that, but I can't
seem to get them exactly right.  So, I am just trying to perfect some things.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  I tried to make an applesauce cake.  Which I will never ever try to make
again.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  It was horrible [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter] Oh dear.

A.11:  I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible.

B.12:  [Inhaling] Oh, probably not.  I, uh, have, uh, a bread recipe that is real
easy that everyone always really does like.

A.13:  Uh.

B.14:  That, uh, doesn't require kneading the dough. 

A.15:  Oh.  Hey [laughter].

B.16:  And, it is always, it is wonderful.  It is, and what is funny is that you
use, uh, bran, all bran --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and it looks like it is a wheat bread.

A.19:  Uh.

B.20:  But, it is actually all bran flour --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and, uh, you know, it is just regular the type that, you know, yeast and
that sort of thing --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then
punch it down, and then, uh, make your rolls.  They really are good --

A.25:  Wow.

B.26:  -- and they are so easy to do.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  That is seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are
going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have
had my rolls before.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  #They request it.#

B.30:  #They# always ask me to, bring those rolls {louder}.

A.31:  [Laughter] I have not gotten any requests yet.  Last year, I had a
Christmas party, at, uh, my office, and I, uh, made the tuna fish sandwiches.
And everyone, uh, I mean, I think, everyone knows how to make tuna fish, so I
thought that would be easy for me to make and I can not go wrong with that,
and so I made it and, uh, I used celery seed in my, Do you use celery seed in
your tuna fish?

B.32:  No I haven't.

A.33:  And I just thought it was so strange, because I never, I thought that that
was what celery seed was for.  Was for tuna fish.

B.34:  Oh, how funny.

A.35:  And so, but everyone really, really loved the tuna fish and they just
couldn't get over the fact that I used celery in it and it just surprised me.
#Celery and onion and,#

B.36:  #Well, see I,# I have always used celery, I mean, I have used celery
before.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  But I never used the celery seed in it.

A.39:  Oh.  Yeah.

B.40:  Well, what else do you put in it besides the celery seed.

A.41:  Just like, uh, really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed and
I use like, uh, Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise
--

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.  But if you use
salad dressing with kind of, uh, you know, kind of, I guess a tart taste.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Then it comes out real good.  But, I, uh, it was the first time I have
[inhaling], I have ever found out that the, the, [laughter] nobody else used
celery seed.  I feel so silly but,

B.46:  See, I have never put bell pepper in tuna fish either.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Isn't that funny?

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  I was brought up with tuna fish, you know, where you put in, uh, oh,
chopped hard boiled eggs which is --

A.51:  Right.

B.52:  -- now is a no, no with cholesterol and, uh, 

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  you know, chopped up dill pickles.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  And that sort of thing.  The standard old tuna fish.

A.57:  Yeah.  I would put that too.  I just did not have those things.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Like I don't think I had eggs that night or something, but I would have put
eggs.  I would have put eggs in there also.

B.60:  But isn't that interesting?  So you,   

A.61:  Uh, strange.

B.62:  You, you use bell pepper and onion and --

A.63:  Celery seed.

B.64:  -- celery seed.  I will have to try that. 

A.65:  Do you use a regular mayonnaise or,

B.66:  Sometimes I do and sometimes I use the #Miracle Whip.#

A.67:  #The Miracle Whip.#

B.68:  It depends on what I have.

A.69:  #Yeah.#

B.70:  #And# sometimes, if I am using, like, regular mayonnaise, to spice it up a
little bit --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- uh, I will use a little bit of mustard with it.

A.73:  Yeah.  I do that also.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  Just to, to put a little zing in it.

B.76:  Yeah.  But not a bunch.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  But enough to, make it have a little bit more flavor.

A.79:  (( )) {very faint} I love barbecue.  Anything barbecued I will eat.

B.80:  I like, uh, to barbecue baby back ribs.

A.81:  Uh.

B.82:  And, uh, and, and, they are so easy to do if you, uh, have a good barbecue
sauce --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and you, uh, just cook them very, very slowly in the oven.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  And it is not hard to cook, like some meals are.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  And it is not, of course, it is messy to eat.  That is the disadvantage.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  And, uh, I make lasagna from scratch and people really like my lasagna --

A.91:  Yeah.  I like to make that too.  I make that once in a while.

B.92:  -- and so, uh, sometimes, I am requested to make that.  And that is not too
hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it.

A.93:  It is not really, once you have all the ingredients --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- it is just the layering really.

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  And not breaking the, uh, the, uh, pasta.

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  That is the hardest part probably.

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  But, uh,  

B.102:  Then, I have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie.  It just takes forever
--

A.103:  Uh.

B.104:  -- But, it is, uh, when the strawberries are nice, and big and fresh and
yummy.

A.105:  Do you make cheesecake?

B.106:  Uh, uh-huh.  I do.  But this one is basically, it is like a normal pie
crust.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  But then you use this sort of, uh, it is a cream cheese, uh, uh, layering,
but you, use, uh, thin it out a little bit.

A.109:  Uh.

B.110:  Uh, or make it a little fluffier and you put, uh, line the whole pie crust
with that --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- and so, it is sort of like in a way. Uh, using cheese --

A.113:  #Uh.#

B.114:  -- #cake,# but, and it is not a real cheese #cake and then you,#

A.115:  #And just put the strawberries,#
