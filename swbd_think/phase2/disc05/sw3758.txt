==========================================================================

A.1:  Tim and I were thinking about trials by jury --

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- and uh, I, I guess, I thought more highly of it until the, uh, recent,
[noise] William Kennedy Smith --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- case where they were telling about how they used, uh, what they consider
scientific methods to choose the right jurors to get the right results. #You
know, for their chance.#

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  What do you think about that?

B.8:  Well, uh, you know, it is like anything else, I mean, I guess I probably
should mention, I am an attorney and I, and I, although, I don't do trial work
now --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- I have done so in the past, and --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, I have to say that I have never been in the position to, uh, make
use of, uh, the types of techniques, but for years there have been, uh, books
written that everybody has access to about techniques in, in jury selection.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And, uh, you know, uh, I mean it kind of, the way it kind of really
actually works out in real life.  I don't think it is fair, uh, necessarily
for one side because they have a lot of money --

A.15:  Yes.

B.16:  -- to be able to, uh, it kind of, it strikes me as unfair that if you
have got enough money, you can pick the jury you want.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  And really the system doesn't exactly allow that anyway.

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  The be-, best you get on jury selection is if, if you have got to pick a
jury of twelve people, you get a certain number of what they call preemptory
strikes and a certain number of, of, uh, 

A.21:  [Throat_clearing].

B.22:  each side gets those and then there are are strikes, you know, an unlimited
number of strikes for what they call for cause.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And, uh, you know, obviously people whose, whose livelihood depends on, uh,
jury [rattling] trials are going to use whatever they can use to try, uh, to
improve their chances.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  And, and, you know, it's, it's, the unfair part of it is that not everybody
has access to the high powered techniques but then, then the, the saving grace
is that it can only get you so far.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  I mean, you know, it, you may find that the first three people on the panel
are ideal jurors for you --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- but, the other side is probably going to, even if I were sitting there
with no, uh, high powered computer input and what not, if I can just ask them
questions, I can tell that they are going to be good jurors for you and bad
jurors for me, I am going to strike them.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  So you are not going to get them.  I mean, you can't really get what you
want.

A.33:  Right [noise].

B.34:  You can just improve your chances of guessing who you think you want.

A.35:  [Laughter] Yes.  Well, I know, uh, fairly recently when that, uh, one of
the court sessions for John Wylie Price, 

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  I remember that, uh, [swallowing] and though I had to agree with some of
the things he did, I, I disagreed with that particular case because he, uh,
[throat_clearing] they made, they got a lot of mileage out that they, that
that was not a jury of his peers.  That, uh, they decided you know that he was
found guilty and then, uh, then they made note that none of the, the jurors
were uh, black or Af-, African American and, and it seemed to me that if he
wanted [laughter] if they wanted that, uh, I mean they chose them
deliberately.  I mean, because of all of the publicity that he got --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- from that.  And I really thought well, you know, one of their points
that they made on purpose was they chose people who they felt were not their
own peers in order to make the case against him weaker and it just seemed like
it wasn't very fair that that you know that was something that should have
been said at the very beginning and not cost the tax payers the money for that
court.

B.40:  Yeah.  Well you know it's it's has kind have been, uh, you see a lot in the
death penalty cases --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- that there are a lot of the attorneys, there are attorneys who strongly
believe that the death penalty is not right.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  And they, uh, have pretty much dedicated themselves to doing everything
they can to prevent, uh, people sentenced to the death penalty from being
executed --

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  -- and they will go through endless appeals and one of the things that has
been used, and it has been used most often, uh, in, in the death penalty cases,
is the fact that, you know, that the majority of people who are convicted if
they are blacks, they may not have any blacks or they might have one black on
their jury panel --

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  -- and they have tried to statistically tie this to the likelihood of him
getting the death penalty.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  But, they have never really been successful in it and the Supreme Court has
has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments #saying# --

A.51:  #Right.#

B.52:  -- that, that somebody didn't get a better trial because there wasn't a
certain quota of blacks on the jury panel.

A.53:  Right.

B.54:  And I really do think that those arguments will continue to fail because,
