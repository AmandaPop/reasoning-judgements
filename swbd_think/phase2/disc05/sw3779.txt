=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, so, what do you like best about golf?

@B.2:  I like to watch golf.  My husband plays golf and I've, I've really become
fairly acquainted with the game.

A.3:  Really?  

B.4:  It's pretty interesting to watch.  I think my favorite part of the game is
the putting part.

A.5:  Really?  

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Do you play?  

A.7:  [Laughter] Yeah, I play, uh, I play probably four or five times a week.  My
--

B.8:  Oh, my.  

A.9:  -- my wife and kids don't like it too much, but -- 

B.10:  Well I've already,

A.11:  -- it's such a great game.  I, I play thr-, you know, thirty-six holes
after work --

B.12:  Good heavens.  

A.13:  -- and then, uh,

B.14:  It must stay light out there pretty well.  

A.15:  Yeah, it does in the summertime.  

B.16:  In the sum-,

A.17:  In the winter, it's too --  

B.18:  Well, yeah, in the summer, uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- you know.  But, uh, you know, I go to the indoor driving range all, all
winter and, uh --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- and, uh, I practice putting and it's, it's a fun game.  

B.22:  There's a place here in Dallas that's called Dave and Buster's --

A.23:  Oh, really?  

B.24:  -- and they have a laser, well it's like lasers golf game where there's
three beams and you take your club and you hit the ball and they give you a
screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie.

A.25:  That sounds great.  

B.26:  It's really a lot of fun and it's, it's fairly comparable to some of the
nicer golf courses around here, the nicer public courses.  The price of it is.
If you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's.

A.27:  Well, I'll have to do that because I love golf.  

B.28:  [Laughter] It is a very fine game.  I think it teaches a lot of good, a lot
of good, uh, attributes --

A.29:  Well,   

B.30:  -- to people.  

A.31:  Cathy, is that your name, Cathy?  

B.32:  Yeah, you got it.  

A.33:  Uh, do [laughter], do you, uh, do you have a favorite golfer [laughter]?

B.34:  Do I have a favorite golfer?  

A.35:  Professional golfer, excuse me, my wife is making fun of me. 

B.36:  Oh [laughter], talking about golf on the T I thing?  

A.37:  Yeah, she hates it when I, you know,   

B.38:  Oh, when you start up -- 

A.39:  She thinks it's funny -- 

B.40:  -- on golf.  

A.41:  -- that I got golf as a topic because, you know, she dislikes it so much so
[child_talking],

B.42:  Well, you probably picked it, though, on your list of, of topics to speak
about.

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  Uh, I would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman.  

A.45:  Greg Norman?  Why?

B.46:  There's just something about the way he plays golf.  He just approaches the
ball so confidently and the way he hits, he's just really, he's got kind of a
funny swing, but beyond that, he's really, he seems a very confident player
and he does, he does play fairly well.

A.47:  Are you -- 

B.48:  What about you?  

A.49:  -- sure you're not attracted to him or anything [laughter]?  

B.50:  Well, that may be, too.  He's, he's not the most attractive guy on the,
[noise] on the tour [laughter], I'll say that.  But, uh, I guess after
watching for so long, for so long, I've been, I've been watching and hearing
about golf from my husband for six years, six and a half years --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- or a little more, [child_yelling] and after a while, you get to where,
yeah, you start watching who plays well and who doesn't.  I think Tom Kite is
another good player.

A.53:  Yeah, yeah, I like Tom, he's good.  

B.54:  He's got a real ugly stance, but [laughter] -- 

A.55:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.56:  -- he does -- 

A.57:  I agree with you there, Cathy.  

B.58:  -- he does play real well [child_yelling] and he, he seems to almost always
win.

A.59:  Yeah, he does.  

B.60:  So he, so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins
quite often.  What about yourself, who is your favorite player?

A.61:  Uh, [throat_clearing] I'd have to say, uh, I, I still like the Golden Bear,
you know.

B.62:  Even on the, even on the senior tour?  

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  I, I like the senior tour.  I, I think it's got more
personality.

B.64:  Well, yeah.  

A.65:  You know.  

B.66:  Well the guys,   

A.67:  And the names don't change every week, you know.  

B.68:  Yeah, there's one thing that's true, yeah.  

A.69:  So,

B.70:  You can always count on Lee and ChiChi and Don January and -- 

A.71:  Sure.  

B.72:  -- and, uh -- 

A.73:  Sure.  

B.74:  -- oh, yeah, the Golden Bear out there hitting them up.  

A.75:  Really.  

B.76:  Putting them in.  

A.77:  My kids, do you have kids, Cathy?  

B.78:  Uh-huh, yeah, I have a young boy.  

A.79:  I'm starting them off young.  I'm going to get them, oh, you got a boy?

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  Good.  

B.82:  Oh, he already plays golf.  He's not eighteen months and he golfs around
the house.

A.83:  He does?  

B.84:  Uh-huh.  

A.85:  Has he got a pretty good stance.   

B.86:  No, he's horrible, but [laughter],   

A.87:  [Laughter].  

B.88:  But he loves to, he's got a, a set of three little plastic clubs, and
little plastic balls, and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the
house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big,

A.89:  [Sneezing]. 

B.90:  play ball and bounce it around with his club, but he really enjoys taking
them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the
house so, 

A.91:  Huh.  

B.92:  Yeah, I, I'm already a golf widow and I don't mind it.  I mean, I know
where my husband is when he's out.

A.93:  Well, that's true.  

B.94:  And he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so, 

A.95:  That's true.  

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  He's out getting some sunshine anyway.  

B.98:  That's,
