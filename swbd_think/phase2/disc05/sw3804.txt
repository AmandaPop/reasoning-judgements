A.1:  Okay, Cindy, you there?  

@B.2:  Yeah.  

A.3:  Okay, what kind of dinner parties have you had?  

B.4:  Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Uh, and I had help with them.  Uh, and part of them I did were like a
buffet --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- and, uh, it, I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers
and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors
d'oeuvres and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick
--

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild, you can, I guess you could
use the hot if you wanted to.

A.11:  Whatever you like, huh?  

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  And, uh, you put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy and
then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen
minutes --

A.17:  Um.  

B.18:  -- and they are so good.  

A.19:  Oh, that sounds delicious.  

B.20:  #Yeah.#  

A.21:  #Yeah.#   

B.22:  It's making me hungry for them -- 

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  -- [Laughter] right now.  

A.25:  You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs, but -- 

B.26:  Have you?  

A.27:  -- they're just made out of the beef, you know.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  And, uh, with spices and things in them.  

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  But never anything mixed with Bisquick.  

B.32:  I, I've used that quite a bit and it, and it seems to work real well.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  Uh,   

A.35:  Um.  

B.36:  And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, t-, to feed, like I try to
do a ham and a turkey and --

A.37:  Yeah, that's -- 

B.38:  -- and,

A.39:  -- my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time.

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we
moved in here, uh, which I had things like that, but I always cooked them
ahead of time and then I just sliced them.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it.  Have you ever had
that?

B.44:  No.  What,  

A.45:  Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp and it's, in your macaroni salad that
you make.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.  

B.48:  Oh, I'll bet.  

A.49:  Yeah, I don't like the can, but the fresh.  

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  You know.  

B.52:  I'll have to try that.  

A.53:  Yeah, that was really good.  

B.54:  I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious.  

A.55:  Yeah, right, right.  But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular
sit down dinner, you know.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  Which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you
pass everything around, it seems like everything on your plate's cold.

B.58:  I know.  

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  I know [laughter].  

A.61:  So,   

B.62:  Well,   

A.63:  But anyhow, I,    

B.64:  Thank God for microwaves, you know.  

A.65:  Yeah, you can,  

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  always take your plate and just heat it up, you know.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties.  Uh, you know,
I have, like, maybe just a cou-, another couple over --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- for dinner.  

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas and I have my
family.

B.76:  Right, well I don't anymore.  Y-, it's been a few years and, and, uh, I
don't have, you know, over a couple either and --

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready and, and it, it just
makes it a lot nicer where a don't s-, spend all my time in the kitchen.

A.79:  Yeah, right.  

B.80:  And, uh, 

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  Spaghetti and,   

A.83:  Yeah, that's easy.  I always like to have that, too.  Yeah.  

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  Everybody seems to like that, too.  

B.86:  I know, I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.  

A.87:  No, everybody likes that.  

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven,
then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else --

B.90:  Oh, yeah.  

A.91:  -- all in there, you know.  Especially if a pork roast.  That's what I
love, with my d-,

B.92:  I like it, too.  

A.93:  [Laughter].  

B.94:  I do, too.  

A.95:  And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what g-, next
weekend when the Super Bowl's on --

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  -- I've asked a couple people to come over and I just, uh, had been
thinking what to have for that [laughter].

B.98:  Yeah.  Well, have you had any good ideas --  

A.99:  No -- 

B.100:  -- yet?  

A.101:  -- not yet [laughter].  

B.102:  Oh, [laughter] okay.  

A.103:  No, and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V.  I
want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting
in front of the T V.

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  You know, so, I'll think of something, just th-, that we can munch on over
there, you know.

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over
there and sit down.

B.108:  And that's the way to do it, too.  

A.109:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.110:  I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that [breathing] in
this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you and you don't
have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  And,   

A.113:  Preparing it, right.  

B.114:  And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?  

A.115:  Oh, it sure does.  

B.116:  Well,   

A.117:  Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,
