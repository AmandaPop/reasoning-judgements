===========================================================================

A.1:  Well Tom, what do you think about our public school systems today?

@B.2:  Uh, well I have, I have two kids in school and, and in comparing it with
people who live in other parts of the world, one of the, uh, things things
wrong is that our schools, our kids seem to go to school less of the, uh, year
than kids in other countries.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, it seems like the long summer break is something that only, uh, only
occurs in the United States.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, do you have any kids in school?

A.7:  No, I don't.  So, I am a little bit out of it.  I #can# --

B.8:  #Yeah.#

A.9:  -- look back to when I was in school which is getting further and further
away --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- and also I have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California
and I hear a little a bit about, from my sister, about [throat_clearing]
things going on.  Yeah.

B.12:  Well, some of some of the schools are trying to get into more of a year
around system.

A.13:  Yeah.  They are moving to that out there.

B.14:  And, uh, I guess there are pros and cons to that too.  I know, with, uh,
if, if it happened here I would hope, that, uh, you know, I have two children
that are two years a part.  I would hope they were in the same system.  So,

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  If you want to take a vacation you could. 

A.17:  Uh-huh.  I hear that they, that in, at least in the system that is going
out, uh, in California, where that I am familiar with that they do put
families on the same schedule.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  So, seems like that could get a little difficult to #do that but
[laughter],#

B.20:  #It could, it could.#  One of the other, uh, things is that, uh, there has
been a lot of talk about, uh, American schools getting behind in Science
compared to, uh, a lot of European schools and, uh, in Japan also.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  That their schools are, uh, are teaching more of the science, sciences and
putting out better, uh, graduates when in math and science, uh --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- for the future technology in various countries.

A.25:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.26:  And that is not a favorite subject for uh, my, my kids [laughter].

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  It is probably not for anyone, but it just seems like, uh, those are the
criticisms, the criticisms you hear over and over about the, uh, American
public school system and this is probably why a lot people [clink] go to
private schools instead.

A.29:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I hadn't thought about those things, but those
are problems.  Uh,

B.30:  Some of the, some of the [throat_clearing] people that I work with, uh,
they are some from various parts of the world and --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and, uh, of course, everybody likes to think their system is the best
but the ones in England and, uh, then Germany seem to, uh, have some logical
points about, you know, why do, uh, kids need a three month break in summer.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And, uh, I think that dates back to when America was agricultural --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- and children needed to help on farms.  

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  It has been quite a while since that has been the case.

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  #For the most part now.#

A.41:  #There is# no need for it anymore.

B.42:  So, that is one of the things that ought to change.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  I am not, not that happy to always be, uh, limited to just summers for most
vacations and and, uh, Christmas time, for the other, you know the other one --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with, uh,
families going on vacation.

A.47:  Right, Yeah.

B.48:  Tends to make some crowds.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Did you go through the public school system?

A.51:  Yeah, I did.

B.52:  Uh, uh, I did too and everyone else in, uh, my family, but seems like, uh,
uh, if people can afford, uh, the number of people go the private school route,
but that's of course not available to the average person.

A.53:  Right.  I know of a lot of people that are home schooling their children.
You know, just teaching them at home and --

B.54:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and for lots of different reasons, #you know.#

B.56:  #Yeah.#  I have mixed feelings about that too, I guess.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  Whether or not they miss the social interaction --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- as part of it.

A.61:  I know that a lot of them, uh, they hook up with like a home schooling
system and they get together.  The kids get together for lots of activities --

B.62:  #Yeah.#

A.63:   -- #outings# and stuff like that.

B.64:  That, that would help.

A.65:  Yeah, I think that helps.  Yeah, I wonder too.  I have mixed feelings about
it.  But, uh, I know that, uh, you know, I thought when I thought of problems
in the school system, it is not really the fault of the school system, but
there is a lot of, uh, you know, it's just, uh, I know kids are exposed to a
lot that, uh, you can't shelter them eventually, but, uh --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- it's hard at a young age.  #Some of the pressures and,#

B.68:  #Yeah.# It's, I think it is why a lot of people go to the home schooling
they --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- disagree with what they are exposed to either for religious reasons or
--

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- other reasons.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  Uh, the other thing that is happening now, I guess is,
