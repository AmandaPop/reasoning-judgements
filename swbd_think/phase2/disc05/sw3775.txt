A.1:  (( )).

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Okay.  

B.4:  Okay.  

A.5:  Okay, uh, what's your house like?  

@B.6:  Well, it's four bedroom, two bath, a brick ranch house, uh, on a, kind of
a quiet dead-end street --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- next to a big wide open field.  

A.9:  Um.  

B.10:  But we're two blocks from everything you need, including a small mall.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  And lots of businesses within walking distance.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  But, uh,   

A.15:  Your city's a big city?  

B.16:  Austin's about a million people.  

A.17:  Oh, I guess it is big.  

B.18:  So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a nice town.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  It's a real kind of a laid back place and, uh, kind of an
environmentally --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- conscious city.  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  Well, my, I have, also have a four bedroom house.  Uh, we have
three bathrooms, two upstairs and one downstairs which makes it nice because,
uh, it's right off the garage.  So when Gene's working on his cars, he can
come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house.  And
then, uh, [lipsmack] I have a, it's in a small city of like, uh, eight
thousand people, and, I don't know if you've heard of Modesto, that's the
closest big city.

B.24:  I've heard of it.  

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  I've never been there.  

A.27:  Yeah.  And it's on a cul-de-sac, uh, which makes it nice because there's no
through traffic, you know.  About all the cars that come in here are people
that just live right in here.  And, uh,

B.28:  I like that feature about where we live.  That was one of the reasons we
bought this house because there's only six street, six houses on the, on the
street, so.

A.29:  Yeah, it makes a lot nicer, specially, I, I imagine you have little kids,
right?

B.30:  No, no [laughter], not at all.  I have a, one kid, and he's t-, almost
twenty-one.

A.31:  Oh, okay, well, I have [laughter] one also, but he's, he'll be thirty-seven
in, uh, February.  So, but, anyhow, I have lots of little neighbor kids and
they all love me and I just, just worship them.  They can come in my house, I
have candy for them and cookies for them, you know, so, I'm just like their
aunt Rosy.

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  Uh, we still have, there are actually no kids right in the immediate
neighborhood, but, uh, we just moved here about two years ago and we still
have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- that come to visit and they expect [laughter] brownies [laughter].

A.37:  Oh, yeah.  

B.38:  Yeah [laughter].

A.39:  [Laughter] It's,   

B.40:  They'll, they'll stay till you bake a bunch.  

A.41:  [Laughter] But, anyhow, as far as decorating my house and everything, too,
I've, uh, stenciled, uh, practically in every room in my house which, uh, it
looked like it would be very hard to do, but it ended up being really easy and
it just really just makes the rooms.  You know, I stenciled right above the,
right below the ceiling line --

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- on the walls, li-, it looks something like a wallpaper border.

B.44:  Right.  

A.45:  But it's actually s-, a stencil.  

B.46:  My wife and I have never tried any stenciling.  Uh, we've always thought
we, she wanted to, anyway.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  Uh, somehow I feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling.

A.49:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.50:  We've done some wallpapering and, uh, my wife really likes to paint
different colors and things, so --

A.51:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- that seems to be, I think she ought to be a paint expert.  She's just in
the wrong career field.

A.53:  [Laughter] 

B.54:  [Laughter] We watch THIS OLD HOUSE faithfully on Saturdays and do all of
our own, uh, decorating work and repair work around the house.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And yard work.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.  Well, you can't afford to have it done, you know.  Plus it's fun.
I enjoy, you know --

B.58:  Oh, yeah.  

A.59:  -- going out and working in the yard and, you know, just doing everything,
decorating the house up and changing it.  In fact, I just bought a, a large
bird cage.  I had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that, not
that I want a bird.  I don't want a bird, but I have decorated it up with
flowers and I got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little
birds in there and I've got some dolls sitting in there.  It looks really,
really cute.

B.60:  My wife just remodeled, since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom with
all new sheets, comforters, things like that and paint and --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- she did a wallpaper border, new drapes [breathing], uh, looks, it's just
a whole dif-, different atmosphere in there.

A.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.64:  I kind of like, I like to hang out in there now during the daytime.

A.65:  Yeah, it's kind of fun to change, too, isn't it.  

B.66:  Yeah.  She picked a,  

A.67:  [Cough]. 

B.68:  for the walls, she picked a Fudgesicle color.  

A.69:  [Cough] A Fudgesicle color?  

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  Oh. 

B.72:  Which, I thought, well, I don't know if this will work, but when she
finished,

A.73:  [Cough]. 

B.74:  it really looked good.

A.75:  Yeah, it probably goes with a lot of different colors, too.  

B.76:  Yeah, I don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just
Fudgesicle walls and the, and the white trim.

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Uh, just to give it a little bit different look than -- 

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  -- what it's always been, or been lately anyway.  

A.81:  Uh-huh.  Well, you are the first man that I've talked to.  

B.82:  Really?  

A.83:  Uh-huh.
