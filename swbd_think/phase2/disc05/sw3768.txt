===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what kind of vacations do you like to take?  (( )).

@B.2:  Well, we've, uh, we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips
over to Europe so [laughter].

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  So, I, I guess those are the types I like [laughter].

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  We've really enjoyed them.

A.7:  Yeah.  Where have you gone there?

B.8:  We've gone to, um, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and England.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  We've been to Germany twice.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  But, um, I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Yeah well, I've been over there too.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  #Where have you been?#

A.15:  #I even.#  Let's see, um, mostly Germany and France.  

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  I lived in France for a year and a half so --

B.18:  Oh, how neat.

A.19:  -- I was able, but, I, once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation
instead of travelling around France I went to Germany --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- because, uh, I've got relatives there and I just --

B.22:  Oh, #that's neat.#

A.23:  -- #like it there.#

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  So, but, um, Austria, I found really pretty --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and Switzerland, yeah, and I, I lived in the Alps in France so I --

B.28:  Oh, how neat.

A.29:  -- anything in the mountains over there I just love.

B.30:  Oh, yeah.

A.31:  Then I finally made it to England, too, uh, on my way home, um, I lived in
Africa, actually, and on my way #home from there.#

B.32:  #You lived in Africa?#

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Wow.

A.37:  So, um, and you always have to go out, fly through, or unless you fly from
Nairobi, you have to fly through, um, uh, Europe on your way home.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  So, I went to England, and I really liked it there too.

B.40:  It's so expensive over there [laughter].

A.41:  I know, it's true.  

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  That's the one thing.

B.44:  It really is.  It just, it's, it's, I love to go over there, but it's so
darn expensive --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- to go over.

A.47:  Yeah, actually now you can get some really good deals flying over, but it's
--

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- once you're there you still have to spend money  [laughter].

B.50:  Oh, I know, just.

A.51:  Unless you know people, you know [laughter].

B.52:  Right.  Then you can stay with them, and --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- #yeah.#

A.55:  #That helps# a lot.

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  But.

B.58:  You know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  You know, I'd like to go to Hawaii some time, and --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- and, uh, we made it, we've, we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and
Niagara Falls.  So.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.64:  #Feel like# we've accomplished a little bit here.

A.65:  I haven't.  I've been, I've, most of my vacationing in the U S has been on
the West Coast --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- or this summer I went to Colorado --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and, uh, I'd love to go to the East Coast, #during the Fall.#

B.70:  #The, oh, the# it's, oh, I've always wanted to go there.  I've seen
pictures, and, and --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- it looks gorgeous.  We, um, we made a trip up the East Coast.  It was,
uh, in the summer --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- and it really is pretty.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  It's, uh, both coasts are really pretty --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- but, um, I love the Carolinas.  It's just gorgeous over there.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  I haven't been there, anywhere on the East Coast.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  Well, you'll just have to plan a vacation some time --

A.85:  Yeah, I guess so.

B.86:  -- and, and go over there.  Yeah, but there's, you know, there's a lot to
see here --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- but I just love going over to Europe because it's so, their way of life
is just so different than ours.

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  You know, we're so fast paced here, and over there, you know, every time
we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for
the check --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- you know [laughter] --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- they're so leisurely over there --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- and it's kind of nice to, to have that.

A.97:  Yeah.  So the type of vacation you'd like, um, like, would you go over and
spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places
in one week?

B.98:  Well, usually a bunch of different places.

A.99:  Yeah, main-, mainly probably because you want to see everything.

B.100:  Right, see as much as --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- you can while you're there.

A.103:  Yeah, I know.

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  How did you like Africa?

A.107:  Well, I liked it.  I was working in Cameroon, Africa --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- and it's not a, [inhaling] it's not a place for tourists, I mean,
they're not used to having tourists there, so --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- it's, you're kind of roughing it.  But, um, I liked it, I liked it.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  The people there are just very, very friendly and.

B.114:  What type of work?

A.115:  Um, I was working with an organization that does Bible translation.

B.116:  Oh, okay.

A.117:  So I was doing linguistic work actually, travelling around, finding out
about languages, and --

B.118:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.119:  -- uh, what they call survey work.

B.120:  Uh-huh.

A.121:  Find out where the languages are.  

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  So, I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people.

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  Um.

B.126:  That's neat.

A.127:  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  So.

B.128:  I've, I've always, um, I've talked to people who have been to Africa, and
they, and then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out [laughter].

A.129:  Yeah.

B.130:  Um, but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there.

A.131:  Yeah, my cousin came over while I was there, and she came to Cameroon and
then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around --

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  -- you know, close to Nairobi #in Kenya.#

B.134:  #Oh how# neat.

A.135:  So, she'd always dreamed of doing that too.  

B.136:  Yeah, that's #great.#

A.137:  #So.#  Yeah.  So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to
[laughter]? 

B.138:  Uh.

A.139:  It sounds like we've been to some of the same places.

B.140:  Yeah, it does.
