A.1:  Okay, it's pressed.  Are you still there?

B.2:  I'm ready [laughter].

A.3:  Okay [laughter].  So what's, uh, things that you look for when you go out
to dinner?

@B.4:  Oh, I just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and of course good food [laughter]. That's always, that's always a
concern, but just a nice quiet easy place --

A.7:  Huh.

B.8:  -- maybe candlelight something --

A.9:  Um, that sounds pretty.

B.10:  -- just to relax, you know --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- because I don't really go out to dinner that much, so.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Well, we don't go out to dinner that much either.  We try to get
out maybe like once every month and a half or --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- something like that, but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice
and clean, you know.

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  Um, I've been to some that's been terrible.  You know, you see cockroaches
crawling around and --

B.18:  Oh [laughter].

A.19:  -- [Laughter] everything, you know.  But I try to get one that's nice and
clean and then I like to, you know, good food and good service.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  So.

B.22:  Yeah, where you don't feel rushed, you know --

A.23:  Yeah, right.

B.24:  -- and you can just relax, and --

A.25:  Right, right.

B.26:  -- stay as long as you want.

A.27:  So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano?

B.28:  Well, nearby.  We're almost in Dallas.  We're just north of Dallas.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  So we have quite a bit between us and there.  It's about ten miles --

A.31:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and there is all kinds of restaurants and, I had one that was a
favorite for a long time, and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and
then it finally went out of business.

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  So, but it was really nice.  It had a fireplace.

A.35:  Um, that sounds beautiful.

B.36:  Yeah, it was really nice.  They had entertainment sometimes and --

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.38:  -- you could just really relax there and enjoy it.  

A.39:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well.

B.40:  But it's gone [laughter].

A.41:  This is only a little small city.  Uh, we have, uh, [cough] excuse me,
[cough] I didn't think my coughing would come back.  Anyhow, we have only
like one, uh, restaurant that's kind of nice.  You know, they have prime rib
on, uh, weekends --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city
called Wesley, and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food, and
the atmosphere there is really, really nice.

B.44:  Oh, that's nice.

A.45:  So, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to
Modesto --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- which is like twenty minutes away.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  But, uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city [laughter].

B.50:  That is probably very fortunate for you.  Do you have kids?

A.51:  Do I have kids?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Well, I have a son, but he's grown up.

B.54:  Oh, because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every
night, you know, and --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers, [laughter] so something's
happened here, but, but, um, you know, McDonald's is definitely at the top of
her list, and I hate these places.

A.57:  Yeah.  All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they, you know.

B.58:  Uh-huh, they do, and I don't think there's an ounce of [laughter]
nutritional value in anything they have.

A.59:  No, no, I'm sure there isn't.  

B.60:  Well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work and you're
tired and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that, and it costs a
lot of money to do it too.

A.63:  #I know.#

B.64:  #You know, it# adds up and it's not healthy, and I really got into that
habit for a while, but I got out of it again because --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- I just felt like --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- it was just too unhealthy.  

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  So.

A.71:  Well, let's see, what else can we talk about?  [laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter]  Well, how's California today?  [laughter].

A.73:  Oh, it's foggy and cold here.

B.74:  Is it?  That's what I've heard, yeah.

A.75:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah and it's.

B.76:  Have you always lived there?

A.77:  I came from Iowa when I was sixteen --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- so I've lived out in California for a long, long time.

B.80:  And you like it?

A.81:  Yeah, I like it real well.  

B.82:  Yeah, we've been.

A.83:  We used to live in Oakland, so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go
to there --

B.84:  Oh, yeah.

A.85:  -- you know, but, uh, then I quit work and everything and I bought a house.
I had a condo in Oakland, so, right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of
restaurants --

B.86:  Oh, that would be fun.

A.87:  -- Chinese restaurants, and they were really good, I really miss them.
#You know.#

B.88:  #Yeah.#  Do you miss living there?

A.89:  Uh, no, I really don't miss --

B.90:  #No.#

A.91:  -- #living there.# I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese --

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- dinner once in a while, you know. 

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  But, uh, as far as missing living there, no.

B.96:  Um.

A.97:  It's close enough if I wanted to go there, to San Francisco for dinner or
something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- you know, have dinner and then come on back.  But, uh, have you ever
been to California?

@@B.100:  Oh, yeah, I go all the time.

A.101:  Oh really?

B.102:  Yeah, well I have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there --

A.103:  Um.

B.104:  -- and she, um, is a world champion twirler --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- and her coach is in California.  So she went there for six years.

A.107:  Um.

B.108:  So I went out a lot with her.

A.109:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.110:  And, uh, yeah, I know California pretty well.

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  And I love it, #and# --

A.113:  #(( )).#

B.114:  -- we tug back and forth who's going to move, but I think he's going to
move because I'm the person with more to lose here.

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  I have my twelve year old in school --

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  -- and she's happy.  She always lived here in the south, and I have my
house, so --

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  -- I have too much to lose,
