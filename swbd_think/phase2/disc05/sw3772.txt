============================================================================

A.1:  But, I guess most of what happens, happens in Salt Lake which is just, just
about twenty miles south --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- of us and that is quite a bit bigger and they were just talking about
how they had these drive by shooting and stuff --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and it sounded like it was getting to be like L A a little bit [meow].

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Yeah, they they say it is getting a lot bigger.

B.8:  Well, I am a school principal.

A.9:  Oh, are you?

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  So your are right familiar with all that I bet.

B.12:  Well, it is elementary school.

A.13:  Oh, It is a what?

B.14:  Elementary school.

A.15:  Oh yeah.

B.16:  But, I have gang problems.

A.17:  Oh, yeah.  That young, huh.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  You are kidding.  At which,

B.20:  I am in a part of Dallas where there is a lot of gang activity.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  And my, I have through the sixth grade.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  But some of my sixth graders will be thirteen, fourteen years old.

A.25:  Yeah, so they are getting started.

B.26:  And they get recruited.

A.27:  Oh, you are kidding.

B.28:  So, uh, we, we have really very significant problems.

A.29:  I'll bet.  My wife was just talking to her mother and, uh, I guess they
said they had an F B I gu-, guy come to there.  She, she works in a middle
school and --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- they were talking about how the hats signify --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- you know, gangs and stuff like that and, uh, that, you know, some day it
will eventually past, but right now they say there are all kinds of kids
getting beat up because of the --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and, it's getting pretty darn scary.  I have got a little eighteen,

B.38:  It is surprising to me --

A.39:  It's,

B.40:  -- that it's through there because the only time I have ever been to 
Utah --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- I spent a week on the Brigham Young campus --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- at a workshop.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And it was very, uh, dramatically different that the people you saw than
what we see here.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Because you have no minorities, you know.

A.49:  Yeah, that is true.  Yeah, I think we have probably got it to a lesser
extent.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  I wouldn't say were, are anywhere close to some of those other places, it
is probably like what you have --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- but, it, you know, they say I guess a lot of the people that they the
gang related things, they put them in jail and then when they get out they
just say get lost, just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever
so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy
pickings, but you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  It's, it's pretty sad.  Like I say you see all these kids thirteen and
fourteen year olds, you know, being a school night, and they are out at ten
and eleven o'clock just roaming the streets --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- I just never remember that.  You know, it has been a while since I was
in junior high or high or even elementary school, [noise] but you I just, you
were never out after eight or nine o'clock on a school night, you know, if you
were even up out of bed you were lucky #seems like.#

B.58:  #But, of course,# you know, a lot of parents that are not really parenting
much.

A.59:  Yeah, that is true and you #know and I think when it comes,#

B.60:  #Have you that in Utah?#

A.61:  Pardon?

B.62:  Do you have that in Utah?

A.63:  Yeah, it is getting worse.  I you know, like I said #I,# 

B.64:  #Because I would think that# being Mormon influence there would,

A.65:  Yeah.  With that, with that Mormon influence.  It may not be as bad, but we
still get a lot of the two, uh, the two parent incomes, or the two income
families --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and, uh, I really think that is a lot of the problem.  You just don't
get all the values taught in the home that you use to get and and the kids are
left to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff
and I really thing that is where you are we miss a lot of the good values that
we are taught.  #Years ago it,#

B.68:  #Well I,# I work in an an area of town, like my school --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- is about seventy-five percent Anglo --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and that is very unusual --

A.73:  Yeah, oh yeah.

B.74:  -- in the Dallas Public Schools.

A.75:  I would think so, yeah.

B.76:  But, it's very, it is like the lowest socioeconomic Anglo.

A.77:  Oh, really.

B.78:  Yeah, it is what in the South we call poor white trash.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  And then the other significant percentage I have is Hispanic.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  And of course that is growing.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  But the kids that I have the biggest difficulty with are Anglo children.

A.85:  Oh really?

B.86:  And I, I have got lots of Anglo children who are just not really wanted by
anybody.

A.87:  Oh, not by their families or anything?

B.88:  Well, for example, I have a boy, now he checked out today.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  He is fourteen, he is in the sixth grade --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- he lived with his mother in Mississippi, he had been to he thought ten
or twelve schools in Mississippi --

A.93:  Jeez.

B.94:  -- then his mother, now his mother and father are not divorced --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- but they don't live together in a long time --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child
support for his children --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore.

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  So, they sent him here.

A.103:  Jeez.

B.104:  And here, he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend.

A.105:  Oh, jeez.

B.106:  And they pawned all of his personal belongings.  Like he had a Nintendo --

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  -- a V C R and some stuff.  They pawned that and he has just been tearing
my school up and he told me, he is going to be bad enough to be sent back to
Mississippi.

A.109:  Jeez.

B.110:  And today, they checked him out.

A.111:  Huh.

B.112:  And sent him back to Mississippi.

A.113:  You are kidding.    

B.114:  #Now those kids.#

A.115:  #You know# and it is so sad, I mean, sure it is the kid doing it, but who
really is half the blame for that.

B.116:  But those kids are ready starters for gangs.

A.117:  Oh yeah.  Unless some people show them some interest, show them some --

B.118:  Sure.

A.119:  -- love and,

B.120:  Something to belong to, give them identity, give them importance --

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  -- give them a certain security.

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  And, uh,

A.125:  Uh-huh.
