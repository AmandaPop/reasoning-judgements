REMARKS:        Speaker A had a noise [squeak] that may have been
a small dog in the background.

========================================================================

A.1:  Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free
zone there?

B.2:  No, I don't think there is any such thing,

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  as a crime free zone any longer.  

A.5:  I'm afraid you're right.  

B.6:  Uh, one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and
thought, oh, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and
screams and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house.

A.7:  Oh, my.  

B.8:  And they had stopped a, uh, b-, a stolen car -- 

A.9:  Oh, boy.  

B.10:  -- and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the
roof in the back.

A.11:  By your house?  

B.12:  B-, on my house [laughter].  

A.13:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  Aye, aye, aye [laughter].  

B.16:  So I'm very much aware of, uh, crime in the cities and the, and the concern
about it.

A.17:  Oh, my.  That's, that's got to be a frightening way to -- 

B.18:  It was.  

A.19:  -- spend an evening.  

B.20:  I, uh, I kept hearing noises and so I, I knew that I was not going to sleep
until I got up and went out and checked the garage, so I got a g-, my gun and
walked to the, you know, through the house into the garage.  There was no one
there, but I wanted to be sure.

A.21:  Oh, boy.  

B.22:  [Laughter] Is Plano beginning to experience the, the kinds of things that
are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the --

A.23:  Unfortunately -- 

B.24:  -- urban area?  

A.25:  -- yes.  

B.26:  That's -- 

A.27:  Yes.  

B.28:  -- too bad.  

A.29:  I think, uh, you know, as any city grows up, uh, you get the hoods and the
roof-, riffraff and --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- everybody else -- 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- in there, and I think, uh, you know, fortunately the sirens and
everything we hear are over on Spring Creek, but, uh, we've been, we've lived
here sixteen years and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- now you, you know, you can tell the change, for sure.   

B.36:  Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano
grow --

A.37:  Yes.  

B.38:  -- from what was really a, a small town to a city.  

A.39:  Well, with all the, uh, Central Expressway, uh, 

B.40:  [Laughter]. 

A.41:  with all the stores and the, uh, restaurants and the -- 

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- uh, convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime
pickings for people driving by.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  You know and,

B.46:  Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, uh, uh, shooting on
the tollway.

A.47:  That's, that couldn't be too far from you, neither.  

B.48:  Uh, well, it's farther west of me.  

A.49:  Okay.  

B.50:  I live over near White Rock Lake.  

A.51:  Oh, yes, okay.  

B.52:  But, uh,

A.53:  [Squeak]. 

B.54:  uh, it was really frightening to,

A.55:  [Squeak]. 

B.56:  think that, uh, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway,

A.57:  [Squeak].

B.58:  or for those people in the tollbooth.  

A.59:  [Squeak].  

B.60:  Uh, I never thought about someone robbing those, but, apparently, they do.

A.61:  I don't know, uh, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but,

B.62:  Yeah, it just doesn't seem possible, does it.  

A.63:  It's kind of, kind of stupid, isn't it.  

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought
of the consequences at the time.  It's, looks like --

B.66:  No.  

A.67:  -- easy pickings and away you go, right.  

B.68:  Yeah, and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, uh, the theft and
the, the violence that we see.

A.69:  I think you're right, uh, although I think that may be an excuse for
people, too.

B.70:  It, it is convenient, isn't it?  

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  I didn't know what I was doing.  

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  That kind.  

A.75:  Right, just like the old alcohol idea and -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  -- I think people, uh, I think when you have haves and have nots, you're
always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money
and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up --

B.78:  Uh-huh.   

A.79:  -- than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.

B.80:  Well, yes, and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System.

A.81:  #Oh, boy.#

B.82:  #And, uh,# uh,   

A.83:  Where do you work?  

B.84:  Uh, do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?  

A.85:  Uh, yes, I think I do.  That, uh, is that Amelia Earhart, -hart School
there?

B.86:  Uh, no this is over near Lincoln High School.  

A.87:  Okay.  

B.88:  Uh, just, not far off South Central Expressway.  

A.89:  That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?  

B.90:  It is a pretty rough area.  We're over by Fair Park.  

A.91:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.92:  And, uh, you know, you watch the people.  There are marvelous B M W -s and
Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street
outside these awful taverns.

A.93:  Huh.

B.94:  And the kids see that and, uh, they know that they can earn several hundred
dollars in a day where, uh, you know, running for, uh, drug dealers if,

A.95:  Definitely that area, that, that's big time.  

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  Big time there, sure is.  

B.98:  It surely is.  

A.99:  I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself (( )).

B.100:  [Laughter] Well, I'm careful.  

A.101:  Gee-, that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c-, area.  

B.102:  Yeah, it's, uh, a little scary sometimes and, uh, I manage the,
