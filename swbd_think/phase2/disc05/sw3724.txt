===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you work in a large organization now?

B.2:  Uh, well, I, I work in a, actually, it's sort of an odd situation right now
but, uh, [noise] I have until recently, been working in, in a, uh, in a large
organization.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And I currently maintain an office still at, at the place [noise] even
though I, I officially quit there a few months ago.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  But, it's, it's not really a large organization --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- but, uh, nearly five hundred people. #((How)),# 

A.9:  #Oh# yeah, that's pretty big [laughter].

B.10:  Yeah.  How about you?  Are you,

A.11:  I work in a hospital and I think #probably# --

B.12:  #That's,# 

A.13:  -- there are about seven or eight hundred employees.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  [Sniffing] I guess, um, the thing I was thinking about as I was pondering
this question is, uh, besides salary, it seems the people, if it's a large
enough place, need to feel that their job's an important one.  You know, that
they have --

B.16:  Huh.

A.17:  -- the respect of their fellow #employees and their boss.#

B.18:  #Yeah, not lost in the# in the crowd, huh.

A.19:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's more probably an issue in a large organization than
it would be in a small one.

B.20:  Oh, yeah.  I, I think, it, it, ((probably)) the thing is that it's always
fairly obvious in a small one.  Right.  #Because, uh, (( )).#

A.21:  #Right.  Everyone's so# integral.  

B.22:  Yeah.  Everybody knows what everybody else is doing and, and knows that
it's, it's generally important.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  #Upward# --

B.24:  #But,# 

A.25:  -- mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is
probably an important one --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real
important too.

B.28:  What, what about, what about, uh, advantages of large organizations?  I
mean benefits and things?

A.29:  Well, I definitely think that health care packages and that sort #of 
thing# --

B.30:  #Yeah.#

A.31:  -- are probably going to be easier to coordinate, #((you know)), in a
larger,# 

B.32:  #Yeah.  When, when I've# worked with a, with, I mean, th-, the small things
I've worked with really haven't had any, uh, any consistent, you know, or any,
any kind of quality package.  #(( )) they just kind of leave you on# --

A.33:  #Really.  In health care?#

B.34:  -- your own.  Yeah.  #I've, I've# --

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  -- had my own little business and then I've worked for small businesses.
And, yeah, th-, the only ones that I've had large, uh, uh, I mean I've had
health care and, and, and other kinds of benefits with, have been large
organizations.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  #Vacation and,# 

B.38:  #Also I# worked at the university and that, that's a, is a very large
organization.  And, uh,

A.39:  And were those good, uh, considering the, the size of that kind of
organization?  Did you feel like that you had good benefits?

B.40:  I, y-, y-, you know, relative to nothing, of course.  You know.  I mean,
i-, i-, it, I think so.  Uh, the question, you know, I mean, it's, it's, it's
handy to have them.  I just had gotten used to ju-, just not having --

A.41:  #Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.#

B.42:  -- #insurance benefits and things.#  Uh,

A.43:  Did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without?

B.44:  [Inhaling] Uh, typically, let's see, uh, typically, the, myself, I, I was
covered myself but my family wasn't.  You know, I had to chip in for them to
be covered.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  But it was pretty economical.  

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  Uh, especially relative to just buying your own health care package.

A.49:  Right.  That really gets prohibitive.

B.50:  Yeah.  And so, you know, so that's, that's handy.  Uh, you know, I think
that, e-, I'm amazed that, uh, at the one place I was working, uh, what they
calculate to be their overhead.  Uh, because of benefits, they figure, uh, I
mean something like thirty-five, forty or fifty percent of, of salary.

A.51:  Yes.  I've heard that too.

B.52:  And, you know [laughter] which, which is pretty amazing.

A.53:  It is.  E-, especially if you consider in some situations, people might
actually use that much [laughter].  Hopefully they budget for that and it
doesn't get used up entirely but --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- it's, it's a lot.  I think that those sorts of advantageous are nice.  I
know, uh, my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband
works for himself out of our home --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and, and, and offices elsewhere.  But he doesn't, [sniffing] he didn't
really ever pursue individual benefits and I think it makes a difference to be
able to have the security [laughter] of an #organization's benefits.#

B.58:  #I, I think so, yeah.#  It really does.  Uh, do you get other benefits
besides health?  Do you have life insurance and things like that?

A.59:  It, actually, it's interesting.  Just this last week, uh, they introduced
what the nineteen ninety-two package was going to look like and while the life
insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to, it's ((like)) ten
or fifteen thousand --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- uh, they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a
hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  The rest of the package is pretty good.  It's vision and dental #and, you
know, all the full medical.#

B.64:  #((Oh, o-, uh-huh)).# Yeah.  That's go-, I, I just had, uh, dental
insurance for the first time, uh, from, from an employer which I thought was,
was pretty handy.  #Really# --

A.65:  #Yeah.#

B.66:  -- took advantage of it, I think.  Uh, do, are you finding that, that, uh,
the packages, uh, that your benefits packages are shrinking?

A.67:  You know, I've seen that all over the bay area, in San Francisco bay area,
at least and probably true in California.  I haven't yet at our hospital.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  We've kind of been waiting with baited breath.  We're the only hospital
that I know of that doesn't have a, a partial payment or #I don't know if you
call it copayment or premium by# --

B.70:  #Oh, uh-huh.  Copayment, uh-huh.#

A.71:  -- the, the consumer.  So as, as of this date [laughter] my husband and my
kids are [sniffing] free cause they're dependents.

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  But I know a lot of other pla-, like you were mentioning, you know, you
pay.

B.74:  Yeah.  I, I mean, I typ-, you know, you typically pay for dependents.  And,
and not for yourself.  But I, I, the, you know, my company, the company I was
working with really has, has been, uh, you know, they don't want to cut back
benefits.  But on the other hand, they're real concerned about the rising
costs.  #And, and sort of scaling, uh, uh,#

A.75:  #Exactly.#
