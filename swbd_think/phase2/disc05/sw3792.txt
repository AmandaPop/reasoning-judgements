=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, you have, do you have any pets?  

@B.2:  Yeah, I do, I have, a, like a seven and a half year old dog. 

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And he's kind of a big Benji, longhair, he's white.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And he's the baby of the house.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  And tonight he has a friend visiting who's a pit bull.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  So, they're kind of running around -- 

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- chewing on things.  

A.13:  Yeah, do you have any children?  

B.14:  Uh --

A.15:  Or,  

B.16:  -- we have a child, but he's like twenty -- 

A.17:  #Oh, okay, I see.#  

B.18:  -- #so he's not like a ch-,# -- 

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- you know, like a little kid anymore.  

A.21:  Uh-huh, so, whether, uh, why do you have a dog?  

B.22:  Why?  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  Well, actually, we bought him for my son's thirteenth birthday.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And he has just been with us ever since.  And, uh, we spend more on him, on
his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves.

A.27:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.  

B.28:  And that's what pets are like [laughter].  

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  But he's like, uh, you got to have him.  When you come home and there's
nobody here, he's always here.

A.31:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.32:  So it's nice, nice to have him there.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  What about you?  How come you don't have a pet?  

A.35:  Well, mainly because it's just, uh, at this point in life I've had to be
available to travel and we live in an apartment right now, so, uh, they're not
even allowed here.  But, uh, when I was growing up, I always had cats and, and
then, uh, later, I guess, uh, the last few years that I was at home
[throat_clearing] my mother and father got a dog and I learned to really
appreciate dogs as well.  They're totally different types of pets, but, uh, I
see how dogs are really faithful friends.

B.36:  We were talking earlier tonight.  One of the ladies that's visiting with us
tonight [laughter], her dog is her life.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  [Laughter] [barking] And she ha-, she has a German Shepherd [laughter].
Been trying to tell her to get a husband and something [laughter], 

A.39:  [Laughter]. 

B.40:  and let the dog go [laughter].  

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  But she's not for that.  

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  She's in, she's in control with the Shepherd.  

A.45:  [Laughter] Okay, yeah, that's true.  

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  Yeah, my dad, I think, finds that he really enjoys his dog.  He says he's
the best friend he has [laughter].

B.48:  Oh, yeah, uh,    

A.49:  But, uh [laughter],   

B.50:  It's, uh,   

A.51:  I don't know, that's kind of sad, though [laughter].  

B.52:  I know our dog takes a nap every day with my wife and -- 

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  He's just, when we first got him, we didn't like dogs around the house or
in the house and, 

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  But now we put up with about anything.  

A.59:  Uh-huh, yeah, well, I've seen that there's, there's a lot of, uh, you
really have to appreciate their good qualities because there, there are
problems [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  They leave a lot of hair around and,   

B.62:  Yeah, it, it, it's just like now you have to vacuum three or four times a
week and --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- it just, I don't, we didn't used to have to do that.  

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  But, uh,   

A.67:  Yeah, but obviously you find him worth it.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  Or you'd get rid of him.  

B.70:  Yeah, we could never get rid of him [laughter].  

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  Yeah, you c-, you get attached.  I think that, like, maybe the first year
of his life we didn't get attached.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  We were kind of timid about it because we g-, we'd all had dogs as kids and
lost them or something and --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- and [breathing] we d-, we were afraid to, but he kind of rooted his way
in.

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  And, hey, I know times when he's had emergency problems we're just a
nervous wreck.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  So that's, that's part of being a pet owner these days.

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  And, I don't know, but cats, I don't know, you can have a cat in an
apartment, couldn't you?

A.83:  Well, not this one.  

B.84:  Oh. 

A.85:  I, it's not allowed here, but, yeah, the thing I like about cats is they're
more independent.  You can leave them and they can take better care of
themselves than a dog it seems like [laughter].  You know, 

B.86:  We -- 

A.87:  Depends.  

B.88:  -- never had much luck with cats.  We had some when we lived in New Mexico
and coyotes ate them.

A.89:  Oh, wow.  

B.90:  So,   

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  We were kind of timid about having cats [beep] again.  

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  Plus, we, we found [/beep] out that when they were kittens we really liked
them, and as they got older, they kind of ignored us.

A.95:  Yeah, they'll do that sometimes.  

B.96:  So, but -- 

A.97:  So,   

B.98:  -- with a dog, they don't do that.  

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  When I was a kid I, I raised parakeets.  

A.101:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  So those were, I always thought those were good pets to have. 

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  Extremely messy.  

A.105:  Yeah.  

B.106:  [Laughter] I mean,

A.107:  Yeah, oh, I had goldfish, but I didn't think much of those [laughter].
They were-, they don't have any personality.

B.108:  Yeah, they're, they're fun, but I like to look at fish.  

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  One of our favorite restaurants here in town has a humongous fish tank and
I like to go there just, uh, the food's not that great, but the fish tank is
wonderful to just look at them, you know, floating around.

A.111:  Yeah.  Yeah.  

B.112:  As a matter of fact, we got two dogs fighting right now.  

A.113:  [Laughter] Do you?  

B.114:  Yeah [laughter] [yelling] {in the background}. 

A.115:  Well, maybe I better let you go and go solve the conflict there [laughter].

B.116:  Well, there's enough people here.  

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  Actually the pit bull is from Dallas.

A.119:  Oh, really, uh-huh.  

B.120:  He lives up, he live up there, but they're down visiting and that's kind of
unusual to have two dogs in the house.

A.121:  Uh-huh.
