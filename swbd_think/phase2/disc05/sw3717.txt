===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what do you,

B.2:  How do you feel about it?

A.3:  Uh, well I don't know, I would hate, I, uh, would rather not have to have
it all taken out, but I kind of feel like it is part of living in a free
country [laughter].  Let's see what they take quite a bit out.

B.4:  Uh, I am a tax lawyer [laughter].

A.5:  Oh, yeah.

B.6:  And, uh, I, uh, but I agree with you.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  On, I, uh, I, uh, 

A.9:  You probably know, like I say, you are a lot more knowledgeable about it
than I am, but do you do for corporations, er-, --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- mainly?

B.12:  Yeah.  Corporations.  I work for a bank.

A.13:  Oh, do you?  Oh.

B.14:  Yeah.  And, uh, and {faint},

A.15:  So what do they think?  The corporation you work with.

B.16:  Uh, well, banks, banks are regulated, of course --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- by the, uh, by the federal government anyway.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  We don't have the franchise taxes [inhaling] which are [inhaling] not
federal taxes.

A.21:  Yeah. 

B.22:  Uh, I don't know.  I think they, I don't hear anything at work about them
really [laughter] [inhaling].

A.23:  Yeah.  Well I tell you, I work for a credit union.

B.24:  Oh, okay.

A.25:  So, that could be a whole other topic as far as, well, you know, how do,
what is the opinion around there about, uh, you know, credit unions not being
taxed and stuff.  Do they, have you guys had any, I don't want to say battles,
but do they, uh, a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff that they play
against, uh, unfair playing field and what not, and, whether or not credit
unions are getting, uh, being treated special and #do they get.#

B.26:  #We have had# that too because of the failures though.

A.27:  Oh, yeah.

B.28:  And, uh, whether or not they should be assessed more.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And, uh, the state has, uh, is in the midst of a reform probably in that
area.

A.31:  It is where they are going to tax credit unions, on a state level er-,

B.32:  Or, or, a higher assessment of them.

A.33:  Or just assess their --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- more for the insurance fund.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  Huh.  Yeah, that is, uh, I don't know, I think, I have always felt that if
we, the credit unions stick to their little niche they have that, then it
probably should not be, but it seems like more and more, uh, we are getting
out into a lot of the bank territories.  I do not know if it is too fair or
not.

B.38:  Uh, I don't know that it is fair, I think that it is, you know, the way
banking is being, uh, compacted.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  I work for, at, Nations Bank, which has just merged with C S Sovran.

A.41:  Oh, yeah.

B.42:  And, uh, you know, I think, I think a little competition is good.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Uh, but, down here a lot we saw [laughter] them doing things they should
not be doing.

A.45:  Yeah.  They are getting into business lending and things like that er-,

B.46:  Yeah [noise].

A.47:  Yeah, I, uh, the credit union I work for is one of the top twenty, about
the fifteenth largest, and, we are starting to get into that and that is where
I really have my questions as to whether or not we are, you know, we, we are
playing on a level field where things are getting taxed and stuff.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  But, and I don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they
get taxed, but I know it would have to, it would definitely have to effect our
bottom line if we got taxed.  There is no doubt about it.

B.50:  Everybody has gone down.  I think the individual levels are fine.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Uh, I don't think that they are perceived as, uh, as I learned in
school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a
hundred thousand dollars --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- uh, we wouldn't reduce the deficit.  But [laughter],

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  But a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that.

A.57:  Yeah.  We what do you, have you ever studied anything, like, flat tax or
anything like that, I mean, we have talked about it and how it kind be kind of
a recessive tax for the poor er-,

B.58:  Well, that is what sales tax are.

A.59:  Yeah.  That is true.  But I mean, on more of a national level, I guess.
Seems like it might, uh, get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop
holes and stuff, but maybe just have it based on two or three different level
and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff.  Is that,

B.60:  That, uh, flat taxes, I think, are a pretty good idea.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Uh, they are debating, of course, right now whether to bring in capital
gains again --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- uh, to stimulate the economy and, uh, find, from what, from what I
recall, it doesn't stimulate the economy that much, it just, uh, [laughter]
boots everybody's feeling of --

A.65:  Yeah.  That is more or less.

B.66:  -- how stimulating the economy.

A.67:  Yeah, touchy feely thing as opposed to,

B.68:  Yes.

A.69:  Yeah, I just always heard that the poor would e-, end up taking the worst
brunt of it because their, you know, their income is less and it would mean
being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power, but,
you know, I have heard different ideas to where they will make it so that, uh,
you know, depending on your income that it will be maybe a different level of
tax, but, seems like then people would do just whatever they could to hide
income.  So --

B.70:  Uh.

A.71:  -- like you say, it probably would not do much anyway.

B.72:  I, I, what happens is, I think it is a good idea, but they chip away at it.
I mean, the home mortgage --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- reduction is like sacrosanct.

A.75:  Yeah, that is true.

B.76:  You can't take away people, that said,

A.77:  [Throat_clearing].

B.78:  (( )) got one exception already.

A.79:  Yeah, that is true.

B.80:  And, uh, it, you know, well if we didn't have this exception, then we will
just add this one and it just gets, it snowballs.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  I, I think it is (( )) probably a good idea.

A.83:  Well, uh, are the taxes in, in, Texas, are they, are few state taxes very
high.  Or,

B.84:  We don't have state income tax.

A.85:  Oh, don't you?

B.86:  None.

A.87:  Oh, that is neat.

B.88:  But, we have got an eight percent state sales tax.

A.89:  Oh, that hurts.

B.90:  Yeah and, uh, and, of course, that is, that is a regressive tax.

A.91:  Yeah, it is.

B.92:  And it,

A.93:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.94:  (( )) it is not a,
