=============================================================================

A.1:  Um, well, I'm glad I got a male because [laughter] I'm going to need some
help.  Um, I haven't really given any dinner parties, but, um, I've had, you
know, friends over for lunch, that kind of thing.  But I promised my husband
that I would throw him a Super Bowl party, and so he's real excited about it,
but I don't know what men [laughter] like to eat [static] that it's different
from women. [/static] So, um, maybe you could help me out here in this sense
#and I keep,#

B.2:  #Well I,#

A.3:  I keep asking him, you know, what, what, what do you think we ought to
have, you know?  But I was thinking of like, you know, one of those subway
sandwiches, those long subway sandwiches, and maybe, uh, um, a pasta salad and
some chips and some beer and some Coke and, um, I thought a cake and he said
no, and so we're just going back and forth so,

B.4:  You could probably, probably get, uh, the sub might work.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, the beer will definitely work.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  A lot of that.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  And, uh, chips and dips.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Will probably work.

A.13:  Yeah.  He's, I don't really think men care, do they?

B.14:  Not really.

A.15:  #[Laughter].#

B.16:  #To be honest# with you.  I mean, I, I've never, I've never really cared.
I just like little munchies and #stuff.#

A.17:  #Yeah,# that's what he said.

B.18:  Basically, you know, just dip, chips and dip usually do it if there's
enough of it.

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  But males usually aren't into meals, #you know,#

A.21:  #Yeah.#

B.22:  like more th-, and not as much as women, you know, like just sitting around
and eat the finger sandwiches #and stuff.#

A.23:  #[Laughter] Yeah.#

B.24:  #[Laughter].#

A.25:  #[Laughter].#

B.26:  But, uh, I've al-, I've always, you know, just had chips, dip and beer.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  And just gone for it from #there.#

A.29:  #Yeah,# yeah.  So that, okay, I guess I'll do something like that.  But,
um,

B.30:  I got a, I got a good dip.

A.31:  Oh, really?

B.32:  Yeah, I, I stole it from a restaurant.

A.33:  Okay, what is that?

B.34:  It is, uh, you get a can of, can of, uh, chopped spinach.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And you get, uh, fresh parmesan cheese.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And you get, uh, uh, artichoke hearts.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Okay, you get, uh, a whole can of artichoke hearts, you take about, out of
the, I tell you, out of the, it's about a four ounce can of spinach.  Out of
that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  Okay, you stick all of it in a food processor, okay.  You need to get, uh,
and you gr-, mix it up real good.  It's almost pureed --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- to a degree, and you heat that up,

A.45:  [Child_yelling]. 

B.46:  and you take, uh, I'd say approximately,

A.47:  [Child_yelling]. 

B.48:  eight ounces #of,#

A.49:  #Uh-huh.#

B.50:  the fresh parmesan cheese and you, uh, put it in there while it's heating
up, and you mix it up.  And this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant --

A.51:  Oh, really?

B.52:  -- that I stole, yeah.

A.53:  Is this an artichoke dip?

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Because a friend of mine had that at, at one of her parties, and it was
really good, but when she told me it was artichoke dip I was going oh, #no.#

B.56:  #Yeah,# this is artichokes, spinach and parmesan cheese, and that's all
that's in there #(( )).#

A.57:  #As# I'm not much of a fan for #arti-,#

B.58:  #Oh,# I'm sorry, and heavy, it has heavy cream in it too.

A.59:  Oh, see, I thought there was something else.

B.60:  I forgot, forgot about that.

A.61:  Huh.

B.62:  [Child_talking] It has heavy cream in there.  I, I, I just, I fling it
every time I do it.  #I,#

A.63:  #Huh.#

B.64:  mean, I don't have anything written down.  I just kind of know #it,#

A.65:  #Yeah.#

B.66:  from, I just go by taste and texture.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  I've never really written it down, but they never give me any specs on it,
I've just [child_talking] kind of had a variance of it, you know, every time I
go in, and it gets pretty close.  You've just got to watch how much spinach
you put in there.  You've got to put it a little bit at a time.  It should be
a, uh,

A.69:  [Child_talking].

B.70:  uh, li-, about a guacamo-, lighter than a guacamole color.

A.71:  Yeah, that's ap-, it sounds like the same thing my friend served, and it
was really good.  #But when she told me,#

B.72:  #Yeah, and it's served [child_talking],#

A.73:  it had artichokes in, I #thought oh, ((God)).#

B.74:  #Yeah, and it's served hot#  [child_talking].

A.75:  [Laughter].

B.76:  It's served hot.

A.77:  Yeah, uh-huh, it was.

B.78:  Yeah, and it's real good.  I don't know if they'd go for that or not, but
it's just a real good #dip.#

A.79:  #Well,# my husband loved it.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  Yeah, #he really did.#

B.82:  #It's a fan-,# I think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip.

A.83:  Oh, really?

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  Huh.

B.86:  If you ever go there, try it.  That's the stuff #[laughter].#

A.87:  #Yeah,# okay.  Yeah, and he wanted to, uh, some, uh, chili dip that I
usually make too so, 

B.88:  Chili is usually, guys usually go for chili, #now that you,#

A.89:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.90:  now that you mention it.

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  Probably go for chili and beer.  That's always a good gas burner.

A.93:  [Laughter].

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  Yeah, and no women and children allowed.

B.96:  That's right #[laughter].#

A.97:  #[Laughter].#

B.98:  Ple-, plenty of ceiling fans going.

A.99:  #[Laughter].#

B.100:  #[Laughter].#

A.101:  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, um, let me see, we went to a Christmas party and,
uh, a friend of mine had this and it was, she had, she was the one that had
that dip.  And another thing that my husband really liked that I, and I liked
too that I would have never thought of serving, and it was really easy, um,
and it's, it doesn't sound good, but when you all put, when you put it
together and you taste it, it's excellent.

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  It's, um, the Mexicorn and corn chips.  You mix all that together with a
bottle of the Catalina dressing.

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  And you, and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that.

B.106:  Huh.

A.107:  And it is really good.
