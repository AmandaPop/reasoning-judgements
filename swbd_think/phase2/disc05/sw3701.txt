A.1:  Okay, Carolyn, what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work?

@B.2:  Uh, I can actually wear anything I want to.  However, I generally wear,
uh, suits or dresses.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  How about you?

A.5:  Uh, well, in my company we do have to dress up, and they don't say that you
have to, um, dress in a dress for women, but they strongly urge it.  So, it's,
it's kind of an unwritten law.

B.6:  Well, the company that I work for, uh, we, it's very casual, we don't see
any people, there's a plant out in the back, and then I'm in the office
section, and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear
jeans or whatever you wanted to, which, to me, dressing down is, you know,
like wearing pants and a jacket --

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- or something.  But, uh, even though I don't have to dress during the
day, you know, in anything that dressy, I still feel better, I feel more
professional when I'm dressy.

A.9:  Exactly.  It's puts, um, puts forth a better image.  Uh, my company doesn't
usually have casual days.  We had our first one in four, at least since I've
been there, which is four years, not too long ago, and [inhaling] I didn't
feel comfortable dressing like, many people came in like warm ups and,

B.10:  You're kidding.

A.11:  No, and I.

B.12:  That's casual [laughter].

A.13:  Yeah, and I don't feel, I, I wore, you know, a nice pair of pants and, and
blouse --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- but I, I, I just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around
everybody at work.

B.16:  Would I assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it?

A.17:  Oh, well, it was just recently, so I don't know if they'll do it again.
The way some people looked I would doubt it [laughter].

B.18:  [Laughter] Well, that's what I always thought.  Actually, uh, the gals in
our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what I
considered casual --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- but [laughter],

A.21:  I don't know.  It just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just
want everybody to think of you, you know, as a, a, professionally, you, you
don't just want to have the real casual look all the time.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  Do you work for a large company?

A.23:  Well, we've got two hundred people in our office, but we're the corporate
office, so, um, it's, it's relatively large, but, I mean, I have a job very
much longer, so I don't want [laughter] to say too much.

B.24:  And, it affects, uh, you know, being in the corporate office, how you have
to dress, too.

A.25:  Exactly --

B.26:  Do you.

A.27:  -- we have to hold the image for everybody.  

B.28:  Do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of.

A.29:  I would like to.  You know, I dress as nicely as my budget allows
[laughter].

B.30:  I understand [laughter].

A.31:  And, and, you know, I mean, it's, it's a lot better than some people there,
and it's not as nice because I don't have the money of others, you know.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  What about you?

B.34:  Uh, I have never, I really have not worked for very many companies that I
had a female role model.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  Um, the, we have some, I'm sure, in our corporate office, but I've not met
them yet, but, uh, the last few jobs I've had, well, there was, two jobs ago,
there was a girl in the office, uh, that I tended to try to emulate
#somewhat.#

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  But, uh.

A.39:  So you don't work with many women?

B.40:  No, not too many.  I,

A.41:  And I work with all women --

B.42:  Do you really?

A.43:  -- and my husband does, well not all, but the majority --

B.44:  Majority?

A.45:  -- and my husband, he works in a bank, and he works with all women.

B.46:  I'm sure that's true.

A.47:  Yes.

B.48:  I used to be in banking, and you're right, the majority of the people
there, uh.

A.49:  At least at the lower levels, you know [clicking].

B.50:  Exactly, (( )).  What, oh, someone, never mind, that's a call coming in.

A.51:  Okay.

B.52:  We'll pass that.

A.53:  What about season to season?  Do you change?

B.54:  Um, I probably get a little bit more casual in [clicking] summer in then,
in that I would wear a more casual top under some of my suits --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- than I would wear in the winter.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  But our offices are rather cold, so I, I'll tend to try to dress warmly,
too.

A.59:  Exactly, I, I do the same, and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe.  I
may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter, but I don't, I don't change
a whole lot, because it's, it's, we're environmentally controlled.  #You
know.#

B.60:  #Uh-huh.#

A.61:  You end up wearing the same thing.

B.62:  Well [clicking] that's another thing.  Uh, how do you wear your skirt
lengths?

A.63:  [Inhaling] Below the knee [laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  I, I, I don't have nice knees.  They're kind of knobby so.

B.66:  [Laughter].

A.67:  On the knobby side, I.  What about you?

B.68:  Well, I, they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- to, uh, mid calf.

A.71:  Halfway up the knee?  You must have better.

B.72:  Not halfway, not halfway up my leg --

A.73:  Oh, ok-,

B.74:  -- halfway up my knee.

A.75:  Oh, okay.

B.76:  Okay, my, half of my knee might.

A.77:  I, I, I'm thinking halfway between the knee and your, say --

B.78:  I.

A.79:  -- your --

B.80:  And my.

A.81:  -- hip.

B.82:  I'm a little too old for that [laughter], 

A.83:  [Laughter].

B.84:  for one thing, and it's terribly unprofessional.

A.85:  Well, it, that it is, but I know a lot of women who, who do wear their
skirts, and they have been reprimanded in our company before.

B.86:  Really?

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  Also I was going to just mention that I wear what, you know, my, my, my
wardrobe, how should I say it, I wear what I can fit into [laughter].

B.90:  [Laughter]  You mean, you have fat days and thin days.  

A.91:  Oh, yeah, fat months, thin months, you know.

B.92:  Right now, I'm having a fat month.  I know half of my clothes don't fit me
since the holiday season.

@@A.93:  Exactly, the same for me, but I'm working on it, but I'm not doing a very
good job at this point.

B.94:  Well --

A.95:  I haven't gotten serious yet.

B.96:  -- we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas.

A.97:  That's right.  

B.98:  [Laughter].

A.99:  That's right, but I'm so used to eating now, it's hard to get out of the
habit.

B.100:  Well,
