============================================================================

B.1:  [Talking].

A.2:  Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, um, the care
of the elderly.

@B.3:  Yes, I have.  In fact, uh, [breathing] just a little over, just a little
less than a year ago, uh, my mother [/talking] went to be with the Lord, and
we cared for her the last, oh, seventeen months of her life here in the, at
home.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  Aside from, uh, [lipsmack] having to, uh, take her to the hospital and,
uh, you know, those times, well, she was there in the, the regular hospital.

A.6:  Right.

B.7:  And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer, and so the
doctor elected to have her, uh, finish out, uh, in the hospice program.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  And, uh, I, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing
home, because, uh, she's around her own fa-, you know, the, the elderly parent
in question is around their own family.  The, uh, hospice program provides a
hospital type bed.  Well, it is a hospital bed, and all the oxygen,

A.10:  [Noise].

B.11:  stuff and a, uh, and a visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

A.12:  Well, that's #nice.#

B.13:  #And# it's all taken care of by, by, uh, Medicare, uh, [lipsmack] and,
uh, it, it's, it's really neat, uh.  And I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't
banish, uh, my old loved one to a, to a warehouse.

A.14:  No.

B.15:  And that's, that's what I basically, uh, view a nursing home as, a
warehouse, so #[laughter] that's,#

A.16:  #[Throat_clearing]  It's# really sad [breathing].

B.17:  Pardon me?

A.18:  It's really a sad situation.

B.19:  Uh-huh. #(( )).#

A.20:  #And,# uh, I think a lot of people struggle with.  #I,#

B.21:  #((Oh)).#

A.22:  I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, you know, the parent
#is,#

B.23:  #Uh-huh.#

A.24:  doesn't always want the in-law living in the house.  Is that right?

B.25:  Right.  

A.26:  Well, that's really sad.

B.27:  Yeah, I know.  But, uh, in this case, uh, spouse and I, uh, are, uh, we're,
are, are, uh, united in this area #because,#

A.28:  #Uh-huh.#  {faint}

B.29:  I guess her father, her grandfather and grandmother both lived with, uh,
[lipsmack] her parents, uh, th-, th-, their golden years too, so --

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  -- this isn't like, uh, uh, just one, one, uh, instance.  In fact, uh, her,
uh, uh, experiences were, were invaluable --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- to me.  Uh, [laughter] in fact, I don't know if I could have, uh, held
up, uh, you know, without my wife, uh, helping in #this,#

A.34:  #Right.#

B.35:  this, in this case.

A.36:  Yes.  Well, I know when the, I remember being a child and my grandmother
had had [noise] se-, several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents
tried to keep her in the house, and they did for a long time.  I #couldn't,#

B.37:  #Uh-huh.#

A.38:  tell you how long, until she got, uh, where she had to have complete care,
#((and so)),#

B.39:  #Uh-huh.#

A.40:  they couldn't, you know, keep her in the house anymore, and it was really
hard on everyone.  She had to have, you know, twenty-four hour a day care.
And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at
that time --

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  -- just a block or two from our house.

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  And that, um, they put her there, and [lipsmack] we all went just
constantly until she died.

B.45:  Oh, okay.

A.46:  But it was very hard on everyone to see, you know, grandmother be like
that, and I don't know that, you know, [laughter] I don't, being so young, I
don't remember why.

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  You know, what was, why she had to go there.

B.49:  Well, maybe, well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was
just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of
taking care of herself in any way.

B.51:  Oh, boy, #yeah.#

A.52:  #And that# that, they couldn't, they found that they could not --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed.

B.55:  Uh-huh.  Well, then, then there's almost, then there's almost no, no, uh,
uh, choice left to her then [noise].

A.56:  No, but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned,
though, #you know,#

B.57:  #Uh-huh.#

A.58:  in the nursing home.  I do remember the other patients there, uh, [noise]
being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got
some interaction with someone.

B.59:  Right.  In fact, just, uh, just, uh, sit and chat with them for five
minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- regardless of what it is.

A.62:  Right, right.  And I guess that's hard on people to give, [breathing] give
up their lives.  If they're busy they don't [breathing] you know.

B.63:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.64:  It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, #I
guess.#

B.65:  #Right.#

A.66:  If you can afford them.  But, anyway.  #Well, I'm,#

B.67:  #And then, then,#

A.68:  glad it worked out good for your family.

B.69:  Oh, yeah, it did, and I was just pr-, I just praised the Lord that, that we
were able to, uh, [lipsmack] have, uh, uh,
