also talks to someone else in room.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Do you hear the topic Carol?

B.2:  Yeah, something about uh, returning goods and, uh, if they are getting any
better than they use to be.

@A.3:  Right.

B.4:  I haven't had any real, uh, recent problems with that [popping]. I have
been a little bit leery.  I have mail ordered, uh, a, uh, [popping] video
camera from New York.  Uh, I was worried that that might, uh, cause me a
problem, but so far it looks like it has been a good deal [noise].

A.5:  Oh, well good.  I feel the same way.  Just the last few years things that I
have purchased have been [popping] [noise] you know, pretty good quality, have
worn well as far as clothes or, uh --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- driven well as far as cars and, uh, sort of lasted [children] you know,
for a good part.

B.8:  Could you hold on just one second?

A.9:  Yes.

B.10:  Hey.  I am on the phone.  Please be quiet {talking to someone in the
background}. [Clicking] I have got a six year old that is going [popping] at
it.

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  Out of his mind.  He acts like he just ate a pound of sugar [laughter]
[popping].

A.13:  [Laughter] I think the only problem I have had [popping] in the last two or
three years I was in Germany a couple of years ago and bought a comforter and
some pillows, and some pillow cases.  I didn't receive everything but --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- you know, you sort of take that chance when you buy something like that.

B.16:  [Noise]  Do you buy, uh, do you buy much mail order?

A.17:  Pardon me?

B.18:  Do you buy much mail order?

A.19:  Oh, a little bit.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  Do you have any problems with that at all?

A.21:  No, I just bought one of those little handy dandy singer sewing machines.
My wife, you know, the one you use in your, the real small one that fits in
your hand.

B.22:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.23:  I purchased one of those.  The only complaint I might have there is that it
takes so long to get the item.

B.24:  Oh, yeah [popping].  Well some places are good about sending by U P S or,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].

B.26:  some other way but, I think most of the time I, uh, maybe it is just the
kind of shopper I am, I will, uh, decide on the kind of thing I want and, uh,
try to do my homework to to find which brand I think is probably going to be
the best thing and, uh, generally I am, you know, pretty well happy with it
afterwards.  Sometimes you may find it, uh, on sale elsewhere but, uh, maybe
it is the kind of shopper de-, determines what kind of goods you get.  #Know
what I am saying?#

A.27:  #You bet.#  Yeah.  A lot of times I will do the same thing.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  One thing that happened recently, about three weeks ago, I bought a new
pair of glasses and, uh, [throat_clearing] two days after I bought them, I
picked them up and went back two days later which was four days after I
purchased them to, uh, get them adjusted and I noticed they were running a
thirty to sixty off sale.  So,

B.30:  Oh.

A.31:  I paid the higher price.  I did ask for a little interview with the manager
and he came over and he, uh, ran me a few free goods, you know, to make up the
difference.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Well #at least they (( )).#

A.33:  #Which# I thought was fair.

B.34:  Trying to, uh, give you some kind of concession there.

A.35:  Sure.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  But overall #I'm, uh.#

B.38:  #I am trying to# think, what, the last thing was that I turned in or wanted
to take back, I bought some clothing.  I don't know if you get these Lands In
catalogs --

A.39:  No.

B.40:  -- they, uh, [breathing] make mail order clothing and most of it is very
good.  I bought five or ten shirts I would guess over a course of oh four or
five years and, uh, they have been very good with the exception of one that had
the uh, button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it.

A.41:  Right.

B.42:  And, uh,  

A.43:  Any trouble getting it back?

B.44:  No, they are real good.  In fact I had the shirt for actually I probably
had it for over a year.

A.45:  Sure.

B.46:  And the only reason I called them on it is because I had, 

A.47:  [Cough].

B.48:  similar shirts that held up for several years and, uh, they said
regardless that you have you know worn it for a year or over a year, we will,
uh, take it back and give you a new one.

A.49:  Actually, I buy most of my clothing from like the, the bigger guys, the,
uh, dealers of the world, people like that because --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  --  they, they don't have any trouble returning goods they --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- they purchase so much from these manufacturers, you can return anything.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  So, generally speaking, you never have a problem taking things back to them
because it didn't wear properly or it came apart of something.

B.56:  Well, I think that is, uh, that's really just good business, you know.

A.57:  You bet.

B.58:  If you want repeat business which a lot [popping] of those retailers do,
you have got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him
feel like they have occasion to go back and want to go back.

A.59:  You bet.

B.60:  You know, that is like I have seen on this mail order, if they were, uh,
skin flints about it [noise] and wouldn't, 

A.61:  [Throat_clearing].

B.62:  take back [noise].  They, they, uh, depend on that kind of a reputation
so much.

A.63:  Oh, absolutely.

B.64:  [Throat_clearing].

A.65:  (( )) the same thing I buy, a few things from Kebelsk.

B.66:  Oh yeah, they they are sporting aren't they?

A.67:  Right --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69: -- sporting goods and, uh, sort of the same way, you can have, uh, a
certain amount of time period while you can just return something to your,
dissatisfied with it in anyway and --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- they are very easy to get along with and, uh, they don't mind taking
something back.

B.72:  You said you had bought, uh, cars recently.  What kind of cars have you
bought?

A.73:  Bought a Lincoln.

B.74:  Oh.

A.75:  And, uh, uh, with the exception of someone hitting me and tearing it up a
little bit.  It is still a very nice car.  About a ninety-one.  It is about a
year old now.

B.76:  Uh-huh [popping].  You haven't had any problems with it at all, huh?

A.77:  No, not really.  You know, it is like the old, uh, saying, they don't build
things like they use to and I really believe that in some situations, but, uh,
probably in cars, that is very true.

B.78:  [Noise] Uh-huh.

A.79:  But they don't build them like they use to but,  

B.80:  What is your feeling about American versus foreign?
