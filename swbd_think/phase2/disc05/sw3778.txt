=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  And you want to talk about this weather?  

@A.3:  [Breathing] Yeah.  

B.4:  #Wow [laughter].#  

A.5:  #It's something else.#  

B.6:  I want to talk about how mild it was at Christmas time.  

A.7:  Yeah, how about that, huh.  

B.8:  Well, that was, uh, totally unbelievable.

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  For the first time in a long time I left plants outside and they didn't
freeze.

A.11:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.12:  [Laughter] So that was pretty good.  

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  Uh,  

A.15:  It's, uh, #uh# --

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  -- uh, I think it was last year around this time, it was when we had the
really, really hard and cold snap.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  I had a pipe break on me so it -- 

B.20:  Oh, you did?  

A.21:  -- flooded the house and everything.  

B.22:  Oh, that's terrible.  

A.23:  [Laughter] So I was trying to be prepared this time around.  

B.24:  Well, what did you do to prepare for that?  

A.25:  Uh, well, it was an outside pipe.  

B.26:  I see.  

A.27:  So, this time I made sure I wrapped them up really good.  

B.28:  Oh, you did?  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  Oh, good for you.  

A.31:  [Laughter]. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  I don't want to go through that again.  

B.34:  No, I, uh, that happened to a friend of ours, actually they have a
condominium --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and, uh, they went out to the grocery store and were out for, oh, a
couple of hours --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- and when they came home the, the pipe [cough] {in background} had
broken, and --

A.39:  Oh.  

B.40:  -- their ground floor was flooded.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  So, uh, it, it's, it's a major horror when -- 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- when that kind of thing occurs.  

A.45:  Well, with us, we were out of town over the Christmas holiday --

B.46:  Oh. 

A.47:  -- and our neighbor called us to say hey,  

B.48:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.49:  you guys, did you leave the water running? [laughter]. 

B.50:  Oh, no, uh-huh.  

A.51:  [Laughter] They saw the, the water come out from under the door.

B.52:  [Inhaling] Oh, my goodness.  

A.53:  [Laughter]. 

B.54:  Isn't that a terrible thing?  

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  So we cut our vacation short.  

B.58:  Oh. 

A.59:  But, I, I, 

B.60:  [Clicking].

A.61:  guess it wasn't too bad.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  We ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and -- 

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- part of the upstairs so,

B.66:  Oh, my goodness, uh,

A.67:  It wasn't, it wasn't real pleasant, but, uh -- 

B.68:  Uh-uh.  

A.69:  -- you know, looking back, it was a good deal -- 

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- because we did need new carpet [laughter].  

B.72:  Well, you know, sometimes, in a funny kind of way, life treats us like
that, that something we wouldn't normally do, when we're placed in the
circumstance, we go ahead and do it and then, uh, things are kind of better
afterwards --

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  -- and, it, it ultimately gives you an uplift.  

A.75:  Exactly.  

B.76:  I, I, I guess you have to look at it like that anyway.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Or you might get depressed [laughter].  

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  And God forbid [laughter].  

A.81:  [Laughter] That's true. 

B.82:  But, anyway, but, uh, we had visitors from New York.  

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  I'm really not from this area, you must detect that, I'm originally from
the New York area --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- and we had visitors, uh, both from New York and from California at
Christmas time.

A.87:  Um. 

B.88:  And, uh, usually it is, uh, somewhat cold, I mean cold enough to put on a
winter coat --

A.89:  Sure.  

B.90:  -- or at least heavy sweaters.  

A.91:  Sure.  

B.92:  And it was so mild here,  

A.93:  [Laughter]. 

B.94:  that, uh, they had to, of course, poke several funny jokes at us down here
with this funny weather, 

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  and, you know, whatever.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  Uh, but, uh, I think they were very, uh, pleasantly happy #because# --

A.99:  #Sure.#  

B.100:  -- one person has some, uh, arthritis kind of stuff -- 

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- and, uh, when it gets very cold, they all crink up, you know [laughter].

A.103:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.104:  And, uh, we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year, so --

A.105:  That's, great.  

B.106:  -- we were, uh, very grateful for that kind of thing.  

A.107:  Yeah, well, so you had the kind of weather that, uh, it was nice to go out
at night on.

B.108:  That's right, uh-huh.  

A.109:  Yeah, that's great.  

B.110:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Of course, in California, they have such a [child_talking]
steadily more moderate climate --

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- that the temperatures, even in the areas around San Francisco, we used
to live down in that Bay area, the temperatures never got excessively cold.
If it got down around thirty-two, just about --

A.113:  Uh-huh.  

B.114:  -- uh, then the people would start panicking over the artichoke, uh --

A.115:  Oh. 

B.116:  -- #crops and# -- 

A.117:  #I see.#  

B.118:  -- uh, avocados, and, of course -- 

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  -- down south the, the orange groves -- 

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  -- and things like that, you know, the weather really does have a lot of
effect on so many things.

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  And, uh, when they grow those oranges down in the southlands, they have
these braziers out in the fields and --

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- and they go around putting fires on --

A.127:  Huh.

B.128:  -- if the temperatures gets down around thirty-two or thirty --

A.129:  Wow.

B.130:  -- and just levels off there so that they can regulate it by means of
those, like, man-made, not too difficult, uh, [lipsmack] uh, ways #to# --

A.131:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.132:  -- to save the crops.  

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  But we all know what happens if those crops freeze.  

A.135:  Right, right.  

B.136:  We pay for it [laughter].  

A.137:  [Laughter] That's right.  

B.138:  Yeah.  

A.139:  You know, and you usually don't think of that, uh -- 

B.140:  Yeah.  

A.141:  -- you know, being, I guess being in a urban area -- 

B.142:  Uh-huh.  

A.143:  -- if it gets cold, ((you know)) you, well, let's think about water
freezing --

B.144:  Right.  

A.145:  -- and pipes breaking.  

B.146:  Of course.

A.147:  But down there --  

B.148:  Uh-huh.  

A.149:  -- they have all those crops --

B.150:  #Oh.#

A.151:  -- #to worry# about.  

B.152:  Oh, yes, oh, it's, it's really, well, that happened here in Texas with the
grapefruits that year a couple of years ago.

A.153:  Yeah, yeah, I, I remember that.  

B.154:  And the grapefruit crop was very, uh, very scarce.  

A.155:  That's right.  

B.156:  Uh, so, uh, uh, you know --

A.157:  That's right.

B.158:  -- all of these major things the poor farmers,   

A.159:  Yeah.  

B.160:  But, uh, anyway, we'll just, uh, hope that, uh, we're not in for too many
big freezes now, but, I know one big one will come [laughter].

A.161:  [Laughter] It --

B.162:  It,

A.163:  -- always happens, huh.  

B.164:  It always does.  

A.165:  [Laughter]. 

B.166:  And, uh, I really don't mind those, uh, few, uh, snow flurries and, those
--

A.167:  Sure.  

B.168:  -- few days when there's -- 

A.169:  I'd say there's pretty, quite pre-,
