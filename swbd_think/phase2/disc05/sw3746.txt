============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, what kind of hobbies do you have Lori?

@B.2:  Uh, I guess, I, uh, I like to play golf.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And, uh, I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts
and crafts.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Where do you play golf in this area?

B.6:  Well, [inhaling] we live, uh, pretty close, 

A.7:  [Sneezing].

B.8:  to the Mesquite Golf Course.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  So, we will play either out there or at Firewheel.  That is usually where
we play, but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area.

A.11:  Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?

B.12:  Uh, both [laughter].

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  Not at the same time.

A.15:  I was going to say, that could be difficult [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] No, sometimes we ride and sometimes, uh, we, pull, we like to,
to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise.  #But# --

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  -- I find that when I ride in a cart, I play better and I think it is cause
I don't get as tired [laughter].

A.19:  I think that might be true.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you
to pull the cart on the path.

B.22:  I know, and that makes me so mad {louder}.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course,
but apparently they think differently [laughter].

A.25:  That is the reason, I don't play over there.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  I like the course, but I don't play over there because, you, they don't,
uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.

B.30:  Right.  Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since
we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh,
ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, yeah, a hundred dollars cause it is
half price what the normal green fees are.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  So that is [noise] why we [noise] you know play over there cause we have
got our card [laughter].

A.33:  Well, I guess I could use a card too.  I live, uh, very near, uh, very
close to the Firewheel Golf Course.

B.34:  Oh, do you?  So you live in Garland then.

A.35:  Yes, I live in northwest Garland.  Right up there near the golf course.

B.36:  Okay, well we are in south Garland, but yeah, next time you go, uh, you
know, check into it, they have, uh, it is just like, uh, a bus card and they
just punch it.  You know, it has got one through ten on it and every time you
go they just punch it for you.

A.37:  Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am
involved in Boy Scouts.

B.38:  Oh, okay.

A.39:  So, I have, uh, I have, #uh, I have children# --

B.40:  #You must have a, a son.#

A.41:  -- Boy Scout age.  I have two boys that are boy scout age, and, uh, so --

B.42:  Oh, okay.

A.43:  -- I am very active in Boy Scouts so I would have to say that camping and
hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  #But I# --

B.46:  #Oh# well that sounds like fun too [laughter].

A.47:  -- but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again
because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going
to be six to eight years before they go to college.

B.48:  Uh-huh.  Well, you need to, uh, teach them how to play and take them out on
the course with you [laughter].

A.49:  That's right.  Lessons are expensive though.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.  Well you can teach them [laughter].

A.51:  Well, they would probably never make it then because I don't think, uh, I
only took lessons for golf when I was in college.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Uh, as a course for P E you know [laughter] --  

B.54:  Right, Right.

A.55:  -- so I could graduate.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  But, uh, that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf
lessons and that was kind of a group --

B.58:  Uh-huh. 

A.59:  -- scenario --

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  -- and not individual.

B.62:  Right.

A.63:  I took one lesson one other time.  Besides that, uh, I just, uh, try to
make the club hit the ball.

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  Yeah, I know what you mean [laughter].

A.67:  I don't want to play strike out, you know.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  But I have fun doing it, some, uh, you know, I have some good shots and
some bad shots.

B.70:  Oh yeah.  It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.

A.71:  So you said you work, uh, in the gardens too.  Do you have, uh, a special
#flowers?#

B.72:  #Well# flower gardens.  I like to have, matter of fact this past weekend I
just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs.  So, those
ought to be coming up around spring time [laughter].

A.73:  My wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  And they have been, we thought even with all the cold weather weather we
have had they have been blooming just fine.

B.78:  Oh, they do great.  I put mine in probably in November.

A.79:  That is when she did, I think.

B.80:  Yeah, I think it was November and I don't do anything to mine, water them
or anything [laughter].  And they just, they do really good and I even had,
uh, I guess it was last year or the year before, I had some out and it froze
and the pansies looked terrible, but they came back later.  I didn't do
anything to them so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time.
They last for a long time then.  So, if you start putting them, you know, you
can put them out in the spring too, but once it starts getting real hot --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.

A.83:  Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time?  Will they
make it through the summer sun?

B.84:  No, they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot, but
they make it through probably winter and spring.  So, 

A.85:  Well.

B.86:  Yeah, I have got some of those too, cause I love flowers [laughter].

A.87:  Well, that is good.

B.88:  Yeah.  And I do, I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go,
