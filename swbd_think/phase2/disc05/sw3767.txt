=============================================================================

A.1:  Alright, Ms Kathy [noise].  So, uh, what do you do?  Do you do it
regularly and so forth?

B.2:  Uh, yeah.  I do.  I play basketball on, uh, a city league and, uh --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- volleyball and, uh, how about you?

A.5:  Well, uh, I have been so busy working.  I just retired about two weeks ago.

B.6:  Uh, congratulations.

A.7:  [Laughter] Thank you.  My exercise basically has been, uh, walking that I
could get in.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Which really hasn't been quite enough.  But I could very definitely tell
the difference when I have two or three hours off and I run around on campus,
I am retired from Penn State University --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and when I have an afternoon to walk around on campus, I, I, uh, very
definitely see a difference.

B.12:  Huh.

A.13:  And, it, I know that walking is good for you and, uh, I keep reading that
it is much better for you than running --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- because of the actions of the joint and so forth --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- but, uh, tell me about, uh, your exercise.  Did you take your exercise
because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or
whatever?

B.18:  Uh, I do it purely for enjoyment.  In fact when I started exercise programs
that I felt like I had to do --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- [Laughter] you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that, I
haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it, either one, so.  I decided that
I would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what I like more than just
individual, uh, whatever.

A.21:  How many, how many hours a week do you estimate you perform these things?

B.22:  Uh, probably at least an hour a day.

A.23:  An hour a day, uh-huh.

B.24:  Yeah I do and I have four children so that keeps me busy too and they are
all involved in sports, mostly soccer.  So we, once they are out there, you
know, I get out there --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and kick it around with them sometimes.

A.27:  Do you ever have a time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that
your weight goes up or anything like that?

B.28:  Of course [laughter].  Of course.

A.29:  Oh, it's, so, you can tell the difference.

B.30:  Oh, yeah.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and
you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise, so you don't and
then you [laughter], the vicious cycle where, where you don't exercise.

A.33:  I, I understand what you are saying.  Well, what about eating?  Do you, uh,
do anything about the the type of food you eat.  Is that, uh, or do you just
eat a normal balanced meal #to go with that?#

B.34:  #Yeah,# I just eat normally.  You know, I am not real regimented about what
--

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- what I eat personally.  It is too hard to get myself on a certain diet,
having to fix for five other people in the house so, 

A.37:  Yeah, that, that does keep you busy.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  So, #you# --

B.40:  #How about# you?

A.41:  -- well, uh, [laughter] well there are just two of us now.  My three
children have all moved out.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  So, uh, diet wise, I am trying to keep us on a low, uh, weight, a low fat
type of, uh, diet --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- my wife has high cholesterol.  So, I am trying to keep that down and I
do notice that when you go through periods such as Christmas and so forth
where you eat out more often than normal, if you don't get the exercise in,
your weight, weight goes up.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  And, uh, for me, exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing that weight
down.  And,

B.48:  Do you do it together with your wife, or is just mostly by yourself?

A.49:  No, it's up until now it has been mostly by myself because I would have
been downtown and as I say walking around on campus picking up mail and doing
things like that and running downtown, uh, during my lunch period --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in.

B.52:  Yeah, so you probably get a lot of walking in.  I know that when I went to
college and just walking --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- back and forth from different buildings you have to [laughter].

A.55:  We have a bicycle in the house.  Uh, the kind that you pump --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that
seems to be, uh, probably, other than walking, that is probably one of the
better things you can do.

B.58:  Huh.

A.59:  Have you ever tried one of those?

B.60:  I haven't.  I have, I do, I have a bike and --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and you know, I usually have a child on the back of it because mine are
little [laughter].

A.63:  Uh-huh.  I was thinking with, uh, didn't you say you have four children?

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  With four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go
play, you need to stay home, maybe one of these mechanical bicycles #that
would be# --

B.66:  #That would.#

A.67:  -- very helpful to you.

B.68:  Yeah, it sure would.  That would be a great idea.

A.69:  Well, very good.  Well, I wish I could get my weight down.  I need to get
out and get some exercise.  Uh [laughter], 

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  uh, as I say, I have just retired so I am just starting to have a few
days to, uh, approach that subject and I am considering it.  I am going to get
on that bicycle that we have.

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  And, uh, start doing some riding.

B.74:  Oh, that sounds,

A.75:  And I am sure that is going to be the quickest way to get things under
control.

@@B.76:  Yeah, probably.  Do your kids still live close by you?

A.77:  No, I have one that lives in Amsterdam, Holland --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- and, uh, one lives in, uh, near Warrington, Pennsylvania --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- and the other one is in New Jersey.

B.82:  Oh, they are spread around.  

A.83:  So,

B.84:  What did you teach?

A.85:  Well, I, I have done research --

B.86:  Oh.

A.87:  -- at Penn State.  I have uh, not teaching.  I have done research in under
water acoustics.

B.88:  Oh.  Well that,

A.89:  [Laughter]  A noisy subject.

B.90:  Yeah.  Well, that would be interesting.  Did you study like mammals,
