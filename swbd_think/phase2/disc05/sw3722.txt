===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, #uh,#

B.2:  #You# you know what the topic is?

A.3:  Music.

B.4:  Right.

@A.5:  What type do you like?

B.6:  I like pretty much rock, popular rock.

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  What kind do you like?

A.9:  Uh, I like rock, semi classical, soft jazz, not heavy rock.

B.10:  I can get into soft jazz, too.

A.11:  Yeah.  I don't like, uh, country particularly.

B.12:  No [laughter].

A.13:  Or rap, or um, what else?

B.14:  Country turns me off.  Uh, the, my girlfriend likes rap.  Uh.

A.15:  You're kidding ? #[laughter]#

B.16:  #[Laughter]# Definitely strange.  But, uh, I, I never got much.  I mean 
every so often there is like a song out --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- that just sounds funny when you listen to it.  They are probably the
only kind I like.  But, uh, rap, in general, like, I don't get into.

A.19:  So, who is your favorite artist right now?

B.20:  Oh, I, I actually have a couple of favorite artists.  I like guys like, you
know, Billy Joel, uh, who are singers, song writers, you know.

A.21:  Great.  He is one of my favorites.

B.22:  Yeah, he is. I love him.  I had his greatest hit, uh, and I had to, I
have it on tape, I have it on C D and I have it on record.

A.23:  [Laughter] What,

B.24:  [Laughter] My tape went bad, so I bought a record.  Then my record went
bad, so I bought a C D.

A.25:  What is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done?

B.26:  Probably, PIANO MAN.

A.27:  Really.

B.28:  Yeah, I, uh, maybe just because it is like, I think it is the first one on,
uh, the, C D.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  It is the first one on the tape too.  And I just listen to it a lot and I
just, I just love it.

A.31:  My very favorite is ITS STILL ROCK AND ROLL TO ME.

B.32:  That is a good one.  Did you ever see the video, uh, by Billy Joel?  Uh, it
is not that one, it is another one about, uh, he is in a courtroom, and he has,
you something like, KEEPING THE FAITH. That is the name of the song and in the
video, he, uh, is actually in court --

A.33:  Yes, I think so.

B.34:  -- and Christi Brinkley is in it.  That is another reason I like him,
because he is married to the girl I love #[laughter].#

A.35:  #[Laughter]# Well, then he has another video that she has been in, uh, he
is like, uh.  I think it is UPTOWN GIRL.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  And that is the first one that I have seen her in.  She is just so
gorgeous.

B.38:  I know #[laughter].#

A.39:  #[Laughter].#

B.40:  No.  Uh, KEEPING THE FAITH is great cause, uh, you see, you know, all of
the people in the courtroom --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and they have these girls dancing --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- [Laughter] on the railings on the sides and I just got a kick out of
it. It was really funny.

A.45:  Well, uh, the other one that he came out with, and I loved the video for it
too, uh, it was, I think, on his last C D, uh, WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE. 

B.46:  Uh, uh-huh.

A.47:  Uh, I just love that song.

B.48:  Yeah, he, he just has the ability, I mean, every so often he will just come
out with, uh, you know, a couple of the songs that are just great.

A.49:  Does he have anything new out?  Do you know?

B.50:  No.  I have not heard anything lately.  Uh, but then again I have not
bought any C D -s lately.  I had a C D player --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- and I just moved from Washington about two years ago and, uh, when I was
in Washington, in D C, I gave my C D player to my sister cause I was going
to buy another one.

A.53:  [Laughter] And you never bought another one.

B.54:  Well, I have one now.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  But, I just got it, about two months ago.  So, I just, uh, recently have
started going back into the C D market [laughter].

A.57:  Did you get one that loads more than one or #did you get a single?#

B.58:  #Yeah.#  I got the five disc carousel.

A.59:  That's what we have, and I will tell you, it is a lot nicer, #uh# --

B.60:  #Oh yeah.#

A.61:  -- because, you know, sometimes I get tired of listening to the same artist
over, you know, for the whole entire length of the C D --

B.62:  Oh yeah.

A.63:  --  and it is nice when you can randomly choose #them too.#

B.64:  #Yeah.#  That is what I really like and I bought a little single disc --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- for my car.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And, uh, that's great.  I mean, I, every since I put that thing in my car,
I haven't heard a tape since #[laughter] [wheezing].#

A.69:  #[Laughter]# Yeah.  I'd like to have one of those.  The next car I buy.
I don't know how expensive they are --

B.70:  But,

A.71:  -- when you are putting it in.

B.72:  I just, I just got a little portable one --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- and I bought a little, I bought a little, Sony makes a base unit --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- that you can just mount in your car --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars.

A.79:  Oh. That's great.

B.80:  Otherwise, if you buy, uh, them in a car now --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- it is like five hundred bucks for a whole unit.

A.83:  Oh.  That might be a little bit more than --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- my budget.

B.86:  Yeah.  That, that is a little extravagant, you know.  But if you can afford
the cars that it comes in, you know #[laughter].#

A.87:  #[Laughter].#

B.88:  It is not that bad.  But.

A.89:  Do you go to any concerts of anything?

B.90:  I have not been to any, uh, since I have been out of college.  Um, and, it
usually, the concerts that have come up lately --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- I have been out of town, uh, traveling --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- so I just haven't had the chance to go to any, you know, and I work
with a bunch of young people in the office.  They are always going to
concerts, but whenever they tell me there is one coming up, there is something
going on and I can never go.

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  So, right, now, I have not been to any [laughter].  I have been missing out
on life.

A.97:  Well, there is someone that I have just discovered like in the last couple
of years and have you ever heard of Yani?  

B.98:  Of who?

A.99:  Yani.

B.100:  Uh, I, uh, the name sounds familiar.

A.101:  He is a composer.  He's dating Linda Evans right now.  

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  And, he does, I have just heard when I, uh, first moved to Dallas about
five years ago, there was, uh, a station that played soft rock and light jazz
--

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  -- and I did not think I liked jazz at all until I started listening to
this station and Yani, is, I think he is kind of new wavish or something.

B.106:  I think that is where I saw Yani.  There was something about him
dating Linda Evans [laughter].

A.107:  That is probably right, exactly.  But his music is absolutely wonderful.

B.108:  Is it really?  

A.109:  And I've kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or
whatever it may be, and, uh, there is a lot of that that I like.
