REMARKS:        Background noise on A.  Sounded like someone was doing
some construction in the house - tapping, banging.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, okay, do you live in a single family dwelling as they call it?

B.2:  Yeah [laughter].  I, I am buying my own home.

A.3:  Okay.  What sort of house is it?

B.4:  Uh, well, it is a one story, three bedroom, [tapping] two bath, and two car
garage with a single living area.  A large single living area [/tapping].

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  Garage.  Is that an actual closed in garage or is carport type of thing?

B.8:  No.  It is a closed in garage, but attached to the house.

A.9:  Okay.

B.10:  So that I can leave my home, go into the garage, get into the car and not
get into #any weather at all.#

A.11:  #Never actually# be out of the house.  Yeah.  Now around here they tell you
if, if the advertisement for house for sale says garage, it could mean
anything from a, uh, part of the house all closed in, to a, uh, uh, nice
corrugated fiberglass roof hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere.

B.12:  Oh, you are kidding.

A.13:  No.

B.14:  #That is.#

A.15:  #And# most of them are carports.  You know, they will be attached to, to
the house --

B.16:  To the home, #uh-huh.#

A.17:  -- #but# it will just be an extension of roof, to, uh --

B.18:  Wow.

A.19:  -- over you know one or two parking spaces.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  Most of the time that I have, when I was looking for a house
matter of fact, that they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were,
uh, were a detached garage.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  So.

A.23:  Yeah, uh, you all are not quite getting all of that flooding that Texas has
been getting have you?

B.24:  Uh, yeah [laughter].

A.25:  You are getting part of that, uh.

B.26:  We are getting part of it, uh-huh. 

A.27:  Okay.

B.28:  It is, uh, it is really kind of odd.  We had, uh, hoped not to [noise] to
be in too much of it and matter of fact, matter of fact in Texas, in Texas,
they have flood plain areas.

A.29:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.30:  And about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies
wouldn't insure you for it.  Like, uh, like what is, I am trying to think of
the name of that park,

A.31:  So there are areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't
cover them?

B.32:  Yeah, they wouldn't, they wouldn't will not issue flood insurance [noise].

A.33:  Huh.

B.34:  And, and I can see where there are some areas in Dallas that are definitely
like that.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  But, uh.

A.37:  Come to think of it, it is that way around here too.  I mean, you know,
there is nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here.

B.38:  Uh, no, we have,  

A.39:  Which was real confusing when I first moved into this area.

B.40:  Was it?  What, uh, what kind of, uh, home are you in?

A.41:  Well, actually, right now my wife and I are living in campus housing.

B.42:  Oh, okay.  Is it, uh, apartment style?

A.43:  [Cough] Yeah.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  They are apartment buildings.  One and two and three bedroom places.  Uh,
we like, you know [sneezing].  Uh, excuse me.  Like, uh, twenty-five or thirty
units per building or something like that.

B.46:  Oh.  Okay.

A.47:  Twenty-five or thirty buildings.

B.48:  Gosh.

A.49:  About half of them are one bedroom places. 

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  There are a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there is
like, uh, fifteen or twenty three bedroom places.

B.52:  Three bedroom, uh-huh.

A.53:  But, uh, they are not really too bad.  They are basically cinder block
places.

B.54:  Well, uh, that is kind of what I had envisioned from, uh, visiting the ones
that, uh, at North Texas University, where my husband just graduated.

A.55:  Yeah.  Just graduated in, in what?

B.56:  Uh, physics.

A.57:  Physics.

B.58:  P H D in physics.

A.59:  Wow, sounds like fun.

B.60:  Oh yeah, yeah [laughter].

A.61:  I have got a couple of physics classes facing me this, this, summer, so.

B.62:  Actually, they are, they're very enlightening and they are a lot of fun.

A.63:  Yeah. 

B.64:  They are.

A.65:  And from what I have seen of it, I mean, you know there is a lot of things
that kind of dabble in the edges of physics [squeak].  Before you actually get
into the class.

B.66:  Well, most everything [barking] touches physics one way or another.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  No matter what you do.  Even if nobody tells you that is what it is.  It's
it's physics.

A.69:  Yeah, I remember a teacher in high school saying that, uh, he enjoys
physics because it, uh, improved his, his, uh, pool game.

B.70:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.

A.71:  But anyway.

B.72:  Mathematics too.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Uh, back to housing, what kind of a home would you and your wife look for,
uh --

A.75:  Uh, well.

B.76:  -- once you get finish schooling?

A.77:  Once we get out of school, we are hoping to get into the mountains.

B.78:  Oh really?

A.79:  Somewhere.  Probably, out West.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Uh.

B.82:  Oregon or Washington?

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  More than likely.  The rainy side and the mountains somewhere. 

B.86:  Oh that is a beautiful area.

A.87:  But, uh, uh, originally I am from West Virginia, the Appalachian Mountains.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  So, uh, uh, long since fell in love with living in the mountains.

B.90:  Oh, I see.

A.91:  But, it would probably be like a two story, possibly even a three story.
If we build our own, we might even get a little crazy and, you know, build
into the side of a hill.

B.92:  That would,
