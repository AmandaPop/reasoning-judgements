============================================================================

A.1:  So, what do you think about the, uh, income taxes?  

@B.2:  Well, I could do with a lot less than that.  

A.3:  Where do you live?  

B.4:  I live in Dallas.  

A.5:  Okay, I live in Dallas, too.  

B.6:  Oh, good.  Well, I live in Plano in that case.  

A.7:  [Throat_clearing] Okay I live,  

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  in, uh, in the Village.  Do you know where that is?  

B.10:  Oh, yeah, I do, yeah.  

A.11:  Yeah, well, one thing I can tell you I hate about the taxes in Dallas is
the eight and a quarter percent sales tax.

B.12:  Yes.  

A.13:  It, I think it's like the highest in the U S because my sister lived in
New York and it was only seven percent there.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  Washington, D C was only six percent and where I moved from, Virginia,
was only four and a half percent and I can tell you we were upset when it went
to four and a half.

B.16:  I know.  

A.17:  It was only four percent.  

B.18:  And you know, we had no sales tax here about, oh, I don't know, maybe ten
years ago.

A.19:  Really?  

B.20:  We had none at all and that's how it started with, uh, four percent, five
percent --

A.21:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- and all of a sudden here we are now.  

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  And -- 

A.25:  Well it,   

B.26:  -- it's horrible.  

A.27:  Since there's no, uh, state tax, I assume that that's why it went up fast
--

B.28:  Well,   

A.29:  -- because Virginia does have a state tax.  

B.30:  It's true, but they did without it all those years.  

A.31:  Uh-huh, huh.  

B.32:  And they keep talking about the state tax.  

A.33:  Yeah it,   

B.34:  And they'll probably put one in and they'll have this, too, so, 

A.35:  If they put state tax in, I'll be pretty upset.

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  Because, I mean, part of the reason, part of the incentives of moving to
Texas from Virginia --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about
sixty dollars to your paycheck, uh, every two weeks --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- and, uh, [throat_clearing] if that comes back in, I'll be pretty mad
because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually, you know.

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  So, uh, I don't know, I'm not very much for a -- 

B.44:  Well -- 

A.45:  -- state tax.  

B.46:  -- I hope it doesn't, but, you know how it goes so,   

A.47:  Yeah, they keep talking about, uh, you know, the light real systematic
taxes --

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- and then, uh, there was another issue that came up, I forget, uh, the
horse racing.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51: They're putting up the, the racing fees.  They said they may raise taxes
because of that.

B.52:  Raise them?  

A.53:  Yeah, they said, uh, to build the, okay, apparently, they said the builders
would provide thirty million dollars in funds, and the state would need to
provide sixty-five million dollars in funds.

B.54:  Oh. 

A.55:  Well, in order to get the sixty-five million dollars it would cause an
increase in taxes.  But it seems like it would pay itself off.

B.56:  Oh, it will.  

A.57:  So, you know [laughter] what's the purpose of the increasing the sales
tax, you know.

B.58:  Probably the first season.

A.59:  Yeah so, you know,   

B.60:  It's a bit funny about things like that here.

A.61:  Yeah, things like that, you know,   

B.62:  They really are.  When I came here, you couldn't buy beer --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- couldn't buy a drink [laughter].  Nothing was open on Sunday, not even a
grocery store.

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  I mean nothing, nothing, you know.

A.67:  No, huh.  

B.68:  So it was a lot worse, and as more people come in, it does get better, but
they still have some real funny laws.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  I mean, you know, federal tax, I mean, everybody has to pay
standard around the U S and --

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  -- that doesn't bother me that much, you know, the, you buy a house, you
cut your taxes a little bit --

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- the rest of it you pay what you owe, but, uh, [throat_clearing] like
sales tax and, I, where I lived in, uh, in Virginia they had personal property
tax --

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  -- in the counties and that was a lot.  My parents paid almost four
thousand dollars a year --

B.76:  Oh -- 

A.77:  -- in personal --

B.78:  -- that -- 

A.79:  -- property tax -- 

B.80:  -- is.  

A.81:  -- on the house.  They paid almost a thousand dollars on, uh, on two of our
cars, and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars.

B.82:  Oh. 

A.83:  But the personal property tax itself used to add up, you know, just, I
mean, itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year.

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  And that's a lot of money, you know.  Most places go ahead --

B.86:  It is.  

A.87:  -- and just, you know, put it into your mortgage payment so you don't
forget about it at the last minute --

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  -- you know, and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year.
But that gets real expensive.

B.90:  Oh, yeah, that is.  

A.91:  Do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all, do you know?

B.92:  Uh, uh, they, well, they do a little bit, but, uh, it's, it's like next to
nothing.

A.93:  Um.  

B.94:  I've seen it, it's on my, when you pay your registration -- 

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- stuff like that, there's a little place.  

A.97:  Well, you know, like every year, they renew the registration here --

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- only like fifty or sixty bucks so,    

B.100:  It costs what?  

A.101:  It's only like fifty or sixty bucks to -- 

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  -- renew your registration here.  

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  But in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your pri-,
personal property tax.

B.106:  Huh.  

A.107:  And I had a, I, I paid, you know, twelve hundred dollars a year [laughter]
for my last car --

B.108:  Really?  

A.109:  -- for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief I guess.

B.110:  God.  

A.111:  That's not too bad, but other than that everything worked out. 

B.112:  Yeah, so you haven't been here very long?  

A.113:  What's that?  

B.114:  You haven't been here very long.  

A.115:  I've been here about two years now.  

B.116:  Two years.  

A.117:  But, uh, in the two years I've, I've been here, I've been through, I've had
two cars --

B.118:  Uh-huh.  

A.119:  -- so I've never really, like, you know, I don't know if they, if they ever
will assess a personal, uh, any kind of tax --

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  -- on the car other than what I paid when I, uh, registered the car.

B.122:  Yeah.  

@@A.123:  So that's the only thing I can really think of, so.  So, do you work for
T I or you just doing this?

B.124:  No, I don't, I'm a nurse.  I work down at Presbyterian.  

A.125:  Okay, uh, someone just mentioned this program to me so I thought it would
be kind of cool.

B.126:  Yeah, oh, it is, you know, they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls.

A.127:  Oh, do they really?  

B.128:  At least that's what I heard that you could get to do ten calls.

A.129:  Yeah, I, I don't know how the thing works.  

B.130:  And -- 

A.131:  Uh,   

B.132:  -- this is like the seventeenth.  

A.133:  Oh, really [laughter]?  

B.134:  Yeah, so it's great.
