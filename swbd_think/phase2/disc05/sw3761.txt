===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I subscribe to a few magazines on a regular basis, how about you?

@B.2:  Oh, yes I do.  Uh, I, uh, always enter those things that come through the
mail  [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter]  Oh really?

B.4:  Yeah  [laughter].

A.5:  They like you [laughter].

B.6:  Yeah, they do.  So I have about everything.

A.7:  Really.

B.8:  At some time or other.

A.9:  How many, how many, uh, would you say at any given time you tend to
subscribe to?

B.10:  Oh, probably no more than say five at the time.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  What are your favorites?

B.12:  Well, I like, uh, MCCALLS --

A.13:  We subscribe to that one now too.

B.14:  -- uh-huh, READER'S DIGEST, REDBOOK, uh, lets see, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- uh,

A.19:  Do you like that one?

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  I had, I had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a
nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things,
but, uh, it's really a collection of everything.  It has got a lot of, uh, home
making kinds of things too, you know, food as well as indoor and outdoor
stuff.

B.22:  Uh-huh. Yeah, I, I love to get recipes, you know, out of the magazine.  I
cut them out --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- put them in a book.

A.25:  Yeah, uh-huh [laughter].  Me too.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  I am not sure that I use them as often as I think that I will, but I sure,
uh, pay attention to them --

B.28:  Oh yeah.

A.29:  -- and cut them out [laughter]. 

B.30:  I also, uh, usually get a magazine about travel and, uh,  

A.31:  Do you use the tips and suggestions?  Do do you travel often enough that
you are able to, to [noise] take advantage of it?

B.32:  Not really.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Uh, uh, I, #I read them and, uh# --

A.35:  #Just fun and sort of,#

B.36:  -- you know get ideas --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- but, uh, I don't travel that much.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.40:  So but,  

A.41:  The thing I like about magazines, is that they are a wonderful diversion
for a brief period of time.  If you feel like you are not in the mood [noise]
to really sit down with a book for a long time, it's the perfect short, uh,
attention getter.

B.42:  Yes, it really is.  Yeah, and oh, uh, I like the, uh, beauty tips and you
know, all that fashion stuff.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Do you do you have favorite fashion oriented magazines?

B.44:  No, not really.  I, I just read them.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  In some of the magazines that I get.  I don't really take a fashion
#magazine or anything.#

A.47:  #Oh, uh-huh.#  None that are specifically focused on fashion.

B.48:  Oh, no. 

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Uh, just what is in the regular magazines.  But, uh,  

A.51:  I have a friend who works for a magazine that is based in France called
ELLE and, and I remember seeing it enough times at her house that, it's I
wonder how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines cause you almost
have to be in the business to be intrigued with some of those fashions.  They
are so #bizarre.#

B.52:  #Yeah.# That's true  [laughter].

A.53:  [Laughter] We all have to change our wardrobe regularly enough to --

B.54:  #Right. That's right.  You hear,#   

A.55:  -- #invest in the magazine.#

B.56:  [Laughter] You know, I keep entering these contests, taking all of these
magazines, thinking I will win that big --

A.57:  Publisher's Clearing House [laughter].  

B.58:  -- yeah, alright [laughter].  Oh, and there are several others that I get
through the mail and, uh, you know, they have contests like that.  Not as big
as that one, but, anyway, I am really some kind of a sucker I guess for
magazines [laughter].

A.59:  [Laughter] Well that's, that's sort of another added attraction of those
contests, I guess you could probably enter the contests without getting the
magazines, but --

B.60:  Yeah, you can.

A.61:  -- it's not as much fun.

B.62:  Yeah, that is true.  Uh, REDBOOK.  I have always taken REDBOOK.  For years
and years and years.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  They use to have a novel in the back.

A.65:  Oh, really.

B.66:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, but they quit doing that and I sure miss it.

A.67:  Huh.  I don't know REDBOOK very well.  What, what did it tend to be a mix
of, uh, fashion and, and recipes and that sort of thing or what did [clink],

B.68:  Yeah, it's similar to like MCCALLS --

A.69:  Oh is it?  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- or something like that, yeah.  Yeah, not that much different.

A.71:  Tend to focus more on women's issues than, 

B.72:  Yes.  Definitely.  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Uh-huh. 

B.74:  But they have some good short stories too.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.76:  And, uh, but I really miss that novel.  It use to make, uh, take me, oh,
say a Sunday afternoon, you know, I would crawl up on the couch with my
REDBOOK --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- and read the novel [laughter].

A.79:  That is interesting.  I always thought that, that was a big enough
attraction in a lot of magazines that they, I am surprised that they would get
rid of it.

B.80:  Yeah, I don't know why they did.  I never did hear anything at all about
it.  All of a sudden it was just gone.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  MCCALLS certainly has changed a lot of over the years.

B.82:  Yeah.  They use to be a big magazine and, you know, they cut the size down
--

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- and all but, uh,

A.85:  I use to get one called SAVVY that went out of business or merged or
something and since I had only half the subscription through, they
automatically switched all their readers, instead of SAVVY, MCCALLS and that
is how I got introduced to it.

B.86:  Oh, is that right?

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  [Throat_clearing] Well, uh, I can remember, uh, yeah, seeing SAVVY.  I
don't know that I ever subscribed to it, but I have seen it,

A.89:  I liked it.  I thought it was kind of a nice,
