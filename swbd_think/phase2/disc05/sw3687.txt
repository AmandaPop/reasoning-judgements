=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what, uh, guess I should have talked before.  

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

@A.3:  Uh, what team do you want to, are you familiar with, I guess? 

B.4:  Uh,

A.5:  Or do you have a favorite team, I guess?  

B.6:  Yeah, my favorite team's probably the Reds.  

A.7:  Is it?  

B.8:  Yeah, I'm from Cincinnati.  

A.9:  Are you really?  

B.10:  Yeah.  
 
A.11:  Great.  

B.12:  Yeah, but, uh,  

A.13:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.14:  most national leagues teams I'm pretty familiar with.  

A.15:  Yeah, I, uh, I, I'm familiar with the Reds myself.  We lived out there in
Dayton for three years, so --

B.16:  Oh, really?  

A.17:  -- we used to root from the line, I don't know, they got a pretty good
team, but, I, I kind of think the Braves are the, going ones, be the ones that
go places this year.

B.18:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Even last year I thought they'd be doing
pretty good.

A.19:  Yeah, they're pretty, they're so young and everything, I, they're just
starting to get, Dave Justice is one of my favorite players so, 

B.20:  Yeah, he's pretty exciting to watch.  

A.21:  I'm hoping he can pull them through and maybe have a good series like they
did against the Twins again.

B.22:  Yeah, I think those Dodgers you got to look out for with all the, the
hitting they've got right,

A.23:  Oh, yeah, and who else did they pick up?  They got Strawberry and, who else
did they,

B.24:  They got Davis from the Reds.  

A.25:  Davis, too?  

B.26:  Yeah, and, uh, they traded away for some pitcher, too.  

A.27:  Oh, yeah?  

B.28:  Yeah, because they dumped Belcher and they got someone else.  I forgot his
name, though.

A.29:  Huh.  Yeah, I've, I've kind of, I, they always make me nervous because,
Lasorda's a good coach and everything, but, uh, they got the bucks to spend.
They can get all those guys.

B.30:  Yeah, it seems like they always get the, the high paid guys and they always
seem to end up doing pretty good for a while.

A.31:  Yeah, yeah.  I, uh, I'm kind of a Mets fan myself, too.  I, uh, like to see
them go.  I don't know why, but, because they're, 

B.32:  Well, they just signed, uh, what, Bonilla -- 

A.33:  Bonilla.

B.34:  -- from Pittsburgh, yeah.  

A.35:  I know, I, see, that's from being from Pennsylvania I thought you'd maybe
be a Pittsburgh fan but,

B.36:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.37:  But, no, huh.  

B.38:  No.  

A.39:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.40:  I keep up on it.  

A.41:  Do you?  

B.42:  Yeah, I tell you though, he's getting what, six million a year or
something?

A.43:  Yeah, y-, c-, it's kind of hard to turn that down, that's for sure.

B.44:  Yeah, you got to think Bonds is worth more than that, too.  

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  [Laughter]. 

A.47:  Yeah, definitely.  I wonder if he, is he going to stay with them or,

B.48:  No, he's looking to leave from what I hear.  

A.49:  Oh, if he leaves, then they're, they're done with.  They won't go anywhere
this year.  I mean, that's their two biggest guys that,

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Or Walken so,

B.52:  They signed a couple of their pitchers who are going to be free agents.

A.53:  Y-, they resigned them?  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  Well, that's good, that will help but,

B.56:  Yeah, they got Walken, someone else they resigned.  

A.57:  Well, I wouldn't be surprised to see them if they go after Bonds but,

B.58:  They're not going to give them more than six million a year.  They can't
afford it.

A.59:  Well, I don't think anybody can.  I don't know if anybody's worth that
much.

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  For what they do, but, uh, I don't know, I really, like I say, I really
hope the Braves can pull it through.  They're, I think they caught everybody's
imagination last year.  It was a, it was great series, but that would #have
been fun to see them win it.#

B.62:  #Yeah, you got to like the# underdog.

A.63:  Yeah, that's true.  Maybe they can pull it off again, but I tell you, I
don't know, it's, so are you a big baseball fan or,

B.64:  Yeah, pretty much.  

A.65:  Do you?  

B.66:  Yeah, up where we are, we don't get much baseball news, but, uh, I try to
keep up on it.

A.67:  Oh, do you?  Just through the s-, papers or whatnot?  

B.68:  Yeah, reading the little transactions column is about all we get.

A.69:  Oh, huh.  Well, what do you think about the A's and Canseco and those guys?
Have they got any chance or,

B.70:  I don't know, they really surprised me last year and they dropped off so
quick.

A.71:  Yeah, I'm wondering if they're maybe just getting a little too high paid
and --

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- #thinking they're so# -- 

B.74:  #Too many attitudes# -- 

A.75:  -- good and,

B.76:  -- out there.  

A.77:  Pardon?   

B.78:  Too many attitudes out there, I think.  

A.79:  Yeah, that's true [laughter].  That's definitely true.  

B.80:  They got a lot of high paid players that could start somewhere else as a
backup.

A.81:  Yeah, that's true.  Got to get Canseco's mind off Madonna and then he might
be able to play a little bit.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  Or Steve Pickett's. 

A.85:  Yeah, exactly.  

B.86:  Yeah, but they were in the World Series so many years straight and then
they were like third or fourth --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- or something.  

A.89:  Then they, that's like they dropped off the map and they had all the same
players but,

B.90:  Yeah, the Reds did the same thing.  

A.91:  Yep.  

B.92:  Players, then down into fifth.  

A.93:  Oh, yeah, that's surprised me because they were so tough, and then I just,
I just wonder, like I say, if they lose the desire, they did it once and then
they just forget it and,

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  I don't know, but, uh,

B.96:  You figured after all the Rose stuff was over -- 

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- everything would be fine and it was, but then I don't know what happened
last year.

A.99:  Yeah, they just, like I say, they tailed right off, but, and I heard Davis
was hurt quite a bit, so that kind of --

B.100:  Yeah but -- 

A.101:  -- hurt them.  

B.102:  -- he always is.  I mean, that's why they got rid of him.  

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  He only -- 

A.105:  That's true.  

B.106:  -- plays like half a season.  

A.107:  Yeah, it will be interesting to see what he does now that he's out there
with his bud Strawberry and, if all of a sudden he becomes healthy all the
time.

B.108:  Yeah, he kept on saying that, uh, the Reds should switch to natural grass
just for his knees.

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  But, uh, they never did.  But they got that out in L A.  That should help
him.

A.111:  Yeah, it will help.  But, yeah, we used to, I was back there with the Reds
when Ray Knight used to play and when --

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  -- he,

B.114:  Third base.  

A.115:  Yeah, when he took, well, it was the year that he took Pete Rose's place
and, of course, he couldn't do anything right and, but, uh, we used to go, I
used to get free tickets for, from school and go out and watch them.  But, uh,

B.116:  Yeah.  

A.117:  So, they always kind of were, kind of a good, my dad still loves them.
That's his favorite team but,

B.118:  Yeah, I can remember going to games there when I was a kid [laughter].

A.119:  Yeah, that was good fun.  If I, the stadium's what was amazing to me.  I
mean, we've got nothing that big out here as far as a, you know, baseball or
football stadium, you know, walk inside and it was just huge to, to see them,
but, uh, it seemed like it was always bigger on the inside than it was
outside.

B.120:  Yeah, because it looks small on the outside.  

A.121:  Yeah.  I had all these hu-, I alw-, we always were up in the nose bleed
seats, so we never got a chance to get too close but,

B.122:  Yeah, anytime you try to walk down, the, the ushers are always ((taking you
back)).  

A.123:  [Laughter] Yeah, I did that, I tried that a few times.  

B.124:  [Laughter]. 

A.125:  Can I see your tickets and then you just get up and leave because you know
there's no other, 

B.126:  Yeah, or, uh, oh, I left them up in my seat.  

A.127:  Yeah [laughter], yep, but, uh, uh, I don't know.  Yeah, I like, I enjoy
baseball.  I play a lot of softball.
