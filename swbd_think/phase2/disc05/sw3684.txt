===========================================================================

A.1:  So what kind of dining out do you enjoy?

B.2:  Well, we usually do things that have to do with families because I have a
family of four so,

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Four children or,   

B.4:  Four children, yeah.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Six of us altogether so,

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  When we go out it's usually someplace that caters to children [laughter].

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  More so than adults.  

A.11:  So, that has a children's menu or,

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  How about you?  

A.15:  Uh, well, I don't have any children.  Uh, and I'm a newlywed, so right now
I guess my favorite type of restaurant is, is a place that's fairly quiet and
has a pleasant atmosphere.  I sort of like the, either an old country look or
s-, uh, dim lights or something, just, you know,

B.16:  Have you found one in Dallas that you like?  

A.17:  Uh, well, I enjoy Steak and Ale.   

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  Yeah, that's, that seems to have a pretty nice atmosphere, usually, not, I
don't like noise.  I just --

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- hate it when restaurants are like Bennigan's. 

B.22:  They just opened up an Olive Garden here in -- 

A.23:  That's the other -- 

B.24:  -- Plano.  

A.25:  -- one that I really like.  

B.26:  Do you like it there?  

A.27:  Yeah, I haven't, in Plano I haven't, uh, oh, yeah.  

B.28:  I'm sure they're probably the same.  

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  All over.  

A.31:  Yeah, I've been to one here in Dallas.  

B.32:  I've heard that their bread sticks are terrific [laughter].  

A.33:  Yeah, they are, they really are.  

B.34:  Huh.  

A.35:  I've only been there once, uh, b-, almost a year ago and I want to go back.
I've thought about it ever since.  It's not --

B.36:  Yeah, we've been meaning to try this one out here.  

A.37:  -- on our side of town.  Yeah.

B.38:  Do you guys like, what kind of food do you like?  

A.39:  Uh, well, my husband loves anything beef, so -- 

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- he likes steak or ribs or something, but I kind of like more variety.

B.42:  Me, too.  

A.43:  I like to #be able to,#  

B.44:  #When I go# out, I like to have things that I don't cook at home.

A.45:  #Yeah, exactly.#  

B.46:  #And then when# just he and I go out, then it's -- 

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- it's almost always fish or something that I don't want to do at home
[laughter].

A.49:  Yeah, yeah, I like to have a choice of fish or chicken and Italian food,
Mexican food.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  You know, something, uh, yeah, something that I wouldn't, that takes more
time to cook at home.

B.52:  Yeah.  What, uh, what makes you go back there?  

A.53:  Uh, I'd say, well, one thing is the price.  I -- 

B.54:  Yeah -- 

A.55:  -- don't think it,   

B.56:  -- I was going to say, price is probably my biggest concern [laughter].

A.57:  Yeah, yeah, if it's overpriced, or, you know, I mean, if it's, I like to
still be able to get a meal for, well, I'd prefer five dollars [laughter] or
less, but --

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- that's unusual these days if you go out.  

B.60:  It seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap.  

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  Have you ever tried that, just going for -- 

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  -- lunch and then,   

A.65:  Yeah, we like, uh, Tony Roma's, it's a rib place.  

B.66:  Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Well,   

B.68:  Where is it?  

A.69:  Uh, let's see, there's, there's one up at, uh, see, what is it, just as,
uh, loop twelve turns into thirty-five, it --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- merges.  It's right there, it's sort of a restaurant row --

B.72:  Yeah.   

A.73:  -- in Dallas there.  And then there's also one down at the Marketplace,
West End Marketplace and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about
half as much as dinner is and you get ab-, --

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  -- almost the same amount.  

B.76:  In almost any restaurant -- 

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  -- that's almost the case.  

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  That we've seen.

A.81:  So I'd say that's the first thing I look for is price and then atmosphere.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  Yeah, how about you?  

B.84:  Probably price would be first [breathing], uh, we're not, you know, it
seems like we're always r-, rushing around doing something, so location, that
would have a lot to do with it, too.  I mean --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- we don't really travel to Mesquite or, you know -- 

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- somewhere that takes half an hour to get there so,   

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  We've, you know, tried most of the places around here and that's kind of
where we stay.

A.91:  Yeah.  So, so what would your favorite place be, or one of your favorites?

B.92:  [Breathing] Oh, gee.  

A.93:  Or some of your favorite.  

B.94:  Have you tried, uh, Louisiana Purchase?  They have any of those over there?

A.95:  No, I've never heard of that.  

B.96:  Those are good, and it's kind of Cajun.  I usually don't like spicy food,
but that's real good, especially lunch, you know, c-, --

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- for the same reason, because it's got some atmosphere -- 

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  -- and yet the price is, is good.  My husband really likes Chinese food, so
we go Chinese, just a little mom and pop kind of places --

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- more so than the bigger.  

A.103:  Yeah, I like Chinese, too.  Yeah, sometimes you can, uh, you can often get
that at a good price.

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  And some of them have good atmosphere, too.  

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  So,

B.108:  Chinese places doesn't seem like they really cater to atmosphere
[laughter].

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  The ones around here anyways.  Just -- 

A.111:  Yeah, some of them don't.  

B.112:  -- just authentic, that's all it, you know, it says authentic on the
outside.

A.113:  Yeah, yeah, so, do you like places that are noisy?  

B.114:  No -- 

A.115:  #That are lively.#  

B.116:  -- #not necessarily.#  

A.117:  Yeah.  

B.118:  Uh, when I go out with my husband, I just want to be able to, to talk to
him so that doesn't lend itself to that and when I'm with my children, the
more noise there is, the more nose, noise they think they can make [laughter].

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  So it doesn't, it tends to make them --

A.121:  Right.  

B.122:  -- wilder so,

A.123:  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  

B.124:  I really like the Black-Eyed Pea, but I also think that's real noisy.  Have
you ever been to a --

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- Black-Eyed Pea?  

A.127:  Yeah, I have.  

B.128:  It's got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging and, I love the
food, but it is really noisy.

A.129:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I found, too.  So, well, do you have anything else
you wanted to say [laughter]?

B.130:  Uh, no, I think that's pretty much what makes me go back.
