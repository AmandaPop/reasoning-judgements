REMARKS:        Sounds like Speaker A is in a large, echoing building
with many people moving around (for example, maybe like a train
station).

=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what's the last home improvement you did?

@B.2:  Oh, gosh, I'm trying to think.  Well, I guess ours have mostly been down
at our lake house.  We built a, built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- so, I guess I'd have to say that, because we kind of let this house go
[laughter].

A.5:  Oh.

B.6:  So, we had a shell built, and then we did everything else.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So it was quite a bit of work.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  What have you done?

A.11:  Well, I repaired the back fence.  It's a, well, of course, they get old,
you know, after about ten years anyway, but, uh.

B.12:  Oh, ye-, ours is nineteen years old [laughter].

A.13:  Well, the, the, the alley's on a kind of a slant --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and it makes all the fences tilt, or, or slowly, you know.

B.16:  Oh, do you have to have like a retaining wall or,

A.17:  Yeah, somewhat, right.

B.18:  Yeah, that makes them more difficult.  We, we've just, my husband has just,
um, repai-, repaired ours a lot.  It really needs to be replaced, but we
haven't done it.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  But, uh, anyway, well, have you done anything else?

A.21:  Um, had to replace the, the ridge row, the shingles on the corners of the,
the roof --

B.22:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.23:  -- from all the storms and everything.  

B.24:  Yeah --

A.25:  And, uh,

B.26:  -- yeah, you know, I'm wondering myself now why I checked this one,
[laughter] because my husband is who does all the things like what you're
talking about [laughter].

A.27:  Right, yeah.

B.28:  I haven't done those things, and of course, you know, inside stuff, but,
uh, now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in walls and,
you know, do the painting and the, uh, cut and make the, like the, uh, window
sills and things around the door and all that kind of stuff --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- you know, so we, we did quite a bit, uh, down there that I had never
done.  Oh, we haven't done that much in our own house.

A.31:  Weather proofing and,

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Yeah.  Uh, we do ha-, still have a problem down there.  We built us a two
story house, and the bottom story, uh, oh, it's more like walk out basement --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and it was built with these blocks, you know, these old gray blocks, I
think they're called Hadite blocks --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- and, uh, we found out with some, as much rain as we've had the past
year, it seeps through those [laughter] blocks and comes into the downstairs.

A.39:  (( )).

B.40:  And, uh, so now we have bought some, uh, uh, water proofing paint --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and that's our next project, the next time we go down there, we've got
to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then
hope that maybe that will do it.  But what they should have done, I think, is
they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before
they put the dirt back, you know, when it was built --

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  -- and, uh, they didn't do that, didn't think they'd need to [laughter].

A.45:  And then it's that, it's that white paint, I've forgotten what it's called,
Ti-bond or something like that, and those bricks are very porous --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- and it soaks into those bricks really well, and it seals all the water
out.

B.48:  Oh, have you ever used that anywhere?

A.49:  Just a little bit.

B.50:  Now people up north that have basements, I think.

A.51:  Yeah, they use it all the time.

B.52:  You, and do you know if it's, if they've had good luck with it?

A.53:  Yeah, it seals the water out.

B.54:  We had a hard time even finding it down here.  In fact --

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  -- you know, you go in a store and they say, Oh, well, that, we don't have
anything like that, you know.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And then finally found some, one, somewhere that was familiar with it,
probably lived in the north.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  And --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- well, that's encouraging then, because I haven't known that many, you
know, there's just not many basements down here.

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  Are you from around here?

A.65:  Yeah, I'm from Dallas.

B.66:  Oh, okay, well.  

A.67:  (( )).

B.68:  We're from, you know, Texas too --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- so, uh, but I, we have a partner in this deal, and he's from the north,
so he was the one that, and it gave us a lot more space, you know, it gave us
double the space.

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  And toward the lake it looks like a two story house, you know --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- because it gradually.  The back, it looks like a one story house, you
know.

A.75:  And it's set into the earth, so.

B.76:  Uh-huh, built kind of into a hill --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- a little hill, you know.  That was a good idea to give us a lot more
space for the money.

A.79:  Right, uh-huh.

B.80:  We just, uh, hadn't solved our [laughter] water problem yet.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  (( )).
