A.1:  So how is your lawn and garden work?  

@B.2:  Well today,  

A.3:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.4:  it's, uh, [laughter],  

A.5:  [Laughter]. 

B.6:  we're not doing much with it because it's kind of raining outside but --

A.7:  Yeah, I understand that.  

B.8:  -- or snowing actually.  

A.9:  It actually is snowing.  Cold and wet.  

B.10:  But, uh, actually my husband is in the other room, uh, planning a, uh,
organic garden, or, organic treatment, uh, 

A.11:  Oh, is he?  #Okay.#  

B.12:  #Yeah.#  Do you do a lot of lawn work?

A.13:  Not so much anymore.  I'm, I'm getting older, I'm fifty-two now, so I've
just, uh, I've sort of slowed down, you know, we use this, rather than do it
ourselves as far as fertilizing, we utilize a service and I guess they do a,
an okay type of job.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  [Throat_clearing] But, uh, I've let this little kid that lives behind us
cut our grass just a little bit this past year.  I think I'm going to let him
do it all this year just, I work, uh, I'm out of town quite a bit and I come
home and seems like every Friday that's what I have to face on Saturday is
doing my lawn, so I just stopped doing that [laughter].

B.16:  Well, there was a time when my [throat_clearing] husband had, had traveled
a lot, and, uh, so we had a service for the first year that we were in our
house --

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  -- and the lawn looked great [screeching].  Uh, now that, that he's
[laughter] home, we don't, uh, we haven't been treating it as well, you know,
using fertilizer and stuff or, I guess the lawn looks okay, it's just that we
don't, we still have a problem with weeds.

A.19:  Oh, I understand.  

B.20:  And,   

A.21:  Yeah, yeah we have a problem about every other year with weeds.  It, it
appear that every other year, a service can get rid of them and, uh, but
just about every other year, they come back [laughter].

B.22:  I think maybe they, uh, spread some [laughter],  

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  from cutting it down.  

A.25:  It's a constant battle, I tell you.

B.26:  But the thing that he is wanting to try this year is, uh, using some
organic treatments and we're not real naturalists or anything, but --

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  -- uh, what we have heard,  

A.29:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.30:  is that the [throat_clearing] amount of fertilizer that we put on our lawns
is about the same amount that a farmer would put on a whole entire crop.

A.31:  [Laughter] I understand.  

B.32:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] I have a cold, so [laughter] -- 

A.33:  I do, too -- 

B.34:  -- I'm having a hard time.  

A.35:  -- so I'm, I have the same problem.  

B.36:  Uh, but, uh, uh, so he wants to try doing some, you know, different kind of
stuff.  I don't really know what it involves, or --

A.37:  Right.  

B.38:  -- uh, at this point in time.  I enjoyed having the service when we did.
Uh, the only problem was, they never told us when they were coming, and then
you find a note on your door that says --

A.39:  Right.  

B.40:  -- water within [laughter] two, three days and -- 

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  -- it was never, uh,   

A.43:  With a thirty-five dollar bill [laughter].  

B.44:  Right, right.  But, uh,

A.45:  W-, well, we didn't use one year before last, a service because we, uh, we
had weeds like two years in a row and, you know, when you have a service, you
don't expect that, so we stopped and I sort of did it myself year before last.
Then this last summer I'd went back to a service and then went, but went to a
new service and they appear to be doing a better job.

B.46:  What service did you use?  

A.47:  Lawn Doctor.  

B.48:  Lawn Doctor.  

A.49:  And we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one that's more local.

B.50:  Um.  

A.51:  One of our friends bought the one in Plano.  They just didn't, uh, didn't
do that good a job on our lawn, so we changed services.

B.52:  Yeah, we tried using ChemLawn, but, uh, our problem is our front yard is
completely different from the backyard --

A.53:  Right.  

B.54:  -- and, uh, I think they just use the same stuff on everything [laughter].

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  Because we've got a mixture, our front yard is, uh, all Bermuda, what's not
weeds [laughter].

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  And the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine, Bermuda and some type of,
uh, winter grass that stays green all, all winter.

A.59:  Right, either rye or something.  

B.60:  Yeah, something like that.  It's real clumpy and,   

A.61:  Yeah, because see, I have, we have a lot of trees in our yard, so it's,
it's, you know, during the summer it's bare under the trees, so I've planted,
planted a lot of r-, winter rye to grow because that will grow in the
summertime under trees.  It's more of a sh-, it's a better shade grass.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  So now as, as cold as it is out there [laughter], and as rainy as it is, we
have, you can see where we planted all the green grass, but as, it's in the
summer, because that's the only green area in our lawn [laughter].

B.64:  Oh. 

A.65:  All of our Bermuda's all -- 

B.66:  Do -- 

A.67:  -- brown.  

B.68:  -- do you, do you ever double sod or, uh [lipsmack],   

A.69:  We have, on the side yard -- 

B.70:  You know, where they mix -- 

A.71:  -- few years back.  

B.72:  -- the seed.  

A.73:  Right.  I'm always, uh, you know, sometimes I'm, sometimes I'm, I'm over at
Home Depot I'll just a grab a g-, thing of grass seed and put it in the old
[inhaling] spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas
where I think I need it.  But overall, I guess we have a pretty good stand of
grass.  They say in the summertime, the hotter it is, the better the Bermuda
grows and, course, that supposedly, quote, will crowd out the weeds and
everything so, 

B.74:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.75:  I just,   

B.76:  I think that's our problem is that we, we just need to get it fertilized
really good [static] so that we can get the g-, grass growing rather
[laughter] than the weeds.

A.77:  Right.  How about, how about flowers?  You have, you have nice flowers in
your front yard?
