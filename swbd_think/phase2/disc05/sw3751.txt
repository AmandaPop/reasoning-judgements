A.1:  Where are you, Bob?

B.2:  I am in Plano.  Where are you?

A.3:  Oh, okay.  I am in Waco.

B.4:  Is that right?

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Oh, okay.

A.7:  Right down the street.

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Oh, credit cards.  My favorite subject [laughter].

@B.10:  You mean you use credit cards?

A.11:  Oh, do I.

B.12:  I bet you used them all up over Christmas.

A.13:  Yeah, mostly over Christmas.  Uh, I get in a rut with credit cards cause
they get me kind of in a vicious cycle.  Where you use them a lot one month
and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off --

B.14:  And then your are in #debt.#

A.15:  -- #and so# then you have no money, 

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter] so you use a credit card.

B.18:  I understand that.

A.19:  Yeah.  Uh, I probably have one of every credit card there is.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Do you use them a lot?

B.22:  Well, uh, it kind of comes and goes, uh, I use uh, Citibank, the, uh,
Advantage one --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend.
Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way.

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything.

A.27:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, that is a good idea.  #Is that# -- 

B.28:  #That is what I,# 

A.29:  -- that through a VISA?

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  Huh.

B.34:  But, uh, I got all sorts of credit cards for my business that I use but,
uh, 

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  If I can get away with paying them off every month, it is alright.  If I
don't then it gets expensive [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah.  That is my problem.  I don't try and pay them off.  I pay, like the
minimum.

B.38:  Well you shouldn't do that.

A.39:  I know [laughter].  #So I have got myself,# 

B.40:  #You never, you never# get out of the hole that way.

A.41:  Exactly.  I have got, that is why I have got myself with all this trouble
now.  But, I pay most of them on time and everything.  It is just the, I
always have them.  So, it is kind of strange.

B.42:  Kind of like the federal government right?

A.43:  Oh, yeah.  Exactly like the government [laughter].

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  #In,#

B.46:  #Can't# never get out of debt.

A.47:  In debt.

B.48:  And every time you try to get out of debt, the economy goes to pot because
people are spending money, right.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  Have they put the cap on the interest rates?

B.52:  No.

A.53:  I didn't know if they actually did that or not.  I know they were
considering it.

B.54:  Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent.  The
rest of the, uh, and me, we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  Funny how that works, isn't it [laughter]?

B.58:  The, thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit.

A.59:  I would be interested to find out how many people, or how much, uh, people
use credit this year.  Say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen
ninety-one, even nineteen ninety.  I think, I think it would be amazing how
much, how many more people use it.

B.60:  Well, I think so because the,

A.61:  Because of the economy. 

B.62:  That's right.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at.

A.65:  Exactly.  I would be very, I would like to see some numbers on that.  I
think that would be interesting.

B.66:  Do you, do you have any, uh, credit union where you work or anything like
that?

A.67:  Yeah, I have a credit union.

B.68:  Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card?

A.69:  Yeah, they do.  Uh-huh.

B.70:  You have got that one.

A.71:  Yes, I do [laughter].

B.72:  [Laughter].

A.73:  [Laughter] Yes, I do a matter of fact.

@@B.74:  Who, who do you work for?

A.75:  Uh, I work for Channel six.

B.76:  #Oh.#

A.77:  #It's# it's an N B C affiliate down here.

B.78:  I do a lot of work down in Waco, a --

A.79:  Oh really.

B.80:  -- lot of, I call on a lot of my business is down there.

A.81:  Oh, okay.  Where do you work?  What is your,  

B.82:  I sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling.

A.83:  Oh, okay.

B.84:  Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people --

A.85:  Oh, okay {faint}.

B.86:  -- down there.  Uh Gene He-, 

A.87:  So you probably work with, uh, uh, what is the boy from here?  {Very
faint}.  You ever work with Davis?

B.88:  Davis Iron?

A.89:  #Davis Iron Work, yeah.#

B.90:  #Yeah, matter of fact# I just saw them last week.

A.91:  Oh, okay.  And, uh, what else.  

B.92:  Are you in that part, are you in the south part of town now?

A.93:  Well, I live actually in Hewett.

B.94:  Oh, yeah.  #Okay.#

A.95:  #Yeah,# right outside.

B.96:  You know --

A.97:  So, that is where Davis Iron Works is.

B.98:  -- Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there.

A.99:  Uh.

B.100:  Bobby Parker and, uh,  

A.101:  I don't think I have seen that one.  I am sure I pass by it or something,
but I am not sure.

B.102:  There is a place in Hewett, called, it is a new company called Prime Air.
That is in Hewett.  Just around the corner from Davis Iron Works.

A.103:  Huh.  Prime Air.

B.104:  They make, uh, humidifiers and --

A.105:  Oh, okay.

B.106:  -- uh, filters for air filtration stuff for --

A.107:  Okay.

B.108:  -- hospitals, homes, something like that.

A.109:  Have you ever been to Marlin?

B.110:  Uh, yeah.

A.111:  I think it is Marlin or Mart.  They have, uh, uh, a place, I guess that
would be similar to Prime Air.  It is called H G H --

B.112:  Oh, really.

A.113:  -- or something like K G H or,

B.114:  Huh.

A.115:  I can't think of it.  I can't think of the name.

B.116:  Huh.

A.117:  But,  

B.118:  I will have to stop in there.  I went, I have gone through there, uh, my
oldest son goes to A and M.

A.119:  Oh yeah.

B.120:  He is working on his Master's.  The Navy sent him there for his Master's.
Mostly in engineering.  So, once and a while we go up six there rather than
take forty-five.

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart [laughter].

A.123:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I don't like that drive.  I make that drive sometimes we have
stories out there but, uh,

B.124:  There is always a state trooper down there.

A.125:  Huh.

B.126:  You have got to drive careful.

A.127:  Oh, really [laughter].  I know.

B.128:  Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over #sixty miles an
hour.#

A.129:  #Oh, goodness.#  They, they are bad at Hewett too.  On eighty-four.  

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  They are real bad.  That is where I got my last ticket.

B.132:  [Laughter].

A.133:  So, of course, I couldn't pay that on a credit card.
