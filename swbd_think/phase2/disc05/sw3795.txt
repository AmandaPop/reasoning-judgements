=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh,  

B.2:  What kind of crimes do you have in Hattiesburg?  

A.3:  Actually about anything you can imagine, uh, from, you know, this petty
theft kind of crud going around, vandalism, up to, uh, certain amount of
organized crime where, uh, gangs are starting to, to show up and actually, you
know, qualify as gangs.

B.4:  Oh, boy, that's, and Hattiesburg's not that big is it?  

A.5:  About fif-,    

B.6:  Fifty thousand or so.  

A.7:  Yeah -- 

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  -- right around fifty thousand.  We, I think w-, this census we just missed
fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that.  But, uh, yeah,
it's just right at fifty thousand.

B.10:  We're real disgusted around here in Austin.  We live in the city --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and on December the sixth, uh, four teenage girls were murdered and
mutilated two blocks from our house at a yogurt shop.

A.13:  [Whistling] Murdered and mutilated?  

B.14:  Mutilated, uh, they cut them up and they [breathing] put ice cream inside
their bodies, and then they burnt the place down, or tried to burn the place
down as they left.

A.15:  Uh, what, these are girls that worked at this ice cream -- 

B.16:  Uh --

A.17:  -- parlor or,  

B.18:  -- two of them worked there and two of them came to pick them
up when they got off their, at, at eleven o'clock --

A.19:  So,

B.20:  -- that night.  

A.21:  So, the place, the place had shut down already.  

B.22:  Right, or just shutting down, just closing and, I don't think the police
have a clue [breathing].

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  Uh, they've had the F B I here and have some sort of analysis of who might
have done it, what type of person might have done it but, 

A.25:  Yeah, character profile.  

B.26:  Yeah but,   

A.27:  Psychiatric profile.  

B.28:  It's just, they're still begging for help and, and, and I just feel like
some of, they're helpless at, uh --

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- trying to solve this one.  

A.31:  Uh, shoot, the, the big problem is there's no real punishment for crime
anymore.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  I mean, the bigger the crime, the less likely you are to get punished for
it.

B.34:  That's true.  

A.35:  ((I mean)) get out of ((any)) punishment ((anyway)).  

B.36:  My wife and I read a lot of, uh, true crime books and, you know --

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  -- court cases, things like that -- 

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  -- and it, boy, it just upsets us when people get off -- 

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  -- with little or nothing.  They're, they're on, they're out on pro-,
probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and --

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- it's just not fair.  

A.45:  Well, they slaughter in-, in-, lots of innocent lives and they get, you
know, a few years and a slap on the wrist.  Someone else turns around and, you
know, embezzles a couple thousand dollars from the local bank and they, they
practically get fried.

B.46:  I think about a year ago here in Austin they were, we were, uh, the gang
problem was getting real bad.

A.47:  Yes.  

B.48:  And they hired a hundred new policemen and a lot of them were dedicated
just to the crime unit, or to the gang unit --

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  -- and just recently they announced that they pretty much got it under
control.

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  There was only one gang related murder this past year.  

A.53:  That's good.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  If nothing else, they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're, you
know, not going to be very active.  At least as far as, you know, murders, or
open crimes are concerned.

B.56:  I think one of the things that they need to do more of, which I seen a
little bit here in Austin, though, is getting actual people in neighborhoods
involved.

A.57:  Yeah, the neighborhood watch type #programs?#  

B.58:  #Yeah.#  

A.59:  Yeah, that's one, that's the one thing that starting, s-, you know, the
only two things that are really making a difference are when the local people
get involved, and when they start doing something positive with families.
Families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty, thirty years.

B.60:  Yeah, uh,   

A.61:  And it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down
the toilet.  Lot of pe-, lot of institutions they seem to be fighting against
the family.

B.62:  Seems to be that way.  I, seems like everybody that we've heard of or know
that go for any kind of psych-, psychiatric help, uh, every problem you've got
is blamed on your parents.

A.63:  Yeah.  

B.64:  And that, to me, that's just defeating the family right there. 

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  I mean -- 

A.67:  Well,   

B.68:  -- if you can,

A.69:  To a certain extent it can be traced back there and, and, and that's okay
to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive.

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  It's not like they're doing it on purpose usually.  Very seldom are they
doing it on purpose.

B.72:  You know, out of my own family, I, I guess maybe I didn't have everything I
wanted when I was growing up, but I've, as I've gotten older I've learned to
accept the fact that I got what I needed.

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  I was clothed and sheltered and educated and,   

A.75:  Had some modicum, at least, of acceptance to support.  

B.76:  I haven't blamed any of my future problems on [laughter], on, on the family
upbringing or whatever.

A.77:  Yeah, well, that's the way it was with us.  We had, I had a pretty good
family life, fact, uh, I had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot
of people out there.  It may not have been perfect, but they did what they
knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how.  So,

B.78:  It's just, I, like I can't ever imagine my son committing a crime and I
think he knows that, you know, that that's just something that not in, in his
world, but --

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  -- there's so many people out there that do commit violent crimes and, and
small crimes and think nothing of it.

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  It's,

A.83:  I mean, considering the conscious, it seems to go, i-, i-, it almost
invariably does start with destruction of the family.  I mean, almost
invariably.  Children aren't taught respect, they're not taught discipline,
they're not taught the need to,
