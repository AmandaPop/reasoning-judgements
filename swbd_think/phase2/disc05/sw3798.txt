A.1:  Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, funding for AIDS research?  Do
you, 

@B.2:  Well, uh, uh, that's something I've thought a lot about.  

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, I, I work in a hospital. 

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a
few AIDS patients.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh,
spend more, spend less, I think --

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  -- uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Uh, my, for my personal opinion.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to
come up with a, uh, vaccine for.  I don't think it's going to be that easy to
come up with --

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- or I think they already would have by now, you know.  

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make
any difference right now.  I think they're doing the, is as much research as
they can possibly do, you know.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  And, uh, what about you?  

A.21:  Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now
[laughter].

B.22:  I'm not either.  

A.23:  You know.  

B.24:  I'm definitely not aware of how much.  

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  Uh, that's something I've never really kept up with at all.  

A.27:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.28:  Uh, #I don't,#   

A.29:  #I mean,# I, go ahead.  

B.30:  I'm not sure, uh, I know, uh, I've always thought more about the disease
rather than the der-, research, you know what I mean?

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  And, uh, that sort of thing.  Uh, if, if we were talking about the money,
uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply
because I don't know that much about it.

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  You know [laughter].  

A.37:  Yeah.  I mean, I, I can see that research is needed and, you know, 

B.38:  Oh, yeah.  

A.39:  #Definitely.#   

B.40:  #I think so,# #I think so.#  

A.41:  #I mean it's# becoming a major problem.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  But, uh.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus
on, uh, preventing it, uh --

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  -- in more,   

B.48:  Well, that's true.  That's true -- 

A.49:  You know.  

B.50:  -- because, uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease.  

A.51:  Right, and I,   

B.52:  Uh,   

A.53:  I feel like just saying, uh, safe sex is not the answer.  It's --

B.54:  No.  

A.55:  -- it's, uh -- 

B.56:  It's definitely not.  

A.57:  -- abstinence in certain cases and [laughter],   

B.58:  That's true, that's true.  

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  Uh,   

A.61:  And, knowing, you know,   

B.62:  Myself, uh, uh, I'm just recently, or about to, get a divorce --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- and, uh, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start
dating everybody I can or anything.

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, you know.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And, uh, because you never know what's going to happen [laughter]. You
don't know who you're going to come across, you know.

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  Course, it's, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and
have sex with everybody [laughter] I see.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  But it's something you got to think about these days.  

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  A single person.  

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  You know, and, uh, I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that --

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  -- in a hurry.  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  And, uh,   

A.81:  I think for a lot of people it has.  

B.82:  Certainly.  

A.83:  So,   

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  So,   

B.86:  But, uh, uh, I know that, uh, in some of these larger cities they're
passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- to prevent, you know, so that, uh, the drug addicts -- 

A.89:  Drug addicts.  

B.90:  -- won't be --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- getting dirty needles and everything.  

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  And, uh, I don't know, I don't think that's a bad idea.  

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  I know it, uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction
[laughter].

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  It just sort of keeps that going.  

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  But, uh, I don't know, at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS,
so far, cannot be.

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  You know, so, I don't know, that, I think that's, I'm not too a-, much
against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself.

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  I don't know, what do you think about that?  

A.105:  Well, yeah, boy --

B.106:  It,  

A.107:  -- that's a hard issue [laughter].  

B.108:  It really is.  

A.109:  It really is.  

B.110:  It really is.  They gave us a hard topic [laughter].  

A.111:  Yeah [laughter].  I mean, I, I definitely think that it's the drug problem
that needs to be addressed, but as you say, uh, people, I mean, in the
meantime, well [laughter] --

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  -- someone who's not ready to give up drugs, uh,    

B.114:  That's true.  

A.115:  You know.  

B.116:  That's true.  

A.117:  If they're perp-, perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each
other, then --

B.118:  Yeah.  

A.119:  -- #you know,#  

B.120:  #You know,# I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and
AIDS --

A.121:  Yeah.  

B.122:  -- AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as -- 

A.123:  Yeah.  

B.124:  -- something to, to do about it.  

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  So, so I don't know.  Uh, course, there's so many things in the world
where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another [laughter], you
know.

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  And, uh, so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is
worse.

A.129:  Yeah.  

B.130:  Which is the most important to solve at the time and,   

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  I don't know.  

A.133:  Yeah.  

B.134:  But, uh, but I've never looked into how much money they're spending.  I
have, I have no idea.

A.135:  Uh-huh.  

B.136:  And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that.  

A.137:  Yeah.  

B.138:  But, uh, I really have never looked into it.  I have no idea. 

A.139:  Yeah, I haven't either.  I've heard, you know, uh --  

B.140:  Yeah.  

A.141:  -- different voices -- 

B.142:  Yeah.  

A.143:  -- speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and,   

B.144:  Right, sure.  

A.145:  Mostly that's what I've heard, so I don't know,   

B.146:  Yeah.  

A.147:  And, yet, I know it's, uh, it sounds like big money to me [laughter].

B.148:  [Laughter] Yeah -- 

A.149:  But it -- 

B.150:  -- I think it is.  

A.151:  -- #probably takes# --

B.152:  #I think it is.#

A.153:  -- a lot.  

B.154:  Yeah, it does every,   

A.155:  So,   

B.156:  It seems to take more than, uh, for any little thing they do, it seems to
take a lot more money that you would think it would.

A.157:  Uh-huh.  

B.158:  You know.  

A.159:  Yeah.  

B.160:  But, uh,   

A.161:  Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that,   

B.162:  That's one thing I've never really feared.  

A.163:  Uh-huh.  

B.164:  Uh, uh, I, a lot of the, my family, you know, they fear me working like
that and, under some, some of those conditions, but, uh --

A.165:  Uh-huh.  

B.166:  -- uh, I don't fear it at all.  

A.167:  Uh-huh.  

B.168:  Uh, I work in, in the operating room a lot -- 

A.169:  Uh-huh.  

B.170:  -- and, uh, and, of course, when w-,
