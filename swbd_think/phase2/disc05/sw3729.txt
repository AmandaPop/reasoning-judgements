===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, I think this is going to probably be the most difficult topic
that I've discussed [laughter] so far.

B.2:  Really [laughter].

A.3:  Yes.  Well, have you returned anything lately?

B.4:  You know, I just did last week, as a matter of fact.  Um, I'm wondering if
their subject is more, uh, products by mail or things that you buy at the
store.  But, um, I bought something through the mail, through a merchant,
through a company that's generally got pretty good products, and I was really
impressed with the way they handled the return policy.  They sent U P S to our
door to pick it up, free of charge [clicking] which is such a, an unusual ((
)), always have to go to a post office or some place to return it --

@A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- usually.

A.7:  Was this Spiegel by any chance?

B.8:  It was Hannah Anderson, the children's, um, clothing.

A.9:  Don't know [clicking] that one.  I know Spiegel does that.

B.10:  Do they?

A.11:  Yes, and, uh, to me that's very impressive to think that.

B.12:  It really is.

A.13:  But, well, and, did you have any problem, you obviously had no problem with
returning it.

B.14:  It took a while, because it was the holiday weeks.  Um.

A.15:  Oh, well.

B.16:  It was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive.  We're, we're
fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home, so he was
here, but it would have probably been an inconvenience if it had been a home
pickup, and --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and we hadn't been here, but, they were also willing to pick up at work.

A.19:  Did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like
it?

B.20:  It was defective.  We returned it for the same thing, um, in a little
larger size, but it seemed that it was stitched, uh, around the collar such
that the second time she wore it, it, uh, it ripped.

A.21:  Huh.

B.22:  And, and I think that's unusual for that company, because they do usually
have pretty good products, but, to, to answer the question that we were posed
about whether things tend to be poor quality, I think definitely.  I think a
lot of the things that, um, are not necessarily low price tend to be
manufactured in a lot of cases, as if they were [laughter] lower priced.

A.23:  Well, I know what you mean, because a couple years ago, I remember, I was
in one of the nicer department stores and looking at, it was one of the
designer T shirts or some sort --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- of thing like that.  And the thing was very expensive, you know, as they
always are, and it was a piece of junk.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  You know, stitching was terrible.  I think that they were trying to just,
you know, play on a name.

B.28:  Exactly, yeah, and it, it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the
department store's name for that --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- necessarily.  I don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas.

A.31:  No we don't.  I've been to one of the Nordstroms in, um, New York.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Nice store.

B.34:  They are really nice stores, and I think I assumed in the beginning that
they would probably ca-, carry overall pretty good merchandise.  But you, you
have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store.

A.35:  Do you really?

B.36:  Yeah, surprisingly.

A.37:  Do you have Lord and Taylor there?

B.38:  No.

A.39:  Uh, uh, we're originally from Saint Louis, and we came down to Dallas, and
they have Lord and Taylors here.  And I look at a lot of their house brands --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and I am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- in some of the stores.  Does Nordstroms carry their own house brand?

B.44:  Um, you know, I don't know that.  I bet they probably do, but I, I'm not
sure that I've associated some of what I've seen as lines that they always
carry as their own brand or just something that they've, um, gotten at a, at a
lower, uh, price, because it's a large volume --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- some of their children's lines.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I tend to look there for kids' things because they don't, they, they
sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere, because they have a
pretty large variety, but not often for myself.

A.49:  Do you shop by mail quite a bit?

B.50:  Not that much actually.  I [laughter] used to, I think, before I had a
child, and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and
everything, um --

A.51:  It not as inex-,

B.52:  -- and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not
right.  Uh.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  I, I tend less often to do that today than I might have ten years ago.

A.55:  That's the only problem that I see, because, uh, my sister gets tons of
catalogs and passes them on to me.  I look at things, and they have some
gorgeous clothes --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- but the problem is that you can't always go by sizes.  You know, you'll
go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different
#manufacturers# --

B.58:  #Exactly.#

A.59:  -- and they all fit, you know, differently.  But, uh, that's the main thing
is that I can't tell --

B.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.61:  -- whether the thing is going to fit or not.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And so I tend not to mail order.

B.64:  Whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider
it, you --

A.65:  I.

B.66:  -- you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to have to arrange
for returning it if it's by mail.

A.67:  Well, personally, I always try on before I buy, anyway.  I just, it amazes
me when I talk to people that they buy, that they buy a bunch of clothes and
they don't try anything on.

B.68:  Oh, really.

A.69:  They take them home.

B.70:  No, I meant, even if you've tried it on, I, I'm thinking about some clothes
buying for kids or your husband or something.

A.71:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a different story, right.

B.72:  Yeah, it is funny, you know.  I'm also amazed at, uh, that I read about
those, I don't know anybody who does this, but, but people buy clothes and
wear them and then think that they can return them [laughter].

A.73:  I hear about that too, and that just appalls me.  I mean, that's stealing
really.

B.74:  That's what,
