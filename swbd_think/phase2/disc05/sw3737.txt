============================================================================

A.1:  Mark, I was wondering if you had any, uh, what do, what do you like to do
in your spare time?

@B.2:  Uh, I like to play my guitar a lot, and, uh, I, I do a little bit of, uh,
woodworking out in the garage a lot.

A.3:  Really.  Have you had lessons, guitar lessons?

B.4:  Uh, not really very formal.  I, I took, uh, some classical guitar lessons
from my church once, but they weren't very good.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And, uh, so I didn't really learn much from that.  I, I generally learn how
to play songs just by ear.  I, I listen to it and, and figure it out myself
and then go from there.

A.7:  Huh.  Well, have you ever wanted to play in a band?

B.8:  Yeah, I was, I was in several bands when I was somewhat younger, and then I
just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little pig headed and, 

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  self-centered, didn't care about anybody else but themselves.

A.11:  Well, and bad hours, too.

B.12:  Yeah, yeah, that too.

A.13:  Huh.  Well, I, um, I like to play the piano, I mean, I like to dabble in
it.  I don't play very well.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  But, uh, I wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as, um, I usually, you
know, I do some crafts and things --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- but mostly out of necessity, like if it's Christmas time, or birthday,
or, uh, we bought a house not too long ago, and I needed some decorations and
things --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- for the walls.  And so I've done some, um, crafts and things to hang up,
but I don't do it, I don't think so much out of enjoyment.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Do you do your woodworking for enjoyment?

B.22:  Um, yeah, I, I usually do my woodworking for stuff that I want, and for
just, so that I don't have, you know, it's, it's cheaper to, to build it
yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  So, I, I, I do it for monetary and personal enjoyment.  It's, it's, it's an
accomplishment to finish something --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- that you, that you made by yourself.

A.27:  That's true.  Is it one of those, uh, things that you have to have
expensive equipment for?

B.28:  Um, it really depends on what you're making. 

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Uh, if, if you're making a piece of furniture, yeah, you'd generally need a
good, you know, table saw and everything.  Uh, if it's just some little old
knickknack or something you can usually get away with like a hand held saw or
something like that.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Um.

B.32:  But, uh.  It's a, it's a lot of fun.  You just, you have to be careful so
you don't like, go lopping your fingers off or anything.

A.33:  [Laughter]  Sounds like it.

B.34:  My, my dad's gotten into the, to the woodworking stuff here lately, and --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- he's trying to make a, a, uh, jewelry box for my grandmother --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- for Christmas, and, uh, he didn't get it finished because he kept
screwing up the lid for it, but, uh, he, uh, he doesn't know all the, the
safety rules and everything, so I had to kind of keep him from taking off a
finger or two, and there's a couple of things he done that I've like, near
had, nearly had a heart attack over.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  It's like, Dad, you're doing that wrong.

A.41:  [Laughter]  #Exactly.#

B.42:  #You're going to hurt yourself.#  Yeah. #But, uh.#

A.43:  #That's pretty# funny.  Well, I, uh, since my kids started to school, um,
they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit.  They have like a
pirate day --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- a little Pilgrim feast and things, and so I've done some.

B.46:  And Halloween.

A.47:  Right.  So I've done some sewing and things, but, uh, you know, to meet the
demands of all these costumes, but, uh, and I enjoy it in a way, but, um, it
seems like we keep busy, you know, at work and at school, and I volunteer a
lot of places.  So that in my spare time I like to rest [laughter], #and to
read.#

B.48:  #Yeah, I, I,# I work at a Renaissance festival --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- down in Waxahachie and, uh, I have to make my own costume for that out
there --

A.51:  Um.

B.52:  -- and, uh, it, uh, tries your patience sometimes because the, the patterns
aren't always the best things in the world.  They, they draw you a pattern out
on a, on a piece of paper, and you're supposed to like --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- you know, figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself, and --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find
somebody else that already has a good pattern, and just copy it.

A.57:  Well, there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing.

B.58:  Yeah, like my mom sew, has sewn for years and years and years and years and
years and years.

A.59:  Um, but I have, uh, you know, done some knitting and some other crafts --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- like that, but not, uh, you know, not so much because, it's also
expensive to go and collect all of the material --

B.62:  Yeah, yeah.

A.63:  -- and then the tools you need.

B.64:  One, one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  I like that.

B.66:  I, I took a couple classes in, when I was in high school and --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- stuff like that.  It's, it's a lot of fun.

A.69:  #And it's.#

B.70:  #And it's# very inexpensive.  You go out and get you a two dollar pen that
lasts forever and,

A.71:  Right, and it's functional for, you're always needing, you know --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- it's nice to do your Christmas cards [laughter].

B.74:  Do, do your Christmas cards, and invitations and things like that.

A.75:  Yeah, sounds good.

B.76:  Or even something you just want to frame and stick on your wall.

@@A.77:  Yeah, that's right.  We have enjoyed that, seems like.  Um, we've done a
lot too.  Well, has it, has it been snowing that way, wherever you are?

B.78:  Uh, I, I live in Richardson, just outside of Dallas --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and it snowed just,
