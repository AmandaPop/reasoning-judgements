A.1:  Schoolteacher, or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or,

B.2:  No, I don't, no.  

A.3:  No, huh.  

B.4:  Not that really much exposure in the, in the recent past, either.  How
about --

A.5:  No.  

B.6:  -- yourself?  

A.7:  Uh, not a lot.  I've got a couple of friends that work, uh, as teachers,
or, you know, in, in different school districts and different things, but, uh,

B.8:  Uh-huh, and do you have any children?  

A.9:  I have a daughter that's only eighteen months, though, so we haven't --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- got exposed too much to that but,    

B.12:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.13:  You can [breathing] sure see where it seems like, uh, there's a lot of
concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education.
I, I --

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  -- kind of wonder,

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the
parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or --

B.18:  I -- 

A.19:  -- exactly what.  

B.20:  -- think it's probably a combination, you know, I think probably parents
expect a lot more out of the school system than --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- it's realistic that -- 

A.23:  For them to get.  

B.24:  -- that the school system can provide.  

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  And in conjunction, a lot of, uh, school districts' funds have been cut
because of,

A.27:  Sure.  

B.28:  At least in California that's the case, it's probably the case elsewhere,
too.

A.29:  Yeah.  Well, they've been cut.  Yeah, I just, it seems like more and more
with, uh, more families having to resort to, you know, to two incomes and
stuff, there's not the time that they spend and so they, like you say, they
expect the, the schools to do more of it, but, God there's only --

B.30:  I don't -- 

A.31:  -- so many in -- 

B.32:  -- even know if it's -- 

A.33:  -- hours a day.  

B.34:  -- just because, uh, people are working, you know, both parents are --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- working outside the home as much as it, it's a matter of, well, it's
kind of a philos-, philosophical expectation about who's responsible for
discipline, you know it's,

A.37:  Oh, you know, I think that's a good point.  

B.38:  It,   

A.39:  It's really a good point.  

B.40:  You know, y-, you could be working full time -- 

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- and, uh, still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance
at home in terms of homework as well --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- as the, the, you know, discipline for what's important in terms of
values and I think --

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  -- that's probably something that, not as many kids get.  I mean, just, I
guess I say that because you see it reflected in the society at large.  There
are a lot --

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be.

A.49:  Yeah, I, uh, you know, it seems like I remember on school nights, you know,
I was never outside past eight, you know, maybe nine o'clock at the very
latest.  Whether I was in doing homework or not, you know, I may not have
been, but yet, there was that influence in the home to where I was --

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  -- at least, you know, getting prepared for the next day or whatever and,
and you're, you know, you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that.
There's --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- out running around and, uh, doing a lot of different things that, 

B.54:  Maybe -- 

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  -- T V -s a bigger, uh -- 

A.57:  T V and Nintendo [laughter].  

B.58:  -- competitor for their time [laughter] --  

A.59:  Yeah, that's probably true.  There's a lot more, uh,   

B.60:  -- than when we were kids.  

A.61:  Yeah, that's true.  I know, you know, I didn't appreciate, I, I was, you
know, fortunate to where I could, I kind of breezed through high school
without too much problem stuff and, and didn't really learn how to study that
much until I hit college --

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  -- but, boy, I sure wish now that I had picked that up earlier, because,
you know, took me a couple of years in college before I really started getting
the grades going and, you know, it affects your whole life, especially --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- when you hit college.  If you don't, you know, do as well as you can, it
can, it can follow you for quite a while.

B.66:  That's a -- 

A.67:  So,   

B.68:  -- good point.  Just learning the discipline to -- 

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  -- to, to study.  

A.71:  To sit and study and, I don't know, it's, it's, you know, I only have the,
the one daughter and she's quite young, but it makes you a little nervous to
know what they have to deal with, you know --

B.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.73:  -- in the future and get prepared for.  

B.74:  Well, probably having gone through that experience, you'll be likely to
want to s-, speak with her, uh, teachers and --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can
do --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- to help her at home.  

A.79:  Do you have any children at all or,   

B.80:  Our daughter's two -- 

A.81:  Oh, yeah.  

B.82:  -- so I'm in sort of in the same boat -- 

A.83:  Same boat.  

B.84:  -- that you are [laughter].  

A.85:  Yeah, have you, uh, have you ever considered private schools at all or, 

B.86:  [Lipsmack] Well, you know, we're coming up on the time she's probably
going to be ready for, she's in a day care --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- situation now because my husband and I both work full time, but --

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  -- uh, I think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three
and a half, and after that time we really do need to think about it because in
San Francisco, in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at
the elementary grade.  There's --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- not a really decent middle school or high school.  I'm not sure we'll be
in the same area when she's that old, but --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94: -- uh, [lipsmack] I have to really do the research to find out whether or
not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are
and --

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  -- all that.  It's really, the, the expense is a real issue [laughter] --

A.97:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.98:  -- when you think about, 

A.99:  That's true.  Yeah, I, I am, I like a lot of the times, you know, I think
the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the
education they get.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  Uh,   

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  Sometimes I wonder if they can get that same thing in a, in a private, h-,
school or --

B.104:  Well -- 

A.105:  -- or not.  

B.106:  -- I don't know how it is in your community.  I know that, uh, in some
communities of San Francisco the public schools, well, actually it's not so
much in the city, actually it's outside more in the e-, Oakland or east bay --

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  -- uh, the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just
really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that
they're getting, getting what they want --

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  -- in the public schools, so they're almost like pub-,
