A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  Uh, well, I basically listen to, uh, all kinds of music.  

@B.4:  Like what?  

A.5:  Uh, easy, you know, from easy listening, you know, I just find that so
relaxing.  Uh, you know, like fall asleep to that.  Uh,

B.6:  Right.   

A.7:  I listen to, uh, I listen to rock, but, the only thing, the only thing I
don't like, uh, is, uh, hard rock.  You like,

B.8:  I don't like that either.  

A.9:  You don't?  

B.10:  No.  

A.11:  Like, uh, [lipsmack] my boyfriend listens to Guns and Roses --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- and I just, you know, I just can't, uh, grasp that.  You know, I just
don't understand why he likes that.  Uh,

B.14:  Well,

A.15:  I listen to the lyrics and I don't know,

B.16:  You don't want to do that, they're vulgar.  

A.17:  Yeah, and you, you, right, and you listen to the lyrics -- 

B.18:  Um.  

A.19:  -- and, uh, and, and, uh, he even went to their concert and I'm like, uh, I
don't know this person [laughter].

B.20:  Did he go to the concert --

A.21:  He,

B.22:  -- where they gave them about fifteen minutes and then left?  One with r-,
they were like --

A.23:  No they,

B.24:  -- an hour and a half late coming?  

A.25:  Yeah, they made them, they made them wait forever -- 

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- and, yeah.  

B.28:  Yeah, that was a real rip.  I have a fifteen year old daughter --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and, uh, she has kind of mellowed over the years and so now she's liking
country, but there was a while there where she liked Poison and Motley Crue
and Guns and Roses [laughter].

A.31:  [Laughter] Tell you, that just scares me, uh,   

B.32:  [Groan]. 

A.33:  because he's -- 

B.34:  Well,

A.35:  -- he's not really like that, I mean, he doesn't,

B.36:  No, you know,

A.37:  And he, he's not wild or anything, but I just, I don't know. 

B.38:  Well, I like all kinds, too.  I can kind of, you know, when my daughter was
into that, I [breathing] kind of listened to what she wanted to listen to and
said, well, this isn't too bad --

A.39:  Oh, you're a,

B.40:  -- because she never got into the -- 

A.41:  You're a pretty -- 

B.42:  -- the really,

A.43:  -- cool mom then [laughter].  

B.44:  [Laughter]. 

A.45:  My mom would, would have never gone for that.  

B.46:  Well, I sing in a choir at church and I like, you know, that kind of thing
[laughter] --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- more.  

A.49:  My mom would have probably ripped the radio off the,

B.50:  [Laughter]. 

A.51:  out of the stereo, if I'd have turned it on.  

B.52:  No, that w-, that [breathing] is not what one needs to do either.  You'll
find a mess on your hands [laughter].

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  But I, I like, I have season tickets to the opera.  Hang on just a minute.

A.55:  Okay.  

B.56:  [Talking] Okay {to someone else in the room}.  I have season tickets to
the opera and I love that and I have season tickets to the summer musicals and
I love that, so I have,

A.57:  What, what is that, the summer musicals.  I've heard of it, but I don't
know,

B.58:  The Dallas summer musicals down at the State Fair music hall down at Fair
Park.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  Uh, musicals like, uh, well, sometimes you go back to the old Rodgers and
Hammerstein's of OKLAHOMA and CAROUSEL, c-, uh, SOUTH PACIFIC.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  You know, it's like theater in singing.  

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  Uh,

A.65:  What, what, uh, what, uh, what year was all that popular?  

B.66:  Oh, dear, it still is.  Every summer they have, they have about six shows.

A.67:  Is it, was it in the sixties?  

B.68:  What. 

A.69:  That it was, that, that, uh, h-, what did you say Hammerstein,

B.70:  Rodgers and Hammerstein?  [Breathing].  Oh, dear, they really, was very,
very popular, mainly in the fifties.

A.71:  Fifties.  

B.72:  Uh, your main people now are Sondheim and, uh, ((Andrew Lloyd)) Webber with
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, STARLIGHT EXPRESS, CATS.  Uh, and it's really become
quite sophisticated.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  This summer they had GRACE, and they had the BUDDY HOLLY STORY.

A.75:  Um.  

B.76:  And some really good stuff, so I like a real variety of -- 

A.77:  So, it was just concerts --

B.78:  -- musicals.

A.79:  -- or did they, did they, uh,

B.80:  Oh, no, they're stories.  

A.81:  Oh, they acted --  

B.82:  They're like a play.  

A.83:  -- out the scene.  

B.84:  Oh, yeah.

A.85:  Oh.

B.86:  They're like a, they're like a play only, most of it's sung. 

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  And they're, they're wonderful [laughter].  They're just wonderful.  There
is a lot of dance to them.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  Wonderful sets and costumes.  It's really good.  LES MISERABLES is a
wonderful one.  It's based on, uh, Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES which takes
place in France during, it's not really during the French Revolution, it's
preFrench Revolutionary days, but talks about, you know, the poor people and
them rebelling and, the, the music is just unbelievable.  It's just almost
operatic in style.  It's really wonderful.

A.91:  Sounds really different -- 

B.92:  It, very different.  

A.93:  -- you know, from what we've got.  

B.94:  They're very wonderful.  Ooh, good stuff.  

A.95:  Do you listen to country?  

B.96:  Yep, Garth Brooks [laughter].  

A.97:  Really?  

B.98:  And Reba McIntire. 

A.99:  I'm a, I'm a Clint Black fan.  

B.100:  [Laughter]. 

A.101:  I don't,

B.102:  How about George Strait?  

A.103:  [Laughter] Yeah, he's okay, he,

B.104:  He's okay.  And, who else, Dolly Parton.  

A.105:  Um, she's okay.  

B.106:  And, I don't watch a tremendous amount, but some [laughter]. 

A.107:  Uh-huh.  Have you gone to, uh, Garth's concert?  

B.108:  No.  

A.109:  #I heard it's kind of,#

B.110:  #My kids have, but I# haven't [laughter].  

A.111:  Did they, did at a tell you that he swung from a rope -- 

B.112:  No.  

A.113:  -- like Tarzan, like Tarzan.  He, he, he swung through the audience like,
on a,

B.114:  Oh, how funny.  

A.115:  Yeah, I think,

B.116:  Somehow or another I wonder if his hat fell off.  

A.117:  Yeah.  

B.118:  [Laughter] [breathing] So, what else do you listen to?  

A.119:  Oh, what else.  I like Cher.  She's an old, you know, she's kind of old --

B.120:  Yeah.  

A.121:  -- singer.  

B.122:  Yeah.  

A.123:  She's been around a while.  

B.124:  Yeah, but she thinks she's young [laughter].  

A.125:  [Laughter]. 

B.126:  Do you ever watch Jim,
