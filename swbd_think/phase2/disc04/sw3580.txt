========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, uh, to begin, I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,
so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation
until the end of time, I guess.  So.

B.2:  Yeah, I, I agree --

A.3:  Uh.

B.4:  -- it's definitely new frontier stuff.

A.5:  So, uh, but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space
frontier, but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.  Um,
Star Wars is not too far [laughter] I don't think.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  But, uh,

B.8:  I, I, I worked on some of it at T I --

A.9:  Oh, have you.

B.10:  -- once upon a time.  Yeah.

A.11:  So what do you know about it.

B.12:  Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.  I get on a computer
network all the time, and people are talking about, about the current space
program all the time.  They're talking about new rockets that they're
designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know, it's
like they, 

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  take off, you know, and then they land, with the, with the, you know,
the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you
know, gliding down, but --

A.15:  Really.

B.16:  -- straight down to the landing pad.

A.17:  Oh, my gosh.

B.18:  Yeah, it's called V C X or something like that.  Also called Delta Clipper,
which is a decent name for --

A.19:  Wow.

B.20:  -- something like that.

A.21:  Well, I don't know. You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if
you had a chance?

B.22:  Oh, yeah --

A.23:  Do you,

B.24:  -- I think I would.  I think that'd be neat.

A.25:  I think I would just sitting here talking about it, but if the time came,
it'd be real nervous.

B.26:  [Laughter].  

A.27:  I'd be scared, scared me worse than Six Flags [laughter] roller coaster.
That'd be pretty hairy.

B.28:  Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car, so you know,
I, like I know what it's like to [laughter],

A.29:  [Laughter] Yeah, imagine.

B.30:  Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home [laughter].

A.31:  Right, right.  So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the
moon and stuff, now, wherever.

B.32:  Yeah, they're talking about doing that again, too.

A.33:  And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.

B.36:  Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next
few years.

A.37:  Oh, really.

B.38:  Yeah, and they're going to put,

A.39:  That's all [laughter] beyond my imagination really.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  But, science fiction books, I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know,
cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those
cartoons, so you never know.

B.42:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

A.43:  Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never
imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those, 
so,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  So you never know what, what may occur, but --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- as far as me seeing it, you know, 

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  I don't know [laughter].  I don't know, but I think it's real vital
important for the future, you know --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- generations to come, so.

B.52:  Yeah, I, uh, it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,
it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.

A.53:  Yeah. 

B.54:  Uh.

A.55:  I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know,
like it's more possible, but --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know,
when they,

B.58:  Yeah, I wish, uh, like, uh, Boeing or --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space
shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and they'd go up, you know, and do things and, 

A.63:  So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we
was all worried about --

B.64:  Oh.

A.65:  -- Russia and all that?

B.66:  No, it's still probably going, but I don't know whether, it, it, research
will go on.

A.67:  Yeah, but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on --

B.68:  Oh, yeah.

A.69:  -- on that, because it's not,

B.70:  Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know,
the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- of troops we have here.

A.73:  Yeah, I know, and then,

B.74:  But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles, they're still going to be
subs and things.

A.75:  Yeah, and we don't know who's handling them now --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- so that's a whole different story now.

B.78:  Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was
going to have them.

A.79:  Oh, really.

B.80:  At least that was, you know, that's what everybody says.  Oh, yeah, yeah,
we want only Russia to have them.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  And now they're saying, Yeah, yeah, you're a republic, you don't want
those, you don't want those.  (( )).

A.83:  Some crazy hit man over there so, 

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  with those little republican-, republics or whatever they splitting it
all up now, and one of them crazy --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- crazy guys get a hold of it, you never know.

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be,
he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he.

B.90:  [Laughter].  

A.91:  Pretty much.

B.92:  One hopes.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  [Laughter].

A.95:  I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of
subjects so,

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  But that way, [laughter] you can't never tell that.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  Kiss some butt, but,

B.100:  [Laughter].

A.101:  but, uh,
