B.1:  Alvin --

A.2:  Yes.

B.3:  -- uh, I guess I basically just consider myself kind of conservative, uh,
Republican.  How about you?

A.4:  Um, I'm more of a liberal, or at least, uh, in between, moderate, more of a
Democrat.

B.5:  Huh, okay.  Uh, what do you think about the, Bush and the economy?

A.6:  Um, the economy is, is doing badly, and Bush isn't looking good as a
result.

B.7:  [Laughter] I think I heard today that he finally admitted we are in a
recession.  Uh, it, it long time forthcoming for him to say that.

A.8:  Well, the recession started a long time ago.  Question is, is when, whether
and when it's going to end, or has it ended yet, but it's, the economy's
really not healthy.

B.9:  Especially down here in Texas where we had a big, a bunch of problem with
real estate down here and savings and loans.

A.10:  Yes, that's been one of the areas for, for, for problems in that.  We've
had it more lightly in that respect, but not without, without, uh, without
significant problems.  Uh, Perpetual Savings Bank went under here --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- one of the biggest in the area.

B.13:  Well, we've had so many changes of banks here in Texas that the names of
them are no longer the same.  They've got one called N C N B, and we're
supposed to think of it as N C N B and not North Carolina National Bank.

A.14:  Oh, oh, it's part of the recent merger.

B.15:  Oh, yeah, it's merging with, uh, something else from the south and going to
be First Southern or First National or something here, I don't know
[inhaling].  Anyway, I think the solution in my opinion is to have something
political to talk about is for the government to get out of business and leave
us alone rather than get into business.  What's your feeling?

A.16:  Uh, I'm not sure what, what, um, what that's intended t-, to mean.  Uh,

B.17:  Uh, regulations, controls.

A.18:  Um, as a whole I'd rather avoid government regulations and controls.  Uh,
uh, some are, some are necessary, and, I mean, in some ways what we're going
through now is reaction to, to all that developed during the eighties.

B.19:  Yeah, look at the airlines.  They, they were probably doing pretty well
back in the sixties and seventies, making a profit or at least getting
government support.  Once they pulled out the controls, look how many went
under and said Bye-bye.

A.20:  Yes, that's certainly true, I'm not sure whether it's bad or not.

B.21:  Um.

A.22:  Um, my sense is that, that airline costs, costs of flying are still, are
lower, still lower today than they were before all this began.  Um, but, we
can maybe reach a point where there the number (( )) in the field is too few,
and, uh, where, where government oversight, uh, is needed.

B.23:  And trucking industry, when they pulled the plugs away from that, a lot of
the safety that used to be in force disappeared, the independent truckers will
run on thin tires, and they'll stretch the hours and they'll do without
insurance, and, they, I think that when there was control there was better
safety, but I don't know the accident ratios will prove that out or not.

A.24:  I guess I don't know either, but I, there is a role for safety regulations.
Likewise in airlines, and I think for the most part, though that's, uh,
continued for the airlines, and the safety record today is as good or better
as it was in the seventies.

B.25:  Change of subject, let's jump to Russia.  What's the feeling over there on
the east coast about what's Russia doing and?

A.26:  Uh, well, I guess the feeling as much as I hear by, is that, uh, Gorbachev
is, is, is done for.  Unfortunate-, or unfortunately in a way at least,
everyone admires him.  Uh, but, uh, the future is with this, this coalition,
this, whatever it's called, infant, uh, commonwealth, uh, with, with Yeltsen.

B.27:  Yeah, wonder if Yeltsen knew how far it'd go when he climbed on top of that
tank.  Actually it's amazing.  If that one little soldier pulled the shit,
trigger and shot his head off, I wonder what would have happened.

A.28:  Things would be different.

B.29:  It would be.  It would have been a total different one little soldier,
probably nineteen year old boy, decided whether Russia communism failed or
made it [laughter].  Uh, maybe I'm too far off in saying that.

A.30:  Well, [laughter] it would have made a difference had there been violence.
Uh, just about the old regime still wouldn't have survived, but it was to have
been bloodier than it's been to this point.

B.31:  Hey, I wonder what happened to all that gold over there?  You heard that
one haven't you?

A.32:  The rumor is that much of it has been expended.

B.33:  Gone?  Spent?  

A.34:  Uh,

B.35:  You said expended.  Oh, it's been spent then.

A.36:  Um, there were rumors, I don't know what's happened.

B.37:  I don't either, uh, I don't either.  It wouldn't surprise me if some of the
guys,
