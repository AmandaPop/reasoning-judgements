========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, I don't see many of the current movies.  I usually wait until
they come in the second run theaters.

B.2:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.3:  But, um, what, what ones have you seen lately?

B.4:  Um, well, we, we are the same.  We usually wait until they come out on
video and then just rent --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- them and watch them at home, and --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- even then we don't watch a whole lot of the real current movies.  Um, we
did go to see last weekend STAR TREK SIX.

A.9:  Oh, you did?

B.10:  Yes.  My husband, he's a, well, we're both kind of STAR TREK fans.  I
wouldn't go so far to say that we're trekkies but we, 

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  we both enjoy STAR TREK, so we went to see that.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Um.

A.15:  Did you like it?

B.16:  We did.  We enjoyed it.  It was a good movie.  I guess it's their last one,
and they, the cast, they're getting pretty old. I don't know, 

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  if you're a STAR TREK fan at all, are you?

A.19:  I'm not, but my husband is, and he went last weekend to see it too
[laughter].

B.20:  Oh.  Did he like it?

A.21:  Yeah, he did.

B.22:  We, yes, we did. It was, it was a good story, and they find him at the end,
they find their name, so I guess that means that really is the end [laughter].

A.23:  Huh.

B.24:  So, um, we just went, or we rented CITY SLICKERS.

A.25:  Okay, I saw that recently. 

B.26:  A couple weeks ago.  Have you seen that one?  Did you like,

A.27:  Yeah, in fact I saw it twice.

B.28:  Oh, at the movie house or,

A.29:  Uh, actually, once we were on an airplane.  

B.30:  Oh.

A.31:  And then the second time it was at a, um, it's interesting, it's an old,
uh, theater, not a movie theater, but like a play theater --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- that, and they've put in tables and chairs and they show movies in
there.

B.34:  Well, how fun.

A.35:  So it's kind of neat, yeah.

B.36:  Oh, yeah, that was, that was kind of a fun one [laughter].  We'd heard a
lot about that --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and had waited until it came, you know, out on video, and then rented it
and enjoyed it.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Have you seen DOC HOLLYWOOD?

A.41:  Yes.

B.42:  Did you enjoy that one?

A.43:  Yes.  

B.44:  We haven't seen that either.  We're waiting a couple more weeks and then
we'll watch it.  Is that fairly funny or,

A.45:  Um, yeah, it's one of these lighthearted things.  It's, it's not very
serious --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- but it's, it was cute, I really, I enjoyed it.

B.48:  Oh, oh, good.  How about BEAUTY AND THE BEAST?  Have you, 

A.49:  No, huh-uh.

B.50:  We haven't seen, and we promised our kids we'd take them over --

A.51:  Oh.

B.52:  -- Christmas vacation, so probably in the next couple of weeks we'll see
that one but,

A.53:  I haven't seen that.  I saw HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS [laughter].

B.54:  Oh, did you?

A.55:  Yes [laughter].

B.56:  Oh, that's fun.  I liked that.  Do you have kids, or did you go --

A.57:  No. 

B.58:  -- just for yourself, 

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  for yourself [laughter].

A.61:  I went with my next door neighbor.

B.62:  Well, how fun.

A.63:  Our husbands both said, No way. 

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  It used to be my favorite movie when I was little.

B.66:  Oh.  Now I wonder.  

A.67:  So.  (( )).

B.68:  That's not out on video, is it?

A.69:  I don't think so.  

B.70:  I wonder if that'll be the next one they release maybe, if that's,

A.71:  I don't know, but you know, we went for a dollar.  It was fun.

B.72:  Oh, yeah.

A.73:  And we enjoyed it.  I didn't get bored or anything, either.

B.74:  Oh.  Now did you like, do you like the little theater where you go and
watch the movies?

A.75:  Yeah, we have a real nice one.

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  It's brand new --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- and, um, I, I suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway
goes in, but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere.

B.80:  Oh. 

A.81:  So it's not very crowded, and it's real inexpensive, and it's brand new.

B.82:  Oh.

A.83:  So it's, it's a really nice place to go.

B.84:  Well, that's fun.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Yeah, we, we, our little community doesn't have a movie theater, but we,
the nearest town has a, um, they ha-, it's a four, you know, four theaters in
one --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- that has the different shows going on.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  And I know they've got ADDAM'S FAMILY, have you seen that one, have you
seen ADDAM'S FAMILY?

A.91:  No, huh-uh.

B.92:  Did, are you going, are you interested at all in that?

A.93:  I don't know.  I think my husband will want to see it, so I'll do the same
thing.  I'll wait until it's less expensive.

B.94:  Right, right.

A.95:  Because he said when he went to see STAR TREK, he was out in California
with a friend.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  He said it was like seven fifty a person.

B.98:  Wow, my word, and wh-, how much is it for a movie there, where you're at?

A.99:  I think it's about six dollars.

B.100:  Is it? 

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  We were, when we went it was four fifty, four fifty a person, and that
seems like a real lot to me, even [laughter].

A.103:  Yeah, well I think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but you know,
about six dollars is what they're running, and that's why I don't --

B.104:  Boy.

A.105:  -- normally go to them.

B.106:  Boy, I'll say not, that's a, that's a chunk.

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  We usually get, go ahead and get the discount tickets --

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  -- but I don't think they were accepting them on STAR TREK or --

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  -- you know, some of the newer ones.  I guess they don't.

A.113:  That's right.

B.114:  To try and make their money and so.

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  So do you watch, do you enjoy movies or,

A.117:  Yeah, we usually go, usually every weekend we go to one.

B.118:  Do you?

A.119:  Yeah.

B.120:  Oh, that's fun, so you've seen, you have a wide variety under your belt
then.

A.121:  Yeah [laughter].

B.122:  (( )).

A.123:  Well, we never used to do that until this other theater went in --

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  -- and it's, you know, it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night --

B.126:  Right.

A.127:  -- and, um, the only thing is that when people at work talk about the
current movies I don't know what's going on but, 

B.128:  [Laughter].

A.129:  you know, about four weeks later I will.

B.130:  Oh, then they come that soon.

A.131:  Yeah, they have been lately.  Used to be --

B.132:  Oh, wow.

A.133:  -- you'd have to wait months and months, and now, like I was just looking
at the listings now, this week they started showing ALL I WANT FOR 
CHRISTMAS --

B.134:  Oh, wow.

A.135:  -- and that's a very recent release.

B.136:  Boy, I'll say.  I can't imagine why --

A.137:  Yeah.

B.138:  -- everybody doesn't wait until they come there because like, 

A.139:  Oh, I don't know.

B.140:  Well, like you say, around here we have to wait, oh, probably six months to
a year --

A.141:  Yes.

B.142:  -- before they go to the dollar, dollar theater.

A.143:  It used to be like that but now,
