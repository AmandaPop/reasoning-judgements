REMARKS:        Speaker A was very hard to understand as his voice
did not come through clearly during the conversation.  He also had
a baby crying in the background.

========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, all set, then.  Uh, what do you think about it?  

A.2:  Uh, [breathing] I think it's a real good concept.  Uh, drug testing
procedures would have to be refined.

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  From what I've seen on the news [baby_crying], there's a, a pretty good
size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, uh, drug testing.

B.5:  Oh, I didn't realize that.  

A.6:  Yeah.  Uh, there have been people who have been turned down for jobs
because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test, but they
didn't know for sure what it was, but it was a drug, so they got turned down
and, uh, turns out it was a prescription.  Or people getting somebody else's
blood test.

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  Same sort of problem that happens --  

B.9:  Okay.  

A.10:  -- sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like AIDS tests and such.

B.11:  Uh-huh, yeah, that's right, I have heard, uh, I don't remember what they
call it, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they
use when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs, but there's not
really, there weren't really any there.

A.12:  Yeah.

B.13:  Uh, every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about
that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated.

A.14:  Oh, yeah.  

B.15:  Yeah.  I, I work here at Texas Instruments so, uh, we, we do a, let me
think, do we, yeah, everyone coming in.  I guess I did three years ago.

A.16:  Yeah.  

B.17:  Everyone coming in, uh, goes through the drug [baby_crying] testing
procedure and --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- they talk about it as a, you know, as, as better for the country and
better for the working conditions.  So --

A.20:  Yeah.  

B.21:  -- if they, uh, they test for drugs.  I, I'm, I can't even remember if we
do random sampling anymore.  I know we did in the military, but --

A.22:  Yeah {faint}.

B.23:  -- I don't know if once your in they continue to do it, but I guess you're
always on [yelling] call for it.

A.24:  Yeah, I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart -- 

B.25:  Uh-huh.  

A.26:  -- and about a year and a half ago they instituted a, uh, [ringing] a, uh,
drug testing program, uh, well drug and alcohol [ringing] testing program.
It's, it's not a random --

B.27:  Uh-huh.   

A.28:  -- through the s-, it, as each employee comes in [ringing] -- 

B.29:  Uh-huh.  

A.30:  -- part of the hiring procedure is a, a blood test [baby_crying].  Uh, 
but --

B.31:  B-,

A.32:  -- (( )) I think the big problem, though, is, is they send these
[baby_crying] off to large labs --

B.33:  Uh-huh, right.  

A.34:  -- and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, uh, going
through it in a day and [baby_crying] bottles get mixed up, things like that.

B.35:  So your big beef with it is the, uh,   

A.36:  It's (( )).

B.37:  Is, is, it's a good idea, but like you said the drug testing procedures
need to be defined a little better.

A.38:  Yeah.  

B.39:  Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be
discriminated against unfairly or whatever.  Yeah, I --

A.40:  Yeah.  

B.41:  -- I, I tend to agree with you David.  Yeah, my brother, uh, brother used
to work for Wal-Mart and then, I don't know if he still does or what because I
don't know if Sam's is actually part of it, [yelling] but he, you know --

A.42:  Yeah.  

B.43:  -- is working at Sam's now.  

A.44:  Yeah, Sam's is part of Wal-Mart.  

B.45:  Okay, yeah, then he's been working for the company for a while, too.  He,
uh,

A.46:  Yeah.  

B.47:  Good company, uh,

A.48:  Oh, yeah.  

B.49:  You all, uh, have some, he's -- 

A.50:  Company's, that was a great place to work.  

B.51:  -- telling me about good profit sharing and all that, so.  

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  It's good news [laughter].  

A.54:  Yeah, they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying
stock and you have a, have a little taken out of your check each, each payday
to --

B.55:  Uh-huh.  

A.56:  -- put against, uh, uh, stock portfolio.  

B.57:  Uh-huh.  

A.58:  Uh, not portfolio, just, you know, against Wal-Mart stock.  But, uh, you
can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while.

B.59:  Yeah, that's what my brother was telling me.  That's good, good new-, good
deal.  Well, uh, how long were we s-, I haven't done this in a couple months.
How long were we supposed to discuss for?

A.60:  Uh, you're supposed to get five minutes.  

B.61:  Okay, we got a couple more minutes then, I guess [sniffing].  Uh, think
what else I can say about that.  Uh,

A.62:  Uh, do you have any idea, uh, let's see, you were, you were tested for
drugs as you got into T, as, as you got into T I?

B.63:  Right, uh, everyone coming in gets, goes through the drug test.

A.64:  Yeah.  Uh, now, uh, were you asked to wait before starting to work until
the drug test came through or,

B.65:  Uh, no, well, let me think about that.  Yeah, it was after, I w-, I had
already been hired.  Uh,

A.66:  Okay {faint}.

B.67:  Yeah, you get hired, then you come in the first, I, seems to me I remember
that, uh, I was hired, came in and went through some orientation and I thought
I, boy, I can't remember.  That would seem strange to already be working here
in the first week of the drug test.  Maybe it was during the interview.  I
came up a couple times for an interview, so it's hard for me to remember where
I was when all that happened.  But, uh, I guess, just like other companies,
other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around, it's, it's
before.  They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually
get employment, so I'm --

A.68:  Yeah.

B.69:  -- sure that happened to me, too.  

A.70:  Yeah.  

B.71:  What, what about, oh, they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart --

A.72:  Yeah.  

B.73:  -- so,

A.74:  They, they, it was after I was already working there and they weren't
testing any of those who were already working.

B.75:  Right.

A.76:  So,
