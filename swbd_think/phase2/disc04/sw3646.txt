A.1:  Okay, uh, so what do you think about the school system?  

@B.2:  Well, I think they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now.  I know
my son goes to a private school, but, uh, I think they're, big city public
schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, uh,
probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on.

A.3:  Uh, why did you choose a private school?  

B.4:  Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a, at a
pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public
school, so --

A.5:  Public school.  

B.6:  -- he's, he has been going to private since kindergarten [laughter].

A.7:  Oh, has he?  

B.8:  So,

A.9:  Then how does he like it?  

B.10:  Oh, he's loved it.  He is a senior in high school this year so --

A.11:  So -- 

B.12:  -- he's,

A.13:  -- he's been there all the time.  

B.14:  Yeah, he's done it the whole twelve and, uh, so many years and it's been,
uh, it's been really good for him.

A.15:  How big of a school is it?  

B.16:  Uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper
four grades, uh, about four hundred and something so it's maybe a hundred per
grade.

A.17:  A hundred per grade, that's a good size.  

B.18:  Yeah, it really is.  

A.19:  Kind of gives them the, you know, I get a little leery of the real small
ones [noise] that they don't get much interaction with kids but, uh,

B.20:  Yeah, that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
and --

A.21:  #So they don't,# 

B.22:  -- #he's done,# #he's done# -- 

A.23:  #That's good.#  

B.24:  -- really well, and just, he was just ahead at an early age and I didn't
feel like, uh, in, what was available, particularly in the first three 
grades --

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach
was still a pull out one day program.

A.27:  Huh.  

B.28:  And I just didn't think that was going get it.  I thought he needed to be
exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, uh, every day.

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  But yet still be with his peers -- 

A.31:  Still #enjoy the,# 

B.32:  -- #age wise.#  

A.33:  Right.  Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, uh, my oldest is in
kindergarten, so I'm in a little different --

B.34:  You're just -- 

A.35:  -- #ballgame.#  

B.36:  -- #getting# started.  

A.37:  I'm just,

B.38:  [Laughter]. 

A.39:  starting her, but, uh, seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh,
[throat_clearing] can really get away with murder and the teachers don't have
as much, aren't respected as much and, uh, they have to be so careful of the
things they do and say.

B.40:  Yeah, I know.  That's -- 

A.41:  And, uh, #makes me# -- 

B.42:  -- #a big problem.#  

A.43:  -- a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem to show that respect 
and,

B.44:  We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we -- 

A.45:  No!  

B.46:  -- were in school.  

A.47:  Heavens, no.  

B.48:  Wouldn't have thought of it and -- 

A.49:  No, you wouldn't.  

B.50:  -- and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe and, 

A.51:  And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what
I [laughter] understand, uh, I think that's wrong.  I think we need to get
back to the, [breathing] show some respect and, course, I guess the teacher
used to warrant that but,

B.52:  Yeah, but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home -- 

A.53:  Right.  

B.54:  -- anymore like it used to be, basic respect for -- 

A.55:  #For other people# --  

B.56:  -- #for elders# -- 

A.57:  -- #and,# 

B.58:  -- #and# adults and particularly in, in responsible positions [noise], have
not, uh, I don't think have, [breathing] had that basic [breathing] upbringing
in a lot of cases and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.

A.59:  Well, how do you think that that's happened?  You think our society's just,
uh, stopped talking out, or this, uh --

B.60:  I guess, I,

A.61:  -- generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,

B.62:  Well, the world changes, so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as
they used to be.

A.63:  Right.  

B.64:  I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things.  They have a whole lot
more, uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier
age, so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, but, but still, I
think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, uh, basic
values and basic, uh, respectful of, uh, -ness of authority.

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  And I just don't think that this -- 

A.67:  #That just isn't coming through# -- 

B.68:  -- #doesn't always get emphasized# -- 

A.69:  -- is it.  

B.70:  -- anymore, uh,

A.71:  No.  I mean, I remember, uh, well, it was a big thing when they let girls
wear Levi's.  We used to have to wear --

B.72:  Yeah, had to wear -- 

A.73:  -- dresses -- 

B.74:  -- dresses, didn't you?  

A.75:  -- and then you had to, a-, go to dresses, they had to be a pantsuit and it
was polyester and it had to be matching and,

B.76:  And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor and we hold the
ruler up here --

A.77:  Yes.  

B.78:  -- and it's no -- 

A.79:  Exactly.  

B.80:  -- more than so many inches above the knee [laughter].  

A.81:  Yes.  

B.82:  Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.  

A.83:  Yes, so it's really changed.  It's, uh, really kind of [throat_clearing]
gone the rounds, so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree.
They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit, so I,

B.84:  Yeah, I think that probably does have, have something to do with it, and
it's also,

A.85:  Do, uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, uh, re-, require to
wear a uniform or, 

B.86:  No, they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between like second
and eighth grade --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- did.  

A.89:  Yeah, there are quite a few of your s-,
