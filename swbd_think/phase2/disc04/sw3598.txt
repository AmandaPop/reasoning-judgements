======================================================================

A.1:  Well, do you like to sail?

B.2:  I used to sail quite a bit when I was younger, and I haven't sailed much
recently, but I do like it --

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  -- I do like it.

A.5:  Well.

B.6:  How about yourself?

A.7:  Oh, I love to sail.  I have a, I was first introduced to it when I was in
Atlanta [breathing], oh, gosh, in the late seventies.  I had a neighbor who
had a little seventeen foot day sailor --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- that we used to go out on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta just about every
weekend in the summertime.  It was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  And just loved it --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- and then, uh, I, I don't know, it, I had never sailed before, and I took
to it like the,

B.14:  How old were you at that time?

A.15:  Um, that was, um, twenty-five or so.

B.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.17:  And then I was transferred to Houston, and as luck would have it, uh, one
of my cohorts at work, uh, was partner, uh, with another guy who had a
forty-two foot, uh, Tarten.

B.18:  Wow.

A.19:  As a matter of fact, he still has it.  And so I got to go sailing a lot on
that, we've been down to Corpus and over to, um, I've been on the Pensacola
yacht race, and, just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing, and, uh, it's
spectacular.  Um, I just, it's one of my favorite, very favorite things to do.

B.20:  What's it like sailing on the gulf in, um, Corpus?

A.21:  Well, once you get out,

B.22:  Is it pretty rough?

A.23:  Well, now, sure.  I've been (( )) whenever it was just horrendous, I mean
when we went out in storms, and then again I've been out there whenever it's
just almost, you know, just real light, light waves.  I mean, it's, it's
varied from one extreme to the other.  But whenever you get out away from the
shoreline, out in the blue water and the, you know, the dolphin start swimming
along beside the boat, and --

B.24:  Oh, wow.

A.25:  -- (( )) it's wonderful.

B.26:  That's something.

A.27:  And of course, that's the best of all possible worlds, because I don't have
to pay upkeep on it, or any [laughter],

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  because, honey, you know, that, that, there's a saying, what's a sailboat,
it's a hole in the water that you throw money into.

B.30:  [Laughter].  

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  I've never heard that one.  I suppose that's probably true, so.

A.33:  [Laughter] Well, uh, the guy, the guy, my friend who owns the boat, that's
what, he professes that.  He said yeah, then he said,

B.34:  Forty-two foot boat is probably quite a --

A.35:  Yeah it is.

B.36:  -- investment.

A.37:  Yeah, it really is.  And, uh, he also says, uh, uh, sailing is, is, uh, a
way to go, uh, nowhere fast,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  to go, to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense.

B.40:  [Laughter] But then, you know, there's something so much more magical about
sailing as opposed to other kinds of boating.  I feel like, um, I don't know
if it's a matter of the speed, or if it's just the fact that you have a little
bit more control at the tiller than you do say, if you're in a power boat.

A.41:  Well, oh, yeah, and I agree with you a hundred percent.  I mean, I have,
after having sailed a little bit, I just have no interest at all in a power
boat.  And,

B.42:  Almost seems it would be slightly boring.

A.43:  Yeah, and it's just, you know, the whole idea of getting out there and, uh,
making (( )), you know, fine tuning the sails and trimming and --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and adjusting --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- just to, to eke out a little more speed --

B.48:  Yes.

A.49:  -- from the wind --

B.50:  Yes.

A.51:  -- and, uh, just have, and, I don't know, just the whole, you, you, you --

B.52:  More of a challenge.

A.53:  -- well, and you're closer to nature too, than having a big throbbing
engine behind you --

B.54:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and, uh, I, I really do love it.  I've got, uh, um, my company, uh, has
some, a facility in Aruba and I'm going down there in, uh, this spring, and I
hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there.

B.56:  Beautiful clear water down there, I'm sure.

A.57:  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.

B.58:  That's wonderful.

A.59:  So, one of the things I think I may even try is, uh, uh, you know, the, the
little sail board with the, what they call it?

B.60:  Oh, where you're standing like a surf board, only there's,

A.61:  Wind sailing --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- yeah, whatever, but --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- but, I don't, you know, I'm not quite sure if I'm ready to try that or
not.  I,

B.66:  I almost tried that once with a, on a Club Med vacation --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- but, um, they had these other flat, they weren't flat actually, they
were, um, probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun
[laughter].  So --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- I went where my experience was.

A.71:  Yeah, and I, I have heard people talk that, that, uh, you know, you almost
have to have lessons, and then it's really, you know, not easy to master
those, uh --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- those,

B.74:  It looks challenging, physically challenging.

A.75:  It rea-, it really does.  But again, it looks like something that, looks
how it, maybe like roller skating would be.  It looks like a lot of fun --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- but not that easy [laughter] to do.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  Have you ever surfed?

A.79:  No, I never have.

B.80:  That might be the same sort of muscles that you'd use but,

A.81:  Yeah, right.

B.82:  Or skied, (( )) also if your muscles are developed there, then --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- it wouldn't be as difficult as it might be for some other people
[laughter].

A.85:  Yeah, right, right.  But, uh, anyway.  That's, uh, sort of the, the extent
of my --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- water sports.  But, I, I do, I find sailing just to be, uh, one of the
best ways for me to get out and relax.

B.88:  Have you ever considered, uh, either buying in with someone else, a
partnership in a boat or,

A.89:  Yeah, I have considered it, and at the same time it's, um, where I live in
Houston, it's, in order to, to really get the use out of it I would need to
move down near Cle-, Clear Lake, closer to the water --

B.90:  I see.

A.91:  -- and, uh, that would mean commuting up the Gulf Freeway every morning --

B.92:  #Yeah.#

A.93:  -- #into downtown# --

B.94:  #Yeah.#

A.95:  -- #and, and# I'm, I live so close to the office, that I'm just not, I
don't know, the idea of having to commute,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  on a freeway in Houston every day, even as much as I would like to have
access to a boat, you know --

B.98:  #Yeah# --

A.99:  -- #more# often than #I do# --

B.100:  -- #that's a# trade off, certainly.

A.101:  -- yeah, it's, it's just not that,
