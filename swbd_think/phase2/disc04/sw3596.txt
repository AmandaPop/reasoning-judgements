==========================================================================

B.1:  about the weather [laughter].

A.2:  Oh, yes, very appropriate, I guess.  Uh, you ready for this?

B.3:  Yeah.

A.4:  Okay, John, just a moment.  [Beep] Well, guess what, we get to talk about
the weather [laughter].

@B.5:  The weather is, uh, this time of year has actually been kind of unusual.
I haven't expected it to be colder until, you know like we've gotten the last
couple of days.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  I don't know.  I fly for a living, and I've, uh, the weather's been
terribly unusual every where I've been.

A.8:  Oh, you do --

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  -- so you, you, you probably go everywhere --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- and have all sorts of weather.  I imagine it's kind of an experience
also trying to land and take off in the weather.

B.13:  Well, it was around here last night, I'll tell you that [laughter].

A.14:  [Laughter]  Well, actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, uh,
will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, uh, large amounts
of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of
records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirty-two.

B.15:  No kidding.

A.16:  So, yeah [laughter].  

B.17:  Um.

A.18:  If it keeps on raining like this, and I understand it's supposed to rain
until Saturday night.

B.19:  Saturday or Sunday they were saying, yeah.

A.20:  Oh, yes.

B.21:  Yeah, I know the systems have been real strong out.  I went through, uh,
Phoenix on, twice on, uh, Wednesday morning --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- and, uh, (( )) approaches to low minimum (( )) both, both times --

A.24:  Wow.

B.25:  -- and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather [throat_clearing] so, 

A.26:  [Laughter]  And so are you an airline pilot?

B.27:  Yes, I am --

A.28:  Oh, great.

B.29:  -- for Southwest, yeah.

A.30:  For Southwest, fantastic.  I have a brother, I have a brother that's a
pilot, also, with American.

B.31:  Oh, is that right?

A.32:  Yeah.  So I imagine you, uh, oh, with all this kind of weather it, uh,
makes it kind of dangerous for you.

B.33:  Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.  This is, uh, this really isn't bad
stuff to fly around in.  This is much better than dealing with the
thunderstorms in the Springtime.

A.34:  Oh, I guess so, yeah.

B.35:  Yeah, the, the air systems are reasonably calm.  We don't have, uh, the
turbulence --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- have a, uh, little bit of chop, but it's not like it is in the spring
time.

A.38:  Oh, yes.  Well, we moved actually down here from another location, and it's
spectacular the, the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time,
the torrents of rain.

B.39:  Spectacular is the right word for them.

A.40:  Pardon me?

B.41:  Spectacular is a good word for them [laughter].

A.42:  [Laughter] I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before
in Texas.

B.43:  It's amazing.

A.44:  Lights up the whole sky and even on a, on a, actually I've, I've seen it
where there's not a cloud in the sky, it's a cloudless night, and the rain
isn't falling, but you can see the thunder, and, excuse me, see the lightening
going horizontally across the sky --

B.45:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

A.46:  -- and back and forth, and what a light show. 

B.47:  Yeah --

A.48:  It's, it's fabulous.

B.49:  -- cloud to cloud it can be real, really sensational here.

A.50:  Yeah, that's true.

B.51:  Where are you from originally?

A.52:  I'm from, uh, northern Utah, and that's a very arid climate, from, uh, Salt
Lake City area --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- and there's always a lot of snow.  In fact, where I grew up we were
about an hour's drive from seven to, uh, twelve different major ski resorts,
and so --

B.55:  Oh.

A.56:  -- there was an awful lot of snow, and because it was an arid climate, the
snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow --

B.57:  Oh, yeah.

A.58:  -- which made it fantastic for skiing and, and sleigh riding and everything
[laughter] else.

B.59:  Oh, yeah.

A.60:  So, we had a great time.

B.61:  Were you near, near the Park Cities area.

A.62:  Um, yeah, in, uh --

B.63:  Beautiful area.

A.64:  -- in Snowbird and Solitude and --

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  -- and Brighton and yes, 

B.67:  [Throat_clearing].

A.68:  all those areas.  So I imagine, have you skied before?

B.69:  Well, we've skied, I have not skied that area.  

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  I've driven through it several times.  Uh, I skied, we skied California a
bunch when we lived out there, and --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- and, uh, um, and, of course, grew, we grew up in Minnesota, and we do
some skiing there --

A.74:  Oh, yeah, (( )).

B.75:  -- lot of cross country skiing there.

A.76:  Yeah, great.  Well, do you think this, the, the weather is typical for this
time of the year?

B.77:  Well, not really, 

A.78:  [Laughter].

B.79:  I, you know, Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow, um, the, um,
uh, we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already --

A.80:  Yes.

B.81:  -- I think --

A.82:  Yeah.

B.83:  -- and, uh, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the
temperatures that we've got today, you know, that moved in last night.

A.84:  Yeah, it's been, it's been cold.  There was a time, though, in the, uh,
middle part of November that got really cool, really, really --

B.85:  Yes.

A.86:  -- unseasonably cool --

B.87:  Yes, it did.

A.88:  -- and then it warmed right back up, and I thought, great [laughter] --

B.89:  Yeah.

A.90:  -- and that's, that's a fun th-, yeah, my wife was just listening here and
she said, yeah, it froze in fact.

B.91:  Yeah, it was, it was real cold.  Yeah, but that was very unseasonable for
us down here.

A.92:  And, uh, but, uh, I've really enjoyed the weather down here, too, because,
uh, two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and
play tennis in the nice sunny weat-, weather, and it's not as severe, I should
say --

B.93:  Yeah.

A.94:  -- as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah.

B.95:  Oh, yeah, that's, that's real true.  Same with us from Minnesota.  It's,
it's, uh, in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, uh, New Year's Day one year.

A.96:  [Laughter] Down here?

B.97:  Yeah, yeah.

A.98:  Not in Minnesota [laughter].

B.99:  No no, no no.

A.100:  I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota and they say, boy, six
months out of the year it's bitter cold, and --

B.101:  Oh, it is, it is.

A.102:  -- and the wind and the blowing snow and everything.

B.103:  Well, and they've had, uh, you know, usually in Minnesota they get their
snow in January --

A.104:  Uh-huh.

B.105:  -- and February, and they're up over sixty-five or sixty-,
