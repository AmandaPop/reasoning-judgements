======================================================================

A.1:  Think the Cowboys are going to go further or is this the end of the line?

B.2:  No, I think the Cowboys have a good chance to really, uh, possibly take it
all the way.  They're one of the, they're one of two teams that actually beat
Washington Redskins.  Uh, however, Washington has been, uh, what do you call
it, has been resting up.  And, uh, that could really hurt the Cowboys
especially if they have a lot of injuries coming into, uh, [throat_clearing]
the next two games.

A.3:  Well, there was a, uh, article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, oh, a couple
weeks ago before the playoffs started and it said their long shot prediction
was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl [static].

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  Then they gave their reasons why they thought both of those teams had a
[static], had a decent chance at it.

B.6:  Well, uh, that would be an interesting game.  I think that game would be
sold out.  What do you think?

A.7:  Yeah, I don't think there would be any problem there.  The only question
is, would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams
slug it out?

B.8:  Yes, I think so, because, uh, I think Warren Moon and, uh, Steve Beuerlein
and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the, uh, for the
nineteen nineties.

A.9:  Yeah, they'll probably want to see Emmett Smith and, uh, and, uh, see
Novacek and see Irwin out there and, and the no-name defense, so,

B.10:  [Laughter] Yeah --

A.11:  Who knows?

B.12:  -- the no-name defense, that's pretty good.  

A.13:  Well, and then Houston's got a good core of about, good, five good
receivers out there that, uh, that Moon likes to, likes to throw to.

B.14:  Well, did you see in the paper last Sunday about, uh, the salaries for the
different, uh, uh, players?

A.15:  Yeah, I sure did.  

B.16:  Well, what do you think about, uh, Montana being paid so much for not
playing this year?

A.17:  Well, he, he had himself a good contract.  

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  You know, if he's got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries, he's
in good shape.  Well, you know that Michael Irvin's going to get a big boost
and already, uh, Jones has said that, uh, they anticipate that he'll be given
Michael Irvin a big pay raise.  So I think that will be coming.

B.20:  Sure, I think it will be, too and I think Steve Beuerlein might get a
little raise, too.  He's, uh, uh, Troy Aikman, I wonder, even though he's a
real good player, I wonder if he's going to be able to, uh, stand the physical
abuse that the N F L offers.  He might not make it.

A.21:  Well, his problem is that he, since he doesn't seem as mobile as some of
the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein
or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity, while Aikman is around.

B.22:  Yep.  So, what do you think about, uh, the games that going to be played,
uh, tomorrow, Buffalo and, who they playing, the, uh,

A.23:  Oh, Buffalo is playing, uh, Kansas City.  

B.24:  Kansas City Chiefs.  

A.25:  Well, I, I really think Buffalo will, will win the game.  I'll be surprised
if Kansas City wins it.  But, uh, Houston, Denver, uh, that one might be more
even than, than people would otherwise think.  I don't think that one's going
to be, uh, blow off for anybody.  It might be a pretty close game.

B.26:  Yeah, I think John Elway still has a hot hand.  The trouble is, is
sometimes it's cold.  And, uh,

A.27:  And you, and you never know.  

B.28:  He's not consistent, he has a good day, he has a bad day.  Uh, I like that
these other quarterbacks that, that they're, are more consistent.  I think
Beuerlein has been more consistent.

A.29:  Well, Beuerlein's only had interceptions in one of the six games he's
played and Elway isn't throwing that many passes or completing that many.  You
know, if you're completing them to the right people at the right time you've
got a running game, you don't have to throw fifty times.

B.30:  Right.  

A.31:  You know, you know, we're watching the Bowl games yesterday and there's
some amazing Bowl games.

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  Some of those guys will be pros.  There's one fellow plays for my wife's
school, East Carolina named, uh, Jeff Blake and he's going to [static], almost
surely be drafted by the pros.  He had an incredible day yesterday.

B.34:  Um.  

A.35:  He, uh, threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and, had an amazing
day.  He rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the
fourth quarter to score three unanswered touchdowns in less than six minutes.
It was an amazing performance.

B.36:  I missed the name.  Who was that again?  

A.37:  It was Jeff Blake, B L A K E.  He's the quarterback, East Carolina.  He's
pretty well rewritten the record book and I guess the pros pay good attention
to him.

B.38:  I didn't, I didn't watch that game.  Uh, I did watch the Notre Dame game.

A.39:  Well, they certainly came from behind to pull it off, didn't they?

B.40:  Yes, I, I think that, uh, the coach there has, uh, really made a name for
himself with Arkansas and now with Notre Dame.

A.41:  Well, both those games are the only two exciting Bowl games yesterday.  I
think the other six games were either blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl, a
disaster.

B.42:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.43:  But, 

B.44:  That was a low scoring game.  

A.45:  Well, it was, it was a disaster.  A total disaster.  Well, I don't know, I
don't know about Detroit.  They, they've got a lot of injuries.  They may have
beaten the Cowboys thirty-four to, to ten,
