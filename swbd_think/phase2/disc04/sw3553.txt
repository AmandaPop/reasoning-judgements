=======================================================================

A.1:  Um, do you have any elderly parents or grandparents that have ever had to
go in a nursing home?

B.2:  Uh, yes, my, uh, mother was in a nursing home for five years before she
passed away in --

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  -- nineteen seventy-seven.

A.5:  Oh, now was it, how did you feel about that?  Was it a good nursing home
and you felt good about her being there, or.

B.6:  It was a fair nursing home.

A.7:  A fair one.

B.8:  Uh, [breathing] it, it was a matter, uh, she reached the point where she
couldn't stay by herself during the daytime.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  She and my sister, who never married, lived together.

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  And my sister couldn't retire at the time --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- so, my, uh, mother's physician --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- recommended that, uh, she go into a nursing home.

A.17:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.18:  And fortunately my sister was able to go visit her twice a day.

A.19:  Oh, wow, that is good --

B.20:  And, uh --

A.21:  -- boy, I'll say, that is good.

B.22:  -- she, she just reached the point where she had to have professional care.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  She was eighty-two at the time.

A.25:  My word.  So, she couldn't take care of herself at all.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  Did, how did she feel about it?  Did she, how did your mother feel about
it?

B.28:  Well, I don't think she ever really adjusted.

A.29:  Didn't she.

B.30:  Uh, my mother was very, very shy.  

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  She never joined anything --

A.33:  Oh. 

B.34:  -- and, uh, she realized that it was something that had to be done --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but she had begun to lose a great deal of her memory capacity --

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  -- at the time --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and finally about, uh, oh say about a year before she died, my sister
was the only person that she ever really recognized --

A.41:  My word.

B.42:  -- and could call by name.

A.43:  Oh.  Oh boy, now, what about the expense part of it?  Was it an expensive
one, or did her, did she have health insurance or (( )).

B.44:  Uh, no, uh, oh, several years before, well, it's a long thirty minute story
[laughter].

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  Uh, when my father died in nineteen fifty-eight --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- uh, I, uh, transferred the title to my sister, uh, which was --

A.49:  Oh.

B.50:  -- uh, [baby_talking] which was an internal family deal.

A.51:  [Baby_talking]  Uh-huh.

B.52:  [Baby_talking]  I, I knew that if something happened and my sister
couldn't take care of her, I would.

A.53:  [Baby_talking]  Oh, uh-huh.

B.54:  But, uh, uh, [baby_talking] we had fixed it for her, uh, oh, many years --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- before she went into the nursing home --

A.57:  Oh.

B.58:  -- like about fifteen, so that she had no assets. 

A.59:  Oh.

B.60:  So, as it turned out, Medicaid paid for all of it.

A.61:  Oh, great.

B.62:  Uh.

A.63:  That helps, because I know that it can take --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- a person's whole life --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- life savings.  I, um, my parents are not quite that old yet, but my
grandmother, um, right now is in this situation where she cannot stay alone at
home, either, and so, um, her, she has four daughters and one son, and the
four daughters rotate and keep her for three months at a time --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and they are all in a position where they can do that right now.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And then my husband's grandmother about, oh, probably two years ago, she
fell and broke her hip --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and of course she had to go into the nursing home there, and, and it was
a fairly nice one.  In fact, she got to where she enjoyed it there.  She knew
the staff and knew the other people that were there, and, and in fact when she
came home, she was able to get better and come home, she really missed the
association with the people there.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And I, but I don't know, I, whenever I go into a nursing home, I, uh, for
some reason it, it makes me feel sad, because I, a lot of people I know are
there just because, um, you know, their families want them there and, and they
don't, they aren't willing to take care of them, and I, I think that's a sad
situation.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  Um.

B.78:  My, uh, other sister --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- uh, uh, who was married at the time and was still working --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- worked for several years in a nursing home --

A.83:  Oh.  

B.84:  -- and she said roughly half --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- of the people don't have anybody --

A.87:  Oh, no.

B.88:  -- and nobody ever comes to see them. 

A.89:  My word.  That many of them.

B.90:  Yeah.  That's too bad.

A.91:  Oh, boy, I, it is.  I, I don't know.  A nursing home seems to be such a, a
non-personal environment, the ones that I've been to.  Um, I have been to one
that seemed really, you know, warm and cozy --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- but for the most part, they've seemed, you know, no carpet on the
floors, and just kind of cold and [laughter], 

B.94:  Yeah, I know.

A.95:  I, I.

B.96:  And they all seem understaffed, and the staff's overworked [laughter].

A.97:  Right, that's right, yeah, so.

B.98:  Well, let's face it.  There, there, for the most part, well, there's one
exception that I'll tell you about in a minute --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- for the most part they're profit centers.

A.101:  That's right, that's right.

B.102:  But, uh, my, my sister, who looked after my mother, uh, let's see, she died
in ninety, so this would have been the first of the year --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- in nineteen eighty-nine --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- she made,
