A.1:  Okay, uh, some of the T V shows I like to watch are, uh, mostly evening,
evening shows and, uh, like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to
tonight is TWENTY TWENTY.  I usually watch those prime time programs.

B.2:  Right.  

A.3:  Uh, I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.  Never miss that and, uh, sometimes
PRIME TIME LIVE.  Uh, and then the week goes by and I don't think I [laughter]
ever watch anything else.

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things.  But,
uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's
going on and that kind of thing.

B.6:  I li-, I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  L A LAW is one of them.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year.

A.11:  Yeah.  

B.12:  With the new cast and everything.  

A.13:  Yeah, it's hard to follow.  

B.14:  Right, and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL.  

A.15:  Oh, I've never seen that one.  

B.16:  THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.  

A.17:  Okay, yeah.  

B.18:  She,

A.19:  I've seen a, uh, the previews for that.  

B.20:  It's very good.  It, it's probably very much a woman's mo-, uh, show.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is
it, uh, HANDYMAN.  That's not what, uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT.

A.23:  Oh, we never miss that, or we try not to miss that.  

B.24:  It's hysterical, isn't it?

A.25:  Oh, we think it is,

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  so funny.  

B.28:  [Laughter] Did you catch the Christmas?  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  Oh, just part of it [laughter].  

B.30:  I thought it was, you know, and it had such a good story, too. 

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  Did you see the end of it?  

A.33:  No.  

B.34:  Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if
there was a Santa Claus.

A.35:  Uh-huh, oh, that's right and the neighbor, they thought it was the
neighbor.

B.36:  They thought it was the neighbor.  He gave the two doubting Thomases a
rubber band and a paper clip.

A.37:  [Laughter]. 

B.38:  [Laughter]. 

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  I thought that was wonderful.  

A.41:  And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the
neighbor.

B.42:  And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out
where they've moved it.  On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten
thirty that was a computer show.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies.

A.45:  Uh-huh, I've never seen that program.  

B.46:  Well, you know, it's, unless you're really into computers, you w-, and
software, you --

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- probably wouldn't be interested, but -- 

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- I don't know, it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was
available out there.

A.51:  Oh. 

B.52:  And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment
to spreadsheets, you know, and then they --

A.53:  Oh. 

B.54:  -- also, the hardware.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for 
and,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  I enjoyed that.  It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.

A.59:  Oh, okay.  

B.60:  It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the
show so,

A.61:  Yeah, right.  

B.62:  And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.  

A.63:  Oh, I do, too [laughter].  

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  Oh, I do, too, but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs.  I
don't know why.  I just, if I can catch them, I do.  Or if I remember.

B.66:  Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't
catch.

A.67:  [Laughter]. 

B.68:  But, uh, now I do, before I go to work, I tape my soap opera. 

A.69:  Oh, yeah.  I watch one and,

B.70:  Well, I watch two, but one's a half-hour and one's an hour and, and they
lead into each other.

A.71:  Oh. 

B.72:  And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS. 

A.73:  Oh, okay.  

B.74:  And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl
[laughter].

A.75:  Yeah, that's been on for years.  

B.76:  So it's just, you know, it's, it's, something I've done for the last
probably twenty-five years.

A.77:  Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them [laughter].  

B.78:  Yes, and I don't have anyone else at home, so I have freedom to watch --

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  -- whatever I want.  

A.81:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.82:  But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows and I like
the comedies and --

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  -- you know, and I, I do like good movies.  I prescribed, subscribe to H B
O.

A.85:  Yeah well, we,

B.86:  So I can get some of the movies.  

A.87:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We did have H B O, but it, we just canceled it
last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, #you know.#

B.88:  #It is.#  

A.89:  It's just,

B.90:  But I don't sleep a whole lot and I, you know, at two o'clock in the
morning, there isn't anything on regular T V and,

A.91:  Oh.  

B.92:  And, uh,

A.93:  Oh, yes, if you're up then [laughter].  

B.94:  [Laughter] So that's, and you don't get good reception without cable and
it doesn't --

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  -- cost that much more to have one of the pay -- 

A.97:  Right.  

B.98:  -- channels, so -- 

A.99:  Right.  

B.100:  -- that's primarily why I have it right now.  

A.101:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.102:  I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know, but that
was years,
