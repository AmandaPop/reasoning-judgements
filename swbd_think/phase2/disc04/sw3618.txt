=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, what do you feel about the nursing homes?  Would you put an
elderly relative in one?

B.2:  Um, only if I had to.

A.3:  That's the way I feel.  Right now I'm, uh, concerned with both a
sister-in-law and, and, uh, mother that I, you know, one of them will, said, if
anything happens send me there, and the other one says, please don't send me
there.

B.4:  Yeah, it's real hard on both the family and the people.  I mean,

A.5:  Yes, yes, it is, it's hard.  My mother, we-, I have four, or three sisters,
and my mother takes turn staying with us, and, you know, she's getting to the
point that, that I'm worried about her needing more care than we can offer
her.

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  So, uh, she can't, she, it's hard for her to get up and down stairs and
everything, and I just think, what are we going to do?

B.8:  Yeah.  How old is she?

A.9:  Uh, eighty-five.

B.10:  I see.  Yeah, well, um, would, like, if, do you think you're going to have
to, it's going to come to that?

A.11:  I hope not.  I, we, we will do everything in our power not for it too
happen, so, I, I'm hoping that we can take care of her until, you know.

B.12:  Yeah.  I went through this with both my grandmothers, we had to get someone
to look after them.  But we were lucky and we found someone to look after them
in their home.  We didn't have to put them in a home.

A.13:  Well, mother, uh, mother lived about fifty miles from me and a hundred
miles and five hundred miles from the other sisters, and so, if she, if
someone could have stayed close by, she could have stayed in her home longer.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  But as it was, uh, she had to come and start living with us, and, and she
gets more dependent all the time.

B.16:  Yeah.  Well, my great grandmother that we had to put in a nursing home
because it got to where my grandmother couldn't take care of her --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- after they put her in there with, I mean, she deteriorated, I mean her
health really got worse --

A.19:  Oh, I think --

B.20:  -- after --

A.21:  -- that happens --

B.22:  -- after a short.

A.23:  -- yeah, I think they just give up then.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Uh, and another thing, what, what would you do if you had to, what would
you look for?

B.26:  Well, that's, um, I guess, references or whatever from other people --

A.27:  Well.

B.28:  -- first of all, and then, all that you'd have to check, I think all the
licensing that they go through.

A.29:  Uh-huh, and I would check on cleanliness.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And another thing I'd check on is the food.  My sister-in-law was in, in
one, and, uh, she just had her hip replaced, and so she just went to one, you
know, for the time for it to exercise and things.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And they'd feed them really weird things, like salad for breakfast and
broccoli, and she was, she had her facilities about her, and she didn't, I
mean, she knew that they were doing it wrong.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So I think.

B.36:  Yeah, see, that's what it is, (( )) the people are so old in there that
they don't really know what's going on --

A.37:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and I think that they can get away with that.

A.39:  Yeah, I think that's a problem, too, so. 

B.40:  You have to, I think you have to really check into them real closely.

A.41:  I do too, and I.

B.42:  And then even after you put someone in there, then you would want to be
able to check up on them on a --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- weekly basis just to make sure that they were treating --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- them properly.

A.47:  Well, the one that I, that I, we would put my mother in would be about
three miles from my home.

B.48:  Oh, that wouldn't be too bad.

A.49:  And so I would check her, I mean she was in there when she had her hip
replaced too, and so I would check on her two or three times a day.

B.50:  Yeah.  It's a scary thought.

A.51:  It is, it is, and you just, you know, well, it comes right down to it, I
think it'd be heartbreaking.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  How old was your grandmother when you put her in?

B.54:  I think she was like.

A.55:  Your great grandmother?

B.56:  My great grandmother was about, she was, I think, ninety-two.

A.57:  Oh, my word.  And how old, you have a longevity, don't you, in your family
[laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] One of my girl friends, her, her great grandmother is a
hundred and two, but she still lives at home with her, with her family or
whatever.

A.59:  Uh-huh, oh, that's great.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  Yeah,

B.62:  No, it's a, it's a tough decision.

A.63:  What?

B.64:  It's a tough decision to put, to put them in there, and then,

A.65:  Oh it is, and, and you know, it's a tough decision to take them into your
home when you're used to your freedom.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  But, just, it's a lot of responsibility.

A.67:  Yeah, it is, and, and, uh, you know, it's just like having a child again.
Do you have children?

B.68:  No, ma'am.

A.69:  Oh, oh, you're just a youngster then [laughter].

B.70:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.71:  Oh, oh.  Well, I don't think we've solved any great problems, but --

B.72:  No --

A.73:  -- I wish that.

B.74:  -- what, um, I'm trying to think what else we went through, oh, and then
the medication if they have to have medication --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- that's another thing that, that, I mean, you never really know, and you
never really feel confident with anything unless you're actually doing it
yourself, and if they're at a home, you don't know that they're being given
their medicine.

A.77:  Right, right, and not, and, uh, my mother's on insulin, and I think, you
know, just giving her the right amount, checking her blood and giving her the
right amount, and then again, back to the food, I think that they have, uh, if
they don't eat, if they don't eat by themselves, or if they don't want, like
what's served that day --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- they don't eat it, and I think a lot of them starve to death.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  They just wither away and,

B.82:  Well, it's kind of, you know, you put them in there someone, so someone
else can take care of them, and then you really wonder, you can't feel really
confident that they're being taken care of.

A.83:  No, no, I don't, I, I just think the solution, if every, but a lot of
people can't either --

B.84:  What?

A.85:  -- can't take care of them at home.

B.86:  Huh-uh.  

A.87:  You know, if you're working, and, I think the ideal situation is like with
your grandmother.

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Have someone come into their home and live with them and take care of them,
and a lot of people like to do that.

B.90:  Yeah.
