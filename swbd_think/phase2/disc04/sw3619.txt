==========================================================================

B.1:  You're in a little different situation.  I think we're going to set the
record in Dallas this year for murders.

A.2:  Oh, really.

B.3:  Yes, uh,

A.4:  There's been a lot.

B.5:  Yes, uh, the, uh, and they're mostly drug linked here, but --

A.6:  Oh.

B.7:  -- we have uh, um, I really, I think we had like four hundred and eighty --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- more than one a day.

A.10:  My word.  Is that an increase over any of the previous years?

B.11:  Oh, yeah.

A.12:  Is that the highest?

B.13:  It just keeps going higher and higher.  

A.14:  My word.

B.15:  We're going to have a, we're going to set a record for us --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- but possibly will be the deadliest place to live in the nation.

A.18:  In the whole nation.

B.19:  Yes.

A.20:  Wow, that's terrible.

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  Does that, does that worry you at all?

B.23:  Extremely.  I carry tear gas.

A.24:  Do you?

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  That's great.  Do you, are you out alone at night often or,

B.27:  That, not, for that reason, no.

A.28:  Oh, now does, now is it mostly in certain areas that it happens, or 
just,

B.29:  Oh, yes, um, you know, crime is, um, I think, crimes against property are
more common, you know, they're common, fairly common all over.

A.30:  Right.

B.31:  You know, the some, it's kind of funny, uh, we've just moved from a, a low
crime area because it's got great police to a higher crime area --

A.32:  Oh.

B.33:  -- [Laughter] but, I had a, I had a pickup truck sitting out by my house
with, uh, all my furniture in it for a week, and it wasn't touched.

A.34:  My word, huh.

B.35:  So, I don't know what you define as, uh, you know --

A.36:  Right.

B.37:  -- uh, for being in an un-, in a less safe area --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- it's, there no telling, uh.

A.40:  My word, huh, well that, I know that, um, we're a little bit in the same,
Salt Lake City is --

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  -- is about an hour away from us, and they have had an increase, a big
increase in the number of murders this year, too, and they said that, um, the
murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either
stayed the same or declined, but the more violent crimes, like rapes and
murders, have, you know, increased, and I, and I think, like you said, it's a
lot linked to the drugs --

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  -- to the drug scene, and, um, of course the little community we live in,
we don't [laughter] have too many.

B.45:  You don't, well, you have it, believe me, but you might not, you don't,
it's not as prevalent, I don't,

A.46:  Right, right, I'm sure that there's, uh, we do have one policeman, you
know, that, that runs the, that is the law enforcement here, and, um,

B.47:  One?

A.48:  Right [laughter].  I, we're real small, and he's only been hired for about
a year.  Before that we didn't even have one [laughter].

B.49:  How big?  What's the population?

A.50:  Um, I think there's a hundred and seventy families, and I'm not sure, eight
hundred, maybe seven hund-, seven hundred or eight hundred is the population.

B.51:  Well, the one person who might snort cocaine in town probably isn't very
violent [laughter].

A.52:  No, [laughter] no, we do have, um, just up to the south of us there's an
area called Docks Flat --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- and it's up in the mountains, and a lot of the kids go up there for
their beer parties --

B.55:  Uh-huh.

A.56:  -- and, you know, drugs, and that, and that's probably the biggest problem
we have right here in the community, is these kids coming up, up a canyon here
and going up south for that kind of a thing, and that brings a lot of,

B.57:  Are they local?

A.58:  No, no, they're from, oh, from the communities around us --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- mostly, so, so they're not in town folks, and that, that brings in a lot
of problems spots, but, um, have you ever been the victim of any type of a
crime, whether a burglary or,

B.61:  Oh, I had a, I had a two eighty or three hundred Z X --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- that, uh, I used to have the windows replaced on that that I say,
monthly, three times though --

A.64:  You're kidding.

B.65:  -- they were stolen, from, I have three dogs --

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  -- three large, barking --

A.68:  Oh.

B.69:  -- fierce looking, not fierce, but fierce looking dogs --

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  -- that, um, sleep very soundly it would appear, but, uh, just from my
driveway.

A.72:  Oh, oh, that's a good idea.  That probably deters a lot of [laughter],

B.73:  Oh, well, my truck I was telling you about was next --

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  -- to the dog pen.

A.76:  Oh, [laughter] that was probably the reason.

B.77:  I think it does, but it's, um, that, you know, these are nice, they don't,
they don't catch a lot of things.

A.78:  Oh.

B.79:  I think if it's, um, if someone's coming to case your house --

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  -- and they knock on the door, they're going to draw a response from the
dogs --

A.82:  Oh, yeah.

B.83:  -- but if someone walked around my house, my dogs sleep so soundly, during
the day, too --

A.84:  Oh.

B.85:  -- that they wouldn't know.

A.86:  Oh, well do you, um, do you have signs posted that, you know, say,

B.87:  Yeah, I've got signs that say my house is protected by a security system.

A.88:  Oh, that's good.

B.89:  They're lies, but, you know,

A.90:  [Laughter] It might deter them.  Well, they say that that deters a lot, a
lot of would be, you know, burglaries.

B.91:  That, what's a crime like there?

A.92:  Um, I'd probably have to go to one of the bigger,
