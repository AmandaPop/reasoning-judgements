=======================================================================

A.1:  Kind of younger still, and we do a lot of activities with them.  How about
your kids?

B.2:  My children are in their late twenties and both are married, and we do
things as a family all together, and when they were younger we were very
involved in Little League and Scouts and band and football and things, you
know, I have two sons.  Things that you do together.

A.3:  Are, are your, are your sons still live in the area?

B.4:  Yes, one lives in Plano, and the other lives in Lewisville --

A.5:  Well --

B.6:  -- with their wives.

A.7:  -- I've got one son and one daughter, and I think the activities haven't
changed, because my son is in Scouts and the orchestra and choir and ballet
and church activities and, uh, soccer and basketball and baseball, and my
daughter's is on the swim team, is in ballet, uh, takes piano lessons, is in
the Girl Scouts, so, tends to be very busy.

B.8:  Right, well, I, my husband and I always felt that if you want to keep them
off the street, so to speak, that if they're involved in smaller group type
things that, um, [throat_clearing] it really is wonderful as far as
socializing and learning and just keeping out of trouble.  I work at a high
school, and I see a lot of kids who, because it's a large school, you just
sort of are a little teeny fish in a big pond here.  And if you belong to, you
know, a smaller group, you, you just have a better class of friends and, and
stuff, and I think it's wonderful.  I, I admire you.  It's a lot of time out,
Saturdays, Sundays, and nights, but it, it definitely is worth the, the time
to get your kids involved in, in various things.

A.9:  Well, give, gives them the opportunity to, uh, you know, to relate to other
people, and not only to learn a specific skill and how to apply it, but, but,
more importantly, how to, you know, work within the --

B.10:  Oh, yes.

A.11:  -- uh, larger context.

B.12:  Right, the social a-, socialization is, is worth whatever it is they're
learning, and it, you know, my kids never were on the championship teams, they
were both in the band, they happen to have graduated from the school where I
work, and, and, um, all those things have served them, and still are, you
know, in their adult years and in college, uh, you know, that they just, they
remember lots of good times, and, um, we still hear frequently from former
teammates or band members or, you know, people who stop by and say hi to my
husband and I, and, uh, so.  Are you active, with, I mean, do you coach any of
these things or,

A.13:  Oh, yes, I coached.  This year I've coached soccer, I've coached 
baseball, 

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  I'm a, uh, assistant scout master in the Scouts.  I like to be, appear
on stage with them in their ballet performances, and --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- get a feel of things, so it's a, it's, it's pretty active, and my wife
teaches piano, and she's active with the Girl Scouts, so.

B.18:  Well, it.

A.19:  It takes a tremendous amount of time.

B.20:  It does, and, and, um, but as I say, I, I really feel to keep them away
from the bad element at school or just at the mall or wherever, uh, every,
every hour pays off in the long run as far as, uh, keeping the kids out of
trouble and, and, uh, and I see, frequently see that here just because it's a
high school, and, and, uh, you know, kids, kids get in trouble.  There's 
no,

A.21:  Well, the ones that are in trouble are the ones that are bored --

B.22:  That's right.

A.23:  -- that's their biggest problem, boredom if they,

B.24:  That's right.  They also, you know, have parents that either can't or don't
care about their activities and don't support them, and, and, uh, over the
years my kids have had friends like in the band that, in, in three years of
high school band, their parents never saw a football game to watch them.  I
think I, I, we never miss a game.  We still go, and the last one graduated in
nineteen eighty-two, so, but we still, you know, go to watch these things --

A.25:  Well, sure.

B.26:  -- and, uh,

A.27:  Like last night we went to hear my son play in the, uh, orchestra, then
last week we heard him sing in the choir twice and, 

B.28:  [Laughter].

A.29:  there were,

B.30:  It's a lot of hours for a parent.

A.31:  It's a lot of hours to either be helping to run things --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- or to just --

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  -- sit there and -- 

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- listen to things.

B.38:  But it, it, I recall my own parents being active in, in my endeavors, and,
uh, you know, I think, you, you just can't spend enough time with kids in, in
quality time as I like to call it, and, and, uh, you know, it's worth every,
every hour, every, so you have two children, a boy and a girl.  How old are
they?

A.39:  Well, my son's eleven, my daughter's ten.

B.40:  Okay, well, see, mine are twenty-seven and thirty, so.

A.41:  Well, I've got a long way to go.

B.42:  [Laughter] Well start saving your money for college,
