=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what sort of camping do you like to do the most?  

@B.2:  Uh, well, I, I do, uh, real rough type camping.  I have a motor home
[laughter].

A.3:  Huh, rough type, huh [laughter]?  

B.4:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

A.5:  Okay.  

B.6:  [Laughter]  Uh.  

A.7:  Oh, yeah, motor homes can be a lot of fun.  

B.8:  Yeah, they really are.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  They really are.  I've, I've enjoyed it.  I've never actually done any, uh,
like tent camping, but, uh, one of these days I'm going to try that, too.

A.11:  Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too.  

B.12:  Yeah, like to go visit, uh, the national parks and state parks and, and,
uh, just get out and see nature.

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  How about you?  

A.15:  Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  This summer we went to, uh, the Smokey Mountain [noise] National Park.

B.18:  Oh, how great.  

A.19:  And, uh, stayed about three or four days in there.  It was wonderful.

B.20:  Oh, yeah.  

A.21:  Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.

B.22:  Um.

A.23:  And the days were nice and warm and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  That's great.  

A.25:  It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six
months pregnant.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  So [laughter],

B.28:  [Laughter]. 

A.29:  I don't know, it worked pretty well.  It was one of those, uh, those, dome
type pop up tents.

B.30:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.31:  Nice and quick and easy to put up.  

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  Packs away nice and small and, about had to be something like that getting
around in a Pinto.

B.34:  Well, that's true, that's true.  

A.35:  It was a lot of fun.  

B.36:  I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years
ago.

A.37:  Oh, yeah?  

B.38:  Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias.  

A.39:  Wow, that's got to be beautiful territory.  

B.40:  Yeah, it's gorgeous, I love the big trees.  Just, just the drive up
through, uh, up the coast line --

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  -- and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though.

A.43:  What, like, Sequoia National Park?  

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  Uh.  

B.46:  Uh-huh, yeah, I had been there before when I lived in California, but
that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe
[laughter].

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  But, that is God's country, it has to be.  

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the
center of some of those trees?

B.52:  Uh, no, they don't, they, the last one, well, the first time I was there,
the, the tree was still standing, but it has since come down.

A.53:  Okay.  

B.54:  Yeah.  But, they are huge.  If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe
inspiring.

A.55:  No, so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten.  

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis.  

B.58:  Uh-huh, well, there is lots of pretty country further west.  

A.59:  Oh, yeah.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that
way.

B.62:  Yeah.  Yeah, and you just need to take the little one.  

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  

B.64:  Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  They seem to be trailing out quickly.  

B.68:  Yeah [sniffing], because there is lots to see [noise].  There is, course,
the [noise] the Grand Canyon and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty,
[baby_crying] in a different sort of way.

A.69:  Yes.  

B.70:  And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and [breathing], and you
get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone and, uh, the Grand Tetons are
gorgeous, too.

A.71:  I imagine.  

B.72:  Yeah,

A.73:  I would imagine they are.

B.74:  Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country.  

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now [laughter].

A.77:  [Laughter]. 

B.78:  I think it's called a job, I don't know [laughter].  

A.79:  Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?  

B.80:  No [laughter], not around here.  

A.81:  Oh. 

B.82:  Not around here [noise]. 

A.83:  Place is forested with c-, with those concrete trees.  

B.84:  Uh-huh, lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know.  

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  [Laughter]. 

A.87:  Well, I guess that's God's place, too.  Anyway,

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?

B.90:  Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California I took, uh, three
weeks.

A.91:  Three weeks.  

B.92:  And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks. 

A.93:  Yeah, the whole family, then, was -- 

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  -- in on this?  

B.96:  Everybody [laughter].  

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  Yep.  

A.99:  That would have to be a blast.  

B.100:  Yeah, it really was, it was great.  

A.101:  What, well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?  

B.102:  Uh-huh, yeah.  We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went
through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas
for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on
the coast.

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San
Francisco.

A.105:  Okay. 

B.106:  And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country.  

A.107:  Oh, wow.  

B.108:  And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park.  

A.109:  Okay, Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the
ocean almost all the time --

B.110:  Oh, yeah.  

A.111:  -- aren't you?
