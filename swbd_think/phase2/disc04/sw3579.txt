=========================================================================

A.1:  All right, we'll go ahead and start with you and your opinion.

@B.2:  Well, um, in, I think what it is in this country is that we have this, uh,
[inhaling] despite all the complaints we have about government, we essentially
have a great deal of faith that despite, uh, any election, things really
aren't going to change dramatically --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- based on any given election, and there, really no one gets all excited
over politics, uh, over the, the, you think of some countries where they've
changed, uh, um, you know, have a, a coup or some (( )) form of government
there may change, uh, every few years, like, an example would be the gov-,
South American governments.

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  But here, it's, it's very stable --

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- and, uh, you ne-, there's nothing really to get all that excited over.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  But maybe people should get a little excited and make some changes.

A.11:  Yeah, I think, I think that has a lot to do with it like you said, you
know, unless there's something really controversial no one ever votes.

B.12:  Right, right, yeah, people will vote presidential elections --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- um, you know, a local election that may have some great import, but, uh,
you know, over all people don't have a whole lot to, to worry about [laughter]
when it comes to politics.

A.15:  [Laughter] Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.  That, and they're
just lazy --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- kind of.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  Like, for instance, I haven't voted since I was eighteen just like, I'm
twenty-two now, and I don't live at, I live out of the state that I'm
registered to vote in, and it's just, like you said, unless there's [laughter]
something really --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- important I just don't take the time.

B.22:  Well, that, that's just it.  I'm, I'm twenty-four, and I'm in the 
military --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and, uh, I'm, uh, uh, registered to vote in Pennsylvania --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and I only voted once.  It was in, uh, (( )) last presidential 
election --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- you know, and it was just because, [laughter] you know, it's too much of
a hassle to get the absentee ballot --

A.29:  Exactly.

B.30:  -- or even to, to drive back there, which is what I did that time.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  I actually went and visited my folks and voted --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- the same time, but, uh --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- um, in my position, I, well in addition to that the local political
scene I don't know enough about it any more to even feel that my vote means
anything --

A.37:  Right, and for me I'm just,

B.38:  -- because I don't know the, the candidates.  Um.

A.39:  Right, like I'm afraid I'd vote for somebody who I didn't even, you know,
agree with --

B.40:  Right, yeah.

A.41:  -- just because I [laughter] want to vote or whatever.

B.42:  Right, right, but, I, I think, um, that's all things, that it's all my own
laziness, though --

A.43:  Yeah, oh, I agree that's probably --

B.44:  -- because --

A.45:  -- same thing.

B.46:  -- first of all I should take the time to find out about the candidates.  I
probably should talk to my mom and dad who do live there and get a feeling for
what, uh, for what they are, you know, have been doing and, uh, avoid what
they feel the candidates are doing and, uh, um, maybe do a little looking into
it myself.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  It's not like any of this is any big secret --

A.49:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.50:  -- but it's just a question of taking the time, and it's, there're higher
priorities, right [laughter].

A.51:  Right.  And I think it's really interesting, too, like with this, the
latest election in Louisiana where there was the guy who'd been part of the Ku
Klux Klan --

B.52:  Right, David --

A.53:  -- how much --

B.54:  -- Duke, yeah.

A.55:  -- yeah, how much interest that brought.  And how many people.

B.56:  Yeah, it was interesting.  There was quite a few people in this area that
had contributed to his campaign --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- and I'm in upstate New York, and this is kind of a red neck area, but
the, 

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  local newspapers, um, printed, they somehow got a list of all of Duke's
contributors --

A.61:  Oh, really.

B.62:  -- and they printed a list in the newspaper everybody that gave money to
that campaign.

A.63:  Oh, my.

B.64:  You want to talk about, 

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  getting, getting even with them.  

A.67:  Right [laughter].

B.68:  Uh, that was, I thought that was beautiful [laughter] justice.

A.69:  [Laughter]  Yeah, I think it's interesting how it takes something like
that, though.

B.70:  What's that?

A.71:  I think it's interesting how it takes something like that --

B.72:  Yeah, yeah.

A.73:  -- to get people on edge about politics.

B.74:  Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, people you think about having somebody like that
in power and, uh, you know, and that shocks them all.  But then, uh, flip side
is the same people go around, um, harboring their own racist, racist practices
and raci-, you know, you ask those same people --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- um, how they treat people and all that, and --

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  -- you probably would not get a very favorable answer out of them.

A.79:  Yeah, I agree.

B.80:  But the idea, the merit, the thought of somebody who publicly was a member
of the Ku Klux Klan is pretty repulsive --

A.81:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.82:  -- being in a position of power like that.

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  So.

A.85:  Well, there's anything you think we can do to make it better or to,

B.86:  What we can do to make it better.  Right.  That, that's hard, because, um,
I thought in the last, not this last year's election but the one a year ago,
that they were going, that there was going to be some serious turn around of
the incumbents and all that --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- that people were finally fed up,
