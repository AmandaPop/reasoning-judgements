A.1:  Okay, where have you been on vacations?

B.2:  Well, I've been to Europe, uh, England and France, uh --

A.3:  Oh, wow [laughter].

B.4:  -- specifically, I like those.

A.5:  International, huh.

B.6:  But, uh, my favorite things to do, I think, are going skiing in the 
winter --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- Utah, Colorado --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- uh, et cetera.

A.11:  Oh, great.  So when you went, to, uh, you know, to Europe and, did you go
on, was that a one trip or three different trips?

B.12:  That was a single, about a ten day swing through, uh --

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  -- maybe six in England and four in France.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  How did you like that?  Was that too fast?

B.16:  It was great. 

A.17:  Oh, was it?

B.18:  Yes, I had my son with me, uh --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- my sixteen year old son --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and so that was, that was a good experience for him to #see some of the
things# --

A.23:  #Boy, I'll say.#

B.24:  -- he had studied and so forth.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Now was that before, um, before the two Germanies were, when they
were separate or,

B.26:  No, it was, it was, well, yeah, it was as it was happening, actually.

A.27:  Was it really?  Oh wow.

B.28:  Kind of, uh, it was, it was pretty close to that time.

A.29:  You were there right while history was taking place.

B.30:  But we weren't over in that part of the world --

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  -- so it wasn't really, uh, something that we got a lot of --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- of input into but,

A.35:  Oh.

B.36:  How about yourself?  Where do you, where do you like to go to vacation?

A.37:  Well, uh, we take our vacations, we mostly go camping in the mountains.  We
live in a little mountain community, and, um, even when I was growing up
though, we would go to places like, oh, Redfish Lake in Idaho and, um, Island
Park in Idaho, different places like that.  I have been to, uh, my husband and
I have been different places like to Disney World, and I'm not a real big
person for flying [laughter].

B.38:  Oh, okay [laughter].

A.39:  I just as soon would, would travel, you know, on the ground, um.

B.40:  You got some great camping areas in your area there close.

A.41:  We do, we do.

B.42:  I'm a, I'm a Boy Scout leader so I'm out backpacking, camping quite a bit,
too.

A.43:  Oh, boy I'll say, you probably are.

B.44:  I've done, uh, mountains in New Mexico and Colorado, but I never have --

A.45:  Oh.

B.46:  -- gotten up into Idaho and Wyoming --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and those parts of Utah that are so pretty, and.

A.49:  Oh, there, there are.  There're some gorgeous plac-, you've never been to
the Tetons or.

B.50:  No --

A.51:  (( )).

B.52:  -- I would like to.

A.53:  Oh, it is nice.  Now when you go skiing, do yo-, you fly here I imagine.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  (( )).

B.56:  Yeah, you just fly into Denver or Salt Lake or somewhere and then --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- rent a car and go the rest of the way.

A.59:  Oh, do you enjoy that?

B.60:  Yes (( )).

A.61:  Do you come alone or with your,

B.62:  Usually with, uh, just whoever.  

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Uh, the whole office is going skiing.  I'm taking my, my whole office --

A.65:  Oh.

B.66:  -- in February to Crested Butte --

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  -- and then in a week Mom and I agreed to chaperon my son's, 

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  school trip to Vale --

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  -- with about fifty-five young people --

A.73:  Oh, wow [laughter].

B.74:  -- and five adults [laughter].

A.75:  Um, oh, boy --

B.76:  And then,

A.77:  -- you will have your, your hands full.  How long is that going to be for?

B.78:  That'll be five days in March.

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  But, uh --

A.81:  Huh.

B.82:  -- sometimes I've taken my girl friend and gone --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- like last winter I did that, and so.

A.85:  Oh, well, how fun.  Now when you went abroad, did you, was it a package
plan, or did you plan it yourself or,

B.86:  Planned it myself and, uh, arranged for a private, uh, residence in, um,
[lipsmack] England --

A.87:  Oh.

B.88:  -- through a guy that we knew --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- that had a flat there.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  And, then, uh, the travel agent downstairs helped me with a, a lodging
place in Paris.

A.93:  Oh.

B.94:  And then we kind of booked some other things on our own, that was, so it
was sort of a piece meal thing.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  Oh, well, that, did that work out good, would you do that again?

B.96:  Yeah, I think so, it depen-, depend on where I was going.  

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  I had good inside information about where I was headed, and --

A.99:  Oh.

B.100:  -- so I knew kind of what I was getting into, but if --

A.101:  Wh-,

B.102:  -- if I were to strike out to a part of the world I didn't know anything
about, I --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- I might not do it all on my own.

A.105:  Uh-huh.  Did you have places arranged that you wanted to see, to, you know
when you scheduled it?

B.106:  Yeah, yeah, we kind of had a list going of things, and we did some
trade-offs and we saw most of what we wanted to see --

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  -- we had a list of far more than we could possibly see, so we kind of --

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  -- had to pick and choose a little bit.

A.111:  Had to cut, decide what you really wanted to once you got there.

B.112:  Yeah, and sometimes you wound up staying longer at one place than, than
another.

A.113:  Oh, well, that's fun.  I, um, I can get tickets, airline tickets, through
my brother, and, uh, he's a pilot, and so we take a few, but weekend type
jaunts to Chicago and different places around and that's fun, too.  That's a
good little vacation, they say.  You know, just a couple days getting away --

B.114:  Oh, sure.

A.115:  -- makes, means a lot.

B.116:  But if you don't like to fly, then [laughter].

A.117:  [Laughter] I don't, but I am getting better [laughter].  Used to be I'd,
I almost couldn't, you know, bring myself to stay on the plane, but, but now
I'm getting better [laughter].  So, uh, any other vacations you wanted to talk
about or,

B.118:  Well, uh, I, one place I haven't done is go somewhere like a cruise in, in
a --

A.119:  Oh.

B.120:  -- warm climate or, or down into a tropical place for a beach va-,
