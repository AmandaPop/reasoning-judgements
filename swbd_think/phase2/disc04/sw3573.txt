=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay well,

B.2:  There we are.

A.3:  All right. Um, um, well, uh, tell me about the car that you've got.

B.4:  [Throat_clearing] Well, I have a Honda, um, hatchback, nineteen
eighty-four.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And, uh, I'll be honest with you.  I have never found any automobile that
has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, uh, put together and it,
it does its job.  All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the
filter every thirty-five hundred miles, and I, I did have to put two, two new
front tires on at fifty thousand miles, but that car just purrs like the day
it was built.  I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twen-,
twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town.  It's a five speed straight
stick machine.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, I can carry more in that, uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than
I can in the big cars, and I have a large, um, Pontiac, and I have a
sixty-nine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old, but
it's in beautiful shape.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other
bigger cars.

A.13:  Well, that's very interesting.  I've had, I've had exactly the same
experience with the one that I've got.  It's a, and surprisingly it's also an
eighty-four --

B.14:  Oh, oh.

A.15:  -- [Throat_clearing] and, uh, 

B.16:  [Throat_clearing] L X?  

A.17:  [Throat_clearing]  Yeah, I'm still here.  Um, I'm sorry what?

B.18:  It was an L X?

A.19:  Yes, it's an L X, it's not a hatchback, but it's, um, it's, uh, 

B.20:  Uh-huh, yours is a four door.

A.21:  Four door, yeah --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and very, very comfortable car.  Big roomy trunk --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- uh, and, uh, and very happy with it, and I must admit it's, you know,
if, if, if, uh, my only consideration were, were, you know, buying another car
just to tool around town in and make, you know, brief trips and things like
that, I would very, very seriously consider buying one.  Uh, I think they're
extraordinarily reliable cars.

B.26:  Yes, they are.

A.27:  Um, my, my real concern with, uh, uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a
Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, um, trip down the road
about once a month, because I'm divorced and I have a daughter that lives down
in North Carolina --

B.28:  Um, uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and, uh, I drive, 

B.30:  [Cough]. 

A.31:  down Interstate Ninety-five, and it's just an absolutely wild highway.

B.32:  Ninety-five is wild in any car.  There's no doubt about that --

A.33:  Yeah and,

B.34:  -- because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to, I'm retiring the
end of this month --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.

A.37:  And, you, well, you've got it, and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car
with me [laughter], as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine
that, that, uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've
got my eye on, which is a Volvo.

B.38:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.39:  In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past, and --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- uh, I've, I've, they're expensive cars to keep up when they need
service, but, uh, [sniffing] I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.
Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person, and I always wind up
getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, need to
be taken care of, and so forth.  And I guess that's one thing that, that
recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that
you have to do under the hood, and, uh,

B.42:  Yes, it just, just sits there and purrs, and you, all you got to do is the
main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.  I get six hundred
miles on a tank of gas.

A.43:  Oh, I know.  It's really amazing.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  It's, uh, [laughter],

B.46:  Beautiful, beautiful machine.

A.47:  Absolutely, 

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  incredible [laughter].  So, um, yeah, anyway, I've been looking at the
prices of these cars and, and so forth, and I think that it's, it's very
surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less
money than you would think if you're --

B.50:  Is that right, uh-huh.

A.51:  -- willing to buy ones that are about, 

B.52:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.53:  the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and, um, 

B.56:  Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?

A.57:  Well, certainly some of the top end ones.  You can still get, get, uh, even
the, the low end wagons, um, for less than twenty thousand dollars --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and, uh, we get, you know, in the Washington area, of course, being as
affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here --

B.60:  Um, uh-huh.

A.61:  -- so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any
week, and I sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth
and --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- so, um, [sniffing] anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that
I've, I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.  I think
I've bought one or two new cars in my life, and I've tended to, um, to, uh,
buy cars that are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or
six years old.  This Honda that I have I bought used, and, in fact, it had an
extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.  I've just rolled seventy
thousand miles, and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.  So
[laughter].

B.64:  Well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach,
Virginia, where my mother lives, and things like that, and I drive it,
