========================================================================

A.1:  (( )) so I'm in the Richardson area.

B.2:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm out in, uh, North Dallas by the Galleria.

A.3:  Okay, good.

B.4:  All right.

A.5:  Doug, did you, did you hear our topic?

B.6:  Oh, capital punishment.

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  Yeah, uh,

A.9:  What do you, what do you, what do you feel about capital punishment?

@B.10:  Well, uh, I'm all for it in certain situations, and if it's a, you know, I
mean, just depends on how brutal, you know, you know, murder --

A.11:  Sure.

B.12:  -- you know, just something like, uh, you know, the guy, who'd they execute
you for few years ago.  I guess it was the, um, Ted Bundy, whatever, something
like that, you know, serial killer, you know, same thing ought to happen with,
um, the (( )) guy up in Milwaukee.  It just depends, um --

A.13:  Sure.

B.14:  -- you know, kind of an eye for an eye.  I think, uh, if they had more of
it instead of, you know, some of these people been on death row for fourteen,
fifteen years, be more of a deterrent.

A.15:  All the people we're feeding and --

B.16:  Right and,

A.17:  -- taking care of.  

B.18:  Probably also for, uh, drug, uh, peo-, uh, pushers and stuff.  People --

A.19:  Sure.

B.20:  -- something like that, you know.  It just depends, I, I mean,

A.21:  You know, I feel sort of the same way.  I, I think somewhere in the Middle
East, in one of those countries, if they catch you dealing in drugs, they cut
off your right hand --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- because that's the hand you use, I guess, to wipe your butt after you do
your job.

B.24:  Right, you (( )) somebody to castrate you.

A.25:  Right.  Then after they catch you doing, dealing, if they catch that same
person dealing in drugs again, then they whack, they take off his arm.  So,
you know, I bet they have a lot less problems with drug, with drugs over there
than we do here.

B.26:  Uh, definitely.  But I don't know, if you, I mean, it's, it would never
come to pass like out here, I mean, it's just --

A.27:  No, just, uh --

B.28:  -- that's, I mean, Middle East is,

A.29:  -- public's too sympathetic, but, you know.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  I don't know how old you are.  I'm, I'm, I'm fifty, but I go back to where
they were, used to hijack a lot of planes --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and things like that.  

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  You know, I used to, I had a good friend who was very vindictive in his
attitude, when he said, you know, best way to stop this is if they catch a
hijacker, the very next day they stand him up in front of a wall and they
shoot him.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  And just watch how many, after that happens two or three times as far as
execution wise, how many planes do you think will be hijacked.  And he's
exactly right.

B.38:  Oh, yeah.

A.39:  You know, he, a hijacker gets put in jail and, and, Lord knows what
happens.  He doesn't get any kind of a death penalty as far as punishment or
capital punishment, and we feed him and clothe him and give him a, probably,
probably put a T V, probably put a T V in his cell and everything else just 
to --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- take care of him, I guess.

B.42:  Probably living better in jail than he would be if he was out on the
streets or whatever --

A.43:  Oh, you bet.

B.44:  -- you know, because,

A.45:  I believe in capital punishment and I,

B.46:  I definitely agree.  It's just, you know, you just have some politicians
who'll never let something like that happen, and I mean --

A.47:  Oh, I know.

B.48:  -- it's just,

A.49:  I think our state, state, I believe State of Texas has capital punishment.

B.50:  Yeah, they do.

A.51:  And, you know, uh --

B.52:  (( )).

A.53:  -- and I think the, I think the punishment should fit the crime, or vice
versa, because you know, a rapist goes out and for that guy to walk free, if,
I mean, he deserves to be executed, as far as I'm concerned, if they get the
hard facts on him and he is guilty.  I mean, you know, this, these people,
there's, there's got to be a line drawn somewhere, and, uh, not that I'm that
hardened, cold and cruel, but there just appears, do you know, I listened to
the Chief of Police of Richardson talk about four or five years ago.  Do you
know, if a man goes out and commits robbery, not capital punishment, I mean,
not capital crime, but robbery, and he gets caught and gets sentenced to say
eight years, seven to ten or something like that --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- you know he gets five days credit for every day he serves.

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  Just like a bonus, for God's sake.

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  That's the damndest thing I've ever heard of.  You get five days credit, so
if you, if you, uh, get a sentence of five to seven, as far as time served, in
one year you're eligible for parole.

B.60:  Exactly, yeah.

A.61:  That's ridiculous.

B.62:  Yeah, there, I don't know, I mean, [laughter] there's just so many, there's
just so many problems are now, that, I mean, capital punishment is just icing
on the cake, it's, it's just, just at that point.  I mean, a per-, whoever's
done that, you know, killed someone, has probably done, that's got a, uh,
police (( )) probably mile long, you know --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- that led up to something like that.

A.65:  That's true.  I'm surprised there's not more vigilante cases, you know, I
really am.  And there's probably a, a lot more than we know about, because
they're never, they're never found out about.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  But, um, I totally agree.  It's just, you know, I, gol, I'm sure, you know,
pray to God, never hap-, that never has, if somebody killed a friend of mine,
or something, man you, the first thing you'd want to do is kill them.  I mean,
I --

A.69:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you love someone.

B.70:  -- yet you can't go out and, you know, and shoot someone but,

A.71:  Or, what if you're my age and your, your daughter was raped by someone and
you know who did it.

B.72:  Exactly.

A.73:  Oh, gosh, you know, that would be a tough time holding any father in his
right mind down.  Uh, just like, you don't like to think about things like
that --

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  -- but it's, uh, I'm in the, uh, the hunting type business.  I sell
firearms, so it's different, it's different for me, because I know a lot of
the product I sell goes for personal and, you know, in home protection,

B.76:  Uh-huh.
