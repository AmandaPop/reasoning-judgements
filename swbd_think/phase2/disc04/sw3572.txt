=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just
be the wide disparity in what's being offered.  I don't know what you've
experienced.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  Um, I agree, I think that our education system needs revamped, I,
and I think a lot of the ways they're going about it are not going to work.  I
don't think just shoveling more money into the education system is the answer.
Um, I know that here they keep saying, oh, we need more money and more money
and more money.  But I don't think, I don't think that's the answer.  I think
we need to take a different approach to how we go about it.  Um, are you
familiar at all with the voucher system?

A.3:  I've heard of it.

B.4:  Um, I'm in favor of that.  I think that, you know, every parent, I think if
we were given so much money in a voucher and we're able to choose which
schools to take our children to, I think that would put competition between
the schools and give the teachers some incentives to make, you know, to do a
better job and the principals to have their schools being better, and, and I
think it would put a lot of pressure that's needed on the education, uh,
folks, so that they would, you know, do better rather than just getting into
their jobs and getting their tenure and not having to put forth a lot.  I
don't know.  What do you think about that?

A.5:  Well, part of the deal is, uh, [throat_clearing] in addition to the public
schools there're all these other alternatives such as the private schools and
the religious schools and --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- the home schooling, and --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and some of these other options that, uh, that people are looking at
but, uh, to ensure that everyone has a chance, the public education system has
got to do the job.

B.10:  Right, right.  I know around here, um, the home school is an option.  The
only, the only private school, I think there's probably one, well, there may
be two private schools for the elementary age kids, and they are, you know,
down in Salt Lake.  So, for me that's not really an option.  Are there very
many private schools there in Dallas?

A.11:  Well, there're a number of them.  What happens is we have a number of
school districts, and those school districts that are considered quality
people stay in.  Those school districts that are not quality people who can
afford them opt out, and, and are going to the private schools or the schools
that are sponsored by, by the, one of the religions.

B.12:  Oh, uh-huh.  So, see then that does put a little bit more, um, pressure on
your public schools to perform.  What happens to those schools where nobody
wants to go to?

A.13:  Well, there's always people end up going to schools who can't afford to go
anywhere else --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- who end up still going to that particular school --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- and, and can't opt out because they don't have the money to --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- go to private schools.  Private schools here are very expensive.

B.20:  Oh, uh-huh.  And how about the religious?  Are they expensive or what?

A.21:  I, I don't know much about the religious schools.  About the only really
religious schools around here are the ones operated by the Catholic Church --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- but it seems that the private schools are, get the greater share of
people than the religious schools do.

B.24:  Oh, huh.  Does it, what do you think about the salaries that, uh,
education, um, that, that the teachers and, and such make.  How are they down
there?  Do the teachers --

A.25:  Well --

B.26:  -- feel pretty good about them, or are they?

A.27:  -- well, you know, salaries for teachers I think are low everywhere.  Most
teachers never end up making much money.

B.28:  No, no.

A.29:  If you're, if you're good in an area and are not dedicated you can make far
more money being in that area rather than teaching in that area.

B.30:  Do you have year around school?

A.31:  No.  Do you?

B.32:  Uh, they do, in this area.  

A.33:  Oh.

B.34:  My children don't go to it, but they were talking about starting it next
year, but there's quite a few schools around here that have the year around
school.  Um,

A.35:  They've been talking about that.  A few school districts are going to start
experimenting with that, but it hasn't really gotten going yet.

B.36:  Oh, oh.  I'm, I'm not sure I think that's the answer either [laughter].
Do, do a lot of the teachers there that teach during the, the winter months
then have summer jobs?

A.37:  Um, as far as I know they're doing something else, but I don't know --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- specifically, you know, what they are doing.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  Of course, if it interrupted it here, then it would mess up lots of sports
and camps and all the things that rely on that, you know --

B.42:  And,

A.43:  -- long vacation period.

B.44:  Right, yeah, that's kind of the situation here, because a lot of, there's a
lot of farming.  It's kind of a, we live in a farming and a fruit, you know,
area, and, and those, the older kids at least, when they get junior high and
high school age are needed to, to help out with those kind of jobs, and so
they don't do it with the junior high or the high school, uh, age kids.  It's
just done on the elementary basis so far here, but, I don't know, there's,
there's a lot of questions, a lot of concerns.  I think our education system,
um, is a good one, I really do, I think it, it, it's a,
