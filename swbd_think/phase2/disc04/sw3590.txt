A.1:  How the Mavericks doing?

B.2:  Oh, so-so [laughter].

A.3:  So-so?

B.4:  Yeah, they're not doing too good this year.  They're, they, they, think
they kind of started off with a rocket there at the beginning --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- not in the season, but, I mean, just when, uh, just in general --

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- just kind of come down to an even slump, and they're not doing too good
this year.

A.9:  Storey with Tarpley, is he, uh, is he history --

B.10:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.11:  -- #altogether?#

B.12:  Oh, yeah.

A.13:  That's the kind of uh, oh, a tough situation they're handling.

B.14:  Yeah, I'm kind of surprised that they, uh, that they, that they hung onto
him as long as they did.

A.15:  Really.

B.16:  Uh.

A.17:  They, they gave him every chance possible (( )).

B.18:  Oh, they gave him more than, more than, uh, more than I would have.

A.19:  Is that right?

B.20:  Oh, yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have put up with it after the second time.
I'd have said --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- get out of here.

A.23:  Uh, he's a talented player, but, uh, [breathing] I feel, I don't know, they
seem to get involved in those substance abuse problems, and it's a tough road
for them.

B.24:  Oh, I know it.  You follow, follow the Mavericks?

A.25:  Well, you know, because I follow the Jazz fairly closely, and --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- then, you know, we're in the same conference, and you know, keep tabs on
them a little bit.

B.28:  How's the Jazz doing this year?

A.29:  They're doing well.

B.30:  Are they?

A.31:  I, uh.  They're in the, in the head of the division and just won the last
two road games.  They beat, uh, Philadelphia tonight.  It was a close one,
beat them by two points --

B.32:  Well, #that's good.#

A.33:  -- #or three points#, but, yeah, they're doing, they're doing great, uh,
they had this little incident, I don't know if you heard about it, with, uh,
Carl, Carl Malone and Isaiah Thomas.

B.34:  Huh-uh.

A.35:  It was a, I guess they played last Friday here in Salt Lake, and about the
first two minutes of the game, Isaiah drove in and Malone went up to block the
shot and really fouled him hard.  So hard that it put him to the floor, and he
had like twenty stitches above his eye.

B.36:  Whoa.

A.37:  And, uh, they, in reviewing the tapes, decided it was a flagrant foul, oh I
guess they decided it was flagrant foul at the time of the ball game and
ejected Carl and then he got a, he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game
suspension, which is about another thirty-five thousand.

B.38:  No kidding.

A.39:  So it was a forty-five [laughter] thousand dollar deal for him, and I, I
believe it was unintentional.  He fouled him hard, but it wasn't like he had,
you know, malicious intent to go cream the guy.  So.

B.40:  My goodness.

A.41:  There's been a big buzz about that, how, how Detroit's the bad boys of the
league to begin with, and when something like that happens to one of their
players, they're all, all claiming that, uh, you know, it was totally 
uncalled for, this unnecessary violence when they've been guilty of that kind 
of thing for years.

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  Laimbeer and Rodman are about the two worst hatchet men in the league 
so,

B.44:  Yeah, that's for sure.

A.45:  Anyway.

B.46:  Yeah, I didn't even hear, I didn't even hear, but I haven't picked up a
paper probably, or a sports page in [noise] I venture to say in about a month
[laughter].

A.47:  Oh, is that right?

B.48:  Yeah, I haven't had a chance to.  So.

A.49:  You've, you've been busy, huh.

B.50:  Yeah, just been extremely busy.  But no, I didn't, I didn't even hear about
that.  I didn't even see it on the news.  So.  I must have missed that one
altogether.

A.51:  Yeah.  It was probably (( )) more local interest obviously but,

B.52:  No, something, something like that they usually, they'll usually, you know,
play that just about anywhere.

A.53:  Yeah, and everybody's interested in seeing the little, well, it's just the
nature of the human, I guess, to like to see a little violence [laughter] #I
think.#

B.54:  #Oh,# especially excessive violence --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- where somebody gets hurt especially.  Oh, it's just that, but we're ra-,
we're raised on that --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- everybody's raised on that --

A.59:  That's true.

B.60:  -- on the negatives of life, I guess.

A.61:  Well, I've had about enough of Magic Johnson for the year though.

B.62:  Oh, yeah.

A.63:  I guess where he's, uh, appears he's touring with the team, and Jabbar's
thinking of coming out of retirement to help fund the AIDS research, and, I
don't know.  You hear both those stories?

B.64:  Yeah I heard those.

A.65:  I guess that's a nice gesture on Jabbar's part.

B.66:  Yeah, might as well.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  It's going to take a lot of people to do that, though.  

A.69:  What do you,

B.70:  They, [laughter] it's going to take a lot of research.

A.71:  What do you think about that?  Do you think he got what he deserved, or
[laughter],

B.72:  You mean as far as Magic?  

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Well, I mean, you know, he, he got to pay to play as they say --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- yeah, but he's paying pretty hard.

A.77:  Yeah, I (( )) circus dancer but,

B.78:  Well, now, yeah, that's true.

A.79:  I guess maybe we'll, you know, some good come out because of this.  You
know, it's a notoriety and focus that'll land on the disease.

B.80:  Yeah, that's true.  He definitely, he definitely opened it up and showed a
different side of it.

A.81:  Yeah.  I don't know how the Lakers are going to do without him this year.
They, they're doing all right now, from what I see but,

B.82:  I don't think they'll hold together.

A.83:  Yeah, he's, uh, the, was the heart and soul of that group.

B.84:  I believe you're right.

A.85:  So.

B.86:  I believe you're right.

A.87:  Anyway.  What other teams you follow, any?

B.88:  No, that's about it.  I, I, I just read, I mean when it gets down to the
end, end of the season if the Mavericks are doing good, I'll stay up with
them but --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- yeah, I'm dedicated to a point --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- you know, just like I'm more dedicated in football I guess than
anything.

A.93:  Well, the Cowboys are a lot more popular, aren't they?

B.94:  Well, yeah, well, I was raised on the Cowboys, so.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  I mean, the Mavericks are.

A.97:  Well.

B.98:  I, I was raised with the old Dallas Chaparrals.

A.99:  Oh is that right?

B.100:  Yeah, that was years ago, though.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  That was, that was, uh, I guess the original pro team that, that they had
here.

A.103:  Yeah well,
