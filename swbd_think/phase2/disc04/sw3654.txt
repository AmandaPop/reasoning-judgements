=======================================================================

A.1:  Hi, uh, how do you feel about gun control.  

@B.2:  Oh, [breathing] I don't like a total ban on it.  But on the other hand I
don't like total idiots pulling what they did down in, uh, my home state of
Texas, down in, uh --

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  -- near Fort Hood.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  [Inhaling] Uh [breathing], I think the right of ownership needs to be
protected, but I don't think there's too much wrong with having it registered
and having you think about it a little bit.

A.7:  I don't think so either and I think that every gun should be covered,
cover, covered --

B.8:  Um.  

A.9:  -- because I think that, uh, and it doesn't hurt people to have a waiting
period.

B.10:  Well, they make us wait to get married in most states I know [laughter].

A.11:  Yes [laughter], right.  

B.12:  Unless you want to fly to Las Vegas or so.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  But,

B.16:  Uh, it's just sickening.  I was on the University of Texas campus when 
that --

A.17:  Kill, I,

B.18:  -- Chapman climbed the tower and killed twenty-two people.  One of my
friends was wounded.  He was from La Paz, Bolivia and they --

A.19:  Uh.  

B.20:  -- flew and got his mother here real quick, but, and a hippie pulled him
out of the, out of the additional gunshot range.  So ever since then, old
Oscar said hippies are okay, my buddy [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  It was back in the sixties, when Vietnam was going on so,

A.23:  Yes, I remember when that happened.  

B.24:  So, I've lived in New York City where they have a, uh, pistol control and,
uh, [breathing] big deal, you go across the county line into Yonkers and you
can buy a pistol and come back into the city.

A.25:  So there isn't really a gun control there.  

B.26:  Not really.  

A.27:  No.  

B.28:  Uh,

A.29:  Well, I, I think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- automatics and, and handguns because people need, if they're out after a
gun they need a cooling off period.  We have guns in our home, but my husband,
uh, used to hunt.  All my sons hunt.

B.32:  Um, I've got a shotgun and a pistol -- 

A.33:  Oh, we have,

B.34:  -- and the kids have BB -s [laughter].  

A.35:  [Laughter] Sometimes I think they're about as dangerous [breathing], but,
uh,

B.36:  Well, I'd shoot it more often it wasn't against the city ordinance.  Those
birds steal my dog's bird, dog food.

A.37:  [Laughter]. 

B.38:  My, I don't think that's fair.  

A.39:  Yeah.  Well we live close to the Wasatch, well, we live right on the
Wasatch front, so we're only about, well we have b-, mountains in our backyard
and --

B.40:  Um.  

A.41:  -- the deer come down and eat our, uh, shrubs during the winter.

B.42:  Do they really?  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  We, we had a snow storm the other day, and the deer come down and
eat the shrubs.  They keep them trimmed for us.

B.44:  We got the air-conditioning going in the building today.  

A.45:  Oh, my heck.  

B.46:  [Laughter]. 

A.47:  [Laughter]. 

B.48:  It must be seventy-five degrees out there.  

A.49:  I think it's about twenty, well, it's about twenty-eight here.

B.50:  I don't think that has anything to do with gun control.  

A.51:  No.  

B.52:  [Laughter]. 

A.53:  [Laughter]. 

B.54:  Uh,

A.55:  But, I, I, I,

B.56:  I, I don't think it's a cons-, well, so what if it's constitutional or not.
I-, i-, if my wife drives to west Texas alone, she's going to carry a gun, I
don't care what they say.

A.57:  Well, don't you think, too, if the government, I mean like in Yugoslavia
and these places that the government comes in and takes over, China, don't you
think if the people had a gun --

B.58:  Um.  

A.59:  -- they would have more say in, in, in establishing a democracy?

B.60:  Wasn't that amazing Yugoslavia was a semi-Soviet state and no guns were
allowed and all of a sudden everybody has one that wants to fight the war,
where did they come from?

A.61:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.62:  They were hidden under the bed all these years.  

A.63:  They must have been.  

B.64:  I don't know.  

A.65:  They must have been hidden somewhere, because they came out.

B.66:  Well [breathing], you know, one thing about the Killeen situation that was
pointed up is there were a lot of military people in the p-, in and around.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  Uh, if the military had been allowed to carry even side arms --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- they could have stopped this idiot quicker.  

A.71:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.72:  Uh, I had a cop once say in Texas it's not against the law, let's see, what
I say, I said it would be all right legally if I put on a side gun and walked
down the street with a gun strapped on my side, s-, clear view and you
couldn't arrest me.  He said, yes, I can arrest you.  I said what for?  He
said breaking the peace.  I said who's peace am a bothering.  He said mine,
I'm the cop.  That --

A.73:  Is that right?  

B.74:  -- that was a joke, it was a joke [laughter].  

A.75:  Oh [laughter].  

B.76:  But I think if you take them away from everybody, then only criminals will
have it and you would have more problems, but, but registration won't hurt
anybody, will it?

A.77:  No, that's what I think that it should be is registration and guns that can
be traced.

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  But then,

B.80:  You can go to pawnshop.  I don't, I don't know if you all live near big
city --

A.81:  No.  

B.82:  -- Salt Lake City if they've got them or not, but you go to a pawnshop 
and --

A.83:  #I think they have a,#

B.84:  -- #buy them for cash# and you don't have to show nothing.  

A.85:  And you just hand over the cash and that's it.  

B.86:  Yeah, you, if you can show them a driver's license, but you can steal those
so easily it's pitiful.

A.87:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm about an eight on that.  I think that, uh, that we need
gun control, but, you know, so many laws would be, uh, necessary if we'd just
use common sense.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  You know, just registering the guns and [breathing] I don't know, I guess
people lose their common sense when they, when they get mad or when they,

B.90:  Get too drunk.  

A.91:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#  

B.92:  #I'll be.# There's a law in Texas says you can't have them in bar.  I think
it would be a lot more sense if they say, please check them at the front door
because I know people are in there with them on.

A.93:  Oh, really?  

B.94:  Oh, yeah.  I, it just nerve racking to know that if you're in a,

A.95:  That you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you.  

B.96:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.97:  [Laughter]. 

B.98:  They're not supposed to, but then again, so,
