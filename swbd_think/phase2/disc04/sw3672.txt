=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, would you like to go first, or shall I [laughter].  #We have
different communities.#

@B.2:  #Well, as a science teacher,# I've been encouraging recycling for a long
time, and, uh, we collect things at school, such as foil and cans and glass to
a certain extent, uh, I coach an (( )) team, and we save everything.  The kids
at school bring some things in, but not as much as I'd like, and I have
recyclings bins at home --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, we've had a, uh, we've had a foil, which I think a lot of people
don't realize they could sell along with their, I mean, aluminum cans.

A.5:  I think that's true, yeah, and, and there are some areas I believe they
limit it.  They want you to just strictly go with the cans because of the
different content, but I think you're right.  The more often you can.

B.6:  Well, one of the women has this these big balls of foil competition thing
going, and I don't know where we're supposed to turn it in.  Another science
teacher at school is in charge of that, and got all the materials on it, but
we're saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room.

A.7:  That's great [laughter].

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  Do you have, um, curbside pickup in your community as well?

B.10:  Not yet, it, it is in some communities, but it isn't here, and it is
experimental in some areas at this point.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  They're trying it out and deciding what they're going to do with it.

A.13:  We just started it this year, and it's really nice to be able to have that
convenience as opposed to having to go to a local dump and, you know, take
your recyclables.  I know that I am much more motivated [laughter] where I
know that they will come pick it up, because there can be so much that you
load in your car --

B.14:  That's true.

A.15:  -- as opposed to, and I had to get,

B.16:  My husband gets irritated sometimes because of the, you know, about
recycling bins --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in
another, it, once it gets full, getting it loaded into the car and taking it
is a pain.

A.19:  Oh, it is, and it's dirty and [laughter],

B.20:  And, uh, sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans,
often times there's a long line, uh, you know, if it's one of those where you
get change for your cans.

A.21:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.22:  Now if it's just a donation type of thing, like at the library or some
places like that, sometimes people just dump their stuff right at the front,
they don't go to the back of the, like --

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  -- if it's a truck or whatever for paper --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- and then everything just, starts getting piled outside, which is a pain,
because that's not what's supposed to be happening.

A.27:  Right, it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were
more curbside recycling.

B.28:  I think so too, I, I am in hopes that that will be successful and that they
will decide to go ahead and, and spread it to our neighborhood as well.

A.29:  The one thing that they don't pick up, they actually don't care if we mix
together the aluminum and the bottles.  We put those all in one big bag, and
then put the paper goods separately, but the one thing they don't pick up are
the plastic goods, you know, um, those big milk tubs --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and that constitutes a big portion of our trash, so I always hope --

B.32:  That's true.

A.33:  -- at some point those things will either stop being manufactured or that
they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically.

B.34:  Some of them are recyclable, and I started trying to save those, but we
couldn't find a place to dump them.

A.35:  Right, yes.

B.36:  And so, we just had to throw them away.  Um,

A.37:  They say on the cans or on the, not the cans but the, uh, the containers in
fact that they are recyclable, but I've, I'm the same with you, I haven't been
able to, at least convenience, probably outside the city limits or something
[laughter].

B.38:  Well, I think, I was talking to someone who lives really almost on the
other side of town, said she knew of one place where you could go, and so once
a month they made this trek with all their recyclables, but they also have a
pickup, uh, and they would take everything.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  But that, is, used to be such a pain,

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  and it's so far away from us, and that's the only one she knew of.

A.43:  You have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a
point.

B.44:  So I guess what we decided is, that we're doing our part by recycling
three, and going out of our ar-, way, but to have to go clear across town to
do plastic.

A.45:  Yeah, well, the fact that you're doing it at school with, with the kids is
a great idea, too, because then they're also encouraged to learn about how to
do that.

B.46:  And there's a, a little booklet called, uh, FIFTY THIN-, FIFTY WAYS YOU CAN
SAVE YOUR,

A.47:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.48:  Have you read that?

A.49:  I like that, yes, uh-huh.

B.50:  Yes.  Well, I read some of those to the kids from time to time, so that
they get some of the ideas from that but they are a lot more into recycling
than they used to be.  Um,

A.51:  Uh-huh, the children?

B.52:  The, uh, children, uh-huh, because,

A.53:  (( )) the kids that you teach?

B.54:  I teach Middle School.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And it's, uh, surprising.  Some of them aren't, but that probably goes
right into their families.  But there are even groups of parents that, uh, a
Recycling Coalition type deal where they're really making speeches to the P T
A and the Dad's Club and everything, trying to get more parents involved.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  So, it's, uh --

A.59:  That's great.

B.60:  -- it, it's on its way, if we could get more support through the public
utilities.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  I think when the government, the local or the state government, 
(( )) to support it and more happens, I know that in our hos-, I work in a
hospital as a therapist, and just about three years ago, when we started
recycling everything, um, they not only recognized that they could save money
with all,
