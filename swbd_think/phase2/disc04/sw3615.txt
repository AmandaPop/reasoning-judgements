REMARKS:        Children behind Speaker A.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any children?

B.2:  Yeah, I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen.

A.3:  Twelve and sixteen.

B.4:  Uh-huh, how about you?

A.5:  Well, I have three, and, uh, they're five and three and nineteen months.

B.6:  Oh.  

A.7:  So we kind of got different ball game but, uh.

B.8:  Right [laughter].

A.9:  [Throat_clearing] What, uh, do you feel like you have any time, 

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  to spend with them?

B.12:  Well.

A.13:  They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with
their parents.

B.14:  That's true [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter].

B.16:  You actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older, but
it's, of course, still really important.

A.17:  Right. 

B.18:  I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen
year old.  Um, I work two nights a week at a, I'm a librarian --

A.19:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.  They
keep it open, you know, for kids to do their work --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- and he, um, and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know,
to work --

A.23:  Sure.

B.24:  -- for me.  Well, my son is my aide.

A.25:  Oh, well, that's nice.

B.26:  [Laughter] So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together --

A.27:  You're stuck together.

B.28:  -- and there's usually not very much business.

A.29:  No.

B.30:  I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.  So.

A.31:  I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.

B.32:  So we, I have sort of a captive audience, so I really do spend probably
more time with him than, than most, you know.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.  But his
dad's at home --

A.35:  And so that --

B.36:  -- pretty much that time.

A.37:  -- kind of gives him, uh, time with his dad, then.

B.38:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.

A.39:  Gives him a little bit of that individual time.

B.40:  But, but it is hard, once they get that age, I mean, their friends are the
most important thing there is.

A.41:  Right, and they want to be able to spend, uh.

B.42:  That's right.

A.43:  Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old.  She started
kindergarten this year, and --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- every day that she's not at school, uh, she thinks we need to have
someone over and play --

B.46:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.47:  -- [Laughter] and that kind of -- 

B.48:  Yeah, #it's kind of hard.#

A.49:  -- #yeah, it's hard,# I think, uh, I find myself getting my little projects
going and not taking the time that I should [laughter].

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  I'm more worried about, Oh, I didn't this done, I didn't get, the kitchen
needs to be cleaned --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- this needs to be done, and --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and I need to re-, remind myself to slow down and --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- it'll still be there tomorrow.  

B.58:  Yeah, that's true.

A.59:  But that's kind of hard to do, you know.

B.60:  Yes, it is hard to do, right, yeah.

A.61:  You don't see yourself getting.

B.62:  Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or
neat --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- or, you know --

A.65:  Right.

B.66:  -- then I think it, it is hard.  It's, um, I think one of the nice things
about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend
more time --

A.67:  Slow down a little bit.

B.68:  -- yeah, with family.  We have, we often go to Illinois --

A.69:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.70:  -- for Christmas, and we're not this year, and it's just really nice
because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.

A.71:  You can do, uh, more than --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- than when you travel.  

B.74:  Yeah, that's right.

A.75:  This is the first year we're staying home, too, and, uh, [throat_clearing]
I think it's going to be real quiet but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out
the games and,

B.76:  Yeah, right.  See, we usually do that, my, my kids even have already gotten
out, um, my twelve year old got out the Legos --

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  -- which of course he hasn't touched since last summer --

A.79:  Of co-, of course.

B.80:  -- but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those
technic, those hard kind, you know, and he wants to be an engineer, so he
still likes --

A.81:  Oh, yeah.

B.82:  -- all that kind of building stuff and, um, we have the train, and we
haven't had that Lego train together for years, and, um, so he sat down, and I
told him I really wanted him to build the train, and we would put it under the
tree, and that I would keep it together, I wouldn't take it apart --

A.83:  Wouldn't take it apart after that.

B.84:  -- yeah, and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.

A.85:  That'd be kind of fun.

B.86:  And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school
[laughter] was out on Friday, and, um, then his sixteen year old brother
started helping, too, you know.

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race --

A.89:  Right, right.

B.90:  -- those kinds of things never happen --

A.91:  No --

B.92:  -- but.

A.93:  -- no.  In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the 
T V -s and --

B.94:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.95:  -- I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication --

B.96:  Yes, yeah.

A.97:  -- and the communication --

B.98:  Which is,

A.99:  -- that would take place in a family, usually people are not sitting in
front of that.

B.100:  Uh-huh, and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare
at it, [laughter] you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.
The rest of.

A.101:  Yes, and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?

B.102:  No [laughter].  That's right.

A.103:  Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well, I shouldn't say
I could not, but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the
way through without --

B.104:  Yeah, yeah, me too.

A.105:  -- doing something.

B.106:  [Laughter] Yeah, I don't watch very much of it at all, e-, to, to the
extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that --

A.107:  Because they talk so much, isn't that the,

B.108:  -- yeah, they talk about T V shows, and I, huh, you know, how can you watch
that, you know --

A.109:  You're kind of like, what are you talking about and, uh,

B.110:  -- [Laughter]  it's the best show on, I don't know. 

A.111:  You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.

B.112:  [Laughter].

A.113:  They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us 
what's,
