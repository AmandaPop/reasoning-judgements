=======================================================================

B.1:  All right.

A.2:  So what was the last car repair that you had done on your car?

@B.3:  Well, we have two cars, and on our little Honda we had to replace some C V
joints.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  And on our bigger car, it's a Chevrolet, we had to repair the [lipsmack]
control module [laughter].

A.6:  The control module, a --

B.7:  Yeah, yeah.

A.8:  -- mystery box, huh. 

B.9:  Yeah, yeah, right, so we've had just recently a couple of things.  The C V
joints my husband just did himself, and [baby_talking] I'm glad he can do
that, because that saves us lots --

A.10:  That's --

B.11:  -- lots of money.

A.12:  -- that's impressive he's able to do a job like that, because that requires
special tools.

B.13:  Yes, he does, and he's lucky in that way, too, because his, his dad lives
real close, and he has a lot of the tools --

A.14:  Oh, that's interesting.

B.15:  -- uh, so he's able to do quite a few things like that --

A.16:  That, that's great.  

B.17:  -- and saves quite a --

A.18:  What --

B.19:  -- bit of money.

A.20:  -- what kind of jobs would you folks repair, re-, refer to a garage?

B.21:  Um, well, we had to have the, the Chevrolet had to be repa-, done by a
repair man, the, you know, the control module, and even though that, that
still hasn't been taken of in fact.  We were driving along the other night,
and the engine light came back on, but --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- the man wouldn't, the repair man when he fixed it said that it looked
like, um, the computer panel or, or the whatever it was needed to be replaced
also, and we didn't have it done at the time.  So it looks like we'll need to
go back in and have that done.

A.24:  Wow.

B.25:  So how about yourself?

A.26:  Well, um, the last thing that I had to have done to my car, uh, I
[baby_talking] wound up doing myself, and, um, that was, uh, tuning it up --

B.27:  Oh.

A.28:  -- and, um, I had been having a, a problem where I would be driving along
and, and I would notice this at night when I'd be sitting at a light, I would
see smoke in my, uh --

B.29:  Oh, wow.

A.30:  -- my headlights.

B.31:  Oh.

A.32:  And, uh, then later on, when, you know, I'd, I'd get out wherever I was
going --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- I would smell, uh, something had been burning --

B.35:  Oh.

A.36:  -- and I had pretty much figured it was oil, because I had looked under the
hood a couple of times --

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  -- and there was a, a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should
have on a Honda --

B.39:  Oh.

A.40:  -- which I ironically have, too. 

B.41:  Huh, uh-huh.

A.42:  [Throat_clearing]  You'd expect the car to be really clean inside --

B.43:  Right.

A.44:  -- and it run real well, real well, and so anyway, I, I had been thinking
about it for a long time and discovered that, um, uh, I had decided that what
had happened is there's a, a, a little piece of metal that sits over the top
of the valve train --

B.45:  Uh-huh.

A.46:  -- called the valve, uh, uh, cover --

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  -- and, uh, I decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or
perhaps the whole cover itself hadn't been, uh, tightened down well, or --

B.49:  Oh. 

A.50:  -- whatever, and so, when I was doing this tune up I decided it was time
for me to explore --

B.51:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.52:  -- and sure enough that's what the problem was.

B.53:  My word.  Huh.

A.54:  And so I went out and I got a new gasket and slipped it in there --

B.55:  Oh.

A.56:  -- on, on older cars up to, I, I, in fact I have no idea when they started
doing this, but --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like
material --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material.

B.61:  Oh.

A.62:  So, uh,

B.63:  Oh, so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself?

A.64:  Yeah, up to a certain point.  I used to do a lot more of it when I was
younger than I do now.  Um, and I have --

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  -- to admit that when the weather starts to get cold, 

B.67:  [Laughter].

A.68:  there's just no fun like a busted knuckle.

B.69:  Right [laughter].

A.70:  I just, uh, I just can't even tell you the joy I get from that experience
and,

B.71:  Oh, that's what my husband says, too.  He says, when you have the right
tools and a good place to do it in, it's enjoyable and he really likes to be
able to, to do it.  But when you don't have the right tools and you're out in
the weather, it's no fun at all.

A.72:  Sure.  And my finances have always been a little precarious, so --

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  -- sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity.

B.75:  Right, right.

A.76:  Um, but it's the, the down side of that is that I very rarely always had
the right tools, and --

B.77:  Oh --

A.78:  -- right.

B.79:  -- because, yeah, you can't afford to buy them.

A.80:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's a sort of a Catch Twenty-two.

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  If you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the
work, then you can --

B.83:  Right.

A.84:  -- generally have somebody else do it for you.  So.

B.85:  Uh-huh.  So have you found, um, one certain type of car needs less repair
work than another?

A.86:  Well, uh --

B.87:  Have you had that many different cars or,

A.88:  -- it's funny, I've, I've owned a lot of different cars.  I started out
with Volkswagons, and then, um, graduated to, um, a Honda --

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  -- and had that for a long time --

B.91:  Uh-huh.

A.92:  -- and then graduated to a Volvo, and then wound up with a Honda again.

B.93:  Oh.

A.94:  And so I've, I've [throat_clearing] had them all, and, and, uh, uh, have
gotten to know the engines in each one of these, uh --

B.95:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.96:  -- sorts of vehicles, and, but, uh, I, in the Volkswagon business, I, I
went from, you know, owning a bug to owning, uh, one of their cars called a
Rabbit --

B.97:  Oh, yes, uh-huh.

A.98:  -- and, the, and there was a completely different kind of engine in the
Rabbit, um --

B.99:  Oh.

A.100:  -- but I, I actually rebuilt a Volkswagon bug engine at one point --

B.101:  Oh.

A.102:  -- and, uh, so I learned an awful lot about cars --

B.103:  Boy, I'll say --

A.104:  -- that way and,

B.105:  -- I'll say.  Well, we, I don't know, we're a little bit partial.  Our
Honda, we have got a hundred and,
