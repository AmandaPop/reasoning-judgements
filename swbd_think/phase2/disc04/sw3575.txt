============================================================================

B.1:  What do you do to exercise?

A.2:  Well, I, um, do aerobics.  And I have a tape, and I play it just about
every other day, and I, and it's twenty minutes of exercise.

B.3:  Which, which, who is it?

A.4:  Denise is her name.

B.5:  Oh.

A.6:  Denise Austin.

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  She's kind of off the wall person, I guess, but she's really good.

B.9:  You do it at home?

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  By yourself?

A.12:  Yes.  What do you do?

B.13:  I, I, I'm on the sixty-eighth floor, and I walk down stairs.

A.14:  You walk down the stairs?

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  How many floors?

B.17:  Sixty-eight.

A.18:  How about, do you walk up the stairs?

B.19:  Well, my doctor told me to start walking up the stairs, too.  [laughter]
I've got bad knees, and he said it would, it would, uh, do that, I, I, I enjoy
going down, but this going up, and I'm going up about fifteen flights now.

A.20:  Yeah, yeah.

B.21:  But, uh.  Yeah, I, I just started going up.

A.22:  Yeah.  Well, I worked in a building that was, and I worked on the eighth,
eighth floor --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- or tenth, I can't remember.  Anyway, I walked up the stairs every day,
but like three times a day.

B.25:  Well, that's really, I think it's great for you.  And you just got to get
there.  It's not so-, for me, it's not so much of a chore.

A.26:  Well, I don't think I could walk up sixty-eight flights of stairs
[laughter].

B.27:  Well, they have that vertical marathon, in, uh, I think it's in March,
where they do go up the stairs of this building.

A.28:  That building is sixty-eight floors. 

B.29:  No, it's seventy-one.

A.30:  Oh, I didn't know that.

B.31:  But we're on the sixty-eighth floor.

A.32:  Gee.

B.33:  And, uh, and so they have a vertical marathon.  They have a race, and they
have people that can wa-, go up sixty-eight, or what, seventy-one flights as
quickly as I can go down them.

A.34:  Golly.

B.35:  And I go at a pretty good clip going down.

A.36:  Well, do you do anything outside in the summertime?

B.37:  I run.  I do a lot of races, uh --

A.38:  Oh.

B.39:  -- you know, the, and usually just the five K -s.  Uh, I hope to do the
capital ten thousand this spring, though.

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  I haven't done a ten K in a couple of years, but --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- but, uh.  I like to run.  I just don't like being outside in the win-, I
don't like --

A.44:  The wind.

B.45:  -- yeah --

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  -- the cold, and, I just,

A.48:  Well, in the summer time I love to bicycle.  I love, I take --

B.49:  Oh.

A.50:  -- my bicycle to White Rock Lake.  I ride around the lake.  I love it.

B.51:  I want to start riding around there.  I don't have a bicycle but, but, uh,
I wouldn't mind that.

A.52:  I have a, b-, I have a bad foot, so whenever I, I'm on my foot a lot it
starts hurting me, so I can't do much on my feet.

B.53:  How do you do aerobics?

A.54:  I do, I make sure that my foot is flat on the floor --

B.55:  Uh-huh.

A.56:  -- when I bring it down.  I just can't do anything on my toes, because I
hurt my foot.  So, I just, I do the best I can.

B.57:  That's kind of,

A.58:  I just have to make sure that foot, that heel is down flat.

B.59:  That's why I don't do aerobics, is it's too iffy for the knees.

A.60:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.61:  And, uh --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- and I've got, that's, that's been my worse problem is the knee injury.

A.64:  But I think that, uh, 

B.65:  [Breathing].

A.66:  exercise, I think everyone needs exercise.

B.67:  Oh, yeah, if I didn't, if I didn't do this, I, uh, [laughter], we've got a
woman in our office that weighs three hundred pounds.

A.68:  You, right, right.

B.69:  And she can't walk, she can't do things that, she can't do the things that
you would just do, not even think about doing, like walk couple of blocks down
the street to go to the store.

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  We were going to go to the West End for lunch, and she said, No, I can't
walk that far.

A.72:  Oh.

B.73:  It's three blocks.

A.74:  I couldn't handle that.

B.75:  Yeah.

A.76:  And I, I have to keep my weight down because I feel so much better when I
do.

B.77:  I ju-, I feel better knowing that I can do what I, I can do what I want to
do, and not be, uh, worn out or sore or, you know, I, I don't want to run a
marathon but,

A.78:  Right, I just want to feel good.

B.79:  Yeah.

A.80:  I just feel good whenever I exercise, feel so much better.  I'm getting
ready to go skiing.

B.81:  [Laughter] What are you doing to train for that, just more aerobics?

A.82:  [Laughter]  Yes.

B.83:  That, that's the major reason I'm walking up the stairs.

A.84:  [Laughter]  To go skiing?

B.85:  Uh-huh, my doctor said, You've really got to strengthen the quadriceps
before you can, then he told me to do squats --

A.86:  Uh-huh, right.

B.87:  -- squat on the wall.

A.88:  Right, right.

B.89:  You know, just sit, he goes, Just sit back here and do this for a minute.
And I sat down and did it for about twenty seconds and said [noise].

A.90:  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I've been doing, but I'm not, I haven't been too
faithful.  I, I've been working too much lately.  I've been doing those
Christmas light tours at night.  So.

B.91:  Ooh.

A.92:  I'm just, I'm just kind of worn out.  I haven't had time to exercise like I
should.

B.93:  When are you going skiing?

A.94:  Next week, after Christmas.

B.95:  [Laughter].

A.96:  [Laughter]  So, I'm going to go anyway, whether I'm up to it or not.

B.97:  Well,
