============================================================================

A.1:  This is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is the first year, um,
I purchased, I mean, I, I was actually able to, uh, get some credit cards --

B.2:  Oh.

A.3:  -- because I'm twenty-one --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and I got it through school, uh, and I, I've kind of, you know, you kind
of make a purchase, and you, and you forget, you know, what you put on your
credit card, and, you know, within a month, you know, they send you a bill,
and, uh, I'm about three thousand dollars in debt right now.

B.6:  Oh, dear [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  It can add up in a hurry.

A.9:  Yeah, they do.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  I mean, it's amazing, it's like a, an, an illness or a sickness or
something.

B.12:  Well, it's, uh, easy to use, there's no doubt about them.  I've had, I've
had one for, oh, probably ten years now, and if you can, if you pay it off
every month --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- generally you're okay.  Um, our experience has been that we usually pay
it off each month, but around Christmas time, we sometimes have to slide a
month or, a month or so.

A.15:  Yeah, Christmas time.

B.16:  (( )).

A.17:  I can understand, but what my, after I got one, I didn't just stop.  I got,
I've got about five.

B.18:  Oh, uh-huh, they'll send --

A.19:  Six --

B.20:  -- you one about every time you turn around.

A.21:  -- six credit cards, yeah, and, uh, so I just charged a little on each
[laughter].  And, uh, [laughter] and you just get the, um, the adding machine
out and you add it up, and it's, it's amazing.

B.22:  Well, you see these people that cut there's up --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- say it's time to.

A.25:  We went to, we went on vacation, and, uh, and I charged a lot, you know,
just, well, I charged, um, like clothes for the vacation --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and then on the vacation, you know --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- charged our hotel --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- and then, you know, when you go out to eat, you charge [laughter] food,
I mean, you know --

B.32:  (( )).

A.33:  -- it's so convenient, and you just don't, I guess I'm just really stupid,
I just --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- didn't realize.

B.36:  Well, I like them for a couple of aspects.  One is you don't have to carry
a lot of cash with you.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  And the other is, you know, you got that statement, and you can make one
payment, you don't have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for
things.  It's convenient from that standpoint.  So, it's, it's nice from that,
from that angle.  But it can get out of hand, and the interest rate on them is
quite high generally.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  There are some that are lower, you know, you can get some that are, oh,
probably around twelve, thirteen percent, but most are around sixteen to
eighteen --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- or higher.

A.43:  Yeah, I have a friend that, um, she's married, and her and her husband, uh,
she said, you know, they tried really hard to pay them off, and it took them
three years before they were able to, uh, pay off their credit cards.

B.44:  Yeah, although, you know, they keep increasing your limit, too.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  You know, I had a card that, uh, well, I think it started out with like a
fifteen hundred dollar limit, and I've had it for several years, and I think
I'm now up to, uh, seven thousand five hundred on it.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I mean, I'm not, course I don't spend that much, but that's what they'd let
me spend if I wanted to.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I guess they, they get to trusting you a little bit, I want to hold that
bait out.  I don't know if the card companies that you use, around Christmas
time they'll send you a little group of checks.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Say, instead of using your credit card, if you want to, just go ahead and
write these checks and we'll charge, it'll go right against your account.
They --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- try to induce you during the Christmas season to --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- wrack up a few more dollars.  So.  I think they're good, but you've got
to be careful.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  (( )).

A.59:  I think it was hard for me because I wasn't working at the time --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and I was just going to school, and, like every weekend I would just, it
was just (( )) and go out and just --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- spend, uh, but,

B.64:  Well, [inhaling] I don't know.  Everybody likes them, at least for a couple
of things they're, they're handy.  They're nice on when you travel.

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  What kind do you have?

A.67:  Um, I have a Discover --

B.68:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and a Visa --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- a Sears, and I have like most of the department stores.

B.72:  Yeah, well, like the Discover one is supposed to pay you back a little bit.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Have you experienced that or not?

A.75:  I have, um, I have maxed that one [laughter].

B.76:  (( )) have you.  Well, I've heard, I think that one's sponsored by Sears if
I, 

A.77:  Yeah, it is, and I got the Sears through the Discover, before I had, um,
and I didn't even know, I went over my limit.  I mean, that's, I just didn't
even add it up.  I don't know.

B.78:  Oh, yeah.

A.79:  I was just going crazy.

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter].

B.82:  Well.

A.83:  And there's about fourteen hundred dollars on that card.

B.84:  Uh-huh.  Well it c-, it doesn't take long.  I just ordered a video camera
yesterday, and that's why it always bothers me a little bit to give your
credit card number over the telephone.

A.85:  Uh-huh. I wouldn't do that.  I would not do that.  I've seen on T V.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  There's too many scams.

B.88:  There can be, there's no doubt about it.  We've,
