==========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of home, is yours pretty similar to the ones around you or,

B.2:  Well, I think so.  

A.3:  Is it?  

B.4:  I mean, we live in a neighborhood where, you know, the, none of the homes
are exact-, exactly alike.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Our home's a two story home.  

A.7:  Oh.  

B.8:  And there's about half and half in our neighborhood that are ramblers, that
are two --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- stories.  

A.11:  Is yours a split entry?  

B.12:  No, no -- 

A.13:  No, it's a,

B.14:  -- it's just a, it's a regular two story.  All the bedrooms are upstairs
and the --

A.15:  Oh. 

B.16:  -- and everything else is downstairs.  

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  The basement is unfinished.  Now you, you live in Mantua, don't you?

A.19:  Right, yes.  

B.20:  Oh. 

A.21:  Uh, we live in a, ours is a little rambler.  It's, uh, ours, the street is
fairly new.  In fact, we were the very first home on the street and we've
lived here almost nine years.

B.22:  Oh, is that right?  

A.23:  Yes, and so we were, we were the first one and, uh, and we don't have a
garage or, and the, and the basement is not finished.  In fact, we're just
trying to review our options right now and decide whether we want to finish
the basement and add on a garage or whether we're going to find something else
or,

B.24:  Oh. 

A.25:  Gee, we're just growing out of it [laughter].  

B.26:  Did you build the house?  

A.27:  Yes.  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  Yes, we did.  It, it was new and, uh, there's a variety of, of homes along
our street.  In fact, next door to us is a log cabin home.

B.30:  Oh, really?  

A.31:  Yes, and it's, it's just beautiful inside.  It's,

B.32:  Do you like it?  

A.33:  I do, but if -- 

B.34:  Uh,

A.35:  -- I think if I had a log cabin, I'd want it to be a cabin type home rather
than a,

B.36:  Oh.  

A.37:  [Laughter]. 

B.38:  Rather than your personal residence.  

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  Something,

A.41:  Rather than something I went to every day and I, and I would want it on a
different setting than, you know --

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- a row of houses.  It, it's beautiful inside, but it, to me, it looks
just a bit out of place.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  We've got a person that wants to build a log cabin in this neighborhood 
and --

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  -- we have some, uh, protective covenants -- 

A.49:  Oh, yes.  

B.50:  -- and they've really got into kind of some, well, it's kind of been a
messy situation.  It's --

A.51:  Oh. 

B.52:  -- actually gotten down to lawsuits and these are -- 

A.53:  Oh, has it?  

B.54:  -- people that are, you know, in, [breathing] -- 

A.55:  Oh. 

B.56:  -- see each other every Sunday at church and -- 

A.57:  Oh, dear.  

B.58:  -- then they're suing each other.  It's not,

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  it's not a good situation.  

A.61:  Oh, dear.  W-, now why did they want to build a log, they just, that's 
what --

B.62:  Well, it's -- 

A.63:  -- they prefer, huh.  

B.64:  -- it's a, a single gal that, uh -- 

A.65:  Oh. 

B.66:  -- well, she's divorced and, uh, think they have, they're pretty act-, uh,
good price per square foot.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And, uh, think she's thinking that would be a good economical way to get a,
get the home that she likes at,

A.69:  Oh. 

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  Oh, that's, yeah, because apparently they save quite a bit when you put
them together from the kit or --

B.72:  Yeah, I, I'm -- 

A.73:  -- or however they come. 

B.74:  -- not sure.  Well, it's, it's been a really c-, a controversy.

A.75:  Oh, dear, so is she going to be able to build, to build it, do you think?

B.76:  Not so far, no, because the --  

A.77:  Not so far.  

B.78:  -- the restrictive covenants provide to the, one of the, uh, covenants is,
uh, curiously enough, uh, that it has to be in harmony with the existing
structures.

A.79:  Oh. 

B.80:  So, when the, you know, when the copy (( )) -- 

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  -- it doesn't look like the other homes.  It kind,

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  That's one thing that I noticed that has to occur in our neighborhood.

A.85:  Huh, well, that is interesting.  

B.86:  We have to have, uh, a lot of, uh, if you don't have, uh, brick on it, for
example --

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- they're a little bit hard on you.  

A.89:  Oh. 

B.90:  Like -- 

A.91:  Yeah. 

B.92:  -- you have a certain amount brick and a certain amount, uh, some other
material siding, or --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  -- #stucco.#

A.95:  #Does it have# to be, uh, a certain square footage or a certain price?

B.96:  Uh [breathing], I think there is a minimum square footage.   

A.97:  Is there?  

B.98:  I'm not sure what it is.  

A.99:  Oh.  We've, we've been looking around at different pieces of land and --

B.100:  Oh. 

A.101:  -- have found a, a couple that, that have the minimum square footage --

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  -- you know, requirement, but, uh, huh, that's interesting that the other
houses along our road are, like you say, some are ramblers and some are the
two story so,

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  But ours, ours is the smallest one on the road [laughter].  So,

B.106:  Ours is, you know, our subdivision is really only about seventy homes.

A.107:  Oh. 

B.108:  And, uh, our street is, uh, the nicest homes are on our street.  I will say
that.

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  Not, uh, being boastful, but I think -- 

A.111:  Yeah.  

B.112:  -- our street does have the nicer homes.  

A.113:  Well, that's good.  

B.114:  We border, uh, well, just on the other side, the houses across our s-, uh,
from ours are the, probably the nicer homes --

A.115:  Oh. 

B.116:  -- because they border on the golf course -- 

A.117:  Oh. 

B.118:  -- and they have a creek that runs through their backyard.  

A.119:  Oh, that's nice.  

B.120:  Yeah, but, uh,

A.121:  That is nice.  Now, did you build, you built yours?  

B.122:  Uh-huh, yeah.  We've been in it six years.  

A.123:  Oh.

B.124:  And, uh,

A.125:  Oh, did you do the contracting yourself or did you hire a contractor 
or,

B.126:  We had a contractor come and do that.  Uh,

A.127:  Oh. 

B.128:  I really don't know much about home construction.  I, well, I know a little
bit.  I did a little bit of work in s-, in summer sometimes just doing some
framing, but --

A.129:  Uh-huh.  

B.130:  -- I don't know, when you got a full time job and a family, you really
don't have --

A.131:  That's right, it takes -- 

B.132:  -- the time.  

A.133:  -- it takes, did you finish your basement yourself or,

B.134:  No, I haven't finished it yet.  

A.135:  Oh, you haven't finished it?  

B.136:  But see, our upstairs has four bedrooms.  

A.137:  Oh, you don't need it, yet, then, do you?  

B.138:  And we, we really haven't had occasion to --  

A.139:  To need it.

B.140:  -- to need it so,
