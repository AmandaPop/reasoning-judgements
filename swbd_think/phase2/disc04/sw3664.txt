A.1:  What you do h-, what do you think of your news coverage and where do you
get most of it?

@B.2:  Uh, usually, uh, either T V or radio.  

A.3:  Oh, oh.  

B.4:  It, it seems like.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  S-, uh, we get the weekend paper, but, uh, even then it just seems that
sometimes you're so busy you don't want to take an hour or so to sit down
[laughter] and read the paper [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  So it's so much quicker just to, you know, hear it on the radio or watch T
V.

A.9:  Yes.  We don't go to bed at night usually until we've seen the news at ten.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  So that's probably, well, we do take a daily paper, too.  

B.12:  Oh, you do, uh-huh.  

A.13:  Uh-huh, but it's out of Ogden and so it is not very, you know, it's not
probably as big as yours.

B.14:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.15:  But sometimes I wonder about the newspaper coverages, too, anyway.

B.16:  Oh, yeah.  

A.17:  Because I've known stories that have happened and then read it in the paper
and it hasn't been all that accurate.

B.18:  Not quite the same?  

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  And a lot of times when you have two different, uh, papers, you get two
different stories [laughter].

A.23:  That's true, although I think that's the same on T V, too.  

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  You know, you'll get one, you know, one day and one the next day on the
same thing and --

B.26:  Right.  

A.27:  -- so,

B.28:  [Beep]. 

A.29:  But I,

B.30:  Oh, excuse me.  

A.31:  I enjoy, I enjoy the news.  I like to keep up on whatever's happening.

B.32:  Oh, I do, too.  

A.33:  So,

B.34:  It's just, it's so much easier just to, you know, listen to the radio in
your car it seems like.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  Or just to sit down for a short while and watch the news than it is to sit
down and, you know, I mean I'll read periodicals and stuff, too, but, uh,
usually those come out after the fact and, course they give you more
information, so if you want that, then that's fine [laughter].

A.37:  Yeah, well, I think sometimes, you know, you'll hear it on T V and you
want, want to go into it deeper.  You, uh, you --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- can get it in a mag-, or a paper.  

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  A newspaper.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  And then on the radio, you know, they usually, uh, give the news every
hour.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  And so I, I like that, too, especially when we're traveling. 

B.46:  Right.  

A.47:  So,

B.48:  Yeah, I know that when I'm on vacation, I am, like, seems like I am totally
out of it [laughter].  I don't know what's going on and I don't really care
[laughter].

A.49:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's true, too.  

B.50:  It's kind of nice to get away from it all [laughter].  

A.51:  Yeah, uh-huh.  But, you know, if there's a story that you're particularly
interested in, it's good to, to be able to follow up on it.

B.52:  Right.  

A.53:  You know so, 

B.54:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.55:  But, uh, we have a, a news station, too, that is, uh, K S L out of Salt
Lake that covers just, it's a talk show and there's news almost constantly on
it.

B.56:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.57:  And then C N N has news constantly, too.  

B.58:  Right, right.  

A.59:  So, do you have cable?  

B.60:  No, we don't.  

A.61:  Oh. 

B.62:  So we don't watch C N N [laughter].  

A.63:  Oh [laughter]. Well, we couldn't get T V here if we didn't have cable.  We
live close to the mountains.

B.64:  Oh, okay.  

A.65:  And, uh, the signal doesn't come because we're kind of behind a mountain.

B.66:  Right.  

A.67:  So -- 

B.68:  Right.  

A.69:  -- we couldn't get it if we didn't have ca-, cable.  In fact, we've, when
we first moved out here for the first, probably twenty years, we couldn't, it
was really snowy.

B.70:  Oh, is that right?  

A.71:  The reception and, you know, we'd watch it and the kids would watch it, but
it wasn't all that good.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  So,

B.74:  So you figured might as well get the cable, huh [laughter].  

A.75:  Yeah, well [laughter], we were glad when it came, but it just keeps going
up in price, too, so that's kind of detriment, too.

B.76:  Right.   

A.77:  But we've thought of getting the satellite so that we could get more
stations, but it wouldn't, I don't know,

B.78:  Now, that will be nice.  

A.79:  Yeah, but I don't think we're going to do it.  

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  Because it's, uh, you can't get local stations and that's the news that
we're mostly interested in.

B.82:  Right, yeah.  

A.83:  Back to news flash, from our high school today, we have one high school in
town and they had to evacuate it because the furnace was acting up and was
threatening to blow up.

B.84:  Oh, is that right?  

A.85:  [Laughter]. 

B.86:  [Laughter] I bet the kids were happy.  

A.87:  Yeah, they, I think they were [laughter].  

B.88:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Well we had, uh, I don't know if your son told you, but
we had two papers here in Dallas and now we just have the one.

A.89:  We saw it on T V before he told us.  

B.90:  Oh, okay.  So that will probably make a difference in the reporting
[laughter].

A.91:  Yes.  Does, uh, how much does your newspapers cost?  

B.92:  They are, uh, on the weekends, gosh, uh, let me see, I've got this, on
Sunday it's a dollar.

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  And during the week, I'm not really sure how much it is.  It's probably, I
guess, you know, seventy-five cents or so.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  I would think.  

A.97:  Ours is eight dollars a month.  

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  So how would that figure up with what you'd be, 

B.100:  But you get it every day, don't you?  

A.101:  Yes.  

B.102:  Oh, so that's, that's really good, then.  

A.103:  Yes, it's kind of a skinny newspaper except when the ads, you know, like at
Christmas time or Thanksgiving or,

B.104:  Right.  

A.105:  So it's, uh, but we, I enjoy it.  I'd hate to be without a newspaper and
then we get the local, you know, the little Brigham City one.

B.106:  Uh-huh.  

A.107:  It's, uh, comes once a week.  

B.108:  Yeah.  That must, uh, do you have a hard time keeping up with it, reading
everything?

A.109:  No.  

B.110:  Oh, well, that's good.  

A.111:  No but,
