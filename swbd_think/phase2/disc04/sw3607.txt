A.1:  So, uh, what kind of home repair work have you done?

@B.2:  Well, um, done a little, uh, repair on the, uh, shingles on the roof
recently.  We've had a lot of wind around here.

A.3:  Been pulling them up, huh, or just loosening them until the rain came in?

B.4:  Yes.  It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again, because we may
have a leak.

A.5:  Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain?

B.6:  We've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks
down around San Antonio, but, uh, well, I'm right, Plano's just north of
Dallas --

A.7:  Oh, okay.

B.8:  -- and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under
water right now, I guess, I saw on the news.

A.9:  Yeah.  But you're probably, what, about halfway across the state from San
Antonio, though, aren't you?

B.10:  Well, we're up, uh, we're north --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- and, uh, oh, about, uh, I don't know, uh, eighty to a hundred miles
south of the Oklahoma line, I guess.

A.13:  Yeah, okay.  But you're still getting a good bit of the rain, though.

B.14:  Uh, we did have a little bit of rain yesterday.  So far we haven't had any
today.  And, uh, I suppose that means I should be, uh, getting up there to
look at that, uh, shingle, but, uh --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- I had something else planned today, so I guess I'll let it go awhile.

A.17:  Yeah.  Is it asphalt shingles, or, or (( )).

B.18:  They're, uh, no, they're, uh, wood shake.

A.19:  Ooh, that should be a lot of fun.

B.20:  Yeah [laughter].

A.21:  Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them?

B.22:  No, I, uh, as a matter of fact, we've never had a leak actually yet.  Now
this, we just bought the house last year, and, uh, uh, just before we took
possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done
on the shingles.  So, I've just recently had to start looking at it myself.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  So, it's a small problem so far, but I guess you just have to keep on top
of it.  What kind of roof do you have?

A.25:  Uh, we're in, uh, campus apartment buildings with flat top, uh.

B.26:  Oh, then you don't have to do too much with it [laughter].

A.27:  Not too much.  They're just tar and gravel --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- treated flat top roofs.  Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof, or
is it pretty steep?

B.30:  Oh, it's pretty steep.  Uh, parts of it are steeper than others.

A.31:  What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal?

B.32:  Well, uh, [laughter] you wear, uh, shoes with good traction, and, and, and
try to remember where you are at all times [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, I imagine, I imagine.

B.34:  And remember to yell Geronimo, 

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  if all else fails.

A.37:  Yeah, yeah, that would be just too much of a fall for me.  Um, have you
been, uh, was, was the house reasonably new, or you been doing some remodeling
work on it.

B.38:  It's actually just twelve years old, now.

A.39:  That's pretty new house yet.

B.40:  Yeah, it, uh, this part of the country, actually, they say that when the
house is, uh, fifteen, it's already old, but just take good care of it.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Thing is, we've, uh, the main thing that we've had with this house recently
has been some, uh, squirming, I call it, of the foundation.  We're just on a
concrete slab, you know --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- but, uh, the soil right under this is a clay, and it, uh,

A.45:  It's settling unevenly?

B.46:  Well, it, uh, depending on it's moisture content, it either swells up or
shrinks, and, uh --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot
longer --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep
your foundation from, uh, from, uh, drooping --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- and, uh, but anytime there's a change in the weather, like the
temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, uh, moisture, uh, you get
little spider web cracks all around, uh, windows and doors.

A.53:  Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.

B.54:  Well, usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped, and
then you patch them up [laughter].

A.55:  Um.  What is it like, uh, stucco walls or,

B.56:  Uh, well, this is all, uh, it's all drywall --

A.57:  Oh, drywall.

B.58:  -- uh, I think, with, uh --

A.59:  Wood framing?

B.60:  -- yeah, right.

A.61:  Okay.

B.62:  But, uh, somehow or other that does manage to, uh, show these little
cracks.  I don't know quite how that works.  Maybe it isn't drywall.  I don't
really know.

A.63:  (( )) they plastered over drywall.

B.64:  Yeah, I think it is.

A.65:  I remember my parents home is drywalled and then they, uh, almost like a
small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall --

B.66:  I expect that's what it is, yeah.

A.67:  -- to give it a textured sort of a look, and made for kind of a hard shell
on the, on the drywall.

B.68:  Yeah, I think that's the way this is done.  Fortunately we haven't had any
real big holes in it yet so I,

A.69:  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would, that would be in terribly,
terribly exasperating to have the, the slab floor like that swelling and
giving like that.

B.70:  Yes, well, the previous owner had a major problem with it, because, uh, oh
probably a variety of things.  His neighbor used,
