A.1:  This is Bryan, how you doing?

B.2:  This is Jay, in Dallas. How you?

A.3:  I'm fine thanks, nice to meet you.

B.4:  Good, where you from?

A.5:  I'm from, right now I'm living in Utah, but my family's in Plano, and
that's where I'm at right now.

B.6:  Oh, okay.  So.

A.7:  So, calling pretty close at home right now [laughter].

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  Well, you ready to give this topic a, a whiz?

B.10:  That'd be great.

A.11:  All right, here we go.  [Beep] All right, would you like to go first 
or,

B.12:  Go ahead.

@A.13:  All right, um, I'm pretty young, so I don't have a whole lot of credit
cards, I, when I first got one, I made a big mistake and got pretty far into
debt, and ever since then I've decided that if I'm going to make a purchase,
that I make it and have the check written out within the next week for the
purchase I made, and that way I, I keep my credit cards at an even balance.

B.14:  Yeah, that's right.  I, I think that's what happened to everybody out, they
gets, back when they just sent them to you without any, I've got I don't know
how many tons of them, but, uh, I use, uh, this one particular one for
everything, I mean everything I buy, including groceries --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and it runs up pretty high every month, but then I pay it off, because I
get a air, uh, advantage miles on American --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- with it so I, I can get a, you know, I've already gotten a free trip
just from using that card.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  So I don't, uh, I don't have any carry over balances any more --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- but I just, I was wiped out there for, 

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  years.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  But, that was the way to do stuff, and, uh, I think you have to make the
decision.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  But, um, Texas is, uh, you know, it's a debtor state, and if you get in
too big of a trap, you [inhaling] you can just blow them off, and that's not
good, but I know a lot of people do it.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  That's what runs that interest rate up --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- you know, pretty high.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  And I agree, and I think there's a lot of benefits, for example, I know
that my sister and brother-in-law, as well as my parents, they, they use them
quite like you do.  You know, they just, they're, with the end of every month
they're within five dollars, knowing within five dollars of what it is, and --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and then they right it off, but to that advantage they gets --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- you know, the privileges of like, you said, like the, the mileage and
the, 

B.40:  Well, it's uh, the interest rates are still crazy up there, you know, 

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  and they've come down (( )) except the credit cards.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  So, it's not, uh, it's not really an advantage to have them, now they, uh,
some of mine, I think up over twenty percent I don't use them any more, but I
think --

A.45:  You're kidding.

B.46:  -- they've gone over twenty percent a year.

A.47:  Wow. 

B.48:  And some of them, you know, I think the one I'm using is about fifteen, but
I don't use the interest any more, so it doesn't make any difference.

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  And then when I travel, I travel a lot, in Europe I use Diners Club, and
that gets all my, um, uh, insurance on rental cars and of course they have a
pretty good, uh, uh, plan on the gifts and things like that.  I try to get
something out of them now.

A.51:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.52:  So.

A.53:  Well, that's right, you know, I, I think too, one of the things that I've
become very aware of in terms of when I'm looking for a credit card is I'm
look-, I look for something that doesn't have an annual fee.

B.54:  Right, absolutely, there's no use paying that fifty or whatever it is a
mon-, a, a, year.

A.55:  Absolutely, I just, you know, I think that if you're doing that you're
pretty stupid, because you could be using that on something that you really
want.

B.56:  Oh, sure.  Um, personally, my, my next project, I think, is to take those
that I do have (( )) and cut them up --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- that I'm not using.  

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Uh, especially the ones that don't, that there's a working asset to these
that gives a lot of money to, um, [lipsmack] the environment and things like
that.

A.61:  Right.

B.62:  That's my second here, but I've got one Cigna Visa that doesn't give you a
damn thing so, 

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  uh, I think I'll cut it up this year for my New Year's resolution.

A.65:  Yeah, and I think I agree with you too, you know, I, I, should, I haven't,
this is my first year I've had a Visa, and I think I'm going to cut up
everything that I'm not using.  It's just stupid to have them around and,

B.66:  I've got a lot of, um, gasoline credit cards that I don't any more because
they take all the others.

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  So I might as well pitch them, I mean, it's just weight carrying it in your
pocket.

A.69:  Yeah, and I, and I think the one, the one thing that I've really learned
too, is that if you're going to have a credit card, just, you know, if you're
not going to use it, for example, like you said, with a Visa card really you
can almost do anything now, and I'd just as soon have it all on one card so I
know exactly where it's, my bills are going to come from --

B.70:  Absolutely, yeah.

A.71:  -- I think a lot of times, especially, like I'm a student, so I don't have
a really big income, but I have to, you know, be really careful not to over
extend myself --

B.72:  Oh, yeah, you can --

A.73:  -- and when I'm using it on other cards, it.

B.74:  -- I was absolutely, uh, I R S checked me one time, and they said nobody in
the world could have paid this much interest --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- and I said, well, I'm glad you mentioned that, because I've got receipts
for all that, 

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  but, you know, something else I couldn't have proven, but, uh --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- that was, I'm not young any more, so, I, uh, took a long time to learn,
but a lot of young people do get trapped on it, it's easy, you know, you don't
have any money and, 

A.81:  Yeah, and I think it's, uh, I think, you know, I was really lucky in that
this summer when I did it, I, I had enough and I was working enough that I
could basically pay it all off within, you know, six months or so --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- so it wasn't where I was over my head, but I, I got enough of a taste of
it to realize what I didn't want to do anymore.

B.84:  Oh, sure.  And they got all those late charges now, and --

A.85:  Oh, yeah.

B.86:  -- stuff they didn't used to have, and if you go over the limit there's a
charge, I mean, they're, they're really starting to hit, you know, a lot
harder than they used to, they, they,
