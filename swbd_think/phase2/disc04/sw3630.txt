=========================================================================

B.1:  Well, let's see if I can recall all those questions.  Um, well, first off,
I have one daughter who's two.

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  And the question, I think focused primarily on how people [breathing] spend
time with their children --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

@B.5:  -- and is it adequate [laughter].  I think that's so varied, depending on,
um, [clicking] what, what your life is all about.  You know, I, I was just
about to say priorities, but it really has more to do with, um, the things
that influence your life, as opposed to just your priorities.

A.6:  Right.

B.7:  I work as well as, um, [lipsmack] spend as much as I can with my daughter
and my husband #[laughter].#

A.8:  #Uh-huh [laughter].#

B.9:  It's always a challenge.  Um, I think that probably we like to spend our
time together doing, um, recreational things as much as possible.

A.10:  Right.

B.11:  [Child_talking] I mean, that's sort of obvious, I guess, when you have a
young child anyway, they're not, 

A.12:  [Laughter].

B.13:  they're not off on their own, they're --

A.14:  Right.

B.15:  -- going where you're going.  Um, so we enjoy things like camping and
spending time [child_talking] together on weekends and going for walks
[/child_talking] and bike rides and --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- things like that.

A.18:  Cool.  I think that's what it's all about.  That's, I, the things I
remember most when I was growing up were the same, that anytime we did
something with the family, it was boring, or something active.  We rarely went
to any movies or, and, and ((I'm glad)) we took that we were together to --

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  -- to really spend in communicating and talking with one another and
enjoying #each other's company.#

B.21:  #Did you# have a lot of siblings?

A.22:  I do.  I have seven brothers and sisters. #((There's))# --

B.23:  #Wow.#

A.24:  -- eight of us.  So it was a challenge, you know, to find time, especially
as we got older, um, to find time to where we all could, could do it.  But it
was also a lot of fun, it #really (( )).#

B.25:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

A.26:  I think for us it made it that although we didn't spend a whole lot of time
together as a complete family [breathing].

B.27:  Well, that's probably a challenge, considering the age span.

A.28:  Yeah.  Well, there's a huge age span.  For example, my oldest sister is
twenty-four and my youngest brother is six.

B.29:  Yeah.

A.30:  So.

B.31:  Oh.

A.32:  [Laughter].

B.33:  [Laughter].

A.34:  Most the activities we did do together were, were sports.  When one of us
played in a sporting event, it, everyone who was available would go to that,
or once somebody sang in a choir.

B.35:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.36:  So #I think that's what I remember most.#

B.37:  #Well, I would imagine# at a certain point [child_whining] too you were
probably able to care for each other in, in like pseudo parent roles, #so
that# --

A.38:  #Yeah.#

B.39:  -- you had a chance to,

A.40:  Yeah, and a lot of, uh, you know, that was a big thing.  I remember when I
was growing up, that as soon as I could drive, my job was to take over mom's
car responsibilities and, 

B.41:  [Noise]. 

A.42:  drive everybody all around.  But that was cool #because# --

B.43:  #Uh-huh.#

A.44:  -- it gave us a chance to, to get to know the other kids and really see how
they were like, instead of just what they were like at home.

B.45:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.46:  Which was really neat.

B.47:  Interesting [child_whining].  And my little one wants to talk on the
telephone right now #[laughter].#

A.48:  #[Laughter].#

B.49:  She sees me talking.

A.50:  How old is the little one?

B.51:  [Laughter] She's two.

A.52:  Oh, boy.  Keeps #you,# 

B.53:  #[Laughter].#

A.54:  busy, I guess?  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.55:  #Pardon me?#

A.56:  I would guess she keeps you pretty busy.

B.57:  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's a, [breathing] it's an age of, um, [lipsmack]
extremes to some degree, very loving and very sensitive and --

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  -- and yet sometimes just so overwhelmed by the emotions that, #uh# --

A.60:  #Right.#

B.61:  -- hard to keep them in check.

A.62:  I can imagine #[laughter].#

B.63:  #[Laughter].#

A.64:  Well, let's see, what #else,# 

B.65:  #But the question# of was it enough, you know, it #think# --

A.66:  #Uh-huh.#

B.67:  -- that's a really hard thing for people to answer.  I think that it
depends on each individual.

A.68:  Yeah, #(( )).#

B.69:  #If you# feel as though you're spending enough.  I mean, some people can
work full time and feel like they're able to spend enough time with their
kids, and other people [breathing] can't imagine how [talking] that could be
truth.

A.70:  Yeah, and I think it's true, I think a lot of times people get caught up on
the quantity instead of the quality.

B.71:  Uh-huh.

A.72:  And I'd #just as# --

B.73:  #Uh.#

A.74:  -- spoon, soon spend, you know, thirty minutes with my dad talking and just
being with him than I would an hour and a half being at a movie with him.

B.75:  Uh-huh [breathing].  Did you have times when you were, um, [lipsmack] like
going on a date or having an opportunity to spend one on one with parents, 

A.76:  [Breathing].

B.77:  given that there were so many siblings?  Did you have much one to one
time?

A.78:  Um, when I was growing up there wasn't a whole lot.  Most of our one on one
was, was with other brothers and sisters.

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  Um --

B.81:  Oh.

A.82:  -- more now than ever I, I'm home for school right, from school right now,
just for Christmas, and I've probably spent more one on one time with my dad
since I've been home than I did in the year when I was here.

B.83:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

A.84:  #Which was,# at times that was difficult, you know.  We, he made time when
we needed it, but he's [laughter], 

B.85:  [Child_talking].

A.86:  a very, very busy person.  He works his job, 

B.87:  [/Child_talking].

A.88:  and a half and he's on the school board and everything, so #he's# --

B.89:  #Uh-huh.#

A.90:  -- he's rarely home.

B.91:  Uh-huh.

A.92:  But when he is, he makes sure that it's quality time with us and he wants
to, you, we always knew that, that he was there for us if we needed #him.#

B.93:  #Uh-huh.# That's an important element of a relationship, even if it's not
always contact.

A.94:  Yeah. #I think,# 

B.95:  #Must# have kept your mom busy [child_talking].

A.96:  Yeah #[laughter].#

B.97:  #[Laughter].#

A.98:  They, they were both (( )).  I don't know how they did it [laughter].

B.99:  Really.  It's pretty amazing, when you look on so many families some time
back that were larger, it's very much [child_talking] the unusual.

A.100:  Uh-huh.

B.101:  (( )) [child_talking].

A.102:  Yeah, and I think it's interesting too.  You know, I think, to me at least,
to have a big family is something that I personally will want when I get
married.

B.103:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

A.104:  #Just# because I, I was able to see the, what happens with other siblings,

B.105:  [Child_talking].

A.106:  you know, and #be a# --

B.107:  #Uh-huh.#

A.108:  -- (( )) I had to learn to be responsible real quick, being the second
oldest.

B.109:  Oh, is that right, you were second?

A.110:  #Yeah.#

B.111:  #Yeah.#

A.112:  So #I got to,#

B.113:  #Besides# the fact that you really, uh, learn to function in the social
system, #you know, it's,# 

A.114:  #Absolutely.#

B.115:  The family unit is a, is a microcosm of,
