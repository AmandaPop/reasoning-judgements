=====================================================================

A.1:  do any woodworking at all?

B.2:  Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.  I, uh, I took a lot of shop classes when I
was in junior high and high school.

A.3:  Oh, great.

B.4:  And, uh, had a, had a lot of fun in it.  I, I made, uh, a table with a
shelf underneath that goes, that's for my room and --

A.5:  Oh, how nice.

B.6:  -- stereo cabinets and --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- all kinds of stuff.

A.9:  Wow, you do do a lot.  Do you have your own tools, or do you have,

B.10:  Yeah, my, my dad has, uh, let's see, a radial arm saw and all that kind --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- of stuff out in the garage that, that I use once in a while.  Now I
don't have a lot of time for that kind of thing any more --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- but, whenever he needs a help, hand doing something that he's making,
then I go out there and help him.

A.15:  Oh, that's nice.  So do you, um, what kind of wood do you use usually, the
pine or,

B.16:  Uh, it depends on the project really.  Uh.

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  I think I made my stereo cabinet out of pine.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Um, something my dad's been, he made my grandmother a jewelry box, and 
he --

A.21:  Oh.

B.22:  -- made that out of poplar.

A.23:  Oh, how neat. 

B.24:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.25:  So he's done, he's done wood projects, too.  

B.26:  Yeah, I, I, I think [clicking] my involvement in, in school got him in
that.

A.27:  Oh.

B.28:  Hold on for just one second.

A.29:  Okay.

B.30:  [Clicking]  Okay.

A.31:  Oh, well, that's, that's good.  So do you stain them and all that 
yourself --

B.32:  Yeah, yeah, there's --

A.33:  -- when you're finished with them.

B.34:  -- just about everything I make is either, it's either stained or (( )).

A.35:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.36:  (( )) a real, if you like the color of the wood, it's real nice to just put
on that clear finish coat that --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- keeps it sealed up and --

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  -- looks nice.

A.41:  Oh, well that's interesting.  I, I've always been interested in
woodworking.  I, the type I do is a little bit different.  I, after the
projects are done, I like to paint them and --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- um, you know, make different types of, oh, I just finished some
Christmas decorations.  A friend's husband cut, cut them out for us, and then
we, you know, got together and painted them --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- and, um, he does, you know, he makes the shelves to hang on your wall or
he makes bookshelves or corner cupboards, and I think it's fascinating.  I, I
really think it's, if you have the tools, yeah, I think --

B.46:  Yeah, it's --

A.47:  -- you'd have to have the tools to make it.

B.48:  -- it's a lot of fun as long as [cough] you got the right tools and
everything.

A.49:  Uh-huh. Oh, do you,

B.50:  [Cough].

A.51:  so you don't have much time for it, though, even though you, you have
access to the tools now.

B.52:  Yeah, yeah, right.

A.53:  Uh.

B.54:  I haven't done anything on my own for about six years now.

A.55:  Well, now do you follow a pattern, or do you just kind of --

B.56:  Uh.

A.57:  -- start measuring and cutting or,

B.58:  If, If you're, if, if you start to make something you have to like,
basically draw, draw the design of whatever it is you want --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and, and determine the, the measurements uh, of everything.

A.61:  Oh.

B.62:  And then make sure that that, make sure that, that what you put on paper
will work --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and then put it to wood.

A.65:  Oh, do you save a lot of money rather than buying the finished project?

B.66:  Yeah, you, you really, you can save a wh-, a, a, a lot of money.

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  You can go to a, like a, a furniture shop and a stereo cabinet --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- like I built, only a lot smaller would cost you probably in the
neighborhood of forty to fifty dollars.

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  I think I spent a total of maybe fifteen to twenty.

A.73:  Oh wow.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  That is a big difference.

B.76:  And, and had wood left over, and, you know, to --

A.77:  Oh wow. 

B.78:  -- use for other, other things.

A.79:  Oh, that is a (( )). 

B.80:  And it, and it, and I, and I got my, when I made it it's made to the
specifications that I wanted because I have an oversize stereo --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- that wouldn't fit in most, newer stereo cabinets --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- because they make all those.

A.85:  Uh-huh, so you got what you want besides getting it for a better price 
and,

B.86:  Yeah, they make all those smaller components, and this is a stereo that
I've had since, I think about nineteen eighty.

A.87:  Oh.

B.88:  So.

A.89:  Oh, well that's great.  

B.90:  That --

A.91:  How do,

B.92:  -- that kind of thing works out to your advantage as well, you can make it,
to, to fit your design instead of whatever they give you.

A.93:  Right.  Huh.  So you've made the, a stereo cabinet and what else did you
say?

B.94:  Uh, I've made a, it's a, it's a table that has a shelf underneath.

A.95:  Oh.

B.96:  Uh, I've made a, it's supposed to be a, uh, old style lamp holder --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- like oil lamp holder --

A.99:  Oh, oh, how neat.

B.100:  -- with a, with a mirror in the back of it, but I don't have a lamp to put
in it --

A.101:  Oh.

B.102:  -- so I just use it as a mirror in my room.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  [Laughter].

A.105:  [Laughter] Huh.  Well that's a nice thing.  I, I like a lot of the
old-fashioned type furniture, the washbasin type things --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- and I guess you could make that now where you don't find those in the
stores to buy very often.

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  You can make the kind of things that you want.  Have you ever made any type
of chair?

B.110:  No, I, I never dove into the chairs it,

A.111:  I wonder if they would be a harder type project.  Would it?

B.112:  Uh, it depends on how intricate the, the, the design is, and whether or not
you're going to, uh,
