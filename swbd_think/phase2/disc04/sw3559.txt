==========================================================================

A.1:  Where do you like to go to eat out?

B.2:  Well, my favorite place to go is a little Chinese place called, um, China
Night [laughter] --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and I guess that the reason I like to go there is because I like the
kind of food they serve, and we've been going there for many years.

A.5:  Wow.

B.6:  It's, it's an older spot, it's not a real fancy type, you know,
establishment, but it is, it is enjoyable and, and kind of cozy, and it's
quite small.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  So that's, that's where we like to go, and how about yourself?

A.9:  Well, my wife and I go to this place in Denton, Texas called Rocco's.

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  It's a Italian restaurant.

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  And, uh, well, I guess the first time I went there is about eight years
ago.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  I had just moved back from Florida --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- and went over there, you know, with my parents. 

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, when my wife and I got married we had our, our wedding dinner
there.

B.20:  Oh, how fun.

A.21:  And, uh, one of the things I like most about Rocco's is the people there
are real people --

B.22:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.23:  -- you know, they're not all, you know, hoity-toity and all that good
stuff.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  Oh, so there's good service --

A.25:  Sure.

B.26:  -- good people and good food, huh.

A.27:  Excellent service, uh, the food is, is always hot --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- there's always enough --

B.30:  Oh.

A.31:  -- you know [laughter].  

B.32:  Yeah that's, 

A.33:  I hate when I go to a restaurant I spend twelve bucks for a meal, 

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  and, you know, I got to spend another twelve bucks to find the
appetizers.

B.36:  Yeah, right, and, and then when you go home, you're still hungry
[laughter].

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Well, that's, huh, that's interesting.  You know, I've never been to an
Italian restaurant, and I know, [laughter] my sister-in-law was saying the
other day she knew of a little place down in, well it's about thirty miles
from here that was a very good Italian restaurant, she said, and we were
discussing going there, so, I, that sounds good.  How about fast food?  Do you
eat fast food much?

A.39:  Yeah, I got cans in my cupboard.

B.40:  [Laughter].  

A.41:  Uh.

B.42:  I mean in a restaurant [laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter] Well, uh, let me put it this way.  The nearest Seven Eleven is
about forty miles.

B.44:  Oh.

A.45:  Yeah, we're out in the country.

B.46:  Oh, yes, you are.

A.47:  And, uh, fast food for me is fuel.  

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  You know, it's like I buy the cheapest stuff I can find that will hold me
over until I can get home.

B.50:  Right, right.

A.51:  Usually I don't go to fast food places, because if I leave the house --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- I generally pack my own lunch.

B.54:  Oh, oh.

A.55:  I, I cannot stand cardboard food --

B.56:  Right [laughter].

A.57:  -- you know.  

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  You know, it's nothing fancy --

B.60:  I agree.

A.61:  -- for lunch, but I, you know, I got celery and carrots and --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- and pears and apples and, uh,

B.64:  Good foods that'll --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- that's real, huh.

A.67:  That's real food.  You know, my wife will make me either, you know, like a
ham sandwich or --

B.68:  Oh.

A.69:  -- turkey sandwich, or something like that.  

B.70:  Right, uh-huh.

A.71:  You know, we raise hogs and butcher our own meat, so --

B.72:  Oh, great.

A.73:  -- we have a wide variety of --

B.74:  Boy, I'll say.

A.75:  -- stuff available.

B.76:  Yeah, I, I was just thinking.  Um, we have another restaurant here that's,
um, oh, it's probably, it's about ten miles away from, from where we live, and
I know it's, it's pretty famous around this area.  It's called Mattox and they
have, you know, their own cows that they, they, um --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- butcher and they serve there, and it's, it's, it's only open five days a
week, and there's always just standing room only waiting to get in.

A.79:  [Laughter].

B.80:  It's an excellent, uh, place to eat there.  They serve, you know, good meat
and a good salad, and, and like you say, the service is good, and a real nice
atmosphere, and I know that's a place around here that a lot of people like to
go to.  We, we are just in our little town that's so close to us, it's just
starting to get a lot of eating type establishments.  They, well, it's
probably been within the last, oh, eight years that we've even had a McDonald.

A.81:  Yeah.  Do you go to restaurant row?

B.82:  No, we don't yet.

A.83:  Got you your McDonald's, your Pizza Inn, your Taco Bell, 

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  and, uh, Burger King --

B.86:  Not yet.

A.87:  -- and Sonic, and all that.

B.88:  Not yet, we're, we're working towards that.  We're not, but it's not quite
that bad yet.  I hope that, I don't know, I hate to see that [laughter].

A.89:  Well, that's yuppie food.

B.90:  Yeah [laughter].

A.91:  It makes you have to eat bran.

B.92:  Right [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter] Yeah, I went to see my doctor the other day --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- and he gave me, you know, two pieces of news.  One was good, one was
bad.

B.96:  Oh.

A.97:  The good, the bad news was I was going to die.

B.98:  Uh-oh.

A.99:  The good news is that I, uh, I, I don't have to eat bran muffins or jog.

B.100:  [Laughter].  

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  Because you're going to die anyway [laughter].

A.103:  Well, you know, uh, have you seen any of the statistical reports on the,
the,

B.104:  Yes, I have, they say it doesn't really make a whole lot of difference 
but,

A.105:  Well, yeah, they say you might extend your life, oh, three or four 
months --

B.106:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.107:  -- but it takes three or four months to get in shape.  So.

B.108:  [Laughter] And it's painful.

A.109:  Whoops, I've got a call,

B.110:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's been pleasant --

A.111:  Right.

B.112:  -- speaking with you, and keep going to that Italian place and I'll try one
here.
