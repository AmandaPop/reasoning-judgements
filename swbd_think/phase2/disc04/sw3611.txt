======================================================================

B.1:  Well, how do we feel about the nursing home, right [laughter].  Um, I have
a dad, eig-, --

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  -- eighty-nine years old, and, uh, he has Parkinson's --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  -- and, [throat_clearing] there are three of us children, my sister,
brother and I, and we decided that we could not live with [laughter] him going
to a nursing home --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- and so for two years, we took turns, my brother and I live here, my
sister lives in Longview, going back and forth up there, helping her, she has
him in her home --

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- and, uh, we just decided we couldn't put him in the nursing homes, but I
decided I couldn't keep on with that --

A.10:  Right.

B.11:  -- and now she won't put him in the nursing home, I think she's getting
close --

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- but the problem with these nursing homes is [throat_clearing] the cost
[laughter].

A.14:  Right [laughter].

B.15:  [Laughter] And, uh, he has a house and since he has a house it would
cost, oh, I don't know, something like two thousand dollars --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- I think --

A.18:  Right.

B.19:  -- to keep him --

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  -- and, uh, uh, I really need to know more about it.

A.22:  Yeah, I think we're kind of, my family's in the same situation.  My, my
grandmother is about ninety-two right now and just really has lost her senses,
she's gone senile, and we basically take care of her between my uncle and us,
and ourselves, and my uncle lives in, in Utah, so --

B.23:  Oh.

A.24:  -- it's really, it's a challenge for our family because my parents still
have a lot of young kids, and it's really tough for them to --

B.25:  Ooh, yes.

A.26:  -- to handle my grandma as well as, as well as, um, the rest of the family.

B.27:  Yeah, is she still mobile though?

A.28:  No, not at all.

B.29:  Oh, really?

A.30:  We, we basically push her around, and she's lost control of her bowel, and
it's just, it's really sad, and it's kind of like you said, that we, we've
looked at some nursing homes and, and just the situations that I've seen is
most of the time when there are, when they go into the nursing homes, they
just lose even more than what they had before.

B.31:  Right, they become a vegetable, more or less [throat_clearing] and, uh,
they don't, they sedate them, and --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- forget them.

A.34:  Yeah, and really, you know, they say that they're going to help them be
productive, but basically what they'll do is they lay on their beds all day --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- and it just to me, that seems really sad.

B.37:  Well, it really is, uh, [throat_clearing] my dad can't even feed himself --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- and, um, he still, you know, has his pretty, his mind pretty much, and
that's why we can't put him there.  I guess if he didn't have his mind, you
know, it would be easier to do that but,

A.40:  Yeah, it's kind of a challenge I guess.

B.41:  Yeah, well hopefully, 

A.42:  [Laughter].

B.43:  [Laughter] they're going to clean these things up.  I don't that they
will.

A.44:  Yeah, I think, you know, I think they big thing is just to find a nursing
home that really cares for all the people and it's not just the money they're
bringing in, but it's, it's more of a humanitarian thing where they want to
help these people have the best years of their lives that are left.

B.45:  Right.

A.46:  And I think that's the real problem --

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  -- personally.

B.49:  I guess one problem that they're having in these homes is, is help.

A.50:  Yeah.

B.51:  They don't have enough help to go around.

A.52:  Yeah, and see, that's, I couldn't do it, I think that that'd be super tough
because the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one, and I
think that would just be really, I admire those who can.  I couldn't handle
that personally.

B.53:  Yeah.  I have a friend here that, I think her mother's like ninety seven or
something --

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  -- and, uh, she's been well pleased with the care, of course she goes every
day --

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  -- and I think as long as you go every day to see about them they get
better care.

A.58:  Yeah, I think you're right.

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  And I think as you learn to know the volunteers and help them know a little
bit about your family, I guess that would make a difference too.

B.61:  Yeah, right.  Well, [throat_clearing] I, do you know anything about the,
um, qualifications, uh, I mean of knowing qualifications of the nursing homes?

A.62:  I, I really don't, to be honest with you.  I'm just saying, I've done some
work in nursing homes, and I've kind of, but in terms of specific
qualifications, I don't know other than three square meals a day --

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  -- uh, (( )) sanitation type things, but, I just, it seems like every time
I've sung a lot, and so almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think
of, we've gone in and sang at nursing homes, and it's sad, because really
they're not, to me at least, it doesn't seem like they're very well taken care
of --

B.65:  No --

A.66:  -- any of them that.

B.67:  -- no, they're really not.

A.68:  But,

B.69:  And I think as long as they're is a family member to go in and see about
them, they get better care.

A.70:  Yeah, I tend to agree with that, and I think more than anything for them
that's important that if you're going to find, find some place where the
people who are around them really and truly love them --

B.71:  Uh-huh.

A.72:  -- and they know that they're still wanted and they're still, they can
still be a productive part of society.

B.73:  Right.

A.74:  And I think too often the nursing home, for example, my grandma's case, she
doesn't want to go to a nursing home because to her that's just a sign of
losing everything and being completely unproductive forever.

B.75:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's kind of the way my dad was when he had to leave his
home, he [throat_clearing] --

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  -- he left my home and went to my sister's, and, of course, you know, as
far as,
