========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what kind of music do you like, Beverly?

B.2:  Well, I play piano and organ, and have since I was a child.

A.3:  {Faint} Oh.

B.4:  And I sing in church choir, and have done that since I was a child, and
still sing now.

A.5:  Oh, that's great.

B.6:  And, uh, I played cello in high school and college, and occasionally play
as an adult, but I don't have a cello and I rarely ever practice, so it's like
adult groups that I teach school, adult groups at school or something when
they are in dire need of somebody [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.8:  So I still pick it up occasionally.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  But, uh, my son is a music major.  He's, uh, in performing French horn.  He
was an all state French horn player all through high school.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  So there's a lot of music in our family.

A.13:  Well, that's terrific.  I think it's wonderful that you got, uh, that you
play an instrument and that you pass that on to your children.  I, uh, uh, as,
as a child [breathing] reluctantly took piano #for,#

B.14:  #[Laughter].#

A.15:  for, uh, I guess three years, and, you know, looking back, I'm, I'm really
happy that I had that experience, because certainly I, I learned some basics
about music that I would have been completely ignorant of had I not had those
lessons.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Um, I, I wish now, of course, you know, in re-, in hindsight that I had,
uh, kept it up, but I didn't.  But nonetheless, I, I do have some, uh,
rudimentary knowledge of, uh, the scales and the keys and the chords and et
cetera.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  Do you do anything with music nowadays?

A.19:  Other than buy it #[laughter] prerecorded.#

B.20:  #No [laughter].#  You, you buy it and listen to it, huh?

A.21:  Exactly, #yeah.#

B.22:  #[Laughter]# {faint}.

A.23:  And, and, uh, what I, I, I am kind of, I've got a real nice stereo system
that I've invested too much money in and, you know, all the latest gadgets
and, but I do enjoy good music, and, uh, I've got quite a wide, uh,
repertoire.  I mean, I've, I've got everything from classical to jazz to rock
and roll to the blues.

B.24:  {Faint} Uh-huh.

A.25:  I mean it's just, I, I, cover the whole gamut, and it depends on the mood
I'm in.  I, for instance, Sunday mornings with coffee and the newspaper, I for
some reason like to listen to classical music.  And, uh, other times it, you
know, just something completely different will strike me.  I, I like almost
everything except rap.

B.26:  I do too.

A.27:  Uh.

B.28:  I don't really care that much for rap.  The only thing I, I've liked with
rap i-, is when the kids at school, uh, will take information and they'll
learn it by making a rap out of it.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  And then I think it's useful.  Otherwise, [laughter] I don't have any use
for it.

A.31:  Well, it's [throat_clearing] it's the first time,

B.32:  [Noise]. 

A.33:  something that has come along that makes me feel that, you know, I am
obviously of another generation.  This is, there's gap #between,#

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  me and rap music.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  ((Yeah)) #I guess.#

B.38:  #I understand.#

A.39:  You know, that's just, I don't relate to it at all.

B.40:  {Faint} #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #But# then again I'm, that's, it, it's definitely a, a huge hit with the
younger people.

B.42:  They seem to like it.

A.43:  They do.

B.44:  Well, my eldest son took piano for, oh, about four years and lost interest,
but he learned enough that he can still sit down and play and enjoys doing
that and has a keyboard.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And then my daughter, uh, took piano for a while.  She also played bassoon,
and then she has taken dance.  Well, she took dance from the time she was
about five on up through first part of college, and [clink] she got so
involved in dance and that sort of thing, that she let the instruments kind of
slide behind.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And, but yet she still enjoys, uh, music and still enjoys dance and, you
know, for exercise she wants aerobics to music and that [laughter] you know
#that kind of thing.#

A.49:  #Yeah,# yeah.  Well, you sound like you've got a very talented family.

B.50:  Well, they do have quite a bit of musical ability, which is, is nice.  Uh,
we do enjoy the music and, uh, like [breathing] however, uh, with the kids
going through college, and we have two in college right now, they are the ones
that have the stereo.

A.51:  #Yeah, uh-huh [laughter].#

B.52:  #[Laughter]  We, we don't seem to much stereo.# One of these days we will.

A.53:  Yeah, really.  Well, um, uh [throat_clearing] what was I going to ask?  I
wa-, there was a question that's on tip of, oh, yeah, a-, as far as voice, did
you ever have any, uh, uh, voice coach or lessons or #(( )).#

B.54:  #The# only ones that I ever had were actually through the church, where
they had, uh, a voice teacher, uh, offer lessons at, sort of at a discount,
you might say,

A.55:  #Right.#

B.56:  #for# members of the choir who were interested.  So I did that a couple of
times.  But as far as, as any other training, no, I just, it was, uh, what I
learned through singing in choirs and, um, my other music, piano and the organ
and the cello.

A.57:  A friend of mine, the reason I ask, a friend of mind, her sister both took
voice #for,#

B.58:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

A.59:  oh, I guess three or four years, and they sing like angels.

B.60:  #Uh-huh.#

A.61:  #They have# the most, you know, they're just beautiful.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  And I wonder how much of it is innate talent and how much of that is a, a
function of, of how much they've learned and, and were trained.

B.64:  Well, there has to be some talent there.  There has to be some voice.

A.65:  Something to work with.

B.66:  Something to work with, right.

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  I mean, you can only overcome so much.  But there are tricks to make,
