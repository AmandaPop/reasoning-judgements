===========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of a house do you live in?  Is it typical of the area?

B.2:  The, uh, house I live in is fairly typical of the area.  It's one that,
uh, my wife and I designed ourselves.

@A.3:  How neat.

B.4:  And we've been living in it now for thirty years, so it must be okay
[laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter] Oh, we moved into our home about thirty-three years ago, and
whe-, at the time it was a small ranch style.  It had two bedrooms on the main
floor and then the basement wasn't finished, but we have since finished the
basement.  We've added a car port, and we've added a big family room.

B.6:  Well, in Texas, we don't have basements very often.  I'm surprised you do
in Utah.

A.7:  Oh, mo-, mo-, I would think most of the homes in Utah do.  We live, uh, up
against, up by the mountains.

B.8:  So it's cold.

A.9:  Yes, we got about, uh, three inches of snow last night.  The snow plows --

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  -- have been out, and my husband's been out shovelling the snow, so, uh,
but, ours is, is typical for the neighborhood that,

B.12:  Is it air-conditioned?

A.13:  No.  #I have arthritis.#

B.14:  #So you're, you're# cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning.

A.15:  No, in the summer time for about, oh, a month we could use
air-conditioning, but I have arthritis, and I don't --

B.16:  Uh.

A.17:  -- I don't like air-conditioning.  But we,

B.18:  Well, in Texas, you can't hardly live without it.

A.19:  I know.  I've been to my son's in August, and I hated it [laughter].

B.20:  Yeah, we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of
windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  Oh, we had, uh, we have had six children, and so our house was
small to start with, but, uh, we added three baseme-, three bedrooms in the
basement, and like I say, added on to it.  So, but it's pretty typical.  Did
you have help designing it, or was that part of what you do?

B.22:  No, actually, uh, it, we, we just started and we didn't like any of the
houses we saw, uh, built.  They tended to have, at the time we were building,
very large, uh, bathrooms which I consider a waste of space, since you spend
so little time in the [laughter] bathroom.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And, uh, also, too much hall, uh, space.  We saw a home plan in BETTER
HOMES AND GARDENS about five years before we built this house that we liked,
except, uh, we wanted it a little bigger than, uh, uh, it had two bedrooms,
that you could add on another bedroom.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  And we wanted it arranged slightly differently.  I think if you looked at
the floor plan now, uh, you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from.

A.27:  [Laughter] That's kind of the way ours is too.

B.28:  But, uh, my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and the original architect tried to talk us out of that, and thank
goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And, uh, we wanted an entry way so that the living room did not have to be
walked through.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  The previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living
room to get any place in the house, and it was --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- a traffic flow problem all the time.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  So we have an entry way, and I, uh, spend quite a little time in, uh, both,
when I was working, and also even now, retired, in the study where I have a
computer, so we wanted a separate study, and we have that.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And it has, uh, three bedrooms, and we wanted it, since our son, we raised
my wife's sister as our daughter, so in effect we had two children --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- but, uh, we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them, uh, when
they had friends over, and the normal noise that goes with such things --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- so we have, the master bedroom is arranged so that it is basic-,
basically a separate apartment in itself.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  It has its own bath, has its own patio porch type thing, sliding doors, and
a very large room with a T V set so, you could live back there by itself,
[laughter] if you wanted to.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  Uh, that sounds lovely.  I've always wanted another bedroom
upstairs, and then I, we've never had a bathroom off the master bedroom and I
would like that.

B.48:  Oh, that's, I don't know, uh, with, our previous house didn't have it, and,
uh, now that we've got it, we, we think we couldn't live without it, you know
[laughter].

A.49:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, those are two things that I would definitely, I
would add another bedroom on the main floor.  I quilt a lot.

B.50:  Yeah, my wife does also.

A.51:  Oh, does she.

B.52:  Yeah, and now with the kids gone, well she has a room reserved for her
junk, and I have one for my junk, you know [laughter].

A.53:  [Laughter]  Well that would be the way to go.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Uh, but, like I say, our children live a long way aways, and so our family
room, I quilt in there a lot.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  It's big enough that, uh, we, it was eighteen by twenty when we added it
on.

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  So, uh, it's big enough for that but,
