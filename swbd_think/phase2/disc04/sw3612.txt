=========================================================================

A.1:  You do a lot of, uh, camping up in Utah?

B.2:  Uh, I used to do more when our children are, were younger.  We'd go, we'd
go for a week and, and have, uh, stay up in the mountains.  It was really fun.

A.3:  Well, in, in the mountains up in Utah or where?

B.4:  Well, in Idaho, and we have camped a lot in Utah, too.  But mostly in
Idaho.  We're right, we're only about fifty miles from the Idaho border.  So
we've camped there a lot.  Do you camp a lot?

A.5:  Well, I go camping a lot with the Boy Scouts.

B.6:  Oh, oh.

A.7:  We do, we do several types, uh, we do several types of camping.  One type
of camping we do is called a base camp where we simply go to camp, set it up,
and spend the weekend.  The second type of camping we do is backpacking, where
we simply go to an area, backpack in, spend a night or two, and then backpack
out.  And then a third type of camping we do has to do with, uh, aquatics.

B.8:  Aquatics?

A.9:  Well, canoeing --

B.10:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.11:  -- for the most part.  We, we, we take a long trip every June on the
Buffalo River in Arkansas for about nine days, of canoeing.

B.12:  Is that with older scouts then?

A.13:  Uh, no, the scouts have to have achieved the rank of First Class, which
they generally get done after a year, and then they're eligible to go on the
trip.

B.14:  Oh.

A.15:  So we'll have boys on the trip that'll, they all should be twelve by the
time we go, all ranging all the way up to seventeen.

B.16:  Oh.  Yes, I have five boys that are Eagles, so they've done a lot of
camping, too, and they've, they've, uh, one thing they've done is gone on a
fifty mile hike.

A.17:  Well, [throat_clearing] these hikes that we've taken our boys, uh,
generally are about six, six to ten miles, but, uh, they'll go, they have the
chance to go to Philmont in July, and then they'll do the fifty mile or
whatever hiking then.

B.18:  Oh, oh, well our camping is just with the family, we've, well part of the
time we've been in trailers and part of the time we've been in tents, but, uh,
we've, uh, and then when we've, we've been camping we floated down the Buffalo
River in Idaho and done things like that.

A.19:  You have, you have a Buffalo River up there, too, huh.

B.20:  In Idaho, uh-huh.

A.21:  I wonder if they're connected to the one in Arkansas.

B.22:  Oh, I would doubt it, I think this empties into the Bear River.

A.23:  Well, we do some family camping, too, where we just all go for a weekend,
but we only have time to do that a few times a year, because the scouts go
camping.

B.24:  You sound like you're a very active Scout Master.

A.25:  Well, assistant at the moment.

B.26:  Oh.

A.27:  Uh, but we're very, we're very busy because we go camping every month
except February and, and then in July the boys either go to regular camp or to
Philmont --

B.28:  My goodness.

A.29:  -- and the other months we all go camping.

B.30:  Where's Philmont?

A.31:  Uh, Philmont's up near your end of the woods.

B.32:  I've heard of it before.

A.33:  It's in the, uh, I don't know exactly where it is, but it's somewhere in
the Montana, Montana, Wyoming area.

B.34:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.35:  But, we, we have boys that'll go there in July, and they'll go up there for
a week or two.

B.36:  Our, our son that's, our youngest son, uh, went to a camp called Life, and
it was up in, uh, and that's been a fantastic deal.  They really put out on
their own, and they're not, they can't go until they're seventeen or eighteen,
but they're put out on their own, and they just have to survive camping.

A.37:  Here you can go to Philmont, but you have to be thirteen as of January
first of the year you want to go, which is in July, so most of the boys that
go are at least fourteen.

B.38:  Oh.  Well, that sounds exciting.  Does, uh, do you have, uh, children that
are scouts?

A.39:  Well, I have one son that's a scout.

B.40:  Oh, how many children do you have?

A.41:  I have also a daughter, she's a Girl Scout.

B.42:  Oh, oh.

A.43:  But they don't do as much camping.

B.44:  Oh.  Well, our, our family really enjoys camping.  They, the boys will
even, we live in (( )), the Wasatch Forest, and they'll go up the mountains
just above our house and camp.

A.45:  Well, I'm afraid the nearest mountains to us are several, uh, hours away.

B.46:  Yeah, we have a son in Plano that we visit all the time.

A.47:  Well, that's why they call it Plano, because it's just #plain.#

B.48:  #It's# terrible [laughter].

A.49:  It's plain, you can, from my office on a clear day I can see Fort Worth
which is about thirty-five miles away.

B.50:  Oh, oh.  Well, I, I, when we've been down there, I just can't believe the
flatness of it all.  So do you live near Plano?

A.51:  Well, I, I live, uh, just south of Plano in Richardson --

B.52:  Oh, yes, I know that.

A.53:  -- which is the next suburb just south --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- going down the freeway.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  Well, [breathing] we, we spend, uh, part of our time camping,
every year we go up into an area and our whole family goes.  My brothers and,
my brother and his family and my sisters and their families, and we spend,
