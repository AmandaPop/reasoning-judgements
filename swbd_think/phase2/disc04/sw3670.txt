=========================================================================

A.1:  Start first.

B.2:  [Lipsmack] Sure.  I guess [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter].

@B.4:  I'm trying to think, do we pay too much taxes.  Uh, uh, well, I, it
certainly seems like it.  I don't know, you know, I, I, I'm not up in the, uh,
in, in the high end brackets myself, and so --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- I can just imagine how bad they would hurt.  I remember at one point
where my dad was paying, uh, nearly, nearly sixty percent ta-, tax bracket --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and that was just, you know, it was killing him.

A.9:  Yeah, and I think that's, that's basically my standpoint too, is my dad and
I've talked about this a lot, and I just, personally I think it's kind of, I
don't know, we pay a lot, um, sometimes I, I know that it's not used very
wisely, and I think the big thing for me and what my dad has said is we pay a
lot, but it's worth it to live in America, I guess, for our freedom.

B.10:  Yeah, uh, I mean, other places pay more --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and you can look at some place like Sweden, and, you know, they, they
almost all give like seventy percent of their income --

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  -- to the government.  Um, they get some different things out of it,
though.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  I don't know, I, I'm not, I'm not terribly pleased with the distribution
of, of, of it, and I think we, we spend entirely too much on defense --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- um, although, I work in, in, through a Hi Tech industry type thing, and,
and, which, in large part, survives on, on, uh, on defense contracting, you
know.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  So, so I mean I kind of, you know, biting the hand that feeds you if you
really want to start, 

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  cutting it hard.  But, um, I don't know, you know, it seems like, it
seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit more, uh, things ought to
be a little bit more efficiently run, and I, I, I --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- and I think that we could get by without continually raising taxes --

A.25:  Absolutely.

B.26:  -- you know, I mean, I think, I think we're at a point where, you know,
it's taxes are a burden, but (( )) services come out of it, and, uh, and
things are important but --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- on the other hand, you know, they just can't continue to rise forever --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- they can't continue to grow,

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  you know, there's, there's got to be some point where people sit down
and say, okay, you know, this is enough income to give government services at,
and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and, you know,

A.35:  Exactly, I think personally, you know, I don't mind paying so much taxes if
I'm getting what's due --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- but I think a lot of times what happens is you get into the government
system, my dad works for the government in some ways, and he works a lot with
people who are paid by the government, and there are so many things to quote,
unquote protect the employee --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- that, you know, you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of
times, whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you, you know.

B.40:  Right, right, you know, that there isn't, there isn't the business cycle
where, where government gets, uh, gets chopped down, you know, I mean, they,
they don't, they don't go through a restructuring.  Even I B M going through
cutbacks, right, and, you know, government just doesn't do it.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  You know, and, and, and it's because of in part, you know, necessary
protections for the worker.

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  But on the other hand there's, you know, you, you, you got to plan them in
the real world also.

A.45:  Yeah, and you got to walk that fine line.  I think one of the things with
the government really could, could save a lot of money on is, is, you know,
when it's, for example, in defense spending, when it's something that you can
use, like an ashtray, you know --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- just go buy it at a store, my gosh --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- [Laughter] or buy it from a manufacturer instead of having it made and
have to form the mold and everything, you know --

B.50:  Right.

A.51:  -- and granted there's other things for example that, you know, might be,
or something, if you're under, while you'd have to have specific
specifications but --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- but just to work out with our tax money, you know, watch where, is it
going to be best used, and how is it going to be most effective cost wise.

B.54:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, I think, I think, you know, in general, I'm, I'm
pretty pleased with the government --

A.55:  Oh, yeah.

B.56:  -- you know with America and, and a lot of the things that work here, I
mean, there, there's lots of things that don't quite work right, and, um, but
if you've ever spent any time in other countries you realize that it's all
relative issue.  You know every-, --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- everywhere things don't work right, and some places that really don't
work right.

A.59:  [Laughter].

B.60:  And here they, they pretty much work right, you know --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- um, but I think, you know, I mean if, if things are going, to, things
that need to change are things that need to be sort of restructuring --

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  -- you know, maybe market orientation a little bit more, and things like
what you're talking about --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- um, you know, putting a little bit more of the pr-, of the, of the
business pressures that are nor-, that are on everybody else --

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  -- on the government.

A.69:  Yeah. 

B.70:  And, uh, so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars, and a
little bit,

A.71:  And I agree with you there, I, think, you know, there's nothing in my
opinion from what I've seen, people have worked with some other countries and
from our own country that would ever take the place of the freedoms, and the,
the, the things that we have here, for me, I, you know, I, I guess when it
comes right down to it, if it was living in a place like Mexico or Russia or,
that they're really struggling, both with the government and with economics, I
would prefer to pay an extra tax money here and --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- and have things the way they are.

B.74:  Yeah, I, I think, my wife's from Brazil, and I've spent a fair amount of
time there, and, and you want to see a government system that just doesn't
work,

A.75:  [Laughter].

B.76:  you know, I mean, it's just is incredible, it's just entirely corrupt,
they have, uh, you know, something like, uh, seventy-five percent or
sixty-five percent of the able body workers are employed by the government --

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  -- you know, and so that leaves everybody else, you know, this other 
small,
