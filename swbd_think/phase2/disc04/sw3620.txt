B.1:  Discuss funding for AIDS research.  Uh, 

A.2:  Yes.

@B.3:  Uh, let's see, I don't know.  Obviously they're not spending enough now,
so.

A.4:  Yeah, well, I don't know, I really am not sure what they're spending on
AIDS, AIDS research.  I get the impression it's a pretty sizeable chunk of
money.  I was always, uh, uh, I'm trying to remember where it was, but
recently, uh, somebody on the news said that one of the problems with, uh,
AIDS research was that each time they find somebody, with, you know, about
every fourth or fifth person they've diagnosed with AIDS, has got a new
strain.  They seem to be mutating just like about, about like the common cold.

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  Finding a cure for something like that could be several hundred years in
the making.

B.7:  Yeah, uh, it just depends, I mean, I think, you know, they'll probably
spend tons of money on it, you know, under the AIDS name, but it's probably
not just being directed in the right channels, you know --

A.8:  Well.

B.9:  -- who knows how much of it's, you know, is actually going to that
particular study --

A.10:  Yeah, the general,

B.11:  -- where so much money gets spent on useless stuff, anyways, I mean,

A.12:  #Yeah, general human,#

B.13:  #On promotional# campaigns and, you know, something like, for every dollar
that they get, maybe eighty cents of it goes to, you know, awareness, I mean
that's twenty, only twenty cents for, left for actual research, and I mean --

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  -- I don't know, maybe the Magic Johnson thing.

A.16:  That might help to,

B.17:  (( )).  Yeah.

A.18:  It might help the awareness part, but, uh,

B.19:  I don't know how much he's going to, you know, actually, see I'm just a
little skeptical on that, because, you know, first week that you heard all
about that, you know, it was always --

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  -- in the news, now it's kind of just, you know, you hit, most of it hear
about it now, is when he showed up at a Laker game on the sidelines so,

A.22:  Yeah, I don't know, it, you know, the, uh, funding situation seems to be
the same for so many of the major diseases, so to speak.  The, uh, bulk of the
money goes to administrative costs --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- which usually means high salaries for people running the show, and a
major name researcher is involved with it.  But, you know, who knows what
actually gets done as far as true research.

B.25:  Exactly.  Um, I don't know, I just, [laughter] better do something about it
in the next few years.  It's getting pretty, uh, out of hand, I mean,

A.26:  Yeah, it seems everywhere you turn, somebody's coming up with it.  Wild
part about it, nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is
the only safe way of keeping from getting it.  They figured, well, you know,
we all want to be promiscuous, so, they're just running all over the place 
and,

B.27:  Yeah I still don't know anybody personally that's had it, I mean, I think I
guess once that happens and it, you know, it's hit close, you know, that 
but, 

A.28:  Yeah, no, there are people who don't get it from promiscuity.  There's the
sorts who get it through blood transfusions.

B.29:  Yeah that's just,

A.30:  Yeah, that's the saddest cases of all of,

B.31:  That's so unfortunate, the innocent bystander.

A.32:  Or that woman who died just recently, the one who died just recently got
it, uh, from her dentist.  Something like twenty-two, twenty-three years old
died of AIDS --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- she got it because her dentist had it and didn't use any precaution.  I
don't know.  Those are the sad cases.

B.35:  Yeah, is, um, is there a big, uh, what, what part of Mississippi do you
live in?

A.36:  Southern Mississippi.

B.37:  Okay.  Is there a, do you all have a lot of, um, I, I, I do know that down
here, uh, um, people complaining that because Dallas, they didn't like hardly
give any money for the, um, AIDS programs out here, and in fact, had it cut
back on it, you know --

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  -- because the city budget and that was a big, there's been a lot of
people, you know, protesting that lately out here, and I didn't know, I was
just interested, you know, since there.  Something like that gone on down
there or,

A.40:  Um, right now, as far as the state budget concerning AIDS awareness, I'm
not even sure that there is.  I know there isn't any on the city level, or on
the county level.  I'm not sure if the state's got much of anything on the
AIDS awareness.  I think most of the AIDS awareness information is more or
less coming through private sector.  Um.

B.41:  Yeah, I just noticed that, yeah the, it was just some, I mean, hundred and
forty thousand, I think, was all that, you know, for a year's budget that they
were providing.  That'll get you a couple of things, I mean --

A.42:  Yeah.

B.43:  -- it just, you know, I don't know, I mean,

A.44:  Of course, then again, most of the people who are protesting the cut in the
budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax, city taxes to
cover the costs.

B.45:  Yeah, and they're just, they had a little, um, stage thing, where they
all came in and started lying down on the city,
