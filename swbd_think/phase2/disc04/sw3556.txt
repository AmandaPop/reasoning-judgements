=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you
interested in, and --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- how they, and do they differ from like mine.

@B.4:  Uh-huh.  Well, okay, uh, most of, most of the, uh, commercial television
these days, I'm just a little bit sick of.  Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly
any, uh, television at all with, uh, my other activities.  Uh, between my
family and my church et cetera, et cetera, well --

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  -- I don't have time, I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news.
Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen but, uh,
aside from --

A.7:  Oh, do you, yeah.

B.8:  -- aside from that, I pretty well, uh, turn it off.

A.9:  Oh, I'm sort of a, well, I'm different from that.  I'm sort of a, a movie
buff.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  I go to [laughter] a couple of mov-, movies a week, sometimes, but honestly
I'm, I'm self-employed, and a lot of times I will, uh, go out and take a lunch
hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to
my office.

B.12:  I don't blame you.

A.13:  But, uh, I do it, it's like entertainment, and I'm pretty much of a, a junk
movie watcher by myself.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.

B.16:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.17:  But, uh, and my kids are all sort of movie watchers.  You know, we, we've
always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.
So, but I would just as soon, uh, be doing something else, it's just that my
kids are gone now, and, and my wife's a school teacher and sometimes, and she
doesn't get home until about seven o'clock.  So, you know, I'll come in like
five thirty or six, and I'll turn on the tube --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V and
sometimes I set there all evening.

B.20:  Yeah I, well, it, sometimes if, if it's real good, like there's more,
there's been more than one evening that I've, uh, caught, uh, every animal
show that evening on, uh, on the Discover channel.

A.21:  You bet, you bet.

B.22:  And, uh, because they're, uh, they're, they're, you know, they're
documentaries and they're.

A.23:  Well, that's an interesting channel.

B.24:  Oh, you bet, in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, uh, basic cable
package.

A.25:  That's great.

B.26:  But, uh,

A.27:  You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it and, you 
know --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- I like my sports and everything but I,

B.30:  Oh, oh, me too.  

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  Hello [laughter].

A.33:  Watch my Dallas Cowboys.  I watched them to halftime before I left and I
left at halftime --

B.34:  Well, they, they, who-, --

A.35:  -- and started dri-, driving.

B.36:  -- they whooped up on them.

A.37:  They sure did.  They just did an excellent job.

B.38:  Uh-huh, and they're in the playoffs, and I'm not sure that the Eagles are
not.

A.39:  Yeah, the Eagles --

B.40:  I did.

A.41:  -- yeah (( )) luck into it now, I think.

B.42:  Yeah, that's true.

A.43:  Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.  Well.

B.44:  Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks
were kind of down on Mister Johnson, but, uh, he's, uh, he's brought the pokes,
uh, from a, a one and something team to, uh, playoffs, in what, three years
now.

A.45:  You bet, as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm
glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.

B.46:  Uh-huh, well, it's, uh, you know, it was the time for the passing of the
guard, I mean.

A.47:  It was.

B.48:  And I think Tom knew it.

A.49:  I think so too.

B.50:  So, uh, 

A.51:  He wanted to go out a winner though.  I think he would have stayed there
four or five more years until he could have gone out

B.52:  Yeah, that's true, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit --

A.53:  Oh, no, it's, you know --

B.54:  -- because --

A.55:  -- he earned his stripes.

B.56:  -- yeah, but, see, nobody remembers him as a loser --

A.57:  I know.

B.58:  -- because he's too, he's too far, he's far too much of a gentleman and a,
and a practicing Christian to, uh --

A.59:  Oh, yeah.

B.60:  -- to ever be thought of as anything but a lo-, you know, but a winner.

A.61:  Yeah, he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because --

B.64:  Oh, he is, he is --

A.65:  -- that's the key there.

B.66:  -- because he has to like himself --

A.67:  You bet.

B.68:  -- before he can like other people.  Uh,

A.69:  Little things that disturb me, and I know he's being a little hardnosed
about it but, uh, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to
be there --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- because he's earned it.  He deserves it, and he was the Dallas Cowboys,
and --

B.72:  Yes.

A.73:  -- he won't do that yet.  So.  I hope he makes up his mind to do it,
because --

B.74:  Oh, he will.

A.75:  -- he needs to be remembered.

B.76:  Right.  Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry.

A.77:  No, no, no.

B.78:  Shoot, come now [laughter].

A.79:  Absolutely not [laughter].  That's true, but --

B.80:  I mean, I'd not a --

A.81:  -- he needs to be honored, let's put it that way.

B.82:  -- you betcha.  I'm not a native Texan by birth but, uh, I guess if I, uh,
length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here
twenty years you're considered native.

A.83:  You bet.  I've been here since seventy-four, and I feel like a native.

B.84:  Well, let's see, I came down March of sixty-nine, went to work for T and I.

A.85:  Oh, did you.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  So, uh, I haven't looked back yet either, so [laughter].

A.89:  We came, we came down from New York state in seventy-four, and uh, never
had any regrets at all.

B.90:  Right.  Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had --

A.91:  You bet.  It's been.

B.92:  -- and then look at the weather we have down here.  Huh [laughter].

A.93:  It's a great place to raise our kids, and I've got my last kid graduating
from college this next December --

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  -- she's getting married the month before in November, so --

B.96:  Oh, goodness.

A.97:  -- I will have finished, be finished [laughter] --

B.98:  Well, we're --

A.99:  -- with that.

B.100:  -- well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him
through his technical school --

A.101:  Right.

B.102:  -- and, uh, we're, uh, he's over halfway, so.

A.103:  Well, good.

B.104:  You know, [laughter] we're not staying on the topic of television shows,
but I'm really not too concerned, are you?

A.105:  No, not at all.

B.106:  No, me neither.

A.107:  [Laughter].

B.108:  I'm enjoying the chat.  Uh.

A.109:  Well, I enjoy my T V programs.  I like those, I like those detective
programs.  I like everything.  I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a
great show.
