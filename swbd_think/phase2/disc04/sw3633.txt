A.1:  (( )) return anything.

B.2:  Well, #really,# 

A.3:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.4:  the only things that I have returned have not been faulty, it's been
because of the size or --

A.5:  #Right.#

B.6:  -- #some# problem like that.  I really haven't had to return things because
they didn't perform the way they were supposed to.

A.7:  Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee, yeah.  The only thing I've
had lately is, uh, my kids got all these Barbie [ringing] kind of toys for,
uh, Christmas and, uh, i-, it takes them less than a day and they're broken in
one way or another.  But I don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, uh,
[child] maybe those type of products sh-, should be for older kids [child].

B.8:  Uh-huh.  What age are your children?

A.9:  I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with
them [noise].

B.10:  Uh-huh [breathing].

A.11:  And, uh, I don't think they're unduly rough, but maybe they are.  I don't
know.  But, uh, a lot of the little Barbie sets [ringing] they come with real
[throat_clearing] little pieces [noise] and they're easily lost and easily
broken but,

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  #(( )).#

B.14:  #Well,# my daughter is twenty-one now, so it's been a while since we've had
#Barbie things [laughter].#

A.15:  #It's been a while since they've, uh,# gone through the Barbie stuff 
#(( )).#

B.16:  #But we# did have Barbies, we did have Barbies and things, and there seems
to me that that became a craze when she was already, oh, like, you know,
third, fourth, fifth grade.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it, but, uh, I
don't remember her #breaking a lot of stuff.#

A.19:  #Don't remember her# breaking, uh,

B.20:  No, I don't.  But I also don't remember lots of little pieces #They've got
so many different things with it now.#

A.21:  #Well, that's one thing they've got.  They've# got every type of
imaginable, camping on the beach, and all of these come with, oh, like tiny,
tiny little plates and little sunglasses.  And, uh --

B.22:  #Goodness.#

A.23:  -- #my# three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll, and so I
finally got her a Ken doll, and, uh, less than a week later the arm was
broken.

B.24:  Oh, dear.

A.25:  But they were real good about replacing it.  That's one nice thing, is
they're real good about replacing it.

B.26:  Well, uh, I guess if they'll replace them, then they assume they shouldn't
have broken.

A.27:  Right.  Well, the, the, you know, those little arms are supposed to twist
almost any #way and# --

B.28:  #Any direction.#

A.29:  -- she's not that strong, that I #would# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- she's not that big of a girl that I think could really [breathing] --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- take a grip on it like a bigger kid could, you know.

B.34:  Yeah.  The main thing that they've, they had when my daughter was playing
with Barbies was just clothes.

A.35:  Yes.

B.36:  You know, that was about it.

A.37:  That was about it.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of
stuff but,

B.40:  And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics.  My,
my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight.

A.41:  Oh, is that right?

B.42:  Uh-huh #and,#

A.43:  #Well,# do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?

B.44:  No, not really.  We, uh, haven't had that much, you know, problem with
things that we have bought.  They seem to, to last.  In fact, when they offer
us extended warranties, we, we don't buy them #because we've,#

A.45:  #Don't# buy them because you don't need them.

B.46:  We don-, we find we don't need them.

A.47:  Yes.

B.48:  And, uh, it seems like it's just a, an added tack on.  Plus a lot of the
credit cards now, you know, will guarantee, if you purchase on your credit
card --

A.49:  Oh, yeah. #(( )).#

B.50:  -- #you know,# then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work
or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time, so it #seems# --

A.51:  #Yes.#

B.52:  -- like it's a waste of money.

A.53:  Well, you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it, it's
usually bef-, before that warranty would expire any, the first one.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  And like I've even bought, on a recliner once I bought, you know,
a, a, an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that, and I never used
it.

A.55:  You never nee-, even needed it.

B.56:  And so it seems ridiculous.  And like [breathing],

A.57:  [Child].

B.58:  washers and dryers and things like that, I've never had one go out.  In
fact, they usually, when they do go out, it's either something my husband can
buy the part and fix and we don't even have a repairman come, or it means it's
old enough that it's time to replace #the whole thing.#

A.59:  #It's time to# replace it.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Yes.

B.62:  So, I #mean,# 

A.63:  #I# think these extended warranties are gimmicks, really.

B.64:  I do too.

A.65:  A lot of it.  We bought, when we first married, we bought one on our T V
[lipsmack] and that there's, it was a five year, after the first five years,
and it was ridiculous.

B.66:  Uh-huh.  And they charge you a pretty good price for them #too.#

A.67:  #Yes.# They're a pretty healthy price, and you're trying to think oh, maybe
I'll need this.  You never, you always think gosh, if I say no, then I won't,
you know.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  But,

B.70:  Well, #my husband# --

A.71:  #I don't know.#

B.72:  -- finally just put his foot down and he said we're not going to buy any of
these anymore, and if it goes out, well --

A.73:  You #probably# --

B.74:  -- #you know.#

A.75:  -- got your worth out of it anyway.

B.76:  Uh-huh, and, uh, so we really have been fairly happy wi-, with things, but
now we take good care of things and we don't, uh, run out and buy a lot of, of
things either.  And since our kids aren't little anymore, I'm not buying a lot
of those little things #[laughter] that can get broken.#

A.77:  #Yes, the little,# well, you probably are real careful of the brands you
buy and the, when you do buy things, you [child_yelling] probably watch what
kind of, #type of (( )).#

B.78:  #Well,# you look at the consumer guide.

A.79:  #Yes.#

B.80:  #And,# uh, you go around and you look at the different ones and find the
ones that have the,
