========================================================================

B.1:  Well, I tell you what, uh, my, my, uh, notion of camping is, uh, well, I
haven't been very far out, see I've been in the hill country, about as far as
I've gone, as far as camping, so I haven't done any really, really rough
rugged camping, but, uh, you know, to me, it's the, uh, pitching a tent, and,
I mean, we're talking real roughing it, no cabin, no johns, nothing. 

A.2:  [Laughter].

B.3:  Just being out there in the woods.

A.4:  Boy Scout, huh.

B.5:  Yeah, that's it exactly.

A.6:  Do, do you backpack?

B.7:  No, uh, I don't.

A.8:  Car camp?

B.9:  No.  Actually the only camping I ever did was was when I was a scout.  And
as much as I would like to, you know, to do it, I, you know, don't really have
the time right now.  But I've got two young boys and I'm waiting for them to
get a little bit older and then we'll start doing some camping.

A.10:  My son's twelve, and he's in the Boy Scouts --

B.11:  Oh great.

A.12:  -- and he went on his first backpack five miles.  I've gone with him on,
uh, some other things where we kind of called it car camping, where the car
is, you know, a hundred feet away or something --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- but I did not go on the backpack.  I'm, uh, my back wouldn't allow me to
carry that so --

B.15:  Oh, I see.

A.16:  -- he got the backpack in and carried the whole thing and do it the Boy
Scout way, and he came back tired and wore out [laughter].

B.17:  [Laughter].

A.18:  But what I didn't, my scouting was not as involved as I'd want.  I got to
star and that was it --

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  -- but I'm hoping he'll go all the way.  His troop is very active --

B.21:  That's great.

A.22:  -- and there's about as many dads involved as going out camping and
canoeing as there are boys.  So --

B.23:  Yeah, that's great.

A.24:  -- it's an important part.  Are you involved in Indian Guides or Indian
Princess with your children?

B.25:  No, not yet, but I'll tell you, I, I know I was when I was smaller.  I
started out Indian Guides --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- and then went into Cub.  Cub for a very short time, and then we kind of,
I kind of got away from it for a while, and then, uh, when I got back into it
again, I was ready for, for Boy Scouts, and I joi-, joined the Scouts.  But I
tell you, I, I sure, uh, recommend it for any, any, any young boy, girl too.
I mean I really enjoyed my time in the Scouts.

A.28:  We've done rent a tent in Arkansas once --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- where it was a state park, and they have very nice manicured, well paved
park and beautiful, uh, uh, bathrooms within walking distance --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- and you rent a site, and they rent a tent, then you put your tent, well,
one tent's already up, and --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- and that's not very rough at all.  You have electricity and running
water right there --

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  -- but, uh.

B.37:  I think for a family outing it's good, uh, but, you know, if you're with a
bunch of, uh, preteen and, and young teenagers who really want to rough it,
yeah, I'd recommend going the old backpack method.

A.38:  You mentioned the word rough.  My idea of rough, 

B.39:  [Laughter].

A.40:  my wife's idea of roughing it is if the town only has one Holiday Inn to
choose from [laughter].

B.41:  [Laughter].

A.42:  And she feels like she's being imposed upon.

B.43:  Yeah [laughter].

A.44:  Uh, I kind of, at my age, I kind of like the car, car, car, uh, camping.

B.45:  Yeah, I can understand that.

A.46:  Uh, my sister and her husband, uh, their children are out of college, by
gosh, they're already into this, uh, well, car camping plus,

B.47:  Uh-huh.

A.48:  They will leave the car a few miles away --

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  -- and, uh, but they're, they're, they're enjoying that so,

B.51:  Yeah.

A.52:  Uh, we've gone cabin camping in Colorado --

B.53:  Uh-huh.

A.54:  -- uh, where there's a, uh, you, you, uh, have all the conveniences, but
you camp in the cabin, and that's not camping at all --

B.55:  Huh-uh.

A.56:  -- in your opinion.

B.57:  Yeah.

A.58:  Well, I hope you find more places to go camping.  

B.59:  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.  You know, I, I really did enjoy my
experience and I'm hoping my boys will enjoy it as much as I did.

A.60:  Have you checked into the State Park system?

B.61:  No, not yet, but I'll tell you, I know my wife, she hasn't, she really
wasn't, well, her family, they used to go camping quite a bit when she was
younger, and then as she got older they kind of stopped going, and she's
expressed interest in going and doing some camping, so.

A.62:  Sleeping on the ground, that whole bit, huh?

B.63:  Pro-, probably, yeah, probably not that rough.  We're probably talking,
probably tents.

A.64:  Screened in shelters.  Work her up to screened in shelters --

B.65:  Yeah. #work her, with, with cots.#

A.66:  -- #that'd be a good place to start from.#

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  In a, yeah, a cot, and then slowly break her in.  I don't think my wife
would even consider going to a tent camp again at all.  It's just,

B.69:  [Laughter].

A.70:  One time we did go that thing, we came back from an event and --

B.71:  Uh-huh.

A.72:  -- turned the lights on around the camp site, and there's a skunk right --

B.73:  Oh, no.

A.74:  -- and without thinking I picked up a stick and threw it at him --

B.75:  Oh [laughter].

A.76:  -- he was starting to voluntarily walk away.  Why I didn't let, but I threw
a stick at it.

B.77:  Uh-oh.

A.78:  It turned around, and if a skunk can give you a dirty look, it did.

B.79:  [Laughter].

A.80:  I said, I done made a mistake. 

B.81:  [Laughter].

A.82:  I said, Please, skunk, go on.  And he looked at me a little bit more, and
then wandered on off, very, very slowly.

B.83:  [Laughter].

A.84:  And my wife and children headed for the nearest tent to (( )).

B.85:  [Laughter]  Oh, no.

A.86:  People, we'd go down the coast every now and then, and we've noticed some
people camp out on the beach on public beaches --

B.87:  Really.

A.88:  -- and, uh --

B.89:  I didn't know you can do that.

A.90:  -- uh, public beaches, State of Texas beaches, not where it's city owned
property.

B.91:  Oh, not like Corpus,
