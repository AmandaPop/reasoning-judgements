=========================================================================

A.1:  I've never been to Iowa.  What is it like up there?

B.2:  Um, well, we just moved here, and, um, the only places we've gone to for a
short like one day vacation was we went to Lake MacBride, which is
[throat_clearing] like two or three miles north of Iowa City, and it's like a
big park, and, um, they have a beach side and a lake side, and so just depends
on what type of, uh, you know, water, I guess, you're used to.  And I'm used
to the beach so we went to the beach side [laughter] because I'm really from
California.

A.3:  Oh, is that, you moved from California to Iowa?

B.4:  Well, we moved to California, and then I went to school in Utah, and I got
married in Utah, and then we, um, lived there for a little while, and then we
came to Iowa [laughter].

A.5:  What, what part of California did you live in?

B.6:  Uh, Santa Anna.  It's near Anaheim.  Disneyland.

A.7:  Yes, I've been, I've been to Anaheim.

B.8:  Yeah, it's really close to there.  We see the fireworks from our upstairs
window [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, I've, I've been to Disneyland --

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  -- and to see the, um, the Queen, what is it, the Queen Mary?

B.12:  Uh-huh, #at Long Beach.#

A.13:  #At Long Beach.#

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  And Universal Studios, I've been to that part of the world.  I've never
been to Utah though.  What's Utah like?

B.16:  Well, Utah actually is, uh, one of the dryer states, but it actually has
some really nice scenery, and, um, have you heard of Bryce Canyon or #Zion
National Park?#

A.17:  #Yes, yes, that's supposed to be really# pretty.

B.18:  Yeah and, um, they have a lot of good skiing up there, and they have, um,
Park City, and, um, what else do they have over there?  I don't really ski,
but I just have heard that it's really good skiing over there [laughter].

A.19:  Have, have you ever been to Texas?

B.20:  Um, we went there for a conference.  We went to, we stayed in Houston for a
couple of days, and then we visited a cousin in Dallas, just for a day, you
know.  We went to the Southfork Flea Market, or the one in Southfork, or, you
know #what I mean [laughter].#

A.21:  #Well this is#, this is a big state.  We've got, it differs so much whether
you're in the south or north or east or west because it's so huge.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Have you ever done any travelling up the east coast?

B.24:  Um, we've only been to the east coast like once [laughter].

A.25:  Have you been to New England?

B.26:  No.

A.27:  Well, New England is very pretty all times of the year.  But, even when the
leaves aren't growing in the fall, it's really pretty in the summer time
because there's a lot of interesting things up there.

B.28:  Oh.

A.29:  They've got a lot of historical things.  A lot of cities that have been
around three hundred fifty years, and, and, um, or longer, and have a lot of
re-creation of Colonial items.

B.30:  Yeah, I think that would be a neat place to visit, because I had a cousin
who went to school at, at, uh, Brandeis, and he was talking about how it was
pretty there, and that's where he's want to grow, um, not grow, but live
there, and he live in --

A.31:  Where is this now?

B.32:  -- New York.  Um, he was going to school in Massachusetts --

A.33:  Oh, yeah.

B.34:  -- and he wanted to stay on the east coast because of the surroundings and
the historical part of it.

A.35:  Well, I've been to Massachusetts probably good five times up there.  It's
really nice.

B.36:  Oh, well that's a place where we have never been to but would like to go to
because, you know, just all the historical things and,

A.37:  Well, it'd probably be better in the summertime when it's, 

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  warm.

B.40:  Oh, is it humid there?

A.41:  Uh, I don't remember it being humid, not in the summer anyway.  The
temperatures are mild.  Normally it's in the eighties, low eighties.

B.42:  Oh, huh.  Um, another I guess place to vacation is, um, we travelled up the
California coast, and we went and visited Hearst Castle and --

A.43:  Oh, I've been to Hearst Castle.

B.44:  -- was going to go in, up, you know, one oh one and things like that, and
it's really pretty up there because you're right on the coast.

A.45:  I made it as far as Hearst Castle, but I didn't go any farther.

B.46:  Oh. 

A.47:  Did you go up beyond Hearst Castle?

B.48:  Yeah, just a little bit beyond --

A.49:  Oh.

B.50:  -- and then, um, we had to take the five the rest of the way up because car
trouble.  But w-, our destination was Washington and when we got up to
Washington, we thought it was really pretty because all the trees line the
highways and --

A.51:  Did you --

B.52:  -- that part is in Oregon, too.

A.53:  -- did you go through the Redwood Forest?

B.54:  No, we didn't have time.  But that, we've seen pictures of it.  I think
that'd be nice to go there.

A.55:  I've been through there.  Those trees are huge.  You can drive a car
through one of those trees, it's so big.

B.56:  Wow, but [throat_clearing] yeah, I wish we could go and see that sometime
[laughter].

A.57:  There's a lo-, there's a lot in the area.  What else is up in Iowa?

B.58:  Um, let's see.  Well, close by, um, Iowa is a place called Nauvoo that's in
Illinois, and, uh,

A.59:  It's called what now?

B.60:  Nauvoo.

A.61:  Never heard of that.  What is that?

B.62:  That's a city,
