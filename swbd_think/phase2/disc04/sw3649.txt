========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, do you have very many family reunions?  

B.2:  Uh,

A.3:  That one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them,
isn't it?

B.4:  Oh, yeah, now that one's a fun one.  That, that is fun.  I know that
sometimes I've, the one that's been hard for me is the one that the Skidmores
used to do at Christmastime.  And I, I think it's just because it was, it
seemed to always be bad weather.

A.5:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, uh, just going over the, you know the,

A.7:  Mountains.  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  It just, right after Christmas, that one was kind of hard.  I think that
was a hard time but,

A.11:  Oh, they don't have that anymore?  

B.12:  Well, they haven't since his grandmother died.  

A.13:  Oh. 

B.14:  And I don't know if, you know, they, they just continued it kind of while
she was still alive and, and, uh, just nobody has done anything about it since
she passed away, but I don't know.  I mean, it was always nice, but it was
just kind of a hard time I think.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  Do you have any other reunions?  

B.18:  Uh [breathing], yeah, my, my side of the family usually has, let's see, I
went to one, it was at my, uh, actually it was in Layton and it was at my
father's grandfather's house where his mother had been raised a little bit of
the time.

A.19:  Oh. 

B.20:  They, they've still got this old home in their family and, and that, it was
really a fun one.  That was nice to get to know a lot of the people, that --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- that we don't know and we just well a big, uh, they had big grill that
they cooked chicken and, what did they have, chicken and, I guess, ribs --

A.23:  Um.  

B.24:  -- and then they just did, they had a little program and they made a quilt
and gave it away.

A.25:  They didn't auction it or anything?  

B.26:  Uh, well, they, they, uh, I think they drew names -- 

A.27:  Oh. 

B.28:  -- is what they did.  

A.29:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.30:  People, well, no, they did auction it.  Well, people bought a ticket.

A.31:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.32:  That's how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it.
And things like that, and that was kind of a fun one, yeah.

A.33:   Was the one that, to the, up to Bear Lake, do you, uh, do
anything like genealogy or, or anything like that?  

B.34:  No, we just goof off.  

A.35:  Oh [laughter].  

B.36:  [Laughter] Just fires [groan].  

A.37:  Uh, my family goes up to, uh, Cub River, up to Willow Flats --

B.38:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- for three days every year.  I mean, it's, there's not as much to do up,
as there is at Bear Lake, but we just go and camp out and wade in the river
and,

B.40:  Now, is that the same time of year?  

A.41:  No, that's the -- 

B.42:  No.  

A.43:  -- fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin.  

B.44:  Okay, because I, it's, is that kind of a family reunion, too? 

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  Yeah, but, but that's, but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my
family is, the m-, more people come.  It's my father's and mother's children
that go to that one.

B.50:  Oh, I see, oh.   

A.51:  So, but --

B.52:  And,

A.53:  -- and then we have a great big Johnson one every other year that we, m-,
that we make a quilt and sell it.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  And then w-, we'll sell chances on it and then -- 

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  -- that pays for all of the mailing and everything that's -- 

B.58:  Oh, that's nice.  

A.59:  -- concerned with it.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  Yeah, it does, it works out really good.  

B.62:  We have, they've organized a, uh, like a family, I don't know, just some
family organization on my dad's side and we do, we pay dues.

A.63:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.64:  I think this year, we just paid like ten dollars and, and then they sent,
have started sending out a news letter on people and, and, uh, you know,
somebody's gone to a lot of work and they've --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- they're doing a real good job and,

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And so,

A.69:  Just wait till it falls in your lap, though.  

B.70:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  I'm not good at things like that so [laughter],

A.73:  Neither am I, but it's really important, I think, to keep those
connections.

B.74:  It is, it is and, I know there has been a lot of years we haven't gone and
then when we do go, it doesn't seem like we know anybody and so --

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  -- I think it is good to keep going and -- 

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- keep those family ties up.  

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  Well, I s-, I don't know, we've, [chiming] the Waites had a reunion, too,
but that, that, uh, every other, every other year, but that fell through
because people just wouldn't take charge and do it.

B.82:  Oh.  

A.83:  So, and maybe's there is a time to let go, [/chiming] too.  

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  I don't know, I,

B.86:  Yeah, but that's, that is kind of sad when, uh, nobody does want to do it.

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  But, then people get involved in other things and involved in others, you
know, but I think it's really important to keep the, your generation and the
earlier generation together.

B.90:  Oh, it is.  

A.91:  So,

B.92:  It is.  Oh, well, and, and so you just, you have the two on --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  -- either side, but you didn't have the one this year.  Is this the first
year you didn't have it on your husband's side?

A.95:  We had it, we had the, the, the one, the small one, and then for his two,
we have a great big Christmas party #every year.#

B.96:  #Oh, I see.#  

A.97:  Th-, -- 

B.98:  Oh. 

A.99:  -- and then the, the summer one -- 

B.100:  Huh.  

A.101:  -- fourth of, around the fourth of July.  

B.102:  Uh-huh.  

A.103:  But, the, I don't know, they, those are, are just his immediate family.

B.104:  Oh. 

A.105:  They're not ex-, it's not extended.  

B.106:  [Static]  Huh.  

A.107:  Is that saying we have to quit?  

B.108:  I don't know, I've never heard [static] that one before [laughter].

A.109:  Neither have I [laughter].  

@@B.110:  You, you s-, how many calls have you made?
