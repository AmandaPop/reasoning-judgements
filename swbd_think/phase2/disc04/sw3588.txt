========================================================================

A.1:  Where are you calling from?

B.2:  I'm in Dallas also.

A.3:  Okay, well, we're pretty close then.

B.4:  I've never talked to anyone who's not from Dallas yet.  Have,

A.5:  Well, you know, I've been pretty lucky.  I've called sometimes eight
o'clock in the morning before I go to my office --

B.6:  Yes.

A.7:  -- and I've, I've talked to a lady in Utah.  I talked to a man in New York,
and I talked to, uh, a lady in Kansas or somewhere.

B.8:  Obviously I'm not calling often enough [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter] So anyway, our topic was movies.

B.10:  I can handle that one.

@A.11:  Yeah, I, I'm a movie buff, I can, too.  I'm a junk movie watcher, so, but
I see them all.  I see the junk ones by myself, and I see the good ones with
my wife [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  I go see all the shoot them up bang bangs --

B.14:  Yes.

A.15:  -- and all the, uh, strong R rated, and my wife and I go see the, the MY
GIRLS and the good ones [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter] Well, I'm ready if you are.

A.17:  [Laughter] What kind of movies do you like?

B.18:  Um, oh, you pressed one already.

A.19:  Yes, I'm sorry.

B.20:  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Um, I like most everything.  I'm quite fond of horror
movies and science fiction.

A.21:  Oh, are you?  Okay.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  So am I.

B.24:  Um, what about you?

A.25:  Well, I sort of, well, I like them all, but I'm a, you know, I'm an Arnold
Schwarzenegger fan, Sylvester Stallone fan, and I like detective type, uh,
mystery, dramatic types, police, all, did, have you all, have you seen CAPE
FEAR?

B.26:  No, but it's on my list of things to see.  I haven't, as a matter of fact,
I haven't seen a whole lot in the last month or so.

A.27:  Have you, okay.

B.28:  But, did you like it?

A.29:  Yes, that's tremendous. That I'll bet, that'll be equivalent to, uh,
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or something like that.

B.30:  Oh, did you, I assume you saw that one.

A.31:  Yes, that was great.

B.32:  Yes, I really enjoyed it.  I'd read the book, and I thought they stayed
very faithful.

A.33:  They di-, yes, yes.  It was a great movie.

B.34:  Did you see the original CAPE FEAR before you went to see the new version?

A.35:  No, I didn't.  I missed that one.

B.36:  I thought I might rent that, um --

A.37:  That might be a neat idea.

B.38:  -- and I'll tell you something that we just saw recently that is old, old,
but I'd never seen was FANTASIA.

A.39:  Yeah, bet that was good.

B.40:  It was not what I expected it to be.

A.41:  Oh, no, it's a tremendous movie.

B.42:  It was.  But, I mean, I can understand that little kids wouldn't find it,
uh, particularly appealing --

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  -- it, it would be way over their heads, I think.

A.45:  Yeah, I've seen it two or three times, it's such a, a great movie.

B.46:  And the music is wonderful.

A.47:  Yes.  They, uh, everyone, my wife's a teacher, and all of her teacher
friends are saying we need to go see BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  They say that's
quite a nice movie.

B.48:  I wouldn't mind seeing that.  Well, actually, we kind of like going to see
things like BAMBI and such, too.

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  So BEAUTY AND THE BEAST would be okay with me [laughter].

A.51:  (( )).  We see them all, see, I'm such a movie buff I go out, I'm
self-employed, so a lot of times I'll just, uh, I just have a two person
office, myself and my secretary, and I'll just, uh, go out for lunch at noon,
sometimes, go to a movie and come back at two, that kind of a thing.

B.52:  So how often a week do you go?

A.53:  Oh, I probably average at least one and a half to two times a week.

B.54:  Yeah, so you're pretty, you're pretty movie buffy.  

A.55:  Oh, I enjoy,

B.56:  I'd do that if I could.

A.57:  Yeah, I enjoy it.  Lot of times, uh, my wife will have to stay after school
until seven, and I'll just, uh, leave the office at five, go to a movie, and
come home at seven, and I'll be here when she gets here.

B.58:  Have you seen the new STAR TREK.  

A.59:  No, I wi-, will see that though.

B.60:  That one and HOOK looks like, uh, it would be good.

A.61:  HOOK does look like it would be good.

B.62:  And, let's see what else is out new this year that.

A.63:  Uh, my wife and I saw MY GIRL, and that was a good lit-, that was a good
little movie.

B.64:  It's supposed to be cute.  I heard it got pretty good reviews.

A.65:  Yeah, it was cute.

B.66:  Um, I was, we were a little disappointed with HOME ALONE which we just saw.
We kind of catch them sometimes when they come around on video.

A.67:  Sure, you bet.

B.68:  And, uh, I don't know, maybe we just weren't in the mood, but ...

A.69:  That was a little, that was a little slapstick, you know.

B.70:  Kind of [laughter].

A.71:  Yes, but, uh, MY GIRL will sort of, it'll bring a little tear to your eyes
or something.  It was cute really.

B.72:  Well, that's all right.  A lot of them do [laughter].

A.73:  Oh, I understand.  We, uh, yeah, we see quite a few.  Our daughter and, uh,
son are moviegoers, and future son-in-law, they're all moviegoers.  So we,
we just all go to movies [laughter].

B.74:  It's good entertainment --

A.75:  Oh, I think so, too.

B.76:  -- especially if you go, you know, before the, uh, when the bargain
matinees are.

A.77:  Absolutely.  That's what my wife and I do on Fridays.  You know, we, uh,
meet at five thirty and, uh, go to the movie and then go out and go to dinner
somewhere and come home.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  Well particularly if you see something that isn't very good, you
hate having wasted your seven dollars each, or whatever it's up to.

A.79:  You bet.  Well, it's expensive to go to a movie.

B.80:  Well, it is, particularly you buy popcorn [laughter].

A.81:  Oh, I know.  We take, uh, my wife and I take my son and her intended to the
movie, you're talking, uh, between tickets and popcorn and everything,
probably forty bucks.

B.82:  I'm sure, I'm sure.

A.83:  Because, we go, we go visit them in Lubbock, Texas, that's where they're
at, going to school, and there's nothing to do in Lubbock, Texas but go to the
movies.

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  And you better do it before nine o'clock [laughter].

B.86:  Oh, that's the last show, huh?

A.87:  Right [laughter].

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  Well, anyway, we, uh, yeah, we really enjoy it.  Uh, trying to think of
another good movie I've seen lately, uh, oh,
