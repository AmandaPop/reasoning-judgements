A.1:  Okay, I'm definitely for random drug {mispronunciation}, drug testing and
any kind of drug testing to try --

@B.2:  Um.

A.3:  -- and get rid of it.  

B.4:  Um, but don't, don't you find that that sort of imposes a, uh, I mean, it,
I,

A.5:  Taking away people's free --

B.6:  F-, 

A.7:  -- agency?  

B.8:  Yes, I think so.  I mean, I,

A.9:  How many times do you think drug people have taken away people's free
agency?

B.10:  Well, probably not as often as, as, as you'd like to think.  And, and when
you, when you take and, I mean, it's like would you like to have somebody,
would you like to have the police able to come to your house and search for,
for let's say, weapons, uh, twice a day without telling you?  Uh, would you
like to have them come and find, and look maybe for, uh, oh, uh, illegal books
and, and could they come and, and, and just knock on the door and walk into
your house and say I want, I want to find illegal books?

A.11:  No, but as long as you are working for somebody -- 

B.12:  Yeah well,

A.13:  -- you are more or less under their jurisdiction.  

B.14:  Um, okay, well, would you, the pla-, at work, would you like them to be
able to search your purse and, and, every time, anytime they wanted to just
come and, and check to see if you had anything that was maybe against the
company?  I, I, I'm, it's not that I'm in favor of, of, you know, that I think
people should be allowed to take drugs at the job or, or, you know, anything
like that, of course, but, on the other hand it's, it's, it seems a little bit
nasty to me just to have this, uh, uh, you know, it seems quite an imposition
on, on personal freedom to have, uh, you know, the, the, the vast majority of
people that are at work aren't, aren't taking drugs and have nothing to do
with them and yet, they're being subjected to the, to the same kinds of, of
imposition that everybody else is.  And, and I, I think that that's just
unfair.  If you put it in a different context, you see the same
[throat_clearing], the same, you know, it, it, it becomes a little clearer. Of
course, you know, I, my assumption is that, that you don't take drugs and,
and, and you, of course, would never have, have nothing to hide in that sense.
And so it, that doesn't, doesn't hit home very close.

A.15:  #Right.#  

B.16:  #Right?#  But when it's something else, it, it does hit home and, and I've,
you know, it, it gets more like a police state, uh, and it's a lot less like
America to me, and I and I find that, uh, I find it pretty offensive to have,
you know, to h-, to be subject-, you know, I mean, to, to subject everybody to
that kind of, of, of, uh, how, you know, random search.

A.17:  It wouldn't bother me and I don't think it would bother,

B.18:  [Cough]. 

A.19:  any of my family.  I have a son that's a doctor and I have a son that's
an airline pilot.

B.20:  Yeah, uh,

A.21:  And I think they're, they are among the top ones that should be subject to,
to that.

B.22:  Yeah, yeah, uh, you know, and, and again, you know, in my case, I have
nothing to hide and I'm not going to, you know, it's not going to hurt me, but
on the other hand I'm very, uh, it, it perturbs me to have the, this issue,

A.23:  One of our freedoms, so-called.  

B.24:  Yeah I mean,

A.25:  Taken away.  

B.26:  Just to, to, to be able to walk in and say, you know, now you have to show
us this or you have to do that or you have to, and, uh, it, it seems, it, it
seems like it's an erosion of, of, of a lot of what makes, uh, the, the United
States what it is.  And, and I, I, I strongly dislike that.  Uh, and so,

A.27:  Well, I'm for doing it because I think that it is a protection against,

B.28:  [Cough]. 

A.29:  the majority of the citizens.  

B.30:  Yeah, now actually, actually, I, I don't take a, a totally strong position
on it.  I mean, I think that, I think there are certain, certain positions,

A.31:  You're just trying to argue with me [laughter].  

B.32:  No, no.  

A.33:  Show another point.  

B.34:  No, I, I think that there, there are certain positions where the, the
benefits of it outweigh the, the, the disadvantages of it.  And, and, like you
say, you, maybe airline pilots or, or, uh, you know, people who, who, 
whether,

A.35:  I have a son that's a doctor.  What about him?  

B.36:  Yeah, I, I suppose, you know.  I, I, I kind of wonder about sort of random
testing in general.  I, I guess random testing is a way to make people not,
not feel like they're being singled out.

A.37:  #Right.#  

B.38:  #Right,# because, you know, it seems like that, that, uh, you ought to be
able to tell who, who has a problem and, and, uh, and be able to deal with
them.  Uh, but, but I suppose that has, uh, some, some negative side effects,
too.  Right, I mean, people,

A.39:  Maybe they would feel like they were being,

B.40:  Persecuted or something.  

A.41:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.42:  Right, yeah, and, uh, and I suppose that the random testing, I guess the
logic is that if, as long as, you know, if, if, if you're not involved, then
you don't have a problem, then it shouldn't, it shouldn't be any, an issue for
you and, and, and eventually the people that are actually doing that and
causing the problems will be, will be caught at it, but, uh, I don't know.

A.43:  I just really feel strongly against drugs because I think that they're,
they're tearing our nation apart.  They're tearing families apart, they're
tearing --

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- good people that, you know, would be a, a, asset to the community and to
the nation.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  And I just think that drugs is, I just try so hard, I would try so hard to
get them out of wherever they were.

B.48:  Yeah, I, I, you know, it's, it's sort of like, you know, I, I don't, I,
just, disagree with your position in general.  It's, it's,
