==========================================================================

A.1:  Now then, are you there?  

B.2:  Yeah, #I'm here.#  

A.3:  #Okay,# so they're recording everything now.  

@B.4:   All righty.  

A.5:  But you tell me the crime is rampant out there.  

B.6:  It's really bad out here.  We just had a freeway shooting about three
blocks from our house.

A.7:  [Breathing]. 

B.8:  And on New Year's Eve, you know how it's supposed to be bringing in the new
year and everything.

A.9:  Yes.  

B.10:  The, with the neighborhood we have around here, it was automatic gunfire
going off instead of fire works.

A.11:  Um, well that's what we have had here in Dallas for, oh, for the past year.
We lost so many people due to crime this past year.  So what do you think is a
solution to any of this?

B.12:  Well, personally I've got two kids and, personally I'd like to see them
teach something about it, like in schools.  Not make it mandatory, but an
optional thing, you know ways to avoid situations.

A.13:  Do you think drugs have any, h-, 

B.14:  I think it has a lot to do with it [laughter].  

A.15:  Do you think that's the majority of our crime?  

B.16:  Uh, well, I'd say about half.  

A.17:  Well, I think here in Dallas we've got, uh, it's greater than that.  I
think, you know, like ninety percent of our crime is, uh, connected with the,
the drug scene because --

B.18:  Most,

A.19:  -- we, beg pardon?  Go ahead.  

B.20:  Most of our crime around here is, uh, it's gang related, gang violence,
gangs fighting gangs and I think that's what really scares me.  Because, I
mean, around here if you, like if you wear red --

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  -- one gang will take offense to it.  

A.23:  Okay.  

B.24:  And if you wear black, the other gang will take offense to it.  So you have
to wear, you know, something neutral like blue in order not to get bothered
around here.  I mean people get bothered at the grocery stores and everything.
It's getting pretty bad.

A.25:  You mean in their clothing they,

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Okay.  Well, I d-, I'm not aware of that being part of our problem.  It's
just that, uh, seems like these [breathing] kids or older people that, uh,
need the dru-, need the money for the drugs and then they're shooting and we
have, we had a little boy in wes-, uh, well, it's west of here, was riding in
the car with his mother and father on New Year's Eve night and someone fired
into the car.  There were three children in the back seat and the little boy
that was in the, an infant seat was dead.  They di-, --

B.28:  Oh, no.  

A.29:  -- the f-, the mother and father did not even realize that there had been
a, I mean they thought fire crackers and that sort of thing.

B.30:  Oh, yeah.  

A.31:  And when they arrived where they were to have had celebrated New Year's
they found this baby dead and the bullet hole directly behind the driver's
seat.

B.32:  Ooh.  

A.33:  Now, this is something that, my Lord, something's got to, someone has to do
something.

B.34:  I know, and it's the innocent people that are paying for it. 

A.35:  That's right.  

B.36:  It's not even the people that are doing it that are paying for it.  It's
the innocent ones that are dying from it.

A.37:  Yes.  

B.38:  And it's not fair.  

A.39:  No way can we, uh, [throat_clearing] anyway I pray that you have a good New
Year.  I hope it's a safe New Year for you and [breathing] what about, this
isn't part of the conversation, but have you had any rain out there?

B.40:  Oh, we've had a lot of it out here.  

A.41:  Okay, that's what I understand California needs.  But,

B.42:  Yeah, it, it, we do need it and there's been an awful lot of it.

A.43:  Well, I mean, i-, when you live in Texas, you accept it when it comes.

B.44:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.45:  And don't complain about it.  

B.46:  I guess you guys had a pretty good storm a while back, though. 

A.47:  Oh, I still have an apartment that has furniture up on bricks because of
the rain.

B.48:  Oh, really [laughter]?  

A.49:  Uh-huh, and I live in a, a nice part of Dallas, but, uh, anyway, if, if the
criminals, uh, do not come around here, I'm going to be extremely fortunate.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.52:  My, my husband and I are thinking about moving because we've got two little
boys and it's just getting so bad around here that I'm afraid to even let them
go out and play.  I mean, it's, it's really bad with the gangs and everything.

A.53:  You mean this is not occur after, after sun down, it's during the day, too.

B.54:  The majority of it is at night, but like the shootings and stuff on the
freeways are done in broad daylight and nobody will say anything --

A.55:  Are,

B.56:  -- because everybody's afraid.
