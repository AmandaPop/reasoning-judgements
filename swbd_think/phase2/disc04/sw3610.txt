===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, the change, how women's roles have changed.

A.2:  Yes.

@B.3:  Well, I think we've moved out of the stereotype of the homemaker, uh, and
I think it's been necessity --

A.4:  Yes.

B.5:  -- with the economy and with the dysfunctional families.

A.6:  Yes, but I think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family --

B.7:  Well.

A.8:  -- women going out to work.

B.9:  Uh, possibly, you know, if, if they're doing it simply, uh --

A.10:  For the money.

B.11:  -- for the money, I think, you know, that if, if it's something that they
need to fulfill themselves, then that's something different, too --

A.12:  Yes.

B.13:  -- that, uh, they should have the opportunity to do it, and the quote
homemaker's role should be divided equally between the partners.

A.14:  I do too, when it's a necessity.  I know, uh, but it's funny how it's
changed, because when my mother, uh, grad-, well, she took one year of normal
school, and then she taught school for three years before, uh, she met my
father, and they married, and she had to quit teaching school because she was
a married woman.

B.15:  Uh-huh, that's right.

A.16:  So, it, it's changed a lot from then.

B.17:  And of course now women can be anything they want to.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  Uh, one thing that has not changed is, is equality of pay among the 
sexes --

A.20:  Right.

B.21:  -- and, uh, I don't see any great hope for that being changed [laughter] in
the near future --

A.22:  No.

B.23:  -- quite frankly.

A.24:  [Laughter] No, I don't either.  I just think that, well, men are just
kind of in charge, and they're not about to let women.

B.25:  But if you look at the people who make the decisions, uh, the Senate and
the House --

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  -- they're primarily male --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- and, uh, you know, the big decision makers are still male.  Until we get
that changed, you know, I'm a single --

A.30:  Parent.

B.31:  -- parent, well, a single person.  My children are, are grown and 
married --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- but, uh, I still have to support myself --

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  -- and I, you know, I personally, I don't work because I want to get out
there and do it.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  I work because if I want to eat, I'm out there [laughter] working.

A.38:  Well, I think that makes a big difference, and I think it makes a big
difference, too, if, if after your children are raised, uh, you want to go out
and fulfill yourself.

B.39:  Well, I did, I didn't work while my children were young and I was married,
because I did want to give them the background that they got at home.

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  I did find afterwards, though, you take the children whose, you know, in a,
in a healthy family, which I don't know how many of us have healthy families
any more --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- uh, but I did find that the children of working parents, or working
parent, uh, were more independent --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- and maybe that goes to where it break, it's breaking down the family
bonds.  But I don't know of too many families that the women really work
because they want to.  Uh, most of them are working, and it's not to buy the T
V -s and the new cars.  It's to survive.

A.46:  Yes.  I definitely think so, and especially, uh, in those families that the
husband does not have a college education.

B.47:  Well, even, you know, here our teachers are paid so poorly.

A.48:  They are in Utah, too.

B.49:  And I don't know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work.  So,
it's, it's not just the men without a college education.  It's, our economy is
really bad, right now.  In Oklahoma it's real bad.

A.50:  Oh, is it?

B.51:  Yes.

A.52:  I don't think it's quite as bad in Utah as it is throughout the nation.

B.53:  Well, Oklahoma is certainly in the recession.

A.54:  Uh-huh.

B.55:  Uh, we've been there, we've been here for about three to five years now --

A.56:  Oh.

B.57:  -- and it's really hurting.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  But, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know that any woman would choose that,
a married woman would really choose to work, because when you're working and
you're married, you're holding down two jobs [laughter].  One at home at home
and one at the,

A.60:  Right.  I, I think that that's (( )) with a mother that's working --

B.61:  Well, yes.

A.62:  -- than just a wife, because I, uh, not just a wife, but a wife.  I, I'm
grateful that none of my daughters-in-laws at this time are working, because
they all have small families, uh, they're just, I just think it's so sad when
a mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning, two months old, and it's
cold here, and take him to a babysitter.
