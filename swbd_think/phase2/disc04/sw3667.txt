=========================================================================

A.1:  Wendy, how would you like to start off and,

B.2:  Well, uh, they said talk, uh, the, oh, how,

A.3:  Everyday occurrences that,

@B.4:  That annoy you, okay.  I don't mind these phone calls, but I hate the, uh,
sales calls.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  But, and what about you?  

A.7:  Uh, for an invasion of privacy, I feel like, uh, when I use, write a check,
then they want my driver's license and they write down my number or, or when I
use my Visa card, they want my phone number and they put that into their
computer, then they can look up,

B.8:  They can sell it.  

A.9:  Yeah, and they look up -- 

B.10:  Sure.  

A.11:  -- where I live and, uh -- 

B.12:  Get all sorts,

A.13:  -- then they mail me stuff and, 

B.14:  Yep, all kinds of demographics just from that info.  And anymore, you know,
uh, you don't have to give out your, m-, well, you know, how they used to ask
for if you wrote a check, they would ask for your credit card number, but they
can't do that anymore.  Or at least you're not legally, uh, you know have to
give it to them.

A.15:  You know what, uh, we have is, we've got our credit card number on our, uh,
guarantee card so they have to write down,

B.16:  What's a guarantee card?  

A.17:  It's a card that says this check is good for up to a hundred bucks --

B.18:  Oh, I don't,

A.19:  -- to the merchant.  

B.20:  I, I, we don't use that, that I know of here.  

A.21:  On ours, it's just on the back of our Visa -- 

B.22:  Oh. 

A.23:  -- and it says guarantee. 

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  And you might want to check out your Visa, it might have o-, that on there
already.

B.26:  Okay.  

A.27:  Uh, so do you,

B.28:  But, particularly what I was speaking of are the telemarketing phone calls,
you know, at odd hours that I get.

A.29:  Like computers?  

B.30:  Yeah.  Well, and not necessarily computers, you know, it can be the people.
Sometimes the people are worse than the computers because you can just hang up
on the computer, but the person, you know, will do anything to keep you on the
line and, uh, you know, I, I, I don't like to be rude to people, but I find
myself becoming more and more, uh, abrasive because I just don't, you know,
feel like they should be calling me on my own personal private time.

A.31:  What do you think about the, uh, caller I D when you call in like on an
eight hundred number or something or a, to buy something and then they know
who you are and, uh, where you're calling from and your address and all that?

B.32:  Well, I have to say, that, you know, if you're going to do it, then you
have to realize the consequences.

A.33:  But see, most people don't know that that information is recorded.

B.34:  Yeah, well, I, I, I, I suppose that's true, but I know that, you know,
whenever you're giving that kind of information out, particularly when you're
buying something, you know, your name automatically goes on a list which is
sold, sold to a hundred other companies.

A.35:  Yep.  You seem well informed.  

B.36:  Well, I, I, I studied advertising in college and that, uh, you know, that's
one of the areas I suppose it would cover.  But I, I, I would never do
telemarketing as a job.  I can't stand rejection [laughter].

A.37:  No, that's kind of a, a bummer.  I'm looking forward to the time when, uh,
my phone at home can tell me who's calling.

B.38:  Yeah, that would be nice.  

A.39:  And then I don't answer it if I don't want to talk to,

B.40:  I suppose the day will come.  I,

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  Well,

A.43:  We'll see.  

B.44:  Any others that you can think of?  

A.45:  Another invasion of privacy.  Uh, everyday occurrence, [clicking] I can't.

B.46:  Well, I mean, unless you go to the extremes like, uh, people coming up to
you, I had this lady come to in the mall and said you, you look just lovely, I
just wanted to tell you that.  By the way, I'm a Mary Kay representative and
here's my business card, can I set you up for a facial?  And I mean, I was
shopping for Christmas presents in the mall [laughter].  And I found, I found
her tactics extremely rude because she was preying on my, uh, you know, uh,
everybody's self esteem, you know --

A.47:  Sure.  

B.48:  -- gee, somebody thinks I'm pretty, you know.  

A.49:  Gosh, they want to tell me I look great [laughter].  

B.50:  That's right.  By the way, here's my business card, let me set you up for a
facial and get you to spend fifty bucks.

A.51:  You know, as a consumer, we have to be wary of all that type of propaganda.

B.52:  Exactly, and I was very flattered until she told me she, the company she
was with.

A.53:  [Laughter] Oh, what a bummer.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  That would be a, kind of a deflator.  

B.56:  She goes to everybody in the mall and says the same thing, so I wasn't too
flattered.

A.57:  Let's see, I took something back to Z-, sa-, one of the stores today, a
Christmas gift and, uh, I had to show my I D and, uh, blood type and, because
I didn't have a sales slip and,

B.58:  Oh. 

A.59:  It was interesting.  

B.60:  What a bummer.  

A.61:  Yeah, uh,

B.62:  Did you even have the tag on the item?  

A.63:  Uh, no.  

B.64:  So they were particularly, uh, well, uncooperative.  

A.65:  They were, and, uh, I guess the time to do it, I talked to the, with the
guys at work, is right after Christmas because they're --

B.66:  #They're so# --

A.67:  -- #too busy to give# -- 

B.68:  -- swamped -- 

A.69:  -- you a rush.  

B.70:  -- they let you get by.  

A.71:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  Well, I don't have anything else to say.  

B.74:  I think we've covered it.  

A.75:  Well, it's been a pleasure, Wendy.  

B.76:  And you, too.  

A.77:  Bye.  

B.78:  Bye-bye.
