B.1:  W-, 

A.2:  Hi.  

B.3:  Well, what do you think?

A.4:  Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a
pretty big task and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons.
Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with
the deficit right now, and if they were to administer this, they would, uh,
[laughter] get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out
ourselves.  Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down
because the competition would, would be dried up and really no one would be,
would only answer to, to the government to a big bur-, bureaucratic mess.
And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries and so I don't think,
uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.  Although that we have
problems right now and I do agree that they exist because health care
insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where
basically no one can afford it anymore.

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  How do you feel about the whole ordeal?  

B.7:  Well, I agree that it's a big task, but I think that, I think that the U
S should move toward some kind of national health care plan.  At least as a
long term kind of goal.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  And possibly, y-, just starting with more regulation of health insurance
and that sort of thing, but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea
to, uh, and not have a completely socialized,

A.10:  [Laughter].

B.11:  medical system -- 

A.12:  Uh-huh.  

B.13:  -- in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we
have now.

A.14:  Okay.  

B.15:  It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky
rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit --

A.16:  Oh, yeah.  

B.17:  -- perhaps and so that, and -- 

A.18:  #But what,# 

B.19:  -- #that's a# -- 

A.20:  #What you're think-,# 

B.21:  -- #that's a# vicious cycle, of course.  

A.22:  Yeah, so what #you're# -- 

B.23:  #Because,# 

A.24:  -- saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh,
government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child
with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the
high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.  Is that --

B.25:  Um,

A.26:  -- is that correct, or do you think that,

B.27:  Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government
actually administrating it ultimately.  I don't think that that would
necessarily be such a bad idea.  And, [noise], uh [noise],

A.28:  Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the
government, uh, because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more
taxes and the, the in-, the people that can afford taxes, the middle income
and the upper income will be paying more c-, taxes to, to pay for health
insurance for everyone, whereas right now --

B.29:  Right.  

A.30:  -- the, the public themselves get health insurance and they provide their
own health insurance.

B.31:  The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than
their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only
people that can afford health insurance [whistling] and so that the other
people have no health insurance and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway
at least in emergencies and --

A.32:  E-,

B.33:  -- somebody winds up paying for that and basically the people paying for it
are the people who are buying health insurance so I don't see that anything,
that this situation would get any worse.  That way it might get better.

A.34:  You think it might b-, get better, huh?  I, I kind of disagree [laughter].

B.35:  Uh-huh.  

A.36:  The reason being is, uh, we have, I don't know, I guess it's my, my fear of
the national government and also because the bureaucratic --

B.37:  Uh-huh.  

A.38:  -- rules that it would take to administer it and, uh, the, the health
insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and,
and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business,
whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't
care because they'll never go out of business.  People would still have to pay
taxes, the money would have to come from somewhere and so you'd s-, I, I feel
that the cost would increase dramatically also.  But in the same sense the,
the care and the, the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the
medical, uh, field would, would diminish.

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  Uh,

B.41:  Yeah, well, I think,
