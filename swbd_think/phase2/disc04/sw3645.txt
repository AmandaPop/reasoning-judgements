=====================================================================

A.1:  Magazines are you reading these days?  

@B.2:  Well, I get a, uh, quite a few.  Uh, we've said that our, our magazine
subscriptions, uh, really add up to a strange, uh, bunch, but I get, I get
BUSINESS WEEK.  Uh, I get one called, uh, DULCIMER PLAYERS' NEWS.  I get, uh,
uh, the WASHINGTON POST, uh, weekly magazine.  Uh, we get TIME, uh, and then I
get, uh, uh, well, I guess I don't get electronics magazines anymore.  I get
a, a electronics, uh, news, newspaper.  Uh, what about you?

A.3:  Well, I get the three, uh, weeklies, NEWSWEEK and TIME and U S NEWS.  I
also get SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.  Guess those are the only ones I get weekly, and
then once a month we get a whole slew of them.  We get MONEY MAGAZINE and, uh,
SOUTHERN LIVING and COUNTRY LIVING and --

B.4:  Huh.  

A.5:  -- and, uh, oh, my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to
[laughter].

B.6:  Oh, yeah [laughter], yeah.  

A.7:  A whole, whole bunch of those.  Well, I g-, -- 

B.8:  Well,

A.9:  -- I guess the good thing about these, uh, weekly magazines especially how
they put things in the, oh, they have time to at least put things in
perspective.

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  But, uh, you know, I guess the bad thing is they don't have the immediacy
of a radio or T V or, or newspaper.  But they kind of can, you know, give you
a bigger picture on things than, than the, than the daily media can.

B.12:  Yeah, yeah, that little bit of the, of the whys behind what's happening and
not just the, the facts, yeah, I, uh,

A.13:  They can be responsive, too.  I know this summer U S NEWS was going to
take a week off in August and then when the,

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an i-, an issue
that they weren't going to do --

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  -- which shows that they're, that they're certainly are responsive to
changing events.

B.18:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I know that, yeah, and the category that I forgot is
the, the, uh, professional, uh, ones.  I'm a member of, uh, I TRIPOLY, and,
uh, uh, A C M, Association for Community Materials.  I get, uh, three or four,
uh, the ma-, magazine form things, uh, that way, uh, too, so, uh, I, I don't
know what the, what the status is in general of, of people reading magazines.
I, I certainly, uh, do a lot of it and, and, uh, newspapers for that matter,
but, uh, I've heard that the trend in reading in general and, and then,
especially newspapers is down, that people just,

A.19:  Well, I think you're right.  I think trend in reading, I think one reason
that the TIMES HERALD folded and other papers folded is the people are reading
newspapers less than they used to and I guess that means they must be reading
magazines and, you know, other written stuff less, too.

B.20:  Yeah, I think, I think so.  I, I don't, I haven't heard exactly how it's
effecting the magazines, maybe not quite as much, but uh, I think that, uh,
more and more people are just depending on the T V for what, what news they do
get.

A.21:  Of course, then, you have the specialty magazines like magazines on
baseball or #GOLF# --

B.22:  #Oh, yeah.#  

A.23:  -- DIGEST or -- 

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  -- or knitting or crocheting and all these things that have a selective
market that just aim at one kind of thing.  Those, maybe it's that the, that
the special purpose magazines are doing better and the ones that are more
general --

B.26:  That could be.  

A.27:  -- aren't doing as well.  

B.28:  That could be because there's not, there's not really an alternative, uh,
[noise] uh, source for that kind of, kind of information, but, uh,

A.29:  Yeah, I guess if you want to find out a specific item, you have nowhere
else to turn if you want to find out --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- the, the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening
magazine, you're not going to find this --

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  -- anyplace else.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  Whereas if you want to know what happened in, in, in Russia today, you can
turn on the radio or T V and you don't really have to read a paper or magazine
to find out.

B.36:  Right.   

A.37:  That may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff, I think a lot more
magazines that are, that aim just smaller market will be coming out.

B.38:  Yeah, I, I wonder if tha-, I wonder if that will, uh, uh, make things
different.  I've heard that, uh, read an article just last week about fax
newspapers coming out and wonder if they'll do that with, uh, you know,
magazine kinds of things as well.  I, uh, was it, uh, uh, Skip, uh, Bayless --

A.39:  Yeah, I heard, uh, I heard it, too, Skip Bayless, wasn't it. 

B.40:  -- from the TIMES HERALD is doing a, a fax sports column [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah, I read three times a week he's going to fax you the sports column.  I
don't know --

B.42:  Uh.  

A.43:  -- I don't know how that will catch on.  

B.44:  No, but, uh, it was interesting.  Uh,

A.45:  Yeah, I thought that, I, that would be interesting to, to see, though.

B.46:  And it, they, for a long time they've been talking about, uh, you know,
that, that moving away from paper, magazines, uh, I guess, would it be
included in that in terms of, of, uh, computer access and stuff, but that,
that doesn't really seem to have caught on to the extent that they keep
predicting, uh,

A.47:  Well, you know, y-, y-, you don't have time,
