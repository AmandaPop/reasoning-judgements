=======================================================================

A.1:  What I like in a good job is I like good salary, but also I think they
should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and retirement funds, like
that, so that you can plan for the future, and they don't do that any more
like they used to in the big companies [sniffing].

B.2:  Uh-huh.  Well, I, I, I can agree with what you say, and of course, uh, in
addition to what you mentioned, you know, I'd like to see them have some, uh,
more companies have like dental care --

A.3:  Yes, uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, uh,

A.5:  Medical and dental.

B.6:  Yeah, and more benefits for, uh, working mothers, uh,

A.7:  That's right.

B.8:  I noticed here lately there's some companies have been providing what they
kind of call an in-house day care center, where the mothers can come and leave
their, uh, children --

A.9:  That's great.

B.10:  -- with somebody locally at the company and go to work, and if something
happens, they're immediately there.

A.11:  Oh, wouldn't that be great?

B.12:  Yeah, I have a couple of teena-, I have a couple of daughters, one of which
is married and has two, two small sons --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and they stay in a day care, and, and they have a lot of sickness
because they're around the other children --

A.15:  Yeah, yeah.

B.16:  -- and it would be so nice if, uh, the company she worked for provided
that, uh, you know, in house, or, or nearby, or --

A.17:  That's right.

B.18:  -- now there is, there is one benefit that, uh, is, uh, offered now, um,
where they pay, they pay, they pay for hospitalization, uh, with funds, uh,
before income tax funds, uh, before, with funds that are not taxed.

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  But I think that's more or less kind of in the group insurance field.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  So that's a new innovation, too, for a benefit.

A.23:  Well, that in-house day care is excellent.  They could go on their lunch
hour and see their kids --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- or any time.

B.26:  Yeah, that's true.  And, uh, let's see, what other benefits?  Do you have
any others that you'd like to see?  How about, uh,

A.27:  Well, I, the profit sharing and the retirement.  They just don't offer
those like they used to.

B.28:  Yeah, in the old days, of course they didn't have any, any benefits at all.
They preached job security --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- but that went out fast.

A.31:  Oh, it didn't, that's right.

B.32:  And, uh, so now days I guess, funding takes par-, or rather, uh, uh, your
benefits are locked in after you're there with a company for five years, but
the benefits are so small --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and usually they're tied in with social security, and, uh,

A.35:  Most people retire on social security now. 

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  That's all they have.

B.38:  Right, and, uh, so, uh, even if you have benefits and you, and then when
you get to social security age, they're not as great because they're tied in
to social security benefits.  So you don't get both of them in full.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  So it's hard today, to live off of social security if you don't have your
home paid for.

A.41:  That's right, that's right.

B.42:  So, uh,

A.43:  That's what my folks did.  They're just living on social security
[throat_clearing].  They had [cough] two houses and they were trying to b-,
sell one to pay off the other one, and, they waited for like four or five
years trying to p-, sell that one house --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- so they could pay off the other one, because they're just living on
social security.  They had a real hard time.

B.46:  I see, uh-huh.

A.47:  Yeah, you got to have your house paid for.

B.48:  Well, you know, uh, benefits, uh, are great, and, uh, the more that a
company can provide, the better off we are, but it's so hard now for companies
to make a profit, as you no doubt --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- know, you know.  Most of our companies, uh, are losing, 

A.51:  [Sniffing].

B.52:  their shirt --

A.53:  That's right.

B.54:  -- going bankrupt --

A.55:  That's right.

B.56:  -- and, uh, so some kind of system has to be devised (( )) more
competitive.  Perhaps we've, uh, uh, been, uh, we were too used to off time,
and all these benefits that are not, uh, taking care of us in our old age.
But we're getting immediate effect of them, like for example, like seven hour
days and, uh, when in effect while we're young we ought to be working harder
and come up with better benefits so that when --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- we get older we have the, uh, we, we have those benefits available to 
us --

A.59:  Yeah --

B.60:  -- #(( )) that would make# --

A.61:  -- #we don't have to work so hard.#

B.62:  -- it easy for us in retirement --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- uh, you know, social security again, most of the young people today are
paying in.  They don't have any, yet, they don't believe that anything will be
left over --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- when they get to retirement age.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  Course the old bank never gives out, you know. 

A.69:  I heard that all my life there wasn't going to be any when I was on it --

B.70:  Uh-huh, and, uh, so,

A.71:  -- or when I got on it.

B.72:  I guess, uh, we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you
get to zero, and then --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- everybody can say, okay, nobody has anything and start over again.

A.75:  Well, the insurance, that's, that's the main thing that I worry about, is
the insurance.

B.76:  Uh-huh.  Insurance costs are going up.

A.77:  Well, and they, and they just,
