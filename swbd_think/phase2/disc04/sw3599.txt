A.1:  up in New York?

B.2:  Freezing.

A.3:  Is it dry or wet?

B.4:  Um, it's, it's been pretty dry, yeah.  It, it rained, but we had a problem
with a little bit of a water shortage, but it rained for a bit, but the last
about three, four days, I guess you probably had a cold front last week, but,
uh, they said that it was coming across the country, but the last few days has
been like really cold.  It was down to about thirteen degrees, um, yesterday
morning, when I woke up.  It's starting to warm up a little bit, now, but we
haven't got any snow, yet.  Just a couple of sprinkles here and there.

A.5:  Well, we haven't had cold weather.  We've just had rain and rain and more
rain.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  This is our third consecutive day of rain, and the weather man is promising
us at least four more days of rain.

B.8:  Is it, you say, in Dallas?

A.9:  Yeah, in Dallas.  And we're on the verge, and it's going to happen either
today or tomorrow, of setting an all time record for most rain in a year.

B.10:  Wow.

A.11:  Our normal rainfall is twenty-nine inches, and we're already up to over
fifty inches.

B.12:  Wow, that's wild.

A.13:  And it's coming down and coming down.  It's, it has been raining all year
at an incredible pace.

B.14:  That's pretty wild.

A.15:  I know.  We're about to float away.

B.16:  It's usually pre-, I guess twenty-nine is pretty dry.  It's, Dallas is kind
of in the desert, huh.

A.17:  Well, it's not really in desert.  The desert starts about fifty miles west
of here, is where the desert sort of starts.  But twenty-nine inches is, is
our normal.  We have very dry summers, and, uh, spring time is usually fairly
wet, but this time of year is fairly dry, and we're having spring time rain
right now.

B.18:  Well, how, how cold has it been?

A.19:  Oh, it's, uh, pretty warm.  It's about fifty-three degrees or so.  Uh, so
it's not cold, but it's just wet.

B.20:  Yeah, I lived in Oregon for three years, so I know what that's about.

A.21:  What, is it warm but wet up there?

B.22:  Yeah, I used to, it wasn't super warm.  During the winter it would be, you
know, forty-five, fifty degrees, most of the time.  But always a sprinkling
type rain.  Uh, in New York, you get, when it rains you get like real showers
sometimes.  You never got that out there [noise].  But, uh, but here it, it,
[noise] it rains about for-, I guess about forty-two, forty-two inches a year.
Yeah, I know we had a little bit of a, a drought this year, as a matter of
fact, because the water supply in our reservoirs was a little low.

A.23:  Well, we're not having any problem like that.  The last time we had drought
around here was nineteen eighty, when we really got very little rain, but
since then it's been normal, and then this is about the fourth year in a row
where we've had above average rain.  Last year we had about forty-five inches,
and, which is well above.  And now what we're having this year.  So it's been
tremendous rainfall.

B.24:  Does it do any damage, I mean, you have floods or anything like that, or?

A.25:  Uh, some areas have had some flooding.  The worst flooding occurs in the
spring time when some, when our main river (( )), the Trinity River, goes over
its banks and it causes damage, but, uh, for the most part, [noise] they've
been trying to deal with that, although the traffic is horrible.

B.26:  When it rains.

A.27:  When it rains, oh, yes --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- everything comes to a, a standstill.  With the rain this morning it took
me thirty minutes extra to get to work.

B.30:  Yeah, yeah, I found that I used to commute, I used to live in New York City
and commute out to Long Island, which is in the suburbs, and, uh, it was
normally about an hour and fifteen minutes, hour and a half drive it'd take,
there was really a lot of traffic, but it was like pretty good flowing
traffic, and then it would get really bad when, when it rain (( )) together,
you know, takes,

A.31:  Is your, is your weather now normal for this time of year, or is it
different?

B.32:  Uh, yeah, it's pretty normal.  Today is pretty normal.  Today it's probably
about [noise] thirty, thirty-five degree, well, maybe thirty degrees out now,
and it's supposed to go up to forty, and then that's about normal.  We don't,
we don't usually stay below freezing, uh, for long periods of time.  Uh, you
know, we have cold spells that, that happen, but, but aside from that, usually
the temperature, probably average temperature is thirty-five, forty degrees
during the winter --

A.33:  Well, #we had, we had# --

B.34:  -- #so this is kind of normal.#

A.35:  -- early freezes here.  We had our, a normal freeze is around November
twentieth, and we had our freeze this year on November second, and between the
second and the tenth of November, in those eight days, we set record lows six
of eight days, and so we thought we were going to really have a cold winter,
but since then, it's, the temperatures have been normal.  It's just that the
rain has been incredible.

B.36:  Yeah, that's what happened here last year.  We had, we had, uh, a lot of
cold early on, and then it, and then the winter was relatively mild.  I think
they, I think it's going to be a cold winter this year, though, because of
that volcano in, uh, [lipsmack] --

A.37:  Oh, in the Philippines.

B.38:  -- in the Philippines that's supposed to like cover up the, uh, or rather
raise the warming layers and stuff like that.  So it's probably going to be a
couple degrees cooler.  But, uh,

A.39:  Well, I don't know what, I don't know if that volcano caused all this rain,
but something's been causing all this rain.

B.40:  It could, it could, it could cause rain, I'm not sure but,
