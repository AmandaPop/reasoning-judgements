tell apart through most of the tape.  Speaker A had a baby in the
background.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, the most that I'm most familiar with are the Utah jazz.  I guess that's
because they, they're,

B.2:  What are they called?  

A.3:  Utah jazz.  

B.4:  Jazz?   

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Oh.  

A.7:  The jazz.  Right and,  

B.8:  Never heard of them [laughter].  

A.9:  [Laughter] They're a fairly new ball team, as far as ball teams go.

B.10:  Oh. 

A.11:  [Noise] Uh, they probably oh, it's probably five to ten years that
they've, they've been, you know, in existence and, but they've done really
fairly well for, for a new team.  They, I think out of the last like eleven
games, they've won, won nine, which is pretty good because --

B.12:  Oh, yeah.  

A.13:  -- a lot of them were on, you know, on the road.  And, uh, I think as far
as whichever division they're in, they're rated either number one or number
two.

B.14:  Uh-huh, so that's good.  

A.15:  So that's, yeah, that's fairly good.  And -- 

B.16:  Yeah, well, maybe -- 

A.17:  -- how about,

B.18:  -- we'll hear of them more often [laughter].  

A.19:  [Laughter] And how about yourself?  

B.20:  Well, I guess what we have here is the Mavericks, is that right,
basketball?

A.21:  Oh. 

B.22:  What is, what is our Dallas basketball, I'm not really sure. 

A.23:  The, the Dallas Mavericks, I, that,

B.24:  One is soccer, one is basketball.  

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  The Mavericks must be basketball.  

A.27:  Oh. 

B.28:  And, uh, my daughter plays basketball.  You wouldn't know it, would you --

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  -- from this conversation [laughter].  

A.31:  Oh, well.

B.32:  I'm familiar with the Teddy Bears --

A.33:  #Well, tell me about,# 

B.34:  -- #and they're my favorite.#  

A.35:  Yeah, tell me about her team.  How old is she?  

B.36:  Well, now she's twelve so,

A.37:  Oh. 

B.38:  But she's been playing basketball for four or five years on a --

A.39:  Oh, has she?  

B.40:  -- little team called Teddy Bears and -- 

A.41:  Well, how fun.  

B.42:  -- that's been fun so now she just made her middle school team so 
that's,

A.43:  Well, great.  

B.44:  And they've won so far, that's good.  But, uh,

A.45:  She must really enjoy it.  

B.46:  Yes, she likes it a lot, yeah.  

A.47:  Well, good.  

B.48:  She really does.  And the Lakers I guess is my favorite as far as, as
anything I #know about basketball.#

A.49:  #As professionals.#  

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  Professional basketball team.  

B.52:  Because I, my boyfriend's in California, so -- 

A.53:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.54:  -- I'm going to have to look at Lakers this year a lot.  

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  So [laughter], #I guess# --

A.57:  #Have to at least,# 

B.58:  -- I'll get used to it [laughter].  I learned a lot about football, so far,
so [laughter].

A.59:  Oh. Uh-huh, well, does, now was your daughter just interested in basketball
or why did she start playing?

B.60:  Uh, I guess because her friends signed up -- 

A.61:  Oh. 

B.62:  -- and she wanted to sign up.  She twirls and she's, she's been real, real
involved in that --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- so we haven't had time for soccer -- 

A.65:  Oh. 

B.66:  -- which is the most important thing around here pretty, I mean --

A.67:  Oh, it is?  

B.68:  -- all the little kids play soccer.  

A.69:  Oh. 

B.70:  They even have like a preschool soccer team.  

A.71:  My word.  

B.72:  It's big in Texas.  And maybe all over, now, I don't know but,

A.73:  Oh, wow.  

B.74:  Uh, it's very big here.  But we didn't have that time.  

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  And so I did let her play basketball and I like it because it's indoors.

A.77:  Oh, yeah.  

B.78:  Yeah [laughter], I like indoor -- 

A.79:  Right [laughter].  

B.80:  -- things [laughter].  So,

A.81:  Well, that's good.  

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  If she made her middle school team, she must be fairly, fairly proficient.

B.84:  Yeah, well, she's pretty fast.  She's not real big -- 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- but she's real fast.  

A.87:  [Baby_crying] Oh. 

B.88:  And so, uh,

A.89:  Oh, yeah, it's hard to just for me to picture these little ones.  That
basketball is pretty big to be throwing --

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  -- you know, up that -- 

B.92:  Yeah but,

A.93:  -- that high.  

B.94:  Oh, in the beginning, you know, they couldn't even make the basket --

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to -- 

A.97:  Oh. 

B.98:  -- take solid shots and they couldn't even get the ball that high because
they were so little and not strong enough.

A.99:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.100:  And then, uh, her last game just before the whistle blew, they had two
seconds left.

A.101:  Oh. 

B.102:  She threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket.

A.103:  Oh, wow [laughter].  

B.104:  So she was the hero after all those years of trying -- 

A.105:  That's great.  

B.106:  -- to get that ball up in that basket [laughter] so,

A.107:  [Laughter] Well, that's great.  

B.108:  So that was pretty fun to see the improvement.  

A.109:  [Laughter] Now do,  

B.110:  And her coach was behind us in the bleachers -- 

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  -- but from the other team and he said, Christmas came early this year
[laughter].

A.113:  [Laughter]. 

B.114:  So,

A.115:  Well, how fun.  

B.116:  Yeah.  

A.117:  Now, do you have any boys that play or,

B.118:  No, my son never played --  

A.119:  How old is he?  

B.120:  -- uh, basketball.  He's, he's grown, and he, he's in the band and he swam
some.

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  Mostly he was a student.  

A.123:  Oh. 

B.124:  [Laughter] So,   

A.125:  He was, he was,   

B.126:  Yeah, he's a national merit student and -- 

A.127:  Great.  

B.128:  -- he speaks five languages and all that so,  

A.129:  Oh, great.  

B.130:  He wasn't much into sports.  He did play baseball for a while and he --

A.131:  Uh-huh.  

B.132:  -- liked that.  

A.133:  Oh. 

B.134:  But, uh, he didn't, he didn't play basketball at all. 

A.135:  Well, that's fun.  Have you ever played basketball?  

B.136:  I did, I played basketball in high school.  I loved it.  That --

A.137:  That is,

B.138:  -- and volleyball.  

A.139:  I've just played it for fun.  I've never done anything, you know, organized
or on a, a school team or anything.

B.140:  Uh-huh.  

A.141:  But I think it's a real fun game.  

B.142:  Yeah, I love it.  I think, it's my favorite and it's my favorite to watch.

A.143:  Uh-huh.  

B.144:  And when I was in high school I was a twirler and so -- 

A.145:  Oh. 

B.146:  -- I always enjoyed that and cheerleading, you know, we -- 

A.147:  Oh, uh-huh. 

B.148:  -- got to do it indoors.  

A.149:  Right.  

B.150:  So I always liked the basketball games better than the football games --

A.151:  Right.  

B.152:  -- because you weren't out in the cold.  

A.153:  Well, it seems like, I don't know, basketball may be, I don't know if that
m-, [laughter] but it doesn't seem like basketball's that aggressive compared
to football and,

B.154:  Well, yeah, and it's easier to follow.  

A.155:  Right.  

B.156:  If the ball goes in, they get two points. 

A.157:  Uh-huh.

B.158:  Football everybody falls on top of each other and it's real difficult to
say --

A.159:  Who,

B.160:  -- exactly what went wrong, you know [laughter].  

A.161:  [Laughter]. 

B.162:  For me -- 

A.163:  Right.  

B.164:  -- anyway.  

A.165:  Right.  

B.166:  Uh,

A.167:  That's,

B.168:  So,
