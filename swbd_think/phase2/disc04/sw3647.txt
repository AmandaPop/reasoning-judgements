A.1:  Brian in Plano, Texas.  How are you doing today?  

B.2:  Hi, fine, I'm Nancy.  How are you?  

A.3:  Great, Nancy.  

B.4:  I'm in Plano also [laughter].  

A.5:  You're in Plano also, huh?  

B.6:  Yes, we're not too long distance today.  

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  [Laughter]. 

A.9:  Well, good to hear.  I was just talking to someone the other day from
Pennsylvania.

B.10:  Oh, that was good.  Utah, I've had a couple of, but that was it.

A.11:  Really?  

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  All right.  

B.14:  [Laughter]. 

A.15:  Well, good to hear, good to hear.  

B.16:  Learned about their basketball team [laughter].  

A.17:  [Laughter] Which one?  

B.18:  Uh, Jazz.  

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  The Utah Jazz.  

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Yeah, they're, they're pretty good.  They've got some -- 

B.24:  That's what I heard.  

A.25:  -- good --  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  -- good, some good, uh, good players out there.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Well, you ready for New Year's Eve?  

B.30:  I am.  

A.31:  Good.  Should we, uh, start this so we can,

B.32:  Okay.  

A.33:  What was your name again?  

B.34:  Nancy.  

A.35:  Nancy, that's -- 

B.36:  Right.  

A.37:  -- right, and I'm Brian.  
 
B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  Just a moment [beep].  Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is
benefits --

@B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- in the job other than salary.  What, uh -- 

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial
benefits?

B.44:  Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have
benefits with my job.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  I'm a nurse and I -- 

A.47:  Oh [laughter].  

B.48:  -- work, I float -- 

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- so that I have no benefits except higher pay -- 

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  -- for doing that.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make
enough money by the hour to make up for that.

A.55:  To, to compensate -- 

B.56:  Right.  

A.57:  -- for some of the benefits.  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  Oh. 

B.60:  Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff
someplace.

A.61:  Yes.  

B.62:  And then I have my freedom.  I can work seven days in a row and take a week
off or whatever I want to do.

A.63:  Well, that, that's an excellent, so actually that is a benefit, uh,

B.64:  Well, it is to me.  Most people prefer the security of nine to five,

A.65:  [Laughter]. 

B.66:  and weekends off and -- 

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  -- knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement, and I'm just
really not interested [laughter] in --

A.69:  Right.  

B.70:  -- all that.  

A.71:  Right, well I guess that's a good point, uh,

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  I do belong to a, a large corporation or my, that where I'm currently
employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've
already mentioned is, is health insurance.  I think through our health
insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan --

B.74:  Right.   

A.75:  -- as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual
basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large
corporation and that got to be somewhat expensive, so I --

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group
discount.

B.78:  Right, and especially if you have a family.  

A.79:  Yes.  

B.80:  Then I think it makes a big difference.  

A.81:  [Laughter] Yes, and that's, that's one thing I do have.  

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as
a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, I don't think I would have
insurance, uh, other, 

B.84:  Right.   

A.85:  I don't think I would go through that expense.  One other benefit that you
mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, I really enjoyed
because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could
work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours --

B.86:  Oh, yeah.  

A.87:  -- or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a,
you know, three w-, day weekend.

B.88:  Right.  

A.89:  And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.  

B.90:  Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same
every week?

A.91:  Well, basically, yeah I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every
quarter of the year.  I mean --

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had
responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so
that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management
personnel, so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent
benefit --

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  -- that I really enjoyed and I don't c-, have that in my current operation,
but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?  

B.98:  Oh, well, I guess,

A.99:  [Laughter]. 

B.100:  retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
[laughter],

A.101:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  

B.102:  I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but
that's who I am so,

A.103:  Well, and that's an individual thing.  

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  Yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice
retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our
corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate
in the, the profits of the company.  If we're, you know, if we've been there a
while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an
interest, uh, in the company --

B.106:  Right.  

A.107:  -- that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high
times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times and, uh, also, uh, in one
of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit
sharing plan that, that,
