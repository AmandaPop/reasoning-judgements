============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, so what kind of books do you like to read?

B.2:  Um, I think Sidney Sheldon is probably my favorite author.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  I'm a teacher, and so, when I read for pleasure, I read strictly for
escape [laughter].

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  So, I like, you know, I like books that are pretty high adventure and just
real simple easy reading.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  What about you?

A.9:  Um, I prefer, my favorite types of books are, uh, human interest type
books.  Biographies, um, it can be fiction about people.  I like books that
are about people that have historical, you know, that tell you something about
the history at the same time, you know --

B.10:  Oh, that's good.

A.11:  -- in a certain area. 

B.12:  What book have you --

A.13:  So.

B.14:  -- read that you really like?

A.15:  Um.

B.16:  Do you like about recent people or people in history?

A.17:  Both.

B.18:  Both.

A.19:  Either one, yeah.  Um, I've read lots of books I really like.  Let me
think, um.  Have you ever heard of a book called THE HIDING PLACE?

B.20:  Oh, yes.

A.21:  By Corrie Ten Boom. 

B.22:  That's --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- wonderful.  That's one of my favorite books.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  That's really neat.  Yeah, I like books like that, too.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  Yeah, that's a wonderful book.  That's funny you should mention that one.

A.29:  Yeah, yeah.  I like, um, I guess my preference is for Christian
biographies, but, um --

B.30:  Oh, okay.

A.31:  -- I'm interested in both, you know, because I, you learn a lot from
reading about people's lives and, um, so, yeah, that's probably one of my all
time favorites.  What, what would you say is your favorite book that you've
ever read?

B.32:  Oh, I don't know.  With all the hip and hype, I still love GONE WITH THE
WIND.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  I haven't gotten a copy of SCARLETT yet --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but, uh, I'm sure I won't [laughter] like it as much as GONE WITH THE
WIND, but that's, that's just a real masterpiece.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  Yeah, I --

B.40:  I guess that --

A.41:  -- #uh-huh#.

B.42:  -- #really# is my favorite book.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  I remember a long time ago I read some books by Glen Bristol.  You
ever read any of,

B.44:  No, I never have.

A.45:  Yeah, those, um, I don't know why GONE WITH THE WIND made me think of that,
but those are books that are, um, like they, some of them took place in, well,
there's one that took place in Georgia and another (( )),

B.46:  Are they historically based?

A.47:  Yeah, they're historically based fiction.

B.48:  Uh-huh, I like historically based fiction.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah.

B.50:  When, um, oh, all those books by John Jakes came out --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- are you familiar --

A.53:  #I don't think I am.#

B.54:  -- #with what I'm talking about#?  There were like.  Huh.

A.55:  I don't think I am, but go ahead.

B.56:  Oh, it started with THE BASTARD, and then it --

A.57:  Oh, yes.

B.58:  -- when it came over to the United States and took us through the
Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  I've forgotten what all of them were.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  They were right around the Centennial --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- year, though.  Um, and they were really, you know, I really, I, I got
into them and read I guess, probably four or five of them, and then I got
[laughter] burned out and said, Oh, I think I'm tired of this [laughter] ((
)).

A.63:  Yeah [laughter].

B.64:  I like ones that are families --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- like you read one, and then you read about the next generation, and --

A.67:  Oh, yeah.

B.68:  -- the following generation.

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  I think they also asked, do you ever read books for self improvement?

A.71:  Yeah, that's right.  I do sometimes, but, um, they have to have
illustrations, or else I, I get bored with them [laughter].  #For, for the most
part.#

B.72:  #What do you mean by illustrations?#

A.73:  I mean illustrations, real examples, you know --

B.74:  Right, right.

A.75:  -- instead of just giving me a sermon or giving me a, you know, how-to type
idea.

B.76:  Do you know what I [laughter] hate, I hate to read books by people like HOW
TO RAISE CHILDREN, and they're single.

A.77:  Yeah [laughter].

B.78:  You know [laughter]?

A.79:  Yeah, see, they have to have it for real,

B.80:  DEALING WITH YOUR TEENAGER, and they're never around kids [laughter].

A.81:  Yeah, some real examples from their own life --

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  -- to prove that they know what they're talking about.  I just read one
called, uh, THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE --

B.84:  Um.

A.85:  -- by Gary Smalley and someone else and that was --

B.86:  Was it good?

A.87:  -- really good.  Yeah, it was full of personal illustrations, and
illustrations of people they'd work with.  They're, um, psychologists --

B.88:  Um.

A.89:  -- so.  What about you?  What do you like to read for self-improvement?

B.90:  I don't know.  I [laughter],

A.91:  [Laughter]

B.92:  [Laughter] I really, I get, oh, I would rather read a book that's like for
inspiration --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- than a real self-help --

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  -- book, I mean.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  I don't know, I don't get off on them just a whole lot [laughter].

A.99:  Yeah, I guess I agree there.

B.100:  You get --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- bored real fast.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  When I, when my kids were younger I used to read books on how to raise
kids, and --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- had nothing they said worked.  So, I [laughter],

A.107:  Oh, dear.  Yeah.

B.108:  I said, enough of that.

A.109:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.110:  But I do like --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- you know, I like various and sundry kinds of books.  I like to read ones
like by Bill Cosby just for fun.

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  Erma Bombeck.  

A.115:  Oh, yeah --

B.116:  Things of that type, too.

A.117:  -- with humor in them (( )),

B.118:  Yeah, I love humor.

A.119:  Yeah, yeah those are good.

@@B.120:  Yeah.  Well, I think that probably covers --

A.121:  Yeah.

B.122:  -- the topic.

A.123:  I think it probably does.

B.124:  Okay, I've enjoyed talking to you.

A.125:  Yeah, I have, too.

B.126:  Okay.

A.127:  Good-bye, have a good evening.

B.128:  Uh, you too.  Bye-bye.

A.129:  Bye-bye.
