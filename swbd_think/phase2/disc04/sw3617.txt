======================================================================

A.1:  Well, now what kind of exercise do you get involved in?

@B.2:  Well, I basically [breathing] do the Nautilus.  I work out at the Y, um,
three times a week, and, um, then I try to walk in between times, so, and I've
found, and I, at the Y, I ride a stationary bike and then I, um, and sometimes
I will do Stairmaster, and, then, then I use the Nautilus equipment.  And, uh,
I basically like it a lot.  Uh, I've been doing it about a year and a half,
and, and I really, I really enjoy it.  I particularly like the machines, um,
that, that seems to have worked real well for me, and then I do like to walk,
that's, that's my, um, other exercise that I like to do.  So, and, you know, I
see, I feel like I feel a lot better since I've, uh, started doing that.
Seems --

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  -- to help me a lot.

A.5:  Yeah, I, I used to run, I ran for about twenty years, but it takes
[throat_clearing] wear and tear on the joints, so couple --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- couple years ago I switched over to stationary bike, and I do about
fifty miles a week on a stationary bike for, to keep my lower body developed,
and then I work out three times a week with, uh, weights at home to, you know,
keep the upper part of, shoulders and, you know, arms, that sort of thing.  So
that seems between the two of them it's seems to keep me, I guess, fairly fit.

B.8:  And you work out at home, then?

A.9:  Yeah, basically.  I have, I have a stationary bike at home, have some
weights at home that I use, and then, you know, I try to supplement it
periodically with, you know, some walking, what have you.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, my husband, uh, ran for a while, but it was just too hard on
his knees.  He, he just felt like it did his knees in, so he went to, um, he
walks and or does Stairmaster, um, you know, depending on his schedule and the
weather.  Um, but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints, too.  So,
he, he,

A.11:  Well, well, the running was just too hard on both my knees and my hips, and
the, um, stationary bike keeps you toned and is, keeps the stress off of the
joints.

B.12:  Right, right.  Well, we, um, the, the place where I work out has just
gotten all new equipment, so I'm trying to get used to adjust, adjusting to
the new equipment, but I do like it.  It, it, uh, it seems to, um, do certain
muscles much better, I think, it, um, you know, works you out in a better
place.  It doesn't, uh, bother your, my back as much, and, but I, it's hard,
it's like now, you have to adjust to all this new stuff, and, it, there's a
lot of adjusting of each individual piece of equipment.  So, I, I'm in the
process of trying to, um, [laughter] get adjusted to it, but I think I'm going
to like it, um, because it just isolates muscles so much better than the
other.

A.13:  Well, I guess they went out and bought all that equipment just to keep you
on your toes, huh.

B.14:  Yeah [laughter].  I think.  Well, luckily the Y here, I live real close to
the Y in Plano, and, uh, they are getting ready for major expansion, so
they're going to, they're just going to open up, we're going to have bigger
rooms and, and more room to work out.  Then they've got new weights and, and
all this stuff, so.  I go to the Y with a friend, and that seems to help me
stay motivated to, to continue to work out.

A.15:  Well, I, I just do the self motivation.  I can do my fifty miles on the
bike, that's four times a week, and then the three times the weights.  Some
days I do both, and then some days it's one or the other just depending on how
it goes on, on the weights and the bicycle.  Like, you know, even yesterday on
Christmas day I was on the, I did the weights for a while, and, the bicycle,
but today I just do the bicycle because I can do the bicycle a couple of days
in a row, but the weights you have to do those every other day.

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  So.

B.18:  Now, now do you watch television or do you just sit there and bicycle?

A.19:  Um, usually when I'm bicycling I listen to the, uh, listen to the radio,
uh, just turn on some music and listen to the radio when I bike, and --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- same thing while I'm using the weights, and, sometimes I'll watch the
news or whatever.  Most of the time I just listen to the radio, though.

B.22:  Now do you bike, when you say fifty miles, that's total a week?

A.23:  Yeah, um, I do it in four thirty minute sessions.

B.24:  Oh, okay.

A.25:  So, each, each time I do it it's roughly twelve and a half miles --

B.26:  I see.

A.27:  -- per session --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and then I do four of those and that sums up being fifty miles.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  And what kind of a bike do you have, what kind of stationary bike
do you use?

A.31:  Uh, I don't even remember the name of it any more [laughter],

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  but it, it works pretty good.  It measures, you know, it measures your
pulse and, and, and your (( )) power and calories expended and, you know, it
has levels of difficulty from one through nine, and so forth, I don't even
remember the name of it any more.

B.34:  Well, the bikes I've used at the Y, one of them, I can't remember what they
are right at the moment, either, but, the, the old ones were, you pedalled
sort of downward, you know, you were basically sitting pretty much like a
standard,
