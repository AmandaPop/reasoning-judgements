=========================================================================

A.1:  Of a exercise program you have.

B.2:  Well, um, [throat_clearing] I have a, a, a former exercise program.  I'm a
graduate student, and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost
impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  Um, [throat_clearing] last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer
and, and life guard, so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of
exercise swimming and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could,
uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.  But, um.

A.5:  Well, swimming is, uh, one of the best exercises you can do.

B.6:  Oh, yeah.

A.7:  [Baby_talking] I mean --

B.8:  Oh, yeah.

A.9:  -- as far as for, uh, cardiovascular and --

B.10:  Uh-huh, and there's --

A.11:  -- and it's --

B.12:  -- and there's no jarring on the.

A.13:  -- least hard on your body, I,

B.14:  Pardon?

A.15:  It's the least hard on your body --

B.16:  Exactly, yeah, um, flu-, --

A.17:  -- as far as, uh, impact and 

B.18:  -- yeah, fluid resistance.

A.19:  Right, right.

B.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  How about you?

A.21:  Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's
not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of
miles --

B.22:  Oh, yeah.

A.23:  -- and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week,
when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and --

B.24:  [Laughter]  Yeah.

A.25:  -- and go jogging for, uh --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- half hour or so, but --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.

B.30:  Yeah.  Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?

A.31:  I like it.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I like it, uh, part of my problem is I have small children, so, uh, to do a
whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- scheduling and --

B.36:  Sure, yeah.

A.37:  -- that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh, when you're in college, boy.

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  You got a hundred things going on.  Of course, you got a little different
direction going, but, uh.

B.40:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred
fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five.  Um,
[throat_clearing] so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I
first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly,
and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it
now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be --

A.41:  #Right, you don't notice it# --

B.42:  -- #I don't worry about it#, yeah.

A.43:  -- as much, yeah.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two
pounds, I start, I start feeling it and,

A.45:  You feel it, don't you?

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and I weigh probably about
the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed
places [laughter].

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  And things don't fit just quite exactly --

B.50:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.51:  -- fit the same.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few
facilities.

B.54:  Yeah, there are.  Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right
downstairs there's a facility.  And I really feel kind of guilty for not
working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where
all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there and.

A.55:  Do you enjoy it, or is it, uh.

B.56:  I really do if I have the time to.

A.57:  If you can have, find the time --

B.58:  Uh-huh --

A.59:  -- it's just the.

B.60:  -- yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and
just do that for a while, but that's hard, [laughter] you know.

A.61:  Yeah, it is hard --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- it is hard.  It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- sacrifice another half hour.  My problem is I don't want to wake up
another half hour earlier --

B.66:  Exactly.

A.67:  -- and do more [laughter].  

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  Don't get enough sleep as it is, right --

B.70:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

A.71:  -- and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh,
everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do
it, it's really a release.

B.72:  Oh, yeah.

A.73:  You feel invigorated and you feel --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- [Inhaling] oh, you feel in a lot better shape --

B.76:  Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours.

A.77:  -- just like eating right foods.

B.78:  Yeah, yeah.

A.79:  If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?

A.81:  I do.  I have to be real careful.

B.82:  Uh-huh.  I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months
ago.

A.83:  Did you?

B.84:  Uh-huh, completely.  I mean, any kind of meat or, and I, and I really feel
a lot better [throat_clearing] now.

A.85:  Makes a lot of difference.

B.86:  Yeah, it really does.

A.87:  Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.

B.88:  Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat
comes from --

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  -- and so.  I found that really helps.

A.91:  And unless you really like, uh, fish.

B.92:  (( )).

A.93:  Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.

B.94:  Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since.  I used to eat
a lot of fish, too, but [throat_clearing] I just tried to cut it all out for a
while and see what happens.

A.95:  Kind of see what happens.

B.96:  Yeah, and I like it.

A.97:  I've tried to do that with sugar and, 

B.98:  [Laughter].

A.99:  it's almost impossible --

B.100:  [Laughter] #I don't know if I'm that brave yet#.

A.101:  -- #everything has sugar in it#.

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.

B.104:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.105:  Course, and I like sugar, too, that's --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- that's a problem, but.

B.108:  [Laughter].

@@A.109:  Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you.  Think we've, uh, covered
all the subject.

B.110:  Okay, yeah, it sounds good.

A.111:  Okay.

B.112:  Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.

A.113:  Well, you, too.  Good luck, uh, enjoy college while you can.  Let me tell
you it's, uh.

B.114:  Well, I'm in graduate school now.  I, [throat_clearing] I, I kind of feel
like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now [laughter].

A.115:  It's a little different, uh --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- challenge, isn't it?

B.118:  Yeah, it is.  Well, it's good talking,

A.119:  Where are you going --

B.120:  Pardon?

A.121:  -- studying?

B.122:  I'm studying speech pathology.

A.123:  Right.
