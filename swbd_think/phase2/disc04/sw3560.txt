=====================================================================

A.1:  Well, let's go ahead and start with you.  What kind of, kind of pets did
you have?

@B.2:  Okay.  Well, yeah, when I was growing up, uh, we had dogs all the time.
So,

A.3:  Uh.

B.4:  I always had at least two dogs.  I think at the most we had three and, uh,
then when I met, my, my wife, she was more of a cat person and she kind of
more or less got me converted over to cats.

A.5:  Uh, oh [laughter].

B.6:  And that was the last pets that we had.  Uh, but we, we went ahead and gave
them away to, uh, another family.  You know, put an ad out and had, had them
take over the pets.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Uh, because we had, uh, we started our family and and you know cats shed a
lot and --

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  -- plus they were kind of rough for the babies, playing with and stuff 
so,

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  We decided to not have any pets for a while.

A.13:  Well cool.  When I was growing up we had a dog.  One dog and [laughter],

B.14:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

A.15:  It had a disease and we had to put it to sleep and that --

B.16:  Oh, no [laughter].

A.17:  -- and that was traumatic enough in our family for the time being and they
have another one right now at home, but I am not there so that is kind of a
[popping] bummer.

B.18:  Yeah, yeah.  Well we are thinking of maybe, as a matter of fact, my wife
wa-, was telling me that when she was out Christmas shopping that, uh, they
had a display in one of these pet stores.  They had a, uh, cat there.  It
turned out to be an older cat, about two years old.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And, uh, it was really good with the boys.  I, I have two boys.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Four years old and two years old.  And she said it was really good with
them and uh, real, real tame cat and she was asking me, you know, well do you
think we should go back and get it now or,

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  should we wait a little bit longer and [laughter] I told her well we
should probably wait.

A.25:  [Laughter].

B.26:  But, I, you know she is kind of wanting to get at least another cat.

A.27:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.28:  But, I think I would like to go ahead and get get them a dog.

A.29:  Cool.  I kind of like dogs myself.  I think they are just fun to have
around.  Something to play with.

B.30:  I think, you know, I really do think that a dog is more of a, a children's
pet --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and a cat is more of an adult's pet.

A.33:  Yeah, I tend to agree with that.

B.34:  Cause, uh, I know, I, I, when I was younger and, uh, growing up with dogs,
I didn't like cats at all.

A.35:  [Laughter].

B.36:  I didn't want anything at all to do with them.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Cause you know they just don't respond to you the way dogs do and, uh, you
know I feel that is something that that a kid looks forward to,

A.39:  Oh, absolutely.

B.40:  You can tell a dog to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and
he chases it.  That kind of thing.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And you, uh, know it will play with you, but a cat pretty much just keeps
to himself and, you know, how cats are [laughter].

A.43:  Right [laughter].  I kind of tend to agree.  I think, 

B.44:  [Throat_clearing].

A.45:  uh, especially dogs.  I really, when I had ours I enjoyed it because
just like you say you could throw things at --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- it and you could chase it.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  That and whenever there was any you know any sense of, of, urgency or any
sense of problems with any of my friends or anybody around our family, he
would just jump up there and protect us, you know.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  He was a small dog and it was just, it was good to know that there was
always somebody there or something there to take care of you.

B.52:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  I know that, uh, you know your yard is always a
safe haven and, uh, and really if you have got a dog back there [laughter].

A.53:  Yeah, exactly.

B.54:  You are really protected because they will stand up for you.  And I, I
guess I kind of miss that.

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  My Dad, uh, well our, our the pets that I grew up with all either ran away
or died uh, a long time ago.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  My Dad just recently got another dog and it, it [laughter] ran away.

A.59:  Oh, no [laughter].

B.60:  It was a real small dog and he is thinking of getting another one.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  I don't know if he will or not.  But he wants to get another dog.  My mom,
mom can go either way.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  She doesn't really care too much.

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  As long as it is clean.  Yeah.

A.67:  Yeah.  Well that was a big thing at our house.  It was, we couldn't let it
in the house, but the thing that I think my parents use it most for was to
teach us responsibility.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  You know, it was our dog and we had to take care of it and if we didn't
there was, you know, (( )) --

B.70:  Yeah, yeah.

A.71:   -- definite repercussion.

B.72:  Yeah, I think probably I would be happier with just an ordinary mutt.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  You get a dog that is show quality and you know you got to be real careful
with it and,

A.75:  Yeah probably.  I think, I think a lot of times mutts are the best dogs
anyway just cause they are you know they really, you know you care enough
about them --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- to take care of them, but not so much that you are worried about what
you do with them --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- but if you are paying millions of dollars for it, I think you would be a
lot more concerned [laughter].

B.80:  Yeah, that, you know, I don't want to get into a thing where you take him
to shows and and all these papers and stuff --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- and you have got to be careful and all this and that.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  Not that you wouldn't take care of it any less, but that is just something
you know, I don't want my boys to have to uh, get into that kind of thing
[popping].

A.85:  Yeah, [tapping] well I agree.  I think it is a lot more fun when you don't
have to worry about the cost of what you spent on it as much as having it as a
friend [noise] and, uh,

B.86:  Sure.  Basically, a companion and that is it.

A.87:  Yeah exactly, and that, you know it is really weird because although we
have fought a lot about it [noise] and who was going to take care of it when
we had it, we really all missed it when it was gone.

@@B.88:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I can can agree with that.

A.89:  (( )).

B.90:  Well, it was nice talking to you.

A.91:  Hey, it has been my pleasure.  You have a great afternoon.

B.92:  Alright, you too.

A.93:  Thanks.  Bye-bye.

B.94:  Take care.  Bye-bye.
