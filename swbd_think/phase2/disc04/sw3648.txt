A.1:  Uh, subject's gun control.  

@B.2:  Yeah {faint}.  

A.3:  Uh, do you own any guns?  

B.4:  Uh, besides a, a, a B B gun, no.  Uh, a lot of my family owns a lot of guns
and stuff and I, I have a lot of friends that do, also.  Lot of my friends are
really into guns --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- as far as knowing the specifications of every gun there is just about
[laughter].

A.7:  Yeah, I know the sort.  I'm not much into guns myself either.  I know it,
enjoy working with them from time to time but --

B.8:  Yeah {faint}.  

A.9:  -- m-, personal opinion is a whole lot of weapons available in markets that
really shouldn't be available at all.

B.10:  Yeah, that's, that's my opinion is that some of these high powered
handguns need to go out the window because they're obviously not for
hunting.

A.11:  Uh,

B.12:  That,   

A.13:  Yeah, they got,

B.14:  A handgun was never designed for hunting.  

A.15:  Well, very few of them.  It, they do make some for bird hunting --

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  -- but still, those aren't real high powered.  They're just, you know,
small caliber with a long barrel on them.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  But, uh, no the, a-, and these assault weapons, the real short stock, short
barrels and --

B.20:  Yeah, these, the, the -- 

A.21:  -- armor piercing ammunition.  

B.22:  -- the nine milli-, the nine millimeter Glock to, to s-, top the charts.
It's a --

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  -- it's a plastic automatic weapon that fires,

A.25:  They sell them there at Wal-Mart.  

B.26:  Wal-Mart?  

A.27:  Three different models of Glock, yeah.  

B.28:  Wow.  

A.29:  Wal-Mart sporting goods department here in town c-, carries the Glock.

B.30:  Um.  

A.31:  They haven't got the, the latest version, but, uh, they've got them --

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  -- I think seventeen rounds in a double wide clip.  

B.34:  Seventeen,

A.35:  Craziness like that.  

B.36:  Seventeen rounds of clip that fires by itself.  

A.37:  Practically, yeah.  

B.38:  D-, d-, did you hear about the, the killing spree in Killeen --

A.39:  #No.#

B.40:  -- #over here# in Texas?  

A.41:  No, I didn't.  

B.42:  We had a guy that went through a Luby's in Killeen and, like, killed
twenty-three people and injured a hundred plus others.

A.43:  Luby's.  

B.44:  And then killed himself.  

A.45:  What's a Luby's?  

B.46:  Uh, it's a cafeteria, restaurant.  

A.47:  Oh, wait, yeah.  Uh, that's been several months ago.  

B.48:  Yeah, several, several months ago, yeah.  

A.49:  Okay, yeah, I did hear about that.  

B.50:  That's,

A.51:  They weren't the least bit sure what happened, what, what set him off.

B.52:  That's what, well, nobody really knows what it was.  It was, they
determined that it was a, a series of events over the years of some sort,
form of hatred of women and that's why he was mostly shooting women.

A.53:  Oh, see I hadn't heard anything about, you know, what the bulk of his
victims were but,

B.54:  Uh, he was just a wacko.  

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  But that shows you what a, a, a Glock automatic weapon will do.

A.57:  That's what he was using?  

B.58:  He had that and, uh, one other gun which I don't recall what it was.

A.59:  Was it a -- 

B.60:  #But,# 

A.61:  -- #rifle# or a pistol?  

B.62:  The Glock?  

A.63:  No, no, the, the other gun. 

B.64:  Oh, the other gun, it was another handgun.  

A.65:  Okay.  No, I hadn't, I, I hadn't heard what it was he was carrying.  All I
knew was he'd been in there shooting.

B.66:  Yeah, it wa-, 

A.67:  I hadn't heard anything about what he was carrying.  

B.68:  That's what it was.  He went around,

A.69:  [Breathing]. 

B.70:  putting holes in anything he wanted to at whatever rate of speed he felt
like.

A.71:  Yeah, I do know they have a fast, uh, fast recovery.

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  [Breathing] Uh, goodness.  Well, uh, they,

B.74:  I, I, I also agree with the, uh, the seven day wait on handguns.

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  That's a,

A.77:  Probably ought to be longer than that, really.  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  Seven's probably as long as you can expect the law to, to -- 

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  -- require. 

B.82:  At, at the moment, they want seven days and that's, you know, that's the
best thing we got to work with, go for it.

A.83:  Yeah.  Seven day wait, waiting period and a check through the F B I files
and,

B.84:  Yeah, because I, I really can't understand why these legislatures want to
fight it --

A.85:  Yeah {faint}.

B.86:  -- unless they just don't have anything better to do.  

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  [Breathing]. 

A.89:  They ought to carry, they ought, anybody with a permit to carry a gun, uh,
you ought to have a permit for any kind of gun to carry, period --

B.90:  Yeah.  

A.91:  -- whether it's pistol or rifle or, it doesn't matter.  Uh, the permit, you
ought to, ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times,
whether you got your gun with you or not --

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  -- like a driver's license.  

B.94:  You should have a, a, a permit to use it and, uh, be trained on how to use
it.

A.95:  Yeah, uh, it's part of the problem with guns in general.  They got hundreds
out there, you know, the only experience they got is the, you know, the last
couple times they got about half looped and went out and the gun, uh, uh, out
in the woods and started blowing up bottles.

B.96:  Yep.  

A.97:  Every hunting season scares the stew out of me even just to drive by a
section of woods bothers me a little bit --

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  -- because I know there's maniacs out there the first couple of days.

B.100:  I, my dad has borrowed a, uh, thirty, thirty from, uh, his, uh, nephew --

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  -- and is supposed to go hunting and I, I'm really, really kind of nervous
about it myself because I don't want him to go out there and get hurt.

A.103:  Well, later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem.  Especial-,
