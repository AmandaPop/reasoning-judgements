========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what do you think about, uh, funding --

B.2:  Space exploration.

A.3:  -- yeah.

@B.4:  Well, the NASA program I think has been very beneficial for this country,
and, and, and a lot of the household goods and stuff that we have today I
think has come out of that program.

A.5:  I do too, um.

B.6:  Uh.

A.7:  I have been a, a big supporter for, I guess since the third grade when I,
uh, watched, uh, uh, John Glenn orbit the earth --

B.8:  Oh, yeah [laughter] --

A.9:  -- you know --

B.10:  -- yeah.

A.11:  -- and, uh, been fascinated with it since then, and I think it's just in a,
uh, just a great source of national pride.

B.12:  Well, and I think, I, I was going to say, you, you and I probably grew up
at that time, where we, uh, benefitted by the, the emotion and the, that the
program provided all of us, you know, really got wrapped up in what was going
on.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  The cost, however, I will have to admit, that I look at some of the, uh,
problems that we're facing in the country, and I'm not sure that we can
continue to devote nearly the dollars that we've been devoting over the recent
years.

A.15:  Well, [throat_clearing] you know, whenever I, I look at, uh, the way our, 

B.16:  [Throat_clearing].

A.17:  our, our federal dollars are spent, and, uh, really the NASA program
takes a fairly small amount of that, if you look at a percentage basis --

B.18:  That's true, that's true.

A.19:  -- and I think that there are so many other areas that we are, uh, throwing
money away that really have, you know, we don't see anything for it, and I can
see, I can see something from our tax dollars, uh, in the space program, and,
uh, I don't know, I, I, I for one wouldn't, wouldn't take a dime away from
them.  If anything, I think I would like to see, uh, uh, more money spent, uh,
uh, with NASA and less --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- on other programs.

B.22:  Well, and I was going to say, there are some other areas they could cut,
you know, I don't, they wouldn't necessarily have to cut it out of there.

A.23:  Yeah, but, uh, no, I used to, uh, you know, think that, golly, it'd be
great to, uh, to fly on, on the space shuttle.  Of course, that was up until
the Challenger,

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  incident, and really brought to, to light that, you know, and, really we
had lead, we had led a charmed life, uh,

B.26:  In think, in thinking that nothing could go wrong (( )).

A.27:  Right, right, and just, you know, in relying, you know, just saying, gosh,
you know, we really are just super duper, and then, you know, that proved,
hey, we were fallible, and, I mean, it was one of those things where it was
tragic, and yet eventually it had to happen, I mean, it had gotten to the
point that, you know, the space shuttle launches were just so commonplace --

B.28:  Uh-huh, they really were.

A.29:  -- yeah, and, and, you know, it just, you know, relegated to the second or
third page of the newspaper, uh, but still, I, I mean it's hard for me to
imagine that, uh, space flight is something that is going to really be within
our reach, uh, you know, or, or commonplace for the average person, uh,

B.30:  Yeah, I, I don't see that happening, either, although I would tell you that
in a, in a heartbeat I would go along.

A.31:  Yeah I well,

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  I, I tell you, I've flown practically everything but the space shuttle,
and, uh, it would be hard for me to turn it down --

B.34:  Oh, yeah.

A.35:  -- if there was, if the offer was there.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Uh, they say it, it really is something.  The, the, one of the things,
though, that I think that's so incredibly valuable about the space shuttle we
have here in Houston, uh, the I Max theater --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- uh, that has, you know, this tremendous huge screen and they had a
program called, uh, PLANET EARTH, that was made up of, um, just about an
hour's show --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and it was all, uh, footage filmed from outer space of Earth, and it was
spectacular.

B.42:  Oh, yeah.

A.43:  And, it, it, I think that it helps, you know, perhaps, and I hope that it
does, makes more and more people aware of, you know, the fact that, uh, we
live on a fragile, you know, a fragile planet, and that it, it's important to
take a global view, and what better way to, to do that to, to see it up on
Earth --

B.44:  Yeah, that's true.

A.45:  -- I mean, from outer space.

B.46:  Well, and we're probably going to be the only nation for some time now that
could possibly afford or be far enough along to continue with this kind of a
program --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- you know, with, with the U S S R --

A.49:  Right --

B.50:  -- crumbling at this point.

A.51:  -- and then again, well, and then again it's one of the few things that we
continue to lead in --

B.52:  That's true, that's true, too.

A.53:  -- and I hate to see us sacrifice something that we've got, uh, an edge on.

B.54:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.55:  But, uh, [throat_clearing] one of the things that was interesting out of
that, out of that program that they said, that, uh, they compared, uh, uh,
photographs of different parts of the ocean over the course of, uh, fifteen or
twenty years --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- uh, from previous, uh, uh, flights, and, uh, they could document the
change in the color of the ocean, and whether that had to do with a change in
Plankton because of the ozone, or the, the rising temperature, or whatever --

B.58:  The water, yeah.

A.59:  -- yeah, but it was interesting that, you know, you could, they could even
see from up there how we're changing our environment in, in such, you know, an
incredibly short time.

B.60:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, the capabilities from a, uh, uh, reconnaissance
basis, whether that be for peaceful operations like you just described or
military, whatever, is phenomenal from that altitude.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Uh, their ability to, to eavesdrop or to, to photograph or to, uh (( )).

A.63:  It's awesome whenever I, I, I've read the stories about, and, you know, and
heard things about some of the, the, the things that the satellites can do
from up there as far as photography's concerned, I mean, it's, they said that
they can,
