A.1:  Arlington, Texas now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day
[laughter].

B.2:  Is that right?  [Laughter].

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Well, I never thought about that, but there is an Arlington, like I had a
call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan --

A.5:  Oh --

B.6:  -- you know, and I was thinking --

A.7:  -- Birmingham.

B.8:  -- yeah, and I was thinking the only Birmingham I could think of was
Alabama.

A.9:  Right.  It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country.

B.10:  Yeah, well, tell me what kind of books have you read?

@A.11:  Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four
years so mainly, 

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  text books.

B.14:  I was going to say, not fun kind, right?

A.15:  No, um, but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily
always heavy ones --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- but, you know, sometimes biogr-, I just read one about Grace Kelley.  I
love to read about real people.  To me, half the time it's more fascinating
than some of these made up stories [laughter].

B.18:  Yeah, it is, because you know that's it's really and truly --

A.19:  Yeah, it happened.

B.20:  -- a true thing.  You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.

A.21:  Really?

B.22:  Yeah, that was real good.  I'm like you, if it's not a heavy biography, you
know --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- I enjoy it.

A.25:  I used to like to read about royalty a lot.  I, when I was younger I read
about every king and queen that lived, [laughter] I think, in Europe.  That
was my thing for a while.

B.26:  I was trying to think, uh, I read a, uh, a novel that used the names of
like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and
all, and there was a murder.

A.27:  Oh, really.

B.28:  Yeah, it was some time ago.  Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or
something like that.

A.29:  Oh, it sounds like fun.

B.30:  It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.

A.31:  Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know Margaret Truman
Daniels writes a lot those.

B.32:  Yeah, in fact I believe it was because,

A.33:  Really?

B.34:  Uh-huh.  I believe.

A.35:  Sounds like something she would write.

B.36:  Yeah, I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had
given it to me, and I thought, well, this will be great, and it was.

A.37:  Yeah, I've heard that she's done real-, you know, her books are really
interesting, and they always sell well.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  And, uh,

B.40:  Well, when you use real people like that, I think --

A.41:  Yeah, brings it to life.

B.42:  -- royalty, especially, you know.

A.43:  I know, uh, the Bri-, some of the British people laugh at us because we're
so enthralled with their [laughter] royalty.

B.44:  Yeah, but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and
so forth, you know.

A.45:  I know, our movie stars.

B.46:  Our movie stars, because it's totally different concept to us.

A.47:  Oh, right.

B.48:  I haven't, I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either.  I have
read, uh, mostly novels.  I went to visit my daughter in Florida --

A.49:  Um.

B.50:  -- and I took a novel with me, uh, and read it at Thanksgiving time, and,
uh, it was, uh, one of those generation novels, you know --

A.51:  Oh, yes.

B.52:  -- starts out when they're small and continues through generations --

A.53:  Oh, I always like those.

B.54:  -- and I like that.

A.55:  Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch?

B.56:  Yes, I have.

A.57:  Isn't she fabulous?

B.58:  Oh, she is wonderful.

A.59:  Oh, once you st-, I don't like to get one of her books because, 

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  I, I just live to read.  I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to
the book [laughter].

B.62:  I stayed up one night, I think until two --

A.63:  Oh, yeah.

B.64:  -- in the morning finishing one of hers because I star-, I could not put it
down.

A.65:  She's just a, I don't know, does she, how often does she come out with
them.  I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.

B.66:  Well, no, it seems like she doesn't write as often as, oh, well, like
Danielle Steele and those silly things.  She writes the same thing.

A.67:  Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.

B.68:  Yeah, and, and they're the same silly things, I mean, if you've read one, I
mean it's,

A.69:  Yeah, I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think.

B.70:  It, it's practically the same thing over and over, you know.

A.71:  And think how rich she is.  

B.72:  Yeah, wouldn't I, you know, I'm criticizing her, and wouldn't I like to
have her money --

A.73:  Oh, yeah.

B.74:  -- because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them.

A.75:  And then make movies out of some of them.

B.76:  Uh-huh.  You know, mini series and so forth, and it seems to me like Susan
Howatch does not write as often.  I have not seen as many of hers.

A.77:  Well, hers are so involved, and they're so --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.

B.80:  I think she does a lot of research, too.

A.81:  I do too, so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these 
popular --

B.82:  Huh-uh.

A.83:  -- writers, but oh, her books are just incredible.  I don't think they've
ever made a movie, do you?

B.84:  No, I don't think so, and I've often wondered why, haven't you?

A.85:  Yes -- 

B.86:  You know, I,

A.87:  -- well, no, uh, I really just thought about it now but there's just, 

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  Maybe it's because they take so much in.  I don't know.

B.90:  Uh-huh.  Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and
sit through them, you know.

A.91:  They're so big --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- they're such, you know, it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I
guess --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- another three hour movie [laughter].

B.96:  And maybe that turns people off, but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.

A.97:  Oh, I know.  It's about one of my favorite movies.

B.98:  Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?

A.99:  No, it had such a bad press, I wasn't too (( )).

B.100:  Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.  I was amazed, because I, in
the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- I heard mixed publicity --

A.103:  Right.

B.104:  -- kind of good and bad, and then when it came out, all I heard was just,
oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.

A.105:  Me, either.  Do you know anyone that's read it?

B.106:  Huh-uh.

A.107:  No, I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.

B.108:  No.

A.109:  I think it was on the best-seller list, though --

B.110:  Well --

A.111:  -- for a while.

B.112:  -- it wouldn't surprise me,
