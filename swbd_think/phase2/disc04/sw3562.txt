========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Well, you, you start it.

@A.2:  Well, I feel that women have, in the roles that they've played, they've,
uh, they used to be at home all the time with the children, and now most of
them work out of the home, because it takes two incomes to make it --

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  -- these days, and, um, they just, uh, they, there's more women than men
now, and they've learned that they have to take care of themselves, that they
can't depend on a man to support them now.

B.5:  Sure.  Unfortunately what that's done is it's put everybody in a terrible
position because it used to be that one person could work, whether it a man or
a woman.

A.6:  That's right.

B.7:  Okay, now we're in a situation where, uh, it, or at least it seems that
maybe it's the economy or maybe it's just, uh, you know, employers taking
advantage of the fact that women want to work, and now they, they've made it,
or at least seems that like two people have to work in order to, uh, in order
to #afford to live# --

A.8:  #Makes end meet.#  Uh-huh.

B.9:  -- you know, but, uh, I think it's, it's great.  I mean, my wife works, 
uh,

A.10:  Well, it's really too bad, they, and, because the women are so underpaid,
and there're so many sole supporters that are women now.

B.11:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  What they say like women get sixty-seven
cents to the dollar --

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- that men make doing the same job.  That's, that's terrible.  But, I, I
think that'll change, too.

A.14:  Well, see, in my days, when I was a teenager, my, I wanted to go to school,
and my mother said, well, she didn't want to send me to school. I was going to
get married anyway, she said.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  So that meant I was going to get married and a man was going to work and
take care of me.  But you don't think that way now.

B.17:  No, that's why every, every woman I know works.  Even my mother, who didn't
work for a while, is back working now.

A.18:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.19:  Um, except with the few exceptions of people that are unemployed, which is
unfortunate lately, um, every woman I know works.  My wife took some time off
after we had our, uh, ch-, our first child --

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  -- but even that she's planned on getting work.  What's good for her is she
works in a profession that she could get work at home --

A.22:  #Oh, well that's good# --

B.23:  -- #so she's going to#, so we don't have to do the,

A.24:  -- that's really good.

B.25:  Yeah, she's an editor, so she gets to do that.  And my sister.

A.26:  She's a what?

B.27:  An editor.

A.28:  Oh, an editor. 

B.29:  Like in publishing, yeah.

A.30:  Oh, that's really good she can do that at home.

B.31:  She could do that at home, so that's good.

A.32:  Yeah.  I wish they could come up with more jobs for women to stay home with
their younger children.

B.33:  Yeah, I think that's the dilemma.  Unfortunately my wife is in a profession
that is, uh, relatively high amount of women in, in publishing --

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  -- uh, and it just so happens, or maybe doesn't so happen that it's not a
very high paying field.  Now maybe that's because there's a lot of women in
it, like you're saying --

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  -- women are underpaid.  Uh, the amount of money that she was making
didn't, didn't make it worth her while to, uh, you know --

A.38:  Pay a babysitter and,

B.39:  -- not be home, pay for a babysitter --

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  -- or day care --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- uh, you know, she had that, and, and on top of the fact that.

A.44:  Uh-huh, plus the clothing she has to have to wear.

B.45:  Sure, sure, that on top of the fact that, that, uh, uh, she can do some
work at home that, that it makes it, makes it a perfect fit but,

A.46:  Well that may be a thing for the future, the computers now, that they're
trying to stress that for women to --

B.47:  Yeah, or to have --

A.48:  -- so women can stay home and work on computers.

B.49:  -- or have day care at the work place, one or the other.

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  Uh, but unfortunate, it's like that's not doing too hot.  A lot of, lot of,
lot of times it's the opposite, though.  A lot of times, um, men stay home and
the women, women go to work, which I think is good if you're not breast
feeding.

A.52:  That's not, I haven't found anybody like that.  I've heard of that --

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  -- but I haven't met anyone like that.

B.55:  No, I, I, I've known a few people and I've read, uh, about others, you
know, just like articles and stuff about other people doing it.  I certainly
would do it.  Uh, I have no problem with that.  Unfortunately I'm paid a lot
more than my wife, so it wouldn't be worth it --

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  -- um, for our family.  But I,

A.58:  Well, how do you think women's roles are going to change in the future?

B.59:  Um, well, I think as, as time, as time goes on, women will, um, definitely
have a better, better, better role in the work place.  I think that, you know,
the first wave of women in the work place in any substantial degree was in,
you know, like in the seventies and eighties --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- and I think as women take on, um, roles of, uh, more importance in, in
jobs and, and also, again that sounds, I don't want to sound like, you know,
like I, like I think, 

A.62:  [Laughter].

B.63:  it's hard, but I mean, a lot of times women were given jobs because they
were women, you know --

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  -- and I think once, once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they
deserve and get the pay that they deserve, which will often be powerful
positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring --

A.66:  Well, see I,

B.67:  -- I believe when they hire, you know.

A.68:  In the past I could understand why men got paid more than women, because
they were the, they called them the bread winners, and they'd support the
whole family --

B.69:  Yeah, but that's --

A.70:  -- but that's not the case now.

B.71:  -- that's why, not the case.

A.72:  So I, that's why I don't think that they should get paid more than the
woman if they're --

B.73:  (( )).

A.74:  -- doing the same job.

B.75:  Why would it be fair earlier, I mean, you know,
