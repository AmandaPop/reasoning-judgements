A.1:  Okay, Scott, let's, uh, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where
the child is going to go to a university --

@B.2:  Uh-huh.  Do you have any?

A.3:  -- and, 

B.4:  Do you have any kids or,

A.5:  I have some, yes, some children.  I have three boys.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And they're all quite young --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and so we want to plan for their education or we're saving right now and
we're getting bonds, and, and, uh, and hopefully finances set aside so that
they can choose a college that they want to.  How about yourself?  Do you have
any kids?

B.10:  No, I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now [laughter].

A.11:  [Laughter] So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of
selecting your college --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- your own college.

B.14:  Yeah, definitely.  In fact, I'm even going, uh, selecting again for, for my
P H D.  It's, it's a close subject right now [laughter].

A.15:  Very good.  

B.16:  Uh,

A.17:  What, uh, what do you use as a basis to determine which college or
university you go to?

B.18:  Well [throat_clearing], I use, uh, uh, uh, I have used, uh, several
techniques depending on what, for undergraduate, I, I, you know, my criteria
were much different than --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- than like for graduate school.  Uh, when I, when I wanted to go to an
undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know,
rather small and easy to get around, you know.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  [Throat_clearing]  And what I would, what I thought would be easy to get
through.

A.23:  Yeah [laughter] what you thought, huh.

B.24:  Yeah [laughter].  And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you
know, it changed a whole lot.  I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh,
[inhaling] graduate with a little, you know, with a name behind me, rather
than, uh --

A.25:  Just the degree itself.

B.26:  -- yeah, yeah.

A.27:  Well, that's a, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same
thing in my undergraduate work.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- that you didn't have a lecture, uh, hall with about fifteen other
students competing for the professor's attention --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- and, uh, but you, I felt that I got a pretty good, uh, undergraduate, 
uh,

B.34:  Where, where did you go?

A.35:  I went to Utah State University --

B.36:  Okay.

A.37:  -- which is in Logan, Utah --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and the nice thing about it too is, I knew that I wanted to get into
business and that their business, College of Business, was accredited and well
known --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- at least there in the State of Utah --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and around the surrounding states and so forth.  And so I, I feel like,
number one, you ne-, you also need to see what kind of name the, like you
mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- and another thing that, uh, another reason why I chose that was the, the
finances.  I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I
wouldn't get through four, three years of the undergraduate work and, and have
to leave.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  And, uh, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- with, uh, counselors at high school, and also read some, some books on,
on the subject at the, at the library.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And, uh, it was kind of unusual because my, my two older brothers and I all
went to thr-, three different universities, depending on what our choice was.
So.

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  [Laughter] Hopefully we, we chose the one that was best for us, and I, I
felt very comfortable and good about that.  So.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able,
I mean, obviously you've taken precautions, you know, or measures to, uh, try
and pay for your children's education, but do you think that that's going to
be enough?

A.55:  I don't think so.  

B.56:  No.

A.57:  [Laughter] I don't know.  The, the way that tuition is increasing, um,
exponentially --

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  -- it's, it's, [laughter] it's kind of hard to set aside money and have
that money grow --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing.

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  I, uh,

B.64:  I, all I, all I can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy
university.

A.65:  [Laughter]  And that, that your children can use the benefits of --

B.66:  Yeah [laughter].

A.67:  -- that university.  Well, that's an excellent idea, that's an excellent
idea.  One thing that, uh, that we did, uh, and my parents, and our family, is
that we weren't able to afford, um, the kind of education that we all desired.
So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try
for scholarships --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and, uh, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my
education, because my parents couldn't.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- and save and, and, and get.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  Also, my, my brother, um, he's a, he's a medical doctor right now.  He had
to, you know, once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had
to take out some loans, and he's, he's working to pay those off.

B.76:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.77:  So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial
stages of it, that there's different options you can use and, and, uh --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- the student loans are, are good options.

B.80:  Yeah, that's what, that's [throat_clearing] my biggest option right now.

A.81:  Yeah [laughter].  Yes, and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not,
