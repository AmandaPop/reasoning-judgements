========================================================================

A.1:  Going to go first?

B.2:  No, go ahead.

A.3:  All right [laughter].

B.4:  [Laughter] You called.

@A.5:  Right now I'm in college, right now I'm a college student, as a matter of
fact,

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  So, I'm pretty pretty fresh with it.  I just think a lot of it depends on a
variety of thing, it depends on, for me, it was a combination of finance, um,
being in a place where I would enjoy the atmosphere and I'd feel comfortable,
as well as just, the general type of education that the school gives.

B.8:  Yeah, well, I, I don't know.  I think it depends a lot on, um, well, all
those things, that's true, but I got my daughter into college last year, and
it was really a major decision.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  But there were just so many things to consider, and I don't really think we
even considered all of the things we should have.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, so she's out in California.

A.13:  Oh is she?

B.14:  Yeah, but what we didn't consider was coming back and forth and things like
that [laughter] you know.

A.15:  [Laughter] Yeah, exactly.

B.16:  Yeah, really, so that's kind of, that was kind of hard, so I don't know.  I
think it's always confusing.  It's hard to make a choice.

A.17:  Oh, absolut-, I think, you know, like you said, a lot of it, there a lot
things.  For example I go to school out in Utah --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- and my family lives here in Texas, and so it's kind of, like you said,
uh, I never realized what an expense it would be trying to come home and,

B.20:  It really is, and you don't get to come home as much as you think you will.

A.21:  No, I maybe have been home, oh, twice in the last two years for Christmas
[laughter].

B.22:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it's really hard to.

A.23:  Yeah, it is, and I think to this, this, a lot of times, like you said,
that's one of the major considerations is, you know, how much do you want to
be with your family, or how much do you want to, and that's something that I
didn't think about until [laughter] I was already out there.

B.24:  And I don't think you even know that answer until you go, either.

A.25:  Yeah, exactly.

B.26:  You know, everybody's anxious to get going and get away and go do their
thing, but then they really want to come home --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- and they can't always --

A.29:  Yeah, that's for sure.

B.30:  -- so that's kind of hard too.

A.31:  You learn to appreciate what you had [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter] That's true, isn't it [laughter]?  

A.33:  It is.

B.34:  Yeah, it is, I know.

A.35:  What other points did you guys look at when you were trying to find her
school?

B.36:  Well, the size of the school --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- because we live in Plano, so the schools are really big here --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- very crowded.  So she didn't want a school that was really too big.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And we looked at that, and I don't know that that's really relevant because
you're going to end up with your little group anyway.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  So I'm not sure that it makes too much a difference.  Although we did find
that like down in Texas, uh, at U T, you know, down in Austin, that those
classes are so full, like you can have two hundred kids in a class.

A.45:  Yeah, and see I think that makes a huge difference, where I,

B.46:  That would be horrible.

A.47:  It is, where's I'm going, my freshman year I didn't have a single class
with less than nine hundred students.

B.48:  That's horrible --

A.49:  Yeah, and it was --

B.50:  -- oh, my gosh.

A.51:  -- it was frustrating.  You'd see a T A once a week, and even the T A -s
rarely knew who you were, so.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  It became a thing, like you said, where you're, where you're competing
either to, you know, to get someone's attention, to get help, or you just kind
of, if you're not self-motivated where I'm going, it's really hard to,

B.54:  Where are you going?

A.55:  Um, to Brigham Young University.

B.56:  And it's that crowded, is it really?

A.57:  Um, in the freshman classes that are, you have, there's about twenty-four
thousand students.

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  And so it's kind of [laughter], it's a lot of fun.  When you get in the
upper lev-, upper level classes it's a lot easier but,

B.60:  Yeah, yeah, wow, gosh.

A.61:  And that's something that I hadn't considered, because I was raised in
Plano as well, and I went to Plano East and I never, you know --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- there's lots of students, but there wasn't that many.  You know, thirty,
thirty-five in a class I didn't mind.

B.64:  Where are you in college now?

A.65:  I'm a junior.

B.66:  Junior, yeah.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  My daughter went to Plano East, too.

A.69:  Oh, did she?

B.70:  She twirled.

A.71:  Oh, cool.

B.72:  Yeah [laughter].  She was the only twirler they've ever had.

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  But that's what she's doing out in California.  That's why she's out 
there --

A.75:  Great.

B.76:  -- because we had to consider where a good spot was, too.  And.

A.77:  And that's, you know, I think a lot of it depends on, like you said, I
think for me, what I wanted to get out of the college experience had a lot to
do with it.  It wasn't, it was a combination of academics as well as other
things so,

B.78:  Yeah, yeah, well.  But a lot of times, kids aren't sure what they want to
be, like she started out with sport psychology --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- so we looked all over, that was a hard thing to find --

A.81:  Right.

B.82:  -- and then she changed her mind anyway, and --

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  -- I think most, most people do that, I think, they say, you know.

A.85:  Uh, I have, three or four times [laughter].

B.86:  Yeah, see, and they say that that's average --

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  -- that that's very common.  So maybe that's not such a great reason to
look at a school, I don't know.

A.89:  Yes, I think for me personally, when I was choosing, I was looking more the
overall experience instead of just --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- you know.  But the specific field that I was looking into at that time,
so.

B.92:  Well, she was too.  When you live in Plano, you know, you sort of have
everything, they really spoiled everybody here at school.  We all are.

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  All our kids are, you know, to be honest, and we went out to U S C because
they wanted her to twirl for them, and she was terrified.  She was just
terrified of living in L A.

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  She was too scared to go there.  So I guess you have to look at that too.

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  And I understood it at the time, when we went to the campus and visited, I
thought, Oh, gosh, it would just,
