=======================================================================

A.1:  Kind of a heavy topic tonight right,  

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  about, uh,

B.4:  That's, you have to start the new year out, by the way, Happy New Year.

A.5:  Thank you, same to you.  What do you think about the, uh, [breathing] that
idea that they're recommending for the young people?

B.6:  I hadn't really heard that before.  

A.7:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.8:  #Uh,# I had at one point thought about doing the Peace Corps myself many
years ago.

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  Uh, you know, many years ago it seemed like they had, uh, uh, involuntary
enlistment and mainly like in the fifties, I know a lot of, uh, men that were
into the military, you had to go into the military.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  [Breathing] Uh [lipsmack], I don't know about that.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  A lot of people I don't think would like it because it's going to interrupt
college plans, but a lot of people don't have plans, so for them [laughter] it
might give them a little help to, uh, get, uh, some kind of more awareness
about the world and be of some use for a while.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  I, I personally think it would be a, a good idea.  Uh, I have kind
of a s-, well, it's not really a Peace Corps experience, it's a little bit
similar.  You may assume that being from Utah I'm a member of the Mormon
church --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- and we do a lot of missionary work.  

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  And I spent two years when I was nineteen in Argentina.  

B.20:  Um.  

A.21:  And, uh, I'll tell you, that gives you a different perspective of, uh, you
know, some of the things we have here in this country that, uh, people really,
uh, don't appreciate and seeing a different culture and, uh, getting to know
a, kind of a different, a different people I think was a good experience for
anyone regardless of, uh, you know, their particular endeavor, they're en-,
they're en-, engaged in.  I think just getting out of the country is a great
benefit to anyone.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  So, have you ever lived abroad or spent any time outside of the United
States?

B.24:  I haven't, no -- 

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  -- but, uh, I had known of the Peace Corps because I had a cousin in the
Peace Corps.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Course, you know, it was much more publicized in the sixties.  I don't even
know if they have it today.  I had a friend, though, in the seventies join,
uh, VISTA --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- which is a similar program -- 

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  -- although you stay within the U S which can be very beneficial, too, I
mean, a lot of times there is a lot of help we can do --

A.33:  #Oh, sure.#  

B.34:  -- #within# the U S.  

A.35:  You bet.  

B.36:  Uh, and that program I thought was excellent.  

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  Uh, I just don't think they even, I don't know if they have those programs
anymore, if they even try to publicize it and recruit and I think that's a
shame because both of those pro-, programs are excellent --

A.39:  #Yeah, uh,#

B.40:  -- #and, uh,# #hopeful-, do-,# 

A.41:  #It seems like they,# excuse me, seems like they used to advertise it on T
V in the, the Peace Corps.

B.42:  I don't remember, I guess I haven't seen it recently.  

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  Not that -- 

A.45:  So,

B.46:  -- you know, not down here any, I don't, I don't remember seeing anything
about VISTA or, or the Peace Corps recently.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think it would be a good idea.  Is, a, it is kind of a
delicate time, but by the same token, at that age, they haven't really settled
down, don't have a family or other commitments as well, and so there's some
d-, vantages to going at that particular time in your life.

B.48:  Right.  

A.49:  And, uh,

B.50:  Right.  

A.51:  Well, well, #I think,# 

B.52:  #Yeah, I think# it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody.

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  Uh, I, I could see that there would be some people that, you know, would
throw up their arms about it and go, I'm going to Harvard and I, you know,
[laughter] --

A.55:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.56:  -- this isn't something I want to do, but, uh, you're right, it would give
everybody a better perspective of, uh, you know, ourselves and what we have,
maybe make us appreciate what we have a little more so,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's, that's certainly my, was my experience, just, uh, it
was like the, the, uh, clock had been turned back about ten or fifteen years.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  You know, just the difference in the technologies in the two countries, the
kinds of cars they drove, the, you know, simple things like central heating
and, uh, and having a gas fired, uh, water heater.

B.60:  Um.  

A.61:  You know, things that [laughter], that we really appreciate are, are not
commonplace in, in every, uh, in every, uh, city, that I was, uh, living in.

B.62:  Right.  I had, uh, twice now, been a big sister [static].  You've heard of
big brothers, big --

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  -- sisters.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  And, uh, I have had, uh, two little sisters, and even though they were
local to me, it was almost being in a different world because both of my
little sisters came from very poor backgrounds.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And, of course, they don't have usually normal families.  I mean, there's
not a [static] --

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  -- a mother and a father and -- 

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  -- they live in pretty poor housing and, uh, their education is very
lacking because their parents, you know, don't, uh, p-, encourage them to go
to school.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  Uh, so that was beneficial to me as well as the child, because, uh, made me
appreciate my background a little more, and I helped to give this person, uh,
a more one-on-one idea of, there can be a different life --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- than what they've had.  And, uh, to, uh, experience some things that
otherwise they wouldn't be able to get out and do.

A.77:  Yeah.  Is that, uh, a presently where you're, you, uh, commit for a certain
number of months, or are you're assigned a, a child, and you, you stay with
them for as long as you can?

B.78:  It's usually a year, uh -- 

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  -- and they try to find somebody in the local area to you and, uh, you
know, the age group that you want to work,
