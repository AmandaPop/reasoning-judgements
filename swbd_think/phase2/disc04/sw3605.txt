A.1:  Okay, we're supposed to take, talk about the changes in women's roles, I
guess.

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  You want to start?  [Laughter].

@B.4:  Well, [laughter] uh, seeing as how I'm sixty-four I, I, I've seen them
all.

A.5:  Oh, really?

B.6:  Yeah, from the time that I was in, in college in the forties, when the
majors that were open to women were, well, we could major in business --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- but that meant that it, we would either teach school, be secretaries or
bookkeepers, not accountants, just bookkeepers --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- or, um, let's see, well, we could have gone, well, I went to Abilene
Christian College, now University --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and we didn't have nurses training --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- so being a school teacher, a secretary, bookkeeper or nurse were about
the only occupations open to women --

A.15:  Um.

B.16:  -- and, uh, I, I've seen the generation change, uh, I belong to the Altrusa
Club of Dallas --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and, uh, we extended and, uh, started a club called the Altrusa Club of
Downtown Dallas.  And, the average age is, oh, I don't know, thirty-five I
guess --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- early thirties, maybe, uh, and I've seen, uh, the, the women's
occupations change to everything --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- engineering, doctors, accountants, C P A -s, uh, anything you want to
name.

A.23:  Um.

B.24:  So, I, I think that trend will continue into the future, uh, and I, I think
that unfortunately one of the fallouts is that these young women that were,
that, that, of, of my day, that the young women school teachers were so bright
and so capable that they're now the lawyers --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and accountants, and the doctors --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- and they're not [laughter] teaching school any more --

A.29:  Yeah, that's true.

B.30:  -- and I don't think anybody has focused on, on that and has seen that as
one of the causes of the deterioration in our school system.

A.31:  Yeah, well, they don't give them a whole lot of incentive.  I mean, you
look at the pay a teacher gets versus some of these other professions.

B.32:  Oh, I agree with you.

A.33:  And, and, and society's saying, You're not that valuable --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- you know, and that that sends a strong signal.

B.36:  Yeah, but, uh, I went on to law school --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and when I got out of law school out of the seventy graduates, there
were three women.

A.39:  Wow.

B.40:  And now, out at S M U, it's somewhere between forty and fifty percent --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- uh, of the students are women.

A.43:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.44:  And I, I'm sure that trend will continue.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  And, uh, there were no women preachers, of course. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. 

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  of course not.

B.50:  -- when I was coming along.  And, uh, uh, oh, this has been, oh, ten years
ago, I guess, I was at a luncheon and, uh, uh, it just happened that I sat
next to a Methodist preacher, and I said, we Catholics are running out of
priests.  Uh, how are you all making out?  He said, Well, if it were not for
the fact that roughly thirty percent of the entering class at Perkins, uh,
School out at S M U, we'd be running out.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  So, uh, now I don't know.  I don't think I'll see women priests in my
church in my lifetime [laughter].

A.53:  [Laughter] Well some churches have --

B.54:  Yeah, yeah.

A.55:  -- that's for sure.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  What do you see as the, the future of women's roles?

A.57:  Oh, I, I guess about, about the same as mine.  I don't see a whole lot of
barriers, except that the women are still stuck with the problem of how to
handle children --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and, I mean, it's companies, at least the companies I work with, aren't
helping, and they're not recognizing that that's a real problem.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Um, just basic things like having a day care center on the premises.  They
don't understand what it costs the company to have someone have to, you know,
go to the day care center every time the kid is sick or hurt or whatever, or,
you know, just, there's a lot of lost time there, and I think that they'd find
people a lot more productive and a lot more willing to maybe work long hours
or do whatever it takes if --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- they would help taking care of the children --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- because they're not doing that at all.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  So you've got, you know, an extra problem, that it doesn't seem like the
men have to deal with very much.  Some do --

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  -- and some don't.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  That's the biggest problem.

B.72:  Yeah, uh, most companies, even though they have written down policies that
say, uh, we will have, uh, day care policies and that sort of thing --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- uh, and parental leave and that,
