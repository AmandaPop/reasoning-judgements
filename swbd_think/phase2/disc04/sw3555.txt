=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what topic would you like to discuss, political topic?

@B.2:  Oh, I don't know.  I guess the thing that's on my mind lately is these
hostages that have been released.  So, I can't imagine how it would have been
to be incarcerated for that length of time.

A.3:  Well, I think it's marvelous they finally figured a way to get them out of
there, huh.

B.4:  I'm not sure what it ever, what it really accomplished having them, uh,
locked up for that long.  Did the, uh, did their captors ever really say, this
is why we're holding them, and.

A.5:  Well, what they wanted, of course, was one, money, and two, the release of
all the Palestinians held by the Israels --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- you know, the, the Jewish folks, and, uh --

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  -- I guess they're going to get a lot of those released, and.

B.10:  I understand there's, uh, what, several hundred, or even thousands of
political prisoners?

A.11:  Probably a lot.  I, 

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Probably a lot.

B.14:  What's, uh, what's been pressing you lately?

A.15:  Well, I think the developments in Soviet Union are rather interesting.

B.16:  Oh, yeah.

A.17:  I'm not real sure how they're going to all turn out.  I hope they turn out
positively and not turn into chaos, but.

B.18:  Well, does it sound like Gorbachev is definitely out of a job to you?

A.19:  Certainly sounds that way, doesn't it.

B.20:  Looks, looks that way.  Uh, I'm a little disappointed.  I think, I think
people, uh, well, he's won a peace prize and,

A.21:  Well, I think that's one of the problems of being a Mister Nice Guy and, 

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  I think that's what he was, and is --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- you know, I, I think he tried to accommodate too many people, uh, and in
a structure like that, apparently it's a difficult if not impossible task.  I
don't know.

B.26:  Yeah.  Huh.

A.27:  Europe is, whether we like it or not, when the U S S R was together, the
peace was kept in Europe --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- relatively speaking.

B.30:  Yeah.  Well.

A.31:  And, uh, there might be a big void there, and I, uh, it's certainly a fence
sitting situation.  I, I, I hope it's not a, I hope it gets resolved properly.
Let's put it that way.

B.32:  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens the next year
there.

A.33:  With all those nuclear weapons floating around, you get the wrong person
there, I think we could have major problems [baby_talking].

B.34:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.35:  I don't necessarily mean we, in the U S alone, but the world.

B.36:  I'm curious about what, uh, what Texans think of their neighboring state
and the recent, uh, gubernatorial race there, with, uh, David Duke.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  How was the, what was the press like in, in Texas over that issue?

A.39:  Well, of course there's a number of rednecks in Texas that I'm sure would
jump on his band wagon, but, uh --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- but I'm sure the vast majority would think it of him as he probably is,
uh,

B.42:  Uh-huh.  I, it's remarkable that he can, uh, I think that he can get this
far as he's gotten with, uh, you know, the kind of background he's got, and
I'm just surprised that he has, uh, seems like that'd be something that be so
controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office.

A.43:  Well, I think the South is not the nation.  Certainly still has many racist
type people --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- that would jump on his band wagon --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- and, uh, being a springer, splinter operation, I'm sure it wouldn't, you
know, it, it raises a lot of noise and everything, but I don't think it would
probably go very far in a --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- overall scope of things.

B.50:  Well, I think we're a little isolated where I live here.  We just don't
have many, uh, many blacks to speak of.  You know, probably less than five
percent of the population, I would guess.

A.51:  Well.

B.52:  We have a fair, a fair amount of, uh, Hispanics and, uh, (( )) not too many
blacks.

A.53:  Well, I think it's a, I grew up in, uh, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and, uh --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- I think, uh, you know, it's definitely a different philosophy of how you
look at blacks up north as you do in the south.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  And, you know, I, growing up, uh, where I grew up in a high school you had
one black that was from out of the area to start with, and you know, we had
three thousand kids in our high school, so.

B.58:  That was the extent of it, huh.

@@A.59:  We weren't really, you know, even, you know, when we played football
against a couple of black teams, and, you know, in that part of Milwaukee, uh,
you know, they were nothing.  You know, I mean, now it's all the blacks
[laughter] that's all in basketball.

B.60:  I'll say they, they sure dominate the pro sports, don't they, and --

A.61:  I --

B.62:  -- well, and collegiate too, so.

A.63:  -- I, I don't know what, uh, times have changed, and I, I think that's one
of the reasons the Packers will always have problems having a, getting back to
the status they were during Lombardi years and, uh, Green Bay, being an
extremely small town --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- sixty thousand, fifty-five thousand.
